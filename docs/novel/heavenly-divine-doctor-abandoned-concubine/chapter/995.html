            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 334 – Deep Sisterly Affection (1)</strong></p>
<p>Every time she talked to him, she wore a facade. It felt very fake. Annoyed, Mo Rongzhan just yelled, “Then just do as you like!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen reluctantly came to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility. When Lu Wushuang’s court lady saw her coming, she hurriedly welcomed her in. “Princess Fu Rong is here, Wang Fei has been waiting for you for a long time now.”</p>
<p>“Is Yaoyao here?” Lu Wushuang’s joyous voice drifted from within. After a while, the woman herself came out. “Yaoyao, come in,  it has been long since we saw each other. It is nice to have you here in the palace today. Let’s just have some nice conversation!”</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, I am here today because of Eldest Brother,” Ye Zhen said worriedly. She really hated how Lu Wushuang looked when she talked. Knowing that she was now a princess, she seemed to no longer consider her a threat so her attitude had just changed.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi had taken a lot of effort just for this stupid sister of his. No wanted he wanted her to die lest she is a perpetual threat to this woman.</p>
<p>It was a pity that things were very different now. None of them would have imagined the possibility of her coming back alive. They didn’t know that Mo Rongzhan’s suspicions had turned into certainty now, he knew Lu Wushuang was not the girl who had saved him.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang was stunned for a moment. “What’s wrong with him? Hasn’t he come back victorious already?”</p>
<p>“You don’t know yet?” Ye Zhen was a little surprised. She didn’t expect this girl to be so left out in the palace that she hadn’t even heard about her own brother.</p>
<p>“So what happened?” Lu Wushuang frowned as she asked.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother was injured by an assassin on his way back. The emperor has already sent Imperial Physician Qi over. Everyone in the family knows about this, so how come you don’t?” Ye Zhen said indifferently.</p>
<p><em>How come she did not know? Because no one came to tell her!</em> Everybody in the palace knew the emperor no longer doted on her like he had once, she had long fallen off the pedestal she once perched on. And now, she was becoming more and more awkward as a concubine!</p>
<p>“Is his injury okay?” Lu Wushuang asked nervously. If something were to happen to Lu Lingzhi, she might have to lose what she had too.</p>
<p>“I heard that he was poisoned—”</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang’s face turned pale. She knew too well her prosperity and wealth were closely tied to Lu Lingzhi. If something were to happen to him, she wouldn’t be any better off.</p>
<p>“Poisoned? How could he be poisoned?” Lu Wushuang stood up anxiously.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen watched as the woman grew anxious, and said flatly, “Don’t worry, with Imperial Physician Qi here, Eldest Brother will be fine.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang glanced at her. “If there is any news from Eldest Brother, you must tell me immediately.”</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, you should be able to get news more easily in the palace than we are able to. I came to get some insight from you,” she said with a smile.</p>
<p>“The emperor would not let the women in the harem inquire about the court, how would I know?” Lu Wushuang would never admit before others that she was being blatantly disregarded by Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded lightly but didn’t expose the other. “Then I can only ask Empress Dowager. But… if Eldest Brother’s condition is stable, he should be back in a few days.”</p>
<p>Now, Lu Wushuang wanted to win over Ye Zhen even more. If something happened to Eldest Brother, the only person who could help her in the palace was this cousin of hers.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, fortunately, you came to me, otherwise I wouldn’t know anything.” Lu Wushuang held Ye Zhen’s hands and said sincerely, “Us sisters, we must support each other in the future. Before, it was a misunderstanding on my part. Only now can I see how good it is to have a younger sister.”</p>
<p><em>So disgusting!</em> Ye Zhen truly admired Lu Wushuang in her heart. <em>How could she change her attitude so quickly?</em> Not long ago, she obviously wanted to drive her out of the capital, but now she was all over this “deep sisterly affection”.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, you are my cousin. Who could I help but you?” Ye Zhen smiled lightly.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang was very happy, she thought that Lu Yaoyao was very easy to coax. As long as she spoke a few nice things, she would be able to make her believe in herself. “My good sister, it’s no wonder Grandmother loves you so much. You have a heart of gold.” She smiled and said, “You weren’t in the Cining Palace today. Where did you go today?”</p>
<p>“I played polo with Little Prince.” She didn’t mention she had played chess with Mo Rongzhan, she knew the other would definitely be suspicious again.</p>
<p>But Lu Wushuang was a little discomfitted. <em>Why did both Empress Dowager and the Little Prince like this girl?</em> She put so much effort into pleasing them, but her mother-in-law didn’t even spare her a single glance, and only blindly favored Xu Huiru. The last time she went to Baihua Garden, she only took that b***h. “You have a good relationship with Little Prince.”</p>
