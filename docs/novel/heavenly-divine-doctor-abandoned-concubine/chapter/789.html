            <p><strong>Chapter 542 – I’m Going to Find Her</strong></p>
<p>It was not easy going to Black Wind Island when the weather was calm, let alone when a storm was about to occur. Once you went out to sea, you would be submerged in the waves.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan wanted to go to Black Wind Island in person. Although Zhao Tianji did not stop him he still explained the situation to him.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, you can’t go to Black Wind Island. Your subordinates will bring the princess back in person,” Shen Yi hurriedly said.</p>
<p>How could they let the emperor take such risks?</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan shot him a cold look and said firmly, “I’m going to find Yaoyao myself!”</p>
<p>Shen Yi looked at his master anxiously, “Your Majesty, it’s going to rain heavily, you can’t go—”</p>
<p>“I will accompany Young Mo to Black Wind Island,” Old Master Jiang suddenly said. “You should all wait here. There are still many messy things to deal with on Zhao Jia Island.”</p>
<p>“Old Master Jiang, you should stay on Zhao Jia Island,” Mo Rongzhan said. He didn’t want him to go on adventures with him at such an old age.</p>
<p>“Do you know where Black Wind Island is?” Old Master Jiang snorted coldly, turned, and walked towards a fishing boat. “This little wind and rain, I haven’t paid attention (not bothered) to it yet.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan could naturally not refuse anymore. An old man who could live for more than 100 years was definitely not an ordinary person. He turned around and instructed Shen Yi, “Take care of everything here.”</p>
<p>“This subordinate will fulfill your order.” Shen Yi’s expression was cold. He was clear about the meaning behind his master’s words.</p>
<p>Although Zhao Tianji had agreed to submit to the imperial court, not everyone was willing. They had to be cautious of those who still wanted to make trouble, and that Ye Shi…</p>
<p><em>Is also a character who has to be captured.</em></p>
<p><em>When the emperor rescues the princess, those who hurt her, will not end well.</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan got on the fishing boat, and Zhao Tianji asked Liang Yin to personally sail the boat to Black Wind Island.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen took Mu Fei to see Zhao Mingxiao.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao was locked up in the dungeon on the island. Zhao Tianji obviously did not allow him to live in a bad place owing to their past relationship. At least, the cell looked clean.</p>
<p>“Where is Mu Qing?” Huangfu Chen didn’t talk much and simply made his intention plain.</p>
<p>“Dead.” Zhao Mingxiao showed a cruel smile. “Even if I lose, I won’t let Mu Qing come back to you.”</p>
<p>Mu Fei grabbed the prison bars and shouted at Zhao Mingxiao, “Where is my sister? She is your wife, how could you treat her like that?”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao ignored Mu Fei but looked at Huangfu Chen resentfully. “I lost today, but I won’t be appeased, unless I die, otherwise… I will turn Zhao Jia Island into the Zhao Kingdom sooner or later.”</p>
<p>It was not that he had lost, it was just bad luck. He had planned it all well but didn’t expect that Mo Rongzhan would come to Zhao Jia Island this quickly nor that he would bring along the elite soldiers of the Jin Kingdom.</p>
<p>If he were given another year, he would not have to fear Mo Rongzhan at all. But today, he had only newly established his country, had a fall out with Zhao Tianji… the stone formation was broken, and Mo Rongzhan had already brought troops here… So he had no chance of winning.</p>
<p>“If something happen to Yaoyao and Mu Qing, you won’t have the slightest opportunity to achieve your ambition,” Huangfu Chen stated indifferently.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao sneered, not knowing what to think, and suddenly looked at Huangfu Chen seriously, “Mo Rongzhan came to Zhao Jia Island for Lu Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>Instead of replying, Huangfu Chen asked in a deep voice, “You locked Yaoyao in Black Wind Island?”</p>
<p>“Black Wind Island?” Zhao Mingxiao’s face changed greatly, and he stood up abruptly. “Lu Yaoyao is actually in Black Wind Island? That slut Mu Qing! Damn it!”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you take Yaoyao to Black Wind Island?” Seeing Zhao Mingxiao’s reaction, Huangfu Chen immediately understood that it was not he who sent Yaoyao to Black Wind Island, but Mu Qing.</p>
<p><em>Why did Mu Qing take Yaoyao to Black Wind Island?</em></p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao was almost in a state of rage. The reason he was confident of making a comeback was that he thought that no one knew the secrets of Black Wind Island. His weapons and food were all his confidence. If Lu Yaoyao was now on Black Wind Island, then his secret was no longer a secret, and Mo Rongzhan would definitely move all his weapons.</p>
<p><em>So what is left of me?</em></p>
<p><em>Mu Qing… that bitch!</em></p>
<p>“Zhao Mingxiao, where did you hide Mu Qing?” Huangfu Chen asked sharply.</p>
<p>“She leaked the secret of Black Wind Island, do you think I will let her live?” Zhao Mingxiao laughed hysterically. “I replaced her letter back then, it was I who set a trap on Spirit Snake Island, and it was I who let her live. I had someone sneak up on Zhao Jia Island to frame you, but so what? Mu Qing is dead, and she will never marry you again in her life.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen had long guessed that it was all Zhao Mingxiao’s doing, but now he no longer cared about these things, he just wanted to find Mu Qing. “If something happens to Mu Qing, you won’t live.”</p>
<p>“Without Black Wind Island, I have no reason to live,” Zhao Mingxiao said.</p>
<p>“Bastard! Where is my sister?” Mu Fei shouted angrily.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen asked coldly, “What on earth is in Black Wind Island?”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao just laughed and didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“There is provisions and medicinal supplies…and weapons that he has built in private mines in Jin kingdom for many years now. I thought they were all sold, but I didn’t expect them to be hidden by him.” Zhao Tianji walked in from outside and looked at Zhao Mingxiao with bleak eyes. “Brother, when did you start plotting against me?”</p>
<p>“When did it start?” Zhao Mingxiao’s frenzied laughter stopped, he looked at Zhao Tianji coldly and said, “From the day I knew your father deliberately made me wastrel. Why should you become the Island Lord when I can only live out my whole life as a wastrel? I am not much worse than you, and even more capable than you as the Island Lord of Zhao Jia Island…”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji took a deep breath, “So you deliberately showed weakness, and intentionally led me out of Zhao Jia Island, and lied to me so I could find iron ore and build weapons for you outside. You said that it was so that I could build a country in the future, but in fact, you did it for yourself.”</p>
<p>“So what?” Zhao Mingxiao asked coldly.</p>
<p>“The matter between you and me has nothing to do with Mu Qing, you owe her too much, let her go,” Zhao Tianji said.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao smiled coldly, “Death is liberation, and I have given her that satisfaction.”</p>
<p>“You really killed Mu Qing?” Zhao Tianji’s face changed.</p>
<p>“She should be dead by this time.” Zhao Mingxiao smiled. “If you can find her, there may be a chance.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at Zhao Mingxiao for a long time, then turned to Zhao Tianji and said, “Spirit Snake Island! I’m going to Spirit Snake Island.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that Mu Qing will be on Spirit Snake Island?” Zhao Tianji asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Gambling.” Huangfu Chen strode away.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao was yapping obviously because he thought that they could not find Mu Qing on Zhao Jia Island. So then the biggest possibility… was on Spirit Snake Island.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao looked at them gloomily and said, “Even if you find her, it’ll just be her corpse!”</p>
