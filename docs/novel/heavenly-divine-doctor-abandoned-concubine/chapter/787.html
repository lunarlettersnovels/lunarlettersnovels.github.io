            <p><strong>Chapter 544 – The One Who Saved You Was Ye Zhen</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen removed the quilt from her body, turned her face away from Mo Rongzhan’s scorching gaze, and said, “Where’s my master? What happened to Zhao Jia Island? How did you find me?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan felt sore and sad when he saw her deliberately avoiding him. He held her cheeks and forced her to look at him, “Why don’t you dare to look at me?”</p>
<p>“No.” Ye Zhen lowered her eyes and said, “I want to stand up, let me go.”</p>
<p>It had been a long time since he heard such a squeamish and soft voice from her. She was fine when they separated at Gujia Village, but now she refused to pay attention to him. It seemed that it had to do something with Ye Yaoyao.</p>
<p><em>This little girl is really jealous.</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan shook his head with a light smile, and helped her to stand up, but did not let her go, holding her tightly in his arms. “Zhao Mingxiao has been arrested, Zhao Jia Island is fine now, and your master stayed back (on the island). I wanted to come to find you in person.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pushed him and said, “Then let’s go back now.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan sighed in his heart and said, “There was a storm, our boat was swept away by the waves, and now we can only wait for others to pick us up.”</p>
<p>“Storm…” It was now that Ye Zhen remembered that there was thunder and lightning outside. She reckoned the winds and waves at the sea should be more significant. She looked at Mo Rongzhan in surprise, “It’s such a great wind and rain outside, how did you come?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t wait to see you.” Mo Rongzhan lifted her chin and kissed her again. He kissed her until she softly fell into his arms then let go of her red, swollen, and tender lips. “You don’t want to see me? Are you still angry?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen couldn’t break free from his embrace, so she had to let him hug her. She didn’t make any sound though she heard his words.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan kissed her cheek and said, “With such a great temper, you don’t even want to hear my explanation.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to explain to me, it has nothing to do with me,” Ye Zhen said lightly.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter… but you are still arguing with me? You didn’t go back to the capital and ran away to Zhao Jia Island. Have you ever thought about how worried I am about you? Just because I brought Ye Yaoyao back to the palace?”  His long arms wrapped her in his arms, his dark eyes looking down at her stubborn little face.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned and glared at him. “You are a high and mighty emperor; why would I make trouble with you? It’s your business if you want to dote on your savior; you dote on whoever you want; what does it have to do with me?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan couldn’t bear to hear the words she said about their relationship. He lowered his head and bit her ear, put it in his mouth, and sucked it for a while before releasing it. “I just took Ye Yaoyao back to the palace, she doesn’t remember anything. Do you think I believed Lu Lingzhi when he said that she’s my savior just based on his words? I just wanted to use her to test Lu Lingzhi… And you left without saying a word. I’ve been worried about you for so long, you little heartless thing. It was not easy to find you, and you still treat me like this?”</p>
<p>“You…you were testing Lu Lingzhi?” Ye Zhen raised her head in surprise. “Don’t you believe that Ye Yaoyao is the person you are looking for?”</p>
<p>“I want to find the little girl who saved me.” Mo Rongzhan looked at Ye Zhen and said in a low voice, “Lu Wushuang lied once, how can I trust the Lu family again? Although it seems to have nothing to do with Lu Lingzhi, I still have to find out.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said, “Speaking of which, you just don’t believe Lu Lingzhi. If you can’t find evidence that he deceived you, you would believe that Ye Yaoyao is your savior.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan smiled helplessly and said, “I had her reside outside the palace but brought her into the palace again… I just don’t want her to be used by others, and I also want to know whether her amnesia was deliberately caused by someone or that it is a result of childhood trauma.”</p>
<p>Although he was surprised that he began to doubt Lu Lingzhi, he did not doubt Ye Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Then did you find out?” Ye Zhen asked.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan squeezed her little hand, thinking that Lu Lingzhi was her big brother; and although she knew her origin, she was still a Lu now and her response was strange. “Lu Lingzhi said that Lu Shifeng imprisoned Ye Yaoyao, I don’t think so. However, Lu Lingzhi has done an excellent job. Ye Yaoyao has been imprisoned for several years, except for a few servants who have never seen him at all, even if I want to convict him, there is no evidence.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt that it didn’t matter whether Lu Lingzhi could be convicted or not. As long as Mo Rongzhan began to doubt him, he would never get what he wanted.</p>
<p>“Has Ye Yaoyao really forgotten everything?” Ye Zhen asked suspiciously. With the lessons she had learned from Lu Wushuang, it was hard for her to believe that Ye Yaoyao would be innocent. Like Lu Wushuang, Lu Lingzhi wanted to confuse Mo Rongzhan again.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan said, “She has forgotten everything. I have asked Qi Yizheng to treat her; perhaps, with time, she will remember.”</p>
<p>“What if she does remember? Do you really think she saved you when she was a child?” Ye Zhen looked at Mo Rongzhan in all seriousness.</p>
<p><em>Why does he never think about it? Ye Zhen and he had never met before… Why did she marry him wholeheartedly?</em></p>
<p><em>Ye Yaoyao and Ye Zhen.</em></p>
<p><em>This is so easy to think of, why does he deliberately ignore it? Could it be that he has vaguely guessed something in his heart, but refuses to admit that the person who saved him might be Ye Zhen?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan thought that Ye Zhen was worried that he would dote on Ye Yaoyao in the future, so he smiled and hugged her. “If Ye Yaoyao really rescued me, I will make her princess and bestow her a marriage in the future. Ok?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at him lightly and said, “It’s good if Your Majesty thinks it’s good.”</p>
<p>“Still angry?” Mo Rongzhan sighed. He had already said so, why was she still unwilling to open her heart to him? “Tell me, what should I do to make you happy?”</p>
<p>“Have you ever wondered why Ye Zhen married you back then?” Ye Zhen lowered her head and blurted out.</p>
<p><em>Ye Zhen again?</em> The tenderness in Mo Rongzhan’s eyes was replaced by a layer of frost. “Yaoyao, do you and I have to be separated by a Ye Zhen in this life? She is dead and I am still alive, can you forget her.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head and said, “No!”</p>
<p><em>I am Ye Zhen, how can I forget this? How can I forget those many years of loneliness, how can I forget the pain of dying under poisonous wine?</em> She had so many unforgettable memories.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan stared at her with burning eyes, not understanding why she always mentioned that woman every time they were alone.</p>
<p>“Have you ever thought… Ye Zhen was the one who saved you back then?” Ye Zhen asked tentatively. She had planned to tell him about this after she returned from Huaijiang. One thing he should know was that the person who saved him was Ye Zhen, not Lu Wushuang or Ye Yaoyao. She wanted to know how he would react.</p>
<p><em>The one who saved me was Ye Zhen?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan laughed angrily. He let go of Ye Zhen, took a step back, and looked at her coldly. “In order to speak for Ye Zhen, you really can do anything. But you know what, anyone will save me, except Ye Zhen.”</p>
