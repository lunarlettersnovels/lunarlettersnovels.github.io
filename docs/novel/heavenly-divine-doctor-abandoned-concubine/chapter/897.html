            <p><strong>Chapter 432 – Your Majesty, What is Your Command? (1)</strong></p>
<p>Unable to find Ye Zhen in the Lu family, Eunuch Fu returned to the palace with a tearful face. Under Mo Rongzhan’s cold eyes, he answered vaguely, “The servants of the Lu family said that Princess Fu Rong went to Huguo Temple quite some time ago. I heard that it was to accompany Old Madam Lu to pray for blessings. Your Majesty, perhaps the princess went there for you?”</p>
<p>At those words, the frost in Mo Rongzhan’s eyes inexplicably warmed up, and he raised his eyebrows pretending to be indifferent. “Really?”</p>
<p>“The princess is worried about Your Majesty’s body more than anyone else. It must exactly be like so,” Eunuch Fu said with great certainty.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s lips rose into a slight smile. “You can withdraw. If Lu Yaoyao comes, have her come in directly.”</p>
<p>Looking at the emperor who was in a visibly better mood, Eunuch Fu almost cried himself blind in his heart. <em>In case the reason the princess went to Huguo Temple was not to pray for him, then…</em></p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen returned to the Lu Mansion with Old Madam Lu, someone told her that a eunuch from the palace had just come to see her and asked her to go to the emperor’s palace immediately.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, since the imperial palace’s eunuch is looking for you, then you should hurry up. It may be that something is wrong,” Old Madam Lu said.</p>
<p>“Which palace servant came looking for me?” Ye Zhen didn’t really want to enter the palace, but she didn’t know if it was the empress dowager who was looking for her in a hurry.</p>
<p>The steward said, “It’s Eunuch Fu.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned subconsciously, feeling some resistance in her heart. <em>If it was Eunuch Fu, then it should be Mo Rongzhan who is looking for her.</em> To be honest, she didn’t want to see the man at all.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t he being lovey-dovey with Xu Huiru right now? And he refused to take his medicine, so what should she still stay in the palace for?</em></p>
<p>“Could it be that the emperor’s condition has changed?” Old madam Lu asked Ye Zhen in a low voice.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sighed. “Grandmother, then I’ll go to the palace and have a look.”</p>
<p>She had thought that Mo Rongzhan would not want to see her again. <em>Could it be that something really happened?</em> Judging by his complexion yesterday, he should have improved a lot, and there shouldn’t have been anything wrong.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wondered. Originally, she was thinking of going to Qianjin again today to see if there was any news about her father. It seems that she could only go again next time.</p>
<p>Upon entering the palace, she went to the Palace of Heavenly Purity.</p>
<p>As soon as Eunuch Fu saw her arriving, he was moved to tears. “Princess, you are finally here.”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Ye Zhen looked at his expression amusedly. “Nothing has happened to the emperor, right?”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with the emperor. Mister Chen visited this morning, but the emperor just wanted to see you. He doesn’t seem to be in a good mood. This slave told His Majesty that you had gone to the Huguo Temple to pray for him.” Eunuch Fu looked at Ye Zhen eagerly. It was obvious that he was hoping she would not expose his white lies.</p>
<p>“——” <em>She went to the temple to pray for Mo Rongzhan?! Unless she was out of her mind it would never happen!</em></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu smiled respectfully. “Princess, please go in!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head helplessly. After entering the bedchamber, she couldn’t see Mo Rongzhan’s figure. She took a look around and found that he was asleep on the soft couch by the window.</p>
<p>She frowned and looked at his complexion carefully. It looked better than yesterday. She quietly walked over, took his pulse, and confirmed that there was no problem. Done with what she wanted to check, she turned around, wanting to leave.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had already woken up when Ye Zhen had walked into the chamber. He wanted to know what she would do. When she came to get his pulse, his mood became very excited, thinking that she was actually not being honest and in fact, really did have him in her heart. <em>But why did she put his hand down so quickly?</em></p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao!” Mo Rong looked coldly at the person who had walked to the door and planned on leaving.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned her head in amazement, her body was being bestowed with the stare of a pair of dark and furious eyes. “Your Majesty, what are your orders?”</p>
<p>“Where have you been today? Were it not for the people I sent to find you, you did not plan on entering the palace again?” When Mo Rongzhan looked at her indifferent face, the joy in his heart was replaced by anger.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen replied lightly, “Answering Your Majesty, this servant was accompanying her grandmother to the Huguo Temple today, thinking that you wouldn’t need this servant to serve you medicine, so I didn’t enter the palace.”</p>
<p><em>Servant?</em> Mo Rongzhan’s expression became even colder as if there was an iceberg in his eyes sending a chill over all those they met. “Lu Yaoyao, you have to force me to be angry with you, right?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sighed in her heart. <em>Why is this person so hard to serve?</em> “Your Majesty, if you have any instructions, this servant will abide.”</p>
