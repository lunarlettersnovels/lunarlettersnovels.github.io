            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 90 – An Unexpected Encounter</h3>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that someone would come to Mo Rongyi soon enough. She didn’t intend to stay and take credit for it. Anyway, he had been rescued by her and would naturally remember her heroic act for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>She went back to find Teacher Shan but did not see her. This forest, although small in comparison to the imperial hunting grounds, was still vast. For all she knew, Teacher Shan could be at the opposite end of the forest looking for her.</p>
<p>She figured that the best thing to do was to wait. It would just make it more complicated if she moved from her place as Teacher Shan could come to her location any time soon.</p>
<p>With nothing to do, she prompted herself to hunt pheasants by herself.</p>
<p>When the hours passed and there was still no sign of her teacher, she finally decided to go home.</p>
<p>But as soon as she mounted her horse, she saw a familiar figure at the intersection…</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan seemed to be looking for someone and when his eyes found her, they turned cold.</p>
<p><i>Why is Mo Rongzhan here?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart leaped in panic and she instantly froze.</p>
<p><i>Is he here because Mo Rongyi?</i> <i>Should I dismount and pay my respects?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen hesitated, she was not willing to bow to this person. However, now that he was the emperor high above and her, only a small official’s daughter, she must be as humble as a worm in the presence of salt.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan wasted no time and approached Ye Zhen. Mounting his horse, he was able to reach Ye Zhen quickly.</p>
<p>“Did you save the prince?” Mo Rongzhan looked at her with his burning gaze.</p>
<p>Today he could really see the woman’s face clearly. She was even better looking than he thought. The fragrant and delicate jade appeared more tantalizing under the shade of the bright sun.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen couldn’t look at him straight, instead, her eyes cast down, seeing the rope in his hands in the process. She immediately understood- it was the knot!</p>
<p>That’s the way her father taught her to bind. When she had saved him with the roots, she tied them using the same knot.</p>
<p>“I’m asking you something!” Mo Rongzhan said coldly, looking straight at her face.</p>
<p>“Yes…” Ye Zhen whispered, her throat a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>She had been married to him for two years, her soul stayed beside him for two years, but their first conversation turned out to be like this.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan took the rope in his hand. “Who taught you to tie this knot?”</p>
<p>He let some people investigate her, the woman in front of him had really never been to the capital, so she couldn’t be the girl he was looking for.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head gently. “I don’t remember.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan dismounted and came closer to Ye Zhen step by step.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen felt that she was safe atop her horse, Mo Rongzhan pulled her off her horse- his large hand grasped her waist until she stood on the ground with him looking down on her.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask you for the last time. Who taught you to tie this knot?”</p>
<p>“Replying to the emperor, this miss knew many people back in the border town. The person who taught me, I already forgot who it was.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bowed her head and did not look at his beautiful face. Her heart was not as calm as what could be deemed on the surface. This was the man she had loved for eight years and the man she scorned now.</p>
<p>She felt hurt and sad at this time because the softest and best memory in her heart no longer existed, and the teenager she had once been… had died in the memory of Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her coldly. He had a lot of questions which bud from his suspicion – <i>Lu Wushuang did not rescue him at the beginning. Why did she know everything except the secret code? </i>Why did she have the jade pendant?</p>
<p><i>The Lu Family also has a girl named Yaoyao. Is this a coincidence or, is someone deliberately playing with me?</i></p>
<p><i>Lu Wushuang! </i></p>
<p>Mo RongZhan suddenly woke up.</p>
<p><i>Why did he bother to find Lu Yaoyao? Lu Wushuang must know everything, he just needed to make her tell the truth.</i></p>
<p>Looking at the timid woman in front of him, he couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“Do you know a woman named Yaoyao?”</p>
