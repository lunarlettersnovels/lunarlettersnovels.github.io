            <p><strong>Chapter 396 – Abandoned As Taoist Nun</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s handsome mien was cold as ice. He looked at Lu Lingzhi indifferently,  and then at Ye Zhen standing behind him. He said straight ahead, “I will abandon Lu Wushuang as a Taoist nun, and tomorrow I will send her to Nianci Temple, to be kept company by Qingdeng.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s face at the moment was not only of shock. He looked at Mo Rongzhan in disbelief. <em>Abandon Shuang’er … as Taoist nun? It’s already cruel enough for Shuang’er to lose favor. How could the emperor have the heart to do such a thing to Shuang’er?</em></p>
<p>“Lingzhi, it’s I who Lu Wushuang almost killed!” Mo Rongzhan said. If Xu Huiru had not consumed the blood bird’s nest first, it would have been him who would be poisoned at this time.</p>
<p>At the emperor’s words, Lu Lingzhi could no longer utter his words of pleading.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at Lu Lingzhi inquisitively. <em>If he dares to plead for Lu Wushuang, he must know the whereabouts of the Little Yaoyao. This matter would have something to do with Lu Lingzhi.</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this official was not able to teach one’s younger sister.” Lu Lingzhi lowered his head. Now that the emperor had decided, it was useless for him to plead for mercy. What shocked him the most was… <em>How did the emperor know that Shuang’er was not his savior? If the emperor didn’t know the truth, he wouldn’t treat Shuang’er like this…</em></p>
<p>“You have nothing to do with this matter. You’re still hurt. Rise and speak,” Mo Rongzhan said.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi kowtowed, and then slowly stood up. “Your Majesty, this humble servant has a favor to ask.”</p>
<p>“If you wish to see Shuang’er, you can’t do it today. Zhen shall only allow anyone to see her once she repents,” Mo Rongzhan said lightly.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi forced a smile, bitter in his heart. “Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan rubbed his fingertips* and ordered, “Go back and rest.”</p>
<p>[*Basically it’s the index finger rubbing the thumb in a clenched fist when one is thinking hard. Yup, translate that!!!]</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this official shall excuse oneself.” Lu Lingzhi’s heart was filled with disappointment. He knew very well that Lu Wushuang was unlikely to return to this palace in this life.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who was silent all along, lowered her head, wanting to withdraw from the imperial study with Lu Lingzhi. However, before she could take two steps, she heard Mo Rongzhan saying, “Yaoyao, Imperial Mother was shocked by the recent news this evening. Go to the Cining Palace and accompany her.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen halted her footsteps and looked to see him with a frown.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s countenance did not change the slightest, still cold and indifferent. “Fude, see Marquis Anyang out of the palace.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty,” Eunuch Fu bowed his head and answered.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked at Ye Zhen for a moment. At last, he said softly, “Yaoyao, go to Cining Palace to accompany Her Highness the Empress Dowager. By the way…” <em>Ask for a favor on behalf of Shuang’er.</em> Unfortunately, Lu Lingzhi couldn’t utter those words anymore.</p>
<p>Seeing Lu Lingzhi leave, Ye Zhen could only say to Mo Rongzhan, “Your Majesty, then I’ll take my leave to Cining Palace.”</p>
<p>“Do you not worry that Zhen may be poisoned?” Mo Rongzhan let out a sigh and smiled. He walked towards her to hold her hand. “How could you follow and come to the palace late at night?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sprang his big palm and said in a low voice, “Didn’t Lu Wushuang say that I sent those blood bird’s nests to Xianfei Xu? Grandmother was worried that I was involved. She asked me to come into the palace to explain.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan snorted coldly. “Do you think I will allow Lu Wushuang to just make use of you in taking the blame? She thought of such a stupid way.”</p>
<p>“You… really mean to abandon her?” Ye Zhen was somewhat hesitant to believe. In her two years of wandering in the palace, Lu Wushuang was the only one favored in the inner palace. Now that it’s just the beginning of her plans, Mo Rongzhan meant to abandon Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>“If you care about someone who wants to harm you, you better care about me.” Mo Rongzhan stood beside her, looking down at her face.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her head, looked at him, and said grumpily, “Didn’t you say Xianfei Xu ate the blood bird’s nest for you? What could be wrong with you?”</p>
<p><em>He has the leisure to go to Xu Huiru to eat those blood bird’s nest, what else could be wrong with him?</em></p>
<p>“You really don’t care about Zhen at all,” he said helplessly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen snorted. “I shall now go to Cining Palace to accompany Empress Dowager. His Imperial Majesty should go to Xianfei, which is only right.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan immediately grabbed her by the wrist and held her in his arms. “Zhen just went to see Xianfei. Are you so unhappy about that?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, where do you see that I’m unhappy?” She said grumpily, “Let me go!”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother has fallen asleep. You will wake her up if you go.” He whispered in her ear, “Zhen wants you to accompany me, not Empress Dowager.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glared at him angrily. “Mo Rongzhan! How can you be so mean!”</p>
<p>His thin lips floated a little smile. “If not, when will Zhen be able to see you?”</p>
<p>“You…!” Ye Zhen stared at him, huffing with rage.</p>
<p>“Zhen won’t do anything to you. Just talk with me,” he said in a low voice, but his eyes were fixed on her pink lips.</p>
<p>“There are so many women in your harem. Anyone can talk with you.” Ye Zhen’s cheeks turned slightly red, she recalled how Xu Huiru was still a virgin.</p>
<p><em>Did he not let those concubines sleep with him since he expanded the harem? All this time, has he been… Enduring?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes became gloomy. He lowered his head and said hoarsely, “I want to hear you speak.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wanted to ask him about Xu Huiru, but it’s not appropriate. “Then, let’s play <em>Go</em>!”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have anything else to ask me?” Mo Rongzhan asked, with a frown on his face.</p>
<p>“Ask what?” Ye Zhen frowned and thought for a moment. “Was Xianfei Xu really poisoned?”</p>
