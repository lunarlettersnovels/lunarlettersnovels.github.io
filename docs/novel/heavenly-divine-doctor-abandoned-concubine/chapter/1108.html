            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 220 – Filthy Kiss (1)</strong></p>
<p>Since the moment Eunuch Ford had appeared, Ye Zhen was dispirited. She could think on her toes to glean the purpose of his visit and it was precisely why she was miffed.</p>
<p>Today, of all her time being here, she had not seen even a shadow of that man. It was such a happy day… She’d thought, if ever they met, the most she would do was greet and be done with him.</p>
<p>And yet… her she was…</p>
<p>Ah, fate had an eerie way to things. Or, was it simply that enemies were bound to meet on a narrow path?</p>
<p>She schooled her thoughts and expression, opened the door, and walked in with her head held low.</p>
<p>“This official’s daughter greets the emperor.” Ye Zhen tightly pursed her pink lips and curtsied.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan sneered, he could see right through her.</p>
<p>“Every time you pay your respects, you are so reluctant. You had better not pay respects at all,” he said, sarcastically.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, paying no respect at all seems very impolite. Others would say that this official’s daughter is disrespectful.” Ye Zhen solemnly replied.</p>
<p><em>Does she really not want to pay respects?!</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was angered and amused at the same time. This darn girl was truly unlike any other, he just couldn’t read her.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, do you think I really dare not punish you for such insolence?” He demanded, looking right at her with a piercing gaze.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, you are the emperor of this country. If you want this official’s daughter to die, she will have to die. However, this official’s daughter is no one’s servant. One cannot just punish me as one pleases.” Ye Zhen unwaveringly reasoned.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan wore a mysterious smile, his thoughts imperceptible. “Lu Yaoyao, you have a lot of courage.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen cocked her head and thought for a moment. “I fear death, so I cannot be regarded as courageous,” she said flatly.</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mo Rongzhan felt despise towards her indifference. The image from when he had seen her the first time at the hot spring flitted past his mind. How she was flustered, shy… she had fled like she had seen a monster. The ‘her’ now was a stark contrast to the ‘her’ then. A stark contrast to the impression he had formed of her. Was this indeed her real temperament? Unconcerned and cold?</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen saw the faint smile on Mo Rongzhan’s lips, she could sense his malicious intent. She took a step back.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, if you have no other orders, then this official’s daughter will take her leave.”</p>
<p>“I have reservations.” Mo Rongzhan slowly stood up and started walking towards Ye Zhen, his gaze never leaving her once.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid this official’s daughter cannot help with His Majesty’s reservations.” Ye Zhen coldly replied. She felt uneasy with a pair of spiteful eyes staring at her.</p>
<p>“Every woman over the age of thirteen in this country must take part in the Xiunu selection. Lu Yaoyao, why are you not in the Xiunu?”</p>
<p>By now he had stopped right in front of Ye Zhen and in an instant, stretched out his hand and held her chin.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s entire body froze. She had never anticipated this move. For a moment, she went blank, even so, she never once averted her gaze from him.</p>
<p>“This official’s daughter was so ugly before that the county’s elders did not take notice of her. Naturally, one couldn’t be a Xiunu.”</p>
<p>She had long prepared this reply, in case the empress dowager had pointed out. What the mother had not bothered with, the son was very interested in.</p>
<p>“In that case, I will add you to the list of Xiunu.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan smiled cruelly. He was especially pleased as Ye Zhen’s face turned pale at his words.</p>
<p>“Are you foolishly happy?” He jibed.</p>
<p><em>Such a fool! </em>Ye Zhen cursed him in her heart. Only by taking a deep breath could she calm her ire somewhat. “Your Majesty, this is against the rules.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan loosened his grip on her chin and sneered. “I am the rule.” He provoked her.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this official’s daughter does not want to be a Xiunu!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gnashed her teeth. How could she not know what the man was thinking? He was doing it on purpose! He clearly knew that she wanted to become a physician. If she became a Xiunu, she wouldn’t be able to go to the medical academy. He wanted to clip her wings even before they were even formed.</p>
<p><em>What a sadist!</em></p>
<p>“Why is that?” Mo Rongzhan asked, feigning ignorance. He wanted to see how far he could push her, what her limit was… her breaking point. He wanted to see her whole facade crumble, to see who she was out and out.</p>
<p>How she wished to smash his head right this instance, to rip apart that face and mouth that seemed so innocent. Even so, she concealed her intentions behind a plain veneer.</p>
<p>“This official’s daughter grew up in a border town as a child. She was uncouth and ignorant of any rules. If this official’s daughter becomes a Xiunu, she would be a laughing stock. Your Majesty, I beseech you, for the sake of our ancestors, do not let the Lu Family lose face.” Ye Zhen replied.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan stared vacantly at Ye Zhen, listening to her myriad pretexts to refuse him. After all, she had made it amply clear she didn’t want to be his woman. In fact, a part of him that he had chosen to ignore in that moment of recklessness, knew his provocations would end up in vain. She would cleverly slip past him while firmly holding on to her mask. Perhaps, he was eager to see this side of her and hence went ahead, nevertheless…</p>
