            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 368 – Crazy Horse on the Field (1)</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s shoulder was injured, and he was unable to play the game any longer. Hence, his team now lacked a commander, the leader of the team. When they were discussing who to choose to replace Mo Rongyi as the commander, they saw someone wearing their team’s clothes coming to be the substitute.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that…”</p>
<p>Some people were stunned, especially several of Mo Rongyi’s companions who had met Ye Zhen before. Hence, they all froze at the sight of Ye Zhen wearing the clothes that their team used for this competition.</p>
<p>“I’ll play on Ah Yi’s behalf in the next game. All of you still need to stick to your original positions and beat those little bastards up until they are in a sorry state!” Ye Zhen said, enduring her anger until she could unleash it at her target.</p>
<p>She had been watching the game attentively and was already quite angry with what she saw. Her anger stemmed from her observation. She had noticed that those people Prince Shun brought with him when they were playing with the ball, had always intentionally or unintentionally swung their staff in Mo Rongyi’s direction. Two of them even managed to land a hit on his leg. How could it not enrage those who saw it?</p>
<p>“Yes!” The team’s morale was boosted upon Ye Zhen’s words</p>
<p>“So what if they are the children from imperial clans? Don’t tell me that you can still use your identity when you’re on the battlefield? You and I need to be resolute when we beat them. After all, when they can hurt the little prince by accident, don’t tell me that we can’t beat them to death by mistake! As long as they dare to approach and knock against us, call me. I’ll immediately hit them back!” Ye Zhen said coldly.</p>
<p>This claim immediately stunned everyone, they couldn’t help but think… <em>It turns out that the princess is this bold! With a princess like this, we won’t have to take a beating on top of our horsebacks.</em></p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Satisfied with their responses, Ye Zhen deftly jumped and mounted the horse and said, “Get on your horses!”</p>
<p>At this time, Mo Rongzhan abruptly stood up and stared at the slender figure that had just appeared on the field. After all, no matter what kind of clothes she wore or what she disguised herself as, he could still recognize her at a glance.</p>
<p><em>How dare she go down there and join the game?! What will I do if she got hurt?!</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, who is the man playing for Ah Yi down there? He looks familiar.” Empress Dowager asked Mo Rongzhan as she could not see who it was clearly.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother.” At this time, Mo Rongyi, supported by someone, came before Empress Dowager and greeted her.</p>
<p>Empress Dowager’s attention was immediately drawn to her little son. She then hurriedly asked him to sit next to her before she inquired about his injury.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mo Rongzhan dared not divert his eyes from the field even for a single moment.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was a contrast to Mo Rongyi’s conservative playing style. Instead of being defensive, she immediately launched an attack as soon as she got onto the polo field. She gently nudged the stirrup with her left foot and held her staff in the air with her right hand and swung, as fast as a dragon, catching the ball.</p>
<p>The <em>Qibao </em>ball was then thrown up as high as a person’s height, followed by a stroke with her left hand then a hard swing with her right. Not afraid that her move would hurt the Prince Shun nearby, she directly hit the polo, sending the ball flying into the goal net with power so immense that it went straight into the goal.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Prince Shun to recover, she immediately sent two people charging forward and grabbed back the ball.</p>
<p>Within less than a quarter of an hour, they had managed to tie the score.</p>
<p>It was 3-3 now!</p>
<p>It was finally time for a break. While taking the time to rest, Prince Shun cast a gloomy gaze at Ye Zhen. He had never seen this boy before. Furthermore, he also looked as weak as a girl. So, how could this kind of kid manage to play polo that boldly?</p>
<p>“Who is that kid leading them?” Prince Shun asked the person next to him in a low voice.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I have never seen him before, Eighth Brother. However, he seems to be better than the little prince who is as weak as a chicken.” The person who spoke was a child of the Imperial Clan Mo as well as a follower of Prince Shun. His name was Mo Huaide.</p>
<p>As Prince Shun looked at Ye Zhen coldly, he asked, “Do you know how much pay-out ratio the gambling house is setting for this game now?”</p>
<p>“Our odds to win is 1:2, while Mo Rongyi’s 1:10. Eighth Brother, if that kid wins, I’m afraid that our gambling house will…”</p>
<p>The largest gambling house in the capital was a business secretly set up by Prince Shun. And this time, in order to earn more silver, he had encouraged Mo Rongyi to compete with him in polo.</p>
<p>Honestly, if it had been two hours ago, he wouldn’t have cared whether he won or lost this game. In fact, he had even planned to lose to Mo Rongyi on purpose. However, not long ago, someone suddenly bet one hundred thousand taels of silver on Mo Rongyi’s win. Moreover, many people knew about this particular bet, so they thought the person had received some inside info, leading them to raise their bets on Mo Rongyi as well.</p>
