<p>“Ah, I know that my daughter will not disappoint you.” Pei Shi said, grateful that someone of impressive academic credibility was to assist her daughter.</p>
<p>Having been her friend, Ye Zhen knew that Teacher Shan was a born tactician, she didn’t invest time in people whom she knew would not be worthy of it. Also, she never came out empty-handed.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Pei Shi, <i>did she promise her wealth?</i> But there were families in the capital who could offer her thrice as much gold the Lu Family could provide!</p>
<p>Teacher Shan threw a fleeting look in Ye Zhen’s direction and nodded her head lightly. “Third Miss Lu looks smart. I can tell that it will not be difficult to teach her.”</p>
<p>Even Pei Shi couldn’t say that her daughter looked smart, but one thing was for sure, books were her enemy.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bowed her head, acting obedient. The only person who knew her best in the world after her father and brother was Teacher Shan, who had accompanied her for the longest time in the years before she became the Wang Fei of the Qin Dynasty.</p>
<p>After a few more words were exchanged, Teacher Shan was personally escorted to Yaoyao’s study.</p>
<p>On the way, Pei Shi whispered to Ye Zhen. “Yaoyao, it will be tough being a student of Teacher Shan. Even if it is hard, you have to grit your teeth and endure it.”</p>
<p>“Well, Mother I will.”</p>
<p>And she would. This was her only chance. She didn’t want to miss it. Failing to enter the academy meant misfiring of her revenge and at the same time, tarnishing her sister’s reputation.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the study, Pei Shi left the two alone for she had other things to do in her courtyard.</p>
<p>Inside, Teacher Shan looked at Ye Zhen, straight and upright as if she wanted to find someone’s shadow through her face.</p>
<p>“Teacher?” Ye Zhen held her breath for a second, afraid that Teacher Shan would recognize her, though it was impossible.</p>
<p>“Have you lived in a border town since you were a child?” Teacher Shan’s eyes suddenly became sharp.</p>
<p>The girl looked too much like her former student, except for some distinct difference, she was not at the least, a replica of her deceased student, Ye Zhen. She almost thought that Lu Yaoyao was indeed Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Maintaining a cool countenance, Ye Zhen replied. “Yes, Teacher, I have lived in the border town since I was born.”</p>
<p>Noticing the books arranged on the shelves, she asked, “And what have you learned?”</p>
<p>Teacher Shan’s face was indifferent, but her heart was in a storm.</p>
<p><i>What on earth was her master thinking?</i> It was he who had told her to consider the idea of being a teacher to Ye Zhen before and now, he let her grant Pei Shi’s request that she come to teach this little girl of the Lu Family.</p>
<p>Originally, she wondered whether her master knew the Lu Family or not. She only knew that Master was truly acquainted with the Ye Family.</p>
<p><i>Lu Yaoyao… Ye Zhen… What is their relationship?</i></p>
<p>“Aside from my mother’s medical teachings, I have also studied <i><a href="https://www.chinasage.info/1000character-classic.htm">The Thousand Character Classic</a><sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup></i> and Biographies of Exemplary Women.”</p>
<p>This was what Lu Yaoyao had learned, but probably Lu Yaoyao did not like reading such books, so she didn’t learn much at all.</p>
<p>“What’s the use of learning those when surviving the academy has become a matter of women’s competence in the Six Arts… Don’t you have any talent to master?” Teacher Shan frowned and asked.</p>
<p>The prerequisite to enter the Academy for Women was to pass the entrance examination on the six fundamental abilities: rites, music, archery, equestrianism, calligraphy, and arithmetic.</p>
<p>If one failed to execute at least one of these, one definitely couldn’t set foot inside the academy. For Ye Zhen, this wasn’t a problem as she had passed this exam before. But for Lu Yaoyao, it was very difficult for sure.</p>
<p>“Please teach me, Teacher.” Ye Zhen curtsied and showed great respect.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan lowered her eyes and looked at her for a moment before uttering in a resolute voice. “Write me a few words.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded, went to the bookcase, and picked up the sheep hairbrush beside it. She was at first hesitant to scribble on the sheet of paper spread in front of her. Gripping the brush tightly and with her brows creased, she wrote the phrase that first came to her mind in shaky strokes.</p>
<p><i>Clothes might change, but people do not.</i></p>
<p>Those words reminded Teacher Shan of when she had first met her student in the Spring and Autumn, images from the past flashed before her very eyes</p>
