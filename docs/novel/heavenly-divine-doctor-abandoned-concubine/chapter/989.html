            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 340 – Residual Toxin (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Ye Zhen?” Lu Lingzhi was a little confused. When he opened his eyes and saw a familiar face, he was so nervous that he blurted out <em><strong>her</strong></em> name.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes were slightly cold and she said faintly, “Eldest Brother, you mistook one for another.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi let go of her hand and smiled gently. “Yaoyao, why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I heard that you were injured. Grandmother was worried, so she let me and Father come see you.” Ye Zhen looked at him and said, “Who hurt you? You are not easily defeated in martial arts. How could you be hurt so easily? ”</p>
<p>“I don’t know … it doesn’t look like a close confidant of the Prince of the West, but the person was wearing their clothes. The dead man was the former bodyguard of the Prince of West. The one who hurt me was injured by me and has been arrested.” Lu Lingzhi looked at Ye Zhen with a smile. “Yaoyao, Eldest Brother didn’t expect you to come see me.”</p>
<p><em>If it weren’t for the old madam, why would she want to come here?</em> “Grandmother is very worried about you.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a minor injury, let Grandmother not worry,” Lu Lingzhi whispered.</p>
<p>“You are poisoned,” Ye Zhen said, “can I take a look at your wound?”</p>
<p>It was only now that Lu Lingzhi realized he had been holding her wrist. “The wound is terrible. How will you look at it, little girl?”</p>
<p>He let go of her hand, and his eyes fell on the face before him. Just now, he had really regarded her as Ye Zhen. Unexpectedly, it had been so long since he remembered her.</p>
<p><em>Is it because of the guilt that cannot be forgotten?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen had been studying about detoxification recently. She was just curious about what poison he had. “I am a student of medicine, why can’t I see it?”</p>
<p>“I heard that you are already Princess Fu Rong, and you are still studying medicine.” Lu Lingzhi said with a smile, “A princess is incomparable to a female physician.”</p>
<p>“It seems like you look down upon medical women.” Ye Zhen curled her lips. “I want to become a physician. Even if I have the title of a princess now, I still want to practice medicine.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was amused by her anger and coughed gently. “<em>Cough</em> … I don’t look down upon physicians. Don’t get me wrong.”</p>
<p>Qi Jin and Lu Shiming heard voices and hurried in.</p>
<p>“How do you feel now??” Lu Shiming quickly asked.</p>
<p>“Third Uncle, I am fine.” Lu Lingzhi smiled and saw Ye Zhen standing to one side with her head lowered. When she didn’t even look at him again, he felt an inexplicable loss.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi woke up with much more vigor than the previous night. When his confidants came to see him, they delivered the news of the assassin’s escape.</p>
<p>“At that time, several of us were interrogating the assassin. Suddenly, there was an abrupt sound from another assassin outside. We were afraid of bringing harm upon the marquis and left only a couple of people behind. When we found out that the tiger was descending the mountain*, the people had already been rescued,” Luo You, Lu Lingzhi’s deputy said..</p>
<p>[T/N: it means a diversion]</p>
<p>“It seems that there are still a few fish that have slipped through the net.” Lu Lingzhi sat on the bed. “I know the assassin’s appearance. Portraits of him are to be posted everywhere. He was also seriously injured. He can’t go far. It shouldn’t be difficult to find him. At this time, he should still be with his companions. If you find him, you can find the rest of them.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was boiling medicine by the door. When she heard these words, she was itching to cripple Lu Lingzhi’s hands, so that he couldn’t draw a portrait of Tian Jiu.</p>
<p>Imperial Physician Qi was a diligent doctor and seldom trusted her work with others. Ye Zhen was an exception though. Since the girl was here, the physician handed her the medicine herbs together with the wound dressing supplies and immersed herself in the study of purging the residual poison.</p>
<p>“Marquis, I’ll draw as you say,” Lu Lingzhi’s aide said.</p>
<p>“Very well!” Lu Lingzhi nodded and asked someone to get the brush and ink. The man then started to draw as Lu Lingzhi described the assassin that escaped.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since Ye Zhen had seen Tian Jiu, she only had a faint impression about him now. As she listened to Lu Lingzhi’s description, she was not sure if it was him. So, she still needed to see the portrait to know.</p>
<p>“Marquis, is this the person?” The man lifted up the portrait and held it for Lu Lingzhi to see.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s him.” Lu Lingzhi said in a low voice. “Make more copies of the portrait and send them to the capital. The emperor will surely command you to trace them. You should search the vicinity. Don’t let him go far, search everywhere whether in the village or the mountains.</p>
<p>“Yes, Marquis.” The crowd of confidants responded in unison.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen came in with the medicine, and said to Lu Lingzhi with a straight face, “You just woke up. If you don’t cherish your body, don’t even drink the medicine.”</p>
<p>“How dare you speak to the Marquis that way?” Others didn’t know that Ye Zhen was Lu Lingzhi’s sister. They thought she’s just a little medical girl. Luo You immediately reprimanded her.</p>
