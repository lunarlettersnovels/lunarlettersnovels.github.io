            <p><strong>Chapter 416 – Be My Empress (1)</strong></p>
<p>“There was also Mister Chen, apart from me.” Ye Zhen lowered her head, feeling this was odd. Shouldn’t the first thing Mo Rongzhan do when he awoke was deal with the matters of the nation? Whatever it may be, he should at least see the officials of the inner court. If not, shouldn’t he keep Tang Zhen behind and ask about the investigations in the hunting forests?</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan saw that she kept her head down looking away from him, and sighed inwardly. He had thought that, through this matter, she would open up the knot in her heart and accept him. It looked now that… she still had not. She was still harboring the grievance that he had once hurt Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, come over here,” Mo Rongzhan said quietly.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, do you have any orders for me?” Ye Zhen didn’t move, unwilling to go near him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked up to flatly look at her. “I saved you, but not for you to distance yourself from me even more. Are you afraid that I might do something to you? Come here!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked up at him. Seeing that he showed signs of anger, she could only slowly move over. “Your injuries are not well yet. Don’t get angry.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan held her hand, pulling her to sit at his side. “Talk to me.”</p>
<p>“You’ve been unconscious for two days. Should I get you something to eat?” Ye Zhen said quietly. She was more scared of facing him now than she had been before.</p>
<p>“Make it for me,” Mo Rongzhan said to her with a smile. She had never made a meal for him herself before.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips and thought before saying, “All right. Wait a moment.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao.” Mo Rongzhan grasped her hand tightly, but when he wanted to pull her into his embrace, he accidentally moved the injuries on his back, and the pain made him groan audibly.</p>
<p>“Can you not move so much?” Ye Zhen hurriedly sat down, inspecting to see if the injuries on his back had opened again.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s lips curved into a smile, taking the opportunity to kiss her pink lips.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pushed him away with a blush, glaring at him with frustration. “Mo Rongzhan, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“That was the first thing I wanted to do when I woke up.” Mo Rongzhan locked the back of her head, pushing her towards himself, blocking her lips with a deep kiss again.</p>
<p>When he was dreaming, the thing he thought of most had been the taste of her. Only she could comfort that terror he had felt in his dreams like he had been falling into a deep abyss.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pushed at his chest. If it weren’t for the fact that she was afraid of his wounds ripping open, she would have already pushed him away heavily. Finally getting the opportunity of freedom now that he let go of her from the pain in his shoulder, she immediately stood up to back up a couple of steps.</p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan, I am your imperial sister,” Ye Zhen said angrily. He was really treating her with evermore unscrupulousness.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I want you to be my empress,” Mo Rongzhan said softly. Because of his words, his eyes were burning bright. When he had faced the tiger in the hunting forests, he had had this intent. She was probably the only one on this earth that could be his Empress.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s expression changed. She didn’t feel happy. Instead, there was cold grief that rising from deep inside her heart. <em>How could he so casually speak about wanting to make her Empress…</em></p>
<p>“I’ll go make some medicated food for you,” Ye Zhen said quietly. She suddenly didn’t want to see him.</p>
<p>In the two years of her memory, he had never married any woman as Empress. But he had changed now. He would say that he wanted to make her Empress? In the future, if he knew who she was, wouldn’t he think that it was really ridiculous?</p>
<p>As he watched her fleeing back, Mo Rongzhan didn’t say anything, only smiling lightly, and feeling ever more determined about his idea.</p>
<p>“Come in,” he said lowly.</p>
<p>A man immediately appeared outside the door. Dressed in athletic wear, his clothes were the same as Shen Yi’s. And like Shen Yi, this person was also one of Mo Rongzhan’s secret guards.</p>
<p>“What happened in these past two days?” Mo Rongzhan asked quietly.</p>
<p>Normally, Mo Rongzhan would always have his secret guards guarding him at all times. However, when he was headed to the hunting grounds since it was in the imperial grounds, he had only brought palace guards along while the secret guards had not followed. But who would have known that an accident would occur?</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the eighth prince has spread rumors across the capital that something has happened to you. There have already been people from the imperial branches in these past two days that have gone to see the deposed emperor, but… He hasn’t seen them,” Wu Chong said quietly.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes slightly darkened, a coldness flashing across their depths. “What has happened in the court?”</p>
<p>“There are many that have communicated with the eighth prince.” Wu Chong stated every single one of their names.</p>
<p>“It seems that there are some that can’t wait for me to die in their hands.” Mo Rongzhan smiled coldly. “Spread the word that I am already on my deathbed, and the position of the heir is unoccupied… perhaps there is a necessity to choose from within the princes for the next successor.”</p>
<p>Wu Chong looked at Mo Rongzhan with surprise. “Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
