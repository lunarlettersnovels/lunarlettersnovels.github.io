            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 237 – Target (2)</strong></p>
<p>“I’m simply discussing the matter as it is,” Qi Jin said, unfazed by the accusation.</p>
<p>“Since Imperial Physician Qi likes to discuss things, then let’s discuss certain matters.” In waltzed a woman of about the same rank as Qi Jin. Behind her, was Su Xinmei.</p>
<p>This woman was another imperial physician. Although her rank was below Qi Jin’s, she had always been conceited, never once acknowledging the other’s position. This had created a chasm between them and neither woman had bothered with it.</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Huang, why are you here?” Qi Jin raised her eyebrows and asked. <em>Physician Huang is not teaching in the School of Medicine. She is not in the palace. Why did she show up here at the academy?</em></p>
<p>“Fortunately, I managed to come over here today. Otherwise, I wouldn’t know how Imperial Physician Qi would deal with my niece,” Imperial Physician Huang said, coldly. She was of a slender build, and erect posture. She wore a look of perpetual indifference and looked at everyone with conceited eyes.</p>
<p>Qi Jin smiled. “How could I dispute with a <em>xiǎo bèi</em>*? However… I don’t think she is suited to remain in the academy.”</p>
<p>[T/N: xiǎo bèi- junior or the younger generation]</p>
<p>“Ha, ha, then who is suited to remain? That <em><strong>Lu Yaoyao</strong></em> you mentioned? A student who destroyed the most precious glasshouse in the School of Medicine… such a student is suited to stay? Imperial Physician Qi, how just you are!” Imperial Physician Huang sneered.</p>
<p>“Physician Huang, what do you mean? What happened to the glasshouse?” The headmaster asked in a trice.</p>
<p>Su Xinmei greeted him with a bow and said in a low voice, “Headmaster, today Imperial Physician Huang came to take the fire lotus flower. When we went to the glasshouse, we found that all the herbs in it were uprooted. Even if we are to replant them, I’m afraid it’s hopeless.”</p>
<p>The headmaster stood up, his wrinkled face flushed with anger. “Who dared do it? It’s a capital offense to bring damage to the precious herb in the glasshouse!”</p>
<p>Qi Jin calmly looked at Su Xinmei. “There are only three keys to the glasshouse. One is in my hand, the other in the hands of Teacher Su, and the last one is in the hands of Master Qin. Teacher Su, who did you say brought damage to the glasshouse?”</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, a student heard that Master Qin gave the key to Lu Yaoyao,” Su Xinmei said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Therefore, you’re trying to say that Lu Yaoyao did it?” Qi Jin chuckled. “How do you know she has the key?”</p>
<p>“Whether she has it or not, just let her come and we shall find out,” Imperial Physician Huang coldly said.</p>
<p>“Summon Lu Yaoyao.” The headmaster immediately ordered.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had long surmised that an incident such as today would not be enough to frighten a seasoned bully like Huang Fuxiang. She was not afraid of Huang Fuxiang making a din, nor was the Huang Family someone she couldn’t afford to provoke. Even if she did make a scene, the Huang Family was not as powerful as the Lu Family.</p>
<p>When she arrived at the headmaster’s office, several pairs of eyes were fixed on her, unfazed she walked in. The woman, particularly the one standing in front of Huang Fuxiang was staring at Ye Zhen as if sieving through her.</p>
<p>“Are you Lu Yaoyao?” The headmaster looked at Ye Zhen, a pair of heavy gray eyebrows wrinkled up. “Are you the one who shot an arrow and hurt Huang Fuxiang?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bowed respectfully. “Headmaster, I luckily survived and lost control of my bow and arrow out of anger. Miss Huang, on the other hand, somehow shot an arrow aiming at my back. <em>That</em> is just inexplicable.” She stood straight, neither humble nor haughty.</p>
<p>“You did it on purpose!” Huang Fuxiang pointed to Ye Zhen and cried.</p>
<p>“Are you not the one who aimed at my back on purpose?” Ye Zhen countered.</p>
<p>“No! How would I know I’ll shoot you,” Huang Fuxiang boldly said.</p>
<p>Qi Jin looked at her sternly. “Didn’t you just say you didn’t shoot an arrow at Lu Yaoyao’s back?”</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang turned pale and turned to look at Madam Huang hastily.</p>
<p>“This matter in archery can be put aside for the time being. The most important matter now is the destruction of the glasshouse. Lu Yaoyao, why did you destroy the herbs in the glasshouse?” Imperial  Physician Huang said coldly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Physician Huang in surprise. “I cannot enter the glasshouse, how can I destroy the herbs inside?”</p>
<p>“You liar! How can you not get in when you have a key?” Su Xinmei immediately asked.</p>
<p>“I… I don’t have the key.” Ye Zhen was a picture of innocence.</p>
<p>She wasn’t lying. She really didn’t have the key to the glasshouse. Early that morning, she had returned it to Master Qin.</p>
