            <h3>Chapter 112 – Tsundere (2)</h3>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi took her hand and said, “If we can’t break his board game, we can’t break it. Even if I am not his student, I can still get a title. Don’t burden yourself.”</p>
<p>“Brother, I don’t feel burdened at all.” Ye Zhen knew Lu Xiangzhi misunderstood and explained with a smile. “I have broken the board game!”</p>
<p>“What?” Lu Xiangzhi cried in surprise. <i>Did he mishear?</i></p>
<p>Xu Lao snorted coldly while looking at Lu Xiangzhi up and down.</p>
<p>“Is this the boy who wanted to be my student? Hmph! I forbid it!”</p>
<p>In a split second, Lu Xiangzhi blushed out of embarrassment, feeling like his younger sister lost face just because of him.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said in a delicate voice, “Well, you are not true to your words. If I had known before that you are not trustworthy, I would have beaten you to pieces.”</p>
<p>Xu Lao stared at her. “Little Miss, don’t talk so highly of yourself! I am the one who let you win!” Xu Lao slightly rose from his seat, his ire in full view.</p>
<p>“I disdain to lie, Lord Xu. Trust me when I say I was the one who let <i>yo</i>u win, not the other way around.” Ye Zhen contradicted with a determined air.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s go play again!”</p>
<p>Xu Lao glowered and glared at the young miss. He couldn’t believe Ye Zhen didn’t give her all. He had already exerted eight points of his strength and ability! He had won significant victories, but at this moment, he was not a sure winner.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head lightly. “No, that’s all right.”</p>
<p>She picked up a stone and placed it right in the middle. Xu Lao’s guarding stones were suddenly in jeopardy at Ye Zhen’s lethal move. She had few stones in her hand, and in the ensuing attacks, Xu Lao’s defeat was most likely to occur.</p>
<p>The expression on Xu Lao’s face was full of wonder as he stared at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“You…”</p>
<p>“How is it?” Ye Zhen asked smilingly.</p>
<p>“I can accept him as a student, but I have one condition-at your expense,” Xu Lao suddenly said.</p>
<p>A fraction of gratitude showed on her face, Ye Zhen asked with interest, “What condition?”</p>
<p>At the same time, Lu Xiangzhi’s eyes brightened as he clearly knew what it would mean to be a student of Xu Lao. Although he could not bear to let his sister humble herself in front of him, he would be more than grateful to have the opportunity to learn from Xu Lao.</p>
<p>His bottom line was that Yaoyao should not be wronged in any way. And at this moment, his sister looked far from needing his intervention.</p>
<p>However, at the mention of the teacher asking his sister for a condition at her expense was one thing he couldn’t bear.</p>
<p>“No way!” Lu Xiangzhi refused before Xu Lao could say the terms. He turned back to Ye Zhen and said, “Yaoyao, don’t wrong yourself! You don’t need to do this.”</p>
<p><i>Yaoyao?</i></p>
<p>Xu Lao squinted slightly towards the miss who has just been called the familiar nickname…</p>
<p>“Your boudoir’s name is Yaoyao?”</p>
<p><i>Was it the same nickname as Ye Yiqing’s daughter? What a strange coincidence…</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “Yes, my name is Lu Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>“If you are also my student, I can consider accepting your brother,” Xu Lao said.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi’s eyes instantly brightened. This condition was completely acceptable!</p>
<p>“That won’t do. I’m going to take the examination for the School of Medicine tomorrow. I can’t be your student.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen implied that what she wanted to learn in the future was not music, <i>go</i>, calligraphy, and painting, but medical skills. But Xu Lao couldn’t teach her medicine.</p>
<p>Xu Lao’s eyes widened. “Where in damnation are you going to do in the School of Medicine?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen answered calmly. “I have inherited my mother’s mantle, and I plan to exercise it. Lord Xu, I can feel that you are a <i>Tsundere<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup></i>. What’s wrong with my brother? If you accept my brother as a student, I can come here often and play <i>Go</i> with you!”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi coughed softly. He wanted to persuade his sister to promise to be a student of Xu Lao, which was much better than going to the School of Medicine.</p>
<p>The corners of the old man’s mouth slightly lifted up, thinking of the foreign word she just mentioned.</p>
<p><i>Tsundere?</i></p>
<p><i>How many times had his friend called him that? This young miss actually knew the exact word Ye Yiqing used to make fun of him. </i></p>
<p>At first, he didn’t know what it meant. He thought it was a compliment but later realized it wasn’t a compliment at all, but a mockery!</p>
<p><i>Is this still a coincidence?</i></p>
