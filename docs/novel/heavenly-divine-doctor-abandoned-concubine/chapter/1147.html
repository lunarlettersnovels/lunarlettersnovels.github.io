            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 180- Could This Be About Marriage?!</strong></p>
<p>Next was the Etiquette Class.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8"></div>
<p>In the past, there were more students in class A than in class B, and the classes were conducted separately. However, due to the diminishing number of students taking part in the medical school examination each year, the two classes were combined for some courses.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had long been familiar with etiquette and customs, but she still came to class with a devout bearing.</p>
<p>However, today was special. She would be reunited with someone dear to her–Teacher Shan. Ye Zhen had always been grateful to the person who had not only played the role of a teacher and groomed her, but also a friend, even when she was Wang Fei Ye.</p>
<p>She had always felt that in her moments of dire need, Teacher Shan had never failed to come to her aid. Even in her past life.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan’s return to the college drew a lot of attention. Back in the day, she had left a legacy here, needless to say, the students were looking forward to this very day.</p>
<p>Class A and Class B had classes together. Class A had a natural sense of superiority in front of Class B. Thus, one could find Class B already sitting quietly in a corner, making themselves as obscure as possible.</p>
<p>All except Huang Fuxiang who was already chattering endlessly to Gao Xueping. Huang Fuxiang, because of her aunt, had a special standing in the school. Since her aunt was of repute, in the field of medicine at that, no one dared to look down upon her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen and Sun Wen walked into the class together. There was no console table in the class, only a small table for each student. They soon found one for themselves and sat cross-legged.</p>
<p>Their arrival soon caught the attention of Gao Xueping and Huang Fuxiang, they stopped talking and looked at the two who had just walked in, particularly Ye Zhen. Huang Fuxiang sneered, turned to Gao Xueping, and said something, evoking the latter’s smile.</p>
<p>The students were talking amongst themselves, creating a buzzing sound around the room. After a while, with the appearance of Teacher Shan, the class quieted. She ran a light gaze across the whole room. When she got to Ye Zhen however, she did not linger and moved away swiftly.</p>
<p>“I taught all the etiquette and books in the First Grade of this medical school. You can all call me Teacher Shan.” She simply introduced herself.</p>
<p>All the students, in concert, stood up, bowed, and paid their respects.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan acknowledged with a slight nod. “Let us begin.”</p>
<p>“Food and clothing are not enough to know honor and disgrace. However, one’s self-restraint and etiquette are inseparable. A woman should be mindful of etiquette, understand it in order to not appear disrespectful to others, and commit gaffes in society …”</p>
<p>“Today, let’s talk about religious etiquette first.”</p>
<p>Thus, she began her lecture.</p>
<p>Turning to Sun Wen, with a faint smile, Ye Zhen talked about Teacher Shan. Before, she was of the belief that Teacher Shan should be able to evince her value better in the academy. A pity that such a talented woman should only serve as a teacher in the mansion.</p>
<p>“Religious etiquette is one of the five rites of the etiquette art of this country. The ritual activities of offering sacrifices to gods, people, and ghosts, some of which do not require women’s participation, but as a patriarchal clan, the arrangement and etiquette of the sacrifices must be understood. You should practice the ritual less often, which is probably clear long ago … ” Teacher Shan said.</p>
<p>As the lecture progressed, Huang Fuxiang’s mouth twitched. It was not long before she burst into laughter, interrupting Teacher Shan’s words.</p>
<p>“Teacher Shan, we have practiced these customs since young. However, some people may not know.” As she spoke, her gaze on Ye Zhen made it clear who she was alluding to.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan looked at Huang Fuxiang coldly. “If everyone knows, what is the significance of this course? It is only because some people do not understand it. If you think you understand it, you can, by all means, leave the class.”</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang turned white. She did not expect Teacher Shan would be this curt, even telling her to not come to the class.</p>
<p>She was originally going to embarrass Lu Yaoyao, so that everyone would know that Lu Yaoyao was nothing but an empty face. As it turned out, she could do nothing. Moreover, it was beyond her expectation that this Teacher Shan did not answer her, instead, showed her the door.</p>
<p>“Teacher Shan, do we have to learn from the most basic? Is that not a waste of time?” Someone came to Huang Fuxiang’s rescue.</p>
<p>After all, the few had all quietly agreed upon embarrassing Ye Zhen in class.</p>
<p>“If you do not want to learn, do not learn.” Teacher Shan said simply, “My classes will start from the foundation, and you are all welcome to miss them.”</p>
<p>These words immediately blocked those who still wanted to speak. How could they dare offend Teacher Shan? In the future, the teacher would be required to evaluate their scores.</p>
<p>Things were different from what Huang Fuxiang had imagined. She thought that Teacher Shan, like Master Qin, would come up with an examination. With that, they would have a way to humiliate Lu Yaoyao. But in the end, their plans came to a naughtt leaving them no chance to deal with Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Keep going.” Teacher Shan could not be bothered with the lot any more.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang turned to look towards Ye Zhen and glared at her angrily.</p>
<p>But who was Ye Zhen? To think that she could not sniff out their intentions beforehand, would be a gross error. These people were thinking of ways to deal with her and she had been aware all along.</p>
<p><i>This Huang Fuxiang… What exactly is wrong with her? Is it because I won Tang Zhen’s silver whip?</i></p>
<p><i>This is just unbelievable!</i></p>
<p>After class, Ye Zhen originally wanted to catch up with Teacher Shan, but when she stepped out of the classroom, she did not know where the teacher had walked towards.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen saw Huang Fuxiang and Gao Xueping go out together, and did not want to collide with that pugnacious pair. She turned and left first. She did not come to a medical school to bicker with these people. In fact, she really did not need to think to deal with them. Truth be told, these people did not matter to her.</p>
<p>Shortly after returning to the academy, Lu Jing came looking for her.</p>
<p>“Fourth Sister?” Ye Zhen was somewhat surprised. She thought Lu Jing was disgusted with her and would not come looking for her.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, are you used to living here?” Lu Jing came in and took a look at Ye Zhen’s room. She was secretly jealous. She had lived in a dorm before, but she would not want to go home every day if she could live in such a place.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said with a smile, “Living well, still not used to it.”</p>
<p>“In fact, it is also good that Third Sister now lives in the school, so she would not suffer indignities at home.” Lu Jing took a jab at her.</p>
<p><i>Why did she mention the family suddenly?</i></p>
<p>With her head lowered, eyes downcast Ye Zhen was sipping her tea, trying to guess Lu Jing’s reason for visit.</p>
<p><i>Had something happened at the mansion that concerned her?</i></p>
<p>Lu Jing had been waiting for Ye Zhen to raise the question, but even after waiting for a long time, she did not hear her speak. She was not angry. She came here today just to see Ye Zhen’s reaction once she knew what was going on at home. She was certainly not here for tea.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, how many days until you go home?” Lu Jing asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t feel the need to ask Lu Jing of her intention. The woman had come to her in the first place, so she would certainly tell her what had happened at home.</p>
<p>“Ah, Eldest Brother’s mother has suddenly recovered and expressed the desire to take charge of the family again …” Lu Jing glanced at Ye Zhen. “I heard that she had gone to ask Third Aunt about you.”</p>
<p><i>What could Lu Lingzhi’s mother ask Pei Shi?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart suddenly sank.</p>
<p><i>Could this be about marriage?!</i></p>
