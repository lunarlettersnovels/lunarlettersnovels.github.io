<p>Lu Jing simply didn’t want to see Tang Zhen’s things in Ye Zhen’s hands. Thus, she had tried to persuade her, even get on her good side but none of that worked!</p>
<p><i>But now, who could say no to Old Madam?</i></p>
<p>“It turns out that Fourth Sister also likes whips but she couldn’t just ask Third Sister to turn over what she won with great difficulty. So, Eldest Brother will find another silver whip.” Lu Lingzhi’s face, with a warm and jade-like smile, resolutely forbade Lu Jing to make the silver whip as a bargain.</p>
<p>Lu Jing’s face changed slightly as her heart was suddenly filled with disappointment. “It’s all right. I really didn’t want it that much.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her and smiled victoriously.</p>
<p>Seeing the smile in Ye Zhen’s face as some sort of ridicule, she felt livid deep in her heart.</p>
<p>“Since your eldest brother wants to give you a new whip, isn’t that good enough for you?” Old Madam Lu asked, genuinely glad that the matter had settled.</p>
<p>Lu Jing nodded timidly and acted as though she agreed with Lu Lingzhi’s decision.</p>
<p>Soon, Lu Shiming and his wife arrived and the talks of the whips and graduations could no longer be heard.</p>
<p>After greeting the couple, Lu Fang took Chen Qiuping along and went out to breathe some fresh air, finding the political conversations uninteresting. And there, they talked about the academy and nothing else.</p>
<p>Left in the dining hall, Ye Zhen sat still by Pei Shi’s side who was seemingly aware of her daughter’s sudden change. Her daughter had become more beautiful and wore a gentle smile on her face.</p>
<p>Pei Shi couldn’t understand but she suddenly felt worried over her daughter.</p>
<p>On the other side of the table, Lu Shiming had a sincere conversation with his mother, entailing his decision of entering politics.</p>
<p>“… after so many years of neglect, I don’t know if I can adapt to the delay until I find a job in the academician courtyard and finally set foot in its office.”</p>
<p>Joy! The old madam felt only this when she heard of Lu Shiming’s new prospect.</p>
<p>The heavens know how she had suffered with him during the years of his youth! Her youngest son who had topped the imperial exam was cheated, and his name was replaced by the son of a governor! All thanks to the permission of his then eldest brother.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the incident also strained Lu Shiming’s relationship with his eldest brother. No matter how many times Lu Shiming said that all was forgiven, Old Madam Lu could still tell that he still carried the pain.</p>
<p>Poor Old Madam Lu could only witness with a broken heart how her family turned their backs against each other. What broke her heart most was Lu Shiming’s departure followed by the death of her eldest son.</p>
<p>“Good! Your brother will be very happy… I hope you do your very best.”</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing in her life was her young son migrating with hate and regret towards his eldest brother. Now that Lu Shiming’s eldest brother was gone, Old Madam Lu found it consoling to see Lu Shiming reach his dream and thereby, forgiving his brother in the process.</p>
<p>“Mother, you can rest assured that I will.” Lu Shiming laughed and threw occasional glances at his wife.</p>
<p>Pei Shi looked back at Lu Shiming with a gentle smile but felt a trace of bitterness in her heart for some reason.</p>
<p>Every time she looked the other way, Ye Zhen saw sorrow in her eyes. This made her wonder if something happened lately.</p>
<p>Ever since she had woken up in this body, she had been thinking of her revenge and never cared about other people’s affairs.</p>
<p>Deep down in her heart, Pei Shi’s family loved her and cared for her, and even if she had a deep hatred towards the Lu Family, she could not get herself to hate her and Lu Shiming.</p>
<p>She owed them her twin sister’s good life!</p>
<p>With this, Ye Zhen decided to take care of Lu Yaoyao’s adoptive parents.</p>
<p>Brimming with excitement, Old Madam Lu called Lu Lingzhi’s attention. “You should find an imperial secretary job for your uncle at once!”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi, who was thoroughly invested in his meal, nodded when the old madam spoke once more.</p>
<p>“By the way, one of your cousins caught the very attention of Prime Minister Xu. What can you say about that?”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, you don’t have to worry about my own opinion about the marriage of my cousins,” Lu Lingzhi said with a wry smile.</p>
<p>“How long have you been postponing marriage?” Old Madam Lu stared at him. “What about your younger brothers, do you expect them to marry before you?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi pointed to his younger brothers with a smile: “Grandmother, they can find themselves suitable wives before me, I don’t mind getting married after them.”</p>
