<h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 131 – Big Girl (1)</h3>
<p>Ye Zhen was relieved to receive the Letter of Admission from the Academy for Women. She knew that seeking retribution from those who wronged her and her family was a tough plight and the parchment in her hands only served as her first step.</p>
<p>Now, she was no more than an adopted daughter of a newly anointed imperial secretary, thus she must make things possible for herself.</p>
<p>Her object of revenge was Lu Lingzhi and the current wang fei, Lu Wushuang. As for Mo Rongzhan… she could only deal with him when she was fully-fledged. Talking about revenge against him with her current power or the lack thereof, she was undoubtedly a mere egg against a rock.</p>
<p>The Lu Household prepared for Ye Zhen’s trip to the Academy for Women, and Pei Shi was happy to pack the things she wanted her daughter to bring to the academy.</p>
<p>As everyone was busy, Lu Xiangzhi also kept Ye Zhen and his mother busy by chatting with them relentlessly.</p>
<p>At this moment, he was relaying how Princess Liu Hua surrendered Ye Zhen’s silvers.</p>
<p>“Originally, she refused to acknowledge the document but later, when Brother Tang came to my defense, Princess Liu Hu’s face turned green! I don’t think she would dare show her face in the capital for a long time.” Lu Xiangzhi sniggered.</p>
<p>“Why was Tang Zhen there?” Ye Zhen asked at the mention of the young man.</p>
<p>“Brother Tang, who made his bet too, also came to fetch his silvers! Ah, I was really lucky.”</p>
<p>Thinking back to her impoliteness before, she obscurely avoided talking about Tang Zhen by veering the topic. “Did the little prince also go today?”</p>
<p>“No, I heard that Princess Royal went into the palace first thing in the morning to find the empress dowager. The little prince, Mo Rongyi, was then detained in the palace by Her Highness,” Lu Xiangzhi said, reaching for the silvers laid on the nearby table.</p>
<p>“Her daughter had started a gamble and was defeated. Princess Royal should not go to the palace and cry in front of the empress dowager. This—” He ran his fingertips on the silvers.</p>
<p>“—is what my sister has won.”</p>
<p>When Pei Shi heard this, she gazed disapprovingly at her daughter and son. “You two little tyrants, you have offended the princess thoroughly by asking for those silvers. You…! I will talk to your father about this later!”</p>
<p>Giving a sheepish smile towards his mother, Lu Xiangzhi spoke again but with a little nervousness this time.</p>
<p>“If she is offended, then let her be offended… Why did she start a wager in the first place if she is a person who can’t accept defeat?”</p>
<p>Being a protective mother, Pei Shi naturally believed that her children were wrong in doing so as she was worried that fostering hostility with the princess would bring them trouble. Not only that, but Wang Fei Lu could also be put in jeopardy amidst all this.</p>
<p>“I heard that the princess is quite popular with the empress dowager. We cannot bring trouble to your Sister Wang Fei.” Pei Shi warned them.</p>
<p>At the mention of Lu Wushuang, Ye Zhen seemed to dim.</p>
<p>“Mother, did Wang Fei have any nickname when she was a child?” Lu Xiangzhi asked out of the blue.</p>
<p>In return, Pei Shi frowned and shook her head “<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>Shuang’er’s nickname? I remember calling her Da Ya<i><sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="2"><a>2</a></sup></i>… “</p>
<p>“What?!” Lu Xiangzhi laughed, “I never knew Wang Fei had such a nickname!”</p>
<p>Carefully controlling the tone of her voice, in a way that it wouldn’t sound as perturbed about his sudden question, Ye Zhen calmly asked him:</p>
<p>“Why is my brother asking about this?”</p>
<p>“Yesterday, I heard Eldest Brother ask Second Brother this. I don’t remember the wang fei having a nickname.” Lu Xiangzhi answered, completely ignorant of what was going on inside his sister’s head.</p>
<p><i>Lu Lingzhi had to have asked for a reason.</i></p>
<p>She recalled that Mo Rongzhan once asked her in the woods if she knew another person named Yaoyao. He must have suspected that Lu Wushuang was not the one who saved him!</p>
<p>Lu  Wushuang’s nickname could not be Yaoyao, because she already had a cousin with the name, so Mo Rongzhan must now believe that the woman he chose to keep was not the one who saved him.</p>
<p><i>So why still keep Lu Wushuang as his imperial concubine? </i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned, thinking that she had witnessed a lot when her soul was trapped in the imperial palace for two years. Aside from transmigrating into her twin sister’s body, someone she’d never met, she had returned in time- to be precise, a few days after her death.</p>
<p>As a wandering spirit inside the cold walls of the imperial palace, she had speculated that the Jin country was in a period of superficial calm and internal turmoil. She remembered that in the first year of her soul’s entrapment, she often saw Mo Rongzhan in the imperial study discussing countermeasures with his ministers.</p>
<p>It seemed that there were many wars in the Jin country at this time.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sneered mockingly in her heart. She knew that Mo Rongzhan was a very powerful person. He would turn the Jin country into a prosperous nation sooner or later, but she felt rather sour envisioning this idea.</p>
<p><i>Didn’t her father and second brother help him? How can he repay kindness with cruelty? Her father had made painstaking efforts to his usurpation</i>.</p>
<p>When she has the chance in the future, Ye Zhen wanted to certainly take back all the things he owed her family.</p>
