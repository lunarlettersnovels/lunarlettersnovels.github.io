            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 236 – Target (1)</strong></p>
<p>Time travels fast, gossip even faster.</p>
<p>Be it because the young miss of the noted Huang Family was famous in the academy, or for the sheer incredulity of the incident, the matters of Class B’s Archery Class spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>The news had reached Qi Jin’s ears within moments of her arrival at the academy. At first, she was taken aback, however, she knew better than anyone the kind of tales tongues could weave. She had as soon questioned a few people including one of the two chief characters Lu Yaoyao, in order to get the real story.</p>
<p>So now, inside the headmaster’s office, as the ‘victim’ poured out her grievance between sobs and cried injustice, making for a perfectly pathetic sight, Imperial Physician Qi was neither touched nor moved. If anything, <em><strong>this</strong></em> last round of ‘interrogation’ had served as proof that Teacher Tu and Huang Fuxiang were spinning lies.</p>
<p>In her harried and aggrieved state, Huang Fuxiang had cleverly omitted the part where she was the one who had first shot the arrow from the back and started it all. Instead, she had painted Lu Yaoyao as the villain in vivid colors and with such flair that if Qi Jin hadn’t investigated the prior to arriving here, she would have certainly sided with her just like the headmaster was now.</p>
<p>Seeing how this young girl was unabashedly concealing her own faults and righteously hailing the other as the evildoer, Imperial Physician Qi was rather disenchanted. Such a young age and such a scheming mind, dead set on ruining another’s future without remorse, inside the academy and not the inner palace, was truly despicable.</p>
<p>Qi Jin didn’t hesitate to make her disappointment loud and clear. With sharp eyes she bored into the girl and asked in a stern voice, “Huang Fuxiang, was Lu Yaoyao the first one to shoot an arrow?”</p>
<p>The headmaster creased his brows and looked at Qi Jin. Had it been anyone else saying so, he would have given them a piece of his mind already. This woman could not be repudiated on an impulse. So, even though he had already made his judgement and had only to announce the verdict, he had to indulge her right now.</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, the truth is very clear. You can even ask Teacher Tu. He was there.” Saying so, he gestured towards the man himself.</p>
<p>Qi Jin looked at the other coldly. “Teacher Tu, I heard that Huang Fuxiang was the first to launch an arrow at Lu Yaoyao’s back, saying she couldn’t control the bow and arrow. Is this not true?”</p>
<p>Teacher Tu lightly coughed. “I didn’t see Huang Fuxiang shoot an arrow…”</p>
<p>“One didn’t see it and one didn’t do it… are two different truths,” Qi Jin said in a stony voice and continued, “This academy will not allow any student to attack their fellow classmates, nor teachers to be partial.”</p>
<p>The headmaster’s frown deepened. He was getting jittery about dragging this matter more than necessary. But since this woman was involved now, he could not dismiss it without a just cause. “Imperial Physician Qi, what do you mean by this?”</p>
<p>“Headmaster, this matter should not be resolved hastily. The truth ought to be found out,” Qi Jin said in a heavy voice.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Are you saying we’re just accusing Lu Yaoyao?” Madam Huang pointed out in a shrill voice. She had been elated at the sight of Qi Jin. Her appearance would add credibility to this whole affair, shutting those that harbored the slightest doubts into silence. But now, seeing the other’s intentions, she was miffed.</p>
<p>“If Huang Fuxiang did not shoot an arrow first, how could Lu Yaoyao get frightened and grasp her bow and arrow to strike back? To harm someone from behind, that’s abominable! If Lu Yaoyao had not dodged the arrow in time, who would justify the incident to the Lu Family? Is the life of a miss from another family worthless?” Qi Jin demanded with a calm face.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang’s shoulders shuddered, she hid behind Madam Huang.</p>
<p>Teacher Tu said, “Even so, Lu Yaoyao is still at fault here. How could she shoot four arrows in a row…”</p>
<p>“That being said, she narrowly dodged an arrow. Or was it her luck? Can’t she counter an attack when she got frightened?” Qi Jin reasoned.</p>
<p>Teacher Tu was left speechless, he didn’t know how to refute.</p>
<p>It was now that the headmaster felt that he may have been led by the nose. He sternly looked at Teacher Tu and asked, “What is going on?”</p>
<p>Madam Huang said coldly, “It’s not my daughter’s fault. Where is that girl named Lu Yaoyao? Summon her here. I’d like to see how the Lu Family taught their daughter that she turned out to be such a vulgar girl.”</p>
<p>Suppose this incident had happened before, she naturally would not dare say such a thing. Having heard that Wang Fei Lu was confined to her premises by the emperor, and had fallen out of favor as an imperial concubine, did she need to be afraid?</p>
<p>“Madam Huang,” Qi Jin lightly said, “no matter how vulgar you may think this lady from another family is, she didn’t do anything to inflict harm behind their backs.”</p>
<p>Madam Huang pointed to Qi Jin, about to rain curses on her. But when she recalled that Qi Jin had the favor of the empress dowager, she swallowed the words she was about to say. “Imperial Physician Qi, are you being partial to your students?”</p>
