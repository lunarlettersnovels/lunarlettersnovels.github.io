            <p><strong>Chapter 395 – Take the Blame (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Shuang’er should learn some lessons, otherwise the Lu Family will be dragged in sooner or later.” Old Madam Lu didn’t want to compromise the entire Lu Family for the sake of one Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>“You old deathless…!” Liu Shi cried aloud.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi lowered his head and yelled at Liu Shi, “Mother! You shouldn’t have come here, go back!”</p>
<p>“Today, if you dare not help Shuang’er for Lu Yaoyao’s sake, I will die tomorrow!” Liu Shi cried out as she wailed, and her whole person slumped to the ground.”</p>
<p>“Then you can die!” Old Madam Lu said with a heavy voice, “If you don’t want to die, then I’ll give you a letter of divorce. You can go wherever you want. You won’t have to see me here, an old deathless person!”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming held the matriarch’s hand. “Mother, don’t get angry.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi had someone come over and bring the stupefied Liu Shi back inside and said to Ye Zhen, “Yaoyao, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced back at him. She didn’t care about Liu Shi’s escapades, but the importance Lu Shiming and his wife attached to her made her mood … somewhat complicated. She knew that they cared about her, but it turned out that they really treated her as their own child. Between Lu Wushuang and her, they chose her without the slightest hesitation.</p>
<p>Outside the door, the carriage was ready. Lu Lingzhi had Ye Zhen get in the carriage first and then followed. Looking at the young miss sitting in the corner, he whispered, “Are you afraid?”</p>
<p>“Afraid of what?” Ye Zhen looked at him coldly. For Liu Lingzhi, she could never let go of her disgust and vigilance.</p>
<p>“Shuang’er took advantage of you, aren’t you afraid the emperor … would punish you?” Lu Lingzhi asked. He was very curious. From the moment she came to the upper hall, he didn’t see any tension or fear in her eyes. She seemed to firmly believe that she would be safe.</p>
<p>A sneer bloomed at the corners of Ye Zhen’s mouth. “Since I haven’t done any wrong, why should I be afraid?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes even if one hasn’t done anything wrong, it still may not be okay.” Lu Lingzhi said. He felt that the emperor thought that Lu Wushuang had saved his life, so he would not do anything to her and perhaps would let Yaoyao take the blame.</p>
<p>Deep down in his heart, Lu Lingzhi felt a little distressed, knowing how this whole thing would end… that Yaoyao would become a scapegoat. He couldn’t say this in front of his third uncle and could only observe the situation upon entering the palace.</p>
<p>In any case, he would make it up to her later.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen revealed a slightly taunting look at Lu Lingzhi. <em>If Lu Shuang’er had done such a stupid thing and could escape, then, Mo Rongzhan’s brain must be full of water*.</em></p>
<p>[*Basically he is stupid]</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, no matter what punishment the emperor gives you, Eldest Brother will make it up to you later,” Lu Lingzhi said softly.</p>
<p>“If I take the blame for Gui Fei, what will you compensate me with? Your life?” Ye Zhen coldly asked.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao …,” Lu Lingzhi looked at her in consternation.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen faintly smiled and said, “Are you not confident in the judgment of His Imperial Majesty? Or are you too confident in Lu Wushuang’s stupidity?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi pursed his lips. He was not confident in them, rather, he felt that Mo Rongzhan now thought that Lu Wushuang was the girl he loved as a teenager, which was enough.</p>
<p>The carriage broke through the night, and they arrived at the gates of the imperial palace. Lu Lingzhi took out the token* requested from him. Not long after, they were allowed to enter the palace. The two of them were taken directly to the imperial study.</p>
<p>[*Apparently every person in the palace has this identification mark depending on their ranks]</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan, dressed in jet-black, plain clothes, was looking idly through the palace memorials. When Ye Zhen and Lu Lingzhi came in, his gaze first fell on the little girl walking behind, whom he had not seen for several days.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this official is here to confess.” Lu Lingzhi knelt down.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stood still and looked at him with a straight face.</p>
<p>“What are you guilty of?” There was a faint smile that emerged on the corners of Mo Rongzhan’s mouth.</p>
<p>“This official has heard that Xianfei Xu was poisoned after eating the blood bird’s nest that Yaoyao gave her. Your Majesty, there must be some misunderstanding,” Lu Lingzhi said.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded. “There is indeed a misunderstanding in this matter. The blood bird’s nest given to Xianfei Xu is not from Yaoyao, but from Zhen.”</p>
<p><em>What?!</em> Lu Lingzhi raised his head, a little confused.</p>
<p>“That blood bird’s nest was what Zhen gave to Lu Wushuang. Also, there are only golden bird’s nests in the harem. Lu Yaoyao has not left the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard for days. Where could she get a blood bird’s nest for Lu Wushuang? If Zhen has no such judgment, will I still be the emperor?” Mo Rongzhan’s voice was as cold as ice, his eyes looking at Lu Lingzhi fiercely.</p>
<p><em>Do they want to use Lu Yaoyao to take the blame for Lu Wushuang? That’s ridiculous!</em></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was surprised since he didn’t expect Lu Wushuang would take the bird’s nest given to her by the emperor to Xu Huiru. Now, even if he wanted to protect her, he couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, that Shuang’er… she—” Lu Lingzhi’s voice tightened.</p>
