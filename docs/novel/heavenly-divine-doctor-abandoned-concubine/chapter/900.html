            <p><strong>Chapter 429 – Come to Propose Marriage</strong></p>
<p>“Marquis, are you alright?” Lu Lingzhi’s young manservant asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Go to Marquis Jing Ning’s mansion.” Lu Lingzhi ordered quietly, mind still entrenched. <em>Perhaps, it was because Lu Yaoyao looked a little too much like Ye Zhen that he couldn’t help but have her image constantly in his mind…</em></p>
<p><em>If Lu Yaoyao is not with the Lu Family, perhaps everything will be alright.</em></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi mused on his way to find Tang Zhen. When he arrived, he happened to meet him as he was about to go out.</p>
<p>“Lingzhi, why are you here?” Tang Zhen asked, surprised to find Lu Lingzhi at his doorstep. “What a coincidence. I was on my way to see you. I heard that your poison broke out again. Does Mr. Chen have a way to treat you?”</p>
<p>At his friend’s concern, Lu Lingzhi faintly smiled and said. “Let’s go in and talk.”</p>
<p>Not having reason to refuse, Tang Zhen led the other back to his study. Then, after having tea, he asked in a low voice, “What matter is there that prompts you to come to see me today?”</p>
<p>“Recently, isn’t the situation back in the palace not very stable?” Lu Lingzhi inquired as he touched the rim of the tea cup and looked at the other with a smile.</p>
<p>“Lingzhi, you do know that without the emperor’s order beforehand, I cannot tell you too much.” Tang Zhen felt somewhat in a bind. He and Lu Lingzhi were once friends who were willing to risk life and limb for each other, but in the face of the imperial power, he now had no choice but to keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi nodded. “I understand. I’m just asking casually. Now that I’m not in court, I shouldn’t ask so many questions. It’s just the weather in the capital is unpredictable, so you should also be careful.”</p>
<p>Seeing that his friend did not blame him, Tang Zhen felt relieved and spoke with a smile. “There is the emperor here, how can the capital be unstable? The rumors outside cannot be believed.”</p>
<p><em>So, the emperor’s injury isn’t serious at all?</em> There was a glimmer of light in Lu Lingzhi’s eyes as his mind began to turn. <em>The emperor obviously did not trust the Lu family as much as before. Shuang’er now has become a Daoist nun… </em>Before he left, Lu Lingzhi’s second uncle had talked to him and told him that he wished to send Lu Jing to the palace to help Shuang’er. And though he did not promise at that time, off late, he wavered a little.</p>
<p>If there were girls from the Lu family in the harem, then they would be able to help Lu Wushuang when they were favored. They only needed to mention her (LWS) in front of the emperor, and she might still have a chance to return to the palace in the future.</p>
<p><em>When I get back, I’ll discuss this matter with Grandmother. Today, I came to see Tang Zhen for another matter.</em> Lu Lingzhi put the thought away for the time being and opened his mouth. “I have sounded out Third Aunt’s mind about what you told me last time.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen was stunned when he heard his words. <em>What had I said to Lu Lingzhi last time? Wasn’t it about his wish to marry Yaoyao?</em></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked at him and smiled as he said, “Third Aunt has a very good impression of you and is very happy to hear your intention. If you really have a heart for Yaoyao, then you can directly ask the Third Aunt for her hand.”</p>
<p>“Lingzhi…” Tang Zhen’s heart felt sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy at the same time.</p>
<p>“What’s with the look on your face? Don’t tell me that you regret your words?” Lu Lingzhi’s expression changed.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen immediately refuted. “How can I change my mind about Yaoyao? It’s just, Yaoyao is now a princess. Even if Third Madam Lu agrees, will… will the emperor agree?”</p>
<p>He did not dare to say what the emperor did to Lu Yaoyao. After all, they were brother and sister, as such he did not have the heart to reveal and hurt him.</p>
<p>“As long as you propose, Grandmother will naturally enter the palace and ask the empress dowager to confer marriage for you two. And you can tell the emperor yourself.” Lu Lingzhi said, “I will talk to Third Uncle.”</p>
<p><em>Can I really marry Yaoyao? Between her and the emperor… </em>Thinking back to the scene in the hunting grounds, his heart suddenly felt a deep heartache. “Lingzhi, I really want to marry Yaoyao, but will she be willing to marry me?”</p>
<p>“Why won’t she be willing? Don’t worry. Just go ahead and propose.” <em>If I want to get rid of the demons in my heart, then it’s imperative that I marry Yaoyao off. Otherwise, I’ll think of her day and night, and inevitably hurt her sooner or later.</em></p>
<p>Tang Zhen’s heart immediately beat harder. “Then, I’ll ask for the Third Young Miss’s hand from Third Madam Lu.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi smiled and said, “Alright, then I’ll wait for your good news.”</p>
<p>“Lingzhi, I don’t think it’ll be easy to settle the marriage… She’s a princess.” Although that was what he said, what Tang Zhen was more worried about was that she had the emperor in her heart, so she would refuse to marry him.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao is a princess, but she is also a daughter of the Lu family,” Lu Lingzhi said with a smile.</p>
