            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 193 – The Most Precious Thing (2)</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongyi shook his head and said in a choked voice, “No!”</p>
<p>“I will make you a medicated diet to fill your stomach and relieve pain, okay?” She spoke as if coaxing a child.</p>
<p>“What if it hurts?” Mo Rongyi asked, a little peeved.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen thought for a moment. “If it still hurts, then I will give you my most precious thing.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi considered for a moment in silence. “What is your most precious thing?”</p>
<p>“Forty thousand silver taels.” Ye Zhen said that silver was the most precious thing for her today, “It took me a long time to save it, and there can be no more.”</p>
<p>“Then if it doesn’t hurt, you must take forty thousand silver taels from me!” Mo Rongyi resisted the urge to roll his eyes.</p>
<p><i>Hmmph! Did she think that a majestic prince like me can’t provide a thousand taels?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded in all seriousness. “Then, it is settled. Little Prince, you must not go back on your word.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi asked in exasperation, “When did this prince break his promise?”</p>
<p>“Well, I shall cook porridge for you now,” Ye Zhen said with a smile.</p>
<p>The mood of all those present was somewhat complicated.</p>
<p><i>How did they get to silver from persuading Little Prince to take medicine? And what has happened to Third Miss Lu? Is there anyone who could haggle over money with the little prince like this? Isn’t she too confident?</i></p>
<p>Although this was the collective opinion, the empress dowager was not bothered. This little deal brought her a smile. No matter what method the girl used, it was a skill to get the little prince to eat.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at Ye Zhen; his eyes deep and secluded. He recalled the way she had deftly masked her fury and even dared to negotiate with him in the pavilion not long ago. At that time, he thought that she had benefited from the little prince. But if she wanted more, should she not come and please him instead?</p>
<p><i>How could I ever understand this girl?</i> He felt so conflicted by his discernment of her.</p>
<p>With that, Ye Zhen quickly curtsied before the empress dowager, and with her head bowed went out of the chambers. She heaved a deep sigh.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Your Highness, I will go help her.”</p>
<p>Qi Jin still had many words to ask Ye Zhen. When she saw Ye Zhen leaving the bedchambers, she followed along.</p>
<p>The empress dowager went to the bedside and touched Mo Rongyi’s forehead lovingly. “Do not say that again. Aijia does not like hearing those words.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s eyes were crimson and pale from all the crying he had just done. “Mother, I do not want to either.”</p>
<p>“Your surname is Mo and you should not be so cowardly.” Mo Rongzhan whispered beside him, looking at his only brother. He did not know how to educate him. He was quite helpless too.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi said unconvinced, “What about the surname Mo? There are more cowardly people in the emperor’s family, and there are also fatuous people.”</p>
<p>“Our ancestors once defeated the Huangfu Empire and built the present Jin country. If Imperial Father had not been tricked by treacherous court officials, he would not have been… used,” Mo Rongzhan said.</p>
<p>“Brother, I am not you,” Mo Rongyi said in a low voice. “Even if I can survive this disaster, I will not live long. We all know that.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager held his hand tightly. “Who said that? You will live well.” Mo Rongyi smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>This bitterness did not match his age. How could his body be so weak like this? Imperial Physician Qi said that he could not surpass the age of fifteen. He was already ten this year, perhaps he could live but five years? It was so cruel.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at him and saw his little brother’s watery eyes. If it were not for Ye Yisong, his younger brother would not have suffered such pain now.</p>
<p><i>Ye Yisong did not deserve a quick death.</i></p>
<p>“Brother, please do not embarrass Lu Yaoyao. She did not wager with me. I lied to Mother. I just wanted to summon her here,” Mo Rongyi suddenly said. He did not want to bring trouble to Lu Yaoyao even after he died.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan, who had already guessed the truth, was not surprised to hear those words. He just said lightly, “When did I embarrass her?”</p>
<p>The empress dowager was unaware of her older son’s suspicious temperament. However, she helped defend Ye Zhen, “Yaoyao is a good child.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s thin lips slightly pursed. He did not speak again.</p>
<p>“Mother, I do not feel any pain now,” Mo Rongyi touched his chest and said to the empress dowager.</p>
<p>“Aijia has permitted Yaoyao to stay in the palace. Let her take care of you for two days,” she said in a soft voice.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ye Zhen’s heart and seeing her concern for the little prince, she thought it would be a good thing to let her stay. Perhaps she could really alleviate her child’s illness.</p>
<p>However, at these words, Mo Rongzhan furrowed his eyebrows, his eyes seemed confused about what was going on.</p>
<p><i>Ah, so she has charmed Mother as well…</i></p>
