            <p><strong>Chapter 464 – Intruder</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen was already used to bathing alone. She didn’t like people watching, let alone help her bathe.</p>
<p>The person standing guard at this hour was another maid. After the black-browed girl left, she went to the outer room. She was waiting as Ye Zhen’s orders could come at any time, but for some reason, she couldn’t keep her eyes open and fell asleep on the bed.</p>
<p>A tall figure silently entered Ye Zhen’s room.</p>
<p>The mistress herself was immersed in the warm water that had been infused with <em>lingquan</em>, she felt her entire body relax. She closed her eyes slightly and placed her hands on the edge of the bathtub. Her skin as white as jade made her appear even more slender in water. Her graceful curves gradually submerged and although it was very clear, it did not affect a certain someone’s appreciation.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan quietly stood next to the screen, his eyes burning as he looked at the little person bathing. It was as if there was a wild beast roaring in his body. Just looking at her, he was already mesmerized. His heart was like fermented old wine that made his eyes hazy. It was filled with tender feelings. He almost could not control himself from going over and fishing her out of the water.</p>
<p>The anger in his heart gradually dissipated when he saw her. It was always like this. As soon as he saw her, he wouldn’t be able to get angry.</p>
<p>But he was still willing to do it.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t know that there was a big, grey wolf behind her. She leisurely soaked in for a while longer before preparing to get up.</p>
<p>Just as she sat down on the bed, Mo Rongzhan slowly walked out and looked at her with burning eyes.</p>
<p>“Zhen has asked Empress Dowager to rescind your title of imperial princess*, and given you the title of county princess**.” Mo Rong Zhan said hoarsely.</p>
<p>[*This princess = gōng zhǔ, like that of the imperial blood line directly linked to the emperor.<br>
** This is =  jùn zhǔ, “Princess of a Commandery” or “Princess of the Third Rank, usually the daughter of a prince. However, anyone can be promoted to this rank. You can read more here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_and_noble_ranks_of_the_Qing_dynasty" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty</u></a>]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was so scared that she almost sat up straight. “You, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan held her in his arms and kissed her lips. “What do you think I want to do?”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that the one-year period is empty talk?” Ye Zhen lowered her voice, but she could not hide the anger. <em>If she became a county princess, would he bring her directly into the palace?</em></p>
<p>“It’s true that I gave you a year. A year is for you to relieve the knot in your heart, not for you to marry someone else.” With those words, Mo Rongzhan naturally remembered that the empress dowager had almost given her to Tang Zhen in marriage. The tender feelings in his heart turned into jealousy.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt a little guilty and said in a low voice, “I only found out about this after Grandmother and the others decided. I wanted to stop Grandmother from talking to the empress dowager, but I was a step too late.”</p>
<p>“What do you think?” His big palm rested over her bosom, his voice low and hoarse. “That you will marry Tang Zhen without my objection?”</p>
<p>“Then I can’t marry anyone but you?” She glared at him.</p>
<p>Her bright and clear eyes were as beautiful as a morning star in the night, and because she was angry, they were full of light and color. Mo Rongzhan’s heart softened, and his low, hoarse and mellow voice seemed even more determined. “Other than me, who would dare marry you?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt that it was right to go to Huaijiang with Master. She was now a little afraid of facing Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me that if I don’t marry you, I will never marry?” she glowered at him and asked.</p>
<p>“How could I not let you marry for the rest of your life? It is only natural for you to marry me.” He rubbed her little hand.</p>
<p>“Can’t do this! No…!” She immediately knew what he was up to, she was so anxious that she tried to withdraw her hand.</p>
<p>“Then are you willing to watch me find another woman?” he forced her to hold still and asked in a low, husky voice as he nibbled her earlobe.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stomped her foot and cried, “There are many concubines in your palace, go find them! Go get them.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you jealous?” All the concubines in his palace were scheming against each other in the hopes of getting his favor. Even Xu Huiru, who looked dignified and generous on the surface, was nothing more than that. Seeing that he treated Yaoyao a little better, she immediately tried to use Ye Zhen to make him hate her(YY), but the little girl in his arms did not seem to care at all.</p>
<p><em>Jealous</em>? Ye Zhen felt that she really wouldn’t be jealous at all. She didn’t care who he wanted to spoil, as long as he didn’t come looking for her.</p>
