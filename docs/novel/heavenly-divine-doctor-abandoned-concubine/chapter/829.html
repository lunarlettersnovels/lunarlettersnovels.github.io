            <p><strong>Chapter 501 – Lu Lingzhi’s Decision</strong></p>
<p>The three people who died were all well known in Huaijiang City. They didn’t have faith in the efficacy of the medicines from the medical bureau and had refused to consume it. As a result, they couldn’t last the night.</p>
<p>After a thorough investigation, Huangfu Chen discovered that all those infected with typhoid fever had once left the city. It seemed that they had all been infected outside the city.</p>
<p>“There is not enough medicine,” Ye Zhen whispered to Huangfu Chen. “Our only option is to send people outside the city to look for medicine.”</p>
<p>Zheng Yuhua said, “I’ve already sent someone to report the ongoing epidemic. There should be assistance tomorrow at the earliest.”</p>
<p>“The two villages to the west and north of the city should be our top priority. They are adjacent to each other. Many have been infected with typhoid fever before, and it is most contagious in this weather. It is too late now to ask those villagers not to return to their villages, so they can only be banned from stepping out,”  Huang Fuchen said to Zheng Yuhua.</p>
<p>“I have already sent people to guard the entrance of the two villages. They can only enter but not leave,” Zheng Yuhua said.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen nodded solemnly. He was only doing this to prevent the condition from worsening, but most importantly, he still needed more medicinal herbs.</p>
<p>“My lord, there are dozens of people outside the city. They said that they are the special envoys sent by the Imperial Court for disaster relief.” While they were discussing the next course of action, a soldier rushed over to Zheng Yuhua.</p>
<p>Zheng Yuhua’s face lit up. “They are definitely here because of this outbreak. Mister Chen, please come with me to the city gate.”</p>
<p>To facilitate her work in the medical bureau, Ye Zhen always dressed up as an apprentice (junior doctor). Zheng Yuhua didn’t know that she was Princess Furong. He only heard her call Huangfu Chen Master, so he only treated her as an ordinary doctor.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said to Ye Zhen, “The medicine brewed yesterday was very effective. Today, it’s better to concoct a pot and have those people take it first.”</p>
<p>“The herbs we have is just enough for two more times*,” Ye Zhen whispered.</p>
<p>(*to be cooked twice)</p>
<p>“I hope that the special envoy outside the city has brought along some medicinal herbs too.” Huangfu Chen’s face darkened. If there was no medicine and the epidemic couldn’t be controlled, then their coming all the way here would be futile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen watched Huangfu Chen leave and whispered to Xue Lin, “Xue Lin, I have something I want you to do.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please instruct me,” Xue Lin immediately replied.</p>
<p>“The whereabouts of the medicinal supplies in Huaijiang City is unknown, and the disaster funds* haven’t really been sent here. There must be someone operating in the shadows. Now we can’t find out who he really is, but I’m worried that he will use this situation to spread unfavorable rumors against the emperor. We have to strike first to gain the upper hand. His Majesty tasked you to be my side, I believe you can handle this matter well,” Ye Zhen looked at him and whispered.</p>
<p>(*silver)</p>
<p>Xue Lin was shocked. “Your Highness, what do you want this subordinate to do?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “It shouldn’t be a problem for you to find a few more people. Spread rumors about the embezzlement of Huaijiang’s medicinal supplies and disaster funds.  And that this dam accident happened so as to warn the people behind it …”</p>
<p>Xue Lin was in rapt attention. The more he listened, the more he felt that this little princess looked delicate and squeamish but was fearless in her actions. The emperor had ascended the throne just a year ago. And if the rumors of a natural disaster were to spread now, attributing it to divine retribution, it would certainly be greatly disadvantageous. Now with the plan the princess was proposing, even if word of divine retribution by way of a natural disaster were to spread in the future, the influence would definitely be reduced by half.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, don’t worry, this subordinate will definitely handle this matter properly,” Xue Lin said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded in satisfaction. “Go ahead, spread it as you please. No matter who is behind this, you have to think of a way to uncover him. Such a large batch of medicinal supplies cannot disappear into thin air. There will definitely be a buyer. If you find out who the buyer is, you will naturally find out who stole the medicinal supplies.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Xue Lin bowed (cupped his hands in greeting).</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Unlike the dire straits in Huaijiang, the weather in the capital was still clear. People came and went, every street and alley was bustling and lively.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi got down from the carriage and stood in front of a large mansion that had been destroyed by a fire. He had set the fire himself and now the people who died here had become his inner demons. Some people would always ignore the most important things until they lost them.</p>
<p>However, what he didn’t know now was whether he was in love with Ye Zhen or Lu Yaoyao, who made his heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>Upon his return from the Nian Tzu Temple that day, he had gone straight to Third Uncle. Although the man didn’t explicitly say Yaoyao was not his own daughter, the meaning behind his words was that Yaoyao was not the flesh and blood of the Lu family. He hadn’t put it plainly. <em>Was it because he was afraid that he would no longer regard Yaoyao as his sister after he finds out?</em></p>
<p>He really didn’t want Yaoyao to be his sister!</p>
<p>Now that Lu Wushuang had disappeared from the world, he had originally intended to make Lu Yaoyao the empress. But now… He didn’t want to.</p>
<p><em>How to make the emperor lose interest in Yaoyao?</em> He had mulled over it for days together now. If there was anyone who could affect the emperor in this world, it was the little girl who had saved his life that year … Only she had the power to influence his mind, move him away from Yaoyao and towards herself instead. This was the only way to stop him from making Yaoyao the empress.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was dead. Where should he go to find a girl who could replace her? At no cost could the emperor know that Ye Zhen was the little girl who had saved him. He could only use his father* to send another woman to the emperor.</p>
<p>(*as a pretext cos he is no more … the dead don’t talk)</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi took one final look at the ruins. The hesitation in his eyes finally turned into resolve. He now knew what to do.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>The imperial palace, the imperial study.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was holding the secret missive expedited from Huaijiang. His handsome face was gloomy and his thin lips were tightly pursed. A moment later, they announced the arrival of Marquis Jing Ning into the palace.</p>
<p>“Ah Zhen, I have something I want you to do.” Mo Rongzhan looked at the man standing in front of him. He could only leave this matter to Tang Zhen. It might not be possible for others to do it. Although he really wanted to go to Huaijiang himself, the war between Biancheng and Dongqing was on the verge of breaking out. As the emperor, he could not leave the capital at such a time.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen immediately replied respectfully, “Your Majesty, please decree.”</p>
<p>“Go to Huaijiang City and bring Yaoyao back,” Mo Rongzhan whispered, looking sharply at him. “I believe you will figure it out.”</p>
<p>“Yes….” Tang Zhen smiled wryly in his heart. He did not dare to misinterpret anymore.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan said in a satisfied voice, “Huaijiang City has both flood and epidemic. I am worried that she will continue to stay there. Although I’ve sent Xu Ji ahead to deliver the medicinal supplies and disaster fund, she is in danger there.”</p>
<p>Only now did Tang Zhen know that Yaoyao had gone to Huaijiang. He couldn’t help feeling anxious. “Your Majesty, this minister will definitely bring the princess back.”</p>
<p>“She might not be willing to come back. You might have to think of a way,” Mo Rongzhan said softly.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, please rest assured, this minister will not let you down,” Tang Zhen said. Although he had given up, it did not mean that he could immediately forget Yaoyao. If she was in danger, he would be more nervous and distressed than anyone else.</p>
<p>Not to mention the current situation of Huaijiang, she must not be allowed to remain there.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded nonchalantly. “Go now and find a way to bring her back.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
