            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 349 – Undercover Inspection</strong></p>
<p><em>What is Mo Rongzhan doing here? No, more than that, I can’t believe that no one announced his arrival!</em></p>
<p>Looking at her stunned expression, Mo Rongzhan smiled and said, “Zhen is going on incognito inspection today. The people outside do not know that zhen is the emperor.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, the emperor has come to see Lingzhi,” Tang Zhen said, his unabashed eyes glued on Ye Zhen. He hadn’t seen her for a long time.</p>
<p>However, Ye Zhen only glanced at him faintly and said, “Call me Princess.”</p>
<p>With those words he instantly knew she was still angry at him. Helpless, he directed a bitter smile at her and cupped his hand in greetings. “Her Highness, the Princess.”</p>
<p>A flash of pleasure passed Mo Rongzhan’s eyes, the corner of his mouth quirking up in a slight smile.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, where is your eldest brother?”</p>
<p>“He’s inside,” Ye Zhen said briefly, not bothering with any superfluous action. Since Mo Rongzhan came here incognito, there was no need for her to salute.</p>
<p>“Why did you go to Jinwu City?” As he spoke, Mo Rongzhan went up the low stairs and stood in front of Ye Zhen, his lidded eyes resting on her face that was as fair as jade. The charming scene of her body that he had seen last night suddenly emerged to the forefront of his mind. Immediately, a certain ‘thing’ in his lower body quietly reacted, heating up his body with desire.</p>
<p>Feeling she was a little too close to Mo Rongzhan, Ye Zhen imperceptibly frowned as she took a step back. “My grandmother was worried about him, so I went with my father.”</p>
<p>“You missed A’Yi’s birthday banquet. He isn’t happy with that, so go to the palace and visit him these two days.” Mo Rongzhan whispered yet again. Left to him, he still wanted to stay and talk to her longer, but he was here to see Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.” Ye Zhen nodded and invited him into the room. “Your Imperial Majesty, please come in.”</p>
<p>“En.” Mo Rongzhan took a deep look at her, then turned around,and walked into the room.</p>
<p>Though Tang Zhen followed his master, his eyes couldn’t help but stray to Ye Zhen. He whispered, “Yaoyao, are you still angry?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen only said faintly, “Why should I be angry with Marquis Jing Ning?”</p>
<p>“I’ll explain it to you later,” Tang Zhen said hurriedly before he entered the room.</p>
<p>Sounds of people dropping to their knees drifted out of the room while Ye Zhen stood outside the door. Then came Mo Rongzhan’s words of concern for his assistant war minister and the grateful voices of the Lu Family.</p>
<p>As she stood there, listening, she couldn’t help but think it was funny. The two men inside were people who were responsible for the destruction of her Ye Family, yet here she was as their sister…</p>
<p>“Yaoyao.” Tang Zhen came out of the room and looked at her carefully.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at him and turned around, wanting to leave.</p>
<p>“Are you still mad at me? What happened to Teacher Shan has nothing to do with me.” Tang Zhen caught up to her and hurriedly explained.</p>
<p>“Marquis Jing Ning, who but you would suspect Teacher Shan?” Ye Zhen asked coldly.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen tried to reason. “If I didn’t tell him, wouldn’t the emperor begin to doubt me? Furthermore, Teacher Shan was originally Ye Zhen’s teacher. So, what is her purpose in approaching you? Clearly she had a purpose.”</p>
<p>“Then tell me, what was her purpose? Don’t tell me you think she’s trying to use me for revenge?” Ye Zhen was not in a good mood as she yelled.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I was wrong, alright? I was wrong. Don’t be angry with me,” Tang Zhen said softly. “I didn’t know Teacher Shan would leave the academy because of this.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen also knew that she was venting her fury. She knew that if she hadn’t mentioned Ye Zhen in front of Mo Rongzhan to save herself, Teacher Shan would not have been forced to leave. But… She glanced at Tang Zhen and said, “Are you afraid that I’ll be angry and blame you? You can rest assured, I don’t have the ability to deal with Marquis Jing Ning.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant.” Tang Zhen looked at her anxiously. “Yaoyao, to me, it doesn’t matter whether you are a princess or not. I just don’t want you to be angry with me.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at him surprised, but when she saw the affection in his eyes, she suddenly understood. Uncomfortable, she turned her head away and said, “I’m not angry anymore.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Tang Zhen laughed happily. “Yaoyao, I heard that you are going hunting with the little prince. I’ll go with you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you’re still planning to win the silver whip back?” Ye Zhen frowned.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen was stunned for a moment before he burst out into a peal of hearty laughter. “It’s already Yaoyao’s, how can I want it back?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what day the hunt will begin.” Mo Rongyi was going to have a polo match with Prince Shun in a few days. Therefore, it was certain that she was going to go to have a look.</p>
<p>“Now is not the best time for hunting. However, in a few days, it will be the best time for spring hunting to commence in earnest,” Tang Zhen said.</p>
<p>His words reminded Ye Zhen of the distress she had experienced the last time over. Then on, she had always wanted to create a bow and arrows that she could carry with her. As such she asked, “Do you know where I could go to commission a bow and arrows for me?”</p>
<p>“What type of bow and arrows do you want?” Tang Zhen asked.</p>
<p>“Light and easy to carry.” Ye Zhen  dropped her voice. “Sharp, should deliver fatal damage in one move.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen looked at her in surprise and asked, “What do you want to do with such a bow and arrows?”</p>
<p>“Protect myself,” Ye Zhen stated, voice light yet heavy at the same time.</p>
<p>“I’ll find it for you.” Tang Zhen also recalled the incident, he immediately felt that it was necessary for him to bring along a bow and arrows with him.</p>
