            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 96 – Care (1)</h3>
<p>Pei Shi returned to the capital the next day, leaving a pair of children to take care of Lu Lingzhi in Zhuangzi.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen begged Pei Shi to take her with her but Pei Shi just grabbed her ear and said that she was lazy and heartless. Instead, she insisted that Ye Zhen take charge of changing the dressing on Lu Lingzhi’s wounds.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt suffocated with all of this but was left with no choice other than to yield and tend to Lu Lingzhi’s injury!</p>
<p>Not only that, but Lu Xiangzhi also pestered her to reproduce the medicine she previously gave him. Ye Zhen was secretly disappointed that she wished she had never given Lu Lingzhi the salve mixed with drops of <i>lingquan</i>.</p>
<p>If there was a next life, she would never let Lu Lingzhi use her <i>lingquan</i>!</p>
<p>“I made the last medicine by accident, and this one may not have the same effect as the last one.” She told Lu Xiangzhi.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother’s wound needs dressing change. Come on, let’s give him this medicine!” Lu Xiangzhi took the medicine enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stood still and looked away.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, Mother said you should change the dressing.” Lu Xiangzhi saw at a glance that his sister was too lazy to do her chore and shook his head helplessly. “Why don’t you like Eldest Brother?”</p>
<p>“People are predestined friends with each other. Maybe Eldest Brother and I just don’t have that kind of fate, so we are not meant to be congenial to each other!” Ye Zhen snorted and followed Lu Xiangzhi unwillingly.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi laughed. “You have done the wrongest things since you came to the capital, you seem to be a little different.”</p>
<p>His mirthful remark, however, was not reciprocated. Ye Zhen displayed a gloomy face, while she looked down at her feet.</p>
<p>“Everyone will change. We used to be only one family in the border town. It didn’t matter what I did or said, but now it’s different.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao…” Lu Xiangzhi suddenly stopped and looked at Ye Zhen seriously. In front of him, the girl with picturesque eyes, painted eyebrows, and white skin comparable to snow and frost frowned. She hardly had the appearance of the wild girl from the border town.</p>
<p>“Do you still care about that?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen appeared confused. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi touched her head. “Your elder brother knows that you’ve been prudent since we’ve arrived in the capital. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to grieve yourself. You will always be your brother’s sister.”</p>
<p>“Brother…”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart warmed. Lu Xiangzhi thought her change was because she was worried that they didn’t want her. She laughed at how ridiculous and sweet it sounded.</p>
<p>“I have not wronged myself. I know that you are kind to me, so I also want to do better.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi flicked her forehead. “What are you talking about? You are fine now, better than ever.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen cocked her head and smiled prettily. “Why is it that my brother talks as if he has a profound understanding of the <i>women’s 18 big changes<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup></i>?”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi lightly laughed then nodded. “Yes, yes, it’s because my sister is indeed undergoing the 18 changes.”</p>
<p>Afterwards, the brother and sister came to Lu Lingzhi’s courtyard laughing on their way. When they set foot inside Lu Lingzhi’s chambers, Ye Zhen’s previous smile shrank a little.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was stunned when she came in. In a few days of not seeing her, how could it be possible that the little girl became more dazzling?</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, Yaoyao and I will change your dressing.” Lu Xiangzhi said with a proud smile and motioned Ye Zhen to come with him.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shot an angry look at Lu Xiangzhi, walked to the short stool beside the bed, and sat down. She took the salve from Lu Xiangzhi but did not spare Lu Lingzhi a look as she did so, her head was bowed throughout.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi lifted his eyes and looked at her drooping face. Her skin seemed to glow like jade that even Ye Zhen, the most famous person in the capital during her reign as Wang Fei, would seem inferior to her.</p>
<p><i>How could she change so fast? How long did it take to change from a wild girl to such stunning delicate miss?</i></p>
<p>He was certain that if he had not been seeing and witnessing her change, he would think that Lu Yaoyao was replaced by another woman.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen could feel Lu Lingzhi’s curious gaze the whole time so she couldn’t help intensifying her hold on his injured foot…</p>
