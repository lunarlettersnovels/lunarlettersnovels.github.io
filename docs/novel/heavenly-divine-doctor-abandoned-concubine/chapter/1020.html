            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 309 – A Change In Fate (2)</strong></p>
<p>“I am unable to find any results for divination in this person’s fate.” Huangfu Chen looked up at the empress dowager. This wasn’t the first time he had seen these details. <em>But… how was he unable to find any results?</em> He remembered that he had been able to do it the first time.</p>
<p>“Why is this so?” the empress dowager hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t explain. Sometimes, when someone is extremely fortunate or noble, it is impossible to divinate their fate,” Huangfu Chen said.</p>
<p>The owner of these details shouldn’t be alive, but there were also signs of incontestable fortune. He couldn’t understand. <em>What was the reason for this?</em></p>
<p>Before when he had divinated this record, the signs had shown conflicting Gemini: twin figures. If they lived together, then they must conflict as they lived, bringing them both early deaths. If they lived separately, then one would die tragically, and the other would lead an incomparably noble life.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that, after so many years, her fate would already change to something he couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>When the empress dowager heard the words “incomparably noble”, she was almost certain that Ye Zhen was Mo Rongyi’s “noble person”. “Do you think that she will be A’Yi’s noble person?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked down at the two divination records. He knew that this was Lu Yaoyao’s. If he wasn’t able to divinate for her, then that meant that something must have changed concerning her fate. And Mo Rongyi’s original fate had also changed. It looked like it had something to do with Lu Yaoyao, who had repeatedly saved him.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Highness, Little Prince’s fate seems to be different from what it was before. It doesn’t suggest a short life anymore.” Mo Rongyi seemed to have avoided a tragedy.</p>
<p>The empress dowager hurriedly stood up, moved, as she looked at Huangfu Chen. “Mr. Chen, is what you speak of truth?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled and nodded. “The divination results clearly suggest this.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful!” The empress dowager clapped in joy. All these years, her greatest worry had been Mo Rongyi’s divination result from many years ago. Today, after Huangfu Chen’s words, she could finally rest easy.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen carefully asked, “May I ask who this noble person is? Their fate is quite odd.”</p>
<p>“It is a little girl that I am extremely fond of.” The empress dowager smiled.</p>
<p>“So it is.” Taking the hint, Huangfu Chen didn’t ask anything else.</p>
<p>The empress dowager soon dismissed the palace attendants, and quietly asked Huangfu Chen, “Mr. Chen, I won’t hide this from you. I have the wish to make this girl a princess. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“If speaking about this fate, a princess would be more suitable.” However, he remembered when he was divinating, Lu Yaoyao should have the fortune of an empress. But, as of today, he didn’t dare put out the word again.</p>
<p>Lu Yaoyao’s identity was a secret. It was unlikely that she would become empress. If she could become a princess, she could be able to save her own life in the future.</p>
<p>The empress dowager asked with a little hesitation, “Then if she were to become a concubine—”</p>
<p>“If she were named a princess, it would be more beneficial for Little Prince,” Huangfu Chen said. Even if it were just on the behalf of his deceased acquaintance, he still had to stop ​​the empress dowager from having Lu Yaoyao enter the imperial harem. Lu Yaoyao was Ye Yiqing’s other daughter, and her sister had died at the hands of Mo Rongzhan. If her identity were revealed in the future, she would be led to the same tragic end.</p>
<p>“Then, I understand.” The empress dowager nodded slightly. <em>It seems that Yaoyao and Emperor are ill-fated for each other.</em> However, since A’Yi’s fate had changed, she was willing to help her older son but still had to ask Yaoyao for her opinion. “Thank you for today, Mr. Chen.”</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Highness speaks too greatly of it.” Huangfu Chen smiled faintly. Before entering the palace, he had already deduced the reason for the empress dowager’s summons. The only thing he hadn’t expected was that Lu Yaoyao’s fate had actually changed.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen took his leave from Cining Palace. But before he could go far, Mo Rongzhan had sent someone to bring him to the imperial study.</p>
