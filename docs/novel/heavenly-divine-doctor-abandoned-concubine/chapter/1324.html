            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 3 – Poisoned Wine (3)</strong><b></b></p>
<p>“Why did you let them kill me, Mo Rongzhan? Why didn’t you keep your promise? Why didn’t you come to see me even once?” Ye Zhen asked, but no one could hear her cry.</p>
<p>Mo Rhongzhan’s eyes fell coldly on Lu Lingzhi’s figure in front of him.</p>
<p>“Is Ye Zhen dead?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence. For a moment, Ye Zhen thought that she would catch a glimpse of sorrow or regret in his eyes, but there was none.</p>
<p>“If an insignificant person dies, then let it be.”</p>
<p>He didn’t want her inside the palace, but he made sure that all of her needs were taken care of. Food, clothes-she had it all.</p>
<p><i>If she wanted to die, she might as well die</i>, he thought.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s eyes flashed. “Yes, I agree.”</p>
<p>“Go on. Tomorrow, I’ll make Shuang’er the Imperial Concubine. If Shuang’er hadn’t saved me, I wouldn’t be here today,” Mo Rongzhan said.</p>
<p>Although Lu Wushuang didn’t remember the secret words, it was normal for she was only seven years old at that time. It’s possible that she wouldn’t be able to remember such an old memory. Or, at least, this was what the emperor thought.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen suddenly had an impulse to laugh loudly. She had waited all her life for his affection but all she got was a cup of poisoned wine and the apathetic words from his mouth saying that she was nothing to him at all.</p>
<p><i>An insignificant woman.</i></p>
<p>The bitterest thing was, she didn’t even know the truth until she died.</p>
<p>She screamed out of anger… out of despair.</p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan, if there is an afterlife, I, Ye Zhen, will surely have my revenge!”</p>
<p>Having enough of what she had seen, she turned to flee the palace. She wanted to visit her deceased family’s abode, but no matter how hard she struggled, she could not break free. It was like there was an invisible force that held her captive inside the palace.</p>
<p>As such, time passed and it was two years.</p>
<p>Her spirit, floating and walking unseen in the palace halls. She was able to hear every rumor from the maids in the pantry, see the guards slacking at night when everyone was asleep and most of all, she had seen how Lu Wushuang filled the emperor’s head with her lies.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, do you still remember this jade pendant?” Lu Wushuang, who had taken Ye Zhen’s place and become the wang fei, with a charming smile took out a piece of stone and asked him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan glanced at it, smiling. “This…” he took ahold of the stone and said, “… is what I gave you as a token to meet me. It’s a pity that I waited for you for how many days, but you didn’t show up.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang reclined in his arms and didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>It was the exact jade pendant Ye Zhen gave to Lu Lingzhi. It turns out, he did not give it to Mo Rongzhan, but instead, he had handed it to her sister, Lu Wushuang, to let her take Ye Zhen’s place.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen never knew there was more hatred than what she felt at this moment.</p>
<p>“Zhen<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup> wants you to keep this.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang stretched out her hand to grab the jade pendant from him when suddenly, it gave off a flame that seemed to be invisible to their eyes, but not to Ye Zhen. However, Lu Wushuang instantly felt a searing pain on her palm.</p>
<p>“Ahh!” she exclaimed, and the jade pendant fell to the ground, suddenly breaking into half.</p>
<p>As the invisible flame gradually disappeared, Ye Zhen’s soul finally broke free from the palace.<b><br>
