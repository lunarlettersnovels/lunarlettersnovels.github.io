            <p><strong>Chapter 447 – Undressing (2)</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan snorted coldly. “Zhen doesn’t like it.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, let me change the dressing for you,” Ye Zhen said woodenly, and walked over to take the snow lotus ointment.</p>
<p>“Do the undressing for me.” Mo Rongzhan opened his arms, looking indifferent and proud.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen paused, took a deep breath, and walked to him, stretched out her hand to untie the black jade belt for him. When she wanted to unbutton, she could only stand on her toes. This was the first time she had undressed a man. She was nervous and a little unfamiliar and did not unbutton for a long time.</p>
<p>Her hands were sour and tired. She bit her lip and said, “You are too high, I can’t untie it.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan lowered his eyes to look at her embarrassed appearance and a small smile formed at the corners of his mouth while his long arms obediently wrapped around her waist and lifted her up. “Isn’t this just right?”</p>
<p>“Let me down!” Ye Zhen cried with a blushing face.</p>
<p>“Hurry up and undress me.” Mo Rongzhan gently patted her supple behind, with a deep smile hidden in his eyes.</p>
<p>She couldn’t push him away, so she had to use the fastest speed to unbutton him, but the more she wanted to speed up, the more she couldn’t do it.</p>
<p>He stifled a laugh. “Zhen will do it himself.”</p>
<p>She pushed his hand away and got out of his embrace. “You said you wouldn’t do this to me.”</p>
<p>“Have I ever said that?” Mo Rongzhan took off his brocade robe, leaving only a single bright yellow coat. “I only said that I will give you one year.”</p>
<p>“If you treat me like this again, I… I won’t enter the palace anymore,” she glared at him and said.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes darkened slightly. “Come here and apply the medicine.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t know if he had agreed or disagreed. Seeing his gloomy face, she had to go over and put medicine on his back. His wound had turned pink. At this time, if he didn’t put on some snow lotus cream every day, it would be itchy and uncomfortable. The weather was getting hot, if he sweats, it could turn worse.</p>
<p>“I also have other things to do every day, so I can’t come and apply medicine on you for such a little thing,”  she muttered quietly as her deft hands applied the medicine.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s lips curved into a smile, her soft and complaining voice actually delighted him. “I don’t like being touched by others.”</p>
<p>She pursed her lips and touched the wound on his waist with her fingertips. Seeing that there were many deep and shallow scars, she asked in a low voice, “Have you often been injured before?”</p>
<p>“Small injuries,” he said nonchalantly, backhandedly holding her hand, he turned a little and looked down at her, “does your heart ache for me?”</p>
<p><em>Mister Chen said that his previous injuries had been more serious than this time. How could it be a minor injury?</em></p>
<p>She withdrew her hand. “You are doing such things again, what if people see?”</p>
<p>“So what if they see it?” he asked, raising his eyebrows.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said seriously, “I am now your imperial sister. If others find out… wouldn’t it turn into a scandal? When that moment comes, the empress dowager will definitely dislike me.”</p>
<p>His expression turned cold and he nodded gently. “You reminded me that <em>zhen</em> should let you stop being a princess.”</p>
<p>“Did you even understand what I was saying?” She glared at him angrily.</p>
<p>“Understood.” He was pleased with her sullen look. He couldn’t help dipping his head and kissing her lips, gently sliding the tip of his tongue into her mouth, absorbing the sweetness that belonged to her regardless of her objection.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen remembered Xu Huiru’s words from yesterday, and thumped Mo Rongzhan’s chest with anger. “Ah… let go…!”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan held her hand, reluctantly left her pink lips, buried his face in her chest, and panting said, “Yaoyao, what if I can’t wait for a year?”</p>
<p>♚♚♚</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s immediately tuned stiff all over. In that instant, she understood what he meant. He could not wait for a year. Truly, if she’d had enough strength, she would have kicked him out right then and there.</p>
<p>Anger and fury engulfed her heart, but there was nothing she could do about him. At last, unable to endure, she opened her mouth and bit his injured shoulder hard.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to murder your own husband?” Mo Rongzhan exclaimed in pain as he finally relinquished his hold.</p>
<p>Immediately taking her chance, she dashed out of his arms and chastised him, “Mo Rongzhan, you are a villain!”</p>
<p>“The matter of murdering your own husband aside, you also dare to scold <em>zhen</em>?” He raised his eyebrow and said, “Watch how <em>zhen</em> will clean you up.”</p>
<p>“Don’t come here!” Seeing him drawing neared with the intention to catch her once again, she ran out in horror.</p>
<p>Alas, after running for a few steps, yet again, she was tugged into an embrace from behind. “Where do you want to run to?”</p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan!” She exclaimed, feeling so angry that she did not know what to say anymore. <em>This man’s words cannot be counted on! He said he wouldn’t force me, but what is he doing right now?! Is this what he considers ‘willing’?!</em></p>
<p>Seeing that she was red with rage, he smiled. Unable to hold himself back, he pecked her lips a few times and said, “<em>Zhen</em> won’t bother you. That’s why you should go to the Palace of Heavenly Purity from time to time in the future. You must not look for all sorts of excuses just to avoid <em>zhen</em>. After all, though <em>zhen</em> has promised to give you a year, that doesn’t mean that <em>zhen</em> can simply not see you for an entire year.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen still resisted his embrace, she just lowered her head and kept her lips sealed. She never wanted to promise him anything and neither would she marry him a year later. In fact, as long as she had a chance, she would definitely avoid him and keep her distance far far away.</p>
<p>“I’m going back to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard,” she said, tone low.</p>
<p>He wanted to keep her with him, but he knew that he couldn’t force her too hard. Otherwise, she would only avoid him more.</p>
<p>“En.” He loosened his hold on her waist. “What you said just now… Was that what someone said to you before?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen froze in place. “What words are you talking about?”</p>
