            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 91 – Is She His Death?</h3>
<p>Ye Zhen suddenly raised her head fearlessly and looked at him in the eye.</p>
<p><i>Does he still remember? Remember when she told him that her little name was Yaoyao? Then how could he still regard Lu Wushuang as her?</i></p>
<p>Seeing Ye Zhen’s reaction, Mo Rongzhan’s eyes sank. “Answer me.”</p>
<p>“Never heard of someone bearing the same name.” Was her brief answer.</p>
<p>A flash of hurt crossed the emperor’s face and a brief silence followed. <i>The woman would be the death of him! </i>He thought to himself.</p>
<p>After some moment, Mo Rongzhan nodded in surrender and asked her another thing.</p>
<p>“Were you the woman in the hot springs pool that day?” he suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s face paled slightly. <i>Did he want to settle accounts?</i></p>
<p>Seeing her face, Mo Rongzhan snorted softly. “You are quite daring, even dared to fight me?”</p>
<p>“On that night, this miss didn’t see His Majesty clearly and deemed him as a commoner.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked terrified as if she had just found out that the man on that day was the emperor. But she wasn’t afraid even a bit.</p>
<p>Her eyes were slightly cold. She really wanted to make a face of him, but as a matter of fact, being an emperor changed him. His skin had gotten really thick.</p>
<p>“Get out of here!” Mo Rongzhan wanted to change her name, but this would make Lu Wushuang find clues, and he waved his hand wearily.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bowed, took the horse, and left.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes looked at the rope in his hands… <i>maybe a lot of people know this knot. Lu Yaoyao knowing this didn’t mean that she and his Yaoyao was the same person.</i></p>
<p>How Lu Wushuang got the jade pendant was one thing he needed to know.</p>
<p>After a long walk, Ye Zhen turned over her horse and quickly left the forest without looking back.</p>
<p><i>Why was Mo Rongzhan still looking for her? Wasn’t he convinced that Lu Wushuang was the one who saved him? Unexpectedly, just by a knot, he had already been suspicious. If he had not suspected Lu Wushuang, he would not have been so sensitive.</i></p>
<p><i>Since when did he start suspecting Lu Wushuang?</i></p>
<p>She remembered the two years when her spirit wandered in the palace. He had never doubted Lu Wushuang, at least he didn’t look like it. Even if Lu Wushuang did not remember the secret code, he was very kind to her.</p>
<p>But in this case, Mo Rongzhan already suspected Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was confused, the turn of events was very different from what she had witnessed when she was still a vengeful spirit.</p>
<p>A shallow smile rose from the corner of Ye Zhen’s mouth. She was still thinking about how to expose Lu Wushuang’s lies. But it seemed that she did not need to start at all. Mo Rongzhan had already questioned her and would question Lu Wushuang not long after. <i>Wouldn’t he have Lu Lingzhi questioned too?</i></p>
<p>Deep in her musings, she didn’t even notice that she had already arrived at the Zhuangzi.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, where have you been? I’ve been looking for you for half a day!” When Ye Zhen came out of the woods, she saw Teacher Shan coming with her horse.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen jumped off her horse and laughed. “I beat two pheasants and went back to make hot soup in a pot tonight.”</p>
<p>“I have seen imperial guards just now. Have you met anyone?” Teacher Shan asked in an intuitive tone.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see the guards, but when I met a child who fell into a trap, I rescued him and left,” Ye Zhen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan’s eyes flashed slightly. “A child?”</p>
<p>On her way, Teacher Shan had seen imperial guards accompany a child out of the forest. Those people had already gone to Chengde Mountain Villa.</p>
<p><i>Was that a child an imperial prince?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed. “I didn’t believe it when the child said he was a prince. A prince doesn’t come here alone so I thought that he was just a son of a hunter. After I rescued him, I let him go back.”</p>
<p>Teacher Shan was speechless.</p>
