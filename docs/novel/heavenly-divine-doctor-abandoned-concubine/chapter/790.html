        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 541 – Where is Yaoyao?</strong></p>
<p>It was getting dark, and the wind and waves were getting bigger and bigger!</p>
<p>Under the lingering light of dusk, Ye Zhen looked across the briny expanse. Wave after wave of billowing water surged toward her; overhead, the dark, roiling clouds threatened to blot out the rest of the sunset altogether.</p>
<p><em>It seems like there’ll be a storm soon. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>When it was calm, she could not leave. Now that a storm was coming, she was afraid that no one would come to rescue her. Even if her master wanted to come to save her, she reckoned that in such a storm, it would be a very dangerous thing. Chances were, he would not know how to find this island.</p>
<p><em>No, even if Master can’t find this place, Zhao Mingxiao will definitely come. His weapons and provisions are here, once he establishes the country, there will inevitably be war, then he will definitely come to this island.</em></p>
<p>She could just wait in the cave. There was food inside anyway, and she wouldn’t die of hunger.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen went back into the cave unaware that Zhao Jia Island was in chaos, and Zhao Mingxiao was captured by Old Master Jiang. Ye Chunming had given orders to kill Mo Rongzhan. Some islanders didn’t act, but some heeded his words and rushed forward.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji shouted in vain for them to stop.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan simply glanced at Shen Yi. Then, Shen Yi led a dozen people off the boat, and in a moment, subdued those islanders. The Emperor of Jin had brought troops to the sea this time not because Zhao Mingxiao had declared a state. He came here for his little girl and with the determination of destroying the island. He had brought along his elite soldiers. On the battlefield, one was enough to subdue ten experts, but against these islanders, it was just child’s play to them.</p>
<p>“Stop, no more fighting!” Zhao Tianji ordered loudly, as he stared daggers at Ye Chunming.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming did not expect Mo Rongzhan to bring such elite soldiers along. If Zhao Tianji was willing to join forces, they could stand a chance to win. But now that Zhao Tianji was not willing to be Mo Rongzhan’s enemy, even if he wanted to take advantage of the chaos and deal with Mo Rongzhan, he couldn’t do so.</p>
<p>He could no longer stay here! If Mo Rongzhan found out that he was Ye Chunming, he would not let him go. He thought Mo Rongzhan still did not know that Lu Yaoyao was from the Ye family. If he could not use Zhao Mingxiao, he still had Lu Yoyao…</p>
<p>Lu Yaoyao’s identity(position) was more advantageous. Not only was she Lu Lingzhi’s cousin but also the princess of the Jin country.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming hooked his lips and smiled. While no one was noticing him, he slowly hid behind the crowd and quietly snuck away.</p>
<p>Seeing how powerful Mo Rongzhan’s men were, the islanders didn’t dare to make another move. They just stood there looking at one another, not knowing what to do next.</p>
<p>“Surrender or destroy the island, choice is yours,” Mo Rongzhan said coldly as he looked at Zhao Mingxiao and the others indifferently</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji said, “As long as no more formations are set up outside our Zhao Jia island, and we are allowed to enter and exit freely for business, we are willing to pay taxes to the imperial court every year.”</p>
<p>Who does not want to become an emperor, who does not want a nation? However Zhao Jia Island did not have such an ability right now, even if there had weapons, herbs, and provisions, what could they do? They were used to living in peace and contentment; it’s not that they couldn’t afford a war, but they still need time.</p>
<p>“Zhao Tianji, you traitor!” Zhao Mingxiao roared.</p>
<p>“You know well in your heart that what Zhao Jia Island needs is not statehood, but freedom.” Zhao Tianji cast Zhao Mingxiao a look and ordered, “Elder Xing, take Zhao Mingxiao down, lock him up, and decide what to do with him later.”</p>
<p>Elder Jiang clicked on Zhao Mingxiao’s acupuncture points and handed him over to Elder Yin.</p>
<p>However, Huangfu Chen reached out to block him, “Where is Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan stern eyes immediately turned to Zhao Mingxiao.</p>
<p>“The person was captured by Ye Shi, if you want to know, go ask him!” Zhao Mingxiao said with a cold smile. Now that all his hopes of establishing a country was trashed, since Mo Rongzhan and Huangfu Chen cared so much about Lu Yaoyao, then he might as well have bury her with them*!</p>
<p>[*the being his hopes]</p>
<p>They would not be able to see Mu Qing, and as long as she didn’t reveal the whereabouts, no one would know where Lu Yaoyao was being held.</p>
<p>“Where’s that man Ye Shi?” Zhao Tianji shouted and glanced around. <em>Where is the masked man Ye Shi?</em></p>
<p>Zhao Tianji immediately called for someone to find Ye Shi.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s cold gaze landed on Huangfu Chen. “How come Yaoyao is not with you?”</p>
<p>“Ye Shi called her out to talk, but she never returned. I’m afraid that he’s hid her.” Huangfu Chen looked at the dark sky. “If she’s hidden in Zhao Jia Island, it’s okay… But if she’s hidden elsewhere…”</p>
<p>“How did she go out with that person? How on earth did you take care of her?” Mo Rongzhan was furious. He had thought that he would find the little girl once he entered Zhao Jia Island, but now, no one knew if she was alive or dead.</p>
<p>He could not control his anger… He was afraid thinking of how she was locked up in someplace. He felt like his heart was being sliced back and forth with a dull knife, the pain was unbearable.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen simply listened to Mo Rongzhan’s questioning in silence, he knew it was his fault that the little girl had gone missing. He had not taken care of her. And should anything really happen to Yaoyao, he would never forgive himself.</p>
<p>“Island Lord, Island Lord!” Mu Fei jumped up and waved his hand, shouting for Zhao Tianji.</p>
<p>“Why is Little Fei here?” Zhao Tianji frowned and had someone bring him over.</p>
<p>Mu Fei had ran across most of Zhao Jia Island,he was so tired that he was gasping for breath. In fact, he had been here for some time now. When he discovered that the situation was different, he immediately turned around to find Mu Qing. However, he found that his eldest sister had disappeared. He had searched all over the courtyard, but didn’t see her. So he had hurried back. Just when he arrived here, he saw that Zhao Mingxiao was being arrested.</p>
<p>“Island Lord, my eldest sister is missing,” Mu Fei cried out anxiously.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen’s expression changed slightly. He said, “Weren’t you with your eldest sister?”</p>
<p>Mu Fei was so anxious that he almost jumped. “Brother-in-law almost killed Eldest Sister. She asked me to bring a message to the Island Lord, I… I saw that there was a fight going on here. I wanted to go back and tell my eldest sister, but I couldn’t find her.”</p>
<p>“What did Mu Qing want you to tell me?” Zhao Tianji asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“Eldest Sister said… that the person is on Black Wind Island.” Mu Fei looked at Huangfu Chen for help. “Brother-in-law must have hidden my sister. You have to go find my sister.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji looked at Huangfu Chen suspiciously and said, “What does it mean that the person is on Black Wind Island? That place, Black Wind Island, has winds and waves all year round, and people from our Zhao Jia Island don’t go there easily.”</p>
<p>Hangfu Chen, who hadn’t thought much of it at first, looked at Mo Rongzhan fiercely and cried out, “Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s complexion changed. “Where is Black Wind Island?” he demanded.</p>
<p>“It’s a small island in the west, there are no traces of people there, so you can go…” Zhao Tianji stopped mid-sentence. He thought of Lu Yaoyao, <em>could Zhao Mingxiao keep people there?</em> “I will get someone to go to Black Wind Island to find her immediately.”</p>
<p>“I will go myself!” Mo Rongzhan said in a cold voice, turned around, and walked towards Shen Yi.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen originally wanted to follow, but Mu Fei grabbed his sleeve, “Huangfu Chen, my sister is also missing!”</p>
<p>“Zhao Mingxiao must know where your sister is. I’ll go with you to find her.” Huangfu Chen then turned his head and said to Zhao Tianji in a low voice, “I’ll leave this place to you.”</p>
