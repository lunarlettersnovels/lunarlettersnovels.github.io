            <p><strong>Chapter 433 – </strong><em><strong>Zhen</strong></em><strong> Wants You (1)</strong></p>
<p>As he looked at her docile demeanour, void of all arrogance and flamboyance she had worn up until now before him, Mo Rongzhan didn’t feel happy in the slightest. Instead, a dull feeling rose in his heart that kindled an evil fire in his mind. He wanted to grab her and chastise her fiercely, yet at the same time, he also wanted to press her under his body and ravage her to his heart’s content. He wanted to make her thoroughly submit to him.</p>
<p>Not knowing what the man was thinking, Ye Zhen still hung her head submissively, waiting for his order.</p>
<p>“It seems that you are very good at being a servant,” Mo Rongzhan said coldly.</p>
<p>“Thanking the emperor for his praise,” Ye Zhen lightly said. He wanted her to recognize her identity, yet now that she followed the rules as the imperial physician attending him, he was not satisfied.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was not appeased by her response. Instead, he became very furious, so much so that his breathing got heavier and he barked, “Get out! Go boil the medicine for <em>zhen</em>!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bowed, wished him good fortune and happiness before going out at once. Still, inside her heart, she fumed. <em>Yesterday, he said that he didn’t want to drink his medicine, but today he deliberately summoned her into the palace to cook his medicine. Isn’t this obviously him trying to torment her?</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Marquis Jing Ning requests an audience.” Eunuch Fu was very cautious and solemn as he reported to his master. He was really unable to make sense of his liege’s rapid change in mood. <em>He obviously wanted to see Her Highness the Princess, yet now that she had come, why did he look even worse than before?!</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Eighth Prince has confessed that he was the one who sent the assassin. However, he claimed that the tiger was sent by Marquis Xinyang… This official has sent people to arrest the former Marquis Xinyang. They wanted to kill the princess and the little prince to take their revenge over the polo match they lost. And… Fifth Prince and Old Prince Kang went to the deposed emperor after they left the palace yesterday ….” Tang Zhen reported in a low voice.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan sneered. “Did the crown prince see them?”</p>
<p>“They still have not seen him, but Old Prince Kang has already surreptitiously contacted the other imperial clans and Deputy General Yang from Xidaying*…”, Tang Zhen said and looked up at Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>[* Big West Camp]</p>
<p>The younger sister of Deputy General Yang used to be the crown princess of the deposed emperor. Later on, because the crown prince spoiled his concubine and neglected his wife, she died an unnatural death. Due to that, Deputy General Yang had a great hatred for the crown prince, which was why he was able to continue being the deputy general in the West Camp even after Mo Rongzhan ascended the throne.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan let a cold smile graze his lips as he commented, “Yang Jing’an? That would be interesting.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, do you want to arrest Fifth Prince and Old Prince Kang?” Tang Zhen asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>Some people in the imperial clans just couldn’t understand that now the world had settled, and Mo Rongzhan was the most suitable candidate to be the emperor in the eyes of both the masses and the soldiers. Who else could bring real stability to the Jin Empire apart from him?</p>
<p>Which people did not want to live in peace and which soldiers liked to fight with their own people every day? It was only because Mo Rongzhan was the emperor that the Jin Empire did not have a rebellion and did not need their own people to fight their own brethren.</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> won’t go to the morning court tomorrow. <em>Zhen</em> wants to see what they want to do,” Mo Rongzhan said, smiling. It was truly too easy to draw the snake out of its hole, making him feel no sense of achievement at all.</p>
<p><em>The snake did come out, alas, it’s a pity that the little snake is too useless.</em></p>
<p>“Understood, Your Majesty.” Tang Zhen responded respectfully. Then, he looked at Mo Rongzhan’s side profile and remembered the conversation he had just had with Lu Lingzhi. If he had directly told the emperor that he wanted to marry Yaoyao, it would be absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth. <em>Seems it’s still better to have Old Madam Lu directly ask Empress Dowager to let Yaoyao marry him. At that time, whether the emperor agrees or not, he still has to consent to it.</em></p>
<p>“As for the fifth prince… put this matter away for the time being… We will talk about it again when <em>Zhen</em> wakes up,” Mo Rongzhan said.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen then left the Palace of Heavenly Purity. Nevertheless, despite what the emperor said, he still went to the fifth prince and watched him attentively. Although this man was no threat, it was still better to be careful.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen boiled the medicine and brought it over. However, she was unwilling to look at Mo Rongzhan’s cold face, so she wanted to ask Eunuch Fu to send it in for her.</p>
<p>“Princess, it’s better if you send it in personally.” Eunuch Fu had learned his lesson, so how could he dare to send in the medicine for Ye Zhen?</p>
<p>“Eunuch Fu…,” she called softly.</p>
<p>He had a bitter expression as he explained. “Princess, if you send it in, the emperor will surely be in a good mood. However, if this slave is to be the one who sends it in, then he is sure to be kicked out.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips. She simply did not want to go in and see his smelly face, but… “Forget it. I’ll send it in personally.”</p>
<p>Back inside the chamber, Mo Rongzhan’s expression frosted over as he listened to the conversation of the two people outside. However, he simply watched on coldly as Ye Zhen came in before he sarcastically snorted, “Why? Aren’t you unwilling to come in and serve <em>zhen</em>?”</p>
<p>“This servant does not dare,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice, putting the medicine on the small table. She then hung her head low and wanted to withdraw.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao!” Mo Rongzhan gripped her wrist and pulled her hard, dragging her to sit on his lap. “Do you want to face <em>Zhen</em> like this all your life?”</p>
