            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 215 – An Unsolicited Wish</strong></p>
<p>Suddenly, the atmosphere had turned even more harmonious. Gone was the awkwardness and inhibitions between a superior and subordinate. If anything, the gap was bridged and the respect for one another deepened.</p>
<p>The empress dowager held Ye Zhen’s hand and led her to the table, pointing to the album.</p>
<p>“Look, how are these girls?” said she.</p>
<p>At a glance, Ye Zhen recognized those girls from various families. Some were from within the capital, others from around the country. They came from a mixed parentage, each with her own virtues; but none of low-birth.</p>
<p>She knew the purpose behind this album, however, why was she being shown these? She had neither the standing nor the desire to be a part of this.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, what is this?” Ye Zhen looked curious, pretending to know nothing.</p>
<p>“This is this year’s Xiunu Album. Aijia has selected several that look good, and they shall be assessed once more when they enter the palace,” the dowager said with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at them carefully and found it interesting that the ladies chosen by the empress dowager were all the ones she had not come across in her past life. After all, in the past life, it was Lu Wushuang who had presided over the Xiunu selection. How could she pick those whose identity and appearance were superior to the wang fei’s? Apart from Liu Hua, who entered the palace without the Xiunu selection, all the others were her rivals.</p>
<p>However, the empress dowager had selected diversely; some had a good social background, some appearance, and some gentle temperaments. In any case, Lu Wushuang would be dumped on the streets soon. By the time these beautiful women entered the palace, Lu Wushuang would not need to be suspicious all day long, thinking that the emperor was interested in other women. Because by then, she would be one among the many wives of the emperor.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, these women are as beautiful as flowers and pure as jade; dignified and elegant. Every one of them is a fine lady,” Ye Zhen said with a smile, eager to find a few more people who could provoke Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>“Aijia feels the same.” The dowager responded with a smile.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, is this Xu Huiru… the second miss of the Xu Family?” Ye Zhen inwardly sneered.</p>
<p>She knew that Xu Huiru was a talented woman and had always been disdainful of others. As Ye Zhen, she had faced her off enough times. She was a perfect opponent to the conniving Wang Fei. In a way, they were the proverbial match made in heaven. If she were to enter the palace, it would not take long for her and Lu Wushuang to turn into sworn enemies. After all, two tigers cannot rule the same mountain.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was in full anticipation of that day. The day when they would fight tooth and nail when their true self would be peeled layer by layer; when they would kill each other– and unknowingly avenge her. She would not even need to lift a finger and…</p>
<p>… yes, she just couldn’t wait to see that day.</p>
<p>“Ahh… yes. This is the second daughter of Prime Minister Xu’s family. Aijia heard that this second miss is the most talented woman in the capital.”</p>
<p>As the dowager uttered the words, she felt nostalgic. She thought of Ye Zhen… her aura and charisma. <i>If Ye Zhen was still here, who could compare to her!</i></p>
<p>When Ye Zhen saw the dazed empress dowager, she called out softly. “Your Highness?”</p>
<p>The empress dowager responded with a faint smile and said, “It’s a pity that you grew up in a border town. If you were in the capital, you probably would have seen what a truly stunning beauty looks like.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, who are you referring to?” Ye Zhen felt a tingling in her heart, she was able to guess who the dowager was referring to.</p>
<p>“Ye Zhen, the late Wang Fei.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager, unlike others, did not take the words ‘Ye Zhen’ as a taboo. She just did not mention it before Mo Rongzhan, but that did not mean she was afraid to mention it at all.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked up at the empress dowager in a stupor. She didn’t expect to pleasantly hear her previous name from none other than the dowager herself.</p>
<p>The empress dowager shook her head and sighed. “Beautiful women suffer unhappy fates. This is probably the case with the young lady. Ye Zhen was quite a fine woman. If only her surname was not Ye… .”</p>
<p>“Being missed Empress Dowager like this, the wang fei… must be immensely blessed.” Ye Zhen lowered her head, preventing the empress dowager from seeing her crimson eyes.</p>
<p>“If she was truly blessed, she would not have been…” The dowager sighed. “There is no use saying these things now. Please accompany Aijia in selecting more fine women.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.” Ye Zhen also felt that it was really inappropriate to talk about her previous identity. She was afraid that the repressed grief and anger in her heart would surge uncontrollably.</p>
<p>After accompanying the empress dowager in selecting more than a dozen beautiful women, Ye Zhen thought about returning to the little prince’s residence. She wanted to go back to make dinner for Mo Rongyi.</p>
<p>“You do not have to worry about your family. Aijia has sent someone to tell your grandmother that Aijia brought you into the palace.” The empress dowager reassured as Ye Zhen was about to step down.</p>
<p>Well, if such was the case, she would be clear of all blame in the matter of Lu Wushang’s confinement. The Lu Family nor the woman herself will be able to fault her.</p>
<p>A grateful Ye Zhen curtsied but hesitated for a moment before saying, “Your Highness, may I go see Wang Fei Lu?”</p>
<p>“What do you want to see her for?” The empress dowager frowned and added. “She has been forbidden by the emperor to step out and no one is allowed to see her.”</p>
<p>“It was because of me that Wang Fei has misunderstood,” Ye Zhen said with guilt.</p>
<p>The empress dowager’s visage was suffused with anger. “If she had not been impulsive, she would have not angered the emperor. Let her reflect upon herself. Aijia will send two tutoring aunts to teach her the rules well during this period.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen asked in a low voice, “Your Highness, will His Majesty hate the wang fei?”</p>
<p>“As long as she mends her ways, how can the emperor hate her?” The dowager smiled and said, “You are still concerned about her.”</p>
<p>“Wang Fei is still a sister of this official’s daughter.” As those words left her lips, Ye Zhen reckoned she still needed to refine her act.</p>
<p>The empress dowager nodded and thought of the contrast between Lu Yaoyao and Lu Wushuang. The matter with Lu Wushuang was not about her family education, but her character. <i>Lu Yaoyao is also the daughter of the Lu Family. How could she be so much better than her?</i></p>
<p>“You need not be responsible for her.” The dowager assured Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>At those words, Ye Zhen revealed a relaxed expression and walked away with her head bowed all along.</p>
