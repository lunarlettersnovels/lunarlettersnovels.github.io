            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 153 – Tumor</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was talking with his cabinet ministers in the imperial study, their discussion surrounding Lu Lingzhi’s expedition to Long Yang to suppress Prince Qiu Liu’s forces.</p>
<p>Prince Qiu Liu <i>was</i> a sovereign prince of the country. Because he gave the First Emperor a stunning beauty, the fatuous emperor granted him the title of a prince as a form of his gratitude. As soon as the First Emperor died, Prince Qiu Liu was quick to take his place <i>but</i> was usurped by Mo Rongzhan after only half a year of his reign.</p>
<p>No doubt, he held a great grudge towards the reigning emperor and had even raised a rebellion a month ago. According to the scouts, he had already taken three cities.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty the Emperor, War Minister Lu once went to battle with you. There’s no doubt that he is brave and good at fighting. It’s just now that he is wounded; I’m afraid that he can’t lead the troops to suppress the rebellion.” Prime Minister Xu frowned, expressing his dislike about Lu Lingzhi participating in the war. Hearing other people’s proposals saying Lu Lingzhi be sent off to war immediately, he naturally objected.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, as far as I know, the injury of the minister is much better now. He won’t have a problem in leading troops to battle.” Another cabinet minister, Liu Zongyuan, spoke in a heavy voice.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi and Tang Zhen represented the forces of the new noble families in the capital, and Prime Minister Xu the dignity of the old aristocratic families. However, everyone knew that the emperor had no favorable impression of those hundred-year-old noble families.</p>
<p>In a bid to please the emperor, Liu Zongyuan supported new noble families who had gained power by helping the emperor during his seizing of the Dragon Throne. Therefore, he convinced everyone that Lu Lingzhi’s injury was not at all a hindrance in his participation in the war.</p>
<p>Several cabinet ministers argued with each other but Mo Rongzhan remained silent. He didn’t speak a word, not until the disagreement took up to a dangerous notch.</p>
<p>“Since Lu Lingzhi’s injuries are almost healed, let him lead troops to the war. As for other generals… I have other plans.” He uttered, breaking the rising uproars of opposing ministers.</p>
<p>“But Emperor…” Prime Minister Xu said, still unwilling to give up his fight.</p>
<p>The rest of his words were not heard for Mo Rongzhan’s gaze lifted, making everyone seem to have lost their tongues.</p>
<p>Ever since he came to absolute power, no one ever thought that he would have such strong governance—intimidating even his ministers. The imposing manner of awe and majesty kept them all from daring to be impudent towards him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Not long after, Eunuch Fu came in. “Your Majesty, the prince has taken his medicine… Only, it was with the help of someone…”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu bowed respectfully and told Mo Rongzhan what Fu Ping had just heard from the little prince’s chambers.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan smiled faintly and looked at the group of old men discussing one last time. He felt bored already. “Accompany me to my brother.”</p>
<p>Since he knew Lu Wushuang was not the little girl who saved him, he had lost his love for her. If not for the fact that she had been by his side all these years and worked hard to fight with him, he wouldn’t even want to see her.</p>
<p>He knew Lu Wushuang had already sensed his coldness, and as such, he ordered several men to watch her every move. Upon hearing that she requested Lu Yaoyao to visit her in her palace, Mo Rongzhan suspected that Lu Wushuang was showing off her cousin, determined to marry her off to any officials inside the imperial palace.</p>
<p>His eyes darkened. From what he heard from Eunuch Fu, Lu Yaoyao was currently inside the little prince’s chambers!</p>
<p><i>Is this charming looking girl as vicious and lecherous as Lu Wushuang?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who was still in the imperial prince’s chambers, did not know that Mo Rongzhan was coming her way. She had a tight frown on her face; her hands were still on Mo Rongyi’s pulse.</p>
<p>“The imperial physician said that you have a cold. Did he mention other problems?” Feeling his pulse, Ye Zhen suspected that the prince’s condition was a lot more concerning than a cold.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi held his chest and said, “It’s just heart disease knowing Liu Hua won’t give me money, my whole body hurts!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gave him a meaningful look. His pulse felt rough, like a knife scraping against a surface, sluggish and unsmooth. What was even more alarming was that it was weak.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen also noticed that he was always covering his chest, which showed that he was suffering from abdominal pain. In her mind, Ye Zhen immediately came up with various treatment methods for his sickness, including his pulse condition and response, all of which appeared in her mind.</p>
<p>These were all written in the medical cases she had read before. However, she felt Mo Rongyi might not believe her.</p>
<p>“Little Prince, the imperial physician who tended to you, who is he?” Ye Zhen asked in a low voice. <i>How come the imperial doctor didn’t notice these?</i></p>
<p>“This prince doesn’t know. The imperial physicians who used to treat me have other things to do, so Wang Fei Lu summoned another imperial physician to see me. What’s the matter?” Mo Rongyi asked absentmindedly, still thinking of the silvers Liu Hua would have to give him.</p>
<p>The silver represented his face.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you ask another imperial physician to take your pulse?”</p>
<p>“If you can’t see what’s wrong with this prince, then let it be. You are not a doctor anyway” Mo Rongyi’s young face was beaming with pride.</p>
<p>“I am not blind, and I do not know whether you believe me or not.” Ye Zhen glared at him. “You always feel pain here and there. Heart disease is not like this.”</p>
<p>Filled with confusion, the innocent face of the prince gazed back at Ye Zhen, his mouth puckered.</p>
<p>“Little Prince, you may have an abdominal tumor.”</p>
