        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 511 – Burning the Village</strong></p>
<p>The number of patients in the village suddenly doubled. Dai Mei, Quan Fu, and the others ignored Xu Ji’s obstruction and ran in to help. Xu Ji threatened to burn the village outside, but Ye Zhen did not even bother with him. She only wanted to cure all those infected.</p>
<p>“Commander Xu, burning the village is no small matter. You’d better think twice,” Zheng Yulong said.</p>
<p>Xu Ji looked at the firewood gloomily. He naturally wanted to burn the entire village, but… Although he could take the risk to burn Lu Yaoyao to death, there was also Huangfu Chen inside. He did not dare to make a move against Huangfu Chen. Who knew how strong the Huangfu Dynasty was? In the past, the Huangfu family had voluntarily abdicated their position, not through coercion or defeat. Now, even the Mo family’s royal family was respectful to Huangfu Chen. If he really burned the man to death, he was afraid…The entire Xu family would be buried with him.</p>
<p>“In two days’ time, if those sick don’t show signs of recovery, don’t blame me for being ruthless,” Xu Ji said coldly.</p>
<p>“How ruthless do you want to be?”</p>
<p>Xu Ji had only just finished speaking when a clear and mellow voice sounded from behind him.</p>
<p>This unfamiliar voice irritated him(XJ), he was very displeased at being questioned. He turned around and glared at the young man. He had never seen him before and his eyes were filled with contempt. “Who are you? How dare you question this commander?”</p>
<p>“You don’t even know me, yet you dare to murder the princess?” Tang Zhen eyed Xu Ji coldly. He had just left Huaijiang City where Imperial Physician Qi had already apprised him about the situation including how Xu Ji wanted to burn Yaoyao to death. She didn’t forget to add how he (XJ) did not care about Yaoyao’s status as a princess. There wasn’t a soul around who wasn’t privy to the commander’s sinister intentions.</p>
<p>“Marquis Jing Ning, I will go into the village to find the princess.” Xue Lin had followed Tang Zhen. What he was most worried about now was whether the princess was injured. The emperor had asked him to stay by her side to protect her. If she were to encounter any mishap, he wouldn’t be able to compensate even with his death.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen also wanted to go in to find Yaoyao, but he still had to teach Xu Ji a lesson, so he let Xue Lin enter the village first.</p>
<p>“Who exactly are you? How dare you look down upon everyone.” Xu Ji wasn’t paying attention when Xue Lin was talking so he didn’t hear him mention Marquis Jing Ning. He saw that Xue Lin had already walked into the village, the rage at being ignored and despised surged within. He immediately went to catch Xue Lin.</p>
<p>Xue Lin turned around and kicked him hard. “If you weren’t the son of Prime Minister Xu, I would have killed you today. You don’t even care about Mr. Huangfu or Her Highness, yet you dare to say that others are arrogant? Even if you don’t know the princess, you should have heard about Marquis Jing Ning, right? I really don’t know what to say.”</p>
<p><em>Marquis Jing Ning, Tang Zhen?</em> A trace of panic flashed across Xu Ji’s face. He looked back at Tang Zhen in surprise. “You…You’re Tang Zhen?”</p>
<p><em>How is that possible! Wasn’t Tang Zhen in the capital? Why would he appear in Huaijiang?</em></p>
<p>Xue Lin snorted coldly and turned to rush into the village.</p>
<p>Xu Ji was no longer able to stop the swift shadow guard. He could threaten Lu Yaoyao because he knew she was not a real princess. The empress dowager and the emperor might not take her seriously now, but Tang Zhen was different. This man was the emperor’s close confidante who was the direct representation of the dragon* himself. It was widely known that the most trusted person in the Sage Realm**, was Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>[* dragon = emperor, ** imperial ministerial cabinet = sage realm]</p>
<p>“Xu Ji, I heard you’re going to burn the princess to death?” Tang Zhen’s smile was cold and terrifying.</p>
<p>“The plague is spreading like wildfire. The people in the village were all infected and died. I did this to prevent it from spreading further.” Xu Ji was nervous, but he forced himself to remain calm.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen stared at him coldly. “So it’s because of the people that Commander Xu wants to burn everyone inside?” Without waiting for Xu Ji to nod, he shouted sternly, “Who gave you the authority? Who allowed you to burn the village? Who allowed you to trap the princess in the village? The princess’ title was personally conferred by the empress dowager. Although she doesn’t belong to the imperial bloodline, she still has the title of princess. You’re just a mere commander, yet you dare to commit a crime. Is this what Prime Minister Xu has taught his good son?”</p>
<p>Xu Ji’s forehead was layered with sweat. He hadn’t received his sister’s message before he planned to burn the village. When he received the message, he had already given the order. He hadn’t removed the firewood because he wanted to scare Lu Yaoyao. He had never expected Tang Zhen to appear here.</p>
<p>“Even if you want to stop the plague, it must be based on the opinion of the doctors. Imperial Physician Qi told you clearly that the plague had improved. Why are you still bent on burning the village?” Tang Zhen did not give Xu Ji a chance to speak and continued to rebuke him in a deep voice.</p>
<p>The people around did not dare to squeak, just watched Xu Ji being reprimanded by Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>Xu Ji’s face rippled with anger. As the son of the prime minister, he was accorded a measure of respect no matter where he went. Nobody had ever dared insult him publicly like this.</p>
<p>“Marquis Jing Ning, I have already said that it was…In order to prevent the plague from infecting more people, and before the princess entered the village, I had already warned her…,” Xu Ji explained.</p>
<p>“Warned?” Tang Zhen sneered. “Xu Ji, it’s really surprising that you actually said these words. You can make any excuse you want. Today’s matter will be decided by Imperial Judgment in the future. You can explain your excuse to the emperor.”</p>
<p>Xu Ji’s expression turned even uglier.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen turned to look at Zheng Yulong. “Lord Zheng, what do you think we should do with the firewood?”</p>
<p>Zheng Yulong hurriedly said,” I’ll get people to take away all the firewood immediately.”</p>
<p>“Marquis Jing Ning, if the plague in the village spreads outside, who would be responsible?” Xu Ji asked loudly, refusing to yield.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen looked at him with a smile. “You just have to be careful not to get infected.”</p>
<p>Xu Ji was enraged. <em>Isn’t he clearly cursing me? </em>But he didn’t dare to say a word. The men in black behind the marquis didn’t look like ordinary guards. He had to restrain himself lest the emperor thinks he was challenging the marquis’ authority.</p>
<p>“Go back and tell Governor-general Zhang that I am waiting for him. Scram!” Tang Zhen snorted and chased Xu Ji away.</p>
<p>“You…!” Xu Ji was so angry that he almost coughed up a mouthful of blood. It was simply humiliating. No one had ever treated him like this.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen ignored him and strode into the village.</p>
<p>Zheng Yulong didn’t look at Xu Ji. Instead, he ordered the soldiers around, “Remove the firewood and oil. Hurry up.”</p>
<p>Xu Ji’s face turned pale as he looked at Tang Zhen’s back. In the future, if he had the chance, he would return all the insults today.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t achieve the goal he wanted, at least his sister’s task had been completed. Lu Yaoyao already knew that she had fallen out of favor, so she shouldn’t be too arrogant when she returned to the capital. His sister’s position in the palace should be more stable. As for Ye Yaoyao, a woman of unknown origin, how could she be a match for his sister even if she became a concubine in the future?</p>
