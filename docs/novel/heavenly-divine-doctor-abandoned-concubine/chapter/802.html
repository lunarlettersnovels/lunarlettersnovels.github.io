            <p><strong>Chapter 529 – She Was Not the One Sick</strong></p>
<p>When Ye Zhen saw Mu Qing again, she was shocked by her haggard and pale complexion. It had only been a day since, why did she look so different?</p>
<p>“Sister Mu, are you all right?” Ye Zhen asked worriedly. Mu Qing didn’t really look good.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, just a little tired.” Mu Qing forced a smile and motioned for Ye Zhen to sit down. “I have already sent someone to call for a doctor, but I didn’t expect Ah Ji to still invite you over.”</p>
<p>Today, Zhao Tianji had specially invited Ye Zhen to treat Mu Qing’s illness.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you look fine at all. Sister Mu, let me take your pulse,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>Mu Qing hesitated for a moment. Yesterday, she had been tossed about by Zhao Ming Xiao a few times. Now, she was really tired. If it weren’t for the fact that she was here to receive Ye Zhen, she would definitely be lying on the bed, not moving at all. “I really don’t want to move. Seriously.”</p>
<p><em>How could a person who was not seriously injured be married for many years without being pregnant?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen promptly placed her hand on Mu Qing’s wrist. She felt that Mu Qing was good at everything but felt that her personality was too frail. She had heard that this was not the case in the past. It seemed that she had changed after marrying Zhao Mingxiao.</p>
<p>When she listened carefully to her pulse, Ye Zhen frowned. “Sister Mu, I heard… You haven’t been pregnant for many years. Have you seen a doctor before?” she cautiously probed.</p>
<p>“I’ve always consulted with a doctor before. He only said that I had a defect in my body, so I can’t have a baby. Perhaps I was soaked in the sea for too long and hurt my body,” Mu Qing said softly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s lips curled into an unfathomable smile. “Is it the doctor Zhao Mingxiao hired for you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, what’s wrong?” Mu Qing asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Sister Mu, your body is fine. Just take a few pills to recuperate, but…” Ye Zhen’s cheeks turned slightly red. Although she had been married to someone once, there were certain aspects she had never experienced. If it weren’t for Mo Rongzhan rushing into her boudoir at night, she wouldn’t know that there could be such a close relationship between men and women. “It’s just that your body is a little weak. It’s better not to be too tired.”</p>
<p>Mu Qing immediately understood the implied meaning. Her face instantly turned red, and a sense of embarrassment surged into her heart. The little girl in front of her was Huangfu Chen’s apprentice, yet she could tell what had happened to her yesterday with just her pulse. This feeling made her feel very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen saw through her awkwardness and did not want to say anything. As for the matter of Mu Qing not having a child, she felt that she needed to go back and tell Zhao Tianji first.</p>
<p>“Sister Mu, I won’t bother you anymore.” Ye Zhen did not stay for long, she could see that Mu Qing was very tired.</p>
<p>Coming out of Mu Qing’s courtyard, Ye Zhen was about to go to look for Huangfu Chen, but she didn’t expect to see Zhao Mingxiao not too far away. When he saw her, his entire being turned very hostile, and he stared at her coldly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt as if she had been stared at by a venomous snake, and her back felt a chill. The handsome young man in front of her, Zhao Mingxiao, was completely different from the one she had met the first time. He seemed to have an even more terrifying temperament.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” Zhao Mingxiao eyed her coldly, presuming that she was here to pass on something to Mu Qing on behalf of Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>“I came to chat with Sister Mu. Perhaps Young Master Zhao is so strict that no one is allowed to see  Sister Mu?” Ye Zhen knew that Zhao Mingxiao wouldn’t like her treating Mu Qing, so she didn’t mention anything about the treatment.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao knew that the girl in front of him was the princess of the Jin Kingdom, and the reason he lost the iron mine this time was connected with her. If Zhao Jia Island really wanted to become a country, it was best that he held Lu Yaoyao hostage. Although Zhao Jia Island was far away from the mainland, it had been listed as part of the Jin Kingdom during the era when Huangfu Xiu* reigned. If he wanted to set up the country, he would have to fight a war at sea with Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>[*We do not know who exactly this is, we are assuming it’s Huangfu Chen’s grandfather or some ancestor of his.]</p>
<p>He was not afraid of being defeated. After all, the people on their island were living on the sea. They were as familiar with battle at sea as they were with food. As for the Jin Kingdom’s army, could they turn the sea into land? Besides, with the princess in his hands, what could Mo Rongzhan do?</p>
<p>As he contemplated, Zhao Mingxiao restrained the killing intent in his eyes and concluded that it would be best to keep Lu Yaoyao around. “Although you are Ah Ji’s guest, you are not allowed to come here!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t quite understand the reason Zhao Mingxiao had suddenly changed his attitude. Now, she was more vigilant towards this man than before. She didn’t want to say too much to him. “All right, I’ll go back first.”</p>
<p>When she returned to her courtyard, Ye Zhen immediately went to look for Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen was not in his room and had gone to Zhao Tianji’s place. Zhao Tianji had just returned and had fallen out with Zhao Mingxiao. He was not in a very good condition on Zhao Jia Island, so he invited Huangfu Chen over as soon as he got back.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen passed through the courtyard to find them but was stopped by Liang Yin because Zhao Tianji and Huangfu Chen were talking in the study. According to Zhao Tianji’s rules, whenever he was in the study, he would definitely be talking about very important matters and would not allow anyone to approach him.</p>
<p>“I need to find my master,” Ye Zhen said to Liang Yin.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, Mr. Huangfu and Island Lord are talking in the study.” Liang Yin had just returned with Zhao Tianji. He knew very well what kind of blow his master had suffered in the hall. His elder brother, who had respected him for so many years, was the one who had framed him. His master must be very sad at this moment.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen could only wait outside. After an unknown length of time, she saw Zhao Tianji and Huangfu Chen walk out.</p>
<p>“Master!” Ye Zhen saw Huangfu Chen and hurriedly ran to him. “I have something to tell you.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen and Zhao Tianji looked at each other, “What is it?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji looked at Ye Zhen and frowned. “Didn’t you go to see Mu Qing? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I came back from Sister Mu. Other than being a little weak and not having a good rest yesterday, I don’t see anything wrong with her body, much less a hidden illness,” Ye Zhen whispered to Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>“Mu Qing isn’t sick?” Huangfu Chen’s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji said, “Have you made a clear diagnosis? If Mu Qing isn’t sick, why has she… been taking treatment and seeing a doctor for the past few years?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked disdainfully at Zhao Tianji. “Sister Mu has been seeing a doctor and undergoing treatment because she thinks she can’t give birth to a child. Giving birth to a child isn’t one-sided. The person with physical problems isn’t necessarily Sister Mu.”</p>
<p>“You mean…” Zhao Tianji’s eyes widened. “Is something wrong with my brother?”</p>
<p>“Sister Mu isn’t sick anyway.” Ye Zhen curled her lips.</p>
