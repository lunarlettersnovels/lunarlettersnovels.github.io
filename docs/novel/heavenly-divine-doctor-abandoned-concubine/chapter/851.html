            <p><strong>Chapter 479 – You Are Not Sick</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong></strong>Zhao Tianji thought that Ye Zhen’s acupuncture technique was taught by Huangfu Chen. <em>Didn’t Huangfu Chen’s medical skills come from his great-great-grandmother, Qi Yanling? Therefore, the Qi needle technique Ye Zhen mentioned was naturally by her master.</em></p>
<p>After about half an hour, Ye Hao gathered all the silver needles. Looking at his pale and bloodless calves with more red dots, she overturned her previous judgment. Zhao Tianji did not contract the frozen disease; if it was cryophilia, acupuncture would not give such a sour and numb feeling.</p>
<p>He couldn’t move. It wasn’t about his bones but his meridians.</p>
<p>“What is Master’s illness?” Liang Yin anxiously asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen immersed the silver needles in a strong liquor while thinking about the cause of Zhao Tianji’s illness.</p>
<p>“Hey, did you hear me?” Liang Yin frowned and shouted when he saw her ignoring him.</p>
<p>“Did you practice internal strength?” Ye Zhen ignored Liang Yin and looked back at Zhao Tianji curiously.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji was waving his hands when he heard the question. His eyes narrowed. “Why are you asking?”</p>
<p>“Because…I think you’re not sick,” Ye Zhen said seriously. “It’s because you injured yourself that you’ve become like this. Back when my master treated you, you’d just learned that kind of internal strength. Later, when you got better, you continued to practice. Am I right?”</p>
<p>“Why would I not be able to move my feet?” Zhao Tianji was surprised. He had never told anyone what kind of internal strength he was practicing. <em>How could this little girl tell?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen furrowed her brows and thought for a moment. “I learned from your pulse. If an evil wind enters a person, the combination of blood and <em>qi</em> will be filled between the muscles and blood, affecting the pulse. There are two kinds of evil winds- cold and dampness. It invades the human body, causing the skin to constrict, the muscles to stiffen, the camp blood to freeze, and the protective <em>qi</em> to dissipate. If I’m not wrong, when your legs could still walk, there was a period of time when you were very moody, right?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji looked at her silently before saying, “Keep talking.”</p>
<p><em>Looks like I’m right!</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen continued. “Evil <em>qi </em>entering a person’s body is divided into two different clinical manifestations of deficiency and actual symptoms. It acts on the five internal organs*. The five meridians of these five viscera are in turn connected to the twelve main meridians in one’s body. When you started practicing the martial arts, you were ignorant of this evil <em>qi</em>. However, it didn’t invade your body in the beginning, just staying on the surface like your skin and hair. Master treated you for a period of time. However, had you stopped practicing right then, perhaps this whole ordeal would have been averted today. It’s a pity, you didn’t. Since it was just the onset of the illness, Master wasn’t able to see through to the real reason for your illness. Nor was there anyone who helped clear it later, letting it seep deeper into your branch meridians. By then, you’d already started to feel uncomfortable yet still didn’t treat it and continued practicing until your meridians, <em>qi</em>, and blood were all blocked. Consequently, your legs took the brunt and were rendered immobile. If this evil <em>qi</em> isn’t purged, the harder it will be for the blood to circulate through your meridians, and sooner or later your entire body will be immobilized.”</p>
<p>[*Five organs of TCM, namely: heart 心[xin1], liver 肝[gan1], spleen 脾[pi2], lungs 肺[fei4] and kidneys 腎|肾[shen4]]</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji kept silent.</p>
<p>Liang Yin and Qiu Yuan exchanged glances. They couldn’t find anything to refute, because what this little girl said… Everything seemed to match.</p>
<p>“That…Can my illness be treated?” Only now did Zhao Tianji take Ye Zhen into consideration. It seems that Huangfu Chen’s apprentice was indeed different.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him. “I don’t know. I’ve never treated such an illness before. I can only…give it a try.”</p>
<p>“How long will it take?” Zhao Tianji asked.</p>
<p>“How would I know? Don’t practice your internal strength or I won’t be able to save you,” she said. Some internal skills could strengthen one’s body but some weren’t right. They could harm one’s life at any time.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji nodded indifferently. “Tell Liang Yin what you need.”</p>
<p>“I need some medicine to remove the evil <em>qi</em> in your body. You need to have a medicinal soak every day,” she said.</p>
<p>“Write down the herbs you need and I’ll prepare them,” Liang Yin said immediately.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen continued, “I can’t do so many things alone. Can you call my maid over and have her help me?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji did not refuse this time. He just glanced at Liang Yin who immediately said, “Miss Lu, I’ll send your maid back in a moment.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll go prepare the herbs. You should rest first. It’s best to relax your hands and feet,” Ye Zhen told Zhao Tianji.</p>
<p>Liang Yin left with Ye Zhen to prepare the herbs. Zhao Tianji sat on the bed looking at his hands.</p>
<p>“Island Lord, do you think… Can you believe Lu Yaoyao?” Qiu Yuan asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Besides her, who else can tell me why I can’t walk?” Zhao Tianji asked back.</p>
<p>Qiu Yuan considered it carefully and felt that it made sense. “Island Lord, I have warned them over there in the iron mine, I will not capture people to come in in the future. The inns in Gujia Village have also been instructed clearly.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can go now.” Zhao Tianji nodded lightly and let Qiu Yuan leave.</p>
<p>“She’s Huangfu Chen’s apprentice. Can you really believe her?” when only Zhao Tianji was left in the room, a woman in black walked out from the corner and asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Why can’t I?” Zhao Tianji glanced at her. “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Eldest Young Master asked me to protect you,” the woman whispered.</p>
<p>“Mu Xue, go back and tell Big Brother that I don’t need his protection,” he said coldly.</p>
<p>“Second Young Master, Huangfu Chen is not reliable, and his people cannot be trusted.” Mu Xue frowned.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji sneered. “Why isn’t Huangfu Chen reliable? Because you’ve caused Mu Qing’s death, do you think he’ll exact revenge on me?”</p>
<p>“My sister is not dead,” Mu Xue said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“To Huangfu Chen, Mu Qing is dead.” Zhao Tianji said coldly, “Since his apprentice can cure me, even if it’s not reliable, I have to try.”</p>
<p>She said, “That woman’s name is Lu Yaoyao, and she’s the princess of Jin Country. If she escapes in the future, everything here will be discovered. Eldest Young Master’s and your efforts will be wasted.”</p>
<p>He said with a smile, “You don’t have to scare me. This iron mine and villa only coaxed me to stay out of his business. Even if this place is discovered, it won’t affect him.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Young Master is concerned about you.” She sighed. “Besides, that’s the princess of Jin Country. She might not be able to treat you wholeheartedly.”</p>
<p>“If she can’t cure me, I will naturally kill her.” Zhao Tianji’s voice was ice cold. “If you dare to make a move on her before I agree, I will definitely make Mu Fei beg for his life.”</p>
<p>Mu Fei was Mu Xue’s brother.</p>
<p>Mu Xue’s expression changed. “Second Young Master, this subordinate does not dare, but this subordinate will stay to protect you.”</p>
