            <p><strong>Chapter 532 – Not Together</strong></p>
<p>The empress dowager pitied Ye Yaoyao because she had lost her memory and thought that she was the emperor’s former savior. So, periodically she would summon her into the palace for a chat. Mo Rongzhan was aware of this.</p>
<p>Since he had yet to find the truth about Ye Yaoyao, Mo Rongzhan’s attitude towards the girl had been uncertain. Although he was suspicious of Lu Lingzhi, for the time being, he had not found any clues to substantiate his suspicions. Ye Yaoyao had really lost her memories, she didn’t even remember who she was let alone what happened all those years ago. So, the first thing he had to do was, help her regain her memories somehow.</p>
<p>“Do you remember anything?” Mo Rongzhan asks indifferently.</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyao timidly glanced at the man and said, “Not yet, the doctor… the doctor said that I still need to continue with the medicine, perhaps I will be able to remember my past with time.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded lightly, lowered his eyes, and looked at Ye Yaoyao’s exquisite and beautiful face. No matter how he tried, he was still unable to associate her with the little girl who had saved him back then. Although there were several signs indicating that she was his Little Yaoyao, there was something that just didn’t seem to fit. His heart inexplicably felt that she was not the one.</p>
<p>“Apart from Lu Shifeng, the man who imprisoned you, have you seen Lu Lingzhi?” Mo Rongzhan asked in a deep voice.</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyao looked at Mo Rongzhan and her cheeks flushed, she twisted her hands together and seemed nervous, “I… I don’t know who Lu Lingzhi is.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s steely eyebrows slightly furrowed. <em>If this matter has something to do with Lu Lingzhi, then I must admit he has done a great job. He must have acted in secret. He was certainly not impulsive in setting this up, because something like this demands careful attention. So, when did he start his plan? Did he know from the very beginning that Lu Wushuang was not the person who saved me back then?</em></p>
<p>Seeing how Mo Rongzhan’s thin lips were pursed, and the man himself was lost in thoughts, Ye Yaoyao felt apprehensive. “Your Majesty, did I say something wrong?” she asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, go and accompany the empress dowager,” Mo Rongzhan said in a light voice, then turned on his heels and left.</p>
<p>Ye Yaoyao was stunned for a while, and by the time she could react, she was only left with the sight of Mo Rongzhan’s retreating figure. For some reason, her heart felt inexplicably heavy.</p>
<p>She had heard that she had saved him before, but the truth was she remembered nothing at all. To this handsome and magnificent man, she was grateful. If not for him, she might have continued to be locked up in that house all day without seeing the sun, and even less likely to have such a life of fine clothes and fine food today. She just did not understand why he was so cold to her.</p>
<p>However, she had also heard that the emperor was like this to all his concubines in the imperial harem as well. What’s more, she had not heard of any concubine being particularly favored by him either.</p>
<p><em>Does he feel there is no woman worthy of his care? I wonder what kind of woman he will dote on in the future?</em></p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ye Yaoyao’s heart raced and her cheeks flushed even deeper.</p>
<p>“Miss Ye, Her Highness the Empress Dowager is still waiting for you,” the palace maid beside her kindly reminded in a low voice.</p>
<p>Only then did Ye Yaoyao hurriedly regain her senses and enter Cining Palace with her head down.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had been trying to find a chance to see Ye Chunming again, and before she could figure out a way, Ye Chunming had already come over to see her personally.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I didn’t have time to talk to you clearly last time, so I waited until today to find you.” Ye Chunming took Lu Yaoyao out of that courtyard and brought her to a remote place by the sea to talk.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew well why Ye Chunming had <em>waited</em> for so many days before coming to her. It didn’t take a genius to know he must have been investigating her life. However, she didn’t know what he had found out.</p>
<p>“Are you mistaking me for someone else? My name is Yaoyao, but I don’t know you, and I don’t know who the little cousin you are talking about is.” Ye Zhen continued to play dumb. Before she knew exactly what this Eldest Brother of hers was up to, she would not divulge any secrets to him.</p>
<p>Although he was wearing a mask, one could still see the coldness in his eyes. He looked her in the eye as he said, “My little cousin is also called Yaoyao, but she was killed by Mo Rongzhan… our Ye family was ruined by Lu Lingzhi… and although your surname is Lu now, you are a descendant of the Ye family… you have an eternal feud with the Lu family.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s face changed slightly. “What do you mean by that? What does the destruction of the Ye family have to do with the Lu family? It is clearly Ye Yisong who had done much evil—”</p>
<p>“Much evil?” Ye Chunming sneered. “Even if he was guilty of many crimes, there was no need to behead the entire family. Your biological father never participated in political affairs. Your elder brother was just a scholar and didn’t even have a job. What wrong did the rest of the Ye family commit? Yes, my father was not a clean official, but how many officials in the whole Jin Kingdom can say they are unimpeachable? Do you know Lu Lingzhi fabricated the criminal evidence against the Ye family and killed your biological sister?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head, her face a little white. “I don’t know! Except you… everyone in the Ye family is dead?”</p>
<p>“Hehe—” Ye Chunming smiled a bit bleakly. “I naturally had a way to escape, just paid a heavy price. Yaoyao, although the Lu family raised you, they are our Ye family’s unalloyed enemies, this you must never forget.”</p>
<p>His father was a traitor, naturally, he had considered the consequences of being a traitor. If Lu Lingzhi hadn’t led people to destroy their Ye family’s secret passages, his father wouldn’t have died at all, and he wouldn’t have been injured in the secret passages and ended up having to destroy his face to survive.</p>
<p>The Ye Chunming who died in the secret passage… was just a subordinate who looked like him.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had a long-standing grudge against Lu Lingzhi, but what she wanted to now know was the whereabouts of her father. “You say I am Ye Zhen’s sister, so… who else can prove it? Where is my real father? Is he dead too?”</p>
<p>“That’s right! I watched him die under Lu Lingzhi’s order, and your brother—” Ye Chunming said in a hateful voice, “Yaoyao, you must remember, the Lu family is our enemy, Mo Rongzhan is also our enemy, and we must take revenge! ”</p>
<p><em>No! Impossible!</em> Since Mo Rongzhan had spared her father and the others. It must be true. She felt that he(MRZ) would not lie to her. “Now the Ye family has long since ceased to exist, you are the only one left, how are you going to take revenge?”</p>
<p>“If Zhao Jia Island claims independence, Zhao Mingxiao will become the emperor of his very own country and I, his prime minister…,” Ye Chung flared with pride and ambition as he spoke, “I’ll be able to exact my revenge then.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sucked a furtive breath. “Zhao Mingxiao wants to claim the country, you encouraged him? No, no, you knew Zhao Mingxiao since a long time ago, those private mines to build weapons, are all for him to use when he claims the kingdom, Ye Yisong and you… have been secretly helping him for years, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“You are really much smarter than Ye Zhen!” Ye Chunming smiled for a moment, then his eyes suddenly turned cold, “If she hadn’t been desperate to marry Mo Rongzhan, that man wouldn’t have had the chance to usurp the throne!”</p>
<p>Although Ye Zhen couldn’t see Ye Chunming’s expression, she could imagine the anger on his face at this moment. “Zhao Mingxiao wants to become the emperor… but put Zhao Tianji under house arrest, what exactly do you want to do?”</p>
<p>Ye Chunming said indifferently, “Zhao Tianji is a good-for-nothing, he can’t become the emperor of Zhao at all, Zhao Mingxiao is the one with ambition.”</p>
