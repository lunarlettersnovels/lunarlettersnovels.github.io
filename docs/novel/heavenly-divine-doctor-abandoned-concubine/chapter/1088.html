            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 240 – Blood Is Thicker Than Water (1)</strong></p>
<p>Qin Fuzi was fuming with anger, glaring at Su Xinmei as he contemplated the destruction of the medicinal herbs in the glasshouse. In the beginning, he didn’t know what the headmaster and his party were trying to point out. Now he understood. These people were aiming at Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“I saw it myself that the two of you were sneaking around in the medicine field. Headmaster, if you don’t believe me, there were even several medicine farmers in the medicine field at that time. Besides, Lu Yaoyao did not have the key anymore. How could she get into the glasshouse?” Qin Fuzi took out the key from his sleeves. “You’d better say: how did Lu Yaoyao get into the glasshouse without the key?”</p>
<p>This time of the day was not without hustle and bustle. Someone would have certainly noticed the comings and goings of people. If Qin Fuzi had been able to spot them, there could be more. And since it was the same day that they were talking about, it would be fresh in their memory.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang turned pale, looked at Su Xinmei, and hastily cried out. “That’s no concern of mine, I don’t have a key!”</p>
<p>Su Xinmei stared at Huang Fuxiang coldly.<em> This idiot!</em></p>
<p>“That’s right! Even if we pursue looking into those who have keys, what does it have to do with my daughter?” Madam Huang cried at once.</p>
<p>“Since Lu Yaoyao’s key has long been handed back to Master Qin, it would not be hard to find out who destroyed the medicinal herbs in the glasshouse.” Qi Jin sneered.</p>
<p>The number of people who were in possession of the key was a hand few, how difficult would it be to narrow down the culprit?</p>
<p>Frightened, Huang Fuxiang grabbed Madam Huang’s arm, and nervously said, “Mother, I have a stomach ache. Let’s return now.”</p>
<p>Su Xinmei shot a glance at her and turned to the headmaster. She was between the devil and the deep blue sea. At one hand was her benefactor, who she could never fall out of favor with and the other was the academy and her ambitions. In the end, she chose the lesser of the two evils.</p>
<p>“Headmaster, this incident… It’s my fault.” She spoke haltingly. “My… my key was stolen.”</p>
<p>“Stolen?!” Qi Jin snorted and continued. “Why didn’t you say so before? Why only now?”</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, I…” Su Xinmei uneasily looked towards Huang Fuxiang.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang almost jumped, her heart palpitated in anxiety. Right now, she was the perfect case of guilty conscience needing no accuser. Su Xinmei hadn’t even mentioned her and she had sprung into self-defense.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at me for? Do you want to say that I stole the key? Su Xinmei, don’t forget, the Huang Family has been good to you.” She issued a veiled threat, reminding her of the consequences.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Huang Fuxiang and smirked. This girl thought people were so stupid as to not see through the farce she was trying to pull? She was determined to unveil her sly little schemes now.</p>
<p>“Can one steal her keys and destroy the medicinal herbs in the glasshouse just because the Huang Family has been good to Teacher Su?”</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, what did you say?” Huang Fuxiang was flustered and frustratedly asked.</p>
<p>“Did you not steal Teacher Su’s key? Huang Fuxiang, Imperial Physician Huang has just said that the destruction of the glasshouse should be settled with the empress dowager. When Jin Wei from the Ministry of Justice investigates what else can be concealed?” Ye Zhen lightly said.</p>
<p>She was no fool. When Lu Qiongqui came to find her last night, she knew that Huang Fuxiang had not admitted defeat. After the fire lotus incident last time, she had long wanted to teach this miss a lesson. Her resolve was further deepened with the archery incident. The one thing she didn’t expect was that Huang Fuxiang would destroy every medicinal herb! How far was this girl willing to go to for revenge? A light punishment would not be enough to quell her anger.</p>
<p>Su Xinmei’s complexion turned white. She knew too well that it would not benefit her if this kind of incident broke out. Perhaps, she would even be expelled from the academy. However, if she put all the blame on Huang Fuxiang, Imperial Physician Huang would certainly not bring her into the palace. And being an imperial physician was her ultimate goal.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, don’t bewitch people with your words!” Imperial Physician Huang said at once.</p>
<p>“What she said is a fact. How can she bewitch people? Even if Imperial Physician Huang won’t report this matter to the empress dowager, this official shall tell her about it,” Qi Jin lightly said.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang shuddered with fear. “That’s no concern of mine. It’s… it’s… ”</p>
<p>Su Xinmei decisively exclaimed before Huang Fuxiang could say anything. “Headmaster, Imperial Physician Qi, I shall take responsibility for this. I’m willing to accept the punishment. After Huang Fuxiang stole my key, I haven’t reported to you on time. I thought she just wanted to visit the glasshouse. I didn’t expect…”</p>
<p>“You lowly servant. How dare you slander your master like this!” Madam Huang bellowed. “It seems that the Huang Family’s dog indeed bites people.” She cursed.</p>
<p>“Silence!” Imperial Physician Huang glanced at Madam Huang and turned to look at Su Xinmei. “Can the key to the glasshouse be stolen at will? You said that Huang Fuxiang stole your key, who is to say if this is true?”</p>
<p>Now that the tables had turned, there was a rift in the union. Blood would certainly be thicker than water, and the pawn was set to be sacrificed.</p>
