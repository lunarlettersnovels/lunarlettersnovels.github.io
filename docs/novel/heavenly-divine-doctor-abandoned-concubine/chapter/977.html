            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 352 –  The Brothers (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Hmm. I’ll have a look.” Mo Rongzhan nodded with a straight face while feeling his personal eunuch knew him better and better; almost too much better.</p>
<p>They had yet to reach the polo field when they heard all kinds of shouts and cries. It seemed the game had entered a fierce battle. Mo Rongzhan deliberately slowed his pace as he walked over. At a glance, he spotted Ye Zhen standing under the arbor. She was happily waving and cheering aloud the little prince on the polo field.</p>
<p>Split into two teams, Mo Rongyi and his friends were in the midst of a match.</p>
<p>When the guards stationed around saw the emperor arrive, they made to kneel. But Mo Rongzhan dismissed them with a wave, so as not to interrupt the game.</p>
<p>He slowly walked over to Ye Zhen’s side, gazing down at her bright and happy smiling face.</p>
<p>“Come on, get away—” Ye Zhen yelled, but Mo Rongyi was too immersed in his game to notice anyone around.</p>
<p>“Oh, how could you let him take the ball away!” Ye Zhen yelled in disappointment. When she raised her hand, she accidentally bumped into the person next to her. She thought it was a palace attendant, but when she looked back, it turned out to be Mo Rongzhan. Someone didn’t react.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her with a smile. “What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“When did you … When did you come?” Ye Zhen asked in surprise, she hadn’t even noticed his arrival.</p>
<p>“I’ve been standing here for a long time now, seeing you wholeheartedly watching the game, I didn’t disturb you,” Mo Rongzhan softly said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen flushed slightly and said, “It’s this subject who is rude.”</p>
<p>“This subject?” Mo Rongzhan frowned and looked at her meaningfully. “It seems that you are not yet very comfortable with your princess status, or could it be that you don’t want to be titled Princess Furong after all?”</p>
<p>“Brother Emperor, it’s just that your imperial sister isn’t used to the title yet.” Ye Zhen laid special emphasis on the word ‘brother’.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan gave a faint smile and turned his attention to the polo field. “How is A’Yi doing?”</p>
<p>Seeing that he didn’t pay her any mind, Ye Zhen was relieved in her heart. Not long ago, she was still thinking about how to pull him down from a high position. Now that he had suddenly appeared, she was worried he would see her thoughts. “A lot better than before.”</p>
<p>“You have been very kind to A’Yi and have helped him a lot. Little wonder Imperial Mother thinks you are his noble person.” He looked at this younger brother who seemed very different from before. He has to admit that Lu Yaoyao has a great influence on him.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen naturally was aware she had indirectly changed Mo Rongyi’s fate. She smiled and said, “Yes, I am very blessed.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan chuckled and said, “I feel very blessed too.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, don’t you need to go through the memorials? Can you be here so… leisurely?” Ye Zhen quirked her eyebrow and looked at him, <em>how could he have time to speak of nonsense with me?</em></p>
<p>“No matter how busy one is, one has to rest.” Mo Rongzhan smiled faintly. “What happened between you and Tang Zhen?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned her head questioningly. <em>What’s going on?</em></p>
<p>“At the Lu Mansion this morning, you seemed to be angry with him?” Mo Rongzhan pretended to casually ask her.</p>
<p>“No.” Ye Zhen pursed her lips, wondering why the fellow was so annoying and the fact that he’d even noticed this.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s heart bubbled with sourness, feeling even more suspicious about her obvious concealment and perfunctory remarks. He said, “Yaoyao—”</p>
<p>He wanted to probe her further, but he had hardly begun when he was interrupted by his little brother.</p>
<p>“Brother Emperor, why are you here?” Mo Rongyi asked aloud happily.</p>
<p>This drew the attention of those others in the field, they as soon got off their mounts and saluted the emperor.</p>
<p>“Zhen came to see you,” Mo Rongzhan said lightly, “continue playing.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi just won a small victory, and he was still excited. “Brother Emperor, you should play a game with us.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that Mo Rongzhan was excellent at polo. If he were willing to teach Mo Rongyi, then they could win more easily in a few days.</p>
<p>“There’s just a few of you, and you still want to beat zhen?” Mo Rongzhan flashed a sly smile.</p>
<p>“Brother Emperor, I am better than before.” Mo Rongyi shouted, and looked at Ye Zhen again. “Yaoyao, you and I will compete with Brother Emperor together.”</p>
<p>Had it been the usual times, Ye Zhen would’ve naturally agreed. However, her injuries were giving her a tough time healing, and the scabs were still there. If she were to ride and play a match today, she would definitely not be able to walk tonight.</p>
<p>But before Ye Zhen could refuse, Mo Rongzhan had already spoken in a low voice, “How can a girl like Yaoyao be as crazy as you? Zhen will play with you.”</p>
<p>No one knew better than him the extent of Ye Zhen’s injuries. After all, he had personally applied medicine for her last night. How would he be willing to let her hurt herself again today?</p>
