<p class="sc-fzoPby lkhcxu leftNav-userRow-userLink-avatar" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 179 – Finding a Cure (2)</strong></p>
<p class="sc-fzoPby lkhcxu leftNav-userRow-userLink-avatar" style="text-align: left;">“This student was the first to hand in her papers. She gave an in-depth explanation about the medicinal herbs from the introductory book.”</p>
<p class="sc-fzoPby lkhcxu leftNav-userRow-userLink-avatar" style="text-align: left;">The corners of Qi Jin’s mouth lifted into a smile. Ye Zhen’s papers in hand, she went through it slowly, word by word. Her mind thought back to the day she had met the girl in the street. A beautiful face, a pair of pure, limpid eyes; a girl who could easily evoke a favourable impression.</p>

<div class="zcg1gr-2 fSCOdt">
<div style="text-align: left;" data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">“This is Wang Fei Lu’s sister. She grew up in a border town. It would be nice if she is really gifted,” Qi Jin said.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Qin Fuzi smiled. “The student seems modest and not impetuous. However, we have to wait and watch if she is feigning it. If she is really as calm and talented as she appears, she is a good prospect indeed.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Mmm.” Qi Jin nodded.</p>
<p>That day was still fresh in her mind. Lu Yaoyao had stumbled upon Xi’er, Qi Jin’s little grandson, in the streets, at the exact time his pain flared up. The days following that, Xi’er had not complained of any pain, in fact, he looked much better than before.</p>
<p>She had been curious about the whole affair. Thus, she asked Xi’er if Lu Yaoyao had given him anything to eat. She was curious to know if Xi’er’s improvement had anything to do with the other girl.</p>
<p><i>If she could alleviate Xi’er’s illness in less than an hour, then this little girl was really not simple.</i></p>
<p>Qin Fuzi pointed to another paper. “This Chen Jinru is also good.”</p>
<p>Qi Jin smiled. “It seems that many good students have been admitted this year.”</p>
<p>“These two students should be in Class A.” Qin Fuzi frowned.</p>
<p>“What is the difference between Class A and Class B?”</p>
<p>Qi Jin flatly stated that she had never thought the students in Class A were really excellent. She was never the one to believe in such illogical disparity.</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi smiled as he said, “How many are as transparent as you?”</p>
<p>Qi Jin smiled faintly. “We are getting on in the years now. It is not easy to find a successor. We cannot be deceived by the surface.”</p>
<p>“If your nephew is in…” Qin Fuzi let out a sigh as he thought of  Qi Jin’s extraordinary nephew. Unfortunately, no one knew which corner of the world he was hiding in.</p>
<p>“Hehe…” Qi Jin chuckled aloud. “Even if he is in the capital, he is not suitable for entering the palace.”</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi knew that Qi Jin did not really want to talk about her nephew, so he diverted the course of the conversation and asked what brought her to the academy.</p>
<p>“I remember you don’t have classes today. Is there not a noble in the palace who is ill?”</p>
<p>Qi Jin frowned and handed over the examination papers to Qin Fuzi. “It is precisely for this matter that I came here, to see if there is any similar treatment method in the medical journal left behind by the late Empress Qi Yanling. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find it.”</p>
<p>“Is it really serious?” Qin Fuzi lowered his voice. “Who is the noble?”</p>
<p>Qi Jin shot him a faint glance. “Master Qin, this is not something you should ask.”</p>
<p>Master Qin smiled. “Curiosity is inevitable.”</p>
<p>“Some curiosity can kill people.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll go first.” Qin Fuz decided to leave her to her research. After all, a life was at stake and he did not trifle with such matters.</p>
<p>Qi Jin acknowledged with a gentle nod. Once Qin Fuzi had left, she retrieved her journal and looked at it carefully. In her life, she had only encountered two most helpless diseases; one was her grandson’s, the other was Little Prince’s.</p>
<p>Little Prince’s illness had come too quickly, she had been caught unawares. If she could not find a cure, she really did not know what to do.</p>
<p><i>Abdominal tumor was not difficult to treat, but why had Little Prince not been cured?</i></p>
<p>Qi Jin carefully compared the medical records according to the symptoms of Little Prince, hoping to find a cure.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the students in the academy had kept her busy, not letting her devote much attention to this matter of the noble. Of course, she was fond of Ye Zhen. She did believe that the little girl had potential, she could be molded. Right now, she is still a diamond that needs polishing. However, she would not rush; she would not approach without really understanding Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>As Qi Jin perused through the chronicles of various diseases, something suddenly caught her eye. This illness seemed to be similar to that of Little Prince.</p>
<p>When she read through the treatment, she was stupefied.</p>
