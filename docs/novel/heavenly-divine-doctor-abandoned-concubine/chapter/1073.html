            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 256 –  Fulfilling Her Wish (2)</strong></p>
<p>Aunt Cheng explained to Ye Zhen in a low voice. “Old Master Jiang from the Jiang Family has been guarding the library pagoda here for decades. It is said that since the previous dynasty, he has been the guardian of the pagoda.”</p>
<p>As for why the guardians of the former dynasty did not change even after the change of dynasties, the reason was unclear.</p>
<p>After ascending to the throne, Mo Rongzhan changed his reigning title to Yuanding. It had been nearly a century since the annihilation of the empire of Jing. Still, all kinds of traces left by Emperor Wu of Jing Dynasty and his empress, Qi Yanling, could be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Old Master Jiang opened the copper lock with two hands, and said to Ye Zhen, “You can read inside, but you must not transcribe or damage any book. You can only use night pearls to read at night, and are not allowed to use oil lamps.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen understood that this was a measure to protect the library pagoda. Given the contents of this building, one errant flicker of light could set the whole place ablaze. Night pearls not only ensured there was light but also no threats of fire. She nodded in response, ensuring the old man that she would abide by the said rules.</p>
<p>“Then go in!” said Old Master Jiang.</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng looked at Ye Zhen and said, “Third Miss Lu, don’t forget to eat, otherwise, Empress Dowager will not let you read books for two days inside.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “I won’t let myself starve to death here.</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng smiled and took her leave.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen could not wait to enter the library pagoda. As she walked in, her hold on the door loosened. She paid no mind to the resounding shutting of the doors for she was shocked by the sea of books before her.</p>
<p><em>How tall! So many books!</em> She had estimated that there would be a good many books here, but never imagined that there would be so many …</p>
<p>The library pagoda was nine stories high. From the first floor to the top of the dome, the pagoda was filled with books. Each floor had its own wooden ladder, reading tables, and chairs. The entire library was well-lit, sunlight seeping through the glass windows. Ye Zhen found that there is a layer of glass outside each bookshelf protecting the books within.</p>
<p><em>No wonder people can’t just come in here. Indeed … this place is breathtakingly stunning.</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen hastened to calm herself down from all the surging astonishment. She did not have much time, so she could not waste it on wonderment. She had to read quickly, there was not a moment to lose.</p>
<p>She ran a quick gaze around and decided to start reading on the first floor. Afterward, she went on to the second floor.</p>
<p>At first, she thought there would be a lot of medical books written by Qi Yanling herself. Now she knew that the books here were not written by her, but rather her collection of books in Baicao Tang.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s mood excitedly stirred up. People thought that the books from Baicao Tang were already destroyed and did not expect that Qi Yanling had collected the books in the palace. Truly, this was a treasure that deserved to be guarded the way it was. The slight resentment she had had earlier over the rule forbidding people from entering, vanished.</p>
<p>Time passed unconsciously. Ye Zhen, with her highly retentive memory, read one book after another wanting to fill them all in her every nook and cranny of her mind.</p>
<p>While the brain was having a feast, the stomach was being neglected. As the sun gradually set in the west, Ye Zhen’s tummy growled in protest. That grumble shook her out of her perusing, she realized she had been at it for most of the day.</p>
<p>“Third Miss Lu, it’s time for dinner.” Someone called from the outside.</p>
<p>Despite spending most of her day in the library, Ye Zhen still felt reluctant to put down the book she was holding. However, delaying her time to dine would probably make the empress dowager decide to let her out of the pagoda depriving her of the pleasure of reading the books.</p>
<p>So, she quickly went out and was taken by the little maid-in-waiting to the house near the library pagoda to have a meal and freshen up. Before the maid-in-waiting could accompany her to the pagoda, she had already returned on her own to read more books as it was getting dark and she did not have a night pearl on hand.</p>
<p>When she arrived in the library pagoda, the scenery that came before her eyes overwhelmed her once again.</p>
<p>It turned out that there were night pearls on every floor of the library pagoda. With the night pearls’ luminescent glow, the library was still as bright as day even after the sun had long bid adieu.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen could not describe her mood at this time. But then again, this was no time to stop and marvel.</p>
<p>She quickly schooled her thoughts, sat down, and began reading books as fast as she could.</p>
