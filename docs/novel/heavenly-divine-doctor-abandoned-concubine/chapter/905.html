<p><strong>Chapter 424 – In Perfect Harmony*</strong></p>
<p>[<em>* 琴瑟和鸣 qín sè hé míng: in perfect harmony; in sync; lit. qin and se sing in harmony</em>]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was preparing the medicated meal. She watched it cook in silence for a while and asked the maid to send for Eunuch Fu. She didn’t want to go into the bedchamber. <em>Anyway, Mo Rongzhan didn’t want to see her. He should be enjoying Xu Huiru’s service at this time. She won’t make him feel bad.</em></p>
<p>“Eunuch Fu, I will trouble you to take this to the emperor.” Ye Zhen said with a smile, “I want to go to the Cining Palace.”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu recalled the weird atmosphere from just then and knew that the emperor and the princess were still at loggerheads, so he agreed. “Princess, this servant will take it in for you.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and nodded. “Thank you for the trouble, Eunuch Fu.”</p>
<p>Watching Eunuch Fu take the medicinal meal away, Ye Zhen left with peace of mind.</p>
<p>When Mo Rongzhan saw the one bringing the dinner in was Eunuch Fu, his expression turned gloomier. “Where is Lu Yaoyao? Why did you bring it?”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu thought,<em> weren’t you just earlier making such a bad face as if you didn’t want to see Her Imperial Highness? Did I do something wrong?’</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the princess said she was going to the Cining Palace.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan snorted coldly. “Put down the meal and get out!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” Eunuch Fu’s expression changed because of his liege’s sudden outburst. After putting down the meal box, he scurried out.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru looked at Mo Rongzhan in confusion, not understanding why he became angry all at once.</p>
<p><em>Could it be… because Lu Yaoyao didn’t deliver the meal in person?</em> With such a guess in her heart, Xu Huiru suddenly felt inexplicably flustered.</p>
<p>“Beloved Concubine, come have a meal with me,” Mo Rongzhan said with a suffocated breath. He just wanted to prove to Lu Yaoyao that even if she disdained him, the women in his harem were still begging for his favor.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru suppressed her anxiety and served Mo Rongzhan even more gently.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was also dining with the empress dowager in the Cining Palace</p>
<p>“Are you going out of the palace?” The empress dowager looked at Ye Zhen suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, I heard that my eldest brother had a poison attack today. The Qijie grass can no longer help him hold his pain back. I… I want to go home and have a look.” This was the only excuse she could come up with, although she couldn’t wait for Lu Lingzhi to die.</p>
<p>The empress dowager hesitated for a moment but felt it was reasonable. She should let Yaoyao go home. After all, she had stayed in the palace for so long because of the accident. The Lu family must be very worried about her.</p>
<p>“On the emperor’s side… There is Xianfei Xu looking after him. He probably doesn’t need me tonight.” Ye Zhen whispered.</p>
<p>“The emperor let Xianfei Xu into the Palace of Heavenly Purity?” the empress dowager asked with some surprise in her voice.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “When I came here just now, Xianfei Xu was still with the emperor in the bedchamber.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager laughed and said, “It seems that the emperor is finally starting to get it. Xianfei Xu has good character. It will be good if she can get along with the emperor.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ye Zhen smiled perfunctorily, inexplicably feeling a bit bitter in her heart.</p>
<p>“Then you go home, Mister Chen said he will enter the palace at night. With him here, there is nothing to worry about,” the empress dowager said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen breathed a sigh of relief. She really wanted to leave the palace. If she had stayed for even a bit more she would have suffocated.</p>
<p>The empress dowager asked palace Madam Cheng to arrange the palace carriage to send Ye Zhen back to the Lu Mansion.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen couldn’t help herself earlier so she went back to her courtyard to freshen up and then went to see Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao?” Old Madam Lu was very surprised when she saw her, her eyes reddened instantly. “Come here, my dear, I can rest assured now that I see you’re doing well.”</p>
<p>Although what happened in the hunting grounds was still hidden for the time being, it could not be kept from the Lu family. Ye Zhen had almost died. Old Madam Lu and the others had found out on the next day. The family had been in fear for two days, if it weren’t for Lu Lingzhi’s poison relapsing, turning her attention away, and the matriarch wanted to go into the palace and take a look at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Pei Shi looked at Ye Zhen excitedly by the side and almost snatched her daughter from the arms of the old lady. “How did you return? We were all worried.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said, “I also wanted to go home early, but there were some delays in the palace.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu touched her cheek. “You have lost a lot of weight. Pitiful child, it’s fine if you are all right. It’s all fine if you are all right.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, is everything ok in the manor?” Ye Zhen asked in a low voice. She wanted to know about Lu Lingzhi’s fate. If he couldn’t die this time, she would be able to torture him anyway. So now she felt that it would be cheap for him to die so easily.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu’s face turned glum. “Your eldest brother was almost on the brink of death today. Fortunately, Imperial Physician Qi called Mister Chen for us, which finally relieved your elder brother’s pain.”</p>
<p><em>Mister Chen?</em> Ye Zhen’s face changed slightly. She was well aware of Huangfu Chen’s medical skills. <em>Would Huangfu Chen be able to detoxify the poison in Lu Lingzhi’s body?<br>
