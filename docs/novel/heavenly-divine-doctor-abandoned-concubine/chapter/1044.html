            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 285 – Seeking Justice (2)</strong></p>
<p>Witnessing the brief exchange, the old madam realized the empress dowager’s hate for Princess Royal. Right then she thanked her foresight for coming to the right place. She doubted if Wang Fei Lu would be even able to say a word let alone lay a finger on the imperial mother-daughter pair.</p>
<p>From the matter from last time, one could see the empress dowager was actually tolerating Princess Royal. Old Madam Lu was aware of the former’s fondness for Yaoyao, but she hadn’t known the extent of it. However, today, she could stand as a testimony to it all. Now that she had delivered the message, she was certain the empress dowager wouldn’t let go of Princess Royal easily.</p>
<p>As for the said princess, who would know a child better than the mother? She knew to the T what her daughter had been up to, why else would she enter the palace this early in the morning? Also, vain as she was she didn’t think that the empress dowager would take the lead for the Lu Family. Who was she after all? She was Princess Royal who had bestowed kindness to none other than the emperor himself. So, even if the empress dowager didn’t necessarily like her, she had to still consider how she had helped this mother and son before.</p>
<p>So, the royalty had sashayed into the imperial palace beaming with confidence. The first one to lodge the complaint would have an advantage after all. In the end, it would be the imperial word against a commoner’s. It was a perfect plan Princess Royal had thought of, except in her smugness she failed to factor in …</p>
<p><em>I didn’t expect her to block me outside the Cining Palace!</em></p>
<p>“The empress dowager won’t see this princess?” Princess Royal demanded of the little maid-in-waiting, feeling extremely humiliated. She was so angry that she wanted to turn on her heels and leave.</p>
<p>Liu Hua hastily took her hand. “Mother, you said you would have Empress Dowager promise me to enter the palace today. If you leave like this, Empress Dowager will not want me to enter the palace.”</p>
<p>Her daughter’s words brought to mind their family’s situation. Her husband hadn’t been having it easy off late, constantly being the subject of the emperor’s censure. Their hopes for a better future now rest on her daughter. If Liu Hua could enter the palace and give birth to a son and a daughter for the emperor, then the mother and son would have to rely on them. Thinking up to her, he reined in her temper somewhat. “I think it’s the bitches of the Lu Family who came to look for the empress dowager, why else would she refuse to see me.”</p>
<p>Liu Hua gnashed her teeth and said, “Really, that cheap Lu Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>“Silence!” Princess Royal glared at her daughter and said, “You are innocent in this matter. No matter what, you must not show any flaws.”</p>
<p>“Are we still afraid of the Lu Family?” A Liu Hua was confused impulsive concluded. She just hated Lu Yaoyao and wanted her to disappear from this world. This was why she had done what she had done. The princess was thoroughly convinced that that darted girl was the reason her life was miserable.</p>
<p>Princess Royal grumpily asked, “Do you want the emperor to think you are a vicious person? If you let slip that it was you who was behind it all,  do you still expect you could enter the palace?”</p>
<p>Liu Hua stomped her foot. “She must die next time!”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t say anything.” Princess Royal glanced at her daughter and once again asked the maid-in-waiting by the door for a reply.</p>
<p>It was a long wait for the mother and daughter. It wasn’t until their hearts were overflowing with a sea of anger and legs numb to the point of collapse, that they were summoned in.</p>
<p>When she went in, Princess Royal first saw Old Madam Lu. With gloomy eyes, the old woman was sitting on a high-back chair, looking in the direction of the door. She instantly realized that the Lu Family had beat her to it and complained first.</p>
<p>“Why has Princess Royal entered the palace?” the empress dowager asked lightly, not giving them a seat immediately.</p>
<p>Princess Royal could clearly see the empress dowager was reluctant to see them. <em>She is just lucky to become the empress dowager. What kind of royalty does she pretend to be in front of everyone!</em></p>
<p>“Empress Dowager, Liu Hua said that she has not come into the palace to greet you for many days, so she came here today. I didn’t expect Old Madam Lu to be around.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager lowered her eyes and looked at the teacup in her hand. “Liu Hua, I heard that you met Lu Yaoyao in Baihua Garden yesterday.”</p>
<p>Liu Hua’s fawning smile froze. “Yes, Your Imperial Highness, I did meet her.”</p>
<p>“So you arranged for someone to abduct Lu Yaoyao?” The empress dowager looked at Liu Hua, her eyes suffused with indifference.</p>
<p>“Wha … what?” Liu Hua blinked nervously. “Empress Dowager, I don’t understand what you mean.”</p>
<p><em>Who cannot see that she is covering up her guilt?</em> The empress dowager’s eyes flashed with disgust. “You don’t understand? The two thugs said that they were instructed by the people in Princess Royal’s mansion to kidnap Lu Yaoyao. Liu Hua, does this matter have anything to do with you? ”</p>
<p>“No!” Liu Hua cried in a loud voice. “Empress Dowager, it’s Lu Yaoyao who slandered me!”</p>
<p>Princess Royal sneered. “How could Empress Dowager not allow me to come in today? It turns out that someone has been telling tales to accuse my daughter.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu snorted coldly. “Whether this is an accusation or not, Her Highness the Empress Dowager shall find out.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say I did it? Do you have any evidence?” Liu Hua asked in a shrill voice.</p>
<p>“The two thugs who escaped have been caught. Empress Dowager, you can send someone to inquire. If this subject is lying, Empress Dowager shall punish her,” said the old madam.</p>
<p>Princess Royal squinted at Old Madam Lu slightly. “Can you guarantee that all confessions made under torture hold water?”</p>
<p>The empress dowager looked at the mother and daughter. “Aijia never meddles with the affairs outside. Since Liu Hua said that she has not done it, let the emperor decide for this matter.”</p>
<p>At those words, Princess Royal’s face changed. The entire capital knew how the emperor hated unruly women most. If the emperor found out that this matter was really related to Liu Hua, would he let her enter the palace?</p>
