<p>“I’m hungry, give me something to eat!” Mo Rongyi, whose eyes are now swollen, cried. He wiped his non-stop stream of tears and ordered Ye Zhen deliberately.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was not impressed, he was indeed a Mo! His tone of aloofness and highness said it all!</p>
<p>“I only have two steamed buns,” she said flatly.</p>
<p>“If you find food for this prince and accompany him to the villa, I will reward you. A hundredfold!” Mo Rongyi straightened up his chest while he bargained with the miss.</p>
<p>He found that the girl was very beautiful. But looking at her dress, she did not seem like a woman from a wealthy family. Now that she knew his identity, she would surely fawn over him.</p>
<p>Yet, the miss sneered, quite different from what he had expected.</p>
<p>“Sister has no time to accompany you. Here are the water bag and steamed stuffed buns. Please leave here after eating.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to leave me here?” Mo Rongyi looked at Ye Zhen in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Yes. What else do you want? ” Ye Zhen asked lightly.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi took a bite of the steamed stuffed bun and said, “You… you must accompany me! I will give you a hundred taels of gold.”</p>
<p>“I am not short of money.” She rebutted.</p>
<p>“That… that…” Mo Rongyi struggled to speak while eating the steamed stuffed bun.</p>
<p>His incredulous little face stared at her whilst he thought how to tempt her. <i>Some people didn’t want gold, then what reward did she want?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen sighed. “When you finish eating the steamed buns, keep walking along this road, you will see Chengde Mountain Villa at the end. I have work to do, so I won’t accompany you.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi hadn’t come up with anything to tempt Ye Zhen and could only watch her figure disappear from his sight.</p>
<p>He didn’t know such a person existed! She clearly knew his identity but was still indifferent!</p>
<p>He finished the two steamed buns and drank all the remaining water in the water bag. Only then did he follow Ye Zhen’s instructions and walk down the road she had pointed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Not long after he left, he met Mo Rongzhan who came to find him.</p>
<p>Looking at his brother’s gloomy face, Mo Rongyi burst into tears. “Brother, I almost died!”</p>
<p>“I see that you are well enough to dare to run away from the capital alone!” Mo Rongzhan scolded. If not for his younger brother looking like a complete mess, he would have brought people over to beat him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi continued to cry, sniffing. “… I accidentally fell into a trap and called out for help! No one came to save me for most of the day. Fortunately, a woman was kind enough to rescue me. Brother, I almost didn’t see you.”</p>
<p>“Then how did you manage to get rid of your attendants?” the emperor asked angrily.</p>
<p>“I will never dare do it again!” Mo Rongyi sobbed harder.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes suddenly fell on the rope around his waist. He squinted slightly. “What is that?”</p>
<p>“This is the rope the woman used to rescue me!” Mo Rongyi exclaimed, pointing to Eunuch Fu. “Fude, come and help me untie this!”</p>
<p>“Bring it here!” Mo Rongzhan looked at the rope and commanded.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu untied the rope and handed it to Mo Rongzhan with both hands.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan touched the knot on the rope in his hand, surprisingly, the knot was done the same way as the girl who saved him… He couldn’t be mistaken, even if he was blind, he knew that only this knot could withstand his weight.</p>
<p>He looked at Mo Rongyi and said, “Where is the woman who saved you?”</p>
<p>“She’s gone!” Mo Rongyi said, “I promised her a hundred taels of gold, but she didn’t want it… What an odd woman!”</p>
<p>“Fude, send the little prince back to the villa.” Mo Rongzhan ordered.</p>
<p><i>Could it be her?</i> <i>There won’t be so many coincidences in this world.</i></p>
<p>He intuitively thought that the girl who saved him must be in the capital… <i>but who is she?</i></p>
<p>He called one of his attendants and said, “Fetch my horse, I have somewhere to go.”</p>
