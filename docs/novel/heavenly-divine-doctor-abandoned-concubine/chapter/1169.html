            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 158 – Did You Call Me A Scoundrel? (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this official’s daughter is only an apprentice, and would be entering the School of Medicine tomorrow.”</p>
<p><i>Let me treat the little prince? Is he jesting?</i></p>
<p>“If it doesn’t work out, you don’t have to go to the medical school.” Mo Rongzhan had a smile at the corner of his mouth and gazed down at Ye Zhen’s eyes, which were full of anger.</p>
<p>Since his appearance, the little girl had kept her head down and did not dare to look at him. If he had not seen her before, he would have thought she was only timid and shy.</p>
<p><i>But, why does he feel like the girl despises him and abhors his very presence instead?</i></p>
<p>Now, because of his cruel words, she looked up at him, therefore, exposing her face.</p>
<p>Her clear black eyes shone with anger and confusion. Today, he found out that her eyes were bright, vivid, and very expressive.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? Do you feel like I am bullying you? “</p>
<p>Although she didn’t speak, her eyes revealed her feelings. Mo Rongzhan found that he could tell what she wanted to say through her eyes. <i>This was very interesting.</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s face showed a dignified and appropriate smile. She answered, unfazed by his mocking.</p>
<p>“The emperor is the Son of Heaven. How can he bully a weak woman? Only a scoundrel would do such a thing.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan raised his eyebrows and said, “Did you call me a scoundrel?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that.” Ye Zhen looked ahead and answered calmly.</p>
<p>“Your heart doesn’t think so?” Mo Rongzhan asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered the scene he saw that night by the hot springs pool. The young girl’s graceful and beautiful body leaped into the water like a mermaid. His eyes squinted slightly and looked at Ye Zhen thoughtfully.</p>
<p>With no trace of fear, Ye Zhen looked at him in the eye while saying, “Does the emperor have to care about what other people think?”</p>
<p><i>It is simply baffling! </i></p>
<p><i>She didn’t know before that Mo Rongzhan had such a shameless side.</i></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan recognized Ye Zhen’s welling anger towards his taunts and couldn’t help but laugh. “Just because I asked you to cure the little prince, you are already livid?”</p>
<p>“I have no complaints.” She would be foolish to admit that she had complaints in front of the emperor.</p>
<p>“Since you can cure Minister Lu Lingzhi’s leg injury in a short period of time, can you treat the little prince’s disease?” Mo Rongzhan asked her sincerely this time.</p>
<p>“What if it doesn’t work?”</p>
<p>“Then, I will punish you,” Mo Rongzhan said simply, in his usual apathetic manner.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that he was challenging her. Ye Zhen stared at Mo Rongzhan, who was far from what she knew before. She thought he would not bother to embarrass a woman like her.</p>
<p>“Don’t you accept?”</p>
<p>The girl before him flushed with anger but refused to say a word. If she lowered her head and begged for mercy, he might not be interested in teasing her anymore. Yet, this wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>She looked stubbornly at him and didn’t cower even for a little.</p>
<p>The more he saw her refusing to bow, the more he wanted to test her limits.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled patiently. “Thank you very much for your respect. This official’s daughter will do her best to cure the little prince.”</p>
<p><i>She actually agreed?</i> Mo Rongzhan pressed his lips tightly.</p>
<p>When he met her in the Chengde Mountain Villa, he had thought she was deliberately trying to attract his attention. Later he found out that she was not like other women, who laid traps for him desperately.</p>
<p>Instead, Lu Yaoyao was intentionally avoiding him like plague. She was, without a doubt, very different from Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan could not tell whether he looked at her differently because of her beautiful appearance or because she was also nicknamed Yaoyao. However, he knew very well that as long as Lu Wushuang was still a high-ranking imperial concubine, he would never let another Lu woman into the palace again.</p>
<p>Only, Ye Zhen seemed to have exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>Lu Yaoyao was admitted to the School of Medicine. According to the rule of the Academy for Women, the palace would select two women from the School of Medicine every year to become imperial physicians in the imperial palace.</p>
<p><i>Will she be chosen to enter the palace in the future?</i></p>
<p>Upon this thought, Mo Rongzhan somehow felt strange about himself. <i>Why did he care anyway?</i></p>
<p>Apart from his mother and the little girl he met in the woods when he was still a blind teenager, he never cared about any woman except Lu Wushuang, whom he would not even let into the palace if she hadn’t faked her identity.</p>
