            <p><strong>Chapter 410 – Has Something Gone Wrong? (1)</strong></p>
<p>Together, Eunuch Fu and two eunuchs helped the emperor change his pants as well while Ye Zhen and Qi Jin both looked away.</p>
<p>By the time everything was ready, Tang Zhen had also brought Huangfu Chen over.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at the wounds on Mo Rongzhan’s back, then at Qi Jin with astonishment. “Aunt, you have stopped A’Zhan’s bleeding so quickly?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t me. Yaoyao had stopped the bleeding even before I saw him. I just helped clean the wounds,” Qi Jin said. Honestly speaking, the reaction of surprise she had had inwardly had been the same as Huangfu Chen’s. With the state of the emperor’s wounds, it was extremely difficult to stop the bleeding. If the bleeding hadn’t been stopped already, even if Qi Yanling were here, he wouldn’t be able to live.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at Ye Zhen with astonishment, didn’t ask any more questions, and lowered his head to treat the wounds on Mo Rongzhan’s back.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was already exhausted. But she still didn’t dare leave, in fear that something else would happen to Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you’ve been through a lot today. Go back and rest first,” Tang Zhen said to Ye Zhen quietly.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>The empress dowager and Mo Rongyi walked in at this time. She had already gotten news of everything from her younger son. Seeing Yaoyao standing near the bed, she immediately walked over to hug her. “Good child, it is enough that you all could come back.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, His Majesty got hurt… to save me…..” Ye Zhen leaned into the empress dowager’s warm embrace, speaking with a lump in her throat.</p>
<p>“I know. This isn’t your fault. I will have people investigate as to who was trying to harm you all. I won’t let him off easily!” The empress dowager said in a chilly voice, a will to kill appearing in her eyes for the first time.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi held back his tears. If it hadn’t been for Yaoyao, he probably would have died by the tiger’s mouth today. If it hadn’t been for his Imperial Brother arriving in time, he probably would have been killed by the assassins as well. It was only today that he understood how useless he was, still needing others to risk their lives to protect him.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother….” Ye Zhen wanted to keep on speaking.</p>
<p>“Don’t say anything else. Aunt Cheng, first take the princess to wash up and rest. Clean the blood from your body, and have a good night’s rest,” The empress dowager said, patting Ye Zhen’s head.</p>
<p>♚♚♚</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen had helped treat Mo Rongzhan’s wounds, but despite it all, the monarch still remained unconscious.</p>
<p>Under the express orders of Empress Dowager, Ye Zhen had been forcibly taken away to rest. She had wanted to head back to the Palace of Heavenly Purity as soon as she washed clean of the bloodstains and changed into a fresh set of clothes but right then Lady Cheng walked in with a bowl of nerve-calming soup. Not long after she had downed the contents, she was hard-pressed to keep her eyes open. And before she knew it, she had swiftly drifted to dreamland on the couch she was sitting on.</p>
<p>Lady Cheng pitifully gazed at the slumbering girl before turning to report to the empress dowager.</p>
<p>The empress dowager was still presiding over matters in the Palace of Heavenly Purity. Mo Rongyi had been sent back to the prince’s residence.  The news of the emperor being injured by the tiger had already been contained. As such, not a word had leaked to the outside. But the monarch still had to attend the morning court meeting the next day. They had to find an excuse for the public.</p>
<p>“First invite Mister Xu and Mister Liu into the palace,” the empress dowager quietly instructed. The news of the emperor’s injury could not be concealed from the Inner Court. Of those officials, only Prime Minister Xu and Liu Zongyuan were most trusted by the emperor. So news must be first announced to them.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu immediately left after receiving the order. As of the present, many things needed to be attended to personally by him. This was a critical time and they couldn’t afford to trust anyone else.</p>
<p>Right at this moment, Lady Cheng walked in and bowed to the empress dowager. “Your Imperial Highness, the princess drank the nerve-calming soup and fell asleep. She wanted to come over as she was worried for the emperor.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen, who was standing to the side, lowered his head at the words, his eyes filled with gloom.</p>
<p>“That poor child… She was quite frightened and feels that the emperor has only been injured because of her. She is probably very hurt inside. Let her rest well now. If it hadn’t been for the emperor today… she might already be killed by the tiger’s jaws,” the empress dowager said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is fortunate that the emperor got there in time, saving the little prince and the princess,” Lady Cheng said.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had only wanted to look for Ye Zhen initially. How would he have allowed for Ye Zhen to hunt with Tang Zhen? Not long after he entered the hunting grounds, he ran into the man himself.</p>
<p>Marquis Jing Ning had already discovered peculiarities in the forest and knew that something was different from the usual, so he joined the emperor in looking for Ye Zhen and the others.</p>
<p>Halfway there, they ran into Hong Ying. She was wreathed with injuries courtesy of the assassins and on her way to spread the news of the attack. Mo Rongzhan and the others wasted no time rushing over, subduing the assailants swiftly. They had only just wrapped up the battle when a sobbing Mo Rongyi rode over on his horse. This was how everything else came about.</p>
<p>“Marquis Jing Ning, you must clearly investigate the matter of today. No matter who the directing party is, I will have him pay the price.” The empress dowager had almost lost two sons today, how could she not hate the mastermind behind this?</p>
<p>Tang Zhen bowed and received his orders. “Yes, Your Imperial Highness.”</p>
