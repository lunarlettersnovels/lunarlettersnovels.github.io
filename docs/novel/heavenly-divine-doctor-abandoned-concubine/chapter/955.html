            <p><strong>Chapter 374 – I Am Her Sister (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you are not Lu Shiming’s daughter… Whose daughter are you?” Mo Rongzhan composed himself, quietly asking her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen closed her eyes and remained silent.</p>
<p>“If you don’t tell me, I will make Lu Shiming tell me.” Mo Rongzhan turned to leave, seeming to be preparing to go after Lu Shiming.</p>
<p>“No one knows about my birth.” Ye Zhen opened her mouth. “No matter Lu Shiming or Lu Lingzhi… neither of them knows.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan stopped in his tracks, looking back at her. “You were raised by Lu Shiming.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I lived on the frontier from the time I was young. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t know about the details of my birth.” Ye Zhen coldly looked at him. “Your Majesty, I am the daughter of the person you hate, the twin of the Ye Zhen you despise. Do you still want me? Do you still want to give up your harem for me?”</p>
<p><em>She was Ye Zhen’s sister!</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her with shock, “Yaoyao…”</p>
<p>“I am just a weak girl who cannot do anything. I am already guilty that I cannot avenge my family. How could I then ever be in a relationship with you? Your Majesty, are you not afraid of the fact that I would kill you in the middle of the night?” Ye Zhen coldly asked.</p>
<p>“Will you kill me?” Mo Rongzhan looked down at her, persistent and sincere.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at his cold, sculpted face. She had never thought about killing him because she was aware of the fact that she did not have the ability to do so.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I won’t force you to do anything,” Mo Rongzhan said softly in her silence.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned away. She had revealed her origins today because she had no choice. You could even say that she was placing a wager because if she said nothing, Mo Rongzhan would never let her loose again.</p>
<p>As of today, she could only hope that Mo Rongzhan wouldn’t kill her because of her identity.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to kill me?” Ye Zhen looked at him with suspicion.</p>
<p>“Why would I kill you?” Mo Rongzhan softly laughed. “Yaoyao, the people I kill are those who deserve to die.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed coldly inside. <em>Those that deserved to die? What had she done wrong then, that he would think she deserved to die?</em></p>
<p>But, she didn’t ask, smiling slightly. “Then I’ll thank Your Majesty’s merciful grace.”</p>
<p>“There is no one in the Lu Family who knows of the details of your birth. How did you become Lu Shiming’s daughter in the first place?” Mo Rongzhan asked.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sat in the corner, hugging the blanket, her still alert eyes still staring at Mo Rongzhan. If she hadn’t found it inevitable, she wouldn’t have been willing to tell him about the details of her birth.</p>
<p>“Ye Zhen and I are twins. Just after we were born, a Taoist priest proclaimed that we sisters were born to counter each other. Unless one were to die, both of us were to die an untimely death,” Ye Zhen said deceptively.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s gaze landed heavily on her. “Then how did you find out about your identity?”</p>
<p>“My father left people to take care of me secretly, and never told me about my birth. It was later when the Ye Family ran into trouble that I finally found out,” Ye Zhen said quietly, “I don’t want anyone else to know about my identity.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao—” Mo Rongzhan looked at her with a complicated look. “There is too much evidence for the Ye Family’s guilt. I was unable to spare them the slightest bit of mercy at the time, do you understand?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s gaze was cold and clear. She shook her head. “I don’t understand. There are so many people in the Ye Family. Were all of them guilty? My father was just a simple scholar. What wrong did he do?”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao—” He wanted to explain but stopped himself. There were some things that were best if they stayed secret forever. Moreover, although he hadn’t killed Ye Yiqing and his son, he didn’t know where they were now. Even if he were to reveal it now, she still wouldn’t believe him.</p>
<p>“That’s all I want to say. What else do you want to ask?” Ye Zhen interrupted him, in fear that he would say something again about keeping her next to him. She really just wanted to stuff his face with something to make him shut up.</p>
<p>He reached out, wanting to touch her face. She hurriedly avoided him, the vigilance in her eyes multiplying a hundred times over. He laughed bitterly. “Is the reason you hate me so much the Ye Family?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” She immediately nodded. “I’d think that you wouldn’t want the person sleeping next to you to be your enemy’s daughter.”</p>
<p>“You’ll understand me eventually,” he said quietly. He wouldn’t give up on her so easily. It was just that he didn’t want to force her into a relationship with him while she still despised him.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised an eyebrow and looked at him. “Did you sneak into my room at midnight before?”</p>
<p>The curves of Mo Rongzhan’s lips rose into a light smile. “If I wanted to have you, why would I wait until now? Yaoyao, I want to have your consent.”</p>
