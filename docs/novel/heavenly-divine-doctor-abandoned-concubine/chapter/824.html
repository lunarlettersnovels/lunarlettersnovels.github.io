        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 507 – Huangfu Chen Falls</strong></p>
<p>Everybody was shellshocked. They didn’t expect Xu Ji to really carry a knife to kill people. The doctors and villagers inside the fence and the crowd standing outside, couldn’t believe that the commander had actually killed people.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned and looked at Xu Ji. She knew that this was the norm in the military. She didn’t feel threatened because she was used to solving problems with a knife. But now, in the case of the spread of the plague, not all problems could not be resolved through violence.</p>
<p>“Who dares to come out?” Xu Ji coldly demanded.</p>
<p>“Commander Xu, enough is enough,” Ye Zhen warned in a low voice.</p>
<p>Xu Ji looked at Ye Zhen disdainfully, seemingly despising her feminine benevolence.</p>
<p>No one dared to clamor about coming out again. Neither the doctors nor the villagers. They all stood there blankly, not knowing what to do next.</p>
<p>“If I catch the plague…” a villager looked at Xu Ji fiercely and said, “I must get out of here and let more people catch typhoid fever. If I die, I die; but I want someone else to bury me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right!” The others nodded too.</p>
<p>They had given up, and if they weren’t given a way out, they were going to kill more people.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was horrified in her heart. She said to Zheng Yulong, “Lord Zheng, they are not infected with typhoid fever. In fact, you can let them come out, place them in the medical bureau, and we will determine individually whether they have an infection or not. They can get back to normalcy after a few days of isolation…”</p>
<p>Before she could finish, Xu Ji coldly interrupted, “What if they catch typhoid fever after they come out? It wasn’t easy for the city to cure the sick of typhoid fever. If the plague were to be introduced into the city again, who could afford it? You? Lord Zheng?”</p>
<p>Zheng Yulong looked grave as he stared in the direction of the village. He didn’t know what to do. Just as he was in a dilemma, a loud shout came from the village.</p>
<p>“Not good, not good!” A young doctor ran over. “Huangfu…Huangfu Chen is infected with typhoid fever!”</p>
<p>These words were like a stone thrown into the calm water, immediately stirring up a thousand waves.</p>
<p>“Even Huangfu Chen has been infected. We definitely can’t avoid it,” someone exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Let us out!”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen could no longer take care of these people. Anxious over her master’s condition, she quickly walked over and pulled the young doctor back. “What did you just say? How did my master get infected with typhoid?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Huangfu hasn’t rested. He was the one who fed the patient the medicine. Today, I saw that his complexion was not good, so I advised him to go back and rest. Two of them died just now. I went to check on him only to discover that his entire body was burning…” The young doctor’s voice was trembling.</p>
<p>If even Huangfu Chen could not avoid being infected, would they still be able to save their lives?</p>
<p>“I want to go in and find my master!” Ye Zhen turned around and said coldly to Xu Ji.</p>
<p>Xu Ji said, “Anyone who goes in can’t come out unless there is no one infected.”</p>
<p>When Dai Mei heard that her young lady wanted to enter the village, her face turned pale in fright. “Young Miss, you can not enter!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said, “Imperial Physician Qi is still in another village. I can’t leave Master alone. I’ll go in and treat Master first.”</p>
<p>“Miss Lu is indeed kind.” Xu Ji originally wanted to stop her, but when he recalled his purpose in coming here, a meaningful smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>“Miss, this servant is begging you, you cannot enter.” Dai Mei was at the verge of tears. “Brew the medicine, and this servant will deliver it to Mr. Huangfu.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen grabbed her hand and brought her to the side. “Right now, I can only trust you. Dai Mei, you should stay here and brew the medicine for me. There are two porcelain bottles here. You need to pour at least half a bottle of medicine into a pot. Remember, this is an important medicine that must not be forgotten.”</p>
<p>Dai Mei choked and hugged Ye Zhen’s arm. “Miss, if there’s anything you need, what should this servant do? You can’t go in.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll come back safely.” Ye Zhen touched her forehead. “Trust your miss.”</p>
<p>“Miss—” Dai Mei sobbed.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen reminded her to put the spiritual spring from the porcelain bottle into the medicine. Only after she received an affirmation from Dai Mei did she walk towards Xu Ji. “Commnader Xu, please let me in.”</p>
<p>Xu Ji smiled coldly. “Miss Lu, are you sure?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You can let those who didn’t fall sick out first. You can also put them in isolation. However, they probably won’t want to be trapped in the village anymore,” Ye Zhen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Alright, let her in.” A fierce sneer flashed across Xu Ji’s eyes.</p>
<p>Zheng Yulong said, “Commander Xu, it’s not good if this continues. Let those people come out. We’ll quarantine them in the medical bureau.”</p>
<p>Xu Ji thought about it and nodded. “Alright, let those who don’t have typhoid out first.”</p>
<p>With his words, everyone became excited. Even those who had decided to stay in the village were moved. They had originally put all their hopes on Huangfu Chen. Now that he was sick, who could they count on?</p>
<p>Could this little girl be able to cure dozens of typhoid fever patients? They didn’t believe it. If they didn’t leave at this point, they would be infected sooner or later.</p>
<p>The doctors in the village all left. Other than Huangfu Chen, who had a high fever, there was only Ye Zhen who had just entered.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stood at the entrance of the village and watched as those people ran out like they were running for their lives. She sighed in her heart.</p>
<p>Xu Ji looked at Ye Zhen and said, “Miss Lu, if you are regretting it, you can still come out. You can ignore whether Huangfu Chen is dead or alive”</p>
<p>“I will definitely bring my master out safely,” Ye Zhen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Go to the other village. If thee is anyone who isn’t infected, let them come out too,” Xu Ji ordered.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said angrily, “How many people are willing to treat those patients?”</p>
<p>“If we don’t do this, more and more people will catch the plague!” Xu Ji said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him and turned to walk into the village. She wanted to find Master first. No matter what, she couldn’t let anything happen to Master.</p>
<p>The two villages were not far from each other. When the people over there heard that Huangfu Chen was also sick, they were all panicking and clamoring to leave. Xu Ji allowed all the people who were not sick to come out, and only Qi Jin and Xia Yaohua remained inside.</p>
<p>“Lord Xu, what should we do next?” someone whispered to Xu Ji.</p>
<p>Xu Ji sneered and said, “Wait another two days. If no one gets better….”</p>
<p>Then he wouldn’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>Zheng Yulong had already instructed the soldiers to send the people from the village to the medical bureau. He failed to notice Xu Ji’s unusual behavior.</p>
