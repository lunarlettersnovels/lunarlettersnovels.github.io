            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 187 – Do You Resent Me? (1)</strong></p>
<p><i>Miss Lu does look like a fairy. Most of all, she resembles… the late Wang Fei Ye. Is it really possible for two people to look so alike? </i>The eunuch couldn’t help but think so.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stood still with eyes looking at Eunuch Fu in wonder. “Where to?”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu was slightly taken aback. There was hardly a soul who did not know he was the emperor’s person. He would invite people at the behest of the Imperial Palace. Naturally, he was here to invite her to the Imperial Palace.</p>
<p><i>Why did Miss Lu ask?</i></p>
<p>“Miss Lu, Little Prince requested for you,” Eunuch Fu said.</p>
<p><i>Mo Rongyi?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen got anxious but her heart was inexplicably relieved that Mo Rongzhan was not the one looking for her. The meeting with him in the Imperial Palace the other day had brought a lot of trouble. Before she had finally attained the position of an Imperial Physician, she did not want to be in unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p><i>Is something the matter with the little prince?</i> Ye Zhen eventually came about as she remembered that awkward tangled youngster. <i>He wished to see</i><i> me? Why is Eunuch Fu seeking me?</i></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu turned aside and motioned Ye Zhen to leave with him.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen found Eunuch Fu too quiet,  and thought it must be inconvenient to tell her here. Regardless, she would know when she sees Mo Rongyi.</p>
<p>The carriage was parked outside the medicine field. There were no students around. Before Eunuch Fu arrived, all the students were driven away. Perhaps some people did not want the news of Ye Zhen’s invitation to the Imperial Palace to be known.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was very satisfied with this arrangement. She wanted no one to know that she had entered the Imperial Palace, especially Lu Wushuang. Even if she had nothing to do with Mo Rongzhan, she did not wish this matter to reach the WangFei’s ears.</p>
<p>When she got on the carriage, Eunuch Fu vaguely said that the little prince wanted to see her, because he was unwell and the empress dowager heeded his request.</p>
<p><i>What happened to Mo Rongyi?</i></p>
<p>The last time she entered the Imperial Palace, she knew that he was sick and uncomfortable. The empress dowager had also said that she would ask another imperial physician to treat him.</p>
<p><i>Is he not better yet?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen suddenly had a bad premonition. She fell into deep silence, trying to recall the news about Mo Rongyi in the two years she was trapped in the Imperial Palace.</p>
<p>During the two years of wandering in the Imperial Palace as a spirit, there was almost no news about Mo Rongyi. But then again, her every moment had been spent in anger, loathing and following Mo Rongzhan like a shadow.</p>
<p>She had never concerned herself with other people’s whereabouts. She was so consumed in the betrayals and blows that were served to her on a platter, that Ye Zhen was left with little interest in anything else.</p>
<p><i>How long could Mo Rongyi live?</i> Ye Zhen was troubled by the question. She had no recollection of the matter to ease her worries.</p>
<p><i>Will his sickness persist? </i>Her musing came to a halt when suddenly the little prince’s forlorn but dignified face came to her mind, and without hesitation, Ye Zhen went to visit the Imperial Palace.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu could not help admiring the young lady he was accompanying. He had been around the emperor for quite a long time now. He had met his fair share of young ladies of the wealthy families, but none were as calm as Miss Lu. With a sense of propriety, she did not pry on things she was not involved in.</p>
<p>Steady and self-aware, was how he viewed this young lady. In terms of appearance and bearing alone, she looked better than the Wang Fei! Unbeknownst to him, the more he saw these qualities, the more he admired her.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen reached the Imperial Palace, she was taken aback. She thought she would be taken to see Mo Rongyi immediately. Unexpectedly, she would have to meet the emperor first.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>In the pavilion in the emperor’s courtyard, exuding an air of regality, Mo Rongzhan stood with his hands behind his back. He was wearing a black robe with wide sleeves on which was embroidered a five-clawed dragon. The afternoon sun fell on him, highlighting his full grandeur. His facial features were as clear and beautiful as a carefully chiseled sculpture. His eyes, intimidating dark pools, had always made people dare not look straight at him.</p>
<p>Seeing Mo Rongzhan, Ye Zhen immediately became cautious. In front of this man, she refused to let her guard down.</p>
<p>“This official’s daughter greets the emperor.” Ye Zhen stopped right outside the pavilion and curtsied, hoping that Mo Rongzhan was not waiting for her.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan stood on a raised platform and had to look down at Ye Zhen who was reluctant to come forward. His eyes were unpredictable, and the surroundings were strangely quiet, that even Eunuch Fu was afraid to breathe loudly.</p>
<p>Today, Ye Zhen was dressed in an ivory-colored short jacket and wore simple makeup. Despite the plain clothes, her beauty and jade-like skin stood out. She looked ethereal.</p>
<p>“Come here.” The emperor commanded in a deep voice.</p>
<p><i>Is he .. going to talk to me? What is there to talk about?</i> Ye Zhen was reluctant, but she slowly walked up to the pavilion and waited for Mo Rongzhan to speak.</p>
<p>“Did you make a wager with the little prince that you can cure him?” Mo Rongzhan’s voice was slightly heavy, looking coldly at the girl in front of him. He was scrutinizing her, not wanting to miss even the slightest reaction.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was stunned for a moment, looked up at Mo Rongzhan in surprise, and made sure that he was not teasing her.</p>
<p><i>When did I bet with the little prince?</i></p>
