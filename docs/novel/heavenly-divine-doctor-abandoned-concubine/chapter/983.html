            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 346 – Return to the Capital (2)</strong></p>
<p>Jinwu City.</p>
<p>The scene from when Lu Linghzhi was being tormented by the poison was etched in Lu Shiming’s mind. As such, he didn’t waver and the next day, took more people to look for Qijie grass.</p>
<p>This made Ye Zhen very nervous. She was worried that Tian Jiu would still be taking shelter in the mountains and could get caught. On the off chance he were caught, what would happen then?</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, did I hurt you yesterday?” Lu Lingzhi asked, looking at Ye Zhen who was standing by the door, with a voice that was full of fatigue.</p>
<p>“No,” Ye Zhen faintly said, not even willing to look him in the eyes.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi rubbed his eyebrows and said, “This is the first time I was attacked with poison, and just like you said before, I truly couldn’t bear it. Now I know how painful the subsequent days are going to be.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned around and looked at him with indifferent eyes. “When you were attacked by the poison yesterday, did you know what you did?”</p>
<p>“What did I do?” Lu Lingzhi asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>“You held me and kept saying you are sorry.” The corner of Ye Zhen’s mouth twitched lightly into a sneer as she continued. “You said sorry to Ye Zhen. But… Aren’t you unfamiliar with her? What have you done to make you apologize to her?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s originally wan face worsened as he exclaimed loudly, “You heard me wrong!”</p>
<p>“Really?” Ye Zhen simply smiled and did not persist. It seemed Lu Lingzhi himself felt sorry for her. Otherwise, he wouldn’t apologize to her when he was delirious.</p>
<p><em>But what was the use of that now?</em></p>
<p>A complicated look in his eyes, Lu Lingzhi stared at his beautiful and elegant younger sister’s profile in a daze. With her here, it was hard for him to not think of Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until evening that Lu Shiming came back with the Qijie grass. Even then, they had only found two after having dug through the entire mountain.</p>
<p>“Father, did you only find Qijie grass today?” Ye Zhen asked, feeling a little nervous for fear that they might have found traces of Tian Jiu in the mountain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lu Shiming said, “It’s already good to find two Qijie grass.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we have looked through every nook and cranny of the mountains, but couldn’t find more than these two.” Luo You also added from the side.</p>
<p><em>It seems Tian Jiu and the others have left the mountain!</em> Ye Zhen breathed a sigh of relief before she said, “These two grasses are already enough to support Eldest Brother for now. So, let’s get people to go to the south and look for more there.”</p>
<p>In half a month, Lu Lingzhi’s injury gradually healed. And though the poison had yet to be completely cleared, he was able to walk around. The Qijie grass was almost used up. It was now that Qi Jin asked them all to leave for the capital.</p>
<p>Two days ago, the troops that went to suppress Xifan had returned to the capital, and the Prince of Xifan had also accepted the emperor’s punishment. Meanwhile, Lu Lingzhi and his family spent another ten days on the road to return to the capital.</p>
<p>Lu Linghzhi had alost a lot of weight and appeared ver pale. Old Madam Lu’s face turned sour at the sight of her dear grandson. She knew very well that his injury was not a trivial one like the people made it to be. Fortunately, she had experienced a lot of things through the course of her life and thus was able to stay strong and appear firm on the surface.</p>
<p>However, unlike the old madam, as soon as Liu <em>shi</em> saw her son, she cried loudly. Her voice was full of grief. Old Madam Lu’s face turned black. Without hesitation, she ordered people to take Liu <em>shi</em> back to the house, so they would not lose face outside.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, grandson has worried you.” Lu Lingzhi was indifferent to Liu <em>shi’s</em> grief, but his eyes, as he looked at the old lady, were gentle.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu took his hand and said, “It’s good that you are back.”</p>
<p>“Mother, it has been a long journey on the bumpy road. Let my nephew go back in first to take a rest.” Lu Shiming suggested, afraid that Lu Lingzhi’s poison would relapse at any moment and scare the old lady. After all, today should be the seventh day since the last time the poison flared up and it could erupt any moment. Moreover, he had yet to have the Qijie grass, so his screams could be louder than usual. As such, it was better to get Lu Lingzhi back to his courtyard as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu didn’t hesitate either and said, “Quickly send the marquis back to his room to rest.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen simply stood by and looked at Lu Lingzhi, who was escorted in, with expressionless eyes. Qijie grass could not be used to relieve the pain for a long time. Sooner or later, it would be useless. What would he do then? She couldn’t wait to find out.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you must be tired, too. Go freshen up and rest as soon as possible,” Old Madam Lu said thoughtfully when she looked back and saw that Ye Zhen had thinned a full circle.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I don’t want to be a hindrance.” Ye Zhen was indeed very tired from looking after Lu Lingzhi inside the carriage these past few days. Honestly, had it not been for Imperial Physician Qi’s presence, she would not have cared about his life or death.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu didn’t know her thoughts, so she simply said, “I heard you were taking care of your eldest brother all along the way. How can you not be tired? Go back to your room and rest. We’ll talk tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the darkening sky and considered. By the time they returned to the capital, it was already dark. And Lu Shiming still had to go to the palace and report to the emperor. However, her legs were already sore and in pain. In addition, she had to endure Lu Lingzhi’s presence throughout the journey for the last few days as well, which was more exhausting than anything else. As such, she easily acquiesced and said, “Then, I’ll go back and take a rest now, Grandmother. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Well, go on!” Old Madam Lu said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen greeted others before going back to her yard with Hong Ying. Looking at the freshly lit lantern in the Lu Mansion, she revealed a smile that was as soft as silk.</p>
<p><em>If Lu Lingzhi fell, the Lu Family would fall with him!</em></p>
