            <p><strong>Chapter 545 – There Will Be No Debt</strong></p>
<p>“Have you checked it out? If she hadn’t saved you back then and had a relationship with you, why would she marry you?”</p>
<p>Hearing his indifferent tone, Ye Zhen’s expectations were annihilated little by little. She knew that he wouldn’t believe it. In his heart, Ye Zhen was probably the same as Ye Yisong, a very heinous existence.</p>
<p>“Enough!” Mo Rongzhan stopped her curtly. “I don’t want to hear this name again, you are Lu Yaoyao, my future empress, don’t always try to make me feel guilty about another woman. I may owe others in this life, but to Ye Zhen, I will never owe anything in my life!”</p>
<p><em>Only to Ye Zhen… will you never owe anything in your life?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen stared at him blankly. <em>So in his opinion, Ye Zhen’s fate was all her own fault? He has no guilt at all…</em></p>
<p>She was still delusional to make him stop misunderstanding herself, she thought that she would be able to close her eyes to the death of the previous life. Sure enough, she had expected too much.</p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan, you must remember what you said today.” Ye Zhen’s pale face revealed a bleak smile. “You must not regret it.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan didn’t like her smile as if she wanted to push him to a distance of 108,000 miles, he reached out and hugged her back in his arms. “Yaoyao…”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen avoided his hand, the sadness on her face turned into indifference. “Your Majesty, this cave is very strange, and there are many weapons next to it, I think you should be very interested. Oh, yes, besides you, is anyone else here?”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen it all,” Mo Rongzhan said and looked at her expressionless little face.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Ye Zhen replied lightly, “Then I’ll go rest. Your Majesty, your clothes are soaking wet, there is a fire here, you can hang your clothes by it.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan grabbed her wrist and lowered his eyes to stare down at her. “What else are you dissatisfied with about me?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed and said, “How can I be dissatisfied with you? I am so grateful that Your Majesty came to save me in person, and I really can’t repay it.”</p>
<p>“How can there be a balance*?” Mo Rongzhan lightly pecked her pink lips, trying to tease her, “You can promise me with your body.”</p>
<p>[*无以为报 wú yǐ wéi bào- unable to return the favor]</p>
<p>“Your Majesty…” Ye Zhen frowned and turned her face away in disgust.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan lowered his head, wanting to chase her lips, holding her waist with his big palms and pulling her into his arms. “Back in the capital, I have decreed you to become the county princess*, Yaoyao, I don’t want to wait any longer.”</p>
<p>[*Jun Zhu, those interested can read here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_and_noble_ranks_of_the_Qing_dynasty"><u>Royal and noble ranks of the Qing</u></a>]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wanted to avoid his kiss, but there was no way to retreat. He kissed her lips again while his hand reached under her clothes.</p>
<p>“Don’t!” Ye Zhen struggled to escape. She wished she could hide further, how could she be willing to let Mo Rongzhan touch her?</p>
<p>“Miss Lu…” Liang Yin’s voice came from outside.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was overjoyed to hear someone come.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan bit her earlobe lightly and said, “Yaoyao, this is the last time I will let you go.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen saw the determination to win in his firm and resolute eyes. She knew, clearly, that if it wasn’t for Liang Yin’s voice, he might have taken her here and now. At once, she felt both sullen and ridiculous. He abhorred Ye Zhen so much but was as much if not more determined to win her. If, in the future, he came to know that she was Ye Zhen, would he come to hate her as well?</p>
<p>“Yeah, the last time.” She smiled. She wouldn’t have any extravagant hopes for him in the future.</p>
<p>Liang Yin had finally found this place, he looked at Ye Zhen in surprise. “Miss Lu, you are here!”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan glanced at him lightly and hugged Ye Zhen. “Since we can’t leave, let’s stay in the cave. There is food outside, you and Old Master Jiang should grab a bite, we will make plans at dawn.”</p>
<p>“Yes…” Liang Yin looked at Mo Rongzhan in surprise. <em>How could he be so close to Miss Lu?  Isn’t Miss Lu a princess? Even if he’s a real brother, it should not be like that. When I came in just now, I thought I saw Mo Rongzhan kissing Lu Yaoyao… Did I see it wrong?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned, stared at Mo Rongzhan, and demanded, “Where are you going to carry me?”</p>
<p>“I saw a few clean kang* rooms when I came here. Let’s rest there tonight,” Mo Rongzhan said gently.</p>
<p>[*traditional heated platforms, check link <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_bed-stove"><u>Kang Bed Wiki</u></a>]</p>
<p>He didn’t give Ye Zhen a chance to refuse, simply carried her, and walked out. He quickly found the location of the kang room, and slammed the door shut.</p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan, what do you want to do?” Ye Zhen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Go to sleep, we can leave at dawn.” Mo Rongzhan glanced down at her. Her fair and jade-like skin was the most obvious with two black circles under her eyes. Obviously, she hadn’t rested well in the past few days.</p>
<p><em>I really want to have her, but it can’t be at this time, let alone here.</em></p>
<p>He put her on the kang bed and said, “Although this place is simple, it seems to shelter from the wind and rain. You should have a good night’s sleep… I will be by your side to watch over you.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was speechless. She watched him take off his clothes and put them aside, then sat down with his back to her, and never looked back at her. She could only see his broad and strong back, faintly. The light fell on his wheat-colored skin, and she could vaguely see the scars on his body.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and turned away from looking at him. Even if her heart was moved, it was already in the past.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan waited until he heard a long breath before turning around. He lowered his eyes to look at her sleepy face, which was obviously very tired, and gently kissed her temple. “Little girl, what should I do with you?”</p>
<p>He wanted to marry her… to make her his empress… but he knew that barriers still existed between them. She had put Ye Zhen as the reason for her disappearance; perhaps he had to give Ye Zhen posthumous imperial honors before she would accept him? All these years of his life, he had never thought that he would back down so many times in front of a woman, even disregarding his own well-being, merely to see her safe and sound in front of him once again.</p>
<p>He would take her back to the capital this time and would not give her another chance to back down. Even if she had yet to open her heart, he would keep her by his side. Only by becoming his empress would she no longer disappear without saying a word.</p>
<p>He was afraid… If there was another time*, he may never see her again.</p>
<p>[*where she left or if he waited any longer]</p>
<p>After a while, Mo Rongzhan heard a slight noise outside. By now, his clothes were almost dry from the impact of the internal energy. He gently opened the door and found Jiang Ashi waiting for him at the entrance not far away.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan stepped forward and said, “Old Master Jiang, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“In addition to getting a lot of weapons and food, this old one also found a cellar where coins were made. If we hadn’t happened to go to Zhao Jia Island and given Zhao Mingxiao two more years, he would have definitely become a big enemy,” Jiang Ashi said quietly.</p>
<p>“Zhao Mingxiao could achieve all this in just a few years?” Mo Rongzhan said with a frown. If it were true, then he was really an opponent to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Jiang Ashi shook his head and said, “Not necessarily. This cave has been around for more than 20 years, I’m afraid… someone in Zhao Jia Island has been silently at work here… As for who that person is, it’s hard to say.”</p>
