            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 168 – A Dangerous Existence (1)</strong></p>
<p>Rather than leaving, Lu Wushuang stood firm in her spot and looked at Mo Rongzhan with some grievance.</p>
<p>Her show of reluctance made Mo Rongzhan look up at her again. “Wang Fei, is there anything else?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, are you still angry with this wang fei?”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang walked closer to him. She did not want to leave like this. She could not stand him treating her so coldly.</p>
<p>When Lu Wushuang was still living in the border town, when her whole family was still solely merchants, she saw the emperor riding his horse, donning a black armor one day. His natural, domineering aura and deep eyes had attracted her immensely. She could not help but fall in love with him, but he was always so indifferent that even if her eldest brother was already his confidant at that time, he did not acknowledge her.</p>
<p>Later, she learned from Lu Lingzhi that Ye Zhen had saved his life when he was still a child, and this, the emperor was yet to know.</p>
<p>Therefore, seeing this as an opportunity, she claimed that she was the one who saved him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan actually believed it and began to take notice of her. She had never seen him so gentle to anyone as he was soft on her. She was addicted to this special treatment and asked her eldest brother to tell her more details about Ye Zhen’s rescue of the emperor.</p>
<p>Back then, the person she loathed the most was Ye Zhen. If Mo Rongzhan knew that Ye Zhen had saved him, he would certainly be kind to her and finally withdraw his attention from Lu Wushuang. <i>Thankfully, Mo Rongzhan hated Ye Zhen, and therefore, Ye Zhen did not have the chance to reveal the truth of her identity.</i></p>
<p>Lu Wushuang, in envy and hatred, wanted Ye Zhen to die as soon as possible. She was fortunate for she had a brother who would do anything for her happiness—Lu Lingzhi killed Ye Zhen, the person who treated him as her dearest friend.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan did not know what Lu Wushuang was thinking at this time. “I am not angry.” He once again told her.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang woke up from her musings, looked at the emperor’s handsome side profile, and felt pain in her heart. “Emperor, I will not do that again.”</p>
<p>Still, even with the sincerity and determination in her voice, Mo Rongzhan’s face remained hard as a stone.</p>
<p>“Well, you are Wang Fei and therefore, should act like one.”</p>
<p>“When I heard that Your Majesty was going to appoint another concubine, I felt despondent. Only when Princess Royal provoked me did I finally lose control.” Lu Wushuang explained, merely looking at his face, looking for traces of his love for her.</p>
<p>She found none.</p>
<p>“If you feel that way now, you will be even more devastated in the future.”</p>
<p>Since Mo Rongzhan was now certain that Lu Wushuang was not the little girl he met before, every time he saw her, he was reminded of his mistake.</p>
<p><i>Why did he believe what Lu Wushuang said?</i></p>
<p>The little girl in those days was so charming, soft, and lovely that even if he could not see her, he should have known by the tone of her voice that she could never be Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty…” Lu Wushuang did not notice the flash of anger in Mo Rongzhan’s eyes, she was too shaken by his words.</p>
<p><i>What does he mean? Is he going to keep having wives? Does he not love me anymore?</i></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan frowned, and his dark eyes dispensed only bitterness for her. “I do not want to repeat what I have said. I am busy. Go back now.”</p>
<p>His imposing manner overwhelmed Lu Wushuang. Even if she wanted to question him further, she did not dare to speak.</p>
<p>She curtsied and said, “Your Majesty, this wang fei will leave now.”</p>
<p>From the imperial study, Mo Rongzhan did not spare her a look again.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang’s eyes glistened with tears. She almost ran back to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, her heart surging with bitterness and hurt.</p>
<p>“Those wenches!” Once she arrived in her chambers, Lu Wushuang vented her anger by smashing the quilts and pillows on her bed to the ground.</p>
<p><i>All those shameless women want to seduce the emperor, especially Liu Hua, who can not wait to be a concubine!</i></p>
<p>An expensive ceramic vase collided with the wall and shattered to the floor.</p>
<p><i>If it were not for them, why would the emperor want to take another concubine so soon?</i></p>
<p>“Wang Fei, please calm your anger! Do not be so hard on yourself!”</p>
<p>Dai Ping, her maid-in-waiting quickly withdrew all the other maids serving and put away the mess Lu Wushuang had made.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang sneered. “I fear there will be no place for me in this palace soon.”</p>
<p>“How can that be? The emperor likes you the most. Even if other women enter the palace, you will be his most-favored.”</p>
<p>Dai Ping had been serving Lu Wushuang since she was a child in the Lu Family, and she knew her temperament better than anyone else. Therefore, she comforted her the best she could.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang shook her head gently and murmured. “No, the emperor is different to me now…”</p>
<p>“Why, the emperor has no other concubines in the palace except Wang Fei. In what way is he different towards you?” Dai Ping urged.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang suddenly remembered Lu Yaoyao, who had entered the palace today. Mo Rongzhan’s smile on her when they were alone in the imperial garden became engraved in her mind. She suddenly sat up straight.</p>
<p>“Have you sent a message back to the Lu Family? I want to see my mother.”</p>
<p>“Old Madam has just entered the palace today, so this maid will go to the Lu Mansion first thing in the morning tomorrow and ask Eldest Madam to visit Wang Fei.”</p>
<p>“You will come out of the palace tomorrow with the seal of our palace. Then you will say that I only want to know how the eldest madam is doing.” Lu Wushuang instructed.</p>
<p>“Yes, Wang Fei.” Dai Ping hurriedly agreed.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang looked sullenly out of the window. She must take precautions. No matter whether Lu Yaoyao meant anything to the emperor, or not, she would not let her cousin have a chance to enter the palace as a concubine.</p>
<p>She did not know if she was just overthinking, but she felt like Lu Yaoyao… would be a dangerous existence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>In the Lu Mansion, Ye Zhen woke up, feeling excited about what this day had to offer. She had slept peacefully and woken up in high spirits. Especially when she found that the red spots on her face had disappeared, her mood became a lot better.</p>
<p>Today, she would take another journey—she would finally be attending the Academy for Women. She got up early, afraid to be late.</p>
<p>She went to greet and say goodbye to Old Madam Lu first. It would take her about five or six days to come back.</p>
<p>Then she went to Lu Shiming and Pei Shi to bid goodbye and met Lu Xiangzhi on her way back.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I wanted to take you to the academy today, but I have to go to Master Xu. But do not worry, Eldest Brother offered to accompany you instead,” Lu Xiangzhi said to Ye Zhen with some guilt on his face.</p>
<p>To ease his feeling, Ye Zhen motioned with her hand and said, “It does not matter. The academy is not far anyway. You need to study with Master Xu.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi patted his sister on the shoulder. “Our Yaoyao is really getting more and more sensible.”</p>
<p>“I am already very sensible!” Ye Zhen gave him an angry look. Deep inside, she was a little surprised that Lu Lingzhi would accompany her.</p>
<p><i>Should he not be preparing to go to the war?</i></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was already waiting for her outside. His foot injury had not completely healed, so he would not ride a horse but would sit in the carriage with Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, come, we should go.” Was the first thing he said upon seeing her.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked a bit askance, finding that the redness and swelling on her face had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Before getting into the carriage, Ye Zhen smiled at him and gave him a sincere bow.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother.”</p>
