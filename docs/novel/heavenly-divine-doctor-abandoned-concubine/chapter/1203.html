            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 124 – Four A’s</h3>
<p>Ye Zhen took the test card from the teacher. At this moment, there were three A’s of which one was written shakily, and two B’s. There was no doubt that she would enter the Academy for Women.</p>
<p>She looked at Princess Liu Hua with a faint smile and knew that the other party must be unconvinced, but so what? Her drum dance completely met the examination standard. Did they expect her to beat the drum with both hands when they saw Lu Xiangzhi bring out a huge drum? Music is not only about musical instruments; dance is also a big part of it.</p>
<p>“Princess Liu Hua, are you still not convinced?” Ye Zhen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>The princess hissed and scornfully looked at her. “How dare you use the teacher’s fear for the dean to have your third A? So shameless!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “Dancing is part of the musical art, don’t you know?”</p>
<p>If Princess Liu had not bought the two teachers, how could she meet trouble today? Ye Zhen didn’t want to argue too much with Princess Liu Hua before, but now she was forced to do so.</p>
<p>“If you can get an A in mathematics, then this princess will finally be convinced!”</p>
<p>There was only one subject left that she had to take and it was Mathematics.</p>
<p>“Very well.” Ye Zhen nodded. She had planned to take only three A’s, but now she had to take another in order to convince the princess and the people.</p>
<p>All the people behind looked at Ye Zhen in silence, amongst whom Xu Huiru felt the deepest emotion.</p>
<p>Her greatest rival in life was Ye Zhen, who was superior to her in talent and appearance. When the news of Ye Zhen burning to death in her own palace came out, she thought that she had finally lost her strongest opponent and that no one in the capital could compete with her anymore.</p>
<p>Who would have imagined that another girl named Lu Yaoyao would crush her hopes? What’s more, she looked exactly like the late wang fei!</p>
<p>She heard that Lu Yaoyao was a wild girl who grew up in a border town. Naturally, she deemed that the wild girl who let Princess Liu Hua humiliate her was a native turtle. Only when she saw her today did she feel fear; her temperament and appearance are hard to forget.</p>
<p>What worried her the most was that Lu Yaoyao was not at all stupid and ignorant as Lu Jing and Liu Hua claimed her to be! Not accounting for her good looks, today’s dance was already enough for her to impress the present people of the capital who would then spread words of her talent and beauty.</p>
<p>After an Ye Zhen, now a Lu Yaoyao came posing a threat! How could Xu Huiru feel better?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t like Mathematics, but it had not been a problem for her to obtain an A. When four A’s appeared on her test card, Princess Liu Hua was livid beyond words. Her face scrunched up; no words could describe how pathetic she looked.</p>
<p>“Princess Liu Hua, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>One to twenty, she made a fortune this time!</p>
<p>“Impossible!” She lost her voice and cried; she could not believe Lu Yaoyao got four A’s. “Didn’t you just learn <i>The Thousand Character Classic</i>?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I didn’t say I could not count to nine.” Ye Zhen cocked her head and made a witty remark.</p>
<p>The princess’ shoulders trembled with anger; her stunt brought her great humiliation instead. In the coming months, she would be the talk of the capital.</p>
<p>To rub salt on her wound, Ye Zhen gave her a cheerful look. “Princess Liu Hua, tomorrow I’ll send someone to your house to collect my money. I must go home first.”</p>
<p>With that, she turned on her steps.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu!” Mo Rongyi stopped her. “This prince is going to hunt, and you’ll go with him!”</p>
<p>Despite the child’s forced authoritative voice, his eyes shone pleadingly.</p>
<p>“Not today, Your Highness. I must hand in this test card to the academy. Thank you for your help today.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen curtsied to the little prince. If Mo Rongyi had not been here today, she would not have been able to get four A’s this easily.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen whispered to Mo Rongyi, “His Imperial Majesty is still in the hunting ground… “</p>
<p>It was only then that Mo Rongyi remembered that he had just seen his brother here. He quickly looked back behind him, but Mo Rongzhan could not be seen anymore.</p>
<p>“Well, next time, this prince will compete with you!” Mo Rongyi said loudly. He could not wait to join his brother now.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t want to go hunting, but she could not refuse Mo Rongyi at such a time. Anyway, she would just find an excuse when that day comes.</p>
<p>“All right, Your Highness. Best of luck!” Ye Zhen bid him goodbye.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen gave her a deep look. “Yaoyao, you finally got what you wanted.”</p>
<p>She faced him and stepped closer, his towering height not intimidating her in the least.</p>
<p>“My wish hasn’t been fulfilled yet. When my wishes come true in the future, Marquis Tang will come back and say this to me again.” Her face showed no warmth all.</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen felt bitter in his heart. Since that day he had a dispute with her about the Ye Family, he felt that she had become increasingly estranged from him.</p>
<p>Looking at the shadow of Mo Rongyi and Tang Zhen drifting away, Ye Zhen took the test card and handed it to the academy teacher.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, how many A’s have you got?” Chen Quiping saw Ye Zhen come to hand in her test cards and immediately approached her to inquire.</p>
<p>Since the appearance of Tang Zhen and Mo Rongyi, more and more people had paid attention to Ye Zhen’s exam. Like Lu Jing and Lu Fang, they followed Ye Zhen all the way. Only the Chen Sisters lost track of Ye Zhen as they were busy reuniting with their friends.</p>
<p>As soon as they saw Ye Zhen, they hurried over to her bearing forlorn faces and planning on comforting her.</p>
<p>“Four.” Ye Zhen happily replied.</p>
<p>In fact, she didn’t feel happy about the four A’s, but she must show great joy so as to be more like Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Chen Liping was stunned. “How many again?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got four A’s from equestrian, archery, music, and lastly, mathematics.” Ye Zhen put on a delighted smile. “I think I am really lucky.”</p>
<p><i>How is that possible?</i></p>
<p>The Chen Sisters exchanged bewildered glances. Both only had three A’s when they took the exam. <i>How did she manage to get four? What sorcery is this?!</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen had already changed back to her original clothes and was handing her examination cards when she saw Lu Xiangzhi coming up.</p>
<p>“Brother, thank you for today.” She brightly thanked Lu Xiangzhi for bringing the huge drum for her.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi laughed and rubbed his sister’s head. “You do not have to thank me. This brother is happier than anyone else!</p>
<p>Chen Qiuping soon recovered and urged her sister to congratulate Ye Zhen. “Yaoyao, congratulations, you finally got into the academy!”</p>
<p>Waving her hand gently, Ye Zhen laughed. “That’s an early congratulations. I still have to get a letter from the academy but thank you.”</p>
<p>The former empress had also come up with the Letter of Admission. Even if the examination results were out whether she could enter the school depended on whether she would receive the letter.</p>
<p>Chen Liping pouted and said, “You’ve got four A’s. If you will not receive a letter, it will be a mistake.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen leaned on her side. “Brother, do you have somewhere else to go? If it’s all right, can you accompany me home?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Yaoyao should go back home first, we will wait for your sisters here.” Chen Liping agreed.</p>
<p>Since the moment Ye Zhen got four A’s, Lu Jing and Lu Fang had been missing, and even Princess Liu Hua and her maids had disappeared.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bid farewell to the Chen Sisters and went back to the Lu Mansion with Lu Xiangzhi.</p>
<p>“Brother, don’t forget the bet. If Princess Liu Hua has a bad memory, remember to remind her that she lost 40,000 taels of silver to me. “</p>
<p>“When did you become a money addict?” Lu Xiangzhi lightly poked her on her forehead.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised an eyebrow and said, “When I knew I would lose one to ten.”</p>
