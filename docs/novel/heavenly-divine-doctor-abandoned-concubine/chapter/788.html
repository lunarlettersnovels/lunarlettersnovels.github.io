            <p><strong>Chapter 543 – Yaoyao, I Am Here</strong></p>
<p><em>Crackling——</em></p>
<p>The dark clouds on the horizon were extremely low, and lightning lit up half of the beach as thunder rumbled on. On a lonely island without a soul in sight, the lights in the cave were weak and footsteps reverberated.</p>
<p>Even though Ye Zhen was not a timid person, there was still fear in her heart. She didn’t know when the storm would stop let alone when she would be able to leave this place.</p>
<p><em>What happened to Zhao Jia Island… Have Zhao Mingxiao and Zhao Tianji turned against each other? Who will be victorious?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen found herself weak and lonely for the first time.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound outside the cave again. She huddled in a corner and wrapped herself with a quilt. In front of her was a pile of dry firewood she had gathered… as if it would make her feel warmer and drive away the fear that was setting in.</p>
<p>At this time, Mo Rongzhan, who was even more anxious than Ye Zhen, was sailing toward the island.</p>
<p>They didn’t know how bad the weather was until they went to sea. Even with Liang Yin, who was good on water, their fishing boat was like a leaf struggling to stay afloat. Mo Rongzhan couldn’t imagine how exactly his little girl spent her time on Black Wind Island in such a storm.</p>
<p>“Have we arrived at Black Wind Island?” Mo Rongzhan squeezed out a sentence from his tightly pursed lips. He was already trying his best to control himself, even though the anger in his body was screaming frantically.</p>
<p>Liang Yin pointed to the front and said, “It’s right in front, but the wind and waves are too big, so it may not be possible to get close.”</p>
<p>“Keep going.” Mo Rongzhan’s handsome face was already drenched with the rain, he didn’t care, his dark eyes just stared ahead.</p>
<p>Old Master Jiang was sitting cross-legged in the cabin. He opened his eyes slightly and glanced at Mo Rongzhan’s back, stood up, and walked to Liang Yin’s side, replacing him(LY) at the helm.</p>
<p>The fishing boat seemed to come alive in the hands of Jiang Ashi and rolled forward in the direction of the waves, but the speed was much faster than before.</p>
<p>“Black Wind Island is almost here.” Liang Yin marveled in his heart. He didn’t expect this old man with gray hair to be so powerful. <em>Is he really the old man in the legend who laid the stone formation outside Zhao Jia Island?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan held his breath and looked ahead, until he saw an island under the light of lightning, the frost in his eyes finally changed.</p>
<p><em>My…Yaoyao!</em></p>
<p>“Be careful!” Jiang Ashi suddenly said, and a large wave of five or six meters high swept over and swallowed their fishing boat.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan and Liang Yin were washed out of the fishing boat at the same time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the three were proficient in water and had a deep internal strength, so they were not swept into the seabed by the wind and waves. Each of them tried their best to reach the beach.</p>
<p>“Where will Yaoyao be imprisoned?” Mo Rongzhan asked Liang Yin as soon as he got ashore.</p>
<p>Liang Yin shook his head and said, “Black Wind Island is full of beasts. We Zhao Jia Island people never come here. I heard that Zhao Mingxiao made a cave here. Maybe Miss Lu is in the cave.”</p>
<p>Without a word, Mo Rongzhan walked to the mountain in front of him… there was only one mountain on this island.</p>
<p>Liang Yin looked back at Jiang Ashi, “Master, shall we go together?”</p>
<p>Old Master Jiang said in a deep voice, “In such weather, even if there is a boat, we can’t leave. Let’s talk about it when the storm passes.”</p>
<p>They followed Mo Rongzhan to find the entrance of the cave. Fortunately, it was not difficult to find. When they entered the cave, they were all shocked by the sight.</p>
<p>“The eldest young master actually… hollowed out the entire mountain!” Liang Yin was stunned. <em>What did the eldest young master do when Island Lord was away?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan frowned, <em>there are three passages in this cave, which direction should I go in to find Yao Yao?</em></p>
<p>“Let’s split up,” Jiang Ashi said as if reading Mo Rongzhan’s mind.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu…” Liang Yin called out, and there was no response except for the echo of his voice.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes stilled, and he walked to the middle passage. “Look!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen hadn’t slept for two days and two nights, huddled under the quilt, even though she was very scared, she still fell asleep unknowingly.</p>
<p>She didn’t know where she was in the cave next to the warehouse where weapons were kept. She was surrounded by medicinal herbs, and it was this smell that made her feel less lonely.</p>
<p>In fact, there were several places in the cave that looked like bedrooms, but she didn’t want to go there at all.</p>
<p>She didn’t know how long she had slept when she seemed to hear footsteps. She woke up and listened carefully, but it seemed as if there was no sound.</p>
<p><em>Could there be beasts on this island?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen wrapped the quilt and shrunk herself into the corner, suddenly thinking of Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p><em>If he knew I have gone to Zhao Jia Island, would he come looking for her?</em></p>
<p><em>Why would he come for me? Now that he had the savior he was thinking of, he must have forgotten me long ago.</em></p>
<p>When Mo Rongzhan arrived, he saw his little girl huddled in the corner, with only a pair of big wet eyes. She looked frail and pitiful, his heart turned sour and soft. He couldn’t wait to instantly hold her in his embrace and never let her leave him again.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao…” Mo Rongzhan called out, only to realize that his voice was frighteningly hoarse.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t seem to hear his voice, she just blinked, thinking she was in a dream.</p>
<p>“It’s me, Yaoyao, come to me.”</p>
<p>Seeing how scared she was, Mo Rongzhan didn’t dare to hug her all at once. He just squatted down in front of her and put his arms around her gently, saying, “Don’t be afraid, I’m here.”</p>
<p><em>Mo Rongzhan? Why is he here? </em>She was scared out of her mind, he couldn’t be here!</p>
<p>“Yaoyao.” Mo Rongzhan hugged her and pressed his warm lips to her forehead. “I’m here, do you hear me?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen blinked, reached out, touched his face, and said, “It’s really you?”</p>
<p>Hearing her low and frightened voice, the tip of his heart ached badly. He lowered his head and kissed her lips, sucking hard. “It’s me.”</p>
<p><em>It hurts!</em></p>
<p>The tingling pain from her lips finally woke Ye Zhen up. The familiar, warm masculine breath penetrated into her senses, she was forced to kiss him deeply.</p>
<p><em>It is really him…</em></p>
<p><em>Why is he here?</em></p>
<p>“Let go!” Ye Zhen muttered, her hands resting on his chest, the blankness on her face replaced by indifference. “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan let go of her reluctantly, staring at her with dark eyes, and said in a hoarse voice, “I’m here to pick you up.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sat up straight, only to find that his whole body was soaked, and there were small scars on his face. It looked like he had just been injured.</p>
<p>She bit her lip and asked in a low voice, “Have you been to Zhao Jia Island?”</p>
<p>“Yes. This is Black Wind Island… We can’t leave just yet. We will leave after the storm passes,” Mo Rongzhan looked at the little girl and said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen avoided his gaze and said, “What about my master?”</p>
