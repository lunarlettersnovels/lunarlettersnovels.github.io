            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 234 – A Shot From The Back (1)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Swoosh!</strong></em></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, be careful!”</p>
<p>Sun Wen was standing next to Ye Zhen when she saw Huang Fuxiang, not far away from them, holding up her bow and arrow towards her friend. She reflexively yelled to alert the ‘target’. Alas, the arrow was already in flight.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had no time to turn back. Fortunately, her reflexes were quick and body nimble. When she heard Sun Wen’s cry, she swiftly leaned sideways and then on her back. The sharp arrow passed inches from her nose.</p>
<p>“Oh! How did this arrow shoot out of my hand?” Huang Fuxiang cried in surprise. The smile girdled on her face said otherwise.</p>
<p>Teacher Tu, their instructor for archery, feigned ignorance and continued to teach the other students how to hold bows and arrows.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen composed herself and looked at Huang Fuxiang lightly. Suddenly, she clenched the bow and took an aim.</p>
<p><em>It seems that she really thinks she can bully me as she pleases!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Swoosh——</strong></em></p>
<p>An arrow shot out and accurately hit Huang Fuxiang’s clothes.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang screamed in horror. “Lu Yaoyao, how dare you aim at me!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the bow and arrow in her hands in surprise. “Oh, how did this arrow shoot out of my hand?”</p>
<p><em><strong>Swoosh——</strong></em></p>
<p>A second one wedged straight into her updo.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang was visibly frightened, her face lost all color. She fell onto the ground screaming. “Help! Lu Yaoyao is going to kill me!”</p>
<p>This time the instructor wasted no time in rushing over, yelling at Ye Zhen to stop as he did. “Lu Yaoyao, what are you doing?!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t even deign to glance at the instructor. As if surprised, she said, “I don’t know what’s going on, these arrows are uncontrollable.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Swoosh——</strong></em></p>
<p>As if to prove her words, another arrow quickly pinned itself onto Huang Fuxiang’s sleeve.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang was ashen with fear. She wanted to run away, but her skirt and sleeves were pinned to the ground. She couldn’t move at all.</p>
<p><em><strong>Swoosh——</strong></em></p>
<p>Now, her other sleeve was pinned as well.</p>
<p>“Help!” Huang Fuxiang cried, looking at Ye Zhen’s expressionless face. The seething anger within her shook her whole body, murderous intent suffused her eyes. Even so, all she could do was whine.</p>
<p>Teacher Tu pointed to Ye Zhen and said angrily, “Lu Yaoyao, put down your bow and arrow at once! Do you want to kill your classmates?!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him with a seemingly innocent face. “Teacher Tu, I don’t know why it is like this. To be fair, why don’t you ask Huang Fuxiang? Didn’t she do the same awhile ago?”</p>
<p>“You…” Teacher Tu glared daggers at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Little had he expected his own trick to come biting him and this soon. He had turned a blind eye to the incident because he had something to ask of the Huang Family. So, even if the aggrieved party brought the matter to him, he would still rule in favour of the culprit. But in this ploy, he had failed to factor in Lu Yaoyao’s courage. That she would dare to shoot Huang Fuxiang, right before his eyes, and not just once was beyond his imagination.</p>
<p>“Argh, what’s this smell? It stinks!” Sun Wen said, covering her nose while looking at Huang Fuxiang.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang was flush with tears. She had started the game for sadistic pleasure, to avenge Lu Yaoyao and scare her, but had never expected for the tables to turn. So there was no question of her being courageous when tasting her own medicine. Right now, this haughty miss had wet herself in fright.</p>
<p>With a smirk on her face, Ye Zhen casually walked over to the girl and pulled out the arrow from the hair. Then she looked at the troublemaker right in the eye, all along standing tall. “Huang Fuxiang, since you are so timid, don’t inflict harm on others. Or the next time,” she poked the center of her forehead as she said, “… the arrow shall be here.”</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang glared at Ye Zhen thinking that would scare her into backing off. She was shocked by her audacity, to think she could push her to the corner! Just who did she think she was?! The terror for just a moment ago was engulfed by indignation and ire. She yelled hoarsely. “Lu Yaoyao, I will not let you get away with this. You’ll see!”</p>
<p>“We’ll see,” Ye Zhen said, “but you might want to change your clothes first. It’s awfully… unkempt.”</p>
<p>“Argh, grown girl wet herself!”</p>
<p>“She acted all arrogant, yet she’s like that.”</p>
<p><em>“…”</em></p>
<p>Hearing the whispers and mockery of the students around, Huang Fuxiang almost wanted to bury herself in the ground. She had never resented Ye Zhen as she did now, how she wished to tear her whole person apart. In the end, all she did was…</p>
<p>“Wahh…” She burst into uncontrollable tears.</p>
