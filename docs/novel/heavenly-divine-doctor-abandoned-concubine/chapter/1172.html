            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 155 – In the Arms Of A Dark Shadow</strong></p>
<p>Even though two maids gripped her hands, Ye Zhen’s face did not show any fear.</p>
<p>“Under the clear sky, it is so easy for Princess Royal to kill the daughter of a court official in her palace. I have never thought that Cining Palace was hers to execute punishment within its walls.”</p>
<p>Even if her identity was nowhere near as noble as theirs, Lu Shiming was still a court official, and the Lu Family had just entered nobility. Now, how could Princess Royal kill her?</p>
<p>“I would first have a look at this palace, then have you beaten to death inside. What can your Lu Family do to save you, Little Fox?”</p>
<p>Princess Royal looked lowly at the Lu Family, who were former imperial merchants. In her eyes, even if Lu Lingzhi was now a minister, he was still nothing.</p>
<p>“Then try it.” Ye Zhen’s bright black eyes stared straight at Princess Royal. The cold in her eyes shocked all the people around her.</p>
<p>Clearly, she was only a daughter of a businessman and had a humble background, but never did they expect that she would have such a noble air that made her look more dignified than Princess Royal herself.</p>
<p>Liu Hua glared at Ye Zhen. Seeing that she looked more beautiful today than she had in the academy, she thought she was deliberately dressed like this to seduce the emperor.</p>
<p><i>The Lu Family is full of shameless women!</i></p>
<p>“How dare you challenge this princess?” Liu Hua raised her hand to slap Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Mo Rongyi saw the scene from afar and immediately shouted.</p>
<p>Liu Hua did not spare a look at Mo Rongyi, her hand surged up in mid-air and was about to land harshly on Ye Zhen’s delicate face when suddenly her arm was grabbed in a tight grip.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, Ye Zhen seized her arm and smiled at her. “Even if you are a princess, you have to have a reason to hit someone. We both know that I didn’t knock you over but instead, it was all your doing. Are you angry because you lost a lot of silver to me? Then find a legitimate reason to get back at me.”</p>
<p>“You…” Liu Hua was livid with anger and shouted at the two maids behind Ye Zhen. “Who told you to let go?!”</p>
<p>When the two ladies-in-waiting saw Mo Rongyi coming, they had already loosened their hold on Ye Zhen’s arm in panic. Otherwise, Liu Hua would have slapped Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Liu Hua, what are you doing? Do you dare beat people in my mother’s palace?” Mo Rongyi came running gasping for air. He pushed Liu Hua aside and checked on Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>In no time, Liu Hua’s tall physique, which stood in front of Ye Zhen, was pushed aside softly, replaced by the little prince’s handsome and immature face brimming with annoyance.</p>
<p>“Little Prince, what are you doing here? This Lu Yaoyao is just using you, and you believe her,” Princess Royal said with a frown.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi grinned and refused to answer the question. Instead, he decided to put his plan into action. “Imperial Aunt, my humble greetings.” He curtsied then turned to Liu Hua. “And to you too, my cousin Liu Hua! I have good news for you!”</p>
<p>Crossing her arms, Princess Liu Hua snorted and looked at the little prince with indifference. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“This prince will not let his people ask you for his silvers again! Although you instigated a gamble which this prince won, I don’t care about the silvers anymore. Dear Cousin, aren’t you going to enter the palace? I will leave the 22,000 silvers to you as your dowry. So, you don’t have to give it back to me.”</p>
<p>Liu Hua took long to respond, but her mother had already turned green with anger and shame. “Little Prince, Liu Hua doesn’t need your money as a dowry.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s brain was already turning fast and was able to draw sentences that would further shame the two. At the princess royal’s words, he smiled and said, “It’s all right, this prince doesn’t care about the 22,000 taels of silver. I wish to give it to my cousin, who will be my sister-in-law soon.”</p>
<p><i>Which sister-in-law will take her brother-in-law’s silver as dowry? </i>Princess Royal thought grumpily in her heart. Her eyes looked coldly at no one but Ye Zhen. It must be this girl who taught the little prince to say these things!</p>
<p>She winked at the maid-in-waiting next to Ye Zhen. No matter what happens, she would not let her go unscathed today.</p>
<p>Liu Hua recognized the meaning behind Mo Rongyi’s words, stomped her feet, and cried, “I don’t want your money; I’ll give it back to you when I get home!”</p>
<p>The corners of Mo Rongyi’s mouth rose uncontrollably. “Cousin, why are you being so polite now? This prince did not ask for the silvers.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head with amusement. <i>This little prince is really cunning.</i></p>
<p>Suddenly, the maid-in-waiting standing to Ye Zhen’s left gave her a hard shove. Ye Zhen staggered back a few steps, finding herself stepping on an empty space. She could not help but exclaim aloud.</p>
<p>“Ah!!!”</p>
<p>They were all standing beside a lotus pond. The maid-in-waiting pushed Ye Zhen so hard that she lost her balance. When she was about to fall into the lotus pond, a dark shadow appeared in a flash…</p>
