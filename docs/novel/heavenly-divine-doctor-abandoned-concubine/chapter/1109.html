            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 219 – Leaving the Palace (2)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen covered her mouth and giggled. “Well, then I can wait for the challenge after His Highness recovers.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi snorted, then eventually laughed. “Tell this prince what reward you want and he shall certainly satisfy you.”</p>
<p>The young prince’s heart was generous and kind. Even if he was displeased, his anger would only last a fleeting moment. Ye Zhen looked at Mo Rongyi with kind and gentle eyes. “Didn’t you give me 40,000 taels?”</p>
<p>“Then what should I reward…?” Mo Rongyi’s eyes brightened. “Shall I send you some seeds?”</p>
<p>“Seeds?” Ye Zhen was stunned. She certainly did not have time to plant flowers now!</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi smiled mysteriously. “You know there is also a medicinal field in the palace, filled with rare herbs from around the world. Usually, there are medicine farmers there to take care of them. Those herbs are used in the imperial pharmacy. I can give you some seeds. However, whether you can grow them would depend on your own ability.” In the end, he threw her a challenge and somewhat avenged his tiny ego.</p>
<p>“Very well!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was elated. Of course, she knew that there is a small medicinal field in the palace. In fact, it’s a large glasshouse.  She had seen the herbs in the glasshouse but didn’t know what they were. It’s not easy to sneak into this place, thus it was better to get the seeds in a proper manner. Who knew, her wish would be granted without her saying so!</p>
<p>Besides, she had wanted to grow some herbs herself. This would be a good start.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi said, “However, this prince cannot get the seeds today. I’ll give it to you when I get them in a few days.”</p>
<p>“Little prince, how would you get those seeds?” She was curious.</p>
<p>It was said that no one was allowed near the glasshouse without the permission of the emperor.</p>
<p>“That is to say, this prince has a plan. Don’t worry about it,” Mo Rongyi said, still continuing being mysterious. “Aren’t you going? Go, go!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the sky outside. If she were to leave now, she would have been able to return to the Lu Family.</p>
<p>She curtsied. “Little Prince, then I’ll return to my family and come to see you when I have the chance.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi coldly snorted. He did not want her to leave but would not say so either.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t take his reaction to heart and went to Cining Palace to seek permission.</p>
<p>The empress dowager had already asked Qi Jin for a report. She knew that the Little Prince was feeling much better and did not need to eat the medicated meals anymore. She also knew it was time to send Lu Yaoyao back now, otherwise, she might have to let her stay for a few more days.</p>
<p>“Return to the college and study medicine well. Aijia will be waiting for your admittance in the palace as a physician.” As she spoke, the empress dowager gently smiled, her eyes full of gratitude, affection, and pride.</p>
<p>“One has let Her Highness see a joke. Please don’t laugh at me for having dreams.” Ye Zhen replied sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Dreams do come true.” The empress dowager said, “Your grandmother must be missing you these days. You should return to Lu Household. Aijia has ordered Aunt Cheng to send you off.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was a little reluctant to part with the dowager. She had always felt a deep connection with this wise woman. Be it as Ye Zhen in her previous life, or now as Lu Yaoyao, she had nothing but admiration, respect, and inexplicable affection for the woman before her.</p>
<p>She held the dowager’s arm, rubbing it, as she said, “If Her Highness allows it, can this official’s daughter come and accompany Her Highness occasionally?”</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager smiled and narrowed her eyes. “With someone as pleasant as you, Aijia will always be glad to have you around.”</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng, beside them, was smiling in delight. In the imperial family shrouded in the darkness of treachery, deceit, and betrayal, a glimmer of sincerity, selflessness, and affection was a rarity. She was glad to have glimpsed upon one such, and between two totally unrelated people.</p>
<p>The two spoke for a while before Ye Zhen was dismissed. However, before Ye Zhen and Aunt Cheng reached the imperial gardens, Eunuch Ford came to invite her to the imperial study.</p>
<p>“Eunuch Ford, is there anything else the emperor has ordered?” Ye Zhen was reluctant to see that man again. She was only just rejoicing that she had not seen him today.</p>
<p>“I also do not know. Miss Lu, you will know when you go to the imperial study.” Eunuch Ford answered.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned and followed the retainer to the imperial study.</p>
<p>As she stood in front of the closed doors, she took a deep breath. She didn’t particularly like the imperial study very much. She could still feel goosebumps on her skin, even after all the time that had elapsed. After all, it was in this place that housed many annals of righteousness, an atrocity was laid bare.</p>
<p>Soon after her death, her spirit had arrived here, unbidden… perhaps, to witness treachery and brutality in their truest forms.</p>
<p>She saw how her “most trusted friend”, Lu Lingzhi, had stabbed the already dead her when he presented the jade pendant without an iota of guilt… how her ruthless husband felt nothing but relief upon the news of her demise… he didn’t wait to remarry.</p>
<p>… Yes, this was where the truth behind everything had unraveled… her illusion and hope shattered.</p>
