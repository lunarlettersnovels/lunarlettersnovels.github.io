            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 306 – Best Candidate for Son-in Law (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Mother!” Ye Zhen didn’t think the situation was that severe.</p>
<p>“We’ll wait for the results of Marquis Jing Ning’s interrogation for further discussion.” Pei Shi frankly cut off Ye Zhen’s words.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen hurriedly said, “It’s all right, Auntie. If Yaoyao wants to go to the academy, I can send people to escort her.”</p>
<p>“We have our own guards, and don’t need to bother you.” Ye Zhen expressionlessly stated.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen didn’t say anything else but called two guards over to escort Pei Shi and the rest of them back to the Lu Mansion.</p>
<p>As soon as they reached the carriage, they saw Wang Shi walking over with Lu Jing.</p>
<p>“Second Sister-in-Law, you are here as well.” When Pei Shi saw Wang Shi walking over her expression was not very pleasant.</p>
<p>However, Wang Shi seemed to have not noticed as she took her hand and asked, “Third Sister-in-Law, did you just see His Imperial Majesty? I saw him from afar, and thought that he was truly… handsome, tall, and majestic.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi frowned, retracting her hand. “If Second Sister-in-Law wants to know what His Imperial Majesty looks like, you can just ask Wang Fei the next time you go to the imperial palace.”</p>
<p>Wang Shi slightly sneered. If it hadn’t been for the fact that she had been standing too far away and hadn’t seen the emperor, would she have to come to ask Pei Shi?</p>
<p>“Was that, Marquis Jing Ning?” Wang Shi took a look at the tall figure ordering the guards to block and search the streets, and couldn’t help but ask Pei Shi.</p>
<p>Pei Shi acted as if she hadn’t heard and told Ye Zhen to hurry onto the carriage.</p>
<p>“What is she so proud for!” As Wang Shi saw Pei Shi’s carriage leave, she sneered angrily.</p>
<p>“Mother, let’s go home too.” Lu Jinger whispered.</p>
<p>Wang Shi coldly looked at her concubine-born daughter and mockingly said, “Did you see? Yaoyao is truly skilled. Not only did she let the emperor save her himself but also make Marquis Jing Ning care so tenderly for her. You are all daughters of the Lu Family. Jing’er, in the future, are you going to be inferior to even Fang’er?”</p>
<p>Lu Jinger’s expression slightly soured, her hand tightening into a fist from beneath her sleeves. Naturally, she was unwilling to lose to Lu Fang and Lu Yaoyao, but what could she do about it?</p>
<p><em>Why was Tang Zhen so concerned for Yaoyao? Was it that he truly… </em>Lu Jinger was unwilling to accept this. Where was she inferior to Lu Yaoyao?</p>
<p>She turned to look at Tang Zhen, who was not far away, her eyes revealing slivers of her regards.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, what are you looking at? No matter how long you look, he will never be yours.” Wang Shi yelled. She would only help her own daughter. As for a concubine-born daughter, well, her fate would be up to herself.</p>
<p>Lu Jinger hung her head and followed Wang Shi into the carriage. <em>The path of her future would be one she chose for herself. She wouldn’t let anyone stop!</em></p>
<p><em>That was certain!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">♚</p>
<p>Ye Zhen helped Mo Rongyi out of peril once again. After the empress dowager was informed of this, she concluded that she was Mo Rongyi’s lucky star. She wanted to give the little girl the title of princess, and treat her like her own daughter.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, you want to make Lu Yaoyao a princess?” After Mo Rongzhan heard of his mother’s plans, he dropped everything and came to the Cining Palace.</p>
<p>The empress dowager smiled and said, “Correct, I think that Yaoyao is extremely likable, She is just like a little wool sweater, close and comforting to me. Your Imperial Majesty has come at the right time. I was just picking out a title for her. What does Your Imperial Majesty think about the title Furong?”</p>
<p>[TL: Furong means fortunate and glorious.]</p>
<p><em>If Lu Yaoyao were to become a Princess, then wouldn’t she be his sister? Then there truly would be no chance for her to enter his inner palace.</em></p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, I think that it is unsuitable for her to become a princess. If you like her, then just give her some more rewards. If you really want to give her a title, then make her a viscountess.” Mo Rongzhan logically prevented the empress dowager from her plans of making Lu Yaoyao a Princess.</p>
<p>However, the empress dowager was just enthusiastically picking out a title. At her son’s words, she was taken aback, and looked up towards him. “You think that Yaoyao is unworthy of the title of princess?”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean that.” Mo Rongzhan slightly frowned. How was he going to explain that he still had plans of making Lu Yaoyao his concubine in the future? If she became a princess, then she would be his sister. How would he make her a concubine then?</p>
<p>“Then what do you mean?” she said with confusion. She didn’t think that giving someone the title of princess would make the emperor dissatisfied. She knew her son well. He never had any will to disobey her.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan felt a strange sort of distress. “Imperial Mother, it is not suitable to give Lu Yaoyao such a high position at once.”</p>
