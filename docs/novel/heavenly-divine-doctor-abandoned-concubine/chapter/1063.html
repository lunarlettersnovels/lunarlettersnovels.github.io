            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 266 – Gratitude (2)</strong></p>
<p>The next day, Old Madam Lu brought Second Madam Lu to the palace to greet the imperial concubine. At first, the old matriarch wanted her to go with her, but Ye Zhen made excuses and deftly evaded. One, with all that had happened in the past few days she was in mood to return to the place that she had just been from. Two, for sure, Lu Wushuang couldn’t wait to devour her with her ruthless jealousy. So why should the prey actually offer herself on a platter for the predatory?</p>
<p>Perhaps the Lu Elder had already figured out the truth of the matter and was just being considerate for she didn’t insist on bringing the girl along. Crisis averted, Ye Zhen cheerily followed Lu Xiangzhi to the Xu Mansion as per her earlier intentions.</p>
<p>When they arrived, unlike usual, they didn’t find Xu Lao in the study, but at the pavilion by the lake. Approaching the waterside pavilion, they found a young man playing<em> Go</em> with the master of the house.</p>
<p>Moon-white robe, black hair tied loosely behind his back with a silver band, a few errant strands hanging by his temples, eyes narrow and protracted, a visage as beautiful as jade … He looked every inch handsome and debonair even as he set the dull black stone on the board. His was the kind of elegance that was as natural as the gliding clouds and cascading waters. One glimpse and the onlooker would be certain he was nothing but nobility.</p>
<p><em>Who is this man?</em> Ye Zhen was surprised. She’d never once heard that there were people of such eminence in the capital.</p>
<p>“Master. Mister Chen.” Lu Xiangzhi went forward and respectfully bowed, his eyes gleaming with unveiled adoration at the man in white robe.</p>
<p>Xu Lao smiled and excused Lu Xiangzhi, then turning towards Ye Zhen said, “Young Miss, finally you have come to accompany this old man for <em>Go</em>.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen curtsied and said with a smile, “In all truth, I have long wanted to learn Master Xu Lao’s wise moves again.”</p>
<p>“I have no time to play <em>Go</em> with you today. Mister Chen’s skill for this game is far above mine. You can play with him instead.” Xu Lao pointed to the man opposite and turned towards him. “This is the young lady I told you about.”</p>
<p>Mister Chen raised his head to look at Ye Zhen. His long and narrow eyes revealed a smile. His exquisite features aside, he seemed quite astute. As she met his eyes, she was soon wreathed in smiles.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, would you like to teach me?” Mister Chen smiled and asked with a gentle voice.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen blushed slightly. “I don’t dare to teach Mister Chen. This miss just learned some superficial knowledge. Last time, I was lucky enough to make Master Xu take notice of  my skills. Today, I am afraid I will make a fool of myself in front of Mister Chen.”</p>
<p>“This humble one is called Huangfu Chen,” he looked at Ye Zhen and said, while simultaneously collecting the black stones on the board game.</p>
<p>Xu Lao stood up. “You can play<em> Go</em> here for a while. We are going to the study.”</p>
<p>After spring, Lu Xiangzhi would be participating in the examination. Xu Lao had not accepted any students for a long time now. Naturally, he did not want his only student to fail the exam.</p>
<p>The master and pupil bade leave leaving behind just the young man and the little girl. The wind by the lake was chilly but was blocked by the bamboo curtains skirting the pavilion.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stared at the man before her. <em>He said his name is Huangfu Chen …</em></p>
<p>Huangfu was the surname of the imperial clan of the erstwhile dynasty. Although not everyone with that surname were related to them, there was only one Huangfu Chen in this world.</p>
<p>Although Huangfu Chen was a descendant of the former imperial clan, he didn’t like going to the imperial court. Even during the former emperor’s incompetent and brutal reign, no one encouraged him, who was only thirteen years old at that time, to re-establish the Jing Dynasty. In order to avoid these disputes, he chose to leave the capital and live in seclusion where no one could find him.</p>
<p>Certainly, these were not the factors that Ye Zhen cared about. She was just surprised because she once heard that he was not only skilled in medicine, but also a genuine fortune teller.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, why do you stare at this humble one in such a manner?” Huangfu Chen asked as he looked at her with eyes that seemed to be  smiling at one’s younger generation.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen returned to her senses, cheeks flushed, she said awkwardly, “I’m just a little surprised. Are you … <em>that</em> Huangfu Chen?”</p>
<p><em>Oh, what a stupid question! If he’s not </em><em><strong>him</strong></em><em>, why would Master Xu call him Mister Chen? Why would he be so polite and respectful to him?</em></p>
<p><em>How many people in this world would Master Xu treat as such?</em></p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled. “Which Huangfu Chen is Miss Lu talking about?”</p>
<p>“Mister Chen, I was rude,” Ye Zhen said after a bow, “I just didn’t expect to see you in  person.”</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, you need not be so polite. You saved my nephew’s life. I should thank you,” Huangfu Chen said with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him and wondered. <em>When did I save his nephew?</em></p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi is my aunt, and her grandson is my nephew,” Huangfu Chen said, noticing her puzzlement.</p>
<p>She almost forgot that Huangfu Chen and Qi Jin were related. Ye Zhen smiled. “Actually, I didn’t do much.”</p>
<p>With a profound look, Huangfu Chen said, “Still, I want to thank Miss Lu.”</p>
<p>Embarrassed, she quickly said, “It’s very kind of you.”</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, please.”</p>
