            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 238 – You’re Suspicious Too (1)</strong></p>
<p>That many eyes, that many emotions. While the Huang Family was boiling with rage, conceit, arrogance, and malice; the headmaster full of skepticism. Teacher Tu only hoped to trample the girl for ruining his plans, whilst Qi Jin wanted to shield her at all costs.</p>
<p>As such, the room was divided, each one with one’s own agenda… and yet, Ye Zhen was unperturbed.</p>
<p>“You don’t have the key?!” Su Xinmei’s face turned livid, her eyes boring into Ye Zhen. “How can you not have the key when Master Qin certainly gave it to you?”</p>
<p>Unfazed, Ye Zhen looked at her with a smile. “Teacher Su, may I ask when were the medicinal herbs in the glasshouse destroyed?”</p>
<p>Su Xinmei pursed her lips tightly. “We just went in and found they were destroyed. Perhaps, it happened earlier. I heard that you were in the medicine field at noon.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Still at ease, Ye Zhen conceded and continued. “Is my visit to the medicine field proof enough that it was I who destroyed the medicinal herbs?”</p>
<p>“Who else could it be other than you?” Su Xinmei demanded.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “But, how could I get in when I don’t have the key?”</p>
<p>This back and forth was getting on Su Xinmei’s nerves. Losing her cool, she said aggressively, “Who knows, you might have let someone duplicate the key and have it hidden in one’s possessions!”</p>
<p>“I’d like to know who can make a duplicate of the key!” Qi Jin interjected.</p>
<p>The glasshouse, a treasure that the Huangfu Family had left behind, was cherished by the ruling dynasty. Tending to it and guarding it, was something that only the most dependable ones were entrusted with.</p>
<p>When meticulous care was being meted out to maintain and preserve it, how could something as important as a key be neglected?</p>
<p>The key in question was particularly unique. Apart from the hands serving the Imperial Household Department, no craftsman in the entire Jin Country was capable of reproducing the exact thing. Needless to say, a duplicate was a far fetched notion.</p>
<p>No matter how much she wished, it was too late for Su Xinmei to retract her tactless remark now. She was red, in embarrassment and anger. She hurriedly looked to salvage the situation, lowering her head she reiterated her claim in a low voice. “Other than Lu Yaoyao, one cannot think of anyone who could have destroyed the herbs given that she has been to the glasshouse.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have the key too? Could it mean you destroyed the medicinal herbs then?” Ye Zhen asked, still smiling.</p>
<p>The little girl’s calm demeanor and ever-present smile were pricking and piercing. It looked as though she was mocking the other, or so the other thought.</p>
<p>Su Xinmei’s countenance swiftly changed. “Lu Yaoyao, you’re making false accusations against me!” Furiously pointing a trembling finger at her, she barked.</p>
<p>“Teacher Su is your assistant teacher. How could she do such a thing?” Despite her palpable anger, Imperial Physician Huang was composed when interrupting.</p>
<p>“Just as she would not do such a thing, why would I destroy the medicinal herbs?” Ye Zhen countered Imperial Physician Huang, her tone profound.</p>
<p>Ever since the pair of doctor and assistant teacher and barged in, they had been blatantly and vehemently accusing. They brought no evidence, sought no explanation, and wasted no time in declaring Ye Zhen the culprit.</p>
<p>“What evidence do you have to prove your innocence?” the headmaster asked. He had almost wanted to consider Ye Zhen’s explanation in the archery matter but was incensed when this issue came to light. But he still wanted to give this girl a chance, perhaps because he did not want to be led by the nose a second time.</p>
<p>“Why am I the one being accused of causing the destruction? What evidence do you have then?” Ye Zhen answered with a question.</p>
<p>“You have the key!” Su Xinmei cried out.</p>
<p>This was the most twisted logic the pair of women were trying to impress upon everyone. Just because one had the means, one had the motive too. Going by this theory, all those with weapons were murders!</p>
<p>“I have already returned the key to Master Qin.” Ye Zhen looked at the assistant teacher squarely and replied.</p>
<p>“If you say so, must we believe it?” Su Xinmei sneered.</p>
<p>Despite the peaking intensity, provocation and imputation, Ye Zhen remained calm and composed through it all. If one didn’t know better, looking at her serene self, one would think this absolutely didn’t concern her, and she was but a mere spectator.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had long discerned the goal of this farce. This act of vandalism was an extraordinarily frantic and desperate attempt to implicate her. Since they couldn’t harm her themselves, they were taking a roundabout route borrowing the hands of the law.</p>
<p>She was neither shocked nor hurt. She had learned the hard way that people and viciousness were as inseparable as fish and water. When personal gain was the guiding factor, there was no right or wrong.</p>
<p>But it would be wrong to say she was impassive towards this whole thing. In fact, she was mighty miffed by this vile scheme. Those medicinal herbs were precious. It was not easy cultivating them.</p>
<p>In order to deal with her, these people had even taken for granted the efforts of the people who had diligently cared for the medicinal herbs by destroying them!</p>
<p>Her anger made her take offense, not wanting the matter to pass quickly.<em> They must serve a just punishment!</em></p>
