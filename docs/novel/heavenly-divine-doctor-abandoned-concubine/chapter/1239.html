<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi shouted at Ye Zhen and stomped his foot anxiously. His voice breaking into helpless sobs. “I ran out alone without any guards.”</p>
<p><i>No guards? Even an imperial secretary didn’t accompany such a defenseless child? The child would definitely starve to death as no one was aware of his location.</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen had planned to leave but stopped when she heard this. She dragged her feet back to the pit and looked down at him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here all by yourself?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi pouted and said, “I came to find someone!”</p>
<p><i>Who was the person he was trying to find?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned for a moment.</p>
<p><i>Only one person popped in her head, he must have been looking for the emperor!</i></p>
<p>“Do you want to go to Chengde Mountain Villa?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, but I lost my way accidentally… my horse is gone, please help me up first, and I will certainly treat you well in the future.” Mo Rongyi cried; his face dirty from the constant wiping of tears with his grubby hands.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed. “I’d like to save you. Unfortunately, how can I, a weak woman, save you?”</p>
<p>He willed himself to stop crying and looked at Ye Zhen with pleading eyes. “You just have to find a way to pull me up, I beg you.”</p>
<p>“Stay calm and wait here.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen originally didn’t want to meddle in the emperor’s affairs, let alone rescue his brother! But after a moment’s thought, she remembered that she ought to become an imperial physician in the future. Saving Mo Rongyi could at least help her win the favor of the empress dowager, thus, paving the road for her.</p>
<p>She had two ropes in her bag, which was meant to tie up her prey. However, the rope was too short to be tied to a nearby tree, therefore, she had to pull him up through her own strength.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you ready yet?”</p>
<p>Upon not seeing Ye Zhen’s figure anywhere, Mo Rongyi began to cry louder, afraid that the miss had tricked him and ran away.</p>
<p>Quickly, Ye Zhen came back again with two ropes tied together. “You grab this rope; I’ll pull you up.”</p>
<p>“You… are you strong enough? Won’t you be dragged down by my weight!”</p>
<p>As Ye Zhen came into view, the little boy had the chance to see her full appearance.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi saw that she was only a little miss, therefore, he became worried that she might not be able to save him, and both of them would fall into the trap instead!</p>
<p>“If you can’t come up, I will leave!” She grumpily replied.</p>
<p>Her sister’s body was stronger than it looked. Lu Yaoyao was never a delicate girl, she’d rather wrestle than play with her dolls!</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was really afraid that Ye Zhen would leave and he wailed loud enough for Ye Zhen to be momentarily deaf.</p>
<p>“Don’t leave.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt sympathy for the little boy and her ears so she threw the rope immediately.</p>
<p>“Grab it and use your strength to come up. Don’t you practice martial arts in your leisure? Is climbing new to you? “</p>
<p>“No! But I’m too hungry to be strong.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi complained that he had been in this trap for almost two hours. He was afraid and cried for so long, wasting most of his energy.</p>
<p>“Tie the rope around your waist first, and then hold on to it tightly. I’ll pull you up, but you’ll also have to help yourself. You have strength as long as you don’t starve to death.” She instructed. “If you can’t come up, I’ll definitely let go, then I won’t be able to save you!”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s face turned pale with fear. He grasped the rope tightly and stepped on the wall with his feet. He started to climb up bit by bit.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s hand reddened but she endured. It was not easy to save the child than it was to save Mo Rongzhan. At that time, she just threw the tied roots into the well and tied it around a big tree. Mo Rongzhan climbed up on his own.</p>
<p>After a while, the prince finally climbed up from the trap.</p>
<p>“Whoops, I still don’t have enough strength to walk…”</p>
<p>To Ye Zhen’s horror, the boy continued to cry even after being in the safety of the ground. <i>What a crybaby!</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen fetched the water bag from her things and let him have some. “Why are you crying? Didn’t you come up?”</p>
<p>The little boy desperately clasped his hands around the water bag and gulped its contents. But after his thirst was quenched, he began to cry again.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Dumbfounded Ye Zhen simply did not know how to react.</p>
