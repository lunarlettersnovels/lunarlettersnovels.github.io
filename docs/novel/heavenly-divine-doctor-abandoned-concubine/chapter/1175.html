            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 152 – Life Is Not Always A Matter Of Choice </strong><b><br>
</b></p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed gloatingly. “Those little silvers are nothing to you anyway. You and Liu Hua are cousins, you can’t make a fuss out of this, can you?”</p>
<p><i>What a joke!</i> Mo Rongyi smiled. “If it weren’t for the fact that Liu Hua would be sent  to the palace, Mother wouldn’t have done this to me.”</p>
<p><i>Princess Liu Hua is going to enter the palace?</i> Ye Zhen smiled… <i>but it was earlier than expected.</i></p>
<p>In her last life, Princess Royal, Liu Hua’s mother, had been sending her daughter to the palace but Mo Rongzhan ignored her. It took a year to seal Liu Hua’s position as his wife at the request of Empress Dowager.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi continued to cry. “It doesn’t matter, I just want my silvers back!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen handed him the medicine in her hand. “If you drink this, I’ll teach you a way to get your silvers.”</p>
<p>“What way?” Mo Rongyi immediately asked.</p>
<p>“Drink this medicine first.” Ye Zhen said, motioning him to take the medicine in her hand.</p>
<p>“Is that the love pea?” Innocent Mo Rongyi asked with a bitter face, “In fact, I’m not ill. If I really have a cold, I would have been well after taking several different medicines for a few days. Why do I still feel sick all over?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen saw that he was pale and looked really sick. She pointed to the drum stool beside him and said, “Sit down over there and I’ll check your pulse.”</p>
<p>“What?” Mo Rongyi burst out laughing, “How long have you been studying medicine? Imperial physicians haven’t even cured me of my illness, so what can you, a young girl, do?”</p>
<p>“Well, I should still give medicine to a dead horse<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1">[mfn]Give medicine to a dead horse is a Chinese idiom that means trying everything in desperate situations.[/mfn]</sup>.”</p>
<p>Because she had read medical books and journals often, she could clearly remember in her mind several treatment methods to corresponding conditions.</p>
<p>Other people strove to study medicine to practice the profession, to save the many, but she was different. She yearned to use it as her key to the imperial palace. She had never thought about becoming a great doctor, not even dreamed of it…</p>
<p>They say life is a matter of choice, <i>but sometimes it is not.</i></p>
<p>Yet, surely, the <i>lingquan<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="2">[mfn]灵泉: lingquan or spirit spring water is a highly a highly condensed spirit qi (energy) in liquid state. In this novel, it’s an elixir/miraculous liquid that oozes from the eye of phoenix tattoo MC’s palm.[/mfn]</sup> </i>gifted to her was meant for good. She could help thousands with it, a really powerful ability.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s eyes widened. “Do you regard me as a dead horse then?” The little prince had no clue and looked at Ye Zhen with his brows scrunched up.</p>
<p>“It was just a metaphor. Who knows? Maybe you can be cured by good luck.”</p>
<p>If she wanted to enter the palace in the future, she must find several powerful people and make good relations with them. The empress dowager and the little prince were the people she wanted to make good friends with.</p>
<p>“This prince should better take some medicine now.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi gave her a disgruntled look, took the medicine from her hand, drank it slowly then wiped his mouth clean. “All right, tell me quickly, how can I make Liu Hua return my silvers to me?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes flashed a sly smile before she said in a low voice, “It’s very simple. Let someone tell Princess Liu Hua that you don’t want your silvers back and have decided to give it to her as a dowry.”</p>
<p>“That’s it?” Mo Rongyi looked at Ye Zhen with his eyebrows raised. He did not believe that this would make Princess Liu Hua to voluntarily return his silvers.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that Princess Liu Hua will enter the palace? She will be an imperial concubine upon marrying your brother, the emperor, and therefore, will be your sister-in-law. What kind of sister-in-law would ask her brother-in-law for her dowry? If this rumor spreads out, she will be forced to give back your silvers to save her reputation.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s eyes brightened realizing that Ye Zhen had made a point. “That seems to be quite feasible.”</p>
<p>“If this doesn’t work, there is only one reason. Princess Liu Hua already lost her face,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>“I’ll send someone to take the message immediately.” Mo Rongyi was in high spirits and turned to Ye Zhen and said, “I suddenly feel that my sickness has completely disappeared. Perhaps, I will be better tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi coughed, his little body quivered for a little.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her eyebrows. “Well, it was my idea that made you feel better just now. But you are still not well, I can tell.”</p>
<p>Once again, the little prince laughed at her. “How can you say so? You are only a little girl.”</p>
<p><i>Little girl?</i> Ye Zhen smiled with mirth. “Little Prince, I seem to be several years older than you. Don’t you feel guilty when you call me a little girl?”</p>
<p>“Why should this prince be guilty?” Mo Rongyi said stubbornly.</p>
<p>“Why not? I have given you a feasible solution to your problem. Shouldn’t you repay me?”</p>
<p>“What reward do you want?” Mo Rongyi asked, raising his chin.</p>
<p>“I’m going to the Academy for Women tomorrow but I still have not had a patient before. But if you let me feel your pulse now, you would be the first!”</p>
<p>“It’s not easy, come on!” Mo Rongyi protested while he started to drag himself to sit on the stool near Ye Zhen who immediately reached for his wrist.</p>
<p>Little did they know that for some time now, a person was quietly eavesdropping outside and was now retreating, his steps determined to reach the emperor’s study…</p>
