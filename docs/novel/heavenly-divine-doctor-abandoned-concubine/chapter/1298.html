            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 29 – Imperial Concubine Lu (1)</h3>
<p>Lu Wushuang was dressed in purple cotton, satin, and a flesh-coloured flying butterfly brocade. She wore a small hairpin with a golden pendant and a large peony was pinned near her sideburns, which made her appear beautiful and graceful.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had never seen Lu Wushuang until she was reborn. Back then Ye Zhen was the first and most important maiden in the capital and Lu Wushuang was a nobody. During that time, she had never paid attention to Lu Wushuang, the latter had never caught her interest. After all, Lu Wushuang was only a daughter of a merchant, therefore she never stepped foot inside the Ye Mansion nor Ye Zhen’s abode.</p>
<p>How could such a girl compare with the eldest daughter of a famous family like the Ye?</p>
<p>But a mere merchant’s daughter had indeed defeated Ye Zhen, indisputably.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, please get up. Today, the palace is excited to see and bask in the glory of the flowers. Everyone should behave as usual. Please, do not bow before me.” Lu Wushuang personally helped Old Madam Lu to her feet without batting an eye at Ye Zhen as she did so.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu’s face was about to blossom with laughter at this remark, she then replied. “Wang Fei has a high status. How can an elderly woman such as myself not know of propriety?”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, please don’t speak of it.” Lu Wushuang chuckled and gestured to the palace maid behind her.</p>
<p>“Please give my grandmother a seat, and everyone as well, do sit down. I heard the excitement here from a distance, I wonder what it is all about?”</p>
<p>At those words, Ye Zhen looked at Teacher Shan, who was standing behind the crowd, and suddenly saw in her eyes a hint of hatred.</p>
<p>She was stunned by this for a moment. When she glanced back at her to see her expression more clearly, she was already sporting a look of calmness.1qcxa`</p>
<p><i>Had she seen wrong? If not, why did Teacher Shan give Lu Wushuang such a look?</i></p>
<p>“Your Imperial Highness, just now, Princess Liu Hua was wagering with Teacher Shan that her new student, our third sister, would never be admitted to the Academy for Women because she is one of us, born of merchant’s blood. Teacher Shan said that even if Third Sister only learned <i>The Thousand Character Classic</i>, she could still be admitted to the academy nonetheless.”</p>
<p>Lu Jing gestured anxiously before Lu Wushuang, she immediately stood up for she had wanted to take the opportunity to step on the foot of the princess as she spoke.</p>
<p>When Lu Wushuang heard those words, her eyes flashed with a ray of disgust. She looked faintly at Princess Liu Hua and then at the accusing Lu Jing.</p>
<p>“Now who still dares to say that the Lu Family are just mere merchants? The emperor has sealed Grandfather as the marquis of Anyang. Have you forgotten all about it?”</p>
<p>Lu Jing did not please but angered Lu Wushuang, the former’s face changed slightly and she turned her head to look at the ground.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Lu Wushuang and sneered at her in her heart. No one knew just how much Lu Wushuang disliked being known as a daughter of a merchant more than anything else.</p>
<p>Back when her soul was still wandering in the palace, she had witnessed Lu Wushuang executing her maid-in-waiting all because she had accidentally uttered the word “merchant” once.</p>
<p>Shaking slightly in her seat, Princess Liu Hua looked pale.</p>
<p>She was brimming with jealousy towards Lu Wushuang who had managed to gain the sole favor of the emperor. But now, even her mother had lost the trust she once held of the emperor.</p>
<p>Now,  she did not dare to be in such a situation with Lu Wushuang for the latter could crush her with only the tips of her fingers!</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang looked scornfully at Princess Liu Hua and then turned her eyes back towards them.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, is this my third sister?”</p>
