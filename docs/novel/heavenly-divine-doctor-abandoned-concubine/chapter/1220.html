<p>The next day, Lu Xiangzhi fetched Ye Zhen early in the morning to take her with him to meet Xu Lao.</p>
<p>“Brother, I don’t want to see Lord Xu. I am a girl! He won’t accept me!” Ye Zhen said grumpily.</p>
<p>“I heard that Lord Xu has a strange temperament, people think something is wrong with him. Anyway, he is an old man, different from ordinary people. Maybe he will accept you as his student.” Lu Xiangzhi responded with a grin.</p>
<p>With suspicious eyes, Ye Zhen raised her eyebrows and looked at him. “Is it Lu Lingzhi who asked you to come to me?”</p>
<p>And the grim from Lu Xiangzhi’s face disappeared immediately. He scolded sternly. “Yaoyao, that’s the eldest brother you are talking about. If I hear you being so disrespectful again, I will definitely let mother punish you.”</p>
<p>This was the first time Lu Xiangzhi had spoken a bit harshly to Ye Zhen that she couldn’t help but be stunned.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, your brother doesn’t want to scold you, but this temper is horrible. Whether you go to the academy in the future or get married, it is not good for you.” Lu Xiangzhi did not soften because of his sister’s expression and still taught her a lesson with a cold face.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen listened silently. She knew that her attitude towards Lu Lingzhi was strange. After all, she could not wholly regard herself as Lu Yaoyao. Every time she saw Lu Lingzhi, her blood boiled… she wanted to kill him immediately.</p>
<p>“I know,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice, and smiled, “I will take him as my eldest brother in the future.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi sighed and touched her head. “Yaoyao, you have to remember that this is no longer a border town. We can no longer say what we want and do what we want as before. Everything is different.”</p>
<p>“Mmm.” Ye Zhen continued to respond quietly.</p>
<p>Liu Shi embarrassed them in front of the whole family yesterday. There may be more contradictions in the future, so she should be more cautious.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother is thinking that you will have an exam tomorrow. He wants to take you out for a walk. Even if you don’t go to Lord Xu’s place, you can go out and relax, so as not to be too nervous tomorrow.” Lu Xiangzhi’s voice softened.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said, “I’m not going. Teacher Shan is leaving today. I’m going to see her off.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi was shocked. “Where is Teacher Shan going?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Ye Zhen shook her head gently; Teacher Shan did not tell her of her destination.</p>
<p>“All right then, only Eldest Brother and I will go to Lord Xu’s place.”</p>
<p>The matter was settled until Teacher Shan came out of her chambers and said, “Yaoyao will go.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned. “Teacher?”</p>
<p>“I live in the capital. You don’t have to send me off. Xu Lao is of great erudite. If he could teach you a few things, it will be of great benefit to you in the future.” Teacher Shan was about to leave when she heard the siblings standing in the courtyard talking.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi laughed. “Teacher Shan is absolutely right. Sister, this is a rare opportunity. Let’s go!”</p>
<p>With wary eyes, Ye Zhen looked back at Teacher Shan and saw that she just nodded gently and waved at her.</p>
<p>Even if she wanted to stay and send her off, she couldn’t. The latter didn’t want to, thinking that she was robbing her of some opportunity.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi led Ye Zhen to the front yard, where Lu Lingzhi was already waiting for them inside the carriage.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother!” Ye Zhen greeted him out loud to avoid Lu Xiangzhi from thinking that she disrespected Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi saw her arrive; his smile deepened. “Yaoyao, proceed to the back carriage, let’s go.”</p>
<p>She didn’t want to be in the same carriage as him, but she was left without a choice.</p>
