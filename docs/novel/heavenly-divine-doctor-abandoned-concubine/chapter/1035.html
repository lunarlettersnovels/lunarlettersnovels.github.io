            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 294 – The Lantern Festival (1)</strong></p>
<p>Lu Linghzi’s victory in the battle continued to fuel the cheer in the Lu Mansion. While every member- servant and master, were all smiles, Ye Zhen was exceptionally glum but none of it showed on her face. Every time an enemy triumphs, the heart sulks deeper, and she was the living example at the moment.</p>
<p>Her gloom prevailed for several days now, so much so that she didn’t even go to the Flower Market with Sun Wen on the first day of the year. Fortunately or unfortunately, her dispiritedness was, unequivocally, credited to the recent kidnapping incident. They all concluded the little girl had had quite the scare and dared not step out of the house.</p>
<p>One day, her good friends, Sun Wen and Chen Jinru decided to visit her at home. Having gotten wind of her dejected state of mind, they came to see her. The girls spent a lot of time together. In the end, the two even persuaded her to step out to have fun with them during the upcoming Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>It was only now that Ye Zhen remembered Mo Rongyi. She had agreed to meet the little prince on the day of the festival. As such, she didn’t promise Sun Wen.</p>
<p>In a blink of the eye, the fifteenth night of the first lunar month had arrived. This was the Lantern Festival Day. Perhaps this was the most loved festival, the air was especially rife with merriment. The six streets and three bazaars of the capital, be it nobility or plebians, every family hung the Fu symbol outside their homes. Every store spread a red carpet at its gates,  and almost every building in the capital was adorned with red lanterns. On the main street stood the Lantern Tower, an over one storey building, prepared especially for the people to display their handiwork. Needless to say, people took their lanterns a tad too seriously going so far as expending immense effort at making their own lanterns and ushering in the competitive spirit.</p>
<p>The last time that Ye Zhen met the little prince was quite some time ago. Given that, she didn’t expect the little prince would even remember they were to meet. So she didn’t wait for him nor made an attempt to remind him of the same and instead, decided to head out with Lu Xiangzhi to enjoy the lanterns tonight.</p>
<p>“Elder Brother, you still have your old clothes … Lend me a set,” Ye Zhen said, before declaring, “You shall take me to see the lanterns tonight.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi frowned and looked at his sister who wore the wilful air. “Yaoyao, we better not go, I’ll buy you a lantern.” He dissuaded her. The abduction incident had scared him to the bones. Although her cheerless self wasn’t a heartwarming sight, he still preferred her cooped up at home.</p>
<p>“Why not? Buying me one won’t be as exciting as when I wander outside.” Ye Zhen’s small mouth pouted. “Do you feel that I’m a burden that you don’t want to take me out? I’ll talk to Father.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I’m worried you’ll be in danger when you go out,” Lu Xiangzhi said, “there are too many people outside tonight.”</p>
<p>“How will I be in danger when there are so many people?” She demanded.</p>
<p>The doting brother was helpless and powerless before his adorable sister. Be it her frown at being refused or the haughty huff at being treated like a child, he simply couldn’t win over the cuteness and sternly put his foot down. But this was the most dangerous time of all. How many times had people gone missing from such events? How should he explain to her that even if she didn’t provoke danger, danger would seek her?</p>
<p>“Will Grandmother let you out?” Lu Xiangzhi had long accepted he was no match for her obstinacy. Without a recourse, he had to bring up the old madam.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and changed her tactics. She knew her brother best. All she and to act was cute, and the fellow would simply melt. “Why won’t you let me go out? Grandmother already told me to have fun.” Before he could even think of confirming or contradicting she added: “Hey, Elder Brother, you should still have your clothes when you were 13 or 14 years old. Give me a set.”</p>
<p>Her doe-like eyes, filled with anticipation and innocence pierced his heart. He sighed inwardly, he knew he was going to succumb to her charms yet again. Yes, he was a hopeless case, a paper tiger that his sister could easily set afire. In the end, he had the maid go to his room to look for the looks his sister wanted.</p>
<p>Puzzled, he asked, “Yaoyao, what do you want my clothes for?”</p>
<p>“You will know at night.” Ye Zhen revealed a fetching smile with a glint of mischief in her serene eyes.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi’s maid soon returned and said to Ye Zhen with a smile, “Madam used to make a lot of clothes for the fourth young master. Here are two sets of clothes that have never been worn. Now the fourth young master can’t wear them. This maidservant brought them to Third Miss to have a look.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pinched the cheek of the maid. “You are indeed becoming smarter and smarter. I shall accept these two sets of clothes. Elder Brother, remember to wait for me at night.”</p>
<p>“Do you really want to go out? Yaoyao … Yaoyao—” Lu Xiangzhi called, a final bid to change her mind as the girl turned her back on him.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen dashed her way out without once looking back.  Returning to her room, she immediately asked Dai Mei to give her a men’s hairdo. By the time she was done, putting on Lu Xiangzhi’s clothes and all, an engaging teenager stood in her stead.</p>
