            <p><strong>Chapter 407 – Fierce Tiger (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Imperial Brother, hurry and save Yaoyao. She’s… she’s about to be eaten by a tiger!” Mo Rongyi said while crying. His entire body was already weak from fright.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s heart was pinched fiercely. His expression soured even more as he shouted anxiously, “Where is Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“There, in the forest!” Mo Rongyi shouted as he pointed to the end of the road.</p>
<p>“Tang Zhen, first escort the little prince back to the palace.” Mo Rongzhan ordered coldly. The horse beneath him galloped forth like an arrow departed from a bow.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen was in a daze. He was more worried than anyone else for Yaoyao. But there were still assassins in the hunting grounds. He took a look at Mo Rongyi, gritted his teeth, and ordered the others, “The rest of you, escort Little Prince back. I need to help the emperor.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had never been this afraid of losing someone. His heart seemed to be clenched in the grasp of a large hand. As soon as he was told of the fact that that little girl would be hurt in the slightest, it hurt to the point where even breathing was hard. A raging flame of anger burned within the depths of his heart. No matter who, whoever planned this assassination, he would cut them into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao!” Mo Rongzhan could already see the horse that had been bitten to death. The fresh blood spilled all over the ground, seeming evermore disturbing.</p>
<p>But he didn’t see the tiger nor Yaoyao.</p>
<p><em><strong>Roar…</strong></em></p>
<p>The roar of a tiger sounded from within the forest. It sounded like it was currently angered.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan immediately leaped off his horse and ran into the forest. <em>Yaoyao, you can’t get into trouble! You have to be all right!</em></p>
<p>His feet moved like a breeze, leaping quickly with the sounds of the roar.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao….” When he saw what was before him, Mo Rongzhan felt that his heart was about to stop from fright.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was perched atop a tree, the crossbow in her hand continually shooting at the tiger. It had been shot twice and was currently head ramming the puny tree in rage.</p>
<p>Cracks had already formed on the tree’s trunks, and it was tipping to the side. Ye Zhen was about to lose her balance.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s heart was suspended in midair. He saw as the tree was taken down by the tiger, and watched as it leapt towards the little girl that had fallen on the ground.</p>
<p>He bellowed, and leapt up, heavily kicking the tiger away. “Yaoyao, are you all right?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen hadn’t expected the person to come save her to be Mo Rongzhan. She was still shaken, and could only stare at him dazedly.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked her over. “Are you hurt somewhere? Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine…,” Ye Zhen said quietly, her eyes still staring straight at him.</p>
<p>“That’s good then.” Mo Rongzhan let out a breath of relief. “I’ll take you away from here.”</p>
<p>The tiger that had been kicked in the head had already gotten back up. A growl sounded from deep down its throat. From the looks of it, it was angrier than it had been.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen tightly gripped Mo Rongzhan’s hand. “It’s too aggressive. Nothing happened even after I shot a couple arrows at it.”</p>
<p>“I’m here!” Mo Rongzhan said to her quietly, shielding her behind himself.</p>
<p>The tiger was enraged by these two dumb humans. The one he could have eaten in one bite had dared to climb atop a tree to avoid him and had also shot him with two arrows. The one that had come later had kicked his head into an aching pain. If he didn’t eat these two people, he would be unworthy of being a tiger.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had already struck out with his sword when the tiger had come pouncing over. Unfortunately, it dodged his attack and quickly struck again.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, leave first!” Mo Rongzhan said to the person behind him. If she stayed here, he would be distracted trying to protect her. He couldn’t put his all into killing this tiger.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at his broad figure. She hadn’t expected that he would one day so unboundedly come protect. She stared at him with a complicated gaze.</p>
<p>“Hurry and leave, did you hear me?” He used his sword to block the tiger’s claws, turning back to yell at her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew her presence would only make him distracted. She quietly said, “Be careful. You have to come back…”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan quietly answered her, escorting her out of the forest.</p>
<p>By now, Tang Zhen arrived as well, “Your Majesty, Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>Seeing Tang Zhen, Ye Zhen knew that Mo Rongzhan would safe. If they worked together, they would be able to defeat the tiger.</p>
<p>“Brother Tang, go help the Emperor…” Ye Zhen ran towards Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>When Mo Rongzhan heard her call Tang Zhen, he was slightly distracted. The tiger had wanted to kill Ye Zhen with a single bite, but seeing that she had escaped, and this man wielding a sword was difficult to deal with, he hurriedly turned, and pounced towards Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao!”</p>
