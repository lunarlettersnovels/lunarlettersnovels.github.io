<p>Ye Zhen scoffed at the thought of her saving his life in those days.</p>

<p><i>Perhaps when Mo Rongzhan knew that the person who saved him was her, he would have changed his verdict over her family’s fate. </i></p>
<p><i>Or, maybe—he would hate knowing the truth and scorn them even more.</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen was thinking about her own affairs in her heart when she heard Pei Shi saying to Lu Xiangzhi, “Wang Fei doesn’t like this nickname. You mustn’t mention it in front of others, lest it reaches Her Highness’ ears!”</p>
<p>“Mother, I will be very careful.”</p>
<p>Brushing off this subject completely, Ye Zhen went over and hugged Pei Shi’s arm. “Mother, there are still two days before I need to go to the academy. I want to see Teacher Shan tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes! You must send the good news to Teacher Shan and thank her properly!” She nodded in agreement. “She lives in Dongcheng. I’ll go with you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“But aren’t you going out with father tomorrow?” Ye Zhen laughed softly.</p>
<p>With this, Pei Shi wore a constricted face as it occurred to her that she and Lu Shiming had planned to go to his colleague’s house tomorrow to taste his one-month fermented wine.</p>
<p>“Can you then go there yourself?”</p>
<p>“Of course I can, Mother. I’m not a child anymore. I’ll go with Dai Mei.” Ye Zhen couldn’t help but chortle.</p>
<p>Pei Shi looked at her graceful daughter and felt some emotion in her heart. “I didn’t think our Yaoyao would grow up so fast.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi shook his head in sheer disagreement.</p>
<p>“I look at Yaoyao and I think that she is still the same as before. Mother, do you remember? When she was a child, she followed me out to play. As a result, she accidentally fell into a pit of cow dung… “</p>
<p>“Lu Xiangzhi!” Ye Zhen screamed at the mention of a disgusting memory. She didn’t want to dig it out of Lu Yaoyao’s memory at all but now that Lu Xiangzhi mentioned it, she couldn’t help but envision it.</p>
<p>She chased Lu Xiangzhi and said, “Don’t mention it again, or I’ll never let you live!”</p>
<p>Despite the threat, the mischievous Lu Xiangzhi laughed and ran out. “You don’t want me to mention this matter? But I could still remember another…”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Ye Zhen took down the silver whip hung on the wall, “Brother, don’t blame me for things I could do if you say it again.”</p>
<p>Watching her daughter chase her son, Pei Shi couldn’t help but smile, all the worries she felt a moment ago were gone. When Lu Xiangzhi looked in her way, his eyes pleading for help, she pointed at him and unexpectedly said, “You deserve that for making your sister angry!”</p>
<p>“Mother, stop my sister, please. That whip of hers is not for fun!”  Lu Xiangzhi cried as he and Ye Zhen ran in circles.</p>
<p>“Hit him!” Pei Shi instead urged Ye Zhen and lost it when the top of the whip hit Lu Xiangzhi’s advancing rear by a fraction. And she laughed more than what propriety allowed her.</p>
<p>Despite Lu Xiangzhi’s protests, Ye Zhen chased him with her whip relentlessly. Her robes not slowing her down even for a little.</p>
<p>“But Mother, I am also your child!” Lu Xiangzhi shouted.</p>
<p>“I am still Mother’s younger child!” Ye Zhen swung her whip at Lu Xiangzhi’s back.</p>
<p>“Ouch! You really hit me!” Lu Xiangzhi rubbed the sore area of his rear.</p>
<p>When he saw his sister’s frail but capable hands swing the whip again, Lu Xiangzhi cried for ultimate mercy. “Sister, I promise to not mention the past again!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen snorted. “Not a word?”</p>
<p>“I won’t mention that besides falling into a cow dung pit, you were pecked by a bird when you climbed the tree and ran home crying! Remember this?”</p>
<p>“No! I only remember Father hitting you with a whip like this!” Ye Zhen sneered and ran up to beat him.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi laughed and ran away. “All right! I won’t tease you anymore! Brother promises not to mention any of it! Are we good now?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head. “Only if I beat you up will you keep your mouth shut!” Lu Yaoyao used to get along with her brother in this way and Ye Zhen actually adored their relationship.</p>
<p>She also used to bicker like this with her second brother. Her eyes turned a little sour at the thought of him.</p>
