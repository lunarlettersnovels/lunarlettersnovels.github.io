            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 188 – Do You Resent Me? (2)</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan did not miss the change in her countenance. When he heard that his younger brother had made a bet with her, his first thought was that she intended to take advantage of the young prince to get his attention. It was not that no other woman had used this method before, but no one used it better than her.</p>
<p>He had a somewhat suppressed interest in her, but the bet had turned that interest into disdain.</p>
<p>However, she did not seem to know much about such a bet. “You did not bet with Little Prince?” Mo Rongzhan squinted slightly and looked at Ye Zhen coldly.</p>
<p>She could see the disgust in his eyes, she smiled lightly. “If Little Prince says so, then I did.”</p>
<p>An icy glare burst out of Mo Rongzhan’s eyes, Ye Zhen’s face paled. She doubted whether he would kill her the next moment.</p>
<p>“No matter what purpose you have, I will not kill you at this time.” Mo Rongzhan saw the vigilance in her eyes and said in a cold and dignified tone, “If the little prince’s illness cannot be cured, you will be buried with him. “</p>
<p><i>It seems that Mo Rongyi’s illness is really serious!</i> Ye Zhen frowned slightly, worried that the speculations were true.</p>
<p>She looked at Mo Rongzhan lightly. “What does the emperor mean? That this official’s daughter should treat Little Prince?”</p>
<p>There was a mocking sneer in the corner of Mo Rongzhan’s mouth. “You are not even a medical doctor, how can you cure the little prince?”</p>
<p>After a while, he added, “Are you afraid of death?” Mo Rongzhan stared at her eyes.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him and nodded softly. “I just do not want to die.”</p>
<p><i>It is not fear of death. But she refused to die… Yet.</i></p>
<p>“There is an Imperial Physician treating Little Prince. But since he requested to see you and you have made a wager with him, then I demand that you must alleviate the little prince. “</p>
<p>“Since His Majesty said so, it seems that I am left without a choice,” Ye Zhen said lightly. Undoubtedly, the man that stood before her was the most powerful person in this country. What else will he say and not be done?</p>
<p>Despite her bold words, Mo Rongzhan felt no anger. But instead, he found her dejection almost ridiculous. “Do you resent me in your heart?”</p>
<p>“I dare not, Your Majesty.” Ye Zhen bowed her head.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, do not disappoint me. The life of the little prince is more precious than yours.” Mo Rongzhan warned in a low voice.</p>
<p>The corners of Ye Zhen’s mouth lifted into a curve. Of course, she knew how insignificant her life was to him. His piercing words upon her death still haunted her like a bitter memory. How could she not know who he held important. She had once hoped to be one of them, but that was then. The past. About this matter, today’s Ye Zhen was clearer than Mo Rongzhan himself.</p>
<p>“If this official’s daughter can make Little Prince’s illness better, what will the emperor reward one?” Ye Zhen asked.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan puckered his lips, and looked coldly at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p><i>This girl … dared to talk about conditions without fear. Is she just too greedy? Or is she trying to prove something to me? </i></p>
<p>It was not that Ye Zhen was oblivious to the inexplicable contempt suffusing the emperor’s eyes. Even so, she looked at him stoically, containing her anger in her heart. His abhorrence did not affect her in the least. But those eyes had also hurriedly painted her as a greedy being, just because of the wager, whose truthfulness he had not bothered to ascertain. <b><i>This</i></b> irked her.</p>
<p>“If you can really make the little prince’s condition better, whether he heals or not, as long as you take care of him, watch him take medicines and be administered with acupuncture, I will grant you a wish.” Mo Rongzhan said coldly.</p>
<p>In Mo Rongzhan’s mind, it became clear that she was definitely not as simple as she seemed. He had never liked cunning women and this girl with innocent looks was slyer than a fox.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen slightly smiled. “Can I have any wish?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Mo Rongzhan was upset by her insatiable greed, although he did not know why he felt upset.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and counted herself blessed. “Thank you, Your Majesty. If His Majesty has no other orders, then this official’s daughter will go see Little Prince.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan waved impatiently as Ye Zhen asked for permission to leave, and it seemed that he did not want to see her again.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned and left the pavilion thinking about the bet she did not make. But it was not the time to dwell upon it. She had a pressing matter in hand.</p>
<p><i>Just how should I deal with Mo Rongyi’s case?</i></p>
<p>At the thought of Mo Rongzhan staring at her at the moment, Ye Zhen’s eyes flashed with a cold glint. Nothing had really changed in him. His thoughts, decisions… no one could ever change his mind.</p>
<p>He was still the same man she had married in her previous life. Cold, unfeeling, ruthless and full of suspicion. Just like how she was determined to marry him in the beginning, she had made it known that she liked him. But he still thought that she had other motives. He would rather lead an army for several years than see her.</p>
