<p>Back at the Lu Mansion, Ye Zhen was called over by Lu Shiming just after she got off the carriage.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen guessed that it must have something to do with Xu Lao. She came to Lu Shiming’s study with a face full of nervousness. In addition to Lu Shiming, Lu Lingzhi was there.</p>
<p>“Father, you wanted to see me?” Ye Zhen’s expression was uneasy, but her tone was light.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming beckoned her to come closer. “Where had you been that you came back just now?”</p>
<p>“I bought my favorite snacks and the best rouge in the capital for my mother. Father, the capital is wonderful. It is much livelier than the border town. I also went to the east side. The houses over there are so beautiful,” Ye Zhen said smilingly and directly sat down beside Lu Shiming.</p>
<p>“Just bought for your mother? What about me?” Lu Shiming pretended to ask crossly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen cocked her head and said sheepishly, “I couldn’t decide what to give you. I’ll buy you a present when I have the chance next time.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked at her with a smile and thought she was really adorable and lovely, but she seemed congenial only to others. As for him, Yaoyao never seemed to be coquettish with him.</p>
<p>“How did you think about going to the East Side?” Lu Lingzhi asked.</p>
<p>“I wanted to see all the places I haven’t been to,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>“Then why don’t you want to be Xu Lao’s student?” Lu Shiming asked.</p>
<p><i>Sure enough, he would ask this!</i></p>
<p>Her eyes, which grew darker, darted towards Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips. “What can Lord Xu teach me? If I become his student, I can no longer take the academy exam! I’m not interested in learning <i>Go</i>, calligraphy, and painting. Father, you know, I have to go to the School of Medicine to learn something useful. I don’t care about anything else.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? It’s no use learning from those. How many girls in the capital would like to be Xu Lao’s student? You are really…” Lu Shiming seemed angry with his daughter for wasting a great opportunity.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was quick to persuade her even further.</p>
<p>“If you become a student of Lord Xu, you would have a better reputation in the capital. It would be best for you. Even if you don’t go to the School of Medicine, it’s all right. Now, daughters of the Lu Family can have a good future without going to the Academy for Women.”</p>
<p>“What good future?” Ye Zhen asked with injustice. “Eldest Brother, tell me, am I only supposed to marry a man of good family and character in the future? I never worried about getting married. Besides, I have long set my eyes on the Academy for Women.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming felt an itch in his hand and could not help but give her a little scolding. “Yaoyao, what are you talking about? You will become of age; you can’t forever avoid thinking about it!”</p>
<p>Playing the daughter card, she willed herself to tear up.</p>
<p>“I am just telling the truth, Father. This must have been Eldest Brother’s idea.” Ye Zhen cried in pretense. “Anyway, I’m going to take the entrance examination tomorrow. Whether or not I can get in depends on my fate. What are you worried about? Let’s just see if I get in or not.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming shook his head and glanced at Lu Lingzhi. “Your sister… tsk tsk. I swear, she could kill people with her temper!”</p>
<p>“That’s enough for today, Third Sister.” Lu Lingzhi comforted her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wiped the tear that fell to her lips. “Father, if you have nothing else to say, then I’ll go and see Mother first.”</p>
<p>“Go, go!” Lu Shiming didn’t have the spirit to comfort his daughter at this time.</p>
