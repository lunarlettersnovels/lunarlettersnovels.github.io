            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter</strong> <strong>200</strong> <strong>–</strong> <strong>Squabble</strong> <strong>Over</strong> <strong>Meatballs</strong> <strong>(2)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen who wished to empty the whole bowl into Mo Rongzhan’s mouth, with immense grit, held herself back. Flashing a fake smile she said, “Your Majesty, these are all medicated meals. I’m afraid they are not suitable for your appetite. Why not let Madam Nuan go to the imperial kitchen and bring food more suitable to you?”</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8"></div>
<p>“I have never been picky about food.” Mo Rongzhan said flatly and stuffed a meatball into his mouth thwarting all means of retorts.</p>
<p><i>Why not choke him to death!</i></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had little expectation about the medicated diet Ye Zhen made. However, he was really shocked by the crisp and fresh meatballs he savored. It was truly delicious and did not even carry a hint of medicinal taste.</p>
<p>“Brother, try Yaoyao’s porridge,” Mo Rongyi said, ordering Madam Nuan to give Mo Rongzhan a bowl of porridge.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glared at the sight of Mo Rongyi simply giving out her special cuisines to Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>All along the said man had been observing her expressions. Seeing her reluctance, he broke into an indiscernible smile. Then, thinking as to how these medicated dishes were meant only for his brother, he felt a faint tug in his heart… <i>Am I not as good as Yi?</i></p>
<p>“Bring me the plate of dried meat.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was reaching the limits of her patience now. Gritting her teeth and said, “Your Majesty, these are for the little prince.” <i>If this went on, how would the prince be cured!</i></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan just looked at her with dark eyes. A magnificent face without a trace of anger made one feel more repressed, and right now was no exception.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, hurry. You can make more later.” Mo Rongzhan did not back down.</p>
<p>Compelled by the emperor’s command, she brought out the dish, all the while cursing in her heart. <i>This… this fellow… What a hooligan! Argh! Wish he suffers a stomach ache upon eating… Has he never seen food? Will not even spare his little brother’s food…</i></p>
<p>However, in her disappointment, she forgot that her dried meat was filled with <i>lingquan</i>. How could it make people suffer a stomach ache? If anything, this ‘imperial hooligan’ would be stronger.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt that Mo Rongzhan’s whole persona was up to no good, he was brazenly shameless, domineering and had zero consideration for anyone! To think she was once in love with such a man… she loathed him even more.</p>
<p>“Yi, don’t you feel any pain?” Mo Rongzhan saw that his younger brother had eaten a lot of food and worried that he would suffer from pain for a while.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t hurt. I feel very comfortable.”</p>
<p>When Mo Rongzhan looked at Ye Zhen, his eyes held a profound meaning. “Did you make all of this by yourself?” Ever the skeptic emperor was sure to voice his doubts.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded blankly.</p>
<p>“Then you may stay in the palace as a physician, making medicated meals for the little prince every day.”</p>
<p>He felt that she would be very happy with his grace. After all, who would not want to escape the arduous journey one would have to take through the School of Medicine to become a physician! He had given her a smooth and easy out, not to mention the prestige that would bring her and her family.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, if the condition of the little prince improves by tomorrow, he only needs to take the medicated meals for two more days. And, this official’s daughter shall return to school,” Ye Zhen said with a straight face.</p>
<p><i>Is this a veiled refusal?</i> Mo Rongzhan looked at her, confusion written across his face. This girl was simply beyond his understanding. He could not believe she had turned down his offer in a roundabout manner. Turned down… <i>why?</i></p>
<p>“You entered the School of Medicine, is it not because you wanted to become an imperial physician?”</p>
<p>Contrary to how he perceived her, Ye Zhen was not someone who could be swayed by a mere display of sovereignty. He may be the emperor, and she is just a young girl, but her self-esteem would not fall short.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ye Zhen nodded. “That’s different from being a physician <i>now</i>.”</p>
<p>She did not want to enter the palace without justification, least of all as a benefaction from the man she immensely loathed. There was once a time when she would have cut her heart out for him without a word, but now, she was unresigned to accept his reward even for the sake of keeping appearances.</p>
<p>Most of all, she did not care about giving face to the man who trampled her heart over and over, even if he was the supreme power. Also, if she were to enter the palace now, no matter how hard she tried, she would still be acknowledged as the Residing Imperial Physician, but in reality, it was just a glorified name for—a trivial medical woman.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan snorted<i>. Did she really agree to come here out of good intentions alone? Doesn’t she want something in return? I refuse to believe it!</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him with limpid eyes. She had come here out of concern for the sick prince. But, yes, she indeed wanted to get something out of this… to pave the way for her original plans.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, when the emperor presented such an offer, in such a crude manner, she could not help but refuse. The reason was plain and simple—she did not want to enter the palace because of his grace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 201 – Ignoring Him (1)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ye Zhen had unwittingly refused Mo Rongzhan. She was bracing for the ensuing tempest, after all he was the emperor and a proud one at that. She knew his temperament all too well. His pride, curtness, disdain and obstinacy, if he did not have the ability to govern a country, he would have been branded a tyrant by now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss Lu, leave at once.” Mo Rongzhan commanded as he suddenly did not want the presence of the girl who so blatantly rebuffed his grace. It was akin to looking down upon him and his sovereignty. He was being benevolent by asking her to leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty, I still have to watch the little prince take his medicine.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he doesn’t want to see me, why not get lost himself?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongyi suddenly raised his head. “I still have to take medicine?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ye Zhen smiled. “Of course, how can one get better without taking medicine? I personally brewed the medicine today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hope of best results, she had also added a drop of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lingquan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the medicine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that I feel better with a medicated diet, I don’t need to take medicine.” Mo Rongyi reasoned and frowned at the thought of the acrid medicine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Treating only the symptom but not the root cause will not make one’s condition better. Having a medicated diet alone is not a cure to your illness.” Ye Zhen patiently explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well then.” Mo Rongyi nodded reluctantly, it was not like he had a choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ye Zhen smiled. “I’ll get the medicine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongzhan’s eyes were cold. He always felt that he had no sense of existence in front of this girl. But today and now… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is she deliberately ignoring my presence? </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does she even take me for a person let alone the emperor? How can there exist someone like this?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty, this official’s daughter will take her leave.” Ye Zhen curtsied, all along her head bowed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongzhan nodded in return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether he was unhappy or not, Ye Zhen did not care a whit. As soon as she was done speaking, she turned around, not bothering to even wait for his response. Then, with a back ramrod straight and a head held high, she swiftly strode out under his watchful, icy gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the emperor’s eyes were glued on the departing figure, unbeknownst to him, there were a pair of eyes glued on to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongyi had carefully taken in the interaction between his brother and his friend. He was puzzled. He was too young to understand certain things, but there was one thing that even a child could understand: hostility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He gazed at Mo Rongzhan curiously. “Brother, do you not like Lu Yaoyao?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why do you think so?” Mo Rongzhan asked lightly. Although the question shocked him, he was able to deftly mask it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If not, why do you make things difficult for her?” Mo Rongyi carefully looked at his brother, anticipating his reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongzhan’s face turned gloomy. He felt he was wrongly accused and that too by his own blood brother! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When have I made things difficult for her?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it is not obvious, I can still see that elder brother is making things difficult for Lu Yaoyao</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But who is to tell him so?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry, Elder Brother. Yaoyao is not that kind of woman. She just stayed for my treatment, not for you,” Mo Rongyi said earnestly. This child had somehow managed to hit the nail on the head with respect to the monarch’s misgivings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongzhan looked at his brother for a long time. If one were to look closely, they would catch on to the myriad emotions flitting past those orbs. And yet, he did not utter a word. Deep within he knew, his little brother was right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He abhorred those women who tried to come on to him, fawn over him and whatnot. He had always dismissed them brusquely and without qualms. He was the emperor, holding the supreme power that no one could resist or refuse. Why would this girl be different? However, he felt bad when he was confronted by Yi that the woman did not enter the palace for him. It felt like he was being proven wrong. But would he admit?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know!” Mo Rongzhan gnashed his teeth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brother, go and accompany Wang Fei Lu. I will take the medicine obediently.” Mo Rongyi blinked. He thought that Mo Rongzhan came to make sure he takes his medicine. But now that he had been here for quite a while, he felt he was getting impatient because of the delay. All he could do was assure him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongzhan frowned. He had not been to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility for a long time. He did not want to see Lu Wushuang’s two-faced countenance at all. The more she pretended to be virtuous and dignified, the more he felt she was too fake. If she was truly that little girl he met before, she would not be like this. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would she be like?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cunning… clever… intelligent. She must be charming enough that people would envy her.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immersed in his conjectures, a vague figure suddenly appeared in Mo Rongzhan’s mind. As the hazy figure became clearer and clearer, he was stupefied. His expression changed for the worse and he suddenly stood up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ridiculous!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brother?” Mo Rongyi was startled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m leaving,” Mo Rongzhan said on the spur of the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongyi was confused. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I say something wrong?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongzhan didn’t look at his brother, so missed his expression of surprise. Taking brisk and long strides he walked towards the exit. When he had reached the door, he saw Ye Zhen coming with a tray. Under the light of the setting sun, her skin seemed as white as porcelain, her face shone with radiance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vague image of the little girl whom he was seeking for so long came to his mind, but unbeknownst to him, Ye Zhen’s delicate figure replaced it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty.” Ye Zhen curtsied, faintly smiled as she walked past him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongzhan stared at her for a while, and left the prince’s residence with a gloomy face.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could Lu Yaoyao have something to do with the little girl I am seeking?</span></i></p>
