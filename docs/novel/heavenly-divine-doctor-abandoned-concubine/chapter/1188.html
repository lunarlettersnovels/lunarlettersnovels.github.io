            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 139 – The Wang Fei Summons (2)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen only learned today that the Lu Family had taken up the shop she built as a rival. She looked at the old madam with some embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I don’t know… I bought the perfume only because I thought you would like it.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu patted her on the hand and said, “You have just arrived in the capital. Naturally, you don’t know anything about it, but it’s nothing. Since our Lu Family was knighted, our business has been transferred to other places so that no one will think that our Lu Family is bullying others. It doesn’t matter if you go shopping at Qianjin.”</p>
<p>“Mmm.” Ye Zhen smiled and nodded, pretending to be ignorant, and asked, “Is our Lu Family’s business now managed by Second Uncle? Doesn’t he often go to the sea? “</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu laughed. “He doesn’t go to sea very often either. He is in the trade street of Jinkou City, which is the original foundation of our Lu Family.”</p>
<p>The Lu Family started out as merchants and later, as Jinkou City started doing overseas trade, their business grew bigger and bigger until such time that the dynasty labeled the family as imperial merchants.</p>
<p>Only those noble families were the ones who always looked down upon the Lu Family’s nobility which, in all facts, didn’t stem from heritage.</p>
<p>The boost of their business was no secret and this made Ye Zhen want to know more about the other side of Jinkou City.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, didn’t you say that Second Uncle would be coming back soon? Why hasn’t there been any news?”</p>
<p>She queried as she had heard the last time that Second Lord Lu was coming back to be with his mother on her birthday. Yet, many days had already passed without news of his plan of return.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, he will soon arrive.” Old Madam Lu gave an assuring smile, but the worry was noticeably etched on her face.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen thought the discussion was over, Old Madam spoke to her again.</p>
<p>“There is something else I need to tell you…The wang fei’s edict came from the palace today, asking you to enter the palace tomorrow. My dear, she wants to see you.”</p>
<p>Abruptly, Ye Zhen’s face grimaced, and her smile froze on the corners of her mouth. “Wang Fei… wants to see me? Grandmother, what is going on?”</p>
<p>“You have been admitted to the academy, therefore, brought honor to Wang Fei. She is very happy and probably wants to give you something,” Old Madam Lu said.</p>
<p><i>She didn’t want to enter the palace at this time!</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen resisted greatly in her heart. She was unwilling to meet Lu Wushuang, especially when she had no protection now. What if Lu Wushuang casually found an excuse to kill her inside her palace?</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I have never been to the palace, for fear of trouble.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry! Grandmother will accompany you to the palace tomorrow herself.” Old Madam Lu cheered her up.</p>
<p><i>So it is tomorrow… </i>Ye Zhen felt herself crumble inside.</p>
<p>Seeing the reluctance on her face, Lu Jing said sourly, “Third Sister, we haven’t been to the palace yet and this is a rare opportunity. Would you dare refuse?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you go in my stead?” Ye Zhen asked with an innocent smile.</p>
<p>“I was not invited!” Lu Jing threw a scornful look and took Ye Zhen’s words as a showoff. Even if she was envious and jealous, she would never admit it but her actions never failed to unveil her.</p>
<p>Before it could escalate into something more serious, Old Madam Lu intervened. “Wang Fei will let you enter the palace in the future. She will just be meeting Yaoyao first. Don’t fret.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandmother.” Lu Jing and Lu Fang soon reluctantly smiled and bowed their heads in embarrassment.</p>
<p>The Chen Sisters who were also around were somewhat uncomfortable, especially having heard of the glorious invitation from the wang fei to anyone but the girl they used to underestimate before.</p>
<p>Chen Liping’s shining eyes were already glued on Ye Zhen, wishing that they exchange places. But what they didn’t know was that Ye Zhen was secretly in chaos, for she understood too well Lu Wushuang’s jealousy and malice.</p>
<p>This invitation was not for the wang fei to congratulate her personally but rather, Lu Wushuang was unhappy and would love to see if she indeed had the potential to morph into a threat in the near future</p>
<p>And if she saw her as one, she would find means to kill her.</p>
