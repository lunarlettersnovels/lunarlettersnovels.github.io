            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 348 – Unannounced Arrival</strong></p>
<p><em>For it to be rubbed to this extent…</em> At the sight of the scabs on her inner thighs, his heart tightened. <em>How painful she must have felt!</em></p>
<p>Taking out a porcelain bottle from his sleeve, he gently dabbed the <em>xuelian</em> ointment on her wound. Although the wound had formed a scab and was still red, smearing this <em>xuelian</em> ointment on it would at least prevent a scar in the future.</p>
<p>While dabbing the salve, Mo Rongzhan spent a lot of effort to suppress the wild and fanciful thoughts in his mind. Once done, he put all her clothes back on properly. He couldn’t let her find out he had been here, or else she would probably never see him again for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>“Little Girl, I won’t marry you to anyone else.” Mo Rongzhan whispered. “You will be mine eventually.” He glanced back at her one last time before leaving.</p>
<p>As he stepped out of Lu Mansion, Eunuch Fu appeared out of nowhere and looked at his tensed liege. He said, “Your Majesty—”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan just glanced at him coldly.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the weather is too dry, you…  You have a nosebleed.” Once Eunuch Fu finished speaking, he only wished he could bury himself on the ground.</p>
<p>“—” Mo Rongzhan expressionlessly reached out and touched his nose. Sure enough, the palm of his hand was covered with blood. His face sank instantly.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu immediately offered a silk handkerchief with both hands and buried his head even lower. With a livid expression, Mo Rongzhan wiped off the blood without a word.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, tomorrow this slave will invite Imperial Physician Huang to give you—”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s frosty gaze shut the astute eunuch immediately.</p>
<p>“Return to the palace,” Mo Rongzhan said coldly. He knew all too well the reason for his nosebleed.</p>
<p><em>It’s all that bothersome Little Girl’s fault!</em></p>
<p>Back in the palace, Mo Rongzhan first went to change his clothes. Gathering his master’s soiled clothing, a thoughtful Eunuch Fu softly asked, “Your Majesty, do you wish to summon Xianfei?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t good for one to hold back one’s fires, not to mention he was still the emperor. As for solving it on his own… that wasn’t a good thing either.</p>
<p>“Get out!” Mo Rongzhan said angrily.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>All through the night, Ye Zhen slept very deeply and woke up in high spirits the next day. However, it was unknown if it was a mere illusion or not, she had this incessant feeling that something was amiss.</p>
<p>“Yu Ping, did anyone come to my room last night?” Ye Zhen asked suspiciously. She faintly felt someone had come last night, but she had slept too deeply and didn’t know who it was she had sensed.</p>
<p>Yu Ping shook her head. “This servant slept soundly last night and didn’t hear anyone coming.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. <em>Perhaps she was overthinking.<br>
</em><br>
After breakfast, she went to pay respect to Old Madam Lu and recounted the happenings in Jinwu City.</p>
<p>“When will your eldest brother get better?” Old Madam Lu asked. All she was bothered about was her grandson’s recovery. Looking at his complexion yesterday, she knew he had not really recovered.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was silent for a moment before saying, “Imperial Physician Qi is already thinking of a way.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu’s face fell, she spoke with tears in her eyes. “I had thought your eldest brother could finally enjoy a good time after all the hardships are over… But how could we know that Heavens would let him suffer such a torment instead?”</p>
<p><em>Isn’t this Lu Lingzhi’s retribution?</em> Ye Zhen honestly did not know what to say to comfort the old matriarch. After all, she didn’t really want that man to recover.</p>
<p>Still, to keep up the façade, Ye Zhen tried to comfort her. “Grandmother, don’t be sad. Imperial Physician Qi may be able to find a way,” she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>It took some time for Old Madam Lu’s sullen mood to recover. Once she regained her spirits,  she said, “Come, accompany me to take a look at Lingzhi. I was not able to talk to him properly yesterday.”</p>
<p>Despite her reluctance, Ye Zhen still nodded her head when she saw the old matriarch’s eyes still held traces of redness.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi had yet to marry, so he lived in the outer courtyard. However, what greeted them on arrival was his poison flaring bout. They could see that though Lu Lingzhi was clenching his teeth and holding back his scream, he was still sweating profusely. Fortunately, after he drank the medicine, he finally relaxed.</p>
<p>Seeing her favorite grandson enduring such a torment, Old Madam Lu simply felt incredibly pained as if she were experiencing the same thing. She held Lu Lingzhi in her arms and teared up as she said, “My pitiful Lingzhi.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I’ll be alright soon.” Lu Lingzhi comforted in a low voice.</p>
<p>Next to him, Pei Shi’s eyes had reddened, tears threatening to spill out. Lowering her head, she quickly wiped them away.</p>
<p>As if that was the cue they were waiting for, everyone in the room burst into tears. However, Ye Zhen didn’t want to pretend to be sad for Lu Lingzhi, so she quietly retreated from the room.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>She had just come out of the room, when she heard someone calling her. Ye Zhen subconsciously looked up when she heard the familiar voice and was surprised to see the man striding in her direction.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty?”</p>
