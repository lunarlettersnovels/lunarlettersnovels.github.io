            <p><strong>Chapter 478 – Keep Your Word</strong></p>
<p>For the first time in his life, Zhao Tianji had met a woman who dared to bargain with him, and she was a little girl. She was only Huangfu Chen’s apprentice, and even the man himself couldn’t cure him when he wasn’t seriously ill. A young girl like her dared to let him promise.</p>
<p>Did she know who he was? She was probably the only one in the world who dared to speak to him like this.</p>
<p>“No one can negotiate with me,” Zhao Tianji looked at her and said indifferently.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded seriously. It could be seen that he was a person who would not heed the opinions of others. This kind of person was used to being solipsistic. “That’s because no one can cure your illness. I’m at least certain, right?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji had looked for countless doctors over the years but none could cure him. For the first time, here was someone who told him his condition before even taking his pulse. She also claimed that she could cure him. This was very tempting for him. “If you can’t cure me, all of you will die. I’ve killed many doctors, I don’t mind a few more.”</p>
<p>“You even want to kill my master?” She raised her eyebrows. <em>Didn’t he know Huangfu Chen? Could it be that he would not let her off?</em></p>
<p>“Why should I let Huangfu Chen go?” he asked with a smile.</p>
<p>She felt he was truly an unpredictable person. She asked indifferently, “Will you agree to let us go?”</p>
<p>“After you’ve cured me, come and talk to me about the conditions,” he said coldly.</p>
<p>“In a month, as long as you look well, you will let us go. We have more important things to do.” Ye Zhen took a few steps back and looked at Zhao Tianji seriously. She still had to go to Huaijiang.</p>
<p>Qiu Yuan cursed angrily. “Do you really think we wouldn’t dare to kill you?”</p>
<p>“I think you will definitely kill me. If that’s the case, why should I cure you? At worst, we’ll die together,” she retorted.</p>
<p>“Why is it a month?” he eyed her gloomily.</p>
<p>“After a month we have something else to do. If we don’t show up at that time, people will definitely suspect that something happened to us. When that time comes, if they launch a large-scale search, will you be able to escape the officers and soldiers of the imperial court here?” she said.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji looked at her deeply. “Okay, I promise.”</p>
<p>“Then keep your word, don’t renege,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>Anger flashed through Zhao Tianji’s eyes. ”I, Zhao Tianji, have always kept my word.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen walked back and sat down on the low stool next to the couch. She stretched out her hand to take his pulse. Zhao Tianji’s illness was somewhat different from the frozen illness mentioned in the 《Qi Medical Classics》, but the symptoms were the same. The frozen illness usually didn’t last three years, but Zhao Tianji had this symptom from the beginning. It seemed that it had been more than three years.</p>
<p>“When did you stop walking?” she asked, checking his feet, while her mind rapidly sifted through the medical canon.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen must have read the 《Qi Medical Classics》. If he’d used the same method to treat, Zhao Tianji’s illness was different from that mentioned in the canon.</p>
<p><em>What was the problem?</em></p>
<p>Liang Yin answered on Zhao Tianji’s behalf, ”Master has not been able to walk since a year ago.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded and checked his legs. As expected, she didn’t feel anything. “Are there any fractures?”</p>
<p>“No,” Liang Yin said.</p>
<p>“What was it like when he got sick?” Ye Zhen poked the muscles on his leg. She felt that Zhao Tianji’s illness was a little troublesome.</p>
<p>Liang Yin glanced at her. “It hurt all over.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s hand paused. “Even if you don’t touch him, the entire body hurts?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Liang Yin nodded coldly and looked at Ye Zhen viciously.</p>
<p>“I haven’t encountered this disease of yours before, so I’m not quite sure if I can cure you.” Ye Zhen looked at the man’s white and sturdy arms. “Do you feel your hands lack strength and are numb?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji opened his eyes, and his long and narrow orbs swept towards Ye Zhen like a sharp sword. “You just said that it could be cured.”</p>
<p>“I can only try. If my judgment is correct, then your illness can be cured. If you can’t trust me, you can invite my master to treat you,” she said.</p>
<p>“If he had treated it well, he would have already cured it,” Zhao Tianji said indifferently.</p>
<p><em>So he had always thought that Huangfu Chen was deliberately not treating him?</em></p>
<p>“You seem to have misunderstood my master. His medical skills are better than mine. He will definitely be able to cure you.”</p>
<p>“With your life in my hands, he will naturally cure me,” Zhao Tianji said coldly.</p>
<p><em>He thought that she could cure him because Huangfu Chen taught her? This man is indeed arrogant!</em></p>
<p>“Then I’ll give you acupuncture first,” Ye Zhen said, not wanting to argue with him. In any case, he could think as he liked.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you can give me acupuncture?” he asked.</p>
<p>She smiled and said, “If you can’t believe it, then don’t go through with acupuncture. Of course, you can find my master, but aren’t you afraid that my master will harm you?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji looked at the little girl calmly. “Aren’t you afraid of me at all?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid.” Ye Zhen took out a silver needle and turned to Liang Yin. “Take off your master’s clothes.”</p>
<p>Liang Yin didn’t budge. He just looked at his master, with his consent, he went over to help him up. Qiu Yuan immediately came over to lend a hand.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen quietly sized up Zhao Tian Ji. In fact, she was not confident that she would be able to cure him. But now that she was riding a tiger, she did not dare to show any hesitation. Otherwise, as long as she showed fear, she believed this Island Lord would not hesitate to kill her.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, please.” Liang Yin looked politely at Ye Zhen. Although his tone was polite, his eyes did not look so gentle.</p>
<p>“The areas I want to acupuncture are the legs and hands, so tell me if you feel any pain,” Ye Zhen said to Zhao Tianji.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji did not even answer her. He just looked at her coldly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had to start acupuncture, she would stab all twenty-four needles into the acupoints on both of his legs. The skin on his calves was white, probably because he hadn’t walked around; he looked a little thin. <em>Is this the muscle atrophy mentioned in</em>《Qi Medical Classics》<em>?</em></p>
<p>“Do you feel anything?” she asked as she stabbed the last needle into the acupoint in his calf and looked up at him.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji’s forehead broke out in a fine sweat. “Sore and numb.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” She nodded and continued administering the needles to his arms.</p>
<p>“Master, do you feel your legs?” Qiu Yuan asked with some surprise.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji obviously had not reacted, until Qiu Yuan reminded him. He was shocked, his legs had not felt anything for a year, this was the first time he felt something, even if the feeling was a little unbearable.</p>
<p>“Who did you learn your acupuncture from?” Zhao Tianji asked, it wasn’t that he hadn’t had people do acupuncture before, but it didn’t feel like this.</p>
<p>“Naturally, I learned Qi’s acupuncture method.” No one taught her the acupuncture method, she learned it through reading 《Qi Medical Classics》, and today was the first time she had administered it on someone.</p>
