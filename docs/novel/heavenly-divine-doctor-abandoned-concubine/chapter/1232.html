            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 95 – Returning To The Palace (2)</h3>
<p>The next day, Chengde Mountain Villa had been in a tight and rambunctious situation. The emperor was finally returning to the palace!</p>
<p>At last, Ye Zhen did not have to worry about meeting him every time she was on a hunt.</p>
<p>However, Ye Zhen was not happy for the following two days because Pei Shi brought Lu Lingzhi to the Zhuangzi Hot Springs.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, your eldest brother’s feet need to be carefully nursed. Please do take care of him in your free time.” Pei Shi told Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at Lu Lingzhi lightly. “Mother, Teacher Shan has given me a lot of homework.”</p>
<p>Even in her free time, she wouldn’t come to tend to Lu Lingzhi’s injury.</p>
<p><i>She abhorred him!</i></p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi muttered beside her. “Yaoyao, I showed your medicine to Mother. She has brought all the ingredients needed. All you have to do is make another bottle for Eldest Brother. The last time I used your medicine for Eldest Brother, his injury was much better!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had a real impulse to beat Lu Xiangzhi to death. He gave Lu Lingzhi the medicine! <i>What a waste!</i></p>
<p>Pei Shi shot Ye Zhen a confused look. “Yaoyao, I didn’t teach you how to make medicine. When did you learn it?”</p>
<p>“Mother, you have given me so many books. I usually find them interesting, so I learned how to prepare medicine myself,” Ye Zhen said with a smile, using the excuse that she had already thought over.</p>
<p>Pei Shi laughed and felt relieved. It seems that her daughter was really gifted in this aspect. “Well, I’ll teach you how to attend to your eldest brother.”</p>
<p>“Mother, Eldest Brother has you to take care of him.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! I have to go back to the capital tomorrow. If I’m not around to look after your eldest brother, who would?” Pei Shi gave Ye Zhen a look. “Don’t be lazy!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen thought that the Lu Family still had a maid who was eyeing Lu Shiming. In this case, it would be good for Pei Shi to go back. Naturally, she didn’t want to see Xue Liu fawn over her husband, after all.</p>
<p>“I know, Mother, you can rest assured that you can return to Father who would not be able to leave you,” Ye Zhen said in a delicate voice.</p>
<p>Pei Shi’s face became feverish and she looked at her daughter fiercely.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed and ran out.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was shocked when he saw the light and charming figure run out of the door. This was the first time he had seen his third sister playing coquetry!</p>
<p>He didn’t know why but he thought of Ye Zhen again. If Ye Zhen had been like his third sister at that time… he couldn’t imagine what would happen.</p>
<p>“Until now, your third sister is just like that, and you will have to shoulder more responsibilities in the future.” Pei Shi smiled back and looked apologetic at Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>Of which, the man replied in a low voice. “My third sister is so lovely and adorable that it is impossible to not be fond of her.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi smiled and said, “You don’t know, she used to be so naughty when she was still a child. I myself wanted to banish her every time she did something wrong. But then, she’d play softly on me and I’d lose all my temper, just wanting to hold her in my arms.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi laughed and could imagine Lu Yaoyao’s naughty and lovely appearance as a child.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was in a bit of a bad mood because Lu Lingzhi lived in Zhuangzi. She spent the whole day practicing calligraphy in the house. Teacher Shan thought she was worried about the exam, so she called her out and let her relax.</p>
<p>“Efforts should be made, but we should not be too nervous.” She reminded her.</p>
<p>“Teacher, let’s go to the hot springs for a dip. As it’s said in the medical book, more than one dip can make people feel better physically and mentally, and the skin will also become better!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen spoke with a carefree smile, not at all worried about meeting Mo Rongzhan again.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan considered it for a moment and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>After spending days with Lu Yaoyao, she had eventually taken a liking to the young miss. <i>Who wouldn’t like a girl who has such a lovely character as Yaoyao? </i></p>
<p><i>A pity, her surname is Lu. </i></p>
