<p>“I can’t tell who he is. He’s not from the Ye Family, but he knows Ye Zhen and you very well. You and Ye Zhen resemble each other. How can I not guess the truth?” Teacher Shan said.</p>
<p>This was the first time Ye Zhen had heard that someone had unexpectedly been instructing Teacher Shan.</p>
<p><em>Being able to order about someone of status such as Teacher Shan’s … one is certainly not an ordinary person. Who is it? Does someone already know our identity as sisters? But what’s his reason for secretly helping us?</em></p>
<p>“What truth?” Ye Zhen asked.</p>
<p>“What is your real relationship with Ye Zhen?” Teacher Shan asked in a low voice and continued, “Yaoyao, aren’t you curious at all? Although people may look similar, there can’t be such timely coincidences.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head gently. Even if the answer was on the tip of her tongue, that her heart was jumping to reveal the truth, she could not. This was not the moment. “Teacher, the one who asked you to help me … why is he doing this?”</p>
<p>This time Teacher Shan shook her head and smiled. “I don’t understand why he is doing it. He is the most unpredictable person I have ever met. Now I can’t continue to be your teacher. Maybe he will arrange something else.”</p>
<p>As time went by, Teacher Shan was convinced that her master hadn’t sent her on a wild goose chase. He worked in mysterious ways, and she knew better than to question his intent or demand an explanation from him. So, she had drawn her own conclusions, which included asking Pei Shi if Lu Yaoyao was her biological daughter.</p>
<p>The more Ye Zhen listened, the more confused she felt. She really couldn’t figure out who could be silently looking out for her. When she was wandering the palace as a spirit, no one had cried injustice on her behalf. Nor had anyone rebelled. Now in this life, apart from those trusted confidants of her father, who had yet to know and acknowledge her existence, she could think of no one who would extend a kind word towards her let alone generous help.</p>
<p><em>Then he … Does he know that Lu Yaoyao is Ye Zhen?</em></p>
<p>The thought sent a shiver down her spine, Ye Zhen broke out into cold sweat all over her body. This was her biggest secret, it was impossible for someone else to know!</p>
<p>“Teacher … ”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not know how to describe the shock her heart felt at the moment. All of a sudden, she became aware that someone was silently watching her. The feeling suffusing her heart was very unsettling.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It’s not a bad thing.” Teacher Shan reassured her with a smile.</p>
<p><em>Not necessarily a good thing! </em>Ye Zhen smiled despite herself.</p>
<p>“I have been in the border town since I was a child. No matter where I go, people think that I am a wild girl. That person, capable of earning your respect, must be a superior one. How could I make someone superior regard me worthy of his attention?”</p>
<p>“Since one is superior, naturally one can see more than ordinary people,” Teacher Shan said with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyebrows wrinkled even tighter. She very much liked to know who this person was. However, she also knew that Teacher Shan was highly unlikely to reveal the person’s identity.</p>
<p>“You need not worry. He’s unlikely to show up.” Teacher Shan said softly, “The relationship between you and Ye Zhen is worth checking.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ye Zhen nodded gently.</p>
<p>No one knew of her relationship with her sister better than she did. She didn’t want to tell her secret to Teacher Shan before because she was hesitant. Now that she thought about it and knew not who the person behind Teacher Shan was, she dared not act rashly and reveal her secret. Who knew what danger she might put herself into!</p>
<p>Now that Teacher Shan had made her point, she didn’t continue talking about the academy. Instead, she said, “I heard Imperial Physician Qi saying that you are very talented in medicine. Others have to learn the knowledge for one year, you learned it in a month. This year, you may be able to enter the palace ahead of time to become an imperial physician.”</p>
<p>Nowadays, it was more and more difficult to become an imperial physician. Only two students were chosen from the School of Medicine every year. According to the usual rules, it was impossible to choose from the newly enrolled students. But Ye Zhen could take the exam. If she passed, she could strive to be a candidate.</p>
<p>“I’ll take the exam,” Ye Zhen said with a smile before hesitatingly adding, “However, I can’t guarantee the result.”</p>
<p>“Eight points for effort and two for providence.” Teacher Shan smiled and said, “I won’t say goodbye to your mother. Tell her as you return.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, where would you go after leaving the capital?” Ye Zhen asked.</p>
<p>It hurt her that she had to leave, she wanted her to stay with her so badly. She felt like a piece of her heart was being slowly sliced away.</p>
<p>“The world is so huge, I haven’t walked half of it. Naturally, I will go and finish the other half,” Teacher Shan said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen held up the teacup and said, “Teacher, I shall take tea instead of wine and accompany you in this farewell dinner.”</p>
<p>Teacher Shan nodded, smiled clinking cups, and drinking tea with her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>When she left, Ye Zhen did not directly return to the Lu Mansion. She went to Qianjin to meet Hong Ling. It had been quite some time since her last visit because she had been too busy. Having gotten the chance, she grabbed the opportunity to visit her confidant.</p>
<p>Hong Ling happened to be in the store. Upon seeing Ye Zhen, she came forward to her like she were attending to any other distinguished guest and led her to the wing on the second floor.</p>
