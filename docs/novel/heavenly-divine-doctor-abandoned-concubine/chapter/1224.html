<p>In the room, Old Madam Lu sat sullenly, surrounded by Lu Shiming and his wife.</p>
<p>“When your eldest brother left, he still remembered you. He couldn’t get your forgiveness and refused to close his eyes until he was finally told that you had never blamed him. I showed him all the ginseng medicine you sent him before he breathed his last…” Old Madam Lu’s voice seemed shaky.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming bowed his head. He didn’t know about this. When he heard about the death of his eldest brother, he tried to come back as soon as possible, but he still didn’t have time to see him alive. “Mother, I didn’t complain about Eldest Brother.”</p>
<p>“I know that your relationship with your eldest brother has always been the best. The thing about your imperial examination was that your eldest brother was sorry for you, and you didn’t want him to be sad to see you when you moved away from home.” Old Madam Lu sighed softly. “Your sister-in-law is just too sad. Don’t take her words to heart.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming whispered, “Mother, I don’t blame my sister-in-law. I know she didn’t mean it.”</p>
<p>“You and your wife have been away from the capital for too long. I hope the family will be neat and will not be separated again,” Old Madam Lu said this when looking at Pei Shi.</p>
<p>Pei Shi smiled and said, “Mother, even if you drive us away, we will not go.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was relieved. “If you leave, it will be even sadder to prolong it,” she said, pertaining to the fact that she had become fond of their daughter Lu Yaoyao these past months.</p>
<p>“Mother, we know,” Pei Shi said softly.</p>
<p>“Since your eldest brother’s death, Liu Shi has kept to herself in the house. Fortunately, she realized that she had children, so she chose to stay alive and not follow my eldest son.”</p>
<p>“Even if your eldest sister-in-law will say something unpleasant later, please endure it, just for the sake of this old woman.” The old madam sighed. “I’ve lived to this age, and now I just want to see the whole family on good terms. When I die, you can have my wealth divided according to your wants. I won’t need it anyway.”</p>
<p>“Mother…!” Lu Shiming knelt before Old Madam Lu. “I am not filial! I shouldn’t have left for so many years but stayed back to help.”</p>
<p>His mother was quick to lift him to his feet. “Get up! You have already helped a lot by sacrificing your fame for your family.”</p>
<p>“Mother, he also did it for my sake…” Pei Shi hurried to shoulder the responsibility.</p>
<p>“Well, this is all a thing in the past.” Old Madam Lu interrupted Pei’s words. “Let’s go, it’s getting late for dinner, those children must be scared.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi knew that her daughter had no idea of the past feud between the eldest household and their household. She had deliberately hidden this from Lu Yaoyao, sparing her of worries.</p>
<p>In the dining hall, several daughters and sons of the Lu Family sat side by side, but no one ate. They were all waiting for Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>“Zan, go and see if your eldest brother and second brother have come back.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi and Lu Tingzhi sent Eldest Madam Lu back to her chambers. Liu Shi was unwilling and took her two sons by the hand and cried. “I just can’t swallow this treatment. Your father did not even have a life for the Lu Family. Why should they enjoy the benefits and extend themselves to the court? You are my sons. Don’t you still understand what Mother’s heart is grieving for?”</p>
<p>“Mother, we all know, but he’s still our third uncle,” Lu Tingzhi said.</p>
<p>He had followed his father from an early age and was also privy to what happened in those days. He didn’t believe his father did anything wrong, but he also felt that his uncle, although having the right to feel wronged, had already forgiven his father.</p>
<p>She cried and scolded. “Are you going to help outsiders shame me now?”</p>
<p>“Tingzhi, you should go to Grandmother first, don’t let her wait for too long.” Lu Lingzhi sat down in the plush chair and sent out his brother.</p>
<p>Only then were the mother and her firstborn finally left alone in the silent room.</p>
<p>“Mother, what do you think Third Uncle owes us?” Lu Lingzhi looked at his mother and asked in a low voice.</p>
