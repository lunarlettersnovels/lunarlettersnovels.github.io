            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 182 – The Little Prince’s Wish (2)</strong></p>
<p>However, the same could not be said about the other side.</p>
<p>Right now, in the Imperial Palace, the atmosphere was growing tense by the moment. Everybody was on tenterhook.</p>
<p>The little prince’s condition had suddenly relapsed. Although the empress dowager had summoned Qi Jin for treatment and even heeded Ye Zhen’s diagnosis, during this time, Mo Rongyi’s illness had neither relieved nor palliated.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was diagnosed with Abdominal Tumor. This condition typically comprises obstruction of the intestine characterized by acute abdominal inflammation and pain. Although it should be a localized pain and in that restricted to the Fu<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1">[mfn]Fu- refers to organs (e.g intestines) whose primary function is to transmit and digest nutrients without storing them and to excrete waste. [/mfn]</sup> organs, due to the vague location, the effect is global. The cause can range from organ injury, malnourishment to even emotional imbalance etc. Consequently, the <i>Qi<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="2">[mfn] Qi- the circulating life force whose existence and properties are the basis of much Chinese philosophy and medicine.[/mfn]</sup></i> is clogged and blood coalesces, damaging the liver and spleen while throwing the entire visceral organ system into a disarray. That said, it is the absence of a robust <i>qi</i>, that is the root cause of this disease.</p>
<p>Once the cause is determined, the illness can be remedied without much difficulty. Thus, Qi Jin had prescribed the little prince the right medicines which were administered diligently.</p>
<p>Yet, he showed no sign of improvement.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, now only acupuncture and medication can be used.”</p>
<p>Qi Jin had gone through the medical records of the same disease and observed the little prince for two more days before finally determining the treatment method. One could say, she had employed the necessary recourse to no avail.</p>
<p>The empress dowager was well aware of her son’s condition. No matter how rational or prudent one may be, commoner or royalty, in the end, a mother was still a mother. How could she not be affected?</p>
<p>Now, this sullen mother was sitting by her child’s bed. Her face had lost all its pallor, eyes radiance; her heart ached looking at the pale little face lying before her. Helpless and scared as she was, nonetheless, decided to address the knot in her heart.</p>
<p>“Can you cure the little prince this time?”</p>
<p>Qi Jin was no ordinary physician. She was very much deserving of the fame and position she currently held, for she possesed immense experience and a wealth of knowledge. Even so, today, this talented physician, who was otherwise quick on her feet, was unsure of how to answer. After all, the heart was willing, but the experience pointed to otherwise.</p>
<p>She glanced at Mo Rongyi, at his innocent face that was wreathed with excruciating pain; her heart sank. With hesitance, she said, “Your Highness, at this point… I fear I am unable to assure you.”</p>
<p>As if on cue, Mo Rongyi opened his weary eyes. Despite his age, he was intelligent, and in those short few sentences had surmised what was to happen next.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, I do not want acupuncture or medicine …” His puckered lips trembled. Upon hearing the dreadful method, tears rolled from his eyes.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager’s eyes are full of tenderness and doting as she tended to her younger son. “How can you feel better without taking medicine? A’Yi, when your illness is cured, would you wish for Aijia<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="3">[mfn]āi jiā: I, me (self-referring by a widowed empress etc, used in historical novels and operas[/mfn]</sup> to let you play outside?”</p>
<p>Of course, it was a good thing to be able to go out of the imperial palace to play, but Mo Rongyi felt that he would not have the chance to do so again. He could feel his body slowly losing life…</p>
<p>His condition was such that even the simplest things were arduous. Let alone moving around, even talking was a herculean task. Whenever he tried to speak, an immense pain would shoot from his chest and abdomen. It was impossible to endure. So much so, that he preferred death over such torment!</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, I want to see Lu Yaoyao.” Mo Rongyi abruptly said aloud.</p>
<p>Although the empress dowager and Qi Jin were taken aback for a moment, they quickly recovered and looked askance at the little prince’s unexpected request.</p>
<p>“Why do you wish to see her?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s face turned pale. Ever since he was little, he had but a few friends. The number was such that one’s fingers were sufficient to count. To him, Lu Yaoyao was special. Not only was she remarkable, she had even saved him. At the thought of him dying any time from now, he felt it would be nice to establish a bond with her and add her to his short list of friends.</p>
<p>“She made a bet that she can cure my illness. I wish to tell her in person, she lost.” Mo Rongyi remarked in jest and revealed a wan smile.</p>
<p>The empress dowager felt even more heavyhearted and coaxed softly.</p>
<p>“She is a little girl who only wagered such nonsense!”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, I just want to see her…” Mo Rongyi insisted. “She is my friend. And the state I am in, should she not come see me?”</p>
<p>“Well, well, Aijia will ask her to come and see you in the Imperial Palace. But first, you must take your medicine obediently!” The empress dowager hurriedly said, lest her child change his mind!</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi smiled cheekily and nodded. “Alright.”</p>
<p>Thus, this royal mother-son pair, with perfect slyness, was able to gain their end goal. The mother got her son’s cooperation for the treatment, the son his wish of meeting his friend.</p>
<p>The empress dowager looked back at Qi Jin and said, “Jin, you can go ahead with the acupuncture first.”</p>
<p>Qi Jin lowered her head slightly. “Very well, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Send someone to invite Miss Lu to the Imperial Palace.” The empress dowager instructed Aunt Cheng next to her.</p>
<p>Acquiescing in a low voice, Aunt Cheng turned to leave.</p>
<p>Just then Qi Jin abruptly interjected.</p>
<p>“You will not find Miss Lu at the Lu Mansion. Aunt Cheng needs to look for her in the School of Medicine.”</p>
<p>Her words took the empress dowager by surprise.</p>
<p>“Is she now your student?”</p>
