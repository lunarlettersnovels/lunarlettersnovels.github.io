            <p><strong>Chapter 546 – Drooling</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen hadn’t slept this soundly for many days now. She was obviously in a strange place and full of fear before, but tonight she slept until dawn. When she woke up, she was still in a trance, thinking she was in her own room.</p>
<p>“Awake?” Mo Rongzhan’s hoarse voice came from above her head, and then his warm lips fell on her cheek. “The storm has stopped, and soon, Shen Yi and the others will come to pick us up.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Ye Zhen responded lightly; feeling that half of his body was on top of her, she reached out to push him away. She put her palms on his smooth and firm shoulders and was stunned for a moment, only to realize that he was wearing only a pair of obscene pants. She turned her head hastily and cried out, “You go out.”</p>
<p>Amused, Mo Rongzhan turned her around in his arms and said, “Yaoyao, you can’t burn the bridge after crossing the river. Last night you held me and didn’t let me go, but now you are awake and don’t want me anymore, you are too heartless.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s cheeks flushed slightly, and she shouted in a huff, “I didn’t hold and cling onto you.”</p>
<p>“You really think so? All I wanted to do was cover you, but you grabbed my hand and didn’t want to let go. As such, I could only lie down with you. Look here, there are still traces of your saliva on my clothes,” Mo Rongzhan said with a smile pointing to his chest.</p>
<p>He and Jiang Ashi had been to the cellars to check on those weapons last night, and when he came back, he found Ye Zhen sleeping quite restlessly. Originally, he just wanted to coax her for a while, but who knew that she would hold onto him and refuse to let go. God knows the kind of torment he endured last night.</p>
<p>“I… I don’t drool.” Ye Zhen glanced at his chest from the corner of her eyes, her cheeks were turning redder and redder.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan chuckled, “Even if you drool on me, I won’t blame you.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bit her lip and glared at him, “Get up quickly, perhaps someone is here for us.”</p>
<p>“Even if someone came looking for us, would they dare to disturb us without our permission?” Mo Rongzhan said in a low voice, gazing at her pink lips.</p>
<p>“You…you should allow me to get up.” Ye Zhen couldn’t get up as he was leaning on her. She didn’t want to continue entangling with him here. This man could do anything, so she’d better stay away from him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan just wanted to tease her. They got off on the wrong foot after they met last night. He could feel that the little girl’s mind seemed to be heavier. She hid too many things and refused to speak. The fury in his heart was soaring, but he was reluctant to be angry with her when he faced her. Now, all he could do was make her happy first, then return to the capital and take her into the palace.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t let her have another chance to leave!</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll allow you to get up.” Mo Rongzhan laughed hoarsely and sat up with her hand. His gaze suddenly fell onto where her neckline was open… Her white as jade collarbone and the hickey he couldn’t help leaving last night. His eyes darkened as he said, “I’ll tidy it up for you.”</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen stretched out her hand, she found that her clothes were undone. She reckoned they must have accidentally spread out when she was sleeping last night. She lowered her head to organize them, only to find that her chest seemed to have some red marks. They looked very familiar, just like when he snuck into her boudoir at nights before…the kiss… She instantly raised her head in a huff and demanded, “Mo Rongzhan, you…what did you do last night?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan stared straight at her apparently full chest, then wrapped his arms around her and said in a hoarse voice, “What else could I do?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Ye Zhen hit his shoulder as she struggled to wrest free.</p>
<p>“Be a good girl and don’t move around so much, Yaoyao,” Mo Rongzhan said in a hoarse voice. “I’ve endured for far too long. You’ve been away from the capital for so long; I have missed you so, so much that it hurts…”</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>When Shen Yi came to Black Wind Island with some people, Mo Rongzhan went out to meet them in high spirits. However, Ye Zhen fell asleep in a daze. When she woke up again, she was already inside the cabin of the warship.</p>
<p>She took a moment to take in her surroundings, then pushed open the door of the cabin and walked out. At a glance, she saw Mo Rongzhan standing on the board, his back to her, looking ahead with his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>“Are we going back to Zhao Jia Island?” Ye Zhen asked, looking at his back.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan turned, waved with a smile, and said, “Come here.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen grimaced. By now, she had developed a healthy sense of fear toward Mo Rongzhan. Every time she thought the man couldn’t surprise her anymore, he would find a way to surpass her expectations all over again. Although he had kept his promise and never crossed that last line,  she felt as if his advances and the subsequent feelings he stirred in her were akin to losing her innocence*.</p>
<p>[*<em>They have done everything except he hasn’t entered her, he always stops when they reach that part.</em>]</p>
<p>“Can’t you walk? I want to hug you,” Mo Rongzhan said with a smile. Then, he came over and wanted to hug her.</p>
<p>“I can walk by myself.” Ye Zhen almost jumped and looked at him vigilantly, keeping a distance of five steps.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan smiled and pointed to a casserole next to him, “I made some porridge, it’s very fresh, you can eat some first.”</p>
<p>“Are we going back to Zhao Jia Island?” As the aroma of the fresh and sweet fish porridge assailed her senses, Ye Zhen touched her stomach and realized she was really hungry.</p>
<p>“Going back to the capital,” Mo Rongzhan said lightly. To him, Zhaojia Island had nothing worth staying for, and his most important treasure was already by his side, so naturally, he would go back to the capital directly. As for the other things, he left it to Shen Yi and the others to take care of.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her head in surprise and said, “Aren’t we going to find my master?”</p>
<p>“Your master still has things to do, he won’t leave Zhao Jia Island anytime soon,” Mo Rongzhan said lightly, taking away the fish bones and feeding her a mouthful of fish porridge. “I have also left behind people on Black Wind island.”</p>
<p>“What else does my master have to do? I’m going to Zhao Jia Island!” Ye Zhen cried out.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, Mo Rongzhan was a little jealous of Huangfu Chen. This little girl cared about everyone under the sun but him. When it came to him, she was indifferent and refused to respond to his feelings whatsoever.</p>
<p>“Something happened to Mu Qing,” he said, “Huangfu Chen is taking care of her, what are you going to do there? Add to the mess?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was shocked, she had never imagined this to happen. “What happened to Mu Qing?” she asked.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan sighed and said, “Zhao Mingxiao imprisoned her on Spirit Snake Island, and she was injured.” He narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at her, “Why do you want to go back to Zhao Jia Island? Is there anything else you can’t let go of?”</p>
<p>“Have you killed that bastard Zhao Mingxiao?” Ye Zhen said angrily.<em> It is because of that wretched man that Master and Mu Qing could not be together… He did not even cherish Mu Qing… such a person should be cut with a thousand swords!</em></p>
<p>“Huangfu Chen will not let him off,” Mo Rongzhan said lightly.</p>
<p>“Then… what about Ye Shi?” Ye Zhen thought of Ye Chunming and wondered what happened to him.</p>
<p>“Who is that?” Mo Rongzhan’s eyes flashed with a dangerous glint. <em>It looks like a few people have caught her attention during this trip</em></p>
<p><em>It appears that Ye Shi was not caught. How could someone as smart as Ye Chunming be easily caught by Mo Rongzhan</em>?</p>
<p>“Zhao Mingxiao’s military advisor, I was almost caught by him.”</p>
<p>“I remember Ye Yisong’s style name was Ye Shi,” Mo Rongzhan remarked in a low voice.</p>
<p>“What?” Ye Zhen was startled.</p>
<p><em>Could Mo Rongzhan already question Ye Shi’s identity?</em></p>
