            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 156  – How Could It Be Him?</strong></p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, the dark shadow braced Ye Zhen mid-way through her fall; strong arms held her back by her waist and without any difficulty whirled her around to safety.</p>
<p>Initially, she was sure that she was going to fall into the pond. Whether she would drown or not was the second thing that came to her mind. With Mo Rongyi around, his people would surely save her and pull her out of the water, but she could not bear losing face here.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8"></div>
<p>Once she fell into the water, her maiden name would be tainted, and the humiliation would hinder her from entering the palace to become an imperial physician.</p>
<p>For this, for the first time, she felt intense anger towards Princess Royal and her daughter, Liu Hua.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to provoke them nor stir up any trouble with them. Yet, they refused to let her go in peace since the moment they laid their eyes on her!</p>
<p>What’s more, she saw it all—the meaningful wink of Princess Royal to her maids-in-waiting. Just vicious and cruel!</p>
<p>From the moment she felt the maid shove her, she didn’t expect anyone to save her—her and her reputation.</p>
<p>In that brief moment, she thought several times about what to do if she indeed fell into the water so as not to damage her maiden name. Fortunately, strong hands held her firmly.</p>
<p>“Thank you…” She felt her feet touch the ground and her frame steadied. With a happy heart, she looked up to thank the person who saved her.</p>
<p>Sharp eyes hovered over her, knife-shaped eyebrows lifted and thin lips slightly pressed. The man donned black, embroidered golden dragon robes; the neckline, and cuffs adorned with a dark golden auspicious pattern, making him look more powerful if possible.</p>
<p>However, the coldness in his eyes and inherent domineering aura hindered anyone to dare to make a sound.</p>
<p><i>How could it be him?</i></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s hands were still on her waist as he looked down at her with a seemingly confused face.</p>
<p>In shock, Ye Zhen pushed him away without thinking and stepped back a few steps. The resistance and disgust in her eyes too noticeable.</p>
<p>“Brother!” Mo Rongyi looked delighted, but his voice sounded timid. He had always been afraid of his elder brother. At this moment, even he was too scared to speak.</p>
<p>Princess Royal was clearly disappointed by the sudden appearance of the emperor, but she still forced herself to bow before him. “Your Majesty…”</p>
<p>Her daughter also paid her respects, only it was quite different. Liu Hua looked at Mo Rongzhan with a coquettish and happy face and stepped closer to him.</p>
<p>“Cousin Emperor, why are you here?” she asked, fluttering her lashes towards him.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Mo Rongzhan’s cold eyes fell lightly on Ye Zhen. Seeing that she hung her head down, he spoke in a heavy voice. “Raise your head.”</p>
<p><i>Is he talking to me?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen was shocked. Her hand, clenched in a fist, remained hidden in her sleeves. Slowly, she raised her head and quickly, bowed down on her knees.</p>
<p>“This miss thanks His Majesty for saving her life.”</p>
<p>When he had met her in the Chengde Mountain Villa, the little girl looked a little different. Mo Rongzhan scrutinized her for a moment, then turned his head and glanced at the others. “What happened?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this miss bumped into me and refused to admit her mistake with strong arguments.” Liu Hua stared at Ye Zhen’s beautiful face, envious in her heart. For fear that she would attract the emperor, she immediately went to his side and cried out with injustice.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi instantaneously came to Ye Zhen’s defense. “You fell yourself! Where exactly did Yaoyao hit you?”</p>
<p>By then, a venomous voice contradicted the little prince. Princess Royal spoke, the hatred in her eyes evident.</p>
<p>“My sweet little prince, did you see Liu Hua fall on her own? We all know that you are inclined to help your friend Lu Yaoyao. Do not tell lies.”</p>
<p>“You…”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s face turned red with anger. Princess Royal was his aunt. However, she despised them. He still remembered the first time he and his mother, the empress dowager, saw her. At that time, his mother wanted to greet Princess Royal, yet, she ignored them in front of many people, saying that his mother was too low in status to speak to her.</p>
<p><b><i>“You should not be even standing before me! How dare you!”</i></b></p>
<p>Mo Rongyi remembered that scene very clearly like it had happened just yesterday. That year, his brother had just left the capital on an expedition, and his father no longer doted on his mother, who was without a title. They did not have a good time in the palace. Although he was very young, he remembered clearly the look on Princess Royal’s face at that time.</p>
<p>Now, his brother was already the most honorable person in Jin country. <i>Why did Princess Royal still dare to show an arrogant attitude in front of them?</i></p>
<p>He grit his teeth, stared at Princess Royal and said, “What if this prince wants to help Lu Yaoyao? She is my friend. If I do not help her, should I help you instead?”</p>
<p>“You are impudent!” Princess Royal shouted louder than she’d expected to. “How dare you talk to me like this!”</p>
<p>“Then tell me, Aunt, how should I talk to you? Or, do you think that this prince is not even qualified to stand before you?” Mo Rongyi’s young face was full of resentment.</p>
