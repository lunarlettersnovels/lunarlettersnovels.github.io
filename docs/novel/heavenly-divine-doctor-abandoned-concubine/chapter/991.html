            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 338 – Forging Ties</strong></p>
<p>“We don’t know, but your father always knows.” Old Madam Lu had already made up her mind, she quickly sent the maid outside the door to invite Lu Shiming over.</p>
<p>When Lu Shiming came over and heard of his mother’s plan of going to see Lu Lingzhi, he looked up at his daughter. Ye Zhen returned him an expression full of helplessness.</p>
<p>“Mother, why don’t I first find out where Lingzhi is healing now, and when I determine the location, I will take you to find him.” Lu Shiming could only delay as much as possible, hoping his nephew could return soon.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu frowned and said, “It’s not hard to find out where he is healing. You can ask today. I will set off tomorrow. If you can’t find out, I’ll look for the location along the way.”</p>
<p>“Mother, how could you stand the journey yourself? If you are not at ease, how about you send me, I can go there in person?” Lu Shiming said hurriedly.</p>
<p>“I want to go personally!” Old Madam Lu stubbornly held to her decision.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said hurriedly, “Grandmother, how about I accompany Father, then write to you truthfully? Okay?”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu looked at Ye Zhen hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, if I go with Father, I can ride a horse on my own, and will be much faster.” Ye Zhen persuaded.</p>
<p>It was only then that the matriarch finally relented. “Okay, but you will set off immediately.”</p>
<p>“Mother, I’ll go to my superiors and seek permission first, and then find out where to stay. It’s still early now, we will leave after lunch,” Lu Shiming said.</p>
<p>“Go on.” Madam Lu hurriedly urged him to take leave.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming glanced at Ye Zhen helplessly, and said to the Old Madam, “Mother, I will go now.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen also said, “Grandmother, then I will prepare too.”</p>
<p>When the two left the room, Lu Shiming couldn’t help asking, “Yaoyao, what did you tell her?”</p>
<p>“Father, how can Grandmother be so easily coaxed? She knew that Qi Jin was going to treat Eldest Brother personally, and already guessed that his injury was serious,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming had also been worried about Lu Lingzhi’s injury. Even if his mother didn’t say anything, he had planned to take leave to visit him tomorrow. “I’ll go by myself. You stay here.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said, “If I don’t go, Grandmother will definitely be worried. It’s okay. I can ride a horse by myself.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming had no choice but to agree. He hurriedly went to his boss to take a leave of absence.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>On the other side, the Liu family went to visit Liu Shi and happened to mention Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Eldest Madam, we met Princess Furong at Old Madam’s just now. She is really a beautiful girl. Is she married?” Hu Shi asked excitedly.</p>
<p>Liu Shi’s face was sallow, she was still worried about her son’s injury. Upon those words, she shot the other a cold look. “Are you here to care about Lingzhi or see that Princess Furong?”</p>
<p>Hu Shi smiled. “Of course we are concerned about Lingzhi, but after listening to Princess Furong, she said that he only had a minor injury and that Imperial Physician Qi was going to treat him. I think it is not a problem.”</p>
<p>Liu frowned. “She really said that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I heard that she just came out of the palace. Could it be fake? Oh, our Lingzhi has such a fortunate life, how can something happen? Eldest Madam, don’t worry,” Hu Shi said with a smile.</p>
<p>Others also persuaded. “Eldest Madam, you must take care of yourself. This Marquis Mansion cannot function without you. Are you going to let the second branch take advantage of this time?”</p>
<p>Liu Shi immediately sat up straight. “I won’t even let them think about it!”</p>
<p>Hu Shi said with joy, “Eldest Madam, you are in charge of this Marquis Mansion now. Your eldest nephew hasn’t married yet, is it possible… What about Princess Furong?”</p>
<p>“Has Eldest Nephew made a name for himself yet? If it were before, there would still be a possibility. That Yaoyao, except for being a little more attractive, is no different from a wild girl who grew up in the country. She has only been able to please the empress dowager and was just titled Princess. She hasn’t even been allocated Princess Mansion.” Liu snorted disdainfully, feeling that Lu Yaoyao was not worthy of her nephew.</p>
<p>Hu Shi was overjoyed. She didn’t care whether Lu Yaoyao grew up in the country or not. Just her being a princess was enough to make her happy. “Eldest Madam, then you have to put in some good words for your nephew. If we can make ties with the princess, then our Liu Family will have a bright future.”</p>
<p>Liu Shi didn’t want to let her maiden family know that she didn’t have power over anything in the Lu Family, so she simply nodded. “I’ll try my best.”</p>
<p>Hu Shi took this as her agreeing and felt her son would definitely be able to marry Lu Yaoyao.</p>
