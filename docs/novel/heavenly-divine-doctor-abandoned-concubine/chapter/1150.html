            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 177- Definitely Not</strong></p>
<p>With her head lowered, Ye Zhen mulled the challenge that Master Qin had tossed at them. Though it had all the elements of a conundrum on the surface, a logical analysis proved it otherwise.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8"></div>
<p>The three herbs were commonly used drugs. Bai Song can regulate body temperature, promote diuresis, lower down blood pressure, and arrest bleeding. However, the effects vary depending on the method used.</p>
<p>Sedum (Jiang Tian)  is known to cure inflammation, pyrexia, erysipelas, and pediatric fever. Sedum flowers also help with women-only diseases and improve eyesight.</p>
<p>Hibiscus mutabilis (Mu Rong) is instrumental in alleviating lung-heat, cooling blood, dissipation of heat, purging toxic materials, and treating carbuncles, ulcers, swelling, toxic and malignant inflammations of all sizes.</p>
<p>In the world of medical books, this trinity of herbs commanded a prefatory position. Seldom was there a book that did not comprise these herbs as its opening page. Thus, seen in a prudent light, this ad hoc test did not intend to throw them into hot waters, but rather gauge their ability to swim. Simply put, this was the master’s definitive method to adjudge his pupils’ meticulousness.</p>
<p>Despite the pin drop silence in this examination hall, the unbidden sighs resonating from around Ye Zhen, were a testimony to the fact that not many were in the company of the introductory book yesterday.</p>
<p>Unfolding the white sheet of paper upon her desk, beginning with the illustration of the three herbs, Ye Zhen enumerated their characteristics and applications. This was a problem, but not to her.</p>
<p>Besides some basic knowledge of medicine from Lu Yaoyao, Ye Zhen was blessed with an eidetic memory. Although she did not practice medicine, she could very well be a genius.</p>
<p>Not everybody possessed an ability such as hers.</p>
<p>From the podium, leaning on his chair, Qin Fuzi ran a practiced eye around the assembly below. As a veteran, it was his prerogative to hand-pick prospective talent. He had assessed the students in Class A yesterday, there were but a few promising imperial physicians. Today, it was Class B’s turn. Although he did not hold much expectation, he still wanted to take a chance.</p>
<p>These days, fewer and fewer students qualified to become imperial physicians at the imperial palace. It was widely believed that the palace was going to select a few imperial physicians this year.</p>
<p>So far, among all the women physicians in the imperial palace, Qi Jin was the highest-ranked. She was especially responsible for tending to the empress dowager. She was also tasked with diagnosing and treating diseases for the women in the Inner Palace. However, aside from the few physicians in the palace, many female physicians were subpar, thus creating a huge void.</p>
<p>It was this very void that this taskmaster was seeking to fill.</p>
<p>Looking around, Qin Fuzi was met with many blank faces and sheets. It needed no telling, they were incapable of answering. He was slightly disappointed. Just when he thought he too would have to draw a blank, something caught his sight.</p>
<p>Right in the center, with a head buried deep, oblivious to the surroundings, was a girl immersed in writing. In his bid to reaffirm what he had seen, he squinted slightly and took a careful look.</p>
<p>By now, Ye Zhen had finished sketching all the three herbs. In order to not draw suspicion, she had deliberately made them look unappealing. However, one could still tell what type of herbs they were.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was oblivious to Qin Fuzi’s watchful gaze upon her. To her, the more she pondered over the uses of the three herbs, the faster the pen in her hand moved.</p>
<p>It seemed that… she also had an interest and aptitude in medicine. She had always felt that it was indeed amazing to be able to cure people with herbs and such.</p>
<p>With his hands clasped behind his back, Qin Fuzi stood up and took deliberate steps towards the aisle in the middle, glancing at the papers all along. Some students could only define the herbs, while others had only managed to draw a few leaves. Only the student who was fully immersed in a world of her own had not only furnished a complete illustration, but also an in-depth description of characteristics and effects.</p>
<p>Actually… it was not bad at all!</p>
<p><i>Did this student work hard yesterday?</i></p>
<p>No. Despite the hard work, one would not be able to elaborate on the three herbs to such an extent, at the same time. And, in only one night. If this student was not proficient in herbs already, she was a genius.</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi was a little excited. The academy had not had such a fascinating student in a long time! While he was still caught up in his musings, abruptly, a voice brought it to a full stop</p>
<p>“Master, I have finished.” Ye Zhen handed in her roll. She was the first to do so.</p>
<p>The others in the class looked on silently. Some envied, while some were not convinced. A myriad of thoughts engulfed their minds, but the commonality was: <i> How could a person be beautiful and intelligent at the same time?</i> <i>This was not normal at all.</i></p>
<p>No matter what others thought, Ye Zhen had always wanted to be humble and low-key. She had tried to keep herself out of the limelight on every occasion. However, now she thought otherwise. Ye Zhen had come to a conclusion, that it was now time to display her prowess. It was time to step out of obscurity, lest she be unable to reach her goal.</p>
<p>As he perused Ye Zhen’s answers, Qin Fuzi looked a little lost in thought. <i>Her answer was also … too complete!</i> It’s even more detailed than the introductory books–those could not even compare to the answers she had supplied.</p>
<p>“Have you studied medicine before?” Qin Fuzi looked at Ye Zhen and asked.</p>
<p>“My mother is a physician. I learned from her.” Ye Zhen replied truthfully.</p>
<p><i>So, it was a long tradition of family learning!</i> <i>No wonder she could answer so well.</i> <i>However, although this was the case, this student was already sufficiently excellent.</i></p>
<p>One after the other, the rest of the class also handed in their papers. Other than Chen Jinru’s sketches of the three herbs and description, most of them could only manage to draw the herbs, some even handed in blanks.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang glared at Ye Zhen with eyes full of hate, neither was she able to conceal the jealousy within.</p>
<p>Once he had received all the examination papers, Qin Fuzi did not immediately review them but explained the theory of herbs. He was responsible for the identification and elucidation of herbs. As for the other aspects, other teachers would be handling them.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was well aware that to be an imperial physician, she would have to not only rely on the phoenix tattoo on her palm but also have truly convincing medical skills. And today’s challenge was only just the beginning.</p>
<p>It had been a pretty hard morning. After class, Qin Fuzi left with a pile of papers.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, do you know what those three herbs look like?” Just after class, Sun Wen immediately came to Ye Zhen and asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “I do. There are records in the book.”</p>
<p>Sun Wen cried out. “You are amazing. I read the book yesterday, but I just cannot remember anything.”</p>
<p>Chen Jinru, sitting at the back, said with a smile, “If you want to remember these herbs, you had better go to the medicine field several times for a look and memorize them.”</p>
<p>“Ah Ru, do you know too?” Sun Wen placed her palm on her forehead, utterly dejected. “I don’t understand anything.”</p>
<p>“You are not the only one who fails to comprehend.” Chen Jinru comforted her.</p>
<p>When Huang Fuxiang overheard their conversation, she assumed that they were talking about her.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang turned her white eyes and came over. “It is not important to know a few herbs now. What <i>is</i> important is to be a physician in the palace in the future.”</p>
<p>“If you do not know what the herbs look like, can you still be one?” Sun Wen sneered at the twisted logic.</p>
<p>Twisted or not, one thing could be said about Huang Fuxiang. She was someone who practiced what she preached, after all, she had handed in a blank paper.</p>
<p>“Just wait and watch!” Huang Fuxiang snorted, never the one to back down. Then, turning around, she walked out in a huff.</p>
<p>Two of her underlings immediately ran after her. “Ah Xiang, do not pay those people any mind. They do not know that Physician Huang is your aunt, they will certainly be embarrassed in the future.”</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang coldly uttered. “In the afternoon is the etiquette lesson. That Lu Yaoyao is a woodlouse from the countryside, does not even know how to curtsy! She wants to show off suddenly? Then I will give her what she wants!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I don’t believe that she, a girl from the border town, knows everything! Today, I want to let her know the difference between her kind and a real nobility.” Someone seconded.</p>
<p>“Then it is decided!” Huang Fuxiang smiled smugly as if she had seen Ye Zhen make a fool of herself already. The more she thought about it, the prouder she felt.</p>
<p><i>If Tang Zhen were to know that Lu Yaoyao was lacking, would he still like her? </i></p>
<p><i>Definitely… not!</i></p>
