<p>“Oh? Third Sister doesn’t know? All the madams and misses who attend the poetry meeting on weekdays are willing to make a bet on whether or not you can get into the School of Medicine!” Lu Fang dramatically whispered to Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Tongue-tied, Ye Zhen took seconds to find the right words to say.</p>
<p>“Oh? And how is it going?” She was indeed interested and shocked.</p>
<p>“People who win will have ten times the money they spent over their choice of bet. But so far, the majority of the ladies have bet against your success,” Lu Jing said gloatingly, a smug look on her face.</p>
<p>Lu Yaoyao had won everyone’s favor at home, but she still hadn’t won over those in the capital!</p>
<p>Ye Zhen showed a hurt expression. “I see. I must go now, it is almost noon. I’ll see you when I return.”</p>
<p>Leaving the garden, the smile on Ye Zhen”s face brightened leaving the Dai Mei beside her thoroughly confused. Clearly, it wasn’t the reaction she was expecting.</p>
<p><i>Is Third Miss excited about being shamed and belittled?</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Lu Shiming and Lu Xiangzhi rode in front while Pei Shi and Teacher Shan traveled in one carriage, they seemed to have something important to talk about. Without any better option, Ye Zhen agreed to ride alone in a carriage behind them.</p>
<p>Pei Shi originally wanted to be with her daughter, but Teacher Shan said she had something to ask her, therefore, she patiently sat with her in her carriage.</p>
<p>“Tell me, do you have anything to say,? Is it about Yaoyao?” Pei Shi asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan looked at Pei Shi’s features carefully, frowning slightly and asked, “Please don’t blame me for speaking straight. I don’t spit out a thing if I don’t find it necessary.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi’s heart slightly tightened, but her face smiled as usual. “What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, is she truly your daughter?” Teacher Shan asked directly.</p>
<p>No one could blame her for doubting this possibility, it was because every day, Lu Yaoyao looked more and more like Ye Zhen!</p>
<p>After getting along with her these past few days, she sometimes thought that it was Ye Zhen who was standing before her and not Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Why do you ask? Yaoyao is my daughter. I gave birth to her in the border town.”</p>
<p><i>Sure enough, she didn’t!</i></p>
<p>This was indeed the moment Pei Shi dreaded so much about! <i>Why, of all the people, did Teacher Shan ask her this question? Did she know any of Lu Yaoyao’s relatives?</i></p>
<p>Breaking out in a sweat, Pei Shi wished that the carriage windows were not closed.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s a coincidence that Yaoyao looks too much like… like the daughter of an old friend of mine.”</p>
<p>“Are there any missing daughters in their family?” Pei Shi’s queried.</p>
<p>She felt even worse now for Lu Yaoyao’s family. But she couldn’t entertain the thought of her daughter leaving her.</p>
<p>“Not that I heard of.” Teacher Shan shook her head. <i>Perhaps she was overthinking?</i></p>
<p>Shrugging her shoulders, Pei Shi was relieved. “Some people can be quite similar, you know.”</p>
<p>Giving out an audible sigh, Teacher Shan nodded condescendingly. “You are right, though they look so much alike, Yaoyao is just as intelligent as the daughter of my old friend. Perhaps, she will have better prospects in the future.”</p>
<p>When Pei Shi saw that Teacher Shan had dispelled her doubts, her smile deepened. “That’s because we have you, such a good teacher, to teach our Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>“If you hadn’t left then, you would have been a physician,” Teacher Shan looked at her and said.</p>
<p>“The past shall not be mentioned.” Pei Shi shook her head and chuckled.</p>
<p>She had followed Lu Shiming without hesitation. She was also reluctant to let him suffer injustice in the capital. They had been in the border town for so many years.</p>
<p>In fact, life back there was very satisfying. Even if coming back meant living again in their simple ways, she would be more than willing.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own ways, and their decisions bud from this. Teacher Shan understood Pei Shi’s choice. She herself had also chosen to leave the Academy for Women and would rather wander around.</p>
<p>Remembering the life she left years ago, Pei Shi couldn’t help but laugh at the irony. Never had she thought she would give up on her dreams in favor of the man she loved.</p>
<p>Looking at her children’s faces, she never regretted this life she chose.</p>
<p>“I only hope Yaoyao can inherit my mantle and study medicine in the School of Medicine. If she wants to be an imperial physician, she has my full support.”</p>
<p>Teacher Shan turned to look outside. She hoped Lu Yaoyao would not just become an imperial physician.</p>
<p>To her, she could become so much more…</p>
