            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 121 – Beneath The Emperor’s Gaze (2)</h3>
<p>Not far, watching from a distance, were the Lu Sisters- Jing and Fang. Seeing as how things stood, the siblings exchanged a meaningful glance. It was no secret that they were both skeptical about Ye Zhen’s capabilities. More than that, they did not want her drawing people’s attention. But what they also certainly did not want, was for this cousin from the border town to bring shame to the Lu Family by failing the exam.</p>
<p>Looking at the haughty princess yonder, brimming with pride and contempt, they could only hope that Ye Zhen would not bring trouble to their family. Thus, the two chose to play mute spectators and make themselves as scarce as possible.</p>
<p>As soon as the group of people entered the woods, they were greeted by resonant and relaxing sounds of the guqin. It felt as if they were in the mountains, surrounded by serene greenery and soothing rivulets. The melody was peaceful and leisurely, evoking a sense of calm within.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s eyes lit up as he thought it was Ye Zhen who was making the soulful tune. He took nimble steps into the bamboo grove, and in a clearing, found a woman playing the guqin.</p>
<p><i>Alas, it was not her!</i></p>
<p>The woman, dressed in a pale yellow, was the very one who had chastised Sun Wen and implicitly ridiculed her appearance. When she had finished her piece, she bowed to the examiner, who acknowledged with a smile. She also did not forget to snicker and flash Ye Zhen a defiant look, flaunting her skills.</p>
<p>Utterly unfazed by the provocation, Ye Zhen simply awaited her turn. After all, such things never entered her eyes. She was here for a purpose, and her purpose alone was what she cared about.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was now clad in a white dress with narrow sleeves. A delicate line of crimson crescents adorned the hem. It all appeared as simple as simple could be, albeit did not diminish her beauty.</p>
<p>She had to wait for Sun Wen to finish, she was up after.</p>
<p>Sun Wen’s choice of instrument was a flute. Though the tune she played could not be deemed very outstanding, at least she completed the exam. Fortunately, Sun Wen had already secured three A’s after acing the writing examination while Ye Zhen had only managed a C, which was somewhat surprising.</p>
<p>When it was finally Ye Zhen’s time, everybody seemed to be holding their breaths. Just then, suddenly, a figure emerged from the woods. There was not a single eyeball that was not trained on this new arrival.</p>
<p>Oblivious to the gazes about him, Lu Xiangzhi walked over from the other side. His steps were a tad laboured for in his hands was—a big drum.</p>
<p>“Drum?!” Princess Liu Hua, who was standing right behind Mo Rongyi, burst into laughter. “No one has ever chosen a drum as an instrument before!” She was never the one to miss a chance to ridicule.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was provoked. He turned back, wanting to slap her vanity with a rejoinder, but something caught his sight. In the rear, were two familiar figures approaching them.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s leg had yet to recover, his gait was still unsteady as he made his way towards this group. And beside him, there was…</p>
<p><i>Brother? Even my Brother Emperor came?!</i></p>
<p>Just as he was about to open his mouth, Tang Zhen grabbed his hand and hushed him. “Prince, Third Miss Lu is about to start.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen’s eyes had also naturally found Mo Rongzhan. One look at the emperor donning the hunting gear was enough to know he was here to accompany Little Prince on a hunt. Perhaps, he had looked for Mo Rongyi on the hunting ground, unable to find his little brother, he came to the nearby Academy for Women.</p>
<p>The emperor had not made his presence felt, thus, he had arrived quietly. Even so, his sudden appearance startled everybody who saw him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was a little afraid of his big brother Mo Rongzhan, so this nervous royalty did not dare to look towards him again. From the moment he had heard the marquis, his eyes were fixed on Ye Zhen and Ye Zhen alone. He was anticipating her musical performance.</p>
<p>Thankfully, before long, he was drawn by Ye Zhen’s actions. What had started as a tactic to evade his big brother’s eye, was now an unbidden fascination.</p>
<p>By now, Lu Xiangzhi, and the big drum, had reached the spot where the performance was to take place. It took two people to place it on the ground. Once they had placed the drum, Lu Xiangzhi and his helper took their leave.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen then bowed to the examiner, she walked to the big drum and climbed it.</p>
<p>The crowd exchanged their bewilderments.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“What is she planning to do?”</p>
<p>“Teacher, the musical instrument chosen by this student is a drum.” Ye Zhen spoke with a humble smile. Under the stunned gaze of the examiner, she raised her foot and straightened her back…</p>
<p>The gentle sound of the drum gradually became louder. Her every prance bequeathed a momentum so impressive that it could shatter stones.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen flung out her long sleeves, the sonorous drums suddenly thundered with might, as if hordes of troops were marching forward.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the drums and the battlefield had an uncanny kinship, one that could galvanize an army’s morale. Now Ye Zhen’s drums seemed to have stirred a slumbering lion to gradual wakefulness. It was slowly mustering momentum, rousing the spirits of those around; the rhythm resonating deep inside their hearts.</p>
<p>However, what was even more striking was Ye Zhen’s dancing.</p>
<p>So brilliant… so charming.</p>
