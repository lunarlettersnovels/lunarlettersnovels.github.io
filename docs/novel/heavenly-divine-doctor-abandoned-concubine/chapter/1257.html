<p>When Ye Zhen got back inside the walls of Zhuangzi Hot Springs, she was furiously gasping for air- fear, and shock evident on her face.</p>
<p>“Third Miss, have a cup of tea.” Dai Mei poured a cup of tea and noticed her mistress’ pallid expression. She instantly became worried,</p>
<p>“Miss, are you all right?! Did you bathe for too long?”</p>
<p>She never imagined that the miss would be agitated by her absence.</p>
<p>Upon exiting the spring, exhaustion immediately kicked in, thus, Dai Mei fell asleep for a while. She was then woken up by Ye Zhen’s shrill cry.</p>
<p>Only then did her senses return in full swing!</p>
<p>Deep in her thoughts, Ye Zhen was shocked by the clatter of the ceramic cup placed on the nearby table.</p>
<p>“I-I’m fine, but… I’ve been in the water for too long, my legs feel numb.”</p>
<p>“Third Miss, this handmaiden will dry your hair.” Dai Mei offered.</p>
<p>She felt extremely guilty of taking a long nap. If she had gone in earlier to remind the third miss, she would not have stayed for too long in the water.</p>
<p>While Dai Mei dried her mistress’ hair with a towel, the latter reclined on a soft couch, hands clasped the quilt that covered her body, her thoughts on the scene that had just transpired.</p>
<p><i>If she was caught by Mo Rongzhan, what would have happened?</i> <i>Would he recognize her now that she was looking more and more like how she used to? If he found out that she was the daughter of Ye Family, would he then order for her to be killed?</i></p>
<p>She shuddered at the thoughts. Fortunately, she was not caught by him. Death didn’t scare her, but she certainly did not want to die at this time. At least she had to wait for her revenge to take place before she could let herself die.</p>
<p><i>However, shouldn’t he be in the imperial palace? Why was he here?</i></p>
<p><i>Chengde Mountain Villa… </i></p>
<p><i>It all made sense!</i></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had always been fond of the recluse he found in the Chengde Mountain Villa situated near the Zhuangzi Hot Springs.</p>
<p>But Ye Zhen suddenly felt jitters, for she knew that an emperor must be accompanied by his loyal officials. This could only mean one thing– Lu Lingzhi was with him!</p>
<p>The more Ye Zhen thought about Mo Rongzhan and Lu Lingzhi, the more she felt oppressed in her heart and simply shook her head.</p>
<p>“Third Miss, did this handmaiden pull too hard?” Dai Mei asked anxiously after seeing Ye Zhen shake her head vigorously.</p>
<p>“No, I’m thinking about something, you go on.” She answered.</p>
<p>Shortly after, her eyelids started to droop, and her vision became drowsy.</p>
<p>Having such an eventful night, Ye Zhen welcomed sleep without a fight.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t know when she had gone to sleep. At the first light of dawn, she found herself cocooned in a soft quilt, her handmaiden by her side. Dai Mei dared not leave her in fear that she might fall off the soft bed.</p>
<p>“I fell asleep here?” Ye Zhen had no dream last night, she slept quite comfortably.</p>
<p>Dai Mei laughed and said, “Third Miss suddenly fell asleep last night. When this handmaiden saw you sleeping soundly, I did not ask you to get up.”</p>
<p>At the end of the bed, Ye Zhen took notice of a pail of clean, warm water. Then, she felt guilty that her handmaiden must not have slept all night.</p>
<p>“This handmaiden went to fetch some water for Miss to wash her face.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded, changed her clothes, and went to the mirror. She looked at the delicate, frosty girl in the mirror and smiled, pleased with her appearance.</p>
<p>Yet, the memory of last night with Mo Rongzhan brought back a feeling of trepidation and her smile faded at once.</p>
<p>Dai Mei quickly drew water in, but she appeared to be not alone. A little maid followed behind her, hiding her face behind Dai Mei’s skirt.</p>
<p>Upon reaching her, the little maid looked up at Ye Zhen, and her whole person was stunned.</p>
<p>“Girl, you must not stare for long!” Dai Mei gave the little maid a look but smiled proudly in the end. The third miss was really capable of stunning anyone who saw her.</p>
<p>After washing up, Ye Zhen said to Dai Mei, “I don’t want you to serve me this morning. Go back to sleep, or else you won’t last the day.”</p>
<p>“Then how can I serve you this afternoon? When this handmaiden takes lunch break, I will perhaps sleep a little longer,” said Dai Mei.</p>
<p>“I’m not going anywhere today, I will just be reading and writing with Teacher Shan. If I need something to be done, I’ll let this little girl right here to do it.” Ye Zhen laughed.</p>
<p>Dai Mei explained some things to the little maid. Only then did she retire and rest.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” Ye Zhen asked the little maid with a smile.</p>
<p>“Gr-greetings to Third Miss. This maidservant is named Xiao Yin.” The girl nervously replied.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “Dai Mei will not be here today, she needs to rest. You can stay here and run errands for me. How does this sound to you?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the girl’s prior shyness faded, and she beamed with joy at Ye Zhen. “This maidservant will be delighted, Third Miss!”</p>
<p>After eating breakfast, she took out the plant extract that she used to maintain her little tan and smeared it all over her face. However, this time she didn’t use much. She looked a little paler and ruddier than yesterday.</p>
<p>Just as she was preparing to find Teacher Shan, she saw Lu Xiangzhi stride towards her and behind him was… <i>Lu Lingzhi?</i></p>
