<p>Although reluctant, Ye Zhen couldn’t refuse but visit Lu Lingzhi, bringing with her various medicines. Only when she got to the front yard did she hesitate to go in. She internally sulked, frustrated that now, she was to attend to his injury.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8">
<div class="orp-player-wrapper aspectRateFixed orp-player-ipm orp-player-ipm-hidden defaultTag notMobile force-hide-player"></div>
<p></p><center><p></p>
<div id="adplus"></div>
<p></p></center></div>
<p><i>Ah!</i></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi had a maid prepare ointments for him but when she saw Lu Yaoyao outside, she quickly informed her master.</p>
<p>“Third Miss seems to be here.”</p>
<p>Hearing that Ye Zhen came to him, a trace of joy rose in his heart and he personally went out to see Ye Zhen standing outside the courtyard wandering aimlessly. He looked at her amused.</p>
<p>“Why can’t my third sister come in now that she’s here?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at him before lowering her gaze to the basket she brought. “These are medicines. Let me bring it to you.”</p>
<p>“All right. Come in and dress my wounds then.”</p>
<p>His injury was not really serious. Following the emperor for years, he had suffered from more serious injuries. Stitches and medicine and his injuries healed. Now he watched the little girl reluctantly hand him the medicine for his wound.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned and said, “Don’t you have a maid? Just let the maid dress you. I won’t!”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked at her with amusement. “Didn’t you learn medicine from Third Aunt at an early age? How will you get into the School of Medicine without enough practice?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen scoffed and decided to leave, pivoting on her heels. Turning around, she was welcomed by the sight of Lu Shiming and Lu Xiangzhi, father and son giddily waving their hands as they approached. Instantly, Ye Zhen’s face fell into a frown.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, are you here to deliver medicine to your  eldest brother?” Lu Xiangzhi, having clearer eyesight among the two, was the first to see her sister and stepped up his pace.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, Lu Shiming tapped Ye Zhen’s forehead. “You hurt your eldest brother. You shall not hunt from now on.”</p>
<p>“Third Uncle, Yaoyao didn’t mean it. In fact, she’s here, bringing medicine as an apology.” Lu Lingzhi was quick to come to Ye Zhen’s defense.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi looked at Lu Lingzhi’s arm and couldn’t help but notice the rags that covered the wound. “Well, it looks to me that Yaoyao still hasn’t bandaged your wound.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen could not refuse anymore. Despite her unwillingness, she had to follow Lu Lingzhi into his chambers as Lu Shiming and Lu Xiangzhi followed on their trail.</p>
<p>Before Lu Lingzhi showed his true nature, Ye Zhen always thought he was a helpless scholar and befriended him. Later, she was poisoned by him before she realized that he was too good at disguising himself.</p>
<p>His vile ways and excellent equestrian skills brought him in the position of Mo Rongzhan’s right-hand man. Together, they won victory after another on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Looking at his strong arm, Ye Zhen wished she possessed a knife to cut off his hand and be done with it all.</p>
<p>“Third Younger Sister, here.” Lu Lingzhi looked up at her with a gentle smile while offering his wounded arm. He only felt that this younger sister really didn’t know how to hide her little thoughts. His disagreement with her attending the academy made her sour towards him, he believed.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the wound on his arm, sprinkled some medicine on it, and took a clean white cloth to wrap it with.</p>
<p>If she desired to use the spirit spring water from her palm, she could do it very well and the wound would heal faster. However, in her heart, she sought for his demise, not his well-being.</p>
<p>Thus, she wrapped the wound neatly and stood up to bid her farewell.</p>
<p>“If it is fine with Father and my brothers, I’ll go back first.” Ye Zhen asked permission from Lu Shiming.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming knew that his daughter had been studying with his wife recently. “Well, you go to your chambers. I just have something to discuss with your eldest brother.”</p>
<p>Gathering the medicines and leaving some on the table, Ye Zhen left without exchanging words with Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming watched his daughter leave and shook his head. “This daughter, I have spoiled too much.”</p>
<p>“The Lu Family can now afford to spoil the girls. It’s no big deal.” Lu Lingzhi replied before throwing a calculated glance towards Lu Shiming.</p>
<p>“Third Uncle, you could easily be an official just like what Grandmother wished you to be. I presume you have no plans going back to the border town.”</p>
<p>While Lu Lingzhi urged his uncle to join politics, Lu Shiming felt torn about this. Unlike the rest of the family, Lu Shiming was content with the simple life he lived in the border town.</p>
<p>“I was just about to tell you that Mother is getting on in the years. Not granting her wish, I cannot be considered a filial son anymore. She said it’s a shame to see this opportunity go in vain.”</p>
<p>“It’s always difficult at the beginning but you have to consider the advantages it offers. Would you like to build a clinic here in the capital just like the one you opened in the border town?” Lu Lingzhi tapped his fingers on the desk, his eyes lingered on his uncle’s face.</p>
<p>“Next year, Fourth Younger Brother will take the imperial examination. If Third Sister enters the academy, her status will be different. If you become an official, you will pave the road for them.”</p>
