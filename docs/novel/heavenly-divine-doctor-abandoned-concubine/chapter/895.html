            <p><strong>Chapter 434 – </strong><em><strong>Zhen</strong></em><strong> Wants You (2)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen wrinkled her eyebrows and pushed his arms away. “What does the emperor want this servant to do? Is this not humble enough?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan ignored her attempt, hugged her soft body instead, and felt that the anger at the bottom of his heart had transformed into an evil fire in his body. He pressed her under his body and looked at her with deep and unfathomable eyes. “<em>Zhen</em> does not need your groveling. You know what <em>zhen</em> wants.”</p>
<p>“You can’t think that!” Ye Zhen cried with gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Alas, her protest went unheeded as Mo Rongzhan’s eyes became deeper and deeper. Without letting her go, he held her hands tightly within his big palm. Then, suddenly, the sound of clothes being torn reverberated in the air.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s face immediately paled as her clothes were ripped by him using one hand, revealing the white satin underclothes. She glared at him. “Mo Rongzhan, what are you going to do?!”</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> has always done what <em>zhen</em> wants. In all respects, <em>zhen</em> has only ever given in to you, wants you to be willing, and also wants your heart,” he whispered, hands busy untying her skirt, leaving only her dudou and a pair of obscene underpants.</p>
<p>Seeing the determination to **** in his eyes, she knew that he was different from the last time. He would not let her go!</p>
<p>He dipped his head and kissed her lips hard, forcefully stealing her air away, leaving her breathless. He grasped her hands with one hand and pinned her legs with his knee. She endured his rough kiss and the big hand kneading her chest that was like a fire torch, burning her everywhere it touched.</p>
<p>In the end, she gave up struggling. Her struggle would only make him want her more.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, <em>zhen</em> wants you!” he said in her ears with a voice that sounded like he was repressing immeasurable pain.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen closed her eyes, appearing like she had resigned herself to fate and allowing him to do what he wanted to her.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her with burning eyes. He did not want this kind of her. Rather than this, what he wanted was her gentle voice coquettishly letting out low and lingering sounds under him, begging him to be gentle. But this… this wasn’t the Yaoyao he wanted.</p>
<p>“Are you really so unmoved by <em>zhen</em>?” he asked, untying her dudou and sucking on the pink bud with his thin lips.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took a sharp and deep breath at his action, feeling something she had never felt before climbing up from her back. She gritted her teeth and held back the noise that wanted to escape from her mouth.</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> has never wanted a woman so much in <em>zhen’s</em> life before, so <em>zhen</em> won’t let you go.” Mo Rongzhan’s voice was very low and hoarse as he pulled her long and slender legs apart, to make her feel his longing for her more clearly.</p>
<p>“Even if I don’t want to?” Ye Zhen looked at him with a gaze that was as cold as frozen tundra.</p>
<p>Alas, the only answer she received was in the form of him tearing open her underwear.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gritted her teeth and endured the humiliation. She did not want to beg for mercy. In any case, he was determined to do it, so even if she begged him, he wouldn’t let her go.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan kissed her thoroughly. He had never been so stirred up and excited as he was now. This was the first time he was so fascinated by a woman that he wanted to merge her into his flesh and blood, so she would be with him forever.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, look at me.” He spread her legs wider, all his blood clamoring for her.</p>
<p>At this moment, her hands gained freedom. And without knowing when, she had already pulled out the jade hairpin on her head. Then, not even bothering to answer him, she put the sharp point of the jade hairpin on her throat, ready to stab.</p>
<p>Seeing her action, Mo Rongzhan was in a daze, feeling like his heart was pierced by ten thousand arrows. Despite the pain he felt, he reacted swiftly enough and managed to grab her hand before she could stab herself. Snatching the jade hairpin from her hand, he tossed it to the ground, shattering it into several pieces.</p>
<p>“Why?” he asked, voice still without waves.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen closed her eyes and opened her mouth, voice hoarse as she said, “I am Ye Zhen~”</p>
<p>He interrupted her, “Because you are Ye Zhen’s younger sister? <em>Zhen</em> didn’t kill Ye Zhen. You… Your father is also… He’s not dead.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?” She suddenly opened her eyes and looked at the man in shock. She had guessed that her father was not dead, but how would he know that?</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> cannot release your father and your elder brother openly. <em>Zhen</em> could only arrange for some people to rescue them from the prison. However, later on, they disappeared,” he whispered. “However Yaoyao, <em>zhen </em>cannot let the whole Ye family go. You should understand <em>zhen</em>.”</p>
<p>Any newly ascended emperor, as long as they were not personally assisted by Ye Yisong, would not allow for such a powerful family to exist. Moreover, Ye Yisong himself was a treacherous minister who everyone hated to the bones, so Mo Rongzhan could not let him go.</p>
<p>“You let them go?” She had only suspected that her father and brother were not dead, but today Mo Rongzhan actually confirmed it with his own words that he really did not kill them. Thus, she could not help her mood, becoming excited all of a sudden.</p>
<p>He lowered his body. “Are you very happy that they are not dead?”</p>
<p>She pursed her lips. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“What if they’re dead?” he asked, sneering. Even when he was incredibly angry, he still couldn’t control his desire. He still wanted her. <em>This little girl… When did she penetrate my heart and soul to the point that even when I want to put her down, I am unable to do so?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s expression immediately changed and she snapped. “Are you playing me?”</p>
<p>“Whether they are dead or not, you won’t ever stay on <em>zhen’s</em> side, right?” Mo Rongzhan murmured, kissing her earlobe while his slender fingers were gently roving atop her flat belly.</p>
<p>“Stop it!” She reacted, reaching out to push him away, cheeks flushed as begonia as an even stranger feeling spread across her bones and limbs.</p>
