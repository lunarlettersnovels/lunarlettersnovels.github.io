            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 342 – Why Choose Her?</strong></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked up at his cousin. At first glance, he felt that she was just like Ye Zhen. However, with her transformation, she appeared in front of everyone with an amazing demeanour.</p>
<p><em>Does she resemble Ye Zhen?</em></p>
<p><em>Indeed!</em></p>
<p>However, unlike Ye Zhen, she was cleverer, adorable, charming, and more mischievous.</p>
<p><em>Such a little girl actually asked him if she was good-looking?</em></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi couldn’t help but smile. “Very good-looking, Yaoyao looks the best.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sneered. “Since I am so good-looking, then Ye Zhen must have been good-looking too, at least better than Wang Fei Lu. Why did the emperor dislike her instead and choose Wang Fei Lu?”</p>
<p>Little by little, the smile on Lu Lingzh’s lips faded. “Yaoyao, did someone say something to you?”</p>
<p>“Who will say what in front of me? I just feel strange.” Ye Zhen glanced at Lu Lingzhi with a smile. “It’s one thing to be gentle and virtuous if Wang Fei Lu is beautiful. But she is jealous and selfish. It’s hard to imagine that the emperor chose her instead of Wang Fei Ye.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao!” Although Lu Lingzhi wanted to shout, he still held himself, and in the end, spoke in a low voice. “How can you say that about Wang Fei Lu? She’s still your sister.”</p>
<p>The corners of Ye Zhen’s lips revealed a deep smile. “If it weren’t for my title as a princess, do you think I could still stay in the capital? Eldest Brother, you don’t know yet, do you? Wang Fei Lu told Second Uncle that she wanted to marry me off to Liang Chun as a second wife. Don’t you know what kind of person Liang Chun is?”</p>
<p>Liu Lingzhi’s face had visible changes. Liang Chun was not only a widower but also a cut sleeve*. How can Yaoyao be married off to him? “impossible! Are you serious?”</p>
<p>[T/N: <a href="https://www.scmp.com/article/703796/long-history-cutting-sleeves#:~:text=The%20term%20duan%20xiu%2C%20or,young%20man%20named%20Dong%20Xian." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Cut sleeve</u></a> is a euphemism for homosexuals. These are times when homosexuality was looked down upon. For those interested in the origins of the term, check out the embedded link.]</p>
<p>“The last time, Grandmother almost got sick because of Wang Fei Lu since she wouldn’t let me stay in the capital and wanted to marry me off far away. If I hadn’t been titled a princess, I don’t know what would have happened to me now.” Ye Zhen didn’t say that Lu Wushuang had fallen out of favor, she just wanted to provoke the feelings between this brother-sister duo.</p>
<p>“I don’t know … Shuang’er, she is like this,” Lu Lingzhi said helplessly, glad that Yaoyao had not been ruined by her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “So I am very curious. To what extent was late Wang Fei Ye evil that the emperor would fall for Wang Fei Lu? I heard that the emperor hates Wang Fei Ye very much.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi didn’t know how to answer. He was worried that Lu Wushuang’s days in the palace were not as carefree as before. Mo Rongzhan was not a fatuous king. If he were to glimpse Lu Wushuang’s true nature, he would doubt her identity even more.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, about late Wang Fei Ye… it’s because her surname is Ye.” Lu Lingzhi replied bitterly, “Don’t mention her anymore. You and she are two different people.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said with a smile, “I’m different from her of course. I won’t marry the emperor. I’m Princess Fu Rong. How can I be as unlucky as her?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi had no choice but to smile. “What else did Wang Fei Lu do to you?”</p>
<p>“How can she do anything to me now? She has deep sisterly affection for me. I hope I can put in a good word for her in front of Empress Dowager.” She smiled. “Eldest Brother, tell me, how can I deepen my sisterhood with Wang Fei Lu?”</p>
<p>“Ah… Yaoyao, if you don’t like her, don’t go see her.”</p>
<p>After what his little sister did to her before, how could he ask Yaoyao to be good to Lu Wushuang? With the kind of person Liang Chun was, he understood that marrying off Yaoyao to him meant destruction to her.</p>
<p><em>This… Shuang’er has gone too far.</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen was someone who knew when to stop. Before she went too far, she deftly diverted the conversation to the letter. “I will send the letter to Grandmother. You should have a good rest.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi nodded with a smile and watched the little girl walk out of the room. Once she was out of sight, his eyes doused in solemnity.</p>
<p>He knew that he shouldn’t have let Lu Wushuang impersonate Ye Zhen. Over time, she would certainly reveal her true colours. How can a smart man like Mo Rongzhan not sense the changes in Lu Wushuang’s temperament? She was not the kind of person with a deep mind and would show signs sooner or later.</p>
<p><em>Had Mo Rongzhan found out?</em></p>
<p>If Mo Rongzhan knew Ye Zhen was the one to save him back then, he would have surely taken her to the palace and made her Empress. Even the Ye Family would not have been entangled in the mess. Also at the very least, Ye Yiqing and the others would still be alive despite being connected to that crime.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi closed his eyes. His concealment had indirectly brought deaths upon many people. He could only try not to recall these things, otherwise, he would live in guilt every day. He was sorry for Ye Zhen and could only repay her in the afterlife.</p>
