            <p><strong>Chapter 527 – Still Couldn’t Find Her</strong></p>
<p>He could not find Yaoyao!</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was holding the secret report that Shen Yi had sent back. His mood was even heavier than before. He had never ever regretted like this. He should not have agreed to let the little girl go to Huaijiang City that day in Gujia Village. Instead, he should have brought her directly to the capital and immediately married her into the palace. Regardless of whether she was willing or not, he would have still been able to see her every day.</p>
<p><em>Where exactly did she go?</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Consort Xu Xian is outside asking for an audience,” Eunuch Fu walked in, bowed, and whispered to Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“Tell her to go back,” Mo Rongzhan said coldly. Even if he didn’t see Xu Huiru, he knew exactly why she had come. “I haven’t abolished her concubine position yet, and she is this desperate.”</p>
<p>He had sent Tang Zhen to investigate the Governor-general of Huainan for the embezzlement of disaster funds and medicinal materials. The Governor-general of Huainan had turned out to be Ye Yisong’s man. Not only did he lie about the disaster every year but also hoarded all the money and medicinal herbs that the Imperial Courtyard sent to Huaijiang City for himself. The money had been found, but the medicinal herbs were nowhere to be found. Over the years, the medicinal herbs that the Imperial Courtyard sent to Huainan were worth a lot of money, but who could transport these herbs without anyone knowing?</p>
<p>It was believed that no medicinal merchant in Jin Country would dare to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Now, many officials in Huainan had been arrested, and even Xu Ji had been imprisoned. Unlike the Governor-general of Huainan, Xu Ji was impolite to the Princess and was imprisoned for plotting to murder her. Prime Minister Xu had not dared to plead for mercy.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu quietly agreed and bowed his head to leave. He had been very careful in front of the emperor these past few days, afraid that he would make him unhappy if he said anything wrong. Ever since the news of the princess’ disappearance arrived, he had never seen the emperor smile. Even Ye Yaoyao, who thought she would replace the princess as the emperor’s new favorite, had already been sent out of the palace.</p>
<p>Alas, it was really an eventful time. <em>Princess, where exactly are you? Please return quickly.</em></p>
<p>Xu Huiru was standing outside the imperial study, she heard the emperor’s curt refusal to see her first-hand. She immediately got down to her knees and declared that if the emperor refused to see her, she would not get up.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen had just walked right behind her when he heard Xu Huiru’s words, he slowed down.</p>
<p>“It’s you!” Xu Huiru immediately stood up when she saw Tang Zhen. “Tang Zhen, you caught my brother and accused him of hurting Lu Yaoyao, right?”</p>
<p>“Xu Xianfei, this marquis doesn’t have the ability to casually slander a person. On the other hand, Xu Xianfei’s older brother is more capable. He can easily order the princess to be burned to death,” Tang Zhen said coldly.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Prime Minister Xu protecting him, he would have killed Xu Ji long ago. The emperor had spared Xu Ji’s life because of him. Xu Huiru thought she could plead for him. If it weren’t for her, how would Xu Ji even know about Ye Yaoyao?</p>
<p>Xu Huiru now hated Ye Zhen to the bone. <em>(This bitch) Not only did she survive, but even implicated my eldest brother (in this problem). It’d be best if she (this bitch) died outside, otherwise, my Xu family would definitely settle all of the accounts with this bitch when she returns to the capital.</em></p>
<p>She wouldn’t let the matter slide, she looked squarely at the man before her, and boldly said, “My older brother is not such a person. Tang Zhen, the reason why you slandered Xu Ji was obviously because you have a secret crush on the princess—”</p>
<p>Seeing how Xu Huiru had deliberately amplified her voice, Tang Zhen only smiled disdainfully. He didn’t want to say anything more to her, someone who was already unable to protect herself. He simply turned around and entered the imperial study.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu looked at Xu Huiru and shook his head. “Your Highness, you should go back.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru glared hatefully at the retreating figure. As long as she was able to win the Emperor’s favor again in the future, Tang Zhen would pay the price.</p>
<p>Although Mo Rongzhan had heard the conversation outside, he did not take it to heart. Xu Huiru’s words were not worth his attention. He glanced at Tang Zhen and said, “Did you find out where the medicinal herbs went?”</p>
<p>“Replying to the emperor, Her Highness the Princess had mentioned Jinkou City before, so this minister began to investigate in Jinkou City. The medicinal herbs sent by the Imperial Courtyard to Huaijiang City are probably being transported overseas since a few years ago,” Tang Zhen said.</p>
<p>“Overseas?” Mo Rongzhan’s eyes darkened. “Is it related to Zhao Tianji?”</p>
<p>A few days ago, Mo Rongzhan had asked about Zhao Tianji’s identity from the people brought back from the private mine. He was just the master of a small island. Why did he have to build so many weapons? If the herbs were sold to Zhao Jia Island, he would have to question Zhao Tianji’s real purpose.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen whispered, “I’m not sure, but…Some people discovered that Zhao Tianji appeared in Huaijiang City.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan suddenly raised his head. “Zhao Tianji went to Huaijiang City?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Tang Zhen said, “Your Majesty, could Zhao Tianji have taken the princess to Zhao Jia Island?”</p>
<p>“I will have someone look for him,” Mo Rongzhan said coldly. <em>If Zhao Tianji really took Yaoyao to Zhao Island, then I will raze that island to the ground and make him pay the price.</em></p>
<p>Tang Zhen wanted to personally go to Zhao Jia Island, but the emperor had not given his orders, so he dared not ask.</p>
<p>“Lu Lingzhi isn’t back yet?” Mo Rongzhan suddenly asked.</p>
<p>More than a month ago, Lu Lingzhi had left the capital to treat his illness. There had been no news so far. He had heard that he had been to Huaijiang City, but he had disappeared after that. He did not know if he was able to find the antidote to his remnant poison.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen frowned slightly. “Your Majesty, I only went to the Lu family yesterday to inquire. The Lu family has no news of the Marquis of Anyang.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded slightly. “The new emperor of East Qing has ascended the throne and will not be able to fight Jin in two years. What do you think of Biancheng’s current situation?”</p>
<p>A few months ago, the war between the Jin Empire and the East Qing Kingdom was on the verge of breaking out. But then, no one expected that the Crown Prince of East Qing Kingdom, who had been suppressed for many years, would suddenly rise. Not only did he regain the trust of the Emperor of East Qing, but also pulled down Imperial Concubine Wan, who had been favored by the emperor for many years. Whereafter, Wan struck back with her last force and incited her son to usurp the throne. However, instead of success, they were caught by the Crown Prince. In the end, the Imperial Concubine Wan and her son died from the crime of treason, and the crippled Crown Prince who had been almost dethroned, ascended to the throne.</p>
<p>This matter shocked the entire world. No matter who it was, none could remember any remarkable ability that the stupid Crown Prince possessed. It was said that he had a strategist who was smarter than Zhuge Liang*. Otherwise, he would not have defeated Imperial Concubine Wan and her son so quickly.</p>
<p>[* Zhuge Liang is a renowned strategist in historical China. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuge_Liang]" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuge_Liang]</a></p>
<p>“I believe that it is the best for us to be on good terms with the East Qing Kingdom,” Tang Zhen glanced at Mo Rongzhan and said.</p>
<p>Now that the East Qing Kingdom did not have the strength to start a war with the Jin Empire, could the Jin Empire take down them (EQ) in one fell swoop? They might as well develop a good relationship with each other and allow their troops to recuperate, so as not to give the other two* a chance to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>[ *we don’t know what the author means by two, is it MRZ’s kingdom and East Qing or some other two countries entirely.]</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded slightly. “The Emperor of East Qing has sent a letter of peace. If I agree that the two countries won’t fight for ten years, they will send envoys.”</p>
<p>“What does the emperor mean…” Tang Zhen looked up at Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“I agree,” Mo Rongzhan said calmly. He did have the ambition to conquer the world, but he knew better than anyone this was not the time.</p>
