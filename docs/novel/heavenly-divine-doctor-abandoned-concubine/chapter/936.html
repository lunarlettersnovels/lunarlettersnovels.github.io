            <p><strong>Chapter 393 – Poisoning of Xianfei Xu</strong></p>
<p>Seeing off Lu Wushuang, Xu Huiru let out a sigh of relief and looked at Ye Zhen with a smile. “Princess, I presume Gui Fei insisted that you come to this palace.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled lightly, looked at Xu Huiru’s complexion, and said, “Where does Xianfei feel uneasy? Why did you not invite an imperial physician to come and check her pulse?”</p>
<p>There was a touch of anxiousness in Xu Huiru’s eyes. How could she say that it’s because Mo Rongzhan refused to sleep with her? She had concealed this all along but now fell ill. If she found a physician to check on her, would not the fact that she is still a virgin be exposed?</p>
<p>“I am just a little tired, it is nothing serious,” Xu Huiru said.</p>
<p>“Still, I’ll check your pulse, if it’s okay” Ye Zhen felt that Xu Huiru’s face didn’t look tired, but she must be ill somewhere.</p>
<p>Thinking that Lu Yaoyao was merely a student who had just joined as a physician, Xu Huiru felt she would lack the ability to detect from her pulse that she is still a virgin. She could check her pulse and block those mouths for good. She held out her hand and said, “Thank you, then.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen placed her hand on Xu Huiru’s wrist and felt her pulse sink late, and … She was inwardly surprised. <em>Why is Xianfei Xu still a virgin?</em></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, how is my health?” Xu Huiru asked with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Oh, it will be Xianfei’s menstruation soon, it will cause weariness and abdominal pain. If you do not wish to send for a doctor, drink some <a href="https://www.google.cm/search?q=%E7%BA%A2%E7%B3%96%E6%B0%B4&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiI7rqR0L_xAhXUJKYKHfGCD6YQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1302&amp;bih=624" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>brown sugar solution</u></a>.” Ye Zhen calmly withdrew her hand; she could tell why Xu Huiru didn’t ask an imperial physician to check on her.</p>
<p><em>Does she not want people to know that she is still a virgin? But, why? Isn’t Mo Rongzhan doting on her?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen suddenly thought of Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru smiled and nodded. “I will have people prepare some brown sugar tea in a moment.”</p>
<p>“Xianfei should pay more attention to rest.” Ye Zhen smiled in a trice, suppressing the confusion in her heart. She looked around and caught sight of the blood bird’s nest beside her. She frowned and said, “This blood bird’s nest… I was not the one who gave this to Gui Fei. If Xianfei wants to eat them, one should be more careful.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for the reminder, Yaoyao. Although blood bird’s nests are precious, this palace is not without it.” Harboring suspicions over Gui Fei’s intentions, Xu Huiru was not a fool to simply eat the blood bird’s nest that Lu Wushuang brought.</p>
<p>With those words, Ye Zhen was able to confirm the other was on guard against Lu Wushuang’s schemes. “Then I shall not disturb Xianfei’s rest. I’ll take my leave.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru personally sent her off at the door and watched Ye Zhen leave Xinhe Palace. She turned and took out the blood bird’s nest and snorted coldly. “Qianlan, check if this blood bird’s nest is poisoned.”</p>
<p>Qianlan nodded gently. “Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen left Xinhe Palace and went back to the Lu Mansion as she did not want to see Lu Wushuang once more.</p>
<p>In the evening, there was news from the palace that Xianfei Xu had been poisoned and was unconscious. Her maid-in-waiting pointed out that she was poisoned with the blood bird’s nest brought by Lu Wushuang. Because of this, Gui Fei was summoned by the empress dowager for interrogation.</p>
<p>But Lu Wushuang kept insisting on seeing Mo Rongzhan. When the man arrived, she persisted that the blood bird’s nests were not hers, that Lu Yaoyao had given it to her and she had only gifted it to Xu Huiru.</p>
<p>The news soon made its way to the Lu Mansion.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu immediately had people call Ye Zhen to the upper room.</p>
<p>In addition to the old madam, both Lu Shiming and Lu Lingzhi were present. When Ye Zhen saw this situation, she already guessed what happened.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu apprised her of the goings-on in the palace and asked with some worry, “Grandmother believes you won’t ever poison Gui Fei but what’s with those blood bird’s nests?”</p>
<p><em>As expected, Lu Wushuang indeed poisoned those blood bird’s nests!</em> As Ye Zhen thought to herself, she said, “Grandmother, I have been in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard these days. When would I have the time to get blood bird’s nests for Gui Fei? When I was about to leave the palace today, Gui Fei sent for me and said that she was going to visit Xianfei Xu and asked me to accompany her.”</p>
<p>“Those blood bird’s nests have nothing to do with you?” Lu Lingzhi frowned at Ye Zhen. <em>Should anything happen to Xianfei Xu, it will surely bring trouble to Yaoyao.</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen put on a smile yet not a smile and said, “Eldest Brother, do you think I am a fool? Where in the palace can one take things in as one pleases? Before seeing Gui Fei, the blood bird’s nest would be found by the aunt in the palace. ”</p>
<p>“What did GuiFei say?” Lu Shiming asked. Conspiring to murder an imperial concubine in the palace was a capital crime, and he didn’t believe his daughter would do such a thing.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that obvious? Lu Wushuang wanted me to be the scapegoat. She was afraid of being found out that she conspired to murder Xu Huiru, so she called me over. Unfortunately, the idea was good, but she was too stupid,” Ye Zhen said coldly.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked at her, saying, “Yaoyao, there may be a misunderstanding in this matter.”</p>
