            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 209 – Foolish</strong></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, you must punish this wang fei. I dare not complain. But, one wants to know whom one lost to.”</p>
<p>She knew she could not refute or influence his decision now. But she wanted to know who the maiden was. She was certain her current plight was only temporary, in a fit of rage Mo Rongzhan had done what he had; after all, a man’s ego is taller than the tallest mountain and this one was an emperor at that. So, she believed that when he was marginally appeased, she would regain his favor in the future. And when that day arrived, this girl would be shredded to pieces.</p>
<p>But who was Mo Rongzhan? Did she think he would not see through her ruse? He broke into a ruthless smile.</p>
<p>“Leave at once!”</p>
<p>The iota of hope and faith that Lu Wushuang had in Mo Rongzhan was suddenly shattered–she looked aghast at his brutality. The man who once doted on her unconditionally was shielding a lowly maiden while tossing her aside without so much as remorse.</p>
<p><i>Was it to protect her or for other reasons?</i></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu immediately summoned two little eunuchs to force Lu Wushuang out.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Your Majesty…” Lu Wushuang was reluctant to leave. She desperately wanted to know who the maiden was.</p>
<p><i>Why did Mo Rongzhan suddenly change his temperament? Did he not think of me as his savior? How could he forget so quickly?</i></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was unaffected by Lu Wushuang’s shrill cries for mercy even as she was unceremoniously dragged out of his chambers. She had undermined his authority and ran amuck, this time she had really touched his bottom line. Thus, he had steeled his heart, and somewhere, he was even glad about it.</p>
<p>After it had quieted down, he turned to look at the person who was still hiding under the quilt.</p>
<p>“You can come out,” he said.</p>
<p>There was a smile in his eyes; <i>this little girl who was akin to a little beast that refused to admit defeat before him was this afraid of Lu Wushuang.</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen quickly got off the bed and cast Mo Rongzhan a light look. Without a preamble, she said, “Your Majesty, can this official’s daughter leave now?”</p>
<p>“So, you are afraid of Lu Wushuang?” He was still amused by his findings.</p>
<p>“I just do not want any trouble.” She did not mince words.</p>
<p>Now that Lu Wushuang had brought honor to the Lu Family as this country’s Wang Fei, their entire family heeded to her as if her words were an imperial edict. When this was the extent of blind faith, it was no surprise that she did not have the confidence to challenge, let alone topple, her position in the family. For now, the best approach was avoidance and she had actively advocated it thus far.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her chilly visage and the glint in his eyes was replaced by sternness.</p>
<p>“What kind of trouble?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s brows creased, she did not know if this man holding the supreme power was stupid or blind. <i>Could he not put two and two together? Did she have to spell it out for him?!</i></p>
<p>“Your Majesty really does not know?” Her eyes reflected her incredulity. “Last time, Wang Fei misunderstood this official’s daughter, which has affected our sisterly feelings. If she sees this official’s daughter here again, the whole Lu Family might misunderstand.”</p>
<p><i>Had he forgotten about the slap she was served? He was a witness to it!</i></p>
<p>“Are you afraid that others will misunderstand you?” His brows furrowed, he did not like the way things were shaping.</p>
<p>“It does not matter what other people think of this official’s daughter. One is only worried that others would misunderstand one’s actions towards the things one does not intend to do.” Ye Zhen looked at him squarely and made herself absolutely clear.</p>
<p>How could Mo Rongzhan not grasp the meaning in her words? His face suddenly turned cold.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen disregarded his reaction and continued with a smile. “No matter what your thoughts are, Your Majesty, your eyes are already fine. It’s time for this official’s daughter to go back. One still has to prepare breakfast for the Little Prince in the morning.”</p>
<p>“Things you do not intend to do? Then, coming here to the palace, you did not harbor the same intentions most women have.” He was stunned at her words.</p>
<p>“No. Your Majesty can rest assured that this official’s daughter will not be <i>foolish </i>in her life.”</p>
<p>It was enough for her to be stupid once. The price had been too steep. She would not make the same mistake again!</p>
<p><i>Foolish?!</i> He stared at her with a livid face. “Lu Yaoyao, aren’t you too daring!” He roared.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took two steps back at the abrupt change, nevertheless, she persisted.</p>
<p>“Is it not a foolish act, Your Majesty?” There was a hint of ridicule in her tone. But before he could react he continued. “Before, this official’s daughter heard that His Majesty favours Wang Fei Lu. Everyone knows that she is doted upon in the Inner Palace. But witnessing what happened today, I do not think it is the case anymore. I’m not after riches and comforts of luxury. As such, I won’t be foolish to let myself be lonely for a lifetime in this palace.” She decided it was time to permanently allay his suspicions about her and award herself the much needed respite.</p>
<p>“Be lonely in the palace for a lifetime?… It depends on whether I will allow it or not.”</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, Mo Rongzhan had met a woman who despised him and did not seek the eminence an emperor could offer. Unable to fathom the idea, his heart choked in anxiety.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao,” he said with gritted teeth, “in this lifetime, don’t even dare to think about becoming my woman!”</p>
<p>“Then this official’s daughter thanks His Majesty’s empathy.” Ye Zhen smiled, agreed in mock sincerity, and added. “Your Majesty, this official’s daughter will take her leave.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan took a deep breath and fought the urge to lose patience and strangle the unscrupulous woman with his bare hands.</p>
<p>“Get out of my sight!”</p>
<p>The words were music to her ears, Ye Zhen’s eyes instantly lit up.</p>
<p>Ah, finally, she could leave this terrible place!</p>
