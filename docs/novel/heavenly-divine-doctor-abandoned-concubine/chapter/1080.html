            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 249 – Unexpected Report of Victory (1)</strong></p>
<p>Now that the initial inhibitions and doubts had settled, Ye Zhen and Man Qin talked about Qianjin in Jinkou City. Although she did not particularly manage the business there before, it didn’t mean she wouldn’t get involved in the business now. She ought to learn and understand things thoroughly only then would she be able to uproot her enemy the Lu Family.</p>
<p>As the young girl elaborated on her plans, Man Qin, inwardly, went through a series of changes. What started with surprise in no time turned to astonishment, eventually halting at intimidation. The grasp the girl had over the business was astounding, her views and ideas were neither immature nor impulsive. As he listened, by and by, he was skeptical about whether Lu Yaoyao had really grown up in the border town.</p>
<p>He had seen many a young misses, but none to compare to the aura and intellect that Fifth Miss possessed. Qianjin had started out as a hobby, but now it was a name to be reckoned with; achieved singlehandedly by his former mistress. So, when he came over, he held little expectation about this sister who had abruptly materialized. He knew it would be unfair to draw similarities between the two misses, even so, he was unconsciously harboring the notion.</p>
<p>However, he did not dare to think so now. The girl had evinced remarkable wisdom but he brooked no suspicion towards the origin of this knowledge. By now he had concluded that it must have been Ye Zhen who had deeply trusted this sister and shared every detail of the business with her. Otherwise, how else would this girl from border town be able to glean so much in such a short time?</p>
<p>Soon the discussion came to a close, more so because Ye Zhen was time-bound and could not linger any longer. Man Qin made no attempts to conceal his thoughts, his admiration and support were clearly written on his face. Satisfied, she got up to take her leave.</p>
<p>Hong Ling followed her downstairs. She had been restlessly ever since the day she had confirmed this miss’s identity. Taking the opportunity now, she spoke out her innermost desire. “Young Miss, when can this handmaiden come and serve you?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you helping me now?” Ye Zhen asked with a smile. “I am in the academy now, and I don’t need people to serve around me. You can help me do more things outside.”</p>
<p>“This handmaiden is afraid that others will not serve you well,” Hong Ling said.</p>
<p>Growing up along with the young miss, she knew best her preferences. Knowing how pampered and spoiled the young miss was, and knowing how Ye Zhen could be a little fastidious, she was worried others would not be able to take care of her well.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Came Ye Zhen’s reply.</p>
<p>She was no longer the former Ye Zhen. Thus, she would not be angry because of the poor service of the maids assigned to her. These things were just trivial matters to her now.</p>
<p>Hong Ling gazed at the young miss who was markedly different from before. Gone was the childlike cheeriness she once had about her. The nonchalance and solemnity with which she carried herself were at the same time impressive and heart-wrenching. Although the girl was no longer petulant and headstrong, she still dearly loved and cared for Ye Zhen.</p>
<p><em>It’s only when one is loved that one dares to be petulant and willful. Now, is there anyone who can indulge in loving the young miss like the second lord?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">♚</p>
<p>Back at the Lu Mansion.</p>
<p>The moment Ye Zhen returned, she went to find Old Madam Lu to pay her respects. Initially, she had started to do this to gain the favor of the fattest thigh in the household, but now it had become a habit. It served her well, this habit, for the old woman was fond of her. At least on the surface, she was; however, how deep it ran remained to be seen.</p>
<p>A few days ago, it was the old madam’s birthday. Lu Shixun, the second lord of the family, had kept his word and returned on time. The old matriarch was absolutely elated, who would not be over a filial son?</p>
<p>Unlike Lu Shiming, who was as warm as jade, Lu Shixun was a very serious and calm person. Being solely responsible for the family business, he had developed a character that of an astute stoic tradesman. Such a person, by far, was not easy to assess let alone find a weakness.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I’m back.” As Ye Zhen entered the room, her face wore a sweet and bright smile.</p>
<p>There were many people in the room. Except for a few cousins, it seemed like the whole household was here. Even Lu Shixun and his wife were present, talking with the old madam.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu saw Ye Zhen come in, and the smile on her face became even kinder.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao is back. Come here, let Grandmother have a look. You haven’t been home for many days.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was inwardly surprised. <em>What’s the matter today? Everyone is here with Old Madam. </em>She smiled and greeted the elders. Then she snuggled up to the old madam.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, do you think I’m fat? Am I tanned?”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu pinched Ye Zhen’s cheek. “There’s hardly any meat left and you’re asking if you are fat? Let me see. Well, it’s white.”</p>
<p>“Mother, this child is more and more unruly in front of you.” Pei Shi was somewhat annoyed by her daughter. She showed reserve nor bashfulness that was expected of girls her age.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had a characteristic charm that would impress and wriggle its way in through the coldest of hearts. She knew to read people, and especially the old madam. It was no wonder that the matriarch took pride in the girl’s skittish but sincere ways. The other misses were quite uptight and did not like being coquettish as much as she did.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen rubbed against the old madam’s arms and said with a smile, “I’m filial to my grandmother, how could I be unruly?”</p>
