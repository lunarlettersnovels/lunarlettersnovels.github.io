            <p><strong>Chapter 371 – We Won (2)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s words were full of ridicule and scorn, Prince Shun’s face turned greener the more she continued.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s lips slightly curved. “Yaoyao is correct. You didn’t dictate that women could not play. Prince Shun, you are a man. You must learn to accept defeat.”</p>
<p><em>Motherfuck*r!</em> <em>When was he ever unable to accept defeat! </em>Prince Shun felt the fires in his heart steadily rising. Every time he thought of his casino, his heart would burn with a flaming pain.</p>
<p>“We won! We won!” Mo Rongyi ran over with an injured shoulder, happily hugging Ye Zhen’s arm.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled, saying, “That’s right, we won. A’Yi, in the future, if there is ever anyone else that cannot stay in their place, you must fiercely serve them a blow.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan took a deep look at the little girl before turning to ask Tang Zhen, “Have you found out the reason the princess’s horse got spooked?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, there was a thin needle in the behind of Her Imperial Highness’s horse. It was probably because of that needle that the horse spooked.” Tang Zhen quietly stated. At this time, he was still filled with unease. When Yaoyao had almost been thrown off by the horse, he had already thought of immediately saving her. But who would have thought that the emperor would be even faster than him?</p>
<p>He was also a man. Naturally, he would understand the look in the emperor’s eyes as he held Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan cast a heavy glance on Mo Huaide. “Round up everyone who had just gotten near the Princess, and send them in for an interrogation. Find out what truly happened. The penalty for endangering the life of the princess is death.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, how could you round up everyone? No one wanted the accident today,” Prince Shun immediately said.</p>
<p>“Prince Shun thinks this was an accident?” Mo Rongzhan looked at him flatly, his eyes as cold as frost.</p>
<p>The eighth prince felt a cold shiver run through his back. “This… Could it not be an accident?”</p>
<p>“An accident or not, everything will be clear after an investigation. What are you afraid of?” Mo Rongzhan asked with a cold laugh.</p>
<p>The empress dowager didn’t look too happy either. Just a polo match and her youngest son had been injured, while the princess had almost been severely hurt. How could this issue just simply be resolved?</p>
<p>There had been two people next to Ye Zhen right then. One was Mo Huaide and the other one of their teammates. The subject of their interrogation was obvious, but, for the purpose of justice, both were taken away.</p>
<p>Mo Huaide’s face was startled pale, he continually shot backward glances at Prince Shun, hoping he would beg for mercy on his behalf. Unfortunately, the eighth prince had been subdued by Mo Rongzhan’s imposing aura, unable to open his mouth, fearing he might get entangled in the matter as well.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Your Majesty, have mercy. My son would never harm the princess.” Mo Huaide’s father, the Marquis Xinyang, fell to the ground, begging for mercy.</p>
<p>“Marquis Xinyang, if your son is innocent, I will naturally let him go. If he is really guilty of harming the princess, letting the rest of your family free is already mercy I have bestowed upon your age,” Mo Rongzhan said coldly.</p>
<p>Marquis Xinyang shook like a sifter. He was well aware of the fact that the spooked horse had something to do with his son, but to give up the entirety of his family for the sake of his son would be…</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had already quietly gone back to change back into female clothing, returning to the empress dowager’s side.</p>
<p>The empress dowager lightly held her hand, patting it. “You are so naughty. If it hadn’t been for your imperial brother, your injuries might have been even worse than A’Yi’s today.”</p>
<p>Because she was a little far from where they were, and the empress dowager didn’t have Tang Zhen’s eyesight, she was unable to see the panic and worry on Mo Rongzhan’s face. She only thought that the emperor had saved her because she was his imperial sister.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to stand up for A’Yi.” Ye Zhen said, “They are bullies.”</p>
<p>“They cannot be arrogant for long.” The empress dowager quietly remarked. She was well aware of the fact that the branches of the imperial family looked down on her birth, and felt that the emperor was not of righteous blood, so they always made problems behind the scenes. She believed her son would resolve such things eventually.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s victory was a direct proclamation towards the imperial family that the traditional Mo Family they represented had already been replaced. The emperor of the present was Mo Rongzhan, whether they would like to accept it or not.</p>
<p>Everything else had nothing to do with Ye Zhen. She held the empress dowager’s hand and went back to the Cining Palace.</p>
<p>Not long after, Mo Rongyi came back as well. Because of his win in the polo match, he looked to be pretty excited, holding Ye Zhen’s arm and incessantly saying, “Yaoyao, I didn’t know that you were so good at polo before. Did you play polo a lot before?”</p>
<p>“When we were in the border town, we played polo quite often,” Ye Zhen giggled as she spoke.</p>
<p>No matter if it was Lu Yaoyao or Ye Zhen, both had come into contact with polo from an early age. Her father had frequently taken her to compete with her brothers.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi looked at her reverently. “Yaoyao, how nice would it be if you were a boy.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knocked his head. “What, are you looking down on girls?”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean. If you were a boy, you could stay with me every day,” Mo Rongyi said.</p>
