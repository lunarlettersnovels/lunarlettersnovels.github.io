            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 221 – Filthy Kiss (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Entering the palace as a concubine can bring your family prosperity, do you not want that?” Though his tone was light, it was clear he was not letting her off.</p>
<p>“Why should I sacrifice my life for my family to attain comforts of luxury and high position? My elder brother will take the imperial examination soon. He would stand out among his peers, won’t he? My parents will not sell their daughter for their own glory.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen even omitted the respectful appellation. She wished she could hold out her hand and scratch Mo Rongzhan to death. She herself knew how she was fighting her urge.</p>
<p>Without even realizing it, her pink lips slightly pouted. An angry Ye Zhen seemed coquetry, enhancing the beauty of her originally gentle and beautiful face, her eyes vivid and radiant.</p>
<p>For a moment, Mo Rongzhan lost his mind. Before he could regain his senses, he had stooped his head and blocked the lips that dazzled his mind.</p>
<p><em>How soft! So luscious! </em></p>
<p>His pupils dilated as he tightly embraced her in his arms. He kissed her soft, supple and tender lips… as sweet as nectar… savouring every bit, making him want for more.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes flew wide open, her whole body turned stiff. She couldn’t respond to what happened at all. She was caught off guard, dazed until she felt his warm tongue slip into her mouth. She struggled hard as she hit Mo Rongzhan’s shoulder with both her hands.</p>
<p><em>What does this mean? What does he want to do?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s rage surged in her heart, but at the same time, she felt fear. <em>If Mo Rongzhan really wanted her… there was no room for her to refuse!</em></p>
<p>His arms were as sturdy as iron. No matter how much strength she exerted, she could not push him away. Unhindered, he rolled the tip of her tongue and kissed her passionately. She almost could not breathe. All she could sense was his masculine breath.</p>
<p>Tears flowed out from the corner of her eyes. When she had loved him with all her heart and soul, he did not even spare a moment to see her… not even on her deathbed. He did not even know what his wife looked like! He had disdained her, her presence… her very name!</p>
<p><em>What is he doing now?</em></p>
<p>Although she despised him now, there was no denying that he was the man who had ruled her mind, heart, and soul for many years. On the rational side was the injustice meted out to her, on the other a tender heart with unrequited love. She felt conflicted, a hint of reluctance emerged.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s tears flowed out uncontrollably. All her anguish, the feeling of being wronged, the pent up grievances… drop by drop formed a stream and trickled down her fair cheeks. And every time she thought that he had kissed Lu Wushuang, she felt nauseous.</p>
<p>He could feel something salty on his lips. It took him a while to realize it was her tears.</p>
<p>He was jolted back to his senses, realization dawned upon him. However, he had no regrets. Instead, he felt extremely right about her. He had never kissed any woman. Even Lu Wushuang, he had never kissed her so intimately.</p>
<p><em>It turned out that kissing someone indeed feels like…</em></p>
<p>When Ye Zhen noticed that he did not continue forcing himself onto her, she reflexively raised her hand and waved it heavily.</p>
<p><strong>Pa! </strong></p>
<p>A palm was clearly imprinted on the monarch’s jade-like face.</p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan, you are so disgusting!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was teeming with such fury that she forgot that she was Lu Yaoyao. She just wanted to vent her resentment and anger. How could this man do as he pleased, taking her for granted?!</p>
<p>“What did you say?” He glowered.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was slapped for the first time. With stern eyes, he gazed at the young miss who was still in his arms as if to pinch her to death the next moment. He didn’t know what came over him, but he had certainly not expected such a strong reaction from this dainty girl.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stared right at him with tears brimming in her eyes, her hands tingling with pain. The pain gradually woke her up from the memory of the past. She didn’t expect to… hit him.</p>
<p>“I said, you are disgusting.” Ye Zhen wanted to contain her emotions, but she couldn’t. Time and again this man had inflicted pain in her. He wouldn’t even let her heal!</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan turned frosty. “You say it again!” he said, clenching his teeth.</p>
<p>“Kiss…” She sniffed. “… it’s something that only lovers do. You… how can you kiss me when you’ve kissed so many women? You… You… ” The dam broke and tears burst forth.</p>
<p>If word of this matter got out, her reputation would be ruined.</p>
<p>Her red eyes incessantly watered; they were suffused with accusation, indignation, and pain… the scene gradually dispelled his anger, an unknown string in his heart tugged.</p>
<p>He spoke gently trying to soothe her. “I will make you a princess. Do not cry.”</p>
<p>And yet…</p>
<p>“Why should I compete with so many women for an old cucumber?!” An incensed Ye Zhen spat out.</p>
