            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 141 – Unspeakable Truths (2)</strong></p>
<p>With the help of what her brother had stolen, she thought that she could get the emperor’s favor. Yet recently, she gradually felt his coldness.</p>
<p><i>It’s only been a few weeks since we married! How could he shun me this fast?</i></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lu Lingzhi listened indifferently. In his mind, he believed that men were fond of new things and easily tired of old ones. What’s more, as an emperor, Mo Rongzhan had already made Lu Wushuang his highest-ranking imperial concubine. And this was all because he believed that she was the little girl who had saved him before.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, Princess Liu Hua is the daughter of Princess Royal. Empress Dowager wants her to enter the palace for the sake of her imperial reputation. Besides, Third Sister and Princess Liu Hua have no hatred and cannot do anything against you.”</p>
<p>He knew his own sister too well and would certainly not allow her to hurt Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Raising one finely painted eyebrow, Lu Wushuang squinted at him slightly. “Eldest Brother, you sound as if you are concerned about our third sister.”</p>
<p>“Since Yaoyao is our cousin, of course, I am concerned.” Lu Lingzhi answered simply.</p>
<p>“It is said that Third Sister has grown more and more beautiful in a short time. Is she now more beautiful than I am?”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang thought she was incomparable in beauty. That’s why when she heard others mention that Lu Yaoyao now bore a lotus-like beauty, she scoffed at the prevalent news and only saw it as an exaggeration.</p>
<p>“No one would be as elegant as Wang Fei.”</p>
<p>With this, a gentle smile was slowly hooked at the corners of Lu Wushuang’s lips but it faded too soon by her brother’s sudden inquiry…</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi leaned closer to his sister and spoke in a low voice that only the two of them could hear. “Have you ever heard of the emperor asking your nickname? I believe that he has doubts about you, the person who claims to have saved him.”</p>
<p>Hearing Lu Lingzhi’s words, Lu Wushuang’s face changed to cold stone before remarking shrilly. “What?!”</p>
<p>In an instant, Lu Lingzhi shot her a cold look, his mouth pursed tightly. Lu Wushuang then immediately covered her mouth and looked silently at her brother with fright.</p>
<p>After composing herself she gave sideways glances at every corner of the room they were in. The emperor’s shadow guards could be with them at the moment, just hidden behind the heavy drapes.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath…</p>
<p>And slowly, she dipped one elegant finger in a glass of water near her and wrote on the table.</p>
<p><i>“She never mentioned her nickname to you before?” </i></p>
<p><i>If she did, I would have told you a long time ago!</i></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi shook his head, exclaiming inside in frustration.</p>
<p><i>“Remember to act normally. It’s also better if you put away the jade pendant, he might ask for it.” </i>He wrote as well.</p>
<p>Reading Lu Lingzhi’s words, Lu Wushuang turned pale and blurted out. “The emperor once wanted to have a look at the jade pendant but it suddenly broke into pieces!”</p>
<p><i>Has Mo Rongzhan doubted my sister’s identity for long now? </i></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s heart was shocked but he quickly discarded the idea. He would’ve noticed it at the soonest! Nonetheless, goosebumps started to coat his skin, elicited not by the cold air but of deep trepidation.</p>
<p>He knew the emperor very well. If he sought the truth, he would never tire of chasing it. Now, his heart was filled with doubt and uncertainty and Lu Lingzhi was afraid that this wouldn’t be the case for long.</p>
<p><i>Where did the emperor see the clues?</i></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi and Lu Wushuang puzzled over at the same time. The two of them looked at each other one at a time, but they were silent and did not speak again.</p>
<p><i>“Be careful.” </i>Lu Lingzhi wrote on the table.</p>
<p>If the emperor knew that Lu Wushuang was a fraud and the late wang fei was indeed the girl whom he had been looking for a long time, he would surely understand that Ye Zhen did not commit suicide, and later on, would find out that Lu Lingzhi poisoned her.</p>
<p>Truly, this would be the fall of the Lu Family.</p>
<p>With sheer determination, Lu Wushuang’s hands clasped together, her eyes looked sullenly at the front of her. She had a hard time getting to where she was right now and had put her life on the line just to catch Mo Rongzhan’s heart. Thus, she would never let anyone take her noble status away from her!</p>
<p><i>Ye Zhen’s nickname? Will this be the very thing that would cause her and her family’s demise?</i></p>
<p>Lu Wushuang looked at Lu Lingzhi and nodded gently to him. She knew that her eldest brother would do everything for her, just like before when she asked him to end his friend’s life…</p>
<p><i>Didn’t he also acquire Ye Zhen’s most precious secret?</i> <i>Ah! There isn’t a single thing my brother can’t do!</i></p>
<p>Thinking of the woman who was no longer in the world, Lu Wushuang was filled again with a fighting spirit.</p>
<p><i>Where is the woman who was formerly praised by the whole capital now?</i></p>
<p>She had defeated her and had taken her place, she smirked. What’s even bitter was that she became a taboo in the very land she grew and everyone seemed to have forgotten her.</p>
<p><i>No matter how good-looking and talented you are, how prominent your life is, you will end up nameless upon your death. </i></p>
<p>That is, only if you don’t play the cards well, Lu Wushuang sang in her mind.</p>
