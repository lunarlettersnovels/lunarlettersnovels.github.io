            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 365 – Unconvinced</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Imperial Physician Huang stood beside Qi Jin with an expressionless face, her gaze roving across the examinees until finally stopping at Gao Xueping.</p>
<p>“Liu Chunmei, do you think she simply didn’t have enough rest and isn’t sick?” Qi Jin asked as she began to comment on each test paper. “You have taken her pulse and still felt nothing strange about it? Go back and learn how to feel the pulse first before taking this exam!”</p>
<p>That was how one person was eliminated.</p>
<p>Such a strict and direct examination method inevitably made everyone nervous. Even Ye Zhen could not help but feel a little nervous at this time.</p>
<p>Eventually, there were only six people left. Of those, only Gao Xueping and Ye Zhen’s test papers had not been checked and commented on.</p>
<p>“Gao Xueping, do you think the patient’s illness is a lung disease?” Qi Jin asked as she looked at the girl.</p>
<p>“Yes, Imperial Physician Qi. This student thinks that the patient’s cough was caused by the bad qi in her lungs as a result affecting the five internal organs.” Gao Xueping answered confidently.</p>
<p>However, instead of directly evaluating her answer as correct or wrong, Qi Jin looked at Ye Zhen and asked, “Lu Yaoyao, do you think the patient’s qi in her spleen and stomach is deficient?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bowed and said, “This student thinks that the patient should have incurred this illness during winter. First, the qi in the patient’s stomach is obstructed, affecting the spleen; this has caused bloating affecting the patient’s appetite leading to poor temper and health. The heart, liver, spleen, and lungs are all located in the center of the human body, and all of them rely on qi coming from the stomach to reach the Taiyin lung’s meridian. However, the qi in the patient’s stomach is insufficient, negatively impacting the spleen causing the skin to heat up and appear pale and sallow—”</p>
<p>Listening to Ye Zhen’s words, Qi Jin couldn’t help her reaction, letting the corner of her mouth form a slight smile.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gao Xueping’s expression was getting worse and worse. She did not think she was wrong, but she was still worried that Qi Jin would make an evaluation that favored Lu Yaoyao and declare her correct.</p>
<p>“How can you be sure that it’s a lung disease caused by insufficient qi in the stomach?” Imperial Physician Huang asked coldly.</p>
<p>Despite her coldness, Ye Zhen was still calm as she answered. “Her lungs are swollen. And from time to time, the patient also covered her stomach. Not just that, but she’s also coughing. As such, this student determines that the patient’s illness should be a lung disease caused by insufficient qi in her stomach.”</p>
<p>“Your judgement is based on a guess.” Gao Xueping quipped, still unwilling to concede.</p>
<p>“This student boldly made a guess, then carefully verified.” Ye Zhen replied with reason.</p>
<p>Qi Jin smiled at those words. “This is not a guess. You being able to notice that she is covering her stomach already proves that it’s not a mere guess. It is already at the level of minute observation.”</p>
<p>Gao Xueping’s expression suddenly changed. <em>Does this mean what Lu Yaoyao is saying is correct?</em></p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, although Lu Yaoyao’s answer is more accurate, I don’t think she is suitable to be an imperial physician,” Imperial Physician Huang said faintly.</p>
<p>Qi Jin raised her eyebrow and asked, “Why isn’t she suitable?”</p>
<p>“She is a princess, and the life of an imperial physician who is just starting her practice is not a comfortable one. Can she be like the other imperial physicians and bear hardships?” Imperial Physician Huang said blandly. After what had happened to her niece last time, she had a preconceived aversion to Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Could it be that you think because of my identity as a princess, I have the right to ignore the rules of this exam?” Ye Zhen asked with a soft voice.</p>
<p>Imperial Physician Huang only sneered and asked, “Princess, your identity is already very honorable. There is no need for you to pass the imperial physician’s exam to increase your honor. The life of an imperial physician is not as simple as you think.”</p>
<p>“How hard could it be?” Ye Zhen asked, “Now that I have decided to take the exam, I am naturally prepared to face the hardships that may come in the future. Why should you decide for me?”</p>
<p>Imperial Physician Huang once again sneered and said, “This one just doesn’t want to miss a real talent because of the princess’s momentary fun.”</p>
<p>Between Ye Zhen and Gao Xueping, there was only one person who could become an imperial physician. However, from this, it was obvious that Imperial Physician Huang preferred Gao Xueping.</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Huang, this is an exam.” Qi Jin reminded the other faintly. “You should still remember that there was a princess in the former dynasty who took part in the medical examination and went on to become an imperial physician.”</p>
<p>At this, Imperial Physician Huang curled her mouth and looked at Ye Zhen without saying a word.</p>
<p>Finally, Qi Jin announced the result of the exam. Ye Zhen won against Gao Xueping and became the imperial physician. Aside from Ye Zhen, Chen Jinru had also passed along with three other senior students.</p>
<p>Not convinced with the result Qi Jin announced, Gao Xueping boldly went forward and asked, “Imperial Physician Qi, what is the basis for this ruling? Even if I am wrong in my judgement, it is not all wrong. Is the result truly worse than the others?”</p>
<p>“Like Chen Jinru, your answer is just slightly wrong. However, you forget to put down your pride. You forget that you are going to be an imperial physician for the nobility and people of high ranks, not your servants or people of lower rank. Acting aloof and high above will not allow you to survive in the palace,” Qi Jin said.</p>
<p>Gao Xueping’s face immediately turned white and red in anger. She saw that the patient was poorly dressed, so she was sure that the patient was a commoner who came from the street. Therefore, she didn’t put down her attitude. Naturally, if she had entered the palace, she would have acted differently.</p>
<p>Qi Jin looked at her and said, “As an imperial physician, our patients are not only nobilities and high-ranking people. Moreover, in the eyes of a physician, all patients are the same.”</p>
<p>With that, Gao Xueping burst into tears. She covered her face and ran out.</p>
<p>“Being able to pass the imperial physician’s exam proves that the knowledge you have learned is sufficient for you to take on the work of an imperial physician. However, do not let yourself relax, thinking that it’s enough. All of you should still strive to learn more medical skills with increased diligence.” Qi Jin exhorted as she looked at the remaining five people present.</p>
<p>“Yes, Imperial Physician Qi!” Ye Zhen and Chen Jinru looked at each other with a smile, glad that they had finally passed the entrance examination and became genuine imperial physicians.</p>
