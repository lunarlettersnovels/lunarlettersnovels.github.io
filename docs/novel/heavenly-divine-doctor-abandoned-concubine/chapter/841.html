            <p><strong>Chapter 489 – What’s The Use?</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen walked past Mu Xue and left the Peach Blossom Spring. She wanted to find Huangfu Chen. She wanted to ask him about the misunderstanding between him and Mu Qing. She felt that she should also tell him about what happened at the iron mine today.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was able to find the iron mine. She had an inkling… <em>Perhaps Huangfu Chen also knew about it.</em></p>
<p>She came to Huangfu Chen’s courtyard. When the guards outside saw her quickly took the initiative to open the door (for her).</p>
<p>She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when she saw the man standing in the courtyard with his back to the setting sun and pruning the flowers. “Master, you seem to treat this place like Shiliwu. You still have such leisure.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to do. It’s not bad to cultivate your body and mind.” Huangfu Chen smiled faintly. “Did you go out today?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled in surprise. “Can you even calculate this?”</p>
<p>“You usually come before sunset, it’s much later today.” Huangfu Chen smiled.</p>
<p>“Master, let’s talk inside the house.” Ye Zhen pointed to the people outside. Today, she had a lot to say to Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>It had been almost half a month and Huangfu Chen still was not allowed to leave the courtyard. She was certain no one was watching him, and the conversation between them would not be overheard.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen nodded lightly and put the shears aside. He washed his hands before entering the tea room.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen followed him in. She looked at his elegant face and said, “Master, today… Zhao Tianji told me about your past.”</p>
<p>“He’s the same as before. He still can’t hold back his tongue.” Huangfu Chen smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“Do you know that Mu Qing has married his eldest brother?” Ye Zhen’s eyes looked straight at Huangfu Chen. When she said this, she saw the gentle smile on his face turn stiff, and his eyes revealed deep sorrow. It seemed he really didn’t know.</p>
<p>After a long time, Huangfu Chen asked in a hoarse voice, “She…they’ve already returned to Zhao Jia Island?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart ached for her master. She whispered, “She never left. Master, when you left Zhao Island, why didn’t you take her along? Didn’t you say that she was already your wife?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said bitterly, “Before I took her back to Zhao Jia Island, she married me… After I went to Zhao Jia Island, I found out that it was the island that my great-grandmother had ordered people to destroy. I just don’t know what method the people on the island used to repopulate the island again. Zhao Tianji asked me to take her away, he stopped his brother for me. When I went to get Mu Qing, her brother told me that she had left Zhao Jia Island to go to Spirit Snake Island to accept punishment because she had violated their rules. I left Zhao Jia Island to find her but was ambushed in Spirit Snake Island and couldn’t find her. So I returned to Zhao Jia Island. However, Zhao Mingxiao said that she wasn’t on the island, so I went everywhere to find her for a year. When I met Mo Rongzhan, he saw that I was injured and so stopped me from looking for her. Later, my aunt brought me back… to Niu Jia Village.”</p>
<p>“Master, Zhao Tianji said he went to look for you. He saw that you left a letter in which you said that you would abide by the mandate of the Huangfu family and not marry someone from Zhao Jia Island. When you left, their island was attacked. Zhao Mingxiao was seriously injured trying to save Mu Qing. She waited for you for three years, you didn’t return to look for her before she married… Zhao Mingxiao,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“She knows that I couldn’t have written that letter.” Huangfu Chen shook his head and smiled. “But she didn’t wait for me to find her, so she thought….”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen immediately said, “Master, then go and explain it to her. Are you willing?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen’s eyes were filled with sorrow. “So what if I go and find her? Can she leave Zhao Mingxiao for me?”</p>
<p>He knew all too well that when she married Zhao Mingxiao, she must have already put him down.</p>
<p><em>That’s right, Mu Qing was already married to someone else. How could she still be with Master? </em>Ye Zhen really did not know how to comfort him.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen picked up the kettle and poured two cups of tea, the tea spilled out of the cup. He smiled faintly and said, “Have some tea.”</p>
<p><em>Master is not as calm as he seems on the surface.</em> Ye Zhen sighed in her heart. “Master, don’t you want to know who caused you to have such a misunderstanding in the first place?”</p>
<p>“So what if I know?” Huangfu Chen lowered his eyes and sounded disheartened.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen snorted. “If it were me, I would definitely find this person and make him lose the most important person as well. I’ll make him live his entire life alone.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled and said, “Judging from your tone, do you have the same experience as me?”</p>
<p>“More or less.” Ye Zhen’s eyes flashed with a dark glint. Wasn’t it considered a misunderstanding between her and Mo Rongzhan? But this misunderstanding was deeper than between Huangfu Chen and Mu Qing.</p>
<p>Now, she wouldn’t let go of any of the knots to accept Mo Rongzhan even if she knew how he feels in his heart. However, his feelings were for Lu Yaoyao, not Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>He still felt that Ye Zhen was not worthy of him. In the future… If Lu Lingzhi were to find another person to replace her, would he immediately abandon her? Was she going to experience the pain of indifference again?</p>
<p>She didn’t dare or want to try, so she just wanted to run away from Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, who have you misunderstood?” Huangfu Chen looked at her bitter expression and asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>She shook her head. “Now any misunderstanding is not important.”</p>
<p>He understood her mood so he asked no more.</p>
<p>“Master, there is one more thing…,” she said softly as she thought back to the riot today in the iron mine. She then dipped her finger in the tea and wrote on the table. “There was an accident in the iron mine today, I think I saw Mo.”</p>
<p>“He’s finally here.”Huangfu Chen smiled faintly, seemingly not surprised.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled helplessly. “Sure enough, you knew about it. You do know that it concerns you.”</p>
<p>“Although there were signs on the road, it’s not obvious. There’s no one else but Ah Zhan who can get here,” he smiled and whispered.</p>
<p>“The security here is very strict, I’m afraid it’s not going to be easy….” She bit her lip, unable to fathom how he got those people to riot. If Qiu Yuan saw him, he would definitely not let him go.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen noticed her troubled face and smiled. “Don’t worry, he will be fine.”</p>
<p>”I am not worried about him,” she murmured</p>
<p>“Well, since Zhao Tianji’s illness has improved, you don’t have to take it too seriously.” He suddenly changed the topic.</p>
<p>“He….” Ye Zhen was startled but immediately understood that he must have noticed something unusual outside.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Zhao Tianji’s displeased voice came from outside. “Huangfu Chen, what do you mean?”</p>
