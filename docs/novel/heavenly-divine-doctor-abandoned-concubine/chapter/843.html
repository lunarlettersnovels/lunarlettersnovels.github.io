        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 487 – What Did He Say to You?</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen resisted the urge to ask for clarification, she glanced at the man and turned back to Qiu Yuan. “I’ve bandaged the wounds of the injured people, but I don’t have enough medicine, so you can send them some trauma medicine later.”</p>
<p>Qui Yuan glanced at the man. “Master is waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“I know.” Ye Zhen nodded and looked down at the man again.</p>
<p>The man had lowered his head when Qiu Yuan came over, and it was only when they(YZ &amp; QY) left together that he raised his head, his eyes seething at their departing backs.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty.” A man with the same plain and rough features came to his side, his lowered voice could not hide his excitement. “It’s Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Mo Rongzhan’s fists were clenched. It was her! He had just fought with all his might to control himself from holding her in his arms.</p>
<p><em>How could she be here? Who is the master? Where is Huangfu Chen?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had so many questions in his heart, he couldn’t wait to go after her and ask her a good question. But now that the iron mine riot was headed in the direction he wanted, he couldn’t let anyone discover his identity. At least, he knew she was safe and that’s enough!</p>
<p>Due to Zhao Tianji’s threat, everyone’s indignation was suppressed. No one dared to resist anymore, Qiu Yuan let everyone return to their positions to continue working.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan and Tang Zhen, with their heads lowered and a dejected look on their face, lifted the large rock.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had already walked next to the big sedan chair, she couldn’t help but glance back, but her gaze didn’t dare to linger on the man just now.</p>
<p>“Are you afraid that I will kill them?” Zhao Tianji asked coldly from the sedan chair.</p>
<p>“Killing them won’t do you any good, would you do such a stupid thing?” Ye Zhen looked back at him, her face not daring to show any excitement.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji snorted coldly. “Come up and let’s go back.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen could only lower her head and follow him up to the sedan chair.</p>
<p>“What did that man say to you just now?” Zhao Tianji sat calmly and steadily, seemingly asking in a very casual manner.</p>
<p>“Which person?” Ye Zhen asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji said indifferently, “What did he say to you when you bandaged his wounds?”</p>
<p>“There were eleven people injured in total, and each of them said a few words to me, which one do you want to hear?” Ye Zhen pouted her lips and glared at him impatiently.</p>
<p>“Hmph!” Zhao Tianji felt as if he was a bit paranoid. He thought that the man with the injured arm knew her, perhaps he just found her good looking so took a few extra glances. “I can still suppress them even if I don’t have to kill them.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled lightly. “Fortunately, you are not the ruler of a country, otherwise you would definitely be a tyrant.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji’s eyes flickered slightly. “Why can’t I be the ruler of a country?”</p>
<p>“If you were the emperor, you would kill any minister who defies your will. And the people not to your liking, you’d threaten their lives and the lives of their relatives? Aren’t you a tyrant?” Ye Zhen asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>“I can also be a benevolent ruler,” Zhao Tianji said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised an eyebrow. “Do you really want to be an emperor?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji didn’t answer her, the sedan chair kept going towards the lake, and after getting into the boat, Zhao Tianji told everyone else to follow behind in the small boat.</p>
<p>“Did Huangfu Chen really not tell you about his previous affairs?” Zhao Tianji sat behind the tea table on the boat, someone had already made tea and he was slowly sipping a cup.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was full of thoughts about the man who might be Mo Rongzhan. When she heard Zhao Tianji mention Huangfu Chen’s past, her eyes lit up slightly and she sat down across him. “Not everyone has the courage to bring up the sad things from the past, do you know what happened to my master in the past?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji lowered his head and drank his tea. He had overheard her conversation with Mu Xue before and believed she didn’t know anything. <em>Why didn’t Huangfu Chen say anything?</em> <em>He was under house arrest, and Lu Yaoyao went to see him every day. Did he really not say anything?</em></p>
<p>“Have you wronged my master before?” Ye Zhen suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“Why am I the one who has wronged him and not he who has wronged me?” Zhao Tianji retorted coldly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed. “Because my master just seems to be affectionate and righteous, and you just seem to be heartless and unrighteous. So if I were to say who owes whom, it would be you who owes my master”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji’s originally carefree mood was sparked. He coldly looked at Ye Zhen. “I want to throw you into the lake.”</p>
<p>“If I drown you’ll be an invalid for the rest of your life,” Ye Zhen replied nonchalantly.</p>
<p>If Huangfu Chen didn’t feel indebted to me, how could he be willing to be put under house arrest by me?” Zhao Tianji’s heart was itching with hatred, and when his legs were healed, he would definitely make her suffer.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said dismissively, “Even if it were me, I would not resist till I’m completely sure. Even if my master is unwilling, can he still take us away from here? As I have already said, my Master is a man of great affection and righteousness, and will not leave us behind.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji was blocked again, his anger rose. “If it weren’t for him, how could I have become what I am now? He was willing to be put under house arrest by me because of guilt.”</p>
<p>“Liar! Didn’t my master treat you in the first place? You have been practicing this internal skill for a long time, so what does it have to do with him?” Ye Zhen immediately yelled back.</p>
<p>Island Lord looked at the little girl coldly. “Back then, in order to help him and Mu Qing, I had to practice this internal skill. I almost broke off my brotherly relationship with my eldest brother because of him, and he has not returned to the island for several years. He is good, he has disappeared for several years, but now he is bringing along an exquisite* apprentice everywhere, should he not die?”</p>
<p>[*如花似玉 rú huā sì yù: delicate as a flower, refined as a precious jade (idiom); (of a woman) exquisite]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen slapped the table hard. “Nonsense! My master does not know the whereabouts of Mu Qing, all these years he has been looking for her. He still does not know that Mu Qing married your eldest brother. If he did, who know how sad he would be. If you want to blame my master, you should first find out what wrong my master did.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji’s face finally changed. “What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“In order to find Mu Qing, my master did not stay in the capital at all these past few years, and it was only later when he was seriously injured that he had to hide and heal his wounds,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>“No, it’s impossible!” Zhao Tianji shook his head. “Your master can’t be unaware, how could he not know that Mu Qing married my eldest brother? It was clearly he… It was clearly he who failed Mu Qing and she had to marry my eldest brother! ”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Zhao Tianji with clear eyes. “It seems that your misunderstanding is not small. ”</p>
<p>“Huangfu Chen really doesn’t know… Mu Qing has become my sister-in-law? Didn’t he let Mu Qing forget him, or did he let her marry my eldest brother?” Zhao Tianji murmured in a low voice.</p>
<p>“No,” Ye Zhen replied with certainty. “If my master knew, why would he have been looking for her all these years?”</p>
