            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 16 – Love Of Beauty (2)</h3>
<p>In the beginning, there was no one in the capital who could compare to the beauty of the late Wang Fei of the Qin dynasty, Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Being twins, both Ye Zhen and Lu Yaoyao were true beauties. However, over the years, Lu Yaoyao had never cared for her own appearance and had dark and rough skin. For so long, she had been careless, her appearance couldn’t be compared with the spoilt wang fei.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ye Zhen had always been fond of beauty itself. Even at a ripe age, she had meticulously paid great attention to enhancing and maintaining her appearance. Her mother’s vanity table was her most favorite.</p>
<p>Now, she found it a pity to look at her sister’s spoiled beauty.</p>
<p>But she will bring it back!</p>
<p>Beauty is a woman’s weapon. She knew this too well, so she would not let herself be ridiculed with her looks any longer.</p>
<p>Lu Jing heard Ye Zhen boasting that she was a great beauty and finally could not help but to ridicule her. She turned to see Ye Zhen’s eyes that seemed to be talking and her fine and beautiful features, though dark, still prominent. And suddenly, she could not say any more.</p>
<p><i>If Third Sister were fairer and a little plump, would she snatch all the attention?</i></p>
<p>“A few days ago, I got some clothes made for your sisters. I will have the seamstress make one for you as well. You will all be beautifully dressed on that day,” Old Madam Lu said excitedly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled in return. <i>How can one not be excited about having new clothes?</i></p>
<p>It was not until an old friend came to snatch Old Madam’s attention that the three ladies bid their goodbyes and retreated from the room. When Ye Zhen was about to proceed to Pei Shi’s courtyard, a cold voice made her halt in her steps.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, stay.”</p>
<p>It was Lu Jing, standing behind Ye Zhen tall and proud. It was as clear as water that she despised Ye Zhen, but the latter could not care more. She was reborn with a mission, an envious missus wasn’t one of her concerns!</p>
<p>She wanted to go to Pei Shi but it seemed like her plan would have to be delayed. Despite the ice-cold treatment towards her, Ye Zhen spoke in the sweetest voice she could muster.</p>
<p>“What do you want from me, Fourth Sister?”</p>
<p>Lu Jing was half a fist taller than Ye Zhen, she looked at her coldly with a condescending attitude.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, when you first came to the capital, you were ignorant of the rules here. In fact, you still are.” She released a soft chuckle, mocking Ye Zhen at her position. “It looks like we need to talk more.”</p>
<p><i>Talk?</i> The way she approached her, it sounded more like a confrontation. It’s not like raising a point at all, but a warning.</p>
<p>“Please, Fourth Sister, I do not have time for this.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you have.” Lu Jing raised her voice a little and stepped closer to Ye Zhen, refusing to let her slip through her fingers. “Third Sister is not aware of the reputation of the Academy for Women. Not anyone who has the desire to enter succeeds. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with dreaming, Sister, but make sure you know your limits. And know the people who will carry the shame of your reckless actions.”</p>
<p>“Tell me Sister, what exactly do you imply by that?” She still wore the smile on her face, not giving Lu Jing the satisfaction of seeing her affected by her words.</p>
<p>“You should consider the sacrifices of Eldest Brother. He had a hard time getting into the Ministry of War. Could an assistant minister be able to casually ignore the rules of the academy and send you in? Then not only will the Lu Family become a joke in the capital, but also the reputation of Eldest Brother will be dragged down!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was irked at the mention of Lu Lingzhi and his so-called ‘achievements’. Of course, he had worked hard for his position, killing hundreds and tricking people was a lot of work! He was now standing over the blood of numerous people! Even she had died at his hands.</p>
<p>“If that’s what Fourth Sister is worried about, I can assure her that I will not embarrass Eldest Brother.”</p>
<p>Aside from envy, Lu Jing didn’t believe she would make it. Whether Ye Zhen passes or fails, it would never be a piece of good news to her. Her success in the exam would snatch all the attention of the Lu Family from Lu Jing, failure would mean embarrassment to the whole family.</p>
<p>That’s why Lu Jing thought that it was much better if Ye Zhen would not try at all.</p>
<p>Lu Jing’s face sank. “So, you still want to go to the academy?” she asked angrily.</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t I? Fourth Sister is also in the Academy for Women, aren’t you? ” Ye Zhen looked worried for a fleeting moment.</p>
<p><i>Failure meant losing the chance to avenge herself.</i></p>
<p>“You…” Lu Jing said, her voice shaking. “Are you confident in passing the entrance examination? How much do you know about the Six Arts? Even if you use Grandmother and Eldest Brother as leverage, you can never survive the academy and become a physician. Just who do you think you are, huh, wild girl? Your ignorance will forsake the family!”</p>
<p>A raging Lu Jing had her temper to the brim and was about to attack Ye Zhen when Lu Fang stepped in and held her back.</p>
<p>If the Lu Family was involved in her downfall, why would she not dare not bring them trouble?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said lightly, “Fourth Sister, you worry too much.”</p>
