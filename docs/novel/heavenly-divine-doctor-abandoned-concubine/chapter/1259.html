<p>Over the wooden wall, there was another world outside.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen came out of the water with her eyes aglow, her lush lashes felt heavy as her sight took in the familiar scenery with awe.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the place had still not changed since her childhood memory. At five years old, she always felt wronged of her mother’s obvious neglect, she always felt unwanted. However, she did not dare to cry at home for fear that her mother would hate her even more.</p>
<p>Her father brought her here. In this very place, where no one was within earshot, only the solitude of the night, he taught her to swim and let her cry her heart out without holding back.</p>
<p>Then he told her softly that even though her mother didn’t seem to love her, her heart must not be broken. In fact, her mother loved her very much, her father used to remind her of this.</p>
<p>Every time she felt that bitter neglect, she came here and cried… Just crying out loud until she felt her grievances lifted, leaving her heart a lot lighter.</p>
<p>Then, when she returned, she was already smiling.</p>
<p>Back then, when she finished releasing all the pain she felt inside, there was always a pair of warm, big hands ready to take her home.</p>
<p>However, now, there was none anymore.</p>
<p>Through the mist, Ye Zhen squinted her eyes and tried to see through the thick fog.</p>
<p>Ah! This sight was the most magnificent. Up above the tall mountains that loomed over the springs, the moon shone proudly, painting the surrounding clouds like a splash of ink.</p>
<p>Drifting her gaze farther towards the horizon, she saw distant mountains… Or was it the clouds? From her position, she couldn’t tell anymore. Yet, she marveled at its beauty, at the sense of enigma it brought her.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by a strong sense of loneliness, grief, and melancholy, the tensions from months of living in her sister’s body suddenly poured out of her. Ye Zhen buried her face in her hands and began to cry in sorrow.</p>
<p><i>Father, I am in pain. Where are you?</i></p>
<p>She was wrong. She shouldn’t have married Mo Rongzhan for her own sake nor have even loved him! However, it was too late.</p>
<p>Now, she didn’t even know how to get her revenge. With her status as nothing, how could she avenge the death of her father and brother?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen cried for a long time. Before, when she was done crying, the grievance in her heart always disappeared. But now why couldn’t the hatred and sadness in her heart alleviate?</p>
<div data-fuse="22037344116" data-fuse-code="fuse-slot-22037344116-1" data-fuse-slot="71161633/WORD_wordexcerpt/chapter_incontent_2"></div>
<p>She raised her head, looked at the still bright moon, stretched out her arms, and swam back and forth in the hot spring pool.</p>
<p>Too immersed in her grief, it slipped from her notice that a tall figure lurking in the woods on the other side of the pool, with deep and bright eyes was staring at her.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan did not expect that he would see such a stunning woman in this mountain on a whim! Although it was dark, the moon was bright, and he was a martial arts practitioner. His eyes could see farther and more clearly than ordinary people could.</p>
<p>He was bathing in another pool and only came when he heard a woman crying.</p>
<p><i>Who is this woman?</i> <i>Did any of the officials who wanted to please him arrange her to be here at this exact time?</i></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes were slightly heavy, coldly looking at the woman swimming back and forth in the water like a mermaid.</p>
<p><i>She is weeping</i>, he thought astonishingly.</p>
<p>This was a new scheme of attracting his attention. Most of the ladies sent to him before tried to seduce him, quite desperately he might add.</p>
<p><i>Was weeping softly in front of him supposed to make him pity her? </i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, he had no mercy, even for weeping flowers.</p>
