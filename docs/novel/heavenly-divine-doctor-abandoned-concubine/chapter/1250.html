            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 77 – Injured (2)</h3>
<p>Pei Shi looked flustered while she sprinted towards her daughter.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, gathering the hem of her robes around her, broke into a dash to meet her halfway.</p>
<p>When the two finally held each other, Pei Shi laboriously breathed and yet, made great efforts in speaking.</p>
<p>“Someone… someone sent a message saying that your elder brother fell off his horse and broke his leg!”</p>
<p>“Is the injury serious?” Ye Zhen too was perturbed by the news, she didn’t have any hatred for Lu Xiangzhi and was even grateful to him for treating Lu Yaoyao well. From the bottom of her heart, she hoped he could have a good life.</p>
<p>Worry etched on her face, and the reality of her son’s injury became too overwhelming, Pei Shi’s knees crumbled beneath her all of a sudden. Luckily, Ye Zhen was there to quickly support her frame.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Yaoyao. I don’t trust your brother. I have to go and see him myself!”</p>
<p>Remembering that her <i>lingquan</i> could heal wounds, Ye Zhen immediately offered… “Mother, I’ll go with you.”</p>
<p>“All right.” Pei Shi didn’t think much and was just grateful that she would not be going alone.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan frowned at what was happening but definitely did not prevent Ye Zhen from leaving. Ye Zhen looked at her meaningfully, and she nodded as permission.</p>
<p>In order to save time, Pei Shi demanded not for a carriage, but two horses.</p>
<p>The imperial guard who came to relay the news was still waiting for her outside. By the time Pei Shi came out accompanied by a delicate little miss, his jaw dropped in surprise!</p>
<p><i>Would the miss ride at the back of his horse along with her mother? He looked around, there was not a single carriage in sight!</i></p>
<p>His confusion was cut off when the delicate miss mounted a horse without as much assistance. With that, he felt embarrassed at making such an assumption.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen rode alongside him. Looking at the surrounding scenery, she had an increasingly bad feeling.</p>
<p>This was not the way to the hunting grounds; it was a road leading towards the Chengde Mountain Villa!</p>
<p>She suddenly felt regretful that she had offered to come. <i>What if she meets Mo Rongzhan? Surely, Lu Xiangzhi would be in great care under his mother, right?</i></p>
<p>In the surge of panic, Ye Zhen desperately thought of an excuse to go back, but before she could have one, they had already arrived at the magnificent gates of the Chengde Mountain Villa.</p>
<p>Just after dismounting her horse, she saw Lu Xiangzhi stride out of the villa, totally fine…</p>
<p>“Mother, Yaoyao, why are you here?” Lu Xiangzhi was about to return to Zhuangzi to report the news but was surprised to see his mother and sister when he came out!</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stared at the arm wrapped in white cloth and the foot that walked freely. She became livid.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you break your foot?!” She uncontrollably had the urge to strangle Lu Xiangzhi right on the ground he’s standing! Turning her head to the other side, she shot daggers at the imperial guard who was now avoiding her gaze.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi was stupefied. “Eldest Brother fell off his horse to save me. His left leg is injured…”</p>
<p>Before they knew it, Pei Shi walked past Ye Zhen and hugged her son tightly before checking if he was indeed unharmed.</p>
<p>After seeing that he was fine, she let out a sigh of relief. “How is your eldest brother now? Can you take us to see him? “</p>
<p>A thousand times certain in her heart, Ye Zhen didn’t want to step foot in this place. After all, it was better for Lu Lingzhi to die! She wouldn’t have come if she had known.</p>
<p>“Yes, my eldest brother is resting. Mother, Sister, I’ll take you there,” Lu Xiangzhi said.</p>
<p>Pei Shi turned to Ye Zhen and said, “Yaoyao, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Unwilling, she whispered to Pei Shi. “Mother, why don’t I go back first? I wasn’t finished training with Teacher-“</p>
<p>“Nonsense! Your eldest brother was injured from saving your brother. Let’s go and see him.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen reluctantly followed her. “Of course, Mother…”</p>
