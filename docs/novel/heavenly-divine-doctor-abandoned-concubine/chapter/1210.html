<p>The Academy for Women covered an impressive area. Each of the different academic branches was located in different locations. It was like different academies brought together to make one big academy.</p>
<p>They arrived when the examination was about to begin. Ye Zhen let the carriage drive directly to the front gate of the School of Medicine. And when she got off, she already felt the eyes from all directions.</p>
<p>She looked up and saw Princess Liu Hua not far ahead. The princess quickly approached her with bulging eyes.</p>
<p>“Are you … are you Lu Yaoyao from Baihua Garden that day?” She asked in incredulity.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gave a courtesy. “The princess has a good memory.”</p>
<p>“Impossible! You are not Lu Yaoyao!” Princess Liu Hua lost her voice and cried out.</p>
<p><i>How can it be! That day she was certain that she ridiculed a fragile and dark-skinned wild girl! Even wearing silk and satin was not able to conceal the temperament and appearance of someone raised in the border town!</i></p>
<p><i>How did she change completely?</i></p>
<p>“It’s funny. Isn’t she Lu Yaoyao? Must this miss of the Lu Family have to answer such a stupid question?”</p>
<p>Lu Jing and Princess Liu Hua were not able to settle their differences. When they saw each other, they instinctively clashed their iron swords together.</p>
<p>Princess Liu Hua looked at Ye Zhen with jealousy. “The Princess of this country wants to see if you can enter the academy today.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded and smiled. “Thank you for your concern.”</p>
<p>“Who cares about you, bah!” Princess Liu Hua hated Ye Zhen’s calm dexterity and could only shoot hateful remarks to earn a reaction from her.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone screamed.</p>
<p>“Ghost! Ghost! “</p>
<p>Two women who had just come down from an extravagant carriage were looking for Princess Liu Hua when they caught sight of Third Miss Lu. Their faces instantly turned white and they screamed out in horror.</p>
<p>Princess Liu Hua looked back at them. “Xu Huiru, what ghost are you talking about?”</p>
<p>The screaming woman was none other than Ye Zhen’s former classmate, now a famous talented woman in the capital, Xu Huiru, daughter of Xu Xiang.</p>
<p>“You… who are you?”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru didn’t seem to hear the question from the princess and instead, looked at Ye Zhen in disbelief.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her back in bewilderment.</p>
<p>Lu Jing always liked to associate herself with noble and talented women. She was even more ingratiating with Xu Huiru. When she asked, she smiled and said, “Sister Xu! This is my third sister, Lu Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru’s face was still pale as she took in Ye Zhen’s facial features. “Lu Yaoyao? Your name is Lu Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled timidly and bowed. “Miss Xu, I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p>
<p>“You… look so much like her!” Xu Huiru muttered to herself. <i>It cannot be!</i></p>
<p>The late wang fei and Lu Yaoyao looked exactly the same that she thought she was the same person. No wonder she thought she was seeing a ghost.</p>
<p>Knowing who Xu Huiru was talking about, Ye Zhen still asked doubtfully. “Miss Xu, who are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru quickly shook her head, realizing her mistake. “No one! I didn’t say anything!”</p>
<p>Now mentioning that person’s name was almost a taboo in the capital, no one dared to do so, as they believed it would bring them bad luck. Xu Huiru was not a fool, there was no way she would mention Ye Zhen’s name here.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded and glanced back at her sisters. “The examination time is nearing; I must go and sign my name on the list first.”</p>
<p>Chen Qiuping took Ye Zhen’s hand. “Yaoyao, don’t be afraid of what others will think of you, just do your best.”</p>
<p>“Mmm.” Ye Zhen gratefully smiled. “I think I can pass the exam.”</p>
<p>Having heard this, Princess Liu Hua smiled contemptuously. “Can an academy entrance exam be passed by a person who has only read <i>The Thousand Character Classic</i>–a children’s book? Are you as blind as your teacher?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen grinned and said, “Sister, teachers are naturally bole<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>.”</p>
<p><i>And Boles are meant to find a fine steed, Ye Zhen wanted to add.</i></p>
