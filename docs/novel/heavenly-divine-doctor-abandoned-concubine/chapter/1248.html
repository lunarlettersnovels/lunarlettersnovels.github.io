<p>Hiding the satisfaction in her face, Ye Zhen kept her head bowed while timidly inching closer to Pei Shi, in a low voice she said, “Mother, I must return…”</p>
<p>While these happened, Lu Lingzi silently lamented at the fact that his third sister was as cold as ice to him. Since entering the door, she had not paid a glance towards his way.</p>
<p><i>Was she still angry with him just because he didn’t agree with her in her plan to go to the Academy for Women before? Did his third sister hate him just because of this trivial argument?</i></p>
<p>On the contrary, Pei Shi didn’t find Ye Zhen’s attitude towards Lu Lingzhi strange. She only thought that her daughter still wasn’t familiar with her eldest brother, so his injury didn’t perturb her one bit.</p>
<p>With gratitude in her eyes, she nodded at Tang Zhen then held her daughter’s hand, before saying, “Well then, I’ll have the marquis accompany you to the Zhuangzi Hot Springs.”</p>
<p>“Third Madam Lu, don’t worry, I will take her home safely.”</p>
<p>“Mother, I’ll accompany Yaoyao out.” Lu Xiangzhi graciously offered.</p>
<p>Totally delighted, Tang Zhen was grinning like a fool in the corner when Lu Lingzhi’s warning stare sliced through him like a sword, quickly wiping his smile off of his face.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen said politely to Ye Zhen, “Third Sister, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen couldn’t wait to leave this terrible place, she heard his words and immediately went out, as if there were evil spirits chasing her!</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, why the rush?” Lu Xiangzhi caught up with her and held out his unharmed hand.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you show concern about Eldest Brother’s injury?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I care! It’s just that Mother is already there to ask if he was feeling okay. I have nothing to ask, so I haven’t asked,” Ye Zhen said with clear and innocent eyes.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi frowned. He had always felt that his sister, even though congenial to everyone, was specifically cold to their eldest brother.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen only looked at them from behind, still beaming from ear to ear. In his eyes, he only saw Ye Zhen whom he thought looked good in everything she wore, even her voice sounded heavenly to him.</p>
<p>“We’ll talk when I get back.” Lu Xiangzhi muttered, seeing that this was really not the place to talk about his sister’s inexplicable apathy.</p>
<p>Slowing in her steps, Ye Zhen showed a sweet smile, the corners of her eyes crinkled mirthfully. “Brother, you must not think too much, you should recuperate and get better! Your hand injury, is it serious or not? Let me have a look! “</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Lu Xiangzhi showed his injured hand wrapped in a bandage. “It’s just a scratch from a rough stone. No more than a bruise, really. There’s nothing to be worried about.”</p>
<p>With haste, Ye Zhen took a bottle of laudanum from her pocket – she had added several drops of the<i> lingquan </i>to it before they went into the villa! With just a drop, she was certain that Lu Xiangzhi would feel better by morning.</p>
<p>“I brought it from home. You should use it when changing bandages tonight.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for that. The emperor has given a medicine that is definitely better than ours,” Lu Xiangzhi said reassuringly.</p>
<p>“Do you despise my medicine?” Ye Zhen unjustly gaped at Lu Xiangzhi, her eyes starting to well up with tears.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi was most afraid of seeing his sister drop the golden beans! He was always scolded for it since he was little.</p>
<p>“Hey, I didn’t say that. I’ll use your medicine tonight. Is that okay?” He took back his words and rubbed his head anxiously.</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate the medicine I have prepared. It is definitely better than what the emperor has given you.” She handed the bottle to Lu Xiangzhi who accepted it willingly.</p>
<p>“Well, we are indeed the best.” Lu Xiangzhi laughed.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen looked at Lu Xiangzhi with great envy. In his mind, if the third sister had specially prepared a medicine for him, he would surely carry it with him every day! He was in his own bubble of happiness, knowing that Ye Zhen’s trip back to the hot springs was trusted under his care.</p>
<p>Before they could get through the villa’s gate, Ye Zhen suddenly halted in her steps, remembering something.</p>
<p>“Brother, tell me, how did your horse suddenly lose control?”</p>
