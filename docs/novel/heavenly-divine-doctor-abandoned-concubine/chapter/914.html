            <p><strong>Chapter 415 – Come Here, Yaoyao</strong></p>
<p>Just after running out of the Palace of Heavenly Purity, she saw Lady Cheng walking over at the side of Empress Dowager.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, the emperor is awake,” Ye Zhen walked over, quietly and said to the empress dowager.</p>
<p>A look of delight appeared on the empress dowager’s face. “Really?!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen firmly nodded her head, “Really, Imperial Mother. Go have a look.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan waking up was good news for everyone. He had already skipped two sessions of morning court, and there were already officials speculating if he had contracted some sudden illness. Every day, there were officials entering the palace asking to see him, and though they were stopped by the empress dowager, it was impossible to stop them from speculating.</p>
<p>The most aggravating of them all was the fifth and eighth princes. On the pretext of wanting to see the emperor, they had barged into the Palace of Heavenly Purity several times. Fortunately, General Wei You was present and had stopped them in their tracks.</p>
<p>Although everything looked calm and collected, there were still people spreading rumors in the capital that the emperor was about to pass, making the city anxious.</p>
<p>However, now that Mo Rongzhan was awake, everything would probably change.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen followed the empress dowager into the Palace of Heavenly Purity, Mo Rongzhan had already been helped up by Eunuch Fu. There were maids at his side helping him wash his face and rinse his mouth.</p>
<p>“A’Zhan!” Seeing her son finally awake, the empress dowager rushed over in a flurry, looking at him with teary eyes. “Everything’s fine now that you’re awake. Everything’s fine now.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan lightly smiled. “Imperial Mother, I’ve made you worry.”</p>
<p>By now, Mo Rongyi had arrived as well. Everyone circled Mo Rongzhan. Huangfu Chen and Qi Jin examined his wounds again, changing the bandages.</p>
<p>After a while, Tang Zhen walked in.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen reckoned she was no longer needed. Mo Rongzhan had woken up, and she could rest assured now, no longer needing to harbor regret for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Just as she prepared to leave quietly, Huangfu Chen broke his silence.</p>
<p>“The Emperor has just awakened and needs to rest. Let’s put everything on hold.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager immediately said, “That’s right. Let the emperor rest. Don’t speak to him about the trivial matters from outside.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan frowned, his handsome face cold. “What happened outside?”</p>
<p>“No matter what, it’ll need to wait until you’re well to be addressed,” Empress Dowager said, raising her eyes to look at Tang Zhen and the others.</p>
<p>Marquis Jing Ning had wanted to report the results of the investigation at the hunting forest, but there were too many people here, and it wasn’t the time for this. He could only wait until a later time to come see the emperor.</p>
<p>“Imperial Brother, I’m sorry. It was all me… If I hadn’t wanted to go hunting, nothing would have happened to you,” eyes red, a heart full of guilt, Mo Rongyi said to Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“How could this be your fault? Don’t think too much,” Mo Rongzhan said lightly with a smile, rubbing his forehead a bit tiredly.</p>
<p>The empress dowager noticed that his complexion had yet to recover, and felt sorry for him who was in a weak condition from just waking up. She said to the others, “Let the emperor rest.”</p>
<p>Seeing Mo Rongzhan’s apparent exhaustion, and his unwillingness to speak, everyone withdrew. Mo Rongzhan didn’t ask Tang Zhen about the results of the investigation, nor did he ask about what had happened these past two days. After all, whatever he wanted to know, he could know at any time.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wanted to leave with them, but before she could get to the door, Mo Rongzhan had already flatly spoken, “Yaoyao, stay here.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen lightly smiled. “That’s right. The emperor needs an imperial physician (female) here to monitor his condition. Yaoyao, if you feel tired, I’ll have someone else come.”</p>
<p>Just as Ye Zhen was about to ask for another physician (female) to come in to take care of the emperor, she heard Mo Rongzhan coldly state, “I can’t trust anyone else.”</p>
<p>The meaning was very clear. He wanted Ye Zhen to stay.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at Ye Zhen gently. He knew what Mo Rongzhan wanted, but he wouldn’t force it upon this little girl.</p>
<p>“Mister Chen, then I’ll take care of the emperor,” Ye Zhen said quietly. She’ll treat this as an opportunity to pay back this favor.</p>
<p>The empress dowager smiled and said, “I’ll invite Court Minister Xu and Liu Zongyuan into the palace, and tell them about this news. No matter what, we must stabilize the matters of the inner court.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan lightly nodded. He was very aware of the fact that, during the time of his unconsciousness, there must have been many things that happened in the palace. He had been crowned for not even a year. No matter if it was the imperial branches or the noble families, he had yet to gain their fealty. If news really spread that something had happened to him, a great shock would most definitely arise.</p>
<p>Naturally, he believed that the empress dowager would have everyone conceal the news of his injury. However, he had nevertheless skipped two sessions of the morning court. Those harboring such intents would naturally use this matter to spread rumors against him.</p>
<p>“How are you?” Ye Zhen saw that he had closed his eyes and remained silent, seemingly thinking about something. She thought that he was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan opened a pair of bright and serene eyes, fixating on her. “Who has come to see me these past days?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said, “There were many people who have wanted to come see you. The court officials of the inner court, the fifth prince and the eighth prince… and the other court officials who heard about your injury, and the consorts of your harem.”</p>
<p>“Have you been watching over me the whole time these two days?” Mo Rongzhan asked again.</p>
