            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 163 – Her Pretend Coyness</strong></p>
<p>In the main hall, Princess Royal and Liu Hua hadn’t left yet. They were talking to the empress dowager, ignoring Old Madam Lu beside them. The empress dowager had taken the initiative to speak to Old Madam Lu several times as she had no intention to snub her. However, Princess Royal’s’ heart became more and more displeased as seconds passed by. Therefore, she began to talk with thorns unabashedly.</p>
<p>“Old Madam Lu is very lucky. It’s not easy to raise granddaughters. Whether it’s Wang Fei or Lu Yaoyao, both have a good upbringing. You have done well, Old Madam Lu.” The empress dowager praised the old madam sincerely.</p>
<p>This earned a soft sneer from the princess royal. Her face became gloomier than when she had entered.</p>
<p>“When can the misses of our family compare with those from noble families? It’s just that my granddaughters work a little harder than others, especially in their education. Their hard work and talents also protect them from those who oppress them.”</p>
<p><i>Bullocks! </i>Liu Hua exclaimed in her mind. <i>Lu Yaoyao must have done something to earn entry into the Academy for Women! </i></p>
<p>Princess Liu Hua badly wanted to hit Lu Yaoyao. She was humiliated because of her. Not only that, but she had also lost a fortune!</p>
<p>On the other hand, Princess Royal felt a stabbing pain in her heart. Old Madam Lu was certainly pertaining to her daughter, who oppressed Lu Yaoyao during the examination at the academy. At the thought of tens of thousands of silvers that her daughter had lost recently, her heart trembled in anger.</p>
<p>“Your granddaughter is indeed a merchant’s daughter, who loves to take the silvers of others cunningly.” She snorted.</p>
<p>Immediately, the empress dowager’s face sank. “That’s enough! Princess Royal, what is the matter with you today? Why did you come to Cining Palace?“</p>
<p>The princess royal’s cold gaze darted towards the empress dowager. <i>Am I prohibited from entering this palace? I am more entitled than you are!</i></p>
<p>Deep inside her, she still despised the empress dowager because of her origin. She was not born of a noble bloodline. <i>No wonder, she gets along with Old Madam Lu so well!</i></p>
<p>However, she was the biological mother of the emperor and had to pay respect to her. Even so, everyone could see that she didn’t have any.</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager, when will you arrange my daughter’s marriage to the emperor? You are taking too much time.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was dumbfounded as she listened to Princess Royal’s tone. <i>She had no respect for the empress dowager. What was her status that she could casually demand something from the empress dowager?</i></p>
<p>The empress dowager addressed her calmly. “Aijia has already told the emperor. It’s all up to His Majesty now.”</p>
<p>Liu Hua, who was standing behind her mother, bit her lip with some injustice.</p>
<p>She liked the emperor as early as a few years ago, but for Ye Zhen’s interference in their lives, she was forced to remain a princess for a while.</p>
<p>Princess Royal frowned, she wanted the empress dowager to urge the emperor again. She was about to raise her request when she saw Aunt Cheng appear with Ye Zhen in tow.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Aunt Cheng bring Ye Zhen back, the empress dowager showed a tender smile on her face. But upon becoming aware of the red and swollen face of the miss, her eyes flashed with anger.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu also saw the palm print, which was haphazardly concealed with rouge. She appeared calm and serene, but her heart was already in a fury. She didn’t need to ask anyone who did this to Lu Yaoyao. Lu Wushuang ran out in a hurry and must have gone to her.</p>
<p><i>Did Yaoyao really do something to displease the wang fei? </i></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu believed that Lu Yaoyao would not do anything out of line, and Wang Fei should not have hurt Lu Yaoyao for no reason! The more she thought about it, the more upset she felt.</p>
<p>When Princess Royal saw Ye Zhen’s appearance, she covered her mouth with her long sleeves and laughed aloud. “What’s wrong with Third Miss Lu’s face? She was fine when I left her. How could she be beaten like this when I turned around?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Princess Royal in confusion and asked naively, “Princess Royal, what’s wrong with my face? Did I not apply the rouge evenly? “</p>
<p>“Third Miss Lu, you didn’t let me put on the rouge for you. Your face is still visibly swollen.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen faked a gasp and touched her cheek immediately.</p>
<p>“Aunt Cheng, you didn’t inform me. You said I don’t look ugly.” Cried Ye Zhen, and buried her face in her hands with pretense coyness.</p>
<p>Seeing her dispirited, the empress dowager laughed and waved her hand. “Let Aijia see if it’s indeed ugly.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stepped forward gracefully and exposed her cheek. “Look, Empress Dowager.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not ugly. Who dares to say that you are ugly?” The empress dowager made no secret of her adoration for Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>When Princess Royal and Liu Hua saw this scene, their faces became livid. They did not know that the empress dowager would treat Lu Yaoyao so well.</p>
<p><i>Doesn’t the empress dowager know that this Lu Yaoyao recently let Liu Hua lose face? What is the meaning of her actions? Does she favor an outsider more than Princess Royal Chief princess and her daughter?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled in gratitude.</p>
<p>“Has the little prince taken his medicine?” asked the empress dowager.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, the little prince took the medicine I gave him.” Ye Zhen remembered that Mo Rongzhan asked her to treat the little prince. She already knew what to prescribe. How should she tell this to the empress dowager without her making any presumptions?</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng leaned forward and whispered a few words into her mistress’ ear.</p>
<p>The empress dowager looked at Ye Zhen in surprise and asked softly, “The emperor wants you to treat the little prince?”</p>
