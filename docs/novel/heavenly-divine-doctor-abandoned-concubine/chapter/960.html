            <p><strong>Chapter 369 – Crazy Horse on the Field (2)</strong></p>
<p>Due to this, that old <em>wangye </em>asked him to hurt Mo Rongyi, and he complied. In any event, they could not let Mo Rongyi win the game, so hurting him was fine in Prince Shun’s opinion.</p>
<p>“Make the kid leading that team drop dead!” Prince Shun ordered Mo Huaide in a low tone.</p>
<p>“Leave it to me, Eighth Brother!” Mo Huaide let out a burst of malicious laughter and said, “I’m sure I can make his horse go out of control without his notice.”</p>
<p>At this time, the game had resumed, and they quickly reconvened. However, this time, Ye Zhen had changed her strategy. Instead of grabbing the ball and attacking directly, she had chosen to assist others by grabbing the ball and hitting it towards her team members.</p>
<p>She turned her body, moving her arms aslant the horse’s stomach. Handling the ball in hand, she shot it towards the goal as if it was a deity’s pearl descending onto the earth at lightning speed!</p>
<p>All the while, Mo Rongzhan’s eyes remained fixed on Ye Zhen’s figure on the field. He was absolutely unable to shift his gaze elsewhere, and his mind came up with a few verses to praise her. <em>How did she always manage to surprise him?</em> The last time, he had thought he had seen everything about her superb horsemanship, but today he found out that the real her was more dazzling than what he had known.</p>
<p>She was so beautiful that he felt… A rush of excitement coming over him. All of a sudden, he had an impulse to hide her away lest other men discover her beauty and exquisiteness.</p>
<p>At the same time, standing by the side, Tang Zhen was also staring at Ye Zhen blankly in awe. Like Mo Rongzhan, he had also managed to recognize Ye Zhen at a glance. And right then, his handsome face had reddened in excitement, wishing that he could just go to the field right then and there to fight shoulder to shoulder with her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen snatched the <em>Qibao</em> ball and immediately threw it toward the striker. At that moment, Prince Shun suddenly jumped out, his moon staff ready to strike. He was striving and fighting for the ball fiercely. Soon, the two, who had just locked in a fierce fight, parted ways.</p>
<p>Soon, Prince Shun was pushed away by Ye Zhen, who had come forward to assist the striker. Immediately after that, the striker sent the <em>Qibao</em> ball out and hit the goal smoothly.</p>
<p><em>Very good, we manage to turn the tide!</em></p>
<p>“Everybody, defend!” Ye Zhen shouted, voice louder than necessary.</p>
<p>At that moment, Prince Shun threw a meaningful glance at Mo Huaide. Receiving the signal, Mo Huaide nodded his head gently, and slowly approached Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Protect the ball!” Prince Shun ordered as he held the staff and rushed towards Ye Zhen and her team.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was so absorbed with her defense that she failed to notice all those near her. However, all of a sudden, her steed hissed like a runaway wild horse. It was jumping wildly, trying to throw her off its back.</p>
<p>“AH!” Ye Zhen exclaimed, tightly grasping the reins in her hands as she tried to control the crazy horse. Despite the frenzy, she still managed to spot Mo Huaide’s figure nearby, so she immediately knew that someone had tampered with her horse.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao!” As soon as Mo Rongzhan saw her horse was out of control, his heart instantly leapt to his throat. Before anyone else could react, he had already exerted his <em>qinggong </em>to the fullest extent and arrived at the field within a few breaths. And shortly before Ye Zhen was to get thrown off by the horse, he had already hugged her to him, firmly seating both of them on top of the horse again.</p>
<p>At this time, Ye Zhen did not bother to push Mo Rongzhan away. After all, her feet were clamping the horse tightly in order to try to calm the animal, so she couldn’t get dismount at all. “Someone tampered with the horse, startling it until it acts like this.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan put his arms around her and tried to control the crazy horse for her, but even he could not calm the mad horse down.</p>
<p>By this point, the game had been terminated, and everyone had run over. However, they didn’t know how to help Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, sit tight.” Mo Rongzhan whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t have the time to say anything before he clasped her waist with one hand, and used a heavy force to chop the horse’s head with the other, directly rendering it unconscious.</p>
<p>The horse fell first on its front knees, freeing Ye Zhen’s legs in the process. Despite that though, she was still carried off the horse by Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>Everybody was relieved.</p>
<p>Oh, make no mistake, some people DID feel sorry that the crazy horse did not manage to hurt Mo Rongzhan and was controlled in the end. How could they not? After all, in their mind, if it could cause Mo Rongzhan a serious injury, then… that would be good.</p>
