            <p><strong>Chapter 438 – As Expected, She’s Jealous (2)</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> doesn’t know. With your father’s remarkable abilities, <em>zhen </em>can’t say for sure where, but it is possible that he is alive and living well,” he said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyebrows furrowed and she said nothing. She had her own ideas about her father’s whereabouts, and as such had asked Man Qin to find him. However, there had been no news thus far.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, have you met Ye Yiqing?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No,” she replied decisively, Lu Yaoyao had never seen anyone in the Ye family except a few.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan glanced at her and was about to ask whether Ye Yiqing or the Lu family were important to her when Eunuch Fu’s voice drifted from outside.</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager, Xianfei.” Fude knelt and bowed loudly, trying to alert the two masters in the chamber unsure if they were still being intimate right now or not.</p>
<p>The empress dowager frowned and looked at Eunuch Fu. “What are you doing? Why are you standing here and not attending to the emperor inside?”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru smiled and asked, “Is there someone else in there?”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Eunuch Fu to answer, the empress dowager had already entered the chamber hall.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother?” Ye Zhen, who was sitting next to the small side table, raised her head and looked at the empress dowager in surprise. “Are you here to check on His Majesty?”</p>
<p>The empress dowager was very surprised. “Yaoyao, it turns out that you were in the palace today,  while <em>ajia</em> thought you were at home. What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at Mo Rongzhan who was pretending to be asleep on the bed and answered with a smile. “Mister Chen removed the stitches from the emperor’s wound today. ”</p>
<p>“Really?” The empress dowager walked towards the bed in incredulity. “What kind of medicine did Mister Chen use so that the emperor’s injuries healed so quickly?”</p>
<p>“Mister Chen is very powerful.” Ye Zhen smiled, noticing Xu Huiru’s inquisitive eyes, and turned her head to look at the other. “Xianfei, what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru said with a smile, “The emperor was able to heal so quickly, it was all thanks to Yaoyao’s careful care.”</p>
<p>“How can that be? Wasn’t it Xianfei who was taking care of the emperor yesterday? I think this is due to Xianfei’s meritorious service,” Ye Zhen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan, who was lying on the bed, secretly felt amused. <em>This little girl had dared to say that she was not jealous, but it is obvious that she really was jealous because Xu Huiru stayed behind.</em></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, when did the emperor fall asleep?” The empress dowager hadn’t noticed Xu Huiru’s attempt to probe at Lu Yaoyao. She was more worried about when Mo Rongzhan would wake up.</p>
<p>“The emperor has already been asleep for a while. He should be waking up soon.” Ye Zhen said, “Imperial Mother, I will go and boil the medicine for His Majesty first. He should drink it as soon as he wakes up.”</p>
<p><em>Anyway, Xu Huiru is here, he shouldn’t need her to look after him.</em></p>
<p>Hearing that Ye Zhen was about to leave, Mo Rongzhan immediately opened his eyes. “Imperial Mother?”</p>
<p>The empress dowager was happy. “Your Majesty, are you awake? How do you feel now?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s dark eyes looked at Ye Zhen’s face, the look in them spoke of many warnings. “Imperial Mother, don’t worry. I’m already fine.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru took two steps forward, blocking Lu Yaoyao behind her. “Your Majesty, I am very happy to see that you are in better spirits today.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, Brother Emperor, I will go and boil the medicine first,” Ye Zhen said with a smile, and before the emperor could object, she had already walked out of the chamber hall briskly.</p>
<p>The expression on Mo Rongzhan’s face was a little heavy.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru had been observing him all this time, not letting go of any subtle changes on his face. The closer she looked, the more her heart sank.</p>
<p>As expected, she was right. The emperor’s relationship with Lu Yaoyao was not just that of a brother and sister. The manner in which he looked at her… was that of a man looking at another woman.</p>
<p><em>What about Lu Yaoyao? What did she think about the emperor?</em></p>
<p><em>If Lu Yaoyao ceased to be a princess, and with her standing in the eyes of the empress dowager, and attracting the emperor in this way, might it be possible for her to become the empress?</em></p>
<p><em>No! No! </em> Xu Huiru shook her head vigorously in her heart, she would never let Lu Yaoyao have the chance to enter the Eastern Palace.</p>
<p>“Xianfei Xu? Why do you look distracted?” The empress dowager called out to Xu Huiru several times. <em>What is this child doing? She is usually quite quick-witted but today, she has become dumbfounded in front of the emperor.</em></p>
<p>Xu Huiru smiled reluctantly. “Empress Dowager, this concubine forgot her manners. It was just that the more this concubine looked at the princess, the more this concubine seemed to recall a certain person, who used to look somewhat similar to the princess. That’s why this concubine was lost in thought.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager knew who Lu Yaoyao looked like. Hearing Xu Huiru’s words, she wondered if she was thinking of Ye Zhen. “People are often similar. It’s normal.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan knew that Xu Huiru had raised the matter deliberately and asked indifferently, “Who do you think Yaoyao looks like?”</p>
