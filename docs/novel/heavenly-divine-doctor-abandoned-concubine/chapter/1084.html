            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 245 – Farewell Dinner (1)</strong></p>
<p>A pair of exquisite beauties sat opposite one another as the kettle on the stove table whistled on. The master and the pupil gazed at each other seemingly engaged in a tacit conversation. None was in a hurry to breach the serene silence, even if their were hearts aflutter.</p>
<p>While few knew a palace eunuch accompanied Ye Zhen one afternoon, it did not escape Teacher Shan’s ever-discerning eye that her disciple had not returned to the academy from the medicinal field that day.</p>
<p>She even knew that it was His Majesty the Emperor’s right-hand man, Eunuch Fu, who had been tasked with the job. This went on to show, Ye Zhen, in the imperial eyes, was no ordinary maiden. Especially Mo Rongzhan, he seemed to view her in a different light.</p>
<p>The glaring similarities between the late wang fei and Lu Yaoyao, Teacher Shan wondered if there were others who had noticed it. However, she was certain Mo Rongzhan was in the dark. Had he known, he would be sure to never cross paths with her. And since nothing untoward had befallen the girl, it solidified her conjecture.</p>
<p>But this was true of the emperor, not those around him. How could she have escaped the many curious eyes in the palace? Would they not have spotted the resemblance? And what would they think … that the emperor summoned the late wang fei’s look alike?</p>
<p><em>But what was it for?</em></p>
<p>When Teacher Shan had accepted the girl as her pupil, she was only going through the motions of being a filial disciple to her own master. It would be a lie to say she wasn’t swayed, towards the fulfillment of her deepest, scorching desire to avenge her deceased student, when she had first laid eyes on the girl. In fact, it was this hope that Lu Yaoyao could avenge Ye Zhen that stimulated her enthusiasm. To her, the existence of this girl was the will of the heavens, which she believed was not impossible.</p>
<p>“Teacher, when I entered the palace, I met the emperor,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>She wasn’t forthcoming about the matters that had transpired in the imperial study. She didn’t want her teacher to think, and be alarmed, that she was treading the forbidden path yet again. More so, it was because her subconscious mind wanted to forget everything Mo Rongzhan had done to her as if it had not happened at all.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan’s solemn gaze was scrutinizing her every reaction. “Yaoyao,” she said, “Mo Rongzhan is not a person who can be provoked casually. Some people may seem magnificent and grand on the surface, but only they know of the hardships they experience on the inside.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled as she nodded. “Teacher, I only went to the palace to see Little Prince at that time. It had nothing to do with him.”</p>
<p>She tried her best to allay her teacher’s worries. If only she could, she wanted to tell her who she was and why she would not have anything to do with that man in this lifetime.</p>
<p>“If you can make Mo Rongzhan treat you sincerely, things will be different.” Teacher Shan smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Deep in her heart, she nurtured the hope for Lu Yaoyao to win Mo Rongzhan’s unparalleled attention, to become his favorite consort, for Lu Wushuang to fall out of favour … for only this way would it be easier to avenge. After all, the most ruthless betrayal came from those closest.</p>
<p>If she was shocked at the words, Ye Zhen adeptly concealed it. “Teacher, you’re joking.”</p>
<p><em>How could she let Mo Rongzhan treat her sincerely? That man’s whole world revolved only around himself. There was no space for anyone in his heart!</em></p>
<p>“I’m just saying.” Teacher Shan didn’t say anything further. She had a vague premonition that Lu Yaoyao would surely attract Mo Rongzhan’s attention. As such, she would let things take their course.</p>
<p>“Teacher, what would you like to tell me?” Ye Zhen asked, steering the topic away from Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“What I’m about to say is just a guess and not necessarily true … even so, I don’t think there are so many coincidences in the world. You and Ye Zhen look very much alike. When I saw you, I thought I saw her.” Teacher Shan looked in the girl’s eyes.</p>
<p>Little by little, as time went by, the young lady before her eyes had broken away from her dark and thin appearance … seeming more and more like the noble lady.</p>
<p><em>Lu Yaoyao’s demeanor definitely resembles Ye Zhen’s.</em></p>
<p>When Ye Zhen heard Teacher Shan’s words, her heart stilled. Somewhere within a knot tugged hard, she inwardly winced but held her silence.</p>
<p>“Teacher, having a resemblance to others … perhaps it’s just a coincidence.”</p>
<p>“There are not so many coincidences in this world.” Teacher Shan immediately dismissed her words. “The reason why I became Ye Zhen’s teacher was because I was ordered to and that I will likely be a private tutor to you at the Lu Mansion was also explained to me by this man. Is this also a coincidence?” Teacher Shan asked.</p>
<p>“Who is that man?” Ye Zhen sat up straight.</p>
<p><em>Besides Father and Grandmother, who else knows that we’re sisters?</em></p>
