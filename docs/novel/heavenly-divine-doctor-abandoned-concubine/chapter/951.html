            <p><strong>Chapter 378 – Medical Examination</strong></p>
<p>Imperial Physician Huang coldly snorted before saying, “There is no Princess amongst the imperial physicians of the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard. If she wants to be a princess, she can go to the Imperial Palace. Inside the Imperial Physicans’ Courtyard, there are only physicians and imperial physicians.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that she had offended Imperial Physician Huang when she had had Huang Fuxiang expelled from school before. As she was an imperial physician now, the other would definitely not let her go so easily.</p>
<p>She slightly bowed. “Imperial Physician Huang is right, there is no Princess here.”</p>
<p>Imperial Physician Huang hadn’t thought that Ye Zhen would be able to put down her pride before her, and leave her with no faults to pick at. She coldly snorted, then turned and left.</p>
<p>After the medical supervisors examined her body, Ye Zhen and the rest of the girls were taken to the  Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard. In the coming days, they would still need to study with the physicians and doctors. If there were titled women outside the palace who were sick and wouldn’t be able to be examined by male imperial physicians, the female physicians would go to diagnose the disease, and the imperial doctors would prescribe the medicine.</p>
<p>The chief of the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard was a middle-aged man sporting a beard, seemingly benevolent and kind and surnamed Gong. There was also a Head Physician, Qi Jin, and two imperial physicians. Apart from Imperial Physician Huang, there was also a male imperial physician. In the palace, only physicians ranked imperial physician or higher could treat the empress dowager and the emperor. The rest of the ten some imperial physicians were there to treat and diagnose the members of the inner palace, or any titled individuals that would require them leave the palace for an examination.</p>
<p>Apart from the newly arrived quintet (including Ye Zhen), there were also ten female physicians, picked from the past two years. This year, two would be selected to supervise the medical programs in various prisons.</p>
<p>As soon as Ye Zhen returned to the dormitories for the female physicians, Mo Rongyi came looking for her.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, when are we going hunting?” Mo Rongyi’s shoulder had already healed well. After studying for a couple days in the study, he was about to cry from boredom.</p>
<p>“How did you know I was here?” Ye Zhen looked at Mo Rongyi with a face full of smiles. None of the female physicians lived in a room alone. She was rooming with Chen Jinru. The dormitories for the female physicians were located not far from the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi looked around her room with disgust. “Why are you living in a place like this? Such a grand Cining Palace, and you do not reside there. Why must you come and cram yourself into a place like this?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and said, “A female physician should act and carry herself like a female physician.”</p>
<p>“Hmph, I think that you’re just asking for trouble!” Mo Rongyi said haughtily, perhaps even unhappily.</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, all right, I’m asking for trouble, but I like it. Has Imperial Mother agreed to let you go hunting?” Ye Zhen smiled and asked him. It was already March, and the best time for hunting. Moreover, if it were just in the Imperial Hunting Fields, two days would be enough.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi said, “Of course she’ll agree. Imperial Mother already agreed to this before. When are you going to go with me?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen poked his shoulder. “Does it not hurt anymore?”</p>
<p>“Just a little, but it’s fine now,” Mo Rongyi said.</p>
<p>“Then wait until it doesn’t hurt to go back.” Ye Zhen furrowed her brow as she examined his shoulder. There were still some bruises. She coldly snorted. “This blow from the eighth prince was not a light one. He had it coming, his gambling house being taken away.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi looked at Ye Zhen with shock. “You know about the eighth prince having a gambling house?”</p>
<p>“I only found out a couple of days ago. What’s going to happen to Prince Shun now?” Ye Zhen asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that Changping Casino has already closed its doors. Prince Shun has shut himself up in his estate and refuses to come out. Oh, and last time, when Mo Huaide played dirty with your horse… Imperial Brother wanted to execute him, but Marquis Xingyang entered the palace to beg on his son’s behalf. In the end, he was beaten eighty times, and stripped of his titles as Marquis Xingyang,” Mo Rongyi said excitedly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips. She had guessed that Mo Huaide was the culprit from the very start. But, Mo Rongzhan stripping the title of Marquis Xingyang was something beyond her expectation. By doing this, he was directly working against the branching imperial family.</p>
<p>“I’m going to go see Imperial Brother, and ask him when he’ll let me go hunting,” Mo Rongyi said enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen out away her smile and shook her head. “You’ll have to wait at least two days.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know, so chattery.” Mo Rongyi hummed impatiently. He then asked with disgust, “You’re really going to live here?”</p>
<p>“Hurry and leave.” Ye Zhen waved her hand to bid him away. “Remember to use the medicine I gave you.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi hummed in acknowledgment then ran outside.</p>
<p>Chen Jinru walked in, curiously asking, “Yaoyao, who was the person that just came?”</p>
<p>“Little Prince.” Ye Zhen smiled, saying. “Where did you go?”</p>
<p>“I went to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard to have a look. We’ll have to go there tomorrow to help dry and boil the medicine.” Chen Jinru glanced back but didn’t see a trace of the little prince’s figure.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen went to make her bed. From today on, she was a female physician. With this identity, she could be near Mo Rongyi more uprightly and would have more opportunities to deal with Lu Lingzhi and his sister.</p>
