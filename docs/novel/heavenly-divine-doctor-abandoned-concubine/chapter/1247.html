<p>When Lu Xiangzhi heard Ye Zhen’s meaningful question, he was startled and couldn’t help but ask, “Yaoyao, what do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>Her forehead slightly creased as she thought deeply before finally blurting out the words she felt the need to say.</p>
<p>“The horse you rode belongs to Chengde Villa. That horse, it certainly was not meant for you. Why is it so coincidental that your horse was the only one troubled? Don’t the people in the stables know how to take care of horses? Haven’t you checked for any problems beforehand?”</p>
<p>At Ye Zhen’s volley of questions, he stood speechless and felt a little confused.</p>
<p>It just occurred to him that he never thought of this possibility. In his pure and peaceful life, he couldn’t believe that even horseback riding could be involved in a conspiracy!</p>
<p>“Do you mean someone wanted to hurt me?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen thought Lu Xiangzi was really innocent and naive. “Not hurt you, I think you may have become a scapegoat.”</p>
<p>It’s not that she was belittling Lu Xiangzhi in any way, but for someone to attack a boy who was literally powerless, was too far-fetched.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi was simply a candidate for the upcoming provincial examination, how could someone in Chengde Mountain Villa see it worthy enough to set him up?</p>
<p>Behind them, Tang Zhen popped out of his bubble of fantasy and bore a solemn face. He couldn’t avoid but listen to the siblings’ conversation.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the little miss was able to point out these crucial points in a few words. <i>Was she really just a little girl raised in the border town? </i>He surmised.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi had been silly, he really didn’t spend time thinking about it and believed that it was purely an accident.</p>
<p>Shrugging her shoulders, Ye Zhen puffed out a breath of disappointment before Lu Xiangzhi’s dumbstruck face.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a good thing that Brother does not suspect anything. If my conjectures are right, someone should be watching your every move… It is only through ignorance that you will recover peacefully.”</p>
<p>“Third Sister is right. This matter needs to be investigated.” Tang Zhen’s voice was unusually devoid of cheerfulness as he spoke, his eyes a shade darker.</p>
<p>Right after Lu Lingzhi’s accident, he had begun investigating, sensing that something was off. He wanted to move in secret and thus, chose not to alert Lu Xiangzhi, but surprisingly, Ye Zhen beat him to it.</p>
<p>Awe-struck, Lu Xiangzhi listened to Tang Zhen. His eyes darted back and forth the marquis and his sister, his heart shocked beyond words.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was deeply worried that in the present situation of the Lu Family, Lu Xiangzhi would inevitably become an official in the future. Yet, his nature was simple, too simple actually.</p>
<p>If he entered politics, he would be as defenseless as a child!</p>
<p>Now, she would let him think and learn. Under the care of his parents, he was raised away from the evils of the world, thereby, this was a first for him.</p>
<p>“Brother, I must go” Ye Zhen bid goodbye but not after reminding him of the medicine she gave. “Remember to apply my medicine to your wound tonight.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi pursed his lips and nodded.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen took Ye Zhen out of Chengde Mountain Villa, both of them riding a horse.</p>
<p>Unable to contain his wonder, he asked Ye Zhen directly, “Third Sister, how do you know there was something wrong with that horse?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that an easy question?” Ye Zhen answered his question with a question, a smart move to avoid further queries from him.</p>
<p><i>Is it really easy? Even Lu Xiangzhi thought it was just an accident!</i></p>
<p>“In fact, you don’t really have to accompany me. I could perfectly return to Zhuangzi by myself,” said she boldly.</p>
<p>As much as possible, she didn’t want to have too much contact with the people around Mo Rongzhan, especially those who had made contributions to his usurpation.</p>
<p>Not feeling even a bit offended by Ye Zhen’s desire to get rid of him, Tang Zhen smiled and said, “How can I do that? I promised Madam Lu that I would accompany you back to Zhuangzi.”</p>
<p>A flicker of displeasure flashed across her eyes. “Hmph! Do as you please!”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen was a nice person, she could tell. If she was another person, she would have loved being his friend-and more, if fate allowed it. But, remembering Lu Lingzhi’s friendly face when he poisoned her, an emperor’s loyal subordinate also, she couldn’t help but be vigilant and avoid Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>When she was ready to leave, she saw a group of people coming in their direction. Judging from their uniforms, they were imperial guards.</p>
<p><i>Who brings so many guards when going out?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s face sank as she soon understood who these guards were protecting…</p>
<p>Tang Zhen dismounted his horse quickly. “It is the emperor who has come back from his hunt. Third Sister, hurry down!”</p>
