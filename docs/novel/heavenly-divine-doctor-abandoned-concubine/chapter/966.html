            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 363 – Imperial Physician Examination (1)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t want to say too much in front of Lu Lingzhi, as long as he knew that Lu Wushuang had fallen out of favor now, he certainly wouldn’t sit and watch. And as long as he took matters into his own hands, he would find ways to handle it.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu slept through the night, and her spirit was much better than that in the morning. Lu Shixun also decided to set out on a journey to Jinkou City the next day.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was going back to the academy, too. Three days later it was the imperial physician’s examination, and she was going to take part in it.</p>
<p>But before going to the academy, she made a trip to <em>Qianjin</em> first. She wanted to confirm whether or not Tian Jiu was rescued by Man Qin. She had seen him on the mountain that day. Although she left him some medicine, she was uncertain if he would live.</p>
<p>“Young Miss, Uncle Man said that he could not rescue Tian Jiu. This is his letter that came yesterday.” As soon as Hong Ling saw Ye Zhen, she handed her the letter from Man Qin.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took the letter in shock. “Uncle Man didn’t rescue him? Impossible! Then, who rescued Tian Jiu?”</p>
<p>Hong Ling knew that Tian Jiu had been saved. “But Young Miss, Uncle Tian was rescued.”</p>
<p><em>If Man Qin’s people couldn’t save Tian Jiu, who else in the world is willing to take such a big risk to save him? </em>Ye Zhen’s heart was bewildered. She had her suspicions on who it could be, but she dared not think about it, let alone be sure.</p>
<p>“Uncle Man must not go find Tian Jiu. When he is safe, he will naturally come to us,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Hong Ling was surprised. She, too, was bewildered and couldn’t figure out who else could have saved Tian Jiu. “Young Miss, could it be … Second Lord?”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk nonsense!” Ye Zhen said, keeping her voice low. “Regardless, it is enough that Tian Jiu has been saved.”</p>
<p><em>Did Father save Tian Jiu?</em> Ye Zhen was nervous yet at the same time was looking forward to it. Besides her father, she could not think of anyone who would save lives.</p>
<p><em>If it is indeed Father who’s behind this, then he can’t let people know the whereabouts of Tian Jiu. Otherwise, even Father’s whereabouts may be exposed.</em> Ye Zhen felt that nothing should be done for the time being. As long as there was no news, it shall be considered good news.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen left <em>Qianjin</em> carrying with her a hundred-fragrant-flowers perfume. She couldn’t help her feelings afloat. Although it was not certain that it was her father that saved Tian Jiu, as long as there was a little possibility, it was enough to make her brim with expectation.</p>
<p>Arriving at the academy, Ye Zhen first went to see Qin Fuzi. She had not been here at the School of Medicine for a month now and had missed many lessons. However, this did not affect her determination to take the imperial physician’s examination.</p>
<p>“Do you still want to take the exam?” Qin Fuzi was surprised. Now that she was a princess and even asked for a leave of absence for a month, this veteran tutor hardly expected she would take the exam anymore.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and said, “Of course! I enrolled in the School of Medicine to eventually take part in the medical examination.”</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi looked at her in amazement. “You are already a princess, even if you pass the medical examination, what can you do?”</p>
<p>“Master, although I am now sealed as a princess, I am not a real princess after all. What if I stop being a princess one day?” Besides, Ye Zhen was willing to become a princess just to avoid Mo Rongzhan and had not pinned her future on this identity.</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi smiled and said, “Since you have been made a princess, you no longer have time.”</p>
<p>“Master, there is no stipulation that a princess can’t take the Imperial Physician’s Examination. Didn’t the granddaughter of Empress Duanhui also take the same examination? She is both a physician and a princess, ” Ye Zhen countered.</p>
<p>“Well, the medical examination is in two days. You should read more books.” Qin Fuzi had to admit that he was very optimistic about Ye Zhen. Over the years, no student had ever been as talented as her.</p>
<p>After meeting with Qin Fuzi and before returning to the student’s dormitory, Ye Zhen came across Gao Xueping.</p>
<p>Gao Xueping was determined to pass the imperial physician’s examination. The only one to make her feel threatened was Lu Yaoyao. Without her, she thought she could become the next imperial physician.</p>
<p>“Your Highness.” Gao Xueping bowed haughtily. “I thought you were going to live a leisurely life at home. I didn’t expect you to return to the academy.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I have to take an exam,” Ye Zhen said with a smile, knowing the other didn’t want her to take the medical examination.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Gao Xueping’s face changed slightly. “You are already a princess. Why do you still want to be a physician?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her nonchalantly. “I just like to become one.”</p>
<p>Gao Xueping thought that Ye Zhen was aiming at her on purpose. She couldn’t help but gnash her teeth with hatred. “I won’t let you do what you want. I’m the only one who will be passing the medical examination, not you.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Ye Zhen put on a smile. For now, it’s useless to say anything. It was best to defer the argument until after the results of the exam.</p>
<p>Gao Xueping coldly snorted, and secretly vowed that one day she would let Lu Yaoyao know her capabilities.</p>
<p>At night, when everything was quiet and the School of Medicine peaceful, silently a figure appeared. Before the figure could enter the student’s dormitory, someone immediately noticed. “Who is there?”</p>
<p>The shadow paused and soon disappeared into the night.</p>
