            <p><strong>Chapter 440 – Brother And Sister (1)</strong></p>
<p>“The princess said that the emperor’s medicine needs to be changed, and she went to see Imperial Physician Qi Yizheng*…,” Fude said in a panic. “Your Majesty, this servant will go and get the princess back.”</p>
<p>[*same fellow who treated Lu Lingzhi first during his assassination attempt]</p>
<p>When Xu Huiru saw the unconcealed worry in Mo Rongzhan’s eyes, she was finally able to confirm that the emperor’s heart was really different when it came to Lu Yaoyao. It was not the love that exists between brothers and sisters but that between a man and a woman.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, you go back first,” Mo Rongzhan said in a deep voice, already striding out of the Palace of Heavenly Purity.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen came out of the Imperial Physician’s Courtyard, she heard some shouting from outside the palace gate that was not far away. The fifth prince was saying something loudly.</p>
<p>“We want to protect the emperor. Now the emperor is unconscious and the traitorous officials are taking advantage of this. The empress dowager favors the little prince and is concealing the emperor’s illness. We must go into the palace to remove the traitorous officials and protect the emperor—”</p>
<p>“Kill the treacherous ministers, protect the emperor!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen almost laughed when she heard what was being yelled outside. It really was the idiot of a fifth prince who could think of such a reason, finding an excuse to force the emperor to abdicate.</p>
<p>“Knock the doors down!” the fifth prince shouted loudly.</p>
<p><em>Strange, why did the commander guarding the ninth gate let them run all the way to the palace gate?</em></p>
<p>[TL/N: 九门提督 – An official position, has military power and control/ guards the nine gates of a city…]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the palace gate that was being banged into and suddenly became a little worried.</p>
<p><em>What if the fifth prince really takes hold of the palace and was able to force the emperor to abdicate?</em></p>
<p>“Kill!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen ran in the direction of the Palace of Heavenly Purity and before she could get far, she heard loud and lofty shouts that could shake the heavens calling to kill from outside.</p>
<p><em>Was the fifth prince really able to find someone to assist him in his plans?</em></p>
<p>“Yaoyao!” Mo Rongzhan had already walked over with someone in stride and was relieved to see her well.</p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan…,” her face was joyful as she said, “outside… something seems to have happened outside.”</p>
<p>He squeezed her palm and handed her to Eunuch Fu. “Send the princess to Cining Palace. No matter what happens, don’t come here.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen grabbed his hand abruptly at those words.</p>
<p>“I will be fine,” Mo Rongzhan said to her with a smile.</p>
<p>♚♚♚</p>
<p>Fifth Prince and the Old Prince Kang’s plans to force the emperor to abdicate could be seen right away as a farce. Before General Meng could send any troops to rescue him, Tang Zhen and Wei You had already taken them down, and it didn’t take them much effort at all.</p>
<p>These two princes thought that Mo Rongzhan was seriously ill before they came to court today and who knows where they heard it from that the empress dowager was secretly trying to rope in the cabinet ministers and wanted to support Mo Rongyi as the new emperor when the current emperor dies. This was something they absolutely wouldn’t allow.</p>
<p>They’d waited for very long for Mo Rongzhan to have an accident. This was a golden opportunity. The old man created a chance for them. Originally, they wanted to assassinate Mo Rongyi and Lu Yaoyao. But they hadn’t expected to hurt Mo Rongzhan by mistake. What an easy opportunity this was, if one didn’t seize such chances well, then there wouldn’t be any good things for them.</p>
<p>However, their dream of being an emperor had yet to begin before inexplicably ending.</p>
<p>“Tang Zhen, do you dare to catch this prince? This prince will not let you off,” the fifth prince yelled.</p>
<p><em>We haven’t entered the palace yet, why were all the people I brought along already surrendering?</em></p>
<p><em>No, they aren’t surrendering. Those people are instead turning back?</em></p>
<p>“Yang Jing’an, you traitor!” Old prince Kang shouted angrily and finally understood what was going on.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen snorted coldly, “Yang Jingan was originally loyal to the emperor. He is now eradicating the rebellious party for the emperor. Why would he be a traitor?”</p>
<p>The fifth prince was stunned for a moment and shouted, “Yang Jing’an, you bastard, you dared to play this prince!”</p>
<p>“If you are stupid, just confess it quietly. Don’t yell and invite others to make jokes about you.” Wei You snorted. <em>How could there be such a stupid person thinking that Yang Jingan would help them force the emperor to abdicate?</em></p>
<p>“We want to see the empress dowager, the emperor is seriously ill… Does she, a woman, still want to control the court?” Old Prince Kang barked.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan slowly walked over wearing a deep purple brocade robe. The five-clawed golden dragon on the robe was very life-like. His appearance left the fifth prince and the Old Prince Kang stunned.</p>
<p>“Your… Your Majesty?” The fifth prince paled in fright. He couldn’t believe how Mo Rongzhan was here hale and hearty. <em>He has been here for several days, hasn’t he?</em></p>
<p>“Fifth Brother, who told you that I am dying of illness?” Mo Rongzhan looked at the fifth prince with a smile.</p>
<p>The fifth prince shook his head. “No, this is not possible!”</p>
