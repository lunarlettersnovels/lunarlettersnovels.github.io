            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 333 – Tricked</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen almost wanted to slam the chessboard.</p>
<p><em>How was this possible? Mo Rongzhan might be lucky to win one round, but eight in a row?</em> That was just incredible!</p>
<p>“I’m out!” After losing yet another game, all Ye Zhen wanted to do was put down the chess pieces and leave right that instant.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan smiled. “This is all the patience you have? Don’t you want to go to the library tower anymore?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glared at him angrily. “You won’t let me win at all.”</p>
<p>Now she could finally see that his chess skills were much better hers. He said that he would let her go to the tower if she won, but this bastard would definitely not give her a chance to win.</p>
<p>“How didn’t I let you win?” Mo Rongzhan asked amusedly, only thinking that an incensed Yaoyao was particularly lovely.</p>
<p>The dark eyebrows and eyes made the skin look even fairer, and laughter mixed with anger was always right. This saying probably best described her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that she was a little bit irritated. She had been too confident before and was convinced she would win, only now did she realize that she had underestimated him.</p>
<p>“You just don’t want me to go to the library tower,” Ye Zhen whispered in the end. In front of Mo Rongzhan, she didn’t even bother to look respectful anymore.</p>
<p>“If you win, you can go,” Mo Rongzhan said, “Maybe not today, but some other day.”</p>
<p>“Just wait and see, Your Imperial Majesty. I will manage to beat you up once,” said Ye Zhen fiercely.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan smiled. “I look forward to that.”</p>
<p>“What are you fighting over?” said the empress dowager with a smile. She had arrived when the two were too immersed in the world of their own and spoke before Enuch Fu could pass the message to the emperor.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, you are here.” Ye Zhen ran over.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan stood up and glanced at Ye Zhen with a smile. “Imperial Mother, I am playing chess here with her. Someone was arguing with zhen because she lost in the chess game.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s face flushed a deep hue. “When did I argue with Your Imperial Majesty?”</p>
<p>The empress dowager felt relieved upon seeing them getting along like brother and sister. “Your Imperial Majesty, did you make fun of your sister?”</p>
<p><em>Sister… </em>Mo Rongzhan hated this title. He smiled and said, “Imperial Mother, I’m just playing chess with her. If she wins, I will let her go to the library tower for a day.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager gave him a look. “You said that you didn’t bully Yaoyao, but this is obviously that you are making fun of her.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said, “Imperial Mother, my skills are not as good as him, but one day, I will beat the emperor at chess.”</p>
<p>The emperor looked at her with a smile. “Okay, I will wait and see.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you let Yaoyao win once?” Empress Dowager said with a smile, “You are the emperor.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, Yaoyao does not want me to just let her win.” Mo Rongzhan came over and sat down next to his mother. “I am waiting for her to challenge at any time. As long as she wins, I will let her go to the tower to read.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen thought that if Mo Rongzhan intentionally let her win, she might not want to go to the library tower that much. As they were talking, he saw Mo Rongyi running over.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, Yaoyao…”</p>
<p>“What happened to A’Yi?” Empress Dowager asked Ye Zhen, who was standing next to her in surprise, seeing her little son running in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, he was just practicing how to ride better. He is going to play polo with Prince Shun and the others in a few days. ” Mo Rongzhan explained with a smile.</p>
<p>Empress Dowager couldn’t help being a little worried. “Why does A’Yi want to compete with Prince Shun in polo? Didn’t he just lose and surrender a few days ago?”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, don’t worry about him. This is how he can grow up.” If there was no failure or frustration in life and everything just went too smoothly, it was not a good thing.</p>
<p>By now Mo Rongyi had already reached the pavilion, he bowed to his mother and brother and said, “Yaoyao, I could ride over three railings today.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and nodded. “Wonderful! That’s some nice progress.”</p>
<p>“Go get changed. You have sweat all over your body. Don’t catch a cold!” Empress Dowager said and turned to ask Aunt Chen to take him away.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was very excited, but with his imperial mother and the emperor’s presence, he didn’t dare make any trouble and left to change his clothes first.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei Lu just came to Cining Palace several times to look for you. You haven’t seen her since long, go over today,” Empress Dowager said to Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t want to see Lu Wushuang at all. She didn’t need to guess to know what she was going to say. “Imperial Mother, I will send you back to Cining Palace first.”</p>
<p>“I know that you don’t like it, but you should go and have a chat,” Empress Dowager said to Ye Zhen in a low voice, “whether you like her or not, you are sisters. You need to actually show some courtesy.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, then I will go to Palace of Earthly Tranquility.” Since things were like this, despite her ardent unwillingness, Ye Zhen had to meet Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan frowned and said, “Just don’t go if you don’t want to.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and said, “Wang Fei is my sister. Why would I not like to go?”</p>
