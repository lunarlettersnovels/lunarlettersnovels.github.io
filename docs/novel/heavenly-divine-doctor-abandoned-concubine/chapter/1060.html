            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 269 – The Wang Fei’s Predicament (1)</strong></p>
<p>A hush shrouded the Lu Mansion, no one dared to make a peep afraid to rake up a storm. Thus, the usually boisterous mood of the household was reduced to an eerie silence with every being treading on thin ice.</p>
<p>And yet, would a trivial matter such as this bother the ever effervescent Ye Zhen? As such, with a vivacious air about her, skip in each step, a pot of personally brewed ginseng tea in hand, she arrived at the main hall to visit the Old Madam. But before she stepped in, she ran into Lu Fang and Lu Jing.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, why did you come so late? Old Madam Lu cherishes you so much, yet you only care about yourself, and never pay a visit.” Lu Jing waggled her sarcastic tongue as soon as she saw her.</p>
<p>Only a few people knew the reason for Old Madam Lu’s sudden sickness. As for these two girls, just like those not in the know, thought that she was just tired.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at them with a smile then frowned and asked, “How’s Grandmother now? Did you find her a doctor?”</p>
<p>Healers do not heal themselves, especially the elderly. Therefore, every time when Old Madam Lu was feeling unwell, they would find her a doctor.</p>
<p>Lu Fang glanced at Lu Jing, and said to Ye Zhen, “Grandmother only allows Second Uncle to go inside her room, so we only greet her outside. Madam Chen was asking us to leave, so I suppose it’s unnecessary for you to try. Grandmother doesn’t want to see anyone.”</p>
<p>“I made Grandmother some ginseng tea, I’ll let Madam Chen take it inside,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>She had added some <em>Linquan</em> to the tea. Even though she didn’t like the Lu Family, the old matriarch treated her quite nicely. She was a reasonable old lady, and Ye Zhen believed that she was oblivious to the misdeeds of Lu Lingzhi and Lu Wushuang and as such, she didn’t deserve her hatred.</p>
<p>Lu Jing twitched her mouth and said, “You thought you could go in by making that tea? You should see the reality, Grandmother only favors Wang Fei, do you think you can compare with her?”</p>
<p>“Why would I compare with her?” Ye Zhen smiled and asked, “Fourth Sister, you are overthinking.”</p>
<p>“I think what too much~”</p>
<p>Even before the impatient Lu Jing finished speaking, Ye Zhen who was in no mood to fight, simply walked past her and stepped on the stairs to see Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>Lu Jing stared at Ye Zhen’s back, preparing to taunt her after she failed to see the elder.</p>
<p>“Third Miss is here, Old Madam is expecting you inside.” Madam Chen whispered in Ye Zhen’s ear and took over the ginseng tea from her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded softly. “Is Grandmother all right?”</p>
<p>“She is just having some headache, nothing major.” Madam Chen whispered.</p>
<p><em>Seems like she was really outraged!</em> Ye Zhen lifted the scarlet curtain and went inside the room.</p>
<p>“How can she go inside and see Grandmother?!” Lu Jing couldn’t believe what she saw. ”Old Madam doesn’t want to see anyone, how come she allows Lu Yaoyao to see her alone?” she asked Lu Fang in a huff.</p>
<p>Lu Fang said indifferently, “Didn’t Old Madam see your father as well?”</p>
<p>“Can Lu Yaoyao compare with my father?” Lu Jing shouted sharply.</p>
<p>“I urge you to keep quiet, this is the main hall,” Lu Fang said, ignoring Lu Jing who was by now absolutely incensed.</p>
<p>Ever since she had insisted on marrying into the Liang family, Lu Fang was clearer than anyone else she had deeply upset the old matriarch. Being born of a concubine, she had spent her days cautiously in this household, taking care not to incur anyone’s wrath, especially Liu Shi’s. Her time here was numbered, three more months and she would be married off as such she wanted to tread carefully and avoid getting into conflicts. As for who the old madam cherished the most, was none of her concern anymore.</p>
<p>But would someone like Lu Jing, who was stewing in envy and agitation, let people be at peace? The girl grabbed the other’s hand and refused to accept her nonchalant facade. “Don’t you feel angry at all?!” she asked. “We are all Old Madam’s granddaughters, why does she only see Lu Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>How could she take this insult and injustice? She had never known why the old matriarch was this biased. She could bear the disparity when Lu Wushuang was around, but she would never accept that a bumpkin from border town had weaseled her way into the elder’s heart.</p>
<p>“Jing’er, we are all Grandmother’s granddaughters, that is true indeed, but there are still differences.” Lu Fang smiled at her.</p>
<p>“What’s the difference? Are you saying that I can’t compare with Lu Yaoyao?” Lu Jing demanded.</p>
<p>“What part of you can be compared to her? Are you the Di* Daughter? Is your appearance as good as hers? Do you have any nice ways to please Grandmother like she does?” Lu Fang smiled and asked her by way of an answer. “Forget about it, Jing’er, none of us is as capable as her. I first thought that she’s a country bumpkin, but it is now that I realize we are the bumpkins.”</p>
<p>[<em>Di</em> daughter/son are the children of the main/first/official wife. They command a higher status in the household and society than the <em>Shu</em> aka concubine born.]</p>
<p>All else aside, just the identity as a Di Daughter in the family put Lu Yaoyao above them all. Even without the looks and charm that she was blessed with, she would have never shared the same status as them.</p>
<p>“If you don’t try to fawn over Old Madam now, what about your dowry? Do you expect to rely on your mother or your aunt? You are marrying into the Marquis Family, you don’t want your dowry to be embarrassing, do you?” Lu Jing snorted and took a jab.</p>
<p>Lu Fang looked at her with a faint smile. “Fourth Sister, you don’t need to incite me, do you think us, the Lu Family will short on anyone’s dowry?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine if you don’t want to listen.” An irate Lu Jing stomped, turned away, and stormed away.</p>
