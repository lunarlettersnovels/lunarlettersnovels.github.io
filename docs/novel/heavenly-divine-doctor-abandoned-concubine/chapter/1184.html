            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 143 – Entering The Palace (2)</strong></p>
<p>In the evening, Pei Shi sent Ye Zhen a new set of clothes to wear to the palace tomorrow.</p>
<p>“Mother, isn’t this color too bright?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the elegant pink dress spread out on the bed before her. She had no idea what to wear when visiting the imperial palace but certainly knew this dress was not a good idea.</p>
<p>Pei Shi gave her a disapproving look. “While you are still young, you should not hesitate in wearing beautiful clothes! You won’t be able to wear these robes when you reach my age.”</p>
<p>Still, Ye Zhen shook her head vigorously. “I’d better wear this one.”</p>
<p>She pointed her finger to the simple blue dress with small bunches of flowers laid beside the extravagantly beautiful pink dress. Its colors were all-natural and light, which was exactly what she needed.</p>
<p>“But dear, isn’t that too plain?” Pei Shi asked with a frown, “What if the wang fei won’t like that?”</p>
<p>“Mother, I think… although this pink dress is beautiful, it is not suitable for someone who will be entering the palace. I will wear it on the coming occasions.” Ye Zhen hugged Pei Shi’s arm.</p>
<p>Her resistance came with a reason. Lu Wushuang would surely remember her if she entered the palace ostentatiously dressed like that. She had seen the jealousy of that woman and it’s not something to be underestimated.</p>
<p>In fact, if she could, she would like to use some plant juice to draw on her face tomorrow… With this, a mischievous idea suddenly popped in her head. Perhaps, she should do something with her face to make her look a little less attractive!</p>
<p>After deep deliberation, Pei Shi didn’t force Ye Zhen anymore. Anyway, she didn’t want her daughter to enter the palace like Lu Wushuang. She only hoped that she could find a husband from a good and humble family and be able to live a happy and serene life.</p>
<p>“Then let it be.” She laughed. “Ah, I really didn’t know that my daughter harbors such rational ideas.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen leaned on Pei Shi’s shoulder just like how Lu Yaoyao used to. “Because I have grown up.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi pinched her cheek and smiled without saying a word.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>The next day, the sun had yet to rise in the horizon when Ye Zhen went out of the mansion. Even breathing the cold breeze was painful but to no avail, she stood on the stone steps of the mansion and took in the peace and quiet of the place.</p>
<p>After some time, she began to stretch her limbs, jump in place a few times, and execute a set of boxing techniques which was quite strange in the eyes of the passersby.</p>
<p>As a delicate woman before, she also felt that these movements were strange and should not be done by a lady such as her. However, her father insisted that she practice them every morning, like how everyone practiced martial arts. Expectedly, after doing several rounds, she felt exhausted.</p>
<p>However, it was really helpful to her health. Lu Yaoyao was ill for a while and her body was originally very weak. Although she had the <i>lingquan</i>, Ye Zhen still insisted on taking care of her twin sister’s body this way.</p>
<p>By the time the magnificent sunrise appeared in the eastern sky, Ye Zhen was already covered with a thin layer of sweat. She changed into the clothes Pei Shi had prepared yesterday and dolled herself up with the help of Dai Mei.</p>
<p>As agreed, she wore the thin cotton dress with small indigo flowers painted with moons and a cascading lake at its bottom. Although the dress was not as beautiful as the pink dress, the one Pei Shi suggested, it still made her look graceful and highlighted her pearl skin.</p>
<p>Standing before a mirror, Ye Zhen gazed at her white and flawless face. Her eyes flashed a sly look before she took out a bottle of plant extract she had prepared last night.</p>
<p>Deep in her heart, she really thanked Pei Shi for giving her the medical books from which she learned a lot. Some plants, aside from their healing effects, could cause adverse reactions on the skin.</p>
<p>When she appeared in front of Old Madam Lu, she almost gave everyone in the room a heart attack.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, what are those red dots on your face?!” Old Madam Lu asked hysterically.</p>
