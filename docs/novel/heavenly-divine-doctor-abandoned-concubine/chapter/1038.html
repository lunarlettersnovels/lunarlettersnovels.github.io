            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 291 – Losing Favor (2)</strong></p>
<p>The maid in charge of keeping the gates of the Palace of Earthly Tranquility kowtowed. “This servant greets His Imperial Majesty—”</p>
<p>The man did not wait for her to finish before he took large strides inwards.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang, who was inside quickly came out, startled at his arrival. “Your … Majesty … This wang fei greets His Imperial Majesty.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at Lu Wushuang with hooded eyes. His face, which used to be bright with affection, now looked ordinary and indifferent. He said faintly, “Rise.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang felt excited. She had been waiting for Mo Rongzhan all this time. They all thought he had already taken her for granted, they did not expect he would come.</p>
<p><em>It seems that he still has her in mind. </em>At the emperor’s unexpected arrival, the palace maids thoughts to themselves.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I made these dumplings myself today. Would you like to try them?” Lu Wushuang walked meekly beside Mo Rongzhan and looked at his cold and indifferent face carefully.</p>
<p>When he used to be on the battlefield, he’d liked her dumplings best.</p>
<p>“No, Zhen has already eaten,” Mo Rongzhan said faintly and sat down on the kang bed. “Good news from the west just came. Your elder brother won another battle and nabbed the prince of the west.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang smiled. “That’s great. Your Majesty, you will soon be able to unify the country.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded apathetically. “Wang Fei Lu, I heard that you often go and greet Empress Dowager recently?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this wang fei used to be someone who is not sensitive enough to understand and made you angry. I shall not act the same way again,” Lu Wushuang said in a low voice. She now clearly understood that Mo Rongzhan was no longer the crown prince of Qin Dynasty but the emperor of this country, he was no longer the man who would humour her if she played a small temper tantrum.</p>
<p>“Realizing one’s mistakes and being able to reform oneself is a good thing.” Mo Rongzhan caught a whiff of the rich scent of rouge on Lu Wushuang’s body, and the more he longed for the light, fruity fragrance of Yaoyao’s body.</p>
<p>Whether it’s his Yaoyao or Lu Yaoyao, their fragrances were tantalizing. Unlike other women who all smelled of rouge.</p>
<p>At those words, Lu Wushuang thought he had forgiven her, she laughed all the more and acted charming as she sat down beside him. “Your Majesty, Shuang’er misses you a lot. I won’t make you angry again.”</p>
<p>When she was ready to lean against Mo Rongzhan, he abruptly stood up. “It’s enough that you know that you are wrong. Zhen still has something to do. You should rest.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang looked at Mo Rongzhan in consternation. <em>He’s leaving just like this? Didn’t he come to sleep with me?</em> “Your Majesty, are you still angry with your wang fei?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan walked towards the door, not even looking back, and said,  “No.”</p>
<p>“Then where do you want to go? Are you going to see Xian Fei Xu?” Lu Wushuang asked, in distress, unable to control her jealousy.</p>
<p>“Lu Wushuang, you have overstepped your boundaries!” Mo Rongzhan looked at her coldly.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this wang fei—”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang was caught up in the moment that she was not able to control her temper once more but Mo Rongzhan had long strode out. No matter how she called him from behind, he did not look back.</p>
<p>Looking at the tall figure disappearing into the dim light of night and she started crying.</p>
<p>“Your Highness—” Aunt He called her helplessly.</p>
<p>“He must have gone to Xu Huiru. He must have gone to see her!” Lu Wushuang cried.</p>
<p>Aunt He thought to herself,<em> even if the emperor goes to find Xian Fei Xu, what then? Can you stop the emperor from doing so?</em></p>
<p>Lu Wushuang turned and ran to her bedchamber, threw herself on the bed and began to sob.</p>
<p>She never thought that her falling out of favor would come so quickly. She was caught off guard. <em>What went wrong? We were definitely fine before …</em></p>
<p>“Your Highness, why did you lose your temper in front of the emperor again?” Aunt He said in a low voice, “You forgot again that the emperor is the supreme ruler of a country.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang cried all the more. “If my brother had not won the battle, he wouldn’t come to see me. Now the emperor only has Xu Huiru in his heart!”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please keep your voice down.” Aunt He turned pale with fright and quickly stopped her mistress from getting herself into trouble.</p>
<p>“Go and see if the emperor went to Xu Huiru,” Lu Wushuang bit her lip and said.</p>
