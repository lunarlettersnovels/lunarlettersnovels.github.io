            <p><strong>Chapter 539 – People in Black Wind Island</strong></p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao had just stepped out of the gate when he saw Ye Chunming walking over with hasty steps. Although he was wearing a mask, he could still see the tension in his expression.</p>
<p>“Ye Shi, you’ve come just in time, I have something to ask you,” Zhao Mingxiao said.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming shook his head. “Your Majesty, there is no time to tangle with Zhao Tianji any longer, Mo Rongzhan is just outside the stone formation… In an hour, he will be able to bring in his troops to attack.”</p>
<p>“Did you leak the news out?” Zhao Mingxiao glared at Ye Chunming. How could Mo Rongzhan come to Zhao Jia Island this quickly, unless someone had leaked the news to him in advance?</p>
<p>Ye Chunming sneered, “How can I leak information to Mo Rongzhan? I am still a wanted criminal of the Jin Kingdom, can I still contact him? Besides, your country is only two days old, and Mo Rongzhan is far away in the Jin Capital… He’s not a god who can come to Zhao Jia Island immediately within two days by himself!”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao coldly snorted in annoyance, in that case, Mo Rongzhan’s appearance here was not because he had established the country, <em>then why?</em></p>
<p>“Are you afraid?” Ye Chunming looked at Zhao Mingxiao and asked with a smile.</p>
<p>He had thought that Mo Rongzhan might not come to Zhao Jia Island and that it would take time to lure him here. At least, today’s Zhao Jia Island was not worth the Emperor of Jin’s trip. He too was surprised that Mo Rongzhan appeared outside the stone formation so quickly.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao was furious. “What am I afraid of? Does it look like I’m afraid of him, Mo Rongzhan!”</p>
<p>Ye Chunming glanced at him and said, “Mo Rongzhan personally arrived, perhaps… Zhao Tianji will join forces with him.”</p>
<p>“Join him and betray Zhao Jia Island? …Does he want to be spurned by the islanders?” Zhao Mingxiao coldly snorted. “Mo Rongzhan only brought two warships. If we can’t even defeat two warships, what’s the point of talking about establishing a nation? All I have to do is give the order and everybody will go with me to battle!”</p>
<p>The corners of Ye Chunming’s mouth floated a light smile as he followed Zhao Mingxiao and walked out.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao walked a few steps and looked back at Ye Chunming, “Where are you keeping Lu Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“She was taken away by your people.” Ye Chunming frowned, feeling delayed about Zhao Mingxiao’s distrust.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao looked at him sharply and said, “My people said she was rescued.”</p>
<p>Ye Chunming’s face changed slightly as he said, “Lu Yaoyao is really not in your hands?”</p>
<p>“If she’s not with you… or in my hands, who else could have rescued her? Zhao Tianji is still sending people to look for her. It’s impossible for a living being to disappear on Zhao Jia Island.</p>
<p>“Now for the time being I cannot care about her. First, deal with Mo Rongzhan!” Ye Chunming said.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao said in a deep voice, “Go and order troops to prepare for the battle, I will join soon.”</p>
<p>Ye Chunming glanced at him and said, “Good.”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao turned around, walked back, and directly kicked open the door to Mu Qing’s room. He glared daggers at the startled Mu Qing and said with gritted teeth, “Did you save Lu Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand what you’re talking about!” Mu Qing looked at him with a pale face and shook her head to indicate that she didn’t know anything.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao grabbed her neck fiercely and roared, “You don’t have to pretend to my face, hand over Lu Yaoyao immediately!”</p>
<p>“I really don’t know where Lu Yaoyao is.” Mu Qing’s face was red, and she couldn’t breathe because of his choking, so she reached out and punched his arm hard.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao stared at the woman in his clutches and seethed, “Who else but you, Mu Qing? Is Lu Yaoyao’s life important or your siblings’?”</p>
<p>Mu Qing struggled even more, and the last bit of hope she had for Zhao Mingxiao disappeared.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you half a day to hand over Lu Yaoyao, or I’ll kill Mu Xue and Mu Fei,” Zhao Mingxiao said coldly and ruthlessly shoved her to the side.</p>
<p>“You can’t hurt Mu Xue and Mu Fei!” Mu Qing panted heavily and shouted at Zhao Mingxiao’s back.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao had already slammed out of the door long ago, and when he heard Mu Qing’s shout, he just coldly shouted back, “Then hand over Lu Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>“Big Sister!” Mu Fei cried out and hastened over. He had come from the other side of the long corridor, just in time to see the scene of Mu Qing being shoved to the ground.</p>
<p>“Fei!” Mu Qing grabbed his hand, her eyes were slightly cold as she looked at the fading figure of Zhao Mingxiao. She lowered her voice and said, “Quickly, you and your second sister must go to the Island Lord…”</p>
<p>Mu Fei saw the finger marks on Mu Qing’s neck and was so angry that his eyes turned red. “Big Sister, how could Brother-in-law hurt you? I’ll go and settle the score with him!”</p>
<p>“Don’t go!” Mu Qing grabbed his hand. “Listen to me, go find the Island Lord, you can’t stay here.”</p>
<p>“Big Sister, what’s going on? How did Brother-in-law suddenly become like this?” Mu Fei asked anxiously,<em> Brother-in-law was clearly very good to Big Sister before.</em></p>
<p>Mu Qing whispered, “Fei, do as I say, otherwise our Zhao Jia Island will be in danger. Go and tell the Island Lord that the<em> person</em> is on Black Wind Island. Remember, deliver this message to no one but Island Lord, understand?”</p>
<p>“What about you when we leave?” Mu Fei cried and asked. “Let’s go and find Island Lordtogether.”</p>
<p>“If I leave, Zhao Mingxiao will find out.” Mu Qing whispered, “Go and find your second sister quickly. Don’t let anyone else find out.”</p>
<p>Mu Fei shook his head, he felt that if he left, he might never be able to see his sister again.</p>
<p>“Fei, you are already a man, you can’t always ask your sister to protect you. You have to learn to help your sister now, you have to protect your two sisters, understand?” Mu Qing pressed his shoulder and said to him solemnly.</p>
<p>“Big Sister, I’ll go and find the Island Lord and ask him to come and take you away,” Mu Fei said.</p>
<p>Mu Qing managed a small smile. “Good!”</p>
<p>Mu Fei looked at her deeply, turned, and ran out at lightning speed. He still had to go and find his second sister. However, he reckoned it should not be difficult to get her to go to Island Lord with him, after she admired the man.</p>
<p>He and Mu Xue did not have a hard time leaving the place. The people had all been summoned by Zhao Mingxiao to the beach to go into battle, so they left with almost no impediment.</p>
<p>“Why does Big Sister suddenly want you to find Island Lord?” Mu Xue asked her brother curiously. “Did something happen?”</p>
<p>Mu Fei pursed his lips and didn’t say anything about Mu Qing being hurt by Zhao Mingxiao.</p>
<p>“Have you lost your tongue, I’m talking to you,” Mu Xue called out in no good humor.</p>
<p>“Big Sister wants to say something to Island Lord, why do you ask so many questions, just follow me,” Mu Fei said.</p>
<p>Mu Xue said, “Brother-in-law doesn’t like us going to Island Lord. If he knows, he will definitely be unhappy.”</p>
<p>“So what if he is unhappy,” Mu Fei said with a black face. He dragged Mu Xue and sped up. again. “Don’t keep asking questions all the time. Hurry up, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“What does Big Sister want you to say to the Island Master?” Mu Xue asked again.</p>
<p>Mu Fei pursed his lip tight and refused to say another word.</p>
<p>“Fei, what exactly is the message you want to bring to Island Lord?” Mu Xue continued undeterred.</p>
<p>“If you want to know, go and ask Big Sister yourself!”</p>
