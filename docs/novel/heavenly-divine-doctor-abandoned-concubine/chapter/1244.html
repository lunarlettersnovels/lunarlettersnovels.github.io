<h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 83 – The Same Name (2)</h3>
<p>Mo Rongzhan momentarily stiffened, halted his steps, then gazed at the young man.</p>
<p>“Rise.” Mo Rongzhan spoke lightly and looked at Lu Xiangzhi with deep and distant eyes. “Are you Lu Lingzhi’s brother, Lu Shiming’s son?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi was on an edge since he talked with his sister and Tang Zhen. In order to think clearly, he went to the stables, in the comfort of his favorite creatures, the horses.</p>
<p>However, after a moment, he still couldn’t believe it and couldn’t see why anyone would intentionally do it. Deciding to go out, he was greeted by the attendants and guards lined up behind the emperor.</p>
<p>Knowing that the emperor had been so kind as to send him medicine for his injured hand, he hastily approached Mo Rongzhan and knelt before him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes slightly sank as he asked, “How long did your family live in the border town?”</p>
<p>“Replying to the emperor, this official’s brother has lived in the border town since I was three years old.” Lu Xiangzhi answered, his mind brimming with confusion- <i>why did the emperor ask him of this?</i></p>
<p>“None of your family has ever come back?” Mo Rongzhan frowned. <i>If so, his sister could not have appeared in Baihua Garden years ago.</i></p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi lowered his head. “None, Your Majesty. This is our first visit to the capital “</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan felt slight disappointment in his heart. “You are dismissed.”</p>
<p><i>It is not her!</i></p>
<p>Just because the names were similar, it didn’t mean that the girl who saved him was Third Miss Lu! Mo Rongzhan felt his heart bleed.</p>
<p><i>If Lu Wushuang had used her sister’s identity, how could she not know the right nickname and secret code?</i></p>
<p>This moment, he promised himself one thing.</p>
<p><i>All be damned, I will find her!</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gradually slowed down her horse upon reaching an ample distance from Chengde Mountain Villa. Her heart was still pounding painfully against her chest.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he didn’t recognize her as the one who kicked him on that unfortunate night. Otherwise, she couldn’t imagine the punishment he would have bestowed!</p>
<p>Tang Zhen caught up from behind. Taking notice of Ye Zhen’s pale face, he asked worriedly, “Yaoyao, are you all right?”</p>
<p>“This is nothing.” Ye Zhen shook her head, secretly vowing to never step into that terrible place again.</p>
<p>“Are you afraid of the emperor?” Tang Zhen’s tone was somewhat pleased.</p>
<p>He dreaded the moment the emperor would discover her stunning beauty. He had presumed that Ye Zhen would act like any other miss – trying to catch the emperor’s attention, preferring the splendor of living inside the palace.</p>
<p>However, she just hid behind him with her head down and seemed to be very afraid of being under the emperor’s gaze.</p>
<p>His heart was flying in utter bliss!</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took a sharp intake of breath and looked back at him. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“That’s the Son of Heaven above all else. Isn’t it a matter, of course, to be afraid of him?”</p>
<p>She had never been afraid of Mo Rongzhan. Before she died, he had always been the gentle Elder Brother in her heart. Now, he was just the enemy she wanted to kill.</p>
<p>“Your sister is not afraid.” Tang Zhen began to look into the distance.</p>
<p><i>Sister?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen figured out that he was talking about Lu Wushuang…</p>
<p>“When we were in Weicheng, other people were afraid of the emperor. Only your sister was not. She is an extraordinary woman. Not all women would go fight with the emperor like that! In those days, even our men could not believe what she did. Turns out, she was the woman the emperor was looking for, for a long time.”</p>
<p>A mocking smile appeared on the corners of Ye Zhen’s mouth. “Because Wang Fei Lu once saved the emperor?”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen was stunned. “How do you know? Your eldest brother told you?”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, she refused to let Tang Zhen see her troubled face and thus, spoke softly as to not put her emotion to show.</p>
<p>“Zhuangzi is ahead, please go back to the Chengde Mountain Villa, Marquis Tang. This miss can take it from here.”</p>
<p><i>Why does no one remember her, the late Wang Fei?</i> <i>When Mo Rongzhan lived and enjoyed the company of other women, did anyone think of Ye Zhen who was abandoned in her palace?</i></p>
<p><i>Wang Fei of the Qin Dynasty… Ye Zhen… </i>seemed to have become a taboo, a memory that did not exist, and no one dared to mention her or her family again, believing that it would bring them bad luck.</p>
<p><i>What a pitiful end! </i>Ye Zhen’s eyes were sour, it was hard to suppress the hatred in her heart.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen noticed Ye Zhen’s sudden change in countenance. He looked at her back doubtfully. “Yaoyao, are you all right?”</p>
<p>“I’m all right. Thanks to the marquis for his concern,” Ye Zhen said flatly, grabbing the reins harder and galloping towards the Zhuangzi.</p>
<p>As soon as she arrived at the gate, Ye Zhen handed the horse to the doorman but was disappointed to see that Tang Zhen followed her.</p>
<p><i>Looks like he doesn’t have the heart to leave her in peace!</i></p>
<p>She faced him, her icy stare digging holes in his handsome, bewildered face.</p>
<p>“Marquis Tang, don’t you need to find out who did the trick on my brother’s horse? Why waste your time here in leisure?</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I didn’t provoke you, did I? Why are you angry with me?” Tang Zhen helplessly looked at her and asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him coldly, took a step forward, and asked him in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Have you ever thought about the abandoned Wang Fei of the Qin Dynasty when you sing praises of Mo Rongzhan and Lu Wushuang for sharing weal and woe? Have you ever wondered how she died?”</p>
