            <p><strong>Chapter 431 – Your Majesty, What is Your Command? (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this slave is here,” Eunuch Fu said as he bent his back low. For the past two days, he was unable to fathom his master’s temper, not knowing when his mood would turn bad.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan asked, face calm without revealing in the slightest the storm brewing in his heart, “Where is Lu Yaoyao? How come today no one has seen the person?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Her Highness has not yet entered the palace,” Eunuch Fu replied.</p>
<p><em>She’s not in the palace yet? Does she have no worry about his injury at all? Or is it that she doesn’t want to take care of him at all?</em></p>
<p>“Have someone summon her into the palace!”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu dared not to say another superfluous word. He immediately darted out to carry on his master’s bidding. In his haste, he almost ran into Xu Huiru outside. He hurriedly saluted, “Xianfei Niangniang.”</p>
<p>Seeing that the emperor’s most trusted aide was in a hurry, Xu Huiru looked at him and asked with a smile, “Eunuch Fu, where are you going?”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu smiled awkwardly. “The emperor wants to see the princess, so this slave is going to invite her into the palace.”</p>
<p><em>Why does the emperor want to see Lu Yaoyao?</em> Xu Huiru thought even as she reluctantly kept her smile on her face before she went in to see Mo Rongzhan with her head down.</p>
<p>“This concubine greets the emperor.” Xu Huiru looked at Mo Rongzhan with a shy smile on her face.</p>
<p>When she saw Mo Rongzhan, her mood immediately became happy. How could it not be? She had spent the night in the Palace of Heavenly Purity and between them, she felt like they were no longer like before. All the favors previously looked fake.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan glanced at her lightly. “What can <em>zhen</em> do for Xianfei?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this concubine has personally made some pastries. Try it.” Xu Huiru had a small food box in her hand. Prior to entering the palace, she had diligently practiced her culinary skills. Thus, she believed that so long as the emperor tried her craftsmanship, he wouldn’t be able to think of Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Take it away. <em>Zhen</em> does not like sweet food. Don’t come to the Palace of Heavenly Purity these days,” Mo Rongzhan lowered his eyes and said in a cold voice.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru’s face changed. “Your Majesty?”</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Xu Huiru came out of the Palace of Heavenly Purity with a pale face. She couldn’t understand.  <em>Wasn’t he all right with me yesterday?</em></p>
<p>She felt that yesterday’s emperor was the most gentle and moving ever since she had entered the palace. Today, she was prepared. As long as she stayed in the Palace of Heavenly Purity, she must wait on the bed. Not to mention, she was the one who most wanted to give birth to an heir for the emperor. A little prince…</p>
<p><em>So, why did the emperor kick me out? Was it because of Lu Yaoyao?</em></p>
<p>She clenched her hands tightly. She still remembered the look in his eyes when he saw Lu Yaoyao yesterday. They were filled with a desire to aggressively possess her. It was not the look that an emperor should have when seeing his sister…</p>
<p><em>Did Lu Yaoyao do anything shameful with the emperor?</em></p>
<p>The more she thought about it, the more frightened she became, and suddenly she had the urge to impulsively dispose of her to avoid future accidents.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>At this moment, Ye Zhen and Old Madam Lu were at the Huguo Temple. In her past life, she hadn’t believed that worshipping Buddha was useful, but ever since her magical experience, she felt that perhaps Buddha really existed.<em> Otherwise, who could have known about her unwillingness and allow her to be reborn in her younger sister’s body?</em></p>
<p><em>Buddha, if you really exist, please bless me so that I can find my father and brother as soon as possible… and let those villains get their just retribution.</em> Ye Zhen kowtowed reverently.</p>
<p>The old matriarch next to her was praying for the Lu family. They each had their own thoughts but none knew whose prayer Buddha would answer.</p>
<p>“Ai~ Now I don’t dare to ask the Buddha to bless our Lu family with wealth and prosperity. As long as all my children and grandchildren are safe, that’s enough.” Old Madam Lu sighed and took Ye Zhen to the apse.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at her. What she expected was definitely different from the elder. She wanted Lu Lingzhi and Lu Wushuang to get retribution. <em>So how could she hope that they would be safe?</em></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, look!” Old Madam Lu pointed to an isolated temple on the opposite mountain. “That is the Nianci Temple. Your eldest sister is there.”</p>
<p>Nianci Temple was not called so before for it was merely a nunnery for Buddhist nuns. Later, because the nun inside saved the first emperor once, the first emperor gave the temple its name, and after which it became a place where erring concubines reflected on their behaviours behind closed doors. It was not an easy place for ordinary people to enter.</p>
<p>“She will reflect and know that the people who treat her best are the people of the Lu family,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice. From Lu Wushuang’s point of view, it seemed as though others taking good care of her was an obvious matter and so she never knew how to be grateful.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu sighed. “I hope so.”</p>
<p>They didn’t stay in the temple for too long. Old Madam Lu was still worried about Lu Lingzhi’s body, so she donated five hundred taels of incense money and took Ye Zhen back to the Lu Mansion.</p>
