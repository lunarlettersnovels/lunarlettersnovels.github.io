            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 231 – The Marquis’ Advise (2)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen was seething in rage inwardly. One person’s evil intentions negated an entire clan’s good deeds. Yes, her uncle was the black sheep, but why had the whole family to bear the brunt? Wasn’t it enough that they had paid with their lives, that now they were being sullied even in death? What trouble? What punishment? Did anyone even care to know the truth?</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, that’s not what I meant,” Tang Zhen hurriedly said. He did not want a repeat and worsen his ties with her that was already hanging by the thread. “I just want to remind you that what one says in front of you is not necessarily true, but to take advantage of your naïvety and innocence. I know better than you what one’s purpose is.”</p>
<p>He was flabbergasted to the extent Teacher Shan had indoctrinated this young girl. Earlier he only had a hunch, but now he was certain it was the teacher’s doing. One, she was the last wang fei’s teacher and was bound to be sympathetic towards her pupil. Two, how else would a girl born and brought up in border town be so passionate about someone she had no connection with whatsoever?</p>
<p>“Marquis Tang, whose words are you relaying?” Ye Zhen raised an eyebrow and looked at him, suspecting Mo Rongzhan’s suspicions. Clearly, he was a messenger.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen smiled trying to quell her ire. “No one asked me to speak to you about this.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him suspiciously. “Then why do you come to me all of a sudden? Did what I say to you last time spread out? Even so, I don’t feel guilty. Not everyone in the Ye Family has committed many evils, just like not every emperor is engrossed in debauchery.”</p>
<p>“How could you say that!” Tang Zhen almost wanted to put his hand over her mouth. “Yaoyao, this is the capital. Sometimes even if you don’t mean to say a word, the consequences could be grave.”</p>
<p>Although her courage was admirable, Tang Zhen feared she would as soon land herself in trouble. As a good friend of her brother and the feelings he had for her, he had taken it upon himself to see that she did not land in trouble. But right now, he was doing a very poor job at it.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips, she had received the confirmation she was seeking. It really was Mo Rongzhan who ordered Tang Zhen to investigate her. A sneer flashed across her charming eyes. <em>What does he want to know?</em></p>
<p>He wanted to know why a member of the Lu Family should speak for the Ye Family when she should be enemies with them.</p>
<p>Her eyes were even colder than ice. As the happenings of this morning in the imperial study flitted past her mind, her heart turned frosty. It was today that she realized that she still did not know enough about Mo Rongzhan, just as she did not know how different he was in her previous life. In just a few short months, he no longer doted on Lu Wushuang. The things she had seen as a wandering spirit, how he held her in the palm of her hand, was still fresh in mind. How he coaxed her and gave her free rein, turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to all her misdeeds. And yet, what she witnessed yesterday was a stark contrast. Most of all, she did not understand why he’d kissed her today.</p>
<p>Two days ago, when she entered the palace, he still looked disgusted at the sight of her. But today he wanted to make her a concubine? Ye Zhen found it absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p><em>What did he see in me? When I was his wife, he considered me beneath his contempt. Now that I’m just a wild girl who grew up in a border town… he likes it instead? How fickle can he be!</em></p>
<p><em>I wish for him to die!</em></p>
<p>“Thank you for reminding me, Marquis Tang. I shall keep that in mind,” Ye Zhen said in feigned civility. She was well aware of Tang Zhen’s feelings for her, unfortunately, she didn’t want him to be in a fool’s paradise. It would do everyone well if this fire wasn’t extinguished well before time.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen looked down into her eyes. “Are you angry?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen chuckled. “You are so kind as to remind me, although it is for the sake of Eldest Brother, you just do not want me to be put at a disadvantage in the future. How can I be angry?”</p>
<p>The last time he had brought up the Ye Family, she had been incensed for quite a while. He decided not to push his luck today. “I won’t stay for long. Yaoyao, I wish you well.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lowered her head and did not speak.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen’s eyes misconstrued it as shyness. His heart rate suddenly accelerated. “Yaoyao, I…”</p>
<p>Before the words of confession were uttered, Huang Fuxiang’s figure appeared behind them and interrupted him loudly. “Cousin, what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Hearing Huang Fuxiang’s voice, Tang Zhen’s face sank, and he stepped closer to Ye Zhen. “Yaoyao, I came here today to tell you that. Later, you should be careful, and don’t just believe other people’s words.”</p>
<p>Apparently, Tang Zhen still believed that she was instigated to speak for the Ye Family.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Tang Zhen,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so polite,” Tang Zhen said with a bright smile.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang came near them. Seeing Ye Zhen, she glared at her fiercely, and asked Tang Zhen, “Cousin, have you come to see me?”</p>
<p>“Miss Huang, I’m not your cousin. I can’t stand you calling me as such,” Tang Zhen said coldly. He could not let Yaoyao misunderstand his relationship with Huang Fuxiang.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang felt wronged as she looked at Tang Zhen with teary eyes. “Cousin, how can you say that? My mother is certainly your aunt.”</p>
<p>“Miss Huang, it seems that your mother did not tell you. Fifteen years ago, your mother had already cut off any relationship with my mother. I, Tang Zhen, have been living alone in the capital with no relatives.” Tang Zhen coldly asserted.</p>
<p>“Cousin…” Huang Fuxiang felt wronged and held Tang Zhen’s sleeve.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen strenuously waved away, turned his head, and said to Ye Zhen gently, “Yaoyao, I shall leave now.”</p>
<p>“Well, then,” Ye Zhen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang wanted to grab Tang Zhen by the sleeve once more, but she could not even touch it let alone take a hold of him. She watched Tang Zhen get into the carriage as he left without hesitation.</p>
