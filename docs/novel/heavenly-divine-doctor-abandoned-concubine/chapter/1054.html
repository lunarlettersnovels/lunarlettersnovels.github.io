            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 275 – Tending To the Old Matriarch</strong></p>
<p>It is the heart that hurts and forgives. Ye Zhen’s heart had hurt a lot in her past life, time and again she had been dealt with fatal wounds. In this life, she had shed all her sympathies, and decisively marked her friends and foes. And this was especially true in the case of the Lu family that was sheltering her at the moment.</p>
<p>She had resolved to shield her sister’s adopted parents and brother, she was willing to extend her benevolence to Old Madam Lu even- but that was as far as she would go. Though she had initially had reservations towards the old matriarch, everything had changed before she even realized it. What had started off as a perfunctory show of filial piety, to hug the biggest thigh in this family for support, had now transformed into genuine concern.</p>
<p>Look here now, throughout the day and all through the night, Ye Zhen had been constantly by the old madam’s side. She ate with her, drank tea with her … made her laugh. As a combined effort of this and the miraculous healing properties of <em>lingquan</em>, the old madam’s health had remarkably improved, her spirit a lot better than usual.</p>
<p>Just as the old madam’s health becomes better, the atmosphere of the entire Lu Mansion, finally, started getting better as well. As the year was drawing to a close, the whole family was busy with cleaning up and welcoming the new year- the air was full of excitement and jubilation as if the previous gloom had never happened.</p>
<p>“Thanks to my Yaoyao, Mother looks so much better now,” Wang Shi said looking at Ye Zhen with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who was standing next to Old Madam Lu with her head bowed, was on a high alert now. Compared to the temperamental and short-sighted Liu Shi, she was warier of the ever polite Wang Shi. Being by Lu Shuxin’s side in Jinkou City for many years now, needless to say, she had a better insight of dealing and managing people. She was patient, tactful … never revealing her heart.</p>
<p>“Second Sister-in-law, don’t compliment Yaoyao too much. What else can she do except talk to her grandmother all day long? If it weren’t for you and Second Brother finding a skilled doctor, would Mother have recovered this quickly?” Pei Shi said with a smile.</p>
<p>Wang Shi lips lifted into a smile. “Third Sister-in-law, don’t be modest. The family doesn’t lack in daughters but it is only Yaoyao who can stay in the main hall. Others aren’t as blessed.”</p>
<p>See here now, in a space of a few words the conniving Wang Shi had made a target out of Ye Zhen. On one hand, she was praising her good fortune, on the other, making the other girls aware of their position in the eyes of the old matriarch.</p>
<p>The Lu Fang to the side, simply kept her head lowered, and didn’t utter a word. It was not that she couldn’t see through Wang Shi’s intentions or knew not her status in the family, but right now she had but one goal- life out her days here in peace. However, Lu Jing was another matter. Over and over she had felt her grandmother’s biasedness, she was unreconciled. But since she couldn’t voice her grievance, she glared daggers at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Mother, Grandmother has asked me to come and live in the main hall.” Lu Tong, who was sitting next to Wang Shi, spoke in a milky voice.</p>
<p>The triumphant smile on her face froze as she stared down at her own daughter.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu, who had been quiet for some time now, looked at Wang Shi and spoke with a light smile. “Second Daughter-in-law, if you like the upper room so much, let’s have Tong’er stay in the West Wing. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Mother, Tong’er is still young. I’m afraid it will disturb your rest,” Wang Shi said hurriedly.</p>
<p>Old Madama Lu smiled. “Yaoyao is studying at the School of Medicine. She is more proficient with medicine than the others and is taking care of me in the main hall. Is there anyone better suited for such a job than her?</p>
<p>“Mother, that is exactly what I wanted to say about Yaoyao,” Wang Shi said with a smile.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu returned the smile. “Although am old, am not muddled. I can understand everything you say.” Her tone was light but the meaning was profound.</p>
<p>Wang reluctantly smiled.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu ran a gaze around the room, taking in each and every person present. “The New Year is soon arriving. A few days ago Wang Fei bestowed a lot of gifts. Second Daughter-in-law, go to the storehouse, have a look, and send them over to every room.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mother.” Wang Shi answered in a low voice.</p>
<p>“I’m still a little tired. Go down first.”</p>
<p>Two days ago, Old Madam Lu had temporarily handed over the family affairs to Wang Shi and Pei Shi. She had asked them handled the matters together.</p>
<p>Lu Jing took the opportunity and immediately went over. “Grandmother, let me help you back to your room.”</p>
<p>“You all can go back now. Since the doctor said my illness is cured, you don’t need to stay here to take care of me here. Yaoyao, you go back too. You did nothing but stay by my side these past two days,” Old Madam Lu said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and said, “Grandmother, then I’ll go back now.”</p>
<p>She had decided to stay in the main hall and tend to the old matriarch because she really liked her. She had been kind to her and her illness, even if indirectly, was because of her. Had she not ended up in a squabble with Lu Wushuang, she would have not been angered to the point of sickness. As such, she wanted to repay her kindness, very unwilling to owe her something in the future.</p>
<p>As soon as she had exited the main hall, Ye Zhen picked pace. She knew Lu Jing, who was hard on her heels, wanted to speak to her. But right now, she was in no mood to entertain the jealous girl.</p>
