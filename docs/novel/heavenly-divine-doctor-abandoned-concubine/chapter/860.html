            <p><strong>Chapter 470 – A Strange Inn</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t need divination to know that there would be a disaster in Huaijiang this year, but it hadn’t happened yet. Qi Jin had already gone there(HJ) early, but she didn’t know if Qi Jin was also ahead of schedule in her previous life, but it would be useless. In the rainy season two months later,  there would still be a plague there(HJ), she could only know so much. As to why the plague would happen, and what would happen in Huaijiang, she really didn’t know anything. Even if she wanted to do something in advance, she didn’t know where to start.</p>
<p>“I had a divination last night.” Ye Zhen whispered, “It is a natural disaster”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen was slightly startled, could she tell that it was a natural disaster or a man-made disaster? He had also made a prediction yesterday, but there was no such distinction. Although it was fierce, it was somewhat vague and immutable, and from the perspective of the prediction, Huaijiang was full of variables.</p>
<p>“Natural disaster?” Huangfu Chen asked again.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded slightly. “Master, maybe I was wrong.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen frowned, shook his head, and whispered, “Last time, didn’t you say it was an ominous divination? Although we can’t change this kind of divination, we always have to find a way to reduce casualties, so let’s rush to Huaijiang as soon as possible. ”</p>
<p>“Okay, Master,” said Ye Zhen. There were still two months to go, and Qi Jin had already rushed to Huaijiang. “Master, it is better that we first ask people to bring a letter to Imperial Physician Qi so that she can be on guard.” ”</p>
<p>“You write a letter, and I’ll arrange for someone to send it to my aunt,” Huangfu Chen said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen responded with a smile, she didn’t dare to expect to be able to change the natural and man-made disasters in Huaijiang with that little impression of the previous life, but if there was a little help, it was also to be fought for.</p>
<p>She went back to the carriage to write a letter to Qi Jin. She said that it was Huangfu Chen’s divination and that he had foreseen a possible disaster in Huaijiang. She didn’t elaborate for that was all she knew anyway. Also, she suggested seeking the prefectural magistrate, Huaiyang’s assistance.</p>
<p>Their carriage had been on the mountain road for a day when it finally reached a village before the sun went down.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said, “This village is not big. It’s not easy to find a decent inn. Let’s find a place to stay for the night.”</p>
<p>Late was the hour with no pedestrians on the road; only an oil lamp was lit in a shabby-looking inn next to the entrance of the village. Ye Zhen and Huangfu Chen looked at each other. Other than spending the night here, there seemed to be no other recourse.</p>
<p>They parked the carriage outside the inn. The young manservant driving the carriage stepped down and went to find food for the horse while the pair of master and disciple entered the inn together.</p>
<p>There was only an innkeeper, not even a waiter. He was dozing behind the table, oblivious to the arrival of guests. Huangfu Chen coughed lightly before he woke up.</p>
<p>“Sirs, are you making a pitstop*?” The innkeeper hurriedly stood up, rubbed his eyes, and looked at Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>[*brief stop for rest and snacks]</p>
<p>“We need accommodation. Do you have any rooms?” Huangfu Chen asked indifferently and looked around the inn. Although it looked very small, it was still clean.</p>
<p>The man seemed a little surprised. “You want to stay?”</p>
<p>“Is there no room?” Huangfu Chen asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! Yes!” he hastily nodded his head and quickly said with a smile, “Does this guest prefer <em>Tian</em> or <em>Di</em>*?”</p>
<p>[*Tian = heaven, Di= earth, technically a VIP room and average room]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was inwardly amused. Such a small inn was even divided into heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled lightly. “Two <em>tian</em> rooms.”</p>
<p>“Sir, this way please.” The innkeeper held the oil lamp and led them upstairs.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen followed behind Huangfu Chen. She looked around suspiciously. Strangely, although it was dilapidated, regardless of the layout, it could be seen that it was very exquisite. For this village to have such an inn, the village should be very prosperous.</p>
<p>“We don’t have many guests here anymore. Sir, you must be hungry from all the traveling. I’ll have my wife make you some food,” he said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll have to trouble Mr. Innkeeper,” Huangfu Chen said.</p>
<p>There were only two rooms under <em>tian</em>, and it could be seen that it was originally the same room, which was later separated into two. However, it was still clean, and the newly taken out mattress did not smell damp.</p>
<p>After the innkeeper left, Ye Zhen went to look for Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>“Master, don’t you think this inn is strange?” she asked in a low voice, “When you look at these pieces of furniture, which one is not a fine product, isn’t this a small village? How can there be such an inn?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said, “I also noticed it, I’ll go out to have a look in a moment, and you can go back to the room and rest.”</p>
<p>Since her master had said so, she could only go back to her room first. Not long after, the innkeeper brought them dinner. It was just some coarse food, but it seemed to be done very carefully.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen used a silver needle to try it out. There was no problem so she allowed Mei to eat with her.</p>
<p>After a day of traveling, she was also a little tired. However, she was still wary about the inn so did not dare to sleep until Huangfu Chen told her that there was nothing wrong. Only then did she finally relax and sleep.</p>
