            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 251 – Desperate to Marry (1)</strong></p>
<p>Marriage had its foundation in status and benefit than feelings and emotions. In a world run by power, the more influential one was, the longer one would last. And no one knew this better than the old matriarch of the Lu Family who had weathered many a storms.</p>
<p>Thus, when her eldest daughter-in-law willingly offered a middle ground, the Lu matriarch’s face softened a little. She looked at Lu Fang and said, “The Liang Family is not a good match. I’ll make the decision for you.”</p>
<p>Seeing that the wind was steering away from the course, Liu Shi was quick to interject, albeit with a sneer. “Mother, this marriage is Fang’er’s own request and not my arbitrary decision.”</p>
<p>Lu Yaoyao was the one that was meant to marry into the Liang Family, this was what her daughter had planned. And Liu Shi had rallied vehemently to see the matter through, only to incur the old madam’s wrath. So, this time around, she wanted to be sure that no one pointed fingers at her and conveniently pushed the blame on the girl’s shoulders.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu’s sharp gaze fell on Lu Fang. “Fang’er, is what your mother said true?”</p>
<p>The matriarch was all too familiar with Liu Shi’s methods. She would always look for ways to see through her plans, no matter how obstinate the impediments. So, she was inclined to believe that this was forced like it was in the case of Lu Yaoyao and sought clarification directly from the party involved.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, please allow us.” Lu Fang dropped to her knees and begged.</p>
<p>Lu Fang was many things, but delusional she was not. The Lu Family’s status was vastly different from a decade or so ago. From mere merchants to the position of nobility, was not lost on her. However, all this was for the <em><strong>family</strong></em>, not her. <em><strong>She</strong></em> was still an ordinary concubine born, a fatherless girl living under the mercy of the main wife. Who, in here, loved her? Who here cared about her?</p>
<p>She possessed neither the talent of her fourth sister nor the exceptional beauty of the third. There was already a wang fei, so what now, wait to be the empress? She knew her standing in the family and society in general. She was nothing but a pawn in this game of power and status. When such was the case, why not be one on her own terms?</p>
<p>If she missed this opportunity, she would never be the wife of a marquis. Even if she was to be a second wife, Marquis Liang had no son. In the future, she would be the main wife, one who managed the household. What she wanted most was such a status.</p>
<p>“Fang’er, what are you saying? There is no girl who asks for marriage like this. Are you worried that Mother will do you harm?” Lu Shixun frowned and reproached.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu looked at Lu Fang concernedly. “Have you thought this through?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gently tugged Lu Fang and said, “Second Sister, the Liang Family is not as good as you think. You should reconsider.”</p>
<p>“I have thought it over very well, Grandmother. Please~.” The Lu Fang who was until now kneeling, kowtowed.</p>
<p>It was not easy for her to let the eldest madam take charge of the marriage for her. She had been through a lot and was not just going to fail in the end. As long as she became the wife of the marquis, she would be able to fight for her mother, a concubine, in the future.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu said with a cold face, “If I don’t agree, will you blame me for obstructing this marriage? Even Yaoyao knows that the Liang Family is no good. Why can’t you understand when you are two years older than her?”</p>
<p>“Fang’er dares not,” Lu Fang said and held her head low.</p>
<p>“Since you are determined to marry into the Liang Family, I don’t want to provoke resentment in you. However, you have to bear and take responsibility for the good and bad days in the future. I will advise you once more. The Liang Family is not worthy of you. You go back and think about it. Come back to me with your answer tomorrow.” Old Madam Lu said.</p>
<p>Lu Fang’s dull eyes immediately lit up. “Yes, Grandmother.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took in every gesture of the girl who was earnestly imploring the elder … her eyes, the glistened imparts that blatantly said that she would not change her mind no matter how much time she’s given to reconsider. She admitted that this outcome was beyond her imagination. She had only wanted to use Lu Fang as a diversion to prevent Liu Shi from exploiting herself, but she did not expect Lu Fang would willingly want to marry into the Liang Family.</p>
<p>If being married into the Liang Family was really good engagement, why would Liu Shi just let Lu Fang marry this marquis? Indeed, she was up to no good. After all, Lu Fang was the daughter of her husband’s favorite concubine.</p>
