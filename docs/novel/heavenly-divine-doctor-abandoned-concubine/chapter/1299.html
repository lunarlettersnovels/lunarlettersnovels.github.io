            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 28 – To Become Famous (2)</h3>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Teacher Shan but saw that she was just smiling peacefully and seemed to have great confidence in her abilities.</p>
<p>Seeing that the atmosphere was somewhat heavy and tense, the gracious host, Madam Wu, smiled and said, “This year’s chrysanthemum blossoms have been very lovely. Why don’t we go and enjoy the chrysanthemum?”</p>
<p>“That’s a good suggestion.” Old Madam Lu was aware of the stares from those who looked down upon them secretly and who kept their distaste in their hearts. In return, she also disdained to deal with these kinds of two-faced people.</p>
<p>It was better to enjoy the flowers and be at ease someplace else than here.</p>
<p>However, Lu Fang and Lu Jing didn’t have the heart to leave, so they excused themselves and decided to stay behind to talk and socialize with the girls from other families. Ye Zhen held Old Madam Lu’s hand and assisted the latter out of the bamboo shed.</p>
<p>The group hadn’t walked more than just a few steps when they heard a shrill voice announcing:</p>
<p>“Wang Fei has arrived!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen held Madam Lu’s hand in surprise, a chill ran down her spine. The anger that she had suppressed in her heart was starting to boil, roaring like a wild beast ready to leap out of her chest.</p>
<p>Long-lost memories rushed to mind like spring water rushing out.</p>
<p><b><i>“Thank you Eldest Brother, you were able to gain Ye Zhen’s trust that she even confided her past with the emperor in you. If not for that, would the emperor ever think that I was that little girl who saved him?”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“Fortunately, I got her jade pendant in time. Ye Zhen is dead and everyone believes she committed suicide.”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“If she’s now in heaven and saw how the emperor dotes on me, she must vomit blood out of envy!”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“All that matters is that you, Shuang’er, are the wang fei and not her anymore.”</i></b></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s mind was filled with memories of the two years that passed with her as the wandering spirit. She had watched Lu Wushuang own her jade pendant instead of her. She had watched her being loved by Mo Rongzhan and how she laughed at Ye Zhen’s incompetence and stupidity when no one was around.</p>
<p>The most foolish thing she had done in her life was not only trusting Lu Lingzhi but also marrying Mo Rongzhan!</p>
<p>Aware of the sudden tensing of Ye Zhen beside her, Old Madam Lu thought she could be too nervous and smiled to soothe her. “Wang Fei is your cousin’s own sister. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I am… I am afraid I may displease the wang fei,” Ye Zhen said in a faint voice.</p>
<p>At first, Ye Zhen doubted whether Lu Wushuang still remembered her appearance. Her and Lu Wushuang’s status were very different back then.</p>
<p>They were only seven years old when they met once in Baihua and since then, they had never met again.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang couldn’t possibly recognize her. Ye Zhen found it amusing that Lu Wushuang had gained a place in Mo Rongzhan’s heart by using the knowledge of how she had rescued him.</p>
<p>In fact, she had not told Lu Lingzhi that much and so, it would not be difficult to expose Lu Wushuang’s true face. However, she did not want to have anything to do with Mo Rongzhan anymore. She didn’t even want him to know that it was her that had saved him.</p>
<p>Yes, when she was still ill and couldn’t meet him, she had buried a wooden box with her belongings in the place where she had saved him. She did not know if those things were still buried there; if the box was still there, she must go find and destroy it.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan no longer deserved her heart.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu returned to the bamboo shed. Everyone knelt and greeted Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gritted her teeth, bit back her anger, holding it down her throat. She willed herself to kneel along with Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>Once her knees touched the ground, she immediately felt the spreading of terrible pain, not from the discomfort of her knees kissing the rough ground but the pain she felt in her heart like needles piercing.</p>
<p>She knelt in front of the woman who had delivered her to her death. She felt great hatred but could only endure.</p>
<p>It was only Ye Zhen who knew what it was like to feel such pain…</p>
