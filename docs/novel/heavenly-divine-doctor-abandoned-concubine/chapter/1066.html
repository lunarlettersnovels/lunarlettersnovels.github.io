            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 263 – The Imperial Consorts (1)</strong></p>
<p>In the cold night wind, a lone figure walked towards the brightly lit Cining Palace.  Although a dainty form, the ramrod-straight back spoke volumes of the grit within. She had long let go of the matters of the library pagoda, as each step drew closer to the empress dowager’s dwelling, her mood was renewed. Such was the tenacity of Ye Zhen, undaunted she would stand tall to face anything that fate sent her way.</p>
<p>She had barely settled into the Cining Palace when in came the little prince.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, you swindler!” Just as Mo Rongyi saw the delicate figure, he immediately began to accuse her. “You said you will enter the palace to visit me, what happened?! I see that you don’t care whether I live or die. Return the silvers you ripped off this prince!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled not minding those words one bit. “Little Prince, there is no such trick. The silver is obviously mine, and there is no reason to give it back to you.”</p>
<p>“Humph!” A miffed Mo Rongyi turned away his head and ignored Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Moreover~” She continued with a smile. “It is just unfair when you say I don’t care whether you live or die when in fact I ask Imperial Physician Qi every day. And I know you’re well.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi glared at her. “Then why didn’t you enter the palace?” he asked, sulking. “You said you wanted to go hunting with me, but now I’m afraid you have forgotten.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and looked at the little boy’s ruddy face. Although his complexion was much better, he still looked too thin. “Hunting is not fun now, let’s wait until after spring.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager cast Mo Rongyi a displeased look. “You didn’t even know what Yaoyao did for you. What do you mean she did not think of you, didn’t she ask Imperial Physician Qi to bring you a lot of food?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi coughed lightly, caught in a spot, and somewhat losing his upper hand. “Imperial Mother, I’m just saying,” he said, trying to defuse the situation before it escalated.</p>
<p>“Don’t think that Aijia doesn’t know what you’re thinking. You just want to go out and play outside of the palace all day. It’s not that Aijia won’t let you go out. Well, if you can, you can tell your brother yourself,” said the empress dowager how to fix her son all too well.</p>
<p>“Emperor Brother just cares too much.” Mo Rongyi mumbled.</p>
<p>At the sight of the sulking little figure before her, Ye Zhen could not help but cover her mouth and laugh.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, if you dare to laugh at me again, I will not give you those seeds!” Mo Rongyi yelled as he threatened.</p>
<p><em>Seeds?!</em> Ye Zhen quickly thought back to what Mo Rongyi had promised her before. He was to send her seeds of a few precious herbs, she had almost forgotten about it! Instantly, her eyes brightened, and her glib tongue made to appease the peeved little royal. “Oh, Little Prince, I’m not laughing at you. You must be mistaken.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was still an innocent lad at heart, how could he hold grudges, especially against someone he truly considered his friend. He handed Ye Zhen a small embroidered pouch, not forgetting to take credit for himself. “It was not easy for me to get it from Old Master Jiang.”</p>
<p>“I’ve made a lot of food for you.” She shamelessly retorted. “You cannot ask silver from me in exchange for these seeds.” Saying so, she snatched the pouch over before he had the chance to take it away. When she peeked, she greeted by the sight of several different seeds. She immediately broke into a splendid smile and narrowed her eyes in mirth.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi angrily pointed at her, furious at being played. “You simply fell into the eyes of money!”</p>
<p>Amused at the antics of the duo before her, the empress dowager broked into a hearty laugh. Their innocence, naughtiness, and guileless rapport warmed her heart.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, you take care of that person who is not ladylike at all. She cannot open her mouth without talking about silver,” Mo Rongyi said with a grunt.</p>
<p>“I wonder who is still angry because of the silver.” Ye Zhen teased.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, I’m younger than you. Why do you argue with me? You are so shameless.” Mo Rongyi huffed, there was no way he could win over her quick wit, this was the only counter he could think of to shut her up.</p>
<p>“You are an imperial prince. How can you argue with an ordinary girl like me?” Ye Zhen asked with a smile. But before Mo Rongyi could get any angrier, she hastily appeased him. “All right, I will argue with you no more. Indeed, one should not argue with a child, only a few words and he is all riled up. Since you like hunting so much, let’s go after the New Year’s Festival. However, Her Highness the Empress Dowager must agree.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother~” Mo Rongyi eagerly turned to look at the empress dowager.</p>
<p>“If you take good care of yourself until that time comes, Aijia shall ask and have your emperor brother promise you,” the empress dowager said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, after spring, I will definitely gain weight and be healthier.” As he beamed with joy, the little prince instantly declared.</p>
<p>“Very well.” The empress dowager nodded with a smile.</p>
