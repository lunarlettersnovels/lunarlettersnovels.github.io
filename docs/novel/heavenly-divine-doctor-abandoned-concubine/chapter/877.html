            <p><strong>Chapter 452 – I Am Not Afraid (1)</strong></p>
<p>After Ten Li long Wu’s Bamboo Forest, Ye Zhen’s next stop was Qianjin. She wanted to look for Hong Ling to ask about Tian Jiu, but this time she didn’t see her. So she went to Jinkou City.</p>
<p>When she returned to the Lu Mansion, she was stopped by Lu Jing outside her courtyard..</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, I have something to tell you.” Lu Jing looked at the other coldly. In her heart, this girl was the villain who was robbing her of happiness.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Ye Zhen raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>The pair of cousins hadn’t spoken to each other in a long time. Even if they met, they would only say hello. Ever since she was given the title of a princess, Lu Jing had never worn a neutral let alone a friendly face whenever she saw her.</p>
<p>Lu Jing sneered and said, “What’s the matter, Your Royal Highness? Does one even have to ask for permission before they can even say a few words to you?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen got a little impatient with her peculiar tone, so she turned and walked into the courtyard. “Just come in and talk if you have something to say.”</p>
<p>“Princess, you are back.” Seeing her return, Dai Mei came over to curtsy happily.</p>
<p>“How is Hong Ying?” Ye Zhen asked Yu Ping.</p>
<p>Last time Hong Ying had gone to the hunting grounds with her. In order to allow her and the little prince to escape, she had also joined the guards in resisting the assassins and suffered serious injuries, and since then had been recovering in the Lu Mansion.</p>
<p>“Today she has been able to walk around. Her medicine was made by the princess herself after all, so she is recovering very well and keeps saying that she will kowtow to you,” Yu Ping said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said with a smile, “Why would she need to kowtow? Just tell her to get better as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Princess, this servant will serve you in cleaning up first.” Seeing that there was some dirt on Ye Zhen’s clothes, Yu Ping asked the other maids to fetch water.</p>
<p>Lu Jing coughed impatiently behind her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled at Yu Ping. “You go down first, my fourth sister and I have something to say.”</p>
<p>She brought the other to the study in the West Wing. “Fourth Sister, just tell me what you have to say.”</p>
<p>As soon as she entered the study, Lu Jing saw the silver whip hanging on the wall. She, who wanted the original owner of the silver whip, felt even more resentful. It turned out that Lu Yaoyao had already approached Tang Zhen with a goal since the beginning. <em>Otherwise how could she have won his silver whip?</em></p>
<p>“As a princess, don’t you have whatever you want?” Lu Jing wore a mocking smile as she glanced at the other with some disdain.</p>
<p>“Do you think I have what I want now?” Ye Zhen asked back, wondering why the other was uncomfortable and wanted to trouble her.</p>
<p>Lu Jing glanced at the silver whip on the wall. “You didn’t even need to speak, and the other party already sent it over to you. Lu Yaoyao, you already have a superior status, why do you want to grab Tang Zhen from me?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned. “Lu Jing, what do you want to say?”</p>
<p>“You are well aware of my feelings for Tang Zhen, why do you want the empress dowager to bestow a marriage for you two?” Lu Jing asked aloud.</p>
<p>“It turns out that you are looking for me today because of Tang Zhen.” Ye Zhen smiled faintly. “Not to mention that I don’t know what has happened, and whether the Empress Dowager has bestowed a marriage for me… But should I give you everything just because I am a princess?”(just because she has a higher title and Lu Jing doesn’t)</p>
<p>Lu Jing did not believe that Lu Yuyao didn’t know anything. “I’m not asking you to give way. I just hope you don’t always rob other people’s things.”</p>
<p>“What is yours?” Ye Zhen looked at her coldly, “Is Tang Zhen yours? Did I take something from you? Lu Jing, you are weak. It doesn’t mean that you are justified in wanting to have everything. I have no reason to leave him for you, not to say that Tang Zhen doesn’t even like you. If I really wanted to marry him, you think that if you came and talked to me unreasonably, I would give him to you? Fortunately, you are still studying. After reading books for the past few years, do you not even know what propriety, justice and shame are?” Ye Zhen asked curtly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by this?” Lu Jing’s expression changed as she glared.</p>
<p>“Fourth Sister, what are you doing now as a girl who hasn’t left the pavilion and hasn’t even gotten her marriage settled yet? Are you accusing me of stealing your sweetheart? This is the etiquette you have learned over the years? If your words today are spread around, you’ll never get a marriage offer,” Ye Zhen said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Lu Jing sneered and said, “Who can’t say sarcastic words? You rely on your identity as a princess, so you can have whatever you want. What about me? The old madam is partial to you and ignores me, and my parents are not around. Who cares about me? If I were a princess, would I be so?”</p>
<p>“So you want me to pity you and ask me to ask the empress dowager not to bestow upon me a marriage?” Ye Zhen’s cold eyes rested on the other as she asked. She didn’t like people like Lu Jing, just because she wasn’t as good as she wanted to be, so everyone else had to give in to her and care for her, otherwise it would be someone else’s fault. Such an ideology was both selfish and shameless.</p>
<p>“You have a distinguished status. Can’t you marry anyone you want to in the future? Why do you have to choose Tang Zhen?” Lu Jing asked reluctantly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head and chuckled. She still didn’t know what exactly had happened for her to be thought to be tied together in marriage with Tang Zhen. If it weren’t for Lu Jing coming to look for her, she wouldn’t have known about it. “So, you are in love with Tang Zhen?”</p>
