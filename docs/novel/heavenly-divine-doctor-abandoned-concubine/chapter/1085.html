            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 244 – Mention of an Old Friend (2)</strong></p>
<p>As if understanding her befuddlement, Ye Zhen glimpsed at Teacher Shan and said in a low voice, “True that Ye Yisong was guilty of a terrible crime but not everyone in the Ye Family deserved to die. Just what was the late wang fei’s offense? Why do people regard all of them as perpetrators of heinous crimes? I have never known them, but… I’ve always felt sorry for some members who were involved.”</p>
<p>Teacher Shan cast Ye Zhen a deep look.</p>
<p>“The wang fei herself wanted to marry the current emperor of the Qin Dynasty. At that time, Ye Yisong was hell-bent on supporting the crown prince. He originally wanted to marry off Ye Zhen to the crown prince. Later on, because of Ye Yiqing’s insistence, Ye Yisong threatened Emperor Mo Rongzhan by holding the army provisions at ransom and forced him to take Ye Zhen as his wife.” Then, her voice dropped to a melancholic whisper. “Ye Zhen was… an amazing woman. Unfortunately, she loved the wrong person.”</p>
<p>A desolate silence engulfed the room, Teacher Shan looked vacantly at the burning fire.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s love for Mo Rongzhan could be said to be many things but never selfish. She had defied her family’s will and wish, she had unheeded her teacher’s advice, but she was wholehearted and selfless in loving him. If anyone was to fault her, it would be for losing herself to the wrong man. Neither was her love valued nor was she acknowledged. In the end, her death was in vain.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen never knew that her uncle had threatened Mo Rongzhan. She thought that Mo Rongzhan was willing to marry her for he was moved by her sincerity and persistence… It turned out to be so.</p>
<p>“Teacher, I’m going to find Tang Zhen. This matter has nothing to do with you. You can’t be dismissed from the academy because of this.” saying so, Ye Zhen stood up.</p>
<p>“No need.” Teacher Shan stopped her. “No matter who wants me to leave the academy, there is only one purpose. One just doesn’t want me to stay with you. That is, they don’t want me to continue being on your side. It would still be useless if you look for Tang Zhen. I am Ye Zhen’s teacher, after all, there are many in the capital who want me to disappear.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wanted to go find Mo Rongzhan badly to settle the matter with him, but she knew better, with her status right now, she had no right to question him.</p>
<p>“Teacher, then… will you really resign and leave the academy?”</p>
<p>“What is there to complain about? I’ve longed to travel around. Since I cannot stay in the capital, I’d better go elsewhere,” Teacher Shan said lightly.</p>
<p>She was able to arrive at the Lu Mansion at her master’s behest. She had formed a strong bond with the girl before her, much to her astonishment. Thereafter she had joined the academy. None of this was without her master’s knowledge. Now, although she did not want to leave, she had to. There was nothing she could do to change it, and her master would certainly have no reason to blame her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen could hardly calm herself. Because she spoke of the Ye Family in front of Mo Rongzhan, he had ordered Tang Zhen to investigate her. Now, he was banishing Teacher Shan… strong-arming people in her life. What right did he have to rob people of their will? She so wanted to crush him right now!</p>
<p>Teacher Shan looked at Ye Zhen and said, “I shall be leaving the capital tomorrow. There is something I want to tell you.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, do you really not want to stay?” Ye Zhen asked helplessly.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, it is not that I don’t want to stay, nor do I blame you for this. As early as I returned to the capital, I expected this day would come. Everyone knows I am Ye Zhen’s teacher.” Teacher Shan revealed a smile.</p>
<p>She had accepted all this with great calm. As much as she was sentimental, she was prudent. She did want to avenge her student, each day the fire in her grew, but she was not impulsive.</p>
<p>She knew her position, weighed her pros and cons, and concluded that it would do her better to bide time for now; the opportunity had yet to present itself.</p>
<p>“If I had not mentioned the Ye Family in front of others, I would have not caused you trouble.” Ye Zhen regretted that she had argued with Tang Zhen about the Ye Family.</p>
<p>“Even if you hadn’t mentioned, as long as I am Ye Zhen’s teacher, others will always be suspicious.” Teacher Shan paused, her deep gaze concealing her thoughts. “Yaoyao, tell me the truth, have you met His Majesty the Emperor?”</p>
<p>“Why do you ask this?” Ye Zhen was surprised at the mention of Mo Rongzhan.</p>
