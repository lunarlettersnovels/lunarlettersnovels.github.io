            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 213 – The Little Prince’s Vigor (2)</strong></p>
<p>Before the empress dowager returned to the Cining Palace, she had already heard from Aunt Cheng that Lu Wushuang was under confinement.</p>
<p>“For three months?” The empress dowager was surprised. <i>Didn’t the emperor like Lu Wushuang very much? Why is she confined?</i></p>
<p>“What exactly happened last night?” she asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>“When a maiden was seen in the middle of the night, Wang Fei took her entourage to the Palace of Heavenly Purity. The retainers have been sent to the Imperial Household Department for investigation. Several of Wang Fei Lu’s confidants were executed by flogging, leaving only Dai Ping alive.” Aunt Cheng reported.</p>
<p>“The emperor ordered the execution of retainers?” The empress dowager gasped in surprise. <i>What was the emperor thinking? Does he still expect Lu Lingzhi to suppress the rebellion in the western buffer region? Why is he angry with Lu Wushuang at this point in time?</i></p>
<p>Aunt Cheng nodded gently. “It was the emperor’s edict.”</p>
<p>“Were you able to find out what happened at the emperor’s residence last night?” she frowned and asked.</p>
<p>“This servant could not find out.”</p>
<p>This matter must have been put under control by the emperor himself. No wonder, there was not the slightest tittle-tattle even after such a long time.</p>
<p>The empress dowager didn’t say anything more. Shortly after, Mo Rongzhan himself arrived.</p>
<p>“Your Highness.” After a curtsy, Mo Rongzhan took a seat beside his mother.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden, His Majesty is asking Aijia to take over the affairs of the Inner Palace. Tell me, what really happened?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan pursed his lips and shot Aunt Cheng a light look. Taking the cue, she bowed and walked out of the room with the others, leaving the room to just the mother and son.</p>
<p>“Mother, yesterday my eyes incessantly shed tears… ”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan spoke in a whisper and recounted the events from last night, including the fact that he had no intention of eating the medicated meal and eventually asked Ye Zhen to attend to his eyes.</p>
<p>“Lu Wushuang was jealous and thought that I was bestowing special favors to a palace maid. Despite the obstruction, she still barged into the Palace of Heavenly Purity. I’m simply teaching her a lesson.”</p>
<p>“How are your eyes now?” She asked after what she’s most concerned about.</p>
<p>“Now, my eyesight is clearer than before. The uneasiness is gone as well.” Mo Rongzhan told her honestly.</p>
<p>The empress dowager patted her chest and said, “Fortunately, Yaoyao’s medicated diet is harmless to your eyes, otherwise you…” Not continuing her words, she lightly laughed. “Aijia thinks Yaoyao is really a person of good fortune. She has just entered the palace, and has taken good care of both yours and the Little Prince’s health.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan snorted coldly, as he thought of the young miss who had shunned him.</p>
<p>“Ah, about the girls you asked Aijia to choose… do you not need to look at it yourself? “</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager is in charge,” he said flatly.</p>
<p>As far as Mo Rongzhan was concerned, he did not care whether the woman selected would be charming or not. After all, women who entered the emperor’s palace… were they not solely for the purpose of balancing the powers of the Imperial Court?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>News of Lu Wushuang’s confinement in accordance with the emperor’s edict did not remain concealed for long–soon it spread like wildfire, all over the palace, reaching the ears of commoners and nobles alike.</p>
<p>Having witnessed it the previous night, Ye Zhen was barely surprised, it was an eventuality of course. Instead, she felt bouts of disappointment.</p>
<p>All along, she had considered Lu Wushuang as the most formidable foe. She thought it would take years to sow discord, have her fall out of favour and bring her down along with the entire Lu Family.</p>
<p>However, it took her only a few days of residing inside the imperial palace.</p>
<p>With the wang fei’s confinement, one thing became clear to everyone–the emperor no longer doted on Lu Wushuang. As much as it came as a surprise to all, the royals were eccentric, to begin with. And history was ample proof. How many beauties were raised to the pedestal only to crumble and turn to dust?!</p>
<p>However, to Ye Zhen, this abrupt change was no less than a conundrum. She’d seen the way he held her in the palm of his hands; two years the sight had stung, pierced, and jabbed her. And now, just like that, it had all washed away…like it had never existed… <i>why?</i></p>
<p><i>Was it because he found out that Lu Wushuang was not the little girl who saved him, and therefore he turned cold and indifferent towards her?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s mood turned sour. Mo Rongzhan, suddenly giving her attention, was uncalled for. However, she knew in her heart that he acted as such for he was unaware of who she really was. If Mo Rongzhan knew that she was Ye Zhen, his former Wang Fei, he probably… wouldn’t fawn over her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled wryly as she stared silently at a tall pagoda in the distance. Built during the reign of Emperor Wu of the former dynasty, it housed a collection of books owned by Empress Qi Yanling. A century had passed, and yet, the place looked as elegant and tranquil as ever. Indeed, it was well-preserved.</p>
<p>What made it more fascinating was its exclusivity–no one, except the successive emperors,  had ever been able to enter the pagoda.</p>
<p>“That’s the library pagoda.” Qi Jin walked slowly from behind, following her gaze. She seemed to know her thoughts. “It is home to the collection of books from the Baicao Tang Medical Sect in the old days.” She added.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen suddenly turned to look at Qi Jin. “Baicao Tang?”</p>
<p><i>Baicao Tang, the guild the greatest Divine Doctor in history belonged to? </i>She had never known that Empress Qi Yanling had something to do with the Baicao Tang Medical Sect.</p>
<p>“At that time, Empress Duanhui had left the books in the hands of her most trusted imperial guard, a disciple of the Baicao Tang Medical Sect, for safekeeping. The treasure was subsequently passed down to the new generation of disciples, and protected at the secret cove where the Jiang Family went to seclusion. It was there that it was transcribed too.” She let out a deep sigh, nostalgic over the past. “If you can take a look at those materials, it will definitely enhance your medical skills.” The veteran smiled, still looking at the pagoda longingly.</p>
<p>“Empress Qi Yanling must be a book lover.” Ye Zhen muttered to herself. <i> If not… I don’t think the collection of books in the library pagoda would have been preserved until now.</i></p>
<p>Qi Jin smiled gently. “The medical skills I learned were from the collection of books I have at home. You have to ascend a flight of stairs after you enter to take a look at the books.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips and mumbled after a while. “Is it possible for students to enter the library pagoda?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps fate is needed as well.”</p>
<p>Those simple words carried profound meaning, one that would compel to mull.</p>
<p><i>What kind of fate must one have to enter the library pagoda?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen was about to ask Qi Jin when suddenly, Aunt Cheng appeared. She was forced to swallow her query. <i>Her curiosity shall be sated another time</i>, she surmised.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu.” She greeted Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Aunt Cheng.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen thought that Aunt Cheng was here for Qi Jin, hence she hurriedly dismissed herself. “Imperial Physician Qi Jin, this student will go back first.”</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, the empress dowager wants to have a word with you,” Aunt Cheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was out for words. <i>The empress dowager is looking for me? </i></p>
<p>“Well… “</p>
<p>Qi Jin smiled and patted the back of Ye Zhen’s hand. “Well then, go,” she said, encouragingly.</p>
