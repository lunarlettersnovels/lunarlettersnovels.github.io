            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 203 – Summoned At Midnight</strong></p>
<p>The full moon shone brightly in the night sky, the gentle breeze cooled the air; the palace was enjoying the peace and quiet even as its people with peony lanterns walked around silently like wandering souls.</p>
<p>But not all was peaceful tonight.</p>
<p>At the moment, the Palace of Earthly Tranquility was nothing like its name. The mistress was restless, the attendants on tenterhooks.</p>
<p>After throwing a temper tantrum, Lu Wushuang was now tossing and turning in her bed, but sleep still evaded her. Seldom has a worried heart slumbered serenely.</p>
<p>She had waited for a long time, but Mo Rongzhan never came. She sent someone to spy on him and gathered that he would be staying in the Palace of Heavenly Purity again. She felt a knot in her heart. Her anxieties of him being charmed by another woman resurfaced. Mo Rongzhan, however, was not with any woman. She did not know what to feel– happy that there was no one or angry for he had not even visited her chambers recently.</p>
<p>How long had it been since he had visited her? If this were to continue, she was afraid she would lose track of time.</p>
<p><i>Would he rather be in his palace than come to her?</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>At this time, there was one other place that the nocturnal placidity had not managed to breach: The Palace of Heavenly Purity.</p>
<p>After perusing the pile of palace memorials<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1">[mfn]an official communication to the Emperor of China[/mfn]</sup>, Mo Rongzhan was exhausted. Soon, he changed his clothes and decided to go to bed. However, just as he laid down, his eyes suddenly pricked. At first, he thought he had dust in his eyes, but the incessant watering seemed to say otherwise.</p>
<p>Ever since his eyes saw the light again, this had never happened. He was visibly shocked.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, are you all right?” Eunuch Fu rushed in horrified. He had been around Mo Rongzhan the longest and had yet to see him shed a drop of tear let alone a river like now. The man was stoic and never once wore his heart on his sleeve.</p>
<p>“Go to the prince’s residence. If Little Prince is fine, bring Lu Yaoyao here.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan grabbed a white cloth and covered his eyes. As his mind raced to seek the reason behind this strange occurrence, he went through the happenings of the day. He soon came to the conclusion, today was just like any other day. He did his usual work, went to the usual places, met the usual people. Even the food he had was no different. Everything was the same… except for his dinner.</p>
<p>As he thought, he narrowed down to the only explanation to his present condition: the medicated diet he had taken not too long ago.</p>
<p>He ate the same food as the little prince… <i>but if Yi is fine after eating it, the problem must have not come from the medicated diet.</i></p>
<p><i>But why do my eyes keep shedding tears after eating it?</i></p>
<p><i>Only Lu Yaoyao can answer this.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<div data-fuse="22037344116" data-fuse-code="fuse-slot-22037344116-1" data-fuse-slot="71161633/WORD_wordexcerpt/chapter_incontent_2"></div>
<p>She felt her body stirring, someone was calling out to her. She tried to open her eyes, but they felt heavy. With all her might she forced them open.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was awakened from her deep sleep, her eyes still a bit bleary. She tried to orient herself, she had no idea what was happening.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, wake up… Miss Lu, wake up.”</p>
<p>“Madam Nuan?”</p>
<p>When she came about, she could clearly see the person who was gently shaking her awake. Then, as if struck by a lightning sat bolt upright on high alert. This lady, coming in at this time of the hour meant only one thing…</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? Did something happen to the little prince?” she asked, hurriedly.</p>
<p>“No, the little prince has fallen asleep.” Madam Nuan assured her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was about to sigh in relief when she heard the other whisper.</p>
<p>“Eunuch Fu came to invite you to the Palace of Heavenly Purity.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her in shock, her settling heart was stirred again. “Palace of Heavenly Purity?”</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, hurry up and change your clothes.”</p>
<p>Madam Nuan could not guess why Ye Zhen was summoned to the Palace of Heavenly Purity at midnight, however, Eunuch Fu’s solemn face was a sign that something must have happened.</p>
<p><i>Mo Rongzhan… </i>She could not help grit her teeth. <i>What does he want? Summoning her to his chambers late at night… If word of this were to spread out, what would people think of her? No, this won’t do, she had to find a way around it.</i></p>
<p>“Madam Nuan, what did Eunuch Fu say?” Ye Zhen’s face turned pale. She wanted to gather as much information to help her come up with an apt excuse.</p>
<p>“Eunuch Fu went to see Little Prince a while ago and asked him if he felt anything strange after eating the medicated meal. Miss Lu, do not worry it is not what you think,” Madam Nuan said in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>Well, one could not fault Ye Zhen here. Given the circumstances, most people would think just like her. After all, the emperor had suddenly asked her to come to him. Whoever the maiden, being invited at this hour at night, one could only think of one thing:<i> that</i>.</p>
<p>Like the former emperors, did they not let palace maids enter their chambers in the middle of the night to serve them in bed?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen finally calmed down at Madam Nuan’s reassurance. The emperor must have another reason for calling her. Mo Rongzhan was many things, but unscrupulous. If he really wanted her, he would not use such an underhanded means. After all, she was not an ordinary maiden but the daughter of the Lu Family.</p>
<p>“Then I shall go,” Ye Zhen said softly, knowing well she had no choice but to abide by the emperor’s order.</p>
<p>Putting on the warm clothes the head maid gave her, Ye Zhen tied her hair in a simple bun and went out. When he saw her walking out, all dressed up, Eunuch Fu did not say anything–just looked at her with complicated eyes.</p>
<p>“Eunuch Fu, what is the matter that the emperor ordered you to personally bring me this late at night?” Ye Zhen saw that he was alone, without his subordinates. <i>He must have been ordered to keep it discreet.</i></p>
<p>“Miss Lu, please, there is not a moment to lose.” Eunuch Fu did not mask the urgency in his tone.</p>
