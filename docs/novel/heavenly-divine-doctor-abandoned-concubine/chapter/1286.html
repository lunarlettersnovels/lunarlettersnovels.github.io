<p>Even before Ye Zhen claimed her prize by piercing the arrow deep into the deer’s head, the men around had already settled their bets– that is on their comrade, Tang Zhen. That was why, their jaws hit the ground as soon as the silver whip was handed to Ye Zhen as a token of her victory!</p>
<p>It was simply unthinkable! Tang Zhen was already the best among them in archery.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8">
<div class="orp-player-wrapper aspectRateFixed orp-player-ipm orp-player-ipm-hidden defaultTag notMobile force-hide-player"></div>
<p></p><center><p></p>
<div id="adplus"></div>
<p></p></center></div>
<p><i>How could he lose to a little girl?</i></p>
<p><i>Or, had he intentionally given way to Ye Zhen?</i></p>
<p>Oh, but in all truth, Tang Zhen was guilty as charged. He was so mesmerized by the Young Miss Lu that his attention was solely spent on her grace the whole time they were hunting.</p>
<p>Yet, he felt impressed, nonetheless, for Ye Zhen could easily be referred to as the best woman archer in the capital. She was remarkable!</p>
<p>Amidst the bustle, Lu Lingzhi was silent in one corner as he watched the events unveil. Seeing his third sister attract too much attention and thus, making herself be acknowledged, he sighed helplessly. He was still afraid that her being the spitting image of the late wang fei would bring her trouble.</p>
<p>He could only hope that word of her resemblance would not reach Lu Wushuang’s ears. Or else, his beloved sister would not be able to hold in her grudge and Ye Zhen would be hurt in no time.</p>
<p>One of his comrades tapped him on his back, so Lu Lingzhi hid his disappointment quickly and temporarily eased down the worries which lingered on his mind. Just like anyone else, he was also infected with a smile the moment he saw the tiny frame of Ye Zhen ride away to a distance where rabbits were holed up.</p>
<p>It was near sundown when Ye Zhen returned to the group bringing with her two rabbits. She looked for Lu Xiangzhi to boast her hunt, but then she saw someone else instead.</p>
<p>Not far from where she stood was the proud figure of Lu Lingzhi, who was in the act of pulling an arrow to shoot a black hawk soaring in mid-air.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes flashed, her blood boiled and she was again driven with anger and hurt.</p>
<p>She looked back at the men and saw everyone was in the heat of the hunt, including Lu Xiangzhi who was deeply absorbed in hunting a doe.</p>
<p>With shaking hands, she took hold of her arrow and aimed it at the black hawk as well.</p>
<p><i>If only I could kill him..</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart beat faster, and the excitement of seeking revenge filled her senses. Not a day after her death did she not want to kill Lu Lingzhi herself, in cold blood. Now, she had a chance laid in front of her.</p>
<p>The only thing she had to do next was to seize this chance.</p>
<p>Her arrow slowly moved down until it aimed at the back of Lu Lingzhi’s head.</p>
<p>She drew the bow and the arrow shot up.</p>
<p><i>Go to hell!</i></p>
<p>Just as she thought her revenge would now take its end course, a black arrow interjected with the arrow she shot, causing it to miss Lu Lingzhi’s head, wounding his arm instead. Ye Zhen was stunned, the source of the arrow she didn’t know yet.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, are you all right?” Ye Zhen concealed her disappointment, face drawn in concern.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s arm was drenched with his own blood. Throughout the haze of pain, he looked at Ye Zhen’s pale face who looked back at him with panic and fear.</p>
<p>He turned to see a white rabbit hidden in the grass not far from him. It could be that his third sister was already tired from hunting too long. Or, it could be that she really abhorred him for a reason he didn’t know.</p>
<p>“If Third Sister is tired, she should rest.” Tang Zhen came out from the other side. He had just deflected Ye Zhen’s arrow. If not for him, Lu Lingzhi could have been dead right at this moment.</p>
<p>Hearing of the accident, Lu Xiangzhi sprinted towards Lu Lingzhi, his face reflecting the dread he saw. “Eldest Brother! Yaoyao, she didn’t do it on purpose!”</p>
<p>“I know she didn’t mean to do it. She’s tired today. Please take her home first,” Lu Lingzhi said, ignoring the pain from his bleeding arm. Several men gathered to help him.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, let me dress your wound first,” said Lu Xiangzhi.</p>
<p>“Don’t fret! This is only a minor injury.” Lu Lingzhi became worried when he saw his third sister’s shaking form.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi nodded, left the men to aid his eldest brother and led Ye Zhen out of the woods.</p>
