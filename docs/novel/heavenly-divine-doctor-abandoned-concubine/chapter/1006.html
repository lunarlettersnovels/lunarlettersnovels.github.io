            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 323 – Huangfu Chen Teaches</strong></p>
<p>From the time the former emperor had been stupid and useless, there had already been a large number of people that had hoped the Huangfu Family would take over the empire. No one doubted Huangfu Chen’s abilities. If it hadn’t been that Huangfu Chen had no desire for the empire, perhaps… it wouldn’t be the Mo Family sitting on the imperial throne.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen was a legend. A legend people couldn’t help but sigh in wonder at.</p>
<p>Now that this legend was at their school, how could they not be excited?</p>
<p>There were many people in the capital that had yet to glimpse the shadow of Huangfu Chen but had already heard of his god-like art of healing*. Also, his divination abilities that almost allowed him to see the future were no less awe-inspiring. In their hearts, his existence was akin to that of a deity’s.</p>
<p>[* qǐ sǐ huí shēng- to rise from the dead (idiom); fig. an unexpected recovery]</p>
<p>But, despite knowing Huangfu Chen was extraordinary, they still had not anticipated he would be so good-looking. When he appeared in the school dressed in a moonlight white robe, he was greeted with silence.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen didn’t acknowledge those around him, gracefully stepping into the school. His eyes were gentle and smooth like jade, his figure long and sculpted. ‘A gentleman like jade’ was perhaps written to describe him.</p>
<p>Even Ye Zhen felt her heart pinch as she watched him walk by the forest. A person like this… <em>what kind of girl would be able to stand by his side in the future?</em></p>
<p>There were dozens of students in the School of Medicine. In no particular order, they were all arranged to be seated on the grass. Huangfu Chen would teach a day every month. As for how much the students could get out of it, that would depend on their own understanding.</p>
<p>Seeing the captivated students, Master Qin couldn’t help but complain to Qi Jin, “Are these students here to learn or to look at your nephew? I see few have learned something.”</p>
<p>Qi Jin just smiled lightly. Looking at Huangfu Chen, who was teaching, she felt a sense of pride rise in his heart.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sat on the grass. This was her first time listening to Huangfu Chen teach. Hearing his smooth, flowing voice, and seeing his jade-like face, she felt fortunate that she had already met him a couple of times. Otherwise, she would probably be like the others, drowned in her astonishment of him.</p>
<p>“You are already a princess. Why do you still come to the school?” someone asked Ye Zhen quietly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked back to see who it was Gao Xueping.  She slightly smiled. ” What, can’t princesses come to the school?”</p>
<p>Gao Xueping clenched her teeth, glaring at Ye Zhen with hatred. Previously, she had always been sure that she would be able to defeat the latter. But as of today… she no longer had that kind of confidence.</p>
<p>Princess Royal had been reduced to a commoner. The Gao Family had been almost entangled in that affair.  All these years, they had always survived by depending on Princess Royal. Now that she had been compromised, their family would inevitably be affected.</p>
<p><em>She had to become an imperial physician! She couldn’t lose to Lu Yaoyao.</em></p>
<p>”You already hold a high position., why do you still need to partake in the examination?” Gao Xueping asked. She couldn’t understand where Lu Yaoyao got her luck from. How had she let the empress dowager value her so much?</p>
<p>“Do you really think that if I don’t take the exam, you will definitely be able to become an imperial physician?” Ye Zhen asked back.</p>
<p>Gao Xueping’s expression changed. “Lu Yaoyao, do you really want to sabotage me?”</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about? Why is it that all that you ever think about is sabotaging others or others sabotaging you?” Ye Zhen scoffed. “You are not worth those dirty tricks.”</p>
<p>“You…!” Gao Xueping’s eyes grew red with rage. This was her first time clearly feeling that Lu Yaoyao had never seen her as anything.</p>
<p>“Listen to the lesson.” Ye Zhen didn’t want to keep wasting time with her. She turned to listen attentively to Huangfu Chen’s lesson.</p>
<p>The four-hour lecture was about to end. Many students had yet to react, totally immersed in the tutor’s charisma.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled and looked at them. “Our afternoon lesson is in the medicinal herb grounds. Everyone, first go and eat.”</p>
<p>All the students left reluctantly. Ye Zhen walked to Huangfu Chen’s side after everyone had left and bowed in greeting. “Mister Chen, when are you going to divinate for me?”</p>
<p>“You were serious?” Huangfu Chen lowered his eyes to look at her. These days, he had always wanted to solve the mystery of her horoscope. But the more he calculated, the more he felt that her fortune was blurry, and couldn’t be clearly understood.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen playfully smiled. “Of course.”</p>
<p>“All right then,” Huangfu Chen smiled and said, “I live in the bamboo forest in Shiliwu. You can go find me when you have time.”</p>
<p>“I have to go to class tomorrow. I’ll go see you in a couple of days,” Ye Zhen said immediately.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled and bowed his head. “Then I will humbly await Your Highness’s arrival.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, you are making fun of me,” Ye Zhen said awkwardly. She had only gained the title of Princess, nothing else had changed.</p>
<p>“How would I be making fun of you? Haven’t you already become Princess?” Huangfu Chen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Although I am a Princess….” Ye Zhen lowered her eyes, hiding the bitterness deep within them. “Mister Chen, I will definitely go see you in a couple of days. I’ll first leave now.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen lightly nodded. Seeing Ye Zhen’s departing figure, he furrowed his brows in slight confusion. <em>Why was it that… he felt this little girl seemed to have many secrets?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen left the grass field. She hadn’t walked for long before she saw a familiar figure standing in front of her. She frowned and walked over.</p>
<p>“It seems like I have always underestimated you.” Gao Xueping laughed coldly and said, looking at Ye Zhen, “Someone who grew up in the countryside could become Princess, and be so close to Mister Chen… I am humbled by your ploys.”</p>
<p>“Gao Xueping, what are you trying to say?” Ye Zhen flatly asked. She didn’t like Gao Xueping.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, when Gao Xueping had looked down on Sun Wen, to the time where she had mocked others, she had felt that there was something twisted about her character. As of today, Gao Xueping had somehow gotten the idea that she was her enemy.</p>
<p>Gao Xueping laughed coldly. “The examinations are based on skill. If someone like you, who tries to win through kissing up, defeats me, I will not accept it.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed and said, “Miss Gao, are you mistaken? Why would I care whether or not you accept it? Even if you do not, would it change the fact that I won?”</p>
<p>Gao Xueping angrily glared at Ye Zhen. “We’ll see about that!”</p>
