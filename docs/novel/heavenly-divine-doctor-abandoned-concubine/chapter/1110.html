            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 218 – Leaving the Palace (1)</strong></p>
<p>The hall, once the ‘storm’ had passed, descended into silence. The remaining members collectively breathed a furtive sigh of relief.</p>
<p>However, at Madam Lu’s exit, Old Madam Lu sighed heavily and shook her head. This daughter-in-law had always given her headaches. She felt it was better when she used to be ill, now she was really getting out of hand.</p>
<p>She looked at Lu Shiming and said, “Your Elder Sister-in-law is such a misfit. Forget what she has said, and don’t take it to heart.”</p>
<p>“Mother, we would not argue with Elder Sister-in-law.” Lu Shiming faintly smiled.</p>
<p>Normally, he did not mind such things, treating them as trivial. It was not the first time his Elder Sister-in-law had behaved so he was used to it. However, with matters pertaining to his child, no matter who he had to face, he would not let them be wronged in the slightest.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu sighed and spoke in a low voice. “The Wang Fei in the palace has the same temperament as her. This time she is forbidden by the emperor. Perhaps she has also made a mistake.”</p>
<p>Instantly, Pei Shi’s thoughts went to her daughter who was still in the palace. She anxiously asked, “Mother, Yaoyao is still in the palace. Will she… be affected by this?”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu considered for a moment before replying. “Yaoyao will not be involved. I heard that she is with the empress dowager. Nothing untoward could happen.”</p>
<p>Although Pei Shi was unconvinced, she still concealed her worries and reassured Old Madam Lu. “Mother, please do not worry about it either. Let the Third Master secretly ask around about it tomorrow, and he will let us know.”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was away quelling the rebellion. Now Old Madam Lu could only depend upon Lu Shiming.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming said, “Mother, Second Brother’s arrival will be delayed for a while. He should be in the capital in two days. He will come back. There are many of us in our family who can take matters in our hands. You do not have to worry too much.”</p>
<p>At the mention of her second son, Old Madam Lu’s eyes smiled. “I don’t know what caught him halfway. If he does not make it to my birthday, I will not concern myself with him.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming replied with a smile. “Mother, please put your heart at ease. Second Brother is the most filial. He will return before your birthday.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu revealed a smile.</p>
<p>Pei Shi agreed and said, “Mother, you should take your rest. Do not worry about other things these days. Recently, you said that you have been feeling dizzy and tired.”</p>
<p>“Well… well, I shall listen to you. Go to bed now.” Old Madam Lu heeded her daughter-in-law’s concern with a smile.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>It had been two nights since Ye Zhen’s stay in the palace. She was all set to return to the academy the following day.</p>
<p>Looking back, she was quite satisfied with the two days. Except for a certain someone’s presence, she could say her time here had been satisfactory. She was able to see her nemesis stumble, repay the kindness she was once shown, and to an extent set right the wrong her kin had brought about. Yes, she felt good.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had tried her best to incorporate the miraculous liquid into the medicated meals of Mo Rongyi for these two days. Needless to say, the miraculous liquid had worked its miracles; the Little Prince’s complexion returned to its ruddiness, gone was his pains and spasms. He still looked very thin, but he was eating well and feeling spirited. On the whole, he was progressing at a good rate.</p>
<p>“These are the dried meat I made for you. You can have some everyday. Some candied fruits that I’ve soaked in medicinal juice, you can eat one after taking your medicine.” Ye Zhen went about explaining to Mo Rongyi.</p>
<p>Every one of those things had the miraculous liquid. She was concerned that upon her departure from the palace, Mo Rongyi would not be able to take the miraculous liquid, and hence, she had made these to make do. This would ensure he would consume the liquid every day, for as long as they lasted.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi gestured to Madam Nuan to take the snacks and said with a smile, “This prince looks fine now. Imperial Physician Qi said that there is no need to take medicine in another two days.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen flashed a smile. “That is good news! I can be at ease and go to class tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Are you already leaving the palace?” Mo Rongyi frowned as he looked at her. “Then no one will accompany this prince anymore?”</p>
<p>“When His Highness recovers, he still has to attend classes in his study. Someone will have to accompany him there,” Ye Zhen said and continued in jest, “If His Highness were to go out of the palace, I could still go hunting with him, but he must not cry when he loses.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi cried in great anger. “Lu. Yao. Yao, how dare you look down upon me!”</p>
<p>“Well, well, I wonder who fell into the trap in the woods the last time. If it were not for the girl who happened to pass by…” Ye Zhen teased Mo Rongyi.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao! Just wait until I fully recover!” The young and puerile boy’s face was chafed. “This prince will certainly win against you. Just wait!” He declared with a face wreathed with determination.</p>
