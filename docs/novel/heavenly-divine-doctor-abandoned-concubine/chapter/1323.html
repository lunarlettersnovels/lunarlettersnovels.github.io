            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 4 – Her Return (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, are you awake?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had a splitting headache when she heard a woman calling her attention beside her. She tried to open her eyes but was welcomed with an onslaught of light. In the beginning, her vision was unfocused and vague, but she was still able to make out the worried face of a woman.</p>
<p>Looking at the unfamiliar woman in front of her eyes, she tried to remember who she was but found she didn’t know her at all.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Ye Zhen asked.</p>
<p>The woman was shocked to hear those words. “Yaoyao, can’t you even remember your own mother?”</p>
<p><i>Yaoyao? She just called me by my nickname. Wasn’t I dead? Why am I here?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt her limbs were weak as a baby, her head was getting more and more painful as she tried to regain consciousness. Suddenly, her mind was inundated with images and then, it went blank just like that. Her face turned ghostly white, she plunged back into darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen woke up again, three days had already passed. But her mind hadn’t been idle these few days; she had remembered many things.</p>
<p>She looked at the canopy of the bed calmly, albeit a little dazed and feeling a little ridiculous at her current situation.</p>
<p>She had actually come back to life and became Lu Shiming’s adopted daughter! Lu Shiming was Lu Lingzhi’s uncle, and she… she was reborn in her twin sister’s body. She couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by the thought.</p>
<p><i>Ah, yes, her twin sister!</i> Mentioning her was a taboo in the Ye Family.</p>
<p>She only found out about her twin sister when her grandmother died. Their family had believed in the Taoist monk’s words that they could only raise one of the twins or else, their family would come to ruin. So, her grandmother sent her twin sister away, out of their reach.</p>
<p>As for where her sister was sent away, only her grandmother knew of it. After all, her grandmother had kept the secret to herself all her life. She had quietly taken care of her sister and in the end, she allowed the child to be adopted by Lu Shiming. Last month, Lu Shiming returned to the capital with her. His adopted daughter was in a coma for half a month because of a serious heart ailment. And when she woke up, she was no longer Lu Yaoyao-Ye Zhen was reborn in her body.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen finally understood why her mother had been so indifferent to her for so many years when she knew she had a twin sister who had been sent away. Now, she had robbed her sister of her body and had no chance to reunite with her or to even say a word.</p>
<p>However, she knew that her sister had a wonderful life. She was taken good care by Lu Shiming and his wife and was also attended by her grandmother from time to time. At the very least, what Ye Zhen saw in her sister’s memory were only happy times, she hadn’t suffered any grievances. This made her feel relieved if only a little bit.</p>
<p>Looking at the mirror not too far from her bed, it was no doubt that she had entered her sister’s twin body. She covered her face with her hands, myriad emotions pouring out of her.</p>
<p><i>How did everything turn out this way?</i></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, what’s the matter? Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>Deep in her thoughts, Ye Zhen did not notice when a 17 or 18-year-old boy entered her chambers. She recalled the memories of her sister and him in the past thirteen years.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned to look at him. She learned from her sister’s memory that the boy was Lu Shiming’s son and her sister’s legal brother. They had been close to each other since childhood, almost inseparable. He had been a good brother to her twin. Only after she discovered this did she reveal a little smile.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, why are you here?”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi sat down at the foot of the bed and looked at Ye Zhen anxiously.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, aren’t you uncomfortable? I’ll ask Mother to come over.” His concern was written all over his face.</p>
<p>“No. It’s just that I have been lying down for a long time, so I feel weak. It’s no big deal. I am really fine,” said Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>It’s a funny coincidence that her father had given her the nickname Yaoyao from an early age. Unexpectedly, her sister’s nickname was Yaoyao too.</p>
<p><i>Was this the natural fate of twins?</i></p>
