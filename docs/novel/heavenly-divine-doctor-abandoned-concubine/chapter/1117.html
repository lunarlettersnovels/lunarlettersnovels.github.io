            <p><strong>Chapter 212 – The Little Prince’s Vigor (1)</strong></p>
<p>Cining Palace</p>
<p>Word about the nocturnal commotion had yet to spread when Eunuch Fu was standing before the mistress of Cining Palace. His arrival with the first light wasn’t as much of a surprise as was his purpose.</p>
<p>The empress dowager took the phoenix seal and a handful of Xiunu[mfn][T/N: Xiunu (elegant females) selection- a selection process, held once every three years, where all qualified women under certain criteria are required to present themselves in the imperial palace to be selected by the emperor as his imperial consort.][/mfn] albums that Eunuch Fu had only just handed in. She looked intently at them and frowned.</p>
<p>“The emperor has asked Aijia to choose fine maidens as his concubines?” She reaffirmed.</p>
<p>The triennial <sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote" data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>Xiunu selection was scheduled to be held this year. Lu Wushuang, as the wang fei, was the one responsible for overseeing this matter. The empress dowager did not wish to involve herself in these matters. Her son had never bothered her with such affairs either.</p>
<p><i>Why then did the emperor suddenly change his mind?</i></p>
<p>“Replying to Her Highness, the emperor is of the opinion that the wang fei is unsuited for presiding over the Xiunu selection, so…”</p>
<p>“Where is the emperor?” Her frown deepened. This whole matter was too abrupt and strange.</p>
<p><i>The emperor has always been fond of Lu Wushuang. Why does he find her unsuitable?</i></p>
<p>“The emperor left early this morning to the Imperial Court.”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu was the emperor’s confidante. There was nothing he wasn’t privy to. The fact that he was speaking in riddles meant there was more to it and he was hinting to the very fact.</p>
<p>“When the emperor finishes his official business, Aijia will ask in person. Return and say that the phoenix seal and the Xiunu albums are still in Aijia’s possession. However, Aijia needs to know what happened.”</p>
<p>She knew that if it was not for a certain reason, the emperor would not delegate her the responsibility to preside over the palace affairs at this time. He knew how preoccupied she was with the little prince’s illness and that she was in no mood to attend to anything else.</p>
<p>With that, Eunuch Fu took his leave.</p>
<p>Holding the phoenix seal in her hands she mulled over the sudden turn of events. She thought back to the happenings of last evening because up until then things were quite normal. The more she thought, the more she was certain that something must have happened last night to effect such a huge mandate. Her frown deepened further.</p>
<p>After a moment, she looked at Aunt Cheng and said, “Find out what happened last night.”</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng acquiesced.</p>
<p>Worried about Mo Rongyi’s condition, the empress dowager collected the Phoenix seal and the Xiunu albums and immediately set out to the little prince’s residence. When she got there, the whole place was shrouded in pin-drop silence. Qi Jin was administering acupuncture while Ye Zhen was standing by.</p>
<p>This morning, after a meager sleep, Ye Zhen had hurriedly made breakfast. In the hopes of a better outcome, she had added a few drops of<i> lingquan</i> to the porridge. When she brought it over and saw that the young prince’s complexion looked much better than it did yesterday, the trace worry about the harmful effects of the miraculous liquid was washed away. She was genuinely glad.</p>
<p>“Ten thousand blessings to Empress Dowager.”</p>
<p>Seeing the empress dowager coming in, except Qi Jin, who was in the midst of acupuncture, everyone else curtsied.</p>
<p>“Rise.” The empress dowager waved her hand as she spoke. Then, she walked to the bedside to look at her son.</p>
<p>“Yi, did you sleep well last night?” she asked, affectionately.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was full of vigor. Seeing his mother, he immediately broke into a bright grin.</p>
<p>“Mother, I slept well last night. I have not woken up because of pain unlike before.” He spoke with a verve that had been long evading him.</p>
<p>Qi Jin took the needle and said with a smile, “I assure Your Highness that the Little Prince will be better soon. His pulse today is much better than before.”</p>
<p>“It is all due to Yaoyao’s medicated diet.” Mo Rongyi immediately stated, smiling to the limit.</p>
<p>Originally, he had asked Lu Yaoyao to enter the palace because he just wanted to let her know that he was going to die. In his last moments, he had wanted to talk to her for one last time because he considered her his friend. But little had he expected she would save him instead. The silly wager was actually a lifesaver.</p>
<p>The empress dowager looked at the little girl. She knew her son was speaking the truth, she felt so too. The gratitude in her heart manifested into a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said with a smile, “It’s only good that Little Prince has been willing to take his medicine. If one had refused to take medicine, one would have been beyond saving. Previously, you used to throw up every time you took the medicine, naturally, the efficacy could not be achieved.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, it’s good that Little Prince is getting better,” the relieved mother said with a smile.</p>
<p>Right then, a eunuch hurried in saying that the fifth and eighth prince were here to visit the little prince and awaiting the Empress Dowager’s permission.</p>
<p>The empress dowager took a look at Mo Rongyi. “Your fifth and eighth elder brothers have come to see you. Do you want to see them?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi frowned. “If it were Sixth Elder Brother, I would not mind meeting. But these two, I do not wish to see them.”</p>
<p>The two used to bully him at every given opportunity. They would take a jab at him saying his mother was not of noble birth; they mocked that his elder brother was blind. They were mean, he disdained them and did not want to see them at all.</p>
<p>The empress dowager nodded gently. She understood her son’s loathing. “Then return to the two princes and tell them that the little prince has just finished acupuncture and needs rest. Let them come back another day.”</p>
<p>The little eunuch withdrew in haste.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew of the three princes in the capital. Apart from these two princes, there was also the sixth prince. She had met him. He was of a cheerful disposition, straightforward and generous. Unlike the other royals, he was not fond of paying attention to other people’s business. He aptly suited his moniker: the carefree prince[mfn][T/N: King of leisure- is a phrase used to describe a man whose occupation involves little or no actual work. We just tweaked it to ‘carefree prince’.][/mfn]. Probably it was because of this, he was able to live up until now.</p>
<p>However, to be able to live as a present sovereign prince, she thought his life was not very simple. Even if he were not interested in the court intrigue, the royals were creatures of suspicion, would they let him be? Indeed, he must have a tough life.</p>
<p>She was soon brought out of her reverie when Qi Jin and her had to step out. The empress dowager was accompanying Mo Rongyi for a talk, so they had all retreated.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had to prepare Mo Rongyi’s lunch. After talking to Qi Jin for some time, she headed straight to the small kitchen.</p>
<p>Apart from Madam Nuan, no one in the entire palace knew that she was called to the Palace of Heavenly Purity yesterday. Moreover, the news that Lu Wushuang was confined was not known. Ye Zhen was looking forward to it. <i>What would Lu Lingzhi do once this news spreads in the capital?</i></p>
<p>She was not afraid of Lu Lingzhi helping Lu Wushuang compete for favor. What she was afraid of was his inaction. If he did nothing, he would not falter. And if he did not make mistakes, how could she get a hold of him?</p>
