<p>“Do you think everything the Lu Family has today is all because of your household<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>, and other people should feel unworthy of it? If you don’t like to see others, you will just have to stay in your courtyard and need not come out!”</p>
<p>Liu Shi stood up in shock and anger. She couldn’t believe that even today, the old madam gave little credit to her household.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk, Mother.” Lu Lingzhi’s face had calmed down as he whispered to the handmaiden behind his mother. “Eldest Madam Lu is not comfortable. Please send her back to rest.”</p>
<p>“Does my son also want to do this to his own mother? Don’t you know how terrible they treat our household?” Liu Shi asked in a shrill voice, her eyes in pain and anger, but her son did not help her.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi stood up, took her hand, and said to Old Madam Lu, “Grandmother, I’ll take my mother back to the courtyard first.”</p>
<p>“Mmm!” Old Madam Lu nodded sullenly. If it weren’t for her being a widow, she wouldn’t have let her off so easily today.</p>
<p>Liu Shi refused to leave in this way; her eyes were still staring at Lu Shiming. Lu Lingzhi grabbed her by the hand and accompanied her out.</p>
<p>“Mother…” Lu Shiming wanted to speak.</p>
<p>“All you children, please leave and have dinner first. I want to talk to your third uncle alone.” Old Madam Lu looked at several children who were too scared to speak.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen learned today that Lu Shiming had a grudge against the eldest household, but she did not know what had happened before. However, judging by Liu Shi’s appearance, his hate must have been paramount.</p>
<p>Silently, they exited the room leaving Old Madam Lu, Lu Shiming, and Pei Shi alone.</p>
<p>“Eldest Madam seldom goes out on weekdays. This is the first time I have seen her this month.” Lu Fang whispered to Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyebrows flicked slightly. “Oh.”</p>
<p>“Do you know why Eldest Madam said those things today?” Lu Fang asked in a low voice that there should be a lot of people at home who knew that Madam Lu was so disgusted with the third household.</p>
<p>Eldest Madam Lu had a daughter who was a noble concubine and a son who was an assistant war minister. Her position in the Lu Family was more honorable than anyone else. If she hated the third household, Ye Zhen feared for the things that could befall Lu Yaoyao’s family.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head indifferently. “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>For her, whether Liu Shi’s attitude was amicable or not, she had nothing to do with it. Apart from Lu Shiming’s family, she had no feelings for others at all.</p>
<p>Lu Jing looked at Ye Zhen with some pity and whispered. “Well, Yaoyao, what should we do, will Grandmother let Third Uncle move out?”</p>
<p>Noticing her mocking tone, Ye Zhen just gave her an indifferent look before saying, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Lu Jing wanted to say something more until Ye Zhen lost her cool, but another person suddenly halted her sharp tongue.</p>
<p>Lu Zan, who had been silent for a long time, uttered coldly, “Jing, keep quiet. This matter is not allowed to be mentioned again.”</p>
<p>Lu Zan was Lu Jing’s first brother. Upon his words, she did not dare to speak again.</p>
