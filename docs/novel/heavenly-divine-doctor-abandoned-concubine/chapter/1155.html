            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 172 – To Find A Way</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen had never quarreled with others since she was a child. This is because no one dared to oppose her, except her brother. However, she had always known that her temperament was soft and calm, and if her old self were to face Gao Xueping, she would be submissive as a prey.</p>
<p>When she woke up from her transmigration, she desired one thing—the ability to defend herself which she hadn’t done in her previous life. This time, for her and her twin sister’s life, she would not step back from anyone else.</p>
<p>Gao Xueping didn’t expect Lu Yaoyao to refuse. <em>Who does she think she is? Even if she is a cousin of the Wang fei and the assistant minister, she only belongs to the third house of the Lu family!</em></p>
<p>It also didn’t escape her awareness that Lu Lingzhi’s mother hold grudges against Lu Yaoyao’s parents. <em>Therefore, why should she be treated as a noble girl here in the college?</em></p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, don’t be ungrateful.” Gao Xueping shouted angrily, “In this college, people with higher status than you are everywhere. Don’t even think that because you are the minister’s cousin, we should be afraid of you. To frankly tell you, you are nothing in my eyes.”</p>
<p>Unperturbed by her belittling words, Ye Zhen looked at Gao Xueping with equal defiance and a smile of faint mockery. “Miss Gao, if you don’t want to live with me, don’t worry. I’ll find a way.”</p>
<p>“What will you do?” asked Gao Xueping who perked up upon hearing so.</p>
<p>“Ask no more.” Ye Zhen raised her eyebrows and smiled, “For I always have my ways naturally.”</p>
<p>Gao Xueping thought that Ye Zhen already gave up the fight and looked prouder. “Alright. I shall wait.”</p>
<p>When Gao Xueping left, Sun Wen grabbed Ye Zhen’s hand and cried, “How did you promise her that, why would you move on her benefit? Don’t be afraid of her. “</p>
<p>The Gao family was only relying on the power of the Chief princess who currently dominates inside the palace. Now, the Lu family had wealth and power at their fingertips stemming from the emperor’s recognition of Lu Lingzhi’s help in the previous wars. It won’t be long until the Lu family would be recognized as equal to the Gao family.</p>
<p>However, Lu Yaoyao had no desire to wait for that time to come. For her, Gao Xueping was just another kid to be taught a lesson.</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid of her.” Ye Zhen said in defense.</p>
<p>The Women’s college especially favors students who have silvers to spend. In this case, Ye Zhen won’t have a problem.</p>
<p>She still had more than 40,000 taels won from Liu Hua, and absolutely fine about living alone. Moreover, she knew someone in the college that could help her in this dilemma.</p>
<p>“If you are not afraid of her, why did you promise to move out instead of her?” Chen Jinru asked curiously.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen winked cunningly, “When did I promise Gao Xueping that I will move out? Wait for me here, I’ll see someone first. “</p>
<p>“Yao Yao, where are you going?” Sun Wen asked hastily.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back soon.” She wasted no time and ran away briskly with her skirt in her hand.</p>
<p>Both Sun Wen and Chen Jinru saw that she didn’t want them to follow, so they had to endure curiosity and patiently wait for Ye Zhen to return.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen went to the northernmost part of the medical center. This is the house of the academy. The rows of buildings look somewhat different from ordinary houses. There were ten rooms for each floor, comprising a three-story establishment.</p>
<p>She walked through the school and saw a middle-aged woman dressed in coarse cloth by the garden. She was ladling water to make tea and did not notice Ye Zhen’s arrival.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen walked over her with a pleasant smile, “Aunt, can I ask for a cup of tea?”</p>
<p>The woman looked back at Ye Zhen, dazed, “Wang fei Ye?”</p>
<p>“Wang fei Ye?” Ye Zhen looked at her doubtfully, feigning confusion about what the other party was saying.</p>
<p>“How can anyone look so similar to her?” The woman muttered to herself, looked up at Ye Zhen, frowned and asked, “Who are you, and why are you here?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gladly answered, “My name is Lu Yaoyao. Today is my first day in college. I was just roaming around when the marvelous smell of aunt’s tea wafts towards my nose.”</p>
<p>“Your nose is quite sharp.” The woman grunted.</p>
<p>“I like drinking tea since I was young, and its smell naturally attracts me.” Ye Zhen skillfully threw words, looking at this smug and indifferent woman whose name was Wen Xiu—one of the administrators of the medical school. She cooks good tea. However, although this person looked just like any other grumpy old lady, she has a vulgar hobby—her obsession for silvers.</p>
<p>Instead of sparing Ye Zhen a look, Wen Xiu said coldly, “Go home. Don’t just stroll around here if you have nothing to do.</p>
<p>With a mischievous smile, Ye Zhen sat down instead, with her palms on the table holding 500 silver taels.</p>
<p>Like a real goblin, Wen Xiu’s eyes shone brightly upon seeing the silvers. Suddenly, Ye Zhen caught her attention, the tea forgotten. “I want to ask my aunt for something today.”</p>
<p>“Say, what is it?” Wen Xiu took the silver from Ye Zhen’s hand in a snap, thinking that the girl was a person with a generous heart.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to share the same room with Miss Gao. can you please arrange it for me?” Ye Zhen blurted out with confidence.</p>
<p>“That’s not difficult.”</p>
<p>“Then please, aunt.”</p>
<p>“If you know what kind of tea this is, I’ll take your five hundred silver taels.” Wen Xiu challenged.</p>
<p>“Good!” Ye Zhen’s eyes flashed brightly. She took a sip of tea. the aroma of carbon fire was light, and there were a faint scent and elegant rhyme. “It’s an excellent tea.”</p>
<p>Wen Xiu snorted softly, “What kind of tea is this?”</p>
<p>“Aunt, this is Tieguanyin baked by carbon fire.”</p>
<p>Wen Xiu was surprised. “You really know tea.”</p>
<p>“I only know a little and could never compare with Aunt.” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>“I’ll take this five hundred tael. You must go.” Wen Xiu waved and drove Ye Zhen away.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bowed gratefully, “Thank you, aunt.”</p>
<p>As Ye Zhen strode off, Wen Xiu kept her gaze fixated on the tea in her hand and did not speak a word. She knew who Ye Zhen was referring to as Miss Gao—it was the same hot-headed miss who had just come to her with her head held high and demanded she occupy her room alone.</p>
<p><em>That woman doesn’t know etiquette! </em>She grudgingly said in her mind as she thought Gao Xueping. <em>How could she dare act arrogant in front of me?</em></p>
<p>The certainty of her success painted a satisfied smile on Ye Zhen’s lips as she was returning to her company.</p>
<p>She felt quite curious about Wen Xiu’s life experience. Generally speaking, the administrator did not have such a disdainful temperament. It just happened that she was so cold and softens at the sight of silver. However, the curator of the medical museum was very indulgent and protective of her.</p>
<p>“Yao Yao, what did you do just now?” Sun Wen asked curiously. She couldn’t shake off the thought that Ye Zhen came back a little strange—perhaps, happier? Far from the reaction she expected from someone who had just a fight with Gao Xueping.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled cunningly, “Nothing, let’s go have a cup of tea.”</p>
<p>Sun Wen looked incredulous. “You are still in the mood to drink tea even after Gao Xueping has bullied you.”</p>
<p>Just then, Gao Xueping came towards them with a livid face.</p>
