            <p><strong>Chapter 521 – Injured by An Arrow</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not expect that Mu Qing would want to see her instead of Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>“Did you hear what I said?  Come with me to see my sister now.” Mu Xue looked coldly at Ye Zhen, her tone was arrogant as if she was ordering her retainer.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Ye Zhen replied indifferently and leisurely sat on the soft chair, without any intention of moving.</p>
<p>Mu Xue was enraged by her attitude. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Miss Mu, I heard that you are only a servant of the Zhao Family. Do the servants of Zhao Jia Island treat their guests in such a condescending manner?” Ye Zhen asked with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“You…!” Mu Xue was furious.</p>
<p>In Zhao Jia Island, although she was not a young miss (not a noble lady by birth), because her sister was the Eldest Young Mistress and the Eldest Young Master doted on her, no one dared to treat her as a servant. Although she called Zhao Tianji young master, she did not think of herself as a maid anymore. Now Lu Yaoyao dared to call her that.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised a curious eyebrow. “Was I mistaken? Are you not, in fact, a maid? Perhaps you fancy yourself to be a young miss here on Zhao Jia Island?”</p>
<p>Mu Xue’s expression became extremely ugly. Other than the Zhao family’s two young masters, she had never lowered her head in front of others. However, Lu Yaoyao did not put her in his eyes. “Even if I’m just a maid, I’m still better than you!”</p>
<p>“Miss Mu, are you joking? Saying that you’re better than a princess, aren’t you taking yourself a little too seriously? Even your Island Lord doesn’t dare to say that his maid is better than a princess!” Ye Zhen laughed mockingly.</p>
<p>Mu Xue’s face turned pale. “Do you think you can be a princess here?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lazily glanced at her. If she didn’t really want to meet Mu Qing, she wouldn’t want to waste her breath on Mu Xue. “Alright, I don’t want to waste my breath on you. Tell Eldest Young Mistress that I will come and see her.”</p>
<p>“Come with me now,” Mu Xue yelled incessantly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s face darkened slightly. “Mu Xue, I’ve already tolerated you for a long time because of my master, don’t push your luck.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need you to be patient. Do you really think you’re a guest of Zhao Jia Island? Do you really think you’re a princess?” Mu Xue glared daggers at Ye Zhen and suddenly pulled out Cang Ying*. “I need to teach you a lesson, so you would know what you are.”</p>
<p>(*short sword)</p>
<p>Before Ye Zhen could stop her, Mu Xue had already attacked her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes turned frosty. She stood up quickly and took a few steps back. A cold glint flew from her sleeve towards Mu Xue’s wrist, and the Cang Ying in her hand fell off.</p>
<p>Mu Xue looked at Ye Zhen in shock. She could not believe that she had actually been injured by her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen picked up the short sword from the ground and said indifferently, “I’ll keep this for you. When I see your sister, I’ll return it to her.”</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao!” Mu Xue screamed. She could now clearly see what was it that had hurt her and hated Lu Yaoyao even more.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t she a princess? Why did she have such a sharp arrow on her? How could she hurt my wrist with such dexterity? Could it be that Lu Yaoyao knows archery?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her and smiled faintly. “Scram!”</p>
<p>Mu Xue shouted, “Just you wait. I won’t let you off so easily!”</p>
<p>“I’ll wait for you,” Ye Zhen smiled and said.</p>
<p>Mu Xue covered the wound on her wrist and glared at Ye Zhen resentfully before turning around and leaving.</p>
<p>As she held Cang Ying, Ye Zhen’s eyes turned a little complicated. <em>If the original owner of knew that this short sword was with her, would he come and ask for it?</em></p>
<p>Since she could not see Ye Shi, she had to think of a way to force him to come out and find her!</p>
<p>Right then, Huangfu Chen walked in from the outside. He had been playing chess with Zhao Tianji, but when he heard the commotion, he immediately came over to take a look. Just as he walked out of the courtyard, Mu Xue ran out in a huff, it looked like her hand was injured.</p>
<p>“What happened to Mu Xue?” Huangfu Chen looked at Ye Zhen and asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and said, “She wanted me to go and see Mu Qing. I don’t know where this girl’s hostility towards me stems from, but after saying a few words, she was about to hurt me with the sword but was instead hurt on her wrist by my arrow.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen was stunned for a moment and looked at her helplessly. “You injured her and stole her Cang Ying?”</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t, the owner of Cang Ying would most likely not come to see me.” Ye Zhen smiled and said, “Master, tomorrow I’ll go and see Mu Qing. Since she wants to see me, she must know that there’s a problem with that letter.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps… I just want you to treat her,” Huangfu Chen said in a low voice, his beautiful peach blossom eyes filled with sadness.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was stunned. “What disease is Mu Qing looking for me for?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen sighed, “I just heard Tianji mention that Mu Qing has never conceived, and… her body is getting worse every day.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to treat Mu Qing and have her give birth for Zhao Mingxiao?” Ye Zhen asked. She suspected that the misunderstanding back then had been caused by Zhao Mingxiao. How could she cure Mu Qing and have her give birth to his child? The woman was delusional!</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen shook his head and said, “I only came to Zhao Jia Island to explain what happened back then. I didn’t plan to save anything. After all, I… Things are different now. It’s not good for her to be sick. Go and take a look.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her eyes to look at Huangfu Chen’s elegant and beautiful face and suddenly felt a little envious of Mu Qing. “Master, you’re so kind to Mu Qing.”</p>
<p>“You really don’t plan to return Cang Ying to Mu Xue?” Huangfu Chen asked helplessly.</p>
<p>“This short sword looks pretty good. I’ll play with it for two days first,..” Ye Zhen smirked.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen walked to her side and motioned for her to sit down. “Yaoyao, you followed me to Zhao Jia Island this time to find… Cang Yang’s master, or was it to avoid Ah Zhan?”</p>
<p>At the mention of Mo Rongzhan, the smile on Ye Zhen’s face faded. “Master, what does this have to do with him?”</p>
<p>“Does it matter if you hide on Zhao Jia Island?” Huangfu Chen said softly, “You just listened to Xu Ji’s words and didn’t believe Ah Zhan. No matter what he did, don’t believe what you heard if you didn’t see it with your own eyes, lest you let him go and others take advantage of him.”</p>
<p>A bitter smile appeared on Ye Zhen’s lips. The problem between her and Mo Rongzhan was not only because she didn’t trust him, but also because she couldn’t explain the secret.</p>
<p>“Master, let’s go back after the matter with Zhao Jia Island is over.”</p>
<p>It was indeed time for her to settle everything. No matter what method she used, she wanted Lu Lingzhi to get retribution. Only after that man had been completely dealt with could she leave the capital.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled and nodded. “Okay!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lowered her eyes to look at the short sword in her hand. It seemed that her expectations from before had fallen through. She still hoped that her father and brother would be on Zhao Jia Island. Thinking about it… It could be assumed that he passed away over here.</p>
<p>“Master, can we go out for a walk?” Ye Zhen asked.</p>
<p>“Talk to Tianji tomorrow, it should be possible,” Huangfu Chen whispered.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. She was quite curious about Zhao Jia Island. This island was too much like a country. To be able to turn an island into this, it was obvious that it had taken a lot of thought and effort.</p>
