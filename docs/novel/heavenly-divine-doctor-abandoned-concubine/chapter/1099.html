            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 229 – Exploit One’s Marriage (2)</strong></p>
<p>When Ye Zhen saw that she was able to convey her point, the corners of her mouth formed a smile. “I have to go back to the academy. I have something to give you, this rose water. I dab it on my face before going to bed every day. I made it when I was reading medical books in the academy.”</p>
<p>“What’s this for?” Lu Fang asked.</p>
<p>“Rosewater is used to make one’s face ruddier.” Ye Zhen smiled and continued. “I have also given two bottles to Grandmother.”</p>
<p>Lu Fang’s eyes brightened. “Well, thank you.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “Then I’ll go now.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you know… about the Liang Family… ” With her red face, Lu Fang called, stopping Ye Zhen from leaving.</p>
<p>“I have heard of it.” Ye Zhen frowned and continued. “I will not consent. I will not get engaged until I finish my studies.”</p>
<p>These words of Ye Zhen brought a wide smile to Lu Fang’s face and laughter to her eyes. “I’ll see you out.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes flashed with a touch of sarcasm. “Hmm.”</p>
<p>A few words had been enough to turn this miss’ mood! But she didn’t mind one bit, her purpose of visit had long been achieved.</p>
<p>After sending off Ye Zhen, Lu Fang took the two bottles of rose water and immediately went to Liu Shi.</p>
<p>Madam Lu had just been driven out by the old madam, she was in a fit of ill-temper. When she heard that her husband’s daughter from a concubine was coming, her eyes were filled with even more hatred–she felt disgusted.</p>
<p>She knew what Lu Fang was most anxious about now. <em>Humph! I’ll make that lowly Cheng feel that even if she was favored, it wouldn’t change her situation. She’s still a mere concubine. Can her daughter make her own decisions now?</em></p>
<p>“Let the Second Miss come in,” Madam Lu said in a cold voice.</p>
<p>Although her husband had died, after many years of indifference and alienation, her affection for Lu Shifeng had turned into deep resentment. How could she make his favorite concubine live well?</p>
<p>Lu Fang came in with a smile. “Mother, I heard that your health is getting better. I specially came here to greet you.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to have a rest tomorrow. You don’t have to come and pay your respects,” Madame Lu said with a sneer, looking at Lu Fang’s face. Contrary to what she was thinking, Lu Fang was a pretty delicate lady, however, she was small-minded.</p>
<p>“You are my mother. How can I not come to pay my respects?” Lu Fang said with a smile.</p>
<p>She did not know what Liu Shi had been hiding up her sleeve, why she had been feigning illness and for some time, refused to take over the familial duties. However, she could not give up on marrying into the Liang Family.</p>
<p>Madam Lu raised her eyes to look at Lu Fang. “Why did you come looking for me?” She curtly demanded.</p>
<p>She had always directed her disdain and loathing for her husband and his concubine on their offsprings. Never once had she spoken normally, let alone politely.</p>
<p>“Mother, this is rose water. It’s from overseas. It can make people look younger after applying on one’s face. Although you are already beautiful, you could even look more glamorous with this,” Lu Fang said courteously, hoping Liu Shi would feel tenderness towards her. In her opinion, as long as she became the marquis’ wife, this madam should be gratified. After all, her purpose was to establish connections, build support for her daughter, so how did it matter who married, as long as it was a Lu that married.</p>
<p>Madam Lu took the two porcelain bottles and smiled. “This rose water did not come from overseas. Yaoyao gave it to you.” The girl’s little ploy was a child’s play to the seasoned eyes.</p>
<p>Liu Shi knew that this was the very one that Lu Yaoyao gave to the old madam. She had noticed that the old madam’s complexion had been ruddy recently, making her visibly younger. Later, she found out it was Lu Yaoyao’s present.</p>
<p>Lu Fang somewhat felt embarrassed.</p>
<p>“I know what you’re going to say. Yaoyao doesn’t want to marry into the Liang Family, and she has her eyes above her head. As for you, I dare not be in charge of your affairs. If you are really interested, go have your Yi Niang beg the old madam. If the old madam agrees, I will arrange things for you.”  Madam Lu didn’t mince words and revealed the young miss’ true intentions.</p>
<p>She surmised that the Liang Family held the title of a marquis at the very least, so if Lu Yaoyao refused, she’d let Lu Fang marry instead. Either way, it’s hard to tell whether she still could help the wang fei in the future. At long last, she could be satisfied that she had made use of the opportunity.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mother!” Lu Fang was suddenly over the moon.</p>
