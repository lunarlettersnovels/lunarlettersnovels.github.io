<p>Old Madam Lu looked at Ye Zhen with the same look. “Yaoyao, what good whip have you got that Jing’er wants?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gave Lu Jing a glint of hubris for this Fourth Miss was being so blatantly shameless. <i>Now, how could she refuse the old madam! Ah! The girl was testing her cool!</i></p>
<p>Even if the whole Lu Family was spoiling and pampering her, it had nothing to do with Ye Zhen. And most of all, whether she could graduate or not had nothing to do with her precious silver whip!</p>
<p>“Grandmother, that was when I went hunting with my eldest brother the other day. Marquis Tang Zhen wanted to compete with me. He lost the silver whip to me,” Ye Zhen said in a humorous manner, making it look like she found the situation ridiculous.</p>
<p>“But I didn’t expect my fourth sister to like marquis’ silver whip so much. Had I known, I would have let Fourth Sister compete with the marquis herself.”</p>
<p><i>That’s what she won, the prize of her sweet victory! Why should she give Lu Jing such a rare whip?</i></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu had known about the little competition that took place between her third granddaughter and the marquis. But not until today did she know that it came with a prize, the silver whip Lu Jing wanted.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, the old madam’s eyes lit up. <i>Why did the marquis go through such measures, offering something to lure her granddaughter into participating in his game?</i></p>
<p>It appeared to her, the corners of the madam’s lips lifted a little, that the marquis was interested in Lu Yaoyao!</p>
<p>“Third Sister’s silver whip is useless to her, but I certainly like it-” Lu Jing pursed her lips and spoke with clear naivety.</p>
<p>With her achievements and reputation in the Academy for Women, she felt like she was entitled to everything she wanted.</p>
<p>Before Lu Jing could even finish her plea, the curtains were hurled up to reveal Lu Lingzhi with several of his brothers. His distinguishable upright voice greeted Old Madam.</p>
<p>“Greetings to our ever-lovely Grandmother!” he said with a wide smile.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu immediately smiled at her favorite grandson. “Why are you all here?”</p>
<p>“Well, we are all famished so we came to have some delicious food. We all met on the way.” As he spoke, his eyes uncontrollably swept towards the stunning vision standing beside the old madam– Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>A glimpse of surprise flashed across his eyes!</p>
<p><i>Wasn’t it just days since he last saw her? How come she has changed so drastically?</i></p>
<p><i>Is Teacher Shan really that good that she can change a wild girl so thoroughly?</i></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu laughed and said, “I see. Your brutish monkeys came along when they heard of the little feast. Well, they are most welcome.”</p>
<p>The men laughed boisterously, taking no offense for they knew the madam was only jesting.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi laughed along and without saying a word, sat down on a plush chair. “Two cousins are here.”</p>
<p>Chen Qiuping and Chen Liping stepped forward to pay respect.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lightly looked at the two misses. She found a little shyness on Chen Qiuping’s face; out of the corner of her eyes, she was constantly stealing glances at Lu lingzhi.</p>
<p><i>Oh, so it is!</i></p>
<p><i>It seems that Lu Lingzhi is truly an excellent match for many girls!</i></p>
<p>“Just now, when I entered the door, I heard Jing’er say something about the silver whip. What was it about?” Lu Lingzhi asked lightly while occasionally filling his plate with food as did his brothers.</p>
<p>Lu Jing soon looked embarrassed, smiled reluctantly, and considered how to answer.</p>
<p>Lu Fang let out a small laugh. “Eldest Brother, Fourth Sister wants Third Sister’s whip”</p>
