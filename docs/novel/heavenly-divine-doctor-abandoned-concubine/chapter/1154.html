            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 173 – What Can Silver Do?</strong></p>
<p>Seeing Gao Xueping’s furious appearance, Sun Wen and Chen Jinru looked at each other, clueless of what trouble she brought this time.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao!” Gao Xueping snapped at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Miss Gao, what can I do for you?” Ye Zhen asked politely.</p>
<p>Sun Wen and Chen Jinru’s eyes widened for Gao Xueping was not alone this time, she brought with her Xu Huiru and—they both felt their stomach sink—the other one was none other than Princess Liu Hua!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Ye Zhen remained calm as she watched the three figures draw nearer…</p>
<p>Upon reaching her, Gao Xueping pointed at her and with a furious voice, yelled. “You are mean! Shameless! How cruel of you to make me move out in such a mischievous way. Lu Yaoyao, you are very deceitful!”</p>
<p>Blasted with the accusation, Ye Zhen remained looking innocent.</p>
<p>“Miss Gao, you made it clear that you did not want to live in the same room with me, and I could only think of this way to solve your problem.”</p>
<p>“Xueping? What did you expect? She was born to a merchant family and is used to working with money. Even in the academy, she practices her merchant skills.” Liu Hua sourly spoke.</p>
<p>While this transpired, Xu Huiru remained silent beside Liu Hua. Since she badly wanted to be friends with the princess, she was bound to follow the princess even if she did not exactly agree to them feasting over Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Silver is really a good thing.” Ye Zhen chuckled and asked Liu Hua daringly, “Since the early times, silver is already used to resolve the crisis, so why should I not use it this time? Does it mean that only when the Lu Family’s uses would it look vulgar, but when the princess does so, she would look particularly noble?”</p>
<p>Gao Xueping’s face turned red with anger. Although she was from a well-known family, she was in fact, living beyond her means. She would not want to be admitted to the School of Medicine if not for her family’s efforts in worshipping Princess Royal and her daughter, Liu Hua.</p>
<p>She could only hope to become an imperial physician in the future and bring some glory to her family. And perhaps, if fate permitted it, she would catch the emperor’s attention when she finally entered the palace.</p>
<p>Only, she met an obstacle.</p>
<p>What she did not expect was that there would be a Lu Yaoyao who would enter the academy at the same time with her.</p>
<p>When she first saw her, she felt threatened.</p>
<p><i>This person… looks too dazzling. Anyone standing with her would lose their shine.</i></p>
<p>“You said clearly just now that you would find a way to move out. How could you turn the tables around?”</p>
<p>The more she thought of Ye Zhen’s scheme, the more agitated Gao Xueping was.</p>
<p>“Is that what I said?” Ye Zhen sounded surprised. “I think the room is quite good. You do not want to live with me, so I have to give more silvers to own the place alone. Anyway, I just won some silvers the other day, so I put it into good use.”</p>
<p>Liu Hua’s face crumpled. Of course, she knew where the money Ye Zhen said came from. It was all hers!</p>
<p>She stared daggers at Ye Zhen. “Lu Yaoyao, is the slap you received yesterday in the palace still painful?”</p>
<p>When the other girls heard that Ye Zhen had been slapped in the palace, they all looked inquisitively at her face.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your concern. I hurt my face yesterday by accident. However, I do not feel any pain today because of the snow lotus ointment given by the empress dowager,” she said, clear enough to earn gasps from everyone.</p>
<p>Liu Hua squinted her eyes at Ye Zhen’s face and found that there was no redness and swelling as what she had seen yesterday.</p>
<p><i>It seemed that the empress dowager indeed gave her the precious ointment!</i></p>
<p>Jealousy filled her heart. She was chasing the affection of the empress dowager for a long time now, but why could she not get such treatment? While Ye Zhen earned her favor after seeing her for just a day!</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, do not think you can bully others in the academy through the wang fei!”</p>
<p>“Princess, I am not bullying anyone. If Miss Gao wants to live alone, she can give me back the money I gave Aunt Wen and I will move out without resistance.” Ye Zhen posed a calm exterior, which irked the opposing girls even more.</p>
<p>Gao Xueping snorted. “Well, how much money did you give?”</p>
<p>“One thousand two hundred.” Ye Zhen smiled.</p>
<p>Even if Gao Xueping could get the money, she would definitely earn a little profit too.</p>
<p>“You …”</p>
<p>Gao Xueping turned pale. She only spent dozens of taels more for the shared chambers, while Ye Zhen spent 1,200 taels!</p>
<p>Liu Hua said to Gao Xueping, “Give her money so she moves out!”</p>
<p>Gao Xueping was in deep trouble.</p>
<p>How could she get 1,200 taels? Even if she could acquire such a large sum of silvers, Aunt Wen may not accept it. When she had approached Aunt Wen, she did not know that she was the school’s administrator and was rude to her. Only when the old woman ordered a servant and when Liu Hua politely greeted her, did Gao Xueping realize her mistake.</p>
<p>But then, it was all too late. Aunt Wen was already very disappointed in her.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Princess Liu Hua could just give silvers to Miss Gao if she does not have any.” Ye Zhen suggested.</p>
<p>Liu Hua gave Ye Zhen a hard stare.</p>
<p>Early this morning, her mother let people take 20,000 silver taels to the little prince as his winnings from the bet she had instigated in an attempt to humiliate Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Therefore, within only just a few days, Princess Royal had lost tens of thousands of silver taels. That said, Liu Hua could not ask for silvers from her mother anymore. Where could she get 1,200 taels for Gao Xueping?</p>
<p>Gao Xueping knew what Liu Hua had in mind—her friend could not come to her aid this time. She felt ashamed and resentful and therefore, opted for another way even if it meant defeat.</p>
<p>“Why would I be as vulgar and low as you? I refuse to be part of your games, Lu Yaoyao,” she said, before turning around to leave.</p>
<p>Liu Hua took two steps forward, looked straight in Ye Zhen’s eyes with some animosity, and suddenly uttered in a threatening tone.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, do not think you can be arrogant here for long. Lu Wushuang will not leave you in peace. Everyone fears her. The things she could do to you…”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her lightly, she knew what Liu Hua was going to say.</p>
<p>“Wait and see how your Wang Fei Sister treats you.” Liu Hua finished.</p>
<p>“Princess, why are you so afraid of the wang fei?” Ye Zhen asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>She knew what kind of person Lu Wushuang was, but she could never say anything bad about her outside.</p>
<p>Liu Hua’s face sank.</p>
<p>“Why should I be afraid of her?”</p>
<p>“If you are not afraid of her, why slander her in front of her cousin sister? Wang Fei is kind and gentle. She smiles amiably at everyone. As her younger sister, I am exceedingly proud of her. What is your purpose in creating discord between us like this?”</p>
<p>Liu Hua was angry and smiled. “Even if you curry favor with Lu Wushuang, will she let you enter the palace?”</p>
<p>“Last time, it was the wang fei who requested for me to visit the palace.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s retaliating remarks felt like a hundred slap on Liu Hua’s face. Her eyes bore malice as she had a hard time looking at Ye Zhen while keeping her urge to hurt her physically at bay.</p>
<p>“You wait and see, this princess is not done with you.” Liu Hua grunted.</p>
