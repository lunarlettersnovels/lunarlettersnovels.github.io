            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 73 – A Graceful Dance (2)</h3>
<p>At the centre of the wide garden a bonfire was burning, the woods underneath it cracking as the fire danced, painting a magnificent glow in the garden.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming was baking lambs nearby; Pei Shi was tapping over the wine bowl with chopsticks while Teacher Shan played the guqin.</p>
<p>As for the drums…</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi and Tang Zhen’s eyes rested on the dancing girl in the middle. She was wearing a long red dress with a small drum tied to her waist. She danced gracefully with the beat of the music. She had a bright and beautiful smile on her face.</p>
<p>With the music played softly, she moved slowly like wind, her hands gently touching the drum. The sound the guqin and the drum created was passionate, she twirled lightly on her toes while keeping a graceful posture.</p>
<p>Her hands gaily slicing through the air, and her eyes… incredibly enticing. She skipped and swayed, her vibrant red dress fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>Her appearance was accentuated by the shiny tassels whirling, over and over again, stirring unspeakable emotions in the young marquis who watched in silence…</p>
<div data-fuse="22037242891" data-fuse-code="fuse-slot-22037242891-1" data-fuse-slot="71161633/WORD_wordexcerpt/chapter_incontent_1"></div>
<p>Tang Zhen’s heart beat faster, his eyes were burning at the sight of the beautiful girl. He thought it was a fairy who fell into the world accidentally. He even breathed carefully, fearing that he might disturb her and frighten her away from the world.</p>
<p>Not far from him, Lu Xiangzhi did not harbor such an idea. He looked at Ye Zhen proudly and soon, loudly applauded.</p>
<p>The sound of the music was not cut off because of Lu Xiangzhi’s intrusion. Instead, Ye Zhen gave a warm smile towards Lu Xiangzhi and continued to dance. This time, the drums became playful and lively.</p>
<p>By this time, Lu Shiming’s attention was caught by his son’s sudden arrival. He recognized the figure of the marquis, slightly hiding in the shadows, so he hastily stood up and gave his greetings.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen hardly turned his eyes back from Ye Zhen when he returned to Lu Shiming’s courtesy. “Don’t be polite, Lord Lu, it’s this marquis who is bothering you.”</p>
<p>Only then did Ye Zhen notice his presence, without a moment’s delay, she stopped dancing. When the little maid next to her saw her stop, she immediately came up with her beaded shoes and put them on her.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen took an unconscious glance through the corners of his eyes and saw Ye Zhen’s white lotus feet. His heart was about to jump out of his throat at the sight!</p>
<p>He never knew… that he would be so inappropriate towards a little girl.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming already knew that Lu Xiangzhi had gone to the hunting grounds. Having a hunch of the emperor’s participation, he thought his son would not come back tonight.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, look!” Lu Xiangzhi gently placed the fawn that had just been born in Ye Zhen’s arms.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes were slightly bright. “How lovely, where did you find it?”</p>
<p>“In the woods, it may have lost contact with its parents, so I brought it back for you to keep.” Lu Xiangzhi said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Brother.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart was slightly warm, Lu Xiangzhi really loved her twin sister, otherwise, he wouldn’t be thinking about her wherever he was.</p>
