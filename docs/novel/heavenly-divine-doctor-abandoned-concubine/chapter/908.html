            <p><strong>Chapter 421 – She is a Vixen (1)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen initially wanted to go to Cining Palace to ask Empress Dowager to find a new female physician to take care of the emperor. However, in the end, she decided against it. Empress Dowager had said that she felt that others were not as trustworthy as her, so she couldn’t very well say that she didn’t want to see Mo Rongzhan. After all, he was injured because he saved her. Besides, in Empress Dowager’s heart, Mo Rongzhan’s existence was more important. So, in the case she went to her and revealed that she didn’t even want to take care of him, she was afraid she would make Empress Dowager unhappy.</p>
<p>As such, she went to the imperial hospital to brew medicine for him. As she boiled his medicine, she thought back to Mo Rongzhan’s words before and felt angry as well as uncomfortable. She had thought that he didn’t like her only because her surname was Ye, but it seemed that it was more than that.</p>
<p>She had even almost softened her heart back then. When he was desperate to save her, when she saw the myriad scars wreathing his body, and when she heard the numerous suffering he experienced in the past… At that time, she really thought she could put down her resentment against him.</p>
<p>That was until he said he would marry her as his empress. If she was just Lu Yaoyao, she would be happy to hear that. However, she was Ye Zhen, the woman who had loved him for eight years, but whose final fate was to be killed – for the sake of emptying the boudoir – without even seeing him for the two years they were married.</p>
<p>So, how could she feel joyous at such a proposal? The only thing she felt was that her life as Ye Zhen was incredibly sorrowful. She had lived so humbly for him, practically living just like the dust on the earth, but to him, what was she?</p>
<p>In the future, if he knew that she is Ye Zhen, would he still do this to her? She didn’t dare to gamble, much less want to live like that again.</p>
<p>Estimating the time, she figured that the medicine was almost done cooking. So, she slowly walked back to the Palace of Heavenly Purity. But before she even approached the building, she heard the sound of people howling.</p>
<p>After carefully listening to what the howls were saying, Ye Zhen’s face cooled down. <em>These people are coming to plead leniency on behalf of Eighth Prince! It seems Tang Zhen has already discovered the person behind the conspiracy on the hunting ground. After all, without solid evidence, it’s impossible for him to arrest the eighth prince.</em></p>
<p>Realizing this, head down, Ye Zhen passed by those people ignoring their howling and screaming. <em>These people are just like Prince Shun, who knows if they were involved in the plot or not.</em></p>
<p>When Fifth Prince saw Ye Zhen passing by them, he immediately stood up and pointed at her, shouting angrily. “This is the vixen! It not only deceived Empress Dowager but also left the emperor in a coma. Tang Zhen arrested Eighth Brother for no reason, it must be because he has been confused by this vixen. Imperial Uncle, we should address this injustice and avenge the emperor and kill this vixen!”</p>
<p>“That’s right, kill her!” All the members of imperial clans kneeling behind followed and shouted. If this woman had not won against Eighth Prince for Mo Rongyi that day, Changping Casino would not have been closed and they would still be able to get a lot of dividends now.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen cast them a cold look. <em>They actually dared to accuse her of all these crimes. How laughable! Did they think that by killing her, they could erase the evidence of Prince Shun’s assassination attempt on the young prince?</em></p>
<p>“Fifth Prince, this is the imperial palace, the abode of Empress Dowager and Emperor. It’s not your turn to fight and kill as you please here,” Ye Zhen said in a light voice. She had never liked Fifth Prince and Eighth Prince. They were all people who forgot righteousness in the face of profit. She especially disliked Fifth Prince. He thought that Mo Rongzhan was still unconscious, so he took advantage of the opportunity to make trouble.</p>
<p><em>Does he really think that without Mo Rongzhan around, he can soar to the sky?</em></p>
<p>Fifth Prince pointed at Ye Zhen and shouted, “Empress Dowager is bewitched by you. The emperor simply does not realize the danger now, but they will understand that this prince only wishes to save the empire, so you will not bring disaster to the empire and its people in the future.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen covered her mouth and chuckled. She was born with extremely beautiful features, so when she was being deliberately charming and coquettish, naturally she would appear even more beautiful. She did have an appearance that could ruin a city and overturn the state to the point that other people’s eyes were glued straight on her. “Many thanks, Fifth Prince, for your high praise to this princess. If in the future, this princess is capable of bringing disaster to the empire and causing suffering to the people, she will certainly hail you as a prophet.”</p>
<p>Fifth Prince looked at Ye Zhen’s beautiful face and thought that if he had the opportunity to pull the bane of their existence, Mo Rongzhan, down from the throne, he would definitely capture this woman in his palace when he ascended in the future. He would ravage her day and night, and watch her moan underneath him.</p>
<p>“Shameless vixen, this prince will not let you go today,” Fifth Prince shouted, coming forward to catch her, a certain gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen only stared at him coldly and said, “If you dare to touch me, I will render your hands useless.”</p>
<p>Seeing her cold and fierce eyes, Fifth Prince was startled. But then, realizing that he was frightened by a weak woman, flew into a rage out of humiliation. “This prince wants to try. One will see what you can do!”</p>
<p>Before his hand managed to touch Ye Zhen, a dark shadow suddenly appeared around him. Then, unable to react, Fifth Prince could only scream with a sound that was more mournful than before as he flew back.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, are you all right?” Tang Zhen asked as he looked down at Ye Zhen, his eyes full of worry and fury.</p>
