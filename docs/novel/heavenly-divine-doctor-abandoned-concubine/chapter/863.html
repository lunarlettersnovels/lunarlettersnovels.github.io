<strong>Chapter 467 – Stop at the Point</strong><p></p>
<p>Ye Zhen woke up and found that her eyes were swollen. Last night, she cried a few times because of Mo Rongzhan. She cursed him in her heart countless times. She dabbed cold water and a bit of <em>lingquan</em>, it was a while before the swelling finally subsided.</p>
<p>After breakfast, she went to bid farewell to Old Madam Lu and Pei Shi. She said she was going out to practice medicine with Huangfu Chen but did not tell them that she would be away for a few days. If they knew that she was going to Huaijiang and that she would not return for half a year, they would definitely not let her go.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the fact that it was still early, Ye Zhen already left the city gate with Huangfu Chen’s carriage. She was very afraid that Mo Rongzhan would find out and stop her halfway.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu had someone see Ye Zhen out, and she immediately missed her. With this granddaughter acting like a spoiled child in front of her from time to time, she found the days interesting, but now she didn’t know when the little girl would come back.</p>
<p>“Old Madam, Xue Liu in Third Master’s courtyard was chased home by Third Miss yesterday,” a maidservant who was massaging old Madam Lu’s leg glanced at her and whispered.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Madam Lu raised her eyebrows. “She was chased away by Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>The maid told the old madam that Xue Liu was sick and wanted to ask for a doctor. “…Coincidentally, Third Miss went to find Third Madam. When she saw Xue Liu kneeling outside the courtyard, she had someone send her home.”</p>
<p>Chen Hao walked in from outside and happened to hear the maid’s words. She glared at her and said, “What things are you saying to the old madam?”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu smiled and said, “It doesn’t hurt for me to hear it. I didn’t expect Yaoyao to have such courage.”</p>
<p>“Third Madam is a little worried.” Chen Hao smiled. In fact, the old madam had sent Xue Liu over to make it clear that she would let the third madam deal with her. Unfortunately, Pei Shi was worried that the matriarch would not be happy and had never made a move on Xue Liu, which added to her worries.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, that’s good. I won’t worry about her getting married in the future.” Madam Lu smiled.</p>
<p>The maid didn’t expect the old madam to think that the Third Miss was good at everything. She immediately shut her mouth and didn’t dare to speak for Xue Liu anymore.</p>
<p>Chen Xi sent her off and rubbed the matriarch’s shoulders. “Old Madam, I don’t know when the empress dowager will grant our Third Miss a marriage. Once this marriage is confirmed, you will have to get busy and find some good wood to make furniture for Third Miss.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu beamed. “You must prepare well.”</p>
<p>Chen Hao secretly sighed in her heart. Second Miss’s marriage was also approaching, but the old madam no longer cared much about it.</p>
<p>The master and servant were happily talking about how to prepare a dowry for Lu Yaoyao when Aunt Cheng came.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was overjoyed. She thought that there was some news, so she immediately told Chen Ying to bring Aunt Cheng in.</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng smiled and bowed. “Old Madam.”</p>
<p>“Aunt Cheng, please have a seat,” Old Madam Lu said with a smile, but her heart was a little curious. Seeing Aunt Cheng like this didn’t seem like she was here for the sake of her granddaughter’s marriage.</p>
<p>“Old Madam, the empress dowager ordered this servant to send you a few words,” Aunt Cheng sat down and whispered to Madam Lu.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu’s heart skipped a beat and everyone in the room retreated. She asked Aunt Cheng in a low voice, “What orders does Empress Dowager have?”</p>
<p>“Old Madam, Third Miss and Marquis Jing Ning’s marriage… Don’t mention it again,” Aunt Cheng leaned over and whispered.</p>
<p>“This is…” Old Madam Lu was shocked. <em>Could it be that there was some obstacle?</em></p>
<p>Auntie Cheng felt that if she didn’t mention it more clearly, the Lu family would probably misunderstand. “Old Madam, Third Miss has a better future. Just you wait, this marriage… It isn’t only Empress Dowager, the emperor has to give a nod too*.”</p>
<p>[*approve]</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu became even more confused. <em>Could it be that Empress Dowager agreed, but the emperor did not? Isn’t Yaoyao’s future good now? What’s better than a marquis’s wife? The only princess of the dynasty marrying the Marquis of Jing Ning, what better future is there than being a marquis’s wife?</em></p>
<p>“Aunt Cheng, your words make me more and more confused. Did she make the emperor unhappy?” Old Madam Lu asked cautiously.</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng laughed lightly. “The emperor treats Third Miss as a treasure, how could he not be happy?”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu’s expression changed. If she didn’t understand what she meant, she would have lived for so many years in vain.</p>
<p><em>The emperor treats Yaoyao…as a treasure?!</em></p>
