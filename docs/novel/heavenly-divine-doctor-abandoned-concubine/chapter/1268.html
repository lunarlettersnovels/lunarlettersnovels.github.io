<p>Pei Shi lived in a humble courtyard close to the main house. When Ye Zhen arrived, Pei Shi had just retreated to the upper rooms, the young miss had to wait.</p>

<p>When a few moments passed and the third madam still did not return, Ye Zhen’s lips curled into a small frown as she started to wonder if she should come back later.</p>
<p>Mid-way into her decision making, a beautifully dressed woman emerged from the east wing room, gaining her attention, and jolting her out of her thoughts. With one look at the woman’s hair and attire, Ye Zhen mused to herself that this woman was certainly no maid. Rather, this woman reminded her of the ladies she used to see back at Ye Mansion.</p>
<p>Upon seeing her, the mystery woman’s lips curled into a smile, turning to walk towards her, stopping short only to bow into a curtsy.</p>
<p>“Are you the third miss?” She inquired as she rose, the smile still on her face as she took a small moment to stare at her before turning her gaze away.</p>
<p>“Third Madam went outside. Third Miss might as well wait inside Madam’s house. Your mother should be back soon.” She stated.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen squinted at her slightly and was sure that there was no such person in her sister’s memory. She should be from the capital then!</p>
<p>She was definitely not a maid. <i>Then who was she? What was her business with Pei Shi?</i></p>
<p>Deciding that it wasn’t good to stick her nose in everyone’s business, Ye Zhen frowned slightly before nodding and turning to leave.</p>
<p>“All right. Thank you.”</p>
<p>But as soon as she took one step towards the house, Pei Shi’s maid Hai Tang came into the room, stopping in her tracks when she saw her and the mysterious woman together. Though, that only lasted for a small moment before she calmly turned to bow to Ye Zhen, paying her respects. “Greetings to Third Miss.”</p>
<p>Smiling at her sudden appearance, Ye Zhen quickly returned her greetings before venturing to ask, her voice sweet and innocent. “Sister Hai Tang, I’m looking for Mother, is she not here?”</p>
<p>Hai Tang stiffened at the question, shooting the mysterious woman a cold look before turning back to Ye Zhen with a somewhat strained smile. “Madam went to the upper rooms and will be back shortly.”</p>
<p>Really, if Ye Zhen was not focused on the handmaiden for her response, she would have missed that quick exchange.</p>
<p>The woman neither acknowledged Hai Tang nor looked her way. She only stepped forward, linking her arms with Ye Zhen’s. “Then Third Miss will wait for Third Madam in the courtyard. I will sit with her,” the woman said, that wide smile still plastered on her face as she ushered Ye Zhen towards Pei Shi’s room.</p>
<p><i>How odd…</i></p>
<p>At that point, Hai Tang stepped forward, blocking the woman’s advance, effortlessly untangling her hold on Ye Zhen with cold eyes.</p>
<p>“Madam said that no maid in this room can enter except me and the third miss. Older Sister Xue Liu, there is no mention of you being allowed in thus, you are not to come in. So, I will accompany Third Young Miss. We won’t bother you any longer.”</p>
<p>Xue Liu’s face sank. “You…!”</p>
<p>“Third Young Miss, please come in.” Hai Tang interjected, voice firm. She was simply too tired to deal with the likes of Xue Liu at the moment.</p>
<p>At that invitation, Ye Zhen nodded, adopting a serene countenance despite the rather tense scene. “Then, let us go and wait for my mother, Sister Hai Tang.”</p>
<p>With quick but calm steps, Ye Zhen crossed the threshold, following Hai Tang inside the room, her mind still going over the sudden exchange. Once done, Hai Tang quickly let the curtains down, neither woman sparing a glance at the left behind Xue Liu, whose face had turned blue in anger.</p>
<p>Judging by the heated exchange between Pei Shi’s trusted maid and the woman, Ye Zhen knew right away that Xue Liu wasn’t exactly liked in this place.</p>
<p>Once seated, the third young miss cast a quick glance at the handmaiden before turning away, pursing her lips. “… Sister Hai Tang? Who was that? I have never seen her before.”</p>
