<p>“Eunuch Fu?” Ye Zhen frowned as she looked at him. His presence every time meant it would have something to do with Mo Rongzhan. Subconsciously, she didn’t really want to see him.</p>
<p>Fude* said with a smile, “Your Highness, the emperor invites you to the Palace of Earthly Purity.”</p>
<p>[*Fude = Eunuch Fu]</p>
<p>“Eunuch Fu, please relay a message to the emperor for me. I have to go to the empress dowager instead so I won’t be going to Palace of Earthly Purity,” Ye Zhen said with a cold expression. <em>What did Mo Rongzhan want to do with her again?</em></p>
<p>“Your Highness, the emperor wants to invite you to play Go,” Fude said hurriedly,.”His Majesty is addicted to Go, but there is no opponent in the palace. Only you can play against His Majesty a few rounds.”</p>
<p><em>Her library pagoda!</em> Ye Zhen’s heart moved. The last time she had lost to Mo Rongzhan in eight rounds, it still made her slightly uneasy. “Isn’t the emperor playing polo with Little Prince?” she asked.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu smiled and said, “The emperor came back after playing only one round with Little Prince. After going through the memorial for a while, he suddenly wanted to play Go.”</p>
<p><em>Sigh, why does the emperor have to go through all this? If he likes Third Miss Lu so much, why pretend not to care and watch as the empress dowager made her a princess? Now although there are more opportunities to get closer to her, she has already become a princess… Who knows what happened late last night, the princess doesn’t seem to be aware at all…</em></p>
<p>“Let’s go then!” All that was on Ye Zhen’s mind was the library pagoda. For all you know, she could even win a game today!</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu did not expect the princess to actually agree. He thought in his heart that the emperor really understood the princess. As long as playing Go was mentioned, she would definitely go.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Palace of Heavenly Purity, even from a distance, they caught sight of a slender figure standing outside. Ye Zhen recognized Xu Huiru at a glance.</p>
<p><em>The empress dowager had only just asked her to care more about the emperor, and indeed she immediately came to the Palace of Heavenly Purity to look for Mo Rongzhan. However, seeing that she has been standing outside, could it be that Mo Rongzhan did not let her in?</em></p>
<p>“Xianfei, good fortune unto you.” Fude went up and bowed to her. “Your Grace, what are you…?”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru had also seen Ye Zhen, she was slightly startled, but said with a smile, “The empress dowager asked me to send some snacks to His Majesty. Eunuch Fu, can you please relay the message to him.”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu was stunned. He looked back at Ye Zhen for a moment, before responding in a low voice, “Yes, Your grace.”</p>
<p>“Princess, did Gui Fei Lu ask you to see the emperor?” Xu Huiru surmised that Ye Zhen appearing here had to be for Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was very pleased she misunderstood. “Some things, unfortunately, have a last resort.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru nodded. “I understand your difficulties. However, I am afraid that you may not be able to see the emperor.”</p>
<p>Based on her observations these days, the emperor had completely lost interest in Lu Wushuang. Lu Yaoyao was here to plead on her cousin’s behalf, but it would most likely be in vain.</p>
<p><em>It seems that there is no need to play Go with Mo Rongzhan today. He should be more willing to spend time with Xu Huiru, after all, she is his new favorite concubine. Forget it, I’ll just win him in another round. </em>Ye Zhen deliberately ignored some of the unpleasantness bubbling within her at the moment, she decided she was not eager to know how much Mo Rongzhan liked Xu Huiru.</p>
<p>Just when Ye Zhen wanted to turn around and leave, Fude came out. “Your Imperial Highness, the emperor invites you to go in.”</p>
<p>The confident smile plastered on Xu Huiru’s face froze slightly, and she looked at Eunuch Fu in surprise.</p>
<p>Fude lowered his head and said, “Your Grace, HIs Majesty said, he is in no habit of eating snacks. May you take them back and enjoy them yourself.”</p>
<p><em>What?!</em> Xu Huiru suddenly felt as if she had been slapped in the face. <em>What did the Emperor mean by this? Why is the emperor be willing to meet Ye Zhen and not her? She had already made it very clear that she was ordered by the empress dowager to give him a snack… Even if he really didn’t like it, for the sake of the empress dowager, he should see her first!</em></p>
<p>Xu Huiru blanched, and she determinedly looked at Ye Zhen. <em>Does the emperor still have Lu Wushuang in his heart? Does he know that Lu Yaoyao came to see him for her?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen reckoned Xu Huiru must be very dissatisfied. She didn’t say anything. At this time, no matter what she said, it would be futile.</p>
<p>“Princess, please,” Fude said to Ye Zhen quietly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded to Xu Huiru and walked in.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru suppressed the anger surging in her heart, and said to her hand-maiden Qianlan beside her, “Let’s go back.”</p>
<p>“Your Grace—” Qianlan looked at Xu Huiru hesitatingly.</p>
<p>“I thought that Lu Wushuang has already fallen out of his favor, but now it seems that the emperor is still nostalgic about his previous feelings.” Xu Huiru was uncontrollably jealous that Lu Wushuang could get the emperor’s attention.</p>
