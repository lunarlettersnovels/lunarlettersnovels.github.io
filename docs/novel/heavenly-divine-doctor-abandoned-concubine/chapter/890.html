            <p><strong>Chapter 439 – Forcing the Emperor to Abdicate</strong></p>
<p>Xu Huiru’s heart was pounding. For some reason, she regretted what she had just said on impulse. The empress dowager seemed to love Lu Yaoyao very much. Even if she found out that she looked like Ye Zhen, her opinions wouldn’t have changed now. The only thing she could bet on was the emperor’s disgust for the Ye family and his repugnance for Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes were dark, no one was able to discern his thoughts.</p>
<p>The empress dowager frowned slightly and felt a little dislike rising towards Xu Huiru who brought up this topic.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this concubine was afraid that it would upset you, so she would rather not state it. In fact, this concubine also merely felt so for a short moment, but unexpectedly didn’t pay much attention to it before,” Xu Huiru said awkwardly while also showing she was embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Since it makes one unhappy, then forget it,” the empress dowager said lightly.</p>
<p><em>What is going on with Xu Huiru? Why is she deliberately targeting Yaoyao today?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan understood what Xu Huiru really wanted to say better than the empress dowager. He had always thought that this girl was a knowledgeable, gentle, and dignified woman, different from Lu Wushuang, which was why he had never mistreated her even though he wasn’t interested in her. It seems that women are all the same. If you are too generous with them, they change into a totally different person.</p>
<p>“Beloved concubine, who do you think Yaoyao looks like?” Mo Rongzhan asked lightly.</p>
<p>Seeing Mo Rongzhan inquire, Xu Huiru felt a little nervous yet happy. “This concubine feels that… Yaoyao looks a bit like Ye Zhen.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager rose in anger. “What are you talking about? Have you met Ye Zhen before? Why would Yaoyao look similar to her?”</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager, don’t be angry. This concubine hasn’t seen Ye Zhen for a few years. Although she was a fellow schoolmate before, this one doesn’t remember her very much. It was just a few short moments of impressions. Perhaps it was this concubine who remembered her wrong,” Xu Huiru hurriedly said.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan glanced at her with a faint smile. “You are right. Yaoyao does look very similar to Ye Zhen.”</p>
<p>The faces of Xu Huiru and the empress dowager changed slightly.</p>
<p><em>The emperor has known about it all along?</em></p>
<p>“But what does this have to do with Yaoyao?” Mo Rongzhan looked at Xu Huiru coldly,</p>
<p>“Also, is this worth so much for Xu Xianfei to make a fuss about?”</p>
<p>“This concubine… this concubine thought….” Xu Huiru didn’t expect that the emperor would know that Ye Zhen and Lu Yaoyao were similar.</p>
<p><em>Now that he knows, why is still being so good to Lu Yaoyao?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan said coldly, “One thinks Yaoyao looks like Ye Zhen, so should <em>zhen</em> hate her?”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru hurriedly knelt down. “Your Majesty, this concubine did not mean that.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager was also surprised. She also thought that the emperor hated Ye Zhen. If she knew that Yaoyao looked like Ye Zhen then she would have certainly not become fond of her, but she didn’t expect her son would have known about this for long now.</p>
<p>“Ye Zhen is <em>zhen’s</em> former wang fei, do you think I don’t know what she looks like? She is her, Yaoyao is Yaoyao, two different people, can I still be confused enough to treat them as one and the same person?” Mo Rongzhan asked Xu Huiru in a cold voice.</p>
<p>The empress dowager smiled with satisfaction as if things ought to be as such.</p>
<p>In her heart, Xu Huiru regretted her actions greatly. She felt she really shouldn’t have been obsessed with her, let alone try to squeeze Lu Yaoyao in front of the empress dowager and the emperor. Now she hadn’t even succeeded in forcing aside that but had upset the empress dowager whose favour she had earned with great difficulty.</p>
<p>“This concubine was ignorant.” Xu Huiru knelt down.</p>
<p>“Get up,” Mo Rongzhan said lightly,  his perception of Xu Huiru had changed.</p>
<p><em>If a woman wants to pretend, she can pretend very well.</em></p>
<p>[TL: You talk as if you never did anything, Mo Rongzhan -_- ]</p>
<p>The empress dowager no longer paid attention to Xu Huiru but looked at Mo Rongzhan with a smile. “Your Majesty, I see that you appear to be much better today. It seems that Mister Chen and Yaoyao took good care of you.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded. “Yaoyao gave me medicine today, saying that everything will be fine in two days.”</p>
<p>“If it is truly as such then that is great.” The empress dowager’s heart that had been hanging since a few days finally relaxed. “Your Majesty, will you appear in the imperial court tomorrow morning?”</p>
<p>“Let’s see tomorrow.” Mo Rongzhan smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru just stood by and said nothing. She wanted to quickly figure out how to convince the empress dowager and the emperor that she was not deliberately targeting Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Your Majesty…!” Eunuch Fu suddenly dashed in in a trice. “It’s not good, the fifth prince had surrounded the palace with his troops.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan immediately stood up from his bed. “Is there hope of holding them back?”</p>
<p>The empress dowager worriedly grabbed Mo Rongzhan’s hand. “Your Majesty, what should be done?”</p>
<p>“Fude, have the Yulin Army send the empress dowager back to Cining Palace first,” Mo Rongzhan instructed, since that little snake’s patience was gone, he didn’t need to pretend to be sick anymore.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” Seeing that the emperor was still calm, Eunuch Fu knew that today would be the death of the fifth prince and the Old Prince Kang. There was no fear in his heart, and he immediately went out and relayed the emperor’s instructions to General Wei and had the letter send someone to escort the empress dowager and Xu Xianfei.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan took off the clothes on the screen and quickly put them on. When Xu Huiru wanted to come forward and help him, he pushed her away. “Go back to the inner palace.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the princess… She… she went to the Imperial Physician’s Courtyard.” Eunuch Fu remembered that the courtyard was not far from the palace gate and suddenly became a little worried.</p>
<p>“What?” Mo Rongzhan’s eyes were cold. “Why did she go to the Imperial Physician’s Courtyard?”</p>
