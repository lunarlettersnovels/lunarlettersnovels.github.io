<p>Any man who had a woman waiting for him for that many years would feel vain. And despite everything, Lu Shiming was still a man.</p>

<p>Truly, this was a big problem. As a daughter, as Lu Yaoyao rather, she could not interfere with Lu Shiming’s affairs. Left unattended, Xue Liu would be capable of causing havoc between the married couple.</p>
<p>The havoc which Pei Shi would not be able to resolve. A havoc in which Lu Shiming’s interests would decide the outcome.</p>
<p>Now knowing the reason, Ye Zhen was at a loss. With a heavy sigh, she turned to look towards the shi chen<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup> and frowned, noting the time. With another smaller sigh, Ye Zhen pushed herself to stand, her lips forming into a small frown.</p>
<p>“Mother still hasn’t come back and Teacher Shan is still waiting for me. I’ll come back later when she returns.”</p>
<p>Hai Tang, after acknowledging and promising to tell the third madam of her daughter’s current and future visit, accompanied Ye Zhen to send her off. As they left the room, they caught sight of Xue Liu still standing at a corner of the courtyard, fuming.</p>
<p>Shooting a weak smile towards that direction, Ye Zhen said her goodbyes and went back to her courtyard.</p>
<p>In the evening, Pei Shi actually came to find her.</p>
<p>“Mother, I was just about to go and find you when you came,” Ye Zhen said with a smile after curtsying and offering her respects. Pei Shi looked at her daughter’s bright smile and smiled weakly in return.</p>
<p>“Mother didn’t bother you when I know you were going to study this afternoon.” She replied as Ye Zhen reached out to hold her hand, guiding her to sit at the table.</p>
<p>With a shake of her head, Ye Zhen immediately dismissed that idea, claiming her mother would never bother her.</p>
<p>“In fact, I wanted to talk to you about something today.” Ye Zhen chirped as she turned to look at Pei Shi with wide, impish eyes and pout, fluttering her eyelashes as she did as a child.</p>
<p>Pei Shi, amused at her daughter’s antics, squeezed her hand, idly comparing Ye Zhen’s look to that of a begging puppy. “Oh? What is it?”</p>
<p>“Mother, I heard that there was a hot spring pool in the suburbs and our family currently owns the <sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="2"><a>2</a></sup>Zhuangzi! Shall we go and stay there for a few days?” Ye Zhen asked softly, her eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>“Hot springs?” Pei Shi paused, tilting her head as she observed her daughter. “How did you think of going to the hot springs?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen instantly smiled and said, “Hot spring bathing can make people happy physically and mentally. It can also nourish the body. Shall we stay for a few days?”</p>
<p>“Then you don’t need Teacher Shan to study?” Pei Shi knew that her daughter wanted her to lighten her spirits. She felt warm in her heart, yet at the same time, she felt guilty about the depression she had suffered in recent days.</p>
<p>Truth be told, Lu Shiming did not remember Xue Liu, at all. He did not even ask her to come and kowtow for so many days, stating clearly that he did not want to talk to the woman.</p>
<p>However, she still resented that the woman posed a threat to their relationship. All because of Lu Shiming’s frivolous youth!</p>
<p>In order not to let her feel sad and angry, Lu Shiming had lived in the rear courtyard for days now. Really, if things kept on being like this, their feelings of husband and wife would eventually fade.</p>
<p>“Teacher Shan will go with us. Studying there will certainly get twice the result with half the effort,” Ye Zhen said quickly.</p>
<p>Pei Shi smiled and nodded her head. “Then I’ll discuss it with your father.”</p>
