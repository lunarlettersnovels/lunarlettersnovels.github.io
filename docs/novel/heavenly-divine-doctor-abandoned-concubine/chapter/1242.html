            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 85 – Questions (2)</h3>
<p>On the other side, when Tang Zhen returned to Chengde Mountain Villa, he devoted a massive effort in his investigation, trying to find out why Lu Xiangzhi’s horse behaved feral leading to its death.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8"></div>
<p>When he got substantial information in his hands, he went to see Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“The two boys in the stables have already been taken for interrogations. Those who offered Lu Lingzhi’s brother the horse are separately locked up, the assistant minister sent people down the hill to retrieve the body of the horse and examined it…”</p>
<p>The marquis could be seen flipping on a book of herbs as he continued.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the horse was fed with golden ragwort**. Its leaves look ordinary but are really poisonous and drive the horse that ingested it to madness. If the horse did not fall off the cliff, it would still die eventually.” Tang Zhen reported his findings.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan listened silently, then asked in a low voice, “Do you know who ordered it?”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen thought for a moment and said in a low voice, “The boys feeding the horses don’t even know where these leaves came from. Wang Han, who is in charge of feeding the horses, disappeared this morning. I have already sent someone out to look for him.”</p>
<p>The emperor’s mouth twisted into an unpleasant sneer.</p>
<p>“This matter… may have something to do with the deposed emperor of the previous dynasty.” The marquis finished.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan didn’t kill the puppet emperor; he’d imprisoned him instead. However, some people still supported the deposed emperor and hoped for him to retake the world.</p>
<p>“Then find out who has seen the deposed emperor recently.” He ordered, his eyes glowering in anger.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen nodded. “This marquis will check it out.”</p>
<p>“You can go now.” Mo Rongzhan motioned with his hand. But when Tang Zhen was almost at the door, he suddenly stopped him.</p>
<p>“What’s the name of Lu Lingzhi’s sister?”</p>
<p>His shoulders tensed instantly upon the mention of Lu Yaoyao. Tang Zhen grimly faced the emperor once again.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Third Miss Lu… she is called Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen felt sour. <i>Is the emperor really interested in her? If Mo Rongzhan desires it, before he could make Ye Zhen like him, he’d be forced to watch her enter the palace…</i></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan lowered his eyes and clasped his fingers on the table. “Did you lose your silver whip to her?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this marquis indeed lost his silver whip to Third Miss Lu.”</p>
<p>“I see. You are dismissed.” Mo Rongzhan nodded gently.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just a coincidence, Third Miss Lu had never been to the capital in the last few years and could not possibly have saved him.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen looked up at Mo Rongzhan for a moment. Seeing that he was not interested in the third miss anymore, he felt a little relieved. He bowed his head before leaving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Still puzzled by the third miss’ earlier tirade, Tang Zhen decided to pay Lu Lingzhi a visit. On the way, he met Pei Shi who came to deliver the medicine she had decocted herself.</p>
<p>“Madam Lu, you should leave these matters to the servants. you don’t have to decoct the medicine yourself.” Tang Zhen thought it was the maid-in-waiting who snubbed Third Madam Lu. He grudgingly scowled at the eunuch standing beside her.</p>
<p>The eunuch lowered his head and quickly explained. “With due respect to the marquis, this eunuch told the same thing to Madam Lu but-“</p>
<p>Pei Shi laughed and shook her head. “I want to decoct the medicine myself; others are not as skilled as I am.”</p>
<p>When Lu Lingzhi took the medicine, Pei Shi stepped out of the room, leaving Lu Lingzhi and Tang Zhen in the chambers.</p>
<p>“Have you found out?”</p>
<p>“It has something to do with the man in captivity. I think he was trying to deal with you.” Tang Zhen disdainfully informed. “As for who ordered it, I need to investigate more thoroughly.”</p>
<p>Satisfied with the information, Lu Lingzhi shut his eyes until Tang Zhen spoke again.</p>
<p>“Until then, I have another thing to ask you.”</p>
