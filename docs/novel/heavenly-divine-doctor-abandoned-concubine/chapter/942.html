            <p><strong>Chapter 387 – Frightened to Tears (1)</strong></p>
<p>After Huangfu Chen left the imperial study, Mo Rongzhan began to read through the memorials sent to the study. If it weren’t for Eunuch Fu’s report that Huangfu Chen was helping Ye Zhen with drying the herbs in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard, he would not have rushed here.</p>
<p>It was just that when he arrived at the medicine storehouse, he did not see Huangfu Chen’s figure there. However, he <em>did</em> see the little girl sitting in the corner oblivious to her surroundings. Looking at her expressive face, frowning and smiling from time to time, Mo Rongzhan’s heart felt as if it was doused by warm water, he was reluctant to disturb her.</p>
<p>He wanted to go to her and see what she was doing. However, he didn’t expect that she would suddenly stand up and get frightened by his arrival.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” As soon as Ye Zhen saw Mo Rongzhan, her delicate face sank.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan released her shoulder and coughed lightly before he said, “I stopped by to have a look. Were you drying all these herbs outside?”</p>
<p><em>What is the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard doing?! Don’t they know she’s a princess?! Even if she wanted to be treated like any other physician and female physician, she still shouldn’t be allowed to suffer like this!</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty’s ‘on-the-way’ is rather too far, don’t you think so?” Ye Zhen was disinclined to pay attention to him. “Anyway, will you please go once you’ve seen the whole thing?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan didn’t respond. He simply looked inside the medicine storehouse but didn’t see Huangfu Chen there. The only thing he saw was a room filled with moldy herbs, and he frowned. “The medicine storehouse is so dirty? What’s wrong with those herbs? Do the imperial physicians dare to use these moldy herbs to concoct the medicine the palace uses?!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said, “They certainly do not dare do that. These moldy herbs are going to be disposed of, but honestly, it’s somewhat a pity that good herbs became moldy like this because of lack of proper storehouse.”</p>
<p>“How come you’re doing such a task?” Mo Rongzhan asked with a calm and collected expression. However, underneath the calm, a storm was raging. He himself couldn’t wait to hold her on top of his palm and treasure her dearly, never letting her be hurt, yet someone dared to treat her like this.</p>
<p>“If you had not delayed me in the imperial garden last night, I wouldn’t have had to dry the herbs today,” Ye Zhen stated, glaring at him angrily.</p>
<p>With a countenance as cold as ice, Mo Rongzhan angrily ordered Eunuch Fu, “Go and get Gong Tang for zhen.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen immediately stomped her foot and snapped at Eunuch Fu. “<strong>Don’t!</strong>” She then turned to stare at Mo Rongzhan and asked, “What exactly do you want to do? What you’re doing will just make people think that my identity is different from my colleagues! Can’t my superiors command me to work?”</p>
<p>“It still depends on what kind of jobs they have you do. And you shouldn’t do these kinds of jobs that even eunuchs and maids don’t do,” Mo Rongzhan said coldly.</p>
<p>“Will you mind your own business?” She had endured the difficulties Imperial Physician Huang deliberately set on her path because she didn’t want people to think that she was special on the first day she entered the imperial hospital. However, that didn’t mean that she was a soft steamed stuffed bun that could be eaten as one pleased. Would she obediently comply with what Imperial Physician Huang wanted the next time she targeted her?</p>
<p>Anyway, there were others who did not like Imperial Physician Huang, so there was no need for her to deal with her on her own as there were those who would be willing to do it for her. However, that person could not be Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>Feeling spurned, Mo Rongzhan looked at her with deep eyes that seemed to overflow with silent sorrow, it numbed Ye Zhen’s scalp.</p>
<p>“If you go to find Chief Gong, other people will only think that I’m someone who takes advantage of my position as a princess to bully people. They will think that I run and complain to you about every small thing. If that happens, then how am I supposed to survive in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard in the future?” Ye Zhen whispered, unconsciously trying to explain her point of view to cajole him.</p>
<p>“You are a magnificent princess. Although you’re now also an imperial physician, that doesn’t change your status as a princess. You can definitely live as you want in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard. Who dares to do anything to you?” Mo Rongzhan coldly said.</p>
<p>Unable to make him understand her point, Ye Zhen bit her lower lip in frustration. And in the end, she forcefully said, “Anyway, you’re not allowed to do that.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan raised his eyebrow and looked at her as if she was acting like a spoiled little girl. So, when he next spoke, he couldn’t help the amusement that slipped past his guard. “What if zhen absolutely insists on summoning Gong Tang to us?”</p>
<p>“That’s naturally your business.” Ye Zhen snorted coldly and turned around, walking into the medicine storehouse to dispose of those moldy herbs.</p>
<p>“Angry?” Mo Rongzhan hurriedly followed after her. At the sight of her strained delicate face, he couldn’t help laughing. “Zhen is not going to do it. Don’t be angry.”</p>
