            <p><strong>Chapter 512 – The Epidemic Improves</strong></p>
<p>“Your Highness, forgive me I’m late.” Xue Lin rushed into the village. Seeing Ye Zhen brewing the medicine, he felt guilty. If only he had rushed back earlier, who would have dared to wrong the princess? “Your Highness, you’ve been wronged.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was very happy to see Xue Lin. “You’re back? How’s the investigation?”</p>
<p>She had discovered that there was something wrong with the medicinal herbs that Xu Ji had sent to the store, so she asked Xue Lin to investigate where this batch of herbs came from. If she could find the source, she believed that the whereabouts of the missing herbs would be revealed.</p>
<p>Xue Lin couldn’t help but laugh. “Your Highness, you’re still concerned about the medicinal herbs.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her eyebrows. “Other than treating these patients, I’m really most concerned about the medicinal herbs.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, those medicinal herbs were delivered directly from the governor-general’s mansion.” Xue Lin lowered his voice and said, “I went down to investigate. There are still many medicinal herbs in his mansion’s treasury. Someone must have deliberately included that sack in the medical bureau store to call our attention to it.”</p>
<p>“Governor-general’s mansion?” Ye Zhen revealed a meaningful smile. “This Governor-general Zhang seems quite interesting.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, as long as we continue to investigate Governor-general Zhang, we might be able to find who bought those medicinal herbs,” Xue Lin asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wanted to ask Xue Lin to investigate but then thought of something. The light in her eyes dimmed. “Since it’s related to Governor-general Zhang, it would not be suitable for us to continue the investigation. Relay your findings to the emperor and have him send someone to investigate the truth.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.” Xue Lin looked at Ye Zhen skeptically. <em>Why do I feel that the princess now seems to care about this matter a little differently?</em></p>
<p>“Since you’ve already entered the village, then help us feed the patients,” Ye Zhen said taking a bowl of medicinal soup from the side. “Drink this first, then put on the mask.”</p>
<p>Xue Lin immediately followed suit. “Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen’s fever had just calmed down, so Ye Zhen didn’t want him to overwork. With Xue Lin’s help things would be just fine, so she went over to take the bowl of soup in Huangfu Chen’s hand. “Master, get some rest!”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Huangfu Chen looked at her with a gentle smile. “Most of the fever has subsided. I should be fine after drinking the medicine for another couple of days.”</p>
<p>The recuperating villagers looked at them with tears in their eyes. “You are the reincarnated parents of everyone in our village. If it weren’t for you, we would have died long ago…”</p>
<p>“That’s right, you’re really saving the world…”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen saw that they were about to struggle and kowtow, so she hurriedly stopped them. “We know how grateful you are. We are doctors, and doctors only exist for the sake of treating illnesses. Don’t say anything. Rest well and drink the medicine.”</p>
<p>“We will never forget your kindness,” an old man proclaimed loudly.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen stood on the side, smiling at his little apprentice who was feeding the medicine. In the past, he did not think Yaoyaao liked to be a doctor. Being a real doctor was different from being a doctor in the palace. Now as he looked at her, he knew that he had been wrong. She understood the spirit of being a doctor better than the other doctors.</p>
<p>After making sure that everyone had had the medicine, Ye Zhen put away the bowl of medicine and had Dai Mei sterilize it with boiling water.</p>
<p>“Master, why are you still outside? Quickly go to the room and rest,” When she turned around and found Huangfu Chen still standing outside, she grumbled helplessly.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled and said, “You really think that I’m someone who can be blown away.”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you just recovered? It’s always good to be careful.” Ye Zhen smiled playfully.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at her bright smile. The sadness that had settled in her eyes not too long ago, seemed to have disappeared. For some reason, he felt that this little apprentice of his was even more heartbreaking. She hid her thoughts so deeply that people thought she couldn’t care less.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao!” Tang Zhen had been looking around the village for a while before he finally saw the person he was looking for. He hurriedly ran over and also found Huangfu Chen there. He cupped his hands and bowed. “Mr. Huangfu.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him in surprise. “Big Brother Tang, why are you here?”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen looked at her helplessly and angrily. “You secretly ran to Huaijiang. Old Madam Lu and Lord Lu are worried sick.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t I fine?” Ye Zhen recalled that she had come to Huaijiang without the knowledge of the Lu family. She would be scolded upon return.</p>
<p>“The emperor asked me to bring you back to the capital,” Tang Zhen whispered.</p>
<p>The smile on Ye Zhen’s face faded. “When it’s time for me to return, I will naturally go back.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at Ye Zhen with pity. “You talk to the Marquis of Jing Ning. I’ll go and rest first.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded lightly. She glanced at Tang Zhen and walked to the side. Tang Zhen followed her. “Yaoyao, you’ve been away from the capital for a long time. If you don’t go back, Old Madam Lu will be very worried about you.”</p>
<p>“I still don’t want to go back to the capital,” Ye Zhen said calmly. “I’ll get someone to send a letter back to tell Grandmother that she doesn’t have to worry about me.”</p>
<p>“The emperor is also very worried about you.” Tang Zhen’s eyes flashed with sadness.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said coldly, “I don’t need to worry about him. Big Brother Tang, go back. I have Master here. Hasn’t the emperor kept Xue Lin by my side?”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen walked two steps faster and blocked her way. He frowned at the little girl’s cold face. “Yaoyao, did something happen?”</p>
<p>He remembered what she and the emperor looked like in the villa… they seemed to have mutual feelings for each other and so in harmony. <em>But why does it seem like she seems to have some misunderstanding with the emperor today?</em></p>
<p>“No.” Ye Zhen smiled. “It’s just that it’s hard for the emperor to remember me at this time. With a beauty by his side, he would not have time to think of his younger sister.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen was stunned. “You know… about Ye Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“Ye Yaoyao?” Ye Zhen almost burst out laughing when she heard this name. Now, she was even more certain that this woman had something to do with Lu Lingzhi. “Big Brother Tang, was this Ye Yaoyao found by my eldest brother?”</p>
<p>“How did you know that the emperor brought Ye Yaoyao to the palace?” Tang Zhen asked in surprise. He had gone to look for Lu Lingzhi when he left the capital. He had known about the existence of this woman beforehand, so he was not that surprised to hear about this on the way.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “If someone wants me to know, someone will naturally tell me.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen said, “When I left the capital, Ye Yaoyao wasn’t in the palace. I heard from your eldest brother…” Tang Zhen told Ye Zhen about that day he went to look for Lu Lingzhi. Lu Lingzhi had told him that Eldest Master Lu had placed the emperor’s savior under house arrest. “This is how it was. The emperor is only just grateful that he was saved by Ye Yaoyao. I heard that she lost her memory and can’t remember anything.”</p>
<p>“Saviour!” Ye Zhen chuckled softly, a trace of ridicule in her eyes. “No matter how many saviors the emperor has, it doesn’t have anything to do with me. Brother Tang, thanks for coming to look for me. I’m really fine.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao—”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen waved her hand. “I don’t want to talk about this anymore.”</p>
<p>She didn’t want to hear anything about Mo Rongzhan.</p>
