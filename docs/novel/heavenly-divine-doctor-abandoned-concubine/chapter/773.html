            <p><strong>Chapter 558 – Treat Her As Dead</strong></p>
<p>“Back then, His Majesty didn’t agree to Tang Zhen’s proposal, so I could somewhat guess,” Lu Lingzhi said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi naturally wouldn’t say that he saw Mo Rongzhan coming to her boudoir late at night. If he said that, he was afraid she would ignore him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>“Then you don’t need to worry about it,” Ye Zhen said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi gazed at her cold visage under the moonlight. When all was said and done, he was still unable to tell what she felt for the emperor. The decree today should have hurt her to the core. He could see that she was stunned at that time as if she had never expected it. So, currently, she should be very sad.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao…,” Lu Lingzhi looked at her tenderly and said, “I won’t be Eldest Brother in the future, okay?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen eyed him suspiciously. <em>Is he sick in the head*? This is ridiculous! I have never treated him like an elder brother— he is my enemy!</em></p>
<p>[*literally translated, was he poisoned]</p>
<p>“Are u still sick in the head**? You should have some medicine.”</p>
<p>[**poisoned again]</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi laughed hoarsely. “I have already recovered, I don’t need to take medicine anymore.”</p>
<p>“I’m leaving first.” She didn’t want to be with him for a moment longer now.</p>
<p>He wanted to tell her that even if the emperor asked her to marry her, she should not agree, but he held back for once he said it, she would definitely reject him even more. “I’ll take you back.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen eyed him vigilantly, not letting him get too close to her. But then, she suddenly thought of the dead Lu Wushuang. “Is Lu Wushuang really dead?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was slightly taken aback. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“Because Lu Wushuang wouldn’t be willing to die like that,” she stated matter of factly. At first, she really thought that Lu Wushuang was dead, but upon contemplation, she concluded that it was impossible. Considering Lu Wushuang’s personality, coupled with Lu Lingzhi’s temperament, she would never die this easily.</p>
<p>“You really don’t like Shuang’er,” he said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sneered, <em>why should I like her?</em></p>
<p>“No matter what happens to Shuang’er, you won’t see her again, just treat her as dead.”</p>
<p>Now Lu Lingzhi was eager to win Ye Zhen’s trust, and naturally, he wouldn’t want to make her unhappy because of Lu Wushuang’s affairs.</p>
<p><em>Just pretend she’s dead?</em> <em>It seems that Lu Wushuang’s death is really strange</em>.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, you really can do anything for Lu Wushuang,” she remarked nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi thought she was referring to his crime of deceiving the emperor regardless of the dangers to the Lu family. He sighed and said, “You have also seen that the emperor’s favor is ephemeral, do you really want Shuang’er to be alone in the mountains for the rest of her life?”</p>
<p><em>That’s her* retribution!</em> Ye Zhen’s eyes at Lu Lingzhi became colder and colder, “For her, you can do anything, including murder and arson?”</p>
<p>[*Lu Wushuang]</p>
<p>“Yaoyao?!” Lu Lingzhi stared at her stunned. He suddenly thought back to how he had forced Ye Zhen to drink poisonous wine and set fire to the Qin Estate. <em>No, Yaoyao would never know these things, I am just overthinking.</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not want Lu Lingzhi to doubt her origins again, so she took big steps and strode away, unwilling to speak to him anymore.</p>
<p>He caught up with her and embraced her when she had let down her guard. “What I can do for Shuang’er, I can also do it for you… And even more… Yaoyao, I won’t do anything you won’t like, okay?”</p>
<p>“Lu Lingzhi, what are you doing? Let me go!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was absolutely shocked. When she came back today she felt that something was wrong with this man… Then when he had suddenly brought her here tonight this strange feeling had only deepened.</p>
<p><em>Has he gone crazy?</em></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I don’t want to scare you.” Lu Lingzhi resisted the urge to kiss her. “I am glad you aren’t my cousin, I really am.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen regretted not bringing her sleeve arrow, she’d thought she didn’t need to use it at home. Had she been carrying one, she would’ve definitely shot him to death without a moment’s hesitation. “Let me go, don’t make me sick. ”</p>
<p>However, Lu Lingzhi interpreted it wrongly. He thought she was concerned about the relationship between the two of them. He told himself that he must not frighten her or push her further, so he let go of her shoulders. “Yaoyao, I don’t want to be your big brother.”</p>
<p>“That’s great, I never wanted you to be your big brother,” Ye Zhen said with a sneer.</p>
<p><em>How about being a marquis’ wife?</em> Lu Lingzhi asked in his heart, afraid that asking aloud would make her hate him even more. He sighed and said, “I’ll take you back.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen kept a distance of five steps from him, and finally returned to her courtyard. When Lu Lingzhi opened his mouth to say something to her, she had already entered the door and had the maid close it behind her.</p>
<p>Seeing her slender figure disappearing behind the door, Lu Lingzhi laughed dumbly.</p>
<p>Although this little girl was the same as Ye Zhen, she seemed to be somewhat different. However, when he looked at her, he always thought of Ye Zhen involuntarily.</p>
<p>Having known Ye Zhen for two years, he knew that she was deliberately suppressing her true temperament. If she wasn’t trying to please Mo Rongzhan at the time, would she have been as willful as Yaoyao?</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi stood outside the courtyard for a long time before turning around and disappearing into the night; a black shadow silently followed him.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, you’re back.” Yu Ping who was at the door rushed to greet her mistress.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s go inside.” Ye Zhen nodded to the other.</p>
<p>“This servant said that you are staying in the upper hall…” Yu Ping whispered.</p>
<p>“That’s the right thing to say,” she replied.</p>
<p>The other maids had already fetched water for Ye Zhen to wash.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen tidied up, and when she lay on the bed again, she recalled the strangeness of Lu Lingzhi today.</p>
<p><em>What did he mean?</em></p>
<p>It seemed that something was really different about him. This difference frightened her to the bone. She vaguely seemed to guess the answer, but the answer made her sick to the core, and she didn’t want to explore it at all.</p>
<p>She decided to ignore this strangeness, no matter what, she would not let him off this time.</p>
<p>As for Mo Rongzhan… Thinking of his inexplicable imperial decree, Ye Zhen was filled with frustration. She couldn’t understand what he wanted to do. He had led her to believe that he was going to bestow her a marriage. It was absolutely impossible. On their way back to the capital, every time a man shot her a second glance, a certain someone would be seen sulking for a long time. She would definitely not believe that he was willing to marry her to someone else. As such, she couldn’t quite fathom his intentions.</p>
<p><em>Forget it, let him be, it is impossible for me to enter the palace anyway.</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen calmed down and stopped thinking about those annoying things. Now that she had returned, she would have to face it, no matter what it was.</p>
<p>She didn’t know if her master was back. She had thought that having found her after years of searching, he would spend the rest of his life with Mu Qing, never once thinking that she would die at Zhao Mingxiao’s hands.</p>
<p><em>Zhao Mingxiao should not end well, Master will not let him off.</em></p>
