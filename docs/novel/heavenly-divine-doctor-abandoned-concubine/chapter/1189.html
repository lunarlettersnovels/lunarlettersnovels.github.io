            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 138 – The Wang Fei Summons (1)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen watched Qi Jin and her grandchild disappear into the crowd. She did not know why, but she had an intuition that she would see them again soon.</p>
<p>“Miss, that woman is very rude! You saved her grandson but she didn’t even leave her name!” Dai Mei grunted, defending her miss against this kind of injustice.</p>
<p>“Let her be. Maybe we’ll meet again in the future. Besides, her gratitude is enough.” Ye Zhen could only smile at the thought of the bizarre woman. “We must go home.”</p>
<p>Today, she had stayed outside for too long, which she wasn’t originally used to.</p>
<p>After becoming Wang Fei, she hardly went out. But now as Lu Yaoyao, she figured that she should get used to this gradually. As her father once said, women should not only isolate themselves in their chambers, but they also should have their own wonderful life.</p>
<p>In the past, she didn’t understand Ye Yiqing’s words, but now she realized that what her father had said was all for her sake. Being the wang fei, propriety hindered her from doing several things she used to do. Her father watched her sink into pitfalls and could not bear to see her hurt like that for long. So, he urged her to make herself feel better and do the things she formerly wanted.</p>
<p>Now, Ye Zhen no longer desired to change herself to please others. With the chance of rebirth, she must have a wonderful life for herself and for her sister, instead of seeking approval from others. The opportunities she missed and the people that come with it, she would seize this time.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was in high spirits. She opened her hand to look at the flaming phoenix tattoo in her palm. Her medical skill was still not perfect but it didn’t matter. She had the ability to never forget anything and she also had the <i>lingquan </i>that could heal injuries. What was there to be worried about?</p>
<p>She would enter the palace to become an imperial physician and those who once dismissed her and harmed her would crawl under her feet.</p>
<p>Upon returning to Lu Mansion, Ye Zhen went to Pei Shi first and told her about Teacher Shan’s return to the academy. The latter was very happy and felt that in this way, her daughter could continue learning from her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed. “I am very glad too.”</p>
<p>“The old madam seems to be looking for you. Please go and greet her quickly.” Pei Shi urged her daughter.</p>
<p>“Then I must go to my grandmother but first, accept these perfumes I bought for you. I was told that these just came from overseas!” Ye Zhen took out two bottles of perfume from the side of her. “I have smelled it and it is quite good.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi smiled and said, “Oh my, you have really grown up. You never paid attention to these things before!”</p>
<p>On that note, Ye Zhen laughed out loud. “Teacher Shan said that girls who do not like beauty products will naturally not look good, so I bought these.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh, now I think my daughter is getting quite loquacious!”</p>
<p>“Well Mother, I am pleased to amuse you by being so.” Ye Zhen smiled then went off to bring Old Madam Lu the rest of the perfumes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<div data-fuse="22037344116" data-fuse-code="fuse-slot-22037344116-1" data-fuse-slot="71161633/WORD_wordexcerpt/chapter_incontent_2"></div>
<p>Old Madam Lu’s room was bustling as the elderly liked to have their children and grandchildren around.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I’m back!” She had yet to see the figure of Ye Zhen but her sweet, pleasant voice told her of her arrival.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen came in and saw that several other sisters were all there, offering gifts to Old Madam Lu and to one another. Then she sat down and took out the bag of perfume. “I just passed by Qianjin on Shajing Lane and heard that everything there was from overseas. I thought the perfume smelled excellent, so I bought several bottles for my grandma and sisters.”</p>
<p>To her surprise, Lu Jing scoffed in distaste. “Third Elder Sister, unless you forgot what our family does? We are merchants so then, do you think that we are still short of anything from overseas? Besides, Qianjin is our sworn enemy and you went there to buy their things! Do you think that our family’s establishments are not as good as theirs?!”</p>
