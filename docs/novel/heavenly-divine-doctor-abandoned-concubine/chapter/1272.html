<p>Ye Zhen stood aside for a moment and passed by silently as she didn’t wish to disturb Teacher Shan. Doing so, she couldn’t help but notice the luscious flowers that had bloomed because of her <i>lingquan.</i></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><em>Lingquan – the miraculous liquid.</em></span></p>
<p>The servants in the mansion privately told her that the place had good omen. Not only were the flowers and plants fresh, but even the third miss had become more and more lustrous by the day!</p>
<p>“Why don’t you join me?” Teacher Shan noticed Ye Zhen sneaking behind her back.</p>
<p>Only then did Ye Zhen came to Teacher Shan’s side. “Seeing that Teacher was meditating, this miss was afraid to disturb.”</p>
<p>Teacher Shan’s beautiful face flashed a disappointed smile. “The moonlight is good today. I’m just thinking of my old friend.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, if you don’t mind, who were you thinking of?” Ye Zhen asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>She was thinking of her apprentice whom she deeply cared for and the man who put her to shame until her last breath.</p>
<p>She was no longer in this world.</p>
<p>“I am thinking of my former student.” Teacher Shan’s face showed a look of sadness. “A woman who was astounding and brilliant, fell in love with someone she shouldn’t have, and died.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s throat tightened.</p>
<p>When she was determined to marry Mo Rongzhan, Teacher Shan had once persuaded her that the Emperor of the Qin Dynasty was unpredictable and had old grievances with the Ye Family. When she married him, she would certainly not have a harmonious relationship with her husband.</p>
<p>At that time, how had she answered her? She had said that the Prince Mo Rongzhan had an old grudge with her uncle, which had nothing to do with her or her household. Besides, she had saved him. As long as he knew who she was, he would not resent her.</p>
<p>She had been too naive!</p>
<p>The big mansion of the Ye Family represented the whole Ye Clan. She should have known that the great hatred between her uncle and the prince couldn’t be changed by marriage. At that time, her uncle almost broke off his relationship with her father just to protect the family.</p>
<p>Yet, they had all died in the end.</p>
<p>“Do you mean… Ye Zhen?” She couldn’t help but ask quietly, concealing the strain in her voice as much as she could.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan gave her a light look. “Do you know her?”</p>
<p>“I have heard others say that you were proudest of her,” Ye Zhen said softly, “They said the Ye Family did evil things… so…”</p>
<p>“Ye Yiqing was such a gentle person, a man who wouldn’t even hurt a fly! What did the other family member have to do with his brother’s crimes? It was Ye Yisong who had committed several evil deeds against the crown! Why did others have to die with him?” Teacher Shan’s voice was somewhat angry.</p>
<p>Ye Yisong was Ye Zhen’s uncle and the most powerful and treacherous court official in the previous emperor’s reign. The former emperor was incompetent and had a great relationship with him.</p>
<p>If Ye Zhen would be asked if she felt mournful over her uncle’s death, she would definitely say no!</p>
<p>She knew that the Ye Family, which used to be under the authority of her uncle, had been able to bully others. Her father and herself had persuaded him, but his uncle never took it at heart.</p>
<p>However, Mo Rongzhan wanted to kill Ye Yisong. But Ye Zhen couldn’t understand why he also killed her father and her eldest brother! They were innocents!</p>
<p>Her father had helped Mo Rongzhan, was sparing his life a tad too heavy for an act of gratefulness?</p>
<p>“Teacher, even if you feel anger about the late wang fei’s miserable end, there’s nothing you can do now.” Ye Zhen smiled wryly and said in a low voice. “This miss begs you to not mention any of this outside, especially to my family. You might get yourself in trouble.”</p>
<p>No matter how she looked at it, Teacher Shan had been a good friend to her. For this, she became frightful for her safety.</p>
<p>She knew what Lu Lingzhi could do if he ever found out that the teacher knew more about her.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan, perceiving her last statement as a threat, looked at her coldly.</p>
<p>“The Ye Family might not get its retribution but your Lu Family will suffer fate that is just as bitter in the future.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Teacher Shan in surprise and saw the hatred in her eyes for the first time.</p>
