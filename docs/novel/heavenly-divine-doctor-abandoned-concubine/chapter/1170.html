            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 157 – Did You Call Me A Scoundrel? (1)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Mo Rongyi with imminent surprise. She didn’t expect the little prince to stand up for her like this.</p>
<p>Princess Royal thought Mo Rongyi was just like his mother: timid and cowardly. To her, the two had never existed, at least not until now. Never did she expect that she’d be in this position, Mo Rongyi giving her a question she couldn’t answer.</p>
<p>And for the first time, in an argument, she was the one who fell silent.</p>
<p>In one stride, Mo Rongzhan reached his little brother. He looked down, the difference in height significant, and asked Mo Rongyi, “Aren’t you still ill? Why are you outside?”</p>
<p>“Brother, I better head back.” When Mo Rongyi saw his brother before him, his ire immediately subsided.</p>
<p>“Did you take the medicine prescribed by the imperial physician? You still look unwell.” Mo Rongzhan spoke in an unhappy tone.</p>
<p>Recognizing his brother’s disappointment, he said, “Yes, Brother, I have taken my medicine obediently.” He nodded his head vigorously.</p>
<p>“Go back to the prince’s palace.” Mo Rongzhan gave him a look and asked the eunuch next to him to accompany Mo Rongyi back. Then he looked back at Princess Royal and said, “Princess Royal, Yi is still young and doesn’t understand everything, so don’t dispute with him.”</p>
<p>Princess Royal still had a high-status today, not only because of her dominion but also because of her understanding of current affairs and political vision. Two years ago, she felt that even if Prince Qiu Liu successfully ascended the throne, he would not be able to sit for long. Therefore, she secretly helped Mo Rongzhan in his usurpation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, she would have had become like other clans today, under house arrest in their own mansions.</p>
<p>“What the emperor said is true; the little prince is no more than a child. However, Lu Yaoyao did disrespect me just now. The girl simply doesn’t know the right etiquette. Your Majesty, let our palace teach her a lesson.”</p>
<p>“Princess Royal, the empress dowager likes this girl very much. If you want to deal with her, you should ask the empress dowager first…” Mo Rongzhan’s dark eyes glistened. “I saw just now that Lu Yaoyao never collided with Liu Hua, and what she said to Princess Royal was not rude either.”</p>
<p>Seeing that she had already lost the fight, Princess Royal grimly said, “In that case… then I won’t dispute with a little girl any longer. Liu Hua, Empress Dowager is still waiting for us. Hurry!”</p>
<p>Liu Hua couldn’t believe what just happened. <i>Why did he help Lu Yaoyao speak? Does he not know that Lu Yaoyao humiliated her?</i></p>
<p>She pursed her lips and marched towards Mo Rongzhan. “Cousin Emperor, how could you help her? Is it because she is Lu Wushuang’s sister that you speak for her?”</p>
<p>He gave Liu Hua an indifferent look. “Princess Liu Hua, why would I not?”</p>
<p>“Cousin Emperor…” Liu Hua whispered to him, hoping to garner some pity from him.</p>
<p>But before she knew it, her mother came forward, grabbed her hand before reluctantly smiling. “Your Majesty, we must leave first.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded, dismissing them.</p>
<p>Princess Royal took away the reluctant and very disappointed Liu Hua. The maid who knocked Ye Zhen away was still kneeling on the ground, her legs trembling. Seeing that the emperor had no intention to punish her, she hurried away in the direction Princess Royal and Liu Hua went.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at them with cold eyes. This was the difference between someone of her status and people like Princess Royal. Even if she was bullied, Ye Zhen could only assume that nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“Unsatisfied?” Mo Rongzhan’s low voice interrupted her thoughts. Noticing her unmistakable fury, he asked.</p>
<p>She gasped, she had almost forgotten that Mo Rongzhan was still beside her!</p>
<p>“This official’s daughter is grateful to His Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Why did you go to the prince’s place?” Mo Rongzhan asked flatly, looking at her face with sunken eyes.</p>
<p>“The little prince refused to take medicine, so the empress dowager asked this miss to persuade him.” Ye Zhen still kept her head down, not sparing the emperor a look.</p>
<p>Including the two years when she became a soul trapped in the palace, she loved him for eight years, hated him for two years, and for ten years in summation, they never said a word to each other, except when they first met in the woods.</p>
<p>Every time she saw him, the hatred in her heart devoured her.</p>
<p>But Ye Zhen did not want to hate him. She hoped that in the sight of him, she would feel nothing.</p>
<p>Only in this way could she truly be freed. Freed from him and all the sorrows he caused her.</p>
<p>His face always reminded her of her past–her whole-hearted infatuation and love for him which was all unacknowledged. Involuntarily, looking back at her previous life, she felt pitiful and ridiculous at herself.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who was determined to fight against the entire Ye Family because of her love, Ye Zhen, who sadly hid in the quilt and wept quietly because of missing him, Ye Zhen, who hoped for his safe return from the war.</p>
<p>But in the end, for him, she was no one.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan only knew that Ye Zhen went to Mo Rongyi, but he did not know that his mother had personally asked her to go. “Did you ask the little prince to make Liu Hua give back his silvers?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyebrows naturally crossed, she looked defensive. “Replying to the emperor, this official’s daughter only offered a suggestion to the little prince.”</p>
<p>To her utter surprise, Mo Rongzhan snorted softly, which was entirely out of his character. “You’re making him incur hatred towards Princess Royal.”</p>
<p>“This official’s daughter thinks that Princess Royal doesn’t care about the silvers.” Ye Zhen replied, thinking that Princess Royal was too petty to even intervene.</p>
<p>“What did you see when you visited the little prince?” Mo Rongzhan asked again.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen couldn’t help but wonder in her heart; <i>how could everything she did and said to Mo Rongyi have reached this man’s ears? Maybe he sent someone to spy on them?</i></p>
<p>“There is nothing in this palace that I do not know.” Mo Rongzhan could not see her expression but could guess her thoughts.</p>
<p>“This official’s daughter didn’t see anything.” Ye Zhen firmly denied.</p>
<p>“Really?” Mo Rongzhan looked at her lightly. “Since you can persuade him to take medicine and know what kind of disease he has, then you can probably treat the little prince.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen finally raised her head in dismay. <i>‘Are you crazy?’</i></p>
<p>She almost blurted out.</p>
