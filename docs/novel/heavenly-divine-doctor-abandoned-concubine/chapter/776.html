            <p><strong>Chapter 555 – Finding A Good Son-in-law for the Princess</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen, just dressed in her innerwear, was taking a nap on the soft couch in the inner room when she heard voices outside in a daze.</p>
<p>“Master Marquis, the princess is resting. If you have an urgent matter, you might as well wait for Her Highness to wake up, and the servants will go in and report back.”</p>
<p>Yu Ping’s voice sounded from outside.</p>
<p>“Is Yaoyao still sleeping?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s warm and sincere voice reached Ye Zhen’s ears.</p>
<p>She woke up immediately, lowered her eyes, and found that she only had light innerwear on. She frowned, and saw Aunt Rong coming in from outside, “Your Highness, are you awake?”</p>
<p>“Who’s outside?” Ye Zhen asked indifferently, her tone clearly a little unhappy.</p>
<p>Aunt Rong brought Ye Zhen clothes, and while helping her change, said, “It’s the Marquis, he heard that you are back and wants to see you, Yu Ping has stopped him twice.”</p>
<p><em>Why is Lu Lingzhi looking for me?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned before saying, “Yu Ping has done well.”</p>
<p>Even if Lu Lingzhi was a marquis and her elder brother, Ye Zhen was no longer a little girl but a maiden who would be soon married off. What did it mean for a grown man to insist on entering his sister’s boudoir when she was sleeping? Fortunately, the people around her were assigned by the empress dowager, so there was no need to worry about offending him.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, Aunt Chen* by Old Madam’s side was also here. There is a banquet in the upper hall tonight. It’s almost time,” Aunt Rong said.</p>
<p>[*Chen Wei]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the sky outside only to find that it was already sundown. “Have Yu Ping accompany me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness,” Aunt Rong said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Aunt Rong picked out a sage-colored, figure-hugging top with pipa sleeves and a gauzy pale yellow floral skirt for Ye Zhen. Her hair was done up in a simple bun in a cascading style, which emphasized her elegance and charm the more you looked at her.</p>
<p>“When was this dress made?” Ye Zhen looked at the person in the mirror, only to realize that she seemed to have grown taller, and even the little buns on her chest* had grown a bit.</p>
<p>(*her breast)</p>
<p>“This is something Third Madam made for you not long ago. I was afraid you wouldn’t be able to wear your old clothes after you returned,” Aunt Rong said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart surged with warmth. Pei Shi truly treated her as her own daughter*. What’s more, even her own mother had never ever treated her like that.</p>
<p>[*literal translation was: as if she were Ye Zhen’s own mother.]</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s voice was no longer heard outside, and she thought he had already left.</p>
<p>When she was about to go to the upper hall, a little maid’s voice came from outside, “Third Young Miss, the imperial decree is here, Old Madam asks you to hurry up and receive it.”</p>
<p><em>Imperial decree?</em> Ye Zhen was shocked… <em>An imperial decree this soon?</em> Her heart leapt to her throat, she was afraid Mo Rongzhan had decreed her marriage.</p>
<p>If it were really a marriage, she would definitely slap the imperial decree on his face!</p>
<p>By the time Ye Zhen rushed to the main hall, the entire Lu family was already waiting there for the decree to be announced. Lu Lingzhi was standing beside Old Madam Lu. When he saw Ye Zhen enter the hall, his eyes turned even darker. Although his face was as serene as the surface of a lake, the clenched fists inside his sleeves betrayed his actual emotions.</p>
<p>He was also worried that this was the decree for marriage.</p>
<p><em>Is the emperor this impatient? He will not even give me time to make a move… Will I have to just watch as Yaoyao marries someone else?</em></p>
<p>It was Eunuch Fu who came to announce the decree. Seeing Ye Zhen appear, he hurriedly stepped forward and bowed. “This servant greets Her Imperial Highness.”</p>
<p>“Eunuch Fu, please rise.” Ye Zhen forced a smile and continued, “Why is there still an imperial edict at this time?”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu smiled and said, “This is the emperor’s intention. Since the princess has arrived, I will begin to announce the decree.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi flicked his sleeves and knelt down, “Long live my emperor—”</p>
<p>The hall full of people followed suit, however, each of their moods was different. Even so, it was only Lu Lingzhi, Lu Shiming, and Ye Zhen who hope that this was not a decree of marriage.</p>
<p>“I come bearing the edict of His Imperial Majesty…” Eunuch Fu began proclaiming the imperial decree in a loud voice. It consisted of many praises for Ye Zhen’s incomparable wisdom and intelligence as well as her kindness and elegance. It accredited her for handling the Huaijiang Plague and Zhao Jia Island situation and pronounced the list of rewards that were bestowed upon her before reaching the concluding part…</p>
<p>“My Imperial Sister, who has now come of age, is of outstanding beauty. Zhen instructs the  Ministry of Rites to seek a suitable husband for her…”</p>
<p><em>What’s the meaning of this?</em> Ye Zhen was dumbfounded. <em>Mo Rongzhan asked the Ministry of Rites to find a good husband for me? Will he actually marry me to someone else?</em></p>
<p>“Your Imperial Highness, please accept the decree.” Eunuch Fu smiled and handed the decree to Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi and Lu Shiming looked at each other in puzzlement. They failed to understand what the emperor meant by issuing such an edict. Didn’t he want to make Yaoyao the empress*? And yet he had, immediately upon his return, decreed to marry her off to someone else?</p>
<p>[* We have taken creative liberties here. It literally translates to: Hadn’t they heard that the Emperor had wanted to make Yaoyao the Empress?… It’s more like an intel, a conjecture cos MRZ hasn’t told these two or anyone except his mother that he wants to make YZ the empress.]</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu and Pei Shi didn’t look very good either. They both thought that Yaoyao would enter the palace in the future. With such an imperial decree, they didn’t know if it would be good or bad for the Lu family.</p>
<p>“This subject hears and obeys.” Ye Zhen received the imperial edict expressionlessly. No matter what Mo Rongzhan was trying to do, she was resolved not to care. If he really was willing to marry her off to someone else, that was just as well, it was exactly what she was aiming for.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen deliberately ignored the inexplicable grievance and discomfort in her heart, smiled, and said to Old Madam Lu, “Grandmother, the emperor has given me so many rewards, I’m afraid that the store in my yard will not be able to fit them all.”</p>
<p>Madam Lu regained her senses thinking that even if Yaoyao couldn’t become the empress, ultimately she was still a princess of high standing, and her marriage prospects were still good. “Have someone open a warehouse for you, and store everything you receive in the palace there.”</p>
<p>“Eunuch Fu, how about some wine?” Lu Lingzhi had asked his retainer to give the emperor’s confidante a thick purse, the wide smile on his face* a testimony to the joy in his heart.</p>
<p>(*Lu Lingzhi’s)</p>
<p>As long as the emperor wasn’t thinking of making Yaoyao Empress, he had a much better chance; at least he would not be making an enemy of the emperor.</p>
<p>Today, he had been to the palace along with the emperor. Although his attitude towards him seemed the same as before, he was not sure if it was an illusion. He felt that the emperor was looking at him differently as if he was scrutinizing him.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi sighed in his heart. After Lu Wushuang’s matter was exposed, it was normal for the emperor to harbor suspicions in his heart. Now, he only hoped that by handing over Ye Yaoyao, the emperor would be convinced that he had nothing to do with Shuang’er’s matter.</p>
<p>He had done enough for the Lu family, from now on, he would live for himself. As he looked at the little girl who was jesting and coquettish beside the old lady, his heart raced.</p>
<p>Having announced the decree, Euncuh Fu immediately left the Lu Mansion, after all, he still had to return to his master and resume his orders.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>“What was the princess’ reaction after she got the imperial decree?” Mo Rongzhan sat behind the desk and looked at Eunuch Fu who was kneeling in front of him.</p>
<p>“Replying to the emperor, Her Imperial Highness seemed to be stunned when she heard the servant’s decree, but… she seemed to be in a good mood after.” Eunuch Fu simply reported the truth and did not dare to look up at Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p><em>Good mood?</em> Mo Rongzhan raised his brows, <em>so she wouldn’t mind my marrying her to someone else?</em></p>
<p>Heartless little girl! Even though he had expensed great efforts to marry her into the palace, she didn’t even care! Mo Rongzhan was so angry that he wanted to immediately go* settle accounts with her. However, as he glanced at the mountain of memorials piled up before him, he harrumphed.</p>
<p><em>Hmph, let her be happy for a few days. When I have settled the affairs, I will immediately issue a decree to marry her!</em></p>
<p>(*out of the palace)</p>
