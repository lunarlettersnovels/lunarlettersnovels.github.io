            <p><strong>Chapter 425 – Nobody Owes Each Other Anything (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, your eldest brother was very worried about you. Go see him later,” Pei Shi said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was a thousand times unwilling, but she also really wanted to know if Lu Lingzhi had been cured by Huangfu Chen now. “Okay, I want to see him too.”</p>
<p>“Ai, what is with the luck of our Lu family recently? Why is it so bad?” Old madam Lu sighed mournfully.</p>
<p>First, Lu Lingzhi was conspired against and poisoned on the way back. Then Lu Wushuang was dismissed as Gui Fei, and now Yaoyao almost died. These things made people shudder at the thought.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, how is Eldest Sister doing now?” Ye Zhen asked, feigning concern over Lu Wushuang’s situation. She should be very unwilling to stay in the Nian Tzu temple. Originally, she should be enjoying a life of splendor and luxury, accompanied by her beloved. But now, she has to live in a temple with nothing but a candle by her side, surrounded by the deep, dark night. Who could be reconciled with such a fate let alone a gui fei?!</p>
<p>Old madam Lu said, “The empress dowager let me see your eldest sister once. Now she is not as willful as before. She cut her hair obediently and didn’t cry or fuss. She just wants your big brother to visit her a few days later…”</p>
<p><em>This is not Lu Wushuang’s usual temperament!</em> Ye Zhen immediately became vigilant. According to her temperament in the past, she should be wailing and crying for the Lu family to help her leave the Nian Tzu Temple.<em> It could not be this peaceful!</em></p>
<p><em>If something is abnormal, then it certainly means she is possessed by a demon! What does Lu Wushuang want to do? Why does she want to see Lu Lingzhi?</em></p>
<p>Pei Shi didn’t care very much about Lu Wushuang because the latter had wanted to frame her daughter. It didn’t matter to her whether that girl was living in a prosperous manor with wealth or abandoned.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, let me go and see Eldest Brother first,” Ye Zhen said. Right now, she hated Lu Lingzhi more than ever before, but she also knew that it was definitely harder to deal with him than dealing with his sister.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu nodded with a smile. “Go.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi stood up and said to Ye Zhen, “I’m going with you. It’s just about time for Lingzhi to drink his medicine.”</p>
<p>“You go.” Old Madam Lu said wearily, “Tomorrow I will go to Huguo Temple to pray for blessings. The Lu family should have a different fortune.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming next to her smiled. “Mother, these are all illusory—”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu glared at him. “How will you know if you haven’t asked for a blessing?”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I will accompany you,” Ye Zhen said with a smile. She had no animosity towards this old matriarch and was willing to obey her instead of her sister. The only people she wanted revenge on were Lu Wushuang and Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Ye Zhen and Pei Shi walked to the front yard together. Lu Shiming was held back by the old lady to receive further instruction as she told him about all the things she had asked for at the Huguo Temple.</p>
<p>“Mother, has Eldest Brother’s poison been cured?” Ye Zhen held Pei Shi’s hand. Being frightened at the hunting ground and getting tired in the palace, it seemed that she could feel what she had never felt before by relying on the warmth of Pei Shi’s hand.</p>
<p>She had never been close to her own mother. Sometimes her mother would cry silently when she looked at her. And whenever she was ill, no matter what happened, her mother never cared. The people who were actually there for her while growing up had always been her father and grandmother.</p>
<p><em>How does it feel to be in the arms of a mother?</em> Ye Zhen hadn’t felt it before, but now relying on Pei Shi, she knew that this was the warmth of a mother.</p>
<p>Pei Shi held the little girl’s hand and thought to herself that a daughter was indeed like a caring little cotton-padded jacket. Although Ye Zhen was not her biological child, she had been raised by her little by little and was no less than her own daughter. <em>Fortunately, she came back safe and sound.</em> An emotional Pei Shi thought.</p>
<p>“Your Eldest Brother’s remnant poison has not yet been cleared out of his body, but today Mr. Chen said that if we can find the fire lotus again, we can completely heal your elder brother. It is a pity though, that the emperor is not in court yet. Otherwise, we could go into the palace and ask him for another fire lotus flower. ”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was shocked in her heart but hid it. <em>Yes, Imperial Physician Qi hadn’t been able to use the fire lotus flower properly but Huangfu Chen would never be mistaken. If they could still find another fire lotus flower, perhaps Mr. Chen could really cure Lu Lingzhi.</em></p>
<p>“Fire lotus flower is not easy to get. Even the imperial palace doesn’t have it now,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>Pei Shi sighed. “I hope we can find it elsewhere then.” She looked at Ye Zhen’s white and jade-like face. “What have you been doing in the palace these days? How did you encounter a tiger that day?”</p>
<p>“Someone wanted to harm us. We met an assassin on the road. When we fled to the woods, we saw a tiger. It came from a mountain. The fence had been broken. Fortunately, there were… Brother Tang and His Majesty…,” Ye Zhen whispered.</p>
<p>“His Majesty was injured because he saved you?” Pei Shi asked in a low voice.</p>
