            <p><strong>Chapter 477 –  Who’s That Man? (2)</strong></p>
<p>Huangfu Chen gently shook his head. “When I met him in the past, he only felt dizzy occasionally. I treated him for half a year. Although his condition improved, it was not cured. I didn’t expect to see him again in a few years. He can’t walk anymore.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him. Actually, she wanted to ask who Mu Qing, the one Zhao Tianji mentioned, was. However, when her master heard this name, he did not seem to be in a good mood.</p>
<p>“The owner of the iron mine and the villa may not only be Zhao Tianji. Be careful when you are by his side.” Huangfu Chen touched Ye Zhen’s head. He now regretted bringing her. If she had not left the capital, she would not have encountered such danger.</p>
<p>“Master, don’t worry about me, I will be careful,” Ye Zhen said softly.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at the man in black outside. “Go, Zhao Tianji isn’t a patient person. If there’s anything you don’t understand about his illness, come to me again.”</p>
<p>“He seems to be afraid of you,” Ye Zhen said. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have put Huangfu Chen under house arrest and only let her treat him.</p>
<p>“Because Zhao Tianji cannot kill me and since he’s afraid that I would leave, he could only house arrest me,” Huangfu Chen said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was startled. Just as she was about to ask Zhao Tianji why he didn’t dare to kill him, a young man came from outside. “Miss Lu, our master, invites you over.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked down at Ye Zhen. “Go on, be careful, yourself.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Master, you must also be careful,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice. She could guess what Zhao Tianji’s illness was. She had seen it in the Qi Family Medical Classics before. His illness was incurable. Even if she had <em>lingquan</em>, her chances were not very high. Her master didn’t notice the disease a few years ago because it wasn’t obvious at that time. However, she still had to see him(ZT) to know the details.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was brought back to the Peach Blossom Spring by that young man.</p>
<p>“You will live here in the future, next to Master’s main room,” the young man said indifferently.</p>
<p>She was assigned the side room* beside his. It seemed Zhao Tianji wasn’t treating her as a doctor but as a servant. “When will your master let me treat him?”</p>
<p>[*side rooms usually house the maids etc.]</p>
<p>“When Master sees you, you will naturally know.” The man didn’t even look at Ye Zhen. He didn’t seem to care about her peerless beauty.</p>
<p>“Alright, thank you,” she said with a smile. Since she was here, she would be at ease. At the very least, she was still valuable to Zhao Tianji. For now, she should not be in any danger.</p>
<p>Just like that, Ye Zhen lived in the Peach Blossom Spring, but she didn’t see Zhao Tianji. For three days in a row, other than going to Huangfu Chen every day to talk for an hour, she spent the rest of her time reading in the house. Apart from that young man, she didn’t even see a maid.</p>
<p>Since the situation was such, Huangfu Chen only told her not to worry. Zhao Tianji would come out sooner or later.</p>
<p>In these three days, Ye Zhen still knew very little about Zhao Tianji’s background. Even when she asked Huangfu Chen, he did not tell her much.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the young man, Liang Yin, took her to his master.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji’s complexion was worse than from a few days ago. He leaned against the bed, his gaze malicious as he looked at Ye Zhen who walked in.</p>
<p>Qiu Yuan stood at the side. Seeing Ye Zhen come in, he immediately said coldly, “If you can’t cure our master’s illness, you will die today without a burial ground.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her eyebrows and looked at him. In her eyes, Qiu Yuan was a relatively calm person, yet he was so impulsive today. It seemed Zhao Tianji’s illness had taken a turn for the worse. She smiled faintly and walked to the man(ZT), pulling his hand over.</p>
<p>“What do you want to do?” Qiu Yuan and Liang Yin looked at Ye Zhen vigilantly.</p>
<p>“Looks like you don’t have much strength in your hands today. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have thought of me.” Ye Zhen tilted her head, smiling as she looked at the cold-faced Zhao Tianji.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji looked at her frostily. “What do you want to say?”</p>
<p>“I think your illness… No one in the world can cure you.” She gently placed his hand back. “You have to be careful with your illness. Otherwise, you might not be able to move your entire body.”</p>
<p>“If I don’t get better, you will have to die.” Zhao Tianji cast her a malicious gaze.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. ”I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to cure you, however, you have to guarantee that we’ll leave safely and unharmed in a month’s time.”</p>
