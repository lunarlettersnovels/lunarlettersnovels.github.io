            <p><strong>Chapter 468 –  Empty Room (1)</strong></p>
<p>Aunt Cheng said, “Old Madam, this servant still has to go back to report the matter, so I will go back to the palace now.”</p>
<p>The matriarch was stunned for a long time before she came back to her senses. She stood up and asked Chen Ying to send Aunt Cheng out.</p>
<p><em>A better future…</em> She sat back down and savored Aunt Cheng’s words. <em>If she didn’t guess wrong, would that be what she thought? Just now, Aunt Cheng had called her Third Miss and did not even mention the word princess.</em></p>
<p><em>Was the emperor really interested in Yaoyao? Then what kind of concubine position did he want to give her?</em></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was a little shocked. She felt that if the emperor really liked Yaoyao, the imperial concubine position he gave to Yaoyao would not be lower than Shuang’er’s*.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps… perhaps it would be the empress…</em></p>
<p>[*Lu Wushuang was a Gui Fei and the highest for the imperial concubine, only below the empress.]</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she sat up straight and did not dare to continue thinking.</p>
<p>“Go, quickly invite Third Madam.over, Madam Lu shouted loudly.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, why are you so anxious to find Third Aunt?” Lu Lingzhi walked in from outside and said to Old Madam Lu with a smile.</p>
<p>When Old Madam Lu saw him, she finally found someone who she could discuss with. “Aunt Cheng just left, the marriage between Yaoyao and Marquis Jing Ning… I’m afraid it won’t work.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I know.” Lu Lingzhi smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>“How much do you know?” Old Madam Lu was shocked. <em>Does he know everything?</em></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi sighed and told her about Tang Zhen’s drunkenness yesterday, including the words of the empress, not the marquis’s wife.</p>
<p>“Never thought… I didn’t expect Yaoyao to have such good fortune.” Old Madam Lu’s heart skipped a beat. She had never dreamt that the Lu family would have an empress. She had thought that having an imperial concubine was already amazing, but she was banished.</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about this matter for now. It’s not certain yet. If we misunderstand, I’m afraid that the emperor will suddenly change his mind,” Lu Lingzhi whispered.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu nodded. “You’re right. There’s no telling if there’s anything that hasn’t been declared yet. Don’t tell anyone about this for now.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, if it is true… Only she can let Shuang’er return to the palace,” Lu Lingzhi whispered.</p>
<p>“This matter should be taken slowly. The sisters still have a knot in their hearts,” Old Madam Lu said.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi nodded gently and did not say that he had arranged to see Lu Wushuang. He could not meet her openly without the emperor’s order. Nian Tzu Temple was not a place that just anyone could enter, so he could only sneak in at night.</p>
<p>Therefore, he needed time.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was in the morning court. As he was perusing the memorial in the imperial study, he was itching to reenact the beautiful scene from last night. He longed to see that little person more than ever.</p>
<p><em>If she were to come to the imperial study now… the little girl would certainly not agree to it. I had better wait and have her help(me) apply the medicine. </em>Although the reason was not really justified, he was the emperor, so who would dare to say anything.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was done reading the memorials and the ministers had come to discuss how to execute Prince Shun and the others.</p>
<p>“Exempt them from the death penalty. They can’t escape from the consequences. Let’s imprison them,” Mo Rongzhan said indifferently.</p>
<p>“The emperor is merciful.” Several ministers got down to their knees and bowed. The emperor was right not to kill these princes. The people in the world would only think that the emperor was merciful and showed mercy to their brothers. They would not think that he was weak.</p>
<p>Unknowingly, most of the day passed by, Mo RongZhan had lunch and asked Eunuch Fu to go to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard to invite Lu Yaoyao over.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu suppressed his smile and agreed, but unfortunately, did not invite anyone over.</p>
<p>“Princess hasn’t entered the palace yet?” Mo Rongzhan raised an eyebrow. <em>Is she still angry? Last night, she was… She seemed to be crying a little too much. Would she feel uncomfortable?</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, do you want this slave to go to the Anyang Marquis’s Mansion?” Eunuch Fu asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan reckoned the little girl might not dare to come to see him; because of last night’s incident, she wouldn’t want to enter the palace. Suddenly, he was inexplicably in a somewhat cheery mood. “No need.”</p>
<p>He wanted to see her again tonight, so he had to coax her back.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu looked at the emperor and knew there would be another visit tonight.</p>
<p>Thinking about how he would still be able to get a kiss at night, Mo Rongzhan went about things with renewed motivation. When night descended, he left the palace with his retainer.</p>
<p>He entered Ye Zhen’s boudoir but found not a single person within.</p>
<p><em>Where is she?</em> Mo Rongzhan’s eyes darkened as he looked at the empty room. <em>Is she hiding somewhere?</em></p>
<p>Unable to find the little figure, his mood, which had been expectant the entire day, plummeted to the bottom. With a dark face, he came out of the Lu Mansion, shocking Eunuch Fu who was hiding in the corner.</p>
<p><em>Why did the emperor come out so soon?</em></p>
