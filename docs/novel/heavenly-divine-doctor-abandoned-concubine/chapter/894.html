            <p><strong>Chapter 435 – For a Period of One Year</strong></p>
<p>His fingers came to the heart of her legs and stopped there. “Yaoyao, if there’s no Ye family between us, would you stay with me?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes blurred with tears. If a lot of things had not happened, then wouldn’t she still love him wholeheartedly? “What if I’m not Lu Yaoyao but Ye Zhen? Would you still want me to stay with you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, no matter who you are, <em>zhen</em> is still determined to be with you and be a pair of mandarin ducks with you,” Mo Rongzhan said firmly and decisively.</p>
<p>“No, you won’t.” She shook her head. “You will treat me like you treated Ye Zhen~”</p>
<p>He lowered his head and blocked her lips with his own, the fingers that were placed on the heart of her legs moved and parted the soft petals, preparing it for his entry.</p>
<p>Her eyes teared up again in pain, and she desperately struggled trying to get away. However, he was as strong as iron, and she was unable to shake him off her.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, it turns out you are not indifferent to <em>zhen</em>,” he said, happily nibbling, sucking, and kissing her pink lips. In his joy, he unconsciously sped up his fingers .</p>
<p>The strange feelings almost caused her to lose her mind… Ye Zhen cried even more.</p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan…,” she sobbed out his name but could not voice out anything to ask him about.</p>
<p>She knew that the words he had just told her were not a lie. He really did let her father and elder brother go. Since this was the case, naturally the hatred between them could be resolved, but she… didn’t want to be one of the concubines in his harem. She still remembered the sad times of guarding the empty boudoir alone for two years… She truly did not want to live like that again.</p>
<p>“You are still unwilling.” His voice was slightly cold. He withdrew his fingers from inside her and aligned his rod closer to her core. As long as he pushed it in with some strength, she would completely belong to him.</p>
<p><em>But… What about her heart?</em></p>
<p>At this moment, Mo Rongzhan was finally clear about what he wanted. What he wanted most was her heart. However, he was unable to hold back his desire to plunder, and he did not want to find another woman at this time.</p>
<p>Thus, he took her hand and placed it on his ‘heat’, forcing her to feel it clearly. “Yaoyao, <em>zhen</em> said he would give you a year’s time. After that, whether you like it or not, <em>zhen</em> will make you his empress.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him in a daze. Moments later, she realized what she was holding onto, and her little face reddened in shame. She wanted to take her hand back, but he was still holding it tightly. Furthermore, he even moved it while it was still enclosed in his… Due to what he did, she did not even dare to look at it for a second time.</p>
<p><em>How shameful!</em></p>
<p><em>Her hands are so soft and small…</em> Mo Rongzhan thought, hardly able to restrain his high spirit from overflowing, feeling comfortable all over his body. He then kissed her jade-like skin softly, reluctant to let her go.</p>
<p>On Ye Zhen’s side, she only felt her hands were sore and uncomfortable. She felt that her hands were no longer hers…. she could not feel any strength, not even to lift her limbs.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, <em>zhen</em> still wants it,” he said into her ears, voice hoarse with hints of seductive allure</p>
<p>“——” She glared at him, ashamed and resentful.</p>
<p>He touched her thigh that was stained with his desire moments ago, and felt satisfied. Meanwhile, feeling the sweat and stickiness of her body, she dearly wished she could take a bath immediately.</p>
<p>However, seeing that the man was clamping her legs, looking like he was about to move again, she couldn’t say anything.</p>
<p>So… this kind of her and him… what kind of innocence could they speak of? Even if her body was still that of a pure maiden, but with this kind of man, could the reputation of her boudoir still be regarded as pure?</p>
<p>It was not until he had enjoyed himself one more time that Mo Rongzhan let her rest. By the end, her hands and legs were so weak that she had no more strength to do anything.</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> will have someone fetch some water to let you freshen up,” he murmured tenderly before he kissed her for a long time on her lips.</p>
<p>Alarmed, Ye Zhen cried angrily, “Don’t let anyone see me in this state!”</p>
<p>“Won’t let anyone see.” Mo Rongzhan uttered lightly, taking her to the bed and gathering all her clothes over. “These clothes can no longer be used. Let Eunuch Fu discreetly bring you a new set of clothes.”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu was right outside the chambers. Therefore, it was impossible for him to not know what was going on inside.</p>
<p>She knew this too, so her face simultaneously paled and reddened, feeling as if she no longer had any face to meet people at all.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao….” He found that he really liked the look of shame and anger on her face, thus he couldn’t help but kiss her on the cheek.</p>
<p>“You said you will give me time, so you can’t do such a thing to me again,” she said coldly as she looked at him.</p>
<p>He was somewhat hesitant. He thought it felt good.</p>
<p>“If you do this to me again, I’ll go to a place so far away that you will never see me again,” Ye Zhen stated resolutely, a hint of threat lacing her voice.</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen </em>promises you,” Mo Rongzhan said softly, in the end, resigning to her wish.</p>
