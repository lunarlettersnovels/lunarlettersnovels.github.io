            <p><strong>Chapter 455 – Persuasion</strong></p>
<p>Tang Zhen had never wanted to keep anything from Ye Zhen, so he told her about Lu Lingzhi coming over to look for him the other day. He told her that, initially, he had already retreated because he knew what the emperor had in mind for her, but then with her eldest brother’s persuasion, his confidence was renewed to continue his pursuit.</p>
<p>She listened to his explanation and nodded gently. “I understand, then I’ll go back first.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao….” He couldn’t help but call out to her. “Are you… unwilling?”</p>
<p>“Brother Tang… I wish to study medicine with my master in a few days. Wait for me to come back, at that time if you still want to marry me… you can mention this matter then,” she said. Anyway, right now, whether she agreed or not, Mo Rongzhan would not allow her to marry anyone. Besides, she also didn’t want to involve Tang Zhen when she was uncertain.</p>
<p>He nodded gently, the corner of his lips forming a smile involuntarily. At least she didn’t refuse him outright now, which proved that he still had a chance.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who intended to go back to the Lu Family and question Lu Lingzhi, was clueless that at this time Old Madam Lu was talking to Empress Dowager about her marriage.</p>
<p>“… Did you say Marquis Jing Ning and Yaoyao?” Hearing that Tang Zhen was planning to propose marriage to Yaoyao, Empress Dowager hastily put down the cup of tea in her hand, and asked, “Is this true?”</p>
<p>“Merely at the stage of probing the idea at the moment. Right now, it should be a case of young people looking at each other, but fearing that the elders do not approve. This old subject originally planned to come and ask you in two days, but there happened to be an opportunity today, so this old subject took it,” Old Madam said with a smile.</p>
<p>Empress Dowager said, “<em>Aijia</em> knows Tang Zhen, who has been following the emperor for several years now, is a very nice young man.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu smiled and said, “Yes, ah. He and my Lingzhi are also good friends. Thus, somewhat, we already know a little about him. What do you think of the match, Empress Dowager?”</p>
<p>“It’s good, ah. Still, tomorrow <em>aijia</em> will summon him to the palace and take a closer look. If he really knows how to cherish her, then <em>aijia</em> will grant them a marriage,” she said, covering her smile. She truly loved Yaoyao, thus she naturally wished that she would have a good marriage.</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager, there is one more thing—” Old Madam Lu glanced over in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Empress Dowager smiled, “Old Madam Lu, is there anything that you can’t say to <em>aijia</em>?”</p>
<p>“Although Yaoyao already has the identity of a princess, we… We all hope that she will marry down to Tang Zhen… We don’t wish for her to….” Old Madam Lu trailed off, afraid that saying it out loud would make Empress Dowager unhappy. Thus, she was unable to complete her words.</p>
<p>“<em>Aijia</em> understands what you mean. The emperor has put Tang Zhen in an important position, and to let him marry to the princess is indeed unsuitable. If he really knows how to cherish and love Yaoyao, <em>aijia</em> will definitely let Yaoyao marry down to him,” she said, smiling.</p>
<p>The old matriarch was very grateful. “Many thanks, Empress Dowager.”</p>
<p>The two talked about Tang Zhen’s family background, and the more they conversed, the more they felt he was suitable for Yaoyao. And the more they spoke of it, the happier they became. Still, out of certain consideration, they did not immediately set down the marriage.</p>
<p>However, the moment Old Madam Lu left the palace, Empress Dowager could not wait to find out more. So, she immediately ordered Aunt Cheng to inquire about Tang Zhen and his household. After all, she would certainly not agree to the marriage if there were any <em>tongfang</em> and concubines in his back courtyard.</p>
<p>Although Aunt Cheng knew what the emperor had in mind for Ye Zhen, she now did not think too much about it. After all, one was the emperor and the other a princess. Granted, even if she had such thoughts in the past, now she didn’t think it was possible between them. So, she simply followed Empress Dowager’s order and found out everything she could about Tang Zhen’s family, which took her only half a day.</p>
<p>“Let alone a concubine, there is not even a single <em>tongfang</em> in his backyard. Furthermore, his personal attendants are all young manservants. From this, this servant can be presumptuous and say that Marquis Jing Ning is a clean-living and honest man, Empress Dowager,” Aunt Cheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Empress Dowager became more and more satisfied when she heard the result of Aunt Cheng’s investigation. “You go and pass on <em>aijia’s </em>order. Have Marquis Jing Ning come and see <em>aijia</em> tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng complied with the order, smiling.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was in the outer courtyard’s study, reading a book when he suddenly heard a light sound of approaching footsteps. He looked up and went out to check, just in time to see Ye Zhen slowly making her way over.</p>
<p>For a moment, he fell into a trance, feeling the pain he had buried in the bottom of his heart spread little by little. Before him, it was as if there were two figures alternating with one another walking towards him. One was the beautiful Lu Yaoyao and the other was the equally beautiful Ye Zhen. In his mind, the two overlapped, seemingly having the same expression, and sometimes they even spoke with the same tone. He could hardly tell who was who.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen came to a stop at a certain distance from Lu Lingzhi and looked at him coldly.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao?” he asked, somewhat uncertain of who was standing in front of him.</p>
<p>“It seems that Eldest Brother’s poisoning is getting more and more severe. Can you not even tell who I am?” she asked with a cold smile.</p>
