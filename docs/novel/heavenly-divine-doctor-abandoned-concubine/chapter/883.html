            <p><strong>Chapter 446 – Undressing (1)</strong></p>
<p>Liu Shi said, “The old madam wants to separate Marquis Jing Ning and Jing’er. This is too wicked. You have to stop her at all costs. If the empress dowager grants marriage, who dares to refuse then ….”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous!” Lu Lingzhi snapped. “Mother, do you know what kind of misunderstanding you will give birth to with these words? Tang Zhen and Jing’er have never even spoken a word, what do you mean by breaking them up? And where did you hear that from?”</p>
<p>“I…,” Liu Shi wanted to explain.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi said impatiently, “Mother, can you not just make trouble for me? Tang Zhen told me he wanted to marry Yaoyao himself. It has nothing to do with other people. He doesn’t even know what Jing’er looks like. I don’t know where you got this notion of breaking up paths?”</p>
<p>Only then did Liu Shi realize that she was tricked by that little b*tch Lu Jing into believing  that she and Tang Zhen were really happy together. “But… Jing’er likes Tang Zhen—”</p>
<p>“So what?” Lu Lingzhi asked coldly. “Can I still force Tang Zhen to marry her? I don’t know what to say!”</p>
<p>Liu Shi’s face was dyed blue and white. “Well, let’s not talk about Jing’er, I want to ask you… How do you plan to help Shuang’er? I can’t let her spend her life in Nianci Temple.”</p>
<p>“I have my own measures on this matter, so you don’t have to worry about it.” Lu Lingzhi said indifferently, “Mother, I have other business, I’ll leave first.”</p>
<p>Liu Shi was furious. “How do you want to help Shuang’er, you have to explain it to me clearly.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi had walked to the door and stopped. He turned around and looked at Liu nonchalantly. “Mother, if you’re well, why don’t you go carry out your (filial) duties to Grandmother, don’t spend the whole day just letting your thoughts run wild.”</p>
<p>“I am letting my thoughts run wild?” A fuming Liu Shi could only stare at the retreating figure by the door, she slapped the table indignantly. “I really don’t know whose biological son this is!”</p>
<p>♚♚♚</p>
<p>Liu Shi lost face in front of Lu Lingzhi and her heart was filled with unbearable anger, so she called Lu Fang over, scolded her in front of a courtyard of servants then threw her out.</p>
<p>Lu Fang had been chastised for no reason, but she could not give vent to her grievances and resentment. She was set to marry next month and must not offend the eldest madam at this time.</p>
<p>“Second Eldest Sister.” Lu Jing was already waiting for Lu Fang in the room. Seeing her return, she immediately stepped up to look at her nervously. “Auntie was looking for you?”</p>
<p>“Don’t say a word.” Lu Fang’s face was a little ugly. “Eldest Brother said Marquis Jing Ning doesn’t even know what you look like, so how could he marry you? Don’t mention this matter anymore.”</p>
<p>Lu Jing’s face turned pale. “Eldest Brother really said that?”</p>
<p>“You don’t know, Eldest Brother has always been partial to Lu Yaoyao, how could he… Ai, just accept your fate.” Lu Fang sighed.</p>
<p>“Acknowledge your fate?” Lu Jing backed down a few steps. “But I’m not reconciled.”</p>
<p>“If not, what can you even do? How can you fight her now? She is a princess and has the favor of the old madam. If I were Tang Zhen, I would definitely marry her.” Lu Fang snorted.</p>
<p>Lu Jing lowered her head and said nothing, no one knew what she was thinking.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who was still in the palace, didn’t know that everyone in the Lu family was secretly calculating against her. However, she was still thinking about how to avoid Mo Rongzhan. She didn’t want to face him at all.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, Eunuch Fu from the Palace of Heavenly Purity is here,” Chen Jinru walked to Ye Zhen who was perusing a medical record and whispered to her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned, walked out of the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard, and saw the emperor’s most trusted confidant standing outside. “Eunuch Fu, what can I do for you?”</p>
<p>“Your Royal Highness, it’s time to change the emperor’s dressing.” He smiled and bowed.</p>
<p>“Eunuch Fu, the emperor’s injuries have been healed, just ask a court lady to apply the snow lotus ointment on him.”</p>
<p><em>She had already said it once in the morning, so why did he come to see her?</em></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu said with a bitter expression, “The emperor drove out the maids who gave him medicine. He didn’t have his medicine for a whole day. Princess, this slave looked at the emperor and saw that he seemed uncomfortable, so this slave came to you as a last resort.”</p>
<p>“Of course he would feel uncomfortable if he does not apply medicine.” Ye Zhen curled her mouth angrily. It must have been itchy and painful.</p>
<p>“Princess, at once, please go and apply medicine for the emperor.” He knelt and begged.</p>
<p>“I’ll go, I’ll go!” Ye Zhen said helplessly. She was still a doctor in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard, so she couldn’t really not go.</p>
<p><em>Mo Rongzhan must have done it deliberately!</em></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu almost shed tears out of gratitude. He, who had looked at the dark face of the emperor all day, said, “Princess, please.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had to follow him to the Palace of Heavenly Purity. Mo Rongzhan was still looking at the memorials in the main hall. Hearing that she was coming, he put them down and walked into the bedchamber with a calm face.</p>
<p>“This servant—”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan coldly roared when she was about to curtsy. “Don’t talk about slaves and maidservants in front of me!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s shoulders stiffened, and she didn’t say anything. She just frowned and looked at him.”Your Majesty, why don’t you get the medicine administered?”</p>
<p>“My imperial physician won’t come to give me medicine, who can <em>zhen</em> ask to give <em>zhen</em> medicine?” Mo Rongzhan said coldly. Today he had just lost his temper in court and demoted the ministers who deliberately spread rumors. When he returned to the Palace of Heavenly Purity, he thought he would be able to see her, but she turned out to be so good that she dared not come to see him.</p>
<p>“——” Ye Zhen didn’t know what to say. “It’s just applying the snow lotus ointment, and Eunuch Fu can do it for you.”</p>
