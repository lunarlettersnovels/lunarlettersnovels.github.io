            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 289 – Justice Unserved (2)</strong></p>
<p>Two days later, came the day the emperor sealed the decree. Results of the interrogation from the Ministry of Justice had been submitted. The two bandits had never seen Liu Hua at all, only a maid beside her. Finally, under the influence of Princess Royal, only the maid was executed while the mastermind, Liu Hua, remained unharmed. However, the empress dowager gave an order to reprimand her for her lax discipline and have her ponder over her mistakes behind closed doors in her residence. This provided some relief to Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>The entire capital was aware of this incident now. They all knew it had something to do with Liu Hua, but due to lack of evidence, nothing could be done. No sooner had they confessed, the two thugs had inexplicably died in their prison cell. There was no drama behind it all. It seemed the matter could have only ended this way.</p>
<p>“A maid died then it’s over?!” Pei Shi indignantly voiced her grievance. How she wished she could whip that abominable girl Liu Hua!</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu said in a deep voice, “To be able to kill the two bandits in the prisons of the Ministry of Justice proves that Princess Royal still has some ability.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen leaned over Old Madam Lu and smiled. “Yes, Grandmother, let’s not be anxious over that.”</p>
<p>Her hate for Mo Rongzhan only deepened. <em>He must have intended to protect Liu Hua! </em>For the sake of power, he felt that Princess Royal should not be overthrown yet, so he turned a blind eye.</p>
<p>However, the more Princess Royal exposed her strength, the warier Mo Rongzhan would be about her. She would only undermine his influence more quickly, and he would want to get rid of her sooner.</p>
<p>What’s the rush? Wait ‘til Princess Royal reaps what she had sown.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu chuckled and shook her head. “How sensible my Yaoyao is!”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">♚</p>
<p>As time buried the matter, the new year arrived.</p>
<p>The Centennial Festival was the grandest ceremony of all, filled with merriment and joyful festivities. The past few days saw the members of the Lu Family busying themselves to the limit. They had picked auspicious days to spring clean the house. They polished the floors, painted the walls, and spared not a nook and cranny of the entire mansion.</p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve, which was also the seal reopening ceremony in the imperial court, Lu Shiming returned.</p>
<p>He and Lu Shixun, together with some of the boys in the family, hung portraits of the ancestors of the Lu Family in each hall, and pasted Red Spring Festival couplets on the front door. Pei Shi also took servants to paint red the edge of the beds and water jar in each room, a symbol of good luck.</p>
<p>Looking at this lively scene around her, deep inside, Ye Zhen was incomparably sad. Memories from the Ye Mansion inundated her … How her father took her and her brother to paste couplets and the Fu symbol. They would stay up all night to welcome the new year together. The next day, upon waking up, they would find a small fish made of gold next to their pillows.</p>
<p><em>If Father were still here … If the Ye Family had not been executed,</em> <em>she would have still been able to live such a scene.</em></p>
<p>“Yaoyao … Yaoyao?” Pei Shi saw her daughter holding a Fu character in a daze and came over to call her a few times.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen came back to her senses and looked at Pei Shi smilingly. “Mother, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Go and paste the Fu symbol. Why are you in a daze here?” Pei Shi said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Ye Zhen pulled out a little smile in an attempt to mask her sadness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">♚</p>
<p>In the evening, the entire family had a happy reunion dinner. Even Madam Lu joined. In the midst of the drinkers’ wager game, there was a shout outside.</p>
<p>“Old Madam, glad tidings from the west … The marquis won the battle again.”</p>
<p>“At last! Victory!” Lu Shiming happily exclaimed.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu hurriedly said, “Let the person come in and report.”</p>
<p>The soldier was invited in. It was Lu Lingzhi’s subordinate who had just come out of the palace. With the permission of the emperor, he came to the Lu Family to report the good news.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lowered her head and drank a mouthful of wine. <em>How could Lu Lingzhi win again? Impossible! </em>She clearly remembered that he had sustained injuries when he returned.</p>
<p>“The marquis has captured the prince in the west. Now only the remnants of the rebel party are fighting against the court. As soon as they are nabbed, the marquis will withdraw the troops and return to the imperial court,” said the proud subordinate.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was very glad. “Well, well! As long as the marquis is safe and sound.”</p>
<p>While the entire family was rejoicing over the news, Ye Zhen was even reluctant to smile, under the pretext of being drunk, she refrained from saying anything at all.</p>
