            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 242 – The Teacher Is Dismissed</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: Teacher Shan (mentioned as Mister Shan in the previous chapters, translated by the previous translator Moon-er) is a female, I just recently found out. She is a widow, and a dear friend of our Ye Zhen.</strong></em></p>
<p>Things have an uncanny way of working out, or not working out. No one had imagined today would be filled with such events. The twists and turns, the winner and loser, had one wagered one would have sure lost. After all, today was utterly unpredictable.</p>
<p>To those who were still reeling in the aftermath of Class B’s archery class incident, and claiming Lu Yaoyao would be the one facing the guillotine, Huang Fuxiang’s expulsion from the academy came as a shock.</p>
<p>The young miss of a notable family, with an exemplary aunt, had been shown the exit. As if this was not enough, suddenly Assistant Teacher Su Xinmei would no longer teach. However, she was still allowed to stay in the academy, it was unclear though for what means.</p>
<p>Truth was, Ye Zhen wasn’t exactly a pillar of innocence in this whole sequence of events. She had long wanted to settle scores with Huang Fuxiang, in that, she was waiting for the opportune moment. So, when the ‘dog’ came sniffing over, at its master’s behest, the ‘kind’ Ye Zhen had thrown it a bone.</p>
<p>When Lu Qiongqiu had sought her holding a heart full of remorse and an olive branch, she had instantly forgiven going so far as revealing the key in her possession as an act of good faith.</p>
<p>If she hadn’t disclosed this ‘key’ information, Huang Fuxiang would not have thought of destroying the medicinal herbs to frame her. Thus, first thing in the morning she had returned the key to Master Qin and patiently waited for the other party to make her move.</p>
<p>Yes, she had lured Huang Fuxiang and knew her revenge would involve the glasshouse somehow. No, she didn’t know the other would take things to such an extreme.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang was an infamous tyrant. She took pride in crushing the weak and showing off her might. With her gone, at once, the entire Class B descended into harmony. Gone was the hostility, people started to breathe free and easy. Those who did not dare to communicate with Ye Zhen before now took the initiative to talk to her.</p>
<p>However, Lu Qiongqiu, the one who led Ye Zhen to the frame up in the glasshouse before, and was instrumental this time even, was completely isolated.</p>
<p>Although the incident in the glasshouse was deliberately concealed, Huang Fuxiang’s dismissal from the academy and Su Xinmei’s sudden discharge from duty as a teacher… those that could read between the lines, sniffed out the connection between the two abrupt occurrences. After all, everyone was privy to the relationship the said people shared. There’s no denying that people had already guessed the truth.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not care much about the subtle changes in others. She believed people were fickle creatures and this was a passing phase. Although it was refreshing to not have to constantly keep looking over her shoulder, she was not just about to make the best of friends here at the academy.</p>
<p>The ones who had befriended her at the start, she reckoned, were worthy people. As such, those others didn’t enter her mind. Besides, right now, all her waking thoughts were invested in saving the medicinal herbs in the glasshouse or rather what was left of them.</p>
<p>From the moment the incident at the glasshouse had come to light, she was agitated beyond limit. She had contained and concealed her emotions well, but inwardly she was in turmoil.</p>
<p>Somewhere, all this came to be because of her. She was the cause that effected the ruination of the glasshouse. The anger and resentment that had to be directed at her, was borne by the life saving, priceless herbs.</p>
<p>She had as soon taken it upon herself to help salvage. As such, apart from the severely damaged fire lotus, the<em> lingquan </em>had rescued the remaining herbs. By now, about two-thirds of the herbs had already revived, which lessened her guilt somewhat.</p>
<p>Gradually, the days turned tranquil as no one came to Ye Zhen looking for trouble. She was able to concentrate on studying medicine. Although she still didn’t like to keep close contact with others, she gradually adapted to life in the academy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>A month later, Teacher Shan suddenly called her home. Like always, the tea-table had been set and the teacher was awaiting her arrival.</p>
<p>Every time she saw her teacher, Ye Zhen felt a kind of solace and warmth within. She was happy that after her transmigration, she had found her teacher and friend… the comforting constant from her previous life.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao,” kneeling before the tea-table over a kettle of boiling water, Teacher Shan softly said, “I can no longer continue teaching in the academy.”</p>
<p>Holding a cup of fragrant tea in hand, Ye Zhen was basking in epicurean delight. She would somehow leave her worrying and nagging thoughts behind, every time she entered the doors of her teacher. And today was no different. However, her peace was shattered by the very one who brought her sanity.</p>
<p>She raised her head in astonishment. “Teacher… why…?”</p>
