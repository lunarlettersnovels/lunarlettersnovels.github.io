            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 260 – Shameless Rascal (2)</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had spent his entire night thinking this through. It would be better to say, re-examining himself. He was a chronic mysophobic. He detested the touch of men, to say nothing of women. He would never speak to the fairer sex on his own accord, in all these years, none had entered his sights. He had never been attracted to anyone except for that little girl in the woods. He alone knew the desperation and yearning he held for her. How he had looked for her in vain. When he thought he had found her at last, he was even more disappointed.</p>
<p>As he stood on the fence reassessing Lu Wushuang’s authenticity, fate had conjured this girl out of thin air. At first, he was not interested, even going as far as disdaining her. But then, slowly things changed; he could not point out where exactly they had turned, but he had grown intrigued by her and was now at the point where he was admittedly smitten by her.</p>
<p>After all these years of looking for his ‘Little Yaoyao’, he was presented with a Yaoyao, so what if she was not the same? He had spent enough years in anguish over her, so why not embrace this namesake instead? After all, she was the only one after that little girl he had been attracted to. He couldn’t ignore the fact now, could he?</p>
<p>And thus he had decided- <em>If I cannot find my Yaoyao, it would be good to get another.</em></p>
<p>“Definitely not!” Ye Zhen didn’t wait a moment to deliver her cold and caustic reply, outrightly rejecting him. She knew she was playing with fire, but she was prepared to burn if it came to it.</p>
<p>Despite her harsh refusal, Mo Rongzhan spoke with a smile, seemingly provoking her on purpose. “What if Zhen decrees?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was stunned with disbelief, it was only now that she realized his seriousness. A hellish fire roared in her heart, she wanted to tear this man down right here and now.</p>
<p><em>Is he insane?! Why does he suddenly want me to enter the palace?</em></p>
<p>Fuming with rage, Ye Zhen finally lost control and blurted out: “You’re such a rascal!”</p>
<p>“Oh, how could Zhen be called a rascal?” Instead of taking offense, Mo Rongzhan looked at her with mirth.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips tightly, agitated at the sight of his smile. The man had dealt her a double-edged sword. She was a primp and proper noble Ye Zhen, how could she casually say what might have happened last night? This fellow had no sense of propriety, it didn’t mean she had to stoop to his level! However, on the other hand, if she wouldn’t say anything, it would mean she didn’t mind it at all, taking it as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>It was rare for her to not instantly retort. The man precisely took advantage of this moment and pressed on. “It seems that you know all too well what happened last night. In this case, you are not guaranteed to be innocent. Besides entering the palace, who else would marry you?” asked Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“I would rather spend my years and die alone than enter your palace.” Ye Zhen leveled him a frigid stare.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan suddenly pinched her chin. “Why?” Not waiting for her reply, he said coldly, “If you dare to mention any more old cucumbers, Zhen will let you experience it for yourself.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen tried to push his hand away, but no matter how much strength she used his grasp was intact. Instead, he forced her on the pillar behind her, his robust body dangerously close, she could feel the scorching heat from him.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, are you forcing this official’s daughter?” Ye Zhen asked frostily.</p>
<p>“If you become my woman … Don’t you want to enter the palace?” His horse voice evinced his feelings within. He dipped his head and gently nipped her thin, pink lip.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pushed him hard and said, “I don’t want to be like Lu Wushuang.”</p>
<p>“As long as you behave, I will not treat you like that,” Mo Rongzhan said.</p>
<p>This man had reached her bottom line, enough was enough. She was not an object that he would use as he pleased. One lifetime was enough for that, not anymore. And thus, she delivered the fatal blow.</p>
<p>“Even if I look like Wang Fei Ye, will you still favor and not be indifferent to me?” Ye Zhen demanded, her unflinching gaze trained pointedly at him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s hand that was about to slide through the lapel of her jacket, stilled. He raised his head and narrowed his eyes to look at her. “What did you say?”</p>
