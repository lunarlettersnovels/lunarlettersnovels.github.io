<p>Mo Rongzhan now knew that Lu Wushuang was not the one who saved him. He just wanted to know how she got the jade pendant he gave to the little girl who saved him.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8">
<div class="orp-player-wrapper orp-aspectRateFixed orp-player-ipm orp-player-ipm-hidden" data-hidden="false">
<div class="orp-light-player-wrapper">
<div class="orp-player-iframe">
<div class="orp-light-player-wrapper orp-isInit orp-notMobile orp-init-loading"></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The last thing he dared not guess was whether the little girl he had missed for years was no longer alive, which was why the jade pendant fell into the impostor’s hands.</p>
<p>“I see. No wonder she forgot the secret code she shared with me,” Mo Rongzhan faintly said.</p>
<p>He was undoubtedly angry that Lu Wushuang had fooled him all this time.  However, he could not ignore the favors the Lu Family had done him over the years. Besides, Lu Lingzhi was still needed in his cabinet.</p>
<p>He has just ascended the throne and the foundation of his hold was still unstable. At this juncture, he could not get rid of Lu Wushuang and relieve Lu Lingzhi of his services, lest the Lu Family get in his way, his reign crumbling into a heap.</p>
<p>Trepidation made Lu Ligzhi’s back run cold… He thought there must be a reason why the emperor has said these things. <i>But what is it? Did the emperor see a clue?</i></p>
<p>It seemed necessary to enter the palace and talk to his sister right away.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan pressed down the displeasure in his heart and by the time he faced Lu Lingzhi again, he was already bearing a small smile. “There are still many things I need you to do so you should get well and rest.”</p>
<p>“I cannot sit still at home. Although I still walk like a slug, I can just go back to the Ministry of War to work.”</p>
<p>The emperor nodded. “All right.”</p>
<p>“Brother!” Mo Rongyi, who had come out of the academy, shouted from far away and galloped closer to the emperor.</p>
<p>“Come down!” Mo Rongzhan’s face sank, and he ordered Mo Rongyi with a cold voice.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi stopped his horse hastily and came to Mo Rongzhan with a smiling face. “Brother, why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Are you not supposed to hunt? How did you get inside the academy?” Mo Rongzhan asked calmly.</p>
<p>He had left his duties at the palace upon learning that his little brother finally wanted to hunt. He came to have a look but was greeted with not even his shadow! The next moment, he found himself looking for him in the nearby Academy for Women which seemed to be holding a festive event.</p>
<p>Not mistaken, he surely found Mo Rongyi’s tiny form watching women play music.</p>
<p><i>Is my brother growing up too fast? </i></p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was most afraid of his brother’s straight face and was immediately scared to death. “I saw Miss Lu there, so I wanted to go and have a look at her performance! Brother, you don’t know that it was fortunate that I was there today, otherwise, she would not have been able to enter the academy!”</p>
<p>“Do you now feel entitled that you’re the reason why she got into the academy?” Mo Rongzhan asked with a slight sneer.</p>
<p>“Brother, that’s not the case! Lu Yaoyao’s drum dance today clearly had no problem, but Liu Hua bought off two teachers and insisted on giving her a B! Miss Lu is smart though. She wagered with Liu Hua that she would definitely enter the academy then she borrowed 2,000 taels from Marquis Tang. After arguing with the two teachers, one of them gave her an A in fear!” Mo Rongyi’s mouth was faster than the emperor’s fastest horse. Words after words, he spoke without pause.</p>
<p>In excitement, Mo Rongyi’s eyes lit up while he told him of the greatest news he had today. “I also won 12000 taels, Brother! Hmph! I will have one of my servants fetch my money from Liu Hua tomorrow!”</p>
<p>As his little brother blabbered his way out of his scoldings, Mo Rongzhan’s mind was filled with the appearance of the tender and delicate miss arguing. “If the princess goes to the palace to complain to her mother about this, I will not protect you.”</p>
<p>“Miss Lu took four A’s and Liu Hua definitely lost. I did nothing wrong!” Mo Rongyi was on the verge of crying.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi frowned, the two teachers were indeed cruel and unreasonable. They were not very proficient in Six Arts, so they made such ridiculous excuses just to forbid Lu Yaoyao from passing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she did not let them succeed.</p>
