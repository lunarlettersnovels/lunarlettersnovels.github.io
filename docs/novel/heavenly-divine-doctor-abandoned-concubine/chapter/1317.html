            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 10 – Family Dinner (1)</h3>
<p>When Lu Xiangzhi took his leave again to look for Lu Lingzhi, Old Madam Lu pulled Ye Zhen with her to meet the other members of the family.</p>
<p>Several misses of the Lu Family had yet to arrive, the hall was mostly occupied by the men – sons, and daughters who had clearly reached the marriageable age but had yet to wed.</p>
<p>Lu Family’s furtherance in society turned them into one of the prominent figures in the capital. Because of this, people wanted to appease the Lu Family at any chance they could find. Some were even hoping to have their daughters marry one of the Lu bachelors. Why not? Tying the knot with any member of the Lu Family would mean a secure life not only for their daughter but also for their family!</p>
<p>Among the husband candidates, Lu Lingzhi appeared to be the most promising. It was rumored that he would become the minister of war in two years’ time. Aside from that, he now served as Emperor Mo Rongzhan’s right hand.</p>
<p>“These two gentlemen here are your Second and Third Older Brother.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming introduced to her two young men namely Lu Tingzhi, her second brother, and Lu Zanzhi, her third brother. Both were handsome and prim, also kind enough to ask after her health to which she answered with thanks.</p>
<p>Being introduced to the members, Ye Zhen cleverly put each person’s appearance in her mind.</p>
<p>Just then laughter resonated from outside. Two girls of similar age, Second Miss Lu, Lu Fang, and Fourth Miss Lu, Lu Jing, came in and immediately injected beautiful scenery into the hall. Both of them were charming and lovely, sending people into awe for a while.</p>
<p><i>These girls must be the misses of the Lu Family</i>, Ye Zhen thought.</p>
<p>Second Miss Lu was the eldest daughter of a concubine, and Fourth Miss Lu was born of a second concubine. Only Lu Wushuang and Fifth Miss Lu, who was not around, were the legitimate daughters of the Lu Family, that is, they were the daughters of the first wives.</p>
<p>The Fifth Miss Lu was not able to attend the dinner. She was at Jiangnan with her uncle as a guardian and the family wasn’t told of her return.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming wasn’t fond of concubinage and had Pei Shi as his legal and only wife. So, in the eyes of many, Lu Yaoyao was also a legitimate daughter of the family as well.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, do you still remember me? I went to see you the other day.”</p>
<p>Lu Fang is older than Ye Zhen. Though she is not as beautiful as Lu Wushuang, she still had the charm of a jasper.</p>
<p>Actually, Ye Zhen did not remember her. She was trapped between the memories of her past life and her sister’s memories. Her memory of this person was muddled in her mind and she did not know when and where exactly she had seen her.</p>
<p>“Third Miss doesn’t particularly remember but she must remember it sometime from now.” Lu Jing spoke up.</p>
<p>“Oh! Don’t feel obliged. It is just understandable for you were ill for almost a month,” Lu Fang said, taking no offense that Ye Zhen didn’t remember her.</p>
<p>Looking at the two girls, Ye Zhen saw the difference between them. Lu Fang seemed gentle as she was gentle to everyone. On the other hand, Lu Jing, who was only two months younger than Ye Zhen, appeared haughty and seemingly looked down upon her. She didn’t even bother looking at Ye Zhen right in the eye as if she was not worth even an ounce of her attention.</p>
<p>Right then, Liu Xiangzhi, who had been to Lu Lingzhi, returned.</p>
<p>“… Suddenly, Eldest Brother was summoned to the palace, he instructed me to pass on his apology to everyone. He would not be coming back tonight.”</p>
<p>The disappointment was evident on Old Madam Lu’s face. On her side was Ye Zhen who released a deep sigh of relief as she didn’t have to see Lu Lingzhi so soon.</p>
<p>She was not afraid of him but rather herself. Seeing him in flesh, she might lose control and attack him right in front of everyone. Time was what she needed. Time to think over her moves and how she would face him-her cousin in everyone’s eye.</p>
