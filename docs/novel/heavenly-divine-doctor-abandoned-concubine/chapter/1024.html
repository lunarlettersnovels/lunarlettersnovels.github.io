            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 305 – Best Candidate for Son-in Law (1)</strong></p>
<p>Shock and silence filled the air. No one dared to move.</p>
<p>The woman probably hadn’t expected someone to be able to stop her sword with just two fingers. She wanted to pull it back but saw that, with just a slight movement of her opponent’s fingers, her sword had already broken.</p>
<p><em>What powerful qi!</em> The woman was taken aback. She retrieved her broken sword and hurriedly retreated. The unconscious girl who had been drowning suddenly jumped up,  reached towards Mo Rongyi, wanting to grab him.</p>
<p>Bu the little prince already had guards protecting him precisely against any risk of attack. The girl was unable to even get near him.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, are you all right?” Tang Zhen appeared with the guards. He took a look at Ye Zhen, who was in Mo Rongzhan’s arms.</p>
<p>“Arrest them!” Mo Rongzhan’s cold and deep voice was laden with the majesty of a sovereign. Several guards quickly circled the two assassins.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was no means of escape, the assassins wanted to raise their broken swords in an attempt to commit suicide. However, they were immediately stopped by Tang Zhen, he even dislocated their jaws to prevent them from drinking poison.</p>
<p>At this time, the civilians near the city moat had already been gathered to a side by the guards, to cordon off an area for investigation. They soon discovered the drowning girl was actually a young skinny boy. Tang Zhen called for someone to take them away.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lightly pushed Mo Rongzhan away, lowering her head and bowing. “Your Imperial Majesty.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her with a complicated gaze. “How did you know there was something wrong with those people?”</p>
<p>He had seen her pulling A’Yi towards the other direction. If she hadn’t found out there was something amiss in time, then his little brother would’ve probably already been in great danger.</p>
<p>“That drowning little girl … looked a bit strange. Her hands and feet weren’t those of a usual little girl. And that mother,  her hands were covered with thick calluses in areas that looked like she frequently wielded knives and swords. So I felt that they hadn’t really drowned.”  If they hadn’t really drowned, then they must have had other motives. Naturally, she would have to take Mo Rongyi away, in case there was any danger.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her again and said, “Go then.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was taken aback. <em>He would just let her leave?</em> She looked at his cold side profile, lowered her head, and left before he could look at her again.</p>
<p>After the civilians at the moat knew that the emperor himself had come, they all knelt down and kowtowed.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan let them stand, and didn’t continue in the area, immediately leaving with Mo Rongyi. Tang Zhen was the only one to stay behind, continuing to investigate for any possible remnant assassins.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, are you all right?” Pei Shi took her daughter’s hand, looking her up and down.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Mother, you don’t need to worry.” Ye Zhen comforted Pei Shi. Having experienced so many things now, she wasn’t even scared in the face of something like this.</p>
<p>A still jittery Pei Shi poked her. “You just scared me half to death. That sword almost got to you.”</p>
<p>“But I’m fine, aren’t I?” Ye Zhen laughingly said.</p>
<p>Right then, Tang Zhen walked over from the other direction, solemnly looking at Ye Zhen. “Yaoyao, were you startled?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was still a little miffed at Tang Zhen, but with Pei Shi and Lu Xiangzhi here, she could only restrain herself. Even so, she perfunctorily answered, “I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Marquis Jing Ning, who were those two people?” Pei Shi asked.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen saw that Ye Zhen was still mad at him, he felt a little bitter in his heart. He smiled in spite of himself and replied, “Third Madam Lu, those two people are yet to be identified. We still need to further interrogate before we can know anything.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi said, “Brother Tang, you’re very skilled.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen smiled lightly, his gaze unconsciously turning towards Ye Zhen. “I’ll have them send all of you back. This area is probably not too safe.”</p>
<p>“Then we shall inconvenience you, Marquis Jing Ning.” Pei Shi said, smiling.</p>
<p>She liked Tang Zhen. Although her daughter didn’t have any plans to get married as of now, that didn’t interfere with her silent observation of all of the young men in the capital. She had already made a choice and felt that the best choice was Tang Zhen. Though he was an orphan, that also meant that her daughter would be the lady of the house as soon as she married him, and wouldn’t have to deal with a mother-in-law. The entirety of the Marquis Mansion would be under her command. Most importantly, the young man was greatly talented, handsome, and pleasing to the eye. Paired with her daughter, they would be the most perfect couple. There was no one more suitable than him in all the capital.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned, saying, “The assassins have been captured. What other danger could there be here? Marquis Jing Ning, you must be a bit of an alarmist. We can leave on our own, and need not inconvenience you.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I think that it’s better for me to send you all back.” Tang Zhen said, “You saved Little Prince, and those two people must have masters in the shadows. I’m afraid that they might harm you.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen still wanted to refuse but was stopped by Pei Shi. “Marquis Jing Ning, you are right. It’s not good for Yaoyao to leave the house in the coming days.”</p>
