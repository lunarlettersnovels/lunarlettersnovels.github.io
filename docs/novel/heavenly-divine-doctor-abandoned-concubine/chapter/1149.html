            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 178- Finding A Cure (1)</strong></p>
<p>Walking out of Class B, the examination papers still in hand, Qin Fuzi came to the small courtyard at the south of the School of Medicine. This was the place where all the teachers and the headmaster convened after class hours. The plaque on the courtyard was old and looked like it had weathered many a winter. On it, in a majestic script that looked as awe-inspiring as dragons and phoenixes dancing in the air, was inscribed the words “Office Building”. These words were said to be written by Huangfu Xiu himself, the greatest Emperor of Jin country.</p>
<p>This courtyard housed three pavilions, with the one in the center comprising three floors. The first floor was very wide and spacious. The otherwise dull walls were brought to life by calligraphy and paintings. If one took a careful look, one would find that this calligraphy and paintings had a long history and were precious treasures that not anyone could lay their hands on. It seemed a lot of thought and effort was put into it.</p>
<p>“Qi Jin!”</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi’s excitement was evident in his voice. Without a pause, he rushed directly to the pavilion in the centre and onwards to the second floor.</p>
<p>As the Chief Professor of the School of Medicine and the highest-ranked female physician in the palace, Qi Jin held a very important position in this place of learning, ranking second only to the Head Master in power. Looking through the records and research papers, the second floor was where one could find her whenever she was in the academy premises.</p>
<p>Today, Qi Jin had not visited the palace. She had come straight to the School of Medicine to look for the medical records left by the erstwhile Empress Duanhui, Qi Yanling. So absorbed in perusing, that was how an excited Qin Fuzi found her. Catching sight of the prim and proper master skipping his way in, she looked up and smiled.</p>
<p>“Fuzi, all these years and you still cannot change this temperament? Now, what is so exciting?”</p>
<p>“Take a look at today’s answer papers.” Qin Fuzi smiled, his eyes brimming with exhilaration. His age was about the same as Qi Jin’s, but it seemed only natural that he should be treated like her junior. “Some have answered very well, the kind I have not met in years!”</p>
<p>Qi Jin raised her eyebrows and cast him an all-knowing gaze. “Is that so? Did you give them an exam on the first day? “</p>
<p>Now that his little ruse lay bare, Qin Fuzi let out a gentle cough and touched his forehead. “Ehhh, <i>cough</i>… Did you and Physician Huang not get selected to the palace like this?”</p>
<p>“Let me take a look at the papers.” Qin Jin laughed. This man had always been passionate about medicine and talent. “Nowadays, unlike in the past, the proficiency of female physicians is leaving much to be desired. Some may not necessarily enter the palace to be a physician. The imperial kitchens already intend to revoke the rule for female physicians to be picked from the Academy for Women to enter the palace.”</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi frowned. “This is a century-old rule, how can it be revoked?”</p>
<p>Qi Jin just smiled and shook her head, turning her attention to the papers Qin Fuzi brought.</p>
<p>For a long time, the School of Medicine has had a rule of selecting students to enter the palace as physicians. This rule did not disappear even after the country’s rise and fall. Originally, female physicians were not to have any kind of personal relationship with any prince of the imperial family. However, the late emperor was licentious and without morals. As soon as a beautiful physician caught his lecherous eyes, he would bludgeon her into submission, making her his concubine. For a period of time, the Jin country did not let anyone send apprentices to the palace.</p>
<p>Now… the emperor was all-powerful, domineering, and very handsome. <i>How many would want to grab the emperor’s attention?!</i></p>
<p>If she could not find a woman whose sole focus was practicing medicine, she would rather rescind the rule.</p>
<p>“Gao Xueping?” Qi Jin took out one of the papers. “This is a good answer.”</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi smiled. “There are better things to come.”</p>
<p>Qi Jin side-eyed him and continued to look through the examination paper. The other students in Class A could answer, but not as detailed as Gao Xueping. She began to read through Class B’s, she held no expectations. However, she came to a point when she was somewhat… stunned. She took a moment before speaking.</p>
<p>“This is… Lu Yaoyao?”</p>
