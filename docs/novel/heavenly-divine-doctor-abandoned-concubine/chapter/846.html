            <p><strong>Chapter 484 – Getting Better</strong></p>
<p>Having gone through the acupuncture sessions a few times now, Zhao Tianji no longer found it as painful as the first time. His hands weren’t as stiff as oranges, and his previously numb legs could move slightly. This was an unprecedented phenomenon for him.</p>
<p>“Your legs and meridians have already opened. Normally, you should go out and walk by yourself. Whether it’s by holding a stick or someone’s hand, no matter what, you have to move,” Ye Zhen said as she tidied up the needles.</p>
<p>“Since I have opened my meridians, why can’t I walk?” Zhao Tianji frowned at her even as he had Liang Yin help him sit up.</p>
<p>“How long has it been since your legs moved? Even if your meridians have opened, your muscles are already atrophied. You definitely need to move more to recover,” she said without turning her head.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, our island lord… still need to soak in the medicinal bath?” Liang Yin asked politely.</p>
<p>As Zhao Tianji’s legs got better and better, Liang Yin’s attitude towards Ye Zhen became more and more respectful, and he was no longer as vigilant as he had been at the beginning, treating her as an enemy.</p>
<p>“Soak every three days. There’s no need to soak every day,” Ye Zhen replied.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji glanced at her and said to Liang Yin, “Come out with me.”</p>
<p>Liang Yin immediately agreed. He helped his master to his wheelchair and was about to push him out when Zhao Tianji said indifferently, “Come out too.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was going to look for Huangfu Chen. At his words, she frowned and looked at the man.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji had already had Liang Yin push him out.</p>
<p>It had been over half a month, and Huangfu Chen was still under house arrest in that courtyard. Zhao Tianji had not seen him except on the first day.</p>
<p>“Island Lord Zhao, your legs have improved. Can you let us go?” Ye Zhen stood at the side, watching Zhao Tianji holding Liang Yin’s hand as he walked with difficulty. Although he was only gently moving his feet, it was already much better than sitting in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji was already sweating profusely within a few steps. He lazily glanced at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen watched him walk back and forth a few times until his entire body was drenched in sweat. He didn’t want to stop, so she could only say, “It’s enough to practice for two hours every day. You can’t walk for too long at the start. It’s not good for your body.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji finally stopped walking at her words. Instead, he asked Liang Yin to bring him in and change his clothes.</p>
<p><em>This person really…</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen grimaced behind him. If she didn’t want to leave this place, she wouldn’t have wanted to cure his legs. However, this time, she didn’t use <em>lingquan</em>. She relied solely on her true medical skills to heal his legs. She felt a little proud.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhao Tianji came out again, no longer sweating like just then, looking fresh. He had Liang Yin push him to the pavilion in the courtyard.</p>
<p>“I heard that your chess skills are pretty good. Come play with me.” Zhao Tianji’s refined and handsome face carried a faint smile, indicating for Ye Zhen to come over to the pavilion.</p>
<p>“Whence did you hear that my chess skills are good?” She raised an eyebrow. <em>I was only playing chess with Master here. Could it be that someone is really monitoring Master?</em></p>
<p>Zhao Tianji smiled faintly. “Your Highness, are you in a hurry to leave? Do you want to go back to the capital or elsewhere?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sat down. “Huaijiang.”</p>
<p>“So, can you guarantee that my legs will heal in half a month?” Zhao Tianji asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not an immortal. Even if your legs are connected with the meridians, you still need to practice walking by yourself. It’s good fortune if you can walk normally after half a year.” Ye Zhen said, “If you don’t believe me, you can ask my master.”</p>
<p>At the mention of Huangfu Chen, Zhao Tianji’s face turned ugly. “Don’t mention him in front of me.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips. “Then you….”</p>
<p>“Why did you take Huangfu Chen as your master?” He interrupted her, but his eyes were on the chessboard as he played with her.</p>
<p>“If you want to take him as your master, then take him as your master. Master is not only proficient in divination, but his medical skills are also brilliant. It’s my honor to have him as my master,” she said.</p>
<p>“Divination?” Zhao Tianji sneered. “If he knows divination, how could he not know what would happen to him?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he did calculate, but there is nothing he can change even if he wants to?” She eyed him faintly. “Not all destinies can be easily changed, being able to divinate doesn’t mean he is immortal.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji froze for a moment. “You’re right, your master is useless.”</p>
<p>“You’re saying it as if you’re very useful. If you’re really that strong, how could you practice your internal strength to such an extent?” Although she did not know what had happened between her master and this Island Lord, she was just such a person who would shield her relatives and friends such that no one could utter an ill word.</p>
<p>“You really are quite bold.” He looked at her coldly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “What’s there to be afraid of now? At worst, I’ll die.”</p>
<p>She had just finished speaking when she suddenly felt a wave of killing intent assault her face. She raised her eyebrows and looked at Zhao Tianji.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji held a chess piece and gently placed it on the chessboard. “Mu Xue, I remember that I said you’d better not appear before my sight.”</p>
<p>Mu Xue walked out from the corner and looked at Ye Zhen viciously. “Second Young Master, this woman is disrespectful to you. This subordinate will teach her a lesson on your behalf.”</p>
<p>“Scram!” Zhao Tianji bellowed in a deep voice.</p>
<p>“Second Young Master?” Mu Xue turned her head in disbelief. In the past, anyone who dared to act impudently before Second Young Master would have already been killed. <em>Why did he spare this woman?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the chessboard that had already been decided. She picked up the black piece with a smile and put it down casually. “It looks like Island Lord Zhao can’t even suppress a servant.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji snorted coldly. “Lu Yaoyao, don’t sow discord in front of me.”</p>
<p>His words had only just fallen when his eyes were drawn to the game on the board, and actually … a defeat into a victory by just one piece?</p>
<p>Mu Xue stood behind Zhao Tianji, staring coldly at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“How did you do it?” Zhao Tianji looked up at her in surprise.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and said, “Didn’t you hear that I’m good at chess? This is me telling you that my chess skills are indeed good.”</p>
<p>“You…!”</p>
<p>“Master!” Outside the pavilion, Qiu Yuan rushed over and interrupted their conversation.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji glanced at him. “What is it?”</p>
<p>Seeing that Ye Zhen was also present, Qiu Yuan walked up to Zhao Tianji and whispered into his ear, “Master, there’s someone making trouble in the mine. They said they want to leave….”</p>
<p>“You still want to tell me such a trivial matter? Whoever wants to leave, kill them,” Zhao Tianji said coldly.</p>
<p>Qiu Yuan said, “There… are a hundred people causing trouble.”</p>
<p>Should we kill all those hundred people? Then at least half of the work in the iron mine would not be done.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji frowned and pondered for a while. He raised his eyes to look at Ye Zhen. “You go with me to take a look.”</p>
