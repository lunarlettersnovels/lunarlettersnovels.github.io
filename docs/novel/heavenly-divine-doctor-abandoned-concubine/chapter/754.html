            <p><strong>Chapter 577 – His Majesty has Arrived</strong></p>
<p>Now that Ye Yaoyao had spilled the troubles in her heart, she began smiling again. “Yaoyao, I shall not disturb you anymore. I’ll make my way back now.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t know how else to advise her anyway. All she hoped was that Ye Yaoyao would not be made use of by Lu Lingzhi, if not, she might end up even more severely hurt.</p>
<p>After what happened, Ye Zhen no longer wanted to continue soaking in the hot springs. She picked up her things and walked back into her room, then called out for Yu Ping to help her prepare for bed.</p>
<p>“Yu—”</p>
<p>“You’re finally done with your chat.” Before she could call out for Yu Ping, her lips were lightly sealed as a pair of strong arms caged her in like a wall. “<em>Zhen</em> has been waiting here for a long time.”</p>
<p><em>Mo Rongzhan?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen was surprised, and just as she was about to speak, the man stuck his tongue into her mouth and began to suck hers gently yet passionately.</p>
<p>However, she was wearing nothing under her robe! Mo Rongzhan realised it the moment he hugged her, so his hand slid into her robe. The tender and smooth flesh felt like a piece of warm jade, and his breathing turned heavier. He hugged her tightly and pushed her against the door, as his warm and wet kisses slowly fell onto her neck.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was kissed until she was numb and sore, so she pushed the man away forcefully, then furiously glared at his handsome face. “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nibbled her lips and kissed her more. “I came to look for you, this heartless little lass, because I was worried that you might be jealous and unhappy. <em>Zhen</em> thinks about you day and night, but you don’t seem to ever keep me on your mind.”</p>
<p>“Stop groping me!” Ye Zhen forcefully pulled away the hand that was kneading her chest, then tightened her robe even more as she glared at him guardedly. “It must really be hard on you, Your Majesty. You’ve already decided on an empress, but you can still travel all the way here to be a rascal.”</p>
<p>“Now that <em>zhen</em> is going to appoint an empress, aren’t you upset?” Mo Rongzhan suppressed the evil fire coursing within his body, carried her up, and placed her on a soft cushion on the side.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s expression was frigid. “Why should I be upset? Since you’re here, did you listen to the conversation I had with Ye Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan felt a sharp pain in his heart when he heard that his beloved wasn’t upset. He smiled bitterly and said, “Do you really not care about <em>zhen</em> at all? Regardless of whether <em>zhen</em> wants to decree a marriage for you or wants to appoint an empress, aren’t you willing to even ask me what I’m trying to do?”</p>
<p>“What has it got to do with me?” Under his burning gaze, a sense of guilt stirred in her heart, so she lowered her head, unwilling to meet his eyes.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan held her chin and forcibly raised her head. “Is that what you really think?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bit her lip. She couldn’t tell him that she had already decided to leave the Jin Country. Since there was news of her father, she was definitely going to look for them. But if this man were to find out about it, he would certainly resort to all means to make her stay. So, she couldn’t say anything… And even more so, she couldn’t anger him.</p>
<p>“Why did you make such a decree?” she asked softly. She couldn’t deny it; when she heard what Lu Lingzhi said, she felt upset for a long time.</p>
<p>He pinched the tip of her nose. “Naturally, it’s because of you.”</p>
<p>“Just for me… You had to get people to spread rumours that you were a wife-jinxer?” She asked begrudgingly, “Don’t you dislike Ye Zhen? Then why are you still using her death to achieve your goals? To think that you’d even said that you don’t owe her anything.”</p>
<p>Whenever Ye Zhen was mentioned, Mo Rongzhan could feel Lu Yaoyao’s hatred towards him. He hugged her and said helplessly, “<em>Zhen</em> didn’t intentionally make use of her. She’s already dead, and who knows, she might really have been jinxed by <em>zhen</em>. If she didn’t marry <em>zhen</em>, she might still be living well right now.”</p>
<p>She was infuriated. She punched his shoulder forcefully and yelled, “Mo Rongzhan, you’re really a ba*tard!”</p>
<p>He grabbed both her hands, then peppered her forehead with a few kisses. “<em>Zhen</em> needs to leave soon. Don’t argue with <em>zhen</em> now.”</p>
<p>“Get lost!” she yelled.</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> was worried that you would be unhappy upon hearing the news that I was going to appoint an empress and specially came over to explain things to you. How can you be so ungrateful?” He inched closer to her ear and said in a hoarse voice, “<em>Zhen</em> hasn’t slept well for the past few days. I managed to complete all the matters in the Imperial Court today with much difficulty and didn’t even rest before rushing over to see you. Yet, you’re asking <em>zhen</em> to get lost… How heartless can you be?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen noticed that his hands were getting unruly again and the softness that had surfaced in her heart instantly dissipated. “Heartless? Yes, I’m just heartless. Are you satisfied now?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan bit her ear. “Even if you’re heartless, <em>zhen</em> still wants you.”</p>
<p>“Did… Did you hear what Ye Yaoyao said just now?” Her entire body felt weak from his kisses, and she struggled, trying to avoid him, so that he couldn’t kiss her ear.</p>
<p>“So what if I heard it?” he retorted nonchalantly. He wasn’t concerned with what Ye Yaoyao had said. His time was precious, and naturally, he would aim to spend as much time in the arms of his woman. Where would he have time for others?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lay limply in his arms, struggling to retain a trace of rationality. “She loves you very deeply and thinks that you’ll bring her into the palace and make her a concubine in the future. Do you… Do you also think this way?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nibbled and kissed the tender flesh on her chest and upon hearing her said in a breathy tone, “There are countless women under the sun who want to enter the palace and become a concubine. Does that mean <em>zhen</em> has to summon all those women into the palace? If that happens, <em>zhen </em>will probably drown in your vat of vinegar.”</p>
<p>“Ba*tard! What are you saying?!” Ye Zhen cried out in a huff. “So what’s going to happen to Ye Yaoyao? Did you manage to find out if she’s really the person you have been looking for?”</p>
<p>“Regardless of whether she is, right now, <em>zhen</em> can only treat her as she is—” Mo Rongzhan’s gaze chilled. If he didn’t do that, how could he lure the person who was making use of Ye Yaoyao to show himself?</p>
<p>Now, Ye Zhen knew that he wasn’t intending on looking for the person who had really saved him. “If it isn’t her, then are you… Are you not going to look for your real saviour?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked up and met her eyes, then kissed her already swollen lips. “<em>Zhen</em> will get people to continue looking for her, but I won’t… Won’t think about her as much anymore.”</p>
<p>“You’re still unwilling to believe that the person who saved you… might actually be Ye Zhen.” She revealed a smile that looked even more bitter than when she cried. If he was going to stop his search, that meant that he… He didn’t want to remember that young girl from back then anymore.</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> has said this before. It won’t be her.” He took a deep breath, unwilling to quarrel over this matter anymore.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no need to argue over this matter anymore. Ye Zhen smiled, then proactively hugged his neck. “Lu Lingzhi already knows that I’m not his cousin. That day, he even said all sorts of strange things. What if… What if my real identity is exposed in the future, will you make me a criminal?”</p>
<p><em>How did Lu Lingzhi find out about it?</em> Mo Rongzhan frowned, then tightened his hug around the woman in his arms. “No. <em>Zhen</em> will protect you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like my eldest cousin—” Ye Zhen pouted, looking as though she was aggrieved. “And I really don’t like him touching me.”</p>
<p>Right now, she didn’t have the luxury of time. She couldn’t wait until Ye Yaoyao regained her memories nor did she have the time to look for Lu Wushuang. As such, she could only use the most direct method to speed up her departure— get Mo Rongzhan to deal with Lu Lingzhi on her behalf.</p>
