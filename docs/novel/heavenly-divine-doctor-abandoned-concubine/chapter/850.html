            <p><strong>Chapter 480 – Killing Intent</strong></p>
<p>“Miss!” Dai Mei was brought over. When she saw that her mistress was actually brewing medicinal soup alone, her heart ached and she almost cried.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked up and saw that it was her maid, a smile appeared on her face. “Dai Mei, they’ve finally sent you here.”</p>
<p>“Miss, how can you do this?” Dai Mei hurriedly went to take over the work in her mistress’s hands. “This servant will help you.”</p>
<p>“Can one still be a pampered young lady here?” She smiled. “Help me watch the fire.”</p>
<p>“Miss, what should we do now?” she whispered. “Is it… that we won’t be able to escape in the future?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen held the herbs in her hand. She paused for a moment before smiling. “How could that be? As long as they don’t kill us, we’ll have a chance to leave.”</p>
<p>“This servant is not afraid to die, I’m just worried about you, Young Miss….” Her eyes reddened. If something were to happen to her mistress, what should she do?</p>
<p>“Don’t think too much. Let’s get on with things first.” She patted the emotional maid on the shoulder. Now, no matter how much she feared, it was useless. Could it be that they could escape if they were afraid? It was better to let Zhao Tianji believe her and not kill her. As long as they did not die, they would have a chance to leave.</p>
<p>Dai Mei nodded gently, raised her eyes to look at Liang Yin standing outside, lowered her head to work, and said nothing more.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen brewed the medicinal soup and had Liang Yin send it to Zhao Tianji’s room.</p>
<p>When the water temperature was just right, Zhao Tianji immersed himself in the medicinal bath. Less than a quarter of an hour into it, all his meridians started to throb with pain. Even though he tried to endure as best as he could, it felt like his bones, tendons, and veins were being ripped apart. He bellowed.</p>
<p>“Island Lord!” Liang Yin exclaimed, wanting to bring Zhao Tianji out of the bathtub.</p>
<p>“Scram!” Zhao Tianji screamed, “Get out!”</p>
<p>Liang Yin knew that his master had been proud since young and would never show weakness in front of others. He definitely did not want others to see him like this. “Island Lord, I’ll wait for you outside.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji panted heavily. He had never felt pain in his life. How could someone as proud as him allow others to see him in such a sorry state?</p>
<p>“What exactly are you soaking our Island Lord?” Liang Yin walked out of the room and went outside to question Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stood on the stone steps in the courtyard. Zhao Tianji’s screeching roar had made it to her ears, offering some relief to her pent-up resentment for the man. <em>Would that he died of the pain!</em></p>
<p>She had already heard Zhao Tianji’s roar. Such a pained voice sounded like a relief to him. It was enough to kill him!</p>
<p>“If he doesn’t feel any pain, then you have to worry, his hands and feet won’t last for the rest of his life.” She curled her lips. It was this pain that proved his feet were not really dead.</p>
<p>Liang Yin coldly glanced at the little girl. His killing intent was glacial. Should their Island Lord have a mishap, he would definitely kill this woman first.</p>
<p>About an hour later, Liang Yin heard Zhao Tianji’s voice, “Come in!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Island Lord.” Liang Yin responded anxiously and immediately ran in.</p>
<p>“Call that woman in.” Zhao Tianji felt that all his strength had disappeared, but his heavy legs seemed to have relaxed a little.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen came in. “Island Lord Zhao, how do you feel?”</p>
<p>“Why does the decoction make my whole body hurt?” Zhao Tianji was half lying down, staring coldly at the little girl before him.</p>
<p>“This decoction has the effect of dredging the meridians. The meridians in your body are blocked by the evil <em>qi</em>. You will naturally feel pain,” she said nonchalantly, “Besides, you still have acupuncture today. It will certainly add to the pain.”</p>
<p>He raised his hand and touched his legs. “How long do I have to soak to… open up all the meridians in my body again?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, it’s not like I’ve ever treated a disease like yours before,” she said.</p>
<p>“How are you certain that you can cure Island Lord?” Liang Yin asked in a deep voice.</p>
<p>“Who knows, perhaps he can really be cured?” She waved her hand. A doctor would always encounter an illness they’ve never seen before. If she could cure Zhao Tianji this time, it would definitely add to her repertoire of medical cases.</p>
<p>Any illness would happen for the first time. If she could cure Zhao Tianji this time, her medical case would definitely increase by one.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji cast a deep look on Ye Zhen. If he continued to ask, he would receive the same answer. At the very least, his numb legs could now feel pain. This could be considered a good sign. “You can go down.”</p>
<p>“I’ve written a prescription. You’ll drink the concoction once every day after soaking in the medicinal bath,” she said.</p>
<p>“Liang Yin, go get the medicine,” Zhao Tianji said indifferently.</p>
<p>“Second Young Master, you can’t drink her medicine!” Mu Xue walked in from outside the door and glared fiercely at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not know who this woman in black was, but she could feel the killing intent and hostility she was emanating. It seemed to be… Against her?</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji’s eyes were icy, and a cold smile crept on his handsome face. “Mu Xue, when was it your turn to care about my business?”</p>
<p>“Second Young Master, this subordinate is only worried about you.” Her expression changed slightly, and a trace of sadness flashed through her eyes. “This woman is Huangfu Chen’s apprentice and harbors ulterior motives. This subordinate is worried that she will harm you.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about my business!” Zhao Tianji said coldly, “Leave!”</p>
<p>Mu Xue bit her lip and looked at Second Young Master awkwardly.</p>
<p>The said man did not even spare her a glance, he just turned towards Ye Zhen. “You leave, come back tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Okay!” Ye Zhen couldn’t wait to leave. She felt that Mu Xue would kill her any moment.</p>
<p>After exiting the room, she had Dai Mei return to the room to rest while she went to look for her master.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen had heard about Zhao Tianji’s illness and looked at Ye Zhen in surprise. This little girl’s medical talent was even better than he had imagined. She could peruse many medical books at once, and she seemed to have a very good memory. She could remember almost every medical case clearly.</p>
<p>“A few years ago, I met him. I didn’t think that there was a problem with his meridians.” Huangfu Chen sighed softly.</p>
<p>“At that time, perhaps he had just started practicing his internal energy, that’s why you didn’t diagnose it.” What Ye Zhen meant was if it was the Zhao Tian Ji from a few years ago, she too would definitely not be able to detect the cause of his illness.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen nodded gently. “Yaoyao, can you cure Zhao Tianji?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” She looked outside, wondering if their conversation was being monitored. “Master, I have never given acupuncture to someone with such a disease before let alone treat, so I can only hope it works.”</p>
<p>“Since he felt something in his legs after the acupuncture, it shouldn’t be wrong.” Huangfu Chen smiled and said, “He didn’t get angry with you, right?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen also felt that since there were sensations, the treatment should be correct. “He did not do anything to me. Master, you know a woman called Mu Xue?”</p>
<p>“Mu Xue?” Huangfu Chen froze. “Is she here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master, do you know her?” She eyed him suspiciously. She had heard Zhao Tianji call that woman Mu Xue, she didn’t know if it had anything to do with Mu Qing.</p>
