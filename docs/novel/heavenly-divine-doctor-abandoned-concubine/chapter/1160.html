            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 167 – Rejection</strong></p>
<p>“Grandmother, I did not mean it that way.” Lu Lingzhi hurriedly took back his words.</p>
<p>He was only worried that people around Mo Rongzhan would recognize Lu Yaoyao’s resemblance to the deceased Wang Fei Ye.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao is pure and tolerant. It was only a coincidence that the emperor met her which angered Shuang’er. Lu Shiming and Pei Shi have not ever raised their hands against Yaoyao, how could Shuang’er do so? She is very hot-tempered—” Old Madam Lu wanted to criticize Lu Wushuang more but suddenly remembered that she was already the wang fei, so she did not continue.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi listened intently. He knew his sister like he knew his own mind. Lu Wushuang would not act so rash if she was not provoked.</p>
<p>It must have been Princess Royal’s taunting adding up with her jealousy of Lu Yaoyao’s beauty and she became agitated, thinking that her cousin would catch the emperor’s interest, and in a haze of fury, slapped Lu Yaoyao hard.</p>
<p>His younger sister still did not understand that Mo Rongzhan was not the kind of person who would be tempted by beauty. Was not Wang Fei Ye a beauty? But the emperor had ignored her.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Lu Wushuang’s insecurity that made her act callous.</p>
<p>Yet why would she feel insecure in the first place? If the emperor still doted on her, she would not feel threatened every time a woman approached Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I will go into the imperial palace and talk to Shuang’er.”</p>
<p>The old madam nodded encouragingly. “Since she was still a child, she listens only to you. Tell her to keep herself from overthinking and her actions must stay in modesty. If she does not trust her sister, who else can she trust?”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I know you are already tired. You must rest early.” Lu Lingzhi told her.</p>
<p>Unlike Old Madam Lu, he knew that Lu Yaoyao was not a weak and timid person. What happened in the palace was not as simple as the old madam believed. He could not wait to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>Indeed, Old Madam Lu did feel a little tired. “I did not see the wang fei when I left the palace. I do not know what she could have been thinking at the time. I am afraid of the things she could do against Yaoyao. Watch her.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandmother.”</p>
<p>Coming out of the upper wing, Lu Lingzhi looked at the small courtyard situated on the other side, which was Ye Zhen’s.</p>
<p><i>Perhaps, I should visit her tomorrow. </i></p>
<div data-fuse="22037344116" data-fuse-code="fuse-slot-22037344116-1" data-fuse-slot="71161633/WORD_wordexcerpt/chapter_incontent_2"></div>
<p>In her chambers, Ye Zhen was sighing at the red spots on her face. “If I had known it was useless, I would not have done it! Now I must find a way to make you disappear.”</p>
<p>“Third Miss.” Just then, Dai Mei came in from outside.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smeared her face with the ointment once more and looked at her maid. “What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Minister Lu Lingzhi just left the hall.” She reported wondering why her mistress suddenly wanted her to spy on Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>“Oh, all right. You should retire now.” Ye Zhen smiled at her gratefully.</p>
<p>Now, she knew that Lu Lingzhi was indeed suspicious. Otherwise, he would not have stayed longer to talk to Old Madam Lu alone. He would visit her tomorrow, she was sure.</p>
<p>“Dai Mei.” Ye Zhen stopped the maid in her tracks before she reached the door. “You cannot say a word about this to anyone. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“This maidservant understands and rest assured that I would be silent about this, Third Miss.”</p>
<p>Dai Mei had now taken Ye Zhen as her only master. How could she ever betray her?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded with satisfaction. “Thank you and rest well.”</p>
<p>Tomorrow, she would go to the Academy for Women, but this time, she would go with great determination. She would achieve her goal, no matter how hard it would be.</p>
<p>She glanced at the mirror again, hoping that by the time she got up tomorrow, the red spots would have already disappeared, and she would not have to go to the academy with it.</p>
<p>As she changed her clothes and laid down on her bed, her mind kept coming back to today’s events. Mo Rongzhan’s attitude towards Lu Wushuang baffled her.</p>
<p><i>Could it be that he already knew that she tricked him? </i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>The Imperial Palace</p>
<p>Inside her palace, Lu Wushuang gradually calmed down from the outrage she felt and realized she lost her gentle and dignified manner in front of Mo Rongzhan. A tremendous regret filled her heart. As an apology, she willed herself to get up and visit Mo Rongzhan in his study.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was holding a piece of the broken jade pendant when he heard of Lu Wushuang’s request for an audience. His dark and gloomy eyes flashed a cold light. He tucked the pendant away.</p>
<p>“Let Wang Fei in.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang, who was outside, heard him summon, her face beamed with joy. She fixed her hair and entered the imperial study with a smile. With injustice and tenderness on her face, she spoke ruefully.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I have come to apologize.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her, “What is Wang Fei apologizing for?”</p>
<p>“Today, this wang fei acted impulsively and rudely in front of the emperor. Will His Majesty forgive her for this?” Lu Wushuang remorsefully asked.</p>
<p>If he had not found out that Lu Wushuang was a fraud, Mo Rongzhan would not have been angry with her for such a trivial matter. But today, he felt repugnant by her presence. If not for Lu Lingzhi’s upcoming war and his quiet search for the little girl who saved him, he would not have had this conversation with her to begin with.</p>
<p>“I am not angry with you, do not take it to heart. I have other things to do. Go back.” Was Mo Rongzhan’s dispassionate response before he drew his gaze back to his scrolls.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang’s smile froze in that very instant. She did not expect to be driven away so soon.</p>
<p>For so long, it was only at this moment that she felt like a nobody in his eyes.</p>
<p><i>Such blatant rejection… was this how Wang Fei Ye felt before?  </i></p>
