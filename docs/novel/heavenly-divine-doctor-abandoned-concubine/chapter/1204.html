<p>At this moment, everyone audibly let out a series of stunned “Ooohhh!”</p>
<p>Princess Liu Hua looked satisfied; she bore a smug look as the crowd marveled at the magnanimous wealth she was willing to risk.</p>
<p>“Marquis Tang, how many silver taels do you have now?” Ye Zhen turned to ask Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>Originally, she had not intended on taking this bet too seriously because her confidence was high.</p>
<p>However, the competition morphed into a game of trickery and deceit. The teacher in front of her was clearly loyal to Princess Liu Hua and there was no way she would let her pass the exam.</p>
<p>Princess Liu Hua used her power well. Having two puppet teachers under her control, she had personally instructed them to forbid Ye Zhen from entering the academy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ye Zhen did not want to bring trouble to Princess Liu Hua but the latter seemed to be actively seeking it.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen had one of his eunuchs bring out 2,000 taels. “2,000 taels, is this enough?”</p>
<p>Giving a grateful smile, Ye Zhen borrowed it and said to the princess, “This is my bet. Will you accept this?”</p>
<p>Liu Hua smiled contemptuously. “As long as you say so, this princess will accept it.”</p>
<p>“One to twenty, that’s what you said.” Ye Zhen gave the silver taels to Princess Liu Hua’s maid.</p>
<p>“It depends on whether you have the ability to win the money.” Princess Liu Hua sneered and looked at the two examiners.</p>
<p>The other students who had finished the examination all watched the scene and could not tell what kind of results Ye Zhen would get in the end.</p>
<p>Among them, Sun Wen was the most nervous. She was afraid that Ye Zhen would not pass the examination. It would cause great humiliation to her and her family.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please be my witness that the princess has charged me 2,000 taels. In her own words, if I can enter the academy, she will have to compensate 20 times this amount of money.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi patted his chest and announced with a loud voice. “This prince is the living witness!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded with satisfaction and curtsied to the two teachers. “Teachers, please rate my performance.”</p>
<p>The two teachers looked each other in the eye. The examiner cleared her throat and said, “Although your drums were excellent, they are not the orthodox method of taking the exam. That should be dancing on drums, not performing musical instruments. I will give you a B.”</p>
<p>Princess Liu Hua heard these words and the corners of her mouth lifted up.</p>
<p>Of all the reactions people expected from someone who failed, Ye Zhen’s was the most different—she smiled sweetly and held her head high.</p>
<p>“Teachers, have you forgotten that drum dancing is part of musical art? Why is my drum dance not orthodox? Unless the two of you have forgotten what the Six Arts are all about? “</p>
<p>The so-called Six Arts of China involve Calligraphy, Mathematics, Archery, Equestrianism, Music, and Etiquette. Among the Six Arts, music is the most diverse as examinees could use numerous instruments such as harp, pipa, guqin, drums, zither, and more.</p>
<p>Her drum dance was perfectly matched.</p>
<p>“If you two say that I cannot dance well on the drum, then this student will have to disagree,” Ye Zhen said lightly.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen decided to intervene. “Why don’t we ask the dean for her opinion?” The dean was a woman whom Princess Liu Hua could not intimidate with her silvers.</p>
<p>“There is no need to invite the dean! We—we were narrow-minded and did not expect Lu Yaoyao to perform drums!” one examiner said hastily and wrote an A on Ye Zhen’s test card.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Princess Liu Hua turned blue with anger and panic. “How can you change your decision that fast?!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sneered in her heart. It seems that some teachers in the academy had been replaced with dense, undignified educators. No wonder Teacher Shan insisted on leaving and did not want to stay to teach.</p>
