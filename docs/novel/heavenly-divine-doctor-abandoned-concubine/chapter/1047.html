            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 282 – The Road to Peril (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Turned out to be Liu Hua!</em> Ye Zhen sneered. “Take this man away and get lost!”</p>
<p>Wherever these two perpetrators would hide, even if they were not afraid of Ye Zhen’s arrows, they would have to worry about the Lu Family for trying to harm one of their misses. Even if it’s none of their business, the fact that they had attempted to abduct Ye Zhen by the order of Princess Royal’s people, they would have to face the consequences.</p>
<p>Watching them beat a hasty retreat, Ye Zhen could finally feel at ease, so much so that she almost sat down on the ground.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bow and arrow from her archery class were still in the carriage, otherwise, she definitely could have done nothing to defend herself. <em>Liu Hua!</em> Ye Zhen’s eyes flashed with fierceness, determined to make that princess payback.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, are you all right?” A clear and gentle voice came from behind.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was frightened again thinking there were still other accomplices around. When she turned around and saw Huangfu Chen, she was relieved. “Mister Chen, it is you.”</p>
<p>“I just saw Miss Lu in distress. I was going to help her, but I didn’t expect … Miss Lu is a woman who is not inferior to a man. It was a real eye-opener to me. I don’t know if I should sympathize with those thugs who wanted to hurt you,” Huangfu Chen said with a smile.</p>
<p>He had appeared when Ye Zhen’s maid was knocked unconscious. He was planning to come to rescue her when saw Ye Zhen exit the carriage and completely subdue the trio with one arrow after another.</p>
<p>Like a female warrior, she had raised and shot arrows with her bow in an imposing manner. Her eyes gleaming, domineering aura, her whole person seemed to shine brilliantly rendering people speechless at first glance.</p>
<p>“Mister Chen, you are joking.” Ye Zhen wryly smiled and shook her head. Remembering that her two servants were all injured, she hurriedly went to check their injuries.</p>
<p>Dai Mei was just knocked unconscious and didn’t have any injuries. Quan Fu was stabbed, the clothes on his chest were soaked with blood.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen softly said, “Go back to the carriage first, I’ll have a look here.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen remembered that Huangfu Chen was also a doctor, and nodded gently, asking him to help carry Dai Mei into the carriage. Then, she passed him a bottle of salve. “I made this wound medicine, this might help heal Quan Fu.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen took it with a smile, checked Quan Fu’s condition, and made sure that he was still alive so that he could deal with the wound for him, while Ye Zhen went to accompany Dai Mei.</p>
<p>“His injury is severe. I am afraid that he will not wake up so soon. It is almost dark. I will send you back,” Huangfu Chen said to Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your trouble Mister Chen,” Ye Zhen said gratefully. Now, she really needed someone to send her back to the Lu Family.</p>
<p>Dai Mei soon woke up, and as soon as she opened her eyes, she cried, “Young Miss … Young Miss, let’s go—”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>News of Ye Zhen’s brush with abduction shook the Lu Mansion, especially Old Madam Lu. Her precious granddaughter had been on the brink of tragedy, upset as she was for the little girl’s sake, she was even more incensed by the audacity of the perpetrators. She at once had the victim sketch the bandits that escaped and posthaste declared rewards to anyone who apprehended them.</p>
<p>Pei Shi was still reeling in shock, clutching her daughter tightly in her arms. It was unfathomable that a girl who had only been to appreciate the Meihua Forest was imperiled and within the capital!</p>
<p>“Mother, I’m fine, really.” Ye Zhen comforted Pei Shi in a soft voice.</p>
<p>Ever since the incident, her heart had been unsettled.  She was no stranger to killing, but that was limited to hunting. This was the first time she had aimed her arrows to claim a human life. But she was slowly finding her composure, reminding herself that if she had done otherwise, she would be embracing the Almighty and not her foster mother.</p>
<p>“You almost got abducted. How could you be fine?” Pei Shi said with a  choked voice. “That Liu Hua is going too far in bullying others! We, the Lu Family, are really being bullied.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes were slightly heavy, her face was buried in Pei Shi’s arms. She wouldn’t let Liu Hua get away with this. It was only an argument and she had gone as far as hurting her mortally. If she did not have the bow and arrow today, the consequences would have been unimaginable. As she ruminated, Ye Zhen’s determination … So what if she had no evidence against the princess, she could still slander her reputation.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu affectionately looked at Ye Zhen, and said in anger, “Yes! I can’t just leave this matter alone. Tomorrow I shall submit a petition into the emperor’s palace and personally find Empress Dowager to redress the injustice.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, Mother, I’ve made you worry.” Ye Zhen whispered guiltily.</p>
<p>“How can you be blamed for this? Now that you’ve returned home safely, we feel at ease at least.” Old Madam Lu said softly, “Many thanks to Mister Chen. Fortunately, he passed by, otherwise—”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen extracted herself from Pei Shi’s arms and asked, “Where is Mister Chen?”</p>
<p>Pei Shi affectionately patted Ye Zhen’s head. “Your father and brother are thanking him. It’s a good thing he’s here. He’s our benefactor.”</p>
<p>“Well—”</p>
<p>Deep down Ye Zhen was also grateful to Huangfu Chen. Her first impressions of the man had been favourable. She had thought of him as a noble, elegant, and erudite gentleman. Today only strengthened his image in her heart. He could have walked away at the first instance, yet he chose to get involved in the melee. He had willingly escorted her back, for though she was only almost abducted, gossip would still do its rounds. So, the sensitive and honorable man had decided to send her home himself and put a stop to all rumours before they even arose.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu looked at Ye Zhen gently. “Yaoyao, you must have been terrified today. Go and have some rest. You can rest assured Grandmother will get justice for you.”</p>
