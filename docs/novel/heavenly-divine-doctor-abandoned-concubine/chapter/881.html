            <p><strong>Chapter 448 – Murdering Your Own Husband</strong></p>
<p>“Did Xu Huiru say something to you?” Mo Rongzhan asked, recalling her(XH) strange behaviour from the day before, a stern light flashing through his eyes.</p>
<p>“Does it matter to you what others said?” she said, a faint mocking lilt in her words.</p>
<p>He pinched her chin and said, “If it makes you unhappy, then it’s naturally important to <em>zhen</em>.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen slapped his hands away, inciting his anger, and said, “Have Eunuch Fu rub the medicine for you after you take your bath in the evening.”</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> will wait for you,” Mo Rongzhan said decisively.</p>
<p>“Then, take your time and wait.” She smiled a little as she turned around and walked out.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen went back to the Female Physicians’ Wing, there was no one around. Instead, they were gathered in the courtyard chatting idly. When one of them saw her coming in, she waved to her.</p>
<p>“What are you guys talking about?” Ye Zhen asked with a smile as she sat down next to Chen Jinru and joined in.</p>
<p>Xia Yaohua said, “Just now, Chief Gong told us to choose two female physicians to go to Huaijiang with Qi Yizheng. So, right now we’re discussing who will be chosen.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes brightened and she asked, “What’s the purpose of going to Huaijiang?”</p>
<p>“In the previous years, there had frequent floods in Huaijiang. And soon after, a plague would ensue. So, this year, Imperial Physician Qi is planning to go there early to prepare for the plague, lest it kills a lot of people.” Xia Yaohua explained to Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Which one of you wants to go?” Ye Zhen asked, looking at everyone in curiosity only to find that all of them looked embarrassed and seemed to be reluctant to go. So, she laughed and frankly said, “In that case, I want to go with Qi Yizheng. Don’t argue with me.”</p>
<p>Chen Jinru was shocked. “Yaoyao, are you serious?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen only smiled and said, “How could I be otherwise?”</p>
<p>“You… You come with me!” Chen Jinru grabbed her hand and pulled Ye Zhen back to the office.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Ye Zhen asked. She remembered that there would be a flood in Huaijiang this year as well and the plague that followed was very serious too. Furthermore, if she remembered it right, it seemed that there was a massacre of a village as well. At that time her soul was imprisoned in the imperial study, so she was able to see with her own eyes that Mo Rongzhan was so furious because of this matter that he continuously beheaded many officials.</p>
<p>Thus, she wanted to go to Huaijiang. There, not only could she avoid Mo Rongzhan temporarily but also hone her medical skills. After all, right now, she had already read enough medical books, but there were few opportunities to really treat patients. Therefore, she wanted to leave the palace and practice, so as to make her medical skills more exquisite.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you don’t have to go to Huaijiang. No one here wants to go there. It’s said that the female physicians who go there every year can’t come back alive. That place has always contracted a plague every year without fail. It’s like that place is cursed. Yaoyao, listen to me, you’re a princess. No one would dare to force you if you don’t want to go, so don’t… Besides, once you go there, you won’t be able to come back for half a year,” Chen Jinru whispered to Ye Zhen, trying to persuade her to drop the idea.</p>
<p>However, what she considered a problem was not a problem for Ye Zhen at all. Anyway, what she wanted the most was to leave the capital for a while. She needed to think about what she should do next because she found out that she had no strong hatred for Mo Rongzhan. Therefore, she needed to consider what she should do in addition to letting Lu Lingzhi get his just retribution?</p>
<p>“I understand,” Ye Zhen said with a smile adorning her face. “I’ll go and change my clothes first.”</p>
<p>Chen Jinru looked at her helplessly as she made one last-ditch effort. “Do you really want to go?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled but said nothing. She simply went to the cleanroom to freshen up before she left the Female Physicians’ Wing and went to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard to find Qi Jin.</p>
<p>Qi Jin had been treating the remnant poison in Lu Lingzhi for the past half month, but these days, she had handed Lu Lingzhi over to Huangfu Chen and returned to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard.</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi.” Ye Zhen knocked on the door and greeted Qi Jin, who was sitting behind the bookcase.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, what are you doing here?” Qi Jin asked with a smile, motioning her to come in and sit down.</p>
<p>“I come here to see you for something,” Ye Zhen said as her eyes swept past the open books before and saw that she was looking at the medical records of the disaster and plague that hit Huaijiang over the years.</p>
<p>Not suspecting anything, Qi Jin smiled and asked, “Do you want to ask about your brother’s illness? Don’t worry, the emperor has given your eldest brother the only fire lotus left in the palace, and currently, Ah Chen is developing an antidote for your eldest brother. I believe he will soon be able to detoxify your eldest brother.”</p>
<p>The smile at the corner of Ye Zhen’s lips froze uncontrollably. <em>What?! Mo Rongzhan gave the fire lotus to Lu Lingzhi?</em></p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, didn’t my eldest brother take the fire lotus last time?” she asked, reluctantly forcing herself to smile when she did so.</p>
<p>“Yes, ah. This time, I hope Ah Chen can find out the real method of detoxification for your brother’s poison,” Qi Jin sighed.</p>
<p>However, this was contrary to what Ye Zhen wished for. Therefore, at this time, Ye Zhen only thought of finding a way to make Huangfu Chen unable to detoxify Lu Lingzhi. Because all she wanted right now was to see Lu Lingzhi living in pain all his life.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, Yaoyao?” Qi Jin looked up when she didn’t respond despite her repeated calls only to find her in a daze</p>
<p>“Oh, Imperial Physician Qi!” Ye Zhen, shaken out of her thoughts, looked at Qi Jin who was calling out to her with a stiff expression.</p>
<p>Qi Jin did not mind her absent-mindedness from before. She only teasingly smiled and asked, “You’re thinking about how to help your brother?”</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, I came looking for you. I want you to help me with one thing,” she said with a low voice, “I want to go to Huaijiang with you.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, what did you just say?” Qi Jin asked, wondering if she had heard it wrong.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen repeated her words solemnly, “I want to go to Huaijiang with you.”</p>
<p>Qi Jin immediately shook her head and rejected. “No! Neither Empress Dowager nor Emperor will agree to this.”</p>
