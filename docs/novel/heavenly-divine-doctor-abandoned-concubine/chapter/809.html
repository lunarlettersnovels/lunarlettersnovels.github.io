            <p><strong>Chapter 522 – Little Sister</strong></p>
<p>Mu Xue covered the wound on the wrist and was on her way to report to her sister Mu Qing when she met Zhao Mingxiao.</p>
<p>“Who hurt you?” Zhao Mingxiao frowned as he looked at her wrist. Everybody on the island knew that she was his wife’s sister. Who would dare to hurt her?</p>
<p>Seeing her handsome and elegant brother-in-law, Mu Xue’s grievance exploded. “Brother-in-law, oooh, you have to help me out in this matter. Lu Yaoyao is too much of a bully. She even snatched away the Cang Ying that Ye Shi gave me!”</p>
<p>A masked man standing behind Zhao Mingxiao asked in a hoarse voice, “Why would she want to steal your Cang Ying?”</p>
<p>“How would I know? Uncle Ye, can you help me get my Cang Ying back?” Mu Xue cried out.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao’s tone turned cold. “She stole your dagger, you should go and get it yourself.”</p>
<p>“Second Young Master always comes to her aid,” Mu Xue said aggrievedly.</p>
<p>“Why would Tianji help her?” Zhao Mingxiao snorted coldly. “Why were you looking for Lu Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>Mu Xue looked at him hesitantly. She couldn’t say that her sister wanted to see her else Eldest Young Master would definitely be furious. “I wanted her to treat my sister.”</p>
<p>Zhao Ming Xiao’s face darkened. “Why would you look for her to treat Mu Qing?”</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law, I’ve seen her medical skills. She was the one who cured the plague in Huaijiang City, and she is even more powerful than Huangfu Chen, so… So I think she should be able to cure my sister,” Mu Xue said.</p>
<p>Hearing the name that he didn’t want to hear the most in his life, Zhao Mingxiao’s eyes frosted over. “I will naturally find a doctor to cure your sister’s illness, I don’t need outsiders to treat her.”</p>
<p>Mu Xue wanted to say that Lu Yaoyao could even cure Second Young Master’s legs, so how could she not cure her sister’s illness, but because he had explicitly instructed her not to tell anyone that he could walk, she could only endure it. “Brother-in-law, my sister wants to be cured as soon as possible. She wants to have a baby for you.”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao’s expression softened slightly. “Lu Yaoyao isn’t willing to treat your sister?”</p>
<p>“<em>Hmph</em>, she acts like she’s a princess. She doesn’t want to condescend to see my sister,” Mu Xue sneered.</p>
<p>“Did she really think she is an honored guest on Zhao Jia Island?” Zhao Mingxiao roared. “Go and tell Second Young Master and have him handle it.”</p>
<p>Ye Shi, who was standing behind Zhao Mingxiao, said in a low voice, “Let me go and seek her out briefly. I’ll also help Mu Xue bring back Cang Ying.”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao considered for a while and looked back at him. “Then go.”</p>
<p>A glint of joy flashed through Mu Xue’s eyes. Ye Shi’s martial arts skills were high and he was extremely good to her. She was certain he would teach Lu Yaoyao a lesson.</p>
<p>“Mu Xue, let me bandage your wound.” Ye Shi looked at her hand. He had heard that Lu Yaoyao was Lu Lingzhi’s sister. And since the empress dowager was fond of her, she was bestowed the title of Princess. He wanted to see this woman. <em>What kind of person could make Mo Rongzhan crown her Princess?</em></p>
<p>“Good.” Mu Xue smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Ye Shi sent someone to fetch medicine and a white cloth to bandage Mu Xue’s wound. Zhao Mingxiao had already left. He had more important things to do. The person who he had thought would never appear again in this life had reappeared. He had to take care of some things.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Mu Xue touched her bandaged hand and looked at the retreating figure of Ye Shi. She smiled proudly and turned to look for Mu Qing.</p>
<p>Ye Shi had already gone to find Ye Zhen. Apart from taking revenge for Mu Xue, he also had to take back Cang Ying. Although Lu Yaoyao might not know who Ye Shi was, nor could she recognize the original owner of Cang Ying, he was still worried because her identity was extraordinary. If she took the dagger back to Jin Country, his identity would be exposed.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that Mu Xue would definitely come back to look for her to retrieve the dagger. After Huangfu Chen left, she toyed with the blade in her hands. When she was young, she had played with Cang Ying like this. This was the Ye family’s short sword*, so she could tell with certainty whether it was real or fake.</p>
<p>[*the word can mean dagger and short sword, so we’re using it interchangeably]</p>
<p><em>Was the Ye Shi on the island really Ye Yisong?</em></p>
<p>If the Ye Family had not been executed… She didn’t know what the situation was, but she had never liked her eldest uncle. He had done too many bad things.</p>
<p>At this point, she suddenly thought of Mo Rongzhan. Her mind also wandered off to Ye Yaoyao, on whom he was lavishing attention. She felt her heart constrict, but she could not exactly say what she was feeling.</p>
<p><em>How could he trust Lu Lingzhi so easily? Even if it’s Ye Yaoyao… But it isn’t Yaoyao.</em></p>
<p>Her identity and pseudonym could both be found in the lines of a famous poem.</p>
<p><em><strong>The peach tree is young and elegant; luxuriant are its leaves.</strong></em></p>
<p>Young girls were associated with peaches, ‘Yaoyao’ meant ‘young and elegant’, ‘Ye’ was the leaf, and ‘Zhen’ the luxuriance. Everything was there in the open. And yet he was so unwilling to accept…</p>
<p><em>Why wouldn’t he accept that it was Ye Zhen who had saved him?</em></p>
<p>While she was immersed deep in thoughts, Ye Shi had arrived behind her. The first thing he noticed was the Cang Yang in her hands. Seeing how she was staring at it so intently, he felt that she could actually discern its origin. He narrowed his eyes and immediately took to the air, reaching out he snatched the dagger.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had recollected herself just as Ye Shi soared into the air. Even so, she was a beat too slow and only had time to shoot an arrow. The silver arrow simply grazed over his shoulder.</p>
<p>By now, Ye Shi had already snatched Cang Yang away. He had originally planned to use it to hurt Lu Yaoyao to vent out for Mu Xue, but when he saw the little girl’s face before him, he was stunned.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao?” Ye Shi exclaimed in surprise. “You’re not dead, why are you here?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was equally shocked. She looked at this masked man and though she couldn’t see his face, she could recognize his voice.</p>
<p><em>Ye Chunming!</em></p>
<p>He was not Ye Shi, he was her eldest cousin, Ye Yisong’s son Ye Chunming.</p>
<p>“You… Who are you? Why do you know me?”</p>
<p>The words Eldest Brother* were at the tip of her tongue when she suddenly remembered that she was Lu Yaoyao, not Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>[*Since it’s a joint family, though YZ and YC are technically cousins, like Lu Lingzhi, he holds the title of the “eldest son” of the family and as such is addressed as eldest brother and not eldest cousin. Just a heads up, YZ will be his little sister.]</p>
<p>Ye Chunming took a few steps closer to her. “Yaoyao, I’m your eldest brother. How did you become Lu Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“I’m Yaoyao, I’ve never seen you before. You’re not my eldest brother. My eldest brother is Lu Lingzhi,” Ye Zhen said seriously.</p>
<p><em>How is Ye Chunming still alive? How could he be on Zhao Jia Island?</em> She had too many questions in her heart, but now she could not ask them.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming finally realized the difference in the woman in front of him. It was impossible for his little sister to still be alive. When he had escaped from the capital, he had personally witnessed the Qin Manor’s fire. His little cousin was already dead.</p>
<p>“You’re Lu Yaoyao?” The surprise in Ye Chunming’s eyes gradually disappeared. <em>If she is from the Lu family, why does she look exactly like Ye Zhen?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded lightly. “That’s right.”</p>
<p>“Did you live in the capital when you were young?” Ye Chunming asked again.</p>
<p>Two people could look alike in this world, but they couldn’t be so similar that they were practically the same.</p>
<p>“No, I’ve always lived in the border town. Who are you? How did you know I am called Yaoyao?” Ye Zhen pretended to be puzzled and asked.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming dropped his voice to a whisper and asked, “Are you really Lu Shiming’s biological daughter?”</p>
