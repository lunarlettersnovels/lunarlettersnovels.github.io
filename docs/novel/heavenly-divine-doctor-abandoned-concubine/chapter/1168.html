            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 159 – When A Woman Gets Jealous (1)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cining Palace</strong></p>
<p>After Ye Zhen left, Lu Wushuang talked to the empress dowager earnestly, hoping to earn her affection. However, after a while, Princess Royal and Liu Hua requested an audience.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8">
<div class="orp-player-wrapper orp-aspectRateFixed orp-player-ipm orp-player-ipm-hidden" data-hidden="false">
<div class="orp-light-player-wrapper">
<div class="orp-player-iframe">
<div class="orp-light-player-wrapper orp-isInit orp-notMobile orp-init-loading"></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>With the sudden intrusion, Lu Wushuang’s smile froze, and she turned to look at the empress dowager with a grim face.</p>
<p>However, the empress dowager did not seem to notice her disdain, for she gladly invited the unexpected guests to come in.</p>
<p>Princess Royal had just been enraged by Ye Zhen, so when she came to Cining Palace and saw the Lu Family, her dissatisfaction heightened. She made a hasty curtsy to the empress dowager, which seemed disrespectful.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unlike her mother, Liu Hua bowed before the empress dowager. She knew that she would have to rely on her when she entered the palace as a concubine. Hence, as early as now, she had to get her approval.</p>
<p>Still, no matter how they hid it, their faces showed their unhappiness. As such, the empress dowager felt suspicious.</p>
<p>“Princess Royal, please sit down. There is no need for formality in this palace.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu stood up and gave the guests a sincere curtsy, but this act was returned with a sneer.</p>
<p>“I can’t stand the presence of the Lu Family.” Princess Royal complained without holding back.</p>
<p>The empress dowager frowned and said, “Princess Royal, what’s the matter with you? Old Madam Lu has not offended you.” She gave an apologetic look at the old madam.</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager, you must know this. When we were on our way here, we met Lu Yaoyao. She knocked me down to the ground and also disrespected my mother.” Liu Hua reported bitterly.</p>
<p>Her heart ached with envy at the thought that the emperor stayed in the imperial garden with Lu Yaoyao alone.</p>
<p>“Have you met Yaoyao?” the empress dowager asked, a cheerful smile crept slowly on her face. “Yaoyao, that child is very clever and respectful. How could she possibly disrespect you?”</p>
<p>Princess Royal chuckled and gave Lu Wushuang a squinted gaze. “That miss of the Lu Family is not as harmless as she pretends to be. Not only did the little prince reprimand me despite being an aunt, but even the emperor became involved in her scheme!”</p>
<p>At the mention of the emperor, Lu Wushuang gloomily spoke. “Princess Royal, the emperor is in his imperial study. How come he met Yaoyao?” She looked at the princess with hopeful eyes and a doubtful heart.</p>
<p>“It seems that Wang Fei Lu doesn’t know much about her sister, either! Third Miss Lu is very skillful. She must have known that the emperor was outside and deliberately allowed herself to fall into the nearby lotus pond so that the emperor, bless him for his kind heart, could save her from falling.”</p>
<p>With such news, fear and anger filled Lu Wushuang’s heart instantly.</p>
<p>“I am deeply sorry to say this, but I think that you, Wang Fei, deserve to know.” Princess Royal remarked cleverly.</p>
<p>While Lu Yaoyao was away, she must first provoke the feelings of Lu Wushuang so that she turns a blind eye to her daughter Liu Hua in the future.</p>
<p>The empress dowager, who listened solemnly, couldn’t believe Princess Royal. She always had a good eye for people, and Lu Yaoyao didn’t strike her as the kind of girl who would seduce the emperor to uphold her status.</p>
<p>But seeing Princess Royal and her daughter so upset, she began to have qualms.</p>
<p><i>I have only met the little girl. </i></p>
<p>However, Lu Wushuang was not as calm as the empress dowager. She had been provoked by Princess Royal before, and none of it was false. Therefore, she believed that Lu Yaoyao was really seducing the emperor behind her back. She suddenly stood up. “Empress Dowager, I have something to do. Please allow this wang fei to leave.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager knew that Lu Wushuang believed Princess Royal and wrath filled her senses. Hence, she urged her to stay and talk things out.</p>
<p><i>Don’t be too impulsive and let yourself be tricked,</i> she wanted to say but couldn’t in the presence of Princess Royal.</p>
<p>“How important is it that you must leave our little reunion here? It’s better to do it later, Wang Fei.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang couldn’t wait to find Lu Yaoyao right away. The thought of her meeting Mo Rongzhan and seducing him… She couldn’t sit still in the Cining Palace!</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager, Grandmother, and Princess Royal, things are rather urgent. I will come back as soon as I finish,” Lu Wushuang said despite Old Madam Lu’s objection. She already stood up and left in haste.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu didn’t know where her granddaughter would go. She believed Lu Yaoyao wouldn’t do anything like that. However, the wang fei left in such a hurry that even if Lu Yaoyao didn’t do anything, others would think otherwise.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang storming out of the Cining Palace would surely instigate speculations. Old Madam felt like she was set to have a heart attack anytime soon.</p>
<p>The empress dowager gestured to Aunt Cheng, who immediately understood the order and hurriedly followed Lu Wushuang outside.</p>
<p>With pride in her heart, Princess Royal watched the scene, the corners of her mouth twitched into a benevolent smile.</p>
<p>Even if Ye Zhen had slipped from her grasp a while ago, at least she was able to start a feud between the two cousins.</p>
