            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 287 – Gossip Kills (2)</strong></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu didn’t expect to see her granddaughter, least of all here … As if the mother-pair wasn’t enough, now even her granddaughter got thrown into the melee. But things were so, she couldn’t quibble now, could she? In a low voice, she explained her reason for entering the palace.</p>
<p>“What?” Lu Wushuang’s delicate and beautiful eyes looked at Liu Hua. “How could such a thing happen?”</p>
<p><em>Liu Hua … This useless person! If she really wanted to do something to Lu Yaoyao, why didn’t she find some better men to do the job? If something happened to Lu Yaoyao, then it’s killing two birds with one stone, getting rid of two thorns on my side at the same time.</em></p>
<p>“The truth of the matter has yet to be determined. How can you surely know that Liu Hua ordered it? Old Madam Lu, you should be careful. A loose tongue may cause a lot of trouble,” Princess Royal said coldly.</p>
<p>“Either way, I believe the emperor will find out,” Old Madam Lu said faintly. She wasn’t someone easily threatened.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang snorted coldly. “At the foot of the Son of Heaven, there is unexpectedly such a matter when one’s eyes are above one’s head. Apparently, in the eyes of many people, our Lu Family can be bullied as pleased.”</p>
<p>“What is your Lu Family!” Liu Hua glanced at Lu Wushuang contemptuously.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang was about to get angry but was stopped right on time by Old Madam Lu’s meaningful glance. She immediately changed her course and pitifully looked towards the empress dowager. “Yes, our Lu Family naturally cannot compare with Princess Royal’s. We cannot act as we please, let alone show no reverence to the emperor and Her Imperial Highness.”</p>
<p>Princess Royal’s eyes sank. “Wang Fei Lu, when did we ever ignore the emperor and the empress dowager?”</p>
<p>“If one still highly regards the emperor and the empress dowager, how can one try to abduct a girl in broad daylight? Fortunately, Yaoyao is fine. But what about her reputation?” Lu Wushuang wanted to ruin Ye Zhen’s reputation. In a way she was hinting at the idiot mother-daughter pair right now.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu’s countenance slightly changed. How could she not know what her granddaughter was up to? Under the dismal influence of her hatred for her cousin, she knew not what was right or wrong.</p>
<p>The empress dowager said in a heavy voice, “When those bandits appeared, Mister Chen happened to pass by. Although Yaoyao was not hurt at all, she was scared. How can there be damage to her reputation?”</p>
<p>Liu Hua immediately nodded. “Yes, she is fine.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang snorted coldly in her heart. <em>As expected, Empress Dowager still favors Lu Yaoyao!</em> “I’m just worried about what the people would say.”</p>
<p>“It depends on who dares to talk nonsense,” said the empress dowager coldly.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang was shocked by the empress dowager’s cold and bold tone. She pursed her lips and said nothing more.</p>
<p>Princess Royal stood up and said, “Empress Dowager, this princess shall take her leave.”</p>
<p>Liu Hua also stood up after her mother, glaring at Lu Wushuang. She was reluctant to leave because she had not even been able to glimpse the emperor yet.</p>
<p>The empress dowager said faintly, “Then Aijia shall not keep.”</p>
<p>Not long after the troublemakers departed, Old Madam Lu took her leave.</p>
<p>“This matter shall not be ignored by Aijia. By all means possible, justice shall be served to the Lu Family. After she has rested, have Yaoyao visit the palace and come before Aijia. I haven’t seen her for a few days, but I feel that I miss her again,” the empress dowager smiled and said to Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>“Very well, Your Imperial Highness.” Old Madam Lu nodded with a smile. She didn’t expect for Empress Dowager to be this cold to Princess Royal. After all, it was Princess Royal who made others feel inferior to her. This time, the young misses of the Lu Family were not to be bullied by anyone as they pleased.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang left the Cining Palace along with Old Madam Lu. “Grandmother, is Yaoyao okay?”</p>
<p>“Many thanks to Her Highness’s concern. Yaoyao was just scared but nothing serious happened to her,” Old Madam Lu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“It’s not good to let Yaoyao go to the academy after such an incident. Grandmother, it would be better to have Second Uncle take her to Jinkou City with him,” Lu Wushuang said in an unyielding tone.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu smiled faintly. “Your Highness, Yaoyao is doing well at the academy. Besides, her parents are in the capital, so there is no reason to send her to Jinkou City.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother—” Lu Wushuang looked at the old madam with seemingly probing eyes. “Do you intend to send Yaoyao to the palace in the future?”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was so angry that her chest swelled. “Wang Fei must be worried.”</p>
