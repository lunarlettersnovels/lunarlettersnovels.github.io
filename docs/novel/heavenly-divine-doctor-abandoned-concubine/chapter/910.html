<p><strong>Chapter 419 – The Willful Emperor (1)</strong></p>
<p>Though Mo Rongzhan had just woken up, he was full of energy. Ye Zhen had mixed innumerable drops of <em>lingquan</em> over his wounds. Those drops directly entered his bloodflow, and washed his entire body anew. Afterwards, she had also fed him some water infused with <em>it</em>. Now, the only thing uncomfortable was his open wounds. Everything else was fine.</p>
<p>“Bring me all of the court memorials from the past two days.” Mo Rongzhan ordered Eunuch Fu.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu was taken aback. “Your Majesty, you are going to read the court memorials?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was already angry. He looked at the other coldly.</p>
<p>“I’ll do that right away.” Seeing the emperor filled with fury, he didn’t dare to ask any more questions, immediately running to the front hall to gather the court memorials piled up from the past two days.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan wanted to leave the bed but was caught by Huangfu Chen, who was just walking in. Upon seeing him so, he exclaimed, “Are you not afraid of your wounds reopening?”</p>
<p>“I already feel much better,” Mo Rongzhan said flatly.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen flicked his eyebrow. “Looks like you’re not in a good mood. Where’s Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>He was answered with a sour expression on Mo Rongzhan’s face.</p>
<p>“It looks like you aren’t getting along too well with Yaoyao.” Huangfu Chen shook his head and smiled. “You were willing to give up your own life to save her. How is it that you don’t even know how to please her?”</p>
<p>“Do you think that I saved her so she would repay me with her hand?” Mo Rongzhan asked coldly.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled and shook his head, saying, “I know you didn’t.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had saved Yaoyao without any thoughts of her repaying him. At that time, he himself had not expected that he would leap over with no regard for his own life.</p>
<p>“What do you plan on doing next?” Huangfu Chen asked. Feelings were hard to understand for those not involved. But he didn’t hold any hopes for those between Mo Rongzhan and Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>There was a knot in Yaoyao’s heart, and no one could undo it. If she was unable to put it down, she would never give her heart to any other person.</p>
<p>He had experience and could see very clearly.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan flatly said, “Drive the snake out of the hole. Slash the grass and remove the roots*.”</p>
<p>[*Lure your enemy out of hiding. Exterminate all possible threats.]</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen was not overly concerned about Mo Rongzhan’s solution to the situation that was currently brewing in the capital. He believed that those who opposed him would not get a good result. After all, the overall situation of the empire had already been decided and the commoners were very supportive of him as the new emperor. This was the stablest the empire had been for the longest time in recent decades.</p>
<p>It was only those delusional imperial clan members and noble families, who looked down upon Mo Rongzhan as well as feared that their interests would be affected, that supported the orthodoxy and wanted to restore the deposed emperor. And that was why they were in a hurry to support the rise of an emperor – one who would benefit them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was not very useful.</p>
<p>“Your wound is healing much better than I expected.” Huangfu Chen looked at Mo Rongzhan and said, “Yaoyao did a good job with your treatment in the hunting grounds at that time. If she hadn’t stopped the bleeding for you, you would have been hopeless.”</p>
<p>At the mention of Ye Zhen, Mo Rongzhan’s eyes darkened and his thin lips pursed into one straight line.</p>
<p>“She kept a watch over you for two whole days and no one advised her not to leave.” Huangfu Chen sighed. “Did you say something to frighten her?”</p>
<p>At once Mo Rongzhan’s initially suppressed anger erupted out of him like a volcano. “What could zhen say to frighten her? Zhen wants to take her as Empress, yet she remains unmoved, and for Ye Zhen’s sake… she has distanced herself from zhen in all respects. Since she is so ruthless, there is no need for zhen to seek her again.”</p>
<p>“——” Huangfu Chen did not know how to console this willful emperor. Although Mo Rongzhan was born a prince, he had not been favored by the former emperor from a young age. In fact, he had even lived a life that was worse than the palace servants. He fought for everything he had, becoming well-versed in strategies to get what he wanted by carefully orchestrating every step. The only thing he didn’t learn was love.</p>
<p>An emperor who didn’t know how to love had his heart moved. Yet, he didn’t know how to make his beloved respond to his feelings. He thought that this matter was the same as everything else in the past, as long as he wanted it, he would be able to get it.</p>
<p>The rarest thing in the world is one’s sincere heart.</p>
<p>“Ah Zhan, in the event that Yaoyao becomes your empress, how will you face her if Ye Yiqing comes back in the future?” Huangfu Chen asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s complexion turned cold and he stared at the other,.“It’s impossible for Ye Yiqing to come back.”</p>
<p>“If I were Ye Yiqing…,” Huangfu Chen raised his eyes and looked at Mo Rongzhan and said, “so long as I live, I will most certainly come back to avenge my daughter.”</p>
<p>“You mean… for Ye Zhen?” Mo Rongzhan knitted his brows in confusion. Ye Yiqing’s identity was still that of a death-row criminal. Since that was the case, what kind of identity is he going to use to come back?</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said, “The person might be worthless in your eyes, but they are the rarest treasure in the world in Ye Yiqing’s heart.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan went silent for a long time before he said in a deep voice, “Ye Zhen is dead. She killed herself—”</p>
