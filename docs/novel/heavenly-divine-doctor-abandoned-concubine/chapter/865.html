            <p><strong>Chapter 465 – Let Me Have a Taste</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explicit scene ahead</strong></p>
<p>At her silence, Mo Rongzhan’s heart sank a bit. He forcefully sucked her lips, curled her tongue, and said,” Xiao Jiaojiao*, you’re so sweet.”</p>
<p>[*娇 jiāo= lovable; pampered; tender; delicate; frail]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen only had one hand free, she couldn’t push him even if she wanted to.</p>
<p>After he was somewhat eased, he relinquished her lips, lay on top of her, and panted. He was the emperor of a country and yet, for the sake of a little girl, he could not enjoy the sexual intimacy to his heart’s content. He still knew that he was willing to enjoy this kind of kiss and love with her. It was a hundred times more enjoyable than being with other women.</p>
<p>“Get up!” Ye Zhen endured the pain and did not even want to look at her sore hand.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, behave. In the future, no matter who talks to you about marriage, you are not allowed to agree. I don’t want to force you into the palace.” He took the initiative to leave her body and brought over a basin of water to help her wipe the marks he had left behind.</p>
<p>She cried out in a huff, “Aren’t you forcing me now?”</p>
<p>His deep eyes glowed as he looked at her and said in a low voice, “When I learned today that the empress dowager wanted to marry you off, I was very angry. There has never been a woman who has made me this worried or angry.”</p>
<p>In the past, he had found the stories of the warlords laughable. How could an emperor act so absurdly for a woman? Today, when he heard that she was going to marry another man, he was so angry that he wanted to kill all the men who coveted her. Wasn’t that ridiculous?</p>
<p>She wanted to say that she didn’t care about him at all, but she knew well the consequences of those words, so she tightly pursed her lips and said nothing.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I know that you are not willing to marry me, but you will be willing in the future,” he kissed her cheek. “Don’t hide from me anymore.”</p>
<p>“Then keep your word. Don’t come to the Lu family again,” she whispered.</p>
<p>He chuckled. “Then what should I do if I miss you?”</p>
<p>This bastard was completely different from what she knew in the past. How could she not have known he was such a scoundrel!</p>
<p>“I don’t miss you.” She snorted.</p>
<p>“Call me again.” He didn’t know how to care for such a delicate and soft person. It was as if every time he interacted with her, she would burrow herself in his heart even deeper.</p>
<p>She was a kind person. “Your Majesty, please respect yourself.”</p>
<p>“Xuan Hao,” he said… What he wanted her to call him.</p>
<p>“How can I call you by your name?” She asked. Whether it was before or now, it was the first time she knew his name was Xuan Hao.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan let out a long sigh in his heart. She still refused to open her heart to accept him. “Yaoyao…,” he called her in a low voice.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen avoided his gaze and said in a somewhat anxious voice, “Why aren’t you going back? What if someone finds out?”</p>
<p>“I won’t leave. It would be better if they found out. I will issue a decree tomorrow to make you Empress.” He lay beside her, looking every bit like a scoundrel.</p>
<p>“No, hurry up and leave!” She was really anxious now. She sat up to push him.</p>
<p>The thin blanket on her body slid down to her waist, and her chest felt a chill. It was only then that she remembered that she wasn’t wearing anything. She cried out in surprise and hastily grabbed the blanket to cover up.</p>
<p>How could Mo Rongzhan let go of such an opportunity? He pounced on her with lightning speed, and his large hand tore the blanket away.</p>
<p>She did not know how to stay still under his deep and dark gaze.</p>
<p>“Don’t…,” she cried. She felt weird and afraid.</p>
<p>“Let me have a taste…,” he said, his voice low and hoarse.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what he was going to do. She couldn’t help but cry. “Mo Rongzhan, Mo Rongzhan, hurry up and leave. Don’t do this. I feel uncomfortable~”</p>
<p>“Where do you feel uncomfortable?” He smiled.</p>
<p>She couldn’t tell where she was feeling uncomfortable. It felt as if it had spread from the depths of her body to her limbs. Her entire body was numb, to the point that she had no strength left.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes were a deep red. He never knew he had such restraint, that he could actually manage to hold back from wanting her</p>
<p>His hot breath brushed between her legs. She was so frightened that her words stuttered, “What are you… you going to do?”</p>
<p>What answered her was his ragged breathing.</p>
