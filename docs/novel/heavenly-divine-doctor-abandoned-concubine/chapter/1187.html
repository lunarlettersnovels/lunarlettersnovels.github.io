            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 140 – Unspeakable Truths (1)</strong></p>
<p>When Lu Lingzhi was still in the palace, he heard that the wang fei had summoned Lu Yaoyao to the palace the next day. He frowned and glanced at Tang Zhen beside him.</p>
<p>“You should leave the palace first. I have something to ask my sister, the wang fei.”</p>
<p>Understanding this as a personal matter, Tang Zhen nodded and asked no more about it. But, in his inquisitive nature, he carried on pestering his friend about his injury.</p>
<p>“Wait, do you really want to go out with troops? Your injury hasn’t healed yet!”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao gave me medicine and it is much better now,” Lu Lingzhi said in a cheerful tone that he didn’t even realize he was capable of.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao’s medicine?” Tang Zhen said with envy, “Isn’t she not so fond of you, Eldest Brother?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi gave him a lingering look. “I am her eldest brother, and even if I said a few hurtful words to her, she will not hold a grudge against me forever.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Tang Zhen rolled his eyes, automatically ignoring Lu Lingzhi’s flaunting. <i>When will Ye Zhen be affectionate to him?</i> He wondered. If<i> she were to give him medicine, he would be very much elated. </i></p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to visit the wang fei? Changed your mind?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi smiled. “See you later.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was still in his imperial study when he came to know of Lu Lingzhi’s sudden request to visit his sister. Immediately, he ordered his subordinates dully. “Let’s postpone my visit to the wang fei.”</p>
<p>Then a smile crept up his face.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Wasting no time, Lu Lingzhi hurried to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility where his sister resides. Lu Wushuang was already waiting for him inside. Her beautiful face was painted with a delicate rogue. “Eldest Brother, why did you suddenly want to see me?”</p>
<p>“I have something to discuss with Wang Fei.” Lu Lingzhi curtsied and looked grim.</p>
<p>“Please sit down quickly.” Lu Wushuang laughed at his formality. “You and I, brother and sister, are slowly becoming strangers now. We should see each other more often.”</p>
<p>At that, Lu Lingzhi shook his head in disagreement. “The wang fei and this assistant war minister differ greatly in the noble ranking. My sister’s status now is high and she needs to adapt to it.”</p>
<p>“My identity has indeed become different but this isolation, I can’t stand.” Lu Wushunag gave a wry smile. “Anyway, Eldest Brother, what can I do for you?”</p>
<p>“I heard that Wang Fei has summoned her third sister tomorrow?” Lu Lingzhi asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang frowned slightly and said crossly, “Is it for this reason that Eldest Brother sought to visit my palace? I just heard Third Sister got into the academy and won great honor for our Lu Family, so I asked her to come into this very palace, to give her something! What’s wrong with this?”</p>
<p>“Wang Fei seems to be in a bad mood today.” Lu Lingzhi gazed at Lu Wushuang’s eyes ablaze with anger.</p>
<p>In return, Lu Wushuang became deeply irritated with the familiar scrutiny.  “I heard that some courtiers wanted the emperor to expand the harem. The empress dowager told me yesterday that she wanted the emperor to accept Princess Liu Hua into the palace. Eldest Brother, it has only been a few days since I became the wang fei! Few days!”</p>
<p>Slowly, Lu Wushuang’s face contorted into a hateful, sinister look—a look that Lu Lingzhi had seen hundreds of times before. This was the reason why he came to talk to her today.</p>
<p>“Can’t they see that I am favored by the emperor? But ah yes! The emperor has not been here for several days and must have already been seduced by some wench!”</p>
<p>“The emperor is the sovereign of this country. He can’t have you as his only concubine! It is inevitable for him to expand the harem. Why are you angry about this? Besides, you will always be special in the emperor’s heart.” Lu Lingzhi whispered.</p>
<p>Losing her cool completely, Lu Wushuang’s voice broke and cried. “How different, because… because of our mutual affection? Or, is it only because of how he recognizes me?”</p>
<p>“Sister, be careful.” Lu Lingzhi warned her, his eyes dark.</p>
<p>Some things couldn’t be said, otherwise, it would lead to disaster, especially about this matter. The brother and sister both knew exactly who saved the emperor.</p>
<p>“I thought I could… could…”</p>
<p>She shook her head and knew that she had been right—Mo Rongzhan didn’t adore her like he used to anymore.</p>
