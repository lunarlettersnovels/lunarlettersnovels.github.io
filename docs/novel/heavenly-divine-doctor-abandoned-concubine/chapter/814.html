            <p><strong>Chapter 517 – A Small Country</strong></p>
<p>Along the way, although Ye Zhen sat in the carriage, she was stunned by the bustling scene outside. How did this Zhao Jia Island do it? To be able to turn a small island into a prosperous city like the capital of Jin Country was completely different from what she had imagined.</p>
<p>“It’s been a few years since I came back to Zhao Jia Island. It’s different.” Zhao Tianji sighed.</p>
<p>“Then… Who did all this?” she asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji said, “Although there were market places in the past, merchants from other places weren’t allowed to enter. Now, there are all kinds of foreigners. Well, Eldest Brother is more suitable to be the master of the island. Under his leadership, Zhao Jia Island has turned into a small country.”</p>
<p><em>Is this because of Zhao Mingxiao?</em> Ye Zhen was even more shocked. It seemed that this person really wasn’t simple.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen frowned, one couldn’t tell what he was thinking.</p>
<p>After a while, the carriage gradually stopped. Liang Yin’s voice sounded outside. “Island Lord, we’re here.”</p>
<p>If the previous bustling scene had surprised Ye Zhen, then the palace-like buildings that she saw now had completely rendered her speechless.</p>
<p>“Did Eldest Brother turn the old residence into a palace?” Zhao Tianji turned around and asked Yuan Cheng.</p>
<p>Yuan Cheng replied in a low voice, “It was only built half a year ago. Eldest Young Master said that it would be suitable for you to live here as the Island Lord.”</p>
<p><em>An island lord needed to live in a palatial building befitting his identity? </em>Ye Zhen turned to look at Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji laughed and looked at the palace in front of him. Although it could not be compared to a real palace, it was still more imposing than the old mansion. “Where is Eldest Brother?”</p>
<p>“Eldest Young Master is very happy to know that you are back. He is waiting for you inside,” Yuan Cheng said respectfully.</p>
<p>“Let’s go in!” Zhao Tianji said.</p>
<p>It seemed that although his brother was weak, he was still stronger than him in some aspects. Had he been in charge of this island, it would not be as prosperous as it is today.</p>
<p>Yuan Cheng looked at Huangfu Chen warily and asked, “Island Lord, are you bringing outsiders into the palace? It’s not good.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji said indifferently, “There are no outsiders here.”</p>
<p><em>Isn’t Huangfu Chen an outsider?</em> Yuan Cheng thought to himself. He didn’t understand why his master had brought Huangfu Chen back. <em>Was the lesson from a few years ago not enough?</em></p>
<p>Liang Yin pushed the wheelchair through the door. This character called Zhao Tianji was lost on Ye Zhen. While on the boat, he had not used the wheelchair once. <em>So why was he being pushed around in one when he returned to Zhao Jia Island?</em></p>
<p>Huangfu Chen walked by Yuan Cheng indifferently, gesturing for Ye Zhen to follow. Yuan Cheng frowned and motioned for the guards to close the door as he looked at <em>the outsider’s</em> departing figure.</p>
<p>Yellow tiles and red walls. The specifications of this mansion were exactly the same as the imperial palace. Ye Zhen even felt that she was walking in the palace and not in Zhao Jia Island.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen saw the main hall in front of her after passing through the long red wall alley. Several figures stood on the stone steps of the main hall. A handsome and elegant young man stood in the foreground. He gave a friendly smile to Zhao Tianji who was being wheeled in. Then he took a slow look around at the others. When his gaze was drawn to Huangfu Chen, the smile on his face faded.</p>
<p><em>Huangfu Chen? Why is he here?</em></p>
<p>“Eldest Brother.” Zhao Tianji had already arrived at the bottom of the stone steps. He looked at the handsome young man with a smile. “It’s only been a few years since I came back and I almost couldn’t recognize that this was our old house.”</p>
<p>This young man was Zhao Tianji’s big brother, Zhao Mingxiao!</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao slowly walked down the stone steps. A smile appeared on the corners of his mouth once again. “Every year, I ask for you to come back to take a look, but youalways refuse. How dare you say such words?”</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, you look good. Looks like your illness has healed.” Seeing that Zhao Mingxiao’s face was no longer pale, Zhao Tianji was happy for him. “Fortunately, A-Chen cured you back then.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Huangfu Chen’s name, a chill flashed across Zhao Mingxiao’s eyes. “Tianji, why did you bring our enemies to Zhao Jia Island? Are you trying to capture him to make amends for the islanders who died back then?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji said, “Eldest Brother, what happened back then had nothing to do with A-Chen. Someone deliberately framed him.”</p>
<p>“We’ve lost so many islanders. Could  we wipe out his crime simply by saying nothing?” Zhao Mingxiao’s face darkened as if he was unhappy that his brother was protecting his foe.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, if A-Chen really wanted to destroy our Zhao Jia Island, we wouldn’t be standing here right now.” Zhao Tianji whispered, “You know that a long time ago the Huangfu family suppressed our island—”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao obviously didn’t like hearing this. He said with a sullen face, “Could it be that because he belongs to the Huangfu family, he can sneak attack our Zhao Jia Island?”</p>
<p>“It looks like you don’t know my master very well. If my master wants to launch a sneak attack…,” Ye Zhen raised her eyebrows and indifferently swept a glance at Zhao Mingxiao and sai, “your Zhao Jia Island would already be as it was a hundred years ago. Not a single blade of grass would grow, and human beings would disappear. Do you still want to frame my master here?”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Zhao Mingxiao looked at this beautiful woman and became more and more unhappy with the people Zhao Tianji had brought back.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said indifferently, “She is my apprentice, Young Master Zhao. I haven’t seen you in a long time. It seems… There are many misunderstandings between us.”</p>
<p>“There’s no misunderstanding between us. Huangfu Chen, Zhao Jia Island doesn’t welcome you. Please leave immediately,” Zhao Mingxiao said coldly.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, there’s no evidence to point to Huangfu Chen when we were ambushed. He left to find Mu Qing and was later seriously injured on Spirit Snake Island. I’ve already investigated this matter,” Zhao Tianji said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao gave him a disapproving look. He didn’t like his brother mentioning Mu Qing. “Tianji, haven’t you been deceived by him enough?”</p>
<p>“I know in my heart if he will lie to me or not.” Zhao Tianji said lightly, “Eldest Brother, I just returned today. Let’s not talk about this for now. We’ll find out who framed Huangfu Chen in the future.”</p>
<p>“You’re the master of the island. You have the final say.” Zhao Mingxiao said coldly, “Yuan Cheng, send the Island Lord back to his palace.”</p>
<p>Yuan Cheng replied in a low voice, “Island Lord, please.”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao looked at Huangfu Chen and said coldly, “Tianji, after all, the others are not people from our island and cannot live in the palace. I will have someone arrange another residence for them.”</p>
<p>“Brother, since they want to treat my legs, they can stay in my courtyard,” Zhao Tianji said.</p>
<p>“Heal your legs?” Zhao Mingxiao raised his eyebrows and looked down at his brother’s legs. “Can they heal your legs?”</p>
<p>Mu Xue was standing beside Zhao Tianji all along. She wanted to say that the Second Young Master was able to walk, however, before she could open her mouth, Zhao Tianji had already said with a smile, “Although I can’t walk yet, I have improved.”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao’s expression softened slightly. “Then I’ll do as you say. However, even if they can cure your legs, I won’t let that matter go.”</p>
