            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 162 – A Time For Retribution</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen left with Aunt Cheng. Her cheek was still burning, but, contrary to what one might expect, she felt no anger. Lu Wushuang’s slap led to fruitful results.</p>
<p>Sometimes, appearing weak and defenseless could be beneficial.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang acted headstrong and unruly in front of Mo Rongzhan, which would definitely make him doubt the wang fei even more.</p>
<p>However, Ye Zhen received the slap, but not with the intention of gaining sympathy from Mo Rongzhan. No, Ye Zhen wanted to go back to the Lu Family with her swollen cheek, so that both Old Madam Lu and Lu Lingzhi would know that she had been wronged in the palace.</p>
<p>She had now been able to get along with Lu Lingzhi calmly and rationally and act as his cousin very well. Before today’s events, Ye Zhen had never understood the truth so clearly.</p>
<p>If she wanted revenge, the only thing she could rely on for the time being was the Lu Family and Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>With Lu Lingzhi’s position in the court and the Lu Family’s sudden rise to nobility, she could go further and get everything she wanted.</p>
<p><i>Didn’t Lu Lingzhi do the same thing to her when she still lived in her previous body?</i></p>
<p>He disguised himself so well that he cheated her of her trust. At the last moment, he took away her most precious jade pendant and dealt her a fatal blow.</p>
<p>She learned from his methods—she would gain Lu Lingzhi’s affection as his cousin, and at the last moment, flash her sword against his very eyes.</p>
<p>As for how to get Lu Lingzhi’s trust and favor, it would start with Lu Wushuang’s slap on her face.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang got her present status only because of Lu Lingzhi’s love, so he took away what belonged to Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time for Ye Zhen’s retribution. She would take away Lu Wushuang’s most precious things bit by bit.</p>
<p>“Aunt Cheng, can you take me to wash my face first? I’m a little embarrassed to see the empress dowager in this state now.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt grateful to have entered the palace today; otherwise, she would not have such clear and profound consciousness.</p>
<p>After her rebirth, she was clueless about the things she must do and was reluctant to face Lu Wushuang, Lu Lingzhi, who became her family.</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng gave Ye Zhen a concerned look, and only then did she notice the red mark on her face. She nodded in haste. “Miss Lu, please follow this handmaiden.”</p>
<p>The handmaiden had seen Wang Fei Ye several times before. The beautiful wang fei was different from other misses in the Ye Family. Despite her high status, she was very kind to her servants. At that time, even though the empress dowager had a relatively low status in the palace, Ye Zhen secretly let people send things over to the empress dowager. She was very considerate and filial, not only as a daughter-in-law but as a person in general.</p>
<p>Therefore, the empress dowager always praised her and even mourned her death. The palace lost such a kind soul when the wang fei died.</p>
<p><i>If Wang Fei Ye were not born in the Ye Family, she would have lived a better life.</i> Aunt Cheng morosely thought.</p>
<p>The emperor’s scorn for the Ye Family was too deep; he refused to accept Ye Zhen in his life.</p>
<p>When the emperor, then a prince, had left for war, the empress dowager awaited his return. She intended to tell her son that Ye Zhen was not the unruly and willful woman he thought she was, but then, she never had the chance.</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng sighed painfully in her heart. <i>Surprisingly, Third Miss Lu doesn’t only look like Wang Fei Ye, but also bears similar temperament, which is much more decent than Lu Wushuang.</i></p>
<p>Aunt Cheng brought Ye Zhen into a vacant room and personally fetched her a basin of water and rouge. Ye Zhen then patted her cheek with the water and then put on a layer of makeup.</p>
<p>However, her skin was pearly white, and Lu Wushuang’s slap was full of might. No matter how she used the rouge to cover her face, she could not hide the swelling.</p>
<p>Of course, she didn’t want to cover it up but just wanted to show Aunt Cheng how much she wanted to avoid causing a ruckus by hiding the palm print.</p>
<p>Seeing her struggle, Aunt Cheng advised her. “Miss Lu, the empress dowager is still waiting for your return.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the elderly lady with some embarrassment and hesitantly put down the rouge. “Aunt Cheng, do I look ugly now?”</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng laughed, her heart softened at the innocent remark. “Miss Lu is naturally beautiful and not ugly in any way.”</p>
<p>“Really?” With raised brows and a generous smile, Ye Zhen immediately brightened up.</p>
<p>When she saw her swollen cheek, Aunt Cheng expected that Miss Lu would weep in front of the empress dowager and seek comfort from her grandmother. But instead, she washed her face in an attempt to conceal from everyone the proof of Wang Fei’s assault.</p>
<p>Lu Yaoyao surprised her with her rare and mature temperament.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, let’s go.” Aunt Cheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen patted her cheek, which was not that red anymore.</p>
<p>“All right, Aunt Cheng.”</p>
