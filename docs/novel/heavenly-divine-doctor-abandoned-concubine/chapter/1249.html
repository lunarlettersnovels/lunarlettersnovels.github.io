            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 78 – Losing Control (1)</h3>
<p>The imperial physician took his time tending to Lu Lingzhi’s fracture, giving Lu Xiangzhi, a known chatterbox, the room to relay to them how the accident took place.</p>
<p>This morning, when the men were out hunting, Lu Xiangzhi rode in the front. Out of the blue, his horse started to act wild as if it had seen something frightening and ran straight to the cliff!</p>
<p>It all happened too fast but before Lu Xiangzhi could fall down with his horse, and possibly break several bones in his body, he was pulled by Lu Lingzhi who was riding behind him.</p>
<p>He jumped off his horse and grabbed Lu Xiangzhi, catapulting both of them to the rocky side of the road. Both of them were fine, but the horse didn’t survive; Lu Xiangzhi hurt his hand and Lu Lingzhi’s leg was pitifully fractured.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Lu Lingzhi’s heroic act, Lu Xiangzhi would have been dead by now having fallen from the steep cliff.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, my mother has come to see you!” Lu Xiangzhi announced before he opened Lu Lingzhi’s door and let the ladies enter the parlor.</p>
<p>As if on cue, two imperial physicians with medicine boxes came out of Lu Lingzhi’s chambers. Lu Xiangzhi naturally asked them about his eldest brother’s condition in a hurry. He was relieved to learn that the injury was not as serious as he had dreaded.</p>
<p>“You still have to let your eldest brother take a good rest for at least a hundred days.” Pei Shi told her son sincerely.</p>
<p>Just then, another young man in dark purple robes came out. His eyes visibly lit up when he saw Ye Zhen. “Third Sister!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s sour mood plummeted even further while she looked up at him.</p>
<p>“Marquis Tang.” She greeted.</p>
<p>Only then did Tang Zhen notice the presence of Third Madam.</p>
<p>Afraid that he might appear rude by not acknowledging the presence of Lu Yaoyao’s mother, he quickly smiled at Pei Shi, taking his eyes off Ye Zhen for a while.</p>
<p>“Greetings to Third Madam Lu! Have you come to visit Lu Lingzhi?”</p>
<p>Pei Shi recognized Tang Zhen as the man who had been to Zhuangzi just two nights ago and her mouth instantly conformed into a smile. “I heard he was injured, so we came to take a look at him.”</p>
<p>“Lu Lingzhi’s just inside, Third Madam Lu. I’ll show you in.” When speaking, his eyes did not forget to glance at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ye Zhen didn’t notice the marquis unabashedly stealing glances at her, her eyes only staring at the floor as if looking for gold. The possibility of meeting the emperor still put her into a fit of discomfort.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen led them into the room.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi, confined in his bed, had already heard voices from outside. Immediately, he recognized Pei Shi’s voice which then made him think if Ye Zhen came with her.</p>
<p>Panic surged inside him at once!</p>
<p>Even though he was in pain, he forced himself to sit up.</p>
<p>The moment they came in, he greeted them, showing his gratitude the best he could muster, yet his hands beneath the sheets were fisted, his blood running cold at the sight of Ye Zhen emerging from his door.</p>
<p>“Third Aunt, Third Younger Sister, why are you here? I’m fine, this is just a minor injury.”</p>
<p>A hurried look at the window, he softly uttered. “You better be home; it will get dark soon.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Lu Lingzhi took a long look at Ye Zhen and felt a burst of surprise!</p>
<p>After just a few days, she had unexpectedly changed so much. There was almost no trace of the girl who came from the border town. Standing in front of him was a delicate miss, Lu Lingzhi was palpably baffled by her appearance.</p>
<p>“Third Aunt, the emperor ordered me to stay here for a few days. I will return when the wound is better.” He shut his eyes close, trying to stabilize his flustered heartbeat.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Pei Shi shook her head and made her objection be known.</p>
<p>“Third Aunt is staying here to take care of you for these coming days. Don’t be too stubborn to refuse! Although there are imperial physicians, they are not as careful as a woman.”</p>
<p>“Third Aunt, there are palace maids here.” Lu Lingzhi smiled wryly.</p>
<p>“Hmph! Palace maids know nothing about medicine. Don’t forget, your third aunt is still a physician.” She stated in protest. Her heart was not only grateful to Lu Lingzhi but was also guilty.</p>
<p>After all, he was injured because of her son.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips, she didn’t like what her mother was insinuating! She would never want to stay here to take care of Lu Lingzhi, regardless of his death!</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi knew he could not win against his third aunt, so he condescendingly said, “I understand that my third aunt feels guilty about her nephew, but my third sister is about to take the exam, so she should not stay here. Let her fourth brother send her home.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi looked back at Ye Zhen, thinking she didn’t wish to hamper her daughter’s studies.</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Tang Zhen intervened with enthusiasm, a wide smile painted on his face. “Fourth Brother is also injured. Let me take Third Sister home.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s tranquil face stared at him, indicating that he wasn’t a bit impressed with his friend being too friendly to his third sister. “I don’t wish to bother you, Marquis Tang.”</p>
<p>“No trouble, no trouble!” Tang Zhen motioned with his hand; this was his job he insisted.</p>
