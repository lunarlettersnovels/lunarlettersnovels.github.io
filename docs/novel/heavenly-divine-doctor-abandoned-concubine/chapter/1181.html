<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8"></div>
<p>Time slowly passed with Lu Wushuang asking Ye Zhen questions here and there. Seeing that she was taciturn, her answers were bumpy and dull, her displeasure was somewhat reduced to a degree. She thought that no matter how good-looking her third sister was, she was still the daughter of a small family that could not be at par with her.</p>
<p>As for Lu Wushuang, her family background had often been talked about. Thankfully, with the help of her master, she learned etiquette when she was still a child and now, she could always live with a facade.</p>
<p><i>However, her third sister grew up in a border town. What kind of tolerance must the people have for her?</i> She wondered. <i>Clearly, if there had been no Teacher Shan in the entrance examination, she would not have been able to enter.</i></p>
<p>“Third Sister seems to be bored here. Let my maid-in-waiting accompany you to the side palace halls. You can go outside if you want. However, don’t wander far off to different courtyards in this palace, so as not to offend other noble people,” Lu Wushuang said with a smile.</p>
<p>This was not a suggestion, but rather, an order. Without fuss, Ye Zhen followed Lu Wushuang’s maid-in-waiting out of the hall after giving a nimble nod. She knew that Lu Wushuang was going to send her out sometime soon as she had something to say privately to Old Madam.</p>
<p>When she arrived at one of the side palace halls, she was not in the mood to go out at all. Although Mo Rongzhan should be in his imperial study at this time, she still felt that she should not walk around to avoid meeting people she should not meet.</p>
<p>Shi Liu, Lu Wushuang’s maid-in-waiting, stood aside and carefully looked at the little girl sitting quietly. In her mind, she’s a little surprised that Ye Zhen looked more beautiful than Wang Fei even when clothed in much simpler robes.</p>
<p>With Ye Zhen and her maid-in-waiting gone, Lu Wushuang sat down beside Old Madam Lu with keen interest.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, didn’t you say there was a secret to easily conceive a child? Is there?” She had been itching to say this for a while now.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Old Madam Lu had a look of surprise on her face and couldn’t help but ask, “Didn’t Wang Fei say she isn’t in a hurry before? What happened now?”</p>
<p>“I used to think it was enough to win the emperor’s favor, but I have realized lately that he is still a man and sooner or later, I will have to share his attention! How can he only devote himself to me then? But Grandmother… an heir would tie him to me,” Lu Wushuang said with a bit of resentment.</p>
<p>“Dear, you are already the wang fei, the most distinguished concubine in this palace! Is His Majesty not good to you? If you wanted to be the only concubine, you should not have entered the palace in the first place.” Old Madam Lu spoke in an almost heavy tone.</p>
<p>If her granddaughter couldn’t understand this way of life, she would be thoroughly hurt.</p>
<p>Which woman in this world doesn’t like to be loved wholeheartedly? But men are always fond of new women and the emperor of this country was no exception. Old Madam Lu’s heart grieved for Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>There could be 3,000 beauties in the harem if the emperor wished to. Whoever could give birth to an heir and eventually become the empress dowager would be indisputably the winner.</p>
<p>With this thought, Lu Wushuang said discontentedly, “The emperor has only been on the throne for less than half a year, and the ministers are already clamoring for him to appoint a consort! Grandmother, what if the imperial palace is filled with potential concubines?”</p>
<p>“There are many women in the palace, but they are only ladies-in-waiting. Besides, the emperor only has you as a high-ranking imperial concubine, and the other imperial concubines’ positions are all vacant. Yet, dear, you should be ready for the emperor is expected to contribute to the imperial bloodline and is still young. Naturally, he is expected to widen the harem…”</p>
<p>As Old Madam made her understand, the more Lu Wushuang’s heart became restless.</p>
<p>“Also, Wang Fei should set an example and let everyone know that you are a good wife.” Finished Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>“Why should I set an example? It is not like there are no lowly concubines who were especially favored in history, then Empress Duanhui wouldn’t have—”</p>
<p>“Wang Fei!” Old Madam Lu intervened, raising her voice a little. “You think too much.”</p>
<p><i>How many women in this world can follow the steps of the former empress Qi Yanling?</i> Old Madam Lu thought to herself. It’s not that she underestimates her granddaughter, but how can Lu Wushuang compare with Qi Yanling?</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lu Wushuang knew this was a far-fetched dream, but she still yearned for it—the position of the empress.</p>
