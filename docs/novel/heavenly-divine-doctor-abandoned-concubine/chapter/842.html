<p><strong>Chapter 488 – Huangfu Chen and Mu Qing</strong></p>
<p>Huangfu Chen was successful in his studies. Because of Hu* lineage, he had always been one that attracted the attention of others. Coupled with his superb medical and accurate divination skills, he quickly became famous throughout the world. He was greatly disturbed in the capital and hence began to traverse the world.</p>
<p>[*non-Han people, esp. from central Asia]</p>
<p>He had saved Mu Qing at sea. Because something had happened to the merchant ship Mu Qing was on, she was the only one who survived.</p>
<p>Mu Qing had been floating in the sea for a few days. And when she met Huangfu Chen, she was already on the verge of death. If it weren’t for his excellent medical skills, he probably wouldn’t have been able to save her. Subsequently, she accompanied him and sailed around the sea.</p>
<p>In the beginning, she didn’t reveal to Huangfu Chen her true identity. She only said that she was the head maid of a big merchant family, the family head had died and she didn’t know how to return to her hometown, so she could only follow Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen fell in love with her over time. At the same time, he helped her find her hometown which was an island.</p>
<p>it was only then that Huang Fu Chen learnt that Mu Qing had not been honest with him. He found out that her master was Zhao Mingxiao, and that this island had once been destroyed by his great grandmother, who had later even imprisoned Zhao Zhao, the first master of this island, here.</p>
<p>However, even though Zhao Zhao was imprisoned, he was still able to revive the island and have his own descendants.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen was well aware of Zhao Zhao’s story, so when Mu Qing wanted him to treat Zhao Mingxiao, he didn’t agree. However, he still stayed on the island and became friends with Zhao Tianji.</p>
<p>Because Zhao Mingxiao’s body was weak, it was Zhao Tianji who became the island lord. At that time, Zhao Tianji had already started to practice their unique internal skills. Huangfu Chen couldn’t diagnose him at first. Although his body improved, he still couldn’t find the reason.</p>
<p>Mu Qing was Zhao Mingxiao’s subordinate and his childhood sweetheart. If Huangfu Chen wanted to marry her, he had to get the lattter’s consent. As such, he agreed to treat Zhao Mingxiao.</p>
<p>After he cured Zhao Mingxiao, he realized that Mu Qing was still his(ZMX) fiancée. Huangfu Chen wanted to take Mu Qing away, but not only did Zhao Mingxiao refuse to marry Mu Qing to someone else he also wanted the people on the island to kill Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>It was Zhao Tianji who called up the oath that people on the island had made previously that they would not kill anyone in the Huangfu family.</p>
<p>“Why is there such a strange oath on your island?” Ye Zhen asked Zhao Tianji curiously.</p>
<p>“Our great grandmother was also surnamed Zhao and had some connections with the Huangfu family,” Zhao Tianji said indifferently.</p>
<p>“What happened after?” Ye Zhen asked again.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji took a sip of tea and continued. “Mu Qing didn’t want to marry my brother, and I… I felt that Huangfu Chen was a good person so wanted to help them. Huangfu Chen planned to leave our island with Mu Qing.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen asked, “Why didn’t you succeed in the end?”</p>
<p>“By the time I went to look for Huangfu Chen with Mu Qing, he had already left. He had even left a letter saying that he already knew the secret of our island. In order to comply with the instructions of their Huangfu family, he could not have anything to do with anyone on our island… Not long after he left, our island was attacked. My big brother almost died to protect Mu Qing!” he whispered.</p>
<p>“You think my master sent those people who attacked your island?” Ye Zhen raised her eyebrows and looked at him.</p>
<p>The island lord just sulked and did not answer.</p>
<p>“It looks like you don’t believe whatever letter my master left behind. Otherwise, why haven’t you returned to the island for several years?” Ye Zhen smiled coldly. It seemed that both her master and Mu Qing had been schemed against.</p>
<p>As for why her master had suddenly left the island with only a message, it seemed that Zhao Mingxiao knew better than anyone else.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji whispered, “If it wasn’t for him, why didn’t he go back to find Mu Qing and why….”</p>
<p>Why didn’t he go back and explain it to him? Why did he disappear for so many years? Back then, even though his brother had been injured to save Mu Qing, she was still waiting for Huangfu Chen. She waited for two years and three years ago she gave up and married his brother.</p>
<p>“Since you have so many whys, why didn’t you ask my master?” Ye Zhen said unhappily.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji knew that Huangfu Chen was not the one who ambushed the island. He was angry that he was ready to betray his brother to help them but Huangfu Chen left by himself. He had not heard from him for years.</p>
<p>However, he had to bear the silent condemnation of the people on the island. Although he knew that it was not Huangfu Chen, this matter was caused by him(HFC)…</p>
<p>What he hated was Huangfu Chen’s betrayal.</p>
<p>“If he wanted to explain it to me, he would have told me long ago,” Zhao Tianji said coldly. He had kept Huangfu Chen under house arrest for so long, but the man had not said a word.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head. “I think my master must have misunderstood something. Shouldn’t you ask him?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji did not speak for a long time before saying, “Let’s go back!”</p>
<p>“I forgot to tell you something.”Ye Zhen looked at the man. “You’ve said so much, but you don’t seem to know that Mu Qing has already married my master. Do you think my master will let his wife marry someone else?”</p>
<p>“What did you say?” Zhao Tianji’s expression changed. “When did Mu Qing marry him?”</p>
<p>“That you’ll have to ask my master yourself,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>It seemed that there were too many misunderstandings between Huangfu Chen and Mu Qing. If he didn’t make it clear, he probably wouldn’t be able to solve this misunderstanding for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Back in the Peach Blossom Spring, Zhao Tianji locked himself in his room. He didn’t know what he was angry about, but he even chased Liang Yin out.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that he was definitely hesitating if he should go and look for Huangfu Chen, but he still couldn’t save face, so he was angry with himself.</p>
<p>“What did you say to the Second Young Master on the boat?” Mu Xue blocked Ye Zhen, who was about to leave. She stared at her warily.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “If you want to know, go and ask your Second Young Master. Why ask me?”</p>
<p>Mu Xue looked at her with a gloomy expression.</p>
<p>“Miss Mu, if there’s nothing else, please move aside,” Ye Zhen said indifferently.</p>
<p>“So what if you curry favor with Second Young Master? You are Huangfu Chen’s apprentice, no matter what, you cannot go to our island!” Mu Xue said coldly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “Miss Mu, have you misunderstood something? I’m not interested in your island at all. Your feelings for your Second Young Master have nothing to do with me. You don’t have to look at me with bitterness and hatred as if I’ve robbed you of your beloved.”</p>
<p>Mu Xue’s face turned red. “What nonsense are you talking about? I’ll kill you!”</p>
<p>“Just like Zhao Tianji, he would kill at any time. You are a natural match.” Ye Zhen laughed mockingly.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao!” Mu Xue drew her sword and said to Ye Zhen, “Try saying another word.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her with a faint smile and gently moved her sword away. “Don’t block my path. If you wanted to kill me, you would have killed me long ago.”</p>
