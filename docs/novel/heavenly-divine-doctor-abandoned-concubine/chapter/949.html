            <p><strong>Chapter 380 – To See Her (2)</strong></p>
<p>The empress dowager had asked Ye Zhen over to Cining Palace to persuade her not to live in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard.</p>
<p>“Aijia has heard that the room where a physician resides is not much better than a palace maid’s. How can you get used to that? Listen to the Aijia and move to Cining Palace,” The empress dowager said softly. She was very happy knowing that Yaoyao was residing in the palace, just not in the Imperial Physician’s Courtyard.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said with a smile, “Imperial Mother, I can’t be pampered this much. Since I grew up in the border town, I am already used to these situations. Besides, I insist on being a physician. How can I be treated differently from others? Don’t worry about me. I’ll learn to take care of you, so I can accompany you every day.”</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the empress dowager’s palace was equipped with physicians, and now there is a female physician in the Cining Palace, looking after the empress dowager daily.</p>
<p>The empress dowager nodded and said helplessly, “What can I say…”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen acted coquettishly towards the empress dowager, rubbing the other’s arm a few times. “I have also dreamed of becoming like Princess Zhenyue, not only a princess but also a renowned physician for generations.”</p>
<p>Princess Zhenyue, the granddaughter of Qi Yanling, not only possessed a noble status but also inherited her grandmother’s medical skills. She opened a private infirmary, which was different from the Imperial Infirmary, which was especially for noble families. This infirmary catered specifically to the poor people.</p>
<p>Speaking of the princess, one would naturally think of the Huangfu Dynasty.</p>
<p>The Huangfu Dynasty reached its peak in Huangfu Xiu’s hands. However, in less than twenty years of his reign, he abdicated and let his son Huangfu Sheng succeed the throne after him. Huangfu Sheng learned from his father. He abdicated at a young age and passed on the throne to his sixteen-year-old son. Contrary to the pair of predecessors, his son did not learn from them. He ruled for forty years until he died and was succeeded by the next crown prince. The prince had no interest in government affairs and only wanted to have fun all day long, raising a number of corrupt officials during his time.</p>
<p>With the rise of the Mo Family, the Huangfu Dynasty officially ended.</p>
<p>At that time, Princess Zhenyue, who was still managing the infirmary she started, left the capital together with her grandnephew, Huangfu Chen. It’s said that Princess Zhenyue was still alive, but her whereabouts were unknown.</p>
<p>Apart from the changes of these dynasties, Princess Zhenyue was very famous among the folk, and people loved and respected her very much. Even after she disappeared, a golden monument was built to commemorate her.</p>
<p>When Empress Dowager heard that Ye Zhen wanted to learn from Princess Zhenyue, she didn’t get angry. Instead, she felt that she had ambition. “Aijia shall wait for Princess Fu Rong to become a famous doctor.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed bashfully.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>When Mo Rongzhan arrived at Cining palace, he happened to witness the scene of a mother’s kindness and daughter’s filial piety. He hadn’t seen Ye Zhen for several days. His gaze touched her as bright as the autumn moon face. His heart throbbed, he almost couldn’t turn his gaze on anything else.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen saw him come in, bowed her head, and stood aside obediently.</p>
<p><em>It seems that it’s not easy to untie this knot!</em> Mo Rongzhan smiled, bitter in his heart, and went to greet the empress dowager. “Imperial Mother, I heard that your appetite is not very good these days. Are you feeling ill?”</p>
<p>The empress dowager jokingly said, “You just asked Aijia yesterday. Aijia is just sick of eating food prepared by the palace. Whenever I feel discomfort, Imperial Physician Huang comes and checks on me. It’s nothing serious.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded. Of course, he knew, he had asked the same thing just yesterday. All he wanted was an excuse to see Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao said that she would make some medicated dishes for Aijia, so His Imperial Majesty need not worry.” The empress dowager lightly laughed.</p>
<p>Without further ado, Ye Zhen said, “Imperial Mother, I’ll make you medicated dishes now.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager nodded with a smile while Ye Zhen curtsied and withdrew herself from the empress dowager’s chambers, happy to avoid Mo Rongzhan. On the other hand, the man thought he had no time to say things to her.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, stay with Aijia for dinner later. You have lost some weight these days,” the empress dowager said, affectionately.</p>
<p>“Yes, Imperial Mother.” Mo Rongzhan’s smile rose from the corner of his mouth, and his mood suddenly improved a lot.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen came back with the medicated dishes, she saw that Mo Rongzhan was still in Cining Palace, and her pretty little face suddenly became gloomy.</p>
<p>“Today, the imperial kitchen has made a lot of delicious food. I had someone ask the little prince over. Just in time, we could have our family dinner,” The empress dowager happily said. Ever since Mo Rongzhan became the emperor, it was very difficult for him to accompany her to dinner.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen thought they should have their family dinner, so she’d withdraw herself and go to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard. Before she could say anything, the empress dowager had already taken her hand and asked her to sit down. “Yaoyao, you sit next to Aijia.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Yaoyao. It’s seldom that Imperial Mother is this happy. Sit down and join us for dinner,” Mo Rongzhan said in a low voice.</p>
<p>What choice did Ye Zhen have but to smile and sit down beside the empress dowager? Not long after, Mo Rongyi arrived.</p>
<p>“Oh, these are made by Yaoyao herself!” Mo Rongyi couldn’t wait to take a bite of the steamed tofu before his eyes. “Hmmm, it’s delicious!”</p>
<p>The empress dowager gave him an angry look. “What a greedy ghost*!”</p>
<p>[* A greedy ghost is like a glutton]</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, you should also try it.” Ye Zhen lightly laughed.</p>
<p>“I’ll try, too,” Mo Rongzhan said while looking at Ye Zhen. However, this young miss didn’t even spare him a glance.</p>
