            <h3><strong>Chapter 547 – Not in His Heart Anymore</strong></h3>
<p>Spirit Snake Island was just like its name. There were many poisonous snakes on the island. This was the season when poisonous snakes were rampant. Back then, Huangfu Chen almost fell into a poisonous snake pit. If it weren’t for the fact that he had the antidote on him, he would already be dead.</p>
<p>Even so, he had finally gotten rid of all the snake venom after prolonged treatment in Niujia Village.</p>
<p>How could a woman survive this treacherous island?</p>
<p>When Huangfu Chen found Mu Qing, she was on the brink of death. She was bitten by snakes in many places and couldn’t tell which wounds were poisonous and which were not. Huangfu Chen took her back to Zhao Jia Island and exhausted all methods before bringing her back to life.</p>
<p>“Why save me, I know I won’t live long.” Mu Qing woke up after three days in a coma. When she saw the haggard Huangfu Chen, her eyes welled up with tears.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen didn’t say anything, just fed her medicine in silence.</p>
<p>“Big Sister.” Mu Xue and Mu Fei stood to the side, looking at their sister excitedly.</p>
<p>“Are you all okay?” Mu Qing was very excited to see her sister and brother as well. “Right, Yaoyao… Is Yaoyao okay?”</p>
<p>“She’s fine,” Huangfu Chen said in a low voice.  “She has already returned to the capital, you took her to Black Winds Island?”</p>
<p>“Zhao Mingxiao wanted to lock her up on Spirit Snake Island. I was afraid Spirit Snake Island was dangerous. Although Black Wind Island is far away, there are medicinal supplies and weapons hidden by Zhao Mingxiao there. I thought she would be safer there than on Spirit Snake Island,” Mu Qing said. “I’m glad that she is fine.”</p>
<p>“Sister, you only care about others. If you hadn’t rescued Lu Yaoyao, how would my brother-in-law treat you like this?” Mu Xue said angrily, she felt that Lu Yaoyao was the root cause of this.</p>
<p>“You still call that man brother-in-law, how could he be our brother-in-law?”  Mu Fei cried aloud. “I wish I could kill him.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen glanced at them lightly and said, “You go out, Mu Qing still needs to rest.”</p>
<p>“Big Sister…” Mu Xue looked at Mu Qing hesitantly.</p>
<p>Mu Qing’s face was pale, she looked very weak and really needed a rest.</p>
<p>“Let’s go out.” Mu Fei seemed to have matured at once, he took Mu Xue’s hand and walked out of the room, giving Huangfu Chen and Mu Qing space.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? We are out, there is only Huangfu Chen inside!” Mu Xue exclaimed angrily.</p>
<p>“If there was no Huangfu Chen, would Big Sister still be alive today?” Mu Fei retorted, ignoring her anger.</p>
<p>“But…” Mu Xue bit her lip. In fact, she also wondered why Zhao Jia Island had turned out like this. <em>Why did the Island Lord imprison Brother-in-law? Shouldn’t the two of them work together when there are foreign enemies invading?</em></p>
<p><em>Why would Brother-in-law treat Big Sister like this?  Just because she saved Lu Yaoyao?</em></p>
<p><em>Had that pair of master and disciple not set foot in their Zhao Jia Island, perhaps none of this would have happened.</em></p>
<p>“Don’t even think about going to Zhao Mingxiao, he is no longer be our brother-in-law.” Mu Fei warned Mu Xue resentfully. “He almost killed Big Sister… You should know that he was never the one to cherish her.”</p>
<p>Mu Xue glared at her younger brother and said, “Who taught you these words?”</p>
<p>“Hmph, I can tell!” Mu Fei clenched his fists. If the Island Lord doesn’t kill Zhao Mingxiao, I will personally do the needful… That ruthless man deserves to die for the state Big Sister is in now.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>“What will Ah Ji do to him?” Despite drinking the medicine, Mu Qing still looked pale. She had too many wounds on her body. Even if Huangfu Chen tried his best to use all the healing balms left by Yaoyao,  it only served to wake Mu Qing up.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Huangfu Chen said calmly. He really didn’t know how Zhao Tianji would treat Zhao Mingxiao, but he would definitely not let him off easy.</p>
<p>He would not kill Zhao Mingxiao, just nullify his martial arts such that his body deteriorated day by day. He wanted that wretched man to feel worse, little by little, until the moment he died.</p>
<p>Mu Qing smiled wryly and shook her head. “I knew of his ambitions long ago, but because he is my husband, I never dared to tell the Island Lord, and almost killed him. How is Island Lord?”</p>
<p>“Zhao Tianji is fine, don’t worry about him,” Huangfu Chen said lightly.</p>
<p>“Then I can rest assured.” Mu Qing nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen raised his eyes and looked at her tenderly. “Do you want to see Zhao Mingxiao?”</p>
<p>Mu Qing shook her head gently. “I don’t want to see him ever again.”</p>
<p>“Are you willing to leave Zhao Jia Island with me?” Huangfu Chen gently stroked her temples, he wanted to take her back to Niujia Village for treatment.</p>
<p>“‘Ah Chen, in fact, you and I both know that the poison on my body cannot be cured.” Mu Qing smiled bitterly. “You are willing to stay and save me… I’m very grateful to you. We were destined to meet, but not be together… I got to see you one more time before I die, and that is satisfaction enough for me.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen felt a stinging pain in his heart. “Don’t say such things, you will get better.”</p>
<p>“I can’t get better.” Mu Qing’s eyes were full of tears, “The most regrettable thing in my life is not being able to be your wife for a lifetime. If I could have trusted you more, I would not have married him…”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have left,” Huangfu Chen said softly.</p>
<p>Mu Qing shook her head, her eyes brimming with tears. They were never fated to be together. So what if the misunderstanding was resolved now?  She was already married to Zhao Mingxiao, and Huangfu Chen already had another woman in his heart.</p>
<p>“Ah Chen, I want to stay on Zhao Jia Island. Go and find your little apprentice, you should be very worried about her,” Mu Qing said softly.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen had been very worried about Yaoyao, but now that she had Mo Rongzhan by her side, he knew she would not be in danger. “Yaoyao has someone by her side… to protect her. I will take you away from Zhao Jia Island to heal.”</p>
<p>“Are you willing to give Yaoyao to someone else?” Mu Qing closed her eyes. So he wasn’t yet clear on his feelings. On the contrary, it was she, who upon seeing him with Lu Yaoyao for the first time, had realised that she no more had a place in his heart.</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Huangfu Chen’s heart was a little heavy.</p>
<p>Mu Qing smiled and shook her head. “Go out, I want to sleep.”</p>
<p>“OK, you rest first.” Huangfu Chen thought she was just tired, and after watching her for a while, he left the room.</p>
<p>“How is she?” Zhao Tianji was waiting outside the door and asked when he saw Huangfu Chen come out.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen sighed and said, “If we can take her away from Zhao Jia Island to heal her injuries, maybe…”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think he would be so ruthless even to his love,” Zhao Tianji remarked. To Zhao Mingxiao, perhaps the only thing that mattered the most was his ambition.</p>
<p>“How is it over at Black Wind Island?” Huangfu Chen asked.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji pursed his lips in annoyance and said, “How would I know? All the people left behind by Mo Rongzhan are there… Jiang Ashi did not leave either, saying that he will live in Zhao Jia Island hereon…”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled lightly, “With Grandpa Jiang on Zhao Jia Island, who would dare to threaten your status as the Island Lord?”</p>
