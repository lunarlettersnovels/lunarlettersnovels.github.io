            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 225 – Look Into Her (2)</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at Tang Zhen with keen eyes. “Do not hide something from me just because she is an extended family member of Lu Lungzhi.” He issued a veiled threat.</p>
<p>“I dare not.” Tang Zhen hurriedly replied.</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered that Lu Yaoyao had complained about the injustice done to the Ye Family in front of him.</p>
<p><em>The emperor wanted to look into her. Is it related to this?</em></p>
<p>Tang Zhen didn’t think much about Mo Rongzhan’s intention in other aspects. In his perspective, Mo Rongzhan was not a person who would be casually attracted to women. It was not that there was no stunning woman who showed him kindness before, and yet, Mo Rongzhan had turned a blind eye to them all.</p>
<p>Even so, the reason plagued him to no end. His mind raced to find a quick answer even as he surmised.</p>
<p><em>He wants to investigate Lu Yaoyao. He must not like her after he found out that she had once spoken up for the Ye Family</em>.</p>
<p>“No one is to know that I have asked you to look into Lu Yaoyao,” Mo Rongzhan instructed.</p>
<p>“Very well, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen did not dare ask why he wanted to check on Lu Yaoyao. It was his beloved girl. He had looked into her once before and had found nothing amiss. In his opinion, everything she had done was a direct result of Teacher Shan’s incitements. There was no other explanation for her behaviour.</p>
<p>Coming to the capital, she had become closely associated with her teacher who was also the late Wang Fei’s teacher. Obviously, a naive girl like Lu Yaoyao was bound to be influenced considering her master was a prominent figure. Given her age, it was no surprise that her moral compass could be easily swayed and without her knowing, even mislaid. After checking it once more, he would have a clearer understanding and naturally report it to the emperor. He had nothing to fear for the girl of his dreams.</p>
<p>Thus, upon receiving his orders, Tang Zhen was dismissed.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>The Lu Mansion</p>
<p>While the imperial study was unsettled, the carriage was still quiet. Ye Zhen and Aunt Cheng had hardly spoken before they had arrived at the mansion.</p>
<p>As soon as they disembarked, Aunt Cheng directly went to Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>“Third Miss is indeed a beautiful and intelligent woman. She only made several medicated meals for the Little Prince. The Little Prince’s condition has improved a lot. Imperial Physician Qi said before that because of the Little Prince’s incessant bouts of vomiting, he could not stomach any medicine. As a result, nothing could be done to alleviate his illness. Thanks to Third Miss, the empress dowager could not even say how happy she was. Third Miss was asked to accompany the dowager for a talk in the palace,” Aunt Cheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was beaming with pride. She humbly said, “Indeed, the empress dowager thinks highly of this child.”</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng did not converse with Old Madam Lu for too long. She just talked about how Ye Zhen had won the favor of the empress dowager in the palace and took her leave. Her purpose was to clear any doubts that may or may not be hanging due to the abrupt turn of affairs. The empress dowager had especially tasked her with clearing Lu Yaoyao’s name in the incident concerning Wang Fei Lu.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was someone who knew her place. She did not ask anything about her eldest granddaughter, though curious.</p>
<p>However, when Aunt Cheng was about to leave, she only whispered that there was no need for the old madam to worry about anything.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is how the wise converse. Nothing had been said, but Old Madam was relieved.</p>
<p>Not long after seeing off Aunt Cheng, Madam Lu arrived. She had got word that Aunt Cheng had sent Lu Yaoyao back. Apparently, Third Miss had not returned from the palace these past two days.</p>
<p>“Mother, I heard that Aunt Cheng was here.” As soon as Madam Lu entered the door, she asked in a hurry, “Did you ask her about the Wang Fei? Can you ask her to ask for a favor from the empress dowager? ”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was about to converse with Ye Zhen when Liu Shi had wasted no time in asking her questions. She was a one-track mind after all, just like her daughter.</p>
<p>The elder’s face sank. She didn’t know how to settle this agitated daughter-in-law without stirring further trouble.</p>
<p>“Aunt Cheng just sent Yaoyao back.” She replied flatly.</p>
<p>“Why did Yaoyao enter the palace?” Madam Lu immediately demanded, staring at Ye Zhen with sharp eyes.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked back at her lightly. She was not willing to deal with Madam Lu at all. One, it was a wasted effort for the other would only believe what she wanted two. Two, the Little Prince’s condition was a sensitive issue, she did not know how much she was allowed to divulge. So it was best to stay mum.</p>
<p>Madam Lu was more and more irritated by Ye Zhen’s gaze. She had never found her pleasing to the eye. Last time the Wang Fei had sent a message to her, asking her to marry off Lu Yaoyao as early as possible. Back then she had not taken it seriously. However, today, she had an exact picture of the goings-on.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps looking at the Wang Fei being doted upon makes her think that if she were to seduce the emperor she could enter the palace too.</em></p>
<p>“Why did Yaoyao enter the palace? What does it have to do with you?” Old Madam Lu threw back a question.</p>
<p>“Mother, you can’t always be partial towards the Third Household. Shuang’er is being confined this time. Perhaps, she has something to do with it. Who knows what she did in the palace!” Madam Lu said viciously.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was so angry that she smashed the teacup on the floor!</p>
<p>“Silence! Is this how you behave as an elder? Today, Aunt Cheng personally sent Yaoyao back. She has been in the Cining Palace these past two days. Must you take advantage of Empress Dowager?”</p>
<p>She had had enough of her daughter-in-law’s antics. If she let her be, she would run rampant. Such caustic words, disregard for her… she would not tolerate it.</p>
<p>“This daughter-in-law dares not,” Madam Lu said, albeit unwillingly, “I just want to know why Lu Wushuang was confined.”</p>
<p>She looked squarely at Ye Zhen, refusing to back down. She was certain this girl was in the know, and today she would have her answer at all cost.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen returned a cold and steady gaze. “The Wang Fei was confined because she broke into the Palace of Heavenly Purity in the middle of the night incurring the emperor’s great anger.”</p>
