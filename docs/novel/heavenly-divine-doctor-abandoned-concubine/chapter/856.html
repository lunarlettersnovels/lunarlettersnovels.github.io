            <p><strong>Chapter 474 – Mysterious Villa</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen and the others were brought back into the carriage, but this wasn’t their carriage, but Mr. Qiu’s. Dai Mei and Quan Fu were taken to another carriage.</p>
<p>“Cover their eyes.” Mr. Qiu didn’t say anything else and immediately instructed the people around him.</p>
<p>Unlike those burly men, the guard around Mr. Qiu looked even more powerful. He first tapped Huangfu Chen and Ye Zhen’s acupoints before covering their eyes.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart thumped. She didn’t know where they would be taken and who they would meet. What made her even more at a loss was that no one knew that they had been captured. Even if Huangfu Chen knew martial arts, when faced with so many people, she felt that no matter how strong his martial arts were, it was useless.</p>
<p>These people… Who are they?</p>
<p>“Why did you go to Gujia Village?” Mr. Qiu suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips and heard Huangfu Chen’s cold and indifferent reply, “I happened to pass by.”</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu snorted. “If you’re skilled in medicine, you might be able to leave alive.”</p>
<p>“Safe and sound?” Ye Zhen asked in a low voice. Although this person called Mr. Qiu looked very ordinary, his eyes were firm and cold. Even if they cured his master, they might not be able to leave completely.</p>
<p>“That depends on you,” Mr. Qiu said coldly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not ask any further. She hoped that there would still be a chance to escape. These people weren’t good. If they could leave, they must tell Mo Rongzhan and have him investigate.</p>
<p>Thinking of Mo Rongzhan, Ye Zhen’s heart sank slightly. Her mind recalled the situation the night before last. Her cheeks unconsciously turned red. He should already know that she was not in Jing Capital. He must be very angry, but he shouldn’t have sent people to look for her…</p>
<p>He was so tall and arrogant, how could he allow her to refuse and escape again and again?</p>
<p>“We’re here. Let them come down.” Mr. Qiu’s voice rang out from outside.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen subconsciously leaned towards Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry.” Huangfu Chen whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ye Zhen nodded lightly. She was not afraid, just had a bad premonition for all of this.</p>
<p>They walked blindfolded for a while before Mr. Qiu had someone take the black cloth off their eyes.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen rubbed her eyes and adapted to the brightness. Only then did she see what was in front of her.</p>
<p><em>This was… a villa?</em></p>
<p>From their point of view, it looked like rows of resting-mountain roofs. The layout was exquisite, occupying an extremely large area. It looked like a palace. The villa was built on the back of Shuangwang (Twin Kings) Peak, flanked by high mountain forests on either side. If one were to enter the mountain to look for it, one would not be able to find the location of the villa.</p>
<p>In front of the villa was a large lake with turquoise waters, and if one wanted to go to the villa, one would have to take a boat to cross the lake.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes were filled with surprise. She exchanged glances with Huangfu Chen. She had grown up in the Ye family and lived a life of luxury. But this was the first time she had seen such a large villa. Only after crossing the lake did she realize that the roof they had just seen was only a corner of the villa in the jungle. It was decorated with halls and palaces.</p>
<p>As she entered the villa,  Ye Zhen could not hide the surprise in her eyes. It was surrounded by undulating mountains, peaks, and ravines. The walls and roofs here were made of green bricks and gray tiles. The wooden pillars on the floor were also the natural color of logs. They looked elegant, solemn, and simple.</p>
<p>The person who built this villa must have come from a very high background. Otherwise, how could he have such foresight?</p>
<p>“Get in.” Mr. Qiu stopped again and let Ye Zhen and Huangfu Chen get into the carriage beside him.</p>
<p>After about half an hour, they finally stopped outside a courtyard. This courtyard was more like a southern garden. Dai Mei and Quan Fu were stopped outside. Only Ye Zhen and Huangfu Chen were taken in.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her head to take a look. This garden had a plaque with the words Peach Blossom Spring written on it.</p>
<p><em>This is the Peach Blossom Spring? Truly*!</em></p>
<p>[*真是 zhēn shi: indeed; truly; (coll.) (used to express disapproval, annoyance, etc about sth)</p>
<p>讽刺 fěng cì: to satirize; to mock; irony; satire; sarcasm … this truly here means  is filled with sarcasm]</p>
<p>As Mr. Qiu entered the Peach Blossom Spring, his aura changed. He became respectful and cautious. He bowed to the wheelchair-bound man in the pavilion in the courtyard. “Master, this subordinate has brought you two doctors. I heard the medical skills are excellent.”</p>
<p>At his words, the corners of Ye Zhen’s mouth twitched. <em>When did we say our medical skills were excellent?</em></p>
<p>The man sitting in the wheelchair was dressed in a silver-white normal uniform. A few stalks of bamboo were embroidered on his sleeves and robes. A golden jade crown wrapped his ink-colored hair. His thin lips were slightly pursed, and his feminine and handsome face carried a faint smile. His gaze fell on Ye Zhen and the others.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was really shocked to see Mr. Qiu’s master. <em>He is actually so young?</em> He seemed to be under thirty.</p>
<p>“Since he’s a doctor, he’s a guest. Let’s have the two guests wash off their disguises from their faces first.” The man’s voice was low and gentle, but it made people feel a trace of bone-deep coldness.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was shocked. <em>He could actually see Master’s disguise technique? Could this person be proficient in disguise?</em> She looked at Huangfu Chen and found that his eyes were a little strange. <em>Master knows this man?</em></p>
<p>“You guys are disguised?” Mr. Qiu pointed angrily at Ye Zhen. “Who are you?”</p>
