            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 258 – Desire (2)</strong></p>
<p>But before he could bask in the pleasure, unbidden, the scenes from their interactions came to his mind. She had never vied for his attention, treating him like air, unlike the other maidens who fought tooth and nail if only for his momentary glance. How she had stubbornly proclaimed she did not want to compete with other women for an old cucumber! In no time, Mo Rongzhan’s eyes turned gloomier.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ye Zhen stirred. She looked like she was a little annoyed by his antics. She flailed her small hand, rubbed her cheek against his chest a few times, and continued enjoying her sweet, sweet dreams.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s thin lips rose into a little smile, he suddenly lowered his head and pecked her pink lips like a dragonfly lightly skimming the surface of water. He licked his lips and felt unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s breathing was impeded, her eyelids quivered a few times. He sensed that the girl in his arms seemed to be waking up. He gently pressed with his fingers the sides of her neck pushing her into a deeper sleep.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who was put to sleep, did not know that she was like a lamb delivered to the wolf’s mouth. Without a care, she lay there letting him do as he pleased. It was not like she was aware of his presence anyway.</p>
<p>Afraid that he would not be able to bear it if he kept going on, he had to resist the impulse and pull himself back. Then, wrapping a cloak on her, he reluctantly turned away and walked the library pagoda.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu who had been waiting in chilly cold wind outside the library pagoda for most of the night, at last, saw his master striding out. At first, he wanted to meet him and say a few flattering words but as soon as he saw the emperor’s gloomy face, he immediately sealed his mouth and dared not utter a peep.</p>
<p><em>Oh, what did Third Miss Lu do to the emperor? When the emperor entered the library pagoda a while ago, the radiance of spring was written all over his face. How long has it been? The look on his face seems to be  … an insatiable desire.</em></p>
<p>Back at the Palace of Heavenly Purity, Mo Rongzhan ordered Eunuch Fu to fetch water for a bath.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the emperor didn’t want to pamper a few women but due to his mysophobia since childhood, he didn’t like to touch them at all. At first, he’d thought Lu Wushuang was the little girl who’d saved him, so he was willing to touch her. Now that he knew otherwise, he didn’t even want to look at her.</p>
<p>Outside the folding screen, Eunuch Fu took the clothes Mo Rongzhan wore, and let out a deep sigh of lament in his heart … <em>Ah, at this rate, how will the emperor expand the harem …</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">♚</p>
<p>The golden rays of the morning sun seeped in through the translucent window, kissing the beauty to wakefulness. Her eyes fluttered open, she blinked trying to take in her surroundings. When realization dawned upon her, she hastily sat up, a  puzzled look on her face as she noticed that her body was covered with a cloak, and a space heater was placed beside her. She remembered that she was lying on a table last night and yet …</p>
<p><em>How did I end up lying on the side of a woven mat now? Also … whose cloak is this?</em></p>
<p>Curious, Ye Zhen took the cloak and went out of the library pagoda to find Old Master Jiang. She wanted to know if there was anyone else inside the pagoda last night and this old-timer would be the best person to ask.</p>
<p>Outside the old master’s house, she called out several times but received no response. In the end, she had no choice but to carry the cloak back in. She didn’t mull over it now, time was of the essence, there were many <em>pages</em> to scale.</p>
<p>Not long after, the palace maid from the day before brought in her breakfast. After a quick bath and doing her hair, she got to eating breakfast. As she hastily moved her chopsticks, she didn’t forget to shoot a question to the person before her.</p>
<p>“Dai Mao, did you come to the library to see me last night?”</p>
<p>Palace Maid Dai Mao promptly shook her head and said, “This handmaiden was supposed to give Third Miss Lu a quilt last night, but Eunuch Fu who was outside stopped this servant from doing so.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen almost choked to death on the steamed buns she was nibbling. Stunned, she looked towards the other and said, “Who did you say was outside the library pagoda?”</p>
<p>“Eunuch Fu.” Dai Mao reiterated.</p>
<p><em>Since Eunuch Fu was here in the library pagoda last night, that means the emperor … was here as well?</em></p>
