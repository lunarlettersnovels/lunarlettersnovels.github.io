            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 276 – I Don’t Want To</strong></p>
<p>“Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>Before Ye Zhen walked into her courtyard, she was stopped by Lu Shixun.</p>
<p>“Second Uncle, are you looking for me?” Ye Zhen bowed and looked at her father’s brother with a smile. Although she wondered as to why he came to find her, she was certain nothing good would come out of this.</p>
<p>Lu Shixun had seen his share of beauty, being a merchant and now helming the family business, he was an astute eye. However, even he had to admit, the little girl before him … her delicate features, limpid eyes, elegant demeanor, and refined eloquence lent a unique charm to her being. She was particularly fetching in an adorable and endearing way. Little wonder that his eldest niece, Shuang’er, regarded her as the thorn by her side.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, Second Uncle has something to tell you, come with me.” His tone, though polite, brooked no room for refusal.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had long wanted to deal with this man who held the reins of the Lu Family business.  She was a staunch believer of –<em> know thy enemy and know thyself; in a hundred battles, fear no peril*.</em> And this was especially true in the case of the second lord. Now that opportunity had come knocking at her doorstep, she would certainly not look away.</p>
<p>[E/D: <em>zhī jǐ zhī bǐ</em> – 知己知彼  know yourself, know your enemy (idiom, from Sunzi’s “The Art of War” 孫子兵法|孙子兵法[Sun1 zi3 Bing1 fa3]) <em>bǎi zhàn bǎi shèng</em> – 百战百胜 to emerge victorious in every battle; to be ever-victorious]</p>
<p>“Okay.” She politely agreed.</p>
<p>Lu Shixun brought Ye Zhen to his study. It would be a lie if she said she wasn’t piqued by his sudden appearance. His solemn visage and succinct words had hardly betrayed his intentions, as such, she was treading blindly.</p>
<p>“Second Uncle, I wonder what you wish to say to me,” Ye Zhen asked curiously, seeming perfectly docile and courteous.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you should be well aware of the reason your grandmother fell ill this time.” Lu Shixun did not beat around the bush and got straight to the point, he knew that this niece of his was smart.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gently nodded, warily eyeing the man. She was trying to discern where he was headed, but so far she could glean nothing. She knew this man was no easy foe as such she was on the edge right now.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, not only are you devastatingly beautiful* but also kindhearted. For the sake of your grandmother and the Lu family, you would be willing to settle for less, right?” His serious demeanour cracked into a seldom worn benign smile.</p>
<p>[E/D: *qīng chéng qīng guó- 倾城倾国 lit. capable of causing the downfall of a city or state (idiom); fig. (of a woman) devastatingly beautiful]</p>
<p>Alas, in Ye Zhen’s eyes, his smile seemed faker than wearing a mask. “Second Uncle, since I’m this good, why should I aggrieve myself?”</p>
<p>“For the Lu Family, of course! Yaoyao, your second uncle wants you to marry into Jinkou City in the future. Are you willing?” Lu Shixun had also felt this little girl was sensible and compassionate. Given her rapport with his mother and her behaviour in general, he was confident that unlike her father, she would certainly consider the overall situation and not turn down his request. With her by his side, his brother wouldn’t have a choice but fall in line with his wishes.</p>
<p>“Because Wang Fei wishes me far away from the capital, I should marry into Jinkou City in the future … Is this for the sake of the Lu Family and the wang fei?” Ye Zhen asked, veiling her suspicions with a smile.</p>
<p>“That’s right! The Lu Family cannot foster hatred between sisters. The best arrangement is for you to leave the city,” Lu Shixun said. Now that his eldest brother was no more, he was the pillar of the entire family. It was only logical that he had to prioritize the welfare of the family above all else. A small hole can sink a great ship; history was proof that the downfall of an empire could be attributed to a speck of ill-will to say nothing of a family.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said word by word, “I. Don’t. Want. To!”</p>
<p>Lu Shixun was momentarily stupefied. He never expected this answer, even thinking he may have misheard. “What did you say?”</p>
<p>“Second Uncle, I didn’t do anything wrong, why should I compromise? What you worry about will never happen.” Though her words fell lightly, Ye Zhen made her stand clear.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, Second Uncle is doing things for your own good,” Lu Shixun said in a deep voice trying to control his surging rage.</p>
<p><em>What a Lu Shixun!!! So conceited, thinking that his decision is right! It seems that this person must also be used to being arbitrary in business!</em> “I think I am doing well now.”</p>
<p>Lu Shixun was stunned by her nonchalance and arrogance. He had thought she would be easy to deal with, but he was mistaken it seems. This girl indeed harboured flights of fancy, if left unchecked she would be their undoing. Tossing all pretences aside, he unleashed a volley of rebuke determined to show her her place. “What do you think you can gain by staying here? Yaoyao, it is impossible for our family to have another imperial concubine!”</p>
<p>She had been shocked by his previous words, but now she was teeming with disdain for the man. Such petty thoughts he possessed!</p>
<p>“Second Uncle, what are you thinking? Who said that I am going to enter the palace? Is it good enough only if I entered the palace?” Ye Zhen said in an ironic tone, “Thank you for worrying about the future for me, but it is none of your concern. I already have my affairs arranged by my father and grandmother, so you have nothing to worry about”</p>
<p><em>This girl is as stubborn as her father!</em> He was unreconciled and decided to play the sentimental card. “Are you going to watch your grandmother suffer?”</p>
<p>“I am not the one who makes my grandmother suffer. If Second Uncle wants to be really filial, it is better to go to the palace and talk to her,” Ye Zhen said without any tone, “This niece has other things to do, she shall not disturb Second Uncle.”</p>
