            <p><strong>Chapter 537 – In Person</strong></p>
<p>Zhao Jia Island was surrounded by a series of stone formations. At first, it was just a strange phenomenon, later in order to protect the island, they used the stone forest to create a stone array. Asa result, no one could enter or leave the island. This was how Zhao Jia Island became isolated from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Back then, there was only one person living on this island- Zhao Zhao. With the passage of time, she had more offspring in addition to Huangfu Xiu. Until today, no one knows how she birthed those children or how she broke the stone array confining the island because of which it* came to life.</p>
<p>[*island]</p>
<p>One could only say that Zhao Zhao was not an ordinary woman. It was unknown how she was able to leave descendants behind without alerting the Huangfu Dynasty, and quietly made the Zhao Jia Island prosper.</p>
<p>The first thing that Zhoa Mingxiao had to do after declaring sovereignty was to break the stone array. Since the existence of the island, there were hardly a hand few who were able to enter wading through the ever-changing formation surrounding it. Even if someone were to bring along a guide, one moment of carelessness and they would be forever trapped in the array.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao’s biggest confidence was that he had a way to destroy the stone array, and this was also the reason he was able to rally so much support. The destruction of this formation would bestow real freedom to the otherwise confined islanders.</p>
<p>He had played his cards well and weaved an intricate web the people would unwittingly walk into. Over the years, he had personally created a team of merchants. Their sole purpose was to leave the island, trade and bring back the wonders of the world outside. Although a simply ploy, it worked like a charm and more and more people yearned for the outside world.</p>
<p>Originally, Zhao Mingxiao planned to establish the country and then announce it to the outside world after settling the issue of Zhao Tianji. However, soon after he had announced, someone had already, secretly, spread the news.</p>
<p>When Mo Rongzhan learned of this development, he was already halfway to Zhao Jia Island. With Old Master Jiang leading the way, they had saved at least half the time compared to others.</p>
<p>“Zhao Jia Island declared sovereignty?” Mo Rongzhan looked at the secret report in his hand, the corners of his mouth held a cold smile. “This person, Zhao Mingxiao, is very ambitious.”</p>
<p>Old Master Jiang frowned at the news. “A small pirate island also dares to set up a country!”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan said in a light voice, “They are not much of a pirate island today, but… the two brothers, Zhao Mingxiao and Zhao Tianji, have turned against each other. It seems that Zhao Jia Island is not very safe today.”</p>
<p>At the thought of his little girl still being on the island, Mo Rongzhan’s frown deepened.</p>
<p>After two days, they finally arrived outside the stone array of the Zhao Jia Island where Shen Yi and the others had been waiting for a long time now. They had given several tries to break the formation in vain.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty!” As soon as Shen Yi saw the two warships, he immediately rowed a canoe over to pay greet.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan coldly swept his gaze over the stone forest in front of him, then turned to Shen Yi. “Have you any news of the princess?”</p>
<p>Shen Yi colored a little. He lowered his head, too afraid to face the emperor. “Your  Majesty, this subordinate captured a civilian from Zhao Island today. I… I heard that Zhao Mingxiao has captured the princess, and intends to make a sacrificial example of her in three days’ time…”</p>
<p>Just as he finished speaking, there was a loud noise.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan slammed the desk with his palm, leaving a crack under. “Zhao Mingxiao captured the princess?”</p>
<p>“That’s what the man said, Your Majesty,” Shen Yi replied lowering his head.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan suppressed the seething rage in his chest that wanted to annihilate everything around, turned back to Old Master Jiang and said, “Old Master, please take me into the island.”</p>
<p>Elder Jiang stared at the stone forest and said in a deep voice, “The stone formation has changed, I need time to break the formation.”</p>
<p>“Okay!” Mo Rongzhan did not rush him, even though he was already very anxious.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>At this moment, Ye Zhen was not on Zhao Jia Island. She had been taken away by Zhao Mingxiao’s men that night. Although she had reminded Ye Chunming before she left, she felt that he probably didn’t have a chance to save her. Zhao Mingxiao didn’t seem to have that much trust in him.</p>
<p><em>I wonder how Master and the others are doing… Can Zhao Tianji suppress Zhao Mingxiao?</em> Ye Zhen thought to herself as her eyes darted around her, trying to guess where she was now.</p>
<p>This place seemed like a cave. It was rather too big for just a cave, though – perhaps it was a house carved into the rock instead. <em>Was I passed out for a long time?</em> Her limbs were a bit weak.</p>
<p>She pushed past the door, opening the way up into a new passage. There were lights on the walls; dim ones, but enough to illuminate her surroundings nonetheless.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen walked along the passage for a long time, unwittingly going in circles. She didn’t know if she was heading towards the exit but she walked nonetheless. After an unknown period of time had passed, she stopped. A stone door stood before her, and there was no way out of it.</p>
<p>She pushed it in an attempt to open, but it didn’t budge in the slightest. Ye Zhen panted lightly and slumped to the ground, exhausted. She sat in the same place for a while before mustering her strength, standing up again, and holding the stone door, feeling and looking around carefully.</p>
<p>There was nothing special about the door except for the two lion-head lamps on front of the door. She turned the left lamp holder, and the stone door suddenly clicked and turned.</p>
<p>Before she could be surprised that there was actually a mechanism here, Ye Zhen was so taken away by what she saw in front of her that she was dumbfounded.</p>
<p><em>This is…</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen stared at the huge space behind the stone door. Spears, sabres, armors, bows and arrows… All the weapons often seen on the battlefield filled the whole cave. This cave was the largest one she had seen in this place. Even bigger than the medicine warehouse she had seen before in the School of Medicine.</p>
<p><em>These weapons are the ones that Zhao Tianji built in the private mine</em>? <em>It seems Mo Rongzhan was right, Zhao Tianji simply had more than one iron mine.</em></p>
<p><em>Zhao Mingxiao is crazy! Since how long has he been harboring the intentions to turn the Zhao Jia Island into Zhao Kingdom? The depths of this man’s mind are just too terrifying!</em></p>
<p>When Ye Zhen walked in to take a look, she found another cave hidden next to it. This one</p>
<p>housed herbs and provisions.</p>
<p><em>Seems like Zhao Mingxiao has stocked things here. But why would he keep me here… No, it couldn’t have been him. It should be Ye Chunming who saved me and brought me here.</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen accidentally found some dry food and barely nibbled a few bites to fill up her stomach before continuing to look for a way out.</p>
<p>She was certain that wherever this place was, it was definitely not Zhao Jia Island. She wondered what was going on there today.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>At the moment, Zhao Jia Island was in chaos. Zhao Mingxiao had given explicit orders to keep the news of him declating sovereignty underwraps, hoever, Ye Chunming had other designs. The latter perceived that Zhao Mingxiao was nothing like the puppet-emperor his late father controlled. It would not only be difficult to tame but also reason with obstinate man. But control was what he sought, and control was what he would have at all costs. Thus, he secretly leaked the news and even mentioned that Lu Yaoyao was captured and would be executed in three days.</p>
<p>His plan was to lure Mo Rongzhan, and if Lu Lingzhi were also to come, it would be killing two birds with a stone. But unfortunately, Marquis Anyang was poisoned, and it was highly unlikely that he would come to Zhao Jia Island.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming looked at the distant stone forest. <em>No, I cannot die here!</em></p>
<p>If Mo Rongzhan came, he would definitely start a war with Zhao Mingxiao. Both sides would suffer heavy losses, giving him a chance to flee. He would then have a chance to settle scores with Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>“Where is Lu Yaoyao?” At some point, Zhao Mingxiao had come behind Ye Chunming, he looked at him with a somewhat gloomy gaze.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming glanced back at him and said, “Didn’t your men capture her?”</p>
