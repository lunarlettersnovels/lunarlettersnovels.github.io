            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 118 – Her Most Awaited Entrance Examination</h3>
<p>Ye Zhen entered the halls of the School of Medicine. First, she went to her designated place and acquired a palm-sized card. It had six elegant words, each with a square below it. It was where the teachers would write scores based on her performance.</p>
<p><i>At least three A’s of the six subjects must be earned to ensure admittance in the Academy for Women,</i> Ye Zhen kept this in her mind. Sooner or later, this card would be filled.</p>
<p>Everywhere Ye Zhen went, she attracted a lot of attention, which was even more exaggerated than when she was in her previous body as the wang fei. She was much younger back then, only twelve when she first entered the proud halls of this academy.</p>
<p>That time, she still hadn’t grown in all aspects unlike her current appearance in the body of her twin sister Lu Yaoyao. Her elegance surprised everyone who saw.</p>
<p>Many even inquired about her family background and learned that she was the object of the wager recently instigated by Princess Liu Hua. Her beauty shone among the many, but if one looked at her closely, her eyes could be seen bearing a hint of contempt.</p>
<p>In truth, there were not many people who noticed her resemblance to the late wang fei. When she was still alive in her original body, she returned to the academy after marrying Mo Rongzhan. However, things became different then.</p>
<p>She learned in isolation, most of the time, the teachers taught her separately from others and she seldom had classmates. Xu Huiru knew her because they had been friends for a long time. Later on, Xu Huiru didn’t like being outshined by her and immediately stopped communicating with her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen came to a hall where a dozen girls of her age were waiting. When they saw her, their eyes flashed with astonishment.</p>
<p>She went to the last place and waited. She decided to take the etiquette and archery examinations first, the two subjects she was most sure of passing.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” A girl standing next to Ye Zhen asked quietly, “You look great.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the girl. The other party was slightly plump, with a round, adorable face.</p>
<p>“My name is Lu Yaoyao, and you are?” she asked just like other girls, with innocent curiosity on her face.</p>
<p>“My name is Sun Wen.” Sun Wen whispered. “Five people have just taken the exam, but they all left crying.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen listened to Sun Wen’s tone of nervousness and fear. She then soothed her with a smile. “Don’t be nervous, we will get through this.”</p>
<p>Sun Wen nodded vigorously. “My best skill is arithmetic, and my other skills are not so good. What about you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not very good at anything.” Ye Zhen answered with a shy smile.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid!” Sun Wen took Ye Zhen’s hand. “You look so good; you will definitely pass!”</p>
<p><i>In an instant, Ye Zhen lost her smile. Does being good-looking have anything to do with passing the exam?</i></p>
<p>Sun Wen covered her mouth and snickered. “I am naturally fond of good-looking people. If I am a teacher, I would definitely give you an A!”</p>
<p><i>What a straightforward girl! </i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and nodded humbly. “Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>When the people in front of them heard what they were talking about, they looked back at Sun Wen specifically with severe disgust.</p>
<p>“Ugly people make more mischief.”</p>
<p>Sun Wen blushed and glared angrily at the person in front of her. “What’s the matter with you?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen patted her on the shoulder. “It’s our turn soon, don’t dispute with her. If you quarrel with people here, then don’t even think about passing the etiquette exam.”</p>
<p>“Mmm!” Sun Wen reluctantly nodded, she also knew it was not suitable to quarrel here.</p>
<p>Soon it was their turn, and the woman standing in front of Sun Wen advanced into the hall. Before long, she came out with a smile.</p>
<p>It seemed to be a good result.</p>
<p>Sun Wen turned back to Ye Zhen and said, “I’ll wait for you outside for a while, and we’ll take the other tests together.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded in reply.</p>
<p>Sun Wen did not do very well in the etiquette examination. She only got a C, but her face did not look unhappy. She just blinked at Ye Zhen and went outside to wait for her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took a deep breath, lifted her foot, and went in.</p>
<p>There were three teachers in the hall. When Ye Zhen walked in, they all gave her a look of surprise.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had never seen the three teachers before, probably belonging to different schools. She knelt with her head down and greeted them like a student should.</p>
<p>This exam was mainly about etiquette. Don’t look back when you walk and don’t lift your lips when you speak. Don’t move your knees when sitting or shake your skirt when standing.</p>
<p>None of this was a problem for Ye Zhen. She was born into a noble family and could execute etiquette well.</p>
<p>However, she couldn’t do too well, which was not in line with Lu Yaoyao’s image. So, she made some deliberate mistakes in several moves, and finally got a B, which was quite good.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen came out, she saw Sun Wen waiting for her outside.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, which subject are you going to take next?” When Sun Wen saw Ye Zhen smiling, she immediately came over and asked.</p>
<p>“I want to take the equestrian and archery exams next.” Ye Zhen replied.</p>
<p>Looking at Ye Zhen’s delicate appearance, Sun Wen thought she was the least good at these two subjects and said, “Don’t be afraid when you ride a horse. The more you are afraid of it, the more disobedient it will become!”</p>
<p>Despite this, Ye Zhen just smiled from ear to ear and nodded. “Thank you for reminding me. Are you good at riding horses?”</p>
<p>“I used to live in a border town. I grew up riding on horseback when I was a child! Riding a horse is nothing to me.” Sun Wen beamed.</p>
<p>As they spoke, they came to the racecourse. Ye Zhen was surprised to find that the people here were not good. Even Princess Liu Hua and Xu Huiru were around.</p>
<p>“There is a hunting ground. It is said that Marquis Tang accompanied the little prince to hunt today and all those people came here.”</p>
<p>Sun Wen pointed to the other side of the racecourse. A little far away from them, Ye Zhen vaguely saw figures of guards.</p>
<p>As for Tang Zhen, she still hadn’t seen him. Anyway, Ye Zhen was not interested in seeing him.</p>
<p>Beyond her notice, Princess Liu Hua found her and came up to ask sarcastically, “Lu Yaoyao, how many A’s have you got?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen answered honestly. “None, but I will have it soon.”</p>
<p>“Will you?” Princess Liu Hua hissed. “Then we shall wait and see!”</p>
<p>“All right!” Ye Zhen smiled and handed the palm-sized card to the examiner who invigilated the racecourse.</p>
<p>“Go and pick your horse.” The examiner instructed.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did so without the examiner looking up at her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen recognized the examiner who had taught her equestrian before. However, she did not say anything, silently took the whip and picked a white horse.</p>
<p>Princess Liu Hua gazed at her scornfully from a distance. Beside her, Xu Huiru couldn’t help but stare at Ye Zhen in wonder. Their eyes followed her every move, Ye Zhen neatly turned over and mounted the horse.</p>
<p>The requirements to pass the exam were very simple. First, run for a lap, then go over five hurdles–a piece of cake for Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>She steered the horse and galloped slowly then faster and faster. The sun shone on her, highlighting her jade-like complexion.</p>
<p>The teacher holding Ye Zhen’s exam card squinted at her slightly and pinched the card tightly with his fingers.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had already completed a fast lap. She loosened one hand, stood up slightly, and drove the horse over the first fence.</p>
<p>“Lingzhi, is that Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>In the distant hunting ground, Tang Zhen looked at the racecourse with burning eyes.</p>
<p>Reins in his hand, Lu Lingzhi glanced at him. “Where? I can’t really see.”</p>
<p>Fronting them, a shrill, small voice suddenly intervened. “That girl on horseback, this little prince remembers her! She was the one who saved me last time!” Mo Rongyi, who was riding a horse, cried. “It turns out that she is in the academy today. Let’s go and have a look! Please! Please!”</p>
<p>The beautiful woman, with robes fluttering in the wind was comparable to a magnificent flying dragon.</p>
<p>This was the only concrete idea in Tang Zhen’s mind at this moment.</p>
