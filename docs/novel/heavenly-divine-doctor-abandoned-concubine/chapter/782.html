            <p><strong>Chapter 549 – Care About You</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s lips hurt from his kiss, and her whole body softened. She pressed his big palm covering her chest, tears pooling at the corners of her eyes, and begged for mercy softly, “Ah Zhan, don’t… This is a carriage.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s breathing was heavy, his dark and deep eyes still brimming with anger. He gently raised his head and bore his seething gaze into her without uttering a word.</p>
<p>“Why are you so angry anyway? Your harem is filled with women waiting to shower you with attention. Why would you care how I feel?” Ye Zhen did her utmost not to agitate him further out of fear he might <em>take</em> her in the carriage. It was not like it was her first time pretending she had softened up on him, so it came naturally to her.</p>
<p>“Why do you think?” Mo Rongzhan asked in a hoarse voice, his fingertips squeezing her beautiful chin with force. If it weren’t for the last shred of sanity, he might have crossed the limit and <em>taken*</em> her right here and now. However, if she dared to utter a word that he didn’t like to her, he wouldn’t spare her.</p>
<p>[*do the deed]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s cheeks flushed, and she wrapped her arms around his neck and took the initiative to rub her cheek a few times against his arm, forcing herself not to throw his hand out. “So what if you care about me today? One day, you will certainly disdain me.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan reckoned this little girl would be his undoing. No matter how angry he was, just a few gentle words from her would suffice to subdue his seething heart. How would he bear to be angry with her?</p>
<p>He helplessly tidied her clothes. Even if she was in pain here and there, he kissed her cheek and said, “So you really think I am the kind of person who embraces the new and abhors the old?”</p>
<p>It had nothing to do with liking the new and being tired of the old, it was related to her identity. If he knew that she was Ye Zhen, would he still like her like this?</p>
<p>Definitely not!</p>
<p>“Ever since I have doted on you, I haven’t touched other women in the harem, and you still say these things to me.” Mo Rongzhan rubbed her hard a few times and continued, “Sometimes I really want to strangle you, saves me from worrying about you day in and day out.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips, closed her eyes, and refused to shed any more tears. How could she not be move? On one hand, she was touched that he loved Lu Yaoyao to this extent, and on the other, she hated him for treating Ye Zhen the way he did. Her heart was torn into two, and it was very uncomfortable… In fact, it was awful.</p>
<p>Only after she didn’t have anything to do with Lu Lingnzhi, would she leave… certainly leave… and go far away. Like this, she would be able to truly extricate herself from Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p><em>Lu Lingzhi wants to use Ye Yaoyao to regain Mo Rongzhan’s trust, right?</em> Ye Zhen firmly gripped Mo Rongzhan’s robes as she thought, <em>I will definitely not let him succeed. He wants to use Ye Yaoyao as a pawn, then I will make sure she is unable to become one(pawn).</em></p>
<p>“Are you willing to strangle me?” Ye Zhen said as she opened a pair of watery eyes. The long eyelashes glimmered with a layer of mist, and Mo Rongzhan’s heart was about to melt away.</p>
<p>He dipped his head, sucked and kissed her pink lips, and said in a hoarse voice, “I want to meld you into my body so that you can never leave me.”</p>
<p>The corners of Ye Zhen’s mouth curled up into a proud smile, and she rubbed his arms a few times, “Hmm… Do you think I’m beautiful, or is Ye Yaoyao beautiful?”</p>
<p><em>This little barrel of vinegar!</em> Mo Rongzhan laughed and pinched the tip of her nose as he said, “Who in this world can look better than you?”</p>
<p>“If you like a person, you’ll naturally think she is the best looking. If you like Ye Yaoyao, she will definitely be better looking than me.” Ye Zhen pouted as she grumbled, “You can’t let her into the palace in the future, you are not allowed to see her, you are not allowed to like her…”</p>
<p>“You haven’t even become my empress and yet you’re so overbearing?” Mo Rongzhan was enjoying her rare display of arrogance and coquetry, his eyes were brimming with such love, that even he had not noticed.</p>
<p>She glared at him fiercely and demanded, “Then do you agree or not?”</p>
<p>“If you want me to agree, it must have a benefit,” his thin lips pressed against her ear as he said hoarsely.</p>
<p>“You really like Ye Yaoyao, and you think in your heart that she is the savior you have in mind. You think that she is beautiful and heavenly, and you will definitely summon her to the palace as a concubine in the future,” Ye Zhen cried out in grievance, struggling to leave his arms.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan hugged her tightly and said, exasperated and helplessly, “There is no girl more unreasonable than you in this world. When did I say that I liked her?”</p>
<p>“I will not like it in the future either,” she declared and hugged his neck, her cheek pressing against the side of his neck.</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>She alone made his heart spin, twirl, and whatnot, where was the leisure to like other women?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled mischievously as she said, “A gentleman* does not go back on his words.”</p>
<p>(*She says 君 <em>jūn</em> which could mean any of these: monarch; lord; gentleman; ruler. Guess it is a pun of sorts)</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan couldn’t help but break into a peal of laughter, he held her face and kissed her.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Having spent these few days and nights together, Ye Zhen knew Mo Rongzhan better. She gleaned he was softhearted and gentle all along. And should she say something to make him unhappy, as long as she spoke gently to coax him or took the initiative to kiss him, he would clam down swiftly. However, if he was too furious, he would not talk to her for an extended period of time nor would he tease her.</p>
<p>Knowing how to get along with him, left Ye Zhen a little confused. Faced with Mo Rongzhan’s favor, her heart was in contradiction. Which woman would not like to be spoiled and doted on like this? But she actually knew too well in her heart that there was still a chasm between them that could not be crossed.</p>
<p>Between them lay a dead Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen no longer wanted to try to make Mo Rongzhan accept her former self. Anyway, he already had a preconceived notion, unless everything was revealed, he would never believe her words.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t divulge just yet… She couldn’t afford to gamble.</p>
<p>Only when Lu Lingzhi was truly reduced to nothing would she tell Mo Rongzhan the whole truth, and then, whether he believed or not believe would have nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s good mood did not last long. On their way back to the capital, they received a message that Lu Lingzhi had returned and that his remnant poison hadn’t flared up. No one knew where he went to detoxify, in short, he was no longer tormented by Qitiantong*.</p>
<p>(*name of the poison)</p>
<p>“Lu Lingzhi has the ability.” Mo Rongzhan’s handsome face flashed a meaningful shallow smile.</p>
<p>“Who exactly did he find to detoxify?” Ye Zhen asked expressionlessly, this news was definitely the worst news for her.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan lowered his gaze to look at her and asked, “You’re not happy? It seems you don’t like your eldest brother very much.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t want her emotions to look too obvious, but she just couldn’t pretend to be happy. She grabbed Mo Rongzhan’s hand and rubbed it gently saying, “I just don’t like him.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t like him, you don’t like him.” Mo Rongzhan smiled and said, “But the fact that he can secretly find a way to detoxify, is still not simple.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was not a simple person, and who would know this better than she who had experienced his scheming firsthand? She had paid for it with her life.</p>
