            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 6 -Phoenix (1)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen had a long dream. A dream of her past life and her sister’s, leaving her a rather forlorn feeling at her wake. The details were so vivid that she felt like she was actually there looking at a tanned girl with hair swaying amidst the howls of the wind while she laughed her heart out as her brother slipped on a slimy rock.</p>
<p>Almost abruptly, the sight became distorted and she found herself in familiar territory, dressed in wedding robes she couldn’t possibly forget. A terrible choice that day was, she realized. She tried to flee from the scene, but even before she could, her dream took another turn.</p>
<p>A shift in her surroundings and she was no longer dwelling upon the memories. Instead, she found herself in a stark white place that seemed to be dismally empty and endless. Out of nowhere came a phoenix – the exact phoenix from her jade pendant! It bore the same flaming feathers, singing a sweet, soothing tune all over her.</p>
<p>She stretched out her hands, the phoenix willingly settled on her right palm as it changed dramatically into a palm-sized bird which came pecking, almost lovingly, her tender palm. Then, it turned into a flame and disappeared into her hand.</p>
<p>For some inexplicable reason, Ye Zhen seemed to have heard the phoenix telling her that it would be her protector hereon as the fire slowly died down…</p>
<p>Then she woke up and heard people talking beside her bed.</p>
<p>“Father and Mother are worried… are you feeling well now?”</p>
<p>She heard Lu Xiangzhi’s voice.</p>
<p>“Why did your sister suddenly faint when she was already getting better?!”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming’s deep voice could be heard as he threw his son a death glare.</p>
<p>Although she was only their adopted daughter, she was raised as though she was no less than their own. Since her childhood, Lu Yaoyao’s character was already somewhat unruly but her innocence was still that of a child. For sure, she had a jovial time, with all the freedom and support she received from them. But now, Lu Shiming saw that his daughter lost a lot of weight in just half a month of her illness. But what’s even more concerning was her noticeable loss in her interests.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi didn’t know exactly why Ye Zhen fainted. He told his father about what he was speaking to her before she lost consciousness, but before he could even finish speaking, Lu Shiming had kicked him hard.</p>
<p>“You fool! You didn’t come to your sister with your senses barred in your mouth. When did your sister ever hear of beheading? You… !”</p>
<p>Seeing the chaos, Pei Shi couldn’t help but interject in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Both of you! Don’t make too much noise!”</p>
<p>The father and son immediately ceased and looked at Ye Zhen with the same worried faces.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao’s pulse is much calmer than in the morning, but she is still too weak. She needs to be nurtured further.” Pei Shi’s heart was beyond relieved to see her daughter’s health slowly improving.</p>
<p>“Help me change her clothes.” She ushered the maid.</p>
<p>When he heard his adopted daughter was all right, Lu Shiming saw that there was already nothing to fuss about. So he hauled his son by the ear out of the room, leaving his wife to look after Ye Zhen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was able to go out after half a month of Pei Shi’s care. After this period of recuperation, she became soberer and calmer. She was reborn in her sister’s body, a fact that she came to accept. She went back in time, two years to be exact.</p>
<p>This was her destiny; the heavens had given her a second chance at life.</p>
<p>At this time of the year, autumn was pervading. The cool breeze, sunshine, and the gentle rustle of leaves were only some of the few things the people enjoyed in this season. Standing on the steps of the courtyard, Ye Zhen looked at the large house with carved beams and sturdy build.</p>
<p>Today was her first time spending autumn, not within the comforting confines of her own home, but the enclosure of her enemy’s proud abode.</p>
<p>She was deep in her musings when all of a sudden, she felt a tingle in her hand. She looked down and examined her right palm. This was the palm where the flaming phoenix appeared in her dream. The image of the phoenix was lifelike, a phoenix with wings ablaze.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, the flaming phoenix was not visible on her palm. What was left was just an image of the phoenix, like a tattoo imprinted deep into her skin.</p>
<p><i>Is it true that the phoenix merged with my hand just like in my dream?</i></p>
<p>She didn’t know if she was truly going crazy, but when a red drop from the phoenix’s eye began to materialize, she began to panic internally.</p>
<p>With haste in her steps, she went back inside the mansion and asked a maid to fetch her some water. The drop of red liquid then fell into the clear water and instantly lost its color.</p>
<p>“Is everything all right, Third Miss?”</p>
<p>The maid serving Ye Zhen saw her intensely staring at her hand and could not help but ask anxiously, thinking that the girl who came from the border town was indubitably strange. She was always hiding in the yard and unwilling to go anywhere. She also refused to engage herself in conversations.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen clenched her hands and managed to plaster a smile on her face. “I am done, you can now take the basin away.”</p>
<p>The maid nodded and went out of the hall carrying the basin.</p>
<p>The flowers and plants in the courtyard had withered, so the maid diligently poured the water all over.</p>
