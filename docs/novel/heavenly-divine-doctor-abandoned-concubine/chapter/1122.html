            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 207 – In the Same Bed (2)</strong></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu stole a furtive glance at the slumbering Ye Zhen in Mo Rongzhan’s arms and decided against divulging this secret. Since the moment he had laid his eyes on this little girl, his discerning eyes had seen her in a favourable light. To him, she was industrious, humble, and quite talented. As if to prove him right, today, she had even inadvertently cured the emperor’s eyes.</p>
<p><i>However, if she were to enter the palace, the wang fei would not take it lying low.</i></p>
<p>Not long after he came out of the chambers, he saw a figure scurrying over in the dark. As the person drew closer, he was stunned; he couldn’t help the look of surprise flashing on his otherwise impassive face.</p>
<p>“This eunuch greets the wang fei.”  He had long stoved away his shock and returned to his usual self.</p>
<p>The other part did not reply, not that he minded. He was all too familiar with this personage’s attitude. But when he saw Lu Wushuang about to rush into the chambers, even the ever servile him took a step forward to block her advance.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, the emperor is resting. What can I do for the lady that she visited the Palace of Heavenly Purity in the middle of the night?”</p>
<p>“Dog slave, step away!” Lu Wushuang knew that it was Eunuch Fu who went to the little prince’s residence to fetch maid. Now, she was disgusted at the sight of him and made it amply evident through her stance.</p>
<p>However, the ‘dog slave’ stood rooted to the ground, guarding his master’s interests with all his loyalty.</p>
<p>“If the lady wants to see the emperor, she needs to let me in to report it.” He was neither haughty nor humble, but he made it clear that he was not letting her in.</p>
<p>“When did I ever need to announce my arrival to the emperor? You shameless eunuch, have you come to block me? Get out of my way!”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang’s eyes were crimson with rage. The more Eunuch Fu stopped her, the more she felt that Mo Rongzhan was hiding something. She was determined to uncover the truth now.</p>
<p>She winked at Dai Ping commanding her and the other attendants to stop Eunuch Fu. Then, she gathered her skirt in her hands and marched away.</p>
<p>Miffed at the happenings, Eunuch Fu commanded the eunuch next to him to stop her. He had always thought that the wang fei thought too highly of herself. She was arrogant and conceited who looked down upon everyone, including the empress dowager. However, if she just barged in like this, would the emperor just let her be?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>As early as when Lu Wushuang appeared, Mo Rongzhan knew of her presence. He looked down at the Ye Zhen in his arms and remembered that she had been slapped by the other the last time. If Lu Wushuang knew that the person here was her, she would not let her off this time.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan gently placed Ye Zhen on the bed, making her lie slightly on her side.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen who had been deep in sleep knew not what the din outside was about. Suddenly, she opened her eyes and woke up.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen: “…”</p>
<p>She blinked and looked at Mo Rongzhan in front of her. <i>Am I dreaming? How could I sleep beside him?</i></p>
<p>He was supporting her head in one hand, facing down at her.</p>
<p>“Don’t make any noise.” Mo Rongzhan whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt uncomfortable. She sat up in a hurry and found that her clothes were all neat. She felt relieved.</p>
<p>“I want to go back.” She then started getting off the bed.</p>
<p>Hearing the fast-approaching footsteps, Mo Rongzhan immediately held her in his arms. “Do you want Lu Wushuang to see you here?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her head in astonishment, understood what he meant, and even so, glared at him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was amused by her lovely appearance.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Your Majesty!” Lu Wushuang’s anxious voice sounded. She had walked in thought the curtain without waiting for Mo Rongzhan to come to her. She was desperate to know if there was a woman on the dragon couch right now.</p>
<p>When Lu Wushuang appeared, Ye Zhen deftly buried herself under the quilt. She must not let Lu Wushuang see her, otherwise, she would certainly use more vicious methods to deal with her.</p>
<p>­­Mo Rongzhan grabbed Lu Wushuang’s hand that was reaching for the quilt and shoved her roughly.</p>
