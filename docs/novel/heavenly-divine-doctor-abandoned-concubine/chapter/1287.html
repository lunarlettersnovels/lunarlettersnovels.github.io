<p>Ye Zhen went to the woods with her bow and arrows. Tang Zhen followed suit, watching her with keen eyes, observing her every move and trying to discern if she could really hunt.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8">
<div class="orp-player-wrapper aspectRateFixed orp-player-ipm orp-player-ipm-hidden defaultTag notMobile force-hide-player"></div>

<div id="adplus"></div>
<p></p></center></div>
<p>He had seen women hunting before, but most of them wanted to show off their kindness in front of the man they liked. Some were more cruel than men. Both young and pregnant animals were all shot mercilessly.</p>
<p><i>This girl is different though,</i> he thought to himself.</p>
<p>The more Tang Zhen looked at Ye Zhen, the more he felt that he <i>liked </i>her. It was really strange that he had just laughed at Lu Lingzhi. When he knew that this girl was his sister, he felt very lucky.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not know what Tang Zhen was thinking while walking behind her. Upon sighting a male deer, she stopped to find a hiding place in the woods.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen also found several sika deer in the woods. He turned to look at Ye Zhen. Although he didn’t mind giving her the silver whip, if he really lost, he would also lose his face.</p>
<p><i>Ah! The embarrassment of losing to a girl!</i></p>
<p>But he promised to give her three arrows.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen has picked up her bow and arrow and aimed at a male deer that seemed to have just had a fight. He didn’t look alert and was licking the wound on his leg. Male deer often fight for female deer during this season.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s eyes fell on Ye Zhen unblinkingly. He felt that the third miss bore a likeness to the late wang fei, Ye Zhen; not only with their looks but also with their ardor in hunting.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was a woman who was kept in a deep family, so she was raised to be an ideal noble woman. Lu Yaoyao, however, was not as beautiful as Ye Zhen but she was more vivid and brighter than Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lu Wushuang didn’t know what Ye Zhen looked like, or Lu Yaoyao would not be allowed to stay in the capital the moment Lu Wushuang noticed their resemblance.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s black and clear eyes glowed with burning determination as she pulled the bowstring full and quickly released the arrow from its position. Before it could reach the male deer, she had swiftly shot a second arrow.</p>
<p>Hearing the string whooshing through the air, the male deer jumped up in shock, dodged the first arrow but could not hide behind the second and third arrows. Each arrow hit the crucial parts, rendering the deer lifeless on the ground. It died a quick, painless death.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi laughed and was glad that his sister was more accurate than before. “Yaoyao, your archery is better than before!”</p>
<p>That was for sure. Lu Yaoyao did not have any training while Ye Zhen was taught by her father. If Lu Yaoyao was not sent away, she would probably be better than Ye Zhen!</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked a little sad and Lu Lingzhi looked at her with concern. “Why, are you not happy to win?”</p>
<p>The competition between her and Tang Zhen was without much suspense. Tang Zhen said that she would have three arrows. Even so, she  was confident she would still have won without Tang Zhen taking easy on her.</p>
<p>“Oh Brother, we’ll take the male deer back and make a coat of deerskin for Grandmother,” Ye Zhen said to Liu Xiangzhi.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi nodded and moved the male deer atop his horse. Tang Zhen has also shot a male deer, even though the competition was over. He had lost anyway.</p>
<p>“I lost to my third sister,” he said, convinced that the young miss’ horsemanship and  archery are remarkable.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “Thank you for your silver whip.”</p>
<p>“Only when you call me Brother Tang Zhen will I give you the silver whip.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen had retrieved the whip from his waist dramatically as though he had to give it to the beautiful miss as a gift.</p>
<p>“Marquis Tang, don’t be shameless.” Ye Zhen frowned.</p>
<p><i>Since when did she have all these brothers?</i></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi cast a cold look at Tang Zhen. “If one gambles, one must be willing to lose!”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen broke into  laughter before shaking his head and offering the silver whip to Ye Zhen. “Please accept it, Third Sister.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took the silver whip and put it into her horse’s bag. “Thank you, I like the silver whip.”</p>
<p><i>Who doesn’t like such precious treasures?</i></p>
<p>“Do you still want to continue hunting?” Tang Zhen asked.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi tried to stop Ye Zhen from agreeing.</p>
<p>However, Ye Zhen on the other hand didn’t find the idea so bad, she hadn’t been so carefree in a long time. She just wanted to take this opportunity to relax.</p>
<p>Deeming Ye Zhen’s silence as a yes, Tang Zhen gleefully fetched her horse for her. “Third Younger Sister, please.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked back at Lu Xiangzhi. “Brother, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi smiled and nodded back to see Lu Lingzhi reluctantly mount his horse, seemingly planning on going with them. He laughed.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, you haven’t fired an arrow yet!”</p>
