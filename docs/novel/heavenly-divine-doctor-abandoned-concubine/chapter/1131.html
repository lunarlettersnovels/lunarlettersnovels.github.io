            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 196 – It Was Meant For Her (2)</strong></p>
<p>Although the place where Ye Zhen’s temporary place of residence was the room where the palace maid lived, this single room looked very comfortable and pleasing to the eye. It was not as elaborate as a royal’s chambers, but did not lack anything. No commoner could say this place was for a maid. But indeed, this was where the palace maids like Madam Nuan lived.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, we have arrived. If you need anything, just tell your maidservant,”  Madam Nuan said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “Okay, thank you Madam Nuan.”</p>
<p>“This servant will take leave now. You must rest.”</p>
<p>Madam Nuan was very courteous to the Ye Zhen whom she very much admired. <i>Such medical skills at such a young age, how extraordinary!</i></p>
<p>Not long after Madam Nuan left, Qi Jin visited Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi?” Ye Zhen was a little surprised and quickly offered Qi Jin a seat inside the room.</p>
<p>“Well, was that medicated meal also from the Qi Medical Classics?” Without mincing words, Qi Jin directly addressed the doubts she had in her heart.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gently shook her head in negation. “No, the medicated diet… it is this one’s own recipe. Imperial Physician Qi, is there something wrong with the meal I made?”</p>
<p>“No, you did well.” Qi Jin smiled and nodded, “Better than mine.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had a hunch that Qi Jin was trying to probe, but she did not know what it was about. Albeit, she looked at the other in perplexion.</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, I’m not sure what you’re up to…”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, can I ask you a question please?” Qi Jin’s mellow voice sounded.</p>
<p>“You may ask.” <i>What does </i><i>Imperial Physician Qi</i><i> want to know?</i></p>
<p>Qi Jin looked at her gently. “I want to ask… about the Qi Medical Classics<b>. </b>Where did you get it from?”</p>
<p>“Qi Medical Classics? It is a book my mother gave me. Imperial Physician Qi, is there any problem with the book? “</p>
<p>“No. There is no problem. I was just a little curious. This is a very good book. You should study it well,” Qi Jin said with a smile.</p>
<p><i>Maybe Pei Shi was not aware that she had such a special book, the </i><em>Qi Medical Classics</em><i>. Otherwise, she would not have kept it so casually. But, any fine physician would know the significance of this book… </i></p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, Have you not read the book?” Ye Zhen was surprised. In Qi Jin’s tone, she had unmistakably recognized her yearning for Qi Medical Classics.” The book in my family should only be a transcript.”</p>
<p>Qi Jin laughed. “There is no transcript of Qi Medical Classics in this world, only your copy.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was utterly shocked. She thought that the medical books she read every night were just transcripts.</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, I… did not know.”</p>
<p>“Keep it,” Qi Jin said nothing more.</p>
<p>She had once been a zealous young girl who had decided to dedicate her life to medicine. And she did. As a member of the Qi clan, she was privy to the existence of her ancestor’s magnum opus. She also knew that this treasure was lost. No one knew of its whereabouts nor had it appeared anywhere. In her quest to satiate her hunger for knowledge, in vain, Qi Jin had looked for the book. But after she had given up all hope of finding this priceless jewel, fate had played an uncanny trick.</p>
<p>Qi Jin was not someone conceited. She knew she was getting on in the years, and although she still possessed the fervor for learning, it was not feasible for her to fulfill her lifelong wish. All she could do was draw solace in the fact that the<b>《</b>Qi Medical Classics<b>》</b>had not been lost. It lay in worthy hands.</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, I will return the<b>《</b>Qi Medical Classics<b>》</b>to you,” Ye Zhen said earnestly.</p>
<p>Such words were hardly expected. Qi Jin was inexplicably moved. As a descendant of Empress Qi Yanling, she had naturally hoped that the book would be kept in the Qi clan or the Huangfu clan. However, seeing the calm and sincere Ye Zhen, she just smiled and said, “No, it is in its rightful place.”</p>
<p>Now, she was certain. <i>Perhaps this </i><b><i>is</i></b><i> her fate. Perhaps this young lady really possessed extraordinary talent in medicine and the book was meant for her. No wonder, no one else could find it.</i></p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was ill at ease. All these days, she was oblivious to the origins of the book. She had treated it as just any book. But now that she knew what it really was, and the fact that its lawful owner was before her, she was ethically bound to return it.  Moreover, Ye Zhen had already memorized the content of the book. Even if the book was returned, she had already learned what she ought to have. So it did not matter.</p>
<p>“Maybe… that journal was destined for your hands.” Qi Jin reiterated with a smile. She was someone who believed in fate.</p>
<p>However, fate’s chosen one was somewhat embarrassed. If not for her rebirth and subsequent transmigration into her sister’s body, she would not have had the opportunity to even know of this book to mention nothing about learning from it. But how could she say she was undeserving? It was indeed vexing.</p>
<p>Qi Jin sensed that the other would stubbornly harp on returning the book, so she deftly turned the topic away.</p>
<p>“The last time you saved my grandson, I was not able to thank you.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi is too polite. This student merely did what one ought to do,” Ye Zhen said with a smile.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>While the master and pupil were happily engaged in a conversation there, here the latter was being reported on.</p>
<p>Inside the imperial study, Mo Rongzhan listened attentively to Eunuch Fu’s account on Mo Rongyi.</p>
<p>“… The little prince had two bowls of porridge. He felt no pain and has been sleeping for some time now.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan raised his eyebrows slightly. “Two bowls of porridge and sleeping soundly?”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu replied gloomily. “Replying to the emperor, yes, the little prince did not suffer pain again after eating the porridge Miss Lu cooked. And the empress dowager was very happy.”</p>
<p>“It seems that she is not useless.” <i>Had he underestimated Lu Yaoyao?</i></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu thought back to the girl he had first seen in the medicine field. She was so engrossed in researching those herbs, that she did not even sense his presence. Back then, he had felt she was not someone ordinary. But today, Lu Yaoyao had displayed her capability in full glory. She had not only alleviated the pains but had also calmed the little prince enough to sleep soundly.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan stood up and brought him out of his musings.</p>
<p>“Let’s go and see Yi.”</p>
