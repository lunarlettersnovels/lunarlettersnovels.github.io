<p>Before he could forget, Lu Xiangzhi asked Ye Zhen for another bottle of the medicine she gave.</p>
<p>“I just applied it twice and today, I found that my wound is covered in scabs already! Eldest Brother still can’t walk, you should also give him one. He is <i>our</i> eldest brother.”</p>
<p><i>He is your eldest brother, but he will never be my eldest brother!</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen replied with utmost disinterest. “I wanted to give him, but Zhuangzi did not have the ingredients I needed. The bottle I gave you was still from our home.”</p>
<p>“What herbs do you need? I’ll bring it to you.” Lu Xiangzhi immediately said, thinking that Chengde Mountain Villa’s forests might have the herb she used to concoct the medicine.</p>
<p>“Those ingredients are not easy to find. Let me go up to the mountain tomorrow to find out if there is any,” Ye Zhen said vaguely.</p>
<p><i>She would like Lu Lingzhi to become crippled, how could she use her lingquan<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup> to cure him?</i></p>
<p>“In fact, everyone has a different physique. My medicine can cure your injury, not necessarily the elder brother’s.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi looked at her sister carefully. “Yaoyao, I think you don’t like Eldest Brother very much.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said with a grievance, “Brother, I am different from you. You used to live in the capital and you and Eldest Brother knew each other for a long time! But I am not yet familiar with him. It is really hard for me to treat him like you. Last time, he didn’t allow me to go to the academy, how do I urge myself to like him?”</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother does things for your own good. Ah, you will not believe me now, but you will know after getting along with him for some time. He is an excellent person.” Lu Xiangzhi sighed.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and nodded. “I know, I will get to know my eldest brother slowly.”</p>
<p>“I must go. Tomorrow the emperor will return to the palace. Mother said she would bring Eldest Brother to Zhuangzi for two days.” Lu Xiangzhi finished.</p>
<p><i>Mo Rongzhan is returning to the palace?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen breathed a sigh of relief from the bottom of her heart. She didn’t have to worry about meeting him again!</p>
<p>She wanted to become an imperial physician and would have to see Mo Rongzhan often in the future. By that time, she would be prepared.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen accompanied Lu Xiangzhi to the gates and returned to her chambers afterwards. She read a book for a while and looked down at the flaming phoenix tattoo on her palm.</p>
<p>There were still ten good days before the exam. She knew that with her present appearance, many people would surely think of Ye Zhen when she appeared in front of the public.</p>
<p>However, Lu Yaoyao and Ye Zhen looked somewhat different. In the two years she was married to Mo Rongzhan, she did not live very happily. In addition to missing him every day, she also restrained her temper and became unhappy. During that time, she had a good-looking appearance, but she had no spirit at all. She was really very different from Lu Yaoyao now.</p>
<p><i>Yaoyao… </i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the person in the mirror, her eyes were brighter and darker than hers, and the shape of her face was somewhat different.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyebrows and eyes were like their father’s while Lu Yaoyao’s were more like their mother’s. Probably because of drinking the <i>lingquan,</i> her skin was ruddier and white, and the temperament of the whole person different.</p>
<p>In comparison, the late Wang Fei Ye was dignified and reserved while Lu Yaoyao was charming and lovely, more like a lovely little girl.</p>
<p>Actually, when she hadn’t married Mo Rongzhan, she too was charming. Now, she didn’t need to be miserable because of someone nor restrain her temperament for anyone.</p>
<p>She was Lu Yaoyao and Ye Zhen at the same time.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen dropped a drop of the <i>lingquan</i> in her teacup. Since it was inevitable that the entrance examination would attract attention, she planned to appear in front of everyone beautifully.</p>
