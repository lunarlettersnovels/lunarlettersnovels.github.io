<p>Hong Ling repressed herself from crying and knelt in front of Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Young Miss, that bastard Lu Lingzhi! Didn’t he—”</p>
<p>“It’s a long story. But first, you have to get up so we can talk,” Ye Zhen said in a hushed tone, “There is one thing I have yet to tell you…”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen helped Hong Ling to her feet, the latter bore inquisitive, teary eyes.</p>
<p>“I had a twin sister who was sent away when she was still a baby. That’s why my mother always disliked me… I was poisoned by Hong Yan and died. When I woke up, I became the Third Miss of Lu Family.”</p>
<p>A gasp was heard from Hong Ling immediately.</p>
<p>“If you don’t believe me, I can’t possibly blame you. It’s a mystery I myself can’t explain.”</p>
<p>Even Ye Zhen herself was still muddled by her transmigration and the regression she went through. Waking up in the body of her sister and finding herself back in time, was all beyond her understanding.</p>
<p>How could she expect everyone to believe her and not think that she had lost her sanity?</p>
<p>But far from the reaction she expected, Hong Ling immediately shook her head. “Miss, this handmaiden believes you! Did you already forget? Master Pu Sheng once said that your life was as thin as paper, but it was worthy! Said you would die and transmigrate! At that time, Old Madam Ye was livid upon hearing it, so she drove him away! Don’t you remember?”</p>
<p>This left Ye Zhen into a state of stunned confusion. It had indeed happened in the past—Master Pu Sheng, who used to work in the Ye Mansion, had told her things that her grandmother referred to as too crass for her delicate, young mind.</p>
<p>But the memory of this happening was vague in Ye Zhen’s mind. She could only remember that her father told her at that time that Master Pu Sheng’s words couldn’t be trusted, and her fate could be changed by her own hands.</p>
<p>However, now she lived in her sister’s body. <i>Is this supposed to be her fate?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen sighed deep in her heart. It was futile to say all these things now.</p>
<p>“These are not important. Have you never seen Lu Lingzhi grace this place?”</p>
<p>“He thought that this handmaiden had been burned to death. How could he know that I am still alive in this world?”</p>
<p>This earned a satisfied nod from Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Do you know the whereabouts of my father, the Second Lord, and my brother, the Second Young Lord Ye?” Ye Zhen asked in a low and hopeful voice.</p>
<p>“The handmaiden went to the execution ground quietly that day and didn’t see even the shadow of the Second Lord and Second Young Lord Ye. Could they have escaped?” Hong Ling asked; she had always thought of this.</p>
<p>A glimpse of hope bud in her heart upon being reminded of this possibility.</p>
<p>“They might have, and I can’t think of anyone but you whom I should task to find them. I’ll leave this matter to you and to other servants who live here in Jinkou City. Let them investigate secretly about my father and brother.”</p>
<p>Hong Ling looked at Ye Zhen worriedly. “Miss, what will you do now?”</p>
<p>“Lord Lu Shiming is my sister’s adoptive father. I can’t just leave the Lu Family. My chances of revenge are higher with my sister’s family,” she said lightly.</p>
<p>“If Lu Lingzhi gets to know that you’ve been here… will he hurt you?!” Hong Ling asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled slightly and assured her in a calm voice. “He won’t know.”</p>
<p>Still brimming with concern for the miss whom she lost long ago, Hong Ling couldn’t help but ask again, “Miss, since the tragic event, your servants have been very angry and threatened to avenge you. Do you want to meet them?”</p>
<p>Her servants were all hand-picked by her father and were loyal to her naturally. However, if Hong Ling told them the truth, they might not believe her.</p>
<p>“If you can’t tell them my true identity, you can just say that I am Ye Zhen’s sister. Before Ye Zhen died, she was able to tell me everything. You can tell them this and that, and when they believe you, I will come here and see them.” Ye Zhen’s voice sank a little.</p>
<p>These people were loyal to her and if they knew Lu Yaoyao was her sister and therefore, a daughter of Ye Yiqing, they would perhaps subject their unparalleled devotion to her.</p>
<p>They had a master now; this was the sole thing they needed to believe at this moment of need. She would let them all think that even though Ye Zhen was already dead, her legacy would live in the person of her twin sister Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Yes Miss, this handmaiden knows what to do.” Hong Ling responded in a determined voice. Then, she was silent for a moment. It took her a while to speak again.</p>
<p>“Miss, how are you doing at the Lu Family?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gave a sincere smile. “I am doing just fine.”</p>
