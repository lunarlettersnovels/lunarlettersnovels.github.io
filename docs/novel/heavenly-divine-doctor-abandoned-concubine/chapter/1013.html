            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 316 – Winning Over (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Princess Furong!</em></p>
<p>Though the imperial edict had yet to be passed, Ye Zhen still knew that her status would be different from this point on. The last time she had consciously turned down the title of viscountess for it would never near enough something that could help her attain her goals. However, a princess was different. And she admitted that this was also something unexpected.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps it was time to change her plans for revenge…</em></p>
<p>Originally, her plans were based off on her attaining the position of an imperial physician. While on one hand, it would enable her to come in contact with the empress dowager and gain her trust, on the other she could gain an insight into the workings of the imperial court. Especially the most important officials. The higher their standings in court, the more privileges they were bestowed; one of them being the services of the imperial physicians. Admittedly, it was a meandering path, but one that a female of this era could tread to come closer to the imperial palace- that is if she didn’t want to be a part of the inner palace.</p>
<p>Ah, but if she became a princess, would she still be able to become an imperial physician?</p>
<p>Although Ye Zhen had a deep-seated desire to bring ruins to Mo Rongzahn’s empire, the pragmatic her was well-aware this was an impossible feat. She was clear in her heart of the end she wished Lu Wushuang and Lu Lingzhi, but Mo Rongzhan … she still did not know what to do to quench the raging hatred in her heart.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Miss Lu.”</p>
<p>While Ye Zhen was lost in thoughts by the lake, Xu Huiru had unknowingly arrived at her side.</p>
<p>The empress dowager and Old Madam Lu had walked but for a while before feeling tired, and were now sitting in a cool pavilion, resting. Ye Zhen had spotted a couple of herbs she had needed by the lake and as such asked the empress dowager to excuse her before coming over to pick them. Thinking of her new status as Princess, she couldn’t help but sigh in wonder at the sudden turn of affairs. However, the reason this imperial consort was by her side now was beyond her.</p>
<p>When Xu Huiru had arrived, her kissing up, care, and concern towards the empress dowager- none of it had missed Ye Zhen’s notice.</p>
<p>“Imperial Consort Xian.” Ye Zhen bowed in greeting, not really wanting to converse with Xu Huiru here. This woman was different from others after all, in that she had an actual understanding of Ye Zhen. After all, this woman was once her rival. As such, she was unwilling to let slip in her presence and reveal the slightest flaws in her disguise. So the less they interacted, the better it was.</p>
<p>“This should be our second time meeting. The first time I saw you, was at the academy. I was truly taken aback.” Xu Huiru was all gentle and polite now, a stark contrast to her cold and proud demeanour from that day.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew she was courteous because of Empress Dowager, she could see right through her facade. “Yes. When I first arrived at the capital, I had heard of Imperial Consort Xian’s good reputation. But, who would have thought that on our first meeting in the school, I would scare you.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru looked at Ye Zhen. “That is because you look extremely alike to one of my old acquaintances.”</p>
<p>“Qin Wang Fei?” Ye Zhen smiled and asked.</p>
<p>“You know?” Xu Huiru looked at her with surprise.</p>
<p><em>Ah, Lu Yaoyao knows she looks like Ye Zhen, yet still dares to appear before the empress dowager, and even enter the palace?</em></p>
<p><em>Does she not know Ye Zhen is taboo to almost the entire capital, and that almost no one dares to mention her?</em> <em>Not to mention that she looks so similar to her!</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen feigned a look of confusion. “Yes, people have told me of the resemblance. Imperial Consort Xian forgets, Teacher Shan was once Ye Zhen’s teacher.”</p>
<p>“Then you….” Xu Huiru wanted to ask her why she still dared to approach the empress dowager, but she quickly understood. Perhaps the Empress Dowager had never seen Ye Zhen. She had heard that even the emperor had never seen her, so it was possible that his mother wouldn’t have seen her either. As such, they wouldn’t know that the two resembled.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru lightly laughed. “Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone about this. Actually, not many people in the capital have seen what Ye Zhen looked like. After she became Qin Wang Fei, she rarely went out.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen thought it was funny. <em>Was Xu Huiru wishing to kiss up to her, and win her over?</em></p>
<p>“Imperial Consort Xian, then I will thank you for keeping my secret,” she politely said.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu… no, I should call you Princess now, you need not be courteous. We are going to be family not long from now,” Xu Huiru said, smiling.</p>
