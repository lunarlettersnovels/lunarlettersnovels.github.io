            <p><strong>Chapter 486 – Riot</strong></p>
<p>Presumably, someone noticed that the people in the sedan chair were unusual, and their voices started getting louder and louder. They rushed towards it. There were too many to tell whether there was someone secretly instigating it.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned her head to look at the man. “Did you capture these people and keep them from going back like this?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji said with a cold face, “When this iron ore work is done, I would naturally let them leave.”</p>
<p>“In ten or eight years, can this iron ore be completely dug up?” Ye Zhen asked, “Do you want to deprive these people of seeing their relatives for ten or eight years? You are really cold-blooded.”</p>
<p>“I would give them a great reward, these eight or ten years would allow them to be carefree for the rest of their lives,” Zhao Tianji said in a cold voice.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pointed to those outside with injured heads and bleeding and insisted on going home. “Did you hear what they were saying? They have wives whom they’ve just married, old parents, and some children in the family who are waiting to be fed, and you do not want them to see them for eight or ten years.  Who knows what the situation will be like in eight or ten years. Perhaps they will not see them in their lifetime? You can’t blame them for being homesick, there is no one who wants that. ”</p>
<p>“Even if I don’t go home for ten years, I don’t think I’ll miss it,” Zhao Tianji said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him with pitiful eyes. “Then I really sympathize with you, you are actually a person without a home, even if you have a home, it is certainly not like home, there is no warmth at all.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji finally looked directly at Ye Zhen. “Lu Yaoyao, don’t think that I really won’t kill you.”</p>
<p>“Looks like I’m right,” Ye Zhen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“You…!” Zhao Tianji had an urge to strangle her, if it weren’t for his legs and her treatment, he would have killed her!</p>
<p>His home on the island was nothing to be nostalgic about, except for a big brother who only thought about inheriting the legacy of his ancestors all day long, an elder who did not treat him as a person, only wanting him to keep doing things, and those islanders who did not know why they regarded them as gods, he knew not what there was to miss. If he could, he wouldn’t want to go back to that island for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>The people outside were getting noisier, and Qiu Yuan had already led people to suppress them.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man who was at the front cried that he wanted to go home to see his dying mother. “Please, I’ll go back to see my mother for the last time, and I’ll come back when I’m done…!” he cried out.</p>
<p>Qiu Yuan said loudly, “Back then, you signed a contract with Master. You can’t go back without finishing the iron ore work, do you want to violate the contract?”</p>
<p>“We don’t want silver anymore, we’re going back.” Someone shouted.</p>
<p>“Yes, we’re going back!”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned and looked at the scene outside feeling that if he couldn’t calm down these people something would definitely happen. “If you don’t promise them, I’m afraid it won’t work,” she looked at him and said.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji said coldly, “Then let them all die.”</p>
<p><em>This person wants others to die at every turn, and it seems that many people have been killed before him.</em></p>
<p>“For you, is there no other way to solve things than killing people?”</p>
<p>“It’s the fastest way,” Zhao Tianji justified.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, murder!” Suddenly, there was a scream outside.</p>
<p>Those who hadn’t been clamoring to go back followed suit, and it turned chaotic outside.</p>
<p>“Someone is injured!” Ye Zhen said, “If you really kill people, then you must kill everyone here!”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji snorted, “Kill them all.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him and said seriously, “Island Lord Zhao, now that the weather has gradually become hot, and you intend to kill so many people at once… Who is going to bury their corpses? If you just throw them here, in a few days, it will definitely stink, and then cause plague… You certainly can’t mine here, maybe even your own people would die of the plague.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to let them go so they reveal this location?” Zhao Tianji asked with a sneer.</p>
<p>“They must have come in blindfolded, too,” Ye Zhen retorted, and then got up to try to get off the sedan chair.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji grabbed her hand. “Where do you want to go?”</p>
<p>“Island Lord Zhao, I am a doctor, when I see someone injured in front of me, I can’t turn a blind eye. I am different from you, not a cruel person,” Ye Zhen said coldly.</p>
<p>“How many can you save?” Zhao Tianji snorted coldly and tossed away her hand.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t know how many people she could save, but she felt that she could save a few.</p>
<p>Qiu Yuan was still trying to stop the riot, several people were seriously injured and had fallen to the ground groaning in pain.</p>
<p>“If you dare to make a squeek, you will join your family(in the grave)!” Zhao Tianji’s voice sounded deeply, he didn’t say it loudly, but everyone heard it clearly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was stopping the bleeding for a man with a head injury, when she heard his words, she only frowned and sighed softly in her heart.</p>
<p>Probably because of Zhao Tianji’s threat, gradually, the noisy people quieted, helplessly and desperately looking at the sedan chair.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t bring much medicine, she hadn’t expected to encounter such a scene, so she could only do simple bandaging. She didn’t know that, as she moved, a pair of eyes hidden behind the crowd, were seethingly watching her.</p>
<p>She hadn’t changed her guise, was just dressed very plainly, and her face was deliberately smeared with medicinal juice, it didn’t look as stunning, nonetheless, she was still beautiful. Many people’s attention was on the people inside the sedan chair, and they didn’t notice Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bandaged the injured people one by one, the last one only had an arm injury. She looked at the man and shook slightly, the man’s gaze seemed to be somewhat familiar.</p>
<p>However, seeing his ordinary facial features and rough skin, she was very sure that she had never seen him before. His eyes were too sharp, and he was very aggressive, which made her very unhappy.</p>
<p>“Is there any injury besides the arm?” Ye Zhen asked expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” he whispered back, his eyes glistening as he looked at her..</p>
<p>Ye Zhen suddenly looked up at him. <em>This voice… Mo Rongzhan?</em></p>
<p>“Miss, are you a doctor?” The man’s voice suddenly became thick, as if the low, mellow voice just now was not from him.</p>
<p>“I am.” Ye Zhen took a deep breath and lowered her head to bandage his arm, and the shock in her heart was already rolling up like a raging wave.</p>
<p><em>It is actually him! How could it be him?</em></p>
<p>“Well, try not to hurt your arm again these days.” Ye Zhen whispered, and when he withdrew his arm, his fingers gently scratched her palm.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s cheeks were slightly red, she had a lot of things she wanted to ask him, but she couldn’t say a word at the moment. Qiu Yuan had already come behind her.</p>
