<p>Ye Zhen learned to feel less complicated about everyone. From her first resistance, she had gradually been able to please and deal with them with ease.</p>
<p>She knew that her identity would be eventually revealed. She was a daughter of the Ye Family and was destined to have a deep blood feud with the Lu Family.</p>
<p>But at present, she’s only Lu Yaoyao, the daughter of Lu Shiming and his wife.</p>
<p>In the evening, the whole family gathered at Old Madam’s courtyard.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stood behind Pei Shi. She had received too much attention today. Not a servant had an incredulous look when presented with the sight of her, unable to believe her change.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu turned to Lu Shiming and said these words: “Your second brother is already on his way. He said he would come back to celebrate my birthday this year. When he arrives, we will be truly reunited!”</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen my second brother for years,” Lu Shiming said with a nostalgic smile.</p>
<p>Second Lord Lu took over the business of the family. Although the Lu Family had long advanced from being merchants, the trade at sea was one thing the Second Lord could not let go. He took his wife and daughter to do business in Jinkou City.</p>
<p>“If my husband were still here, then the family would be completely reunited.” Wearing plain and light clothes, Eldest Madam<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup> Lu named Lui Shi sat by and said faintly.</p>
<p>The cheerful atmosphere in the room froze because of Liu Shi’s words.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked up at Eldest Madam Lu. Today was the first time she saw her in person. When they arrived in the capital, she was ill, so the old madam didn’t let her come. But for the sake of welcoming the return of her son, Lu Lingzhi, she personally chose to join the current reunion.</p>
<p>It was said that since the death of the Eldest Lord Lu, Liu Shi had been unhappy. Old Madam Lu handled the family’s big and small matters,</p>
<p>The only person who could still make Liu Shi care was Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>“Mother… Father has not left us all this time. He lives in our hearts,” Lu Lingzhi said gently to his mother.</p>
<p>Liu Shi glanced at him then looked at Lu Shiming darkly.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid some people think he’s dead.”</p>
<p>“If you are still not feeling well, go back to your room and rest. Don’t be delirious and say things that people don’t understand.” Old Madam Lu spoke flatly.</p>
<div data-fuse="22037344116" data-fuse-code="fuse-slot-22037344116-1" data-fuse-slot="71161633/WORD_wordexcerpt/chapter_incontent_2">
<div id="fuse-slot-22037344116-1" class="fuse-slot">As a response, the woman just smirked. Liu Shu used to fear the majesty of Old Madam, but now she had become unafraid of anything.</div>
</div>
<p>Her son was already a high-ranking official, who had lifted the whole family from being mere merchants to nobles. Without her son, she surmised, <i>how could the Lu Family have the glory they so enjoy today?</i></p>
<p>“Mother.” Eldest Madam Lu addressed Old Madam, her mother-in-law.</p>
<p>“I’m just telling the truth. How many people in this family still remember what the Eldest Lord paid for this family at the beginning? But some just enjoy the benefits then complain in their hearts.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming became an imperial secretary now, but if not for his late eldest brother, who sold his name on the top list of passers during his younger years to a governor’s son, Lu Shiming could have become more.</p>
<p>In Liu Shi’s eyes, this man had detested her husband until his very death and could’ve been the reason for her husband’s then failing health.</p>
<p>These people, she thought, were not qualified to enjoy the glory brought by her husband, daughter, Lu Wushuang and son, Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>But Old Madam’s heart was partial to no side, and she loved her youngest son, Lu Shiming, even though he left his home.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi frowned at his mother. “Mother, please don’t say it. Everyone in this family remembers father.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Sister-in-law, the events of that year… have passed, let’s all forget it,” Pei Shi also said softly.</p>
<p>“Of course, the Lu Family is different now. The third household came back immediately when you saw the benefits. If none of the success happened, would you still be pleased to join us with smiles?” She snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“Eldest Sister-in-law, you have misunderstood. I didn’t come back because the Lu Family is different now, but I came back to pay filial piety to my mother. If you think we are in the way of you, we can move out.”</p>
<p>“Move out? That’s nice to say, but don’t go telling everyone that this family has hurt you.” Liu Shu sneered.</p>
<p>“Silence!” Old Madam Lu banged her fist on the table in great anger and looked coldly at her eldest daughter-in-law.</p>
