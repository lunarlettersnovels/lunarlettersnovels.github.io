            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 358 – It Won’t Affect You (1)</strong></p>
<p>If it was in the past, Mo Rongzhan would not have hesitated to answer ‘Yes, zhen will marry that little girl, confer her as the empress and give her a lifetime of honor and love’. However, looking at Lu Yaoyao now, he hesitated.</p>
<p>“When you thought that Lu Wushuang was the little girl, why didn’t you confer her as your empress?” Ye Zhen pointedly asked. She was aware that she was being aggressive and that she shouldn’t ask so many questions, but she simply couldn’t stop herself. She just wanted to know the answer.</p>
<p>She had been asking these questions a countless times in her heart. And now that she had the opportunity to question the man himself, she naturally didn’t want to miss it.</p>
<p>“It never occurred to zhen to confer her as the empress.” Mo Rongzhan whispered. Even when he thought that she was his little girl, he did not consider making her his empress. For in his heart was a faint inkling that she shouldn’t be one.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him with a smile and asked, “Then, what will you do to the little girl who saved you, should you find out she is not what you think she is? Will you still treat her as well as ever?”</p>
<p>“Zhen will make the decision after finding her.” Mo Rongzhan stated. He had learned his lesson with Lu Wushuang. Therefore, he would not make a hasty decision again.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled faintly and stopped asking him any further questions. Besides, she should stop at this point and leave it at that. Anyway, whether he would doubt Lu Lingzhi or not depended on his own thoughts.</p>
<p>“Are you bothered about how zhen is going to treat that little girl, hm?” Mo Rongzhan eyed her with a meaningful smile. <em>Her tone was a little off today… Could it be due to jealousy?</em></p>
<p>“That’s only natural. If that little girl does appear, then won’t that mean that Gui Fei Lu will be completely out of favor and may even implicate the Lu Family,” she lightly said.</p>
<p>“No matter what happens in the future, it will not affect you,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of not implicating me? There are still my grandmother, my father, and my mother besides me—”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was not that great a person to want to save the whole Lu Family. However, that didn’t mean she was an ungrateful person either. As such, she was still willing to repay those who were kind to her. Especially Lu Shiming and his wife. After all, how could her younger sister have a happy life without them?</p>
<p>“Greedy girl!” Mo Rongzhan laughed, a cold glint laced his eyes.</p>
<p>Today, Lu Yaoyao’s words made him realize that he had never once suspected people would conceal things from him. After all, for Lu Wushuang to be able to get his jade ornament and speak such a big lie and to his face indicated that there must be someone helping her from the shadows. <em>But who exactly was that person?</em></p>
<p><em>Lu Lingzhi?</em></p>
<p>He was the only person to come to mind. After all, apart from him, there was no one else in the Lu Family who had the means to pull off such a thing. Still, if Lu Lingzhi really did it, then it would be even more difficult for him to find Yaoyao. <em>Perhaps… that little girl might not be in this world anymore.<br>
</em><br>
“I got it!” Ye Zhen suddenly exclaimed, pointing to the Go game. “See, I have solved it.”</p>
<p>Her silver-bell-like laughter rang out, it was teeming with joy. In this serene and quiet hall, it seemed to be particularly melodious and pleasant to the ears. Mo Rongzhan looked at her and smiled. The haze that surrounded his heart suddenly dissipated as if there was a warm current chasing it away, and his mood turned into a cheerful one.</p>
<p>“A step back?” Mo Rongzhan studied her move carefully, a little surprised.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and explained, “Since there is no way forward, let the piece die and resurrect again. Take a step back for now, break both his left and right arms, and smash a bloody path to victory.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded his head. “That’s right. Zhen didn’t think of such a method at that time.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care. You said you’ll let me go to the Library Pagoda when I solve the game.” Because she was too excited, Ye Zhen momentarily forgot that the other was Mo Rongzhan as she unexpectedly revealed the coquettish and charming side of a little girl.</p>
<p>“Zhen didn’t say that zhen wouldn’t let you go to the Library Pagoda. However it’s already dark now. You can come to the palace tomorrow and go there.” Mo Rongzhan said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t plan on coming out until I’ve seen enough this time,” Ye Zhen said stubbornly.</p>
<p>“Only one day.” Mo Rongzhan raised his eyebrows at her. If he hadn’t enticed her with the promise of letting her browse through the library as she pleased, would she be willing to spend her time with him playing Go? He didn’t believe that to be the case. So, of course, he would set a limitation. This way, he would always be able to further tempt her into spending time with him alone.</p>
