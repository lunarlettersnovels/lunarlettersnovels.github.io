            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 176 – Snow (2)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen dipped her head and took a sip of the hot tea. Her voice sounded somber as she continued. “There will always be a first time for everything. Before Empress Qi Yanling appeared, female imperial physicians were unheard of. Nothing is impossible as long as you set your heart on it.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao is right, it is possible that you can become a physician in the army.” With a smile on her lips, Chen Jinru concurred.</p>
<p>At her friends’ words of encouragement, Sun Wen soon put away her pessimism and donned her usual enthusiastic smile. “It is fate for the three of us to meet here. I, Sun Wen, propose a toast to you with tea instead of wine.”</p>
<p>“Good!”</p>
<p>Amidst gleeful laughter, three cups rose in the air.</p>
<p>Thus began Ye Zhen’s journey at the School of Medicine. In her heart, she knew all too well, the future days here would be anything but calm. However, such things did not deter her. Now, the only unsettling thing was Lu Wushuang’s unpredictable schemes.</p>
<p><i>Would Lu Lingzhi protect her from his sister’s wrath? Or would it be the same as before; him removing all obstacles for Lu Wushuang?</i></p>
<p>And by obstacles, she meant <i>herself.</i></p>
<p>Her journey had only just begun; she did not wish for it to end this soon. With her current status, she had no ability to compete with Lu Wushuang. She could only protect herself with the aid of others. However, even Old Madam Lu was away from her now.</p>
<p>However, in any case, now that she had taken her first step, she would keep going. No one could stop her.</p>
<p>The next day, Ye Zhen woke up at dawn. She pushed open her window, only to be greeted by a fluffy, white blanket of snow.</p>
<p>She stretched out her hand; reveling in the feel of snow gliding across her palm. <i>Today, I should meet the teachers at the school. </i>She somehow harboured some expectations.</p>
<p>Snow brought peace to many. But in this moment–basking in the first light of dawn, besieged by a soothing silence–Ye Zhen felt none.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>As she stepped into the school, she met Gao Xueping. The resentment still fresh, she shot Ye Zhen a cold stare, held up her chin in reserve, and walked away.</p>
<p>The corners of Ye Zhen’s mouth slightly lifted as she came to Class B.</p>
<p>Sun Wen and Chen Jinru had also arrived. They were both wearing thick robes. Seeing her friend enter, Sun Wen waved vigorously.</p>
<p>It being the first day, all the students in the academy were in attendance. As Ye Zhen walked in, she could clearly feel some students stealing glances at her, scornfully eyeing her.</p>
<p><i>Were they despising her for evicting Gao Xueping from her room using underhanded means yesterday?</i></p>
<p>Oh, she did not give a whit about what others thought of her at all! It did not matter to her anymore.</p>
<p>Not long after Ye Zhen was seated did a middle-aged man slowly enter. Dressed in a cotton-padded jacket, he looked simple and neat. Though he emanated a very upright aura, as a teacher, he seemed approachable.</p>
<p>“I am surnamed Qin. You can call me Doctor Qin or Master Qin, whichever you prefer.” He sat down in the plush chair behind his desk and added. “It is snowing, the medicinal fields are closed, so there is no need to visit the fields today.”</p>
<p>The students stood up in concert and respectfully greeted Qin Fuzi.</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi motioned with his hand. “Have you read the introductory book I asked your teacher to hand you yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, you should also pay attention to your aptitude in studying medicine. The first thing you need to assess is your skill in identifying herbs. Since you cannot go to the medicinal field, you will take a test here,” Qin Fuzi said.</p>
<p>As soon as they heard an examination was to be held, a few students broke into whispers. <i>Who knew they would face an examination on their second day of academy?!</i></p>
<p>“Bai Song, Jing Tian, Mu Rong.” Qin Fuzi read the names of three herbs, squinted and said with a smile, “Describe their appearance, define their names, and the symptoms of the diseases they can cure.”</p>
<p>The words of the master had hardly landed when Huang Fuxiang spoke up. “Master Qin, we have never started class. How do we take the exam?”</p>
<p>Without deigning to even look up, Qin Fuzi answered this incidental query. “Yesterday, I asked Su Xinmei to hand out the introductory book. Today, you are supposed to go to the medicinal field to identify herbs. Have you not read the book all day?”</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang was speechless. However, there were some resentful glares sent towards the Su Xinmei sitting on the side.</p>
<p>“Silence, examination!”</p>
<p>And with that, the master set things in stone.</p>
