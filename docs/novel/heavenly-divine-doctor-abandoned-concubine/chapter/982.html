            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 347 – Sneaking into the Boudoir at Night</strong></p>
<p>When Ye Zhen returned to her chambers, she saw that Yu Ping had already prepared a hot bath for her. She nodded approvingly. These past few days, she had been unable to have a good bath on the road. Now that she was finally back to the capital, she could be at ease.</p>
<p>“You all go out.” Ye Zhen sent Yu Ping and Dai Mei to clean up her room.</p>
<p>Once the maids left, she took off all her clothes and checked on the scabs on her inner thigh. In order to avoid having to look at Lu Lingzhi all the time, she had insisted on riding. In the end, her legs bore the brunt of her wounded heart’s unwillingness.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she had <em>lingquan.</em> She had diligently spread it on the wound every day. Otherwise, she would not have been able to walk now.</p>
<p>Sitting in the water, Ye Zhen focused on the mark on her palm. Soon, many drops of  <em>lingquan </em>dripped into the bathwater. She leaned on the edge of the tub, closed her eyes and immersed her weary body. It was a long time before she felt her taut muscles ease. Refreshed, she went to her room and saw Dai Mei had prepared some snacks along with light food. However, she just drank a bowl of millet congee and chicken soup, not even touching the other things.</p>
<p>She then grabbed a book and read for a while before exhaustion hit her. She was so sleepy that she was unable to hold on and soon fell asleep on the bed.</p>
<p>She was simply too tired. While she was at Jinwu City, she had always worried about Tian Jiu and his people getting caught. Then, when she was on the roadback, she had to face Lu Lingzhi. In short, she was unable to have a good rest during that period of time.</p>
<p>In the dead of the night, wrapped in a tranquil air, Ye Zhen was sleeping soundly. It was not only her courtyard that was calm. The ambience of the entire Lu Mansion was serene all thanks to Lu Lingzhi’s return. Now, without the panic and uneasiness that had permeated the family in the past few days, everything seemed to be very peaceful and quiet.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, a dark shadow appeared and walked silently into Ye Zhen’s courtyard. Yu Ping, who was sleeping right outside her mistress’s room, didn’t hear a thing nor had any chance to stir from her sleep as the figure released a burst of fragrance pushing her into a deeper sleep than normal.</p>
<p>The shadow then came to stand beside Ye Zhen’s bed. At this time, the faint light from the moon seeped through the window and illuminating her being.</p>
<p>“This little girl has lost a whole circle of weight,” the shadow said to no one in particular, sitting down while gently touching her smooth cheek.</p>
<p>The moment he did that, Ye Zhen unconsciously frowned and knitted her brow. The shadow touched a little point on her neck making her fall into a deeper sleep.</p>
<p>“Even when you’re asleep, you still keep your guards up… Are you that insecure?” a deep voice asked with a smile.</p>
<p>The owner of this voice was, astonishingly, Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>Dressed in black from top to bottom, Mo Rongzhan’s figure almost melted into the night. However, the moonlight soon shone on his handsome face and accentuated his eyes which looked almost like a morning star in the night sky. He was looking at the slumbering girl with glowing eyes.</p>
<p>With a sigh, he lay down on the empty side of her bed and half-embraced her. “Do you hate me so much? Why didn’t you tell me when you went to Jinwu City?”</p>
<p>Alas, only Ye Zhen’s rhythmic breathing answered his question.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s face slowly drew closer to her cheek and gently kissed. His arms could not help but hold her waist even tighter, bringing her body closer to his.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen whimpered. Uncomfortable, she turned her head unconsciously, avoiding his kiss. However, she still didn’t wake up.</p>
<p>“You won’t even let me touch you even when you’re asleep, huh?” Mo Rongzhan’s breath was somewhat short as he murmured.</p>
<p>He hadn’t touched a woman for a long time now, to the point he thought he was a man who was uninterested in self-indulgence. As such, he only sought to carry on with the family line. But regardless of how he tried, he had no strong desire. It was only after he met her that his latent desire seemed to surge making it difficult for him to control and manage.</p>
<p>He buried his face in the crook of her neck and breathed in the sweetness of her body. His heart was thumping so loudly it seemed it was about to jump out from his chest while blood seemed to be coursing in a frenzy.</p>
<p>The woman in his arms was akin to a mature peach emanating a charming fragrance, enticing him to devour her completely. Neither could he put her down nor bear to let go.</p>
<p>“Wu—” Ye Zhen let out an uncomfortable sound, her eyelids moved a few times as if she were about to wake up.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan hurriedly let go of her, gulping as he gasped for breath. He waited until the restless feeling in his body died down and Ye Zhen fell back into a deep sleep again before he held her again. However, for fear of waking her up, he dared not move too much. Simply tasting it for a while before leaving.</p>
<p>Right then, his gaze fell on her thighs. His heart raced and eyes heated up. He’d heard she was injured, so he came, wanting to take a look. Just that the location of the injury was… He wasn’t sure if he would be able to calmly let her go if he saw it.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, he reached towards <em>that</em> area. His slender fingers were trembling slightly as he untied her underpants.</p>
