            <p><strong>Chapter 437 – As Expected, She’s Jealous (1)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen lightly leaned on his chest. To tell the truth, it wasn’t that she was not excited or grateful to him when she knew that she had let them go. However, these gratitudes were not enough to make her forget the pain of her tragic death, let alone forget how she had fallen out of favor and had to bear the loneliness of being left out by him in the Qin Wang Mansion. Never in this life of hers, did she want to live like that again.</p>
<p>“You being so… Does this mean you have forgiven <em>zhen</em>?” he asked her expectantly.</p>
<p>She was silent. She didn’t know how to describe the sadness in her heart. When she was Ye Zhen, she loved him so much, for him she disregarded the opposition of her family, but he had ended up ignoring her. Now she was Lu Yaoyao, he was willing to tolerate her in this way.</p>
<p><em>Should she be happy? </em>But she couldn’t be happy. The more Mo Rongzhan wanted to get Lu Yaoyao, the more he wanted to make her empress, the more she couldn’t accept it.</p>
<p>When she, as Ye Zhen, who had loved him the most, hid in the house mourning and crying every night, did he know how much she had missed him at that time? Now, she was in Lu Yaoyao’s body. She was Ye Zhen, who was once lonely and all alone with nowhere to express her grievances. She already… could not afford to love him anymore.</p>
<p>“I remember,” she said. She didn’t want to answer his question.</p>
<p>Although a little disappointed in his heart, Mo Rongzhan believed that the future was long. Since she already knew the truth, she would accept him one way or another. The time right now was vain.</p>
<p>He took her out of the tub, wiped her dry, and clothed her.</p>
<p>“Your back injury… Have the stitches already been removed?” Ye Zhen realized that he had taken the white cloth apart. She turned around to look at his wounds. The hideous scars revealed how badly he had been injured that day. Her heart sank.</p>
<p>He smiled and said, “A’Chen said that it is recovering well.”</p>
<p>“The shoulder is bleeding,” she said in a low voice, she should have just caught him.</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine with some medicine in a while.” Putting on his robe, he hugged her and walked out.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen blushed and said, “You put me down, I can walk by myself!.”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu, somehow, already had someone tidy up the outside. No one would be able to see what had just happened.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt even more embarrassed,as if she had done something bad and had been discovered.</p>
<p>“Sit down and I will apply the medicine again,” she pushed him and said.</p>
<p>♚♚♚</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her face that showed how she was still somewhat resistant to his advances and knew in his heart that he could not act too impatiently. So he put her down with a smile, stretched his legs out, sat down on the carpet, and asked her to give him medicine.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen held the snow lotus ointment and looked up at his generous and strong back and thought to herself… <em>What should I do next? One year?</em></p>
<p>She had never thought that she would marry him again, or that he would be so determined in winning her over. She was already a princess after all.</p>
<p>“Now I am a princess…,” she lowered her head and said, “how can I marry you? The empress dowager would not agree.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan said lightly, “<em>Zhen</em> agreed to confer the title of a princess on you, then naturally, this is surely not a big problem for <em>zhen. Zhen</em> can stop you from being a princess at any time.”</p>
<p>“What reason will you use to revoke my title?” Ye Zhen said grimly. “You, don’t think that you can just randomly accuse me of any crime.”</p>
<p>“That is how you think of <em>zhen</em>?” He chuckled in a low voice. “<em>Zhen</em> settled you for a crime, but that didn’t ruin your reputation, so how can you become an empress?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen snorted. “There are too many people who want to be your empress, why must it … have to be me?”</p>
<p>“I just think you are the most suitable,” he said.</p>
<p>She thought back to the tenderness and affection he had shown Xu Huiru yesterday and couldn’t control the force of her fingertips. “I think there is someone more suitable.”</p>
<p>He turned around and held her hand. “Your tone sounds sour. Are you perhaps jealous?”</p>
<p>“For what reason would I be eating vinegar?” She shook his hand away. <em>How could she be jealous because of his actions?</em> <em>He can dote on whoever he loves.</em> <em>What does it have to do with her?</em></p>
<p>[TL/N: Eating vinegar is another way to say ‘so and so is jealous/ you ate vinegar, you are jealous’ in Chinese.]</p>
<p>“Obviously you are jealous.” He hugged her waist. “Tell <em>zhen</em>, what is there to be jealous about? Who can ever compare with you?”</p>
<p>She yelled in embarrassment. “Mo Rongzhan, let go of me! You are not allowed to use your hands.”</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> only said one year.<em> Zhen </em>didn’t say that he can’t kiss you or hug you during this period.” He lightly pecked her puffed-up little cheek and his mood immediately became happy.</p>
<p>“You! …I won’t enter the palace anymore if you do this.” She exclaimed in a huff.</p>
<p>At long last, Mo Rongzhan had finally coaxed her back. He didn’t want to make her angry with him again, so he let go of her first.</p>
<p>“Well, <em>zhen</em> won’t hold you anymore.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s talk.” She was sitting in a dangerous position so moved and sat at the furthest distance possible from him. “Do you know where my father is?”</p>
