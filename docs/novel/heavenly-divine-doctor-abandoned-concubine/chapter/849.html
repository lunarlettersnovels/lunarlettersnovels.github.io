            <p><strong>Chapter 481 – She Is My Wife</strong></p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked a little dazed. He lowered his eyes, and a trace of sadness flashed across his handsome face.</p>
<p>“Master?” Ye Zhen turned her head to look at him. Seeing that he was just silent, her curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>“Mu Xue is the younger sister of an old friend,” Huangfu Chen said lightly. “If she is by Zhao Tianji’s side, you must remember to be more careful.”  ”</p>
<p>“Master, what’s the relationship between Mu Xue and Mu Qing?” she asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>At the mention of the name that had crossed his mind for many years, Huangfu Chen’s eyes darkened. He looked at the little girl for a while before saying in a low voice, “Mu Qing is my former wife, and Mu Xue is her younger sister.”</p>
<p><em>Wife?</em> All along she had known Mu Qing held a special place in her Master’s life. She reckoned she was his childhood sweetheart or perhaps beloved, but never had she thought she would be his wife.</p>
<p>“Where did she go?”</p>
<p>He smiled faintly. “I don’t know either.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t know what to say. She had heard people mention Mu Qing and seen her Master’s expression change. She had already surmised that she was very important to him but didn’t expect… it would be like this. “Master, why did Madam… leave you?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen, such a fine man, a blessing to whoever marries him. Why would Mu Qing be willing to leave him?</p>
<p>He looked at the sky outside and said, “It’s not early, you’ve been tired today. Go back and rest early.”</p>
<p>“Master, I’ll leave now.” Ye Zhen too had fallen in love with someone before. She knew that sometimes it wasn’t easy to talk about the wound in one’s heart.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen returned to the Peach Blossom Garden. Right as she walked to the door, she saw Mu Xue who had just been in Zhao Tianji’s room.</p>
<p>“Gone to report the Second Young Master’s condition to Huangfu Chen?” Mu Xue’s lips curled into a cold smile. Her eyes were filled with killing intent as she looked at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Miss Mu, did you come looking for me?” she asked lightly.</p>
<p>Mu Xue snorted coldly. “Did Huangfu Chen let you approach the Second Young Master?”</p>
<p>“You want to know so much, why don’t you ask my master?” Ye Zhen took a few steps forward and indifferently looked at Mu Xue, who was blocking the door. “Can you stop blocking?”</p>
<p>“Don’t think that you’re amazing just because you have some medical skills. Go back and tell Huangfu Chen, what if he tried his best? Mu Qing is already married to Eldest Young Master, so it’s impossible for her to return to his side. If he dares to harm Second Young Master, I won’t let him off,” she said coldly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wanted to ignore her and was about to walk into the room when the other’s words fell. “What did you just say? Mu Qing married your eldest young master?”</p>
<p>Mu Xue nodded and smiled proudly. “Huangfu Chen still doesn’t know about my sister’s marriage to Eldest Young Master. You can go back and tell your master that he should stop dreaming that my sister will return to his side. Originally, my sister came to him to have him cure Eldest Young Master’s illness. Now that he is free from worries, she will naturally return to his side.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes flashed with anger. She didn’t know what had happened between Huangfu Chen and Mu Qing, but from what Mu Xue said, she(MQ) had already married someone else. It wasn’t that she had gone missing without reason. <em>If Master were to know this, he would definitely be very sad.</em></p>
<p>“Since your sister was to marry someone else, why didn’t she tell my master?” Ye Zhen asked indifferently.</p>
<p>Mu Xue chuckled. “That’s funny. Since she used Huangfu Chen, why would she tell him? However, he didn’t die despite being injured by Eldest Young Master and disappearing for many years. If he dares to take revenge on Second Young Master, I won’t let him off.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to judge a gentleman’s belly with the heart of a villain. My master is different from you,” she suppressed the anger in her heart. Then, she walked into the room and slammed the door shut.</p>
<p>“You…!” Mu Xue was furious. Lu Yaoyao actually dared to call her a villain.</p>
<p>Liang Yin walked out from the side and stopped Mu Xue before she could break into Ye Zheng’s room. “Have you forgotten the kind of temper Second Young Master has?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that Second Young Master will protect her?” she humphed coldly. She would not kill this woman, but just keep her alive at most*.</p>
<p>[*aka she will torment her in other ways]</p>
<p>“If you dare to touch her, Island Lord will not let you and your brother go,” Liang Yin warned her in a low voice.</p>
<p>Mu Xue’s expression changed and her tone became even more furious. “Why? Could it be that Second Young Master is interested* in her?”</p>
<p>[*as in has a crush/fancies]</p>
<p>Lu Yaoyao’s appearance was devastating, but so what? Second Young Master was never someone to indulge in beauty. She did not believe that he would be tempted by her(LYY)!</p>
<p>“Because she is Huangfu Chen’s apprentice!” Liang Yin said coldly.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t Second Young Master hate Huangfu Chen?” Mu Xue asked reluctantly.</p>
<p>Liang Yin said, “Island Lord and Huangfu Chen were originally friends. If he(IL) hated him, he would have been killed long ago. Mu Xue, have you forgotten Huangfu Chen’s identity? Even Eldest Young Master wouldn’t dare to kill him. It’s all thanks to the great kindness of the Huangfu Clan’s ancestors that the people on our island can live up to this day. If you dare to go back on your word and kill him, you should try!”</p>
<p>Mu Xue thought back to their oath and Huangfu Chen’s identity on the island and snorted. “I won’t kill Huangfu Chen. I’ll kill his apprentice.”</p>
<p>“Even if you kill Lu Yaoyao, Island Lord wouldn’t like you.” He pushed her away. “If you still want to stay in the villa, you’d better behave yourself.”</p>
<p>“Liang Yin, you dare stop me!” Mu Xue was even more furious when she was exposed.</p>
<p>Liang Yin just stood expressionlessly below the steps. Otherwise, Mu Xue would have come closer to Ye Zhen’s room.</p>
<p>She snorted coldly. She did not believe that she would not have the chance to kill Lu Yaoyao in the future.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who was inside, listened to the conversation between the two(outside). Now, she was even more curious about Huangfu Chen and Mu Qing’s past.</p>
<p><em>If Master knew Mu Qing had married another person, he would definitely be very sad, right? Was Mu Qing really only using Master and hence got close to him?</em></p>
<p>She was full of doubts, but no one could help her solve them.</p>
<p>The next day, she went to take Zhao Tianji’s pulse early in the morning. It was the same as yesterday, but his stiff hands were much better.</p>
<p>“Don’t sit around when you have nothing to do. It’s better if you go out and move. Otherwise, you can bask in the sun. You don’t need acupuncture today. Find a stronger person. I’ll teach him to massage the meridians throughout your body. In the future, you’ll have to massage it every day before you go to sleep,” she told Zhao Tianji.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji glanced at her. “Your medical skills are taught by Huangfu Chen?”</p>
<p>“Not all of them.” She replied, “My mother is also a doctor.”</p>
<p>“How much do you know about your master?” he asked.</p>
<p>She retracted her hand that was used to take his pulse and looked up at him. “Island Lord Zhao, do you want to tell me about the grudge between you and my master?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji snorted coldly. “If your master didn’t even tell you, why should I tell you?”</p>
<p>“Then why are you asking me?” Ye Zhen snorted angrily. “You should have someone come in and open your meridians.”</p>
