            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 314 – The Favored Xianfei Xu (2)</strong></p>
<p>Since entering the palace, Xu Huiru had never shown any arrogance and impulsiveness. Even though the emperor went to her palace the most times, she came to Cining Palace to greet her as usual. Such a woman was very suitable for living in the palace. The empress dowager liked her gentle and dignified temperament as well. It would be better if the emperor could also like her.</p>
<p>“His Imperial Majesty deals with a myriad of state affairs every day. I only hope the emperor will have a comfortable place to rest when he comes to the inner palace,” Xu Huiru said softly.</p>
<p>The empress dowager nodded with satisfaction. “You are right to think so.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru said with a smile, “Empress Dowager when one came here just now, one saw that the flowers in the imperial garden were blooming very well. Tomorrow, I will accompany Her Imperial Highness to enjoy the flowers.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to Baihua Garden tomorrow—” The empress dowager paused for a moment. She thought that since she was bringing Lu Yaoyao to Baihua Garden tomorrow … If Xu Huiru went with her, she could also bring along the emperor. This way the emperor and Xu Huiru would feel grateful for the opportunity to get along with each other and perhaps he would see her in a more favorable light.</p>
<p>“Xian Fei Xu, if you have nothing to do tomorrow, come to the Baihua Garden with Aijia to enjoy the flowers,” said the empress dowager.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru raised the corners of her mouth slightly, bowed her head, and said, “Yes, Your Imperial Highness”</p>
<p>This matter somehow reached Lu Wushuang’s ears, and she almost stormed in anger.</p>
<p>“What a Xu Huiru!” Lu Wushuang clenched her teeth.</p>
<p><em>Seems like I belittled this bitch. Ah, Empress Dowager didn’t even see me while she was willing to see that bitch and ask her to go to Baihua Garden with her tomorrow!</em></p>
<p>“Your Highness, calm your anger. You’d better find a way to make Empress Dowager like you.” Aunt He advised.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang clenched his fist. “This wang fei won’t lose to her.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">♚</p>
<p>The sun was radiant and enchanting. As Spring blossomed, flowers bloomed in the Baihua Garden. It was a beautiful sight to behold.</p>
<p>Since the empress dowager was to enjoy the flowers here today, imperial guards were stationed to keep an eye on the surroundings, no one was allowed to enter without her permission.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen and Old Madam Lu were waiting by the waterside pavilion. When they heard the empress dowager’s voice, they stepped out of the pavilion to greet her.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Xu Huiru beside the empress dowager, Ye Zhen was slightly surprised. She reckoned she must be pleasing to the empress dowager’s eyes but wasn’t in the least bit surprised.</p>
<p>Although Xu Huiru was full of pride and vanity before everyone else, she had the knack of dancing with long sleeves* for those that were beneficial and useful to her. As such, more often than not, she left a good impression on people.</p>
<p>[*long sleeves help one dance beautifully (idiom); money and power will help you in any occupation]</p>
<p>“Ten thousand blessings to Your Imperial Highness.” Ye Zhen curtsied, slightly bowing her head, and then followed it with paying her respects to Xu Huiru. “This official’s daughter greets Xian Fei Xu.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, come here.” The empress dowager’s arm was originally held by Xu Huiru. When she saw Ye Zhen, she let go of the latter’s hand and motioned to the little girl to come over. “Were you scared that day by the moat?”</p>
<p>“No, Your Imperial Highness. Look at me… I look ruddy, I still eat well and have good night sleep. Where do I look scared?” Ye Zhen said with a smile.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu shot an angry look at her granddaughter and said to the empress dowager, “Look how big this child’s heart is! We were all frightened for her. Fortunately, she and Little Prince are fine. In the future, we’d better not go to such a busy place. There are diverse people out there, and we don’t know which among them have ill intentions.”</p>
<p>“Your grandmother is right. You can’t go to such a crowded place in the future,” said the empress dowager.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen immediately nodded. “Yes, Your Imperial Highness.”</p>
<p>Although Xu Huiru looked at them with a calm smile, her heart was rolling like waves. She knew that the empress dowager was fond of Lu Yaoyao, but she didn’t expect they were close to such an extent.</p>
<p><em>If Lu Yaoyao intends to enter the palace, perhaps there would not be a problem.</em> With Empress Dowager’s benevolence, she feared she couldn’t get the attention of the emperor all the more.</p>
<p><em>However, does Empress Dowager know that Lu Yaoyao has a resemblance with Ye Zhen? If Her Imperial Highness is aware of that, should she not like her so much?</em></p>
