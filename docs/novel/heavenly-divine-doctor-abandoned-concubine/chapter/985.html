            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 344 – I’m Sorry!</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen held her breath and started tracking from where the bloodstain spread. At last, she saw two figures hidden behind some grass that was half as tall as a man’s normal height.</p>
<p>One of the figures was a man holding a long knife and staring at her coldly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s gaze then fell onto the other figure. She was slightly startled at the sight on the unconscious man. <em>It was Tian Jiu!</em> She was very surprised to find that they had escaped from the city.</p>
<p>All the while, the man with the knife was staring at Ye Zhen tenaciously, a murderous intent brimming his eyes, ready to attack at any moment.</p>
<p>“Princess, I don’t see any Qijie grass around here,” a guard said as he came over to find Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“I can’t find it here either. Let’s go to the other side to check,” Ye Zhen hurriedly said, stopping the bodyguard from coming over.</p>
<p>When she looked back at the man again, she noticed him frowning at her, his hand still  tightly clenching the knife.</p>
<p>“Don’t go into the city,” Ye Zhen subtly said. She then took out a bottle of wound medicine from her bosom that was filled with <em>lingquan</em> and quietly threw it to the ground.</p>
<p>As long as they were not hiding in the city, and inside this mountain, Lu Lingzhi’s people would not be able to find them so easily.</p>
<p>The man with the knife didn’t know her. He wouldn’t do anything to her if she said nothing. However, if she were to say they were there, she didn’t doubt the guy would immediately kill her without remorse. As such, the choice was obvious to her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen then left the place with her imperial bodyguards and maid. When they arrived at the foot of the mountain, they happened to meet Lu Shiming and his group who were on their way back.</p>
<p>“I found a Qijie grass. Really, this thing was so hard to find that I almost gave up when I finally saw it,” Lu Shiming said with excitement. “Let Imperial Physician Qi try it first. If it is really useful, then we will have people to look for it everywhere.”</p>
<p><em>If people were to sent into the mountains to look for medicine, then wouldn’t it be easy for Tian Jiu’s location to be exposed? No good!</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen said, “Generally, this kind of Qijie grass doesn’t usually grow in cluster. It was already arduous for you to find one by the lake…  Perhaps it’ll be easier to find it in the mountain located more to the south than here.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming nodded. They had not been able to find it even after searching for a long time, and even the one they found looked wilted, so he didn’t doubt his daughter’s reasoning at all. “You’re right. Let’s return and talk about it.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Ye Zhen smiled while hoping that Tian Jiu and his colleagues could leave this place by today.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the city, they were about to go and find Qi Jin when they suddenly heard a scream of pain in Lu Lingzhi’s room. Startled, Lu Shiming and Luo You hurried over to check.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s residual poison had flared up, he felt as if ten thousand ants were biting his flesh. It was so painful that he could no longer endure it.</p>
<p>Qi Jin immediately asked the people to hold Lu Lingzhi’s limbs down, worried that the man would hurt himself by moving too much. She then used acupuncture to relieve the pain.</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi, we have found the Qijie grass.” Lu Shiming was so distressed seeing the pain his brother’s son was going through that he hurriedly brought over the herb and handed it to the physician.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, quickly take this Qijie grass and boil it. Then add it to the medicine Marquis Anyang used to drink,” Qi Jin said loudly.</p>
<p>Standing by the door, Ye Zhen was looking at the Lu Lingzhi on the bed writhing in immense pain. A sense of relief and pleasure washed over her heart. Compared to the suffering she had endured, what was his suffering worth?</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for Yaoyao?” Qi Jin cried out.</p>
<p>It was only then that Ye Zhen regained her senses and went over to get the Qijie grass in the other’s hand.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming didn’t think much about his daughter’s delayed response, only that she was frightened because she had never seen such a scene before. So he gently appeased her and said, “It’s all right. Your elder brother just needs to drink the medicine and he’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“Hm.” Ye Zhen nodded and turned to go out to brew the medicine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Qi Jin wanted to use more acupuncture to help ease Lu Lingzhi’s pain further, but the muscles in his body had turned so taut that she couldn’t insert needles in his acupoints at all.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen simply cooked the medicine and sent it to him. At this time, Lu Lingzhi was almost out of his mind due to pain, so none of the four big men holding him down was able to persist and accidentally let him go. Due to this, the wound on his body tore open soaking his  clothes with blood. It looked awkward and pathetic.</p>
<p>However, though her eyes took in this sight, it was difficult for Ye Zhen’s heart to feel even a smidgen of pity for him.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, let me do it,” Lu Shiming said, taking the medicine from her. He then ordered the servants. “You hold him down while I pour the medicine into his mouth.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen then went to help Qi Jin pack her things in order. She was standing close to the bed. So when Lu Lingzhi suddenly got the strength to hold her in his arms, she was stunned.</p>
<p>“Let me go!” Ye Zhen shouted angrily, having snapped back to her senses she pushed him away. Alas, it was futile!</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… I’m sorry…!”</p>
<p>In his trance, Lu Lingzhi hugged her even tightly, crying out apologies indistinctly. And though the others could not hear what he was saying, Ye Zhen did. She understood that his mind was so hazy that he took her as Wang Fei Ye.</p>
