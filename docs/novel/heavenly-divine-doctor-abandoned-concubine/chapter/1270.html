<p>Ye Zhen slept soundly, immersed in a dream. Or rather, a memory; of the day she got married.</p>
<p>Years of wishing – finally coming true! Only those who had been in love could understand how ecstatic she felt.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8">
<div class="orp-player-wrapper aspectRateFixed orp-player-ipm orp-player-ipm-hidden defaultTag notMobile force-hide-player"></div>

<p></p></center></div>
<p>Sitting inside her new chambers, she was looking forward to seeing Mo Rongzhan again after the ceremony. She would tell him that she was sick that year and couldn’t meet him in the forest.</p>
<p>Finally, she would tell him that she was the girl who saved him! Just the thought of it made Ye Zhen’s heart leap with joy.</p>
<p>He came in, tall and imposing, with a straight lean body and a face full of indifference. And when he stalked towards her – Oh! Ye Zhen’s breath hitched, completely overwhelmed by his presence, her face turning shades closer to red as he drew nearer.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was thankful for the red veil she wore for the wedding for it concealed her scarlet cheeks.</p>
<p>Standing in front of her, Mo Rongzhan swept off the veil from her head quite callously. Doing so, Ye Zhen looked directly at his face and couldn’t help but notice the unmistakable disgust plastered on it.</p>
<p>She tugged his robe by his arm and wanted to show him the jade pendant she had kept carefully for years. But she was surprised as Mo Rongzhan practically brushed her hand off as if her skin scorched him!</p>
<p><i>When he did that, what had he said?</i></p>
<p>Oh, she remembered perfectly.</p>
<p>In a calm voice, he said, <b><i>“The Ye Family is already beneath one man, Ye Yisong. Why do they need their first daughter married to this prince? Did they think that making you a wang fei would make a difference?”</i></b></p>
<p>Ye Zhen couldn’t speak, her mouth went dry. Everything went downhill at that moment, and she could only look back at the man she loved with big watery eyes.</p>
<p><b><i>“Well, they are mistaken.”</i></b></p>
<p>With that, he left and never returned to her chambers.</p>
<p>At that time, although she was hurt by his words, she still innocently thought that he would definitely change his mind after he knew who she was.</p>
<p>Facts proved that she was still naive, that confrontation didn’t as much dwindle her undying love towards him.</p>
<p>He went out on the second day of their marriage to fight a fierce battle. No one thought he would come back alive, let alone expect him to win the battle.</p>
<p>However, he still took 5,000 soldiers and went to the border. For two years until the death of the previous emperor, the Ye Family supported the new emperor to ascend the throne.</p>
<p>Within two months, Mo Rongzhan had succeeded in usurping the Dragon Throne and replaced the puppet emperor.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen dreamed again of what her father had said to her.</p>
<p><b><i>“Yaoyao, everything in this world is doomed. The Ye Family and the clan will be annihilated sooner or later. No treacherous court official in history can last this long. Even if that day comes, I will protect you and your brother.”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“Yaoyao, if your father leaves in the future, you should be at ease and wait, he will come back to you.”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“Remember our code. If anyone else in the world knows it, then he is surely a genius just like father! Hahaha.”</i></b></p>
<p>Then, as if she had seen a scene of blood soaring into the sky, all the members of the Ye Family died under a single charge.</p>
<p>“Father, Second Brother!” With the heart-piercing pain of ten thousand arrows, Ye Zhen woke up screaming her lungs out.</p>
