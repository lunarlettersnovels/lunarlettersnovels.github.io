<p>The next day, Ye Zhen got up early in the morning to prepare. Today, she was going to take part in the entrance examination at the Academy for Women.</p>
<p>She intently kept an air of nervousness; she was still a wild girl from the border town, being too confident would raise suspicions.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu purposely asked Lu Fang to accompany her. It also happened that Lu Jing didn’t have to attend classes today, so they all volunteered to accompany Ye Zhen to the academy.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t welcome Lu Jing’s enthusiasm. These sisters didn’t want to cheer for her–they clearly came to see a joke.</p>
<p>Today, Ye Zhen wore a fine, aqua, silk blouse. It had a graceful sprouting bud pattern on it, and stopped right at her waist. She had teamed it with an emerald green, floor length, pleated skirt made from western tapestry. The whole ensemble made her jade-white skin appear whiter; her bright eyes, thin eyebrows, and delicate features were even more pronounced. She looked like a beautiful painting. Just one glimpse, and the beholder would be captivated by her beauty.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked very pure and enchanting like an exquisite lotus fresh out of water; even Lu Jing couldn’t take her eyes off her.</p>
<p>She felt a twinge of jealousy in her heart. Even if Lu Yaoyao failed in everything, her appearance alone would be enough to make people remember her.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I have used your cream, but my face hasn’t changed at all?” Chen Liping looked at Ye Zhen’s perfectly rouged face and was so envious that she really wanted to rip off Ye Zhen’s face and put it on her own.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen answered in a kind tone. “The cream is not a miraculous elixir. It does not take one or two days to show effects, besides we have different skin types.”</p>
<p>“Then how did it change you so fast?” Lu Jing asked, pouting her lips.</p>
<p>“You don’t understand natural beauty.” Ye Zhen jested.</p>
<p>The proud expression made the girls anxious enough to crush her!</p>
<p>Chen Qiuping, who was likely to become their eldest sister-in-law in the future was not as envious of Ye Zhen compared to her younger sister.</p>
<p>She said gently, “It’s getting late. We should set off, Yaoyao. Today is your important day.”</p>
<p>“She can’t pass the exam anyway, many people have wagered on this likelihood” Lu Jing sighed and continued, “Third Sister, it doesn’t matter if you don’t pass the exam.”</p>
<p>At this, Lu Fang laughed. “Yaoyao hasn’t taken the exam yet. How can you say such bad things?’</p>
<p>“Fourth Sister, If you can tell a good story, you really need to… speak more.” Chen Liping followed with raucous laughter.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t care about their taunts but instead thanked them for their reminders–she almost forgot about the bet.</p>
<p>There should be a lot of people paying attention to her test today. She heard that Princess Liu Hua had instigated the wager herself. Because Teacher Shan had shunned her that day, she became livid and coerced others to make bets on Ye Zhen. This was her attempt to humiliate Ye Zhen in the eyes of the many.</p>
<p>Humiliating her meant humiliating the Lu Family. Lu Jing was a fool for not realizing this and kept betting with others.</p>
<p>“The academy must be very lively today.” Ye Zhen uttered plaintively.</p>
<p>Lu Jing glanced at her mockingly and said, “That’s not necessarily true. This is not a famous entrance examination. If it were another branch of the academy, the School of Education perhaps, then it would be vivacious.”</p>
<p>Most of the girls taking the entrance examination for the School of Medicine were old and had an ordinary family background, which was naturally different from the  School of Education.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen spoke no more. There was no point in arguing with a narrow-minded person like Lu Jing. The few girls split up and went to two separate carriages before setting off towards the academy.</p>
