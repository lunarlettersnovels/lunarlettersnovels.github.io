            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 353 – The Brothers (2)</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was a little disappointed. He felt that if Yaoyao teamed up with him, the chances of winning against his brother would be better.</p>
<p>“His Majesty is rarely willing to accompany you to play polo, so study hard.” Ye Zhen also didn’t want to join, she was someone who feared pain.</p>
<p>The people of the aristocratic families probably didn’t expect to play polo with the emperor one day. Everyone was very excited. Mo Rongzhan divided them into two teams, and the two brothers fought on the polo field.</p>
<p>As Ye Zhen watched the two brothers on the field, the thought she had only just pressed down, resurfaced. Looking at Mo Rongyi, who seemed somewhat similar to Mo Rongzhan, she felt more and more that he would make a good emperor in the future.</p>
<p>But after Mo Rongzhan had ascended the throne, he seemed to be greatly loved by the people. She had to admit that, undoubtedly, he was a good emperor; much better than the first emperor and the tyrant, deposed emperor.</p>
<p>But to her, so what if he was a good emperor? The whereabouts of her father and brother were still unknown, she didn’t know if they were dead or alive and the Ye family had long ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at them again. Seeing that they were already immersed in the fierce battle of polo, she turned around and left quietly.</p>
<p>While Mo Rongzhan was playing with his younger brother, he was also teaching him how to play. When they emerged victors and wanted to go to Ye Zhen, they found out that she was no longer in the polo field.</p>
<p>“Where is Yaoyao?” Mo Rongyi was also looking for her only to find her nowhere.</p>
<p>“She’s probably keeping Imperial Mother company.” Mo Rongzhan lowered his eyelids, veiling a hint of disappointment in his eyes.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi smiled and said, “Brother Emperor, when I compete with Prince Shun, will you come to watch?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Mo Rongzhan nodded faintly. “You must strive for success.”</p>
<p>“I won’t lose!” Mo Rongyi said as he resolutely nodded his head.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>From the polo field, Ye Zhen came straight to Cining Palace. She wanted to take her leave from the empress dowager. However, she was met with reluctance as the latter was not willing to let her go back like this, wishing that she stayed in the palace for a few more days so she could gain back the weight she lost.</p>
<p>She didn’t know if she should laugh or cry. Finally, considering how she would have to pretend to care about Lu Lingzhi even if she were to go back, she didn’t insist further and continued to stay in Cining Palace.</p>
<p>The two had only just finished talking about Mo Rongyi’s polo when a junior palace attendant from the announced the arrival of Xianfei. The empress dowager smiled and let Xu Huiru in. She seemed to like her a lot.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had reservations about Xu Huiru. Before she married Mo Rongzhan, they had been schoolmates and didn’t like each other. While on the surface Xu Huiru seemed close to her, she would be scheming from the shadows. She had only discovered her true colors much later.  With her charming looks and conniving mind, it wouldn’t be difficult for her to gain favour in the inner palace.</p>
<p>She had felt an inexplicable irritation at the thought that Mo Rongzhan might like Xu Huiru.</p>
<p>“This concubine greets the empress dowager. Blessings unto you.” Xu Huiru was very well-behaved, treating the empress dowager with familiarity.</p>
<p>“Please rise,” The empress dowager said with a smile, and asked her to have a seat.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru smiled gently at Ye Zhen. “I heard that Princess Furong had left for Jinwu City. Did you just come back?”</p>
<p><em>She has only just returned and already cannot wait to enter the palace… It seems that Lu Yaoyao really knows how to please the empress dowager.</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen understood the meaning behind her words. She smiled faintly and said, “Yes, I came back yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Princess seems to have lost weight. I heard that Marquis Anyang was seriously injured. Is he better?” Xu Huiru said sincerely as if worried about Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>“A lot better, thank you for your concern.” Ye Zhen dealt with her smoothly.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru smiled and turned to the empress dowager. “Empress Dowager, this concubine copied a book of the Merciful Blessings to give to you.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager frowned and said, “Didn’t I tell you not to copy these things? Just take care of the emperor, and give me a grandson to hold soon.”</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager, this… these are two different things.” Xu Huiru lowered her head pretentiously, however, she couldn’t help the complicated emotions coursing through her heart. She could see that the emperor did not hate her, and occasionally even visited the Xinhe Palace. Sometimes he’d even stay until late into the night. Several times she thought that she could serve him in bed, but he did nothing after all. She even wondered if she had misstepped, that the emperor refused to touch her at all.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt even more irritated at Xu Huiru’s shamefacedness.</p>
<p>Oblivious to all undercurrents within the beauties before her, the empress dowager said with a cheeky smile, “I am aware of your filial piety. It is not long since the emperor ascended the throne hence it is inevitable that he will focus his energy on national affairs. If you are more considerate of him, he will naturally like to go visit you.”</p>
<p>It seemed that the empress dowager really liked Xu Huiru. If it had been Lu Wushuang, she certainly would not have said such words.</p>
