            <p><strong>Chapter 548 – To Me, You Are Not A Trifling Matter</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan left most of his subordinates on Black Winds Island to deal with the weapons. Apart from him and Ye Zhen, there were only a few subordinates on the ship back to the capital.</p>
<p>It had been several days at sea now, Ye Zhen deliberately avoided getting along with Mo Rongzhan. She didn’t want to meet him, so she did not leave her cabin. However, every morning, she would wake up to find the man always lying beside her. She had no idea when he would come in to sleep beside her.</p>
<p>Just like now, she opened her eyes and found herself in his arms. She was sleeping so comfortably.</p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan!” Ye Zhen shouted angrily, “You’re doing it again, you said yesterday that you wouldn’t come in.”</p>
<p>“I was just worried that you’d kick the quilt away, so I came in to cover you with it. But you hugged me and wouldn’t let go, so I had to—” Mo Rongzhan said innocently, hugging her waist.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was so angry that she didn’t care about her image. “Fuck, you said the same thing yesterday… that I would hold you and wouldn’t let go.”</p>
<p>She even went ahead and cursed openly, she would never have been this coarse before, he forced her to this!</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan chuckled, rolled over, pressed her under him, directly blocking her lips, kissing her breathless, before reluctantly releasing her. “Yaoyao, why don’t you admit it…  Only by my side can you sleep soundly, you have been having nightmares these days.”</p>
<p>“I dreamed of you,” Ye Zhen said coldly, alluding that it was akin to having a nightmare.</p>
<p>“If you dream of me every day, I will definitely be able to accompany you every day.” Mo Rongzhan bit her earlobe and laughed hoarsely.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was so angry that she wanted to bite him to death. “There are other people on this ship. I am still a princess. As my elder brother, aren’t you afraid that people will say that you… don’t care about proper etiquette*?”</p>
<p>(*human relationships)</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s expression sank slightly, and he said in a low voice, “They are all my confidants and will not talk nonsense, not to mention… you will not remain a princess for too long. Yaoyao, when we return to the capital, you will be my empress.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be your empress,” Ye Zhen turned her face away, she would never make the same mistakes again, who knows if he would ignore her like before?</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I’m not asking if you want to.” Mo Rongzhan touched her cheek and said, “I just told you that I want to do this.”</p>
<p>She glared at him viciously, but the man didn’t take it seriously. He simply captured her pink lips and savored them for a while before letting go.</p>
<p>They were at sea for ten days before they reached the shore. In the past ten days, Ye Zhen had been taken by Mo Rongzhan almost every day. She thought she could finally get away from him now, but who knew that just after getting off the ship she would see a familiar carriage? It was parked right by the gangplank.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t that Mo Rongzhan’s carriage? Do I have to ride with him back to the capital?</em></p>
<p>“You wouldn’t want me and you… in the same car, would you?” Ye Zhen asked Mo Rongzhan, who was walking in front of her, in a low voice. “This official route is different from the sea, you don’t care about your face, but I still want a good reputation.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked back at her with a smile, and asked in a low voice, “Why don’t I decree you to be the empress now?”</p>
<p>“Is that how you set up the empress?” she demanded angrily.</p>
<p>“Of course not! I have never been more serious about making you the empress,” he said in a deep voice. Although they were in casual clothes and did not reveal their identities to anyone, they still attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t want to talk to him anymore. Just when she had walked to the side of the carriage he scooped her up and carried her in.</p>
<p>The bodyguards beside Mo Rongzhan seemed to have seen it all but didn’t find anything wrong with the emperor’s intimacy with the princess.</p>
<p>“When will my master return to the capital?” Ye Zhen was very curious about the current situation on Zhao Jia Island, but she had no one to ask except Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“Maybe soon.” Saying so, he handed her the secret missive that had been set aside. “This is what Wu Chong* sent me, you can take a look.”</p>
<p>(*one of his shadow guards)</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was taken aback for a moment, <em>he is actually letting me read his secret report…</em>  Although she was surprised, she did not hesitate to open it.</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glared at Mo Rongzhan, <em>no wonder he was willing to show it!</em></p>
<p>The content of the letter was scripted in a pattern she couldn’t understand. Even if she could read several of the words, the meaning was not clear. Whoever got this secret missive wouldn’t know what it was talking about.</p>
<p>Seeing her fuming, Mo Rongzhan couldn’t help laughing. He stretched out his hand and pulled her to his lap to sit down. “I’ll teach you how to read it, don’t be angry.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to learn,” she retorted coldly, lest any information leaks later, and he thinks she betrayed him.</p>
<p>“I trust you, Yaoyao.” He immediately understood what she was worried about and sighed. “But why won’t you trust me?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lowered her eyes and said nothing, she just didn’t want to learn what his secret reports meant.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan did not force her, put away the secret report, sat her down next to him, and hugged her. “Huangfu Chen saved Mu Qing, but she was too badly injured and died a few days after regaining consciousness. Zhao Mingxiao’s martial arts were disabled, and he was sent to the Spirit Snake Island. He probably will not have the opportunity to leave in this life.”</p>
<p>“Mu Qing… Mu Qing is dead?” Ye Zhen opened wide in shock. She was suddenly very distressed for Huangfu Chen, his beloved was dead… How sad must he be at this time… “What about my master?”</p>
<p>“He’s still on Zhao Jia Island,” Mo Rongzhan said in a low voice. Huangfu Chen must be sullen and dejected, after all, she was the woman he once loved and his wife. But… he also felt that his friend should be relieved.</p>
<p>He had spent so many years looking for Mu Qing. So when he found out that she had married Zhao Mingxiao, the relationship should have ended.</p>
<p>“I’m going to find my master,” Ye Zhen declared.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s heart surged with anger. “Is Huangfu Chen so important to you?”</p>
<p><em>She only cares about her master, doesn’t she know I would be jealous?</em></p>
<p>“He is very important.” Ye Zhen nodded in all seriousness.</p>
<p>“What about me?” Mo Rongzhan’s dark eyes bore at her, knowing well that the answer would not be what he wanted, yet he held onto a glimmer of hope that he could find comfort from her.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, there are so many people who care about you. What is the difference between one more and one less*?” Ye Zhen said lightly.</p>
<p>(*person)</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan only felt that the strong and deep love in his heart had turned into a rage. He pulled her over with force, lowered his head, and kissed her hard.</p>
<p>“No…!” Ye Zhen pushed his shoulders and looked up only to see his red eyes filled with fury.  She was flustered, she had never seen him this angry.</p>
<p>How could she forget that in front of this man, she could only say nice things to coax him, otherwise it would be her who would suffer in the end?</p>
<p>Suddenly, her skirt came loose, and he started to tear her dress away.</p>
