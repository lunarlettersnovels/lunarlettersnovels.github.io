            <p><strong>Chapter 520 – Mu Qing</strong></p>
<p>In Huaijiang City, on the Wangjiang, a lone figure stood in the wind.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi had arrived in Huaijiang City two days before but had not seen Yaoyao. He had come this time determined to make her accept him completely and not treat him with hostility. He would agree to anything, but he had not seen her or any of her companions.</p>
<p>The medical bureau said that she had left Huaijiang City, but no one knew where she had gone. Tang Zhen had hinted that Yaoyao was angry that the emperor had found Ye Yaoyao.</p>
<p><em>She is angry… Does it mean that she is already enticed by the emperor?</em></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s mood was very bitter. Back then, Ye Zhen had been like this, wholeheartedly thinking of Mo Rongzhan. Even though he did not care about her, she still wanted to know more about Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>Although Yaoyao was different from Ye Zhen, Mo Rongzhan liked Yaoyao now, but the emperor was heartless. What if Mo Rongzhan soon doted on Ye Yaoyao? Would Yaoyao be very sad? Instead of being depressed like Ye Zhen would be in the future, why not… He didn’t want her to enter the palace. It was better to suffer a short pain than a long one.</p>
<p><em>But Yaoyao, where did you go?</em></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi smiled bitterly, not knowing where to find her.</p>
<p>“Marquis.” Someone whispered behind him, “You’re tired. Why don’t you go back and rest?”</p>
<p>“Did you find out where Yaoyao went?” Lu Lingzhi asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>Standing behind Lu Lingzhi was a woman dressed in black. She was delicate and pretty, and her eyes were filled with killing intent. Only when she looked at Lu Lingzhi would her eyes change emotions. She was Lu Lingzhi’s secretly trained subordinate, Leng Mei. She looked at Lu Lingzhi and said, “Marquis, this subordinate has investigated. No one knows where Third Miss went. She sent the Lu family’s servant and carriage back. However, it seems she left a letter which was taken back to the capital by the Marquis of Jingning.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi frowned slightly. Without knowing her whereabouts, where was he going to find her?</p>
<p>“Marquis, you have to think of a way to cure the poison in your body.” Leng Mei reminded her master in a low voice, afraid that he would neglect his body in the bid to find Third Miss.</p>
<p>“Then let’s go to the western frontier first.”</p>
<p>It was rumoured that the poison masters over at the western frontier could solve his bane (seven days of pain). He had obtained this information with great difficultly. Not only for the Lu family, but also for Yaoyao, he had to purge the poison in his body.</p>
<p>Leng Mei looked around, then lowered her voice, “Marquis, should … (she) walk together with you?”</p>
<p>“She can’t stay in the Jin country! Since she wants to go to the East Qing country, then send her there,” Lu Lingzhi said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, Marquis.” Leng Mei answered.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Zhao Jia Island, Zhao Jia Palace.</p>
<p>“Sister, look, is this the letter you asked me to send to Huangfu Chen?” Mu Fei ran into the palace and handed the letter to a woman who was sitting in a pavilion in the courtyard.</p>
<p>The woman was about twenty years old. She looked beautiful. She wore a light purple dress and sat in the pavilion like a blooming begonia. When she heard Mu Fei mention that name, a trace of sadness flashed across her eyes. She rebuked softly, “What nonsense are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Mu Fei shoved the letter in his hand to Mu Qing. “Sister, you still don’t know. Huangfu Chen has arrived at our Zhao Jia Island. I just saw him with my own eyes. He still has the letter I gave him back then.”</p>
<p>“What does this have to do with me?” Mu Qing threw aside the letter in her hand and her face darkened. “You are not allowed to look for him again.”</p>
<p><em>What was the point of him coming to Zhao Jia Island now? It was not for her, but for Tianji’s legs.</em></p>
<p>Mu Fei said, “I just wanted to teach him a lesson. It’s fine if he left in bad faith, but he even had someone sneak attack our Zhao Jia Island. Sister, do you know what he said? He actually said that I sent him to Spirit Snake Island. When did I send him to Spirit Snake Island—”</p>
<p>“Why would he say that about you?” Mu Qing asked angrily, thinking that Huangfu Chen was deliberately trying to find an excuse to hide his ruthlessness.</p>
<p>“He said that it was in the letter—” Mu Fei curled his lips. “He must have written a letter to deceive me.”</p>
<p>Mu Qing’s face paled and she picked up the letter that she had thrown on the ground. Her fingers trembled slightly. She was very familiar with every word in the letter. It was her handwriting, but the content was unfamiliar. She had never written such a letter before.</p>
<p>“Is this letter really from Huangfu Chen?” Mu Qing asked in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>Mu Fei nodded. “Yeah, Sister, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Back then… Did you personally give this letter to him?” Mu Qing didn’t want to believe that this was the letter that Huangfu Chen had received. However, this letter did seem to have been written for some time. It didn’t look like it had just been written. Moreover, there was a special seal on the letter that belonged to Zhao Jia Island. Most importantly, the handwriting was too similar.</p>
<p>Even she almost thought this was what she wrote.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, Sister, are you alright?” Mu Fei asked in confusion.</p>
<p>Mu Qing’s face lost all color as she shook her head and put away the letter in her hand. “Don’t tell anyone you gave me this letter.”</p>
<p>“Sister—” Mu Fei looked at her worriedly.</p>
<p>“Mu Fei, why are you here again to cause trouble for your sister?” Mu Xue entered from the outside and immediately chastised Mu Fei when she noticed Mu Qing’s unhappy expression.</p>
<p>“Second Sister!” Mu Fei shrunk his shoulders and quickly hid behind Mu Qing. “You went out for a while. Why did you become even fiercer now that you have returned?”</p>
<p>Mu Qing put the letter into her sleeve and looked at Mu Xue with a smile. “Didn’t I ask you to take care of Tianji? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Second Young Master doesn’t want me to take care of him.” Mu Xue said aggrievedly, “Sister, I originally wanted to stop that person from coming. I couldn’t do that—”</p>
<p>“Is he here to heal Tianji’s legs?” Mu Qing asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Mu Xue wanted to say that the Second Young Master could walk, but when she thought of Zhao Tianji’s warning, she had to say, “It’s Lu Yaoyao who is treating the Second Young Master. That’s right… That person’s apprentice.”</p>
<p>“Big Sis, Lu Yaoyao looks even better than the Island Lord’s mother in our ancestral hall,” Mu Fei whispered.</p>
<p>“How can she compare with the Island Lord’s mother?” Mu Xue yelled, her face glum. “Back then, our Island Lord’s mother was the most beautiful woman in the whole world.”</p>
<p>Mu Qing’s expression was a little stiff as she forced a smile. “Is that girl really that good-looking?”</p>
<p>“No, she’s not as good as my sister,” Mu Xue said.</p>
<p>Mu Fei rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“Sister, do you want… Lu Yaoyao to treat you? It’s been so many years, but the doctors on our island haven’t cured you.” Mu Xue didn’t like Lu Yaoyao, but she reckoned that since the girl could cure the Second Young Master’s legs, she should be able to cure her sister’s illness, right?</p>
<p>Mu Qing originally wanted to refuse, but for some reason, she suddenly was curious about this apprentice and wanted to take a  look at her. “What if she refuses?”</p>
<p>“Since they’ve come to our Zhao Jia Island, is there still room for her to refuse?” Mu Xue snorted coldly.</p>
