            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 330 – How Do You Know (1)</strong></p>
<p>The older brother gazed at his little brother who was excitedly expressing his opinions. It was the first time he saw A’Yi this confident. The little boy was probably used to being bullied in the palace before and had always been a little timid, tending to rely on him, the reigning emperor, and not daring to really go and meet those aristocrats.</p>
<p>But today, he had actually said that he would host a banquet and invite those people. Mo Rongzhan was immensely surprised.</p>
<p>“What made you want to host a banquet?” he asked in a deep voice. He surmised it had to be under someone’s influence that his brother actively chose to seek the very people he had avoided this far.</p>
<p>“Because Yaoyao told me to.” The little prince sold Ye Zhen out without the slightest hesitation.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was startled a little. “Lu Yaoyao? What did she tell you?”</p>
<p>“She said that-” Mo Rongyi recounted every single thing to his brother all along observing how he would react lest he enrages him.</p>
<p><em>Who would know she could think of such a thing?</em> Mo Rongzhan was surprised. From what he knew about those aristocratic families, he thought that Lu Yaoyao wouldn‘t be as great as those from the capital because she had grown up in a border town. Even though she had already amazed him so many times, he was once again impressed by her.</p>
<p>“Are you still competing with Prince Shun and the others in polo?” Mo Rongzhan quirked his eyebrow and asked.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao said, we can beat Prince Shun up.” Mo Rongyi emphasized quickly.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was a bit jealous. Lu Yaoyao was even closer with A’Yi. When she was with him, she never talked much. “Leave the banquet to the Imperial Household Department. As for the invitations, write them yourself.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Imperial Brother!” Mo Rong Yi said with a big smile. He had never written invitations himself. He had hosted banquets before, but it was only Imperial Mother, him, and a few other people that celebrated his birthday. This would be the first time he would host an actual banquet, so he was a bit nervous.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao came to the palace this early just to help with your things?”Mo Rongzhan asked, seemingly indifferent. Although he said he didn’t care, it was still obvious that he wanted to know about her because he asked about her coming to the palace.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi didn’t notice the awkwardness of his imperial brother at all. “Yaoyao just went to see Imperial Mother. She is probably asking after her eldest brother, but she is going to teach a few companions of mine how to play polo at the field.”</p>
<p>“She also plays polo?” Mo Rongzhan raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“I don’t know~” Mo Rongyi couldn’t sit still now. “Imperial Brother, let me go have a look.”</p>
<p>Without even thinking about it, Mo Rongzhan blurted out, “Zhen will go with you.”</p>
<p>“Brother, didn’t you use to play polo very well?” Mo Rongyi asked excitedly, “Will you teach me?”</p>
<p>“You can’t even ride the horse well and now you want to play polo?” Mo Rongzhan asked faintly. “First, you should learn how to ride a horse.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Mo Rongyi lowered his head with disappointment.</p>
<p>The pair of brothers arrived at the polo field. There was only one person riding a horse on the huge polo field with several boys watching her ride with amazement. Even the guards nearby had turned their heads towards the polo field.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was in a red narrow-sleeved riding outfit that flattered her so well that she looked tall and slender, her skin fair as porcelain. With a stick several feet long in one hand and the reins in the other, she sped along the polo field. Suddenly, she tilted, lowered her body to one side of the saddle, and hit the qibao ball into the goal with one shot.</p>
<p>The beauty regained her original position, reined in the exquisite horse yet again, aimed for the qibao ball, and sent it flying into the goal post in quick succession as if shooting stars.</p>
<p>Under the sun, she wore a bright smile. Every shot was on point and swift. Her riding skills were even better than most other men.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan seemed to hear his own heartbeat beating faster, <em>lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub</em>. He gazed at her intently,  and couldn’t look away.</p>
<p>“Amazing!” Mo Rongyi shouted and clapped his hands. “Yaoyao, I did not know that you can play polo so well!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned her head towards the voice and saw the man next to Mo Rongyi at a glance. She was shocked and immediately took the stick back. She slowed down the horse and got off. She said to the boys who were stunned, ”See? This is how you play polo. You looked like you did not eat when you were playing. Practice harder.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi ran over and took her hand. “Yaoyao, why are you a girl? If you were a man, it would be so nice, so you can beat up Prince Shun for us.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed and pushed away his hand. “Don’t worry, there are many people who are better than me. I will give you a list tomorrow, and you can try to convince them to help you.”</p>
<p>“How do you know who else is good at playing polo?” Mo Rongzhan’s voice came from behind her in a low tone.</p>
