            <p><strong>Chapter 370 – We Won (1)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who was still frightened out of her wits, was being held tightly in Mo Rongzhan’s arms. Slightly pale and ghastly, she stared at the comatose horse she had only just been riding, uncertain if it was dead or alive.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, are you all right?” Mo Rongzhan looked down at her, still scared a while after. If he had had the slightest moment of hesitation, she would have been bucked off of the crazed horse, or even crushed by its hooves. Thinking of the danger she could have experienced, the panic in his heart increased.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt a sliver of warmth in his sturdy and strong embrace. She looked up at him and fell into a pair of eyes; deep with panic and fear. Her heart jumped, and slowly calmed again. “Your Majesty, put me down first. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Her tone was still flat, her pink lips pursed tightly. Her hands gripped the plackets over his chest. He could tell she was frightened, his heart ached. If it weren’t for the fact that there were court ministers and the empress dowager present, he would most definitely kiss her with all his might, to ease the panic he had felt at almost losing her.</p>
<p>“Go and rest first,” Mo Rongzhan said softly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head, coming down from his embrace. She said to the people waiting aside, “Prepare another horse for me.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao!” Mo Rongzhan stopped her with a low warning. “Are you still thinking about riding?”</p>
<p>“Of course. That d***** piece of s*** dared to meddle with my horse. How will I be able to bear it if I do not avenge myself?” She was going to ride and openly beat the s*** out of him.</p>
<p>“I will naturally resolve this for you,” Mo Rongzhan stated.</p>
<p>“I don’t need you to!” Ye Zhen resolutely refused him. How would him resolving this for her be as satisfying as her personally teaching that piece of s*** a lesson? “You can resolve this for me after I’ve won them on the field.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, listen to me.” Mo Rongzhan grabbed her arm.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glared at him. “I won’t let them get another chance to touch my horse.”</p>
<p>Seeing that she had already made up her mind, and wouldn’t heed him, he could only let go of her arm, and stand to the side, closely watching her, in fear lest something else happen to her.</p>
<p>The horse that had been knocked out had already been carried off the field. Mo Rongzhan ordered a thorough investigation into the reason it had been spooked.</p>
<p>Prince Shun and Mo Huaide stood not far away. They looked towards Ye Zhen and Mo Rongzhan, their eyes shining. She didn’t know what they were thinking about.</p>
<p>“Eighth Brother, why would the emperor save that brat?” Mo Huaide quietly asked. If Mo Rongzhan had just died under the hooves of the horse, then none of the people here today would have hopes of seeing tomorrow.</p>
<p>“Send someone to investigate the background of that brat.” Barking the order, Prince Shun turned to the people waiting behind him.</p>
<p>The competition began again, and Ye Zhen had switched to a new horse. Mo Rongzhan had ordered a detailed checkup of the horse before he had allowed her to mount it.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s cold glance fell on Mo Huaide, who had neared her not long ago. She didn’t know who he was, but seeing that he was closely following Prince Shun, she could guess that he was the one who had bullied A’Yi.</p>
<p>“Go after the balls!” Ye Zhen called out domineeringly. With a firm grip on the reins, her horse shot like an arrow into the field.</p>
<p>Mo Huaide was stunned by her imposing manner. When he came to it, he hurriedly grabbed his reins, wanting to steal over Ye Zhen’s colored polo ball.</p>
<p>The galloping girl’s polo stick turned, first sending the flying ball towards the offensive players in front of her, then heavily swaying outwards, landing a blow on Mo Huaide.</p>
<p>The pain almost made Mo Huaide jump out of his seat and wail.</p>
<p>Prince Shun pointed at Ye Zhen and angrily asked, “Why are you hitting him?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see him coming, and accidentally hit him.” Ye Zhen didn’t show the slightest bit of shame, tossing back the same words the eighth prince had not long ago uttered to the little prince.</p>
<p>“You—” Prince Shun’s was as black as the bottom of a wok with anger, but he couldn’t do anything to her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t mind him, saying to the other, “There isn’t much time, keep going after the balls!”</p>
<p>She had only planned on winning one, but it seemed to her that, if she didn’t win a couple more, it wouldn’t be enough to make this eighth prince respect her win.</p>
<p>Prince Shun frustratedly shouted, “What are the rest of you standing around for? Stop them!”</p>
<p>The rest of the people grimaced internally. It wasn’t like they didn’t want to move, but the emperor was standing on the side, his entirety exuding a terrifying aura. Even if they didn’t want to care, fear was still conjured into their hearts by just the look in his eyes.</p>
<p>In the last fifteen minutes, Ye Zhen struck twice in a row, winning Prince Shun by a score of 6-3.</p>
<p>“Eighth Prince, thank you for your grace,” said Ye Zhen perched atop the horse with a courteous facade.</p>
<p>It was now that Prince Shun remembered the bets, his expression incredibly soured.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan silently let out a breath of relief. If Prince Shun’s lackeys continued to try to harm Yaoyao, he couldn’t guarantee that he wouldn’t kill them on the spot.</p>
<p>“Little Prince has won!” the referee loudly proclaimed.</p>
<p>Prince Shun had already gleaned Ye Zhen’s identity from someone else, and pointed at her saying, “Your Majesty, I do not concede. She isn’t a substitute player. How could they let a princess play as a substituting player?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen mockingly looked at him. “Prince Shun, I advise that you stop blabbering, and let the people know that you cannot best even a woman in polo. That would be truly shameful. Moreover, whoever dictated that females could not play polo? If it were such, you should have said so earlier. If you don’t allow women on the field because you were scared of losing to them, you should have told me. I wouldn’t have gotten on the field!”</p>
