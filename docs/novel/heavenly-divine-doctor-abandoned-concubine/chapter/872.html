            <p><strong>Chapter 457 – Drive Away</strong></p>
<p><em>How could she be considerate of Lu Lingzhi like the Lu family? She wished he could go to hell/drop dead!</em></p>
<p>“Brother, all right, I won’t blame Eldest Brother.” She didn’t want him(LXZ) to see that she hated that man.</p>
<p>“This is good,” he said with a smile, “By the way, I may be transferred out to other places…”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was taken aback for a moment. “Transferred out? Was this Master Xu’s idea?”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi smiled and nodded. “You are unexpectedly quite clever. Master thinks that the best place for me in the capital is the Hanlin Academy, but Father is already in Hanlin. What Master meant… was that he hopes I can go to the military.”</p>
<p>“I agree.” Ye Zhen nodded. “Brother, your martial arts are also good, you don’t necessarily have to stay at the Hanlin Academy. If Father has the opportunity to join the cabinet in the future, then you will not be able to join the cabinet. Anyway, your future will be blocked. It is better to go to the army. Where does Master Xu want for you to go?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, I just came back today to discuss this with Father,” he said.</p>
<p>Now that the rebellion of the Western border had subsided, the Jin Country had no wars going on for the time being. The only thing to guard against was the border. To the south was the Qi state. The two countries had always been on friendly terms. There would be no war for the time being. The one with relatively poor relations with Jin was Dongqing. If one wanted to do meritorious service, naturally they’d have to go to Bian city.</p>
<p>“Brother, don’t you want to go to Bian city?” Ye Zhen asked quietly.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi’s eyes widened. “How did you know?”</p>
<p>The little girl smiled triumphantly. “Seeing you like this, can I still not guess?”</p>
<p>“It seems that our Yaoyao is getting smarter and smarter.” He patted her head. “I heard that Big Brother Tang came to propose a marriage?”</p>
<p>“Brother!” Ye Zhen glared at him. “You, what are you saying out of nowhere?”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi laughed. “Oh, feeling bashful? What’s there to be shy about? It’s not easy for you to get married after all.”</p>
<p>She angrily waved her hand and punched him on the shoulder. “What do you mean it’s not easy for me to get married, do I look like I can’t get married? Lu Xiangzhi, stop for me, why are you running?! Come back!”</p>
<p>“I’m telling the truth, look at you, little girl, so fierce. Who’d dare to marry you?” Lu Xiangzhi laughed as he ran.</p>
<p>“I’m going to beat you to death!” Ye Zhen angrily shouted, and broke into a run chasing after him. The two arrived at Pei Shi’s courtyard one after the other, and only when they reached the door did Lu Xiangzhi immediately stop. His entire face was grim as he looked at the scene within.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen caught up to him and wanted to beat him up, but she found a woman in plain clothes kneeling in her mother’s courtyard. That woman’s face was pale and she looked pitiful as she begged Pei Shi to give her a way out.</p>
<p>The woman was Xue Liu, the very one who had served Lu Shiming before. When Lu Shiming went to the border town, she stayed, thinking that she would be able to have a place when he returned, but it turned out contrary to her wish. Lu Shiming and Pei Shi had a deep affection. He simply did not want to have anything to do with his former maid. Xue Liu’s love fell short and she long since blamed Pei Shi.</p>
<p>Pei Shi, in her room, was so angry that her chest hurt. If it weren’t for her concern for her reputation, she would have already called for people to have Xue Liu thrown out</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with you all? This kind of shameless trash should have long been thrown out, so why has she still been left here to anger Mother?” Ye Zhen walked in with a calm face and shouted angrily at the women next to her.</p>
<p>“Third Young Miss, Sister Xue Liu has been ill for several days, we just want to ask Third Madam to get her a doctor,” the little servant girl next to Xue Liu timidly said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sneered. “You really think of me as something, a servant who is very sick and dares to approach Third Madam, who will take the blame if she becomes sick? Hai Tang, have someone pack up her things and send them to the back room. It’s really bad luck!”</p>
<p>Xue Liu’s face changed and there were tears on her cheeks. “Third Miss is really impressive. She even dares to teach her father’s servants a lesson.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Pa!</strong></em></p>
<p>Hai Tang’s palm flashed past. “Presumptuous, even daring to question the princess. Xue Liu, who gives you such courage?!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled faintly. “Hai Tang, there is no need to say more to such a person, just throw her out. If the old madam asks, just say it was my idea. Her illness seems to be not light and she is afraid that it will infect others, for the sake of the family’s health, it is better for her to not stay in the Lu family.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Third Miss.” Hai Tang couldn’t hide the smile on her face. “This slave will go and report to the old madam.”</p>
<p>Like this, Ye Zhen settled Xue Liu who had been blocking people’s hearts for a long time. She then turned around and went into Pei Shi’s room.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi, who was standing on the sidelines for a long time, had already been left dumbstruck.</p>
<p><em>The imposing little girl just now… was it really my sister? Dang! I simply can’t dare to believe it!</em></p>
