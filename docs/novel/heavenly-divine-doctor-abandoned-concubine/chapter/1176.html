            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 151 – Lovesickness</strong></p>
<p>Upon the mention of the little prince, Ye Zhen’s eyes sank slightly. She couldn’t hear Aunt Cheng’s words as she carefully whispered it into the empress dowager’s ears, but she suspected that it had something to do with her.</p>
<p><i>What is Mo Rongyi up to this time?</i></p>
<p>The Empress Dowager shook her head helplessly. “That child!”</p>
<p>She looked at Ye Zhen and said, “Yaoyao, do you remember the little prince whose life you saved near the Chengde Mountain Villa?”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, this miss remembers the little prince.”</p>
<p><i>It’s hard to forget!</i></p>
<p>“He has been suffering from a cold recently and isn’t willing to take the medicine prescribed by the imperial physician, so he has not recovered. Now he wants to see you again…” The empress dowager hesitated.</p>
<p>She did not wish to cause inconvenience to people by asking them to deal with difficulties, especially the ones caused by her spoilt, younger son.</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager, let Yaoyao go to the little prince and let her ask him to take his medicine. When Mo Rongyi sees Yaoyao, he might be persuaded.” Lu Wushuang, seeing this as an opportunity to get her third sister out of the empress dowager’s sight, quickly suggested.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen cast a sideways glance at Old Madam Lu, asking for her opinion.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Old Madam smiled and nodded. “Yaoyao, please go and greet the little prince.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandmother.” Ye Zhen nodded, feeling a little bit annoyed that Mo Rongyi’s stunt cut off her conversation with the empress dowager.</p>
<p><i>That little brat! It must be because Princess Liu Hua did not compensate him his money that he requests to see me.</i></p>
<p>The empress dowager lovingly touched Ye Zhen’s head and asked the maid-in-waiting to take her to the little prince.</p>
<p>Because Mo Rongyi was still young, the empress dowager was reluctant to let him live inside the premises of the imperial palace where a successor like him was supposed to live, so she continued to let him live in a palace closest to hers.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan did not have a son yet, so Mo Rongyi was the sole prince of the country and his successor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was walking in when she heard him whining and refusing to take medicine.</p>
<p>“Little Prince, Third Miss Lu is here.” The maid-in-waiting, walking beside Ye Zhen, gave her an embarrassed look and informed Mo Rongyi from outside his door.</p>
<p>As soon as the door creaked open, Mo Rongyi ran out. “Yaoyao, are you really there?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen thought that Mo Rongyi was just pretending to be ill but seeing his thin body and pale, sallow face, she knew right away that she was wrong.</p>
<p>“Little Prince, why don’t you take medicine when you are ill?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s young, chubby face was full of resentment. Hearing Ye Zhen’s words, he cried out more scandalously. “I am sick! I have a heart disease! No medicine can cure it! “</p>
<p>“What kind of heart disease do you have? Heart diseases, I believe, are curable with medicine,” Ye Zhen confusedly asked.</p>
<p>“Lovesickness!” Mo Rongyi covered his chest with an agonized look.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ye Zhen used all her will to stop herself from sniggering. <i>Has the imperial prince fallen in love with someone who did not return his affections?</i></p>
<p>The maid-in-waiting next to him hurriedly cried. “Little Prince, how are you feeling? Where did you get this lovesickness from?”</p>
<p>The maid-in-waiting who brought Ye Zhen spoke suddenly. “Third Miss Lu, don’t listen to the little prince’s nonsense. It’s not lovesickness, he just caught a cold.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi looked sullenly at the maid then at Ye Zhen. “I miss my silvers!”</p>
<p><i>Aha! I was right all this time! </i></p>
<p>The imperial prince really called for her presence because he missed, not someone special, but his silvers which Princess Liu Hua refused to give!</p>
<p>With a smile, Ye Zhen calmly spoke to the little prince, in hopes of calming him down. “Don’t you know that lovesickness must be treated with love peas<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1">[mfn]Love Pea is a red-bean which is known in China as a symbol of romance. This concept originated from a tragic ancient Chinese poem and was in fact, revived by an animated video titled “Lovesickness”.[/mfn]</sup>?</p>
<p>“Love peas? Will you help me get my money?” Mo Rongyi asked brightly.</p>
<p>“Yes, but you should take love peas first.”</p>
<p>“What can that do?” Mo Rongyi asked painfully.</p>
<p>“Treat lovesickness.”</p>
<p>“Well, you can find it for me. I am not feeling well.” The little prince agreed.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, isn’t love pea a poison?” The maid-in-waiting puffed at the corner of her mouth, thinking to herself that Ye Zhen was a bad influence.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi’s face changed. He stared at Ye Zhen and asked, “Do you want to give me poison?”</p>
<p>“Of course not, Your Highness.” Ye Zhen stood aside, she was just trying to trick the prince into having him drink his medicine.</p>
<p>“You all withdraw, this prince has something to say to Miss Lu.” Mo Rongyi waved the others out of his chamber.</p>
<p>“But Your Highness, you haven’t taken your medicine yet!” Cried the maid-in-waiting anxiously.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi frowned and crossed his meaty arms. “For the hundredth time, I don’t want to!”</p>
<p>With his order, every maid silently departed his chambers but only after Ye Zhen silently took the medicine from one of the maid’s hands.</p>
<p>“Princess Liu Hua swallowed up this prince’s twelve thousand silvers!” As soon as they were left alone, Mo Rongyi shouted. “Silver matters little, but my reputation matters a lot! How can I save my face!”</p>
<p>“Oh, how pitiful! Lucky for me, I had my brothers take 41,000 taels from her.” Ye Zhen smiled smugly.</p>
<p>For a while, Mo Rongyi pointed to Ye Zhen and could not say a word, realizing that she was mocking him. On the next second, he cried with fervor. “Liu Hua said that this prince bullied her! After being lectured by Mother, all the money this prince had bet was lost to Liu Hua! How dare she not pay me?”</p>
