            <p><strong>Chapter 450 – Keep It a Secret for Me (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Just what on earth did Lu Lingzhi do to make Yaoyao hate him so much? I did hear Lu Lingzhi often went to Qin Wangfu at that time, so he must be familiar with Ye Zhen. And Ye Zhen… was it possible that, because Mo Rongzhan didn’t come back for two years, she became attracted to Lu Lingzhi?</em></p>
<p>This is the most likely thing, because when you give your heart to another only to be betrayed… any woman would be sad and bitter.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, do you come today to ask me to not save Lu Lingzhi?” Huangfu Chen asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said, “Mister Chen is naturally kind and righteous whose heart yearns to save people. Of course, I dare not obstruct. It’s just… If I don’t avenge Ye Zhen, I will not be able to feel at ease in my lifetime. However, the Lu Family is kind to me and I have to repay their grace. That’s why… I just ask Mister Chen to put off the detoxification for some time and let him learn more lessons. This way, it can be considered a breath of relief for Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>She did not dare to outright ask Huangfu Chen to not detoxify Lu Lingzhi. Besides, in any case, the toxicity of <em>Qitiantong</em> would spread, and the longer it dragged on, the worse it would be for Lu Lingzhi. But… She didn’t know Huangfu Chen well, so she did not dare to believe him with all her heart and soul.</p>
<p>Even if Huangfu Chen had asked Teacher Shan to help her, she did not dare to trust others easily after the numerous betrayals she had experienced.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen took a deep look at Ye Zhen. This little girl had so many secrets that he did not see before. “Yaoyao, does Lu Shiming know that you already know where you come from?”</p>
<p>“He does not know. Please keep it a secret for me. If Lu Lingzhi came to know that I am not my father’s own blood, he would definitely not let me go.” She looked at Huangfu Chen pleadingly, wearing a nervous and pitiful look.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Huangfu Chen nodded his head gently. He now knew that Ye Zhen was killed by Lu Lingzhi’s hand. He was also angry. If Ye Yiqing knew, he would not let Lu Lingzhi go.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mister Chen…,” Ye Zhen said, hesitation coloring her face as she looked at him while biting her lower lip in indecision.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen faintly smiled. “Today, I did not hear anything you said to me.”</p>
<p>It was only then that Ye Zhen truly smiled. “Mister Chen, thank you.”</p>
<p>♚♚♚</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at the pure, clear and beautiful smile on Ye Zhen’s face and could not help smiling as well. Although he was very curious about what secrets she was hiding, he knew that people often had wounds that others could not easily touch. He believed that the truth would emerge one day.</p>
<p>Although Ye Zhen had achieved her goal, she did not say goodbye. She still had many questions she hadn’t yet figured out, such as why did Huangfu Chen help her? If Teacher Shan had been arranged by him, then he would have been secretly watching the two sisters for many years.</p>
<p><em>What is his reason for doing this?</em></p>
<p>“Is there anything else you want to ask?” He looked at her with a smile, guessing that her heart was still filled with resolved doubts.</p>
<p>She said in a low voice, “Mister Chen, you said… Teacher Shan came to me… Us  pair of sisters. Why did you want to help us?”</p>
<p>“If it weren’t for me, perhaps you two sisters wouldn’t have been separated. I always felt guilty and wanted to make up to you,” said he. “Later, I was isolated from the world for a period of time, and I didn’t know that Ye Zhen had married A’Zhan. Had I known, I would have persuaded her not to marry him.”</p>
<p>“Why?” She felt a sourness that came from the bottom of her heart. At that time, she was so determined on marrying Mo Rongzhan that maybe it would have been useless for anyone to try and persuade her otherwise.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen sighed and said, “A’Zhan still doesn’t know how to cherish the people around him. He has become accustomed to using his methods to take whatever he wants. Since childhood, he has learned everything but not how to love. ”</p>
<p>She looked down slightly. “Why did Mister Chen help me later?”</p>
<p>He actually wanted to say something good about Mo Rongzhan on his behalf. But seeing that the little girl was deliberately avoiding the topic, he knew that she was still resisting him in her heart. He sighed helplessly inwardly. He could only let the guy (MRZ) seek more blessings for himself, and it would probably take him a long time to be able to get a beauty.</p>
<p>“At that time, I already knew about the Ye Family, but didn’t know your father was still alive. I thought you were… I couldn’t bear to see you being bullied when you arrived in the capital, so I asked Teacher Shan to help you.” He said, “Yaoyao, you are full of surprises. I never expected that you would be so smart.”</p>
<p><em>That’s because she is Ye Zhen!</em></p>
<p>She stood up and respectfully gave a big bow. “Thank you for your help over the years.”</p>
<p>He helped her up. “You don’t have to be like this. Your father was kind to me, and it’s only right that I take care of you for him.”</p>
<p>“Mister Chen, may I take you as my master?” Ye Zhen asked suddenly.</p>
