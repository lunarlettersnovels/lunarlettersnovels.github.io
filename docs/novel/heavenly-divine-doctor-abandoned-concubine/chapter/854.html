            <p><strong>Chapter 476 – Who’s That Man? (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Since you’ve come to Tianshui* Villa as a guest, you should stay for a few more days. Your medical skills are so good that your apprentice should be good. Let your apprentice cure my legs. If she fails, I’ll kill her,” Zhao Tianji looked at Ye Zhen and said slowly.</p>
<p>[*Sky water]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him expressionlessly. <em>Just now, Qiu Yuan had said that as long as he cured his master, he would let them go. They’re simply deceiving them. This person called Zhao Tianji had no intention of letting them go. Furthermore, he definitely felt that his legs could not be cured. Otherwise, why didn’t he let Master treat him?</em></p>
<p>It seemed that they were doomed to stay in this Tianshui Villa. If Zhao Tianji and his master had not known each other, they might have already been silenced.</p>
<p>“If you kill her, I will turn your place into ruins,” Huangfu Chen said calmly.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji was stunned for a moment, but then he chuckled. “It seems that she is not just your apprentice. Besides Mu Qing, there is another woman who can make Huangfu Chen pay so much attention to her.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at Zhao Tianji coldly. “You don’t have to infuriate me. Let them go and I’ll treat you.”</p>
<p>“If you can cure my illness, I don’t need to sit in this stupid wheelchair.” Zhao Tianji sneered.</p>
<p>“If I cure you, will you let us go?” Ye Zhen’s bright eyes looked at him fearlessly.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji raised his eyebrows. “No.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed angrily. “Then why do you think we will treat you?”</p>
<p>“Because…,” Zhao Tianji looked at Ye Zhen with a faint smile and said, “If you can’t cure my illness, I will kill you all.”</p>
<p>“Rather than being locked up here by you, it’s better to die.” Ye Zhen snorted. ”However, I’m afraid that your illness is more than your inability to move your legs. After a period of time, if you don’t recover, your hands won’t be able to move. When there’s no cure, the only thing you’ll be able to do is move your mouth.”</p>
<p>“Are you looking for death?” Zhao Tianji looked coldly at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said in a low voice, “She’s telling the truth.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji snorted coldly. “If she can’t cure me, you will all die.”</p>
<p>“I’ll cure your illness. You have to let us go.” Ye Zhen said, “Anyway, we were caught by your people and were blindfolded, you don’t have to worry about us revealing your secrets.”</p>
<p>“Huangfu Chen, your apprentice has a sharp tongue.” Zhao Tianji smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said, “Perhaps, she can really cure you. You can weigh it yourself.”</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji had agreed to Ye Zhen’s request. If she could cure him, he would let them go. However, he still placed Huangfu Chen under house arrest, allowing the master and disciple to meet once a day. As for Dai Mei and Quan Fu, they remained in the manor as servants.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen was under house arrest in a garden-like courtyard, similar to the bamboo forest in Shiliwu*. There was a purple bamboo forest in the courtyard, and the environment was elegant. If it weren’t for house arrest, it would be very comfortable to live here.</p>
<p>[*his place in the capital]</p>
<p>“Master, who is that man?” Ye Zhen asked in a low voice. She could only see Huangfu Chen once a day. She had to stay by Zhao Tianji’s side for the rest of the time. Towards that overly feminine and cruel man, she still had many doubts in her heart.</p>
<p>“When I met him a few years ago, he was still an island owner, and he managed to survive on sea trade.” Huangfu Chen said in a low voice, “He is temperamental. You must be very careful when you are by his side. Don’t anger him.”</p>
<p>“Island Lord? Then why would he open a private mine here? And… This villa doesn’t look like it was built in recent years.” They couldn’t build such a large mountain villa in five years, and there were also iron mines in the mountains. It seemed like they had been here for a very long time.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen gently placed his finger on his lips, indicating for her to stop asking. “Zhao Tianji isn’t just an Island Lord, he’s also a pirate. The iron mine isn’t necessarily his.”</p>
<p>“Master, it’s only two days from here to the capital. Has the imperial court not discovered this iron mine at all?” Ye Zhen asked in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>“Before Ah Zhan ascended to the throne, the people of Jin Country could hardly get by. How could the imperial court notice the iron mines in the mountains? Perhaps even if someone knew, Zhao Tianji would silence them.” Huangfu Chen was also surprised. He remembered that Zhao Tianji used to have an iron mine on the island. If he only wanted to do private mining, he did not have to risk coming to Jin Country. Moreover, this place was not far from the capital.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was reminded of her uncle.<em> Perhaps Ye Yisong had been bribed?</em> “Master, what should we do now?”</p>
<p>“We can’t leave just by relying on ourselves. Let’s stay here first and think of a way,” Huangfu Chen whispered.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with Zhao Tianji?” Although Ye Zhen really wanted to know the secret of the iron mine and the villa, she knew all too well that it was impossible to find out in one day. It was better to take it slow before finding a way to leave.</p>
