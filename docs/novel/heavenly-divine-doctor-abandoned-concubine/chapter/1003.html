            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 326 – Assassination</strong></p>
<p>Hong Ling took the letter and looked at Ye Zhen seemingly having something to say.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and asked, “What, do you want to ask me something?”</p>
<p>“Miss, I heard that… you are now a princess?” Hong Ling asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ye Zhen lightly nodded. “With the title of princess, it does seem easier to do what I want.”</p>
<p>Hong Ling felt frustrated and wronged as she asked, “Seeing as they can be so kind to you today, then why would they have~”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at Hong Ling lightly and stopped her from continuing. “Now, my last name is Lu, not Ye.”</p>
<p>If she were Ye Yaoyao today, as long as she was a member of the Ye Family, no matter how much the empress dowager liked her, she would not make her a princess.</p>
<p>“Then…what if they find out about your identity?” Hong Ling asked worriedly. <em>If they found out that Lu Yaoyao was Ye Zhen’s sister in the future, how would they treat her miss?</em></p>
<p>“I’ll make plans for the future when it comes around.”</p>
<p>Now she could only plan her steps as she took them, calculating wherever she went. As for the future, if she were still alive after she had gotten revenge, then she only hoped for an elegant and clean little hut where she could peacefully spend this life.</p>
<p>Hong Ling sighed in her heart, she felt very sorry for her miss.</p>
<p>“Is there no news on Master and Young Master yet?” Ye Zhen asked in a low voice. What she wanted to know most now was the whereabouts of her father and brother. She had always believed that they must be alive.</p>
<p>Hong Ling shook her head slightly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was a little disappointed. “Keep looking, they must be living safely somewhere in this world.”</p>
<p>“Miss~” Hong Ling hesitated for a while, lowered her head, and said, “Uncle Tian is leading a group of people to assassinate Lu Lingzhi.”</p>
<p>“What?” Ye Zhen stood up abruptly. “Who let him go? When did he go?”</p>
<p>Hong Ling had expected that Ye Zhen would be furious. She hurriedly said, “A month ago, Uncle Tian found out that Lu Lingzhi had poisoned you, so he told Uncle Man to be silent on the matter. He took a group of people to Xifan. There is no news on them yet.”</p>
<p>“You’re only telling me now?” Ye Zhen shouted angrily. “Do you know how dangerous it is? If Lu Lingzhi were so easy to kill, why would I have to wait until today?”</p>
<p>“Miss, Uncle Tian’s martial abilities are strong, and all of the people he brought with him are very powerful. Maybe he can really kill Lu Lingzhi,” Hong Ling said hurriedly, attempting to placate her incensed mistress.</p>
<p>“What if he can’t kill him? Do you know how many people Lu Lingzhi brought to Xifan this time? Let Uncle Tian come back immediately, don’t act rashly!” an irate Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>“Uncle Man has already sent someone to tell him this, but… Uncle Tian can’t be persuaded.”</p>
<p>“That old stubborn thing!” Ye Zhen couldn’t sit still. She didn’t want her closest confidant general to die before he killed the Lu Family. She needed Tian Jiu to deal with Lu Shixun for her, but he had run off to assassinate Lu Lingzhi! The man had taken thousands of elite soldiers with him to Xifan. Even if Tian Jiu succeeded, could he escape the pursuit of those elite soldiers after bringing the assistant war minister to grief?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen became more and more anxious as she thought about it, and wished to personally bring Tian Jiu back.</p>
<p>“Miss, it’s useless to be anxious now. Uncle Man has sent someone to find Tian Jiu, don’t worry.” Hong Ling persuaded Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Hong Ling, I don’t want to lose any of you anymore. Listen to me, don’t move carelessly.” Ye Zhen closed her eyes and sighed. She had lost too much. She didn’t want to anymore, and couldn’t lose anything else.</p>
<p>“Miss~” Hong Ling looked at Ye Zhen with tears in her eyes. She had never seen her miss like this, desperate and scared as if she were afraid that she would fall into an abyss in the next moment.</p>
<p>“I won’t let Lu Lingzhi die. I will keep him alive,” Ye Zhen whispered.</p>
<p>Wanting someone to suffer was not to kill him, but to keep him alive, and make him watch as he lost everything that had once belonged to him, little by little. That was the cruelest thing of all.</p>
<p>“Miss, what about Uncle Tian?” Hong Ling asked.</p>
<p>“Find a way to stop him. If you can’t stop him, make sure that Tian Jiu can come back safely. Don’t let him get caught by Lu Lingzhi’s people. Even if Uncle Tian won’t betray Man and the others, could Lu Lingzhi remain oblivious?”</p>
<p>Once he was caught, the people in Jinkou City would definitely be implicated, so they couldn’t afford for anything to happen to Tian Jiu. Only now did Hong Ling understand how much risk Tian Jiu had taken to go kill Lu Lingzhi. He had put not only his life but also the safety of others on the line with him.</p>
