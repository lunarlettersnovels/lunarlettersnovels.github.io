<p>“Grandmother, don’t you even recognize me? It’s only been a few days, but it turned out that my grandmother didn’t love Yaoyao at all and forgot me immediately.” Ye Zhen pretended to be hurt.</p>
<p>In front of her, the little girl was dressed in cedar green, with a pleated skirt of green grass covered with scattered flowers and mist, which made her look innocent and pretty. Upon her return, to some degree, she had become more charming.</p>
<p>Not only did Old Madam Lu look stunned, but the sisters, Lu Jing, and Lu Fang, who were sitting nearby, couldn’t believe that the beautiful miss was none other than Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Although Lu Yaoyao had become significantly fair and beautiful before she left for Zhuangzi, it was not enough to shock people. It was just a little better from her original dark and thin appearance.</p>
<p>But now in this room, who was better looking than her?</p>
<p>No, the sisters were afraid that there was no one more stunning than Lu Yaoyao in the capital.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu quickly recovered. She put Ye Zhen in her arms.</p>
<p>“How did my Yaoyao become so beautiful that her grandmother almost didn’t recognize her?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen covered her mouth and smiled. “Yaoyao knew that my grandmother would not recognize me. I read in the book of medicine before, soaking in hot springs has been good for my skin. I also made cream and applied it to my face according to the prescription in a book. Of course, I made two bottles for my grandmother.”</p>
<p>Women love beauty, regardless of age.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen asked Dai Mei to bring over the cream she made.</p>
<p>“You just… soaked in hot springs and put on that cream to become so fair and delicate?” Old Madam Lu asked incredulously.</p>
<p>Lu Jing said sourly, “What cream is so magical?”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, Yaoyao has been studying earnestly for these creams,” Lu Xiangzhi said proudly.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked at them with a smile. He was used to Ye Zhen’s changes, but he still could understand the others’ surprise.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu laughed. “That also tells us that Yaoyao is a natural beauty. Before, she did not know how to dress up in the border town. She just learned how to make herself beautiful here in the capital.” The madam’s eyes shone with unadulterated pride.</p>
<p>This was true. Lu Yaoyao had a natural beauty, even without the <i>lingquan</i>, she would still bloom into a beautiful flower if she learned to take heed of her appearance.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen hugged Old Madam’s arm. “My grandmother is the best at seeing that I am a natural beauty.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Old Madam couldn’t help but laugh. “You are indeed my Yaoyao, who is a little shameless.” She tapped Ye Zhen’s forehead affectionately.</p>
<p>Lu Jing, who was on one side, was clutching the handkerchief in her hand tightly, jealousy and hatred rose from her heart. Her eyes were fixed on Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Not only did she envy Ye Zhen for being prettier than her, but she also saw the smiles on the Chen Sisters had turned somewhat reluctant.</p>
<p>All along, they had all felt superior before Ye Zhen, but now they seemed to have become worthless.</p>
