            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 202 – Ignoring Him (2)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty…” Eunuch Fu followed closely. “Your Majesty, are you going to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No!” Mo Rongzhan coldly replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eunuch Fu knew he had talked too much and quickly lowered his head to plead guilty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongzhan was in a foul mood. He desperately wanted to find the little girl. These days, he had been secretly looking for her, but there was no news yet. He knew Lu Wushuang knew the truth, but he couldn’t ask her directly. He was worried that he would inadvertently alert her, and knowing her, she would certainly bring her harm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only thing that surprised him was the appearance of  Lu Yaoyao. She was very beautiful and had the same name as the little girl. Even though he had always been cold, he paid her a lot of mind. Knowingly or unknowingly, if she were in the vicinity, his attention was sure to go to her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not a good thing! </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not know what it was that was attracting him to her. It was not a question of how to get a woman to enter the palace for he was already the emperor and one word from him would set things in stone. But he did not want to have another woman from the Lu Family. He would not want the Lu Family to gain enough power one day.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Wushuang was enough. He did not want a second Ye Family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking of the Ye Family, Mo Rongzhan’s face grimaced. That family was a disgrace to him. Not to mention that Ye Yisong committed a hideous crime by killing so many people, the woman actually used the power of the family to force him to marry her!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He never recognized Ye Zhen as his first wife! Nor would he ever!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo Rongzhan went back to the Imperial Palace and asked Eunuch Fu to bring in all the pending paperwork. He didn’t stop reading until his mind put aside the stray thoughts and was submerged in the state affairs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, Lu Yaoyao no longer lingered in his mind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ye Zhen did not know that she had troubled Mo Rongzhan. Most of all, she did not expect this day to be eventful. But she was satisfied with the turn of events, except the part involving a certain someone. However, she was determined not to dwell over it and steer clear from that unpleasant royalty as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss Lu, you were very busy today. I brought you a set of clean clothes. Please do not refuse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ye Zhen smiled and took the clothes gratefully. “Thank you Madam Nuan. This is very good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A moment ago, Imperial Physician Qi came over and checked the little prince’s pulse. She said his pulse is showing improvements. Your medicated diet is very helpful to the little prince’s illness,” Madam Nuan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am glad that I was able to be of some use to the little prince, even with my obvious lack of experience.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way, we should be able to save Mo Rongyi’s life.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madam Nuan looked at the young girl before her in earnesty. She was modest and wore an ever gentle smile, she was neither humble nor haughty. She could not help thinking… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">such a young girl, how can she be so calm in any situation?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madam Nuan was quite good at reading people. She knew that behind the benevolent and demure facade, Wang Fei Lu was ill-tempered and vicious. Many people in the palace laughed at her because she was of lowbirth and uneducated. She even came from a small family. So in a way, her behaviour was justified. But Third Miss Lu also hailed the same family; yet she was very calm and prudent. Such a stark contrast!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss Lu, the little prince asked me to give this to you.” Madam Nuan took out a pile of silver from her arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ye Zhen froze for a moment and took it awkwardly. “He is really giving me 40,000 taels of silver?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madam Nuan laughed. “The little prince said that he cannot make you feel that he is not true to his words.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is Little Prince taking his rest?” Ye Zhen asked amused for she was only trying to coax him to eat the medicated diet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It didn’t take long for him to go to sleep after taking the medicine.” Madam Nuan replied. “Miss Lu, you should go to bed early. It has been a hard day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ye Zhen’s day was full of ups and downs. It was necessary to have a good rest. Tomorrow, would the moment of truth: would Mo Rongyi’s condition improve further or relapse? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This servant shall go back now.” Madam Nuan smiled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ye Zhen was relaxing when a maid walked in with a basin of hot water. She was sent to serve the young miss in her bath. Knowing that she had secrets in her body, since taking over her sister’s body, she had never allowed anyone to serve her in the bath. She, who had been served by an entourage once, now let the maids tend to her basic needs and nothing more. Therefore, unlike the misses from the other wealthy families, one would not find her being accompanied by maids, etc. at all times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By and by, she had become accustomed to being alone, and she was surprised at how much she liked it. Besides, the path she had chosen to embark on, was best traversed alone for she could trust none else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathering herbs for the most part of the day, rushing over to the palace, taking care of the little prince, the day had been quite demanding. However, she did not feel an ounce of fatigue. Looking at how relaxed she was, no one could say she was out doing what she did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, tired or not, she could never refuse a hot bath. Soon after the soak, she felt even better and drifted into a blissful slumber just after lying down.</span></p>
