            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 299 – Do You Have Someone In Mind? (2)</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s lips departed Ye Zhen’s. He held her in his arms and whispered, “Lu Yaoyao, the more you resist, the more Zhen will want you.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen cried uncontrollably. “You are so disgusting. Don’t touch me.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s face turned livid at her reaction. Women longed for his touch and her she was …”What makes you feel sick about Zhen?”</p>
<p>“Let me go, I’m going to throw up.”</p>
<p>Even before either of them could move away, a deep nauseous feeling surged within … she couldn’t help retching.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, how dare you!” An enraged Mo Rongzhan stared at the woman who had thrown up all over him. <em>She actually threw up because I kissed her?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen vomited all the food she had eaten that evening and felt much more comfortable. She raised her head and saw the filth painted on Mo Rongzhan’s chest. She turned white and stepped back a few steps. “I just said, I feel disgusted … It’s none of my business.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to die?” Mo Rongzhan gnashed his teeth and asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wiped the tears on her face, hurled at him to ask aloud, “Just what did I do wrong? I did not provoke you. Can’t you let me be? Do you not think of Ye Zhen when you see me? The woman you betrayed and killed, don’t you feel even a little guilty when you go to bed every night?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter to Zhen who you look like.” Although Mo Rong Zhan was plastered with filth, he was still imposing, not a bit embarrassed. “Zhen has never felt guilty for Ye Zhen. Zhen does not owe her!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen suddenly laughed. “Right, Ye Zhen is no more than an insignificant woman to you. There are so many women in your harem, which one do you truly care about?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan slightly squinted at Ye Zhen. “Lu Yaoyao, what do you want? Zhen can give it to you.”</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, you are joking. You cannot give me what I want. Please let me go for the sake of the Lu Family,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice, her face so pale and body frail.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Mo Rongzhan looked at her intently and asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked up at him. The irony of her life was just too funny. This man had been the root of it all, then and now. When she was determined to marry him, she had only one desire in her heart, no matter how many lives she took, this wouldn’t change. “I only desire for a man who will never leave me. I just want to spend my life with my beloved. He doesn’t have to have a high post, wealth, or glory and splendor as long as he is sincere and stays with me all his life. This is what I want, Your Imperial Majesty.” Her voice was low but resolute.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her silently, and recalled what he had thought of her these past few days. Originally, because she resembled Ye Zhen, his interest in her was not as strong, but he didn’t know why looking at other women in the palace, he missed her more and more .. to the point that even if she resembled Ye Zhen, it didn’t matter anymore.</p>
<p>So, knowing that Mo Rongyi was coming to meet her today, he came along and just to see her. Looking at her standing beside the little prince, garbed in men’s clothing evoked in him have an urge to catch her and hide her in his arms so that no man could see her. She did not look like a man but was more charming and lovelier than when she was dressed in women’s clothing.</p>
<p>She has seen her take the opportunity to provoke Mo Rongyi to fight with Xie Longyuan. He had immediately sent people to protect the little prince and then took her away while taking advantage of the ensuing commotion. He just wanted to say a few words to her, but when he held her in his arms, he couldn’t help but want to kiss her.</p>
<p>But she actually threw up … How much she loathed him …. She also said that she wanted to stay with her beloved … Mo Rongzhan’s heart seemed to have been struck with something inexplicable, he had a sudden impulse to kill someone.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, please let me go.” Ye Zhen saw that he remained mum, so she urged again in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Do you have someone in mind?” Mo Rongzhan leveled his gaze at her and asked coldly.</p>
