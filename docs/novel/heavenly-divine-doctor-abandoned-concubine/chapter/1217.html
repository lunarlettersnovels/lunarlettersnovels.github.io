<p>“Are you talking about the late Wang Fei Ye?” Ye Zhen lowered her head and asked softly.</p>
<p>Instantly, Xu Lao’s cold eyes fixed on the young miss opposite him. Instead of answering her question, he squinted his eyes, propped his elbow on the table, and asked, “Whose daughter are you?”</p>
<p>“My father’s name is Lu Shiming, and my mother’s name is Pei Shi. For fifteen years, I have been living in the border town.”</p>
<p>Xu Lao nodded, his shoulders visibly loosening up. “To answer your query, yes, I am talking about the late wang fei. You must have heard of the tragedy.” Xu Lao was momentarily lost in the memories. He remembered all of it, the annihilation of the Ye Clan.</p>
<p>“Sir, do you think all of them deserved to die?”</p>
<p>“Some deserve to die; some don’t!” Xu Lao looked at her. “Are you Lu Shiming’s biological daughter?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen fisted her hands. She must get Xu Lao’s trust before Lu Lingzhi could manipulate him. And she only knew one way– she must give him a fragment of her connection to her father, who was his friend.</p>
<p>“No, I am his adopted daughter. Not anyone knows about it, but now Lord Xu does.” Ye Zhen answered without hesitation. The old man was astonished, his eyes widening by a fraction but before he could speak, Ye Zhen beat him into it.</p>
<p>“Sir, who don’t you think deserved to die in the Ye Family? Ye Yiqing?” Ye Zhen boldly inquired.</p>
<p>“Yes, he didn’t deserve to die!” Xu Lao sat down again, and his voice gradually became soft as he was reminded of his old friend.</p>
<p>“There were not many good people in the Ye Family, he was one of the good people I know.” Ye Zhen picked up the stone in her hand and gently lowered it, making her first move.</p>
<p>“But he is dead, and both his children too.” Xu Lao stared at Ye Zhen in silence.</p>
<p>“What is your relationship with Ye Yiqing?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know…” Ye Zhen shook her head. “Since others say I look like the Wang Fei of the Qin Dynasty, I may have something to do with the Ye Family.”</p>
<p>“I have never heard Yiqing say that he has another daughter. However, if you are really connected to the Ye, you have at least got away from the extermination. Maybe you can meet him in the future,” Xu Lao said with a sigh.</p>
<p><i>Meet</i> <i>him</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>future?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen heard something strange in Xu Lao’s tone. It was as if he was insinuating that her father was still alive! She squeezed the black stone in her hand. “What did you say, Sir?”</p>
<p>Xu Lao looked down and said, “This old man collected the corpses of his friends. There were 130 people in the Ye Family, but there was no Ye Yiqing and his son’s corpses that I found! Maybe they have escaped!”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” Ye Zhen wanted to control her emotions, but she still trembled and held her hands together.</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say… Ye Yiqing and his son, they might be still alive?”</p>
<p>“This old man didn’t find their bodies, so there’s a strong possibility of them being alive,” Xu Lao said that as for whether they were alive or not, he was not certain.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s hands trembled so much that she grabbed a handful of her skirt, uncontrolled, her eyes welled up with tears, but she held them back as hard as she could.</p>
<p>“They must not be dead yet!”</p>
<p><i>Father</i> <i>is</i> <i>so</i> <i>powerful,</i> <i>so omnipotent,</i> <i>how</i> <i>could</i> <i>I</i> <i>have believed</i> <i>that</i> <i>they</i> <i>died?</i></p>
<p><i>Yes, she had also dreamed of her father, he had told her to wait for him… He must still be alive!</i></p>
<p>Xu Lao looked at Ye Zhen, who appeared to be rejoicing over this very fact. In his heart, he already understood her identity. However, considering that the Ye Family was still a topic that could not be mentioned, he hid all his guesses in his heart and pretended not to know anything.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen walked back and forth in the waterside pavilion for several times, and finally suppressed her excitement. She looked back at Xu Lao. “Lord Xu, what do you think… if Ye Yiqing is not dead, where would he have gone to?”</p>
<p>“I always heard him say that he wanted to live by the sea,” Xu Lao said, “Yes… that’s what he said.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed and remembered that her father always loved the sea. She took a deep breath, steadied her surging excitement, sat down again, and said in a calm voice, “Lord Xu, let’s play <i>Go</i> now.”</p>
<p>She felt happier than ever before. In this world, she cared most about her father and elder brother. Now that she knew they may still be alive, she seemed to see a little light in the dark. She would find them, this she promised to herself. For their sake, she would live well.</p>
<p><i>Father,</i> <i>Second</i> <i>Brother!</i> <i>You</i> <i>must</i> <i>wait</i> <i>for</i> <i>me</i> <i>to</i> <i>come</i> <i>and</i> <i>find</i> <i>you! </i></p>
