            <p><strong>Chapter 436 – She Cannot Afford to Love Him</strong></p>
<p>Outside the chambers, Eunuch Fu had already heard the little movements within and was feeling a little uneasy.</p>
<p><em>I don’t know if the princess will provoke the emperor again this time.</em></p>
<p>In the past two days, he had been really frightened while serving his master, fearing that if he made one careless mistake, he would have to pay with his head..</p>
<p>There was no princess within but his astute nose caught a whiff of love in the air. His eyes lit up.</p>
<p><em>Hey, hey, the emperor will definitely not be angry if he has enough food and drink.</em></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu saw that the place where the emperor read the memorials on weekdays was a bit messy, and there seemed to be unidentifiable things on the blanket. Looking at the dragon bed, although the emperor had pulled down all the curtains, with his relaxed appearance it wasn’t hard to imagine what had happened not too long ago.</p>
<p>“Fude, fetch some water, I want to take a shower.” Mo Rongzhan faintly ordered.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu hurriedly lowered his head and didn’t dare to look anymore. “Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Go find a new set of clothes for… the princess,” the emperor said softly again, looking at his aide with a little chill in his eyes.</p>
<p>“This slave will prepare it himself.” Eunuch Fu knew too well that since the emperor had mentioned that it was the princess, he must not want to let others know what had transpired, so he naturally didn’t dare to assign the task to others.</p>
<p><em>In fact, wouldn’t it have been all right if Miss Lu had not been conferred the title of princess in the first place? The emperor is looking for hardships himself. Who knows what the empress dowager would think, when she hears about this?</em></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu muttered all that in his heart, but he knew, no matter what, it would never be his turn to speak up about these things. He just had to serve his masters adequately in silence.</p>
<p>Soon, he had prepared hot water and clothes, and loyally guarded the entrance to the chambers outside.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ye Zhen, who was lying on the dragon seat, was already too ashamed to see anyone. Thus, she glared at Mo Rongzhan fiercely, only to see a pleasant smile on the other’s thin lips as he picked her up.</p>
<p>“<em>Zhen</em> will take you to freshen up.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go by myself!” she said angrily.</p>
<p>However, Mo Rongzhan turned a deaf ear. Not only did he carry her into a clean room but also personally scrubbed her clean. Without a choice, Ye Zhen could only lean on his arms stiffly. Their skin was sticking so closely together that she could feel the heat that was pressed against her back, and her face stiffened. She was afraid that he would treat her like that once more.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, what is that smell on your body? It is so fragrant…,” he asked as he grasped her plump chest, feeling as if it were two balls of cotton in his hands. He fondled admiringly while kissing her delicate shoulder that shone like pearls.</p>
<p>Her shoulders shrank away, and she tried to push his unruly hands away from her. “Mo Rongzhan, you promised me.”</p>
<p>However, the man just murmured hoarsely as he turned her around and lowered his head, kissing her pink lips while increasing the strength of his caresses.</p>
<p>“No….” Her whole body softened and she felt even dizzier as she soaked in the warm water.</p>
<p>His arms tightened, and he hugged her even closer as he deepened his kiss, reluctant to part from her. After today, she would most definitely be far away from him, and it was very difficult for him to imagine he would be as close as he was right now to her. Thus, he could only do this.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was breathless after his deep and lingering kisses, subconsciously stretching her hands and putting them around his neck. Unfortunately, her fingers accidentally touched the wound on his shoulder, causing him to hiss in pain and finally letting her go.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, <em>zhen </em>will keep you at his side every day, all right?” he said as he gasped out, looking at her red and swollen pink lips with scorching eyes.</p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan!” Ye Zhen glared in anger. <em>Could it be that he wants to go back on his own words?</em></p>
<p>His husky voice broke into laughter in spite of himself as he lightly caressed her cheeks. His voice was gentle as well as alluring. “Yaoyao, you are already my person, and you can only marry me in this lifetime. Even if someone wants to, you can’t agree and betroth yourself to them. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen kept her head down and did not speak. Her innocence was no more. If she remarries another person, it will naturally be unfair to her future husband. She did not need to marry again. As long as she was able to find her father and brother, she would leave this place immediately and go to where no one knows her and live the life she wants again.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao….” Mo Rongzhan called out to her anxiously.</p>
<p>“You let me get up first. If you are like such… I can’t talk to you properly,” she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>He laughed, biting her earlobe. “Do you hate me doing this to you?”</p>
<p>If she said she hated him, he would definitely not let her go. She remained silent, but he took it as she was shy and did not dare to speak. His happy laughter could be heard beside her ear. “Within one year, <em>zhen</em> will confer the title of Empress on you. Yaoyao you are not allowed to refuse me anymore.”</p>
<p>“Why did you save my father?” She looked up at him. <em>Didn’t he hate the Ye family deeply? Why would he send people to assist my father and brother?</em></p>
<p>“Ye Yiqing has helped me before. He is different from Ye Yisong.” Mo Rongzhan said lightly, “Even though everything he did before was for his daughter.”</p>
