<p>At Ye Zhen’s answer, Teacher Shan looked at her in fascination, as if to find out if she meant what she said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked back at her with clear and calm eyes, then turned her gaze over on the beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>“You are special.” Teacher Shan mumbled to herself as she came to realize that amongst the Lu Family, Lu Yaoyao was indeed special, different in many ways.</p>
<p>“Teacher, why don’t we go somewhere else?”</p>
<p>Not long from now, Mo Rongzhan would certainly come back here with Lu Wushuang and Ye Zhen wanted to steer clear from fostering any interaction with them.</p>
<p>At first, she thought that she would be very excited to see Mo Rongzhan again, but at this time, she was rather withdrawn, and her heart’s excitement had ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan also seemed unwilling to mingle further in the company of the ladies and agreed to Ye Zhen’s proposal. They excused themselves and walked in the direction opposite to the couple to avoid undesired meetings.</p>
<p>However, the odds weren’t in her favor and she found Lu Lingzhi on the other side! The thought of enjoying flowers in peace by avoiding Mo Rongzhan and Lu Wushuang turned out to be a useless attempt!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Ye Zhen carried on with her stroll in the garden as if his presence didn’t bother her. If she left, she would be definitely giving room for suspicion in Teacher Shan’s mind.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi knew that Wang Fei Lu, his dear sister, was enjoying the flowers in the forest. He thought that Yaoyao would be accompanying her at this time and probably, in the company of the emperor too!</p>
<p>With his sister and the emperor not in plain sight, he just wished silently that Lu Yaoyao wasn’t with them. He was still worried that the emperor would be reminded of Ye Zhen the moment he laid eyes on Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>By the time he’d seen Ye Zhen not far away, talking with Teacher Shan, the famous academician in Jin country. Lu Lingzhi felt like a burden had just been lifted off his chest. He wondered what they were talking about, especially when Ye Zhen’s face slowly brightened up, followed by her sweet laughter.</p>
<p>The laugh was sweet and charming. Suddenly, his nostrils were filled with the fragrance coming out of the earth. <i>Autumn</i>, Ye Zhen’s favorite time of the year.</p>
<p>Funny, she also used to laugh like that. But it was a long time ago, he shook off the memory.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at?” Some of Lu Lingzhi’s companions noticed his indifference to their conversation and quickly snatched his attention back.</p>
<p>A total of five or six people on his side were young men who had followed Mo Rongzhan to conquer the world. When they saw Lu Lingzhi’s eyes directed behind them, they also looked behind to see what had gotten him captivated.</p>
<p>They happened to see Ye Zhen picking up a pink <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=crab+apple+flower&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03uMpB2QbpmQ7WF9KvnpY8SZlO8WA:1595082881264&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLqZnkgtfqAhVMGaYKHefnCWcQ_AUoAXoECBwQAw&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667">crab apple flower</a> from a tree and pin it to her temples with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Ah! I’d never thought I’d see the day where our dear Lu Lingzhi, a man of iron heart, would stare like a besotted fool at a little girl!” A handsome man beside him named Tang Zhen burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi glanced back at him annoyingly and said, “Don’t talk nonsense!”</p>
<p>“Don’t wait until we ask which family the girl is from, and then the brothers will propose for you!”</p>
<p>The laughter was too loud, it was impossible for Ye Zhen to act deaf of it, but she must remain detached from the commotion for she knew Lu Lingzhi was a part of it.</p>
<p>“Teacher, let’s go somewhere else.” Ye Zhen asked Teacher Shan as she really had no intention of paying greetings to Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan gave a confused look at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p><i>What’s the matter with this little girl?</i> <i>Lu Lingzhi is her eldest brother. In the future, she may have to rely on him to have a better future. Why doesn’t she seem to like him and avoids him like plague?</i></p>
<p>“Yaoyao!” Lu Lingzhi had already stopped Ye Zhen in her tracks. Her shoulder stiffened as she held her breath.</p>
<p>Alas! It was too late to leave!</p>
