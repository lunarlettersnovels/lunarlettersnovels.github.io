            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 174 – Guilt</strong></p>
<p>After Lu Lingzhi sent Ye Zhen to the academy, he proceeded to the imperial palace and visited his sister, Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, I think you should prepare for the war in the Camp Xishan instead of being here.”</p>
<p>She was no fool–she already guessed her brother’s intent in visiting her today. Grumbling to herself, Lu Wushuang expressed her distaste towards Lu Lingzhi’s presence in the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, the palace she resided in.</p>
<p>“The camp can wait, Wang Fei. I visited because I have something to say to you.”</p>
<p><i>“</i>What does my brother wants to say?”</p>
<p>Just by her tone, one could tell she was brimming with impatience<i>. </i></p>
<p><i>He probably came here to talk about Lu Yaoyao! Grandmother must have told him, otherwise, why else would he spare me a visit today?</i></p>
<p>“Did Grandmother tell you? Do not worry; I will not act impulsively anymore. If the empress dowager wants another concubine to enter the palace, let her. I will not stop her.”</p>
<p>A nimble nod from Lu Lingzhi returned her words, hence, the ever snappish Lu Wushuang thought that he would finally leave her to her peace…</p>
<p>Yet, Lu Lingzhi stood, unmoving, having another concern he wished to relay.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, I’m glad that you were able to think through the flaws of your actions. But there is another thing I must discuss with you– it’s Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>As the name of the person she had now vowed to destroy was mentioned, Lu Wushuang raised her cold eyes to her brother hurtfully.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, did you come to the palace solely for that girl?”</p>
<p>When Lu Lingzhi neither admitted nor denied, one thing became clear to her…</p>
<p>Her hunch turned out to be right–Lu Yaoyao had gained too much importance in the Lu Family than what she preferred.</p>
<p>Sensing the displeasure in her words, Lu Lingzhi instantly became aware of his sister’s feelings towards Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, Yaoyao grew up in the border town from an early age. Her temper is unrestrained, and her mind simple. She will definitely not do anything against you. Yesterday was just a misunderstanding. I hope Wang Fei will not take it to heart.”</p>
<p><i>Does she have a simple mind? </i>Lu Wushuang sneered<i>. Anyone who skillfully maneuvers herself to be in the exact place as the emperor is no simpleton!</i></p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, you do not know her well enough. How dare she insult me by getting comfortable with Mo Rongzhan?”</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, it’s because Yaoyao does not understand anything, and you being hard on her makes things complicated. Her meeting the emperor yesterday is a coincidence, not intentional.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, I think you are confused.” Lu Wushuang glared at him. With a sour tone, she said, “Did you believe what she said? It cannot be a coincidence!”</p>
<p>“I believe Yaoyao, who is our cousin, will definitely not do anything against our family,” Lu Lingzhi said without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother now only has Yaoyao as his sister in his heart. Am I nothing to him now?”</p>
<p>Yesterday, she felt that her grandmother especially fawned over Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p><i>Has Lu Yaoyao already replaced her in the Lu Family?</i></p>
<p>“What is Wang Fei talking about? You and Yaoyao are my sisters.” Lu Lingzhi uttered helplessly.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, if you want me to believe Yaoyao has no ill-motives against me, then let her marry as soon as possible. Only in this way will I be able to accept her as my sister,” Lu Wushuang said.</p>
<p>She knew Lu Lingzhi cared about all the members of the Lu Family, but he cared for her the most. He was always indifferent to his other sisters except her. Yet, this time… she felt that this had somehow changed.</p>
<p>He was so concerned about Yaoyao, to the point of explaining on her behalf. This was the first time Lu Wushuang saw him care about another person rather than her.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s face sank. “Wang Fei, Yaoyao’s marriage is to be decided by Third Uncle and Third Aunt. We should not interfere.”</p>
<p>“I, the wang fei of this country, have bestowed her marriage. Is there anything else that you find unsatisfactory?” Lu Wushuang proudly declared.</p>
<p>With this childish exercise of her powers, Lu Lingzhi’s face sank, and he countered her.</p>
<p>“Even if you are the wang fei, you do not have the right to decide for other people’s lives–especially a sacred bond such as marriage. Sister, I hope you do not portray this behavior in front of anyone else.”</p>
<p>“This behavior?” Lu Wushuang stubbornly hit the table with her bare hands and stood up sharply. “You all favor her; all of you! Is Lu Yaoyao better than me?!”</p>
<p>Her eyes shone with malevolence, as she stared daggers at the person who used to treasure her the most in this world.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, are you going to send her to the palace to replace me when I fall out of the emperor’s favor?”</p>
<p>A wry smile fell on Lu Lingzhi’s lips. “Wang Fei, how could you think such things?”</p>
<p>“Am I correct? Soon, there will be more and more concubines in this harem. When I lose the emperor’s favor, would there still be a place for me in this palace?”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang felt extremely wronged. Life in this palace was utterly different from what she had imagined.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, as long as you do not do anything wrong, the emperor would keep you. After all, he believes that you saved his life. As for Yaoyao, I will not let her enter the palace.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, you know best the things we did just to be with the emperor,” Lu Wushuang said with grievance, “I would hate to see it all in vain.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked at Lu Wushuang’s disheveled appearance and felt pity–she must not have slept a wink last night. He lowered his voice and asked her gently, “Shuang’er, why are you so afraid of losing the emperor’s favor? Why are you so guilty? The… the truth will prevail the more you dread it.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother…” Lu Wushuang sounded feeble, her face looked resigned and exhausted.</p>
<p>Day and night, she worried that Mo Rongzhan would know the truth one day. And with the emperor’s sudden coldness to her, she became paranoid that he would look at other women.</p>
<p>“Ye Zhen is dead. No one will reveal our secret. Why do you act so guilty?”</p>
<p>“I cannot find out what her nickname is.” She gnashed her teeth in absolute misery.</p>
<p>She had thought it would be easy to find out, but even after she had sent someone to investigate, it was fruitless.</p>
<p>“Did you send someone to find out?”</p>
<p>When Lu Wushuang looked away from him, ignoring the question, Lu Lingzhi felt terror sinking in his veins.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei! Are you out of your mind? Do you want the emperor to know? How sure are you that the person whom you ordered could be trusted?!”</p>
<p>Unhappy at being reprimanded so suddenly, Lu Wushuang curled her lip in defiance.</p>
<p>“We did not continue to investigate.”</p>
<p>“You are simply careless! Now the emperor has doubts, and we cannot do anything about it.” Lu Lingzhi turned blue with anger.</p>
<p>“I know.” Lu Wushuang nodded, panic surging inside her. The fear of losing everything soon became more relevant.</p>
<p>“As for Yaoyao, it’s not what you think. She is not that kind of person. But, do not worry, for I will find a marriage for her in the future.”</p>
<p>He stood up to leave.</p>
<p>“If you cannot find it in yourself to like her, do not summon her to the imperial palace again, so the emperor will not have a chance to see her.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang stayed silent.</p>
<p>“I must leave now.”</p>
<p>Since Lu Wushuang did not want to talk about Lu Yaoyao anymore, Lu Lingzhi did not persist further. He then turned on his heels, intending to leave once and for all.</p>
<p>But just before he went out of her sight, Lu Wushuang spoke in a soft voice and called his attention.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, please take care of yourself on your trip to Camp Xishan.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your concern.” Lu Lingzhi could not help but chuckle.</p>
<p>Despite everything, she was still his little sister, and there is nothing he would not do for her.</p>
