            <p><strong>Chapter 524 – Finally Met</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that Mu Qing wasn’t unwilling to see Huangfu Chen, but it was just that she didn’t know how to face him. They had separated because of a misunderstanding. Now that she was married to Zhao Mingxiao, she hadn’t found out what had happened back then. When she sees Huangfu Chen, she wouldn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>She (YZ) wondered why Huangfu Chen didn’t move at all. He was clearly in the house, so it was impossible for him not to have heard Mu Qing’s voice.</p>
<p>Just as they were contemplating, the door creaked open and Huangfu Chen’s graceful figure appeared in their sight.</p>
<p>Mu Qing was slightly startled and looked up. The elegant and handsome man from her memory did not seem to have changed much. It was just that there was an extra calmness around his eyes. He was silently looking at her, bringing back the past to life.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes lit up. “Master, so you’re inside.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Sister, let’s go back.” When Mu Xue saw Huangfu Chen, she immediately pulled Mu Qing to leave.</p>
<p>Mu Qing glanced at her sister, torn between leaving and staying.</p>
<p>“Wait a little longer,” Mu Qing whispered to her sister. She had brought Mu Xue to apologize to Lu Yaoyao this time because she was hoping to see Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, she also wanted to know what had happened back then.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen went over and grabbed Mu Xue’s hand. “Don’t you need to see your Second Young Master right now? I’m going to find him, come with me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going!” Mu Xue shouted.</p>
<p>“Maybe your Second Young Master is looking for you.” Ye Zhen dragged Mu Xue away.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen and Mu Qing were now the only ones left in the courtyard. For a while, no one broke the silence. They were speechless, for neither knew what to say.</p>
<p>“Let’s sit down in the pavilion and talk,” Huangfu Chen whispered in the end.</p>
<p>Mu Qing nodded and followed Huangfu Chen to the pavilion. She lowered her head slightly. After so many years, she thought that she would never see him again. She did not expect him to be in front of her now.</p>
<p>“The letter that year…”</p>
<p>The two of them had just sat down in the pavilion when they spoke in unison.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at Mu Qing and smiled warmly. “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>The awkwardness between the two of them instantly disappeared because of the tacit understanding.</p>
<p>Mu Qing smiled faintly. “Xiao Fei has already given me the letter. It’s my handwriting, but I didn’t write it.”</p>
<p>“I know.” Huangfu Chen looked at her gently. “I went to Spirit Snake Island and then knew that you didn’t write that letter.”</p>
<p>Mu Qing looked up in surprise. “Did you go to Spirit Snake Island?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen nodded his head gently and told her that he had been seriously injured when he went to Spirit Snake Island and then came back to look for her. However, he couldn’t find her. He thought that she had left Zhao Jia Island, so he went to look for her everywhere. And because he was badly injured and hidden in Niujia Village, he didn’t know that she had married Zhao Mingxiao for many years.</p>
<p>“…I went to look for you.” Mu Qing murmured, “I didn’t believe that you would let someone sneak attack Zhao Jia Island. That’s why I left the island to find you. I couldn’t find you, so I returned here.”</p>
<p>So, they had missed each other.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen didn’t know what to say, but he couldn’t help but look at her with grief. “Have you been well these past few years?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” Mu Qing said. Aside from not growing old with her beloved, there was nothing wrong with her.</p>
<p>“…That’s good.” Huangfu Chen whispered. Although she was already someone else’s wife, as long as she lived well, he had no regrets.</p>
<p>Hearing the bitterness in Huangfu Chen’s words, Mu Qing’s eyes suddenly turned sour. If it hadn’t been for that letter, they wouldn’t have separated.</p>
<p>“That letter…” Mu Qing spoke with a choked voice. She quickly stopped and calmed down before continuing, “I don’t know who wrote it. It can’t be Xiao Fei. It’s impossible for him to copy my handwriting.”</p>
<p>“I know.” Huangfu Chen nodded.</p>
<p>He probably knew who wrote it, but there was no evidence. Even if he proved that <em>that</em> person wrote it, it would probably be useless.</p>
<p>Mu Qing smiled at Huangfu Chen and stopped talking about the past. “You didn’t accept apprentices in the past? Why is there a little apprentice this time? That little girl looks like a beautiful flower.”</p>
<p>“People always change.” Huangfu Chen said, “Besides, Yaoyao is a very talented person. If you were with her, you would like her too.”</p>
<p><em>Does that mean that he also likes Lu Yaoyao?</em> Mu Qing smiled bitterly in her heart. “I should head back.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen stood up and looked at her. “Mu Qing, I heard Mu Xue say that you’re not well…”</p>
<p>Mu Qing interrupted Huangfu Chen expressionlessly, “I’m fine, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao’s medical skills are superb. Let her treat you.” Huangfu Chen sighed.</p>
<p>“I know.” Mu Qing probably knew that her tone wasn’t good, so she took a moment before answering in a low voice. She didn’t want Huangfu Chen to know that she couldn’t have children, and she didn’t want him to know that she wanted to be treated because of Zhao Mingxiao.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen could not say anything else, so he could only allow her to go. They looked at each other, not knowing what else to say.</p>
<p>“Farewell.” Mu Qing lowered her head and walked out.</p>
<p>On the other side of the courtyard, after Ye Zhen had dragged Mu Xue over to Zhao Tianji, she no longer cared about her. Zhao Tianji knew that Mu Qing was talking to Huangfu Chen, so he signaled Liang Yin to keep an eye on Mu Xue.</p>
<p>Mu Xue stomped her feet in anger. “Second Young Master, how could you do this?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji glanced at her indifferently. “Is there anything I can’t do?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled from the side and looked at Zhao Tianji who was walking slowly. “You’re walking better and better.”</p>
<p>In fact, Zhao Tianji could already walk faster. However, he had been in a wheelchair for too long that he felt it was very precious to take a step by himself, so he would rather walk slowly.</p>
<p>“Do you want to ask me for medical fees again?” He looked at Ye Zhen and assumed that she wanted to ask him for medical fees.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen walked to his side and said with a smile, “I don’t miss that bit of consultation money. Island Lord Zhao, I have something I want to ask you about.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji squinted at her with suspicion and said, “I’ll rather give you a consultation fee. It’s probably not a good thing to see you like this.”</p>
<p>“Oh, forget it. You continue with your walking.” Ye Zhen raised her eyebrows and turned to leave.</p>
<p>“Wait, I have something to ask you too.” Zhao Tianji stopped her. “Now that I can walk freely, when can I use my internal strength again?”</p>
<p>He was a martial artist, so not using his internal strength was like a drunkard who couldn’t drink. He felt very unhappy.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji was not allowed to use his internal strength because his meridians had been blocked. Now that they had been cleared by acupuncture and moxibustion, as long as he did not cultivate the internal strength of the Zhao Jia family, there would be no problem.</p>
<p>“Other than your family’s internal strength, anything else is all right…,” Ye Zhen said. “Have you seen Ye Shi before?”</p>
