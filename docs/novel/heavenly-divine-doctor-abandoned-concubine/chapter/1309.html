            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 18 – Apprentice (2)</h3>
<p>Shifting in her seat, Pei Shi put down her books and reached out to hold Ye Zhen’s hands. “Yaoyao, did the old madam oblige you to go? Or, is this your choice?”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu could be very impulsive sometimes. Pei Shi was afraid she was forcing her daughter to follow in the footsteps of the other Lu Sisters.</p>
<p>Lu Yaoyao was a carefree, willful girl of the border town, and Pei Shi would let her stay that way if it meant her daughter’s happiness and contentment.</p>
<p>“I want to go, Mother.” Ye Zhen whispered as she squeezed Pei Shi’s hands, offering her reassurance.</p>
<p>“There is no Academy for Women in the border town. Since you were a child, I haven’t restricted you to learn anything that you have wanted to. However, learning is far different in the academy. It is much more complicated.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi thought that her daughter’s decision to enter the academy was for the sole purpose of having fun. She wanted to warn her of the consequences lest she brings trouble upon herself.</p>
<p>It seemed that her sister’s playful nature was giving Pei Shi doubts, so Ye Zhen remained undeterred and stood by her decision.</p>
<p>“Mother, we will probably not return to the border town in the future. Eldest Brother is now the assistant minister of war and will definitely continue to be promoted in the future. I can also see it that my elder brother will also enter the civil services in the future. He will eventually leave me behind here. I cannot continue being a wild girl and spend my days in rainbows and sunshine. I’m already fifteen, I want to learn in the academy, something that a twelve-year-old girl here does.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the pile of books near them. “Besides, I have learned medicine from you since when I was young. It’s most appropriate for me to go to the School of Medicine. I want to test my capabilities.”</p>
<p>Less than a month of stay in the capital and Lu Yaoyao already had new ideas in her head. <i>Was there someone feeding her with these ideas?</i></p>
<p>“Did someone tell you this? Has anyone questioned your capabilities?” Pei Shi asked with a heavy voice.</p>
<p>Cold fear ran down her spine; Ye Zhen had forgotten her sister’s character! Lu Yaoyao rarely had an opinion of her own. She was careless and never had an inclination towards her education.</p>
<p>“No one said anything but… I seem to be a little out of place when I see my second and fourth sisters.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen reasoned while looking at the floor beneath her.</p>
<p>Pei Shi laughed. She had never viewed her daughter’s simplicity as a shortcoming. But if she felt like this, then it was Pei Shi’s desire to relieve her of this self-doubt.</p>
<p>“The entrance examination for the Academy for Women will not be easy. You didn’t like to learn those things when you were still a child. What if you do not pass the exam?”</p>
<p>“I plan not to. In the end, it is just four parts effort and six parts luck. I have at least half a month to train and study.” Ye Zhen spoke in a determined voice before asking slyly, “Mother, didn’t you say I am smart? I will pass if I choose to.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi nodded. “Well then, I’ll find someone to train you.”</p>
<p>She was happy to see the positive change in her daughter and did not want to discourage or deprive her of a chance. Results were secondary, she had to at least let her have a fair go at the challenge and for that, preparation was important.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mother!” Ye Zhen hugged Pei Shi’s arms, her face wearing a gleeful smile and cheeks red out of happiness.</p>
<p>“No matter how old you get, you are still a child to me.” Pei Shi embraced her daughter. “If you want to read these books, let people take them to your Eastern Chambers.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mother.”</p>
<p>Right now, Ye Zhen needed to read more of these books on medicine. Although she was armed with Lu Yaoyao’s memories, medical science was a broad body of knowledge. More was less, and she didn’t want to be complacent.</p>
<p>Moreover, Lu Yaoyao hadn’t devoted herself hard in studying as she didn’t have much interest in medicine. Needless to say, she lacked knowledge and now was the time to fill up as much as she could.</p>
<p>She summoned the servants, had them carry the books, and kissed Pei Shi goodbye. Really, her sister was lucky; she had a doting mother, one thing that Ye Zhen didn’t have.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>True to her words, Pei Shi didn’t let the days pass without accomplishing her mission of finding an instructor for Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>It was someone from the Academy for Women who had resigned due to a certain disagreement with her boss. Rumors had it that she would rather be a private teacher than continue working with people who didn’t share the same principles as hers.</p>
<p>Despite her resignation, she was still famous- not only in the capital but also in the entire Jin country. How many ladies of noble families had invited her to be their teacher and were turned down? Surely, a lot.</p>
<p>It felt like she was once again the young Ye Zhen who was about to meet her teacher – the stone-cold Teacher Shan. The same teacher who had taught her to ace the academy before.</p>
<p>As soon as Pei Shi mentioned her, Ye Zhen was so stunned she couldn’t speak for a minute or longer.</p>
<p><i>But how?</i> <i>How come a teacher like her had decided to teach someone such as Lu Yaoyao privately?</i></p>
<p><i>Not only that, but Pei Shi had also arranged their first session immediately.</i></p>
<p>“The rules of Teacher Shan will be handed over to you later,” said Pei Shi who appeared extra polite today.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan was about 25 to 26 years old, tall, thin, with delicate features. She was indeed beautiful. Having an air of indifference about her, she looked unapproachable. She was a prominent talented scholar in the capital. Born into a prestigious family, she later became a widow. Since her mother-in-law couldn’t accommodate her, she joined the Academy for Women as a teacher.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Pei Shi could get along with her really well; she was able to even persuade her to be Ye Zhen’s teacher quite successfully!</p>
<p>Ye Zhen went forward to pay her respect and bowed accordingly. “It’s my pleasure having you as my teacher, Teacher. Forgive me for I wasn’t able to prepare even a small gift.”</p>
<p>When she saw Ye Zhen, Teacher Shan’s eyes flashed with surprise. However, she was quick to mask it.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, you and I will be master and apprentice. Rise, we don’t have to follow the ritual<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>.”</p>
<p>She was here to teach Lu Yaoyao how to pass the examination, not be her husband. Her indifference was expected for she knew her back in the academy as a person of unpleasant temperament. When she was still her student, she was also aloof to her. But later on, their relationship gradually became that of friends.</p>
<p><i>But how could Teacher Shan, a proud woman, promise to come to Lu Yaoyao’s aid? </i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew better than anyone how hard it was to invite her, let alone deal with her. How Pei Shi did it baffled her to no end.</p>
