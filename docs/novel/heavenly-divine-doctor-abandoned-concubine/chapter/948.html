            <p><strong>Chapter 381 – Do You Think You Can Hide From Me?</strong></p>
<p>The empress dowager was so happy tonight that she didn’t notice the peculiarity between the two.</p>
<p>In fact, Ye Zhen felt very uncomfortable. They ate happily, but she had no appetite at all now that Mo Rongzhan already knew that she was Ye Zhen’s sister. Although the biggest secret had yet to be revealed, she still didn’t want to face him.</p>
<p><em>Seeing him makes me think of what he said …</em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Is Zhen not good enough for you? If you don’t want me to be together with other women, then I won’t go.”</strong></em></p>
<p>If he had said this before, she would have been moved to tears, but now she can only feel very sad. <em>How could he treat Lu Yaoyao like this when he wouldn’t do the same for Ye Zhen?</em></p>
<p>She wallowed in self-pity. <em>How blind she was before, that she fell in love with him!</em> She thought to herself that she wouldn’t ever love him again.</p>
<p>The empress dowager’s appetite was excellent tonight. She ate all the medicated meals Ye Zhen made for her. The girl herself accompanied her for a while before the empress dowager asked her to return to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard.</p>
<p>“Aijia will come find you tomorrow,” the empress dowager said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt distressed for having the empress dowager say she would come to her. “Imperial Mother, there are many things to do in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard tomorrow. If you are free, I shall come to talk with you.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager smiled and waved. “Well then, go on, our future renowned physician for generations.”</p>
<p>“This prince will go with you.” Mo Rongyi immediately cried.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan held him back by the hand and said, “Accompany Imperial Mother.”</p>
<p>As soon as Ye Zhen left the Cining palace, she quickened her steps to return to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard. At this time, the sky was dim, and it would be dark if she didn’t get back immediately.</p>
<p>Passing by the imperial garden, she walked faster. Unfortunately, no matter how fast she walked, her pace couldn’t be as fast as the others. She had just walked into the cobblestone path in the garden, and someone behind her caught her by the arm and pulled her into the rockery nearby.</p>
<p>“Let me go!” Cried Ye Zhen, knowing too well who had caught her without actually looking who’s behind her.</p>
<p>“Do you think you can hide from me for a lifetime?” Mo Rongzhan clasped her in her arms, his dark eyes stared at her intently.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen angrily said, “You are always like this. Can I not avoid you?”</p>
<p>“If you are only willing to talk to me properly, how can I use this method?” Mo Rongzhan smiled in a low voice, staring down her cheeks panting with rage. “Yaoyao, don’t run away like a child.”</p>
<p>“I’m not running away.” Ye Zhen said coldly, “Your Majesty, what exactly do you want?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan said, firmly and decisively, “I want you.”</p>
<p>“Even if I am… <em><strong>Her</strong></em> sister?” she asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter to me who you are,” he said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled faintly. “But it is important to me. Why did my sister have to die? She had been married to you for two years, and you have no pity for her at all. You don’t even know what she looks like. Mo Rongzhan, you are so cold and fickle, and you expect me to fall in love with you? No. My fate will not be the same as that of Ye Zhen, so please, let me go.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan said with a deep voice, “Ye Zhen was only thirteen years old when she married me. I was going to the front line at that time, but I saw once … Yaoyao, I have too many old grievances with the Ye Family, which have nothing to do with you. You are surnamed Lu.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt that no matter what she said to Mo Rongzhan at this time, he would not give up. “Your Majesty, we can’t be happy with each other. Why do you insist?”</p>
<p>“You have Zhen in your heart.” Mo Rongzhan gently touched Ye Zhen’s chest with his fingers. “Yaoyao, don’t lie to yourself.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sneered and replied, obvious in her voice that she’s feeling weaker and weaker. “You promised to give me time.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan chuckled. “Then don’t avoid me. You are always like this. Aren’t you afraid of the empress dowager’s suspicion?”</p>
<p>If this went on, not only the empress dowager but the others would doubt as well.</p>
<p>“All right.” Ye Zhen nodded. He was the emperor and she couldn’t always avoid him.</p>
<p>“Do you prefer to reside in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard?” Mo Rongzhan asked softly, throwing his hands around her waist.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pushed him. “Your Majesty, are you not afraid of the empress dowager’s suspicion? Is there a brother holding one’s own sister like this? ”</p>
<p>Even though he didn’t want to, Mo Rongzhan had to let go of her. “I shouldn’t have let the empress dowager make you a princess.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Brother, I will only be a princess in my life,” Ye Zhen said, smiling.</p>
<p>“You have no blood relationship with me. It was only an imperial edict that made you  a princess.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stared at him, turned around, and went out of the rockery. “Imperial Brother, you don’t need to see me off. I know the way to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard.”</p>
<p>With that, she ran away quickly.</p>
