            <p><strong>Chapter 534 – Who Says Island Lord Can’t Walk?</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t even have time to see how Zhao Tianji and the others had managed to get to the Island Tower, she was dragged away by Ye Chunming from the beach, knocked unconscious, and locked inside a house.</p>
<p>When she woke up, Ye Chunming was nowhere in sight. She shouted loudly a few times but didn’t see anyone. The sky was already completely dark. She could not see the direction of the Island Tower but could only vaguely hear the cheers. It seemed the entire island knew Zhao Tianji was back.</p>
<p><em>What will Zhao Mingxiao do next? He will do something to Zhao Tianji, right?</em></p>
<p>She pushed the door but it was locked by a bronze padlock on the outside. No matter how s tried, she couldn’t get out at all.</p>
<p><em>A window?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes lit up, and she took out the silver arrow in her arm. Ever since she got to Zhao Jia island, she had hidden her sleeve arrows in her arm. Although she wouldn’t necessarily get hurt, she always needed to have something to defend herself with.</p>
<p>The windows and doors of the house are made of glass, this kind of glass was made by Qi Yanling later. It was originally a very precious thing, but it was only gradually and widely produced in recent years.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took a drum stool and smashed it against the window. The glass shattered. She carefully picked up a broken shard, stepped on the drum stool, and peered outside. It was dark, she could not sense anything. She used a silver arrow to pry open the window bolt. She opened the window and was about to leave when it suddenly turned bright. She looked up and saw Zhao Mingxiao’s gloomy face. It was even colder under the light of the torches.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen jumped down from the window and looked at the man with a smile, “Young Master Zhao, I didn’t expect we would meet again so soon.”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao looked at her with a smile too. “Ye Shi’s matter was done quickly, and you were lured out with only a few words just in time. When I become the emperor in the future, you will be the one paying tribute to the flag for my Zhao Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“The entire island knows that Zhao Tianji has returned. They only recognize Zhao Tianji as the Island Lord. Do you still have the chance to turn Zhao Jia Island into Zhao Kingdom?” Ye Zhen asked indifferently.</p>
<p>“So what? If the people on the island want to live a better life and don’t want to be trapped on this island, they will choose a king that suits them better. Zhao Tianji’s legs are useless, what else can he do other than live on this island?” Zhao Mingxiao no longer hid his contempt and resentment for his brother.</p>
<p><em>Could it be that Zhao Tianji hadn’t let anyone know that he had been healed?</em></p>
<p>“Young Master Zhao, have you seen Zhao Tianji? The Island Tower lit up… he should come out to meet everyone. Don’t you want to know how happy the people on the island are to see him? Listen, the cheers keep coming. It seems that everybody likes this Island Lord very much. If he can’t walk and had ended up a cripple for life, why do the people still like him so much? It only goes to show that… to the people, he is the only one who is the most suitable Island Lord.” Ye Zhen looked squarely at Zhao Mingxiao as his face got uglier and uglier with every word she vehemently spoke.</p>
<p>A young man holding a torch behind Zhao Mingxiao coldly snorted, “Master, this woman is talking nonsense to deceive people. Why don’t we kill her?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, kill her then arrest Zhao Tianji.” The others echoed the words.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao waved his hand. “We can’t kill her yet, she is the princess of the Jin Kingdom. Keep her, she will be useful in the future. You guys take her to Spirit Snake Island and watch her carefully. Don’t let her run away!”</p>
<p>He believed that Huangfu Chen would be looking everywhere for this Lu Yao Yao. In order to deal with Mo Rongzhan in the future, he had to capture this woman. Now that everyone knew Zhao Tianji had returned, so as not to create complications, he still had to hide her elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Yes, Master!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took two steps back, she absolutely could not let them catch her.</p>
<p><em>Swoosh…</em></p>
<p>As the two men were about to catch her, two silver rays shot through the air. Sharp silver arrows pierced them in the chest. Not waiting for the others to react, Ye Zhen turned and ran away.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao looked at the two subordinates who were seriously wounded by Ye Zhen and shouted in anger, “Go and get her! Go now!”</p>
<p>“Yes!” All of them chased after her with torches.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not know martial arts. The only skill she had to defend herself was her archery, not to mention that she was not familiar with the geographical situation of this Zhao Jia Island. She had wanted to run towards the Island Tower, but unfortunately, she was caught before she could even manage to put some distance between herself and her pursuers.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen was brought back to Zhao Mingxiao, Ye Chunming appeared.</p>
<p>“Ye Shi, you came just in time. This woman you captured was trying to escape, and it just so happened that I saw her and had someone capture her back,” Zhao Mingxiao said with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming frowned and said, “She can’t die.”</p>
<p>“No one is going to kill her. She still has a great use.” Zhao Mingxiao said with a smile, “Fortunately, you were the one who lured her out, otherwise… I wouldn’t have known how to catch her.”</p>
<p>“You ignored Zhao Tianji, just to catch her?” Ye Chunming’s eyes were a little cold, he could not explain to Zhao Mingxiao that Lu Yaoyao was the daughter his Ye family had lost since childhood and that he must conceal Lu Yaoyao’s identity in order to exact revenge.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao squinted and said, “So what if Zhao Tianji lights up the Island Tower? When we declare ourselves a nation, Mo Rongzhan will certainly send troops to attack us. And when that time comes… this Lu Yaoyao will be our hostage. Compared to Zhao Tianji, she is much more important.”</p>
<p>“You should go and see Zhao Tianji first,” Ye Chunming said in a cold voice, “and then determine whether you can claim the country or not. You should go and find out whether the people on this island embrace him or you.”</p>
<p>“Humph, a cripple, is it—” Zhao Mingxiao’s tone remained disdainful.</p>
<p>“Can a cripple go and light up the Island Tower by himself?” Ye Chunming asked coldly. “Ah Xiao, do you really know that brother of yours? Why do you think everyone is cheering?”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao froze. “What did you say?”</p>
<p>The corners of Ye Zhen’s lips were slightly raised as she looked at Zhao Mingxiao lightly.</p>
<p>“Go and see for yourself,” Ye Chunming said in a cold voice. “I came to find you just for this.”</p>
<p>“Arrest her first.” Zhao Mingxiao ordered his men, still not forgetting to lock up Ye Zhen, “Don’t let her get away!”</p>
<p>Ye Chunming frowned at him and forced himself to hold back. “Go over to the Island Tower now.”</p>
<p>“Do you still want to take me to Spirit Snake Island?” Ye Zhen shouted at Zhao Mingxiao’s back, also reminding Ye Chunming to look for her on Spirit Snake Island if he couldn’t find her.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao didn’t even pay attention to her, only a cold glint flashed through his eyes.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming glanced back at Ye Zhen and disappeared into the night together with Zhao Mingxiao.</p>
<p>“If you guys lock me up, your Island Lord won’t let you off,” Ye Zhen turned and said to the few brawny men around her.</p>
<p>“The Island Lord? Who’s afraid of him?”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha… he’s just a piece of trash who can’t walk.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed lightly and remarked, “Who said your Island Lord can’t walk?”</p>
