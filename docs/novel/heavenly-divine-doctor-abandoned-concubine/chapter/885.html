            <p><strong>Chapter 444 – The Most Suitable (2)</strong></p>
<p>Lu Shiming was still a little unhappy in his heart but was a little moved now. “I’ve seen that kid, Tang Zhen, is not bad despite being several years older than our Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>“Why did you bring that up? He’s only twenty-four. Besides, if it were not for the fact that he was fighting with the emperor on his campaigns, he would have already been married and had children by now,” Pei <em>Shi</em> said, looking at Tang Zhen just like how a mother-in-law would her future son-in-law, becoming more and more satisfied the longer she looked.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming’s mouth twitched in consternation as he glanced elsewhere. He just felt no one was worthy of his daughter. “You go find Mother tomorrow then. After all, Yaoyao still has the identity of a princess. So, if you really want to get her engaged, you certainly have to get Empress Dowager’s consent first.”</p>
<p>Pei <em>Shi</em> smiled and said, “Empress Dowager will certainly agree. After all, the more I think about it, the more I feel that Tang Zhen and Yaoyao are a match made in heaven.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming snorted. “Shouldn’t we ask for Yaoyao’s opinion first?”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao is a young girl from the boudoir. When the elders agree, I’ll then talk to Yaoyao,” Pei <em>Shi</em> said. She was certain her daughter would like Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>“Then, let’s go to bed early,” Lu Shiming said, hugging Pei <em>Shi’s</em> shoulder and drawing her closer as they went to bed.</p>
<p>Abashed, Pei <em>Shi</em> pinched him on the waist and said, “That one over there came here just now and seems to be ill.”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming’s expression was calm as he said, “What is she doing, coming over when she’s ill? Really, she is lacking in rules. Let someone move her out tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Are you really willing to part with your childhood sweetheart?” Pei <em>Shi </em>glanced at him questioningly even as she smiled at his declaration.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming lazily  hugged her waist as he said, “Where do you see I’m unwilling (to part)?”</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>The next day, Pei <em>Shi’s </em>complexion was rosy when she went to visit Old Madam Lu to consult her over Yaoyao’s marriage.</p>
<p>“Marquis Jing Ning?” Old Madam Lu smiled. “Did Tang Zhen take the initiative to marry Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“He spoke to Lingzhi. Last night, Lingzhi mentioned it to his Third Uncle. Still, Xiang Gong (Master/Husband) wanted Mother to have a look first before deciding,” Pei <em>Shi</em> said, smilingly, “Mother, what do you think of Tang Zhen?”</p>
<p>[*Xiang Gong = Lu Shiming]</p>
<p>“Marquis Jing Ning is naturally good.” From her words, it was obvious that Old Madam Lu liked Tang Zhen very much. “Although Tang Family is a small family, if Yaoyao marries in, she can be the master of the household. There are advantages and disadvantages to this. What do you think?”</p>
<p>Pei <em>Shi</em> said, “Mother, Yaoyao has been with me since a baby. Except for learning some medical skills, she was used to being unruly since she was a child, so I am not comfortable with letting her marry into a big family with many rules.”</p>
<p>“That is my idea as well. Only… Yaoyao now also holds the title of a princess… Therefore, even if we hope she marries Tang Zhen, we still must not let him call her ‘Princess’ anymore,” Old Madam Lu said.</p>
<p>“Mother, this is for the best.” Otherwise, if Yaoyao still acted like a princess in front of Tang Zhen, could they still become a pair of husband and wife who are in conjugal love with each other?</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu smiled and nodded. “It’s not been peaceful in the palace these last two days. I’ll wait for a few days before I visit personally and ask Empress Dowager to bestow marriage edict.”</p>
<p>Pei <em>Shi</em> hurriedly said, “Mother, do you want to ask Yaoyao’s opinion first?”</p>
<p>“That’s only natural. Yaoyao will come back tomorrow, so you ask then.” The matriarch smiled.</p>
<p>“Aish.” Pei <em>Shi</em> nodded briskly before the pair of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law began to whisper about Tang Zhen again.</p>
<p>Outside, Lu Jing bit her lower lip tightly, a touch of unwillingness in the corner of her eyes for those who cared to look. And when she heard the laughter inside, she turned her head and ran away.</p>
<p><em>Why do all benefits go to Lu Yaoyao? It’s obvious that I am the one who liked Tang Zhen first, so why?! Why can Lu Yaoyao marry him? Where on earth am I inferior to Lu Yaoyao?!</em></p>
<p>“Fourth Sister?! What’s the matter with you?” Lu Fang, who was about to come to the room, hurried forward to ask when she saw a sobbing Lu Jing running away.</p>
<p>WIping the tears away, Lu Jing replied, “I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Is there something that can’t be said between us sisters? Now, in this family, if we don’t support each other, who else can help us? So, tell your sister what’s going on?” Lu Fang asked as she took Lu Jing to sit down beside her.</p>
<p>“Third Aunt is going to ask Empress Dowager to bestow a marriage to Lu Yaoyao when Grandmother goes to her,” Lu Jinger said while gnashing her teeth in hatred and envy.</p>
<p>Lu Fang was stupefied and subconsciously asked, “Bestow marriage? Who?”</p>
<p>“Marquis Jing Ning,” Lu Jing said as her voice choked up again.</p>
<p>A flash of jealousy crossed Lu Fang’s eyes before she hid it and sighed. “Old Madam is really partial to Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>“I’m not reconciled to it!” Lu Jing’s voice was thick with hatred.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, Second Uncle and Second Aunt are not here. Otherwise, you could go ask the Eldest Madam,” Lu Fang said, advising her in a low voice. “There must always be an elder to make decisions for you.” She then added: “How can I not help you? Anyhow, you always have to try.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to find Eldest Aunt now.” Lu Jing decided as she stood up. “Second Eldest Sister, you go with me.”</p>
<p>“OK,” Lu Fanger said, nodding her head and the two sisters went to Liu <em>Shi</em>’s courtyard.</p>
