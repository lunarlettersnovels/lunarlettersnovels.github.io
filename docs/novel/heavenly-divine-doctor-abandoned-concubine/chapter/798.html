            <p><strong>Chapter 533 – Remember Your Blood Feud</strong></p>
<p>Ye Chunming had known Zhao Mingxiao for many years now. At first, it was Ye Yisong who had dealings with Zhao Jia Island, later as Ye Yisong became more and more powerful and had more and more things to do, he gradually handed over the affairs of this isle to his own son. In addition to mining iron ore and forging weapons, Zhao Jia Island also bought a large amount of medicinal materials and food from the Jin Kingdom. These were all necessary things after they declared themselves a country.</p>
<p>Because of this relationship, Zhao Mingxiao rescued Ye Chunming, brought him to Zhao Jia Island, and entrusted him with important responsibilities in order to turn Zhao Jia Island into Zhao Country as soon as possible. Everything was already in place, but nobody expected Zhao Tianji would return early. His return led to the early disclosure of this matter.</p>
<p>Now the two brothers, Zhao Mingxiao and Zhao Tianji had almost turned against each other. If Zhao Tianji weren’t disabled, it wouldn’t have been so easy to suppress him.</p>
<p>As Ye Zhen listened to Ye Chunming continue on in a self-righteous tone, the corners of her lips lifted into a faint smile. “You think Zhao Tianji is a good-for-nothing?”</p>
<p>“He may not have been a good-for-nothing before, but isn’t a person who can’t walk useless?” Ye Chunming asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>“Even if you can’t walk, you’re not necessarily a good-for-nothing.” Ye Zhen laughed lightly, “You have so much confidence in Zhao Mingxiao that you think he can really claim the title of emperor? I remember that Zhao Jia Island is supposed to be the land of the Jin Kingdom. If you do this, you are rebelling.”</p>
<p>Ye Chunming sneered, “Even if it is a rebellion, so what? Mo Rongzhan is good at warfare, but can he still dominate the sea? The Zhao Jia Island has been saving up its strength for so many years, patiently waiting for this day.”</p>
<p>“And how can you be sure that everyone on the Zhao Jia Island will follow your orders? After all, the real master of the island is Zhao Tianji,” Ye Zhen said., “You basically want to use Zhao Mingxiao to avenge yourself, you want to use Zhao Jia Island to avenge the Ye family ……”</p>
<p>“So what if I am?” Ye Chunming revealed a cold smile. “The day isn’t far when Zhao will definitely annex the Jin Kingdom, just you wait!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt that this eldest brother in front of her was really crazy… Not to mention whether Zhao Jia Island could proclaim itself a country if it really went to war with the Jin Kingdom, she felt that Huangfu Chen would certainly not sit idly by. And when that happened, the power of the Huangfu Dynasty hidden in the world would definitely return to the world. How could Zhao Jia Island deal with Mo Rongzhan and Huangfu Chen?</p>
<p>Moreover, Ye Chunming was too full of himself. He thought he could use Zhao Mingxiao like Ye Yisong used to control the previous emperor back then. However, given the present situation, she didn’t know who was using whom yet. Zhao Mingxiao wasn’t like the previous emperor who could be fooled at will.</p>
<p>“You underestimate Mo Rongzhan too much,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice, seeing that Ye Chunming was her eldest brother, she couldn’t help reminding him. “Mo Rongzhan is not that easy to deal with, as for eldest brother… Lu Lingzhi was poisoned and has yet to find a cure; even if you don’t seek revenge on him, he is destined to spend the rest of his life suffering. ”</p>
<p><em>Even though such is the case, I will not let him off.</em> She had always felt that letting him die would be too cheap a bargain for him.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming coldly snorted, “A cheap bastard, what’s there to worry about?”</p>
<p>It seemed that her eldest brother(YC) had not really changed much. Back then, had he and his cronies not tricked Mo Rongzhan into falling into the dry well, she would not have saved him… let alone married him later because of that.</p>
<p>“Since you say so, I have nothing more to say,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>Ye Chunming lowered his eyes and looked at her. “You are my little sister, there is only you in the Ye family besides me. I will not watch you go to your death, you should not go back.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Ye Zhen was taken aback. <em>Could it be that Zhao Mingxiao wouldn’t even spare his own brother anymore?</em></p>
<p>“How did you become a princess?” Ye Chunming didn’t answer, instead frowned and asked a question of his own.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shrugged. “Probably because the empress dowager took a liking to me, but what you just said… it’s just too incredible… How could I be the daughter of the Ye family? If I am Ye Zhen’s sister, why did the Ye family not want me in the first place?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. With regards to you, I only happened to hear my father mention it. As for why you were sent away… I don’t know,” Ye Chunming said.</p>
<p>“Then why are you Ye Shi? I heard that… Ye Yisong’s name is Ye Shi, aren’t you afraid your identity will be suspected?” Ye Zhen asked. She held her own suspicions. When she first heard the name Ye Shi, she thought her eldest uncle hadn’t died but never had she imagined it would actually be Ye Chunming.</p>
<p>A glint of pain flitted past Ye Chunming’s eyes. “Those elders know that there was once a warlord named Ye Shi who helped Zhao Mingxiao. I naturally did it to gain their trust, besides, who would think that this Ye Shi would have something to do with the Ye family?”</p>
<p>The most dangerous names are the safest. Ye Zhen nodded gently, “Did you seek me out today just to say these words?”</p>
<p>“No, I have more important things to tell you.” Ye Chunming stared into Ye Zhen’s eyes and solemnly said, “You must remember your true identity. If I cannot kill Mo Rongzhan and Lu Lingzhi, you must avenge all the wronged souls of the Ye family, especially that bastard Mo Rongzhan! He doesn’t deserve to be the emperor of the Jin Kingdom, Yaoyao, with your good looks, if you can support the imprisoned Mo Rongyuan to regain the throne in the future, you will be able to avenge the Ye family.”</p>
<p><em>Have me support that equally weak and unscrupulous abolished prince?</em> Ye Zhen shook her head and laughed in her heart. “I’m afraid I don’t have the kind of talent you think I have.”</p>
<p>“Then you have to remember that the Lu family is not your benefactor, but your enemy. You have to remember that you bear a blood feud. You have to remember how your father and brother died. If you don’t avenge them, can you be at peace? You do not have to accept the truth about your origin, I won’t force you either. You can just go back and ask Lu Shiming if you are his biological daughter or not!” Ye Chunming said fiercely.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was silent, no one knew of her lineage better than her. However, for the Lu family… The one she hated was not actually the Lu family but Lu Lingzhi and Lu Wushuang. Not everyone in the Lu family was bad… Lu Shiming and Pei Shi… Lu Xiangzhi, and Old Madam Lu… they were all kind to her.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Lu Shiming and Pei Shi’s love and affection, her younger sister would not have been able to live freely for so many years.</p>
<p>“I’ll take my leave,” Ye Zhen said in a small voice.</p>
<p>“You can’t leave…,” Ye Chunming was about to stop her when he suddenly saw a red light on the island tower not far away. His face changed “Why is the Island Tower lit up?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen saw the highest spire on Zhao Jia Island had lit up with a red fire light, followed by what seemed to be ear-splitting cheers; she was overjoyed. It seemed that Zhao Tianji had succeeded, and now the entire Zhao Jia Island would know that their Island Lord had returned.</p>
<p>“What’s going on here?” Ye Chunming’s voice was tinged with anger, he grabbed Ye Zhen’s hand and said, “Come with me!”</p>
