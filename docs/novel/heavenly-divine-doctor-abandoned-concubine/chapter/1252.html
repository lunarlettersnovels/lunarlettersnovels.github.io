<p><i>How can a person who claims to not know how to play the guqin, respond to its tune so… perfectly?</i></p>
<p>Not to mention her outstanding technique of playing the drums with her feet, it was naturally in sync with the guqin.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart skipped a beat, her muscles tensing under the scrutiny of the teacher, sweat started to break out from her temples.</p>
<p>After a pregnant pause, she squeezed out a made-up explanation.</p>
<p>She smiled as she spoke. “Back in the border town, there was a dance troupe near my home. At that time, I would go and see them practice almost every day. From there, I learned how to dance!”</p>
<p>Teacher Shan raised her eyebrows lightly, not believing Ye Zhen’s words, implausibly fabricated at a moment of panic.</p>
<p>However, she was impressed by her choice of words. She couldn’t think of a more suitable excuse other than what she gave.</p>
<p>When she saw the young miss dancing today, she suddenly felt that her student had many secrets and perhaps hidden talents that others still did not know.</p>
<p><i>But why should she do this? The miss was indeed a puzzle she has yet to solve.</i></p>
<p>“Who was that man just now?” Teacher Shan asked in a low voice. She had recently returned to the capital and wasn’t yet informed that Tang Zhen was now the marquis.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen answered flatly, totally uninterested. “Do you mean Marquis Tang? He is an orphan. I heard that he followed the emperor from an early age. By the time the new emperor ascended the throne, he was given the position of a marquis. “</p>
<p>Although having no support from a large family, such people like the marquis who took roles in the war, were more likely to gain the trust of the emperor, guaranteeing three generations of wealth and splendor in his family!</p>
<p>In fact, the ladies who wanted to marry him in the capital formed a long queue.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan sat straighter; her eyes fell on Ye Zhen somberly.</p>
<p>“I think he’s too concerned about you. If you know how to love yourself, listen to my advice. Listen to me as your teacher. In this world, most men have few words to be believed in. Men are deemed the coldest since ancient times.” She spoke the words grimly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that Teacher Shan was worried that she would be played and afterwards, neglected like used goods. She had a promising future; it would be disheartening to see it recklessly thrown away!</p>
<p>“Teacher, you can rest assured that this student naturally knows the depth of her actions.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “Always remember what I said.”</p>
<p>Afterwards, Teacher Shan fell silent. Seeing that Ye Zhen understood what she said, she stopped talking.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming and his wife came back, and the lamb had been finally roasted, infiltrating the air with an appetizing smell.</p>
<p>The herbal juice Ye Zhen applied to her face herself had now disappeared, removed by sweat. Henceforth, in the light of the bonfire, her jade skin was revealed, making her an image of tantalizing beauty.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao.” Lu Shiming seemed to have just noticed how drastic his daughter’s change was.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Ye Zhen was slicing mutton when she heard Lu Shiming calling her. She smiled and raised her head.</p>
<p>His daughter had become very beautiful. In his previous impression, Yaoyao was like his little wild boy. Really, it was like he was raising two sons in the border town!</p>
<p><i>When did my daughter become like this?</i></p>
<p>“Nothing, eat more.” Lu Shiming was pleasantly surprised but felt more worried.</p>
<p>If she looked this pretty, she would attract attention as long as she’s seen in the public. A deep stab in the gut put him on the edge… what if <i>her biological parents see her? Would they recognize her?</i></p>
<p>Lu Shiming had an impulse to hide his daughter in the boudoir and not let her go out! But after all, he couldn’t possibly do it. He would be the last one who could stand to lock her up.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t know what Lu Shiming was thinking. She politely got Pei Shi’s approval and drank several cups of fruit wine with Teacher Shan. She just drank a little too much and got a little bit drunk.</p>
<p>Pei Shi asked the maid to take her back inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>When Lu Xiangzhi and Tang Zhen returned to the hunting grounds, everyone was already drinking and stuffing their mouths with meat, two guards were wrestling in the middle.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan sat on one side, drinking while looking at the court guards clashing in force, and rolling to the ground in the heat of the match. When he heard of the two men’s return, he just glanced lightly at their figures.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi and Tang Zhen saluted Mo Rongzhan before returning to their respective positions.</p>
<p>“Why did you come back just now?” Lu Lingzhi frowned.</p>
<p>“My family is also having roasted meat. When we went back, we saw Third Sister dancing. Eldest Brother, you don’t know, Yaoyao dances really well!” Lu Xiangzhi said in an ostentatious manner that his younger sister had become so beautifully talented and that he was very proud of it.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi frowned. “Dancing?”</p>
<p>He imagined Yaoyao dancing, and his chest felt stuffy and sour. His sharp gaze immediately turned to Tang Zhen who was casually sitting by the door, a playful smirk on his face while his eyes stared at blank space and not to the wrestling duo. It seemed like he was fantasizing about someone.</p>
<p>And Lu Lingzhi knew who it was!</p>
<p>“Yes, Teacher Shan played the guqin while Yaoyao danced with drums! Eldest Brother should have seen her, just like a fairy! She was so good; Brother Tang was even stunned!” Lu Xiangzhi laughed.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi snorted coldly.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen, who overheard the conversation, was now glaring daggers at talkative Lu Xiangzhi. Then, to dissipate the pressure, he flashed a sheepish, innocent smile towards Lu Lingzhi.</p>
