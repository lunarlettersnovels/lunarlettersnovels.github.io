            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 192 – The Most Precious Thing</strong></p>
<p>The room was shrouded in a deathly stillness, but for the young prince’s cries of pain. The onlookers were in varied moods. The master of the palace looked on skeptically, the imperial physician in perplexion while the attendants and eunuchs in sheer stupefaction.</p>
<p>Whatever the thoughts, whatever the person, no one dared to interrupt Ye Zhen nor breathe, lest the sound disturbs her.</p>
<p>Thus, when the empress dowager eventually composed herself and reached the little prince’s chambers, she was greeted by the sight of the little girl pressing on her son’s body using a strange technique. She did not quite understand what she was doing but did have some inhibitions. So, she turned to Qi Jin for answers. Upon seeing the expert was not only allowing it but was actually acting as a bystander, she said nothing but looked on in surprise.</p>
<p>This was exactly why everyone else was at a standstill–the master herself did not interrupt her pupil, naturally, they would not stop her from administering the acupressure to the young royal either. They watched silently as the little girl used her delicate hands and put pressure on certain points. Every time she pressed, her fair hands turned whiter… like they had lost blood. But her face showed neither fatigue nor pain.</p>
<p>Though the faintest glimmer of hope took birth in their hearts, their rationality still got the better of them: it asked but one question–<i>Can it really relieve pain?</i></p>
<p>Their answer was Mo Rongyi’s gradually waning cries and steady breathing. And when the innocent face seemed to have calmed, that glimmer of hope seemed to have been justified.</p>
<p>Seeing that her little one was soothed, the empress dowager let out a sigh of relief. She did not dare to think how long this would last for; to her even if this were but momentary it was immensely gratifying. However, the mother’s heart did long for more.</p>
<p>Her gaze moved to the pale dainty profile that was glistening with perspiration. She could see the sheer confidence and determination in those delicate features. There was modesty and concern too. This girl… she had simply given in to her on a whim, she had no expectations least of all hope. But who knew, letting Ye Zhen stay in the palace proved to be the best decision.</p>
<p>She took a glance at her older son beside her. When the other looked towards her, she gently nodded. Then, Mo Rongzhan looked at the girl. His gaze was profound, but none could discern what lay within. The turn of events unsettled him.</p>
<p>He had happened to be around when his little brother begged their mother for Ye Zhen. At first, he was determined not to allow it, but in the end, he had softened for the sake of his ailing brother and sent for her. However, he did not ask Aunt Cheng to look for Ye Zhen, instead, let Eunuch Fu go.</p>
<p>Ever since he had seen her, he felt something strange in his heart. He did not understand the feelings she evoked in him nor did he like the fact that he had absolutely no control over it. To him, she was a mystery that was refusing to unravel itself. She was unfathomable and unrestrained.</p>
<p>It would have been fine had it been limited to him, but here even the little prince could not escape her charms. Was she deliberately getting closer to his brother? What was even more frustrating was the fact that he could not understand her. And what he did not understand, he would nip it in the bud. In this case, by keeping her far away from his brother and the palace.</p>
<p><i>Lu Yaoyao… What kind of person are you?</i></p>
<p>“How are you feeling, Your Highness?” Ye Zhen’s hands were still pressed in his body. Even if she had used up all her strength, she still pressed on hoping he would feel better.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi could only manage a limp nod and spoke in between laboured breaths. “It does… not hurt. You do… not have… to press.”</p>
<p>Only then did Ye Zhen stop and heave a sigh of relief. “I did not think it would be really useful,” was her modest confession.</p>
<p>By now, Qi Jin had recovered from the shock. Time and again, this girl had surprised…no, shocked her. She had always performed the impossible and with such simplicity. Be it that timely help to her grandson, her performance in Qi Fuzi’s test, the prognosis of the little prince and now, this acupressure… she had exceeded all expectations. She felt a hint of pride blooming within her.</p>
<p>As a person of medicine, and an expert at that, Qi Jin was always hungry for knowledge. And the source of knowledge never mattered to her. It was perhaps because of this quality that she was where she was today. Left to her, she wanted to quell her curiosity right here, right now.   But one look at Ye Zhen and she realized that some words did not suit this place.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, she reined in her eager heart and calmly took the little prince’s pulse. She found that it was stabler than before.</p>
<p>Knowing what was to come next, the clever Mo Rongyi said weakly, “I do not want to eat anything. No matter what I eat, I feel sick all over.”</p>
<p>“How can one not eat?” Mo Rongzhan said with a heavy voice and cast a stern gaze at his little brother.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi cried, “I would rather starve than die of pain.”</p>
<p>Upon these words, the empress dowager’s eyes immediately turned red. “What do you want Aijia to do?”</p>
<p>“Mother, I’m in pain.” Mo Rongyi complained.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked coldly at Qi Jin. “Imperial Physician Qi, when will Little Prince be cured?”</p>
<p>“Replying to the emperor, this humble servant can hardly say, ” Qi Jin said helplessly. “If only the little prince had not been poisoned before, his illness would not have lasted for this long.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, it felt like the room was thrown into frigid temperatures. Mo Rongzhan’s dark, piercing gaze was shooting icicles. “Why is it hard to say?”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, shall I cook porridge for you?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ye Zhen’s voice was heard. She seemed to be oblivious to the tense conversation between Mo Rongzhan and Qi Jin, treating them like thin air. Right now her focus was on feeding the<i> lingquan</i> to the little prince. If she were to delay, she was afraid he may not last long.</p>
