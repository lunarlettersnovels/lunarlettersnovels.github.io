<p>Hong Ling looked at the woman who looked exactly like the miss in the family.</p>
<p><i>She is clearly the fifth miss!</i> <i>How could she not recognize her?</i></p>
<p>“Young Miss, you don’t remember this handmaiden? This is Hong Ling!” Hong Ling grabbed Ye Zhen’s clothes and said, “You’re alive, Miss! This is a miracle!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took a deep breath, looked back at the servant at a distance, and asked in a low voice, “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe Hong Ling. The maid who forced her to drink the poisonous wine had served her since childhood. <i>What about this woman in front of her?</i></p>
<p>She perfectly recalled the scene from that day.</p>
<p>At that time, Hong Ling was not by her side. Even when the fire engulfed her palace, she had not even seen her shadow.</p>
<p><i>Where did she go?</i></p>
<p>Hong Ling cried and said, “On that day, Hong Yan locked this handmaiden inside a room. When this handmaiden woke up, the whole palace was on fire! Xiao Qi saved me… But Miss, you… you are all right. This handmaiden heard that you were caught in the fire!”</p>
<p>“The Wang Fei of the Qin Dynasty is dead,” Ye Zhen said flatly but felt shocked that Xiao Qi had saved Hong Ling.</p>
<p>Xiao Qi was a white wolf that she raised. It was sent to her when it was still a pup, and she had brought it up with her own hands. She used to take it only as a pet, but she didn’t expect it to save Hong Ling.</p>
<p>Hong Ling could not understand Ye Zhen’s words. “Miss, you …”</p>
<p>“This is not the place to talk. Where do you live?” Ye Zhen asked softly, she didn’t expect the former maid to be still alive, which was a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Her former maid, whom she had personally trained, including the traitor Hong Yan, had been killed by Lu Lingzhi. Hong Ling was the confidant she valued the most and would not betray her at all.</p>
<p>Hong Ling could become Ye Zhen’s confidant again. It also helped that she was a wise and transparent person. After taking a look at Ye Zhen, she knew that the girl in her family must have a different life than she imagined. “Miss, this handmaiden lives in Qingyu Lane.”</p>
<p><i>Qingyu Lane</i>!</p>
<p>Corners of Ye Zhen’s mouth slightly lifted into a little smile. “All right, you must go! I’ll have time to find you.”</p>
<p>Hong Ling watched Ye Zhen turn around and leave, her face startled.</p>
<p><i>The fifth miss acted very differently from before! Is she really the fifth miss, Ye Zhen? If not, how can she look so similar?</i></p>
<p>After Xiao Qi rescued her, she had quietly gone to Wang Fei’s palace premises the next day. There were no survivors left. They all said that Wang Fei had died in the fire. She cried for some time and felt worthless of her miss.</p>
<p>Hong Ling watched Ye Zhen get into the carriage and leave, her doubts deepened.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not look back at Hong Ling. When the servant boy asked her, she just said that the other party was asking for directions, then she quickly got on the carriage. Her white and slender fingers covered her eyes, forcing the sourness in her heart to show a faint smile.</p>
<p>She was snubbed by Mo Rongzhan and abandoned in her palace for two years. To while away her time, she had started a small business. It was not convenient for her to show her face, but her servants could.</p>
<p>In those two years, she had opened a trade shop in Jinkou City and trained several people who worked for her outside. Those people were all her part of her dowry, and her father had personally picked them for her. After all that happened, she was not so sure now whether they were still loyal to her.</p>
<p>Qingyu Lane was the place where she used to meet with those people. She didn’t want others to know that she had shops in Jinkou City, so she had Hong Ling buy a house in Qingyu Lane to serve as a meeting place where she could meet her employees.</p>
<p>When goods were sent to the capital, they were first placed in that house. So, it served as a storage place as well.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was fortunate. Luckily, she hadn’t told Lu Lingzhi about it at that time; otherwise, those people would probably not have escaped death.</p>
<p>If all her former confidants could come back and remain loyal to her as before, they would be of great help to anything she would want to do in the future.</p>
<p>She had never been a conceited person, but revenge was not easy on her own. She needed people to help her.</p>
<p>Today she couldn’t talk more with Hong Ling. She was afraid that the servant boy, Quan Fu, would report to Lu Lingzhi upon their return. And she was even more afraid that Lu Lingzhi would find Hong Ling, and have her killed.</p>
