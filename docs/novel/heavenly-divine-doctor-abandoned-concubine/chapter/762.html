            <p><strong>Chapter 569 – Angry at Herself</strong></p>
<p>From the moment Lu Jing returned from the Wu Manor, she locked herself in her room. When she thought about how she could no longer marry the person she wanted to marry*, that her reputation was already ruined, she couldn’t help but hide under the covers and sob. No matter how her maid tried to placate her, she was still inconsolable. In the end, the helpless maid could do nothing but leave the girl alone to cry her heart out.</p>
<p><em>[*For those who don’t remember, the girl has a crush on Tang Zhen. Remember the silver whip incident in the beginning chapters?]</em></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu had also sent someone to check on her, however, even that person failed to appease her and returned to report to the matriarch.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu sighed and simply said, “Let her be.”</p>
<p>While the wise elder knew some things needed time and will to come to terms with, the green* girl wallowed mistaking it for callousness and apathy. Lu Jing, now at the height of her vulnerability, felt that there was no one in the world let alone her family who was concerned about her and that no one took her and her well-being seriously. Now, she was even more aggrieved.</p>
<p><em>[*as in young/inexperienced]</em></p>
<p>The next morning, Lu Fang came over, but Lu Jing still buried herself under the covers, refusing to see anyone.</p>
<p>“Fourth Sister, are you going to lock me out too?” Lu Fang ignored the servants’ obstruction, pushed the door open, and walked in. Then, she went to the side of the bed and sat down on a stool there. “Are you still angry at yourself? Why don’t you even want to see me?”</p>
<p>Lu Jing’s voice was slightly hoarse as she said, “Second Sister, you should go. I don’t want to see anyone now.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing this for? Do you think that you can gain the sympathy of others by acting pitifully? You’ve been in the Lu family for so long, can’t you tell what kind of people Grandmother and Eldest Brother are?” Lu Fang felt resentful towards her sister’s obstinate behaviour and continued scolding, “Who else apart from Eldest Sister and Yaoyao has the Old Madam actually given special treatment to? Besides, given your predicament now, even the servants would treat you differently. Don’t you understand?”</p>
<p>“Second Sister, what do you mean by this? Do you also think that my body has been tainted, that I’m not worthy of Grandmother and the family’s concern?” Lu Jing pulled her blanket off, revealing her haggard face. Her eyes were red and puffy from all the crying.</p>
<p>Lu Fang was shocked by her appearance. “How did you become like this?”</p>
<p>“Those people from the Wu family have tarnished my reputation, yet refused to marry me. What can I do now? I might as well just die,” Lu Jing said with a sob.</p>
<p>“Die?” Lu Fang sneered. “If that’s the case, I should have died a few times already. Back then, Yaoyao vehemently refused to marry Liang Chun, and in the end, even got the Eldest Madam to set me up. I must have been blinded back then! Look at the kind of life I’m leading now! Jing’er, you still have a chance, so how can you admit defeat so easily?”</p>
<p>Lu Jing stared at her sister stonily. “Tell me, what can I do then?”</p>
<p>“If Grandmother truly cares about you, she would definitely help you regain your reputation, and marry you off to someone better than Wu Congmin. If she’s only thinking about protecting the Lu family’s reputation or Yaoyao’s reputation, then she would probably send you to Jinkou City and ask Second Uncle and Second Aunt to decide on your marriage. Once you are there, what other choice can you have? Even so, from my observations, you might still stand a chance after going to Jinkou City,” Lu Fang said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go to Jinkou City!” Lu Jing screamed at the top of her voice. “I’ve spent so much effort back then to prevent myself from going to Jinkou City with my parents. I only managed to complete my education at the Academy for Women after so much difficulty. Do I have to bow down to fate this easily?”</p>
<p>Lu Fang tried to persuade her. “It might not be the end for you even if you go to Jinkou City. It’s not like everyone in Jinkou City is a merchant, am I right? But Jing’er, it’s impossible for you to marry Tang Zhen, so you should give up this idea.”</p>
<p>Now that her thoughts were exposed, tears gushed down from Lu Jiing’s eyes again. All she wanted was to marry Tang Zhen, but now, it was almost impossible.</p>
<p>“Tang Zhen came over to the Lu Mansion yesterday, but did he ask a single thing about you?” Lu Fang sighed and added, “Fourth Sister, can’t you just give up?”</p>
<p>Lu Jing’er bit her lip, then began wailing loudly.</p>
<p><em>Let her cry then! Once she is done crying, it is time to grow up.</em></p>
<p>Lu Fang stared coldly at Lu Jing, who was still crying her heart out. Why should she be the only person who hated the Lu family? Why should she be the only person who was suffering? She wanted Lu Jing to be like her, to hate the Lu family to the core, and to hate those people who were biased against them.</p>
<p>Who would actually believe this? Until now, she had not consummated her marriage with Liang Chun.</p>
<p>Her life had already been ruined by the Liang family, but the person who put her up to this miserable fate was Liu Shi, as well as the Lu family!</p>
<p><em>[Methinks: Wasn’t she the one to actively seek her marriage, even begging Liu Shi despite YZ’s warnings… well, what’s a story without a few demented characters, and here they are, peeps, in full glory!]</em></p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>“Yaoyao has gone to Chengde Mountain Villa to pay her respects to Imperial Mother?”</p>
<p>When Mo Rongzhan heard Eunuch Fu’s report, he looked up from his desk, his countenance cold.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the princess has already set off for Chengde Mountain Villa early this morning,” Eunuch Fu replied softly. He was exasperated by his master.</p>
<p><em>Your Majesty, it was you who issued a decree on the very day you returned from Zhao Jia Island and didn’t even look for the princess to explain to her even after a few days. Yet, you are now annoyed that the princess didn’t seek you out at the palace, and are seething all by yourself.</em> <em>I fail to fathom your thoughts…</em></p>
<p>A flame of frustration grew within Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p><em>This little lass! How dare she run off without a sound? Does she really not care that I am going to bestow a marriage for her?</em> <em>Even if… Even if she understands what I am trying to do, she should at least look for me and demand an explanation. And yet, she seems to be unconcerned with all of this. Not only did she run off freely to attend a banquet but also to Chengde Mountain Villa today.</em></p>
<p><em>Am I really that insignificant in her heart?</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, you’ve been back for so long, but you’ve not gone to pay your respects to Empress Dowager,” Eunuch Fu kindly reminded him.</p>
<p><em>Since you want to see the princess so badly, then you should take the initiative to look for her. Didn’t you use to trespass into her boudoir at night in the past? Why did you suddenly become a gentleman?</em></p>
<p><em>Your Majesty, you’re really not much of a gentleman anyway!</em></p>
<p>A trace of agreement could be seen on Mo Rongzhan’s aloof face. “You’re right. Zhen should go and pay respects to Imperial Mother.”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu lowered his head to hide the smile on his face. “Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Brother, I’m going to visit our mother.” Before Mo Rongzhan could even stand up, Mo Rongyi’s voice traveled in from the outside.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s face darkened, and in the next moment, he saw that his brother had already run in. “Imperial Brother, Imperial Mother sent someone to pass a message that I should go to Chengde Mountain Villa to accompany her.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t I know about this?” Mo Rongzhan demanded coldly.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m telling you now. Imperial Brother, I’ll be bringing my teacher to Chengde Mountain Villa too, and I will learn about science seriously,” Mo Rongyi replied.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan began, “I should also pay my respects to Imperial Mother—”</p>
<p>“Imperial Brother, I’ll go off to Chengde Mountain Villa first. You can come whenever you’re done with your work,” Mo Rongzhan said with a smile. He was certain his brother wouldn’t be able to leave the capital anytime soon. After all, there was still a whole bunch of work waiting for him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, before Mo Rongzhan could prepare to leave for Chengde Mountain Villa, Tang Zhen had come into the palace and requested an audience. The latter reported to him about Old Madam Lu’s plans to go to the Huguo Temple.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was overjoyed. “Have the abbot meet with them and act according to my instructions.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” Tang Zhen knew that the emperor would definitely be happy; it was as though someone had tucked a pillow under him when he was dozing off.</p>
<p>It was a critical time now, so Mo Rongzhan could not leave the capital…</p>
<p>“What about the two candidates I have chosen for the princess? Ask Lu Shiming to come into the palace. He’s her father, so he should take a look.” His voice carried a tinge of seething.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen lowered his head and smiled. “Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Let Prime Minister Xu pick Xu Ji up,” Mo Rongzhan added plainly. He still wanted to make use of Prime Minister Xu, so… He would put a halt to Xu Ji’s punishment for now.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Tang Zhen’s gaze darkened. Even though he had agreed to it now, he was clear that His Majesty would certainly not let Xu Ji go so easily in the future.</p>
