            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 288 – Justice Unserved (1)</strong></p>
<p>It would be wrong to say that the incident hadn’t shaken Ye Zhen. But what had actually sent her heart into a tumultuous whirlwind was killing a man in cold blood. In her last life and this, all she had used her bow and arrow for was hunting animals and nothing else. And though she had done it in the fit of self-defence, her heart was still unsettled.</p>
<p>The Anshen Sleeping tea Pei Shi prepared for her, had its desired effects. She had a dreamless night, slept like a baby. When she woke up, her spirit was much better, and the anxiety plaguing her from the kill had abated. When she was about to visit the old madam in the upper hall,  she knew that the old madam had entered the palace.</p>
<p>She chose to return to her room and read a book. Before she knew it, a while had passed, and Pei Shi sent her another round of Anshen Sleeping tea to calm her nerves.</p>
<p>“Mother, really, I’m fine. I don’t have to drink this anymore,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice. She felt now that her heart had settled, she didn’t need to drink this tea anymore.</p>
<p>But Pei Shi wouldn’t hear a word of it. She was just too worried. “Drink some more, dear.” She urged her.</p>
<p>Without a choice, Ye Zhen acquiesced. “Grandmother hasn’t come back yet?” she said, after downing the tea.</p>
<p>“Mother is still in the palace. Your brother has already apprehended the two bandits in the morning. The people in the palace took them away. They should be interrogating them by now.” Pei Shi was very angry and aggrieved over the turn of affairs. Left to her, she would confront the princess and her daughter herself. But still, she knew how to rein in her rage. “Empress Dowager is looking out for you. Let’s see how arrogant Princess Royal can be.” Her anger evident in her tone</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that her twin sister’s foster parents genuinely took her as their daughter. All of Pei Shi’s reactions were as a result of it and not a pretense. She felt, again, that her sister had lucked out, even if her biological parents sent her away, she had landed in very loving hands.</p>
<p>She smiled, Pei Shi was indeed a naïve person. “With the words of those two bandits, Liu Hua may not necessarily admit it.”</p>
<p>Princess Royal was not an easy person. She was of imperial blood, seasoned in the game of intrigue right at the heart of it all- the inner palace. It would be laughable if such an incident would be her undoing. Neither the empress dowager nor Mo Rongzhan would attack Princess Royal’s residence at this time. As such, she wasn’t expecting any major developments.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was no fool. She knew the inner workings of the imperial palace all too well. She was well-aware of the status quo Princess Royal held. Her reason in bringing this matter, and personally, before the empress dowager was to add fuel to the fire of hatred burning in the emperor’s heart. She wanted to use her fondness for Lu Yaoyao in sending a warning to the Princess Royal mansion, that they were not a family to be trifled with. While at it she also wanted to create an opportunity for Lu Wushuang to bridge the gap with Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>Although Old Madam Lu was not born from an aristocratic family, her wisdom and counsel could not lose to any old madam of any other family, be it a commoner or nobility. Ye Zhen had always felt that the old madam was instrumental in the success the Lu Family’ basked in today. Such contributions couldn’t go unnoticed.</p>
<p>“Regardless if she admits or not, we should bring their ill-deeds to the empress dowager and the emperor’s notice,” Pei Shi said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “Of course.”</p>
<p>After a while, Ye Zhen received word that the old matriarch had returned. She immediately went to the gates to meet her. Seeing that the old madam didn’t look well, she leaned over with some concern.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, are you all right?”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu smiled and shook her head. “I’m fine, just a little tired.”</p>
<p>In actuality, she was boiling with anger. Having reached this stage, Lu Wushuang was still thinking about having Yaoyao leave the capital. Instead of being grateful to her cousin for creating such a good chance to regain her favour, the ingrate was biting the hand that was helping her!</p>
<p><em>Ah, if only Shuanger doesn’t make mistakes in the palace, the emperor can’t spoil her as much as before.</em></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu categorically refused to see everyone but Ye Zhen. As they sat in the main hall, she looked at the kindly girl before her and sighed. She was saddened and helpless at how things stood.</p>
<p>“This matter,” she said looking at the limpid eyes before her, “may not be able to meet true justice, but at least it will curb Princess Royal’s arrogance somewhat. Yaoyao, we can’t just look at the present. Even if we do not get the justice we deserve today, we still have the future to look forward to.”</p>
<p>How could Ye Zhen not understand the dynamics of the world? If it were her last life, she would have been angry and upset, but that innocent girl had long ceased to exist. She was aware of the selfishness belying the selflessness of the society and especially the imperial family. She had experienced it all first hand.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said in a low voice, “Grandmother, I understand.”</p>
<p>Yes, she wouldn’t argue with the old matriarch, but that didn’t mean she would back down against Liu Hua!</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager has apprised the emperor of this matter, and His Imperial Majesty has asked the personnel in the Ministry of Justice to carry out the interrogation,” said Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p><em>Mo Rongzhan is having people interrogate? </em>Now, Ye Zhen felt that it was even more impossible to have a satisfactory result. However, in any case, she felt that she had avenged herself. Sooner or later, she would be able to sort things out with this Liu Hua character.</p>
<p>The Ye Zhen on today wasn’t the one to seek justice for herself from anyone but herself.</p>
