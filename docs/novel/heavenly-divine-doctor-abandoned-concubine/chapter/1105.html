            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 223 – Old Cucumber (2)</strong></p>
<p>A moment of silence drawled.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen also felt a tense feeling within her. She was very angry. The hatred she had for the man before her eyes was far different from Lu Lingzhi’s. What she felt towards Mo Rongzhan was resentment.</p>
<p>Blame him for betraying her heart, blame him for mistaking another for her, blame him for being cruel and ruthless that ultimately led to her poisoning. He who had shunned her, refused to even see a shadow of her was now taking the initiative to ask her to enter the palace- <em>ha ha, how ironic!</em></p>
<p>“Leave at once!” Mo Rongzhan said in a heavy voice.</p>
<p>He was aware his feelings towards her were different from others, but he did not choose a wife based on lust. Since becoming the emperor, he had more than his own preferences to be considered. Every move, whether inside the court or inner palace, had to be meticulously measured lest the consequences be unbearable. If anything, there was no place for any emotions least of all love.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen breathed a sigh of relief and turned to take her leave.</p>
<p>At her indifference, something in him pricked.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, there are many things in the world you cannot wish for,” Mo Rongzhan said,  looking at her back.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned her head, with a sneer on the corners of her lips said, “I believe I have a deeper understanding of this than the emperor.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan faintly squinted at her.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, is there any woman who loves you with all her heart and soul that is willing to fight against everyone for you?” Ye Zhen asked softly.</p>
<p>She did not know what came over her to be asking him that.</p>
<p>“No!” Mo Rongzhan replied decisively, looking into her eyes. “I have never met such a woman.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled even more coldly. “What about the late Wang Fei Ye?”</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao!” He bellowed with a cold voice, his frosty eyes pierced right into hers.</p>
<p>Anyone would have shrank, but she stood undeterred.</p>
<p>“Oh, it turns out that you are so disgusted with her that even the mere mention of her name makes you so agitated.” Ye Zhen smiled gently, feeling inexplicably cold in her heart.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was even colder. “Do not think I really dare not do anything to you.” He roared.</p>
<p>“Many thanks to His Majesty’s grace for not killing me. This official’s daughter will take her leave.” Ye Zhen bowed her head as she curtsied and walked towards the door.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Mo Rongzhan asked, “Lu Yaoyao, how do you know Ye Zhen?”</p>
<p>“Naturally, I’ve heard about her.” Ye Zhen replied without looking back.</p>
<p>“Do not mention her again,” Mo Rongzhan said curtly.</p>
<p>“Does mentioning Ye Zhen make the emperor feel guilty?”</p>
<p>She had turned and looked at him with a contemptuous smile.</p>
<p>“Why should I feel guilty? She’s from the Ye Family. They all deserved to die.” Mo Rongzhan coldly replied without any remorse.</p>
<p>“If everyone from the Ye Family deserved to die, what about the emperor? The former emperor also avenged and killed many people. As the son of the former emperor, should you not be considered guilty by association?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Ye Zhen thought of her father and brother. They had had to pay for the crimes for her uncle with their lives. Was it fair? Her hatred for Mo Rongzhan immediately poured out.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s face turned stone cold. He had never expected anyone to argue with him over  a unanimously accepted decision, and a girl at that.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to say?” He demanded.</p>
<p>“Not everyone in the Ye Family deserved to die.”</p>
<p>“Get out!”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan restrained his wrath in his heart. If the woman talked once more, he was afraid he might unleash terror.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not dawdle and went straight out of the imperial study without once turning back or slowing her pace. When she saw Aunt Cheng standing outside waiting for her, she smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“Aunt Cheng, thank you. You have waited for long.”</p>
<p>Noticing her scarlet eyes, and streaked cheeks, Aunt Cheng immediately understood she had just cried. She was a little surprised, but deftly masked it with her usual smile pretending to have not noticed. It was not her place to ask, besides, the girl would be embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu is very kind. This handmaiden shall take you out of the palace now.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Aunt Cheng.” She smiled.</p>
<p>By the time they settled into the carriage, Ye Zhen’s mood had gradually calmed down. She had weathered the storm quite well, but in the end slipped up. She regretted losing control and mentioning her former self.</p>
<p><em>Would he harbor suspicions?</em></p>
<p>But even if she regretted it, she swore she would give him a harder slap if he said one more time that he’d take her as his concubine!</p>
<p>Ye Zhen firmly touched her mouth. <em>Argh! So filthy!</em></p>
<p>Right then, something dawned upon her… Ye Zhen was stunned.</p>
<p>When he’d kissed her and she refused his offer, she had already accepted death. Nevertheless, she was shocked that the tyrant Mo Rongzhan did not punish her. She had slapped him. Her entire performance had just one word in the moral code of conduct– treachery. She had not stopped at that and even mentioned his most taboo name.</p>
<p>And yet, he let her leave. It was hard to believe that she had returned from the clutches of death unscathed.</p>
<p>There was one thing that Ye Zhen failed to understand: <em>When did Mo Rongzhan become interested in her? When she had entered the palace, did he not look at her with a face full of disgust?</em></p>
<p><em>Indeed, a mystery!</em></p>
<p>While she was immersed in her musings, Aunt Cheng stole a glance at Ye Zhen and without a word lowered her eyes.</p>
