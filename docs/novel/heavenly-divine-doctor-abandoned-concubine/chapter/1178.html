            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 149 – The Chants Of The Dowager (2</strong>)</p>
<p>While Lu Wushuang’s palace was extravagant, the empress dowager’s looked humble which reflected herself.</p>
<p>Entering the main hall, the empress dowager could be seen sitting peacefully on a seat with an unwavering, kind smile etched on her face.</p>
<p>She was regal and kind.</p>
<p>When she was still the wang fei, Ye Zhen didn’t have many chances to interact with her. In fact, she was seldom seen on the imperial palace grounds.</p>
<p>The first emperor was always in search of younger women, leaving the empress dowager completely alone in her palace. She lost the favor of the former reigning emperor when she gave birth to the little prince, Mo Rongyi.</p>
<p>Hence, she lived in her palace in seclusion, rarely visiting the imperial palace to see her husband who was also uninterested in seeing her.</p>
<p>In truth, Ye Zhen had met the empress dowager only two or three times on some occasions, and they only looked at each other from a distance.</p>
<p>The only time she sat down with her to talk was when she had just married her son, Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen quietly looked at her former mother-in-law who was talking to Old Madam Lu. She was still young, in her late forties. Her skin was white and ruddy, facial features were very delicate. The handsome appearances of Mo Rongzhan and Mo Rongyi were clearly inherited from her.</p>
<p>Looking at such a gentle and compassionate Empress Dowager, Ye Zhen felt soft in her heart.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you come to this palace often and have occasional chats with Aijia<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1[mfn]āi jiā: I, me (self-referring by a widowed empress etc, used in historical novels and operas)][/mfn]</a></sup>? Ah! These palace walls are getting dull as time passes by,” Empress Dowager said to Old Madam Lu, her voice full of warmth.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu smiled and humbly answered. “I came to pay my respects to Empress Dowager. We’ve already troubled Aunt Cheng and this old madam does not wish to disturb Her Highness for the days to come.”</p>
<p>“You won’t be a nuisance as I almost have nothing to do! Really, you should visit me during your free time, Old Madam Lu.”</p>
<p>While Empress Dowager and Old Madam Lu exchanged words, Lu Wushuang stayed in silence. It bothered her that until this very moment, the empress dowager had ignored her presence.</p>
<p>Much more than she could admit, she had some contempt for Empress Dowager in her heart. Lu Wushuang always thought that the woman was too weak.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for her beauty, how could the first emperor have taken a liking to her? Now that her husband was dead, she only had her sons to rely on.</p>
<p>Really, she couldn’t blame others for saying that the widow had it easy. Through her son, the empress dowager remained in power without having difficulty.</p>
<p>“Is this the third miss in your family?” Empress Dowager’s eyes fell excitedly on Ye Zhen who was behind Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her head, smiled shyly at her and knelt. “This miss pays respects to Her Highness, the beautiful Empress Dowager.”</p>
<p>Her heart was without doubt enlivened, for a sweet smile started to form on Ye Zhen’s lips. Since her entrapment as a spirit in the palace, she had liked the empress dowager and was grateful to her.</p>
<p>The woman had no arrogance. She was not used to holding such a high position. When the first emperor was still alive, she was nothing. Even though she had two sons, First Emperor did not give her a title.</p>
<p>She had been living in peace for a long time and was suddenly appointed as the empress dowager with her son’s usurpation to the Dragon Throne.</p>
<p>Empress Dowager felt that the little girl was really beautiful. She had never seen such a beautiful girl in her palace for so long!</p>
<p>“Does your Lu Family specialize in beauties? Come closer so that Aijia can see you clearly.  This widow has never seen such a pretty girl!” As she spoke, her eyes flashed with surprise and she asked Ye Zhen to come to her.</p>
<p>The last time Ye Zhen saw the empress dowager was two years ago when she was only 13 years old. Hopefully, she had forgotten her former appearance now.</p>
<p>Even if her twin sister Lu Yaoyao, whose body she transmigrated into looked like her, there must be some differences. Not just that, she radiated a different aura now.</p>
<p>With a thumping heart, Ye Zhen slowly walked towards the empress dowager.</p>
