            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 142 – Entering The Palace (1)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen came down from the upper wing, and as soon as she stepped inside her chambers, Dai Mei hurried in, telling her that one of the Chen Sisters wanted to see her.</p>
<p>“Which Chen Sister?” Ye Zhen asked doubtfully at which Dai Mei quickly answered. “It’s the second miss of the Chen Family.”</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8"></div>
<p><i>Chen Liping?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen could already guess the other party’s intention.  She smiled sweetly. “Please invite her in.”</p>
<p>The Chen Sisters stayed with the Lu Family for a period of time and refused to go back to the residence arranged for them by their family. <i>What was the purpose behind this?</i> Ye Zhen couldn’t understand it.</p>
<p>Chen Qiuping was clearly interested in Lu Lingzhi and always inquired about him. However, Old Madam Lu seemed to not want her grandson to marry Chen Qiuping.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it could be that because Lu Lingzhi had become a high official, his wife-to-be should be of aristocratic blood to tighten his hold on his beloved position. What the Lu Family currently needed most was to create strong ties with aristocratic families, so as to improve their status in the capital. Unfortunately, Chen Qiuping was not one and so was her sister Chen Liping.</p>
<p>With bounce in her steps, Chen Liping came in with a brocade box in her hand and smiled gently towards Ye Zhen</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I’ve got two new pearl hairpins! Here, I brought you one!”</p>
<p>“Oh, but I already have many hairpins. You’d better keep them for yourself,” Ye Zhen said with a solemn smile.</p>
<p>Chen Liping was not generous at ordinary times. Today, she offered her an expensive hairpin, she must have something to ask from her.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you will enter the imperial palace tomorrow, you… Are you nervous? ” Chen Liping put the brocade box on the table and stared at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “I’m nervous. I’ve never been to the palace. How can I not be afraid?”</p>
<p>Chen Liping looked at her admiringly. “I wish I could see the wang fei and the palace she lives in. Ah! If only I could also go into the palace.”</p>
<p>“There may be a chance in the future.” Ye Zhen took a sip of tea, her pleasant smile unfaltering.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, can you… take me to the palace? ” Chen Liping looked at her imploringly.</p>
<p>She didn’t dare to ask this to the old madam and chose to test her luck with Lu Yaoyao. She always thought that Lu Yaoyao, among the members of the Lu Family, had a better chance to persuade the old madam into bringing her with them to the palace.</p>
<p>Even though she couldn’t compare with Yaoyao in terms of beauty, she was still a beauty. And as a young woman, she must fish opportunities for herself when her age was still ripe.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen chuckled in her heart. <i>Does Chen Liping see her as a child?</i> <i>Why would she take her to the palace? If this happens, Old Madam Lu would think that she is willful and stubborn for insisting to take Chen Liping with her.</i></p>
<p>She could also imagine that by the time she agreed, Chen Liping would definitely tell everyone that Ye Zhen was in dire need of a companion for she was too nervous and afraid.</p>
<p>“You have to go ask Grandmother about it.” Ye Zhen shook her head in a hurry and pretended to look scared.</p>
<p>With no signs of giving up, Chen Liping continued to try coaxing her and said, “As long as you ask the old madam, she will approve!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bit her lower lip and clasped her hands together. “That is not an easy thing to do. Grandmother might not agree to let me in the palace if I insist.”</p>
<p>“Just tell her that if I’m with you, you won’t be nervous!” said Chen Liping impatiently.</p>
<p>When Chen Liping saw that Ye Zhen was resolutely refusing to take her into the palace, she became angry. “If you don’t want to, then forget it! I just hope you will be humiliated tomorrow!”</p>
<p>With the sudden flare of anger, Ye Zhen looked at her timidly, with a pair of black eyes, shining like stars at midnight.</p>
<p>Seeing her delicate and beautiful appearance, Chen Liping was filled with jealousy again that she harshly grabbed the brocade box from the top of the table. “Since you despise my things, I’ll take them back!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say I despise…” She spoke but Chen Liping had already left in a huff.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her retreating back and couldn’t help laughing out loud.</p>
