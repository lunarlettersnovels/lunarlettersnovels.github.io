            <p><strong>Chapter 528 – Claiming Country And Throne</strong></p>
<p>Zhao Tianji finally saw the eight elders on Zhao Jia Island.</p>
<p>Apart from two familiar faces, the other six were completely unfamiliar. He had never seen them before. However, although he didn’t know them, they were more knowledgeable when it came to matters on the island than he was! From their words and actions, it seemed that they only heeded Zhao Mingxiao’s instructions and were rather distant from him(ZT).</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, when did the elders change? I actually had no idea at all.” Zhao Tianji looked at the other nonchalantly. He knew very well that the six unfamiliar elders should be Zhao Mingxiao’s people. His big brother had probably nurtured his trusted aides on the island a long time ago.</p>
<p>“The original elders are too old to do some things, so they have been allowed to retire on the island,” Zhao Mingxiao said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji smiled faintly. “What exactly can’t they do?”</p>
<p>“Ah Ji, I’ve already made it clear to you that our Zhao Jia Island can’t always remain the old Zhao Jia Island.” Zhao Mingxiao’s tone was already rather tough.</p>
<p>Elder Wei, who was sitting on an old-fashioned wooden armchair on his left, was the most prestigious old man. He looked at Zhao Tianji and said, “Island Lord, our Zhao Jia Island is no longer the same. You haven’t returned to Zhao Jia Island for many years, you are not aware of the changes on the island, and the grand master’s body is much better than before. He has been taking care of everything on the island all these years. Your legs are inconvenient, so why not—”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji looked at the elder he respected the most. “Why didn’t you lend a hand in the matters on Zhao Jia Island?”</p>
<p>“Island Lord, we only hope that you can recuperate properly.” The elders sitting on both sides whispered.</p>
<p>“Do you think Zhao Jia Island will succeed in becoming a nation?” Zhao Tianji asked indifferently. He raised his head and glanced at Liang Yin, who had an indignant expression on his face. He knew what Liang Yin was angry about. These elders no longer cared about him as the Island Lord. They probably thought that he would never stand up again.</p>
<p>Today, he had originally planned to let them know that he was now able to walk. But now, he felt it was better to watch, take stock of the whole situation and tread cautiously.</p>
<p>“Why can’t we succeed?” Zhao Mingxiao said coldly, “Everything is ready now, we only need to wait for the suitable opportunity—”</p>
<p>“Which suitable opportunity are you waiting for?” Zhao Tianji asked with a smile. “The opportunity to enthrone Eldest Brother the Emperor of the State of Zhao Jia? It seems that all of you have forgotten one thing—”</p>
<p>“What?” Zhao Mingxiao did not hide his ambition to become emperor. As early as when he started understanding things as a child, he knew too well what he wanted. And now that everything was ready, he did not think that there was anything missing.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji knew that Zhao Jia Island would definitely proclaim and be a founded state in the future, but it couldn’t do so at this time unless Huangfu Chen agreed. Or else, Zhao Jia Island would only be an island forever. “Eldest brother, have you forgotten the warning from our ancestral teachings? Unless the Huangfu family agrees, our Zhao Jia Island can’t be set up as a country.”</p>
<p>“Huangfu family?” Zhao Mingxiao sneered disdainfully. “Do you think that the world still belongs to the Huangfu family? In the past, they ruled the world, but now? The world has been divided into four parts, how could there be a shadow of the Huangfu family? What can they do anything to our Zhao Jia Island with just Huangfu Chen?” Zhao Mingxiao said with disgust. He didn’t take the Huangfu family seriously at all.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji shook his head with a smile. “It seems that Eldest Brother doesn’t know anything about the Huangfu family.”</p>
<p>“So what if the Huangfu Family doesn’t agree? Could it be that our Zhao Jia Island will live under their shadow forever?” Elder Duan snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“That’s right! We want to become a country!”</p>
<p>“Our Zhao Jia Island is now like a small country, what’s there to be afraid of?” The others echoed.</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Looking at their excitement, Zhao Tianji finally understood what he had missed all these years. No wonder his brother never asked him to come back to Zhao Jia Island. No wonder his brother kept mining private mines… It was all for his ambition.</p>
<p>He was really stupid. He thought that everything his big brother did was for him. So, in reality, he was just a pawn that was used.</p>
<p>“Island Lord, Huangfu Chen is the enemy of our Zhao Jia Island. We can not let him stay on the island. We hope that the Island Lord can send him away,” Elder Duan spoke again.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji swept a cold gaze across all the people and said, “I will definitely find the truth about the sneak attack back then. Do you think Huangfu Chen would have people sneak attack us? <em>Haha</em>, do you really think Huangfu Chen is a weak imperial grandson? Don’t forget, the Huangfu clan abdicated of their own volition. Do you really think that the family which once ruled this land would fall into destitution so quickly? Do you believe that if Huangfu Chen gives the order, our Zhao Jia Island would instantly return to our ostracized state a century ago?”</p>
<p>That’s right, they had all overlooked one thing. The Huangfu family wasn’t forced to abdicate. They had taken the initiative to abdicate!</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about Huangfu Chen’s sneak attack on our Zhao Island for now. Now that he lives on our island, we have to be on guard. We’re not afraid of anything,” Zhao Mingxiao said.</p>
<p>“What you said makes sense.” Elder Duan nodded.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji looked at the lot, it seemed that no matter what he said, it was useless. These people were now Zhao Mingxiao’s trusted aides. “Elder Duan, you can all go now.”</p>
<p>Initially, he had wanted to hear what the elders thought about Zhao Jia Island becoming a country. He believed that they would definitely object to it. Now, it seemed that he shouldn’t have asked anything. However, the ethical Eight Elders had already been sent away by Zhao Mingxiao. The ones that were now gathered in this small palace were all Zhao Mingxiao’s trusted aides. No, perhaps the entire Zhao Jia Island was under his control.</p>
<p>There were some things that Zhao Tianji did not want to think too much about, but even if he did not want to think much about them, he could not help but do so.</p>
<p>Elder Duan and the others looked at Zhao Mingxiao, and once they received his nod they bowed and left the hall.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao turned and looked at his younger brother and said, “Ah Ji, I’ll send you back now.”</p>
<p>“Big Brother, is the internal strength secret manual you gave me five years ago really an heirloom of the Zhao family?” Zhao Tianji asked casually.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Zhao Mingxiao raised his eyebrow and said.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji smiled. “Our Zhao family’s ancestors didn’t know martial arts at all, so it’s impossible for us to have any secret manual. Besides, half of that secret manual of internal strength is missing. After I cultivated, all my meridians were blocked, rendering my legs immobile. If I continued to cultivate, my entire body would be paralysed, right?”</p>
<p>“Are you doubting me?” Zhao Mingxiao narrowed his eyes and gazed down at Zhao Tianji.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t I suspect you, Eldest Brother?” Zhao Tianji asked in a low voice, “You want to chase Huangfu Chen away because you are worried that the attack on Zhao Jia Island would be traced to you. That letter… You wrote it, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao’s eyes turned frosty. “Do you know what you’re talking about?”</p>
<p>“I never believed that Huangfu Chen would let someone sneak attack Zhao Jia Island. If he wants to destroy our island, he doesn’t need to sneak attack it at all,” Zhao Tianji said softly.</p>
<p>Angry killing intent rose from the depths of Zhao Mingxiao’s eyes.</p>
