            <p><strong>Chapter 469 –  Empty Room (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Return to the palace!” Mo Rongzhan’s face was gloomy. He concluded that Ye Zhen might be at Old Madam Lu’s or Pei Shi’s courtyard tonight. She must be deliberately avoiding him.</p>
<p><em>Hmph, this little girl, would be punished the next time I see her.</em></p>
<p>At this moment, Ye Zhen, who had already left the capital, was sleeping soundly at an inn. Having left the city, she felt her entire body relax. She no longer had to worry about confronting Mo Rongzhan nor did she have to pay attention to any marriage. In any case, she only wanted to do what she liked to do.</p>
<p>Of course, what made her most happy was that her master had left the capital with her. As a result, Lu Lingzhi’s remnant poison, which could not be cured by anyone, would torment him for quite some time.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen slept beautifully and woke up in high spirits. She now looked like a thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy. Her skin was dark, facial features ordinary*. There was only a pair of bright eyes. Looking at the person in the mirror, she couldn’t help but sigh. Master’s disguise skills were indeed better than hers. When she met him yesterday, he gave her a new disguise that could last for several days.</p>
<p>She and her master had met with Imperial Physician Qi*. However, he did not recognize her(YZ). He only thought that she and Dai Mei were apprentices beside their master, so he tacitly agreed to follow them.</p>
<p>[*Qi Yizheng who went out of town to cure Lu Lingzhi.]</p>
<p>However, they only followed him for a day before they discontinued. Imperial Physician Qi and the others were walking too fast for them to follow. Huangfu Chen hoped that Ye Zhen could learn more on the road. Sometimes, she had to learn medical skills, so becoming a bell doctor* was also an option.</p>
<p>[*铃医- líng yī- is basically a wandering doctor that wanders around with a bell and a medicine box, ringing their bell to solicit patients, treating patients as they go.]</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had two reasons for going to Huaijiang. One was to avoid Mo Rongzhan, and the other to broaden her horizons. She had lived in the capital her entire life. When she died, she realized that all her life had been spent living for someone else.</p>
<p>Her father had once said that whether a person’s life was poor or rich, the most important thing is to live a splendid life.</p>
<p>“Master, is this our way to Huaijiang?” Ye Zhen asked curiously. <em>This didn’t seem like an official road to Huaijiang.</em></p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said with a smile, “If we walk the official road, I’ m afraid you will be brought back to the capital soon.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen immediately thought of Mo Rongzhan. If he discovered that she had left the capital, he might really have sent someone to bring her back.</p>
<p>“Master, where are we going now?” Ye Zhen’s eyes lit up. She felt that as long as the Master wanted to take her away, she would definitely not let anyone bring her back.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen saw her expression and said with a smile, “I have a… a  friend’s daughter is suffering from a strange illness. We happen to be passing by. If she has not been cured, we can go over and treat her.”</p>
<p>These words sounded strange. “Master, when did your friend’s daughter get sick?”</p>
<p>“A month ago.” Huangfu Chen rubbed his eyebrows and said, “I think so.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t know what to say. “Then why… Only now did you think of treating her?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen sighed helplessly. “Every day, I receive letters from people all over the world who know me. They all have patients at home, so how can I treat them one by one?”</p>
<p>Not to mention that he didn’t know all those people and did not have the energy to save the world. It wasn’t that he had not traveled all over the world to treat illnesses before, but he discovered that most of them were just to prove that they could invite people from the Huangfu family to tend to them. They weren’t really beyond cure, so he decided to hide his whereabouts and had received much fewer letters.</p>
<p>“Why would they write to you?” Ye Zhen asked out of curiosity. Who was Huangfu Chen? Even though she, who had been cooped up in the Duke of Qin’s residence for two years in the past without bothering about the world outside*, had heard of him, so how could people write to him this easily?</p>
<p>[*孤陋寡闻 gū lòu guǎ wén: ignorant and inexperienced; ill-informed and narrow-minded]</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said helplessly, “Grandaunt likes to help others. Before she went into seclusion, she asked people to look for me, so….”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes lit up. “Your grandaunt… Is it Princess Zhen Yue?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you to know my grandaunt.” Huangfu Chen smiled.</p>
<p>“Who doesn’t know the famous doctor, Princess Zhen Yue?” She was somewhat proud, as she was very familiar with the story between Qi Yanling and Princess Zhen Yue.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled faintly, “On the way, we would only treat those who really need to be healed, and those who are greedy for fame we would ignore.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t know how Huangfu Chen knew who really needed medical treatment and who didn’t. Anyway, she just needed to listen to him. “Okay, Master.”</p>
<p>“We will spend some time on the road, and we may arrive at Huaijiang later than my aunt.” Huang Fuchen saw that the glimmer in the eyes of his disciple was brighter than the smile in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Master, do you think there will be a disaster in Huaijiang this year?” Ye Zhen asked in a low voice, wondering if Bu Yan could be counted.</p>
<p>“Have you figured it out?” Huangfu Chen asked in a low voice.</p>
