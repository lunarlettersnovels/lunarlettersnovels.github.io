            <p><strong>Chapter 402 – Who Are You? (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Chief Gong, no matter what, you must give me an explanation for today’s matter.” Imperial Physician Huang looked at Gong Tang. She was definitely going to force Lu Yaoyao out of the Imperial Physicians Courtyard today.</p>
<p>“What are those people gathered around doing?” A youth’s voice sounded from behind the crowd. Mo Rongyi walked into the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard with a stern expression, and to Ye Zhen’s side.</p>
<p>Gao Xueping observed the age of the person entering and the clothes he wore, pretty much guessing his identity, and immediately went up to say, “Answering Your Highness, Lu Yaoyao picked the wrong medical formula on purpose, then destroyed the formula, almost dragging Imperial Physician Huang into disaster with her.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi glared at Gao Xueping, who was half-squatting before him and suddenly kicked her. “Who are you? Is the name of the princess something you can invoke?”</p>
<p>Gao Xueping was struck right in the chest. Although Mo Rongyi hadn’t struck with much force, it still left her in pain. She frustratedly looked at the little prince in indignation and did not understand why she had been kicked.</p>
<p>Imperial Physician Huang saw her student being beaten up, and immediately took a stand. “Little Prince, no matter the status, all who enter the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard are equal. That is the rule of this place! Those who make mistakes must be subjected to punishment, even if they are a princess.”</p>
<p>“Are you stupid? Even if the princess erred, it is not up to you to punish her. Who are you to do this?” Mo Rongyi shouted. “The princess coming to be a physician is the honor of the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard, not an opportunity for you to casually wrong and bully!”</p>
<p>Imperial Physician Huang said, unconvinced, “Little Prince, I have never wronged Lu Yaoyao. If she can prove her innocence, then please present the evidence.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen slightly smiled. “Evidence? We don’t need to do that much. I didn’t boil this bowl of medicine. Why would I need evidence?”</p>
<p>“How was this bowl of medicine not boiled by you? It clearly was!” Gao Xueping retorted.</p>
<p>“There is no licorice in this medicine. I added licorice as an aiding herb to the medicine today…,” Ye Zhen calmly replied.</p>
<p>Before Ye Zhen could finish, Imperial Physician Huang had already begun furiously shouting. “Who let you add licorice to the medicine? And you dare say that you did not change the formula?”</p>
<p>“Adding licorice was something Noble Lady Hu requested. The medicine was too bitter, and hard to swallow. I sought Chief Gong on the matter, and he agreed on adding a little licorice,” Ye Zhen said flatly.</p>
<p>Gong Tang nodded. “That is true.”</p>
<p>He took a look at Ye Zhen, lowered his head to test the medicine, and confirmed that there was no licorice in it.</p>
<p>“Chief Gong, it seems that someone is trying to harm the Princess.” Mo Rongyi coldly snorted, sternly looking at Gong Tang.</p>
<p>“Rest assured, Little Prince. I will take care of this situation,” Gong Tang immediately said. From the corner of his eye, he saw Imperial Physician Huang’s face go pale and sighed inwardly. It seemed that he could not allow this teacher-student pair to remain in the palace.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi wanted to continue backing Ye Zhen, but before he could begin, she poked his face, smiled, and looked at him. “Why are you here to see me?”</p>
<p>“Naturally I came to see if you were being bullied or not,” Mo Rongyi said with a snort.</p>
<p>“Who can bully me? Hurry back. Don’t stay here being a bother.” Ye Zhen rushed him away.</p>
<p>Gong Tang thought, in the entirety of the imperial palace, apart from the empress dowager and the emperor, this princess was probably the only one who would dare call the little prince a bother.</p>
<p>Gao Xueping’s face was white as a sheet. She didn’t understand why she would fail every time she tried to deal with Lu Yaoyao. Was that girl’s luck really that good?</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was rushed twice by Ye Zhen, and could only reluctantly leave the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard. Just as he was about to leave, he pointed at Gao Xueping and said, “Chief Gong, does a person like this deserve to stay in the palace?”</p>
<p>Gao Xueping looked at Gong Tang with even more dread. She didn’t want to be banished from the palace!</p>
<p>“Little Prince, I will definitely resolve this justly. I won’t allow any person to wrongfully convict any female physician,” Gong Tang said quietly.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi nodded with a smile, not forgetting to wink at Ye Zhen for credit.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head with amusement. Fortunately, there weren’t a lot of people in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard right now, otherwise, she didn’t know what the rumors about her would be like tomorrow.</p>
<p>Although she was really just a physician while in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard, she still had the status of Princess. She was just confused as to whence Imperial Physician Huang and Gao Xueping got their confidence to try working against her constantly.</p>
<p>Even if she allowed herself to be wronged, the empress dowager wouldn’t!</p>
<p>She could only say that this teacher-student pair really couldn’t read through the situation, viewing themselves in such high regards. As powerful as an imperial physician was, could one really dictate the life of a princess?</p>
