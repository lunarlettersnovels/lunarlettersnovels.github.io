            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 109 – The Big Revelation (1)</h3>
<p>Ye Zhen followed the doorman to a small lake in the backyard. Xu Lao was sitting on the bench inside the waterside pavilion. On the stone table was a white jade board. The black and white pieces on the table were a mess.</p>
<p>Eyes glued on the board before him, he seemed extremely dangerous and intimidating.</p>
<p>In addition to Xu Lao, there was no one else in the waterside pavilion. The guest he said just now was just an excuse.</p>
<p>Xu Lao looked up at the three of them, and finally, his eyes rested on Ye Zhen’s face. Almost instantly, his eyes flashed with surprise, wondering to himself if his memory was still serving him right.</p>
<p><i>This little girl… she looks so familiar. Have I seen her somewhere?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen bowed gracefully. “This little miss greets Lord Xu.”</p>
<p>Xu Lao recovered and looked sharply at Ye Zhen. “Whose daughter are you?”</p>
<p>“The father of the little girl is Ye …” Ye Zhen hesitated for a moment–she almost said that her father was Ye Yiqing.</p>
<p>“Who is Lu Lingzhi?” Suddenly Lord Xu interrupted Ye Zhen, his voice cooled down.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked back at Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>“Here is her cousin, Lord Xu.” Lu Lingzhi gave Xu Lao a bow.</p>
<p>Old Lord Xu waved his hand, closed his eyes, and said, “Lord Lu, I’ve been looking forward to meeting you for a long time.” His tone was full of mockery.</p>
<p>“What’s so important that my distinguished guests came to my doors?” He finished with an air of indifference.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi knew at once that the old man did not particularly like him. Still, he wore a gentle smile on his face. “I’ve heard a lot about Lord Xu, and today I specially brought my younger cousins to visit.”</p>
<p>He was yet to say a word about Lu Xiangzhi desiring to be Xu Lao’s student. If he did so, the old man would drive them out of his doors.</p>
<p>Old Lord Xu sneered. “My home is small. Lord Lu should invite me to his home the next time and avoid barging into my doors.”</p>
<p>With that, Lu Lingzhi had enough. He turned to walk away, urging his cousins to do the same. But he stopped in his tracks upon hearing Ye Zhen’s delicate voice.</p>
<p>“You can’t just drive us away. I’m here to break your board game.”</p>
<p>“Are you not his sister? Now that he’s leaving, why are you still here? The ruthless and unrighteous also deserve to play a board game with me now?” Xu Lao snorted with disgust.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed and said, “I haven’t finished yet. They will leave as you wish but I will play that board game with you. If I win, you will accept my brother as a student. How do you like it?”</p>
<p>Sitting upright on his seat, Xu Lao frowned at Ye Zhen’s brazen words. “Why do you think you can win against this old man?”</p>
<p>“Let’s try it then.” Ye Zhen smiled sweetly and naively. She could ask for Xu Lao for Lu Xiangzhi, but she would definitely not let Lu Lingzhi beat her into coercing the old man.</p>
<p>No, she wouldn’t let him use Xu Lao to gain more power.</p>
<p>“If you tell me what game I am playing, I will play against you.” Xu Lao inquired.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked down at the board on the table. “<i>Go.</i>“</p>
<p><i>Go</i> was deadly. Someone once vomited blood on this game because they could not break the situation. This game was set up by her father, but no one knew.</p>
<p>Xu Lao’s eyes lit up slightly, and he ordered the doorman on one side. “Please go ahead and have tea with two young lords of the Lu Family.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi took a look at Ye Zhen. Although there were many doubts in his heart, it was not appropriate to ask her to leave. Therefore, he gave Lu Xiangzhi a wink, and the two left the waterside pavilion together.</p>
<p>“Sit down, Miss.” Xu Lao ordered.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sat down opposite Xu Lao and looked up at the old man who had treated her like a granddaughter before. She blinked and gave a small smile.</p>
<p>Seeing her smile, Xu Lao finally remembered whom she looked like. “You look like the daughter of an old friend of mine!”</p>
