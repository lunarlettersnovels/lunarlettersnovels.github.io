            <p><strong>Chapter 453 – I Am Not Afraid (2)</strong></p>
<p>Lu Jing just pursed her lips and said nothing.</p>
<p>“It seems not. Fourth Sister, please go back.” Ye Zhen looked at her lightly. If it was something else, she could help Lu Jing, but she (LJ) questioned her with such a rightful stance, making her very unhappy. Although she would not marry Tang Zhen, it was not because of her (LJ) that she wouldn’t choose to do so.</p>
<p>Lu Jing stared at her(YZ) resentfully. “You’re treating your sister like this, you won’t have a good life in the future.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her silently, indifferent to her curses.</p>
<p>“You have nothing to say?” Lu Jing asked angrily.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I will have a good life in the future, but, Lu Jing, I can let you live a not good life now,” she said indifferently.</p>
<p>Lu Jing’s face turned pale. “Do you think the eldest brother and the old madam will let you hurt me?”</p>
<p>“Then you think… If they find out about what you said to me today, what will they do to you?” Ye Zhen looked at Lu Jing contemptuously. Ever since she came to the Lu Family, this Lu Jing had always looked at her unfavorably. In the past, she only felt that the other wasn’t worth it for her to make even a small fuss. She too was unwilling to argue with a little girl but did not think that her concessions would give an impression that she was cowardly.</p>
<p>“You…!” Lu Jing pointed at her angrily. “Are you threatening me?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen resisted the urge to roll her eyes. “Lu Jing, you are not worth it for me to do this. If this is what you wanted to say when you came to me, please go back. I will not promise you nor can I promise you.”</p>
<p>Lu Jing’s eyes flushed slightly. “Since I am inferior to you now, it does not mean that I will be inferior to you in the future too. Lu Yaoyao, I will definitely remember this humiliation today.”</p>
<p>♚♚♚</p>
<p>Ye Zhen watched the retreating Lu Jing as she ran away and shook her head. Lu Jing’s temper was really one that came from the Lu Family’s education. After all, she was not only a merchant-born but a concubine-born as well, so though on the surface she appeared to be the same as any other young ladies from the marquis mansion, in some ways, she still lacked a certain elegance that noble young ladies exuded.</p>
<p>Then, after she made herself presentable, she called Yu Ping and Dai Mei in for questioning. She wanted to know what had happened at home recently.</p>
<p>According to them, apart from the fact that the eldest madam was still crying in her yard, nothing else had happened. They had never even heard of news about her and Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>Thus, Ye Zhen decided to go to Pei <em>Shi</em> first.</p>
<p>“Mother, today I went to see Mister Chen and paid my respects to him as my master. In the future, he will teach me medical skills!” Ye Zhen did not ask about Tang Zhen when she saw Pei <em>Shi</em>. Instead, she first told her about today’s matter of her formally becoming an apprentice to a master.</p>
<p>A delighted Pei <em>Shi</em> said. “Did Mister Chen accept you as an apprentice?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that Pei <em>Shi</em> would like the news as she nodded. “En. I’ll go out to practice medicine with him in a few days, and when I come back, I will go to the palace and resign from my physician status. Mother, what do you say?”</p>
<p>“Of course it’s good.” She nodded at once. In fact, from the moment Yaoyao was titled Princess, she had long wanted to stop her daughter from going to the palace and work as a physician. But now that Huangfu Chen was her master, her identity had become even more extraordinary, so whether she could become a physician in the future or not didn’t matter.</p>
<p>“Today, Master said he was studying how to detoxify Eldest Brother. Mother, how is Eldest Brother’s health?” she asked, pretending to be worried.</p>
<p>Pei <em>Shi</em> sighed. “In the past, <em>Qijie</em> Grass could inhibit the toxin in his body, but none of us expected that the <em>Qitiantong</em> would be this strong… Now… Now it’s almost useless and your eldest brother can’t sleep at night, feeling like every bone in his body is hurting fiercely.”</p>
<p><em>Oh.</em> Knowing that Lu Lingzhi was not doing well, Ye Zhen felt that she could feel at ease.</p>
<p>“Everything will be fine when Master develops an antidote.” Ye Zhen whispered, outwardly comforting while inwardly hoping that no matter what antidote was developed, it would be of no use to her nemesis.</p>
<p>Pei Shi felt sorry for her nephew, but she also didn’t want to say too many unhappy matters before her daughter, so she smiled and diverted the topic. “By the way, there’s one more thing I want to tell you.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen tilted her head and looked at her mother with bright and clear eyes. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s about Marquis Jing Ning.” Pei <em>Shi</em> couldn’t help but beam at the mention of Tang Zhen. “He wants to propose marriage. Your father and I both think it’s quite good. Old Madam also likes him very much. What do you think of him Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“Tang Zhen… came to propose marriage?” Ye Zhen’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
