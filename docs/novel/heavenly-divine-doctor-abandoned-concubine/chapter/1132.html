            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 195 – It Was Meant For Her (1)</strong></p>
<p><i>Fate sure works in mysterious ways. </i><i>How many times have I thought of retrieving the medical classics?! And how many times have I failed at it?! But now… it is in Lu Yaoyao’s hands… a very talented person… Perhaps this </i><i>was what Empress Qi Yanling had en</i><i>visioned and it manifested after all these years…</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Qi Jin’s departing figure in puzzlement. Although the latter had shown a positive reaction, she wondered why she felt a bit strange. Her questions and ensuing reactions to her answers seemed too out of the ordinary. She had seemed astonished and unsettled.</p>
<p>However, she had no time to dwell upon it. The porridge was ready.</p>
<p>Since Mo Rongyi had only eaten light meals for several days, she avoided adding too much seasoning. She had chosen the bone soup as the base instead of plain water to ensure the porridge did not have a heavy medicinal flavour. When she checked the taste, it felt good. Moreover,  the <i>lingquan</i> added a fragrance masking the unpleasant smell of the herbs.</p>
<p>Soon, she personally brought over the medicated porridge to the little prince’s chambers. She saw the mother and son having a chat. It was such an endearing sight.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, the porridge is ready,” Ye Zhen said with a smile. Looking around she noticed Mo Rongzhan’s absence, she instantly felt better.</p>
<p>“Are you certain I will not be in pain if I eat?” Mo Rongyi still had lingering fears, he refused to eat immediately.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen put down the tray. “I cannot say for sure.”</p>
<p>At those words, Madam Nuan, who was in the midst of scooping out the porridge into a bowl, stilled. She looked towards Mo Rongyi, checking for his reaction.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi simply stared at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen let out a small laugh. “You have to try. Who can survive without eating?”</p>
<p>The empress dowager was also anxious about her son’s refusal to eat. She persuaded him. “Even if it hurts, Yaoyao’s massage will relieve pain. Go on now, have some.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi hesitated for a moment and leaned over to smell it. “It smells good.” He declared.</p>
<p>He was a little surprised. Since he was ill, he almost ate nothing and seldom smelled the flavor of the meal because they would ruin his rare appetite immediately. This was the first time he had actually found the food appealing.</p>
<p>The empress dowager was pleasantly surprised. “Then have a taste.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi puckered his lips and took a small sip. The porridge that rolled out from the bone soup effused a pleasant fragrance. The taste of the medicine was very light but astonishingly it added to its deliciousness.</p>
<p><i>It’s delicious!</i> Mo Rongyi’s eyes brightened as Madam Nuan fed him spoon after spoon.</p>
<p>In a short time, a bowl of porridge bottomed out.</p>
<p>The empress dowager was pleasantly surprised. The little prince had not eaten so much for a long time.</p>
<p>Qi Jin was equally surprised. She gazed at Ye Zhen. <i>Is there anything special about the porridge she made?</i></p>
<p>“Give me another bowl,” Mo Rongyi said. It was rare that he had an appetite.</p>
<p>“Little Prince, how do you feel now?” Afraid that Mo Rongyi would fall ill, Qi Jin cannot help but ask.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi touched his chest. “This prince feels… quite warm.”</p>
<p>It came as a shock to those around, that Mo Rongyi, who loathed medicated diet and never once eaten without throwing tantrums these past few days, ate two bowls of porridge. Neither did he complain about the taste nor say that he felt pain while eating. Had Qi Jin not stopped him, this little royalty would have wanted another bowl!</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was a little peeved. For someone who up until recently could not consume even half a bowl of anything without agony, two bowls of porridge seemed insatiable. Thus, he tried to argue his right to the third bowl.</p>
<p>“This prince has not eaten so much in a long time and here you are depriving him.”</p>
<p>Every spoon that Madam Nuan had fed the little prince, had heightened Ye Zhen’s senses. Her eyes never left the prince’s face, peering at him cautiously.</p>
<p>Apart from Qi Jin’s grandson whom she had accidentally met, she had not used <i>lingquan</i> to cure anyone. She was unsure of its effects. This time, she had taken a huge gamble by adding it to the porridge. Through her experience, when she had herself consumed it and found the changes in her body, she surmised it could help alleviate Mo Rongyi’s illness. Even so, she did not dare to take it for granted and kept a constant lookout for ill effects.</p>
<p>“How do you feel now, Your Highness?” Qi Jin asked again. He had downed two bowls so the medicine should be taking effect by now.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi shook his head in puzzlement. “I feel better.”</p>
<p>At that, Ye Zhen’s lips broke into a smile, her eyes looked at him brightly. “Do you not feel any pain?”</p>
<p>“I feel no pain.” Mo Rongyi was keenly observing the sensations in his body, especially the usual feeling of dying pain post-ingestion. He was astounded to feel nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>A long lost smile appeared on the mother’s lips, the once desolate eyes shone with a glint of happiness. The empress dowager was evidently elated by the improvement, albeit a tiny one, in her son. For the first time, the palace staff witnessed their mistress’ unconcealed ebullience.</p>
<p>She stood up, clapped her hands, and said, “Oh, just let him eat to his heart’s content!” She beckoned Madam Nuan to bring another bowl of porridge.</p>
<p>Qi Jin simply gazed at Ye Zhen in wonderment. She had never doubted this little girl’s capabilities, but what she evinced today, was beyond words. In fact, it was nothing short of a miracle.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi yawned. “Mother, I’m a little tired.”</p>
<p>The excruciating pain had kept him from sleeping. Moreover, he had recently cried and made a din. Now that he felt the warmth all over his body, he just wanted to sleep soundly.</p>
<p>“Then have a rest.” The empress dowager immediately gestured towards Madam Nuan to help Mo Rongyi lie down.</p>
<p>Qi Jin went over to Mo Rongyi’s bed, checked his pulse, and confirmed that there was nothing strange. She nodded to the empress dowager and smiled at Ye Zhen again.</p>
<p>As soon as he lay down, Mo Rongyi fell asleep. It had been a long time since this little prince had felt calm.</p>
<p>Looking at her peacefully sleeping son, the empress dowager felt immense relief. “Imperial Physician Qi, the little prince shall be handed over to you.”</p>
<p>Qi Jin acquiesced with a low bow before the elated dowager.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you did well.” The empress dowager looked at Ye Zhen with satisfaction. She had always found this young girl’s character likable. Not only could she relieve her son’s pain but could also restore his appetite. A knot seemed to have untangled in her heart.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen humbly kowtowed and said, “This is what one ought to do.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager’s smile expressed her genuine pleasure. This girl, her words and deeds, always seemed to touch her heart.  “I will ask the little prince to give you 40,000 taels.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, this official’s daughter was only jesting.” Ye Zhen replied awkwardly.</p>
<p>“This jest… I shall take it seriously,” The empress dowager said with a smile. She took one final glance at her blissfully slumbering son and left with Aunt Cheng to the Cining Palace.</p>
<p>Soon after, Madam Nuan approached Ye Zhen. “Miss Lu, this servant will take you to your room so you can rest.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen obliged politely. “Please lead the way.”</p>
