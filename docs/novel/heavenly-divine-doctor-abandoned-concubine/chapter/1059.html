            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 270 – The Wang Fei’s Predicament (2)</strong></p>
<p>Lu Fang sneered at the departing figure. Right now, this girl was calmer than a clam. She saw right through the other’s heart and refused to rise to the bait. So what if she were angry, what did it have to do with her?!</p>
<p>As soon as Ye Zhen went inside the room, Lu Shixun stood up from the bed and said to Old Madam Lu, “Mother, then I shall retire. Rest well.”</p>
<p>“Second Uncle.” Ye Zhen curtsied and remained standing by the door.</p>
<p>Lu Shixun looked at her indifferently and nodded. “Yaoyao is here.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, come to Grandmother.” Old Madam Lu waved at Ye Zhen. She was sitting on the bed with the headband, looking a little pale.</p>
<p>“Take good care of your grandmother,” Lu Shixun said to her and left the room.</p>
<p>Madam Chen put down the ginseng tea. “Old Madam, Third Miss made you some ginseng tea.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu smiled with lidded eyes. “Our Yaoyao is such a filial girl.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took the tea from Madam Chen’s hand said, “Grandmother, let me feed you.”</p>
<p>“Old Madam, I shall leave the room.” Madam Chen smiled.</p>
<p>When they were the only ones in the room, Ye Zhen started to feed the elder ginseng tea. Sip by sip the tea soothed and eased her. Warmth surged in a heart, and she gazed at the dainty girl with a kind smile.</p>
<p>It was no secret, that in the beginning, the only granddaughter she cared about was Shuang’er. She was filled with nothing but pride and doting when it came to the girl, and see how she had raised the family’s status to the pinnacle, her choice was justified. It was not that she didn’t wish to favour anyone else, but none of them was striking enough and thus her hopes and aspirations solely focused on the eldest granddaughter.</p>
<p>However, all that changed with the arrival of this border town girl. From the moment she had first come to pay her respects, she had developed an affinity to this beautiful, gentle, and kind granddaughter. By and by, she had made a place for her in her heart.</p>
<p>One could argue that it was her unparalleled beauty that smitten the old matriarch. Of course, beauty was important, and no one knew this better than this old woman. But she who was worldly wise knew just how much importance one had to attach to a thing called beauty. Even a celestial beauty would pale before an innocent and tender heart. And it was this very trait in Yaoyao that had won her through and through.</p>
<p>When presented with two of a kind, comparisons are bound to arise. Lu Wushuang and Lu Yaoyao were both di daughters from the same family. While one was raised in the lap of luxury and was spoiled rotten, the other grew up in the harsh environs of the borders. And yet, it was the latter that had turned out to be the gem. Kind, filial, tolerant, humble … bereft of any superficiality. She was astute, knew what she wanted clearly.</p>
<p><em>Why couldn’t Shuang’er be like Yaoyao?</em> <em>No, even just half of Yaoyao, she wouldn’t need to be so worried.</em></p>
<p>As she looked at the girl sincerely serving her, the old matriarch sighed with feeling. “Today Wang Fei wanted me to settle your marriage.”</p>
<p>Slightly taken aback at the abruptness, Ye Zhen moved her eyes and said in a low voice, “Why does Wang Fei have to settle my marriage? The Lu Family just cannot bear with me at all?”</p>
<p>“Silly girl! That is nonsense!” Old Madam Lu comforted her softly. “Shuang’er is spoiled, and always thinks that we should all listen to her. If anyone is not pleasing to her eyes, others should hate them too.” And just like that, without mincing her words, she had plainly stated the darkest fact. Not at all shielding the other’s shortcomings.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was quite astonished at the sudden admission. Although her words were meant to prod and lighten the atmosphere, never did she expect this old-timer to reveal such a matter. Somewhere, her heart tugged. She had to admit, this old woman perhaps genuinely liked her to be so forthright.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, then … who does she want me to marry?” Ye Zhen asked quietly.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu patted Ye Zhen’s hand lightly. The girl was young and full of aspirations. She had never been driven by whims and fancies, and unlike the others her age, her actions and decisions were not only prudent but sincere even. Since the time she had entered the academy, this elder’s faith in her genuineness had only deepened.</p>
<p>“You are still studying at the academy, we won’t settle your marriage so soon. Don’t worry, Grandmother is here. Anyway, without your parents’ consent, who would make this decision for you.” She reassured the naïve girl.</p>
<p>Setting aside the teacup, overcome with emotions, Ye Zhen held Old Madam Lu’s arm slightly. “Grandmother, you are so nice to me, I will treat you better in the future.”</p>
