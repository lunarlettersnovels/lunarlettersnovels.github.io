            <p><strong>Chapter 441 – Brother And Sister (2)</strong></p>
<p>“I was already magnanimous to you. No matter what you did, I turned a blind eye. Why then, did you think that if I was sick, you could bully the lonely and widowed empress dowager?” Mo Rongzhan stared at the fifth prince with cold eyes. He was the angriest that they used the empress dowager as an excuse. Had something happened to him, they would not have spared her.</p>
<p>The fifth prince suddenly knelt and said, “Your Majesty, it was this minister who became possessed after being instigated by him. Please let me go. I will never dare to commit such things again. You, after all, know this minister. I have nothing to do but eat and drink every day. I have never thought about it… Forcing the emperor to abdicate the throne and force entering the palace were all because this subject was instigated. ”</p>
<p>A furious Old Prince Kang kicked him heavily. “You’re embarrassing, absolutely useless! Today, this prince lost, if you want to finish me off, you can do whatever you want. This prince will never beg for mercy. ”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded. “Uncle Prince, you are so bold.”</p>
<p>“Hmph!” Old Prince Kang knew too well that even if he begged for mercy, it would be useless. In fact, they should have known. When the deposed emperor in the palace refused to see them, he knew that they would not succeed. <em>Otherwise, how could the deposed emperor not be moved?</em></p>
<p>Although the deposed emperor was defeated by Mo Rongzhan, if it weren’t for Ye Yisong causing him damage, his throne might not have been usurped.</p>
<p>“I have nothing to ask you. Go to prison and accompany the eighth one,” Mo Rong Zhan said lightly.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen ordered to detain both of them. He walked behind Mo Rongzhan and asked in a low voice, “Your Majesty, are the ministers who spread rumors outside the court to be arrested as well?”</p>
<p>“I’ll talk about it tomorrow morning,” Mo Rongzhan said indifferently. He knew that some people in the court were still in two minds. He might as well just take advantage of this incident to clean them out.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this official will first arrange for the soldiers brought by the fifth prince to serve in the border areas,” Tang Zhen said.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan nodded, seeing that everything up front had been handled. “Well, let’s go.”</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>In the Cining Palace, the empress dowager was fidgeting. When she came out of the Palace of the Heavenly Purity she had already heard the shouts saying ‘kill’. Now that it had been this long, and the sky had also darkened, there was still no news from the emperor at all. How could she not be anxious when she didn’t know what in the world was going on?</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, don’t worry, the emperor will be alright.” Ye Zhen held the empress dowager’s hand and let her sit down. “With Marquis Jingning and General Wei, and Grand General Meng in the Western Camp, just Fifth Prince and the others will never be able to defeat the emperor.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager sighed. “I’m just afraid that some ministers in the court will take advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble.”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Ye Zhen to speak, Xu Huiru hurriedly said, “You can rest assured, Empress Dowager. This concubine’s father is in the court, nothing would go wrong.”</p>
<p>“I hope so.” The empress dowager nodded gravely, still unable to stop worrying.</p>
<p>It was not until night fell completely that Eunuch Fu came to ensure everything was safe and sound, did they find out that the fifth prince and others had been captured. The emperor was safe and sound as well, discussing state affairs with the cabinet ministers in the imperial study.</p>
<p><em>It all subsided this soon? </em>Ye Zhen was a little surprised, but she also felt that it was normal. If even dealing with the fifth prince required such a great experience, then Mo Rongzhan wouldn’t grace that throne for too long.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you go and see to the emperor, aijia is worried about his wounds,” the empress dowager said hurriedly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and said, “Imperial Mother, you sit down and rest first. I will go to the Palace of Heavenly Purity to have a look.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru stood up and said, “I want to go too.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager frowned and glanced at her. But upon thinking that she was also worried about the emperor, she resisted speaking up.</p>
<p>“Xu Xianfei, why don’t you go then? I’ll be with the empress dowager here,” Ye Zhen said. She didn’t want to compete with Xu Huiru for any limelight.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, Xu Xianfei doesn’t understand medicine, you go ahead,” said empress dowager.</p>
<p>With that, Ye Zhen had to follow Xu Huiru to the Palace of Heavenly Purity.</p>
<p>It was bright as day tonight all over the palace, Ye Zhen and Xu Huiru walked side by side yet neither of them spoke. They were quite different in ways, so naturally there was nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao.” Xu Huiru slowed down and motioned for Qianlan and the others to withdraw. She turned to look at Ye Zhen with a smile. “What is the relationship between you and His Majesty…?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart jumped,<em> what did Xu Huiru find?</em> “Xu Xianfei, what do you mean? I don’t quite understand.”</p>
<p>“Do you really not understand?” Xu Huiru sneered, her face cold. “The emperor heard that you went to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard and hurried over to find you in desperation. In the emperor’s mind, I am afraid that your status is not as simple as that of a sister’s.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen narrowed her eyes at her slightly. It seemed that Xu Huiru could really see it. “Xu Xianfei, do you know what you are saying?”</p>
