<p>Lu Lingzhi saw Tang Zhen’s disconcerted look, which made him think that there was something else he was keeping to himself.</p>
<p>“What is it? Is there anything else wrong with that horse?” Lu Lingzhi asked.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen shook his head gently. “It has nothing to do with that matter. It has something to do with… Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>At the mention of his third sister, Lu Lingzhi frowned. “What’s wrong with Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>The marquis started to pace the room, his brows crossed, befuddling thoughts in his mind.</p>
<p>“Did Yaoyao really grow up living in the border town? Does she know the Ye Family? She seems to have… different feelings for them.”</p>
<p>Because mentioning the Ye Family was a taboo, Tang Zhen’s voice was no more than a whisper while he laid out his concerns in front of his friend.</p>
<p>Before Lu Lingzhi saw Lu Yoayao’s appearance, the Ye Family had no meaning to him, except for the little shame he felt when reminded of the woman he killed by poison.</p>
<p>However, Lu Yaoyao was the splitting image of Ye Zhen. After the murder, he had an inexplicable resistance to the memory of the Ye Family and didn’t want to have any kind of involvement.</p>
<p>He had been afraid that Lu Yaoyao would bring Ye Zhen to the memories of the people, but how despicable was it to find that his sister had known the deceased wang fei all this time!</p>
<p>“Yaoyao has lived all her life in the border town, and she doesn’t know the Ye Family at all.” Lu Lingzhi answered directly, with a spat of disgust.</p>
<p>Unconvinced, Tang Zhen elaborately repeated Ye Zhen’s words to Lu Lingzhi. The longer he spoke, the more Lu Lingzhi felt shaken…</p>
<p>“… she seems to be very familiar with Ye Zhen. Go and find out if there is anyone feeding her with lies.”</p>
<p><i>LuYaoyao and Ye Zhen…</i></p>
<p><i>Does Lu Yaoyao know that she looks like the late wang fei?</i></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi grimaced at this thought.</p>
<p>The heavens were playing him in the most torturous way possible! <i>Did they purposely give him a third sister that looked exactly like Ye Zhen to remind him of what he had done to the woman?!</i></p>
<p>“I know who it is,” Lu Lingzhi said in a dangerously low voice, “The woman beside Yaoyao is the former teacher of Ye Zhen.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen suddenly froze, realization hitting him. “It is that woman who was doing the trick. I’ll take care of her!”</p>
<p>Just before recklessness got the best of the marquis, Lu Lingzhi stopped him in his tracks.</p>
<p>“I only know that the teacher comes from a powerful family, born of the first wife I heard. As long as she is breathing, we cannot touch her.”</p>
<p>“Then should we just let her continue poisoning Yaoyao’s mind?” Tang Zhen asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t fret. I’ll talk to my third sister.” Lu Lingzhi sighed lightly.</p>
<p>No wonder Lu Yaoyao had always been cold and indifferent to him. <i>Is it because she sympathizes with the Ye Family and thinks he was the executioner?</i></p>
<p>Tang Zhen threw a fleeting glance at him. “I don’t think Yaoyao likes you very much. If you talk to her, would she listen to you?”</p>
<p>He hated to admit it, but Tang Zhen was telling the truth. Lu Lingzhi’s face sank realizing that she would not listen to him at all.</p>
<p>“It’s better that I tell her myself.” Tang Zhen cautiously said, “If she knew about the Tang Family, she would understand that the Ye Family deserved to die.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi craned his neck to give a warning look to Tang Zhen, knowing exactly his motive.</p>
<p>“You stay away from Yaoyao. She is my third uncle’s daughter. Although she is my sister, she is still not on the marriage shelf. My third uncle may not want her to marry a marquis.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was able to see through his mind easily, but Tang Zhen was not offended at the very least. “I have no parents. Yaoyao will not have to please an old family in the future. There’s no other woman whom I am interested in. Why won’t the third lord agree?”</p>
<p><i>What was his friend talking about? He was simply the best young man in the world to marry!</i></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s heart grew restless, he never expected to see the day when he would have this kind of conversation with his friend!</p>
<p>“You will have to have Yaoyao’s consent. She will be attending the Academy for Women. Even if she indeed entertains the thought of getting married, it will be after two years.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen laughed. “That’s right, I can get to know Yaoyao first during those two years.”</p>
<p>He admired Third Miss Lu; Tang Zhen was certain about it. If after years of pursuing her and his offer would still be turned down, he promised himself that he would be a gentleman and not force her despite his position.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao is a little girl who knows nothing about the world. If you destroy her reputation, I will not forgive you,” Lu Lingzhi said coldly.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen nodded solemnly. “I naturally know the weight.”</p>
