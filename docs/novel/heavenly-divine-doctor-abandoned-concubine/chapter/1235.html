            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 92 – Rewards (1)</h3>
<p>When Mo Rongzhan returned to Chengde Mountain Villa, he rewarded the Lu Family with many things, saying that the third miss of the Lu Family had rendered meritorious service in saving the little prince.</p>
<p>He did not doubt Ye Zhen, he believed all she that said. Now the only person who could let him know the answer was Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>Pei Shi was pleasantly surprised to learn that Ye Zhen had accidentally saved the little prince. After thanking him, she let people take all the things the emperor had given to Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s heart, on the other hand, was not happy. The emperor had already seen Yaoyao. <i>Did he notice that she looked like the late wang fei?</i></p>
<p>After some thought, Lu Lingzhi felt that the emperor had not detected the resemblance, or why else a word about the wang fei hadn’t reached his ears? Neither did the emperor summon him.</p>
<p><i>If he had recognized Lu Yaoyao’s remarkable resemblance to Ye Zhen, the emperor would have questioned him.</i></p>
<p><i>Did this count as a perfect escape? </i></p>
<p>Ah! His heart could only rejoice at this fact.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen came in sullenly from the outside. “Yaoyao went to the woods. If I was there, I could have met her.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi shot him a light glance. “The emperor has ordered us to go back to the palace tomorrow. Do you want to stay?”</p>
<p>“I… would like to!” Tang Zhen replied in his casual voice, his face morphing into a frown as he realized that his job was not yet over. His investigation with the horse had not yet reached its completion.</p>
<p><i>Ah! When will he have time to live here leisurely?</i></p>
<p>“It’s a pity that I am injured, otherwise I would certainly help you,” Lu Lingzhi said frustratedly.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen pulled out a fake smile. “Don’t talk nonsense, I will come to see you when I find out the truth.”</p>
<p>“Does she still refuse to see you? Yaoyao will not avoid you if she wants to see you. Give her some time.” Lu Lingzhi’s mood improved when he learned that his sister didn’t want to see Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>“And what? Let her continue to sympathize with the Ye Family? If I don’t tell her the truth, she might even blame you in the future,” Tang Zhen said.</p>
<p>“Who is blaming Eldest Brother?” Lu Xiangzhi came in from the outside with medicine in his hand.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen looked at Lu Xiangzhi and saw that his hand was already able to move freely. He could not help but exclaim in wonder. “Your hand… It has already healed.”</p>
<p><i>That was too fast!</i></p>
<p>He had seen Lu Xiangzhi’s wound with his own eyes, although there was no fracture, the deep gash scraped by the stone would not heal well in half a month. At this time, he looked as if he had recovered.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi immediately moved his injured hand, waving it in the air. “I took Yaoyao’s medicine, but I didn’t want to take it. She made me take it. As a result, I don’t feel the usual pain today. It has not healed completely yet, but her medicine is really effective.”</p>
<p>“Since she has such a good medicine, why didn’t she give one to Eldest Brother?” Tang Zhen examined Lu Xiangzhi’s wound and it was indeed much better than yesterday. It seems that Yaoyao’s medicine was even better than the one sent from the palace.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi smiled bitterly. “Because I am not <i>her</i> brother.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, that is definitely not the case. Maybe… maybe Yaoyao only had one bottle of medicine, so she wasn’t able to give one to you.” Lu Xiangzhi was embarrassed for sounding too proud in front of his elder brother, but he was still very happy to think that his sister cared for him more.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen looked at Lu Xiangzhi’s wound, which was covered with a layer of scab. “Yaoyao’s medicine is amazing. Go and ask her for two more bottles. Maybe the leg injury that has been slow in recovering will heal faster.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi said, “Mother asked me to send something to Yaoyao. Afterwards, I will ask her for Eldest Brother’s medicine.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to find Yaoyao? I’ll go with you!” Tang Zhen immediately said. If she found him with Lu Xiangzhi, she would no longer have reasons to refuse to talk to him.</p>
<p>But as soon as Tang Zhen had said this, Eunuch Fu’s voice came from outside. “Marquis Tang, the emperor has asked this servant to invite you over.”</p>
<p>“…” Tang Zhen grimaced. “It seems that I can’t go with you.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi laughed and shook his head. “Go quickly!” The emperor must have something important to say for him to ask Eunuch Fu to come to you.”</p>
<p>Inevitably, Tang Zhen had to go to see Mo Rongzhan first.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, you take the medicine first.” Lu Xiangzhi brought out the medicine and whispered. “Eldest Brother, don’t blame Yaoyao for not being sensible. She is just like this.”</p>
<p>“I know, Yaoyao is young.” Lu Lingzhi took the medicine and put the bowl aside. “Go and give her what the emperor has given you. I don’t know if she has said anything in front of the emperor. Go back and ask.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi thought his eldest brother was worried that Yaoyao would be disrespectful to the emperor. He immediately said, “Yes, I’ll ask her when I get back.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi knew that his brother had misunderstood, but he didn’t say much more. He asked Lu Xiangzhi to leave quickly as night was fast approaching.</p>
