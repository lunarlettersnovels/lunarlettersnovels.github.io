            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 317 –  Winning Over (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>A family?</em> Ye Zhen’s smile grew deeper. <em>This was an interesting way to put it. </em>“I dare not attest to that. Imperial Consort Xian, you just heard the Empress Dowager as well. I am only going to be getting a title, that’s all. There’s really nothing that has changed.”</p>
<p>Although she was now a princess, until she got married, she would be staying at the Lu Mansion. The empress dowager had stated that she wanted to build a new princess mansion for her. As for the one given to Princess Royal, she thought that it was unlucky. Also, it would be at least two or three years before the said mansion finished construction.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was also happy at the Lu Mansion. How else would she be able to watch over Lu Lingzhi? Furthermore, the empress dowager had also said that if she still wanted to study at the School of Medicine, she was free to do so. After all, it was because of her medical skills that she was able to save Mo Rongyi.</p>
<p>Having the empress dowager’s word, Ye Zhen couldn’t think of any excuse to refuse the title of Princess Furong.</p>
<p>”In the future, you will understand that being a princess is much different,” Xu Huiru said, seemingly implying something far deeper.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “Imperial Consort Xian, Empress Dowager seems to be looking for us. Let’s return to the cooling pavilion.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru turned only to find Aunt Cheng looking their way. She then returned with Ye Zhen to the pavilion.</p>
<p>The empress dowager smiled and said to Xu Huiru, “The emperor and the prime minister are at the water pavilion over there. Imperial Consort Xian, why don’t you go over. I will be fine with just Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager, why don’t I continue accompanying you in observing the flowers.” Xu Huiru’s face grew red. She knew that the other was giving her an opportunity to grow closer to the emperor. However, she needed to act a bit more reserved lest her intentions are discovered.</p>
<p>To this day, she was still unsure of how she had made the emperor dissatisfied with herself. Why would he not allow her to wait upon him (sleep with him)? Was it that he was trying to warn her to keep her place?</p>
<p>The empress dowager laughed. “I have Yaoyao here. Why don’t you go?”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru insisted no more, bowed, and took leave.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked emotionlessly at the departing figure. Compared to Lu Wushuang, Xu Huiru was noticeably more skilled and scheming. She had once thought that the two would become enemies. But as of today, it was clear that the former was no opponent of the latter.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was a bit discomfited at the sight of Xu Huiru gaining so much favor with the empress dowager. She feared that Shuang’er’s days in the inner palace would grow increasingly more difficult.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, come sit near me.” The empress dowager waved at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen immediately sat next to her. “Empress Dowager.”</p>
<p>The other touched her head. “Yaoyao, speak honestly with me. Would you like to come to the palace frequently in the future and talk with me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I would like to.” Ye Zhen lightly nodded. “I’ll just hope that you don’t think of me as annoying in the future.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu gave her a look. Seeing this granddaughter of hers, she felt a slight sense of relief. At least now Shuang’er wouldn’t want Yaoyao to leave the capital anymore. This was a pretty good thing.</p>
<p>The empress dowager sighed as she looked at Ye Zhen. If only Lu Yaoyao didn’t look like Ye Zhen, she would’ve been willing to help fulfill the emperor’s wishes. However, if the Emperor grew to know of this and then hated her, then wouldn’t that be pushing this little girl onto Ye Zhen’s old path? She couldn’t bear that. If she didn’t truly love this girl, how could she bear to work against her own son?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t know what the empress dowager was lamenting over, smiling as she said, “Your Imperial Highness, I know that there is a forest in the Baihua Garden, with many fruits on the trees. I’ll go fetch some for you to taste.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager looked at her with surprise. “You know that there are fruits in the forest?”</p>
<p>“I saw them the last time I came here.” Ye Zhen smiled and answered.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu shook her head and said, “I feel like you are just unwilling to stay still for any longer.”</p>
<p>“Go, go.” The empress dowager smiled and waved.</p>
