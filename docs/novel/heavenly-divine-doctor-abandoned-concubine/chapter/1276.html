            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 51 – The Chen Sisters (1)</h3>
<p>The two misses belonged to the line of Old Madam Lu’s mother. Before the Lu Family entered the limelight, the Chen Family didn’t associate much with them.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8">
<div class="orp-player-wrapper aspectRateFixed orp-player-ipm orp-player-ipm-hidden" data-hidden="false">
<div class="light-player-wrapper"><iframe class="orp-player-iframe" title="org" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<div class="fkstck"></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>But now, their attitudes towards the Lu Family had completely changed.</p>
<p>Seeing how Lu Jing had deliberately emphasized that they were students of the prestigious academy, Ye Zhen just smiled. “That’s great! Having more than two sisters at the academy would be joyful!”</p>
<p>Chen Qiuping glanced at Ye Zhen and said with a smile, “We were lucky enough to be admitted to the academy.”</p>
<p>Those who could get into the Academy for Women couldn’t just get away with luck. The Chen Sisters had been trained by their family to have high aspirations since childhood.</p>
<p>With them being a family of commoners, the Chen Sisters had difficulty arranging a marriage with men from noble families. Therefore, they could only make efforts to change this.</p>
<p>They told themselves that as long as they could make a name in the Academy for Women, they would gain popularity and a chance for a higher status.</p>
<p>Indeed, they had succeeded. Only, they didn’t expect Lu Jing to outshine them, completely overshadowing their glory.</p>
<p>However, now that they had the third miss, who had just come from the border town, the Chen Sisters felt that a rare opportunity was handed to them!</p>
<p>It was their time to finally shine!</p>
<p>In their minds, if Ye Zhen made a fool out of herself during the examination, people would start comparing her with them, making them look far superior in talents!</p>
<p>With this in mind, Chen Qiuping smiled more and more kindly at Ye Zhen. “It’s really good that my third sister will learn with us soon.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen faintly frowned and said, “Unfortunately, I will take the examination of the School of Medicine, which is different from my sisters’ chosen fields.”</p>
<p>Besides, the Chen Sisters had entered the academy at young ages and been performing well ever since. In fact, they would be finishing after a year.</p>
<p>Lu Yaoyao should’ve graduated with them if only she wasn’t contained in the border town all her life. They were the same age and even Lu Jing who was younger than her was already admitted to the academy.</p>
<p>Due to this fact, Old Madam Lu felt the need to clear things out and intervene.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao missed the opportunity to study in the Academy for Women in the border town, but luckily the School of Medicine does not restrict her age. She has some basic skills which the Academy for Women could appreciate.”</p>
<p>“What’s so good about the School of Medicine? Do you want to be a physician when you graduate?” Chen Liping had some disdain in her eyes. She despised practicing medicine as she deemed it a poor profession. For women, that is.</p>
<p>The tone of displeasure didn’t escape the old madam’s notice. Her head perked up as her mouth curled into a frown,</p>
<p>“What is wrong with being a physician? Wasn’t Empress Duanhui a physician in history?”</p>
<p><i>It was more than a hundred years ago. Who knows if what the history books say is true or not?</i> Chen Liping thought bitterly to herself.</p>
<p>Although the Academy for Women was founded by the empress, with <i>Renhe Tang’s</i> fame reaching far and wide, it was no longer the era of the Jing Dynasty, nor was the imperial family surnamed Huangfu. Everything had long been different.</p>
<p>Looking at Chen Liping’s disdain, Ye Zhen also disagreed. In the past, she rarely visited the School of Medicine as it had never fascinated her, but now she realized its importance.</p>
<p>Not only was it a respectable and quite an impressive job a woman could have, but it could also be her fastest way to entering the imperial palace where her revenge would transpire!</p>
<p>“My grandmother’s opinions are always sensible but I dare not be like the Empress.. Our wang fei is already a blessing. I am already satisfied to be a first-class physician at the imperial palace.” Ye Zhen rubbed her arms a few times, showing a little bashfulness while speaking sweetly.</p>
<p>“Dear, you are young yet you sound more sensible than most girls your age!” Old Madam Lu touched her face and liked her granddaughter a little more.</p>
<p>Lu Jing gave Ye Zhen a look and secretly hated her third sister for pleasing the matriarch with her glib tongue!</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I will take the final exam next year. You said before that if I do well in the exam, I will be rewarded.”</p>
<p>“Well, what reward do you want?”</p>
<p>The happiest thing for Old Madam Lu was to watch several of her granddaughters to successfully graduate from the Academy for Women. It was also an honor to their family.</p>
<p><i>Those who looked down on their Lu Family and think that merchants cannot afford to be noble and generous, just wait for a slap in the face!</i></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu decided to give whatever Lu Jing wished for.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang was hailed as one of the most remarkable wang fei the capital ever had, which was the biggest slap to those naysayers. Even Ye Zhen, the daughter of a distinguished family, could not rival her!</p>
<p>“Grandmother, Third Sister got a good whip the other day. I like it very much. Please ask her to give me the whip as a reward if ever I manage to graduate…”</p>
<p>Lu Jing deliberately spoke with an innocent and flawless face looking eagerly towards Old Madam.</p>
