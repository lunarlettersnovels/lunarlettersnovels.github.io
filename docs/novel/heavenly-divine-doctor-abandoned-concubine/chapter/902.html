            <p><strong>Chapter 427 – Why Should I Help You? (1)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked back at Lu Lingzhi. So, this was what he wanted to ask today. Although he had been recuperating from his injuries at home, he was not ignorant of the recent events in the capital. So, today he ignored his body and went out to accompany the old madam. Obviously, his real purpose lay in something else.</p>
<p>“How do you know that the emperor is injured?” Ye Zhen asked with a smile. She naturally hoped that Mo Rongzhan would no longer trust Lu Lingzhi, but the man before her was too smart as such she couldn’t make it too obvious lest her provocation be detected.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi smiled faintly. “You and the little prince went to the hunting grounds and the emperor went to look for you. In the end, I can only see you all safe and sound whereas the emperor hasn’t been to court for two days. Tang Zhen arrested the eighth prince; the fifth prince and Old Prince Kang went to the palace again and begged to see the emperor but weren’t able to… It was easy to guess.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him with cold eyes. “Guess about what?”</p>
<p>“I want to know, how are the emperor’s injuries?” Lu Lingzhi asked. He had never thought that Ye Zhen would refuse to tell him. In his opinion, since this little girl was surnamed Lu, even if she was dissatisfied with Shuang’er’s actions, she would definitely help the Lu family.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Ye Zhen shook her head without thinking. “I didn’t have to go to the Palace of Heavenly Purity today. Xianfei Xu was inside.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi misinterpreted it as Xu Huiru not letting Yaoyao in, his face sank. “Didn’t the Empress Dowager let you take care of the emperor? Why would Xu Huiru not let you in?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “You don’t need to enter the court right now. The emperor asked you to rest up and let your injuries heal. Why do you want to know how his injuries are?”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, Shuang’er is no longer a noble consort, our Lu family’s status in the capital is already at stake. For the sake of the family, I naturally have to care more about the emperor,” he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you anything since I am also not clear about it. However… Old Prince Kang and Fifth Prince’s words and actions today were truly too presumptuous. I don’t know what they’ll do,” she said. She wanted to subtly direct Lu Lingzhi to turn to the fifth prince’s side. If he did, then when Mo Rongzhan recovers, he would certainly not let him off.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi snorted coldly. “No matter how much the fifth prince and Old Prince Kang jump up and down, what’s the point? With his good luck the emperor will naturally be fine, even if… there is the little prince (to consider).”</p>
<p>Her face turned cold. <em>Could it be that Lu Lingzhi was actually playing along Mo Rongzhan’s plan? No, it shouldn’t be. He looks like he is looking for some opportunity.</em></p>
<p>“If Lu Wushuang can’t go back to the palace in this life, what will you do?” Ye Zhen asked with cold eyes.</p>
<p>She couldn’t wait to kill him but death was the greatest relief. She wanted to make him live in the pain of not being able to get what he wanted. He wanted the Lu family to have a stable foundation and break away from the title of merchants, then she wanted the Lu family to completely decay and for them to never become a noble.</p>
<p>“The emperor is only punishing Shuang’er, as long as she changes, he will let her go back to the palace,” he said. He didn’t know that Mo Rongzhan already knew everything.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen chuckled. “I hope so.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao…,” he glanced at her deeply and said, “if I need your help in the future will you help your eldest brother?”</p>
<p>“Why should I help you?” She laughed out loud and looked at him mockingly. “If it weren’t for my good fortune, the person in Nianci Temple might have been me right now. Why should I help someone who almost crowned me with the crime?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi smiled bitterly, and bowed with his hands held together in front of him saying, “Young Miss Yaoyao, don’t tangle about this with your eldest brother anymore. Eldest Brother really didn’t want you to take the blame at the time.”</p>
<p><em>Was she deaf and blind?</em> At that time in the palace, when facing Mo Rongzhan, he had been very vague. Had it not been for the fact that Lu Wushuang had long been disposed of, she could guarantee Lu Lingzhi would certainly make her take the blame. To him, his beloved sister was perhaps more valuable.</p>
<p>“What do you want me to do for you?” she asked. “I’m telling you right now, I won’t do any bad things for you.”</p>
<p>He laughed. “Is your eldest brother a bad person?”</p>
<p><em>Then could he still be considered a good person?</em></p>
<p>“Have you killed anyone?” Ye Zhen looked at him with clear eyes.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother goes into battle and kills more than a thousand people.” Lu Lingzhi said with a smile, “Could it be that killing immediately makes one a bad person?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said lightly, “It doesn’t count if it’s killing an enemy in battle. Have you killed an innocent person?”</p>
<p>The smile at the corner of his mouth faded a little. He had killed too many people in his life. He didn’t remember what those people looked like, but there was only one person… who was still deeply engraved in his mind.</p>
<p>“It seems that you are not what you said you are.” His reaction incited a sneer from the little girl.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao…,” he said bitterly, raising his eyes to look at a face that seemed to resemble Ye Zhen’s. He could see Ye Zhen’s resentful eyes looking at him desperately and sadly. At that time, he had sworn…</p>
<p>… That he would definitely pay her back in the next life. That, at that moment, he couldn’t do anything.</p>
<p>She said impatiently, “What the hell do you want me to do?”</p>
<p>He looked at her foolishly. “Yaoyao, how come you look… so much like her?”</p>
