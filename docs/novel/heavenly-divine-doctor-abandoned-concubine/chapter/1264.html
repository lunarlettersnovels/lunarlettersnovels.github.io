            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 63 – Reconciliation Between Husband And Wife (2)</h3>
<p>Lu Shiming quickly begged for mercy. “If it weren’t for my mother’s sake, I would certainly not allow her to be outside. Don’t think about it. You have ignored me these days. I can’t eat or sleep well. The children have started to notice this. Do you have the heart to forgive me?”</p>
<p>“Of course I have! Your daughter won’t give up.” Pei Shi snorted lightly before revealing a small smile.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao wants to go to the hot springs. I remember there is a bath near our home. If you can squeeze out a few days, you can come with us. If not, I can take Yaoyao and Xiang’er without you.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I don’t have that much time to spare. I’ll take you there and stay one night,” Lu Shiming said in a low voice that he would like to spend more time with his wife, but now as a new official he had many things to do.</p>
<p>Looking at her husband intently, it then dawned on Pei Shi that if she and her children went to the hot springs, leaving Lu Shiming alone, wouldn’t it give Xue Liu a chance?</p>
<p>Lu Shiming knew at a glance what she was thinking and said with an assuring smile.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow I will tell Mother that the rules of the family should be set up. Now we are different from before. We can no longer let the servants come to the front yard whenever they want to, so Xue Liu will not be able to come near me. I have been living in the front yard for several days. When you come back from the bath, can I go back to your chambers?”</p>
<p>He had a boyish smile on his face while he held Pei Shi closer to him.</p>
<p>Pei Shi just laughed. “Yaoyao said that she would ask Teacher Shan to go to the hot springs together. The exam will be held in half a month. I’m worried that she won’t be able to focus on her studies while in the hot springs.”</p>
<p>Feeling a little guilt, Lu Shiming realized that he had neglected his daughter a little recently. “It doesn’t matter whether Yaoyao fails or passes the exam.”</p>
<p>As a father who loved his daughter regardless of her unruly nature, Lu Shiming would be proud of Lu Yaoyao, even if she failed.</p>
<p>“In spite of that, which of the girls in the Lu Family is not from the Academy for Women? I don’t want our daughter to feel inferior to them in the future.”</p>
<p>This was every mother’s desire, to see her children lead a better life.</p>
<p>“No need to worry! She is so smart that I’m sure she will pass the exam!” Lu Shiming said with a laugh, “I heard from Xiang’er that Yaoyao has become more beautiful and more lady-like. It seems that capital really suits her.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi’s face was somewhat worried, her hands visibly shook.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming saw the change in her expression and asked what was the matter.</p>
<p>“Do you remember? The man who gave Yaoyao to us at the beginning… he had the accent of the capital. Would someone recognize Yaoyao as theirs?”</p>
<p>Pei Shi worriedly asked, her teary eyes aglow while she gazed up at her husband’s face. She hurt herself when she gave birth to her son and was unable to bear a daughter in the border town.</p>
<p>Indeed, she was given a daughter. She and her husband adopted Lu Yaoyao without hesitation. Pei Shi was seriously ill on the road and her health forbade her to be pregnant again.</p>
<p>Thus, one could just imagine the happiness she felt when Lu Yaoyao arrived at their door, a little babe squirming in fine silk wrapped around her small body.</p>
<p>But now, she had taken Yaoyao as her daughter. How could she give her back to others?</p>
<p>Fifteen years had passed, and if Yaoyao hadn’t overheard them, she wouldn’t have known all her life. However, although she knew now, she still treated them no differently than before. This was more than enough to make her happy.</p>
<p>“After all these years, when has anyone recognized our Yaoyao? Even if someone does, don’t worry, she is <i>our</i> daughter.” Lu Shiming reassured.</p>
<p>Pei Shi asked in a low voice, “Did you find out… whose child is Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“I have not tried to avoid doubts.” Lu Shiming said, “Let me go back with you. Don’t think so much about it.”</p>
<p>Pei Shi thought for a moment that even if someone really wanted to rob her daughter, she would not give up Lu Yaoyao without a fight!</p>
<p>Their love as a mother and daughter built through many years was not so easy to break, she hoped.</p>
