        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 186 – Request From the Sovereign</strong></p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang was a proud daughter of a noted family. She was beautiful, intelligent and with an exemplary aunt, had the connections too. One could say she was the archetype proud, arrogant Young Miss of an affluent family.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Ye Zhen had never entered the eyes of the haughty Huang Fuxiang. She ever looked up to Ye Zhen in terms of talent, nor was she wary of her in terms of social status. But somehow, when Ye Zhen had spoken those menacing words, she involuntarily shrank.</p>
<p>She felt an inexplicable fear course through her veins.</p>
<p>Although this girl with ethereal beauty had not spoken another word after, she still made her feel so threatened that her pallid complexion had yet to regain color.</p>
<p>A trace of regret flitted past Huang Fuxiang’s heart.</p>
<p><i>Should I not provoke this person? </i>But soon enough she was miffed at her own thoughts. <i>Why should I regret it? Lu Yaoyao is not from a noble family, but why must I be afraid that she will make it?</i></p>
<p>Just as she was about to retort, Ye Zhen walked past her, a faint fragrance of fruit wafted through the air. When Huang Fuxiang looked, she saw her holding a basket of herbs.</p>
<p>The herbs were handed over to Qin Fuzi’s assistant. All along, Ye Zhen stood by the side, not once looking at Huang Fuxiang.</p>
<p>When she saw her, Sun Wen trotted to Ye Zhen’s side and spoke in a whisper. “Yaoyao, did something happen?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I suddenly wanted to understand something,” Ye Zhen said with a smile.</p>
<p>By now, Chen Jinru had also come over.</p>
<p>“Were you not with Lu Qiongqiu? We just saw her coming back but we did not know what she said to Huang Fuxiang. Then, we do not know where Huang Fuxiang was after that.“</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes slightly sunk. Initially, when Lu Qiongqiu had approached her, she had had her suspicions. Her instincts warned her this out of the blue cordiality was not without a purpose. So, when she asked her to go to the glasshouse, at first, she had refused to go. And for the things that came after, she only had herself to blame. Who asked her to be gung-ho about the herbs and serve Lu Qiongqiu her much sought after opportunity on a platter?! Thereafter, walking into her trap was only an eventuality.</p>
<p>“What did Lu Qiongqiu do to you?” Sun Wen asked in a low voice. She was anxious for her friend, and somehow knew that person did not bode well.</p>
<p>“Nothing.” Ye Zhen replied as she looked at Lu Qiongqiu, who was standing not far away with her head bowed.</p>
<p>All this time, Lu Qiongqiu had also been very nervous. Little had she expected that Lu Yaoyao could get out of the situation without much trouble. Her current anxiety was a result of failing to fulfill the task assigned to her. At the sight of a Huang Fuxiang was seething in rage, she inferred things did not happen as she had imagined.</p>
<p>She did not want to hurt anyone, but … had no choice.</p>
<p>Lu Qiongqiu stole a guilty look at Ye Zhen, ashamed, but incapable of doing anything.</p>
<p>There are times when one has to do things that one does not necessarily want to.</p>
<p>Just then, Qin Fuzi returned. After checking the herbs his students picked, he praised Ye Zhen with satisfaction. “A rare talented medical genius. Keep working hard.”</p>
<p>Talent was a rare gift, to say nothing of a genius talent. Such people were few and far between and one found one, one as treasured. In recent years, few had made Qin Fuzi pay this much attention to. And in this batch, Ye Zhen was the first one. So, Qin Fuzi wanted to harness and hone this talent as much as he could.</p>
<p>She reckoned she would attract many an envy and despise, but she could not care less.</p>
<p>However, at Qin Fuzi’s words, Ye Zhen was somewhat distressed. She was not a genius at all. She just had a different fate. She was uncomfortable with this accolade bestowed upon her. Since she could not explain this, she could only keep quiet and go with the flow.</p>
<p>Thereupon the gathering of herbs, Ye Zhen went to Qin Fuzi to seek approval as she wanted to stay in the medicine field for a while.</p>
<p>“Why?” He was surprised by the request as few liked to stay in the cold, remote, and deserted medicine field.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said with a smile, “I feel delighted seeing these herbs.”</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi was delighted as well. This was proof his eyes had not been mistaken about this girl. Without a qualm, he agreed to let her stay and gave her the key to the Glasshouse. She was allowed to go in and have a look, but she must not damage the herbs inside.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Master Qin.” Ye Zhen wore a grateful smile.</p>
<p>For the first time since she had transmigrated into her twin’s body, she felt warmth from an outsider. She felt genuine kindness and expectation from Qin Fuzi. She was indebted and motivated.</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi smiled with satisfaction and left with the others.</p>
<p>Sun Wen and Chen Jinru insisted on staying with her, but Ye Zhen dissuaded them.</p>
<p>“You still have to go home. It is already late, and the gate will be closed when it gets dark.”</p>
<p>“You should also go back early. The medicine field is just here and you could always visit later.” Sun Wen made a final attempt in persuading her to leave.</p>
<p>Chen Jinru also echoed her thoughts. “I agree, there is no need to rush for a while.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and nodded. She knew her friends meant well and were concerned about her. But she was really in a hurry. If she could, she wanted to learn all the medical skills at once. But she also knows that haste makes waste.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not wish to linger on the topic any further and reassured her friends. “I’ll be back in a little while.”</p>
<p>Seeing that she had made up her mind, Sun Wen and Chen Jinru did not urge her any more. Thinking that, since this place was under the purview of the academy, strangers and trespassers would not be allowed entry. She would be safe here even if by herself. Hence, at ease, they left.</p>
<p>As soon as she had the field to herself, Ye Zhen set about chronicling the characteristic and appearance of each herb. She took note of their distinguishing taste, and then wrote out the various prescriptions in her mind. She had an excellent memory. As long as she had perused the medical records, she could write them down, word for word, without a hitch. However, she realized she had not seen enough and needed more practice.  Now, she was even more determined to bridge this gap.</p>
<p>When people are quiet and focused on doing something, the most annoying thing would be being disturbed.</p>
<p>However, Ye Zhen had a different feeling for this intruder.</p>
<p>“Eunuch.” She dropped her eyes and bowed. <i>It was Eunuch Fu.</i> <i>How could it be him?</i></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu had been here for a while now, but had yet to deliver the message he brought from the Imperial Palace. Crouching in the middle of the medicine field, holding a leaf in mouth earnestly- this was how Eunuch Fu found Ye Zhen when he arrived. Her beautiful and clever eyes looked confused yet delighted. She looked like a fairy who had strayed into the dust. Eunuch Fu was unwilling to disturb her.</p>
<p>He didn’t have the heart, but had to do what he was told to.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, please come with me.” Eunuch Fu said.</p>
