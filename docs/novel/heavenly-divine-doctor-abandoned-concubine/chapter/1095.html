            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 233 – An Apology (2)</strong></p>
<p>She had guessed as much that Lu Qiongqiu’s unexpected visit had had to do with none other than Huang Fuxiang. That girl not only refused to learn her lesson but was assured that Ye Zhen was a fool. Coming up with the same scheme, did she think she would be fooled for a second time?</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, it’s getting late. I have to take my rest,” Ye Zhen said, indicating for her to leave.</p>
<p>Lu Qiongqiu nodded awkwardly. “Then I won’t interfere with you.”</p>
<p>“All right.” Ye Zhen nodded faintly.</p>
<p>As she closed the door after, she couldn’t help thinking about the troublemaker Huang Fuxiang. The girl was hell-bent on not giving up it seems. She was determined to stir up all kinds of trouble, only because she was mum? Repeatedly trying to frame her, did she really think she wouldn’t dare retaliate?</p>
<p>As Ye Zhen kept the <strong>《</strong>Qi Medical Classics<strong>》</strong> safely aside, she had resolved. In this little game that the foolish Huang Fuxiang was intending to make, she would make the first move this time. Otherwise, it would be a bother to constantly keep guard against this person in the academy. Problems were best nipped in the bud, troublemakers even so.</p>
<p>The next day, Ye Zhen went to class as usual. News of her visit to the palace had not reached any student so far. However, the fact that the students did not know did not mean that the teachers were ignorant too.</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi was one of the people in the know. He had found out from Qi Jin of course. Due to this fact, he was even more convinced that his discerning eyes had not failed him. The student he valued, indeed, had the talent to learn medicine.</p>
<p>After finishing her class, Ye Zhen finished her class spoke with Qin Fuzi, then took the medicine book to the medicinal field. She wanted to go there to study and learn more about some medicinal herbs.</p>
<p>She had only managed to take a few steps when Sun Wen caught up with her.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, when did you leave the medicinal field that day? When I went back to find you, I didn’t even see your shadow.” She demanded.</p>
<p>On that day, she had gone back to the field looking for her friend afraid that something untoward may happen to her.</p>
<p>“Oh, when someone came to pick me up, then I left.” Ye Zhen replied with a smile.</p>
<p>“Are you going to the medicinal field now? Again?” Looking at the diagram of herbs in her hand, Sun Wen thought there could be no other place she would be headed to.</p>
<p>“There is nothing to do anyway. So, why not go to the medicinal field?” Ye Zhen said, still smiling.</p>
<p>Sun Wen was visibly miffed. “No wonder Master Qin likes you so much. Others are not as diligent as you.”</p>
<p>“Then will you go with me or not? Didn’t you say you wanted to become a physician in the army?” Ye Zhen teased.</p>
<p>Truth was, Ye Zhen wasn’t after recognition or appreciation. What good books, what Qin Fuzi or Qi Jin… nothing mattered to her. She genuinely wished to study and know more about the herbs illustrated in her books. She wanted to see what they looked like, smell them, and etch this picture she saw with her own eyes in her mind. There were bound to be differences between what one sees in the book from what it really looked like in reality. It was this gap that she intended to nullify.</p>
<p>After all, she had a guiding star in her hand, the medical book; there was a vast horizon before her, the medicinal field… only a fool would let go of such an auspicious opportunity, and she was no fool.</p>
<p>“Then I shall accompany you.” Sun Wen smiled and walked briskly, holding Ye Zhen’s arm. “Isn’t Huang Fuxiang envious of you? She looked at you just now like she couldn’t wait to eat you.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t even do anything to her. When will she see me pleasing to the eye?” The corners of Ye Zhen’s mouth lifted into a shallow smile.</p>
<p>“Then better be careful, so as to avoid incidents like the last time.” Sun Wen, like a good friend, advised.</p>
<p>“Mmm.” Came the reply. “One who always does harm to others will one day harm oneself.” Ye Zhen added.</p>
<p>There was no one in the medicinal field except for the two or three attendants applying fertilizer and pulling weeds. By now they were used to the pretty girl’s visit to the field. As such, they continued with their work not minding her at all.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen quietly read the description, looking for the herbs mentioned in the book. Before she knew it, two hours had already passed. Seeing that their free time was almost over, she and Sun Wen returned to class.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Archery was one of the subjects she’s good at. She had taken it before. She was meticulously taught by her father in her previous life and Lu Yaoyao was skilled in it as well. Together, she made an impressive combination in this field.</p>
<p>An instructor surnamed Tu was assigned to teach them. After explaining the rules of archery, he directed them to choose their own bow and arrow for practice.</p>
<p>Gathering their respective bows and arrows, the girls then headed towards the target area.</p>
<p>As Ye Zhen was getting ready to shoot, a sharp arrow was launched from behind her.</p>
<p><strong>Wishing you a very happy new year everyone! </strong></p>
