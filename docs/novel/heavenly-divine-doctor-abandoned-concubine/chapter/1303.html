            <h3>Chapter 24- Flower Appreciation Meet (2)</h3>
<p>Ye Zhen looked through the carriage curtain to see the scenery outside. She basked in nostalgia as she thought of the place they arrived at, for she had grown up here and was familiar with the capital’s every nook and cranny.</p>
<p>But now, she looked at it through a stranger’s eyes and even detachment.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen was about to pull down the curtain, the carriage suddenly halted, and yet, despite this abrupt motion, she still noticed that a hill in the distance seemed a little strange.</p>
<p>She frowned as she looked at it.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t that mountain called the “Dead Mountain” feel sinister? In fact, the Ye Family has been recently buried there, hundreds of people from their clan rest there, executed in their own home I heard!” Lu Fang explained after seeing Ye Zhen staring at the hill.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s face faltered as she grabbed the curtain and tightened her grip on it. She struggled to find her voice, before speaking. “The Ye Family… are they all dead?”</p>
<p>“Who knows!” said Lu Fang “Only Eldest Brother knows of it. We only heard a little about their deaths.”</p>
<p>“The Ye Family deserved to die for all the evils they have done.” Lu Jing said with a snort. “Who would really sympathize with them even if they are all dead?” She added.</p>
<p>“What kind of things did the Ye Family do to make you feel that so many of them deserved to die? I don’t think you’ll be so kind and noble in the future with a heart like that.” Ye Zhen told her while keeping her voice from sounding strained.</p>
<p>Lu Jing was ready to pounce on Ye Zhen at any moment, but she controlled herself. Gritting her teeth she said, “What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“You know exactly what it means,” said Ye Zhen coldly. It’s the first time she had shown her true emotions since she was reborn.</p>
<p>“You…” Lu Jing was about to charge at Ye Zhen but was held back by her sister.</p>
<p>“We have arrived at the Baihua Gardens!” Lu Fang said hurriedly and urged Lu Jing to calm down.</p>
<p>“Third Sister here doesn’t know what the Ye Family has done to our family.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t see the point in arguing further. Moreover, she was afraid that she would do something that she would later regret.</p>
<p>She was not hot-tempered, for as a wang fei, she was taught to be reserved and demure. But hearing someone say such awful things about her deceased family, she felt like she could easily lose control of her emotions.</p>
<p>At the moment the carriage stopped, she immediately lifted the curtains and hurriedly dismounted the ride.</p>
<p></p><center><sup>Chapter By WordExcerpt</sup></center><p></p>
<div data-fuse="22037344116" data-fuse-code="fuse-slot-22037344116-1" data-fuse-slot="71161633/WORD_wordexcerpt/chapter_incontent_2">
<div id="fuse-slot-22037344116-1" class="fuse-slot"></div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Old Madam Lu and Teacher Shan also got off their carriage. Ye Zhen walked over to them, pressing her palms against her heart earnestly and willing herself to appear calm, and hide her true emotions. As she did this, she greeted the two with a smile.</p>
<p>In autumn, the blue sky was clear, glittering, and vivid. When one walked into the Baihua Garden, one could see the white clouds reflected in the middle of the artificial lake which flowed from a lake not far from it.</p>
<p>The lake had fishes swimming in to and fro, adding to the color of the clouds reflected on it, making it look like a painting.</p>
<p>After passing the artificial lake, Ye Zhen saw a well-dressed woman coming towards them.</p>
<p>“I offer you my humble greetings, Old Madam Lu! Everyone has been waiting for your arrival.” The woman greeted Old Madam Lu affectionately.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at the woman and gave her a faint smile. The woman’s surname was Chen. She is the wife of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Rites#:~:text=The%20Ministry%20or%20Board%20of,examination%20and%20China's%20foreign%20relations.">Ministry of Rites</a>’ assistant minister. She used to curry favor with the Ye Family, and once despised the Lu Family but today, she was fawning over Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>“And this is… Teacher Shan?” Madam Chen at first, had mistaken Teacher Shan, who was standing beside Old Madam Lu, as one of her granddaughters! But upon closer inspection, she realized that the woman turned out to be the famous teacher in the country.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan nodded lightly at the recognition. “Madam Chen.” She greeted.</p>
<p>Madam Chen was befuddled by her presence.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu laughed lightly before stating. “Teacher Shan here is the teacher of our dear Lu Yaoyao. I’m sure you haven’t met each other before.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shyly smiled and gave Madam Chen a deep bow, “Greetings Madam Chen.”</p>
<p>Lu Jing and Lu Fang who were standing behind Ye Zhen looked at her with envy in their eyes. For today it was obvious that Old Madam Lu was going to let everyone know who Ye Zhen was, which would make her seem like the most important character among them three!</p>
<p><i>But why?</i> <i>Why was such a wild girl given such importance by Old Madam? Was it because she was Teacher Shan’s student?</i> They wondered.</p>
<p>Madam Chen had barely seen the late wang fei before and had only a slight impression of her. So when she saw Lu Yaoyao, she only felt familiarity but was not reminded of Ye Zhen at all.</p>
<p>“All the Lu girls are really beautiful. How lucky you are, Old Madam Lu.”</p>
