            <p><strong>Chapter 526 – Venting Anger </strong></p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at Zhao Mingxiao coldly. He had a hundred reasons to kill this man in front of him, but there was only one reason why he would not do anything. This man was already Mu Qing’s husband. If he killed Zhao Mingxiao, Mu Qing would probably be very sad.</p>
<p>“There’s no purpose,” Huangfu Chen said and as Zhao Mingxiao was about to say more, he had already turned around. “A person’s mask cannot last forever. I hope you don’t have a day of betrayal,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao narrowed his eyes and looked at Huangfu Chen’s tall figure. Killing intent flashed through his eyes, but he quickly suppressed his emotions.</p>
<p>He returned to his room and saw Mu Qing standing by the window, looking at him anxiously.</p>
<p>“Why are you standing by the window? Come and sit down?” Zhao Ming Xiao concealed the coldness in his eyes and looked at her with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>Mu Qing walked up to him and poured him a cup of tea from the teapot on the table. “I was waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been a little busy these few days. You don’t have to wait up for me at night,” Zhao Mingxiao whispered and took the teacup from Mu Qing’s hand. “I’ve asked Ye Shi to find a doctor for you. You don’t have to worry about having a baby.”</p>
<p>“Xiaoxiao, why don’t you…” Mu Qing bit her lip and hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Why don’t you take a few more concubines? I’m afraid I can’t pass on the lineage for you.”</p>
<p>A gloomy expression flashed across Zhao Mingxiao’s face. “Do you want me to take a concubine?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t given birth to a son or a daughter for you in all these years. Even if you don’t mind, the old island master would not be happy. He definitely hoped that by now you should have children.” Mu Qing said and lowered her head.</p>
<p>“Father left Zhao Jia Island long ago. No one knows where he went. If he cared about me having children earlier, he wouldn’t have left ten years ago.” Zhao Mingxiao’s tone indicated he was disappointed and dissatisfied with his father.</p>
<p>Mu Qing knew that Zhao Mingxiao didn’t like the old island master because he thought that the old island master was biased towards Zhao Tianji. He didn’t pass the title of island master to him, but to his younger brother. She sighed in her heart. “But what if I never have children?”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao waved his hand away. “You never cared about this before. Is it because of Huangfu Chen?”</p>
<p>“What does this have to do with Huangfu Chen?” Mu Qing looked up at Zhao Mingxiao in surprise, not understanding why he suddenly mentioned Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to persuade me to take a concubine. Even if you don’t have anything to do, I won’t divorce you. In this lifetime, you can only be my wife,” Zhao Mingxiao said coldly.</p>
<p>Mu Qing’s face turned pale. She opened her mouth and said after a while, “I’ve never thought about this… Since I’m already married to you, why would I think about other men?”</p>
<p>“Then don’t go to see Huangfu Chen. I don’t like you going to see him,” Zhao Ming Xiao said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“I understand.” Mu Qing forced a smile.</p>
<p>She had never thought that she would see Huangfu Chen again. The moment she married Zhao Mingxiao, she didn’t think about anything else. Now that the misunderstanding between her and Huangfu Chen had been explained clearly, the knot in her heart had been untied. She only wanted to be together with her husband in the future, but she didn’t expect him to misunderstand.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao looked at her depressed expression and thought that she was still thinking about Huangfu Chen. Thinking of what Huangfu Chen had just threatened him with, he felt a surge of anger in his heart. He reached out to hug Mu Qing and forcefully kissed her. Ignoring her wishes, he pressed her against the soft couch by the window and took her forcefully, venting all his anger on Mu Qing.</p>
<p>Mu Qing struggled to resist and could only endure the discomfort and humiliation. She did not even dare to cry.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Ever since Zhao Tianji couldn’t walk, Zhao Mingxiao had been in charge of all the affairs on Zhao Jia Island. Zhao Jia Island was divided into eight areas, each with an elder in charge. Every month, these eight elders had to meet with the Island Lord once.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji hadn’t seen those eight elders for many years. He had thought that the Island Lord’s words would still get everyone on the island to comply, but it seemed that some things were different.</p>
<p>“Liang Yin, are you sure you told all the elders that you wanted them to come and see me today?” Zhao Tianji calmly asked Liang Yin, looking at the empty hall with an indescribably cold tone.</p>
<p>“Island Lord, this subordinate has already passed your orders to all the elders,” Liang Yin spoke in a low voice, but he felt angry in his heart. <em>What was going on with those elders? They actually didn’t come to see the Island Lord. They simply</em> <em>didn’t take the Island Lord seriously.</em></p>
<p>Zhao Tianji sneered, “It seems that in just a few years, Zhao Jia Island has really grown a lot.”</p>
<p>“Island Lord, this subordinate will look for them.” Liang Yin said.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. They won’t come,” Zhao Tianji said indifferently. “This island is no longer the former Zhao Jia island. They won’t listen to me.”</p>
<p>Liang Yin said in surprise, “You’re the Island Lord, how dare they not listen to you?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji looked indifferently at the direction outside the hall. “In their hearts, I’m probably no longer the Island Lord.”</p>
<p>“Island Lord…” Liang Yin’s heart skipped a beat, and he suddenly turned to look. A handsome and tall figure was slowly walking over. It was Zhao Mingxiao. “It’s the eldest young master.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zhao Tianji replied indifferently and looked at Zhao Mingxiao coldly.</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao slowly walked into the hall and looked at Zhao Tianji with a smile. “Ah Ji, I heard that you want to meet a few elders. It just so happens that there’s something very important today. None of them are on the island.”</p>
<p>“Brother, is there anything of great importance that I shouldn’t know?” Zhao Tianji looked coldly at Zhao Mingxiao. The eight elders had other important matters to attend to. Could it be that his return as the Island Lord was not an important affair?</p>
<p>“Ah Ji, the current Zhao Jia Island is no longer the same as before. Do you see, we are like a country here…” Zhao Mingxiao said with a smile.</p>
<p>But he was interrupted before he could finish his sentence.</p>
<p>“Could it be that Eldest Brother wants to turn the Zhao Jia Island into the State of Zhao?” Zhao Tianji smiled coldly and interrupted. “The weapon you created earlier is not what you said it is. It’s to give Zhao Jia Island weapons that can withstand foreign enemies.”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao said in a low voice, “Every country has its own weapons and armies. For the sake of Zhao Jia Island, for the sake of our ancestors’ teachings, we will turn Zhao Jia Island into the State of Zhao.”</p>
<p>“And then?” Zhao Tianji asked indifferently, “Eldest brother, who would become the emperor between us after becoming the State of Zhao?”</p>
<p>“Ah Ji, you’ve been away from Zhao Jia Island all these years. You like to be free and unrestrained, you’re not suitable to be the ruler of a country,” Zhao Mingxiao said.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji smiled faintly. “That’s why my eldest brother’s status on the island is more important than mine.”</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t been weak since I was a child, I wouldn’t have allowed you to replace me as Island Lord. Now that your legs are inconvenient, I’ll handle everything on this island in the future.” Zhao Mingxiao patted Zhao Tianji’s shoulder. Despite his mild tone, there was an undeniable domineering undertone.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji shook his head and chuckled. “Eldest Brother, are the Eight Elders still the original people?”</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxiao’s face darkened.”Ah Ji, what are you trying to say?”</p>
<p>“Let me see the Eight Elders first. If they are willing to listen to you and think that you are the Island Lord, then I would not interfere in the matters of this island in the future.” Zhao Tianji smiled faintly.</p>
