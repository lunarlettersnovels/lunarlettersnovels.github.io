            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 325 – Learning Divination (2)</strong></p>
<p>When he had become a divination master at age fifteen, his first divination had been for a pair of twin sisters. At that time, the divination signs had been extremely bad. The twins were natural disasters for one another. One was a tragic beauty, the other incomparably noble. If the two lived together, they would undoubtedly end in tragedy.</p>
<p>At that time, he had yet to learn the art of keeping secrets, as such, his naïve self had revealed it all to the old madam of the Ye Family. Later, one of the sisters had been sent away. He had felt apologetic towards them and was even warier that his early calculations could have been wrong. So, thereon, he had always paid attention to them. However, reality had proved him correct.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was the tragic beauty and Lu Yaoyao clearly incomparably noble. But he remembered they had both indicated short fates. That said, as of today, he could no longer calculate Lu Yaoyao’s fate.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen quietly calculated Ye Zhen’s horoscope. When he finished, he was silent for a long time. <em>This… was clearly Ye Zhen’s horoscope. But why was it so odd?</em></p>
<p>“Mister Chen?” Seeing him staring at the horoscope silently, she was a little anxious. <em>Has he figured something out?</em></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, this shouldn’t be your horoscope,” Huangfu Chen said quietly. “This horoscope should belong to an incomparably noble person. Unfortunately, their fortune is not the best, and they are already dead.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was taken aback, she looked at Huangfu Chen with surprise. She was totally in awe of him. In the past, she hadn’t thought that divination was something that was accurate. But as of today, it was clear that it could show many things.</p>
<p>“Did I forget?” Ye Zhen feigned surprise as she looked at her horoscope. “Oh, I wrote the wrong time.”</p>
<p>When Huangfu Chen saw her write her own horoscope, he lightly smiled, but his divination results were still the same as before.</p>
<p>“There’s no hexagram…” Huanfu Chen furrowed his brows. “Yaoyao, I can’t calculate your hexagram.”</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p><em>Couldn’t calculate her hexagram?</em></p>
<p><em>What does that mean?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Huangfu Chen with perplexion as she asked, “Teacher, why are you unable to calculate my hexagram?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it is because your fate has changed, or… because I am not good enough at my craft.”</p>
<p><em>Her fate has changed?</em> Ye Zhen’s face grew slightly pale. <em>Had this happened because she was reborn into her twin sister’s body?</em></p>
<p>“You don’t need to worry. There are some people that are just like this. It isn’t something bad.” Seeing that Ye Zhen didn’t look very well, Huangfu Chen smiled and comforted her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen forced a smile in response.</p>
<p>He said nothing else, boiled two cups of tea and handed her a cup. “Yaoyao, do you have any blood sisters?”</p>
<p>“Hmmm?” Ye Zhen was taken aback.</p>
<p>“Although there is no hexagram on your horoscope, by the looks of it, you should have a sister,” Huangfu Chen said softly. He felt that Lu Yaoyao hadn’t written the wrong horoscope by accident. She had purposefully written out Ye Zhen’s horoscope for him to see.</p>
<p><em>She knew of her own lineage! Who had told her? Even Lian Danshi didn’t know about Lu Yaoyao’s lineage. Who else would know?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen wanted to say that she had a sister. However, in the end, she just smiled and shook her head. “I don’t think I do.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled lightly and didn’t continue on the matter.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the sunlight was bright and warm. Ye Zhen bid farewell to Huangfu Chen and told the coachman to bring her to Qianjin.</p>
<p>There were some benefits to becoming a princess. The empress dowager had bestowed her eight servants, four maids, two court ladies, and a pair of eunuchs. From now on, they would be hers, and would receive pay directly from her. In the future, she probably wouldn’t be able to go everywhere alone, she would need to bring a servant with her.</p>
<p>When they arrived, the manager who was already familiar with her brought her up to a room in the second floor without any extra words. Before long, Hong Ling appeared.</p>
<p>“Miss.” Hong Ling bowed. “I have some good news for you.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and asked, “What is it?”</p>
<p>“Uncle Man answered in a letter not long after he returned to Jinkou City. He said that he had already gotten in touch with the Lu Family’s manager,” Hong Ling whispered.</p>
<p>This was a pretty good start. However, it was too slow to start their plans on a small manager. It would take forever to collapse the Lu Family business. “I have a letter here. Send someone to bring it to Uncle Man.”</p>
<p>She had made careful notes about Lu Shixun’s temperament and what she had understood about the most recent events of the Lu Family business and hoped that he would be able to find a way to deal with the second master of the household.</p>
