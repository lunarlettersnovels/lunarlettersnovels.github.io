            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 8 – Recognition (1)</strong></p>
<p>Despite their sudden fame, it still couldn’t be denied that the Lu Family was no different from the common folks before. Nothing but a small family of merchants, no titles and such, who somehow prospered by establishing ties with the palace – the emperor to be specific. Although Lu Lingzhi was lowborn, he was as handsome as he was brave and militant. Outstanding in his work as a general under Mo Rongzhan’s command, he proved himself useful, a utilitarian in siege tactics.</p>
<p>Therefore, as soon as Mo Rongzhan claimed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Throne#:~:text=The%20Dragon%20Throne%20(simplified%20Chinese,of%20the%20Emperor%20of%20China.&amp;text=Metonymically%2C%20%22the%20Dragon%20Throne%22,as%20%22the%20divine%20utensil.%22">Dragon Throne</a> for his own, he handed the position to Lu Lingzhi on a silver platter. An assistant war minister was a high position and an even higher position for a commoner, which may seem ridiculous to many.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming was his uncle. Lu Lingzhi’s father pivoted the third generation of heirs in the family who chose not to inherit the family business and became officials. Now the business of the Lu Family was handed over to Lu Erzhi, his other uncle. His father had passed away, leaving only two sons and a daughter.</p>
<p>The most senior person in the Lu Family was Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had a simple understanding of the relationship between her family and the Lu Family. She was not even truly integrated with the ladies of the family including Lu Wushuang, who had become the imperial concubine, the one who took her place. And most of all, the name of the old madam nor her reputation had ever crossed her awareness before.</p>
<p>“Grandmother is strict, but her heart is the kindest! Don’t be timid when you meet her and Eldest Brother as well.” Lu Xiangzhi comforted Ye Zhen in a garrulous way.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen just smiled, nodded, and spoke no more. She knew better than anyone how gentle Lu Lingzhi looked, but it was precisely people like him who should be feared. A vile creature behind a beautiful mask indeed.</p>
<p>After two years of acquaintance with him, she really believed that he was gentle and credible as he appeared to be. Helplessly gullible, she treated him like a big brother, not knowing how despicable and shameless he truly was inside. She wished she could drink his blood oozing from his lacerations she herself would want to inflict!</p>
<p>Their conversation took a longer course with Ye Zhen answering timidly all the way. Lu Xiangzhi reflected on how his sister seemed to be a different person. How a chatterbox had turned mute from everything. He turned to look at his sister’s emaciated side face.</p>
<p>When she was in the border town, the climate was much warmer than in the capital. Her love for outdoor activities had tanned her, yet now, she looked significantly pale. Her cheeks lost their ruddy colors, she had become more poised and womanlier. It perturbed Lu Lingzhi to witness how his sister’s days of confinement in the mansion had morphed her into an entirely different person. Although her appearance would still not pass as a prim lady of the capital, she no longer looked like the wild girl he knew.</p>
<p>However, this change was not only physical. Her black and witty eyes seemed to be a little sharper than usual, like a hawk’s keen gaze. Moreover, when she felt he was not looking, her lips were pinched like she found everything distasteful.</p>
<p><i>Probably because of nervousness!</i> Lu Xiangzhi surmised.</p>
<p>He faced his sister and smiled as if her sudden change was brought about only by the new environment. It was her first time settling in Kyoto after all!</p>
<p>“Relax. Grandma is not as strict and harsh as some old madams. Just keep in mind the usual rules.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi’s placating was returned by Ye Zhen’s acquiescing but taut smile. In her heart, she thought about how this family had risen through the blood of innocents. After all, the Lu Family was not a famous family but a lineage of incompetent businessmen.</p>
<p><i>Rules? What rules are there to follow? This family doesn’t know the rules! All they know is to step on others to make their way to the top.</i></p>
<p>She now felt a deep resentment towards the Lu Family. If it were not for her revenge and Lu Shiming and his wife’s sincere love for her twin sister, she would have never considered staying here for long.</p>
<p>Making herself as presentable as possible, Ye Zhen left her room to meet Old Madam Lu.</p>
