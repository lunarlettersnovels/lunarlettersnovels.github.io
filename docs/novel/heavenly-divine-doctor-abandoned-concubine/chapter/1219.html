            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 108 – Seeking An Audience (2)</h3>
<p>The Xu Mansion was not far from Lu Family’s. Initially, the Lu Family had no mansion built in this neighborhood. Naturally, the families surrounding them were rich and noble. Although the Lu Family had silvers before, as they were merchants, they could not buy a large house in this area at all without the help of the emperor.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour, they had arrived at the Xu Family’s humble abode.</p>
<p>When the doorman heard of their arrival, he did not invite them in immediately but asked them to wait a moment before turning around to inform Xu Lao, the master of the house.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi whispered to Lu Lingzhi. “Eldest Brother, this Lord Xu hates giving audience, I heard. Will he see us?”</p>
<p>“Lord Xu is eccentric. Even if he does not see us today, we can ask for another visit,” Lu Lingzhi said with a reassuring smile.</p>
<p>However, Lu Xiangzhi did not think so. He felt that the man wouldn’t entertain them. Anyway, he didn’t expect to be a student of Xu Lao.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked up at them. She didn’t think Lu Lingzhi really wanted to take Lu Xiangzhi to visit Xu Lao to be his teacher. The old-timer was a very stubborn person and always looked down on people.</p>
<p>From the moment she had died at his hands, Ye Zhen came to recognize what type of person Lu Lingzhi was. He didn’t come here just for the benefit of Lu Xiangzhi. He came with a motive; she was sure of this.</p>
<p>As a loyal subordinate of the emperor, Lu Lingzhi came to find Xu Lao presumably to persuade him to return to the imperial court.</p>
<p>What Mo Rongzhan lacked most was a great scholar like Xu Lao, who could be respected by scholars all over the world. If this man became his minister, it would be easier for Mo Rongzhan to widen his scope of power if he desired so.</p>
<p>She remembered from her memory when she was a confined spirit in the palace that Lu Lingzhi had succeeded in making Xu Lao return to the imperial court, therefore gaining the ultimate trust of the emperor.</p>
<p>However, that should be a year from now, not the time being.</p>
<p>Before long, the doorman came out and said politely that the old man was entertaining other guests as of the moment. Come back another day, he told them.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was somewhat disappointed. Although he had already known this would happen, Xu Lao really did not give him face.</p>
<p>At his side, Lu Xiangzhi looked mournful as well. The boy really had such a sensitive heart.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at the doorman and suddenly said with a charming voice, “Sir, please tell Lord Xu that we are here to break his board game, not to ask him for anything else.”</p>
<p>The doorman was visibly stunned. “Please wait a moment, Miss.”</p>
<p>After he left, Lu Lingzhi looked at Ye Zhen curiously. “How do you know about Lord Xu’s board game?”</p>
<p><i>Even he didn’t know about this. How did Yaoyao know?</i></p>
<p>“I certainly have a way to know.” Ye Zhen snorted proudly.</p>
<p>In the beginning, her father won against Xu Lao in a board game. As a result, Xu Lao thought for two years about how to break her father’s strategies and defense method.</p>
<p>Now that her father was gone, Xu Lao would probably want to find a solution.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi gave her a flick on the forehead. “Teacher Shan must have told you. What if you can’t win against Lord Xu in the board game later?”</p>
<p>“I said I was here to break his board game, but I didn’t say I could definitely break it.” Ye Zhen pouted while rubbing her forehead.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi chuckled and looked at Ye Zhen gently. “Third Sister is very clever to think of this excuse.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am brilliant.” Ye Zhen looked at him and answered.</p>
<p>At this moment, the doorman came out again and asked Ye Zhen to enter.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was surprised to find that Xu Lao would really see them.</p>
<p><i>It seemed that Teacher Shan really knew a lot. </i></p>
