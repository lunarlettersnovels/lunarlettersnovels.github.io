            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 214 – A Prestigious Offer</strong></p>
<p>Cining Palace</p>
<p>The empress dowager could be seen browsing through the Xiunu album, intent on picking some gentle and elegant ladies for her son, Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“This official’s daughter greets the empress dowager. Ten thousand blessings to Her Highness.” Ye Zhen curtsied as she came in.</p>
<p>However, she was taken aback at the sight of the Xiunu albums atop the table. <i>Did she walk in at a wrong time? But she was brought here! </i></p>
<p>The empress dowager revealed a smile as she affectionately beckoned her. “Yaoyao, come here.”</p>
<p>And Ye Zhen went to the empress dowager’s side.</p>
<p>“Aijia knows about last night.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager looked at her pitifully. As someone who had lived in the palace for many years, she learned to not trust everything that reached her ears. It was true that she herself had doubted Lu Yaoyao’s motives, and even thought that the young miss was after the emperor. However, she had a discerning eye and as soon saw her sincere concern for the little prince, she was quick to realize that the child before her had no such thoughts.</p>
<p>Gazing up at her, Lu Yaoyao’s eyes looked so clear that one could seemingly see her thoughts at a single glance. If she indeed had the slightest desire to covet the emperor, she did not need to go through the ordeal. With her looks, emperor or not, no man would refuse.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, this official’s daughter was negligent and has erred.” Ye Zhen instantly knelt and kowtowed to acknowledge her mistake.</p>
<p>“You are not to be blamed. After all, those medicated meals were not made for the emperor.” The empress dowager comforted her with a smile and added. “Aijia thinks you have done a great service to this palace.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen immediately understood that the empress dowager was alluding to the incident involving the emperor’s eyes. Left to her, she would never have committed such a blunder–letting Mo Rongzhan consume her medicated meals! But what choice did she have? She was powerless before the obstinate, childish emperor who had set his eyes on his brother’s food.</p>
<p><i>Argh!</i></p>
<p>“This official’s daughter is grateful to Her Highness and His Majesty for not blaming her. One dares not take credit for oneself.” Ye Zhen respectfully replied.</p>
<p>This put yet another smile on the dowager’s face. “Yaoyao, how would it be if Aijia bestows you the title of ‘Princess of a Commandery’?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her head and looked at the empress dowager in surprise. For a moment, she didn’t know how to respond.</p>
<p>“Your Highness … this… official’s daughter must not be bestowed a reward undeserving of her.”</p>
<p>If she had the title of a princess, would it be easier to get revenge? However, once Lu Wushuang regained her footing in the future, she would be more vigilant and never show her any mercy.</p>
<p><i>Princess… there will surely be advantages and disadvantages!</i></p>
<p>“How could you be undeserving when you have rendered a meritorious service? Without you, Little Prince’s illness would have not alleviated for Imperial Physician Qi’s medicines were of not much use.”</p>
<p>“But the little prince has already given me 40, 000 taels of silvers.” Ye Zhen reasoned. At no cost did she want this title.</p>
<p>Also, although her <i>lingquan</i> may be worth more than 40,000 taels of silver, she didn’t want to take any credit for treating Mo Rongyi. She just wanted to repay the empress dowager for the kindness she had once shown her.</p>
<p>A wise mother laughed. She remembered that wager; despite its silliness, the ruse had worked like a charm. She had even marveled at the little girl’s ingenuity at that time.</p>
<p>“He deserved to lose the 40,000 taels of silver. This is exactly what Aijia wants!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled bashfully. She took a moment before voicing her concern.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, if one is a princess… will one still be able to enter the palace as a physician?”</p>
<p>“You want to be a physician?” The dowager slightly frowned. “The status of an imperial physician is not comparable to that of a princess.”</p>
<p>She did not know why this little girl would be hesitant to embrace a prestigious opportunity. Being raised from the status of a commoner to that of a royalty, how many had the good fortune?!</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was in a dilemma.</p>
<p><i>If I accept this title, I will have to live in the palace. But how can I avenge myself if I do not reside in the palace?</i></p>
<p>Even so…</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I’d better not be a princess. I hope to become a physician in the future so that everything that I have learned or will learn can be put to practice.” Ye Zhen’s explained in a carefully feigned na<b>ï</b>ve tone.</p>
<p>The empress dowager laughed and rebuked her good-naturedly. “What a silly child! Say, why do you want to be a physician?”</p>
<p>“To prove that the general perception of women’s incompetence is erroneous. Women can do what men can.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen dared to speak her mind, her small face wreathed with a red tinge of nervousness as she gazed at the empress dowager who could be unhappy upon hearing such words.</p>
<p>The empress dowager was taken aback by the little girl’s courage and sagacity. She was young and childlike, yet she fostered such profound thoughts. She paused, gazed at her for a while, then smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>“Very well. Aijia will be looking forward to the miss entering the palace and becoming an imperial physician.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s countenance was girdled with a smile. “Thank you very much, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Although the title of royalty would make her status more honorable, what she needed now was not an honorable identity, but one that would allow her to go about things conveniently.</p>
<p>She wanted the Lu Family, who rose by stepping on the corpses of the innocents, to collapse; and for Mo Rongzhan to lose everything that he possessed. These were not the things that could be accomplished by dignitaries. How could she avenge relying on her strength alone?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had yet to figure out a more convenient method. She could only take one step at a time. Perhaps, an opportunity would arise in the future.</p>
<p>As of now, Lu Wushuang had lost Mo Rongzhan’s trust. Even if she regained the favor, it would never be the same as before.</p>
<p>When something breaks, it can never be whole again no matter how adeptly it is mended.</p>
