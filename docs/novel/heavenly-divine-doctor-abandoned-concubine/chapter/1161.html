            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 166 – She Is Not That Kind Of Person</strong></p>
<p>“Lingzhi, I heard that the emperor has allowed you to lead the troops to suppress the rebels?” Lu Shiming suddenly asked Lu Lingzhi, temporarily pulling him from his train of thought.</p>
<p>“We will leave in three days.”</p>
<p>“How are your legs?” Anxiously, Old Madam Lu inquired of him, her displeasure from the palace suddenly turning into a worry for his grandson.</p>
<p>In the corner, Ye Zhen’s eyes glinted with interest when she heard this information.</p>
<p>Before, she could not wait for Lu Lingzhi to be sent off to the battlefield, but today, after her recent encounter with Lu Wushuang, she wished that Lu Lingzhi would not go so soon. He could be her instrument against his beloved sister.</p>
<p>From her knowledge of Lu Wushuang’s cunningness, Ye Zhen knew that the wang fei was already orchestrating plans to ruin her.</p>
<p>“It’s much better, and besides, I can continue recovering while traveling towards the rebel’s dominion. It does not bother me at all.”</p>
<p>He stood up and took a few steps to show them that his leg injury had indeed gotten much better.</p>
<p>In spite of this, Old Madam Lu was still worried. “Our family does not need military exploits now, what is important is everyone’s health.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I have my limits.” Lu Lingzhi assured her.</p>
<p>Seeing her grandson firm about his decision, the old madam stopped her insistence and no longer continued the talk of the war. Instead, to enliven the mood, she diverted everyone’s attention to Ye Zhen with a smile full of pride.</p>
<p>“The empress dowager likes our Yaoyao very much. In fact, she wants her to revisit the palace!”</p>
<p>Pei Shi embraced her daughter lovingly and glanced at Lu Shiming, who also had a proud look. There are no parents who dislike others praising their children.</p>
<p>“Mother, did not Yaoyao say anything wrong in the palace today? This child acts mischievous most of the time.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu laughed. “Yaoyao is very good, which made the empress dowager adore her.”</p>
<p><i>Has there really been nothing wrong with their visit? Then where did the palm print on Ye Zhen’s face come from?</i> Lu Lingzhi wondered, and at the same time, had decided to talk with his grandmother when everyone retired.</p>
<p>“It’s still thanks to Mother’s guidance. Otherwise, I could not trust Yaoyao to enter the palace alone, afraid she would say something wrong—or be wronged.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing the word “wronged,” Old Madam Lu could not help but laugh awkwardly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<div data-fuse="22037344116" data-fuse-code="fuse-slot-22037344116-1" data-fuse-slot="71161633/WORD_wordexcerpt/chapter_incontent_2"></div>
<p>After the dinner, Lu Lingzhi stayed to talk with the old madam.</p>
<p>“Have you decided to go to war? You have already done so much for the emperor. Risking your life can never be repaid by his entire riches.”</p>
<p>At the moment, no one else but the two of them were around, so Old Madam Lu displayed no further scruples when talking to her grandson.</p>
<p>“Although I am already an assistant war minister, there are still many people who despise our family.”</p>
<p>The madam’s face turned grim; she knew he was not entirely telling the truth.</p>
<p>“Did you decide to do this just for Shuang’er<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1">[mfn]Lu Wushuang’s nickname is Shuang’er, in which “-er” designates their endearment for the wang fei.[/mfn]</sup> to have more peace of mind in the palace?” she asked in a somewhat constricted voice.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I admit, that is also one of the reasons. Although Shuang’er is now the wang fei, the emperor will soon appoint other concubines. If those new concubines’ standing is higher than Shuang’er, her life in the palace will not be so easy anymore.”</p>
<p>He had only one sister. Who else would he risk his life for?</p>
<p>As long as Lu Lingzhi was breathing, he would do everything to uplift the status of the Lu Family in the society, and thus, securing his sister’s position and happiness inside the imperial palace.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu sighed. “I know you have already done so much for everyone in this family, but Shuang’er’s character is not suitable for the palace…”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, did something bad happen in the palace today?” Lu Lingzhi directly asked the question that had been putting his mind into shambles for a while now.</p>
<p>At first, Old Madam Lu hesitated to speak, but could not stop herself from spilling what she had planned to keep to herself.</p>
<p>“Have not you seen Yaoyao’s swollen face? If it were not for the snow lotus ointment given by the empress dowager, how could she ever dare come out and meet people at this moment? Shuang’er could not even be considerate of her cousin. If the emperor welcomed other concubines, do you think she would get along with them peacefully? Besides, the emperor will have an empress in the future… I am anxious about Shuang’er.” Old Madam Lu finished with a sigh.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Lu Lingzhi’s brows knitted. “How did Yaoyao come across the emperor so coincidentally?”</p>
<p>“Lingzhi, what do you mean by that? Do you think it is Yaoyao who sought the emperor on purpose? Is that how you see her? The palace is vast. How could a young miss, who stepped inside the palace for the first time, know where and when the emperor would be at that particular time?”</p>
<p>His question sounded accusatory, the old madam felt troubled, out of pity towards her innocent granddaughter.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao is not that kind of person.”</p>
