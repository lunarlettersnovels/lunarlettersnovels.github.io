            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 181- The Little Prince’s Wish (1)</strong></p>
<p>Previously, Ye Zhen had met Eldest Madam Lu. And one of those occasions was the not so pleasant family dinner that had laid a few matters and scars bare. Thus, she was aware of the deep resentment this Eldest Madam Lu held towards the Third Household. If not for a very important matter, she would never deign to visit Pei Shi.</p>
<p>One thing had to be said about Madam Lu. She feared no one, coming and going as she pleased. The family dinner was plenty proof, and yet, she had feigned illness. And for this long.</p>
<p><i>What is she hiding up her sleeve?</i> <i>Such an uncanny coincidence, here Lu Lingzhi sets off on an expedition, there Madam Lu suddenly graces the family with her presence. </i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen was inclined to think that this abrupt turn of events were not as incidental as they appeared to be.  She had a hunch, Lu Wushuang would have a hand in this somehow.</p>
<p><i>Why did Madam Lu suddenly have a change of heart? Why take over the familial duties now? And most of all, why inquire about me?</i></p>
<p><i>What is she trying to do?</i></p>
<p>Up until now, Lu Jing had been intently eyeing Ye Zhen. Seeing as there was no change in her expression, she continued.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, what do you think Eldest Madam Lu asked Third Aunt about?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled lightly. “How would I know, Fourth Sister, I have been away from home these two days.”</p>
<p><i>It had only been two days. Did Lu Wushuang have a word with her mother?</i></p>
<p>“I heard that Eldest Madam Lu told Grandmother that she was ready to take over the management of the family.” Lu Jing looked askance, her cheeks a little flushed.</p>
<p><i>Ready to manage the family? Certainly, this has something to do with marriage.</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s smile was a bit cold. No one knew better than her of Lu Wushuang’s methods. When Lu Lingzhi could not help her, she had to find someone else. Who in the Lu Family would be at her mercy now? Naturally, if there was one person she would ask for help, it had to be her mother.</p>
<p>“Fourth Sister, Eldest Madam Lu has been ill for so long. How can Grandmother let her work so suddenly?” Ye Zhen glanced at Lu Jing and faintly smiled.</p>
<p>“Besides, I believe that the position must be yours. Would you like to go home and have a look?” asked Lu Jing.</p>
<p>If Madam Lu presided over the family, the first to suffer would be the Third Household. Eldest Madam Lu detested Lu Yaoyao’s family.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said quietly, “Fourth Sister, thank you for telling me, but this is not a matter of urgency and there is no need for me to go back.”</p>
<p>Lu Jing took a careful look at Ye Zhen. She looked unfazed, contrary to her expectations and wishes. A little vexed, she said, “It seems that everything I said is nothing to you, so I should not have bothered to come here and tell you.”</p>
<p>“That was not what I meant.” Ye Zhen denied with a smile but added. “I know what my Fourth Sister wants.”</p>
<p>Lu Jing snorted coldly. She had made this trip especially to tell Lu Yaoyao about these goings on. As expected of someone with ill-will, she had appeared in sheep’s skin–flashing her kindest smile, speaking the sincerest words, as if she were indeed concerned. All she wished was for Lu Yaoyao to return to the mansion and kick up a row. And in the process, offend the Eldest Madam. Needless to say, this would spoil her reputation within the family. The idea was indeed great, alas, the bait was not taken.</p>
<p>“In that case, I must go back first.” Lu Jing stood up and walked to the door. But before her figure completely disappeared, she halted in her steps and glanced back at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>With a sneer, she said, “Since one is already here, one will take the opportunity to advise Third Sister. Do not make enemies here in the academy. You cannot afford to provoke anyone. Do not think you can reap any benefits by playing with fire.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen still smiled calmly. “I see. Thank you for the kind reminder, Sister.”</p>
<p>Lu Jing found that no matter what she said, Lu Yaoyao would remain indifferent towards her. If anything, she looked uninterested and bored. Even so, she gave it a once last try.</p>
<p>“You should be careful!”</p>
<p>After seeing the Fourth Sister’s being and her “good-will” off, Ye Zhen’s smile instantly vanished.</p>
<p><i>What is Madam Lu doing?</i></p>
<p>Her neglect of duty these past several years had forced Old Madam Lu out of retirement to retake the reins of the family. Hence, one could say, reclaiming her position was long overdue. Lu Fang, the Eldest Miss of the family, was the ‘heir apparent’ once the Old Madam retired. However, as things currently stood, one could not be too sure.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was of the belief that Lu Shiming and his wife were not someone who could be manipulated by Madam Lu. So, Matriarch or not, with respect to the Third Household, things would, perhaps, not go as smoothly as one desired. Thinking up to here, Ye Zhen felt some relief. For the time being, she decided not to dwell on this matter. As soon as she returned home, she would ask Pei Shi and have her answers. Until then, it was best for her to divert her attention elsewhere, as pondering over it would get her to nowhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Time is no slave. Before she knew it, it had been three days since Lu Jing’s visit. Ye Zhen was gradually adapting to life in the School of Medicine. As days passed by, she found herself more and more invested in the world of medicine. In fact, she wished she could learn more every day. The books she had refused to even touch before, were now being read with great gusto. To her surprise, she discovered she had an insatiable appetite for learning.</p>
<p>All in all, this part of this Empire was tranquil.</p>
