            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 307 – She Cannot Become Princess</strong></p>
<p>The empress dowager looked earnestly at him, wanting to find some hint or clue from his face. She understood Mo Rongzhan, and knew that he was never one to be bewitched by beauty. He was different from the previous emperor who had countless beauties in his harem. Apart from the initial Lu Wushuang, she had never seen him be especially doting towards someone. She had even begun to suspect that her son was a bit too emotionless. This was the first time she saw him so concerned over a girl. “Your Imperial Majesty, do you have other plans for Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, why do you ask as such?” Mo Rongzhan quietly asked, his handsome face still clear and cold.</p>
<p>“Seeing as you don’t, I think it is still suitable for me to confer her the title. The last time, I wanted to make her a viscountess, but she was unwilling … stated that she only wanted to be an Imperial Physician in the future. I have decided that I’ll make her a princess this time. In the future, it’ll be up to her, whether she wants to be an Imperial Physician or not.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s gaze deepened. “She’s unwilling to become a viscountess?”</p>
<p>“I think that she might not even want a title of princess. However, I’ve already decided. I’ll make her Princess Furong.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother!” Mo Rongzhan’s brows knitted even tighter. “Lu Yaoyao cannot become a princess.”</p>
<p>If the empress dowager still couldn’t tell what her son meant, then it would be a waste of so many years of living. She took a good look at Mo Rongzhan. “Your Imperial Majesty, I know that Yaoyao is a good girl. But what time did you think of her as such?”</p>
<p>A smudge of awkwardness flashed across Mo Rongzhan’s gaze. “Imperial Mother, I don’t understand what you mean.”</p>
<p>“Do you truly not understand, or are you just pretending to not understand?” She teased. “If I give Yaoyao the title of princess, then she will be Your Imperial Majesty’s little sister. In the future, Your Imperial Majesty needs to direct a marriage for her, and find a good princess consort for her. What does Your Imperial Majesty think of this?”</p>
<p>The scene of Huangfu Chen holding her hand yesterday quickly flashed through his mind, his chest felt so stuffed it hurt. “I won’t direct a marriage for her.” He declared.</p>
<p>“Oh, then I will direct a marriage for her.” She saw that her son was still stubbornly trying to deny his feelings, and lowered her head to search for a title again. “I think that there are not many men worthy of Yaoyao in the capital, but Marquis Jing Ning seems all right …. Your Imperial Majesty, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, I won’t let Lu Yaoyao become a princess.” Mo Rongzhan’s expression had already begun to darken.</p>
<p>The empress dowager felt that the matter was all the more amusing. “Then what do you want her to be? Would you prefer her be one of your concubines?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s handsome face blossomed with a strange flush. He lightly coughed, before turning away. “I can’t guarantee anything about the future.”</p>
<p>“I’ve asked Yaoyao for her opinion. She doesn’t seem to want it. Your Imperial Majesty, you can’t engage in wishful thinking, and continue this unrequited love along.” If it were a girl of some other house that the emperor would take to heart this much, she would naturally wish for nothing more than to take her into the inner palace immediately. But it was different if it was Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>If that little girl wanted to enter the harem, then she wouldn’t have refused her offer of viscountess. She was worried that the emperor would continue this wishful thinking, and force Lu Yaoyao into submission.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was poked in his sore spot, his expression darkened like ink. As of today, wasn’t he just engaging in wishful thinking, and continuing this unrequited love along? Not only did her heart already belong to another, she had also thrown up on him after he kissed her. Whenever he thought back to this, the sourness, jealousy, and anger in his heart would flare up like a roaring flame.</p>
<p>“She’ll naturally agree in the future.” He vehemently iterated.</p>
<p>The empress dowager frowned, looking at him. It seemed that he truly liked Yaoyao. “You want Yaoyao to enter your harem. Then what about Wang Fei Lu?”</p>
<p><em>Wouldn’t that be overtly exalting the Lu Family? </em>She didn’t really care about Yaoyao’s status, but feared that what she would have to face when she entered the imperial palace would be rather grueling.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, I know my own measures concerning this matter,” Mo Rongzhan said between gritted teeth.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, the empress dowager said, “Your Imperial Majesty, I still have to ask Yaoyao for her opinion. If she has no will of entering the inner palace, then I still want to make her a princess. Do you still remember what Mr. Chen said? If it weren’t for the fact that A’Yi has escaped danger over and over again, I would have forgotten his past words.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan felt annoyed at the mere mention of Huangfu Chen. “What did Huangfu Chen say?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen once divinated for A’Yi, and said that he wouldn’t be able to make it past 15 unless he met someone noble. At that time, I had asked who A’Yi’s noble person was. Mr. Chen had said that it was most likely a family member. As of today, I think that Yaoyao is his noble person, so I want to make her a princess.” She said laughingly, “If she is unwilling to become your concubine, then she must become my daughter.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan suddenly felt that he disliked Huangfu Chen even more.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, Huangfu Chen might not necessarily mean Lu Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager nodded. “That is why I have already called for people to invite Mr. Chen into the palace, and let him divinate for A’Yi again.”</p>
<p>“— ” Mo Rongzhan didn’t actually know what to say.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, if you are busy with official matters, then you need not stay here,” she said, smiling.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan wanted to say that he wanted to wait for Huangfu Chen, as he also wished to know the results of the divination. However, seeing as his mother had put it like this, it wasn’t good for him to stay. “Imperial Mother, then I will return to imperial study.”</p>
<p>She cheerily nodded. “Go ahead then.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan could only retire and leave the Cining Palace, coldly ordering Eunuch Fu: “Report to me immediately if Huangfu Chen enters the palace.”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu hurriedly heeded his words.</p>
