            <p><strong>Chapter 423 – Xianfei Xu Seeks an Audience</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at his fading back for a while before entering the palace hall. Mo Rongzhan was not lying on his bed and was, instead, lazily reclining on a low cushioned chair whose front was covered with engraved memorials. Seeing her come in, he didn’t even lift his eyelids.</p>
<p><em>He is the imperial majesty who got injured in order to save her from being injured. Even if she was very reluctant… she will serve him for the next few days!</em>  Ye Zhen said to herself.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, it’s time to drink your medicine.” Ye Zhenfu wished herself luck and put the medicine in his hand on the bench in front of him.</p>
<p>“Take it away!” Mo Rongzhan said coldly while keeping his eyes on the memorial in his hand.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was a little embarrassed as she stood there holding the tray. She whispered, “Your wound has not healed yet, the imperial physician said that you still need to take medicine.”</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, if zhen said zhen won’t drink then zhen won’t drink.” Mo Rongzhan’s tone turned a little angrier.</p>
<p>“Then I ask Your Majesty to please tell the imperial physician in advance, so I won’t make medicine for you in the future.” Ye Zhen forced herself to hold back her temper. Even if he didn’t like to drink, she wouldn’t have brewed the medicine for him if not for the doctor’s instructions.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s lips turned into a sneer and he looked at her with eyes full of indifference. Although he was sitting, he still had a condescending majestic air about him. “Are you talking now as a physician or a princess?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen clenched her fists, lowered her head, and said, “Right now, of course, this servant girl is naturally just a physician.”</p>
<p>“Take the medicine and leave. Don’t come until zhen summons you,” Mo Rongzhan again, stated coldly.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ye Zhen responded in a low voice. It didn’t matter to her if his wounds healed or not.</p>
<p><em>Who cares whether he drinks his medicine or not!</em></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu walked in from the outside and soon sensed that the atmosphere in the hall seemed a bit off. “Your Majesty, Xianfei Xu seeks an audience.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan quickly raised his head and glanced at Ye Zhen. Seeing her expression was indifferent and unmoved, he said in a cold voice, “Let Xianfei Xu come in.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lowered her head. It seemed that he placed his trust in Xu Huiru more than anyone else for the others had been told he hadn’t woken up yet. Now that she came to visit him, he immediately let her in.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this one will withdraw first,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice and left with the medicine.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her back coldly but the anger in his chest just grew stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru originally did not expect Mo Rongzhan would see her nor did she know that he had woken up. She had been thinking of him in her heart and wanted to take a look. However, she did not expect him to not only be awake but also allow her to enter his bedchamber.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao?” She had just walked a few steps when she saw Ye Zhen coming out of the chamber. She looked at her in surprise. “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled faintly. “I was bringing medicine to His Majesty. Xianfei Xu, your complexion looks good.”</p>
<p>Only a few days ago, she was poisoned and unconscious. Today, she looked ruddy. It seemed that her poisoning was not particularly serious, but the most useful thing was that Lu Wushuang had been directly driven out of the palace.</p>
<p>“I’ll bring the medicine to the emperor.” Ye Zhen said quietly, “Please come in, Niang Niang*.”</p>
<p>[*TL: Title used to refer to concubines but just not in court because concubines are not recorded in historical records, just something as a reminder that they’re there as the side wives and not the legitimate wife.]</p>
<p>Xu Huiru didn’t know what Mo Rongzhan was sick with, but she felt that it should have something to do with Lu Yaoyao. That day, Lu Yaoyao and Mo Rongyi had gone to hunt at the hunting grounds. Later, the emperor had also left the palace. When they came back, the entire palace had been placed under martial law.</p>
<p>If it was Lu Yaoyao who had caused the emperor’s injuries, the empress dowager would be very angry. It would be impossible to let Lu Yaoyao be the one to take care of the emperor at this moment.</p>
<p>“This concubine has come to see the emperor.” Xu Huiru entered the chamber and saw Mo Rongzhan’s still handsome but lazy posture. Her heart stirred and she bowed softly. She didn’t know why, she had always had an… unspeakable worry about Lu Yaoyao being by the emperor’s side.</p>
<p>“Beloved Concubine, you are excused from the courtesies.” Mo Rongzhan’s voice was as cold as ever. “You have just recovered, so why are you here?”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru looked at Mo Rongzhan gently, and said softly, “This concubine hasn’t seen you for several days, and was inexplicably worried. So regardless of the emperor’s previous orders, she secretly came over to inquire and sees that the emperor is doing good. This concubine is relieved.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan said lightly, “I did suffer a small injury, and it is no longer a serious problem, but for the time being, I don’t want it to be known by outsiders.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru was overjoyed.  <em>The emperor doesn’t want anyone to know that he has woken up, but he is willing to let her know, so it seems that the emperor trusts her very much.</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, let this concubine stay and take care of you.” Xu Huiru looked at Mo Rongzhan affectionately.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan originally wanted to refuse, but somehow inexplicably, Lu Yaoyao’s ever indifferent  little face appeared in his mind. He wished to see her reaction, as such he nodded and allowed Xu Huiru to stay.</p>
<p><em>Xu Huiru’s behaviour right now should be the normal reaction of any concubine in the harem. Not like that little girl’s, who, even after he said he wanted to crown her his empress, did not look or even feel happy, even refusing without hesitation!</em></p>
