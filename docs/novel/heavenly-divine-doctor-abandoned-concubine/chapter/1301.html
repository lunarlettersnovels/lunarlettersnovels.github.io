<p>“This is my third granddaughter who has just returned from the border town where she has been living since her childhood. Today, I brought her here to see the world,” said Old Madam Lu with a smile and called Ye Zhen to her side.</p>
<p>“My granddaughter, who did not know of anything else, managed to become Teacher Shan’s student only a few days ago for she is filial and intelligent.” Old Madam Lu didn’t forget to add.</p>
<p>Old Madam Wu had a strange smile on her face as she replied. “Indeed, your third granddaughter is so lucky and that Teacher Shan has gained another good student.”</p>
<p>People didn’t know what Madam Wu meant by her statement, but Ye Zhen knew what she had meant. Madam Wu used to see the late wang fei before, but now she was afraid to think of the dead, but she just couldn’t say aloud, that this thought troubled her.</p>
<p>When Lu Fang and Lu Jing saw that others only noticed Ye Zhen, anger filled them but they could not say a word even if they found the events uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Madam Wu, you don’t know how lucky Third Sister is! Having just arrived in the capital, she is now planning to go to the academy!” said Lu Jing with sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Poof!”</p>
<p>The group did not know who laughed aloud.</p>
<p>“Why? Another girl from a merchant background also wants to take an examination for the Academy for Women! Tell me, Lu Jing, how are you any different from her?”</p>
<p>This was very sudden, and everyone around them quieted down, eyes straight at the speaker.</p>
<p>“Princess Liu Hua, what exactly do you mean?” Lu Jing’s face slightly changed as she stared at the girl sitting nearby.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew that Princess Liu Hua was the daughter of an imperial princess and the cousin of Mo Rongzhan. When Ye Zhen’s soul dissipated, she had seen everything that would happen in the future– two years to be exact, as she was reborn back in time when she was killed.</p>
<p>In a year’s time, she knew that Princess Liu Hua would enter the palace to become Mo Rongzhan’s concubine. She would then give birth to a daughter. As for the outcome, Ye Zhen did not know for after two years of wandering in the palace, her soul broke free and she woke up in the body of her sister Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“You don’t know what I mean? My, how embarrassing! Is the academy training such dim-witted girls these days?” Princess Liu Hua looked at Lu Jing, then at Ye Zhen with clear disdain.</p>
<p>Princess Liu Hua was pampered since she was a child, and her character was unruly and willful. Seeing how all the people ingratiated themselves with the Lu girls, she was already dissatisfied and decided to humiliate Lu Jing.</p>
<p>She loved Mo Rongzhan for a long time. She thought she would be his Wang Fei, but instead, Ye Zhen was chosen to be his imperial concubine. When Ye Zhen died, Lu Wushuang was quick to take her place. Furthermore, he had told her that he loved Lu Wushuang like a rare treasure. How could she not be jealous? With her cousin choosing someone of merchant’s blood over her, how could she not be miffed?</p>
<p>She couldn’t wait for the Lu Family to die as quickly as the Ye Family!</p>
<p>“You…” Lu Jing’s face turned red with rage as she thought that this flashy girl was humiliating her.</p>
<p>She and Princess Liu Hua had already had the displeasure of meeting each other in the academy. She was about to start swearing when she heard a calm and cold voice speak.</p>
<p>“What is wrong with being the daughter of a merchant? How can the daughter of a merchant be inferior to that of a princess when you are behaving as though you are not?”</p>
<p>“Impudent! Who are you to dare say that to the princess of this country?” Princess Liu Hua angrily said and rose from her seat.</p>
<p>Lu Jing laughed mockingly. “Even Teacher Shan knows of it. It seems that you are just as short-sighted as I expected.”</p>
<p>“Teacher.” Ye Zhen greeted Teacher Shan.</p>
