<p>Among the skills to be mastered, Ye Zhen’s archery would certainly be no problem. Her nose was buried in books and numbers, but Teacher Shan made sure that she developed in areas where her strengths lay.</p>
<p>It really didn’t matter whether she could pass or not in other fields of the examination, just as long she could showcase at least three excellent skills out of the six.</p>
<p>What’s most important now was her successful admission into the academy. In terms of the areas she was having a hard time with, Teacher Shan could teach her in depth. She would train her until she found her place inside the imperial palace which was every young woman’s dream!</p>
<p>Ye Zhen worked with Teacher Shan for half a day. Arithmetic was her weakest subject, but it wouldn’t be a hindrance to passing the exam.</p>
<p>“Let’s call it a day. Old Madam Lu’s servant has visited several times to see if we’re done. I think that Old Madam Lu craves for your attention,” Teacher Shan said flatly, obviously having a little understanding of why Old Madam liked the third miss best among her granddaughters.</p>
<p>She was somewhat fond of Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt a twinge of annoyance in her heart. She did not like to go to Old Madam, she must feel resistance in liking her. But deep inside her, she had grown fond of the elder far beyond her preference.</p>
<p></p><center><sup>Chapter By WordExcerpt</sup></center><p></p>
<div data-fuse="22037242891" data-fuse-code="fuse-slot-22037242891-1" data-fuse-slot="71161633/WORD_wordexcerpt/chapter_incontent_1">
<div id="fuse-slot-22037242891-1" class="fuse-slot"></div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Most of all, she didn’t want to cross paths with Lu Lingzhi! The tyrant was Old Madam’s favorite so he was usually latched on to Old Madam’s side!</p>
<p>“Teacher, I must go to my chambers first,” said Ye Zhen. She wasn’t properly dressed to be in the presence of Old Madam at the moment.</p>
<p>Although Ye Zhen didn’t like to join Old Madam, she deemed it necessary to please her. In doing so, she could move with ease in the Lu Family by gaining everyone’s favor.</p>
<p>It was almost past dinner time. Ye Zhen presumed Old Madam wanted her to join her for dinner, so she dressed up quickly, not planning to make the elder wait for much longer.</p>
<p>There was raucous laughter from inside the dining hall. Ye Zhen had hardly reached the door when she heard the distinct voices of Lu Fang and Lu Jing. Aside from them, she also heard other unfamiliar voices.</p>
<p><i>Looks like she’ll be in the company of visitors!</i> Ye Zhen sucked a deep breath and moved forward with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>“Third Miss, please come!”</p>
<p>The maid at the door cast the draperies aside and welcomed Ye Zhen happily.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gave her a shallow smile, but the maid was shocked at the miss’ appearance!</p>
<p>She had a hard time distinguishing her a moment ago. <i>How come the wild girl who had just entered the dining hall became so beautiful?</i></p>

<p> </p>
<p>“Grandmother, I’m here.” Ye Zhen had changed into a charming and naughty look when she stepped into the room and even raised a smile as bright as the sun.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen came in, the people in the room became mute for a fleeting moment. They were mesmerized by the little girl’s smile. She was so gorgeous and pure that everyone else in the room lost their luster!</p>
<p><i>When did the tanned and thin wild girl become so beautiful?</i></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu smiled, squinted, and waved Ye Zhen to her. “Come, dear! You must be very tired after an entire day of training!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at all the people in the room. Besides Lu Fang and Lu Jing, there were two girls whom she’d never seen before. They were sitting on the right-hand side of the matriarch.</p>
<p>Judging by their looks, Ye Zhen presumed that they were between the ages of fourteen and fifteen. They looked back at her with curious and somewhat indecisive eyes.</p>
<p>With the transformation of Ye Zhen from day to day, she no longer looked like the sickly girl who had arrived in the capital not long ago.</p>
<p>And with her continuous use of the <i>lingquan<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup></i> from her hand, she would gradually be more stunning.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I could never be tired. What is the point of being tired now that the examination is nearing?” Ye Zhen cleverly sat down and affectionately held Old Madam’s arm. “As long as you leave me delicious food, my whole body will be full of strength.”</p>
<p>Amused, Old Madam Lu laughed. “I knew you wanted some food.”</p>
<p>“What can I do? Food is a blessing,” Ye Zhen said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Indeed, a blessing which will kill us if we do not consume in moderation!” Old Madam jested and brought out laughter from the people surrounding the grand table.</p>
<p>Clearing her throat, Old Madam Lu smiled gently towards the two girls in the room who had been looking at Ye Zhen. One finger pointing at them, she said, “These two are your cousins visiting the capital for a few days.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stood up and bowed. “It’s so nice to meet two cousins. This miss is glad that grandmother is accompanied well.”</p>
<p>The two girls also stood up at the same time and returned the gesture.</p>
<p>“We heard of Third Sister for a long time now and are honored to have met her today.”</p>
<p>Before they had arrived at the Lu Mansion, they had heard that there was a third miss who took residence inside the mansion. They’d be lying if they said that the news of her origin had not reached their ears!</p>
<p>Truly, they hadn’t expected her to be a beauty considering the harsh conditions in the border town.</p>
<p>Lu Jing smiled and introduced the two girls to Ye Zhen. “Third Sister, these are Cousin Qiuping and Cousin Liping. They are also students of the Academy for Women.”</p>
