<p>Aside from bringing Ye Zhen the fawn, Lu Xiangzhi had also acquired two rabbits and pheasants for her. Ye Zhen then gave them to the servants to bathe and bring up to her chambers.</p>
<p>“Brother, has hunting been fun today?” Ye Zhen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“It has been! But it’s a pity that you didn’t come with us, otherwise, you would have liked it,” Lu Xiangzhi said regretfully.</p>
<p>He didn’t have any idea, hunting with them would put her into plight. With Mo Rongzhan and Lu Lingzhi around, she certainly wouldn’t have enjoyed herself.</p>
<p>“We’ll go together again next time!” She replied enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi nodded. “I think we must go back now. Eldest Brother must be waiting for us.”</p>
<p>“Why did you come with Tang Zhen?” The tone of displeasure is apparent.</p>
<p>She then took a look at the handsome man whom she got the silver whip from. He was talking to Lu Shiming, his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>“Tang Zhen is a good man. He spoke to the emperor for me! If not for him, I wouldn’t have been here to give you my gifts.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi felt a little irked at how his sister hated the presence of his good friend who could indeed be impulsive and rude at times but had attributes worthy of recognizing.</p>
<p>Upon the mention of the emperor, Ye Zhen frowned slightly and took a nervous glance sideways before asking, “Did the emperor ask you anything?”</p>
<p>“If the emperor asks me anything, I will tell everyone that His Majesty talked to me.” He directly answered.</p>
<p>“Oh!” Ye Zhen nodded, lightly laughing with Lu Xiangzi. Her heart was quietly relieved, it seemed that Mo Rongzhan didn’t order anyone to find the woman he met last night.</p>
<p>“Fourth Younger Brother, we should go back now,” Tang Zhen came up and said to Lu Xiangzhi, but his eyes were trained on Ye Zhen alone, “Third Sister, we have met again.”</p>
<p>Giving a quick curtsey, Ye Zhen smiled faintly before asking, “Marquis Tang, I wonder if there has been any competition in hunting today?”</p>
<p>“Well, if Third Sister was present, there would have been a second competition.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her brows while crossing her arms over her chest, “Saying so, do you still have a silver whip to lose to me?”</p>
<p><i>How was he supposed to answer?</i> Tang Zhen was left speechless, he was not one to lose all the time!</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi felt that his sister was a bit unkind and coughed lightly. “Sister, we must go.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen didn’t have the heart to go back to the camp this time. He’d rather eat roasted mutton in the presence of the beautiful Ye Zhen. But the emperor expected his immediate return, so he started to walk unto the garden gate.</p>
<p>Walking farther from the light of the fire, the path they crossed, despite being a short trip, was now dark. Lu Xiangzhi even tripped over a rock!</p>
<p>“Brother, be careful.” Ye Zhen called out with concern.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, why do you only care about your fourth brother?” He had sacrificed the only silver whip in the world to her just to gain her attention. And here he was, receiving the cold shoulder like backlash.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen just glared at him indifferently. “Marquis Tang, you don’t need to walk slowly. Your face is as hard as a rock, I believe.”</p>
<p>Almost instantly, Lu Xiangzhi grimaced at his sister’s snarky remark. Thankfully, Lu Shiming and Pei Shi were out of earshot! He smiled and faced the marquis apologetically.</p>
<p>“Don’t take offense, Marquis Tang. My sister is just like that. She often talks a lot.”</p>
<p>Witnessing this scene, Lu Shiming exchanged glances with Pei Shi, a knowing smile on their faces. They joined the three young people and walked them to the door.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen politely invited them back. “Lord Lu, don’t have to see me off. Lu Lingzhi and I are brothers. You are his third uncle, and therefore mine as well,” he said with confidence.</p>
<p>Afraid of how it may sound to others, Lu Shiming just gave a helpless smile. He couldn’t dare call himself the third uncle of the marquis!</p>
<p>After the two men were sent off, Ye Zhen went back to the garden where she found Teacher Shan still sitting by the quqin. She had a distant look on her face as she stared at the bright fire.</p>
<p>She sat down next to Teacher Shan and said, “Teacher Shan plays very well.”</p>
<p>Teacher Shan didn’t answer her right away. She just stared at Ye Zhen with unconcealed suspicion.</p>
<p>“You dance well and have excellent rhythm. Do you really not know how to play guqin?”</p>
