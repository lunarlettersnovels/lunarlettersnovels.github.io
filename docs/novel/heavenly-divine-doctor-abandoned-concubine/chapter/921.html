            <p><strong>Chapter 408 – Why Did You Save Me?</strong></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, duck down!” Tang Zhen and Mo Rongzhan shouted at the same time.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned to see a bloody mouth leaping at her. She was already exhausted. Now, facing this tiger, she forgot to react.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had already run over, throwing himself at her and pulling her to the ground.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rip——</strong></em></p>
<p>She could hear the sound of flesh and bone being ripped apart. She saw Mo Rongzhan’s sword hand inside the tiger’s throat. Then, it fell heavily on the ground beside them.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty!” Tang Zhen shouted.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen hugged Mo Rongzhan’s shoulder, her hand full of mangled flesh. Raising them, she found that her hands were covered with fresh blood.</p>
<p><em>His blood!</em></p>
<p>“Mo Rongzhan…!” Ye Zhen was shocked stupid. “Mo Rongzhan, are you all right? Talk to me?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Mo Rongzhan raised his head with difficulty, his voice weak as he laughed. “Don’t cry. I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pushed him away. Seeing the wounds on his back, her tears unceasingly streamed down. <em>How could he be fine? His back had been clawed several times by the tiger’s claws. It was already just a patch of mangled flesh. Even more, the wounds on his shoulder were deep to the bone.</em></p>
<p><em>He was already in this condition… How could he be fine?</em></p>
<p>Tang Zhen hurriedly said, “Yaoyao, hurry and send His Majesty back to the palace to find Imperial Physician Qi.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wiped away her tears. This wasn’t the time to cry. She said to Tang Zhen, “We can’t take him back like this. Go get some more people, and some wooden planks. We have to carry him back.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan grasped Ye Zhen’s hand, and said to Tang Zhen, “The news about my injury has to be kept secret!”</p>
<p>“Hurry and go!” Ye Zhen shouted at Tang Zhen, who was still standing still.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen looked at her with a profound gaze. “Take care of His Majesty.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was already limply lying against the ground because of blood loss.</p>
<p>“I have some medicine on me. I’ll apply it first,” she said hoarsely, ripping apart the clothes on his back.</p>
<p>“Hm!” He groaned. His wounds were tugged by the clothes, putting him in even more pain.</p>
<p>“Your clothes aren’t stuck to the wounds yet. If we rip them after the blood dries, it’ll hurt even more. Can you bear it?” Ye Zhen bit her lip and asked.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan gasped to breathe, his face a ghastly white. “Yes. Do it.”</p>
<p>She ripped apart the clothes on his back little by little. What she couldn’t tear, she cut with a dagger. Seeing the wounds on his back, her eyes welled up with tears again. “Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“No!’ he firmly said.</p>
<p>She sniffled. “I’ll apply the medicine.”</p>
<p>She looked at her own palms and concentrated, and linquan appeared in her hands. She put all the drops on his wounds. This was the only way she could save him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan only felt the burning pain on his back being replaced by a coolness. It seemed to not hurt as much as it had. “What medicine did you bring? It already doesn’t hurt that much.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know how many drops of lingquan she had dripped on his wounds. Initially, she could only get a single drop with every use. Now, she could already get three at a time. She ceaselessly made the spirit fountain appear, then dropped the liquid on his wounds.</p>
<p>The wounds that had been doused in the spirit fountain already stopped bleeding. But the blood that had already flowed out still wet most of his clothes.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao…..” he hoarsely called her.</p>
<p>She didn’t pay attention to him.</p>
<p>“Talk to me, or I’ll faint,” he said.</p>
<p>“Can you sit up?” She only stopped using the elixir after she confirmed that his wounds had stopped bleeding.</p>
<p>“Help me up.” He didn’t think his back hurt as much as it had, but he was still a little weak.</p>
<p>She grasped his hand, and carefully helped him sit. Looking at his pale, handsome face, and then glancing at the dead tiger on the side, she quietly said, “You almost died!”</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been for her lingquan, with the state of his injuries, he would have undoubtedly died.<em> Why… had he protected her, without any regard for his own life?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan raised his arm with difficulty, lightly brushing her face. “I’m fine, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>She held in her tears, lowering her head. She didn’t want him to save her like this… She didn’t want to owe him anything.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, don’t cry,” he said hoarsely, his fingers lightly raising her chin. He lowered his head to kiss her tightly clenched lips. “I’m very happy that you’re all right.”</p>
<p>“You….”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen just began to speak, but he had already kissed her lips close. His tongue danced with hers as he completely disregarded the mangled wounds on his back.</p>
<p>Her hands pressed against his chest. This was the first time she didn’t push him away, but she also didn’t respond.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt like she had walked into a dead-end.</p>
