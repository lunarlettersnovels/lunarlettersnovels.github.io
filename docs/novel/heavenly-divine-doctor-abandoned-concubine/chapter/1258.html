            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 69 – Beautiful Demon Under The Moonlight (2)</h3>
<p>Suddenly, the woman stopped swimming, much to Mo Rongzhan’s disappointment. Indeed, he was quite charmed seeing her glide to and fro in the water gracefully.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8"></div>
<p>However, he was welcomed by a more enchanting sight when Ye Zhen rose from the water, exposing to him her whole appearance.</p>
<p>She sat on the stone slab in the middle of the pool, seemingly tired and breathing heavily. Her side was facing him. At her position, he could clearly see her plumpness wrapped by her waistband.</p>
<p>Her breasts rose and fell with her every breath and her lustrous skin shimmered. Under the moonlight, she looked like a demon.</p>
<p>A beautiful demon, definitely. Her face was rosy like lotus, skin smooth and jade-like, her movements graceful and enticing.</p>
<p>Seeing such a delightful image, Mo Rongzhan felt his breath getting heavier while his feet advanced over the rocks uncontrollably. He was lost to the beauty of the nymph sitting unaware on the stone that he couldn’t help but draw nearer to her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt a bit weak. She sat on the stone slab and wanted to rest for a while. After swimming for so long, her mood had calmed down and her anger and sadness were finally suppressed. Now, she just wanted to go back and sleep, for tomorrow she would be strong again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she seemed to hear a slight noise. Ye Zhen looked around doubtfully. When she turned her head, she was shocked to her core.</p>
<p>She didn’t notice that a man wearing dark gold-rimmed robes was standing beside the hot springs pool all this time. His broad robes hung loosely over him, and his belt was only tied casually, revealing his strong chest.</p>
<p><i>Mo Rongzhan?</i> Ye Zhen froze and stared at him. <i>Why is he here?</i></p>
<p>Just when Ye Zhen was stunned, Mo Rongzhan strode into the pool, in her direction. The sound of his body slashing through the surface of the calm water finally woke Ye Zhen from her momentary trance.</p>
<p>As fast as she could, she jumped into the water like a mermaid, intending to quickly leave the place by the small opening at the bottom of the hot springs’ wall. She could not meet Mo Rongzhan under such circumstances. Absolutely not!</p>
<p>Just as she was about to reach the wooden wall, a big hand grabbed her feet and dragged her back vigorously.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen wriggled and kicked as hard as she could with her other unbuckled foot!</p>
<p>And in a second, she heard a muffled grunt before she felt her foot release from the grasp of a big strong hand.</p>
<p>Wasting no time, she immediately dove into the water, swam across the wooden wall, and called Dai Mei in panic…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan put his hand over his bloody nose and looked at the wooden wall in front of him. It was the first time that a woman dared to kick him.</p>
<p><i>If this woman was not arranged for him, then who is she?</i></p>
<p>He stared at the wall for a moment before he left the hot springs pool with a cold face. There was no way he could go after her, the hole in the wall was too narrow for him.</p>
<p>Shortly after leaving the woods, he saw Eunuch Fu hurrying over with his clothes in hand.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan changed from his wet robes, and then returned to Chengde Mountain Villa. Tang Zhen and Lu Lingzhi, who came with him to hunt, were waiting for him in the hall. When they saw him coming back, they all knelt to salute him.</p>
<p>“Rise!” Mo Rongzhan’s voice was cold, his eyes bore remote indifference.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi and Tang Zhen exchanged glances, it seemed that the emperor was not in a good mood.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, what happened to you?” Tang Zhen looked up to see Mo Rongzhan’s nose slightly bleeding and could not help but ask for details of his latest trek.</p>
<p>Upon Tang Zhen’s query, Mo Rongzhan’s mood became even sourer. “I’m fine. I just went out to take a bath in a nearby spring.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen smiled and said, “Nice idea! This is the best time to soak in the warmth of spring! We can also go bathe in the hot springs when we come back from hunting tomorrow!”</p>
<p><i>What if I meet that woman again?</i> Mo Rongzhan thought to himself that if he saw the woman again, he would not let her go again.</p>
<p>“Is there any hot spring in this neighborhood?” he asked lightly.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi smiled gratefully before speaking. “Your Majesty, there is! The Zhuangzi hot springs which you bestowed to my family.”</p>
<p>At this revelation, Mo Rongzhan’s eyes became darker.</p>
<p><i>The woman is from the Lu Family then. </i></p>
<p>He touched his nose. <i>If her appearance was really intentional, why would she dare kick him?</i></p>
<p>His forehead creased a little as he thought somberly, <i>did she now regard him as some pervert?</i></p>
