            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 351 – Ride with Me (2)</strong></p>
<p>Empress Dowager was unable to help herself and laughed. “He has come to find you. A few days ago, he held a banquet at his place, and a lot of people came. It made him very happy for a long time.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and said, “A’Yi ought to have invited those people long ago.”</p>
<p>At this time, Mo Rongyi ran in and saw Ye Zhen sitting next to Empress Dowager. Immediately, he beamed with joy. “How come you’re just back now? I’ve been looking for you for days.”</p>
<p>Empress Dowager glanced at him angrily. “You only know how to play all day long. You think everyone is the same as you?”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, how can you say I am just playing all day? I’m doing something serious,” Mo Rongyi said solemnly.</p>
<p>“So, what did you do?” Ye Zhen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi coughed and said, “I’ve found a partner who’ll play polo with me. You can come with me to the polo court and take a look.”</p>
<p>He had made friends with those people according to the tips Yaoyao had given him. Initially, he was worried that they would not follow him. However, to his surprise, those people from noble families didn’t look down on him like they used to. Instead, they were willing to associate with him. These days, they were even practicing polo together with him, gradually becoming familiar with one another.</p>
<p>Of late, Mo Rongyi had finally realized his life had changed from the moment his brother ascended the throne. Now, he was no longer the little prince who used to hide in the corner, only able to watch others laugh without joining in on the fun.</p>
<p>Empress Dowager smiled and said, “Yaoyao, go with him, so he won’t keep harping about it for several days. That will be truly vexing.”</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, how can you say that about your son?” Mo Rongyi shouted with a red face.</p>
<p>But he was soon distracted when Ye Zhen stood up and said, “I’ll go to the polo court with you.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi laughed happily, and at once took Ye Zhen to the polo court. Unlike the last time, there were a lot of people in the polo court today. Aside from the few little boys they had met before, there were a few more teenagers around thirteen and fourteen. They were vigorously riding the horse as they struck the ball with one hit, which was certainly not comparable to those small companions who played with Mo Rongyi before.</p>
<p>“When will you play polo with Prince Shun?” Ye Zhen asked with a smile. “Then again, looking at this, you should be able to win.”</p>
<p>Her words pumped him up. An excited Mo Rongyi asked, “Really?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t answer. She looked at the teenagers in the polo court and said, “When you interact with them, you have to be sincere. Only in this way can they be sincere and loyal to you in return.”</p>
<p>“I regard them as my friend. They should be loyal to Brother-Emperor,” Mo Rongyi said seriously.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was stupefied for a moment, looking at Mo Rongyi in a daze. <em>Can’t they be loyal to the little prince?</em></p>
<p>In that case… She wanted to take her revenge on Mo Rongzhan, but she didn’t want the Empire of Jin to fall into the hands of a foolish, wasteful emperor. If the empire were to be at the mercy of a muddle-headed and incompetent emperor, it would only be the common people who would suffer in the end. However, what if it was Mo Rongyi who replaced Mo Rongzhan?</p>
<p><em>Can’t Mo Rongyi become the emperor?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart beat a little faster at the thought. This idea that suddenly came to her mind confused her a little.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, what are you thinking? Why aren’t you talking to me? I didn’t hear you answer,” Mo Rongyi said as he tugged at Ye Zhen’s sleeve, waking her up from her contemplation.</p>
<p>“Oh, what did you say?” Ye Zhen looked down at Mo Rongyi’s innocent face. <em>This child is kind and gentle. He will certainly become a kind emperor in the future. If… I can really help him usurp the throne…</em></p>
<p><em>That will be the greatest revenge I can inflict on Mo Rongzhan.</em></p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s curiosity was at an all-time high. He had clearly seen how Lu Yaoyao had been chilly towards Tang Zhen when they had stepped into the Lu Mansion. He desperately wished to know how his subordinate had managed to earn Lu Yaoyao’s ire.</p>
<p>But upon arriving at the palace, the girl immediately went to Cining Palace, and the marquis had also excused himself. So, he didn’t know whom to ask.</p>
<p><em>Could it be that Yaoyao and Tang Zhen …</em> Mo RongZhan’s face turned sullen. Even if he had such a thought in mind, he would not allow it.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty.” Eunuch Fu came in from the outside, bowed down, looked at Mo Rongzhan’s face, and whispered, “Little Prince and Princess Fu Rong have gone to the polo field.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes turned slightly bright. “A’Yi asked Yaoyao to play polo with him again?”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu replied with a smile, “This slave hasn’t been there to see it. Your Majesty, why not go and have a look?”</p>
