            <p><strong>Chapter 473 – Private Mining</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen paused and asked in a low voice, “Can’t you beat them?”</p>
<p>“These are just rabble,” he replied.</p>
<p><em>So it’s easy for him to deal with these rabble-rousers? Then why were they still in captivity?</em> “Master, do you know where they are taking us?”</p>
<p>“I’ll know when I get there,” he said.</p>
<p>“You don’t seem to be worried at all,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen chuckled. “Even if I’m worried, there is no way to escape. Although I could’ve dealt with these people, I was afraid that more would come to capture us before we could leave the village. So instead of resisting, it’s better to follow them and find out who dares to blatantly arrest people?”</p>
<p>“They don’t look like kidnappers.” If it were a kidnapper, he would definitely be lurking around. How could he dare to enter an inn and capture a guest?</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s much harder to deal with than a kidnapper,” he said in a low voice. He had lived in Gujia Village for a few days before disappearing from the world (went into hiding). The innkeeper was still the original owner, but because of his disguise, the other party did not recognize him. However, this village was not the original one.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart trembled. She did not know what kind of situation she was about to face.</p>
<p>After an unknown amount of time, the carriage gradually slowed down. Huangfu Chen covered his eyes again and the rope was tied right as it was. Several voices sounded in his ears. It seemed that there were quite a lot of people around.</p>
<p><em>Where exactly are we?</em> Ye Zhen was shocked.</p>
<p>Someone came over and took the black cloth off their faces. The leader was smiling as he followed and fawned over a middle-aged man in a straight-jacketed brocade robe. “Mr. Qiu, what do you think of these people? They are all young and strong, and can work.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stood behind Huangfu Chen. She looked around and was left dumbfounded</p>
<p>This was… There were a lot of men wearing the same color and coarse cloth around. They were working- knocking, moving, and lifting. The black objects in the frames looked like iron pieces. There was a big hole in the distant mountain and people were coming in and going out.</p>
<p>“These two look like they can work, take them to the mine first.” The straight-jacketed man seemed to be cultured, but his eyes were exceptionally sharp. He stared at Ye Zhen and Dai Mei before pointing at the latter and saying, “Bring her to the female workers’ side.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Qiu, aren’t women workers not supposed to be next to(together) with the men workers?” someone next to him said.</p>
<p>“Who told you she was a man?” Mr. Qiu snorted coldly.</p>
<p>The leader of the group widened his eyes. <em>She is a woman?! If only they knew, they would’ve played first!</em></p>
<p>“Master came over yesterday to inspect. He lacks a servant. Send this one to serve him.” Mr. Qiu pointed at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“She must be by my side,” Huangfu Chen promptly interjected.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu looked up at Huangfu Chen and smiled. “You don’t have the right to make decisions here.”</p>
<p>“Master, it’s fine,” Ye Zhen softly said. Even if she didn’t have much experience, she could tell that this place was unusual. This was an iron mine! Moreover, it was not an iron mine of the imperial court. To have such a large private mine in Jing Country and capture so many people, the person behind it was certainly not simple.</p>
<p>Who had such great ability to evade the imperial court and hide from the eyes of the imperial officials?</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan probably didn’t know that such a person existed in Jing Country under his rule, right? What could iron ore be used for? Private weaponry? Ye Zhen’s heart was a little flustered. She felt that they had unintentionally stumbled upon a shocking secret.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at Ye Zhen worriedly. If he had known about the situation here, he wouldn’t have allowed her to follow him here.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled at him faintly. She also wanted to know who was behind all this and what was this person’s goal?</p>
<p>“Take them away,” Mr. Qiu coldly ordered.</p>
<p>“Wait, I have my things in the carriage. I want to take them with me,” Ye Zhen said in a deep voice. She had brought along many medicinal herbs, and she didn’t want to lose them just like that.</p>
<p>“Do you think you are here for sightseeing? Anything and everything can be brought?!” a burly man cursed.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu signaled him to shut up but looked coldly at Ye Zhen. “What do you want to bring?”</p>
<p>“My medicines,” Ye Zhen replied.</p>
<p>“Go get it,” Mr. Qiu instructed.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen’s gaze had never once left Ye Zhen. He was also contemplating whether he could escape at this time or not. As he assessed the surroundings, given the security, he concluded that he would be able to escape but might not be able to take Ye Zhen along.</p>
<p><em>This place…I am afraid is not as simple as mining!</em></p>
<p>When Ye Zhen brought over her things, Mr. Qiu glanced at her. “You’re a doctor?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” She nodded impassively.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu suddenly looked at Huangfu Chen. “She called you Master. Are you also a doctor?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” he said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“How’s your medical skills?” Mr. Qiu asked seriously.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen raised his eyebrows slightly. “It’s okay.”</p>
<p>“Send the two of them to Master,” Mr. Qiu instructed coldly before turning to Huangfu Chen, “If you can cure our master’s illness, I can let you go.”</p>
<p>“If you want us to treat your master, then you have to allow them to go with us,” Ye Zhen pointed to Dai Mei and Quan Fu and said.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu’s lips curved into an unsightly smile. “If the disease is cured, you can live; if it is not, all four of you will die.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled faintly. “Okay.”</p>
<p>“Come with me.” Mr. Qiu had an indescribable feeling towards this man with ordinary features; he seemed to be very calm and fearless.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen and Huangfu Chen glanced at each other and at the same time, looked at the deep mountains.</p>
<p>The iron mined from these mines… What do they do(with it)?</p>
