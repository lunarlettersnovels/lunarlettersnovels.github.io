            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 160 – When A Woman Gets Jealous (2)</strong></p>
<p>Lu Wushuang left the Cining Palace and hurried to the lotus pond in the imperial gardens. As long as she thought of Lu Yaoyao’s scheme to attract Mo Rongzhan, she felt like there was a fire burning in her heart. She couldn’t wait to scratch Lu Yaoyao’s face, only then would she feel relieved.</p>
<p>From a distance, she saw Mo Rongzhan and Lu Yaoyao standing face to face. Lu Yaoyao looked up at Mo Rongzhan with expressive eyes.</p>
<p>Two figures stood beside the lotus pond; the woman was slim and graceful, the man tall and upright. If anything, they looked like a couple having their quiet time in the garden. Lu Wushuang fumed with anger. She was almost too jealous even to breathe.</p>
<p>What’s more, Mo Rongzhan was smiling. <i>He actually smiled at Lu Yaoyao… He seldom smiles at her!</i></p>
<p>As ordered by the emperor, Ye Zhen was tasked to treat Mo Rongyi. She planned to leave and return to the little prince’s palace as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Then, she suddenly heard heavy steps approaching, and Lu Wushuang came in sight. From the look on her face, she was livid. Ye Zhen didn’t need another trouble for this day.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, if you have no other orders, this official’s daughter should take leave now.” She would still have to prescribe the sick Little Prince.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was a man with intense martial arts levels. From afar, he could already sense Lu Wushuang’s presence—and her anger. The woman had never displayed an unpleasant behavior in front of him before. <i>Was it all a facade?</i></p>
<p>He wanted to know what she would do next.</p>
<p>“The wang fei is here, don’t you want to meet your cousin before leaving?” Mo Rongzhan asked lightly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt that he was up to no good in saying so. She was not blind. Lu Wushuang’s face looked like she was coming to kill her.</p>
<p>But at the back of her mind, she <b><i>did</i></b> want Lu Wushuang to beat her so that everyone would see her true self.</p>
<p>As Ye Zhen was thinking of this, Lu Wushuang had already marched up to her. Passing the emperor, she didn’t even curtsy, her heated gaze trained on her cousin alone.</p>
<p>And before they knew it, a loud slap resonated in the area.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang, blinded by jealousy and hurt, had already slapped Ye Zhen hard in the face. It was so hard that Ye Zhen’s head tilted to one side, and blood trickled down the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>An ugly red mark immediately marred her face.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes were as cold as ice, he witnessed it all. When Lu Wushuang raised her hand again to slap Ye Zhen for the second time, he grabbed her arm. “Wang Fei, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>The furious Wang Fei answered maniacally. “I’m teaching my sister a lesson. She is so shameless. If her parents didn’t teach her right, I will!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen buried her face in her hands, perfectly hiding the smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, I only asked your sister to watch over my brother. What is so shameful about it?” Mo Rongzhan’s voice was ominous and with just a hint of surprise. If not for the gentle face, he wouldn’t have recognized the woman whose arm he held in captivity to protect Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang stared at Ye Zhen with a pair of eyes that seemed to burst into flames anytime soon.</p>
<p>A slap was not enough. Lu Wushuang was dying to destroy her cousin’s face.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this official’s daughter will take leave now.” Ye Zhen learned today that Lu Wushuang’s jealousy was so terrible that she wasn’t even able to control herself.</p>
<p>It seemed that no woman could get close to the emperor as she morbidly thought that other women were all trying to steal Mo Rongzhan’s favor from her.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang looked at Ye Zhen with disdain and felt more and more that her cousin did not take her seriously. “Did I permit you to go?”</p>
<p>“What else does  Wang Fei want to do? Give me another slap?” Ye Zhen raised her eyebrows and looked at Lu Wushuang in the eye, mockingly.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang, whether in the Lu Family or in the palace, was a pampered woman. No one dared to question her like Ye Zhen!</p>
<p><i>Does she think the emperor really takes a fancy on her, so she dares to be so presumptuous that she doesn’t even care to regard me as the wang fei? She is way beneath me!</i></p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, how dare you be presumptuous!”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang was so angry that she wanted to kill Lu Yaoyao on the spot. Anyway, she had no feelings for her cousin as they did not live together, not to mention developed sisterhood.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen calmly said, “Wang Fei, I don’t know what I did wrong that made you so angry. Please calm down and don’t be mad at me. “</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan held back Lu Wushuang, who glowered and kicked, but the little girl who was beaten was calm and serene, showing her excellent cultivation.</p>
<p>Both were born in the Lu Family, but Lu Yaoyao was more elegant than Lu Wushuang. It seems that Lu Shiming raised his daughter well.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to lose face, leave the imperial palace immediately, and never come back! You lowly — ” Lu Wushuang screeched towards Ye Zhen, giving all her might to escape from the emperor’s hold.</p>
<p>“Enough!” Mo Rongzhan intervened, “I have just said that I only want Lu Yaoyao to watch the little prince and make sure he takes his medicine. Wang Fei Lu, do you want to lose your face?”</p>
