            <p><strong>Chapter 414 – A Dream to the Past</strong></p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at her with a complicated gaze. He knew she was already aware of her own background. But now, it seemed she knew even more. “Then you look over A’Zhan. I’ll go to the library, and see if there are any records of similar incidents,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>“Without the emperor’s orders, can you enter the library?” Ye Zhen asked with confusion. She had tried entering the library without Mo Rongzhan’s orders before. They wouldn’t allow her in.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen lightly smiled. “The library’s books belong to the Huangfu Family.”</p>
<p><em>Oh, right, Huangfu Chen’s surname was Huangfu. The guard Old Mister Jiang was loyal to the Huangfu Family. How could he stop him?</em></p>
<p>After Huangfu Chen left, Ye Zhen was the only one left at guard in the resting chambers. She sat next to the imperial bed, her eyes gazing at Mo Rongzhan, who was still deep in sleep. She was worried. <em>What if…..the lingquan is too powerful, and he is unable to wake?</em></p>
<p>“Why did you come to save me? How am I supposed to complete my goals now….” Ye Zhen quietly murmured. In the end, she still softly sighed. “Hurry and wake up.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan didn’t listen, continuing his deep unconsciousness without the slightest hint at an intent to wake. He was dreaming. A very real dream.</p>
<p>In his dream, he seemed to have returned to the time when he had just been coronated. However, something different seemed to be here in his dream. Whether he was going to the morning court sessions or reviewing court memorials in the imperial study, he felt that there was someone next to him, constantly observing him silently. At first, he felt that this was very strange, however, he gradually felt that this provided him a greater feeling of ease.</p>
<p>Something else that was different was that, in his dream, he didn’t dismiss Lu Wushuang. Instead, he doted and trusted in her very much. But… he didn’t meet Yaoyao. The Third Miss of the Lu Family never appeared in his dreams.</p>
<p>His dream was very long, and two years’ time seemed to pass. One day, his heart suddenly seemed to shake with pain as if something had been carved from his heart. He didn’t know what this feeling was. He only felt that there was something lost in his life…</p>
<p>This dream was very blurry. Mo Rongzhan wanted to know what exactly was happening, but many things were hazy and unclear. Only the feeling of being quietly watched by someone was most clear to him.</p>
<p>But, after an aching feeling in his heart, this feeling disappeared as well.</p>
<p>He started to feel strange and unaccustomed to it all. In his dream, when he faced Lu Wushuang, the disgust in his heart grew increasingly clear, and he started to miss someone even more… But who was that someone?</p>
<p>He felt that he seemed to have overlooked something, or missed something, but he couldn’t remember. Then, he went to the Duke of Qin’s residence, then…</p>
<p>He was startled awake.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan opened his eyes. His body was covered with sweat, but this sweat was no longer black. He wasn’t quite sure where he was. When he opened his eyes, he saw his familiar resting chambers. It took him a while to snap back, and realize that he had just had a dream.</p>
<p>He turned and wanted to call Fude over, but saw Ye Zhen, who was sleeping against the side of his bed.</p>
<p>She was resting her head on her hands, looking a bit pale. She didn’t seem to be sleeping well, as her eyelashes were constantly trembling. Her tiny shoulders were thin and fragile.</p>
<p>The very sight of them would make one want to lock her into an embrace and dote over her.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s heart melted, reaching to want to touch her face, but as soon as he moved, the injuries on his back erupted into a slicing pain, reminding him of the fact that he had been hurt by the tiger.</p>
<p>At the noise, Ye Zhen immediately bolted awake. She raised her head to see Mo Rongzhan with a furrowed brow. She was taken aback, then happily exclaimed, “You’re awake?!”</p>
<p>“How long have I been asleep?” Mo Rongzhan asked quietly.</p>
<p>“Two days,” she replied. The worry-wreathed empress dowager had not been able to sleep or eat. If it hadn’t been for the fact that his pulse seemed fine, everyone would have thought that he was about to die.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen had been perusing in the imperial library these two days, wanting to find the reason for his unconsciousness. Fortunately, he was already awake.</p>
<p>“Are you hurt?” Mo Rongzhan asked hoarsely, his gaze never once leaving her the entire time.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head. “No.” She paused before saying, “How do you feel? Does your back hurt?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s lips curved into a light smile. “Come over here, and let me have a look at you.”</p>
<p>“I need to tell the Empress Dowager. She is very worried about you.” Ye Zhen slightly lowered her head, afraid to meet his eyes.</p>
<p>Then, she turned and ran out.</p>
