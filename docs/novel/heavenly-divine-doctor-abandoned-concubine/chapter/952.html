            <p><strong>Chapter 377 – I Seek Your Hand in Marriage (2)</strong></p>
<p>The young marquis’s handsome face turned crimson. “As long as you like it. That’s right, when are you and Little Prince going hunting?”</p>
<p>“A’Yi’s shoulder is hurt. We need to wait at least half a month,” she said.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I’ll go with you guys, then. Though there are no dangerous beasts in the hunting grounds, you’ll at least need someone to protect you guys,” he said. He really wanted to ask her immediately whether she was willing to marry him but knew not how to start.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and said, “Then you can go and ask A’Yi. I’m only going to accompany him.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen immediately felt that there were no more problems. As long as he went to see the little prince, he would definitely agree.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao—” Tang Zhen awkwardly coughed.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Ye Zhen saw that he seemed to be stuttering and hesitating, and put the crossbow back into the brocade box, confusedly looking at him.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen took a look at her, and the image of when he had first seen her appeared in his head. She was riding a horse, freely flying, her clean and stunning face unparalled in the world. He had fallen in love at first sight and had been unable to forget her.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I have something to ask you.”</p>
<p>“Ask,” Ye Zhen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I want to propose our marriage to your father!” Tang Zhen hurriedly said, his handsome face dyed beet red. “I seek your hand in marriage, Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was taken aback. She had dimly detected Tang Zhen’s feelings for her, but hadn’t guessed that he would directly say something like this…</p>
<p>Tang Zhen looked at the girl with a red face, waiting for her answer. Eventually, the two were cast into silence.</p>
<p>“Tang Zhen, you want my hand in marriage… Then are you willing to give up the glory and prosperity of the capital for me? Are you willing to give up your titles and future career, and leave with me from here, to live a simple and steady life? If you want my hand in marriage, you need to give up a lot of things. Are you willing?” Ye Zhen spoke unabashedly, not even feeling anything. She just calmly asked him these questions unlike the girls her age who would shy away just at the mention of marriage.</p>
<p>“I…,” Tang Zhen wanted to blurt out that he was willing.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen cut him off. “Don’t answer me so hurriedly. Go back and think about it. Tell me your answer in a month.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen didn’t speak again, but he was happy. At least she hadn’t rejected him at once.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t think that she would ever meet another man that she could love unconditionally. So, to her, if she were to marry in the future, it would be enough if he were on the same boat as her and be willing to take her away from the capital after she had had her revenge. She didn’t have any other wishes.</p>
<p>If Tang Zhen were willing to give up his glory and riches for her and go with her to Jinkou City, the frontier, or anywhere else where she could avoid Mo Rongzhan, and live a steady, calm life, she would be willing to marry him.</p>
<p>She gave Tang Zhen a month to think it over. She didn’t want him to answer her recklessly now only to blame her in the future.</p>
<p>Not long after, it was the day for them to enter the palace. Their backgrounds had already been checked. Today, they were to enter the palace and have a physical examination. The palace needed to ensure that they did not have any hidden illnesses before they would be permitted to live there.</p>
<p>The medical supervisors in charge of examining them were two court ladies. They were also once imperial physicians and were promoted to medical supervisors. Apart from Ye Zhen and Chen Jinru, there were three other girls, about two years older than them. On the way to the palace, the five of them had already grown acquainted with one another. However, they were still a bit wary due to Ye Zhen’s title.</p>
<p>When it was time for Ye Zhen to be examined, the supervisors knew that she was the princess, as they had gotten news that there was a princess among this year’s imperial physicians, and seeing that the other girls had not had the surname “Lu”, the princess could only be the one standing before them.</p>
<p>“It’s not necessary for us to examine Your Imperial Highness,” one of the supervisors said quietly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen flicked an eyebrow and took a look at her. “Why is that so?”</p>
<p>“If there are hidden illnesses on Your Imperial Highness’s body, then wouldn’t that be the fault of the entire Imperial Physicans’ Courtyard? Your Imperial Highness is a case different from the others,” The medical supervisor said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Although that is true, however, just examine me like you did the others, to prevent any gossip.” Ye Zhen insisted. She knew there were people waiting in the Imperial Physicans’ Courtyard to work against her. She didn’t want to make any mistakes that people could latch onto.</p>
<p>The two medical supervisors exchanged a glance. Seeing as the princess had already spoken, naturally, it wouldn’t be good for them to argue, and they did as they were bid.</p>
<p>As they were about to start, Imperial Physician Huang came over to inspect. Her eyes looked sharply at Ye Zhen, then at the two medical supervisors. “Are you done with the examinations?”</p>
<p>The two medical supervisors bowed. “Imperial Physician Huang, we are preparing to inspect the princess.”</p>
