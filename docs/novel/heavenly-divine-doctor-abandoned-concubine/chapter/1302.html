<p>Ye Zhen was not ugly, but she had a darker complexion compared to the women in the capital. Still, among the girls of the Lu Family, she was the one with the most beautiful features.</p>
<p>It was a pity though that aside from her dark skin, she was also thin from her illness making her look frail and unhealthy. Fortunately, she had a pair of captivating, bright eyes that made her appear livelier.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu smiled with pride at Madam Chen’s words. “Our girl is quite good. Yaoyao has just returned from the border town, but she has already become a student of none other than Teacher Shan!”</p>
<p>Madam Chen actually looked down upon the Lu Family kind. Old Madam Lu, for example, wished everyone knew that her family was of nobility thus, she only wore things of luxury. All-day long, she wanted to be thought of as at par with the famous families in the capital, but she didn’t know that everyone was secretly mocking.</p>
<p>But who would have thought the Lu Family would be raised to a <sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>high-ranking imperial concubine, and Lu Lingzhi would become the most valued courtiers of the new emperor?</p>
<p>At a young age, Lu Lingzhi became the assistant minister at the Ministry of War, and there were talks circulating that he would become a minister in two years’ time.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t expect Old Madam Lu to show her off as her granddaughter so bluntly. Her cheeks were slightly hot from the attention, but she still smiled and held her hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the other hand, Teacher Shan spared Ye Zhen a light look, appreciating her calm and somewhat natural reaction.</p>
<p>When they went inside, a line of people greeted them simultaneously as they passed. When they made their way towards the garden, the rich fragrance of flowers filled the air and greeted them delightfully.</p>
<p>Amidst the sea of flowers in front of them were two or three groups of beautifully dressed guests. In the open space, a bamboo shed was set up, and under it was a banquet table filled with various fruits and wine.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu’s appearance, however, quieted the crowd around them.</p>
<p>Soon, a young woman in bright clothes came up and said, “Old Madam Lu, you are finally here! Madam Wu has been talking about you for a long time, she also said that if you wouldn’t come today, she would have to go to your mansion to fetch you herself!”</p>
<p>“Madam Wu should not play jokes on me, an Old Madam! How dare I come not to the Flower Appreciation Meet held by Madam Wu this year?” Old Madam replied joyfully.</p>
<p>Every year, different persons preside over the Flower Appreciation Meet, all of whom were chosen by the empress herself.</p>
<p>This year, however, the palace was without an empress, and the person in charge of the harem was, of course, Imperial Concubine Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>Who knew when the wang fei would be appointed as the empress in the future?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen understood that this was the reason why no one wanted to offend the Lu Family.</p>
<p>In fact, everyone seemed to strive to be on their good side, even the previous friends of the Ye Family.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen tailed Old Madam Lu, and silently asked to excuse herself from the party, she then went elsewhere, alone.</p>
<p>The ladies under the bamboo shed saw Old Madam Lu and got up one after another to greet her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at this scene, and her heart ached. When had these aristocratic women in the capital felt the need to bow before her like this? Just because the Lu Family had made a contribution to the imperial palace and had Lu Wushuang become the wang fei, they seemed to have forgotten the Ye Family!</p>
<p>Looking at Old Madam Lu’s face, Ye Zhen noted that the former couldn’t hide her satisfied smile as she exchanged greetings with everyone. Ye Zhen was sad, for herself, and also for the family she could never be with again.</p>
<p>However, Ye Zhen admitted to herself that the Lu Family had had better vision than most people. For who would have thought that the unpredictable prince of the Qin dynasty would have the ability to rebel and usurp the throne!</p>
<p>Lu Fang and Lu Jing exchanged glances when they saw so many distinguished ladies present. They both saw the excitement in each other’s eyes at the scene unfolding before them.</p>
<p>They took a step forward and squeezed their way through, pushing Ye Zhen aside in the process.</p>
<p>Seeing her granddaughters, Old Madam Lu said with a proud smile, “These are my granddaughters. Pay your respects, ladies, quickly!”</p>
<p>“Greetings to the ladies.” Both of them spoke with gentle and sweet smiles on their faces, trying to present their best faces to the public.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen followed in paying her respects, although she stood silently behind them and did not speak a word.</p>
<p>“These are your granddaughters? They are indeed beautiful just like Wang Fei Lu! As expected of your granddaughters, for where else would they go but high places?” Madam Wu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“They have not reached far, as compared to my dear Lu Wushuang who is already at a high place.” Old Madam Lu replied for she sensed it was appropriate to appear modest at times.</p>
<p>Old Madam Wu’s eyes fell behind Old Madam Lu and settled on Ye Zhen’s face, the former’s eyes widened in surprise before she uttered.</p>
<p>“This girl, it seems, I haven’t seen her before!”</p>
