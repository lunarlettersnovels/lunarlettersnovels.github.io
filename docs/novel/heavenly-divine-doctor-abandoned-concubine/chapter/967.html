            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 362 – Rewards (2)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen advised Old Madam Lu to rest.</p>
<p>As Wang Shi had something to tell her mother-in-law, she said to Ye Zhen, “Yaoyao, Mother has me here. Go and see Lingzhi.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother did not have a good rest last night, and she can’t be tired today.” Ye Zhen didn’t know what Wang Shi was up to, but by the looks of it, she was able to discern the other obviously didn’t have concern for the old madam.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu said to Wang Shi, “Aren’t you going to leave in two days? Go. The third household is here. You and your second child can go to Jinkou City.”</p>
<p>Wang Shi lamented in her heart. How could she leave the capital at this time? In case Lu Lingzhi died, who would inherit the title? He wasn’t married yet, so he would have to pass the title to his brother. Even if she didn’t fight for her son, she would fight for their Second Household.</p>
<p>“Mother, how can we go peacefully to Jinkou city now? During these times, we cannot lack pillars to stand for this family. Now is the time we have to take care of each other,” Wang Shi said.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu didn’t say anything and simply turned to Ye Zhen. “Help me rest on the bed.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips with a smile. “Okay, Grandmother. I’ll prepare a calming tea for you. You’ll have a good sleep after drinking it.”</p>
<p>“Just call a maid to do that,” Old Madam Lu said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’ll prepare it myself.” Ye Zhen insisted. Otherwise, how would she have the chance to add <em>lingquan</em> to the tea?</p>
<p>Wang Shi saw how this granddaughter was very close to her grandmother. She curled her lips disdainfully. <em>Indeed, Old Madam has her favor for the third household. This explains why she treats Yaoyao so differently. Even Gui Fei Lu is not this close to Old Madam.</em></p>
<p>While Ye Zhen was preparing the tea, Wang Shi took the opportunity and sat down beside the old madam’s bed. “Mother, will Lingzhi really get better?”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu snorted calmly. “Of course he will get better! I know what you’re thinking. You don’t have to think about it. It’s not your turn.”</p>
<p>Wang Shi’s face turned white. She did not expect the old madam to be this sharp. Even though she was old, she was not someone to be trifled with. Wang Shi hadn’t even spoken yet, and the matriarch had seen through her facade.</p>
<p>“Mother, I didn’t say anything,” Wang Shi said, embarrassed, “how do you know what I’m going to say?”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu just closed her eyes. “I don’t know what you are trying to say.”</p>
<p>Wang Shi did not dare to say anymore. “Mother, have a rest. I won’t disturb you.”</p>
<p>“Go to Jinkou city with the second child. The pillars of our family can still handle things well,” Old Madam Lu said without opening her eyes.</p>
<p>A defeated Wang Shi fled with a white face, she walked past Ye Zhen who was returning with tea.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen served the tea to Old Madam Lu. “What’s wrong with Second Aunt? She doesn’t look fine.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps she’s not feeling well,” Old Madam Lu said with a faint smile. She drank the tea and asked her to go see Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked after her grandmother until she fell asleep before she left. She didn’t want to see Lu Lingzhi, but thinking of Pei Shi’s working hard to take care of him, she had to go and see her.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked a little more energetic today than the past couple of days. Basking in the sun in the courtyard, he saw Ye Zhen coming. His thin handsome face revealed a gentle smile. “Yaoyao, why are you back?”</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother looks better today.” Ye Zhen smiled back at him. She looked behind him and asked, “Are Mother and Imperial Physician Qi around?”</p>
<p>“Imperial Physician Qi had some matters to attend to, she just left. I asked Third Aunt to go back and have a rest. She didn’t sleep all night last night,” Lu Lingzhi said sheepishly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him for a while. “I met Gui Fei Lu yesterday.”</p>
<p>The emotions in Lu Lingzhi’s eyes slightly changed. He frowned and said, “Why did you go see her? She didn’t do anything to you, did she?”</p>
<p>“She didn’t do anything to me, but she is not doing very well in the palace,” Ye Zhen said lightly. “She asked me to ask His Imperial Majesty to see her.”</p>
<p>“The emperor … refused to see Shuang’er?” Lu Lingzhi was alarmed. <em>How did this happen? Does the emperor already know that Shuang’er was not the one who saved him?</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “Yes, Empress Dowager and the emperor are being good to Xianfei Xu.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s eyebrows wrinkled up. He hadn’t imagined Lu Wushuang falling out of favor this soon. He knew it couldn’t be because the emperor liked the new and hated the old. <em>The emperor might know …</em></p>
<p>“However, I think the emperor will still favor Gui Fei Lu again, so you don’t have to worry.” Ye Zhen comforted him with a smile.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi shook his head with a wry smile. He knew Mo Rongzhan too well. Once he hated someone, there was no room for reversals.</p>
<p>What worried him more was Mo Rongzhan knowing the whole truth, although it was unlikely.</p>
