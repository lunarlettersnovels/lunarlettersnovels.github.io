            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 345 – Return to the Capital (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Yaoyao, don’t move.” Lu Shiming hurriedly cried out. “Let your elder brother drink the medicine first.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t move, body stiff and motionless in Lu Lingzhi’s arms. Despite her stiffness, she was still able to feel the tremor that was wrecking the other’s body. From just that, she could assume he must truly be in pain.</p>
<p>At this time, Lu Shiming had walked over with the medicine and said, “Just wait until you drink everything, then it won’t hurt anymore.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, quickly take the medicine.” Ye Zhen, who was being held in the other’s arms, urged while feeling ill all over her body. She simply wanted to push him away immediately.</p>
<p>However, Lu Lingzhi was hugging her tightly as if doing so could alleviate the pain he was in. But under Lu Shiming’s persuasion, he obediently drank the medicine and soon passed out.</p>
<p>Taking the chance, Ye Zhen didn’t waste a breath in pushing him away and stood far away, staring at the man who had fainted on top of the bed. Her eyes dark, only wishing he had died from pain.</p>
<p>Qi Jin and the others did not notice this change in Ye Zhen though. They were only focused on looking at Lu Lingzhi and properly rebandaging his wound.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Capital, The Imperial Palace</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan, with deep eyes, was looking at the secret report in his hand.</p>
<p><em>Unexpectedly, that little girl has really gone to Jinwu City! She can just not sit still even for a moment!</em></p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, Marquis Anyang suffers from Qitiantong poisoning, it is an extremely potent poison. It can’t be completely neutralized by the fire lotus,” Tang Zhen said, frowning as he bowed his head. He couldn’t help but worry as he thought about the injuries of his good friend.</p>
<p>“Have someone collect all of the Qijie grass in the capital and send it over.” Mo Rongzhan instructed.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this official shall personally deliver it,” Tang Zhen said.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan immediately recalled that Tang Zhen seemed to wish to become Lu Family’s son-in-law. So, he looked up at his confidant and said, “I heard that Princess Fu Rong also went to Jinwu City.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen’s eyes abruptly lit up in delight as he said, “I didn’t know.”</p>
<p>“Ah Zhen, you seem to be at the right age for marriage?” Mo Rongzhan asked while thinking over which girl in the imperial family would be suitable for marriage. He wanted Tang Zhen to give up early on, so he wouldn’t always think about Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, you wish to bestow marriage for this official?” Tang Zhen asked, excited, thinking that the emperor wanted to marry him and Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Although becoming a <em>fuma*</em> meant one couldn’t involve oneself with state matter, he didn’t care. As long as he could marry Lu Yaoyao, it was worth it.<br>
[*fuma = princess consort, wang fei = prince consort]</p>
<p>“Are you interested in someone?” Mo Rongzhan asked, probingly.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen glanced at Mo Rongzhan and asked with a low and expectant voice, “Your Imperial Majesty, can this official pay his esteem to the princess?”</p>
<p><em>There is only one princess in the entirety of Jin Empire right now!</em> Mo Rongzhan’s handsome face immediately turned black, realizing who Tang Zhen was talking about. Still, he asked, “Which princess do you want to esteem?”</p>
<p>“Princess Fu Rong,” said Tang Zhen immediately, eyes earnest as he continued confessing, “I have admired her for a long time.”</p>
<p><em>To be enamored with her for a long time… </em>Mo Rongzhan’s eyebrows twitched a few times.</p>
<p>“We are unable to make a decision for Yaoyao’s marriage. Wait until her return to talk about this again,” Mo Rongzhan said with a voice that was as cold as the tundra. However, when she returned, he was determined to clearly ask what she thought of Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>Standing quietly on the side, Eunuch Fu hung his head low, silently lighting a candle for Marquis Jing Ning in his heart. <em>How can the emperor let anyone marry Princess Fu Rong?</em></p>
<p>At this moment, Eunuch Fu was the only one in the entirety of Jin to be aware of the emperor’s thoughts regarding Princess Fu Rong.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen was oblivious as to what the emperor’s heart was thinking about. For ever since Lu Yaoyao was titled a princess, all he had been thinking was when he could stand before the empress dowager, so he would be able to become the <em>fuma</em>.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, this official will take the Qijie grass over immediately,” Tang Zhen said happily. He couldn’t wait to see Lu Yaoyao when he arrived at Jinwu City. He had to explain it clearly to her, otherwise who knew how long she would stay angry with him.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to take it. The report indicates the injury has been stabilized, so they should be back soon,” Mo Rongzhan lightly said, halting Tang Zhen’s thought.</p>
<p>Despite being somewhat disappointed, Tang Zhen still loyally responded in agreement.</p>
