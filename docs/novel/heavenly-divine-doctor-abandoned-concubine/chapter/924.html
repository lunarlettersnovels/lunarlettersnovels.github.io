            <p><strong>Chapter 405 – In Danger (2)</strong></p>
<p>Eunuch Fu had already told someone to ready his horse a long time ago. At the time he had heard that Tang Zhen was going to the hunting grounds as well, he had known the emperor would not be able to sit unbothered.</p>
<p>As expected, he really was the emperor’s right-hand eunuch.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan changed into a fitted, deep purple silk robe. There were a couple of clouds embroidered on the sleeves and on the body, making him seem evermore tall and sculpted. His entire body radiated a domineering aura, and his gaze was, as always, cold and aloof. When he walked out of the Palace of Heavenly Purity, a white stallion was already standing ready for him.</p>
<p>He cleanly mounted the horse, galloping out of the palace quickly as Eunuch Fu and the rest of the servants hurriedly rushed to follow him.</p>
<p>At this time, Ye Zhen and the others had already begun forming teams for competition in the forest of the hunting grounds. She led Mo Rongyi and two other noble children, while Tang Zhen led the other two. The guards, including Hong Ying, each hunted on their own. Whoever had the most catches would be rewarded by the little prince.</p>
<p>Everyone was immediately excited, preparing to show off their skills.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen turned with a smile to look at Ye Zhen. “Yaoyao, I lost to you last time. This time, I won’t let you off so easily.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be so haughty. Marquis Jing Ning, please, try your best,” Ye Zhen said flatly.</p>
<p>“All right!” Tang Zhen smiled, looking at her tenderly.</p>
<p>The sunlight fell on her figure, making her skin seem evermore pure jade-like, emphasizing her prettiness as bright as the height of spring. He would never be able to forget the amazement he had felt the first time he had seen her. She had been flying on horseback then, like a startled swallow, a flying dragon. His heart had stirred at first glance, and in a moment, he had fallen forever.</p>
<p>She asked him if he was willing to give up the wealth and prosperity in the capital and leave with her. Tang Zhen had once thought that this was a hard question. But he found that he didn’t have a sliver of hesitation within himself. He wanted to be with her. Just being with her was better than any of that.</p>
<p>“Let’s go!” Ye Zhen could feel Tang Zhen’s brilliant gaze. She blushed and looked away, speaking to Mo Rongyi.</p>
<p>“Giddyup!” Mo Rongyi shouted, “I want to hunt a deer today, and give its hide to Imperial Mother to make a set of sleeves.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him with a smile. “Then aim and shoot. Don’t ruin the hide. It’s best if you can kill it with a single arrow.”</p>
<p>“Don’t look down on me!” Mo Rongyi coldly snorted, the two teams grew further and further apart.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was here to accompany Mo Rongyi today. She didn’t really want to shoot that much prey. However, seeing as they were competing, naturally, she couldn’t lose.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, there are no deer here. Let’s go further in the forest to see.” Mo Rongyi had shot two rabbits but still didn’t find the sika deer he wanted and was a little disappointed.</p>
<p>“The deeper we go, the harder it’ll be to trek. Are you sure you want to go?” The hunting grounds surrounded the forest. Although they had already been closed off to prevent the entry of any beasts, the deep forest was still seldom entered by any other than true master hunters.</p>
<p>“Seeing as we are out to hunt, we must enjoy ourselves. Do you want to lose to Marquis Jing Ning?” Mo Rongyi said.</p>
<p>“Then, you stay here, and I’ll help you check if there are sika deer?” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>“The Little Prince is brave and strong. You will definitely be able to hunt a sika deer.” The guards at the side smiled, rooting for Mo Rongyi.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi puffed up his chest, saying to Ye Zhen, “Does a big man like me still need your protection? I have so many guards by me. How could something happen?”</p>
<p><em>A big man?</em> Ye Zhen almost laughed. “All right then, we’ll go over there for a look.”</p>
<p>After all, though the hunting grounds were large, they were still very safe. However, she was a little confused. The last time she had come here to hunt, she had seen many herds of deer. Why hadn’t she seen a single one today?</p>
<p><em>Had they all gone to where Tang Zhen was?</em></p>
<p>They were trotting on a little road shielded on both sides with towering trees. The path only allowed two people at a time. Mo Rongyi was with a guard, and Ye Zhen with Hong Ying.</p>
<p>It was quiet on both sides of the road, and they didn’t even see a rabbit or a mountain chicken. Ye Zhen slightly squinted, looking at the sides. The suspicion in her heart grew greater by the moment.</p>
<p>“A’Yi—” She wanted Mo Rongyi take the road back. Something was off with the hunting fields today.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi looked back, wanting to ask Ye Zhen what was wrong. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw two shadows move from along the side of the road. He shouted out loud, “Yaoyao, look out!”</p>
<p>Numerous men clad in black rushed out from the forests, raising their blades to kill Mo Rongyi and Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Hong Ying and the other guards immediately drew their swords, forming a circle around Ye Zhen and Mo Rongyi.</p>
<p>“Who comes? How audacious of you to dare attempt to harm the little prince here?” Ye Zhen sternly asked the masked figures.</p>
<p>Their answer was an increasingly fierce display of swordwork.</p>
<p>These people were highly skilled in martial arts, perhaps even more than these guards. Ye Zhen took a hold of Mo Rongyi’s hand. “Let’s go.”</p>
