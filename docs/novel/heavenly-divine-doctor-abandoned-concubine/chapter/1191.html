            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 136 – An Incident On The Road</strong></p>
<p>How could she have a bad life in the Lu Family now? No one among them knew her real identity. Even Lu Shiming and Pei Shi were clueless that she was the daughter of the Ye Family.</p>
<p>Therefore, how could anyone act hostile towards her? With the exception of the Lu misses who were deeply envious towards her of course.</p>
<p>Moreover, she had been enjoying the wealth and glamor of the family, all brought about by Lu Lingzhi, who earned it by stepping on the flesh and blood of the Ye Family!</p>
<p>“Miss, do you still want to live with the Lu Family now? This handmaiden wants to come back to you… “Hong Ling pleaded.</p>
<p>Now that she knew her mistress was still alive, she wanted things to be just as it was before—her serving and protecting Young Miss Ye.</p>
<p>“There is just no way.” Ye Zhen looked at her previous handmaiden solemnly in the eye.</p>
<p>“Lu Lingzhi has seen you before. If he sees you by my side, he will definitely suspect. Besides, I will be attending the School of Medicine at the Academy for Women and therefore, you will be my eyes outside of it.”</p>
<p>Hong Ling asked, “What does Miss need this handmaiden to do?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced around in melancholy. “I started this precious business thinking that I could follow the steps of the previous Empress Duanhui, Qi Yanling, and to have something to be busy about… something that could boost my self-worth. But now, this is the only thing that is left of me.”</p>
<p>“Although Father said that the execution of our family is inevitable, how can I be worthy of being called a miss of the Ye Family if I wasn’t able to save them? My uncle had sinned but my father, brother, and the rest of the clan had not.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Hong Ling said hastily, “Miss, how do you want your revenge to transpire?”</p>
<p>“It’s a little early to talk about revenge.” She answered firmly. “Just remember that if we keep a low profile, it will tighten my grip on the chance of getting my family’s deserved retribution.”</p>
<p>Hong Ling quickly understood.</p>
<p>“Why did Miss decide to enter the School of Medicine?” Hong Ling asked doubtfully, knowing that Ye Zhen had been educated before and had never shown interest in the field of medicine.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen tapped her finger on the table in a slow rhythm. “I have planned to go and live inside the imperial palace.”</p>
<p>Eyes bulged in surprise, Hong Ling almost cried in disbelief. “Miss!”</p>
<p><i>Hasn’t this miss given up on Mo Rongzhan? </i></p>
<p><i>In the beginning, the young miss had insisted on marrying the current Emperor of Qin, but the man didn’t even take a look at her! Despite what happened to her and her family, was the miss still infatuated with him?</i></p>
<p>Right away, Ye Zhen knew what Hong Ling was thinking. She smiled lightly. “If I don’t enter the palace, how will I get my revenge? With your current status and mine, how can we fight against an emperor and an assistant war minister? I want to be an imperial physician to step foot inside the imperial palace.”</p>
<p>“Young Miss, that is too risky!” Hong Ling said worriedly.</p>
<p>The people in the palace would recognize Ye Zhen as the deceased Wang Fei of the Qin Dynasty. The things Mo Rongzhan could do, Hong Ling was most terrified.</p>
<p>“Now, if I don’t do anything, is there no danger? Hong Ling, I am no longer Ye Zhen, the pampered daughter of the Ye Family.”</p>
<p>Hong Ling only felt too distressed about Ye Zhen. “Miss, as soon as we find the Second Lord, everything will be all right.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen touched Hong Ling’s head. “At this time, I can only trust Man Qin and Tian Jiu. Please go have a trip to Jinkou city and give them my letter.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss.” Hong Ling immediately nodded yes and prepared paper and ink for Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen started writing a letter and sealed it with wax. “We must hand it over to Man Qin and Tian Jiu. Don’t let others know.”</p>
<p>Hong Ling nodded cautiously.</p>
<p>“My maid will be back soon. I can’t stay here for too long. I must go now”</p>
<p>Hong Ling looked serious. “Miss, this handmaiden knows what to do.”</p>
<p>“Bring me some bottles of perfume.”</p>
<p>Since she came here to try perfume, it was only natural that she buy a few bottles to avoid suspicion.</p>
<p>“Miss, this perfume was brought from Persia. Try it.” Hong Ling packed several bottles for Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen came downstairs with the perfume and as soon as she walked out of the door, she saw Dai Mei coming hurriedly. “Third Miss, this maidservant is back!”</p>
<p>“I just finished shopping too. Take this.” Ye Zhen handed the perfumes to Dai Mei.</p>
<p>Turning back to Hong Ling, she said meaningfully, “If this perfume is to my mother’s liking, I will return here to buy some more.”</p>
<p>Hong Ling smiled. “Third Miss Lu, don’t worry. I assure you that Third Madam Lu will not be disappointed.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded with a smile. “Indeed, I must trust you.”</p>
<p>She took Dai Mei’s hand and got inside the carriage. She glanced at Hong Ling one more time and put down the curtain.</p>
<p>Dai Mei put the perfume aside. “Third Miss, there are cakes I have brought with me. Do you want some?”</p>
<p>“No, but thank you.” She refused kindly. “How is your family?”</p>
<p>“This maidservant’s brother is almost as well as before, and he will be fine in two days.” Dai Mei replied happily.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was in a good mood today, with a slight smile on her lip she spoke, “That’s good news!”</p>
<p>As the carriage continued to trudge forward, Ye Zhen closed her eyes wanting to have a quick respite. Suddenly, the carriage came to an abrupt halt, nearly rolling her all the way to the front. Fortunately, Dai Mei held her back and she didn’t hit her head hard against the wall.</p>
<p>“Third Miss, are you all right?” Dai Mei quickly asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen steadied herself and touched her forehead. “I’m fine, check what’s going on outside.”</p>
<p>Quan Fu, the coachman, could be heard rumbling in panic outside. “Are you all right, Third Miss? I just saw someone in the middle of the street so I quickly grabbed the horse. Are you… are you hurt?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. See if anyone is injured.”</p>
<p>Dai Mei lifted the curtain and went out. She saw a twitching child lying on the ground in front of her.</p>
<p>She was startled and asked Quan Fu, “Did you hit someone?”</p>
<p>One onlooker, a madam, said hastily, “He was lying on the ground before your carriage arrived!”</p>
<p>Quickly, Dai Mei got into the carriage and informed Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Third Miss, there is a child lying on the ground in front of the carriage writhing in pain perhaps! Quan Fu said our carriage didn’t hit him at all!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen subconsciously felt that the child outside should be ill. She frowned, desiring to mind her own business, she wanted Quan Fu to turn around and take another path. But before she could order so, she heard someone calling for help.</p>
<p>And in that second, her heart, hands, and feet seemed to have their own consciousness. She lifted the curtain and got off the carriage.</p>
<p>“Third Miss…” Dai Mei was somewhat startled. Seeing Ye Zhen getting out of the carriage, she quickly followed her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen saw people gathered around the child but no one seemed to have the intention to help. Finding Quan Fu among the crowd, she ordered him.</p>
<p>“Get these people out of the way. The heat will harm the child.”</p>
