<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 206 – In the Same Bed (1)</strong></p>
<p>The night was playing a strange game with the women of the Lu Family. Both were being tantalized by sleep; while it eluded one it refused to free the other. Here, Ye Zhen was forced to stay up, there Lu Wushuang was unable to sleep.</p>
<div data-id="tJZuoEHbnVfII7xXhRHr2oSfI0tpkzeFdFeoP4Lv_plMjCfDUd-8"></div>
<p>How could she when anxiety plagued her heart? Was it because of the several nights of solitude or the happenings of this evening alone? For some unknown reason, she had been feeling that something would happen tonight. She was at unease and vaguely flustered.</p>
<p>Knowing that Lu Wushuang was restless, Dai Ping walked in with quick steps and in a low voice called out.</p>
<p>“Your Highness…”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang immediately sat up straight. “What happened?”</p>
<p>She knew something must have happened for Dai Ping to come to her at this hour, and then there was that gnawing as well. Her heart was on the edge even before she heard the other say her piece.</p>
<p>“The servant sent to the little prince’s residence saw Eunuch Fu bring a maiden to the Palace of Heavenly Purity in the middle of the night.” Dai Ping reported.</p>

<p>“A maiden?” Lu Wushuang’s bright face was suddenly covered with dark clouds. “Is it a palace maid of the emperor?” She queried.</p>
<p>Dai Ping nodded softly. “The person who came to report said that the maiden’s clothes were like that of the head maid from the little prince’s residence…”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang abruptly stood up. “Come and dress me up for the emperor’s residence.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness?” Dai Ping was surprised<i>.</i></p>
<p><i>It is still late in the night, what does Wang Fei want to do?</i></p>
<p>“I am going to see which maiden dares be shameless in seducing the emperor when he visited the little prince!” Her shrill voice echoed through the quiet night sending chills to the ears it met.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s disregard for her these past few days, his cold-heartedness and indifference,  the empress dowager’s refusal to let her see Little Prince while he was there, one by one they bombarded sending her into a frenzy. Her anxiety transformed into wrath and an unlucky maid had to bear the brunt of it.</p>
<p><i>It must be that lowly maid! Had she not seduced the emperor, how could he not visit the Palace of Earthly Tranquility for several days on end?</i></p>
<p><i>She who has the audacity to climb the dragon couch right under my nose seems to be a cunning bitch!</i> <i>It’s impossible for the empress dowager to take part in this, otherwise, why did she not let me go to the little prince’s residence today?</i></p>
<p>When she recalled how resolute the empress dowager had been today, the way she had treated her behind her back, her hate for the old woman deepened.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, would not your visit to the emperor’s residence at this time upset him?” Dai Ping cautiously pointed out.</p>
<p>“This palace will deal with those shameless palace girls even if it would upset the emperor!”</p>
<p>Jealousy, fury, and indignation carried Lu Wushuang far and beyond. Tonight, she was a loose cannon on a mission to wreak havoc, she would obliterate anyone who stood in her path.</p>
<p>After changing her clothes, she took long strides out of the Palace of Earthly Tranquility. The calm night wind only fueled the inferno within.</p>
<p>Dai Ping hurried out with her, making a final attempt to avert the disaster. “Your Highness…”</p>
<p>Is it so easy to rein in a rogue beast and a delirious one at that? Needless to say, the prudent caveat fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>All Lu Wushuang wanted to know was which lowly maid had enchanted Mo Rongzhan to take her to the Place of Heavenly Purity. Even she herself… the most favoured one, the only one in his inner palace, had never spent the night in the Palace of Heavenly Purity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Palace of Heavenly Purity was oblivious to the storm heading its way. And the root of it was the serenest of them all.</p>
<p>After an arduous battle, Ye Zhen had finally given in to the exhaustion. Sitting on the stool, she had right royally dozed off. The discomfort of sleeping in a new place and on an uncomfortable seat in lieu for her bed, this fatigued soul seemed not to care a whit about it all and slept peacefully. How then would she notice that the master of the palace had woken up?</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan rubbed his eyes and was surprised to find that they felt much more comfortable. Even at night, his vision was no longer as blurred as before. He had to admit he was happy about it.</p>
<p><i>Lu Yaoyao, this girl… has some abilities.</i></p>
<p>He raised his eyes and looked at her lightly: her beautiful face without a trace of rouge, skin as white as porcelain, the small head dozing off little by little, and the slightly parted red lips… beckoning to take a bite.</p>
<p>He was shocked by his own thoughts. He frowned slightly. However, before he could go on a self-chastising spree, he noticed she was about to fall down… on a reflex, he swiftly lunged and caught her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen fell softly into his arms and on an impulse, he brought her closer to his chest. Broad and sturdy, she accepted the comfort and warmth, her cheek rubbed against his chest several times before she fell deep into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>She was very petite, at least for the Mo Rongzhan who had a strong build, her whole body could compactly curl up in his arms. He picked her up and looked at her sweet sleeping visage with eyes downcast, a part of his heart turned soft.</p>
<p>He had never felt so soft-hearted towards any woman.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty…” Eunuch Fu looked at Mo Rongzhan in astonishment. “This old slave shall bring Miss Lu back.”</p>
<p>“No!” Mo Rongzhan coldly replied, slightly tightening his arms, unwilling to hand over the charming creature in his arms.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu was shocked further. He was unsure if his eyes were playing him… <i>Was that a touch of tenderness he saw in the eyes of the ever callous emperor?</i></p>
<p>He had never seen such a look not even when facing the wang fei. <i>Why then was he looking at Lu Yaoyao this way?</i></p>
<p><i>Does the emperor know that Lu Yaoyao looks exactly like the late wang fei?</i></p>
