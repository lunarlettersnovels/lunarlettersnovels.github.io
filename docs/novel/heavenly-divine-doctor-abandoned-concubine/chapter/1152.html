            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 175 – Snow (1)</strong></p>
<p>Gao Xueping moved out of the room she was supposed to share with Ye Zhen and was then assigned to another by Aunt Wen. Undoubtedly, it was a hard day for her; she left in haste and with a bitter heart.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, on the other hand, was pleased. Rather than share, she preferred living alone. This way, she would not have to fret about being discovered while concocting medicines. Her effort at getting rid of Gao Xueping proved worthwhile.</p>
<p>“If only my mother would let me live in the academy.”</p>
<p>Currently, the three women, who had grown fond of one another, were enjoying a pot of hot tea–a delightful refreshment during cold afternoons.</p>
<p>Sun Wen was envious that the other students, like her friend Ye Zhen, had the liberty to live in the academy without being restricted by their families.</p>
<p>“Will your mother not let you stay here in school?” Chen Jinru who was holding a cup of steaming tea glanced at Sun Wen.</p>
<p>The latter sighed with a heavy heart; her face crumpling for just a little at the remorseful thought that came to her.</p>
<p>“Mother says that she has looked after me for fifteen years and will continue to do so until I wed. But soon, I must convince her. Else, I would know not a thing about independence.” Her nose scrunched up. “Ah! But, I fear she would not agree. She has always bound me with her rules. This life is too painful, really!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her with a smile. “Sun Wen, perhaps, those rules exist for your well-being. Where is the pain in that?”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, are you not forced to follow rules that are not particularly to your liking, back at your home?” Sun Wen asked, unconvinced.</p>
<p>“Some rules exist for your benefit. You may not like them, yet, they are a necessity. Just like a person who dislikes eating something distasteful, yet eats only for survival.” Ye Zhen spoke softly, gently gazing out of the window.</p>
<p>It was just past noon, but the sky outside seemed a tad heavier than usual. Judging from the gloomy weather, it would not be too long before the snow covered the paths of the academy.</p>
<p>With eyes full of fondness, Sun Wen looked at her. “Yaoyao, what you said is very reasonable, but what if I am unable to do it?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen retracted her gaze from the scenery outside and faced Sun Wen, who looked impressed by her recent words. She grinned. “Unable to do? Is it hard for you to eat?”</p>
<p>“It is not difficult. I will die if I do not eat, after all.” Sun Wen retorted in jest.</p>
<p>Seeing the two banter, Chen Jinru chuckled aloud. “Rules can be complicated, but in this academy, as long as you study hard, your life could, perhaps, be easy.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of an easy life, I, in fact, prefer to live in Yumen Pass, enjoy life and be in the company of horses. There, I do not need to look at other people’s faces nor listen to words that I cannot comprehend.”</p>
<p>Sun Wen faintly expressed her disappointment. Her father was only a garrison. Even so, he commanded respect in Yumen Pass. This only changed when they moved to the capital where he was regarded as nothing.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ye Zhen’s interest piqued. Truth be told, she knew nothing about her new friend, Sun Wen and this was the first time she had heard her speak about herself.</p>
<p>“Why then did you come to the School of Medicine?”</p>
<p>“I want to be a physician in the army in Yumen Pass.” Sun Wen bore her heart out, her cheeks reddening a little. “You do not know, there are only a few physicians who tend to the soldiers suffering from injuries… Many die helplessly without aid…”</p>
<p>With this, Ye Zhen’s impression of Sun Wen immediately changed. She was under the belief this girl came to the academy only to gain the reputation of a scholarly woman. It turned out, she had compassion for others, a trait most women in the academy were found wanting.</p>
<p>“If you have such a kind heart, then I wish you all success in the future.”</p>
<p>“Thank you…but, women are a forbidden existence in the army. I am just delusional.” Sun Wen shook her head in dismay. The fervent fire within her suddenly put out.</p>
