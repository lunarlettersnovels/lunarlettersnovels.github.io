            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 22 – I Am The Best (2)</h3>
<p>Ye Zhen flashed a firm and confident smile. “Then it’s a deal. I don’t need Eldest Brother to take care of my affairs.” She declared.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao?” Lu Lingzhi frowned upon recognizing her tone of sudden estrangement and resistance to him.</p>
<p>“If there is nothing else, I have to go back to practice calligraphy,” Ye Zhen said, taking advantage of this opportunity to strain her relationship with her supposed cousin before it even buds.</p>
<p>In this way, she didn’t have to respectfully pretend to be congenial to him in the next meetings to come.</p>
<p>The heavens know how hard it was to stop herself from thinking of the crimes he had committed against her and her family. An ounce of respect from her was the most she could give, that too for the sake of her disguise!</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s eyes slightly sank upon seeing Ye Zhen giving him the cold shoulder.</p>
<p>“Do you resent your eldest brother because of this?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I dare not feel that. After all, you are doing it for my own good, I know.” Ye Zhen flattered and lied without even flinching.</p>
<p>“People are most afraid of being compared… You will soon realize that Eldest Brother is really looking after your own good.”</p>
<p>The Fourth Miss, Lu Jing, was a famous figure in the academy and people would definitely compare Lu Yaoyao with her as they shared the same surname.</p>
<p>What was even worse was that people would see her resemblance to the late Wang Fei of the Qin Dynasty. If she were ever to be compared to her former self, then she better surpass her former achievements as Ye Zhen.</p>
<p><i>What a burden!</i></p>
<p>Bearing close resemblance but  not as good as the late wang fei, she would be considered as a mere copycat in the future! These comparisons were not good for a fifteen-year-old girl who had so much at her hands; the prospects of marriage.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen understood what Lu Lingzhi meant. She smiled a confident smile and said, “Eldest Brother, do not fret. I have always thought<i> I am the best.</i>“</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was taken aback. That smile, he could never forget. <i>What are the odds, their smile was also uncannily similar!</i></p>
<p>When he wanted to see the expression again, Ye Zhen had already lowered her head.</p>
<p>“I’ll go back to practice calligraphy first, Eldest Brother, I won’t keep you any longer.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned around and went out to only see Teacher Shan standing in the courtyard. She wondered if she had heard their conversation.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi came out from behind her and saw Teacher Shan frowning slightly, but he didn’t say anything. He just strode out of the yard without acknowledging the teacher’s presence.</p>
<p>Calming herself, Ye Zhen’s eyes sought serenity in the courtyard. Her eyes rested on the flower bed in the yard where small clusters of flowers and plants grew so well that even the withered chrysanthemum had sprouted back to life.</p>
<p>She looked at her palm with drooped lids. It seemed that the drops emerging from the eye of the phoenix tattoo were spiritual springs.</p>
<p>Since the wound she had was cured and the liquid could foster the growth of plants and bring the withered ones to health, her lips went dry as an imminent idea came to her– <i>would it do the same to humans?</i></p>
<p>“What made you want to study at the Academy for Women?” Teacher Shan spoke without warning.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen faced her while hiding her hand behind her. Then she slowly and carefully looked up at Teacher Shan’s inquisitive eyes.</p>
<p>“I want to enter the palace by becoming an imperial physician, that is all.” She tried to sound as honest as possible.</p>
<p>The reason why some women strove hard to become a physician was that the profession would buy them a key towards living inside the imperial palace. It would bring great honor to their families. At the same time, they would be entitled, and experience a life of luxury for as long as they wanted!</p>
<p>Teacher Shan smiled faintly. After looking at Ye Zhen for a long time, her smile deepened.</p>
<p>“Well, I can help you with that. But in order to become an imperial physician, I want you to do something for me. Can you promise me?”</p>
<p>“Okay. What is it?” Ye Zhen nodded without hesitation.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan seemed satisfied with her soft tone of reply. “I will help you pass the entrance examination in the shortest possible time starting from tomorrow. Besides the Six and Four Arts, you still have something to learn.”</p>
<p>“And you are referring to?” Ye Zhen asked in curiosity.</p>
<p>“Beauty! I want you to take good care of yourself and to be at the pink of your health.”</p>
<p>The academy favored those who are considered beautiful according to the standards. Teacher Shan saw potential in her, and she hated to see it go waste.</p>
<p>This was also what Ye Zhen wanted so she smiled brightly and said, “Yes please, Teacher Shan.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>For the next two days, Ye Zhen didn’t go anywhere without the company of books and Teacher Shan.</p>
<p>She woke up every day to train and learn the Six and Four Arts. What she was taught was no longer new to her. Yet, she had to hide herself.</p>
<p>Obviously, she was the best at it, but had to pretend to not understand a thing at first.</p>
<p>After studying for two days, the day for the Flower Appreciation Meet has come. Teacher Shan, who had no interest in flowers, felt obligated to attend. Old Madam Lu invited her to accompany her to the event.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan and Old Madam Lu shared a carriage while Ye Zhen was with the two Miss Lus. But it seems that today, the other girl, Lu Jing, was not happy to be in the same carriage with her.</p>
<p>“Second Sister and Fourth Sister.” Ye Zhen took the initiative to greet them and curtsied.</p>
<p>Lu Jing looked up at Ye Zhen and said, “I thought my third sister would not go to the flower meet today. After all, studying with Teacher Shan for the past two days, you must already be brilliant, I assume!”</p>
<p>Her tone sounded curt but Ye Zhen only found it funny. “Fourth Sister, I have only learned for two days. I am not a genius.”</p>
<p>Lu Fang smiled and said, “Third Sister, you have my best wishes. With Teacher Shan, you will surely pass.”</p>
<p>“People who have studied for two or three years may still not be able to pass the exam.” Lu Jing retorted with a sneer and added.</p>
<p>“It’s a pity that Teacher Shan’s good reputation is going to be tarnished by Third Sister’s insolence!”</p>
