            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 341 – Do I Look Good?</strong></p>
<p>“That’s exactly how I said it. Do you have any problem?” Ye Zhen coldly looked at him, her line of sight turned to the portrait on the tabletop.</p>
<p><em>It’s Tian Jiu!</em> Although she hadn’t seen Tian Jiu for a long time, once she saw the portrait she recognized it was him.</p>
<p>“You!” Luo You wanted to teach this little girl a lesson.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi stopped him. “You all go down. This is my sister, Princess Fu Rong.”</p>
<p><em>“—” Princess Fu Rong? The Lu Family seems… to have a princess. It must be this girl before us.</em></p>
<p>Ye Zhen was too lazy to pay attention to them. She went over and put the medicine on the small table next to him and looked at Lu Lingzhi coldly. “What assassin are you looking for when you are hurt like this? Are people still waiting for you to catch him?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi waved his hand to dismiss the deputy generals. Those people gave Ye Zhen a salute and quickly took the portrait away. Offending the princess was not a joke.</p>
<p>“The assassin was injured. If the person who saved him still wants him to live, he would not run too far and will definitely stay and heal.” Lu Lingzhi whispered and looked at the little girl’s face, thinking that she was concerned about him. “I’m listening to you and I’ll take good care of the injury.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen actually didn’t care if he recuperated properly. She was only worried about whether Tian Jiu would hide in the same place as he said. <em>What must she do if Lu Lingzhi catches him?</em></p>
<p>“Take the medicine,” she said simply while giving the medicines prescribed by Qi Jin. She had seen the dregs, and determined that the concoction would only serve to heal his wound quickly and not actually aid in getting rid of the residual poison.</p>
<p>He looked at her with a smile. “I feel sorry for letting the princess prepare my medicine for me.”</p>
<p>“I am taking care of you because of Grandmother,” Ye Zhen said coldly. She already knew what poison was in him. It was Qitiantong*. As long as the residual poison was not cleared, Lu Lingzhi would be tortured by it. Each time the poison attacked, it would only get worse every time.</p>
<p>[T/N: The names of poison in ancient times were usually literal and descriptive. Qitiantong means ‘seven days pain’]</p>
<p><em>It seems that Tian Jiu didn’t mean to kill Lu Lingzhi, but wanted to torture and make him suffer.</em></p>
<p>The residual poison of Qitiantong was not so easy to cleanse. Besides, it was his shoulder that was injured. Perhaps the poison had invaded his heart. As to how the poison would torment him was uncertain.</p>
<p>He smiled gently. “I’ll write to Grandmother, otherwise she will still be worried.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t tell her that you were poisoned,” she said.</p>
<p>“Well, don’t let Grandmother know.” He nodded.</p>
<p>She took the brush and ink, and moved the table for him, and asked him to write a short letter.</p>
<p>“I’ll write another letter and have it sent to Grandmother immediately,” Ye Zhen said softly.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi nodded with a smile and took the medicines she had prepared. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“How can you still smile?” she asked, wondering. <em>When he should be suffering from pain, it seems that nothing happened to him.</em> <em>Does he feel no pain at all</em>? “</p>
<p>“It’s already like this, should I cry instead of smile?” Lu Lingzhi’s jestingly asked. “There is one more thing I’d like to thank you for. Fortunately, the vulnerary you gave me didn’t run out. When Imperial Physician Qi hadn’t arrived yet, I applied your medicine, and the wound didn’t sting—”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s face turned black all of a sudden. In order to make him fight in the west, she had given him a vulnerary with <em>linquan</em> in it. She hoped that his fracture would get better soon. Unexpectedly…</p>
<p>She suddenly felt pain in her heart, liver, and lungs. This feeling of regret felt too uncomfortable. <em>If her vulnerary could relieve the poison…</em></p>
<p>“It’s a pity that there is only a little left. After two days, it will run out. Yaoyao, do you still have that medicine?” He asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll go back and have a look.” She looked down and squeezed her fist tightly. <em>No wonder he didn’t feel pain. It was her lingquan … did it relieve the toxicity?</em></p>
<p>He said, “I won’t have that medicine for the next two days. The wound would hurt very badly.”</p>
<p>She had seen his wound last night. The blood looked poisoned. The vulnerary with <em>lingquan</em> was not enough to cure his poison. It seemed that it only eased his pain for a few days. Thinking of this, she felt better. She looked at Lu Lingzhi’s handsome face and asked faintly, “Have you seen Ye Zhen?”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi suddenly looked up at her. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“You took me for her yesterday. Are you familiar… with Ye Zhen?” She tried to ask, but she never thought that he would still remember her.</p>
<p>“Not really.” He said faintly, “I have only seen her several times before.”</p>
<p>“I look like her, don’t I?” She asked, smiling. “Many people have said so, and some thought I was a ghost.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi frowned. “Yaoyao, you are you, not someone’s body double.”</p>
<p>“I know, I am curious about the late Wang Fei Ye.” Ye Zhen looked at him clearly and brightly. “Do you think I look good?”</p>
