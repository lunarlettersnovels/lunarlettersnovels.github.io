            <p><strong>Chapter 392 – Help Me Out (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Why would she help Lu Wushuang?</em> This woman was greedy and selfish, and pathologically envious. Furthermore, she was by nature evil. If she hadn’t wanted to see her slowly destroy herself, she would have dealt with her earlier on.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang saw that Ye Zhen wouldn’t agree to her request, and burst into anger, “Yaoyao, you and I are sisters. Would you not even help me with such a little thing?”</p>
<p>“I cannot help you,” Ye Zhen said coldly, “If you have nothing else, I will be leaving.”</p>
<p>“Stop there!” Lu Wushuang shouted. “If Eldest Brother hadn’t told me to go to you for help, I wouldn’t have even looked at you. Yaoyao, don’t forget. You still have a brother who will need to take part in the civil examination in a few days. If you won’t even help me, who will you expect to help your brother in the future?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen glared at Lu Wushuang with fury. “My brother is also your cousin!”</p>
<p>“But not my brother.” Lu Wushuang snorted coldly.</p>
<p>“If it weren’t for Eldest Brother, where would you be today? You best pray that your brother lives to a ripe age, and finds imperial favor for the rest of his life, so he can preserve you with his accomplishments forever.” Ye Zhen’s eyes were cold, her hatred towards Lu Shaunger at its height.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang laughed at her mockingly. “Then you can rest assured. Eldest Brother will definitely support me forever.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head and laughed coldly. “Don’t even think about having me apologize on your behalf. The most I’ll do is go with you to see Xu Xianfei.</p>
<p>She didn’t believe that Lu Wushuang wanted to sincerely apologize to Xu Huiru. This woman was definitely plotting something else. She wanted to have a look and see what she wanted to do next.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang hesitated, before shooting a look at her maid Qiu, and saying to Ye Zhen, “All right, go with me.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen immediately turned on her heels. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“We can’t go empty-handed. The emperor gifted me with some prized blood bird’s nest. Wasn’t Xu Xianfei feeling unwell? We can gift her this to help her recover.”</p>
<p>“Would Xu Xianfei be without such things?” Ye Zhen said with a frown.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang smiled and said, “It’s the heart that matters.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyebrows locked in a frown. She was still very suspicious of what Lu Wushuang was saying.</p>
<p>When they arrived at Xinghe Palace, Lu Wushuang ordered the maids to go in and state that they wished to see Xu Huiru. The maid looked at her, then at Ye Zhen, before lowering her head and entering the palace to report.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru had grown annoyed with Lu Wushuang from early on and was aware of the fact that her coming was no good thing. However, she had come forth with Lu Yaoyao this time, so it wouldn’t be right for her to refuse to see them.</p>
<p>“Let the Gui Fei and Her Highness the Princess enter,” Xu Huiru said, wanting to see what else Lu Wushuang had planned.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang slightly raised her chin, delicately and haughtily walking in. Seeing Xu Huiru, who was sitting on the heated bed casually dressed, she laughed. “I heard that you were unwell these past couple of days, and was extremely worried. So I came to see you.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru got up to bow, flatly looking at Lu Wushuang. “Gui Fei, you shouldn’t have.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took a good look at Xu Huiru and found that she was truly unwell. This was unusual. <em>If she was uncomfortable, why hadn’t she had her maids report to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard?</em></p>
<p>“We are all sisters, and I am ranked highest in the palace. It is customary that I pay attention to the state of your body. Yaoyao also brought some bird’s nests for me. This is quality blood bird’s nest, and very good for the body,” Lu Wushuang said with a smile, ordering her maid Qiu to give the bird’s nest to Xu Huiru.</p>
<p>Qian Lan stepped forth to accept the blood bird’s nest and placed it on the table.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru softly thanked her. “Thank you, Gui Fei.” She turned to look at Ye Zhen, a kind smile emerging on her face. “I heard that Her Highness is in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard right now. Is everything well?”</p>
<p>“It’s all right.” Ye Zhen nodded lightly, but she was infuriated internally.<em> How had the blood bird’s nest suddenly become her gift? What was Lu Wushuang playing at?</em></p>
<p>Lu Wushuang had successfully given the blood bird’s nest to Xu Huiru and was immediately happier. But turning to see that the decorations here at Xu Huiru’s place didn’t dim in the slightest compared to her Palace of Earthly Tranquility, she was infuriated again. She only concluded that the empress dowager and the emperor were biased, and had definitely gifted Xu Huiru with many precious things recently.</p>
<p>The more she looked, the angrier she was. She coldly snorted. “Seeing as Xu Xianfei does not feel well, I won’t disturb you any longer.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru didn’t want Lu Wushuang staying here as an annoyance any longer either, and rose to send her off, keeping Ye Zhen behind. “I am still feeling a little unwell, and want to implore you to make a diagnosis for me. Gui Fei, I will need to borrow the princess for a while.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang had never liked this cousin of hers because of her cold and aloof attitude. Seeing as Xu Huiru wanted to keep her behind, naturally, she wouldn’t say anything against it.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, then you stay with Xianfei a little longer.” Lu Wushuang coldly snorted, then left with her maids.</p>
