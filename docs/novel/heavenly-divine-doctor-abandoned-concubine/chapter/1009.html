            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 320 – Be Obedient, Don’t Agree (2)</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at Ye Zhen icily. “Do you really think that after becoming my imperial sister, I won’t dare do anything to you?”</p>
<p>Well, she really did think so, though she wouldn’t admit it. “You are the high and mighty emperor, I am as humble as an ant before you. How could I be fearless after becoming a princess?”</p>
<p>”I want you,” Mo Rongzhan said softly.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, I am already your imperial sister,” Ye Zhen said, her expression changing.</p>
<p>He smiled. “And what about it? Has the imperial edict been passed? If not, then it is only the words from the empress dowager’s mouth.”</p>
<p>She widened her eyes, “Your Imperial Majesty— ” <em>Could you not act so shameless！</em></p>
<p>Before she could say anything, he had already lowered his head and blocked her lips, his tongue moving to separate her teeth, domineeringly invading her mouth.</p>
<p>“No—” She struggled, wanting to push him away. But her meager strength was nothing against him.</p>
<p>He took a hold of her hand, leaned against her, and using his other hand untied the straps to her dress.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head fiercely. “Mo Rongzhan, stop! You can’t do this.”</p>
<p>“Then what do you want me to do?” He panted roughly. He was unable to accept the fact that she had become his imperial sister. <em>Was it that he would have to direct her wedding in the future as well?</em></p>
<p><em>Make him marry her to another man? Not unless he was dead!</em></p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, if you touch me today, I will kill myself here.” Ye Zhen closed her eyes, giving up her struggles.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan glared at her angrily, unable to believe what he heard as he asked, “You would rather die than to marry me?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Ye Zhen immediately answered.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao!” Mo Rongzhan was seething in fury.</p>
<p>How had he been bewitched by her? How was she so heartless? He had already indulged her so much, yet she was not moved in the slightest. What other woman would dare hit him? She had already hit him twice! He couldn’t bear to punish her, yet she still remained untouched.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gritted her teeth, closed her eyes, and refused to look at him.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan almost wanted to choke her right then and there, to save him the effort of not being able to let go. He slowly released her hand and stepped back. “I have never been unable to attain anything that I desire.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a thing!’ Ye Zhen shouted.</p>
<p>“That’s right, you’re not a thing. You are a woman that I desire.” Mo Rongzhan smiled lightly. “Even if you become a princess… what about it? Do you really think that I would care?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes widened. “You might not care, but the empress dowager will!”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan curved his lips in a shallow smile, his dark eyes reflecting her pale figure. “Yaoyao, you will understand in the future.”</p>
<p><em>Understand what?</em> Ye Zhen frowned and looked at him, wanting to wait for him to continue. But he didn’t say anything else and simply turned around.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pursed her lips tightly. If he wouldn’t say anything, naturally, she was unwilling to speak and ask him what he meant either.</p>
<p>“This is the place where I was almost in an accident,”  Mo Rongzhan suddenly said.</p>
<p><em>Why would he suddenly speak of this? </em>Ye Zhen frowned, puzzled. <em>This well was where she had once saved him. But what was there about it?</em></p>
<p>“The little girl that once saved was, like you, also named Yaoyao.” Mo Rongzhan’s voice was filled with a heavy disappointment. “I… was tricked by someone into thinking she was someone else.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned and asked, “You’re telling me this because I have the same name as her?”</p>
<p><em>He was making her a substitute for this girl?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at her flatly. He couldn’t deny that his initial interest in her had been because of her name. But later, unknowingly, whenever he now thought of Yaoyao, he could only see the image of her.</p>
<p>“I’ll send you up.” Mo Rongzhan calmed down. He had just almost “wanted her” (sexually). This was the place he first met little Yaoyao. He couldn’t make any unhappy memories here.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen immediately tidied her hair and clothes, taking a look at him before quickly lowering her head again.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan held her by the waist and sent her up. Before she could thank him, he had already strode out of the forest, leaving her with only a strong, straight back.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen silently looked for a while, before lowering to pick up the fallen fruits back into the basket.</p>
<p>As she had expected, he had found out that he had been tricked… <em>So this was why Lu Shuanger had lost his favor, right?</em></p>
<p><em>What if he knew that little Yaoyao was Ye Zhen? What then would he think?</em></p>
<p><em>He would probably regret everything…</em></p>
