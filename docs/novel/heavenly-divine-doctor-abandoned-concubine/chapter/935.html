            <p><strong>Chapter 394 – Take the Blame (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Misunderstanding?!” Ye Zhen indifferently asked, “Lu Wushuang must have thought that if the Lu Family were to choose, everyone would take her side instead of themselves.”</p>
<p>“Lingzhi, go to the palace.” Old Madam Lu said wearily, “Even if it’s not what Shuang’er said, where would Yaoyao get the blood bird’s nests if she hasn’t left the palace for a few days? To find out if those blood bird’s nest are Shuanger’s, the Imperial Household Department will take over this matter and it shall be found out.”</p>
<p>They had indeed pampered Lu Wushuang to the point that she did whatever she wanted in extremes regardless of the laws and morality. Not only did she conspire murder against a fellow concubine but also sought to cause trouble to her younger sister.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu felt exhausted physically and mentally and was extremely disappointed with Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was also in a complicated mood at this time. He knew very well that this matter had nothing to do with Yaoyao, but if Yaoyao was innocent, then Lu Wushuang would definitely not be innocent. Moreover, she had had a difficult time gaining favor as Gui Fei…</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you go to the palace together and explain clearly to the empress dowager and the emperor,” Pei Shi said, her heart was rubbing against fire. <em>What’s the matter with Lu Wushuang? Does she not know that accusing Yaoyao might cost her her life?</em></p>
<p><em>How hateful! They must think that the Third Household can easily be trampled upon, don’t they?</em></p>
<p>“Third Aunt, I’ll go to the palace. It’s already late, Yaoyao should stay at home.” Lu Lingzhi persuaded her.</p>
<p>“Since this matter has something to do with Yaoyao, it’s only natural that she explains it in person. She can’t be wrongly accused by others,” Lu Shiming said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at them gratefully. When such a thing happened, they were not thinking of keeping the honor of the gui fei but of proving her innocence. They would rather not be rich and prosperous than embrace wrongdoings. Who would not be moved by such care and sincerity?</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu said, “Let Yaoyao go with you.”</p>
<p>Even if the Lu Family wanted to protect Lu Wushuang, it was hopeless. There was no cure for her stupidity. This time, Yaoyao had to compromise to save Lu Wushuang. The next time, who knows the entire Lu Family would be buried with her. Although she was old, she knew who should be saved and who shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi looked at Ye Zhen but saw that the little girl’s eyes were cold and seemed to be hostile to him. He forced a smile, and said, “All right, come with me to the palace.”</p>
<p>They had just walked out from the upper hall when they saw Madam Lu, with disheveled hair, rushing towards them.</p>
<p>Seeing Liu Shi, Ye Zhen’s gaze turned colder and colder. She stood still and watched her frantically grasp Lu Lingzhi’s arms.</p>
<p>“Lingzhi, are you going into the palace to help Shuang’er? I’ve heard about it. I’ve heard about it all. Lu Yaoyao brought Shuang’er trouble. You have to do something for your sister!”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi pulled her hand away. “Mother, who did you listen to? When did Yaoyao hurt Shuang’er?”</p>
<p>“She did! Lingzhi, you must help Gui Fei. She’s your sister, after all!” she shrieked.</p>
<p>Listening to Liu Shi from inside the room, Pei Shi became angrier and angrier. She suddenly stood up and rushed to the outside. “Liu Shi, you have to speak with your conscience. Yaoyao has been in the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard for days; she and Xianfei Xu have no grievances. Why would she want to harm Xianfei? Clearly, your daughter wants Yaoyao to take the blame!”</p>
<p>“What’s the big deal if she wants her to take the blame? Shuang’er is Gui Fei. If she falls out of favor, will you have a good life? Isn’t your daughter a mere medical woman? What’s the value of her life?” cried Liu Shi.</p>
<p>Pei Shi was even angrier now. <em>How could there be such a shameless person?!</em> <em>It seems that other people’s daughters are not valuable, only her daughter’s life is! </em>“Although my daughter is not a gui fei, she is my life! You say she’s a mere medical woman, yet she’s still Princess Fu Rong. If you want her dead, it depends on whether Empress Dowager and His Imperial Majesty would allow it or not! ”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was flabbergasted. <em>Life? She thinks so highly of her non-biological daughter?!</em></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu slowly came near them and looked at Liu Shi coldly. “Liu Shi, according to your statement, should everyone in the family lose their lives?”</p>
<p>“Mother, are you going to be partial again? It’s clear that Lu Yaoyao has done something wrong….” Liu Shi rushed over and grabbed the matriarch’s hand.</p>
<p>When Madam Lu came over, she had already raised her hand and hit her hard. “Silence! Shuang’er has become lawless in her behavior because she has been so pampered by you!”</p>
<p>Liu Shi looked at the old madam in disbelief. “Does Mother also want to jump on the bandwagon with them? For the sake of a medical woman, would you rather watch Gui Fei fall out of favor?”</p>
