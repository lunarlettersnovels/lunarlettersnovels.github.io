            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 361 – Rewards (1)</strong></p>
<p>Back at the Palace of Heavenly Purity, Eunuch Fu was holding the soiled pants that Mo Rongzhan had just changed out of, and felt the wet crotch. He felt even more sympathetic towards the emperor.</p>
<p><em>What’s the point, can only see but not eat…</em></p>
<p>After a cold bath, Mo Rongzhan dressed in a casual robe and leaned against the plush chair. One didn’t know when Shen Yi had arrived, but he was now kneeling before him.</p>
<p>“This servant greets the emperor.” Shen Yi bowed his head and saluted.</p>
<p>“Rise.” Mo Rongzhan raised his hand. “What news did you bring?”</p>
<p>Shen Yi said in a low voice, “Your Imperial Majesty, I searched but … still can’t find it. I could only collect the names of the girls who appeared in the Baihua Garden that year. Please have a look.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan glanced at it and found no familiar name.</p>
<p>Shen Yi whispered, “Late Wang Fei also went there that year. The cloth … only the Ye Family possessed it before—”</p>
<p>“It can’t be Ye Zhen!” Mo Rongzhan denied coldly. He believed it was the Ye Family that ensnared him. So, how could Ye Zhen save him? <em>The cloth can’t be hers. What’s more, I’ve never heard of Ye Zhen having Yaoyao as a little name.</em></p>
<p>Since the emperor said no, it was definitely not.</p>
<p>“Check these people one by one, even at the ends of the earth, find the truth,” Mo Rongzhan said coldly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” Shen Yi could only accept his master’s order in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Also—” Mo Rongzhan’s eyebrows raised slightly. “The jade pendant Lu Wushuang possessed may not have been obtained by herself, someone should have given it to her. Check Lu Lingzhi, he may know where Yaoyao is.”</p>
<p><em>Lu Lingzhi?</em> Shen Yi was a little surprised. He looked up at the emperor and said, “Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>If Lu Lingzhi had helped Lu Wushuang behind his back, then this meant the latter had been successful in hiding her brother’s deeds over the years. However, in Mo Rongzhan’s heart, he didn’t want this to have anything to do with Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>Shen Yi was ordered to leave.</p>
<p>There were not hundreds or dozens of girls who had gone to the Baihua Garden. At that time, it was the students from the Academy for Women that had been visiting. It’s not easy to find out as some of them had already left the capital with their families.</p>
<p>As for Lu Lingzhi… Shen Yi thought this was more difficult. The assistant minister of war was not as gentle and harmless as he seemed. He had seen his ruthlessness and stratagem before the emperor ascended the throne.</p>
<p>If this matter with Lu Wushuang really had something to do with Lu Lingzhi, Shen Yi reckoned the girl named Yaoyao must no longer be in the world.</p>
<p>Someone like Lu Lingzhi would not leave any traces that might get him in trouble in the future.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Ye Zhen left the palace the next day. Although the empress dowager wanted her to stay for a few days, she had insisted on returning on the pretext of worrying about her family for she wanted to check Lu Lingzhi’s progress. In the end, the empress dowager let her leave but only after packing a pile of fish maw along.</p>
<p>The emperor also bestowed Lu Lingzhi a lot of rewards and made him a general. The Lu Family was in the limelight for a while.</p>
<p>This should have been a very happy turn of affairs. Had circumstances been normal, Old Madam Lu would have hosted a banquet to celebrate. However, the residual poison in Lu Lingzhi’s body had yet to be purged. For the Lu Family, it was like a huge stone weighing on their hearts. Thus, there was no such thing as holding a banquet to celebrate.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen first went to see Old Madam Lu and found that in only one day, the old madam looked haggard and tired. “Grandmother, are you all right? Did you not have a good rest yesterday?”</p>
<p>Wang Shi, who was accompanying Old Madam Lu, smiled and said, “Your Highness is back. We thought you were going to stay in the palace for several days. Don’t worry, Old Madam has us to take care of her at home. You have to coax the empress dowager, that is the most important thing for you to do.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen cast Wang Shi a cold look and ignored her innuendo.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu looked at Ye Zhen with a smile. “Isn’t Empress Dowager keeping you in the palace for a few days? Why are you back?”</p>
<p>“I was worried about my eldest brother and you, Grandmother, so I came back.” Seeing the old madam like this, Ye Zhen thought she would give her some water with <em>lingquan</em>.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, but I went to bed a little late last night, and I don’t have much spirit today,” Old Madam Lu said with a smile, “your elder brother is in better condition today. He just came to greet me.”</p>
<p>Now was not the time to think about the poisoning of Lu Lingzhi. Besides, she didn’t really care if he would be fine. Ye Zhen smiled and said, “That’s great. I’ll go and see him in a while.”</p>
<p>“Your elder brother is a general now. His Imperial Majesty has bestowed him gifts and herbs. Your mother and Imperial Physician Qi have been taking care of him since yesterday until now. After a while, you go and let them have a good rest,” Old Madam Lu said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “Yes, Grandmother.”</p>
<p>Wang Shi’s mouth twitched. She said, “We also want to take care of Lingzhi, but we are not doctors, and we might just cause trouble.”</p>
<p>“Second Aunt not causing trouble is already a help,” Ye Zhen said lightly.</p>
<p>Wang Shi choked, revealing a defiant look.</p>
