            <p><strong>Chapter 463 – Drunk and Wailing (2)</strong></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi had been to see Master Xu today. On his way back to the Lu Mansion, he spotted Tang Zhen’s carriage outside the tavern. He told the servant to stop and went in to look for the marquis.</p>
<p>Inside a room,  sat a Tang Zhen, face crimson and eyes blurry. He looked sloshed.</p>
<p>“Ah Zhen, what are you doing?” Lu Lingzhi frowned at the sight of his good friend. He had known Tang Zhen for many years now and this was the first time seeing him this drunk.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen opened his eyes and saw the other. “Ah, it’s you. Come and drink with me.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi took the flagon from his hand. “Did something happen to you?”</p>
<p>“I just want to drink.” Tang Zhen chuckled and finished the remaining wine in one gulp.</p>
<p>“Even in your younger days you never drank to get drunk. How much did you drink?” The more Lu Lingzhi thought about it, the more confused he became. <em>Tang Zhen looks very distressed. Did something really happen?</em></p>
<p>Tang Zhen chuckled. “Stop talking nonsense and drink with me!”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi quickly thought of something about what could’ve upset this guy. Tang Zhen had always been optimistic and would never drink to this degree. <em>It’s definitely not a small matter. What has happened recently?</em></p>
<p>“Ah Zhen, is it…It’s related to Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>The word “Yaoyao” was like a sharp arrow, instantly causing Tang Zhen’s already numb heart to ache again. He slumped on the table, not raising his head for a long time.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Lu Lingzhi knew that he had guessed correctly. It was indeed related to Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager is not willing to grant the marriage?”</p>
<p><em>Today, he must have heard what Grandmother intends. The empress dowager had summoned Tang Zhen today. Could it be that she(ED) had said something?</em></p>
<p>After a long time, Tang Zhen raised his head again. Eyes red, he said in a hoarse voice, “Yaoyao and I have no destiny.”</p>
<p>“Empress Dowager might not be willing to marry Yaoyao off as soon as possible, perhaps she can wait a few more days.” <em>There’s no more suitable candidate in the capital than Tang Zhen. </em>Lu Lingzhi reckoned that the empress dowager would not object.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen laughed, his smile bitter and helpless. “It has nothing to do with the empress dowager.”</p>
<p>Lu Ling looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p>“It has nothing to do with Empress Dowager…,” Tang Zhen murmured softly. He took the flagon and poured a large cup of wine. The alcohol gushed out as did his tears. “Your Majesty… It’s the emperor!”</p>
<p>“What happened to the emperor?” Lu Lingzhi’s expression darkened. He had to be more careful when it came to Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen cried like a child. ”Yaoyao can only be Empress, not Marquis’s wife.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi fiercely stood up and looked at Tang Zhen with uncertainty.</p>
<p><em>Only Empress? What these words mean.</em>..</p>
<p>“Ah Zhen, the emperor said it himself?”</p>
<p>But the man who had cried his heart out, suddenly dropped to the ground fast asleep. He did not answer his friend.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi couldn’t calm down anymore. <em>When did the emperor start… feeling this way about Yaoyao? Does he know that Yaoyao looks like Ye Zhen? Why would he want Yaoyao to be Empress?</em></p>
<p><em>Is this why when Shuang’er framed Yaoyao, the emperor did not even interrogate, and directly banished her? Because in his heart, Yaoyao is already more important than Shuang’er, more important than his former lifesaver?</em></p>
<p><em>I should go to see Shuang’er, perhaps she would know more about the Emperor and Yaoyao.</em></p>
<p>If the emperor really wanted to marry Yaoyao as the empress, then their Lu family would have an additional empress. His heart was a bit stuffy, he didn’t dare to think about Yaoyao’s beautiful and stunning face, every time he thought of her, an inexplicable pain would tug at his heart.</p>
<p>“Someone come.” Lu Lingzhi called out to the boy outside. “Send the Marquis of Jingning back now.”</p>
<p>He should think of a way to see Shuang’er and talk about Yaoyao’s marriage.</p>
<p>Looking down at slumbering Tang Zhen, he sighed lightly. Love was quite hurtful as is, but who could compete with the emperor for women!</p>
<p><em>Fortunately, the woman he likes ……</em></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s eyes darkened, <em>the woman he likes will never appear again.</em></p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Ye Zhen  didn’t explicitly tell Old Madam Lu about her trip to Huaijiang, she only said that she was going out with her master to practice medicine. The matriarch didn’t object, and naturally Lu Shiming didn’t say anything either. With that, she happily packed her things and brought all the pills and ointments with <em>lingquan</em>.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, there seemed to be more <em>lingquans</em> on her palm recently than before. Moreover, the effect of using them in medicine was even more useful. At first, it was only a drop, but now, every time she thought about it, at least five drops would come out. She had even set aside two small bottles of them in case of emergencies as it was inconvenient to let anyone see her using it.</p>
<p>“Miss, this servant will go with you,” Dai Mei said worriedly as she helped her mistress tidy up her clothes.</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I’m going to practice medicine and shouldn’t be bringing along a maid with me,” Ye Zhen smiled and said. Today, Master had even taught her how to disguise herself. Tomorrow, she would disguise herself as a man and follow him to Huaijiang. As a result, no one would be able to recognize her.</p>
<p>However, Dai Mei did not feel at ease.” Young Miss, as you practice medicine there must be a maidservant by your side.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen considered it carefully. It seemed like it was quite convenient for someone to be by her side. At the very least, she had some personal matters that she could let the maid handle. “Then come with me. However, you go prepare a set of clothes for a pageboy. When we go out, we will be better dressed as men.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss.” She smiled and agreed.</p>
<p>“It’s getting late. Have the little maid to fetch water.” After tidying up, a layer of sweat covered her body. The moon was already up in the middle of the sky, and the entire Lu Mansion was silent. They must all be asleep.</p>
<p>Soon, Mei Lanfang brought the water in, filled the tub with water, and prepared the clothes for changing. Then she left.</p>
