            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 144 – Entering The Palace (3)</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen heard Old Madam Lu’s scream and touched her face instinctively.</p>
<p>Her eyes were red as she spoke morosely. “Grandmother, I only found these when I woke up. What should I do? I can’t hide it with rouge as it looks even uglier.”</p>
<p>With her mouth still agape, Old Madam Lu’s face reflected utmost dread and frustration. Her eyes ogled the red dots marring her granddaughter’s beautiful face.</p>
<p>She originally wanted to parade Lu Yaoyao’s beauty to the palace so that she could have a good marriage in the future.</p>
<p>Now, looking at Lu Yaoyao and thought that there was no way those dots wouldn’t be noticed. Several were in the middle of her forehead, which was an eyesore.</p>
<p>Lu Fang covered her mouth and laughed. “Grandmother, I had the same red spots too. Yaoyao said it is nothing to be worried about as it will disappear in two days.”</p>
<p>“But why did it appear now of all time? Now that our Yaoyao will be visiting the palace!”</p>
<p>Old Madam. Lu was almost out of control. At this time, there was no way she could turn down Lu Wushuang’s invite.</p>
<p>When all hopes seemed gone, Pei Shi suddenly said, “The dots on her cheeks are not obvious, but the ones on her forehead have grown in clusters. I do have a way to cover those.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her with a jerk and a slight twitch of her mouth.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu asked hastily, “What can you do?”</p>
<p>“Mother, please wait a moment,” Pei Shi said with a smile and took Ye Zhen’s hand, leading her out of the room.</p>
<p>After about a quarter of an hour, Pei Shi reappeared with Ye Zhen. Old Madam Lu’s worried face was replaced by joy instantly. “Now she looks more charming than usual!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s forehead was delicately painted with petals, and her cheeks were expertly covered with rouge. If one didn’t look carefully, the red spots on her face would not be noticed at all. Her skin looked as soft as tofu. If anything else, she looked more attractive and gorgeous.</p>
<p>“Women in border towns paint petals on the crease of their foreheads which this daughter-in-law remembered. As you can see, it enhances a woman’s beauty.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu nodded with satisfaction. “Yes, you can teach the girls in the family how to make those.” What she liked the most was to dress her granddaughters up like a fairy.</p>
<p>If this was a normal occasion, Ye Zhen would have pestered Pei Shi to teach her how to paint the petals, but today she didn’t like it at all. She purposely allowed the red spots on her face in a self-destructive way. Now that she thought about it, it had all been for naught.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu happily led a depressed Ye Zhen out of the house. Seeing her silent and looking miserable, she thought she was just nervous so she took her hand.</p>
<p>“The wang fei is your cousin. Although you don’t live together, you two are sisters! You must not feel nervous.”</p>
<p>In response, Ye Zhen gave a nervous laugh. “Yes, Grandmother.”</p>
<p>In fact, she was not nervous at all. Her soul has been trapped in the palace for two years. She was no stranger to that place. She just didn’t want to see Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p>However, no matter how Ye Zhen refused, the carriage stopped outside the imperial palace gate.</p>
<p>Some imperial officials came to meet Old Madam Lu. Ye Zhen walked behind her with her head bowed low. But even so, she didn’t need to look around her as she knew every nook and crook of this place.</p>
<p>During the two years she was trapped here as a spirit, she was around Mo Rongzhan during the day and could only stay away from him at night. For some reason, she felt burning pain all over her body whenever she kept her distance from him except when during night</p>
<p>During those two years, her heart was full of hatred, and now she had entered the palace again. Her mood was calm and all hatred well restrained.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, they had already arrived at the Palace of Earthly Tranquility.</p>
<p>The imperial secretary, who was leading the way for Old Madam Lu looked back and saw Ye Zhen raise her head. She was so shocked that she halted in her steps.</p>
<p>Unaware of this, Ye Zhen followed Old Madam Lu into the hall of the Palace of Earthly Tranquility. Lu Wushuang could be seen sitting at the top of the table, dressed in a brocade robe with a silver-purple phoenix tail pattern, looking bright, elegant, and charming.</p>
<p>She had a gentle smile on her face as her eyes skipped over her grandmother and fell on the person behind, her third sister Lu Yaoyao.</p>
