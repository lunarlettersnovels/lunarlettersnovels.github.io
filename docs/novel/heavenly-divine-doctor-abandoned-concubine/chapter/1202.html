<p>Lu Lingzhi accompanied Mo Rongzhan back to the hunting ground, the emperor’s mind was still filled with Ye Zhen’s amazing dance. Though Lu Lingzhi had heard Tang Zhen say that Lu Yaoyao’s dancing was excellent before, he had not expected it to be so magnificent.</p>
<p>He played his cards poorly, and now, Lu Yaoyao had finally caught the emperor’s eye.</p>
<p>If he knew that she would be as dazzling as spring, Lu Lingzhi would definitely keep Mo Rongzhan from seeing her!</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the little prince is still at the academy.” Lu Lingzhi could not help but speak in a low voice when he saw Mo Rongzhan keeping silent.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s indifferent voice soon came. “Let’s leave him be. With Tang Zhen by his side, nothing bad will happen to him.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Your Majesty.” Lu Lingzhi agreed, but in his heart, he wondered why the little prince was so concerned about Lu Yaoyao that it surely had become a convenience to Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>“Lingzhi, why did your sister decide to enter the School of Medicine?” Mo Rongzhan walked at a leisurely pace and asked casually.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi followed him slowly. He did not dare to walk too fast because his foot was yet to entirely recover. “Your Majesty, my third aunt, and uncle are proficient in medicine, and my sister was greatly influenced by them. She also has the talent, so she thought of taking the examination.”</p>
<p>“Is it because of her medicine that your injured foot is healing fast?” Mo Rongzhan raised his eyebrows inquisitively and asked, looking down at Lu Lingzhi’s foot.</p>
<p>In just a few days, Mo Rongzhan was surprised to see him walk, albeit a tad unstable. Generally speaking, a fractured bone would take at least a month to recuperate.</p>
<p>“Strange to say, the first time I took the medicine, I felt it was really miraculous, but later, its effects somewhat subsided.” Lu Lingzhi laughed, not knowing how Ye Zhen’s medicine didn’t work as well as the one she gave Lu Xiangzhi.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan only nodded slightly, and the topic did not continue its course. This certainly favored Lu Lingzhi—he did not want him to pay too much attention to Lu Yaoyao. Therefore, now that the emperor no longer talked about her, Lu Lingzhi naturally followed suit.</p>
<p>Finally, he was able to breathe with ease—but this was only for a while, for the emperor’s next words shook him once more.</p>
<p>“The first time I met Shuang’er, she said she had a childhood nickname.” Mo Rongzhan suddenly mentioned Lu Wushuang.</p>
<p><i>Nickname? What nickname is the emperor talking about?</i></p>
<p>He had never heard the late Wang Fei Ye Zhen mention a nickname of hers before. <i>Was there something he didn’t know? </i></p>
<p>“I have been away from the capital since I was a child. I always followed my father everywhere, so I don’t know how my grandmother called Wang Fei.”</p>
<p>Instantly, Mo Rongzhan’s lips thinned in a grimace. Lu Wushuang said that she had no nickname, but even if she had one, it could not possibly be the same as her cousin’s which was Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“You once said that Shuang’er was ill when she was still a child. Is that the reason why she forgot many things?” Mo Rongzhan asked in a direct tone.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s heart was already ringing furiously with alarm bells.<i> Why does the emperor always ask about the past these days? Does he already suspect that Lu Wushuang is not his rescuer?</i></p>
<p>Before he had handed the jade pendant over to Lu Wushuang, the emperor had completely believed that she was the savior he met during his childhood. <i>How could he doubt it now?</i></p>
<p>“Yes, when my sister, the wang fei, was ten years old, her whole body suddenly became feverish and she only got better after burning for two days. But when she woke up, she forgot a lot about the past so we called for a physician who then said that it would be good to not force her to remember her forgotten memories.” Lu Lingzhi clearly spoke, saying that this was the truth, just to explain why his sister had forgotten the little girl’s code.</p>
<p>If Mo Rongzhan had not found the torn purse in the woods and remembered that the little girl said her name was Yaoyao, he would not have doubted Lu Wushuang and would have even doted on her until this very time.</p>
<p>But once doubts arise in the heart and mind, more will follow.</p>
