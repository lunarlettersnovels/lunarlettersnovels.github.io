            <p><strong>Chapter 490 – Clearing Up the Misunderstanding</strong></p>
<p>Zhao Tianji, having deliberated for a long time in his room, felt that he should talk it out with Huangfu Chen. If what happened back then was a misunderstanding, then who had attacked Zhao Island? As the Island Lord, even if he hadn’t returned for many years, he couldn’t ignore this matter. Therefore, he came to look for Huangfu Chen and heard his heartless words outside the door.</p>
<p>Before Huangfu Chen could say anything, he saw Zhao Tianji push the door and enter. He was sitting in the wheelchair and glaring at him angrily.</p>
<p>After spending half a month with Zhao Tianji, Ye Zhen roughly knew the true character of this seemingly cruel and heartless man. At first, she thought he was a feminine and terrifying person, but later on, she found out that although he had a bad temper and a malicious mouth, it wasn’t hard to get along with him. It was just that his way of doing things was a little brutal.</p>
<p>“Master, I’ll go back now. I have to change the prescription for Island Lord Zhao tomorrow.” Ye Zhen smiled at Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>“Yeah, don’t tire yourself out.” Huangfu Chen nodded lightly.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji pushed the wheelchair to Huangfu Chen. “She can’t be tired, so you mean I can continue to sit in the wheelchair?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at him helplessly. “What are you trying to say?”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you leave Zhao Island with Mu Qing?” Zhao Tianji demanded coldly.</p>
<p>“Mu Fei said that she went to Spirit Snake Island,” Huangfu Chen said indifferently, “I went to find her.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji pursed his lips. He didn’t expect his brother to let Mu Fei do such a thing. “What about the letter?”</p>
<p>“Mu Qing had already married me before she returned to the island. How could I not marry her because of some kind of legacy? Besides, my grandmother has never had such a legacy. Why would she care about a small island?” Huangfu Chen said.</p>
<p>“Then why didn’t you come back to find her?” Zhao Tianji asked again.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen said in a low voice, “Looked… but couldn’t find it. Then… I went to recuperate.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji frowned at him. “How did you get hurt? Who could’ve hurt you?”</p>
<p>“Injured on Spirit Snake Island….” Huangfu Chen looked at him indifferently. “Is there an end to this? You were the one who made a fool of yourself by misunderstanding me, yet you blame it on me now?”</p>
<p>“If you weren’t stupid, how would you’ve believed Mu Fei’s words?” Zhao Tianji glared at him and retorted. “Why would anyone sneak attack our Zhao Island after you left? My brother almost died to save Mu Qing….”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen clenched his fists and said coldly, “How would I know? Do you think I could have sent people to attack your island? If I had such leisure, why didn’t I restore the country to the Huangfu family? What’s the point in bothering with your island?”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji rubbed his nose. “Then who could it be?”</p>
<p>“Ah Ji, did your brother make you come here to watch the iron mine?” Huangfu Chen asked indifferently.</p>
<p>“So what?” Zhao Tianji snorted.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen looked at him gently. “If you didn’t suspect your big brother about what happened back then, why didn’t you return to Zhao Island for so many years? Do you want people to work at your private mine just to do business? Is it you who has ambitions, or is it your brother?”</p>
<p>“What do you want to say?” Zhao Tianji asked impatiently. He hated Huangfu Chen the most. He could see through everything clearly and it was impossible for people to have even a little secret.</p>
<p>“I should be asking you, Ah Ji, what do you guys want to do? If I’m not wrong, this is definitely not the only private mine you own. Why do you need so much iron?” Huangfu Chen looked at him and asked in a low voice, “Do you want to forge weapons?”</p>
<p>If Zhao Tianji could stand up on his own, he would have already slapped the table. “Huangfu Chen, did you divinate this?”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen sighed. “I know what kind of personality you have. Earlier, I was only suspicious. But when I heard what happened back then, I became certain.”</p>
<p>“My eldest brother… I also hope that the islanders won’t get hurt again,” Zhao Tianji whispered.</p>
<p>“You sound guilty.” Huangfu Chen smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji glared at him and said, “Anyway, the matter of the iron mine has nothing to do with you. You better not meddle in other people’s business.”</p>
<p>“I do mind my own business,” Huangfu Chen said indifferently, “However, if Zhao Mingxiao does any harm to the country, I will not let him off.”</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji glanced at him. “Then you and Mu Qing…”</p>
<p>“I’ll find her in the future and explain it to her. If she wants to go with me, I’ll bring her. If not, I won’t force her,” he said.</p>
<p>“Why do you have an apprentice like Lu Yaoyao?” Zhao Tianji asked.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen smiled. “What about her? What’s wrong with me taking her as my apprentice?”</p>
<p>Island Lord snorted coldly. “She has a sharp tongue. She’s not gentle at all.”</p>
<p>“She’s not your mother. What’s the point in being gentle with you?” Huangfu Chen rebutted indifferently. “Don’t forget, we were captured by your people.”</p>
<p>“It’s time for me to take the medicine. I’m leaving. You… Keep drinking tea.” Zhao Tianji coughed lightly and pushed the wheelchair out.</p>
<p>With Zhao Tianji’s departure, the guards who had been stationed at the door also followed. There was no need for Huangfu Chen to be put under house arrest inside this courtyard. Except that he couldn’t leave the villa, he was no longer restricted from moving around.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew this and also that their misunderstanding had been resolved, however, she was now the most worried for Mo Rongzhan in the iron mine.</p>
<p><em>I wonder… How he is now.</em></p>
<p>Two days had passed, but there was still no news from the iron mine. She thought he would come looking for her, but he hadn’t.</p>
<p>“Why are you lost?” Zhao Tianji frowned as he looked at the little girl sitting in front of him. She was in a daze even while playing chess. It showed how much she didn’t want to play chess with him.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen returned to her senses and looked at him indifferently. “I’m thinking about something.”</p>
<p>“Thinking about how to leave this place?” he raised his eyebrows and asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’ll be leaving for Huaijiang in ten days at most.” She said seriously, “You can stand up by yourself now. If you practice for a few more days, you’ll be able to walk.”</p>
<p>He snorted. “What if I don’t let you go?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s pink lips curled into a sweet smile. “Do you believe that I can make you incapable of walking for the rest of your life?”</p>
<p>“Why did Huangfu Chen take in such a vicious apprentice like you?” Zhao Tianji frowned and glared at her. “You’re a princess, why do you want to learn medicine?”</p>
<p>“I like it.” she replied. “You’re a lord of an island. Why did you open a private mine in the central plains? Are you that short of silver?”</p>
<p>“——” He took a few moments before saying, “I like it.”</p>
<p>She placed the chess pieces in her hands on the chessboard. “I’m going to the mountain tomorrow morning. I’m still lacking a few herbs. There aren’t any in the villa. There should be some on the mountain.”</p>
<p>“Draw out the shape of the herbs and have others pick them,” he said.</p>
<p>“I did draw, none of the herbs they picked were right,” Ye Zhen said unhappily.</p>
