            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 267 – Enraged (1)</strong></p>
<p>The chilly wind danced on the surface of the lake, forming endless ripples. A serene air shrouded this otherwise quiet waterside pavilion.  None could tell there was a battle in play right in the middle of it all.</p>
<p>With a sigh, Ye Zhen dropped the white <em>Go</em> piece and held her palms together in surrender. “Mister Chen, I lost.”</p>
<p>Observing the game they had, Huangfu Chen was amazed at this young miss’s skills in playing the board game. Her <em>Go skills</em> were even better than what Xu Lao had described. He reckoned she must have concealed her true extent when she had last played with him.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu is excellent at <em>Go</em>. This humble one is all admiration,” Huangfu Chen said with a smile. <em>A child who grew up in a border town without the guidance of a teacher but has such skills, indeed one is remarkable.</em></p>
<p>He seemed to have underestimated this young miss. The image he had formed of her based on an enchanted Xu Lao’s description, that he had deliberately underplayed by a few notches, he now realized was a far cry from the reality before him. This girl was in every way capable and exceptional.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled bashfully. “I just cannot show off my incompetence in the presence of an expert like yourself.” She was not trying to flatter him, she genuinely felt that the man before her was a talent extraordinaire.</p>
<p>“I heard that Miss Lu would rather study medicine than take Xu Lao as her teacher?” As he gathered the <em>Go</em> pieces, Huangfu Chen casually mentioned.</p>
<p>“I have liked studying medicine since I was a child. It has been my dream to go to the School of Medicine.” Ye Zhen stated in a low voice, lacking in confidence as she spoke because Lu Yaoyao did not like medicine at all. She just liked to play around all day.  She felt like she was living her dream, rather imposing it, on and through her sister’s body. Somewhere she was guilt-stricken, but could anyone fault her?</p>
<p>“I see.” Huangfu Chen smiled faintly, those narrow and profound eyes seemed to be able to see through people.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen felt more and more embarrassed that she had to say these things when she only started to study medicine not because she liked it, but because she chose it as a path to achieve her goal.</p>
<p>“It is said that Mister Chen is a divine doctor-” Ye Zhen’s voice trailed as she thought back to the Qi Medical Classics still in her hands. As a matter of fact, Huangfu Chen should be the one to possess it, being the rightful heir.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen chuckled. “Possessing a little knowledge about the art of healing does not make one a divine doctor.”  It wasn’t sure if he was understating his acumen or diverting attention from the topic, whatever it was, he was clearly in no mood to acknowledge anything.</p>
<p>Seeing how things stood, she decided to come clean. “Mister Chen, the Qi Medical Classics is in my possession. If I see you again next time, I should return the book to its rightful owner.”</p>
<p>“So, you have the book.” He shook his head and smiled. “That book was left behind by my ancestors to be imparted to future generations. It does not matter who takes possession of the book, but there are five books in this set, and the other four are still here. If Miss Lu likes it, she can take them all.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say you are willing to lend them to me?” Ye Zhen was pleasantly surprised at his generosity.</p>
<p>“The book was meant to be passed on, why can’t I let you read them?” he asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was deeply moved knowing that the Qi Medical Classics was a precious book handed down by his ancestors. Many senior physicians were even reluctant to let others know about a prescription, let alone lend such precious books to others. Here was the true epitome of magnanimity.</p>
<p>It turned out her ears had not been mistaken. Huangfu Chen was indeed as she had heard and expected. He was certainly not an ordinary man.</p>
<p>“Then I will thank Mister Chen in advance,” Ye Zhen gratefully said, albeit a little puzzled.</p>
<p><em>Last time, when Imperial Physician Qi knew that I have the medical classics, she seemed very excited. Did she not know that the other four books were in her nephew’s possession?</em></p>
<p>“Another game?” Huangfu Chen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s countenance was girdled with a smile, her eyes shining bright. She reckoned the man held a perpetual smile, that was contagious. No matter how catastrophic the things got, that curve on his lips would never abate. “Mister Chen, as you please.”</p>
<p>As the sun descended, Ye Zhen and Lu Xiangzhi left the Xu Mansion. She had gained a lot today. It was an honor and rare opportunity to know Huangfu Chen, not to mention that he had promised her he would lend her his collection of books.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, what did you and Mister Chen talk about that you are in such a good mood?” Lu Xiangzhi turned to look at his sister. He had not seen such a radiant smile on his sister’s face in a long time.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen placed both of her hands on her cheeks and blinked. “Is it so obvious?”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi smiled. “Your eyes say it all.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad that Mister Chen offered to let me borrow and read his collection of books.” Ye Zhen said, “Eldest Brother, have you met him before?”</p>
<p>“No, I only met him when I came to see Master Xu two days ago. Today is the second time seeing each other,” Lu Xiangzhi said.</p>
<p>If this was the case, Huangfu Chen must have been away from the capital. Perhaps he only returned two days ago. No matter where he went, people would surely notice him. And since there had been no news wafting around, it served as proof he was out of town.</p>
