            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 148 – The Chants Of The Dowager (1)</strong></p>
<p>Her heartbeat quickening, Lu Wushuang’s smile froze upon hearing this. “Does Her Highness want to see Lu Yaoyao?” Her face was full of disbelief.</p>
<p>“Yes, Wang Fei.” Aunt Cheng smiled and nodded. “Not long ago, the little prince went to Chengde Mountain Villa without permission and fell into a trap. It was Third Miss Lu who saved him. Since then, Her Highness has been wishing to meet her.”</p>
<p><i>I really shouldn’t have let Grandmother bring Lu Yaoyao to the palace today! </i>Lu Wushuang exclaimed regretfully in her heart.</p>
<p>“Aunt Cheng, please tell Her Highness that we’ll be there shortly,” she said with a forced smile.</p>
<p>“Then this handmaiden will go back to first.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu watched Aunt Cheng leave and then turned to Lu Wushuang with sheer satisfaction. “Wang Fei, Empress Dowager still cherishes you so much. What are you so worried about?”</p>
<p>“Why did Grandmother say that?” Lu Wushuang asked sullenly.</p>
<p>“If Empress Dowager doesn’t value you, why would she want to see me? She gives you honor!”</p>
<p>Despite Old Madam Lu’s effort to brighten her mood, Lu Wushuang remained sulking. After throwing a bitter smile at Old Madam, she asked the maids outside to fetch Ye Zhen from the side halls.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was currently going over the contents of the medical books she read last night in her mind while she leisurely roamed the halls of one of the palace’s temples.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, she was called back. <i>Are we now going home?</i></p>
<p>To her surprise, she was told that the empress dowager wanted to see her. <i>Oh heavens! She didn’t know what to make of this news!</i></p>
<p>“Empress Dowager is a kind person, so you don’t need to be afraid. Just answer whatever question she asks of you.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang took a look at Ye Zhen and felt bothered that her third younger sister’s looks were too remarkable and would leave an imprint on the empress dowager’s mind whose favor she was currying for a long time now.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was a little anxious, not because she was afraid of the empress dowager, but she was utterly unprepared to meet her so soon.</p>
<p>Not to mention, she was also uncertain of whether the empress dowager still remembered her appearance. <i>If she noticed that she looks similar to the late wang fei, would she suspect her identity?</i></p>
<p>Old Madam Lu noticed Ye Zhen’s pale face, so she took her by the hand and whispered. “Empress Dowager is also a human being and will not eat you.”</p>
<p>For this, Ye Zhen gave a wry smile. “Grandmother, I know, but I just can’t help it.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go. We must not keep Empress Dowager waiting.” Lu Wushuang smiled faintly, secretly hoping that Lu Yaoyao would be disrespectful in front of the empress dowager.</p>
<p>Without delay, the three proceeded in their short walk towards the Cining Palace, the very place where the empress dowager resided.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lowered her head to cover up the expression displayed on her face.</p>
<p>In the eyes of others, she was just extremely nervous but in fact, although she felt a little uneasy she did not feel as what everyone thought.</p>
<p>But instead, she felt a faint excitement at visiting the Cining palace.</p>
<p>When she was trapped here, her favorite thing to do was to stay at Cining Palace at night, because it was when the empress dowager would chant mantras<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1">[mfn]Death mantras are chanted to help souls escape the electromagnetic field of the earth and attain ultimate peace.[/mfn]</sup> for her, feeling sorry for her tragic death and wishing for her soul to have its deserved peace…</p>
<p>At that time, whenever she listened to empress dowager’s chants, she felt her soul in serene comfort, as if wandering in a warm ocean.</p>
<p>For others, many things had yet to happen and only Ye Zhen knew that Empress Dowager had silently recited the death mantra dedicated to her for two years.</p>
<p>They soon arrived at the Cining palace and Ye Zhen went in with bated breath.</p>
