            <p><strong>Chapter 418 – She Belonged to the Crown Prince</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him in a daze.</p>
<p><em>Had she gotten something wrong?</em></p>
<p>She had always thought that he had been the one to give her the poisoned wine… She tried to recollect what had happened then. When her soul had grievously floated into the palace, she had just happened to see Lu Lingzhi talking with him.</p>
<p>At that time, she hadn’t heard anything, just the words “nothing important”…</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I would never have allowed Ye Zhen into my harem. She isn’t like you. I cannot allow someone that might betray me to appear in my harem.” Mo Rongzhan led her to sit by his side, lowering his eyes to see her dazed face.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen raised her head. <em>If he had never wanted to kill her, then the person who had…would be Lu Lingzhi? </em>Lu Lingzhi hadn’t only schemed her of her trust and making her reveal to him everything about herself and Mo Rongzhan back then. In the end, in fear that Mo Rongzhan might discover the truth, had directly gotten rid of her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen found that she had underestimated his sinister nature. She had always seen him as a gentle and generous older brother. She had almost been tricked. Cruel and ruthless, were words that best described Marquis Anyang’s nature. It was impossible for him to be as kind as he appeared to be.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao?” Seeing that she was silent, he gently pinched her face.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned to look at him, the past and the present filling her mind. Mo Rongzhan’s words just then had left her even more confused. “How could you think that Ye Zhen would betray you? If she wanted to betray you, why would she marry you? Is it that married couples do not share the same heart?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at the little girl deeply, before quietly saying, “She belonged to the deposed emperor. I saw her seek him at the Crown Prince Residence with my own eyes. She was involved with the crown prince. How could she treat me wholeheartedly?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen suddenly wanted to smash that bowl of meat congee on his head. <em>She belonged to the Crown Prince? He dared to say that she…</em> “Mo Rongzhan, maybe it’s better that Ye Zhen is dead. She doesn’t need to be humiliated by you like this.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao?” Mo Rongzhan was taken aback. He couldn’t understand why this little girl would care so much about the matters with Ye Zhen. Even if they were sisters, since she was young, she had lived in the Lu Family and had never ever seen anyone from the Ye Family. How could she care so much about Ye Zhen?</p>
<p>So much so that she (LYY) would defend her (YZ) against injustice in every matter!</p>
<p>At this time, Ye Zhen was so angry that she felt her heart was trembling. She didn’t want to speak, in fear that she would say something she might regret later.</p>
<p>She had never known that… Mo Rongzhan had thought about her like this…</p>
<p><em>Involved with the crown prince?</em> She didn’t know what to say. Yes, she had gone to the Crown Prince Residence before. At that time, she had insisted on marrying Mo Rongzhan, and the crown prince had been infuriated, saying that he wanted her hand as the consort of the crown prince.</p>
<p>She had always viewed the crown prince as an older brother. She had gone to the Crown Prince Residence to find the Crown Prince herself to set matters straight. <em>Just this once, and Mo Rongzhan would think she belonged to the crown prince?</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, drink the congee first.” Ye Zhen suppressed all of her anger, her tone indescribably cold.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had been closely watching her, his brow knotted tighter. He felt that he had pushed her further away.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, I am unable to clearly explain everything between myself and Ye Zhen. She is already dead. Everything has passed. Can you not harbor anything against me because of her?” Mo Rongzhan asked quietly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lowered her gaze to flatly glance at him. “I have nothing against you.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao!” Mo Rongzhan heard the distance in her voice and uncontrollably harshened his tone.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, eat something first,” Ye Zhen said flatly. There were some things that couldn’t be clearly said now. She didn’t want to speak anymore. Seeing as he had already made up his mind that Ye Zhen wasn’t someone worthy of trust, then she would let it be.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s dark and serene eyes were as inky as the night and ignited fear in whoever meet them. Ye Zhen lowered her head away from him, picking up the bowl of meat congee, “Please take it.”</p>
<p>At this time, no matter what he said, she would be unable to listen. As long as it had to do with Ye Zhen or the Ye Family, she would be stubborn, and unwilling to hear him explain. She wasn’t willing to believe what he said.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was infuriated as well. He had already stepped back so obviously for her. <em>Why does she always ignore it? Is it that he had to always abide by her will, that she would unbridled move onward, and think that it was alright to casually trample over his feelings?</em></p>
<p>“Put down the congee. You can leave!” He coldly stated, not taking another look at her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen put down the congee, bowed, and turned to leave without a second glance.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan felt a wave of anger in his heart, he wanted to pull her back and ask what she really wanted. But his pride didn’t allow him to do that.</p>
<p>He had already given Lu Yaoyao the greatest patience a monarch could give. In fact, she could do anything, but he didn’t want to continue without reciprocation. He wanted her heart. If she was unwilling to give it, then he wouldn’t continue asking.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty—” Eunuch Fu came inside and seeing Mo Rongzhan with a cold expression, he felt a shiver in his heart.</p>
<p>“Give me the congee,” Mo Rongzhan said coldly.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu complained silently. <em>Hadn’t he been fine with the princess? How long has he been up for, and they are arguing already? Seeing Her Highness’s expression, things seem pretty nasty.</em></p>
