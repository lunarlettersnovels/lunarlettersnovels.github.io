<p>Ye Zhen stood unperturbed in her place while Teacher Shan cast a pointed glare. She was angry and little did she know that before her eyes at the very moment was her friend!</p>
<p>The Lu Family, naturally, Ye Zhen wouldn’t let them have a good end. Yet, after experiencing love from Lu Yaoyao’s family, she had decided to seek revenge only from those who wronged her. She wouldn’t be as ungrateful as Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan rubbed her eyes and found that she had said too much tonight. “You should go back inside. I just had a drink and I am not in a good mood.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t a bit surprised, she smelled of wine and her eyes showed the despair she felt inside.</p>
<p>She completely understood her. It took her a long time to get out of the sadness of her father and brother’s murder. Teacher Shan had lost her, a friend.</p>
<p>If only she could tell her that she was Ye Zhen! But she couldn’t…</p>
<p>“Teacher, I’m tired today. Please have an early rest, too,” Ye Zhen said softly.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan looked at her student’s face and finally sighed. “I see.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned into the courtyard, stood by the door, and turned around. She saw that Teacher Shan was no longer standing in the courtyard.</p>
<p>“Third Miss, you’re back!” Dai Mei came up and took off the cape she wore to protect herself from the freezing cold outside.</p>
<p>Especially these recent days, the nights had been palpably gloomy and cold. Just before sunset, the maids would scurry back inside the mansion to find refuge.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m a little thirsty. Please make me a glass of honey water.” Ye Zhen ordered lightly before disappearing behind the screen to wash her face and her body. She had been dropping her elixir in her baths these days, so she purposely didn’t want Dai Mei to serve her.</p>
<p>Only when she was fully clothed did she come out from behind the screen with her hair down.</p>
<p>Dai Mei brought the drink and looked at Ye Zhen’s waist-length hair and said, “Third Miss’ hair is getting better and better!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at the hair falling on her chest and noticed how different it was from before. Her inky black hair gained vibrance and was now thick and healthy until its ends.</p>
<p>“It seems to be good to wash ones hair with <a href="https://nutritionreview.org/2011/12/he-shou-wu/">Shou Wu</a> extract,” Ye Zhen said with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? This handmaiden thinks that even the Fourth Miss’ hair is not as good as yours! Third Miss’ skin is also getting better and better,” Dai Mei said proudly, insinuating that the better Ye Zhen looked, the stronger was the proof that she had been of good service.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed. “Don’t let Fourth Sister hear this, otherwise, you will be punished.”</p>
<p>Dai Mei covered her mouth and shook her head. “I dare not let her hear of this.”</p>
<p>“Well, you should now go and take a rest. I don’t want you to wait here.” Ye Zhen sent her out kindly.</p>
<p>“This handmaiden will take her leave but if Miss needs something, she can ring the bell and this handmaiden will come.” Dai Mei curtsied before leaving Ye Zhen’s chambers.</p>
<p>All alone, Ye Zhen sat on her plush bed, eyes low on her right palm while her other hand held the drink Dai Mei gave her.</p>
<p>It just occurred to her that she entertained the idea of drinking the elixir it emitted! For so many days, she had been using the drops carefully in fear of any bad effect. However, the effects were obviously excellent.</p>
<p><i>What would happen if she tried to drink it?</i></p>
<p>Upon her discovery of the elixir which bore the deep color of blood, she felt fear but soon calmed down.</p>
<p>Literally, she’d witnessed miracles since her death. Her soul was afloat in the imperial palace for two years and she was soon reborn in no other than her twin sister’s body! Not only that, she woke up two years back in time, just days after her death! What other strange things in this world could she not accept?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took a deep breath, as she held the drink beneath her palm and watched one drop of the elixir mix with the honey water.</p>
<p>All things had to be tried before the results were known. She thought that since the elixir could heal wounds and make her more beautiful, it must also be edible!</p>
<p>She took the glass of honey water mixed with one drop of the liquid and poured all of its content into her throat.</p>
<p>Apart from the warmth that spread inside her belly, she felt no uncomfortable feeling.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of waiting, she still felt nothing unusual. Ye Zhen shook her head and smiled to herself as she thought she was being ridiculous.</p>
<p>Then, she laid down on her bed and soon drifted into a deep slumber.</p>
