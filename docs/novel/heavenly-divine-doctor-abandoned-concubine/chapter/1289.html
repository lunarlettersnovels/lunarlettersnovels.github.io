<p>Without thinking twice, Tang Zhen nodded. “What if you lose then?”</p>

<p>He didn’t expect this girl to have such a good eye, thus picking his silver whip at a glance. It was not an easy-to-get treasure. In fact, it was the last piece of its kind in the world!</p>
<p>“I’m a weak woman. What’s so strange about losing a hunting contest to you? You must be ashamed to ask me for something.”</p>
<p>The others all burst out laughing saying Ye Zhen had  spoken very well.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen actually did not know these people, at least in her lifetime, she had never seen them, but she knew that these people are the most trusted men of Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>In her years as a vengeful spirit in the palace, she had often seen Tang Zhen. The way he easily talked to everyone without a care, including Lu Lingzhi, told her that his achievements were still above Lu Lingzhi’s.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen smiled wryly. “You’re too clever as a younger sister.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi intervened, and in a clear voice said, “Do you dare compete?”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen laughed, he had never been more sure his entire life than in this moment!</p>
<p>“Ah, Third Younger Sister, Elder Brother Tang Zhen will let you have three arrows. The one who shoots a sika deer first wins!”</p>
<p>“Good.” Ye Zhen nodded and mounted her horse again. “Then I’ll go first.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi frowned at Ye Zhen’s disappearing figure in the woods and said to Lu Xiangzhi, “Fourth Brother, do hurry up, Third Sister is not familiar with this place.”</p>
<p>He told Lu Xiangzhi to keep up with Ye Zhen’s horse.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen smugly looked ahead, the people next to him drew closer and asked him eagerly, “You got this silver whip from the emperor with great difficulty. Are you really willing to give it to that little girl?”</p>
<p>“The silver whip is precious, but isn’t that little girl more precious?” Tang Zhen imagined the girl holding the silver whip. <i>She would be breathtaking,</i> he thought.</p>
<p>“Go, go, go and we shall see!” Someone urged as they couldn’t wait to know whether the Third Miss Lu would win against Tang Zhen.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi caught up with Ye Zhen and turned to her and waned softly.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, the deeper the forest goes, the more dangerous it is. You cannot risk your own safety for the sake of winning or losing.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen ignored his plea. <i>What was there to be worried about? She was very familiar with this place…</i></p>
<p>She used to come here to hunt with her father and her second brother. When she thought of her father and her second brother, she felt a twinge of pain in her heart and hated Lu Lingzhi beside her even more…</p>
<p>“If you are worried about danger, you do not have to follow me, I have my brother with me,” Ye Zhen said in a seething tone.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi, who had just arrived just in time to hear her words, scolded her immediately.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, how can you talk to Eldest Brother like that?” His face was full of disappointment and was a bit red out of embarrassment.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi motioned with his hand. “Third Sister is still young.”</p>
<p>He looked at Ye Zhen’s unhappy side face. “Eldest Brother only cares about you. He meant well,” said Lu Lingzhi patiently as though she was a child in fit who needed pacifying, and more patience.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pressed down the hatred in her heart, pulled the reins and continued to advance deeper in the forest.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother, Yaoyao… she’s a little short-tempered, others say she is hard to deal sometimes. But I’m certain that she meant no offense.” Lu Xiangzhi spoke well of his sister.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi nodded in understanding. “I know, you watch her carefully.”</p>
<p>He could already feel that his third sister disliked him because he would not let her go to the Academy for Women.</p>
<p>It also didn’t escape Lu Lingzhi’s heedful senses how reluctant she was when she called him eldest brother, but when she called Lu Xiangzhi her elder brother, she was intimate and tender. That’s what a sister should look like.</p>
<p>Looking at Ye Zhen galloping farther and farther, Lu Lingzhi hurried up.</p>
<p><i>Why did she seem to be familiar with this place? Has she, by any chance, visited this place before?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen was indeed very familiar with it. She knew where the deer herds were the most. She used to only like to hunt small animals, but her second brother liked to hunt sika deer here and taught her how to properly hunt.</p>
