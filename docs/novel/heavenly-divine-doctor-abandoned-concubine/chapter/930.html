            <p><strong>Chapter 399 – Where Is She? (2)</strong></p>
<p>Lu Wushuang shook her head. “Why would I ever harm you, Your Majesty. I love you.”</p>
<p>“Then what about Yaoyao? She is your cousin. Do you not feel the slightest bit of guilt when using her?” Mo Rongzhan demanded. <em>How could a selfish woman like Lu Wushuang have saved him back then?</em> He found it funny that he only saw her for what she was now.</p>
<p>“I never hurt her. It was her… She was the one who told me to go to Xinhe Palace.” Lu Wushuang’s gaze was jumpy. She didn’t like Lu Yaoyao. She had known this from the first time she had seen her. Even if she was a princess now, she still felt threatened. If she could eliminate her two biggest worries at the same time, why shouldn’t she do it?</p>
<p>A sliver of disgust rose in Mo Rongzhan’s eyes. “You’re still thinking about harming her at this time?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I am really innocent.” Lu Wushuang shouted, crying. “Why will you believe in Yaoyao but not me?!”</p>
<p>“In my heart, you can’t even compare to the tip of one of Yaoyao’s fingers.” His voice was as cold as ice.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang was taken aback, she stared at him. A suspicion she had deeply concealed in her heart gradually resurfaced. She looked at Mo Rongzhan’s cold, handsome face. You and Yaoyao… She seduced you? That little b****! I knew I couldn’t keep her around.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan felt that dismissing Lu Wushuang’s position as Gui Fei was undoubtedly correct. If he continued to keep her, she would harm Yaoyao sooner or later.</p>
<p>“It looks like I shouldn’t have dismissed you. I should have killed you,” he said frostily.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang cried aloud, “You can’t kill me, Your Majesty. Have you forgotten? I saved you… You said that you would be good to me for the rest of our lives!”</p>
<p>His thin lips curled into a shallow smile, his voice growing deep and magnetic like there was a hint of coaxing in it. “Lu Wushuang, I have something to ask you. If you answer me honestly, I assure you that you will live in comfort for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p>She thought this was Mo Rongzhan agreeing to forgive her. “Your Majesty, just ask. As long as I know the answer, I’ll tell you everything.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked down at her coldly. “Lu Wushuang, where is the girl that once saved me?”</p>
<p>“——” Lu Wushuang didn’t react in time. Her eyes grew round with fear. She wondered if she had heard him wrong.</p>
<p>“You have her jade pendant, and know what had happened between me and her. Lu Wushuang, you definitely know where she is,” Mo Rongzhan said quietly.</p>
<p>“I didn’t—” Lu Wushuang blurted out. <em>No!</em> She aggressively shook her head. “I saved you! It was I who saved you in the well.”</p>
<p>“Then what is your nickname? Have you forgotten that you told me your nickname in the well?” he asked sternly.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang’s expression soured. <em>Ye Zhen’s nickname? She couldn’t find it. Even her Eldest Brother couldn’t find it. How was she going to answer Mo Rongzhan?</em></p>
<p>“I… I had a nickname when I was young. But it has been too long since anyone has used it. I forgot it,” said she.</p>
<p>His smile deepened but it sent a chill down her back. “You can even forget your old name. Well, then you must remember that I once told you a secret.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang’s jaw dropped. <em>Eldest Brother had never told her about this. What else did that b**** Ye Zhen know?</em></p>
<p>“You don’t know anything.” Mo Rongzhan said coldly, “Lu Wushuang, I’ll ask you one more time. Where is she?”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang let out a smile even uglier than a grimace. <em>He knew! He had long known she wasn’t the person that had saved him. No wonder he had been so cold to her these days! </em>“She’s dead!”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s eyes were cold. “Who is she?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know!”</p>
<p>Although Lu Wushuang wasn’t smart enough she was still well aware of the consequences of telling the truth on this matter. She couldn’t let Mo Rongzhan know it had been Ye Zhen who had saved him, or it would definitely implicate Eldest Brother. Perhaps even the entirety of the Lu Family would be in danger. She couldn’t drag Eldest Brother and the Lu Family into anything now. Otherwise, who would come to save her in the future?</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan asked another question, “Who was it who gave you her jade pendant. Lu Wushuang, you can refuse to answer. However, I will make the rest of your life a living hell.”</p>
<p>“It was my father!” In fear, he brought out her already deceased father. “I don’t know where my father hid her, and don’t know who she was. This was given to me by my father. He taught me to do this!”</p>
<p>“Does Lu Lingzhi know about this?” He narrowed his eyes and asked. No one could tell if he actually believed what she said.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang hurriedly shook her head. “My Eldest Brother knows nothing. If he knew, he wouldn’t have let us do this.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s gaze fell heavily on her for a while. “Lu Wushuang, if she is really dead, you can go keep her company.”</p>
<p><em>Ye Zhen has already been dead as could be for a long time!</em> Lu Wushuang screamed in her heart. But she didn’t dare beg for forgiveness before Mo Rongzhan again.</p>
<p>He didn’t have the slightest bit of pity for her now.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, is it that because I am not her… you haven’t the slightest bit of regard for me?” she lowered her head and asked quietly.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan just coldly looked at her, turning to leave the Palace of Earthly Tranquility.</p>
