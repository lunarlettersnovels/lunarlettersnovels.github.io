<p><strong>Chapter 442 – Remember Your Identity (1)</strong></p>
<p>Xu Huiru was very clear about what she was talking about. She already knew the emperor’s thoughts about Lu Yaoyao. Therefore, she now wanted to test the girl herself, whether she wanted to enter the palace to fight for favor or not…</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, <em>bengong</em> knows you want to be a physician just like Qi Yizheng, but do not forget that you are now a princess. Could you possibly stay in the palace forever?” Xu Huiru said with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her blankly and blandly replied, “Whether I stay in the palace or not… How does it matter to Xu <em>Xianfei</em>?”</p>
<p>“<em>Bengong</em> just wants you to remember your identity. You are a princess and the emperor’s sister. Surely, Empress Dowager must not want such a thing to happen in the palace,” Xu Huiru said, voice low while keeping a decent expression on her face.</p>
<p><em>****?</em> Ye Zhen was furious and outraged. <em>Where on earth did Xu Huiru come to know about this?</em></p>
<p>“Xu <em>Xianfei</em>, if your esteemed self is so worried about such a taboo happening between the emperor and me, you should go and tell the emperor,” Ye Zhen said, tone deceptively light despite the anger in her heart. “It’s useless for you to threaten me.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru snorted coldly. “<em>Bengong</em> isn’t threatening you. <em>Bengong </em>is just reminding you that you must remember your identity and refrain from doing something that will end up taking your life one day. Once there is a scandal in the palace, who do you think Empress Dowager will shield? You? Or the emperor?”</p>
<p>Ye Zheng lightly glanced at Xu Huiru and said, “Thank you Xu <em>Xianfei</em> for worrying.”</p>
<p>“You… You dare to say that there is no wishful thinking?” Xu Huiru exclaimed with a low voice, angry and confused. <em>Why does Lu Yaoyao look so calm? Is she not nervous and afraid at all? Once Empress Dowager knows that she has seduced the emperor, it will be a dead-end for her! So, why?</em></p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about those things. ****? Truly, Xu Xianfei has such a rich imagination!” Ye Zhen snorted coldly. What Mo Rongzhan did to her in the Palace of Heavenly Purity was indeed something Empress Dowager would not tolerate at all. However, she did not need to be worried as she would definitely not let the same thing happen to her again.</p>
<p>Anyway, he had given her a year’s time, right? She could take advantage of this one-year period of time to find her father. Then, once she found him, she would drop everything and go to him.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru, on the other hand, was still full of doubt. <em>True, listening to Lu Yaoyao’s words, she did not seem to have such a mind for the emperor. So, is it the emperor’s own wishful thinking?</em></p>
<p>Alas, Ye Zhen no longer wished to talk to Xu Huiru. Because the more she spoke, the more she was unable to know how to deal with herself. To the point that now she was unable to understand how she should face Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>At first, she hated him for bestowing her a poisoned wine; hated him for his indifference to her; hated her own mistaken infatuation; and hated even more for killing her father and brother. However, now she knew the truth. He didn’t want her dead nor did he kill her father and brother… So, what else did she hate about him?</p>
<p>Hated that he had mistaken her for someone else? Hated that he had mistaken Lu Wushuang for her? Hated the fact that he still misunderstood Ye Zhen?</p>
<p>At this point, Ye Zhen’s heart was tired, and didn’t feel like hating him anymore; because the more she hated, the more she couldn’t let the past go. However, her heart unexpectedly did not want to let the past go. She had once loved Mo Rongzhan… But she also did not dare nor want to love him again.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, she had already arrived at the Palace of Heavenly Purity.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru came behind her, having lost her aggressiveness on the road and looking as docile and kind as she usually did, and said, “Princess, let’s go in and see the emperor.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at Eunuch Fu and asked, “Eunuch Fu, is His Majesty currently in the imperial study?”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu bowed and said, “Princess, His Majesty has just returned to the palace hall to rest.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll have to trouble Eunuch Fu to pass on the message of our arrival to the emperor,” Ye Zhen said in a low voice.</p>
<p>If it was only the princess, Eunuch Fu would not hesitate to say ‘There is no need for me to pass it on to His Majesty, you can simply go in.’. However, there was also Xu <em>Xianfei</em> next to her, so he could not do that. Thus, he had to answer as appropriate and turned around to go in to report to Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>When Mo Rongzhan heard that Yaoyao had come with Xu Huiru, he frowned and said, “Let them all go back. <em>Zhen</em> is going to go to Cining Palace in a moment.”</p>
<p>Outside the Palace of Heavenly Purity, Ye Zhen could not help but let the corner of her mouth raise slightly into a light smile when she heard the message Eunuch Fu brought before she spoke. “In that case, Eunuch Fu, we shall go back first.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru was inevitably disappointed that she was unable to see Mo Rongzhan, yet seeing that Lu Yaoyao was also dismissed made her feel better, so she did not make a fuss and quietly retreated.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not go back to Cining Palace. Instead, after asking someone to go back and inform Empress Dowager, she went to the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard.</p></div>
