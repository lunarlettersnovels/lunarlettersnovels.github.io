            <p><strong>Chapter 513 – Despicable and Shameless Lu Lingzhi</strong></p>
<p>Since the time she learned Mo Rongzhan had saved her father and elder brother, she had let go of her resentment towards him. Faced with his persistent and domineering attitude, she had even become powerless to refuse. She had intended to return to the capital this time to tell him the truth.</p>
<p>She wanted to tell him that the person who saved him was Ye Zhen, as well the secret code and the words she had said to him back then. She would let him know that the reason she(YZ) married him was that she loved him, not for anything else, and especially not as Ye Yisong’s chess piece. If he was willing to accept her(YZ) as his original Little Yaoyao, then she might tell him the truth that she was Ye Zhen. If he could not, then everything would be meaningless. She would not say anything more.</p>
<p>However, she probably didn’t need to say anything now. He already had a favorite and desired savior. Ye Yaoyao in the palace… She was probably the Lu Wushuang that she had seen in her previous life. She would become Mo Rongzhan’s most favored in the inner palace.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes were a little sore. She raised her head to look at the blue sky, not letting the tears gush out. She felt sad. But what was there to be sad about? Wasn’t this something she already knew? This was just things getting back on track.</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang was dead. All she had to do was make sure Lu Lingzhi got his just rewards, then everything would be over, and she could leave.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, since you don’t want to go back, I’ll stay and help you.” Tang Zhen walked over and looked at her jade-like face.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen blinked and smiled at him. “All right.” After a pause, she asked in a low voice, “How come my eldest brother told you about this? He was not afraid… Will it implicate the Lu family?”</p>
<p>“When the late Gui Ren Lu lied to the emperor, His Majesty already knew about the matter. He only found out later that Eldest Master Lu and Gui Ren Lu conspired to deceive him. Your eldest brother didn’t know what to do, so I suggested that he enter the palace to beg for forgiveness. After I left the capital, he probably heeded my advice. Don’t worry, the rest of your family doesn’t know about this. The emperor will not do anything to the Lu family because they have contributed a lot.” Tang Zhen comforted her.</p>
<p><em>Eldest Master Lu imprisoned the emperor’s savior? Lu Lingzhi went to beg for forgiveness? </em>Ye Zhen felt that there was nothing more amusing than this. Lu Lingzhi knew better than anyone who saved Mo Rongzhan. He had poisoned her in the Duke of Qin’s estate because of Lu Wushuang. Now that she(LWS) had died, for the sake of the Lu family, not only did he blame her for all the crimes but also dragged his late father into the water. There was no one more despicable and heartless than Marquis Anyang.</p>
<p>“Not only will His Majesty not punish Lu Lingzhi but might even use him more because of his honesty and loyalty,” she remarked.</p>
<p>It had to be said that Lu Lingzhi really knew Mo Rongzhan thoroughly — his principles and values.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen thought her tone was a little odd, so he glanced at her and said in a low voice, “Only Lu Wushuang knew about this, Lingzhi only recently learned about it.”</p>
<p>“How long have you known him for?” she smiled and asked.</p>
<p>“Your eldest brother? It’s been many years…,” he said. They could be regarded as brothers who could live and die together on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said indifferently, “I’ve known him for so many years, but I don’t even know what kind of person he is. It seems like he really knows how to pretend.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen furrowed his brows and looked at her. He had noticed from the beginning that Yaoyao did not like her eldest brother very much. He was clearly her big cousin, so why did she always mention him with sarcasm and hostility? “Yaoyao, do you have any misunderstanding about Lingzhi?”</p>
<p>“I do have a huge misunderstanding with him.” She chuckled. “Big Brother Tang, you should leave this village first.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t return to the capital, I naturally won’t leave,” he said firmly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen thought for a moment and said in a low voice, “I don’t want you to get typhoid fever, and Xu Ji is still eyeing you like a tiger watching its prey. If you want to stay, why don’t you investigate Governor-general Zhang? Huaijiang City was under Ye Yisong’s control. They not only embezzled the disaster funds but also lied about the epidemic every year. The medicinal herbs sent by the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard never entered Huaijiang City. The last time I saw the medicinal herbs, they were brought by Xu Ji in the special sack of the Imperial Physicians’ Courtyard. This matter is too strange. Xue Lin found out that this batch was sent directly from the Governor-general’s Mansion, you are the only one who can investigate this matter, Big Brother Tang.”</p>
<p>“What? They’re coveting disaster funds and medicinal herbs. Those people have the guts to do such a heartless thing?” Tang Zhen was furious. “That Ye Yisong was evil, and his people are scums too.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t want to judge Ye Yisong. Although she knew that he wasn’t a good person, he was still an elder after all. “He(YY) long dead. Now that there are still people doing such things, I think we should investigate.”</p>
<p>“Xu Ji wouldn’t dare to set fire, don’t worry. I’m leaving… Do you want to stay here?” He was worried about her.</p>
<p>“Don’t I have my master and Xue Lin? Besides, Xu Ji knows you’ve been here before, so how would he dare to do anything to me? Go ahead.” She smiled faintly.</p>
<p>He knew that even if he tried to persuade her, the little girl would not return to the capital with him at this time. He would not be able to help her if he stayed in the village. It would be better to investigate the matter of embezzlement first, and then go back to the capital with her. “Then I’ll go to Huainan first. If this matter has something to do with Governor-general Zhang, I would need to report it to the emperor.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Be careful.” He reminded.</p>
<p>Because of the Marquis of Jing Ning’s arrival, Xu Ji didn’t dare to threaten Ye Zhen anymore. Even if he knew that Tang Zhen had temporarily left, he could only lead troops to guard the village gate. Zheng Yulong couldn’t afford to neglect her now either, and even personally came into the village to deliver medicine.</p>
<p>After two days, the villagers finally recovered from their fever. On the fourth day, Zheng Yulong ordered the removal of the fence and allowed the villagers in the city to return home. The doctors who had escaped from the village had also made their way back. They were more active in giving the villagers follow-up visits than ever.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen and Huangfu Chen only smiled at their diligence. After leaving behind the medicines, they all returned to the city.</p>
<p>“By the way, Master, I forgot to tell you something.” It was only now that she recalled the matter with Zhao Tianji. She was so worried about Huangfu Chen’s illness that she had forgotten all about this. “I met Zhao Tianji in the city the other day. I don’t know if he has left or not.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen was slightly startled. “Was he in Huaijiang City?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, he said that he was passing by this place and decided to take a look. If he knew that you were sick, he wouldn’t have left yet,” she said.</p>
<p>“Where did you see him?”Huangfu Chen asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gestured to the Wangjiang in front of her. “Right there.”</p>
