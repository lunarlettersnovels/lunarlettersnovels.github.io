<p>“Hmmph!” Lu Lingzhi grunted in pain, looking at her delicate hands.</p>
<p>Despite this, he chuckled, deeming it as just a pure clumsy mistake. “Yaoyao, show me some mercy.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi seemed apologetic and looked at Ye Zhen through the corner of his eye. “Yaoyao, be careful.”</p>
<p>“I am inexperienced. Naturally, I’m not good at changing dressings.” Ye Zhen reasoned grumpily.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, I didn’t feel any pain.” Lu Lingzhi managed a soft smile.</p>
<p>Despite his patient approach, Ye Zhen still didn’t look at him. She proceeded to smear the medicine on his bare wound and tied the board which put his injured foot in place afterwards.</p>
<p>“The bone has healed, but still not strong enough. Eldest Brother should take some rest and not exert himself.”</p>
<p>Well, if Lu Xiangzhi hadn’t given her medicine to him, he would not have recovered so quickly.</p>
<p>“Fourth Brother, these days I can’t go anywhere. Why don’t you come here to study and I will teach you?” Lu Lingzhi offered, having enough of the everyday silence in his chambers.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi’s eyes instantly brightened. “Yes, Eldest Brother, then I must get my books!”</p>
<p>As a candidate for the imperial exam, Lu Xiangzhi was ecstatic at this opportunity. Being taught by Lu Lingzhi was much better than learning from other scholars.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen watched Lu Xiangzhi run out in excitement and shook her head amusingly.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, thank you for changing the dressing for eldest brother.” Lu Lingzhi expressed his gratitude upon seeing her about to leave.</p>
<p>“You are welcome. It was nothing.”</p>
<p>In the long run, Lu Lingzhi still saved Lu Xiangzhi. This was the most she could do as repayment for that act.</p>
<p>Just as she reached the door, Lu Lingzhi spoke again, stopping her in her tracks.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, do you hate your eldest brother so much?” Lu Lingzhi asked her helplessly.</p>
<p>Those words sounded strange from the mouth of someone she detested. Ye Zhen refused to look at him and answer his question, her back facing him.</p>
<p>“Still complaining that I won’t let you go to the academy?” Lu Lingzhi asked laughingly, that’s what he said the first time they met.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen vividly remembered the day she saw him again after her transmigration. From that moment until now, she could not stomach treating him as her eldest brother.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was silent, her hatred for Lu Lingzhi had accumulated for two years. Even though she had tried to restrain herself, she could not pretend to like him at all.</p>
<p>“Or is it because someone said something about the Ye Family?” Lu Lingzhi saw that she would not answer at any moment, so he asked regarding his suspicion in a low voice.</p>
<p>Pivoting on her heels, Ye Zhen turned around to look at his face. <i>What does he mean by this?</i></p>
<p>“What did Teacher Shan say to you?” Lu Lingzhi thought he was right and asked in a heavy voice.</p>
<p>“What did you do to the Ye Family?” Ye Zhen asked back, looking at him with a penetrating gaze.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi whispered. “Whatever I did, it was not my original intention.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sneered in her heart. <i>Not his original intention? Including deceiving her trust, luring her into disclosing how she saved Mo Rongzhan, and then turning all those things into Lu Wushuang’s doing– was it all not his original intention</i>?</p>
<p>“The late Wang Fei of the Qin Dynasty is a former student of Teacher Shan and therefore, my scholarly elder sister. How did she die?” Ye Zhen asked in a stern voice, stable enough to not let Lu Lingzhi see through her displayed calm dexterity.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi remembered the scene when Ye Zhen drank the poisoned wine and couldn’t help but close his eyes.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei’s palace caught fire; she was burned to death.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled faintly. “The young lady was just unlucky, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to others about everything. Some truths need to be discovered by yourself,” Lu Lingzhi said.</p>
<p><i>She knew the truth better than anyone else!</i></p>
<p>“I have to go back to practice calligraphy, Eldest Brother. Get well.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen turned around, she could no longer show her dissatisfaction with the Ye Family’s case, or she would arouse suspicions.</p>
<p>That day in front of Tang Zhen, it was she who had lost control.</p>
