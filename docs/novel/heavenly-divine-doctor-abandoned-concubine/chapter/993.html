            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 336 – Inexplicably Jealous (1)</strong></p>
<p>It was rare when Mo Rongzhan would wrap his official matters early, and today was one such. He had already finished reviewing the court memorials. He was under the impression Lu Yaoyao would stay at the palace for a few days. And today, he had planned to play chess with her again.</p>
<p>But when he got to the inner courtyard, he found out that she had already left the palace for the Lu Mansion. Upon not being able to see her, he was a little disappointed and stopped by Little Prince’s Palace.</p>
<p>“What are you writing?” Mo Rongzhan asked as he entered the room, seeing his younger brother engrossed in the act.</p>
<p>When Mo Rongyi saw his Imperial Brother here, he hurriedly got up and bowed. Then, pointing to the list on the desktop said, “Imperial Brother, I’m writing an invitation. You see, this is the list that Yaoyao wrote last night.”</p>
<p>“It was all written by her?” When Mo Rongzhan saw the content inside, his expression turned dark. <em>How could that girl know about which young masters were of good temperance?</em></p>
<p>“Yes, Imperial Brother, Yaoyao is really amazing. She knows everything.” Mo Rongyi sighed.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan wasn’t happy before, but now he had… an impulse to kill. “Don’t let other people know that Yaoyao gave you this.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Mo Rongyi asked confusedly.</p>
<p>“Because I said so,” Mo Rongzhan said with a cold face. “After you finish with the invitations, send them over to me.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi saw that his expression was not pretty, so he didn’t dare to ask more. He could only agree in a soft voice.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving now.” Mo Rongzhan snorted coldly and strode out.</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu hurriedly followed.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan went to the Palace of Heavenly Purity and saw that the cabinet ministers were still working. When they saw the emperor coming in, they knelt down and bowed.</p>
<p>“Continue working, I am just here to take a look,” Mo Rongzhan said softly and sat down in the upper armchair.</p>
<p>The ministers glanced at Mo Rongzhan nervously. They didn’t dare delay and soon finished handling everything they had at hand.</p>
<p>As he rested, Mo Rongzhan looked at Minister Liu, who had married off his daughter not long ago. “Secretary Liu, before you married off your daughter, did you carefully investigate all the young talents in the capital?”</p>
<p>Secretary Liu was taken aback for a moment, and hurriedly lowered his head and answered back, “Answering the emperor, I would inquire about one or two and then investigate all of them at once… it is a bit much.”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Xu said with a smile, “I have heard that some people scope out all the young talents, find the best, and bring them home for their daughters to choose from.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Mo Rongzhan frowned.</p>
<p>“There is indeed such a thing. Your Imperial Majesty, are you planning to marry off Princess Furong?” Prime Minister Xu asked with a smile.</p>
<p><em>Planning to marry off Lu Yaoyao? Unless he suddenly went crazy, how would he be willing to marry her off to another man!</em></p>
<p><em>The reason why she knew so many things about the young masters of the aristocratic families was because the Lu Family had been planning a marriage for her? So that was why they went to investigate the details of those people?</em></p>
<p>Thinking up to here, Mo Rongzhan felt a fury rise in his chest, and he was unable to find an outlet to vent.</p>
<p>“If you want to arrange a marriage for Princess Furong, I can recommend someone to Your Imperial Majesty.” Prime Minister Xu didn’t notice the dark clouds looming on Mo Rongzhan’s mien this time. He simply interpreted it as the emperor worrying over Lu Yaoyao’s marriage.</p>
<p>A sneer appeared at the corners of Mo Rongzhan’s mouth. “Who would Prime Minister Xu recommend?”</p>
<p>“I think Marquis Jing Ning is a good candidate. He also seems to be very interested in the princess,” Prime Minister Xu said with a smile.</p>
<p><em>Tang Zhen?</em> Mo Rongzhan’s eyes darkened slightly. He remembered that Lu Yaoyao had tried hunting with Tang Zhen before. <em>Could it be that Tang Zhen was already interested in her?</em></p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, I also recommend—” Others immediately chimed in.</p>
<p>As of today, there was only one princess in the entire Country of Jin, and she was very treasured by the empress dowager. Seeing the emperor’s attitude, it seemed that he also valued ​​Princess Furong. If they could become the Princess Consort… naturally, it was an opportunity to enjoy inexhaustible glory and wealth.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan stood up and said coldly, “Princess Furong has not graduated from the academy, and isn’t in a hurry for marriage. Just keep working.”</p>
<p>“—” The ministers were flabbergasted.<em> If he refused to make a marriage appointment for Princess Furong, why then did the emperor ask so much just now?</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan strode out without looking back. He didn’t even go to the imperial study. Instead, he went straight to the sleeping quarters to the rear. When he thought about the fact that Lu Yaoyao was already considering a candidate to marry, he wished to capture her back, lock her in the palace and never let her leave.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty—” Eunuch Fu called out cautiously. “Actually, there are still two girls in the Lu Family waiting to be married. Perhaps, it’s for them—”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan glanced at the other coldly. “Leave!”</p>
<p>When Eunuch Fu saw that the hostility in the eyes of his liege had dissipated by a lot, he knew that he was not angry, so he held back a smile and retreated.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan suddenly felt a little glad that Lu Yaoyao was Princess Furong. At least her marriage was not something that the Lu Family could take care of. Otherwise… he really didn’t know if he could stop her from marrying someone else.</p>
