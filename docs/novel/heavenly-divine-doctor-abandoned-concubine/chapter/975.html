            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 354 – Pretending to Be Sick</strong></p>
<p>“This concubine will care more about the emperor in the future.” With the words of the empress dowager, Xu Huiru felt that she had more excuses to care for the emperor.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen lowered her head, the corners of her mouth tightened slightly. Now, it was one thing that she despised Mo Rongzhan, but she had loved him for several years and it was definitely not a fake. Seeing him now surrounded by so many women, she felt… Somewhat uncomfortable in her heart.</p>
<p>Right then, a place attendant walked in from outside and said after curtsying, “Reporting to the empress dowager, Wang Fei is feeling unwell today. Hearing that Princess Furong entered the palace, Wang Fei wishes to invite Princess Furong over.”</p>
<p><em>Why would Lu Wushuang want to see her again? </em>A wave of impatience flashed through Ye Zhen’s eyes.</p>
<p>When Xu Huiru raised her head, she happened to catch sight of the emotions in Ye Zhen’s eyes, she lowered her head and her lips curved upwards into a smile.</p>
<p>The empress dowager said to Ye Zhen, “Wang Fei Lu is probably worried about Marquis Anyang. Yaoyao, go ahead.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had no desire to go in the slightest, but the empress dowager had spoken, what else could she do?</p>
<p>“Yes, Empress Dowager.” Ye Zhen responded in a soft voice.</p>
<p>When she arrived at the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, Ye Zhen frowned and looked at Lu Wushuang. “Wang Fei, you were looking for me?”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang put one hand on her chest and said, “Yaoyao, you are back. Quickly tell me, what happened to Eldest Brother?”</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother has returned, but the residual poison in his body has yet to be purged. He needs Imperial Physician Qi to remove the remaining poison for him.” Ye Zhen looked at the other passively. “I heard Wang Fei is not feeling well, why don’t you invite the imperial physician?”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang was weak with relief. “I was just worried about my eldest brother. Now that I know that he is back safely, I feel much relieved.”</p>
<p>“Since Wang Fei is okay, then I will take my leave first,” Ye Zhen said. It was plain as day to her that Lu Wushuang was not sick at all, <em>who is she trying to fake her illness for?</em></p>
<p>Lu Wushuang hurriedly stopped her. “Yaoyao, the emperor has not seen me for a long time. Can you persuade him, I want to see him.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen almost laughed. <em>Mo Rongzhan didn’t come to see Lu Wushuang, and she expects her to have a way to make him love her again?</em></p>
<p>“Wang Fei, how can the emperor listen to me? If you want to see him, just have someone invite him over,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>She still remembered how Mo Rongzhan spoiled Lu Wushuang in her previous life. At that time, he had never doubted her as he always thought she was the one who saved him back then. Even if Lu Wushuang was jealous, he would still pamper and fulfill her wishes; even if she was indifferent and cold, he would never let her status be threatened.</p>
<p>In this life… Ye Zhen was still confused. <em>Why did Mo Rongzhan suddenly remember the nickname she had mentioned before? In the past, he could never remember it…</em></p>
<p>Lu Wushuang said bitterly, “One doesn’t know what methods she used, that Xu Huiru has coaxed the emperor from visiting me. Yaoyao, you are now a princess, you can always speak well of me to the emperor.”</p>
<p>“How do you want me to speak for you?” Ye Zhen asked with a smile. <em>How long could Lu Wushuang survive in the palace without Lu Lingzhi? She doesn’t even compare to Xu Huiru!</em> Without Mo Rongzhan’s favor, at least she must know how to honor and be filial to the empress dowager. And yet she actually pretended to be sick every day as an excuse to not visit her.</p>
<p>Thinking that her cousin was willing to find Mo Rongzhan for her, Lu Wushuang happily said, “Just say I miss him and I want to see him. If I don’t see him, my illness will not get any better.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen suddenly felt that she wasn’t obligated to do anything for Lu Wushuang. With the other’s intelligence, she had already walked the path of a dead end.</p>
<p>“I will do my best,” Ye Zhen said lightly. “However, the empress dowager seems to want Xianfei to care about the emperor. Perhaps… It is unlikely for the emperor to want to see me.”</p>
<p>As Lu Wushuang heard that Xu Huiru was competing for favour with her again, her facial expressions instantly darkened with hatred.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen left the Palace of Earthly Tranquility in an especially good mood. Regarding Lu Wushuang, she didn’t need to lift a finger at all. She believed a dead-end would be upon her in a short time.</p>
<p>“Princess.” Eunuch Fu had concealed himself beside the cobblestoned path at some point.  Seeing Ye Zhen emerge from the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, he immediately revealed himself and stopped her.</p>
