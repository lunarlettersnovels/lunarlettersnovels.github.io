            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 161 – Am I Not Enough Anymore?</strong></p>
<p>This cold remark made Lu Wushuang stop for a second… Mo Rongzhan’s words felt like knives stabbing her heart.</p>
<p><i>Why should Lu Yaoyao watch over the sick little prince?</i> <i>She is not an imperial physician at the palace, so it was clear that the emperor has other motives,</i> Lu Wushuang thought scornfully.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, if you are tired of this wang fei, I can’t do anything about it. But Lu Yaoyao is my cousin. Does the emperor want to embarrass this wang fei?” Lu Wushuang’s face softened, her lashing dissipated for a while as she looked longingly at Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>“Am I not enough anymore?” she asked helplessly.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Lu Wushuang wanted to occupy the harem alone, even though the emperor was destined to have multiple wives. As Wang Fei, she was expected to accept this. Hence, her words sounded foolish to everyone.</p>
<p>“Lu Wushuang, you embarrass yourself.” Was the emperor’s remark before he removed his grasp on her arm, a resigned look on his face.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who stood watching the exchange, felt confused. This was far from what she had witnessed when she embodied nothing but a spirit watching over the happenings inside the imperial palace.</p>
<p>Before her transmigration—the period she woke up in her twin sister’s body and turned back two years in time—she remembered seeing Mo Rongzhan was very fond of Lu Wushuang. Even if she oppressed other concubines in the palace out of jealousy, the emperor always reminded her that she had a special place in his heart.</p>
<p><i>But how come, at this time, he is impatient with Lu Wushuang?</i></p>
<p><i>What is the reason for this change in events? </i>Ye Zhen surmised to herself. Things were rather different from her memory.</p>
<p>Just when Ye Zhen was absorbed in her thoughts, Lu Wushuang began to cry softly, which put her out of reverie. Mo Rongzhan, on the other hand, found himself unable to look at her pathetic state. This was the woman who he had once adored—the same woman who had tricked him!</p>
<p>Thus, he turned to Ye Zhen, and in an indifferent voice, said, “What are you still doing here?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen bowed her head and firmly answered. “Pardon, Your Majesty. This official’s daughter will leave at once.”</p>
<p>Just when Ye Zhen turned on her heels, the emperor spoke once more, halting her in her steps. “Fude, bring Third Miss Lu two bottles of the lotus ointment.”</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen looked up, his disappointed gaze was trained on the swollen palm print on her cheek.</p>
<p>Ordered by the emperor, Fude, who had been hanging his head in silence, moved into action.</p>
<p>“Y-yes, Your Majesty.” His voice was a little shaky. He hardly looked up at Ye Zhen. Just one look and he was already frightened to his core!</p>
<p><i>Third Miss Lu indeed looked too much like the former wang fei, even though her eyebrows and eyes were a little bit different. </i></p>
<p>The emperor had hardly seen Wang Fei Ye when she was still alive, but there were times when this eunuch’s eyes had caught a glimpse of her remarkable beauty. Upon Lu Yaoyao’s drastic change in appearance, he began to realize their uncanny resemblance.</p>
<p><i>She looked so much like Ye Zhen, the former wang fei.</i></p>
<p>He couldn’t help but sneer at this thought and feel that fate was indeed playful.</p>
<p>Amidst her sobs, Lu Wushuang heard perfectly that Mo Rongzhan ordered to hand two bottles of lotus ointment to Lu Yaoyao. This ointment was a rare medicine given as a tribute to the imperial palace. As the wang fei, she also got a bottle.</p>
<p><i>How could he give two to Lu Yaoyao so casually?</i></p>
<p><i>Not only that, he demanded to give her two bottles!</i></p>
<p>All this time, silently watching in astonishment, Lu Wushuang’s maid-in-waiting stood at the corner of the imperial garden and didn’t dare to involve herself in the scene.</p>
<p>Upon the emperor’s hand gesture to her, Dai Ping hurried over to assist her mistress.</p>
<p>Then, without giving Lu Wushuang a parting glance, Mo Rongzhan turned around and walked away. Lu Wushuang could only watch him grow the distance between them.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen followed immediately, but a sinister voice stopped her before she could even take two steps.</p>
<p>“Did I let you go already?” The wang fei contemptuously called her back. She was not yet done with her!</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, Third Miss Lu!” Aunt Cheng suddenly came up just as Lu Wushuang was about to begin an assault on Ye Zhen again.</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng must have been unable to see Lu Wushuang’s tears on her face for she smiled widely while approaching them. Ye Zhen released a deep sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“The empress dowager sent this handmaiden to fetch Third Miss Lu, fearing that she might get lost.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled back in return. “Aunt Cheng, you are just in time. This miss was going back to the empress dowager but was uncertain of the direction as the halls of the Cining Palace could be really confusing.”</p>
<p>Aunt Cheng gladly offered her hand and grinned. “This handmaiden is glad to lead the way for Third Miss Lu.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Aunt Cheng.” Ye Zhen looked at ease. She felt genuinely grateful for Aunt Cheng’s arrival.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, this handmaiden must bring Third Miss Lu to Empress Dowager and her grandmother at once. If the wang fei has no order, this handmaiden and Third Miss Lu must leave first.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang’s anger had not dissipated yet. However, due to Aunt Cheng’s intrusion, she finally found a little sense in her and forced a smile. “This wang fei doesn’t need anything. You can leave now.”</p>
<p><i>What happened to her today?</i> Lu Wushuang asked herself.</p>
<p>No matter how angry she used to be, she never lost her cool in front of Mo Rongzhan.</p>
<p>And most of all, he never defended other women in front of her. If it weren’t for Lu Yaoyao, all of this humiliation would not happen to her in the first place.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei?” Her maid-in-waiting behind her called her attention in a strained voice.</p>
<p>“Dai Ping, was I too impulsive today?” Lu Wushuang watched Ye Zhen disappear from her sight before she asked the maid-in-waiting in an almost whisper.</p>
<p>“Wang Fei, the emperor likes you the most. He will not be angry with you. Do not worry.”</p>
<p>Lu Wushuang smiled bitterly in her heart. She was also certain that Mo Rongzhan would not ignore her for long. He had always regarded her as a lifesaver.</p>
<p>However, since Lu Lingzhi told her that the emperor knew Ye Zhen had a nickname and therefore, giving him room for suspicions, she seemed to be nonexistent to the emperor. Her heart began to feel uneasy.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>His recent coldness, is it related to this?</i></p>
<p><i>No!</i></p>
<p>Lu Wushuang’s eyes were gloomy. She would not let anyone take the emperor’s favor from her! Mo Rongzhan was only skeptical now, and Lu Wushuang was determined to keep it that way.</p>
<p><i>He will never know the truth! </i></p>
<p><i>If he really despised her, he would have punished her already.</i></p>
<p><i>But he didn’t!</i></p>
<p>In a desperate attempt to console herself, she felt a bud of hope inside her.</p>
<p>As for Lu Yaoyao, she vowed not to let her have another chance to get close to Mo Rongzhan. To do this, she could only think of one person who could help her.</p>
<p>“In a few days, please invite my mother, the eldest madam, into my palace.” She ordered.</p>
