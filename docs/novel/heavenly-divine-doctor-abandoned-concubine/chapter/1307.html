<p>“Who the hell are you?” Teacher Shan asked fiercely, “Do you think that looking like the late wang fei gives you the reason to imitate her? Presumptuous!”</p>
<p><i>Is this a coincidence?</i> <i>Her mind was nowhere near peace. </i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen just stared at her dumbfounded, but her hands were tightly fisted under the table, turning her knuckles white.</p>
<p>It was already too coincidental that the nickname and appearance were the same. Now she’d even written the same words.</p>
<p>But upon closer inspection, she discovered there was an obvious contrast in their handwriting. No, it’s not the same. Ye Zhen’s handwriting was far less crooked than those of Lu Yaoyao. Her handwriting was not ugly at all, while Lu Yaoyao’s was no better than that of a child!</p>
<p><i>If she isn’t related to the deceased wang fei then why does Master care about this girl?</i></p>
<p>Teacher Shan became more and more suspicious, but no matter how many questions she had, she had no way to get an answer. Her master seemed to have fled the moment she had accepted this offer. She couldn’t find him even if she searched the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>Feigning ignorance, Ye Zhen looked at Teacher Shan with incredulity. “Teacher, I don’t understand what you are saying. Who do I look like?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen would have liked to tell Teacher Shan that she was indeed her former student, but she could not say so yet.</p>
<p>“You can’t write well if you don’t hold the pen in the right position. You need to practice more.” Teacher Shan stiffly changed the subject. She didn’t want Lu Yaoyao to know too much about Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen too wouldn’t break the pot at this time, so she proceeded to practice her writing, acting like Teacher Shan’s outburst didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan stood beside her and looked down at Ye Zhen’s beautiful face that was as calm as the ripples of water. No one could predict what she was thinking. Maybe that was one attribute of hers that made her different from Ye Zhen. The Ye Zhen she knew wore her emotions on her sleeve. Her grief, her happiness, every emotion she had was palpable in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Pardon my intrusion, but Third miss, your eldest brother has come to see you.” A maid’s apologetic voice came from outside the door of her study.</p>
<p>Her heart began to ram painfully against her chest. At last, she was to face her deepest fear.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi had come to meet her. She thought that she’d be given some time before she would finally meet him.</p>
<p>Fear in her gut, yet she knew this fear wouldn’t bring Lu Lingzhi to his perils. She was Lu Yaoyao now. If Lu Lingzhi would see Ye Zhen in her, then it was not a thing to be worried about, not her worry at least. Let him be haunted by her appearance, let him ponder his vicious deeds!</p>
<p>Besides, this moment was inevitable. She shouldn’t think about how to avoid Lu Lingzhi. Instead, she should let him believe that she truly was Lu Yaoyao, the third miss of his family. Otherwise, how would she take revenge? Their favor and trust towards her would help her achieve her revenge, hold power, and lead them to their demise.</p>
<p>“You should take your leave,” Teacher Shan said flatly and picked up Ye Zhen’s paper and looked at it carefully.</p>
<p>“Of course, Teacher. If you’ll excuse me.” Ye Zhen bowed, washed her hands, and proceeded to the main hall. She hadn’t seen Lu Lingzhi in family gatherings since her arrival and this would be the first time she would be seeing him as Lu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>When she arrived at the hall, Ye Zhen saw a man in blue robes standing by one of the windows, his back facing her. The memory of his betrayal rushed to her, she had the strong urge to push him through the window. Yet, she couldn’t do that. Else, she would have to live the rest of her life in exile, or on the streets bleeding to death as a just punishment for murdering the assistant minister of war.</p>
<p>So, mustering all her strength, she suppressed her wrath, wore a calm demeanor, and approached Lu Lingzhi quietly.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother…” She called with an appropriate strain and shyness of her voice that would not make anyone deem her as strange.</p>
<p>When Lu Lingzhi turned around and saw the girl standing behind him, he was completely stunned. His jaw dropped as he purposely blinked to make sure his mind wasn’t playing tricks on him.</p>
<p><i>But, it can’t be!</i> Lu Lingzhi exclaimed in his mind.</p>
<p>The girl in front of him was thinner and darker, her eyebrows lacked Ye Zhen’s aristocratic shape. Nonetheless, the resemblance between them was uncanny.</p>
<p>Seeing Lu Lingzhi’s face, Ye Zhen knew that he must have shocked himself, giving her just a bit of satisfaction. “Eldest Brother? Are you my cousin?”</p>
<p>He snapped out of his trance and realized how impossible it was for Ye Zhen to have survived. She drank the poison and her body burned by the flame. This was the daughter of his third uncle.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi smiled at Ye Zhen. “I heard Third Sister wants to go to the Academy for Women?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandmother said that women who go to the academy have a good future,” said Ye Zhen with a silly smile. “Eldest Brother, I know I don’t know anything. And I’m afraid that I will be the laughing stock of the family in the future if I stay lacking in academic background.”</p>
<p>The girl’s expectant and hopeful eyes were quivering as she looked at him. Lu Lingzhi was moved for a moment by Ye Zhen’s sincere words, but he still whispered. “What if Eldest Brother does not let you go to the academy?”</p>
<p>The urge to kill the man in front of her became heavier to contain. But Ye Zhen remembered her mission and she spoke in a delicate, grieving voice. “Why? Did Yaoyao do something wrong?”</p>
