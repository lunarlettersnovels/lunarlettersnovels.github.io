            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 122 – Game Of Trickery And Deceit (1)</h3>
<p>There was none who could escape the enchantment, their eyes fixed on the pliant petite woman dancing vibrantly at the center. Her movements, precise and gentle; the sway of her hips tantalizing. No one dared to even blink, afraid they would miss.</p>
<p>Susceptible to this enchantment, Mo Rongzhan was also fetched by the girl who was spinning lightly on her toes.</p>
<p>He watched her with inexplicable burning in his chest. His mind occupied with her image as scenes from the hot springs pool that suddenly came rushed in. The girl’s jade-like skin glinted under the moonlight, as he remembered, his eyes turned darker and darker.</p>
<p>Beside him, Lu Lingzhi was horrified. He steadied his heart beating in chaos and looked back at the emperor once more. He was also a man, so he knew right away what the depth in Mo Rongzhan’s eyes reflecting an endless abyss of interest meant at this time. He felt an inexplicable panic.</p>
<p>He had been a fool, he sneered to himself. When he still had time, he should have found ways to stop Ye Zhen from taking the examination! He would rather have her confined in the mansion, away from the emperor’s eyes, and later on, find her a satisfactory marriage.</p>
<p>“Excellent!” A loud shout interrupted Lu Lingzhi’s anxiety.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi had already forgotten that his emperor brother was also here, and immediately clapped and shouted as soon as he saw Ye Zhen climbing down the drum.</p>
<p>It was only then that all the people discovered the arrival of the distinguished guests. Women could be seen reddening at the sight of Mo Rongzhan, Tang Zhen, and Lu Lingzhi, while men seemed to have straightened their backs.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan did not want anyone to know he was coming, so he quietly turned around and left. Lu Lingzhi, upon seeing him leave, hurried to follow him.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao should be able to get her third A this time, right?” Mo Rongyi asked the marquis, beaming from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen glanced quietly at Mo Rongzhan’s departing figure, then smiled softly in the direction of the little prince. “In this marquis’ opinion, she must certainly get an A for that.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi bobbed his head up and down with satisfaction. “For sure, Miss Lu will gain her third A and be admitted to the academy!”</p>
<p>Her fists clenched and brows furrowed, Princess Liu Hua cried unashamedly. “How can this count? It is clearly a drum dance; how can it be regarded as an instrument! This should not be counted!”</p>
<p>“Is it up to you to decide?” Tang Zhen could not hold his annoyance anymore.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen also heard the words of Princess Liu Hua but she just looked back and said nothing. With her eyes on the examiner, she was anticipating her grade.</p>
<p>“Drums really should not be regarded as an instrument, Lu Yaoyao, do you know any other instruments?” one of the female teachers in blue asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Ye Zhen pursed her lips. “Teacher, why cannot drums be used as musical instruments?”</p>
<p>The examiner glanced at her with morose. “Drums are naturally musical instruments, but what you are performing today is dance inspiration, not really an instrument examination.”</p>
<p>“There is a wide range of instruments women can choose from. I personally picked the drum because it is rarely used,” Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>“Still, it is not the orthodox method,” the female teacher said flatly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took a measuring look at the female teacher. She had never seen the teacher before. Seeing that she frequently glanced at Princess Liu Hua, she immediately understood why she was making things difficult for herself.</p>
<p>Orthodox or unorthodox, her fate was already decided even before she started performing.</p>
<p>Not liking where this is going, Mo Rongyi pointed to the female teacher and asked, “You said her method was wrong, then you should come and play the drum yourself and tell this prince what is right!”</p>
<p>The female teacher turned red when asked directly by the little prince. She was not good at drumming and Mo Rongyi’s words were clearly intended to embarrass her.</p>
<p>Right then, Princess Liu Hua came to the teacher’s rescue and answered Mo Rongyi. “Teacher Bu is excellent at playing the guqin. Is not it too harsh for the prince to push her to play such a ‘barbaric’ instrument?”</p>
<p>“Well, it is too difficult for her then!” Mo Rongyi raised his eyebrow. “Besides, Miss Lu’s performance is far from barbaric!”</p>
<p>“Yi, are you just trying to win the bet? You do not have to stand up for Lu Yaoyao. Her drumming was just unacceptable!” She was winning, she could feel it.</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen heard the bet, she quickly turned her eyes towards Mo Rongyi. “Your Highness, did you bet that I will pass?”</p>
<p>“For saving my life, of course, I want you to pass! But if you do not, you will give me back 1,200 taels of silver!” Mo Rongyi said unhappily, his lips puckering, and chubby arms folded in front of his chest.</p>
<p>“1,200 taels?” Ye Zhen was stunned, the amount of money was no joke!</p>
<p>“If I pass, how much money can you have then?” Ye Zhen asked.</p>
<p>Princess Liu Hua chuckled. “Of course, it’s ten to one. If he wins, he will receive 12,000 taels of silver. Lu Yaoyao, why do you ask? Do you really think you can get into the academy?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled without fury which left people wondering how she could be this calm in such a heated situation.</p>
<p>“Of course, I can get in, but don’t you think that it’s a little frugal of you to pay only 12,000 taels of silver?”</p>
<p>“Well, if you manage to enter the academy, this princess will return twenty times the money to the winners!”</p>
