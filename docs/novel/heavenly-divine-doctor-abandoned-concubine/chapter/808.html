            <p><strong>Chapter 523 – You Are From the Ye Family</strong></p>
<p>Her eldest cousin had always been shrewd, just one look and he immediately suspected that she was not Lu Shiming’s blood.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned at him. “Who exactly are you? Why are you asking me such things?”</p>
<p>“Answer me, are you Lu Shiming’s real daughter or not?” Ye Chunming asked in a stern voice, glaring at Ye Zhen as he took another step closer.</p>
<p>“What if I am, what if I am not? What does this have to do with you?” Ye Zhen retorted coldly. She wanted to know more than anything else why Ye Chunming was still alive, if he wasn’t dead, what about the other family members? Did he know the whereabouts of her father and brother?</p>
<p>At first, Ye Chunming was still a bit uncertain, but the more he looked at this little girl, the more she resembled his little sister — whether it was the shape of her eyebrows, eyes, or other facial features, they were a spitting image of Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>If Ye Zhen was dead, then Lu Yaoyao could only be the girl from the Ye family who had died in infancy, as his father had once mentioned. Because that girl died very young, almost no one knew that Ye Zhen had a younger sister, only, he did not expect her to become a member of the Lu family.</p>
<p>“You don’t know about your birth, but I do. Because you look like my little sister, I am sure that you and Ye Zhen are twins. And you didn’t die prematurely back then, however, you disappeared,” Ye Chunming said sharply, he glanced back, not wanting anyone to know that he recognized Lu Yoyao.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him and quirked her eyebrows. “You’re from the Ye family, hasn’t the Ye family been decimated? How come you are still alive?”</p>
<p>“I’ll talk to you about this later.” Ye Chunming said in a low voice, “This is not the place to talk, I’ll find you later.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was going to ask more questions, but Ye Chunming had already left with his head down.</p>
<p>Eldest Brother actually didn’t die! This fat brought her not an iota of joy! After all, Ye Chunming was trained by her eldest uncle, she knew better than anyone what kind of person he was, and most importantly, he had not mentioned a word about her father just then.</p>
<p>If he wants to gain my trust, if he knows the whereabouts of Father, he would definitely not conceal it. As such, this can only prove that Father and Second Brother are not on this island. Then where exactly were they?</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had expected to meet the people she yearned to see on Zhao Jia Island, but instead, she had met Ye Chunming. She had a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, why are you standing there in a daze?” Huangfu Chen walked over and asked softly as he approached Ye Zhen who was standing motionless in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen returned to her senses and looked up at Huangfu Chen who always carried himself with grace. She smiled faintly. “Master, Ye Shi came looking for me just now.”</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen’s expression turned solemn. “Who is he?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t sound like Ye Yisong, but more like a young man.” Ye Zhen did not directly say that he was Ye Chunming. She had Lu Yaoyao’s identity now and was supposed not to have seen Ye Chunming in her life.</p>
<p>“Did he hurt you?” Huangfu Chen asked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head lightly and looked at the torn sleeve. When Ye Chunming saw what she looked like, he had already quickly hidden the shadow. He didn’t really hurt her. “No, I’m alright. I’m just wondering if he’s from the Ye family… How could he possess Ye Yisong’s Cang Ying?”</p>
<p>“We’ll find out about this.” Huangfu Chen comforted her softly.</p>
<p>“Master, I want to ask Zhao Tianji what he knows about Ye Shi,” Ye Zhen whispered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay.” Huangfu Chen nodded.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen returned to the house and changed her clothes. Just as she was about to go out, she saw that there were two other women in the courtyard. One of them was Mu Xue, who had been injured by her not long ago. The other, who was about two years older, looked delicate and pretty. Her entire person exuded gentleness. She grabbed Mu Xue, who seemed reluctant, with one hand and whispered something.</p>
<p>This woman must be Mu Qing! Ye Zhen walked out of the room and carefully examined Mu Qing. It turned out that she was Huangfu Chen’s beloved. As expected, she was very compatible with her master.</p>
<p>“Sister, I said it had nothing to do with me…” Mu Xue called out unwillingly. Had she known earlier, she wouldn’t have told her sister that Ye Shi was looking for Lu Yaoyao. She(MQ) actually wanted to find her and apologize.</p>
<p>Mu Qing lectured her in a low voice, “If you weren’t lying to Ye Shi, would he have been deceived by you?”</p>
<p>“Sister!” Mu Xue stomped her foot and turned her head only to see Ye Zhen. When she saw that her body was as intact as before, without any injuries, her face immediately sank. “B*tch, give me back my Cang Ying!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at her with a ghost of a smile. “Who is the b*tch scolding?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I’m scolding you.” Mu Xue shouted. She only realized belatedly that something was not right. After thinking about it carefully, her face turned red from anger.</p>
<p>“Oh, I can tell you like to scold yourself,” Ye Zhen smiled and taunted.</p>
<p>“You…!” Mu Xue was furious, itching to rush up and kill Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Mu Qing had been secretly sizing up Ye Zhen. When she saw this little girl for the first time, she was completely stunned. Although she had heard her younger brother say that his apprentice was a very beautiful little girl, she did not expect Lu Yaoyao to look at her like this. This was the most beautiful woman she had ever seen. She was truly a beauty that could topple cities and countries.</p>
<p>Huangfu Chen probably didn’t remember what she looked like with such a beauty by his side now, did he?</p>
<p>“Mu Xue, don’t be rude. Miss Lu is a guest of our Zhao Jia Island,” Mu Qing quietly rebuked.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled at Mu Qing. “Sister Mu, are you looking for me?”</p>
<p>“My sister is the eldest madam of Zhao Jia Island, who the hell are you calling sister?” Mu Xue shouted.</p>
<p>“Ah Xue!” Mu Qing shouted at her.</p>
<p>Mu Xue pouted and unwillingly stood behind Mu Qing.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, I’m sorry. Ah Xue has been spoiled by me.” Mu Qing looked apologetically at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled faintly. “It’s fine. I won’t argue with a little girl.”</p>
<p>Mu Xue rolled her eyes at Ye Zhen. I am a little girl? Like I am Lu Yaoyao, harumph.</p>
<p>Mu Qing smiled and looked at Ye Zhen hesitantly. “Miss Lu, did someone come looking for you just now?”</p>
<p>“Is Sister Mu talking about a man wearing a mask?” Ye Zhen asked.</p>
<p>“He came to find you? Did he hurt you?” Mu Qing hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>It seemed that Ye Shi had come to look for her because of Mu Xue. If she didn’t look like Ye Zhen, Ye Shi would definitely not let her off. “He stole the Cang Ying and said a bunch of strange words. He didn’t hurt me.”</p>
<p>Mu Qing sighed with relief. Thank goodness that no one had gotten hurt! “My apologies, Miss Lu. Ah Xue is a bit spoiled. She likes Cang Ying too much for her to let it go so easily – that’s why she went to look for Ye Shi.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled. “Sister Mu, I already said I won’t argue with her. I heard you wanted to see me?”</p>
<p>“I guess so…” Mu Qing looked a little embarrassed. She glanced at the tightly shut door behind Ye Zhen. “I’ll have someone come back tomorrow for Miss Lu, then.”</p>
<p>It seemed like she didn’t want anyone to see her here.</p>
