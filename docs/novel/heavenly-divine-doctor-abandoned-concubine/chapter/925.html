            <p><strong>Chapter 404 – In Danger (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Brother Tang, Yaoyao, what are you guys talking about?” Mo Rongyi suddenly rode over his horse, cutting Tang Zhen off.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t really care about Tang Zhen’s answer. In her eyes, he probably wouldn’t be willing to let go of everything for her. He was the only one left of the Tang Family. He needed to preserve their legacy.</p>
<p>“We were talking about who would be able to catch more prey in a while,” Ye Zhen answered Mo Rongyi with a smile. “Haven’t you practiced your archery skills for a few days already? Be sure to do well later.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi blushed and said, “I have practiced… but it’s different. I didn’t hunt often back then.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled, turning to speak to Tang Zhen. “Brother Tang, why don’t you teach him. Otherwise, he might come back empty-handed.”</p>
<p>“Are you looking down on me?” Mo Rongyi said in embarrassment, “Just wait and see. I’ll definitely get more than you!”</p>
<p>“All right, I’ll wait and see.” Ye Zhen smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen saw that he couldn’t continue his conversation with Ye Zhen, and set aside all of his thoughts, meticulously teaching Mo Rongyi and the others to hunt. Such was a skill that was started by the teacher but made by the student. He could only teach them a couple of tricks. After all, these children practiced archery daily, they just didn’t go hunting that often.</p>
<p>“The animals in the hunting grounds are all rather gentle and young. There are no beasts, so no ones needs to worry. Just concentrate and focus on your target,” Tang Zhen told them with a smile.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi was fidgety, wanting to go try immediately. This was still his first time hunting. The last time he had snuck out to try, he had fallen into a hunter’s trap because he had no experience.</p>
<p>“Let’s split into two groups to compete, all right?” Tang Zhen smiled and suggested.</p>
<p>“What happens if we win, and what happens if we lose?” Ye Zhen asked. With so many people hunting, a competition was the only way to have fun.</p>
<p>A child at Mo Rongyi’s side shouted, “The losers will treat everyone to a meal at Fengyue Tower.“</p>
<p><em>Fengyue Tower?</em> Ye Zhen quirked her brow. This was a dining tower famed throughout the capital for being the most extravagant and luxurious. Not only did it have dishes and wine famous nationwide, but there were also the most beautiful courtesans. However, the courtesans of Fengyue Tower only sold their talents, not their bodies. Ye Zhen had once gone there with Ye Yiqing.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen was about to disagree, thinking Ye Zhen wouldn’t want to go someplace like this.</p>
<p>“All right.” Ye Zhen generously answered.</p>
<p><em>Revisiting a place of her past. Nothing bad.</em></p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan felt a constant sense of unease today. It had been a long time since he had felt like so. The last time he’d been this uneasy had been the time Ye Zhen had burned down the Duke Qin’s Estate. He didn’t know what would happen today.</p>
<p>“Fude, is there something happening in the palace today?” Mo Rongzhan put down his court documents, turning to ask his trusted aide.</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, what type of happenings are you referring to?” Eunuch Fu didn’t quite understand what Mo Rongzhan meant. <em>What could be happening today? The Imperial Consort has just been dismissed. The other concubines are both scared and excited, probably all planning and preparing to be near the emperor.</em></p>
<p>Apart from this, he didn’t think anything else would be happening in the palace. However, he didn’t think that the emperor would care about what the concubines were doing.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan slightly furrowed his brows, seeming a little dissatisfied with Fude’s answer.</p>
<p>Noticing his liege’s expression, a lightbulb suddenly went off in Eunuch Fu’s head. “Little Prince has gone hunting today with the princess.”</p>
<p>“When did they leave?” Mo Rongzhan remembered that A’Yi had said he was going to the hunting grounds yesterday. <em>Did his unease have something to do with this?</em></p>
<p>“They left while you were in the morning session with the court,” Eunuch Fu said. He had guessed correctly. The emperor would be extremely concerned with anything concerning the princess.</p>
<p>There were people overseeing the hunting grounds, and there were no dangerous beasts within. He wasn’t particularly worried about their safety… “Did they bring guards?”</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu looked at Mo Rongzhan, quietly saying, “Little Princes brought twelve palace guards. Don’t worry, Your Imperial Majesty, Little Prince and the princess will not encounter any sort of danger. Marquis Jing Ning is also at the hunting grounds.”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan’s expression immediately soured. “Tang Zhen went to the hunting grounds as well?”</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, Marquis Jing Ning seems to have taken a leave of absence. He went to the hunting grounds immediately after the court’s morning session.” Eunuch Fu lowered his head as he answered.</p>
<p>“Get someone to ready my horse!” Mo Rongzhan said immediately, already calling the maids outside to help him change.</p>
<p>If he had known that Tang Zhen would go to the hunting grounds as well today, he definitely would have gone with him. <em>What a guy, Tang Zhen! To dare go and see Yaoyao in secret!</em></p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan thought back to the time the marquis had told him he wanted to have Yaoyao’s hand in marriage, and suddenly understood why he had felt so uneasy today.</p>
