            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 5 – Her Return (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Mother and Father have just come back! They are unable to cope with the guests coming to see you these past few days. So after the guests leave, they will come to see you, so do not worry!” Lu Xiangzhi assured her as he thought his sister had wept quietly because her parents weren’t present when she woke up.</p>
<p>His sister’s mind was the most sensitive. Although she was usually lively and optimistic, she always had a condition with her heart. It had started not too long ago when she found out she was not his biological sister.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen said with a smile, “I know that they must have a lot of things to do upon returning to the capital after such a long time.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi patted his sister’s head and felt that she was really sensible today. “When you are well and energized, Elder Brother will take you out to have fun. We will look around the capital, it’s quite different from our boring border town. It’s more fun here and the foods are heavenly; the capital is far more prosperous than towns out of nowhere, I tell you!”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Ye Zhen still smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Deep in her heart, she wanted to tell him that his beloved sister Lu Yaoyao was already dead. And that she was more familiar with the capital than anyone else in this household.</p>
<p>“Well, nowadays the news of the newly ascended emperor is everywhere. With the city too busy, I’m afraid you will not be allowed outside for now.” Lu Xiangzhi sighed defeatedly.</p>
<p>It looked like they would be stuck at home for the meantime.</p>
<p>The corners of Ye Zhen’s mouth twitched, her smile froze. Hiding her surprise, she asked in a calm tone, “A new emperor has begun to reign? What new emperor?”</p>
<p><i>Didn’t Mo Rongzhan take the throne two years ago?</i></p>
<p>She remembered that she had been dead for two years.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>Did someone usurp the throne after my death?</i></p>
<p>“Yes, the prince of this Qin dynasty ascended the throne a few days ago. Also, for some reason, three days ago his wang fei and all her confidants were burned to death. Today, Shuang’er will be appointed Imperial Concubine. The whole family is in high spirits…”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi rambled on but Ye Zhen could no longer hear a word.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was the emperor and she was his deceased wang fei! There was no way that Lu Xiangzhi was speaking about other people.</p>
<p><i>He had just ascended the throne, and shortly after I was killed… How could this happen? How could I return to two years ago, when I was trapped in the palace for two agonizing years!?</i></p>
<p>“Wang Fei… is that the young lady from the Ye Family?” Ye Zhen asked numbly, her trembling hands forming into fists, hidden underneath the quilt.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi nodded and missed how Yaoyao was able to know that the wang fei’s surname was Ye.</p>
<p>“The Ye Family was beheaded at the gate two days ago. You didn’t see how the meridian gate was still covered with blood. Although it rained for a long time, it still wasn’t able to wash off the blood. I took one look and immediately hurried back; I couldn’t sleep all night!”</p>
<p><i>The entire Ye Family was beheaded. Including her loved ones… her family.</i></p>
<p>How could she forget that when Mo Rongzhan ascended the throne, he had already begun to annihilate the people who had opposed him before? The Ye Family was just one of them.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen gritted her teeth and felt a stabbing pain in her heart once again when she remembered the poisoned wine she was given. Her resentment towards Lu Lingzhi’s betrayal for the sake of his sister, Lu Wushuang, and the Lu Family would never dwindle. Not to mention Mo Rongzhan’s apathy at her demise… the injustice done to Ye Family would never be forgotten!</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, repressed her hate, and unhurriedly looked at everything before her. She forced herself to calm down in a bid to restrain from questionable behavior in front of Lu Xiangzhi.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan killed the entire Ye Clan including those who were innocent.</p>
<p><i>What about her father?</i></p>
<p>Her father was just a nobleman who had never harmed anyone and had even secretly helped him in the past few years.</p>
<p><i>Yet, he had still ordered for the entire family to be executed?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen silenced the hatred reflecting in her eyes and quietly listened to the young man talking excitedly beside her. Suddenly, she felt pain in the palm of her right hand. She brought it before her face in order to see it clearly. Out of nowhere, a flash of flame appeared in front of her eyes. Her palm felt a strange burning sensation and her hand felt like it wasn’t her own.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen let out a surprised cry and fainted once again.</p>
