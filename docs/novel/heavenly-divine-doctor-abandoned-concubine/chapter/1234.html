<p>Ye Zhen didn’t expect that the emperor would give her so many things. Aside from the palace’s brocade, he had given her one hundred and twenty gold taels that made her a little dizzy.</p>
<p>This was what Mo Rongyi referred to when he promised her rewards. She didn’t want it because she wanted to take advantage of this kindness to get more benefits such as having a greater chance of entering the palace. Yet, Mo Rongzhan brought a hundred and twenty pieces of gold taels to cut ties with her.</p>
<p><i>Did he see through her plan?</i></p>
<p>“Mother said that since these were given to you by the emperor, you should put them away properly. Both Elder Brother and Mother have thanked you,” Lu Xiangzhi said to Ye Zhen with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded, thinking of where to put away the hundred and twenty taels of gold. “I will.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t say anything in front of the emperor, did you?” Lu Xiangzhi asked her. Ye Zhen’s face instantly fell into a sullen look.</p>
<p>“In your opinion, am I just a wild girl who only causes trouble?” Ye Zhen’s eyes stared back hurt.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi laughed, trying to ease up things. “No, isn’t this the first time you meet the emperor? Of course, you must have been nervous! Eldest Brother was also concerned about how you talked to him.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen snorted. “If the emperor asks, I will answer. What else will I say?”</p>
<p>The first time she saw the emperor, she was really nervous. However, she had actually spent two years with Mo Rongzhan as a spirit. She didn’t feel strange with him anymore. They just spoke to each other for the first time… It was just a bit sour.</p>
<p>At first, she felt that she had many things to ask him, but she couldn’t.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi said, “What did the emperor ask you?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s heart sneered. It must have been Lu Lingzhi who had asked her brother to ask her about this. She was too aware of what Lu Lingzhi was afraid of.</p>
<p><i>Ah! He is terrified that Mo Rongzhan would notice her resemblance to her old self.</i></p>
<p>“He didn’t ask anything, just that if I knew a girl named Yaoyao.” Ye Zhen said doubtfully, “Do you think someone has the same name as me?”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi’s eyes widened in surprise. “The emperor also asked you of that? Last time he asked me your name and where we lived before we came to the capital.”</p>
<p>Mirroring the reaction, Ye Zhen was also stunned to hear that Mo Rongzhan had already suspected her. <i>But did he not remember that she once said her nickname?</i> <i>How had it come to his mind just recently?</i></p>
<p><i>Is it because hearing someone call her by this name touched his memory and reminded him of eight years ago?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen laughed inwardly. Things were happening just the way she wanted.</p>
<p>Things that had never happened during her two years of being an invincible phantom in the palace were happening now after she had transmigrated in her twin sister’s body.</p>
