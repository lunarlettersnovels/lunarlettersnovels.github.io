            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 190 – Ye Yisong</strong></p>
<p>Mo Rongyi smiled and said, “Actually, I have no memory of it. I heard that I was only two years old at that time. Someone poisoned me. Qi Jin was just in time and managed to save me. However, the person who poisoned me has already died.”</p>
<p>“Who.. wants to harm you?” Ye Zhen faintly felt that she knew the answer, but she dared not to dwell on that thought.</p>
<p>“Ye Yisong.” Mo Rongyi’s gaze revealed disgust. “That treacherous minister killed too many people. He killed several princes in the palace who were favored by the emperor. I was very lucky. Qi Jin was just in time to save my life. However, sometimes I still suffer from angina pectoris<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1">[mfn]Angina pectoris: a condition marked by severe pain in the chest, often also spreading to the shoulders, arms, and neck, owing to an inadequate blood supply to the heart[/mfn]</sup>.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen stared at Mo Rongyi blankly. She had already a hunch that the person who wanted to hurt him was related to the Ye Family. And he said it himself, which made her feel sorry.</p>
<p>Her uncle deserved to die. If she were Mo Rongzhan, the first thing she would do after ascending the throne was kill the great treacherous court official. Why not? That vicious man had not spared anyone. How many young and old had he sent to their early graves!</p>
<p>“Is it because you have been poisoned before that you have been suffering from this illness and unable to cure it?” Ye Zhen asked softly.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi frowned and said, “It should be so.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen sighed softly in her heart. “You will be better.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have confidence at all.” He shot her a supercilious look.</p>
<p>Contrary to what he was thinking, Ye Zhen felt very confident. She would use the spiritual springs from her palm to treat him. This was the Ye Family’s debt to Mo Rongyi. The child was innocent. As for Mo Rongzhan’s debt to her, it was a different matter altogether.</p>
<p>Moreover, she also wanted to do something in return for the empress dowager. If something were to happen to Mo Rongyi, the dowager would certainly be desolate.</p>
<p>At this time, a maid came in with medicine. It was the head maid of the palace who Ye Zhen had seen the last time.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi cried in disgust. “I hate taking medicine the most.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen found the little prince funny. “How can you recover without taking medicine?”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, you said that as long as Miss Lu came to visit you in the palace, you would take your medicine obediently,” the palace maid said.</p>
<p>Mo Rongyi glared at her. “Madam Nuan, you’re being crueler and crueler to this prince’s heart.”</p>
<p>Madam Nuan said with a smile, “This servant is only devoted to Little Prince’s wellness.”</p>
<p>“Close your eyes and drink it at once.” Ye Zhen took the medicine from Madam Nuan.</p>
<p>“Shall I ask the empress dowager to let me stay here for two days for you to take the medicine?”</p>
<p>“Really?” Mo Rongyi’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>He had very few friends and was extremely comfortable talking to Lu Yaoyao. Although there were other people in the palace who served him, they respected him but could not say much. But this girl was different, she brought with her a sense of calm. She was courteous but not subservient. He liked that about her.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen nodded. “You take the medicine, then I shall seek permission from the empress dowager.”</p>
<p>With Ye Zhen’s reassurance, a happy Mo Rongyi did not cause further trouble and readily took the medicine. Exhausted as he was, he immediately fell asleep.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes were brimming with gentleness as she gazed at the quietly slumbering prince. His palm-sized face looked wan and gray, robbed of its usual cheer and life. He looked so peaceful that if not for the sound of his breathing, one might think he was dead.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen collected herself and turned to the head palace maid.</p>
<p>“Madam Nuan, can I see the empress dowager?” she asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>“Aunt Cheng has just arrived and is waiting for Young Miss outside.” Madam Nuan replied, leading Ye Zhen out of the little prince’s bedchambers.</p>
<p>Even if she did not seek an audience with the empress dowager, it was the dowager herself who surprisingly sought her instead.</p>
<p>“Aunt Cheng.” Ye Zhen walked out of the chamber and saw Aunt Cheng standing outside.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, Empress Dowager sent this old servant to invite you to the Cining Palace,” Aunt Cheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen greeted Aunt Cheng and politely asked her to lead the way. “Aunt Cheng, please…”</p>
<p>In the Cining Palace, the empress dowager was leaning on the soft couch. Her weariness was hard to hide. These days, because of the little prince’s illness, she could not rest well. She was constantly on her toes tending to her little one. It was no surprise, this mother had lost her spirit.</p>
<p>Although she was aware of Ye Zhen’s arrival at the palace to visit her son, she did not make an attempt to visit his chamber. There was no animosity or negative feelings as such. Since her younger son liked this girl, she naturally had a reason to like her back. If this girl could make her son take medicine obediently, then what is there for her to worry about?</p>
<p>When Aunt Cheng brought Ye Zhen to the empress dowager’s chamber she saw her reclining with her eyes closed. As much as she knew how important this rare moment of rest was, she still had a duty to uphold. So, in a low voice, she called out ‘Her Highness’.</p>
<p>The empress dowager opened her eyes slightly and looked at the girl who was already kneeling in front of her. She smiled. “Yaoyao has come?”</p>
<p>When Ye Zhen saw how tired the empress dowager was, her eyes showed concern. “This official’s daughter pays respect to the empress dowager.”</p>
