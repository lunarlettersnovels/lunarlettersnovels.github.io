            <p><strong>Chapter 509 – A Beauty in the Palace</strong></p>
<p>There was a gorgeous beauty in the palace. She lived in the Palace of Earthly Tranquility where Lu Wushuang once lived. Although the emperor hadn’t given her a title, he would visit her once a day since she was brought back to the palace. In fact, one couldn’t perceive whether the emperor liked her, but… Since they were all brought into the palace, they eventually want to be concubines.</p>
<p>[*women brought into the palace eventually became concubines — is a general notion]</p>
<p>Eunuch Fu silently cursed in his heart, thinking that not long ago, the emperor had just entered the princess’s boudoir at night. But now, he had brought a beautiful woman. If the princess found out…</p>
<p>It was said that the emperor was heartless, but he found the emperor was too sentimental.</p>
<p>The empress dowager was also confused by Mo Rongzhan’s actions. When she found out that Ye Zhen had gone to Huaijiang, she became extremely worried. She prayed in the temple every day. Originally, she did not know that there was beauty in the palace. Aunt Cheng was afraid that she would get angry, so she had specifically instructed everybody to hold their tongues about the matter. It was only when she went to the imperial garden today that she heard the palace maids whispering.</p>
<p>The empress dowager immediately called Mo Rongzhan over.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, what do you mean? You said you want to make Yaoyao the Empress. Now that you have brought some beauty into the palace, will she marry you?” The empress dowager was also a woman, and she knew what kind of person the little girl was. She did not have any confidence or feelings for the emperor, so with such a thing happening again, she would probably be even more unwilling.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan frowned. “What does Ye Yaoyao have to do with me wanting to marry Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>“Everybody in the palace is saying that you like Ye Yaoyao. If you don’t like her, why did you bring her back to the palace and let her live in the Palace of Earthly Tranquility?” She snorted angrily.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, that is because…Ye Yaoyao was probably the one who saved me before. Now that she has lost her memory, and doesn’t know where she comes from, I brought her to the palace.” Mo Rongzhan helplessly explained why he was still going to establish a concubine. In the future, he would definitely not let other women give birth to children before Yaoyao.</p>
<p>The empress dowager was stunned. “What savior?”</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan had no choice but to tell her about the forest and also about Lu Wushuang impersonating Ye Yaoyao.”… Now she has forgotten everything. That day, I gave her the jade pendant, and she snatched it away as if she recognized it …I don’t want her to be used by others, so I brought her back to the palace. I don’t know if she’s the person who saved me before. Let the imperial physician treat her first.”</p>
<p>“Lu Shifeng and his daughter deserved to die! Why did they lock up such a pitiful girl for so many years? Even if Ye Yaoyao wasn’t the girl who saved you in the past, he shouldn’t have locked her up for so many years,” she said angrily.</p>
<p>“Imperial Mother, in the end, she is a young lady. In the future, I cannot go there often. I need you to keep an eye for me,” Mo Rongzhan said.</p>
<p>The empress dowager nodded, “Leave this matter to ajia, but her staying in the Palace of Earthly Tranquility will always cause misunderstandings. If you don’t want to make her your concubine in the future, you should not let her stay in there.”</p>
<p>If he hadn’t met Lu Yaoyao, he would probably have made Ye Yaoyao an imperial concubine. But now, he was a little hesitant. That’s right, Ye Yaoyao’s appearance was very stunning. Although she had a bit less spiritual energy than Lu Yaoyao, and she was a beauty that could bring down cities and countries, he didn’t have the urge to want her.</p>
<p>“If she really was the woman who saved me, I would naturally treat her well.” Mo Rongzhan whispered. “Once I confirm her identity, make her Princess.”</p>
<p>The empress dowager sighed in her heart. In the end, the emperor was a man. She had heard the palace maids describe Ye Yaoyao as a beauty that was not inferior to Yaoyao … Her son would be tempted again. She only hoped that Yaoyao would not be sad.</p>
<p>Because of Ye Yaoyao’s matter, Xu Huiru was also restless. When she had found out that Lu Yaoyao wasn’t in the capital, she had thought that her chance had come. But little did expect the emperor would bring a woman from outside the palace who wasn’t inferior to Lu Yaoyao. He even placed that woman in the Palace of Earthly Tranquility and visited her almost every day. In fact, back when Lu Yaoyao was in the palace, the emperor hadn’t been this concerned. She was overcome by an unprecedented fear. She felt that if this continued, she wouldn’t even have a bit of status.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, this servant just went to inquire about it. I don’t know what kind of background the person at Palace of Earthly Tranquility has, but it seems that only the emperor knows,” Qian Lan walked in from outside and whispered to Xu Huiru.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru frowned. “No one knows… Have you seen that woman?”</p>
<p>Qian Lan hesitated. “I just saw her outside Palace of Earthly Tranquility.”</p>
<p>“How does she compare to Lu Yaoyao?” Xu Huiru asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>“The emperor seems to value her very much. She’s wearing all the cloud and mist silk and satin that was used to pay tribute this year…” Qian Lan was a bit indignant. None of the other imperial concubines had such good silk. “Compared to the princess, she’s not inferior at all. Your Highness, this girl doesn’t seem to be from the capital. If she were, how come I haven’t heard of her before.”</p>
<p>Xu Huiru’s heart ached. “What the emperor likes, of course, is good in every way.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness …” Qian Lan looked at her distressedly.</p>
<p>“I think Lu Yaoyao still doesn’t know that the emperor has moved on*. If she knew, with her personality, she wouldn’t enter the palace no matter what.” Xu Huiru smiled. Even if she didn’t like Ye Yaoyao, she had to use this woman to get rid of Lu Yaoyao for good.</p>
<p>[*移情别恋- <em>yí qíng bié liàn</em> – change of affection, a shift of love (idiom); to change one’s feelings to another love; to fall in love with sb else]</p>
<p>Qian Lan smiled. “Your Highness, do you know where Lu Yaoyao went?”</p>
<p>“Big Brother has already met her. Have him pass the news to her.” Xu Huiru smiled faintly. This way, her big brother wouldn’t have to take risks to deal with her.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, this servant will quickly send the news out of the palace,” Qian Lan hurriedly said.</p>
<p>Xu Huiru nodded gently. “Go!”</p>
<p>In contrast to the reactions of various personages in the palace, Lu Lingzhi was probably the only one who was pleased with Mo Rongzhan’s actions. He was pleased as a punch to see the emperor turn his back on love and abandoned the idea of making Yaoyao the empress.</p>
<p>“Third Uncle, Yaoyao has gone to Huaijiang. I want to bring her back,” Lu Lingzhi came to Lu Shiming’s study and whispered his decision.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming was stunned for a moment. “But I’ve already sent someone to find her. Now, how can you go out in this condition?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Huangfu and Yaoyao are together. I’m going to look for Yaoyao and at the same time ask Mr. Huangfu to detoxify me. I think…he has already found a way to detoxify the poison.” Lu Lingzhi smiled.</p>
<p>“Then you must be extremely careful. If the poison is not purged, it will be troublesome,” Lu Shiming instructed him.</p>
<p>A glint flashed through Lu Lingzhi’s eyes. He would not let Yaoyao be snatched away by others after he got to Huaijiang.</p>
<p>She was his and he would cherish her this time.</p>
