            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 128 – Let Him Deliver Himself To Death!</h3>
<p>Lu Lingzhi came back very late. Ye Zhen was accompanying Old Madam for a stroll in the garden to aid digestion after a sumptuous meal when she saw him slip inside.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I’m back.” Lu Lingzhi held Old Madam Lu’s hand and looked back at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Where have you been? Is your foot all right?!”</p>
<p>She looked anxiously at Lu Lingzhi’s injured foot. Just now, he walked so unsteadily that she could not help but fuss over her adored grandson.</p>
<p>“Go to the gazebo over there and sit still!”</p>
<p>To ease up Old Madam’s worry, Lu Lingzhi laughed in indifference. “I did not walk a lot today. I accompanied the emperor to the hunting ground, just stayed at a corner to watch and did not go hunting.”</p>
<p>“Still, you should have come back earlier.” Old Madam Lu softly scolded. “Yaoyao got four A’s today so we had a little celebration. We were waiting for your return.”</p>
<p>Displaying an apologetic smile on his face, Lu Lingzhi glanced across Ye Zhen then his grandmother with certainty.</p>
<p>“I already know about this, and I saw Yaoyao dance on the drum at the academy today. She was splendid!”</p>
<p>“Really?” The old madam’s eyes lit up with utmost pride.</p>
<p>Hearing Lu Lingzhi say so, Ye Zhen forced a smile. “Grandmother, I’ll show you later.”</p>
<p>The madam immediately nodded with a smile, then asked Lu Lingzhi, “The princess is well aware of her power. You should look out for Yaoyao and make sure that she receives the letter from the academy… whatever it is called.”</p>
<p>“I will,” Lu Lingzhi said firmly.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen frowned, this indeed happens—women who performed excellently, sometimes, would not receive the letter for some unknown reason. Although the possibility was small, who knows what Princess Liu Hua has up her sleeves?</p>
<p>“This matter is being watched by the little prince. Therefore, the princess is afraid to play foul.”</p>
<p>“Little Prince?” Old Madam Lu had some doubts.<i> What does this matter have to do with the little prince?</i></p>
<p>“Yaoyao did save the little prince once, he probably feels grateful to our Yaoyao.” Lu Lingzhi smiled and reminded his grandmother of this incident. “Grandmother, you can rest assured that the two teachers who deliberately made things difficult for Yaoyao today have been expelled from the academy by the dean.”</p>
<p>Immediately, Ye Zhen’s eyes widened in surprise and she looked at Lu Lingzhi with uncanny disbelief.</p>
<p>“So soon?”</p>
<p>“They argued with the little prince. How could Mo Rongyi let them go?”</p>
<p><i>He is leaving out some details on purpose</i>, Ye Zhen thought. Little Prince must have certainly asked his emperor brother to give the expulsion orders of the two teachers.</p>
<p>Upon the mention of the surname ‘Mo’, Lu Lingzhi visibly looked agitated at himself. As much as possible, he did not want his sister to think too much about Mo Rongzhan and his family.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had slowly become fond of the little prince, Mo Rongyi. The young boy was really bloody! In less than a day, he had managed to punish the two teachers.</p>
<p>While the old madam listened, she soon felt tired and asked Chen Wei to accompany her inside the mansion. This, of course, left Lu Lingzhi and Ye Zhen sitting in the pavilion. The tension was imminent in the air.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was not interested in sitting there facing him so as soon as Old Madam excused herself and left the pavilion, she immediately stood up to follow her.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>Before she could take a step or two, Lu Lingzhi called her name and quickly stood opposite her. “I’ve heard from Third Uncle; do you really plan to live in the academy in the future?”</p>
<p>Thinking of Lu Xiangzhi’s warning, Ye Zhen reluctantly smiled. “Yes, it is more convenient to live inside the academy.”</p>
<p>He wanted to speak a few more words to persuade her in changing her plan but thinking of her temper, he swallowed the words back. “Take a maid with you.”</p>
<p>“No, I can take care of myself.” Ye Zhen assured him with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>“The rest of the students must also have maids, so you do not have to worry about being noticed by being… different.” His tone was a little hard.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled faintly and looked at him with her eyebrows raised. “Even if I do not have a maid, I am already very popular.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was shocked when he heard this and could only force out a chuckle. “That’s exactly what I said.”</p>
<p>“What brought Eldest Brother to the academy today?” She had just heard him say she saw her dancing, but she did not notice him at all.</p>
<p>“I just happened to pass by the academy and was attracted by the festive noise. ” Lu Lingzhi explained vaguely for he did not want to say that he was with Mo Rongzhan who went there looking for his little brother.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen suddenly remembered that when her soul was trapped in the palace, she had not seen Lu Lingzhi for a period of time. Thinking about this memory, she realized that it was about this time.</p>
<p>“Are you not the assistant war minister? Why don’t you look occupied these days? Now that the border is not peaceful, are there not rebellions everywhere?”</p>
<p>“Originally, the emperor wanted me to lead troops to suppress rebellion, but now I’m injured, and I cannot even go.” Lu Lingzhi’s eyes filled with disappointment.</p>
<p>In fact, he direly hoped to lead troops out to suppress those rebellious captaincies. Although he had been given a high position, he still needed to seal the Lu Family’s position in the emperor’s mind.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan was different from the former emperor. He was not a ruler who could be controlled by others. After following him for so many years, Lu Lingzhi learned very well how powerful the emperor was today.</p>
<p>From an unpopular Prince of Qin to a forbearing, composed, resolute and omnipotent emperor whom everyone could not help but follow and serve, he had usurped the throne with an iron fist. Lu Lingzhi was deeply devoted to him and especially condemned those who rebelled against the emperor.</p>
<p>When did he become guilty and defensive about Mo Rongzhan? It seemed that it had all started since he poisoned Ye Zhen on his own initiative…</p>
<p>“I have made a new medicine, which can make your foot heal faster,” said Ye Zhen with a bright face.</p>
<p>She now felt some regrets about not giving Lu Lingzhi the medicine added with the <i>lingquan</i>. If not for his injury, he must have long left for the border!</p>
<p>More importantly, he would perhaps be seriously injured when he goes to suppress the rebellious captaincy and would only be able to recover after recuperating at home for less than a year.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t want to change these things that should happen because of her rebirth—she didn’t want to watch Lu Lingzhi escape this disaster.</p>
<p>“How did you know that the eldest brother wants to go out with troops?” The confusion in his face was showing.</p>
<p>“Every brave man seeks to serve his country—and his family. If the eldest brother doesn’t have such a heart, how could the Lu Family of today come into being? How many people’s blood did you spill in the battle to give this family a strong foundation? Eldest Brother surely knows what I mean. That injury keeps you from your duties.”</p>
<p>The Lu Family was not a century-old family. With no foundation and connections, Lu Lingzhi needed more achievements to stabilize the family’s position. Ye Zhen pointed out with precision his plans.</p>
<p>“How do you know so much, Third Sister?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen snorted softly. “Do you still underestimate this third sister?”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant. Elder Brother is just surprised.”</p>
<p>Previously, he only thought Yaoyao was just a thoughtless wild girl, he didn’t expect her to have such knowledge.</p>
<p>“Do you want my medicine or not?” Ye Zhen asked.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi, who had seen the effects of her medicine, definitely could not refuse, “Thank you, Third Sister.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s lips slightly tilted. “I’ll have the maid deliver it to you later.”</p>
<p>Hurriedly letting his injury heal so he can lead troops to war and die on the battlefield was even an act of better revenge.</p>
<p><i>Let him deliver himself to death! </i></p>
