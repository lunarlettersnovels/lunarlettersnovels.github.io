            <p><strong>Chapter 428 – Why Should I Help You? (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Who? Ye Zhen?” She smiled. “Maybe we are the same person, Eldest Brother, you keep being so obsessed with Ye Zhen, did you perhaps do something to her?”</p>
<p>“Are you really her?” Lu Lingzhi’s eyes darkened, and he suddenly stretched out his hand to grab Ye Zhen’s. “Yaoyao, are you really her?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen tried to shake off his hand, “Let go of me!”</p>
<p>He tugged hard and hugged her tightly in his arms. “If you are her… if you are her… I will be good to you and won’t hurt you again.”</p>
<p>“Who wants you to be nice to me?! You let me go!” Ye Zhen slammed back his shoulder hard. It was annoying to be in the carriage with him as she couldn’t escape anywhere else. And now that she was being held by him, she felt even more disgusted.</p>
<p>“Zhen Zhen…,” Lu Lingzhi called out in a low voice, the look in his eyes made him seem somewhat disoriented as if he was in a trance. He was already regarding the person in front of him as the Qin Wangfei who he had been poisoned to death.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen punched and kicked. “Help, Marquis’s poison is acting!”</p>
<p>When the people outside heard Ye Zhen’s screams, they immediately stopped the carriage and some guards hurried in.</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother is going to kill me! Save me!” Ye Zhen shouted, letting people pull Lu Lingzhi away.</p>
<p>“Marquis!” The two guards quickly reached out and grabbed Lu Lingzhi’s arm. “Third Young Miss, we’ll pull the marquis out, you get out of the carriage first.”</p>
<p>With the help of two guards, Ye Zhen was finally able to escape Lu Lingzhi’s restraints. She raised her hand and slapped him hard. “Eldest brother, wake up, you can’t be controlled by the poison.”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi was so dumbfounded by the slap that he didn’t know where he was, he looked at her dazedly.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>When Old Madam Lu in the front carriage heard the noise, she immediately asked someone to stop the carriage and enquire. “What happened?”</p>
<p>“Old Madam, it’s the marquis. The poison in his body suddenly flared again and he wanted to kill the third young miss,” the little boy pulling the cart said after he turned around and took a look.</p>
<p>“Come, help me out of the carriage.” Shocked by the explanation given to her, Old Madam Lu hurriedly had the maid to help her out of the carriage.</p>
<p>At this time, Ye Zhen had already taken advantage of Lu Lingzhi’s dazed state to run out of the carriage. The moment she did, she saw Old Madam Lu, so she immediately choked up and cried, “Grandmother!”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu hugged her and asked anxiously, “Yaoyao, what happened? Where’s your eldest brother?”</p>
<p>“Eldest Brother initially was speaking nicely to me, but suddenly he grabbed my hand and said he was going to kill me.” Ye Zhen cried, “ Grandmother, I’m scared.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid! Grandmother is here.” Old Madam Lu comforted before she asked, “How is the marquis?”</p>
<p>The two guards supported Lu Lingzhi down from the carriage. He looked tired, yet – unnoticed by anyone else – when his gaze fell on Ye Zhen, a dark light flashed across his eyes.</p>
<p>“Lingzhi, are you alright?” Old Madam Lu asked hurriedly.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi nodded softly. “I am fine, Grandmother, but… I’ve frightened Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had her head bowed at this time, concealing it in Old Madam Lu’s arm. She didn’t even look at Lu Lingzhi. Naturally, in everyone’s eyes, she seemed to be frightened by him.</p>
<p>“Lingzhi, Grandmother thinks it’s better if you go home and rest for a bit. It’s enough that Yaoyao alone accompanies me to go to Huguo Temple,” Old Madam Lu said after much deliberation. After all, what could they do if the poison in his body acted up again while they were in Huguo Temple?</p>
<p>Seeing that Ye Zhen looked like she didn’t want to talk to him at all, Lu Lingzhi knew that he had really frightened her today. Furthermore, even if he wanted to explain clearly, it was likely that the other would not listen. As such, he could only say, “In that case, I’ll go home first, Grandmother.”</p>
<p>“All of you escort the marquis back carefully.” Old Madam Lu immediately instructed, still, her heart felt very uncomfortable. She didn’t know when they would be able to detoxify the lingering poison in his body, and seeing the way her eldest grandson was always being tortured by it, it was impossible for people who saw it to not be concerned.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, your eldest brother scared you today, but it won’t happen again,” he said softly to Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>However, the little girl simply hid behind Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao….” He called her name, wanting to come over and see her. But…</p>
<p>“Don’t come over!” Ye Zhen shouted as she clutched Old Madam Lu’s clothes with both hands.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the old matriarch was distressed. Whether it was Lingzhi or Yaoyao, both were her beloved grandchildren, how was it possible for her to not feel heartache? “Lingzhi, Yaoyao has not calmed down yet, so you better go home and rest first. When we get home, you can try to talk to her again.”</p>
<p>“All right.” Lu Lingzhi nodded his head gently before he got back into the carriage. Once inside, he sighed lowly as he wearily leaned against the wall. He couldn’t understand why he suddenly mistook his Yaoyao for Ye Zhen. He was further unable to figure out why he was so obsessed with Ye Zhen.</p>
<p><em>Ye Zhen… When on earth did her existence take root in his heart so deeply that he was unable to get rid of her even when he dearly wanted to erase it?</em></p>
<p><em>For the sake of the Lu Family and Shuang’er, he was sorry for Ye Zhen, but he didn’t know… He had thought what he felt was just a little pity for Ye Zhen, but now… it seemed to be more than that.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em></em></p>
