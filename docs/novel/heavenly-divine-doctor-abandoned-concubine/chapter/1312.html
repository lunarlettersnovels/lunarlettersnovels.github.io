            <h3>Chapter 15 – Love Of Beauty (1)</h3>
<p>The two Lu sisters looked at Ye Zhen at the same time; one with disdain and another a discreet, forced smile. It would bring honor to the Lu Family if a few members were to venture into the field of medicine. But with just a few compliments from Old Madam in her hands, could she really pass the exam and be a student of the prestigious Academy for Women?</p>
<p>Many women of noble families had tried multiple times but failed. Moreover, these women started studying and preparing themselves for the academy from an early age! Lu Yaoyao was already fifteen, too old to be admitted as a freshman in the academy.</p>
<p>Aside from that, it was the School of Medicine they were talking about. People said that it was the hardest field in the academy. One should be naturally talented and break bones in order to succeed!</p>
<p>Students of the academy must learn the Six Arts<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For one to survive in the School of Medicine, one naturally had to master its craft. Relying on her sister’s memory, Lu Yaoyao learned some useful medical skills from Pei Shi. But, Pei Shi was not a woman of high birth nor an alumna of the academy. Her ways were not sophisticated enough to earn a key to the academy.</p>
<p>Lu Yaoyao would be simply a hillbilly who could not get on the table! She had no self-knowledge at all, just wishful thinking about entering the Academy for Women.</p>
<p><i>Did she really think her Eldest Brother could now call the shots and she could get directly into the academy?</i></p>
<p>Lu Fang and Lu Jing shared the same feelings this time. However, Old Madam Lu did not think much about what her two other granddaughters felt. They had spent years pleasing Old Madam Lu. Giving Ye Zhen her education after a month of acquaintance was a hard slap on their faces. As much as they hated it, the fact remained that Ye Zhen had earned Old Madam’s favor in such a short time.</p>
<p>For her part, Old Madam Lu was just a businesswoman. When she saw a potential opportunity, she would grab it without thinking twice. After all, if Ye Zhen succeeded, she would bring great honor to the family, and some powerful personage might ask for her hand in marriage!</p>
<p>“Wait until your Eldest Brother comes back and I will have him support you!” Old Madam Lu declared.</p>
<p>A happy Ye Zhen responded with a grateful bow.</p>
<p>Seething in anger, Lu Jing wanted to reprimand Ye Zhen for being overconfident but could not overlook Old Madam Lu’s happiness. Thus, she decided to hold her tongue and wait for the perfect moment to strike.</p>
<p>She was only a miss of the family, daughter of a concubine at that, who had won Old Madam’s respect because of her achievements in the academy. Exasperating Old Madam with her theatrics and eventually, falling out of her favor would turn her years of hard work futile.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu also mentioned that in three days’ time there would be a Flower Appreciation Meet in the capital. Once a year, the event is held in the imperial family’s Baihua Garden, which was different from the imperial gardens located at the heart of the imperial palace. This place was near the Academy for Women, and imperial court ladies often held a banquet here to admire the flowers.</p>
<p>The Lu Family was not qualified to go to Baihua Garden before, but now everything was different.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu had decided to bring her three grand-daughters to the banquet to show those who despised the Lu Family that they, despite being a family of merchants, were also capable of raising sensible girls.</p>
<p>“Flower Appreciation Meet?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen seemed to be in a trance upon hearing the three words… Today was a replica of a past unforgotten.</p>
<p>She and Mo Rongzhan had met at a Flower Appreciation Meet when she was only seven years old. He was the blind, unpopular prince. She was the Di<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="2"><a>2</a></sup> daughter of Ye Family, a prominent family in the capital, loved by thousands of people.</p>
<p>“The nobles in the capital will be there and you, my dear, will attend with us,” Old Madam Lu said with a gleam in her eyes.</p>
<p>Hearing the excitement in the old madam’s voice, Ye Zhen’s eyes stooped low and the corners of her mouth became tight.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I’m afraid I’ll embarrass you when I go.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” Old Madam Lu rebuked. “We are the Lu Family and they are nowhere near us.”</p>
<p>Lu Jing laughed in her heart at Old Madam’s preference for Ye Zhen due to her eccentricity. <i>What’s the point of her preference for Ye Zhen who was tanned and thin?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen touched her face and said, “I do not look good.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu laughed, reckoning Ye Zhen’s words as foolishness, “Who said you were going to attend all tanned from the border town? Just a bit of tonic and you will be a great beauty! In fact, you already are a beauty, no doubt.”</p>
<p><i>This is a losing battle</i>, Ye Zhen thought. Old Madam Lu always had her ways to have all her wishes and desires be granted. If she wanted Ye Zhen to attend the Flower Appreciation Meet , then she would.</p>
<p>Putting on a compliant smile, Ye Zhen appreciated the old madam’s compliment. “If Grandmother says that I am a beauty, then I shall believe it. I will be glad to join Grandmother and Sisters at the meet.”</p>
