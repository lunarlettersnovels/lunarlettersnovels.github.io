<p>Half a month passed in a blur.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi’s foot injury had not yet completely healed, his recovery rate was much slower than Lu Xiangzhi’s.</p>
<p>However, because he had used Lu Xiangzhi’s medicine before, he had been able to walk in just half a month, although it came with discomfort.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao is going to take the academy entrance exam in two days. We should go back today!” Lu Lingzhi said that he had rested in the village for half a month. He should go back to the palace to see the emperor.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen had the same plan, but she didn’t plan to go with Lu Lingzhi. She thought he would stay here for at least another half a month.</p>
<p>But at the time of departure, an extra carriage was prepared, and she immediately understood that it was for Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p>“When we return, I am afraid that everyone would be stunned.” Teacher Shan looked at Ye Zhen and said.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen beamed from ear to ear. “Isn’t it surprising that Teacher Shan looks a few years younger now?”</p>
<p>A few days ago, she saw in a book of medicine that pearl powder and some medicinal ingredients could be used to make a cream. She applied it to her face every night before she went to bed.</p>
<p>If one practiced it for a long time, she surmised, their skin would become light and ruddy. She made several boxes according to the formula in the book, and finally added her <i>lingquan</i> to it, and sent a box to Teacher Shan, whose skin had become much ruddier now than before.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan couldn’t care more. She just used the cream to pay importance to her student’s recent work. She didn’t expect that it would have some visible effects on her.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ye Zhen was pleasantly surprised and pleased. When she returned, she could explain that her change was because of the hot springs and the cream she prepared. By then, people would not be suspicious.</p>
<p>Teacher Shan shook her head. “You have such little thoughts. In the future, people will be willing to come to you if you show such skills.”</p>
<p>“Yes. We should depart at once. I’ll send some of these to my mother and grandmother.” Ye Zhen enthusiastically proclaimed.</p>
<p>After two hours, they finally returned to the Lu Mansion.</p>
<p>The moment Ye Zhen came out of the carriage, the people around her were stunned. They didn’t recognize this beautiful and delicate woman like a lotus in water.</p>
<p>When she appeared, her beauty radiated like spring flowers, the people could not move their eyes away from her.</p>
<p>“Teacher, you should go and rest first. I’m going to pay my respects to my grandmother.”</p>
<p>Teacher Shan nodded.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi held Lu Xiangzhi’s hand and limped along. “Yaoyao, let’s go.”</p>
<p><i>Third Miss?!</i></p>
<p>The surrounding servants heard Lu Lingzhi’s voice and looked at Ye Zhen in surprise.</p>
<p><i>Is this… the dark and thin Third Miss Lu from before? Deceptive!</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen glanced at Lu Lingzhi and followed him silently to the room,</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu had already been waiting for them in the house. She had heard that her eldest grandson was injured. If Lu Shiming hadn’t stopped her, she would have gone to the village to see Lu Lingzhi herself!</p>
<p>The maid who was outside the house cried out happily. “Old Madam Lu, the third miss, Eldest and Fourth Lord have come back!”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, they’re finally back,” Lu Jing said with a smile.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu looked forward to finally see the return of her grandson.</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi helped Lu Lingzhi to come in from the outside. As soon as they saw Old Madam Lu, he wanted to kneel.</p>
<p>“Hold him, quick!” Old Madam Lu cried. “Why are you trying to kneel when your feet are hurt like this? Oh! My sweetheart! Why are you so thin?”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I’m not thin, I’m fat,” Lu Lingzhi said with a smile. “Besides, my injury is better than half. My fourth brother and third sister are taking care of me, and I will recover in a few days.”</p>
<p>Lu Xiangzhi said guiltily, “Grandmother, it’s all my fault. If Eldest Brother hadn’t saved me, he wouldn’t have been hurt.”</p>
<p>“Now that you are both fine, I can rest assured.” Old Madam Lu wiped away her tears and looked at her two grandsons again and again, holding them in her arms.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen went up to her with a smile and knelt in front of Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, Eldest Brother, and Fourth Brother know you miss them, and they have been good.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu looked quizzically at the little girl in front of her. <i>Is this…</i></p>
<p>“Yaoyao?”</p>
