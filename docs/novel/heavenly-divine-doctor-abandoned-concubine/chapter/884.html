            <p><strong>Chapter 445 – Calling the Shots</strong></p>
<p>Liu Shi thought the revocation of Lu Wushuang’s title was the result of Old Madam Lu’s favoritism and Lu Lingzhi’s lack of action. So in her heart, she resented Lu Shiming’s family to the bone. If it weren’t for Lu Yaoyao, her Shuang’er would not have been banished to become a Taoist nun.</p>
<p>Liu Shi pretended to be ill for a few days, but no one ever cared about her. Old Madam Lu still regarded her as nothing and even her son ignored her.</p>
<p><em>They are all bewitched by the third household!</em></p>
<p>“Madam, the second eldest miss and the fourth miss have come to see you.” The maid came in and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>Liu Shi said angrily, “I won’t meet them! Have they come to see me becoming a joke one by one? Just because Shuang’er is in trouble now, don’t think that she won’t be able to gain the emperor’s favor sooner or later.”</p>
<p>Lu Fang walked in with a smile. “Mother, of course we all know that the eldest sister will definitely regain her title of Gui Fei. We just wanted to greet you today.””</p>
<p>Liu Shi cast them a cold look and waved her hand to tell the maid to withdraw. “You came to greet me? That’s really rare.”</p>
<p>“Eldest Aunt, no one at home cares about you, but we still think about you,” Lu Jing said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Did something happen at home?” Although Liu<em> Shi</em> was not shrewd enough, seeing that these two little girls suddenly visited her meant that they definitely didn’t really care about her, but that something had happened. They really thought she wouldn’t be able to tell.</p>
<p>Lu Jing was a little embarrassed, bit her lip and remained silent.</p>
<p>“Mother, Fourth Younger Sister has been wronged. You must help her.” Lu Fang spoke for her.</p>
<p>Liu Shi raised her eyebrows but didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><em>A daughter of the second household needs to come to me crying of grievances? Why not go to the old madam but me?</em></p>
<p>Seeing that she was silent, Lu Fang said in a low voice, “Fourth Younger Sister has been in love with Marquis Jing Ning since long, and Yaoyao knows about this. Now, Third Aunt wants Grandmother to ask the empress dowager to bestow her marriage to him. She is stubbornly breaking up Forth Sister’s and Marquis Jing Ning’s path. Mother, you have to make a decision for Jing’er. ”</p>
<p>“Hmph, the third household relies on Old Madam’s favouritism, what else can’t they do?” Liu Shi snorted coldly and hated Lu Shiming’s family more and more. “You can talk to your eldest brother about this, but it’s useless to find the old madam.”</p>
<p>Lu Fang was a little timid.”Mother, we have approached Eldest Brother, but I’m afraid he won’t listen to us.”</p>
<p>Liu smiled faintly. “You came to me because you want me to talk to your eldest brother about this?”</p>
<p>The entire Lu family knew that it was impossible for Old Madam Lu to listen to her, but the marquis was different. He was her son. Who else would he listen to if not her?</p>
<p>Lu Jing said in a low voice, “If Aunt helps Jing’er, Jing’er would be grateful to you for the rest of her life.”</p>
<p>Liu Shi looked up at her. Although Lu Jing was not as beautiful as Lu Yaoyao, she was also a pretty daughter of a humble family, at least a lot better than Lu Fang.</p>
<p>“I’ll try,” Liu Shi said. If she could really help Lu Jing, she would become the wife of a marquis in the future, and it would always be good for her and Shuang’er.</p>
<p>Lu Jing was delighted. “Thank you, Eldest Aunt.”</p>
<p>“Tao’er, go and invite the marquis over, just say I have something to tell him.” Liu instructed the maid in front of Lu Jing.</p>
<p>“Mother, Fourth Younger Sister and I will go back first and wait for good news from you.” Lu Fang said with a smile and took the other’s hand.</p>
<p>Liu Shi waved lazily and watched the two of them exit the room. She snorted. Now her daughter was still suffering in the Nianci Temple.</p>
<p><em>Lu Yaoyao wants to enjoy happiness now? Dream on!</em></p>
<p>She had waited for half an hour when Lu Lingzhi came to look for her.</p>
<p>“Now I have to wait so long to see my son?” Liu couldn’t help but feel resentful when she saw him.</p>
<p><em>If this son of mine was willing to help his sister, how could Shuang’er become Taoist nun?</em></p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi ignored the cold words. “Mother, you are looking for me for something?”</p>
<p>“Is it only when I have something that I can talk to you? Do you still think of me as your mother in your heart?” Liu Shi asked angrily. “I don’t know what benefits the third household has given you to make you help them at every turn.”</p>
<p>“Mother, what do you want to say?” Lu Lingzhi frowned. He was really annoyed that Liu Shi was always talking about the third household. It was clear that she was the one who owed them, but in her opinion, it was the other way around.</p>
<p>Liu Shi cried, “Do you even want to know what life Shuang’er is living now?” If it weren’t for the third household, how could she be like this? You, like your father, are only helping the third household, regardless of your sister. ”</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi frowned helplessly. “Mother, how many times do you want me to tell you, no one can help Shuang’er. When we entered the palace, the emperor had already ordered her to be abolished as a gui fei. It’s not about Yaoyao. The matter, originally Shuang’er framed her.”</p>
<p>“So what if she hurt her?! Can she still be compared with Shuang’er?” Liu Shi cried out angrily. <em>Lu Yaoyao still can’t match Shuang’er’s finger. She should die for Shuang’er… To save her face!</em></p>
<p>“Your daughter is precious, that doesn’t mean those (daughters) of others are grass,” Lu Lingzhi said coldly.</p>
<p>Liu Shi snorted. “Then don’t be so biased. I heard that Pei Shi asked the old madam to go and ask the empress dowager for a decree to bestow Lu Yaoyao a marriage. Lingzhi, Jing’er is also your sister. You should do it for her. Call the shots.”</p>
<p>“Mother, what exactly are you talking about?” It was his intention to have the old madam ask the empress dowager to give her marriage, what did this have to do with Lu Jing?</p>
