            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 9 – Recognition (2)</h3>
<p>Only the sounds of their sandals hitting the paved wooden floor could be heard as Lu Xiangzhi and Ye Zhen walked in haste. Her heart was beating erratically in rhythm with the occasional squeak her sandal made. Stepping onto the upper tier of the mansion, Ye Zhen slowed her pace, keeping herself two steps behind Lu Xiangzhi who walked forth with ease.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, she saw an old woman, about fifty or sixty years old, sitting on the main seat. Her hair, which must have been dyed, appeared black and lush. The plush chairs on either side of her were already occupied by Lu Shiming and Pei Shi. Leaning closest to the old madam was, of course, Lu Shiming, who made the old madam laugh frequently.</p>
<p>Heads turned in unison when Ye Zhen entered the room and made herself known. She calmly curtsied.</p>
<p>“Ah, so this is the wild girl you told me. Surprisingly, she looks very poised and clever,” Old Madam Lu said, sizing her up with an approving smile on her face.</p>
<p>Looking around the room, Ye Zhen noticed the absence of Lu Lingzhi.</p>
<p><i>Why isn’t he around?</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s tense mood relaxed somewhat. She thought she would see him. She was afraid she would be overwhelmed by her hatred and forget that she was in the presence of the old madam. A ticking bomb, she might not be able to restrain herself at the sight of him.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen, who was absorbed in her own thoughts, did not hear Old Madam Lu talking to her. Pei Shi gave her a gentle tug, pulling her out of stupor. Upon realization, she smiled shyly at the unexpected compliment.</p>
<p>“This girl has not seen much of the world aside from the border town. Apart from that, she was sick and has just recovered.” Lu Shiming explained Ye Zhen’s unresponsive state to Old Madam Lu.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu didn’t know that Ye Zhen was Lu Shiming’s adopted daughter. She thought of her as a close granddaughter. Seeing her lose so much weight, she felt pity and hurried to her side for a moment of care.</p>
<p>“Now, you can’t blame me for being worried about you. Look at you! You are bones and skin. I shall see you every day until you are well, just like a flower in a slow bloom!”</p>
<p>This sudden act reminded Ye Zhen of her past. She was one of the girls who was lucky enough to be born in a life of great comfort. She grew up in a luxurious environment. Not only did her grandmother cherish her, but her father also doted on her. She was lovely and charming. If she hadn’t fallen in love with someone undeserving, she wouldn’t have lived a miserable life and lost her bright perceptive at this age.</p>
<p>Coaxed, Old Madam Lu broke into a smile and hugged Ye Zhen’s small frame.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, Father said the same thing about me. People really do love to see flowers bloom!”</p>
<p>“You little shameless…”</p>
<p>Lu Shiming laughed and felt relieved to see that his daughter had regained her usual liveliness.</p>
<p>Pei Shi looked at Ye Zhen enveloped by the old madam’s tight embrace with a broad smile, proud of her. She was worried that Old Madam Lu wouldn’t like her daughter but it seemed that even the most difficult persons to please could not resist Yaoyao’s charms. She was a true blessing to the family.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu was shocked by what Ye Zhen said and immediately laughed out loud. Several others, maids-in waiting were also unable to hide their amusements. Little did they know that although she had a charming smile on her face, she was dreading the moment Lu Lingzhi would show himself. She was afraid that he would recognize her and kill her before she could do anything.</p>
<p>“What is taking him so long?” Lu Shiming suddenly asked someone behind her.</p>
<p>“I went to see Eldest Brother in the study just now. He is trying to finish his work as of the moment and would join us as soon as he has finished,” said Lu Xiangzhi.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen held her breath and clenched her hands into a tight ball, unaware that her fingernails were deeply piercing her flesh, drawing out blood.</p>
<p>Still witless on how to face Lu Lingzhi without losing her composure, she squeezed harder until pain brought back her cool.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi had tricked her into believing that he was a friend. Naivety had been her downfall. Deceitful as he was, he only used her secret to help his sister make her place in the palace. He was also the tyrant who ended her life.</p>
<p><i>Do these people know the means he used?</i> She wondered.</p>
<p>There was nothing more ridiculous than her becoming his cousin after her rebirth. How could she regard Lu Lingzhi as her eldest brother?</p>
