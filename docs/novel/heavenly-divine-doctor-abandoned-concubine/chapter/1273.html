<p>“How dare younger brothers cross with the eldest brother? Let’s wait until Eldest Brother has kissed!” Lu Tingzhi immediately jested and brought laughter inside the hall.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked up at Lu Lingzhi’s gentle, kind, and handsome face. Using her memory as a spirit in the palace before her rebirth, she tried to remember who Lu Lingzhi would marry in the end.</p>
<p><i>It seemed like it was…</i></p>
<p>Her nose scrunched up as she tried to remember but no one appeared in her mind. She was floating in the palace for the past two years and hadn’t heard Lu Lingzhi, the biggest fish of the Lu Family, had wed.</p>
<p>Lu Lingzhi seemed to have felt Ye Zhen’s stare and suddenly returned the gesture with a shallow smile.</p>
<p>On instinct, Ye Zhen looked away immediately!</p>
<p>In the middle of talking and laughing, it was finally time for the second course to be served.</p>
<p>The banquet resumed and people started to gather. Ye Zhen didn’t know if she was under some illusion, but she felt that Lu Jing had become closer to the Chen Sisters than before!</p>
<p>They were always talking, and she was left out and sometimes, given the cold shoulder.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen didn’t think it was bad to be isolated. Anyway, she had nothing to talk to them about.</p>
<p>“Third Sister will take the exam in half a month. Are you sure?” Chen Liping raised her right eyebrow and asked Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>In the end, there was still some disbelief from the people surrounding her. Ye Zhen felt determination surge her heart, she would prove them wrong by passing the exam!</p>
<p>Before they came to the Lu Mansion, they had already heard of the tanned and ugly Third Sister from the border town.</p>
<p>As a result, they didn’t know the rumor was not credible until they met Ye Zhen, the third sister who was not only beautiful but could also be compared to them!</p>
<p>Ye Zhen cocked her head and thought for a moment. “I dare not take the exam if I am not sure.”</p>
<p>Lu Jing covered her mouth and laughed. “My sister should know what to choose in the entrance examination. Your equestrian skills and archery are all right. What about other aspects… especially musical instruments?”</p>
<p>“This… I’m not all that good at it, but Teacher Shan said it doesn’t matter even if I fail the music exam as long as I pass the other exams.” Ye Zhen answered with confidence.</p>
<p>“Then you must really pray to Buddha that you pass the other exams!” Lu Jing sneered, discreetly mocking Ye Zhen on the table.</p>
<p>Yet, Ye Zhen kept her cool. She nodded seriously. “I heard that the <a href="http://english.visitbeijing.com.cn/a1/a-XCCG5C2C9D1F8383C5454B">Hugou Temple</a> is very effective. You are right, Fourth Sister, it is good to ask for a spiritual sign before I take the exam.”</p>
<p>“I will go with my third sister,” said Chen Qiuping suddenly.</p>
<p>“Okay!” Ye Zhen gave her a thankful smile.</p>
<p>At the end of the banquet, Lu Jing took the Chen Sisters and left first. While men were indulged in themselves, Ye Zhen took this as an opportunity to talk to Pei Shi alone.</p>
<p>She took her hand and invited her to go outside, saying that a small exercise was good for digestion after a hearty meal.</p>
<p>“Mother, don’t you… don’t you like father being an official?” Ye Zhen thought that Lu Shiming’s desire for politics was what made Pei Shi look crestfallen all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Pei Shi looked at Ye Zhen in surprise. “Mother doesn’t dislike it. Why do you think so?”</p>
<p>“I think Mother looks gaunt off late…” she asked inquisitively, though her mother’s appearance was apparently caused by poor diet and lack of sleep.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, Mother is fine.” Pei Shi lovingly touched Ye Zhen’s head.</p>
<p>“It is just that some people are not used to life here. But don’t worry, I will adjust soon enough! Besides, I’m glad that the capital suits you.”</p>
<p>However, Ye Zhen felt that things were not so simple as what Pei Shi had said.</p>
<p>She must have something on her mind, but Ye Zhen didn’t force her to speak anymore and just nodded obediently.</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s time to go back and rest early. Teacher Shan will be training you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Mother, I’ll go back first,” said Ye Zhen after giving Pei Shi a warm embrace and a peck on her cheek. She decided to ask Lu Xiangzhi tomorrow since he must know better about what was happening to his parents.</p>
<p>On her way back, Ye Zhen saw Teacher Shan standing in the courtyard, looking at all the flowers and grass in the garden, lost in thoughts.</p>
