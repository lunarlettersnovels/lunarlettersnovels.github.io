            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 84 – Questions (1)</h3>
<p>Tang Zhen staggered back in surprise.</p>
<p>For the first time, in such a long time, he heard someone mention the late wang fei. Today, almost no one in the capital dared say that name in public.</p>
<p><i>How did Lu Yaoyao know? Wasn’t she always in the border town? It is impossible for her to know the late Wang Fei Ye Zhen!</i></p>
<p>“Don’t you know, no one in the Ye Family is good, even the wang fei… She was not a good person at all!” Was his defense. The whole world knew that they deserved to die.</p>
<p>“Have you seen her?” Ye Zhen asked with a conniving smile.</p>
<p><i>Not a good person?</i> Ye Zhen felt like laughing.</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen the wang fei? Do you know what kind of person she was? Ye Family did all kinds of evil, you say. But did the innocents truly deserve to be killed?”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen squinted at her slightly. “Where did you hear of this? Did someone tell you this rubbish?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen took a deep breath. She had become impulsive and careless to say these things to him.</p>
<p>“Marquis Tang, it’s too late for me to invite you for a tea. It’s getting dark, you should leave as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao!” Tang Zhen stretched out his hand in an attempt to hold her back.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen avoided his hand and said coldly, “Marquis Tang, please conduct yourself.”</p>
<p>“Don’t heed to gossip. You have to see some things with your own eyes before you believe. If the Ye Family was innocent, the people of the capital wouldn’t have set off firecrackers to celebrate the moment they were beheaded.” Tang Zhen whispered.</p>
<p>“Get out of here!” Ye Zhen lashed out, glaring at him venomously before turning towards Zhuangzi’s gate with heavy steps.</p>
<p>Only after the gates were closed did Tang Zhen move from the place he was standing. He felt more and more sure that someone was behind the third miss’ sudden aggression.</p>
<p><i>Ye Family…</i></p>
<p><i>Is it not because of the Ye Family that he became an orphan?</i></p>
<p><i>What is the motive of the person who fed Lu Yaoyao of those ideas?</i></p>
<p>From his perspective, Lu Yaoyao was coerced to sympathize with the infamous family.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen saw this as a problem. Hence, with a determined face, he turned his horse around and rode as swiftly as the wind! He had to go back and investigate the accident, afterwards, he planned to talk to Lu Lingzhi about his third sister.</p>
<p>Within the confines of the Zhuangzi’s walls, Ye Zhen ran as fast as her legs could go, afraid that if she didn’t leave the soonest, she wouldn’t be able to stop herself from pouring out her rage!</p>
<p>Yes, she knew better than anyone how her uncle was despised by the whole world, but what does this have to do with her father and brother?</p>
<p>And her? What did she have to die for?</p>
<p>She ran for a long time, until her legs hurt, her breath coming out of her chest in painful heaps…</p>
<p>Today had been more eventful than what she’d expected, it was too much for her to bear, too much for her heart to take. She couldn’t help but question Tang Zhen. She wasn’t able to suppress her anger towards the likes of him.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the garden, Ye Zhen buried her face in her hands but found herself unable to cry out, and she felt even more terrible.</p>
<p><i>Mo Rongzhan didn’t recognize her, isn’t it good? </i>At least he would not know what she had to do with Ye Family, and it would be easier for her to get revenge in the future.</p>
<p>“Third Miss, are you all right?” When Dai Mei passed through the garden, she saw Ye Zhen miserably hugging her knees on the ground, so she hurried over.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen heard footsteps and saw Dai Mei approaching.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. Third Madam will stay with Eldest Brother for the coming days so she can take care of him personally. Please tell the housekeeper not to let anyone in.”</p>
<p>She knew that Tang Zhen would come and see her again, but she didn’t want to face him anymore.</p>
<p>By the tone of her mistress, she didn’t want to be disturbed so Dai Mei dutifully went out to do her bidding, leaving her again to herself.</p>
<p>Willing herself to stand up, Ye Zhen returned to her chambers and changed her clothes before finding Teacher Shan.</p>
<p>When Teacher Shan heard that Lu Lingzhi was injured, her eyes brightened slightly but was disappointed to hear that it was not at all serious.</p>
<p>“Teacher, let us stay in Zhuangzi until I take the academy entrance exam.” Ye Zhen suggested, not wanting to return to the capital so soon.</p>
<p>“All right.” Teacher Shan had no problem. Anyway, learning is the same wherever one desires to do it.</p>
