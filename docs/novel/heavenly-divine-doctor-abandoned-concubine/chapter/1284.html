<p>Ye Zhen waited for Old Madam Lu’s return. She sat on the porch until a familiar carriage was seen approaching the mansion at sunset.</p>
<p>“Grandmother, you’re back!” Ye Zhen cleverly welcomed the old madam and practically clung to her side with some feigned uneasiness and nervousness.</p>
<p>“Please forgive me for I wasn’t able to spend the meet with you. It’s because I was invited to hunt.”</p>
<p>“Oh, child! Don’t be sorry. What kind of grandmother would forbid her granddaughter from doing the thing that she likes? I heard Teacher Shan saying that you need to take the equestrian test by next month. Then, by all means, you should practice!” Old Madam Lu assured her. Their arms interlocked as they went inside the mansion.</p>
<p>“Before I forget, did you really beat a sika deer for your grandmother?” Old Madam Lu sounded pleased.</p>
<p>She had a simple heart and liked a person who did things to be in her favor, just like Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>Perhaps she loved her granddaughter and loved her youngest son Lu Shiming who had been away from her for many years.</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandmother. It’s a male deer, I sent it to the tannery to make leather. I will make a coat for my grandmother and several rabbit furs into sleeves,” Ye Zhen said smilingly, leaning on Old Madam Lu’s arm.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu beamed as she felt that although her granddaughter didn’t grow up under her roof, she was the most filial and obedient. “Well, Grandmother is waiting for your coat, and don’t forget to make one for your mother.”</p>
<p>“I will not forget, Grandmother.”</p>
<p>“Good!” Old Madam Lu’s eyes squinted with her smile, and she led Ye Zhen by the hand into a corner, having something important to tell her.</p>
<p>“Today, the wang fei inquired about how you were doing with your preparation for the entrance examination of the Academy for Women. She encourages you to work hard, and have the opportunity to work inside the imperial palace!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen’s eyes flashed a dim light, which the old madam mistook for satisfaction. “Her Highness is so kind.” Ye Zhen answered timidly.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu smiled and nodded. “Wang Fei is a blessing in our family.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, don’t you feel exhausted after a day outside? Your legs must be tired!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen veered the topic from Lu Wushuang. After the incident with Lu Lingzhi, she couldn’t trust herself anymore.</p>
<p>The mere mention of the woman’s name would put her into rage. She was afraid that she would uncontrollably show her disgust for the reigning wang fei in front of Old Madam.</p>
<p>“I heard that your eldest brother was injured by a sharp branch during the hunt. Don’t you still want to take an examination of the School of Medicine? Show your eldest brother your skills and mend his wound.”</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu encouraged her, not knowing in the slightest about the unfortunate incident.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen reluctantly accepted the suggestion. She came to curry favor from the old madam just to avoid attending to Lu Lingzi. But the old madam readily introduced her grandson as a practice patient for her!</p>
<p>She was about to decline but she suddenly remembered Pei Shi. Ah! She would definitely scold her if a word of her apathy reached her ears.</p>
<p>“Of course Grandmother, I’ll take some medicine to my eldest brother,” said Ye Zhen reluctantly.</p>
<p>Old Madam Lu, however, regarded her as shy and nervous. “Go ahead, that’s your eldest brother. Don’t be afraid. You know that your eldest brother is the best person to get along with.”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen scoffed softly. <i>He was indeed the best person to get along with, one who could kill people without blinking an eye!</i></p>
