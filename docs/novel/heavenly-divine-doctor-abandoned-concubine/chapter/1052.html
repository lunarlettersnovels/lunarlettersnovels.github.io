            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 277 – A Father’s Love (1)</strong></p>
<p>Her nimble steps quickly brought her out of the study. While her serene visage shielded her thoughts the cogs of her mind were swiftly turning within.</p>
<p>Rather than miffed, she was more determined to see her plans of vengeance through. Indeed, it was a bit unexpected that Lu Shixun would come to her and for such a thing. It seemed this encounter was not without advantage. The second lord’s solemn and taciturn deportment had led her to believe that he must be a fair-minded and reasonable person. However, today displayed in full view that he was nothing but a wily old fox who wouldn’t hesitate at the slightest to see through his gains. Just because he couldn’t spite Lu Wushuang, he would make her a sacrificial lamb? Marrying her away and how?!</p>
<p>She reckoned he must have first had a word with Lu Shiming, and when that hit an impasse he sought her out. Playing the sentimental and filial card to lure her out of the capital … making it all seem as if it were her own initiative … Like this, even if he wished, Lu Shiming wouldn’t be able to do a thing about it.</p>
<p>It was truly a well thought out plan, except he had overestimated himself! Or rather the extent of her filial piety.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen shook her head and smiled. All this was because the eldest miss of this family was perched high up in the society, so high that he would not think twice before pushing the innocents in the family into the firepit at her behest. <em>What kind of glory did Lu Shixun think Lu Wushuang could bring to the Lu Family?</em></p>
<p>Indeed, she had amplified her foe’s intellect. She had thought, this man who was at the helm of affairs would be astute and meticulous. It turned out, the man was markedly short-sighted. Still, her heart held a tinge of thanks for what he did and said to her today. If not, how else would she have glimpsed the true persona of the head of Lu Family’s business?</p>
<p>To be fair, she could understand the man’s anxieties. If the family had not a miss who became a wang fei, would the business flourish as such? With the man’s apprehensions laid bare, it would be much easier for Man Qin to deal with Lu Shixun.</p>
<p>Now, the smile on Ye Zhen’s face was even more genuine. Her mood was not at all affected by Lu Shixun. Instead, she was happier … her enemy had walked right up to her and bore his true intentions.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen skipped back to the room, and before she sat down for a cup of tea, Lu Shiming came to her.</p>
<p>“Father, what brings you here?” Ye Zhen asked with a smile and went to fetch the floral tea leaves that she grew on her own.</p>
<p>A worry-laced Lu Shiming scanned her quickly and asked, “Yaoyao, did your second uncle come to you just now?”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen smiled and said, “Father, try it, this is made with the floral tea leaves I grew myself.”</p>
<p>“I am asking you about some serious business.” Lu Shiming glared at Ye Zhen but still took a sip from the white porcelain cup in his hand, and sighed comfortably. “This tea is good, and I will bring some of it to your mother.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Father. You can make some tea to bring to the study too,” Ye Zhen said. This floral tea was grown with <em>lingquan</em>, it is more fragrant and stronger than normal tea. “Second Uncle did come to me just now.” She dawdled no more and broached the subject herself.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming’s smile immediately faded. “What did he say to you? Yaoyao, don’t listen to what he says. It’s just some nonsense.” He hurriedly reassured his daughter. She was the pearl on his palm, and his brother with his ridiculous notions wanted to bring her to grief. He was more afraid of his innocent girl falling into his pace.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen chuckled. Ah, Lu Shiming was ever the modest gentleman. His words were always polite, demeanour gentle, and manner affectionate. For someone like him, to use such a foul tongue, just how agitated might he be? He was clearly angry at his brother, she felt inexplicably warm in her heart.</p>
<p>“Father, don’t worry. I didn’t listen to him. I only listen to you.” Her eyes gleamed with playfulness.</p>
<p>Lu Shiming looked at his mischievous daughter and said with a smile, “Your second uncle is not really mean. He wants to do good for the family, but he can’t ask you to compromise for the good of the family.”</p>
<p>“I am not compromising as long as you are here.” Ye Zhen reassured him with a smile.</p>
<p>“Lass, you’ve grown up and changed so much, I’m a little surprised. No wonder the wang fei can’t tolerate it.” Lu Shiming looked at her as if she had become another person after returning to the capital, feeling deeply moved.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen pouted and said, “Father, am I not good enough?”</p>
<p>“Who dares to say that my daughter is not good?” Lu Shiming’s eyes flared. “Yaoyao, no matter who tells you what, as long as you don’t like it, don’t agree to it. I will take care of everything.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Father.” Ye Zhen smiled mischievously.</p>
