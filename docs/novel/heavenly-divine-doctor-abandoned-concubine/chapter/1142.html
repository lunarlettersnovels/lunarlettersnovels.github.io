            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 185 – Trap (2)</strong></p>
<p>One needs to know, there was a reason these herbs were termed precious. Right from their availability to growth, their upkeep was a challenge of its own. And fire lotus was no exception. Especially, its little bud that was the most difficult to blossom. When every herb growing here bore the label ‘invaluable’, no wonder the glasshouse was a forbidden place for the students. However, Ye Zhen was not aware that there existed such rules.</p>
<p>This was deliberately concealed from her. In this academy, there were too many who wanted to see her falter, and many who wanted to oust her.</p>
<p>In the face of this grave predicament, Ye Zhen did not panic nor looked to escape. She knew doing so was futile. Just as she was deliberating over her plight, she saw Huang Fuxiang bringing Su Xinmei and Qin Fuzi over.</p>
<p>This was a tricky situation. She was all alone in this glasshouse with the ruined fire lotus- the damage was done, and no matter what, she would have to shoulder the blame. However, if she were to go out of the glasshouse at this time, she would be most certainly accused of a greater crime, thus, conforming to the trap set upon her.</p>
<p>She stared at the fire lotus before her, eyes seething with rage. Time and again they had been schemed against. She knew she had walked right into their snare. She was incensed that those people had actually used a mere fire lotus plant to frame her! But who was Ye Zhen? Was not she clever enough for the emergent situation?!</p>
<p><i>Well, I truly wanted to pay no mind to them. Looks like it is time to kill the chicken to warn the monkey.</i></p>
<p>Ye Zhen did not waste a minute longer. Instantly, she set about looking for a bigger flowerpot. Then, she filled this pot with the scattered soil, placed the plant inside and along the way buried the fallen leaves. She picked some green grass from outside, and spread a layer of grass atop the soil.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Just in time, Su Xinmei appeared outside the transparent walls of the glasshouse. She looked at Ye Zhen with fierce eyes. But when her line of sight fell on the fire lotus, she shouted angrily, “How dare you destroy the fire lotus!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was about to speak when she heard Su Xinmei snap at her.</p>
<p>“Do you not know that the glasshouse is a forbidden place in this medicine field? You do not have permission to enter here. You have violated the rules of the academy. You even dared to destroy the fire lotus. Do you know how big a crime you have committed? Even you cannot compare to the fire lotus. How dare you destroy it!”</p>
<p>A furious Su Xinmei spared no effort in admonishing Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>All the while, Qin Fuzi had been quite. Slowly and quietly, he walked into the glasshouse. Upon seeing the fire lotus flower in Ye Zhen’s hand, he was a little surprised.</p>
<p>On the side, as she stood behind Su Xinmei, Huang Fuxiang was beaming with pride. She looked at Ye Zhen with a scornful gaze.</p>
<p>“Master Qin, Su Xinmei, I just saw Lu Yaoyao sneaking over here. Knowing that this is a forbidden place, it seems that she wanted to steal the fire lotus.” Huang Fuxiang maliciously insinuated.</p>
<p>Su Xinmei’s thoughts were evident in her cold eyes. Gradually, her cold gaze on Ye Zhen turned icy, and she said to Qin Fuzi, “Qin Fuzi, this matter must be brought to the curator.”</p>
<p>If this matter were to be handed over to the curator, Lu Yaoyao was bound to be expelled from the academy.</p>
<p>However, Qin Fuzi did not answer Su Xinmei. Instead, he just calmly walked towards Ye Zhen, looked down at the fire lotus in her hand, raised his eyebrow, and asked, “Did you change the flowerpot?”</p>
<p>By now, Ye Zhen had surmised that no matter what she said, no one would believe her if she were to associate Lu Qiongqiu with this matter. Nor did she have the evidence to prove the latter’s mischief and it was amply obvious, Lu Qiongqiu and Huang Fuxiang were in cahoots.</p>
<p>“Replying the master, this student did not intend to go to the nearby area while collecting herbs. But saw that the fire lotus had blossomed, but was not in full bloom. There was a small flower bud beside it. If one does not mind changing for a bigger flower pot, one is afraid that the fire lotus would soon wither and the small flower bud would never bloom.” Ye Zhen answered respectfully, with no sign of tension.</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi pointed to a layer of grass on the fire lotus and asked, “And what is that?”</p>
<p>“Wild grass. The root of the fire lotus needs to be warm. Originally, this student was going to find some hay to burn and spread the ashes on, but there was no fire hinge, so one had to use this method.” Ye Zhen explained.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to plant fire lotus?” Qin Fuzi was a little surprised.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen replied with a bashful smile, “One has let Master see a joke. I like to read books everyday.”</p>
<p>Qin Fuzi smiled and nodded. “You have learned very well. It is important to change the flowerpot of the fire lotus flower, but the one in charge of changing the flowerpot is not here. You have done well.”</p>
<p>When those words fell, Su Xinmei and Huang Fuxiang were dismayed. Their thoughts were incidentally aligned.</p>
<p><i>Should not Lu Yaoyao be punished? Why did Master Qin praise her instead?</i></p>
<p>“Master Qin, does she not need to be punished for entering the glasshouse without permission? She also caused damage to that precious fire lotus!” Huang Fuxiang cried. How could she admit defeat?!</p>
<p>“Wherein was the fire lotus plant damaged? Is it not alright?” Qin Fuzi replied reasonably.</p>
<p>“As for the glasshouse… I remember the glasshouse is always locked. Why was it not locked today? Do we need to bring this to the curator and discuss who is at fault? And if we do, would not the people who manage the glasshouse be held responsible?”</p>
<p>Su Xinmei’s face changed slightly. She knew if this matter were to be escalated, it would not bode well. She looked at Ye Zhen in disdain and could only say, “Well, it is up to Master Qin.”</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang stomped her foot in angst. “Master Qin, you are taking sides with her.”</p>
<p>“So what?” Qin Fuzi asked.</p>
<p>“How can you do that? It is clearly her fault!” Huang demanded with indignation.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen was not flustered by the accusations and spoke lightly. “I saw that the fire lotus was dying, and I had to change the flowerpot. How come I did wrong?”</p>
<p>“You damaged the fire lotus on purpose!” Huang Fuxiang barked angrily.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen suppressed her surging rage and asked with a smile, “You saw it with your own eyes? How do you know that the fire lotus is damaged?”</p>
<p>Su Xinmei intervened, she wanted to end this verbal spar before much more was lost. Looking at Huang Fuxiang, she said, “That is enough, Huang Fuxiang. This matter, it is up to Master Qin. It is not your turn to speak, return!”</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang felt constrained in her heart. She had managed to find a chance to deal with Ye Zhen but had lost it.</p>
<p>“Lu Yaoyao, go back to class, too.” Su Xinmei turned and looked at Ye Zhen with unconcealed coldness.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen replied, “Yes, Master Qin, Teacher Su, this student will go back first.”</p>
<p>Full of resentment, Huang Fuxiang walked back to the field. When she turned back and saw Ye Zhen following, she walked back towards her and said, “Do not be complacent, you shall learn your lesson.”</p>
<p>“You have made me angry.” Ye Zhen looked at Huang Fuxiang and said lightly.</p>
<p>They had no animosity before, so she did not want to care about each other’s occasional provocation. But today, if it were not for the books she had read, particularly on how to plant fire lotus, she might have been expelled from the academy. <i>Perhaps, fate was in her favor.</i></p>
<p>She had finally entered the School of Medicine and wished never to be dismissed. Now, Huang Fuxiang had provoked and incited her, adding to the stumbling blocks she had to break. Therefore, the consequences of her anger would be more serious.</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang sneered. “What if you are angry? What can you possibly do to me?”</p>
<p>“I really did not wish to do anything to you.” Ye Zhen nodded softly. “But by fair means or foul, I will do anything.”</p>
<p>She would do anything for Huang Fuxiang to not dare provoke her again.</p>
