            <p><strong>Chapter 493 – Kill Them One by One</strong></p>
<p>Ye Zhen knew too well where the knot in her heart was, she regretted saving Mo Rongzhan in the grove countless times. If she had not saved him, she would not have met him. Without meeting him, she would not have been obsessed with him for so many years, and would not have insisted on marrying him. So her life that could have been bright and wonderful, turned dim and lonely. She could only be lonely, helpless, and desperate in anticipation in the courtyard of the Qin Wangfu. This man she loved deeply would never look back at her, he did not care to know her feelings for him.</p>
<p>When they’d met in the small forest, he’d promised to remember her but in the end, he regarded someone else as her. She was just an insignificant person in his eyes. She hated him so much before because she had been betrayed for eight years, and even hated him more for showing no mercy to her father and elder brother. However, only now did she know that he had not bestowed the poisoned wine but rather secretly saved her father and brother. He was not really ruthless and unjust…</p>
<p>But the person he liked was Lu Yaoyao, not Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>This… Even if she didn’t hate him anymore, she couldn’t let go of the knot in her heart to accept him. So, she wanted him to know that the person who saved him was Ye Zhen, and if he could accept it, then she… may be able to untie the knot.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked down at the quiet person in his embrace. Although he didn’t know what her present thoughts were, he knew that if he didn’t let her go to Huaijiang, she might never untie the knot let alone tell him the secret in her heart. He could only let her do as she wishes and await her return to reveal the secret.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, are you alright?” Tang Zhen was already waiting at the foot of the mountain. When he saw Mo Rongzhan carrying Ye Zhen, he immediately ran over.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen hurriedly pushed Mo Rongzhan, got out of his embrace, and looked into Tang Zhen’s concerned eyes. She smiled and said, “Big Brother Tang, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen heaved a sigh of relief and restrained his emotions. “It’s good that you’re fine. Why were you on the mountain? Where’s Mister Chen?”</p>
<p>“He is still at the villa over there, how did you all… How did you find this place? When did these soldiers come?” Ye Zhen had too many questions. Although she had been brought to the iron mine blindfolded, she felt that the mountain roads were rugged and turned left and right. It was obvious how remote the place was.</p>
<p>“We already found this place ten days ago. His Majesty told instructed to look for General Meng. We disguised ourselves to blend in. The last riot was also planned by the emperor to draw out the real owner of the iron mine. I didn’t expect to see you. Yaoyao, it’s good that you’re fine.” Tang Zhen almost cried out when he saw her.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan looked at their harmonious conversation and felt jealous. “Marquis Jing Ning, come with me to capture Zhao Tianji and Xue Lin take the princess back to the carriage, and protect her.”</p>
<p>Tang Zhen immediately recalled what Mo Rongzhan had said, “Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Wait for me in the carriage.” Mo Rongzhan said as he looked down at Ye Zhen.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, be careful,” Ye Zhen whispered.</p>
<p>Mo Rongzhan smiled faintly, gesturing to Wu Chong to escort Ye Zhen to the carriage to rest.</p>
<p>At this moment, those people who were forced to work here were all pushed to the side. There were more than ten soldiers asking them questions. They should be sent off soon.</p>
<p>The private mine had already been taken over by the military. Qiu Yuan was riddled with wounds all over his body and was on his knees, suppressed by General Meng. Seeing Ye Zhen passing by, he shouted angrily, “How dare you betray the Island Lord!”</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him indifferently. “I was captured by your people. I’m neither Zhao Tianji’s servant nor his subordinate. What kind of betrayal are you talking about? Besides, I was brought in with my eyes covered. How could I leave a clue for them to find me here?”</p>
<p>Qiu Yuan actually knew that this matter had nothing to do with her. It was just that he was unreconciled with the fact that a private mine that had been so well hidden had actually been found, and that the location of the mountain villa had been discovered.<em> If anything were to happen to Island Lord, Eldest Master would certainly not let me off.</em></p>
<p>“You… If you don’t say it, how would they know where the villa was?” Qiu Yuan said angrily.</p>
<p>Ye Zhen looked at him coldly. “My master is still in the villa. Shouldn’t I save him? Just because you are loyal to Zhao Tianji, should I be heartless and abandon my master?”</p>
<p>Qiu Yuan was speechless. He had indeed forgotten that Huangfu Chen was still in the villa and he was Lu Yaoyao’s master.</p>
<p>“Your Highness Princess, there’s no need to bother with him,” Xue Lin said from the side.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ye Zhen nodded lightly and walked to the carriage beside her.</p>
<p>Qiu Yuan looked coldly at the little departing figure. He had forgotten one thing. This woman was a princess. He shouldn’t have allowed his subordinates to capture a princess. Now that Island Lord’s legs hadn’t been truly healed, this private mine had been discovered… He only hoped that Island Lord in the villa would have heard the news and left. Otherwise…</p>
<p>No matter what, he could not reveal the location of other private mines. This was the most important thing.</p>
<p>♚</p>
<p>By now, Liang Yin had arrived at the villa. He was panting as he went to the Peach Blossom Spring to find Zhao Tianji.</p>
<p>Zhao Tianji was walking slowly in the courtyard. Huangfu Chen looked at him with a smile on his face. The two of them had returned to their old ways of getting along.</p>
<p>“Island Lord, this is bad!” Liang Yin dashed in. Seeing that Zhao Tianji could walk on his own, he couldn’t care less about his surprise. “The soldiers of Jin Country found our private mine, Qiu Yuan and the others are all caught.”</p>
<p>“What?” Zhao Tianji’s expression changed. “Where’s Lu Yaoyao?”</p>
<p>Liang Yin didn’t expect his master’s first concern would be Lu Yaoyao. “She is still on the mountain, I thought nothing would happen to her, so I rushed over to tell you about it”</p>
<p>Although Zhao Tianji was angry, he knew that anger was useless. He slowly turned to Huangfu Chen and asked, “Do you know who took my mine?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see it with my own eyes, how could I know who it was?” Huangfu Chen said helplessly. “Don’t forget that Yaoyao is a princess, and she is deeply liked by the Empress Dowager and the Emperor. If she went missing, the court cannot remain indifferent.”</p>
<p>“Humph, no matter who comes to save her, I will kill them one by one.” Zhao Tianji snorted.</p>
<p>Liang Yin hurriedly said, “Island Lord, they are not ordinary yamen guards (police), but… they are soldiers from the military camp. I saw a man dressed as a general showing great respect to another mystery man.”</p>
<p>“Who exactly is the person who came?” Zhao Tianji was surprised and frowned at Huangfu Chen.</p>
<p>Huang Fu Chen sighed. “If I were you, I would leave here first. The nearest military camp is the West Camp. The general of the West Camp is General Meng. Who is able to make General Meng respectful, how many people do you think there are in this world?”</p>
<p>“The person who came is Mo Rongzhan!” Zhao Tianji’s voice suddenly went cold. “He, an emperor of the Jin Country, is actually lurking here for Lu Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>Liang Yin looked at Zhao Tianji anxiously. “Island Lord, what should we do now?”</p>
