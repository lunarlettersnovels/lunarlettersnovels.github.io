            <p><b>Chapter 6.2</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She looks ready to do anything we tell her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cream smeared on Wangnyeo’s mouth felt slimy and gross.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, my stomach churned. My vision blurred repeatedly as scenes and sounds tangled together chaotically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mocking faces, condescending stares, words laced with scorn and dismissal. Feelings of isolation and powerlessness enveloped me like the air of a familiar hometown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was strange, this kind of thing never happened in my life. The back of my neck prickled, and my fingertips trembled.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Whisper, whisper.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indistinct voices slowly spread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sounds formed sentences, etching into my mind like photographs.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Look at that idiot. So clueless, like a complete fool.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What don’t I know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grabbed at one grating sentence and tried to ask, but no answer came. Someone in my head kept whispering other words incessantly in my ears.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">All the stupidity in the world must be in her head. Her actions are nothing short of idiotic.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My stomach roiled.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What do you even do right?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">That one’s crying again. Ugh, I’m so sick of it.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">F!,ck, even touching her ch3.st is so damn expensive.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Why do you live like this?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s the point of your existence?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Buzz, buzz.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> The sentences rose and fell, swirling in my head all at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt suffocated. I felt like vomiting. The nausea was unbearable. It was like being alone in a room with dozens of people talking at once, hearing every sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My vision spun. Amid the murky mix of sentences and words, someone maliciously hammered words into my ears.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">You don’t even know who your husband is screwing, do you?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, something surged from deep in my gut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A pitch black night, a terrace railing… No, was that the prison wall? Something sharp stabbed at my insides, as if about to tear through me.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Uweeek.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a harsh, gut-scraping sound, I threw up everything I hadn’t even eaten much of.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew there were people who hated me. I knew there were those who smiled and acted friendly to my face but slandered and mocked me behind my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew people whispered that no backup dancer hadn’t slept with Geummi, that her hip-swaying dance moves hooked every man, that she climbed to her position by seducing broadcast PDs and CEOs with her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a music industry dominated by pure, delicate singers like Ha Sumin or Lee Jiyoon, I was a challenge, a provocation, a disruption. On TV and in magazines, most cheered my outspokenness, but I also knew there were envious, spiteful glares.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But so what?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether people hated me, disliked me, or slandered me behind my back, I didn’t care one bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their words were knives, but by the time they reached me, the blades were so dull that they were unable to leave a scratch. That was how I am.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I’m Geummi. Bold, unapologetic, never cowed. I don’t bow to anyone and I’m living the life everyone envied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, that’s me. If I wanted something, I didn’t wait for luck. I took it, even if it belonged to someone else. That’s who Kim Geummi was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s the kind of person I am, I’m definitely—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Doctor, I must’ve committed a terrible sin…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They say there are sins you commit unknowingly. Maybe, as Geummi, I did something wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I couldn’t confidently say I never gave anyone a reason to resent me. Maybe I did something to deserve a hit in the dark, or maybe I committed a sin big enough for this punishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Interpreting my words somehow, Doctor Ahn let out a soft sigh and clasped my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeohee-ssi, we’re all sinners. None of us can stand blameless.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Even you, Doctor Ahn?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a strange person. To say she’s a sinner in front of someone locked up for real crimes. Is religion what makes someone so humble?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at the cross on the infirmary wall. For some reason, looking at it made my heart clench. I quickly looked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My attempt to get three packs of cigarettes had failed. Even I thought it was ridiculous, I also realized I was in a situation desperate enough to lose my sense of judgment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Wangnyeo and Yera, there was no way they’d lend me commissary money. I’d have been better off asking a random passerby for cigarettes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong, Yeohee-ssi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Doctor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called her with a different tone, her eyes behind round glasses blinked slowly, like a cow’s. I desperately grabbed her plump fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Doctor, I… I’m really sorry, but could you put some money in my commissary? I’ll pay you back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doctor Ahn watched me silently, as if waiting for me to continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There, there’s something I really need… I checked, and I don’t have any commissary money, and my family… I can’t reach them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if understanding, Doctor Ahn let out a deep sigh. Relief washed over me. I’d made it, it was done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, Yeohee-ssi, but prison staff can’t deposit commissary money for inmates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… administrative reasons, let’s say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doctor Ahn smiled awkwardly as if she was put in a tight spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It made sense when I thought about it. This was a place crawling with inmates, and you couldn’t rule out someone intimidating a soft-looking staff member to extort commissary money. I heard the sound of a sliver of hope crumbling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you need so badly, Yeohee-ssi? Is there something you’d like to eat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hope flickered again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhm, it’s not anything else… Could you possibly get me just three packs of cigarettes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Any kind of 88 cigarettes is fine. Sol or Rose would be fine too. Anything is fine as long as it’s cigarettes, just three packs if you could—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A crack appeared on her kind, round face. Her gentle expression shattered like a broken bowl, a faint trace of contempt flickered at the corner of her eyes.</span></p>
