            <p><b>Chapter 3.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I learned quite a bit from the woman in the infirmary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of this body was Ham Yeohee, age twenty-three. Sentenced to seven years, she’d been locked up for about two, and transferred here from another prison not long ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The more important question came after that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Doctor, do you happen to know anything about Geummi in Seoul?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Geummi? Who’s that? A friend?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was dumbstruck. She didn’t even watch TV, apparently. She didn’t know me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I had a rough picture of this body’s situation, I needed to find out where my real body was and what it was doing. I had to know whether that woman had taken my life and left me here, or whether I, the real me, was okay somewhere else after the accident. The thought gnawed at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mind went back to that night in front of the apartment complex. The blow felt as vivid as if it were still happening, and I found myself rubbing the back of my head without thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who could it have been? Who could have hated me enough to do that? My manager? Or some deranged fan who’d been sending weird letters?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being a top star meant you received love and hate in equal measure. I had enemies, sure. But I could not believe anyone would want to actually hurt me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nervous and anxious, I chewed at my nails. Before I knew it, we were standing in front of the familiar iron-barred door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clank. The lock clicked, the rusty door swung open, and the women in the cramped room turned to look at me. A hand shoved my back and I shuffled inside, half unwilling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gate slammed shut behind me without mercy. Inhaling, I tasted the stale odors and that distinct scent that only women in a cell seem to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cheongjin Women’s Prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the name of the place holding me. I didn’t follow the news closely enough to know much about it. It was somewhere I never expected to set foot in my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scanned the faces in the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On one side, sprawled like a queen against the wall, sat Wangnyeo, the room boss. I figured whoever was strongest, or had the worst crime or longest sentence, naturally became top dog. Wangnyeo fit that role perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She bared her teeth in a grin and made a move to pick a fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you standing there for, baby? Come on in, I’ve been waiting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yera, sitting beside Wangnyeo, opened her eyes wide and snapped at me with venom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you gawking at, you f</span><b><i>ing b</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">h?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yera, the head cleaner, already disliked me, and today she looked especially hostile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kicked off my white rubber shoes and stepped onto the yellow linoleum. I went to the empty spot as if it were mine, sat down, and leaned back. Sitting near the night bucket, a light whiff of urine drifted up. I hugged my knees like armor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wangnyeo snickered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be scared, b***h. I honestly want to shove that spit you aimed at me back down your throat, but I’m busy today. Consider yourself lucky, okay baby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wangnyeo made a mock thump at her waist. Yera quickly grabbed a pillow and fluffed it onto the floor. Wangnyeo settled down and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Eyes. Tell me my fortune for tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the sound of her nickname, a girl about my age called Eyes crawled over to Wangnyeo on her knees. She pulled a little cloth pouch from her waistband, then scattered its contents lightly across the floor. With a faint rustle, a few grains of barley rolled away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s see now…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes closed her lids and swayed her body gently back and forth, muttering something under her breath. The sight looked so convincing that I found myself watching without meaning to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Spirit of heaven and earth, merciful bodhisattvas… Our general speaks. Tomorrow your fortune is great, your destiny shines bright!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Crazy b***h.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wangnyeo and Yera snickered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It did seem crazy to me too. What good was a great fortune in prison? They said she’d been caught running scams pretending to be a shaman before she landed here, but I had to admit, the act looked real enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking that, Eyes suddenly snapped her head toward me. The angle was strange, as if someone had twisted her neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When her gaze met mine, my whole body stiffened. Her pupils, wide and dark, seemed to focus on me with one eye while the other drifted off to someplace unseen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They said with those crossed eyes she could see ghosts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And right now, her black pupils glistened like she really was seeing one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You.”</span></p>
