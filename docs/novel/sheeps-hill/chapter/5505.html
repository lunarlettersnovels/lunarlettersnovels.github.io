            <p><b>Chapter 13.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe those eyes had been hidden under the brim of his cap all along. The way he looked at me now, hesitant and almost shy, reminded me of that night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sh81t. That’s it. That’s what I needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Yes. I really did miss you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A quiet breath escaped his lips, almost like a sigh. Then came his low command.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get on the bed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bed, there was only one in the infirmary. The same narrow metal cot I’d once lain on when he’d checked my bruised ribs, barely big enough for one person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I hesitated because of where he was pointing, or because his face had turned pink like a teenager’s. Maybe it was just the sudden rush of realization, how fast this was moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Men really were all the same, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slipped off my shoes and climbed onto the bed, lying flat on my back with my hands folded neatly over my stomach, waiting for Deputy Ki to come closer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, I didn’t feel bad about it. In fact, for the first time since I’d woken up in this body, my heart was racing with a sense of anticipation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lifted my head slightly to look at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked awkward, his ears burning red as he cleared his throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">sit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the bed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat up quickly, letting my legs dangle off the edge. Deputy Ki sat down beside me, careful and restrained, his long legs stretched out so his shoes touched the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My own feet didn’t reach, so they swung a little in the air. I stared at the tips of his polished shoes just to have somewhere to look, because really, I was just as embarrassed as he was.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even just sitting there, his posture was straight and firm. The cool, clean scent unique to men lingered faintly between us, barely a handspan apart. It made me want to lean closer and run away all at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That night.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His low voice carried a hint of something heavy, almost foreboding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was a clear violation of duty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It shouldn’t have happened.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His face was clouded with guilt. Like someone burdened by the weight of his own ethics, he exhaled a deep sigh, as if torn between his job and his desire. There was something almost monk-like about him, as if he’d broken some vow of purity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that wouldn’t do. A man with a body and face like that shouldn’t be talking about restraint. And I had things I needed to get from him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached out quickly, placing my hand over the back of his, where his veins stood out against his skin. His broad shoulders flinched slightly. His hand felt solid, so firm it almost seemed to have muscle of its own. I tightened my grip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don’t say that, Deputy Ki. It was my fault… someone like me shouldn’t have…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I trailed off, lowering my head, feeling the weight of his gaze on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time since waking up in this body, I didn’t hate being in it. At least Ham Yeohee had a face that could make men lose their minds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Someone like me, a sinner, shouldn’t have dared to want someone as righteous and pure as you, Deputy Ki. I know that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know I should be repenting quietly instead of thinking such things. It makes sense that you’d feel uncomfortable. A woman like me, with someone like…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let my voice break off, dropping my gaze as if overcome with emotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of man was Deputy Ki, really?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the little time I’d spent watching him, I’d learned a few things about his nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He wasn’t like the others. He wasn’t like Chief Park, who’d drool and pant like a dog at the sight of a bone the moment a woman looked his way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deputy Ki had a kind of quiet dignity about him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could tell just by how he looked. While most of the other guards walked around for days in uniforms stained with pen marks or kimchi soup, his shirt was always spotless, crisp like it had just come back from the dry cleaner’s. The crease on his pants was always sharp enough to cut paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Plenty of guards showed up to work reeking of booze from the night before, but Deputy Ki always smelled clean, fresh like cold air after rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His shoes gleamed, not a speck of dust on them, and his hair, neatly tucked under his cap, stayed perfectly trimmed as if he got it cut every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since his face was usually shadowed by the cap, my eyes naturally drifted to the curve of his cheek, the line of his ear. Even his jawline was clean, no stubble, no roughness, and somehow, even his ears looked handsome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From what I overheard from the other guards, he never once missed a clock-in or a shift rotation, not by a single minute.</span></p>
