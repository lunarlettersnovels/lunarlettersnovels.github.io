            <p><b>Chapter 4.2</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You think there’s only one or two girls that call him out, stand him by the gate, and flash their chests? But he doesn’t even glance, doesn’t touch, just gets red ears, so they call him a Baengchungi or a novice. What a load of cr*p.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even the girls who throw themselves at dried-up pollack soaked in water like that are desperate, but with someone like Deputy Ki? Honestly, outside, you wouldn’t get this close to a guy like him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded. Even I, who lived among people dressed to the nines under dazzling lights, could see Deputy Ki had a presence that drew eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Forget it, he’s a wall. A wall.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes waved her hand in front of my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Deputy Ki doesn’t curse and treats us decently compared to the other guards, so everyone’s gossiping, trying to get a shot at him. But the way I see it, that’s not gonna happen. Deputy Ki is…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waited for her to continue, but Eyes didn’t. She just followed Deputy Ki, who was crossing the yard, with a slightly off-kilter gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, don’t even dream about Deputy Ki. You know Yera from our cell? She’s got it bad for him. You have to be careful. She might act tough because of Wangnyeo, but she’s the scariest one. You know how lonely it gets in here, don’t you? Jealousy drives people crazy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pictured the woman with long hair down to her chest. They called her a “Pretty Nutcase” or something. She was in her thirties, in for fraud or embezzlement, I’d heard. She wasn’t someone I’d want to get involved with, here or outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not dreaming about Deputy Ki or anyone else. I’m not interested.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I meant it. All that mattered were the priorities in my head: getting news from the outside, letting the outside know about me, finding someone who could help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that’s Unni-ya. She makes things easy during evaluations. See that woman with her hair up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes subtly pointed to a woman in her forties with stylishly permed hair. It was impressively well-groomed in this prison. She even had red nail polish on her fingertips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s the boss of Cell 3. I think her charge was seducing under a fraudulent marriage? Anyway, when she first got to Cell 3, she was just like you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Getting beat up, cursed out, sleeping near the latrine, smelling like piss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But how’d she end up running Cell 3? Because…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes paused for effect, then lowered her already quiet voice to a whisper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s got Chief Park.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">This.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> She held up her pinky finger, as if sharing some grand secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She gave Chief Park a few bl*wj*bs, got rid of the b*tch3s harassing her, and now she’s playing queen with the girls who suit her tastes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that even possible?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes clicked her tongue, looking at me like I was clueless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unni-ya, you’re kinda naive, huh? That’s why you keep getting beaten up. If you just pretend to grovel to Wangnyeo, your days would go a lot easier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter if my bones broke or my hair was ripped out, I’d sworn never to bow to Wangnyeo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since you seem clueless, Unni-ya, I’ll let you in on something. At least in Cheongjin Women’s Prison, it’s either </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes made a gesture, poking her finger through a circle. Then she formed a circle with her thumb and index finger, spreading three fingers, and continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s how you survive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">S3.x or money. Give your body or spend cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re especially pretty, so you need to be extra careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that. Anywhere, a pretty woman without backing is the easiest target, and Ham Yeohee was exactly that. Powerless and strikingly beautiful. It was almost surprising she managed to stay unscathed this long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you checked how much commissary money you have?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From what I can tell, Unni-ya, you look broke as hell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes looked me up and down with pity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, check it. Your family might’ve put something in. Buy a Choco Pie or something to give to Wangnyeo. She might ease up a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words made me think the outside and this place weren’t so different. S3.x or money. That’s what ultimately made the world run. Then a thought struck me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you buy magazines or newspapers with commissary money?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Magazines and newspapers? Those don’t get in. The guards use ‘censorship’ as an excuse to read them all and toss them out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you know, it’s not like there’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">no</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> way at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A way? What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes seemed to be debating whether to tell me or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll buy you a Choco Pie, Eyes-ssi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Well, it’s not like I want something in return. Fine, whatever. Go to the laundry workshop and find ‘Choksae.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Choksae?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, she gets outside stuff and news.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Choksae. I nodded. Seeing me nod eagerly, Eyes spoke as if doing me a favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, want me to ask for you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can do that?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why not? No big deal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’d like to ask a favor. Um, the singer Geummi, if there’s any new news or anything like that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes made a face like she couldn’t understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unni-ya, are you really out of your mind? Do you know how expensive Choksae is? And you want her to dig up gossip about some singer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…It’s because it’s important to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a face half-pitying, half-exasperated, Eyes reluctantly nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh, Unni-ya’s life too… Fine, I’ll look into it—hup!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes was answering in a bored, indifferent tone when she suddenly panicked and jumped to her feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shadow fell over my vision. Looking up from my seat, I saw Deputy Ki standing in the bleak winter sunlight, the ornament on his cap glinting that made me instinctively squint. Eyes tugged my arm, pulling me to my feet awkwardly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without a word, Deputy Ki bent down and picked something up from the ground. His large, neat hand turned the packet over. The bag with the playful character crinkled loudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His low, firm voice that matched his character cut through the dry winter air and reached my ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you know personal items aren’t allowed in the exercise yard?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes! Sorry, Deputy Ki. How did that get dragged along?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eyes’s exaggerated, groveling tone emphasized it was just a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From what I’d observed in my time here, the prison’s rules were strict but flexible. Break the same rule, and if you were unlucky, you’d get solitary confinement; if you were lucky, you might just get a reprimand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luck depended entirely on which guard caught you and their mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was I lucky or unlucky today?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rule violation means three days’ ban from the exercise yard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only fifteen minutes after lunch. Without it, I’d be stuck in the suffocating cell block and workshop all day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Deputy Ki.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His face turned to me. Backlit by the sun, he felt like a shadow. Nervously, I fixed my gaze on his third button and spoke cautiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could you… let it slide just this once?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are exceptions to every moment. I put on the most pitiful, pleading expression I could muster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For this moment at least, I wished the things I’d done all this time could serve as an excuse. Just a mistake by poor, crazy 7059, who gets beaten up in the cell all the time… Maybe he’d let it go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But his response was smooth as if sanded down, without a hint of wavering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No exceptions. 7059, you are banned from the exercise yard for three days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring my low sigh, Deputy Ki turned and walked back to his post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baengchungi, novice—what nonsense! Deputy Ki, who just bluntly spit out what he wanted to say and walked off like it was just business, was no different from a brick wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glared irritably at his retreating figure holding the confiscated Apollo packet. Just my rotten luck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…But how did he know the Apollo was mine? I hadn’t even picked it up from where Eyes placed it.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Beep.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> The grating chime rang out. After just fifteen minutes in the dim winter light, I stepped back through the iron gate, carrying a damp, uneasy feeling like half-dried laundry.</span></p>
