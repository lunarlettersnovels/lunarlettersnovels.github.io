            <p><b>Chapter 14.2</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe realizing how close we were, Deputy Ki’s ears flushed red again as he pulled back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strangely enough, that gave me a sense of relief. It wasn’t that I was scared of the idea of taking things further after having the bold thought of wanting to strip him—it was the feeling that I had the upper hand in this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was rigid, disciplined, and fastidious, yet here he was, a man who couldn’t handle a single woman coming on to him, settling for just a kiss. It almost amused me. If things ever turned around, I could drop him without a second thought. Seducing a man like Deputy Ki? That was nothing for someone like Kim Geummi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hesitated, pretending to be shy, then slowly reached for the top button of my prison uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The worn plastic buttons slipped free one by one through the frayed holes. One, two, three… and the last.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pushed the fabric off my shoulders and my bare chest was exposed, his eyes wavered violently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cold air brushed over my skin, and my nipples tightened in response. I shifted slightly, and the soft, full mounds of my br2.s!s swayed heavily with the movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deputy Ki swallowed hard, the sound low in his throat. What amazed me was that it didn’t seem awkward or clumsy. His eyes trembled, and the bulge beneath his pants was obvious, but he didn’t rush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are people who throw themselves at a feast the moment it’s in front of them, and there are those who pause, wondering how best to savor it. Deputy Ki was definitely the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I guided his large hand forward, he let it follow mine without resistance. I placed it on the swell of my br2.s!, and the warmth that spread there—whether from his desire or his body heat—felt like a hot pulse against my skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… it’s warm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words slipped out before I could stop them, and they were no lie. His hands were hot like a heater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my soft sound, his hand flinched, then tightened, gripping my br2.s! gently but firmly. His large palm couldn’t contain it all, the overflow of pale flesh spilling between his fingers—a sight so vivid that even I felt my stomach tighten with heat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa… Deputy Ki… will you… touch me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay… you can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I coaxed him sweetly, his hesitant hand finally moved. It kneaded, pressed, explored, his grip growing bolder with every squeeze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even without any real technique, just that earnest pressure was enough to draw a sigh from me. Anyone sitting in front of a man that beautiful, watching him stare and touch like that, would’ve m0a2n!d too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa… that feels good…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaning back on my arms, I let one br2.s! fall completely into his hand. His gaze flicked to the other, and soon enough, he was cupping that one too, filling his palms with the heavy weight of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ham Yeohee’s br2.s!s were at least two cup sizes bigger than the ones I used to have. Too big, too bothersome, and not even worth spending money on a bra for. But now, it felt like they were paying me back for all the trouble, flooding my body with waves of pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe these were Yeohee’s most sensitive spots. Or maybe it was because the one touching them was Deputy Ki, moving his hands in a slow, steady rhythm, gripping just hard enough to make me dizzy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My head spun. My thighs kept twitching apart, my body twisting as heat rose higher and higher. Still, I managed to keep control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least until he suddenly bent down and took my n!pp2l.e into his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah—hngh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His tongue circled it gently at first, then his lips closed around the swollen tip, sucking, biting softly. He licked over the faintly pink areola, then sucked again, harder this time. He was greedy, like a baby drinking milk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While his mouth worked one side, his free hand grabbed the other, kneading it roughly, expertly, like dough that needed to be worked. My breathing turned shallow, breaking apart into uneven gasps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh… Deputy… Ki…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only the sound of my breath and the obscene noise of his mouth filled my ears. My arms gave out behind me, and I sank back, lying half-flat against the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But his lips didn’t stop. He followed me down, still attached to my br2.s!, sucking hungrily like he couldn’t get enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Deputy Ki…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said his name, his mouth left my skin and came up to find my lips. The gentle kisses from before were gone. His tongue plunged deep, sliding and twisting with mine, wet and unrestrained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He leaned closer, pressing his chest against mine. When I wrapped my arms around his neck and pulled him in, his much larger body came easily, covering me completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was kissing always this dizzying? The more I did it, the hotter I got.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through half-lidded eyes, I saw him utterly lost in the kiss. Then, just for a second, our gazes met. Startled, Deputy Ki pulled back as if waking from a trance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why…? I like it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My voice came out hazy. He covered his wet mouth with one hand, looking almost dazed, his ears and temples flushed a soft pink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">God, he looked hot. The kind of hot that made you want to grab and bite. The next words slipped out before I could stop them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you… want me to suck you?”</span></p>
