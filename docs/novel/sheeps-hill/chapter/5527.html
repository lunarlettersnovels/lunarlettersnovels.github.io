            <p><b>Chapter 2.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked down the long gray corridor, passing several doors that could only be opened with a key. Deputy Ki didn’t say a single word the entire way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced back at the man walking just a step behind me. His presence alone was heavy, oppressive. Just having him beside me made it hard to breathe. Maybe he was born to be a guard, I thought, quickening my pace into a hurried trot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After about five minutes, we finally stopped in front of a door marked </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Infirmary.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Deputy Ki knocked twice, then pushed it open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Deputy Ki!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman in a white coat lit up the moment she saw us—no, saw him. A flush of color bloomed on her cheeks, out of place in a place this barren.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you enjoy your vacation, Deputy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. This is inmate 7059. She’s got abrasions on her solar plexus and abdomen. Please take a look.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike the woman’s warm greeting, Deputy Ki spoke only what was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes turned toward me. Round glasses, round eyes, a round face—she was soft and round all over, without a single sharp edge. I quickly furrowed my brow, putting on a show of pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think it’s just abrasions. My bones hurt… at night I groan so much I can’t even sleep…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I whined as much as I could. The woman’s expression grew serious, and she gestured toward the cot against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It might be a rib injury. Why don’t you lie down over there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like an obedient student, I clutched my side and climbed onto the cot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lay down straight and stared up at the white ceiling, its paint flaking in patches. Maybe the room was only a few pyeong. A single medicine cabinet with a lock, one metal desk, one cot. Calling this place an infirmary felt almost embarrassing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from the kerosene stove, it might as well have been another cell. Oh, and there was a faint scent of cosmetics in the air, which was the only thing that marked it different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman who came closer carefully undid the buttons on my prison shirt. Then, as if something had occurred to her, she looked over at Deputy Ki standing by the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Deputy Ki. I need to have her strip and do a brief medical interview…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like that would fly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guards here, men and women alike, didn’t treat prisoners like people. It was no rare thing to feel someone watching through the bars in the door while you changed, or while you used the night bucket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll wait in the corridor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deputy Ki opened the door and stepped out without protest. The woman smiled as if she expected that, almost touched by it. She did not take her eyes off him until the door shut and his back disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only then did she seem to remember me. She hurried to compose her face and unbuttoned the rest of my shirt. Her expression grew serious as she took in the yellow and bluish bruises scattered across my torso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to press on these. Tell me if anything hurts badly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a while she pressed here and there along my ribs. I exaggerated my groans and showed pain on purpose. If a bone was broken they’d send me to hospital, and while I was there I might be able to learn something about the outside world. If I was lucky, I could be admitted for a few weeks of tests and hang on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… judging from the pain around the ribs, a fracture is possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Success. They might at least take an X-ray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll give you some painkillers. One when it hurts, up to three a day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Painkillers? If something’s wrong with my bones, shouldn’t I go to a hospital? Shouldn’t they check it properly?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hospital? Are you having trouble breathing now? It’s not so painful you can’t speak, right? It’s not like your lung is punctured or you’re in that kind of agony, so painkillers should be enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, unless my lung was pierced and I couldn’t make a sound, I would never get sent to a hospital. Take the pills and bear it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A cold dread tightened in my chest. If I stayed in this body and got that sick that I was near death, what then? If she actually died, what would become of me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Half of it was probably an act, so I didn’t think much of it, but a cold clarity hit me all at once. I was in a prison body. Even if I was hurt, there was no way to expect proper treatment or care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said nothing, the woman let out a low sigh as if she’d been thinking something over.</span></p>
