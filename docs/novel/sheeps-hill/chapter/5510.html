            <p><strong>Chapter 10.2</strong></p>
<p>“I told you soliciting a correctional officer leads to solitary confinement.”</p>
<p>Deputy Ki’s curt voice hit my ears. At this rate, I’d lose the cigarettes and get thrown into solitary without gaining anything. I blurted out whatever came to mind in a panic.</p>
<p>“It’s not that, I l-like you!”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I, um, like Deputy Ki-nim… I like you….”</p>
<p>You’re walking into ruin on your own, Kim Geummi. How about biting your tongue right now?</p>
<p>Deputy Ki remained silent, whether he was dumbfounded or wanted to hit me.</p>
<p>As I stealthily tried to gauge the man’s mood, I discovered something. A color that might be the key to survival.</p>
<p>Stammering, clumsy and awkward, but somehow, that made the confession feel strangely sincere.</p>
<p>“…I l-like you. Deputy Ki-nim.”</p>
<p>Under the 30-watt bulb, his already heated earlobes turned even redder. Deputy Ki was blushing at my confession, like a boy in the throes of adolescence.</p>
<p>“W-well, it’s just… my situation is like this…. I- I mean, I deserved to be punished anyway. But still, I wanted to confess this time….”</p>
<p>Even I thought it was the worst, most half-baked confession. The timing was wrong, the mood was off, everything about it was a mess. To the point where any man who believed this would seem a bit out of his mind. Who would fall for this kind of confession that anyone could see was just an excuse?</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>The end of his usually blunt, toneless words rose a bit. When I lifted my head, the man was still rubbing his chin with his ears flushed red.</p>
<p>As if showing my sincerity bare, I nodded. I like you, I said I like you. So just let it slide this time.</p>
<p>I hadn’t really thought about what came after. It was because I thought, what could Deputy Ki even do? Up to that moment, I was really underestimating Deputy Ki.</p>
<p>Probably a novice would be at a loss with a woman’s confession, then put the cigarette bundle back in its place and leave the room a bit dazed.</p>
<p>I’d thought, what could a Baengchungi like Deputy Ki do?</p>
<p>“Then what will you do for me?”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Earlier, you said you’d do something else.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>I was a bit flustered by the man’s unexpected request, but it seemed better this way.</p>
<p>Like Eyes said, I needed a ‘line’ in this prison too. It’d be good to have a countermeasure so I wouldn’t have to desperately gather five packs of cigarettes, get beaten, and agonize like today to get things done. I’ve always lived that way as Kim Geummi, so it wasn’t particularly difficult.</p>
<p>“What would you like me to… do for you…?”</p>
<p>“Not for me.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>Deputy Ki’s low voice flowed out.</p>
<p>“What was it that 7059 wanted to do, not for me.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I….”</p>
<p>Originally, the initial intention was to down on him, but thinking about it, wouldn’t that be too much for Deputy Ki from the start?</p>
<p>If I do something too strong from the beginning, it might spoil him badly, and besides, after shyly confessing just now, if I suddenly go straight to the lower half, it might seem like I’m too calculated.</p>
<p>I lowered my gaze as if embarrassed.</p>
<p>“I… um… want to… kiss.”</p>
<p><em>Pfft.</em> What seemed like a low laugh sounded. Like air escaping, the sound of something deflating from amusement. Thinking I must have misheard, when I raised my eyes, Deputy Ki’s lips were still pressed tight with his ears tinged red.</p>
<p>It must have been wind coming in from some window, I thought, and as I tilted my head back to look, Deputy Ki covered his mouth with his fist and let out a low fake cough. He seemed really shy.</p>
<p>“Then, let’s try it once.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Let’s try it, kissing.”</p>
<p>The mood felt strangely different, but I didn’t have the mind to dwell on it. Thinking it was an opportunity, but oddly, my heart pounded with unease.</p>
<p>The man’s subtle voice continued.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to do it?”</p>
<p>“No, yes, yes. Let’s do it…. Let’s do it, us.”</p>
<p>Us. Seeming to like that word quite a bit, the end of Deputy Ki’s elegant lips subtly rose.</p>
<p>But how was I supposed to start? He’s way too tall. First, pull the man’s face closer….</p>
<p>I extended my hand, clenched it, and did not know what to do. Deputy Ki hesitated, then sat down on the stack of washed blankets.</p>
<p>Like a child called in for scolding, I fidgeted with my clasped hands, then quickly reading Deputy Ki’s intention, I moved closer to him. I slipped between his legs and placed my b*tt on his right thigh. I felt Deputy Ki draw in a sharp breath.</p>
