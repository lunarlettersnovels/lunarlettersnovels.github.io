            <p><strong>Chapter 11.2</strong></p>
<p>Deputy Ki, who’d been strangely curt with his words since earlier, felt unfamiliar. But I had no right to point that out. In the current situation, the power imbalance was clear. To get out of this and for the future, I needed to stay on Deputy Ki’s good side.</p>
<p>Besides, a sudden surge of stubborn pride rose up inside me. It felt like he was mocking me, like ‘is that all you can do?’</p>
<p>“No! Of course not.”</p>
<p>I pulled Deputy Ki’s face back to me. As soon as our lips touched, this time I gently sucked his lower lip. I felt the man’s body flinch. I softly took him in my mouth, tracing his lips with my tongue, until it parted slightly.</p>
<p>Through that opening, I parted his lips with my tongue and pushed mine in. My tongue tangled with his soft, supple one.</p>
<p>Even in this situation, maybe humans really are creatures of instinct. A thrill ran through me, and tugged at my lower belly. The touching of our tongues felt warm and good.</p>
<p>“Uhn, mm….”</p>
<p>As I let out a low m0@.n, I felt the man’s breath suddenly quicken. The hesitant Deputy Ki started actively pressing his lips to mine. His body tilted toward me.</p>
<p>A wet, sloppy sound echoed through the room.</p>
<p>It was just a single, intimate touch. It wasn’t my first time kissing a guy, so I thought it’d be an unremarkable kiss.</p>
<p>The sucking, sweeping, rubbing, pushing of his tongue made the back of my neck tingle thrillingly. The man, Deputy Ki, wrapped his tongue around mine clumsily yet skillfully.</p>
<p>“Ha… eut.”</p>
<p>A m0@n involuntarily escaped from my throat. My senses heated up as if plunged into a pit of fire. Ah, euh…. Unintended m0@.ns were sucked into Deputy Ki’s mouth the moment they escaped.</p>
<p>“Haa!”</p>
<p>As if responding to my m0@.n, Deputy Ki turned his head.</p>
<p>Opening wide, as if he wouldn’t be satisfied until he licked all the way to the root of my tongue, he pushed his own deep inside. It felt like I was being devoured. There was something relentless and obsessive about it.</p>
<p>I’d been holding his face, in control of this kiss, but before I knew it, I was gripping his forearm, receiving Deputy Ki’s lips pouring as they rained down like cannon fires. If not for the firm hand supporting my waist, my body would’ve fallen back.</p>
<p>“Euh, wait—”</p>
<p>Our lips, briefly parted to catch our breath, quickly rejoined. It was a ferocious, savage kiss, as if trying to swallow even my exhales whole. I couldn’t come to my senses at all.</p>
<p>The large hand that had been quietly fisted on his thigh gripped my br3.@st hard. Like kneading rice cake dough, he squeezed a handful tightly.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>Deputy Ki, who had strongly sucked my tongue, slowly pulled his lips away. The heaving wet breaths spread low through the space filled with piles of cloth.</p>
<p>Deputy Ki’s lips facing me were dyed bright red from all the sucking and clashing, like they couldn’t get any redder.</p>
<p>My heart pounded hard. S3.xu!l excitement, the thrill from stimulation, sent a jolt from deep in my core. I’d never felt anything like this before.</p>
<p>When I lowered my eyes, the fabric over his left thigh pant hem was pulled taut. Something long and branch-like had hardened into a firm shape.</p>
<p>I swallowed hard.</p>
<p>After steadying my breath, I lowered my gaze a little more, and a large hand was still resting over the chest of the inmate uniform with the number 7059. Gripping it tightly as if claiming ownership.</p>
<p>Because it was a bare chest without a bra, the protruding n.pp!e was pressed firmly into his palm.</p>
<p>Deputy Ki hurriedly pulled his hand away and awkwardly turned his head to the side. His ears were bright red like a ripe apple.</p>
<p>The moment I saw that, a certain premonition hit me.</p>
<p>I reached out and stroked that deep crimson color. As I gently rubbed his earlobe, I felt the man’s broad shoulders tense up beneath my touch.</p>
<p>I turned the man’s face, which I could look at forever without getting tired of, back to me. Then I whispered intimately and suggestively.</p>
<p>“I really like you, Deputy Ki-nim.”</p>
<p>Deputy Ki looked at me, as if entranced again.</p>
<p>“I like you… so much.”</p>
<p>What can you do for me? What can I get from you?</p>
<p>His handsome face, his amazing scent… Just seeing and smelling him wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“Ah, gently….”</p>
<p>His hand kneading my chest was rough and when I let out a small sound of protest, his grip immediately loosened. Even his manners were desirable.</p>
<p>The Baengchungi Deputy Ki, this novice who doesn’t know what to do and gets worked up over a single kiss.</p>
<p>Feeling my breath quicken again, I confirmed the premonition I just had.</p>
<p>In this boring, suffocating prison, Deputy Ki would be an excellent alternative.</p>
<p>It was a quite satisfying and excellent snack, something to moderately enjoy, use, and discard.</p>
<p>As expected, there’s no law saying you have to die.</p>
