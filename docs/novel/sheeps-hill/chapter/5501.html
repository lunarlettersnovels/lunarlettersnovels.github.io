            <p><b>Chapter 15.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deputy Ki’s face flushed as red as a ripe persimmon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Funny, really. If it had been anyone else—any other man or woman—acting this shy, I’d have called them fake. But with him, the thought didn’t even come. The way his cheeks bloomed with color was… beautiful, actually. The word didn’t fit the moment, but there it was; he looked almost bashful, like a new bride on her wedding night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was this what it felt like to undress your wife for the first time? The thought made me laugh quietly to myself, like some worldly groom amused by his young, blushing bride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to see yours, Deputy Ki. Can I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He hesitated. Whether it was because he was shy or because of that ironclad sense of duty, I couldn’t tell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that he was… small? No way. I’d seen the shape under his pants last time. It didn’t look small at all! Did I imagine it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I really wanted to know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Deputy Kii…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I whined softly, he licked his lips, hesitated for a moment longer, then finally placed his hands on his belt. Even then, he made me wait, fidgeting like he was still debating it. I brushed my fingers lightly over his thigh to push him along, and at last, he unbuckled it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he pulled the zipper down, the bulge beneath his underwear sprang upward, straining against the fabric. His veined hand slipped under the waistband of the black briefs and pulled himself free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…W-whoa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t even a word, just a sound of pure shock and awe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t believe how he’d even managed to keep that thing inside his pants all this time. Can something like that exist on a human being…? You saw things like this on nature shows, attached to stallions or bulls. Maybe that’s where I’d seen one before. Was this my memory or Ham Yeohee’s?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just stared, speechless. Maybe he mistook my silence for disgust, because he spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Does it look strange?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no, that’s not it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It really wasn’t fair. Why had God decided to give one man everything? Even that part of him was a work of art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His er2ct!0n, proud and commanding, was extraordinary in color. A smooth, pink pillar curved slightly, the rounded head at the tip a deeper shade of red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight of it glistening and pulsing with clear fluid was almost too elegant for a man’s body. Thick and long, powerful enough to be compared to a weapon, yet its shape and color were so harmonious, almost artistic. It made me want to take it into my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My body leaned forward instinctively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Hmph!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mouth filled as I took in the tip of that heated length. It was already overwhelming, but when I heard the man’s low, restrained m0.@n above me, that intensity felt like nothing at all. I brushed my tongue over the small slit at the top, where clear fluid welled up, and Deputy Ki leaned back, head tilted as he caught his breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His m0.@n was strangely beautiful. Sound has no shape, yet every time Deputy Ki let out that quiet, trembling breath, it seemed to ripple through my whole body. My lower abdomen tightened, and my legs tensed without reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I got carried away. I tried to take too much, too quickly, and had to pull back with a gasp. The tip of his length hit the back of my throat, making me cough helplessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cough—cough—ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you all right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my body pitched forward from the coughing, his hand slipped beneath my arm, lifting me up by the shoulder. Even then, the spasms wouldn’t stop, and my eyes watered with tears I couldn’t control. What a ridiculous time for this to happen. Embarrassing didn’t even begin to cover it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re such a fool,” he muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyes widened. A fool? After what I’d just done? But when I looked up, his expression hadn’t changed—still calm, still controlled—yet something in his gaze had softened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was warmth there. Unexpected and quiet, like a flicker of fire trapped under a sheet of ice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He reached out and gently brushed the tears from the corners of my eyes, his voice low and steady as he said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re so clumsy.”</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He spoke as if he was satisfied with my clumsiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the hard, cold infirmary bed, one person sat crying, and the other sat with his length exposed. What a strange scene, wasn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I was dazed, looking at it all as if from outside myself, and then suddenly I came back to my senses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to. I can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brushed away the man’s hand, still tracing the wetness around my eyes, and bent down again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt even larger than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I wrapped my fingers around it. I flicked out my tongue, giving light licks along the shaft, and he let out a low groan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I had the rhythm, I slowly took the tip into my mouth. I couldn’t possibly take it all anyway, and he was so sensitive that even the smallest touch made him react, so I decided not to be greedy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha… ugh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using the pressure of my mouth, I drew at the tip, licking and sucking as my hand moved up and down the smooth length. When I lifted my eyes, Deputy Ki was staring down at me, his brows drawn tight. The faint glow in his eyes had turned into something that burned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without looking away, I kept moving my lips and tongue. Strangely, there was nothing degrading about it. It didn’t disgust me or make me feel small. If anything, it made my body tremble with excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The more I moved, the harder he became. The sight of Deputy Ki’s face, his eyes dimmed and hazy with pleasure, only made me want more. Whatever it was about him: his scent, his warmth, the way his skin felt—it clung to me like something I couldn’t shake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha… ah…”</span></p>
