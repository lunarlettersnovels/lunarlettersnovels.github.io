            <p><b>Chapter 5.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After three days of only catching sunlight through the bars, I vowed never to openly break the rules anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also decided not to hope for luck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It started with something bizarre enough to belong in the horror corner of a third-rate magazine, and being possessed in the body of a woman locked in prison—out of all the bodies—felt like I’d already run out of whatever luck I had left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three days after I put in my request to Eyes, a response came from Choksae.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Entertainment News, November Issue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> has a Geummi feature. Three packs of cigarettes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before heading to the workshop, Eyes whispered this, and I nodded solemnly. After hearing we’d exchange the cigarettes and magazine at a designated spot, I felt, for the first time in a long while, like I could breathe again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For two months, I had been trapped in the body of an unknown woman and living as an inmate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how certain I was of my sanity, there were moments when I doubted if I really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> crazy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is all completely absurd. What if I’m truly insane? What if, like Wangnyeo or Yera said, something in me has snapped?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I clearly remembered my life as Geummi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My birthday, where I was born, the sh*tty memories of childhood, the twists and turns before my debut, the exhilarating moments on stage, the taste of my favorite foods, perfumes, even the men I’d slept with… I remembered it all. That </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">had</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until now, I’d felt like I was drifting on a vast ocean in a tiny boat, not knowing how to steer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now, I finally found a clue. It felt like I’d secured a meaningful lifeline connecting two disparate worlds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, you’re Geummi. Kim Geummi, the scrappy fighter from Ssangmi-dong, Yongcheon-gu. Don’t forget how you got to where you were. So, I can find a way out of this damned situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I steeled myself, as if brainwashing my own mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had set foot on the mountain; now I just had to climb over it. Sure, another mountain probably waited ahead, but with three packs of cigarettes, I figured I could clear the first peak without trouble. But the problem, as expected, stood waiting for me at a distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No commissary money? What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I clung to the iron bars, questioning Chief Park, who was handling commissary purchases. He checked the ledger and replied, sounding annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s none, so there’s none. Look here, No. 7059, commissary balance: zero won.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The handwritten ledger clearly showed my inmate number with a blank amount next to it. I couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why zero? I’ve been locked up for two years. How can there not be a single won?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How should I know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t his problem, so Chief Park’s response was indifferent. But for me, this wasn’t something I could brush off with an “Okay, I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did they miss something when I was transferred? There’s no way my family or friends—someone—haven’t deposited a single won all this time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How would I know? No. 5983, come out and get your requested items.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yera pushed me aside from the bars and took her items through the slot. I quickly grabbed the bars again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about the workshop? Nothing from my labor either?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Going to the workshop for over eight hours a day, morning and afternoon, earned a small amount. But it varied slightly depending on the workshop. Inmates without family or friends to send money relied on that to buy necessities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d diligently gone to the workshop after facing reality head-on. I couldn’t believe there wasn’t even a penny. My grip on the bars tightened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re lying, right? I’ve been working for two months! How can there not be a single won? Something’s wrong…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d expected the commissary to be low, sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inmates with no money had to make do with the bare minimum supplies provided by the state. Ham Yeohee’s belongings were not just modest, they were shabby and pitiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While other inmates bought laceless white sneakers with their commissary, Yeohee still wore white rubber shoes. She couldn’t even afford a bra, which had to be purchased, so she went around bare-chested. Still, I never imagined it would be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">zero</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s written by Hands, isn’t it? What if my money went somewhere? You can at least check, can’t you? Please?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Eyes, such things happened all the time. Pocketing a bit of commissary money and not recording it was easy enough, and no one would bat an eye. In a prison where guards practically ruled as kings, what could a convict possibly say?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I was desperate. The amount enough to buy three packs of cigarettes—no, even just one—should have been recorded in that ledger. To me, it was no different from another word for hope. I was desperate. I was clinging.</span></p>
