            <p><b>Chapter 15.2</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I drew him in with a strong pull, he tilted his head back, a breath escaping him. The veins along his length stood out, and the swollen tip throbbed like it was about to burst. I could tell he was close. I was about to move again when—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S… stop—!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deputy Ki pulled me away and stood. Gripping himself with a commanding hand, he looked down at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d seen that kind of gaze before, ever since I woke up in this prison… but this was different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the other guards looked at me, it was with contempt, the way you’d look at something worthless. But his gaze was the look of an owner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The look of someone taking what belonged to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Haa… ngh…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deputy Ki let out a short groan, his brows tightening as he released himself. Thick streams of white spilled over my bare chest, warm against my skin as he kept his eyes fixed on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scent of night flowers filled the air as the hot liquid spread across my chest. Did he always release this much? From the flushed tip, more of that white fluid kept spurting out again and again. Just when it seemed over, another pulse followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe there was something intoxicating in it, because even though I hadn’t climaxed, a hazy daze washed over me. I simply let it happen, letting his fluids coat me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he had released everything, his face changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked startled, almost flustered, staring at the mess he’d made before his face turned completely red. Pulling a handkerchief from his back pocket, he began to gently wipe my chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He murmured softly as he carefully wiped away every trace of what had dripped down the curves of my breasts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When his hand accidentally brushed my n.p1p!e, a sharp tremor ran up my spine. At my quiet gasp, he bit his lower lip and wore the face of a monk enduring fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sliding his hand under my arm, Deputy Ki helped me sit up and pulled the prison uniform back over my shoulders. Then, starting from the bottom, he began fastening each button, one by one, all the way to the top. I caught his hand before he could finish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Deputy Ki.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When our eyes met, a thought flashed through my mind. Something that had crossed me often when I leaned against the wall before evening roll call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I’d grown attached to this body after living in it for so long, but I often found myself pitying Ham Yeohee. Not for what she’d done, but because this face, this body, seemed far too beautiful to rot away in a prison cell for seven years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now, looking at Deputy Ki, I felt the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His smooth forehead, straight nose, the way his brows and eyes looked like they’d been drawn by hand, the lines and color of his lips, and that sharply cut jaw… his features had a rare, deliberate beauty, like a piece of art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deputy Ki was beautiful. He looked like a sculpture a devoted artist might spend a lifetime crafting to offer to God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why it felt like such a waste, being trapped in this bleak prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if Yeohee was here by force and Deputy Ki by choice, both were spending their youth in a place that didn’t deserve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe that’s why my chest felt strangely warm. Or maybe it was just the languid calm that came after something intense. I gently held his chin and made him look at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you like it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scent of his body still lingered on my skin, thick and intimate. But it didn’t make me feel dirty. If anything, it felt comforting. With his mark all over me like this, I knew Deputy Ki wouldn’t pretend not to know me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked down at me with a quiet, searching gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something inside me trembled. Just as my eyes began to waver, his low voice spread through the air, echoing close to my ear like it came from deep within a cave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you really… like me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do I like him? Of course I do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pressed my face against his chest and wrapped my arms around him. His heartbeat thudded hard against my ear. I rubbed my cheek against his firm chest and answered without a hint of hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I like you, Deputy Ki. I like you so, so much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He wasn’t a man who showed much on his face. Even when he came, the most he did was furrow his brow slightly. He didn’t seem like someone whose emotions ever showed easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even so, he was human. His heart didn’t lie. When I said I liked him, it suddenly began to race, pounding like a runner’s, and the more I nuzzled into him, the faster it beat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Encouraged by that, I lifted my head and asked softly,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Deputy Ki… it’s okay if I keep liking you, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A little fear lingered in me. Maybe this stubborn man would still choose his sense of duty over desire, maybe he’d step back again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deputy Ki looked down at me, his eyes dark and unreadable. I couldn’t tell what was inside them, they were so deep, like an endless abyss. Then he cupped my face in his hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you,” he said quietly. “You can like me all you want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His lips brushed against my forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re sure you won’t regret it later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if that could ever be true. What scared me more was imagining myself letting go of this lifeline called Deputy Ki and living to regret it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strangely, I’d never felt the urge to throw myself at Chief Park or any of the other guards like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe my standards were just high. That’s what I told myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t regret it. Liking you, Deputy Ki.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I burrowed back into his arms, his strong arms wrapped around me tightly. The same arms that once stayed motionless when I cried and begged to be held now pulled me close with firm, steady warmth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside, I was cheering. I’d finally grabbed hold of something real—my rope, my way to survive this place. I was happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Never realizing that the warmth I clung to was, in truth, a trap.</span></p>
