            <p><strong>Chapter 11.1</strong></p>
<p>As I’d felt before, sitting this close to Deputy Ki made me realize he was an incredibly large man.</p>
<p>His broad shoulders where his shirt clung flat, the solid chest—I’d seen those plenty, but the thigh I was sitting my butt on was hard without a single soft spot. Even without seeing it, I could picture his naked body packed tight with muscles.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>It wasn’t even my first time kissing a man, but I was more nervous than I should’ve been. Since I was the one who suggested it, I needed to hurry up and kiss him and wrap up tonight’s business, but somehow my body wouldn’t move.</p>
<p>Now that I’m sitting this close, the scent from Deputy Ki feels even more intense. Staring at his wrinkle-free chest made my mouth dry.</p>
<p>Interpreting my silence somehow, he let out a short “Ah” and took off his cap. He raised his large hand, veins carved like sculpture, and swept back his disheveled hair.</p>
<p>“Wow….”</p>
<p>The untimely admiration spilled from my mouth. Everything I’d done since entering this storage room had been idiotic, but this couldn’t be helped. Deputy Ki’s face without his cap made me that way.</p>
<p>His forehead that had always been hidden, the shape of his eyes that were always shadowed and hard to make out properly. Each detail held my gaze.</p>
<p>The long horizontal eyes without double eyelids, the straight nose bridge, the lips shaped like they were drawn… Each feature was striking, yet harmoniously balanced. The clean skin without a single trace of a scruffy beard and his red lips felt strangely provocative. Even under this dull lighting, the man had a startlingly bright face.</p>
<p>So that’s why he wears the cap so low. It was a face that was a waste to be hidden. Too good to be seen in a place like this.</p>
<p>Starting from his forehead to his eyes, nose, and lips, then pulled back to take in the whole face at once, I lost myself for a moment.</p>
<p>“…Is there something on my face?”</p>
<p>“Uh, no. It’s just… you’re really handsome, Deputy Ki-nim.”</p>
<p>At the compliment, the man’s ears turned red again.</p>
<p>A shy handsome man.</p>
<p>The women from other cells who were desperate to bare their chests in front of Deputy Ki, or Yera—I understood them fully in this moment. Before I knew it, the words slipped out.</p>
<p>“Have you ever shown this face to anyone?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>This was an emotion even I couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Unlike me, he was a free man. He could wear or remove his cap as he pleased, and outside, he probably walked around with this handsome face.</p>
<p>That obvious premise suddenly irritated me. It was a weird possessiveness. That face should be only for me, that face should only look at me. These ridiculous thoughts stirred in my head.</p>
<p>What am I to Deputy Ki anyway. We’d only just gotten to me sitting on his thigh.</p>
<p>“…Deputy Ki-nim is totally my type. Do you know that?”</p>
<p>When I said it, the man’s ears and nape turned bright red. That color really pleased me.</p>
<p>The Deputy Ki right in front of me had this unripe allure that made you want to take a bite of. Unlike his fully ripened body, he still carried a trace of greenness.</p>
<p>How old could he be? Mid-twenties? Had he even dated a woman? With a face like that, you’d think he was experienced, but from his attitude, he seemed like a total v!r.g*n. If I told a guy like this I’d go down on him, he’d probably faint on the spot.</p>
<p>“Aren’t… you going to do it?”</p>
<p>His cautiously thrown question made my heart flutter. It was a palpitation quite different from before. This was the first time I’m seeing Deputy Ki’s face this close. I saw Ham Yeohee reflected in his deep brown pupils.</p>
<p>You have to understand this, Ham Yeohee. You and I both got screwed over, but anyway, I’m the one losing out more, right? Be grateful it’s not Chief Park.</p>
<p>I slowly reached out and cupped Deputy Ki’s face. The man’s cheek in my palm was cold and firm like winter.</p>
<p>Our lips met, dry and bare. Unlike my rough and chapped lips, Deputy Ki’s were soft and supple. A subtle scent of skin brushed past my nose.</p>
<p>We stayed like that for a while, lips pressed firmly together, then I pulled away. Deputy Ki’s hazy gaze clung to my lips as if entranced.</p>
<p>This bastard, despite how he looks, has he never even kissed a girl? To be this dazed over just that—</p>
<p>“Is that it?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Is that all you can do?”</p>
