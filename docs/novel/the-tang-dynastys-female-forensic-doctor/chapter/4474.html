            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 90 – Liu Luo</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ran Yan arrived at the front hall, the sutras has already begun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The front hall of the Yingmei Nunnery was not large. There were only about seventy people in the entire nunnery. The mountain was covered in mist, and a group of women dressed in black sat cross-legged in the courtyard of the front hall. They were carefully listening to the scriptures. The scene was quite peaceful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nun was still as old as ever. She closed her eyes and twirled the Buddhist beads as she preached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan did not disturb the crowd. Instead, she found a zabuton in one corner and sat down. As if she felt Ran Yan coming, the nun nodded in her direction from afar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan was slightly surprised. She felt that although the master had not opened her eyes, she seemed to be able to see her, so she also bowed to the master. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nun’s aged voice spat out obscure words. Ran Yan listened to the sutras and did not have a clue of what was being chanted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sutras were not easy to understand. Ordinary people could know the literal meaning through some simple translation, but those words that contained great wisdom needed to be understood. Ran Yan was not interested in comprehending the scriptures. There were even some words from the Buddhist family that seemed to be extremely unreasonable and unfounded to her. However, the sound of chanting was able to calm her heart, which was why she came here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xing Niang sat next to Ran Yan, listening very seriously. Suddenly, she felt as if someone has been spying on her. She was stunned for a moment and immediately turned her head. She saw a little nun, who quickly retracted her gaze. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan was aware of this, but she quietly listened to the master’s hoarse voice. As she listened to her chanting sutras, she suddenly remembered the bells she had heard this morning and the monk’s chants. She thought to herself, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could there be a temple nearby? </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the nunnery’s master was getting older, she couldn’t afford to be too weary. Therefore, the time for the sermon was reduced from the previous two hours to three minutes. Occasionally, she would be in good spirits and do it for a longer period. She had already spoken for a while when Ran Yan arrived, so it was not long before it was over. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nuns stood up and bowed to the master. After the master left, everyone dispersed and did their things. Many of the nuns who has never seen Ran Yan were attracted by her appearance and stopped for a few more glances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss, just now, a little nun has been staring at you. This old servant recognized that this little nun was the one who went to deliver the food a few times. She looked around the courtyard a few times. Did she want something from you?” Xing Niang whispered to Ran Yan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little nun was just a peep. Ran Yan felt that her recent reputation was not good, and it was normal for many people to be curious or disgusted. However, she did not let her guard down and said to Xing Niang, “Watch her carefully.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan and Xing Niang were just about to walk toward the back of the nunnery when they heard a slight commotion. They heard a female saying in a low voice, “A pilgrim is here! Get ready!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan smiled. Yingmei Nunnery was reduced to this. Making a fuss over a pilgrim. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them turned around and walked a short distance. Before they could walk around the main hall, they heard a sweet and slick voice, “Seventeenth Miss Ran?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voice was near the stairs in front of the hall. Ran Yan looked up and saw a beautiful woman in a bean-green light gauze dress standing like a lotus branch. However, her beauty was quite vulgar. Her temperament was between a young lady and a little lass, and she could not touch the lotus leaves or the like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan only felt that this woman was familiar, but she couldn’t remember where she had seen her before. She couldn’t help but ask, “Forgive me, this Miss is ……” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman smiled politely at the little nun beside her and said, “I’ve met an old friend. Let me talk with her for now. I’ll have to ask little sister to come later.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little nun bowed and said, “As you please.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went to the hall first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman watched the little nun go farther before she smiled charmingly at Ran Yan and said, “Miss Seventeen is forgetful. Normally, you can’t remember this concubine. My name is Liu Luo. I’m here today just to spread the word.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liu Luo’s smile revealed a bit of wind and dust. Ran Yan immediately remembered that she was the one who was feeding the fish in the Caixiu House that day, so she said, “Miss Liu Luo, please speak.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, I was sent to thank Miss. Miss is cultivating in a nunnery. If others heard that Miss has something to do with our family, it would be detrimental to Miss’ reputation. Therefore, I didn’t need to bring my sisters to personally thank you.” As Liu Luo spoke, she walked down the stairs and moved seductively towards Ran Yan. Standing close to her, she leaned over and said softly, “In addition, there is someone who wants to ask for Miss’ help.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xing Niang lightly frowned. She thought to herself that her Miss was in danger. Now that she had saved her life, wouldn’t it be a complete mess! However, even though she was displeased, she still held back her silence and only lowered her eyes to listen to Liu Luo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This person has been locked up in a dark hut, eating and drinking with Lazarus. Some maids watched over this person day and night, apparently mute. To hide their knowledge, they did not even dare to read books. The only thing they could do every day was to look at the small sky above their head…” Liu Luo said. She could not help but shiver. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could this person live their life?! </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan’s brows gradually knitted. Xing Niang finally couldn’t help but say, “Miss, I’m afraid that you’ll have to go to the magistrate for such concern. Our Miss only knows some medical skills. After she examined the two corpses, Miss couldn’t do such a thing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you want to save them or not is just a matter of raising your hand. I’m just kind enough to spread the word.” Liu Luo took out a piece of paper from her sleeve and stuffed it into Ran Yan’s hand. “This is the address. I don’t care about anything else.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan looked at the paper and asked, “Did that person not say their identity?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was said that time was tight and doesn’t have the time to say it.” Liu Luo sighed and bowed slightly towards Ran Yan. “Since the words have already been relayed, Liu Luo will excuse herself.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you.” Ran Yan clenched the paper in her hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, Xing Niang also came back to her senses, but she didn’t think about it for a moment and asked suspiciously, “Does Miss know who it is? Are you planning to save them?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go back and talk.” Ran Yan said calmly, as she suppressed the ups and downs of her heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xing Niang nodded and went with Ran Yan to go to their temporary courtyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Lu and Xiao Man set up a few small shops in the corridor. The two of them looked like cats, one with a puffed cheek and one with a frown, staring at the thick book in front of them. One said bitterly, “Sister Wan Lu, what is this word?!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Lu turned her head and looked at it for a while. “That means wolfberry!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sister Wan Lu is amazing.” Xiao Man sighed in admiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Lu rolled her eyes. “Don’t you understand?” she asked. “The picture is a wolfberry.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she heard this, Xing Niang burst out laughing. She walked over and took a look at the book. As expected, it was wolfberry. “You’re a smart person. Yet you refuse to use your skills!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan has no intention of paying attention to their conversation. The rumors in the city were only about her medical skills and post-mortem examinations. If someone came to ask her to do a post-mortem for medical treatment, it was understandable. What kind of captive would be looking for her? This was absurd! Unless… This person has significant importance to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan tightly scrunched the note in her hand. The waves in her heart were hard to placate. Could this person be Ge Lan? Apart from Ge Lan, Ran Yan could not think of anyone else for a while. Moreover, she did not see Ge Lan die with her own eyes in her dream. Could it be that she was lucky enough to survive? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these speculations, Ran Yan’s heart felt a little complicated. She was not good at disguising herself. If it was Ge Lan, a smart woman like her would have seen through her at a glance! What would she face at that time? Whether Ge Lan would accept it or not, the woman she had always protected already contained a different soul. </span></p>
