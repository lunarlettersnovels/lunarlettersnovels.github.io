        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Wonderful Flower</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After standing quietly for a long time, Su Fu slightly turned to stare at her, gaze perceptive. He then threw the cup of water near the door. After watching it land steadily, he reached out his hand and began to undress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan looked at the ambiance outside. The moon was akin to water; the degree of visibility was good. Although she wanted to check his body in broad daylight, it was already good that Su Fu was fulfilling his promise. If he were angered by too many requests, things would not end accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark gray robe slid down with the motion of his hands. It hung on the cockscomb flower behind him and snaked down to the ground. Su Fu’s shirt had already been unbuttoned. With his shirt spread out, it revealed his muscular chest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan had seen his chest more than once. In the carriage and the bamboo hut in the courtyard last night, she had glanced at it in a hurry. This time, he was only a short distance away from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has thick shoulders, and his neck and throat were clearly defined. His blood vessels, near his collarbone, were partially raised. His skin was fair and stunning, and it projected an explosive appeal. His chiseled chest was fairly raised, prominent yet not exaggerated. Due to his white skin, the two fruits on his chest were particularly tender and red. Under the moonlight, she almost mistook it as somewhat transparent. The distinct muscles on his abdomen were not like the kind of ‘stones’ that were specially trained. Instead, they appeared tamed yet concealed such monstrous strength. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan’s unbridled gaze caused the muscles on Su Fu’s two sturdy arms to jerk slightly, and the veins on his neck also started to throb, as if he was trying his best to endure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you want to continue?” Su Fu’s voice was cold and oppressive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan was about to nod when she heard him say, “It’s alright to proceed. However… After you observe, you have two options: Be my woman or die.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a pause, he added, “Of course, you can choose not to look.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, Ran Yan was in a bit of a dilemma. To look at this exquisite specimen, she could either give away the rest of her life or give up her life. No matter how she looked at it, it was not an ideal plan. Even though this man in front of her was indeed a rare perfection in this world, he lived a life of licking the blood off of the knife’s edge… Ran Yan frowned and said, “You’re a liar.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You only need to see it. You didn’t forbid me to ask,” Su Fu spoke indifferently and put on his clothes. “Let’s talk after you’ve thought it through.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan snorted. In any case, she never thought that she would be able to look at Su Fu like a corpse lying on the autopsy table, so she didn’t take it seriously at first. Now, this result was not much of a disappointment. However, what made her laugh was that Su Fu appeared to be a chaste and fierce man. She looked at his body and he wanted her to take responsibility. For an ancient man… He was a peculiar flower. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll go back first.” Ran Yan calmly walked over to pick up her kit. When she reached the bamboo door, she heard a cold voice behind her. “Are you hungry?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan stopped and turned around to look at him. The corners of her lips curved slightly as she said in a cold voice, “I’ve suffered so much for such minimum gain. If you invite me to dinner, I’ll feel hungry even if I don’t.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu nodded and walked to the bamboo cage on the side of the house. He reached out and grabbed a chicken. A cold light flashed in his hand, but he abruptly stopped and turned to look at Ran Yan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan tilted her head and looked at the cage. There were chickens, ducks, and geese inside. She said, “Chicken.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the knife wiped the necks of two chickens without hesitation. Strangely, it did not spill any blood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu quickly lit up a fire outside the courtyard. He went to the side of the stream to clean up the poultries he killed. This was what he was best at. Ran Yan watched as he quickly raised his knife and saw that it was clean and sharp. Curious, she stood up and squatted by the shore to watch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at his sculpture-like face, Ran Yan suddenly felt that he might not be as impersonal as he seemed on the surface. He was just like her. With his long-term career, he gradually forgot how to change his expression. Ever since she was born again, she has been idle for a long time before she slowly began to break free of her cold facade. She has spent a long time with her tenth brother, Xing Niang, Wan Lu, and that cheap master. She smiled much more than before and no longer dreamed of her previous life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After two short encounters, Su Fu gave Ran Yan the feeling that his front was cold and serious. In reality, he was just more powerful than an ordinary person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can you teach me martial arts?” Ran Yan suddenly asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu cleaned the two chickens and did not even look at her. He stood up and walked towards the fire. He coldly replied, “I only know how to kill people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since he was thirteen, he only knew how to annihilate people. All his martial arts skills were to end people’s lives with a single move. If he encountered a powerful enemy, they would all be like burning stones.[mfn]They’ll die before him[/mfn] He had very few self-preservation moves. His goal was to exterminate people, no matter what method or price it may be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then teach me to kill,” Ran Yan said. If she was forced into a desperate situation, killing someone was an excellent survival method. She would not necessarily use it in her life, but learning one or two moves was better than not being prepared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu sat beside the fire with two chickens strung on his stand. He narrowed his eyes and added seasoning on the chickens. His thin lips pursed slightly. After a period of silence, he slowly said, “All right.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan received his answer before she sat opposite him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was already the end of Summer. Even though it was still hot during the day, there were still hints of the cold breeze at nighttime. Now, it was most likely the time when the night was cold. Su Fu took off his robe and handed it to Ran Yan over the firepit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan did not refuse. “Thank you.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere was peaceful and harmonious. Ran Yan added firewood to the side while Su Fu occasionally flipped the poultries. The fragrance came out in no time. Ran Yan knew that she would have to wait a while before she asked, “Can we discuss something?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu nodded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan was in the mood to break the ice. In any case, she already knew his identity and had seen him slay someone by coincidence. This matter was enough to get her killed, so there was no longer danger in knowing more. “Why did you kill those officials?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu raised his head and glanced at Ran Yan. He thought that she would ask why he had taken the path of an assassin, but it was clear that he underestimated the acuity of this woman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of silence, Su Fu replied, “Not only officials, there are also others. It’s just that the court officials can be more ruthless unless they exclude themselves from worldly pleasures.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So you’re an assassin?” Ran Yan asked while holding firewood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Half. I can accept any employer’s demands, but I have personal work.” Su Fu added quickly, “I can get out this time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan did not know what he meant by those words. She was not too surprised that they could talk about such a classified topic in their short time of being acquainted. Their auras were too similar to each other. It was as if they had suddenly met their kind in a vast sea of people. That kind of surprise, peace of mind, and trust could only be understood through experience. Even a cautious person like them could open their hearts to a certain extent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can’t you just borrow a corpse and resurrect a soul?” Ran Yan bent her leg and rested her chin on her knee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu was slightly startled, “Borrow a corpse to resurrect a soul?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan looked at his reaction and knew that he wasn’t the same as her. This kind of congenial aura had nothing to do with being reborn or transmigrating. </span></p>
