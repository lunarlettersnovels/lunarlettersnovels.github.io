            <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Mysterious Coroner</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu was a little embarrassed by Ran Yan’s gaze. Fortunately, he has always been clear-headed and recovered his composure in an instant. However, he didn’t know how to answer Ran Yan’s request. If he agreed, would he really have to strip off his clothes and let her see his body? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a momentary silence, Ran Yan thought he had rejected her offer, but she heard the cold voice reply, “All right.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan looked at him in surprise. She did not understand Su Fu. He gave people the impression that he was not a man with no self-respect. If he can accept her request, does that mean that the examination of this corpse would be very tricky? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to ask you something. Could Pharmacist Su clear up my confusion?” Ran Yan suddenly thought of something. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu’s long eyebrows slightly furrowed. “What’s the matter?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan still remembered the situation in East City when she was taking shelter under the rain. “Since Pharmacist Su is the future husband of a certain household’s Eldest Miss, would I get into any trouble if you were to show your bare body in front of me like this?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu coldly asked back, “On that day, the manservant did indeed say that I am what you described me so, but so what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan’s heart skipped a beat. Such an obvious question became misleading because of his status as a certain young miss’ “husband”. Should Su Fu be having an affair because a certain madam took a fancy of him? If all the women in Suzhou has taken a fancy of him, would it be his fault? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll go get the tools.” Ran Yan answered decisively and turned back to the courtyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she had intentions of teasing him when she made her request, since the other party had already agreed, Ran Yan could not go back on her words. Not to mention that she was not shameless enough to do such a thing. She could not play with a dangerous person like Su Fu. All she could do was improve their relationship within the limits of not provoking him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan returned to her bedroom and quickly found a simple narrow-sleeved dress to put on. She tied up her hair into a ponytail then put on her toolkit and returned to the forest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu was faster than her. At some point, he had already put on a black robe with a narrow sleeve and round collar. His face was covered in a black scarf, revealing only a pair of cold and quiet eyes. When he looked at people, he was like a leopard waiting for its prey. It was completely different from the cold and casual expression he had emitted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu nodded slightly, “I’ve offended you.” At the same time as the cold voice sounded, his hand was already on Ran Yan’s waist. He pointed a little and rushed out like a goshawk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan could only feel the wind blowing against her ears. The scenery on both sides blurred and rushed back. They rose and fell more than ten times. The surroundings were completely different. There were very few trees on the flat ground, and everywhere she looked were grassy meadows that were waist-high. Occasionally, there were undulating mounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This kind of environment caused Ran Yan to feel a little nervous. She couldn’t help but reflect on how she had done such an impulsive thing. What if after examining the corpse, this Su Fu would immediately kill her to silence her and throw her corpse into the wilderness? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a time of half a cup of tea, Ran Yan saw that there were lights nearby. The lights were rather dense. It was as bright as day, and it was clear that there was no village in the wilderness! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Su Fu was more than a hundred meters away from the fire, he stopped in his tracks and placed Ran Yan down. He took out a mask and handed it to her. “Bring it with you. Don’t talk. Just follow my instructions and do the autopsy. After the examination, write it on the paper they prepared… It is best if you can change your handwriting.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan wore the mask and felt very excited. She usually performed a simple autopsy at the scene, and most of the in-depth examinations were performed on the operating table or in the pathology laboratory. Sometimes, she had no choice but to perform an autopsy in a difficult place, but this was the first time she was to experience such a cryptic autopsy. It was like the Green Forest Vigilante gathered at night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu had prepared his mask to cover his entire head, only leaving his eyes. There was a wide hanging belt behind his back that covered his hair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting ready, Su Fu helped Ran Yan with her tools and led Ran Yan to the fire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only when he was more than ten meters away that Ran Yan could see what was happening next to the fire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four black-clothed men sat beside the source of the fire and were dressed similarly to Su Fu. However, their physiques were slightly different. Near the four men was a pitch-black coffin. In front of it, there were a few incense sticks placed, three blank pieces of paper, and on one side was a brush on the inkstone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four of them seemed to have already noticed their arrival. When they were less than two meters away, they all stood up and bowed to Su Fu. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this the person?” One of the rough-hewn men surveyed Ran Yan and asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan was petite and wore a round-neck, narrow-sleeved shirt. Many men were short and poorly described, so they never doubted Ran Yan’s gender. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, let’s do the autopsy now.” Su Fu said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three of the four turned around to look at the remaining black-clothed man which has a figure similar to Su Fu. The man glanced at Ran Yan indifferently and nodded slightly. The other three rushed forward and removed the lid of the coffin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan received Su Fu’s signal before walking towards the coffin. The first thing she saw was not the corpse, but the fine nanmu coffin. The lid and the wall were all made up of the same material. There was not a trace of connection. Presumably, the bottom of the coffin was the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was unknown who snapped his fingers behind him. There was a sound from the bushes on all sides as more than ten masked men appeared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man who spoke in a rough voice said, “Light the fire.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than ten people responded in unison. They placed the torch on the fire before standing next to the coffin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than ten blazing torches lit the scene as bright as day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more detailed the autopsy results are, the better. The main objectives are to know whether she was pregnant or not, and the cause of her death,” Su Fu said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan glanced at the white paper. The more detailed the report, the better. Forget about the paper, even ten more pieces would not be enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leader’s acuity was extremely sharp. Seeing Ran Yan’s sidelong glance, he immediately whispered to the black-clothed man beside him and quickly added a thick stack of paper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan’s heart gave a startled jolt. She quickly calmed down and acted more carefully to avoid being noticed by that person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skin and soft tissues on the corpse’s bones have completely decomposed, and it was also slightly weathered. This person had been in the soil for at least ten years. Moreover, the coffin was impeccably clean and has a faint wood fragrance. It could be seen that it had been recently made. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cadaver’s pelvis was low and wide, obviously a female. However, because the body was buried for too long, there was even slight weathering on the corpse. Comparatively speaking, it was challenging to find more useful information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan examined the corpse as a whole and found that the female corpse had a missing toe on its left foot. Other than that, the other parts were well preserved. </span></p>
