            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 89 – Night Talk</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that she didn’t plan to expound further, Su Fu didn’t ask anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Will tonight’s autopsy cause me any trouble?” Ran Yan knew what people said about her. Although her skills in autopsy have not been seen by many, it would be easy for them to associate her with the rumors in Suzhou. If the other party was from an ordinary family, they would not care about looking into her. But based on the posture of those people, she could tell that they would not be easily deceived. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as you stay out of his reach, he won’t do anything to you,” Su Fu said indifferently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan looked at Su Fu, her gaze probing, wondering if he was within that person’s grasp. Her queries were well-measured and on point, however, she hadn’t prod too deep, and he didn’t feel troubled(by them).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the chickens were finished roasting, the two sat across from each other, cutting into the meat with a dagger. Ran Yan was as meticulous as ever. Whenever she got her hands on a “body”, she would unconsciously wonder how to perfectly separate the bones from the flesh while minimizing the incisions needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all forensic doctors had this habit. However, when a body arrived under her hands, she would try her best to keep it in its cleanest and most complete state and produce the most thorough analysis possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu seemed to be eating seriously, but he was watching her every move. Even with the doubts in his heart, he did not ask further questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After quietly finishing their dinner, he got up to send her back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unarmed, he looked like an ordinary, handsome man. Eyes downcast, he walked quietly beside her, helping her with her toolbox. The moonlight reflected his charming facial features. Ran Yan’s eyes lingered on him, secretly regretting that she could not appreciate his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Fu had also been looking at the seemingly frail lady beside him. She constantly surprised him. He remembered how she looked when she saw the ribs on the body that had been stabbed with a broad knife. If he had not known in advance, he would have never imagined that this person was a lady. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How is your injury?” Ran Yan asked, recalling that he had previously had an injury on his waist. She didn’t know how he could do such violent tasks with a severe injury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not a big deal.” For Su Fu, as long as it was not fatal, it was not a big deal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan didn’t believe him, but since he said it was not a problem she couldn’t ask more. She just nodded slightly, before taking the box and leaving the orchard forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she reached the end, she suddenly stopped and turned to look at the forest. Su Fu stood in the shadow of the trees, a faint smile on his face. Seeing her turn back he froze, before quickly disappearing like the wind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan blinked, she was right! Su Fu smiled. Even though it had been tiny, nearly imperceptible, his gorgeous appearance was seared into her brain. It took her a long time to recover from that scene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans have been visual creatures. Some people believe that those who paid too much attention to their appearance were superficial. However, no matter who they were, consciously or subconsciously, they would be more tolerant toward beautiful people, especially those who are extremely beautiful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After standing for a moment, Ran Yan withdrew from her thoughts and entered the yard. When she entered the bedroom, she discovered that she was still wearing Su Fu’s robe. She pondered for a while until she folded it up and hid it in a secret place. Otherwise, she might have to explain it like that basin of blood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no hot water, she carefully wiped her body with well water and washed her hair. Shivering, she covered herself in a quilt, warmth spreading all over her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reminded her of her past when she had to stay up until she was physically and mentally exhausted just to sleep every night. She dared to go to the morgue alone in the middle of the night but did not dare to face those dreams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her body gradually loosened when a ray of fire entered the room. She turned her head and saw that Xing Niang was holding a lamp and opened the curtain to come in. Seeing the gleam in Ran Yan’s eyes, she was startled for a moment and asked, “Why hasn’t Miss slept yet?!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was just about to sleep. Why are you here?” Ran Yan sat up with the quilt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xing Niang placed down the lamp and took a dry towel from the screen. She helped Ran Yan wring her hair and sighed with relief. “I saw Miss scooping water in the yard alone. It’s dangerous to walk about at night! It is said that people who roam at night cannot be disturbed, and this old servant dare not disturb you. I dared to come to take a look when I saw you return to the house. Why did Miss wash her hair in the middle of the night? It’s scary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan acted like she had not gone out before. So she changed the subject and said, “Are Wan Lu and Xiao Man awake?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xing Niang said as she coiled her hair, “Wan Lu is a heavy sleeper. No matter how loudly I call out to her,  she doesn’t stir. But not Xiao Man, she wakes up. As for this old woman, I have difficulty in sleeping so I let Wan Lu continue to sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan responded with a hum. Xing Niang continued to murmur, “Miss, you should not wash your hair with cold water. You are a delicate person. If you fall ill while you’re still young, you will suffer as you get older.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I won’t next time.” Ran Yan understood this fact. She would obediently follow Xing Niang’s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan’s hair was very long. It would take a while to dry it. She asked Xing Niang, “Did you ask about the events down the mountain during the day?” She knew that she(XN) would inquire. She only wanted to know how the situation was at the foot of the mountain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xing Niang sighed before saying, “In the end, the Yan family still cares about the Ran family’s dignity. They turned down the first engagement but took in Fifteenth Miss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fifteenth Miss? With Yan Erlang?” Ran Yan raised an eyebrow. The Fifteenth Miss was the daughter of a concubine from the Third Household. With such status, she was not worthy in the eyes of the Yan Family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, but she could only be a concubine. They say that after Madam Zheng passes, they will proceed with the Fifteenth Miss’ matter.” Xing Niang sulked and said, “This old servant had thought that they did this for the sake of the Ran family’s dignity. Right now, Madam has not yet passed on so how could the matter of accepting a concubine be settled now? Yan Erlang must first marry a daughter from a noble family in the future. How can such a lady be alright with this kind of grievance!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Tang Dynasty, a concubine could only be allowed to join the family if the first wife gave her consent. Although the law said so, most of the time, even if the first wife was unwilling, she had to agree for one reason or another. However, if the marriage of a concubine has been settled before the first wife passes, it was indeed disrespectful to the uninformed first wife. Facts have proven, however, that those sly-foxed elders from both families should already have known of this matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Meixi was the Fifteenth Miss. Ran Yan recalled a girl who was dull and timid, who had been carefully following the Fourteenth Miss. However, she seemed different underneath her timidness, so she (RY) could not help but ask, “What kind of person is Fifteenth Miss?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xing Niang had taken out a comb and was carefully combing Ran Yan’s long tresses. She paused and thought for a moment. “I’ve only seen Fifteenth Miss a few times. She didn’t leave a big impression. However, Ge Lan once said to me that Fifteenth Miss is not as she seems. Her biological mother was a maid, who became a concubine because she gave birth to a son. If it wasn’t for those giving advice to the Fifteenth Miss, I’m afraid she would not be as favored as she is today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xing Niang had never questioned Ge Lan’s judgment. Seeing that there was no change on Ran Yan’s face she continued. “If I hadn’t witnessed Ge Lan’s intelligence with my own eyes, this old servant would not have believed what kind of outcome Fifteenth Miss would have caused. After all, she is quite young.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan smiled. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on what Xing Niang meant, it was the Fifteenth Miss who had taught Ya Niang how to hook her father’s heart. If that was true, Fifteenth Miss was no simple woman. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your hair is dry. Please go to bed and get up early tomorrow to listen to the Scriptures.” Xing Niang urged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Yan nodded and laid down. Xing Niang asked whether she should keep the light on or not. She asked her to turn it off. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room suddenly plunged into darkness. It took a while for her eyes to adapt before she could begin to see things. She looked out the window, to the frost-like moonlight on the ground. Her mind wandered about many things, but soon she succumbed to exhaustion and slowly closed her eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the nightmare from her previous life returned to haunt her, a deep frown laced her slumbering visage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At dawn, she heard the sound of a distant bell that penetrated the pure mist, washing away her fear and resentment like a wisp of clear spring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bell kept ringing about two dozen times as the faint chanting of monks followed. They were chanting in Sanskrit, and even if one didn’t understand the words, one could still feel its tranquil power. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monks?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ran Yan was dazed and confused. Accompanied by this calming sound, she gradually fell asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not until the sky was bright that Wan Lu came to wake her up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The food in this nunnery is not good, but the Feng Shui is. Miss has been here for the past two days and it feels as if you have grown a lot.” Wan Lu took out some clothes from the box and brought them to Ran Yan. “Which one would you like to wear today, Miss?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Lu’s hands held exquisite and gorgeous clothes, Ran Yunsheng had gotten them custom-made for Ran Yan. She slightly frowned and said, “I’m here to meditate and worship the god. Even if it’s only an act, I have to abide by the rules here. How can I wear such flamboyant clothes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Lu looked at the clothes in her hands and thought they were inappropriate. So she brought out a few more plain and clean ones and Ran Yan chose a dark underskirt to wear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Man was helping her mistress to freshen up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Lu was making Ran Yan’s bed when she asked, “Miss, are you going to listen to the Scriptures?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. You don’t have to follow along,” Ran Yan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it were Xing Niang who had heard this, she would have been mortified by those words. She would feel that she had offended the Young Miss. However, Wan Lu sprang to her feet and said, “Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stay and copy the medical book. Just copy the《Herbal Collection》given by Master[mfn]Wu Xiu He, RY’s doctor who took her as his disciple.[/mfn]. The handwriting should be clear and neat. Don’t be lazy!” Ran Yan added lightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Lu puffed her cheeks and said, “My lady, there’s too much fluctuation in your speech. Your words are misleading; it has made this servant very unhappy. I won’t even be able to recognize all those words.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Man was combing Ran Yan’s hair, and could only glance at Wan Lu from the corner of her eyes and calmly said, “You are the attending maid of the Ran family’s legitimate daughter. How can you belittle yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Lu pursed her lips. She was not belittling herself. Those words, even if she wanted to, could not be easily comprehended in a single night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Man chuckled but it didn’t take too long for her to hear Ran Yan say, “Xiao Man, you also accompany Wan Lu in copying the medical books.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Man waved her hands, her eyes opened wide. “Miss, I can’t read that well!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let Wan Lu teach you.” Ran Yan looked at the copper mirror. With her bunned hair combed, she got up and went out. She took Xing Niang with her to listen to the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mouths agape, Wan Lu and Xiao Man were left staring at their departing mistress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Man knew in her heart that Ran Yan was doing this for her own good. So she leaned toward Wan Lu and said, “Thank you, Sister Wan Lu, for teaching me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Lu felt that her head would explode. She would have a headache at the mere sight of those words, and now she has to teach too? Might as well kill her directly!</span></p>
