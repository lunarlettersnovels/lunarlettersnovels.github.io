            <p><strong>Chapter 5.2</strong></p>
<p>“Yes, boss. What? I’m at Noona Miji’s place. Why? Where? Ah, da.mn. I’m busy right now.”</p>
<p>He reluctantly agreed to something and hung up. During the call, Eunsan’s unwavering gaze on her was hard for Hongju to ignore, but she managed to avert her eyes, finding solace in the surroundings of the shop.</p>
<p>After finishing the call, Eunsan rummaged through his wallet and pulled out two 50,000 won bills. He shoved the money into Hongju’s hand before she could even react.</p>
<p>“I guess we’ll have to shop for clothes later. Consider this your mental distress compensation or whatever. Use it wisely, or else you’ll be punished.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Just then, Miji arrived with a teacup, and Eunsan stretched out his long arm.</p>
<p>“Noona, did you pick the citron yourself to make this tea? Anyway, I’ll be back tonight. See you.”</p>
<p>He placed the cup on the table and left the shop with a swagger. Though Miji yelled at him to take Gisong with him, he only glanced back briefly and did not return.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Madame Jang, looking exhausted, slumped into the seat across from Hongju. She lit a cigarette and pushed a teacup towards Hongju. The strong smell of toba no longer bothered Hongju. Miji, looking at Gisong, wrinkled her face in disgust.</p>
<p>“Maybe I should close down this business for real.”</p>
<p>What followed was an account of Madame Jang’s tumultuous life and an explanation about the remote area near the sea where Hongju had ended up.</p>
<p>Seomgyeong.</p>
<p>The city got its name because the way its roads extended towards the sea resembled the stems of a plant. Sokmyeon, where Hongju had found herself, was a small neighborhood in Seomgyeong, located northwest of Chungnam Province. Despite its small size, it was overflowing with stories.</p>
<p>Several large and small islands surrounded it, and the harbor, which had developed during that time, still had a few locations on the outskirts of the city. However, with the decline in visitors, these harbors had become mostly useless.</p>
<p>Sokmyeon in Seomgyeong City, like any other small provincial town, had gone through a brief period of prosperity before arriving at its current state.</p>
<p>The sea behind it and the mountains in front created a sense of isolation, and poor transportation further contributed to its secluded nature. This isolation paradoxically led to the development of other industries.</p>
<p>Namely, the bar and gambling business.</p>
<p>In other words, this place was a hidden gem in Seomgyeong City. Rumor had it that more cash circulated here than anywhere else in Chungnam Province, and Madam Jang nodded, believing it to be true.</p>
<p>Originally from Seomgyeong, Madame Jang had run a large hostess bar in Seoul. According to her, the revenue from Rose Beer didn’t fall short compared to the bars in the heart of Gangnam.</p>
<p>The reason a woman who had managed a high-end hostess bar in Gangnam was now running a small, quaint bar in this tiny town could be summed up with, “It just happened.”</p>
<p>In any case, the town, where all sorts of information and cash flowed like waves, had become a virtually unchecked paradise, free from regulatory crackdowns.</p>
<p>“That guy from earlier, Eunsan. He will come every night from now on to get his money. I was going to tell you in advance that if I’m busy, you’ll have to give him the money and get his stamp instead. Anyway, look at the counter over there. It’s under the safe. No, wait, come here.”</p>
<p>Miji led Hongju to the counter and showed her where the money for the savings was kept. Bundles of cash, mixed with 50,000 won and 10,000 won notes, were tightly wrapped with yellow rubber bands.</p>
<p>Afterward, Madame Jang took Hongju around, explaining the layout and duties of the shop. While learning how to peel fruits in the kitchen, Hongju also got more information about Eunsan.</p>
<p>Eunsan Lee was a private loan shark. This straightforward fact didn’t surprise Hongju at all, as he looked every bit like an ignorant thug.</p>
<p>“They call it a ‘savings,’ but it’s really just daily interest payments. If you want to do business in this town, Mr. Kim… I mean, from Eunsan’s Capital, no exceptions. The local merchants’ association, the community leaders, the police, and even the lawmakers are all under President Kim Daepyung’s thumb… So, even if it means paying high interest, you have to borrow from them to start a business. It’s tough, but what can you do? The desperate one has to bow down. There’s no other choice.”</p>
<p>“Is he a thug, too?”</p>
<p>“Thug? Well, he used to be a big shot back in the day, but now he just runs the Capital. Anyway, no one messes with that guy in Seomgyeong.”</p>
