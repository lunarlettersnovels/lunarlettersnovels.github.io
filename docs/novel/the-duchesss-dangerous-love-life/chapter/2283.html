            <p><strong>Chapter 74 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>When Noah said those words, his tone was oozing with smugness.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Tell me, what do you want me to do? Suck you?”</p>
<p>Then he leaned closer until she could feel his hot breath on her face. “Or do you want me to f*ck you?”</p>
<p>Adele’s face had long turned red from embarrassment. She couldn’t look straight at him anymore. She pulled her hand out of his grasp and turned her body to the side, covering her face in the process.</p>
<p><em>Hm?</em></p>
<p>When Noah saw what Adele did, he wondered if he had gone overboard in teasing her, so he stroked her rigid back to soothe her nerves. When she still didn’t respond, he patted her on the buttocks and her body lurched up as she felt ashamed.</p>
<p>He chuckled, “Shy?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Quite the picky one, mm?”</p>
<p>While talking, he began to touch Adele’s body with his rugged hands. He stroked her erogenous areas and gently tasted her luscious skin with his tongue, because he couldn’t stand the temptation.</p>
<p>Her scent drifted by, tantalizing his nostrils. The more he smelled it, the more he couldn’t resist the urge to pounce on her.</p>
<p>“You’re driving me mad.” Noah buried his face in her skin and inhaled sharply, feeling drunk from the floral smell emanating from her. Adele slightly lifted her eyes and met with his golden ones.</p>
<p>Noah parted her legs to lick her inner thighs and closed his eyes in contentment, then he leaned over and rubbed his body against her. When he bit her ear, Adele shivered uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Noah nipped at the lobe, “The ear is very sensitive. Did you know that?”</p>
<p>“Stop touching it…”</p>
<p>He raised a brow, amused. “Where do you want me to touch you then?”</p>
<p>The hand that had been touching her belly slid all the way down to her labia. “Here?”</p>
<p>Noah rubbed her labia again, and Adele bit her lip to hold back her moans. But when he flicked his fingers, Adele had no choice but to let out a gasp and moaned loudly as he bit her neck like a bloodsucker.</p>
<p>“S-stop—<em>ahh</em>—t-the maids would hear us!”</p>
<p>Because of the palace banquet, all the servants were in the annex, not in the main castle. But Adele still bit her lip, trying to reign in those lewd noises coming from her throat. But Noah didn’t let things go her way.</p>
<p>His fingers went into her mouth and stirred the inside, Adele suckled on it instinctively, with her little tongue peeking out every now and then.</p>
<p>The more her mouth got messed up, the more Adele’s eyes became wetter and her cheeks redder than ever. The sensation of her tongue playing with his fingers further stoked the raging fire within him.</p>
<p><em>F*ck!</em></p>
<p>Noah desperately wanted to make her cry even more by pounding into her insides with his swollen member.</p>
<p>“Adellia… that face…” He groaned, both in pain and pleasure, “So f*cking beautiful.”</p>
<p>As he gently pulled his hand away, Adele spun her body and hastily used her hand to cover her genitals. It was to prevent any foreign object that would likely penetrate her at any given moment.</p>
<p>But Noah only grinned, quite darkly at that. “Play with yourself.”</p>
<p>“…uh”</p>
<p>“It’ll feel great.”</p>
<p>Seduced by the whispers of the devil, Adele timidly began to move her fingers in circular motions. It was starting to make erotic, squelching sounds.</p>
<p>In Noah’s eyes, even her clumsy hand movements were the most exquisite he’d ever seen.</p>
<p>He tenderly placed his hand on hers.</p>
<p>Noah exerted more strength to his nimble fingers and fondled her clitoris. Adele panted breathlessly as she tensed up, feeling his firm upper body against her back.</p>
<p>“Shh. Relax, I’ll make you feel better.”</p>
<p>As he said that, her body loosened up significantly. His tight arms embraced her waist to support her body as he laid Adele on top of himself.</p>
<p>He too, started to masturbate.</p>
<p>Rubbing himself fiercely, a growl emitted from deep within his throat. Adele whimpered, her eyes somewhat begging.</p>
<p>“Shall I do it harder?” His other hand that was kneading her entrance immediately increased in intensity.</p>
<p>At this point, Adele could only cry out loudly with a tone laced with palpable desire.</p>
<p>Noah was pleased with her reactions, “It seems that this is enough.”</p>
<p>After a round of pleasuring themselves, they both reached climax at the same time. Adele was drowning in extreme pleasure, trembling and weeping against her will.</p>
<p>Noah licked the tears that ran down her cheeks. “One more time?”</p>
<p>“N-no…” she replied feebly.</p>
<p>As she shook her head. Noah gave a brief kiss on her cheek.</p>
<p>“I recall that you toyed with yourself for quite a long time that night.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>A knowing glint flashed in his eyes, “At the study, I saw you. You were even very enthusiastic about it.”</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p><em>He saw me?!</em></p>
<p>When the truth she frantically wanted to hide the most was revealed, Adele anxiously grabbed the sofa with quivering hands and dug her nails into the leather. The feeling of wanting to tear things apart but couldn’t aggravated her to no end.</p>
<p>Noah, who was kissing the nape of her neck, smiled softly. “Back then, it was so endearing to see you do such a thing to yourself.”</p>
<p>Can she still pretend she didn’t know about it?</p>
<p>“W-what do you mean?”</p>
<p>Entertained by her weak attempts of denial, Noah affectionately patted her hair, “What were you thinking about while doing it?”</p>
<p>Adele hoped for the ground to swallow her whole.</p>
<p>“Definitely not my brother, right?”</p>
