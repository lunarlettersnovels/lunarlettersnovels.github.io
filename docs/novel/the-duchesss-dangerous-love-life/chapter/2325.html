            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 32 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>His hand raised Adele’s pelvis. In an instant, her hips were dangling high up and her face pressed firmly against the bed. She bit her lip at her shameful posture. Ah, she hoped this to end soon!</p>
<p>Adele didn’t know why he was angry or what he meant, but she wanted the act to finish quickly. Noah grabbed her pelvis and started aggressively thrusting inside of her.</p>
<p>He was very rough this time, unlike last night’s where he was gentle and softly touched her inner walls and stimulated it.</p>
<p>When he kept prodding at those sensitive sweet spots that aroused her immensely, Adele’s whole body had no choice but to react erotically. A pleasured moan came flowing out of her lips.</p>
<p>“Raise your back more.” Noah pressed down her lower stomach with his nimble fingers. “I’ll fill you up soon. Don’t lower your back.”</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>A crisp sound was heard as Noah’s hand made contact with her soft bottom. It wasn’t painful, rather, it felt so deliciously stimulating. But it was so shameful that Adele bit her lip and buried her face on the bed.</p>
<p>“Ah, u-uh!”</p>
<p>As his huge erection pierced her without mercy and moved freely, exhilarating pleasure began spreading through Adele’s legs. Her legs weakened and she had to lower her posture to support her body. Noticing her movements, Noah slapped her on the buttocks once more.</p>
<p>“My wife, will you bear my child?”</p>
<p>Adele’s arm trembled. At the same time, Noah took out his erection completely and shoved it back in at once. She cried out in pain.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“How can you not endure this?”</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>As Noah’s palm slammed against her hip, Adele naturally tightened her tingling core. He groaned as he felt his member being squeezed so tightly and rammed even harder. She drooled at the unfamiliar sensation.</p>
<p>“Hah, ah, uh…”</p>
<p>“You must be loving it. But darling, don’t squeeze too much.” Noah smiled smugly and grunted out a few more words. “Good thing that my brother is already dead.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“He died without knowing that his wife was enjoying s*x with his own brother.”</p>
<p>At Noah’s words, Adele slipped and fell on the bed. Noah tried to grab her pelvis again, but felt her body tremble and stayed his hand. Sensing something strange about her, Noah tried to turn her around, but Adele’s hand was faster.</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>Noah’s cheeks reddened. He wrinkled his forehead and looked down at her. Adele trembled, his gaze was terrifying, but she said what she wanted to say.</p>
<p>“T-take your hands off me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She sobbed, “I already told you, do not insult me.”</p>
<p>Noah put his hand down. Then Adele covered herself with her arms and turned around to stare at him. Tears of resentment flowed down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Do not treat me badly. I am not something you can just mishandle as you please!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“It seems that you hate me. I-I hate you too.” Her voice choked at the last word.</p>
<p>Noah’s eyes widened in incredulity, “What?”</p>
<p>“But unlike you, I respect you! I’m just—”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“—trying hard to have a good relationship with you!”</p>
<p>Adele recalled every conversation she had with him from the two years she’d known him until now. For countless times, including awkward conversations and quiet meals, she always tried hard to make him feel good.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he only responded with a cold expression. No matter how much he hated her, she was his sister-in-law. His brother’s wife! A family to be respected!</p>
<p>“And how did you repay me?” a bitter expression flitted through her face, “You were always cold, always bitter, and always looking down on me!”</p>
<p>Noah himself did not understand where all of these came from and could only say, “I did not look down on you.”</p>
<p>“Lies!”</p>
<p>He was flustered at her reply. “It’s not a lie.”</p>
<p>Ha! The great commander? Flustered? No one would believe it.</p>
<p>Adele laughed sarcastically. Seeing her cold face for the first time in his life, Noah felt a knot in his chest and hurriedly wiped Adele’s tears with his hands, but she swatted them away.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I hate people like you.”</p>
<p>In shock, Noah clenched his fists tightly and slightly lowered them. Adele was unable to see that as her eyes were still blurry from the tears.</p>
<p><em>Sob, sob.</em></p>
<p>Seeing her cry like a child, Noah ran his fingers through his hair. She wasn’t a woman who would cry like that. She had an elegant and dignified nature. If she shed any tears, she would shed it quietly.</p>
<p>Knowing that, he hugged her from behind. Adele refused his touch and said no. She hit her fist on his shoulder and it hurt quite a bit, but Noah didn’t move an inch. “Don’t cry.”</p>
<p>“Let me go!”</p>
<p>He just consoled her, “Don’t cry…”</p>
<p><em>Why won’t he apologize!</em> Adele felt herself wanting to cry more at that thought and continued to hit his broad shoulder with her hand. Noah never let go, he just kept on patting her back with his big hand.</p>
<p>“I hate you!”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>“I hate you!”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Noah bit his lips to endure, her jabs weren’t that painful but her words were. He bit it so hard that a little blood came out. He hugged her for a long time without saying a word.</p>
<p>Adele, who had been hitting him for a while, quickly became exhausted. Noah put her down on the bed carefully as she exhaled all her anger in big puffs of breath. She took the duvet off as soon as he put it on her.</p>
<p>“I’m going out.” Adele picked up the lingerie that had fallen to the floor, put it back on, and walked past Noah.</p>
<p>However, he hurriedly grabbed her arm. “Don’t go.”</p>
<p>At Noah’s morose expression, Adele bit her lip. He seemed to be sorry for making her cry, but he never outright apologized. She didn’t want to be in this bedroom anymore. The embarrassment she had received kept running through her heart. She just wanted to leave.</p>
<p>She looked at Noah with his head bowed, like a wolf abandoned by his mother. Although angry, Adele paused as she thought he looked somewhat lonely and sad. Of course, that wasn’t enough to soften her heart, so she shook her hand.</p>
<p>“Let go of me.”</p>
<p>Noah quickly grabbed Adele and hugged her. “I can’t.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You can’t go.” Noah hugged Adele from behind and buried his face onto her delicate shoulders. She tried hitting and pinching his arm, but to no avail. As her strength gradually diminished, Adele’s wearied body sank unceremoniously.</p>
<p>When her breathing finally became steady, Noah carefully laid her back inside the bed. Noah, who laid next to her, stared at his sleeping wife. He stroked her wet cheek.</p>
<p>“You are my woman.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You are my wife.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I won’t lose you ever again.”</p>
<p>The replies he received were his wife’s stable breathing, but that didn’t matter to him.</p>
<p>Noah’s voice did not wake Adele up. He didn’t know when his wife would wake up, so he just watched over her until dawn.</p>
<p>He didn’t sleep a wink that night.</p>
