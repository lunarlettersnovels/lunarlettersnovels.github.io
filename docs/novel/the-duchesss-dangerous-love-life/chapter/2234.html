            <p><strong>Chapter 123</strong></p>
<p>Although it was still unconfirmed whether or not she was truly pregnant, Noah still liked to think in that direction.</p>
<p>“What if… <em>we</em> make him a companion?”</p>
<p>“Hm? What?”</p>
<p>“For example,” he grinned, “…a little sister?”</p>
<p><em>Pa!</em></p>
<p>Adele slapped his thigh, but Noah simply held her hand and kissed it. Looking at his perfectly sculpted face, she could only sigh in resignation.</p>
<p><em>After all these years… still too good-looking.</em></p>
<p>As Adele remained motionless, Noah thought it meant that she was giving him permission to do what he liked and thus, began to move his hand more boldly.</p>
<p>Feeling the lewd gestures of his wandering hands, she immediately chided, “If you dare do it here, I will bite your tongue.”</p>
<p>Noah glanced at her with an innocent expression, “What did I do wrong?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“My lovely wife, I want to touch you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Seeing her glaring at him, Noah raised his arms and shrugged his shoulders. “All right, all right. I understand.”</p>
<p>Adele sighed and spread her arms to embrace him tightly. Noah wiggled his eyebrows at her unexpected action.</p>
<p>“I can’t touch, but you can?”</p>
<p>She raised a delicate brow, challenging him, “So, you don’t like it?”</p>
<p>“He who wants to eat fruit must climb the tree.”</p>
<p>Adele chuckled amusedly and continued. “Truthfully speaking, I was about to summon you earlier.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Right now?”</p>
<p>Usually, at this time of the day, Noah was training his knights. Adele was also aware of that fact and knew he would be busy. Nevertheless, she still nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Then she gestured towards a certain patch of land near a pond, “Look, the forget-me-nots are blooming so wonderfully today.”</p>
<p>Following her line of sight, he saw that it was indeed the case. The scene that greeted him was so beautiful that it looked like it was captured from something out of a fairytale. For a moment, Noah had forgotten his urges and didn’t feel like hugging her in the midst of this picturesque landscape.</p>
<p>It was strange. It’s been over seven years since they’ve been together and confirmed each other’s feelings. But looking at flowers and then towards his wife…</p>
<p>Noah softly caressed Adele’s back, lost in thought.</p>
<p>“Darling, did you know? Other ladies count their wedding anniversaries from a calendar.” he tenderly placed a kiss on her head. “But for me, I know it from the moment those little flowers unfurl their petals.”</p>
<p>Adele slapped his broad shoulders for a moment and looked at Noah with an annoyed expression on her face. “Did you forget? We got married in the summer.”</p>
<p>He responded, gazing at her deeply.</p>
<p>“Our real wedding took place in springtime.” He was talking about when they confirmed each other’s feelings on that fateful day.</p>
<p>Resting her head against his chest, Adele listened to the rhythmic beating of his heart.</p>
<p>“It’s been a few years since we got married.” She let out a long sigh as she thought back to around this time of the month, seven years ago. “At that point, I really thought I was going to die—<em>no.</em> I was really going to die.”</p>
<p>“No, don’t think of it that way.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Holding her closer to him, he spoke. “Even if I had died then and there, you should still live the rest of your days to the fullest. I am not worthy enough for you to end your life for me.”</p>
<p>“But,” Adele stroked Noah’s cheek with a painful expression on her face, “we are a couple. How can I live without you by my side?”</p>
<p>“My wife, I have to protect you in any way that I can. Even if it means giving up my life in exchange for yours.”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, I’ll follow you wherever you are.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“That’s why I made that decision back then.”</p>
<p>Noah did not respond to Adele’s words. Instead of speaking, he gently rested his head on her slender shoulder.</p>
<p>“At that time, I truly was prepared to perish together with you.” Adele said, wrapping her arms around Noah’s waist.</p>
<p>“I already said you mustn’t.” Then his eyes turned gentle, “My heart cannot bear it. Even the earth would mourn for the passing of a beauty as tender-hearted as you.”</p>
<p>Adele felt her heart melting at his words.</p>
<p>“But human greed knows no bounds and it scares me.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Why would that matter?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Because I am greedy for your touch and your warmth. Living on earth would no longer hold any meaning for me if you ceased to exist. At that time, I would’ve gladly welcomed death’s embrace with you.”</p>
<p>As Noah lifted his head, Adele closed her eyes and curved her lips upwards. Not wanting to miss that lovely smile, Noah put their foreheads together and then they gazed into each other’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I wanted to have a real marriage with you.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“Afterwards, I thought it would be lovely if we had a child.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>Listening to the soft wind, the melodious chirping of birds, and breathing in his calming scent—Adele’s heart was at ease.</p>
<p>“I have always wanted to live with you. Somewhere peaceful, just like this.”</p>
<p>“Mn. Me too.” Noah stroked Adele’s face and kissed her eyes and cheek several times, but Adele grabbed his hand while she laughed, trying to stop his barrage of kisses, “Tell me, what else do you want?”</p>
