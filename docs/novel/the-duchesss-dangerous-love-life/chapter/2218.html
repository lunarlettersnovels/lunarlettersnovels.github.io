            <p><strong>Chapter 139</strong></p>
<p>His forehead creased. A trace of worry and guilt was seen on his handsome countenance as he hid his face into his palms, “I just… can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>“Believe what?”</p>
<p>“In my memory, you… seemed to be still in bed every single time, tired or sick.” Slowly, he gazed up at her, “Do you hate me?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking abou—<em>oh, my God!</em>” Adele quickly realized what those memories meant. They were probably the times when he had… ravaged her relentlessly all throughout the night.</p>
<p>Noah frowned and lowered his head again. Adele shook her head as she looked somewhat pitiful.</p>
<p>“I said it before, I do not hate you.”</p>
<p>“But I remember you lying motionless in bed,” he refuted, “…with an unwilling expression on your face.”</p>
<p>“No!” she raised her voice to deny it and shook her head.</p>
<p>“It’s all because you don’t remember.” then she added with a straight face, “You see, I’m usually the one who would… take control during bedtime.”</p>
<p>Noah’s right eyebrow raised imperceptibly.</p>
<p>“…really?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Since Adele was on the path of no return, might as well finish it til’ the end.</p>
<p>She uttered in an assertive tone.</p>
<p>“Lay down.”</p>
<p>Slowly climbing onto him, Adele let her clothes slip from her delicate shoulders and started rubbing her bottom.</p>
<p>Her body was still sensitive from all the lovemaking they did last night. Which is why, her core was already dripping wet as she was so easily aroused. Noah could practically enter her already, and he hadn’t even done much yet.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He clenched his teeth as he saw the wetness between her legs. His member hardened even more, but he restrained himself from taking action.</p>
<p>Adele was intrigued by the somewhat passive appearance of her husband and played with herself even harder.</p>
<p>“Haa.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Moaning, Adele bit her lips seductively and peeked at him with hooded eyes. He shyly turned his head to the side and pressed his lips into a thin line, the veins on his forehead already protruding from his skin. Then his member throbbed even more and raised its tip towards her.</p>
<p>Adele went into her knees and slowly raised her ass. She grabbed his thick penis and slowly slid it inside of her.</p>
<p>It was a position that they had not done for a long time.</p>
<p>With her on top.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>As his bulky member entered her from below, her insides felt even tighter as it clamped down on him. Adele felt her stomach was full from the entirety of him. However, her entrance was slightly sore because of the number of times they’ve already done it in the past few hours.</p>
<p>“Adellia, does it… hurt?”</p>
<p>“I’m alright.” She didn’t want to stop there, she was already this excited and wanted release. Moreover, given the rate at which he recalls his memories, he would soon revert back to the Noah she knew.</p>
<p>After that, she would no longer have the opportunity to dominate over him again.</p>
<p>Adele rocked her body up and down, lewd noises coming in between their legs as she tightened and loosened herself around him. It almost made his mind go insane.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Ugh… ” Noah unconsciously bit his lip, barely holding back his pleasure and slowly began to experience an exhilarating sensation.</p>
<p>It was strangely satisfying to see him like this—his face blushing beneath her touch and the ragged rise and fall of his chest accompanied with a low moan.</p>
<p>Adele had another crazy idea.</p>
<p>She lifted her slip that still hung on her waist, “Put your hands up.”</p>
<p>He obeyed, “Like this?”</p>
<p>As Noah lifted his hands up, Adele quickly secured his wrists with a piece of cloth and tied them to the bed’s headboard. Noah’s eyes widened, his cheeks blushing with embarrassment.</p>
<p>Adele smiled brightly, trying to hide her nervousness.</p>
<p>“Remember this? We did this so often…” she chuckled.</p>
<p>“…really? I don’t… remember.”</p>
<p>“Mmm… your memories are still that of a seventeen-year-old after all.”</p>
<p>He frowned, “Don’t… treat me like a child.”</p>
<p>Adele saw his upturned lips and brushed away the bangs covering his face. Then she gradually moved her waist in rapid succession. The more she did it with him being restrained, the more Noah writhed and wriggled his body.Soon, he couldn’t stand it anymore and began thrusting upwards to match her movements and relieve his body of tension.</p>
<p>As if to punish him, Adele tightened her inner walls. He stiffened with a moan and his movements halted. She felt a strange sense of satisfaction as she wiped his teary eyes.</p>
<p>“Adellia… ” he breathed out.</p>
<p>He had always been the one who took control.</p>
<p>This time, however, she wanted to take the lead, and seeing Noah’s submission like a tamed beast made Adele feel so superior that she lifted her with a proud glint in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Stay still.” she uttered with an intoxicated expression, “I’ll take care of everything…”</p>
<p>“Can’t we move a little bit? At the rate you’re going, I feel like I’m going to die.”</p>
<p>“…just a little.”</p>
