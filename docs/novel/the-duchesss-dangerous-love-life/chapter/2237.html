            <p><strong>Chapter 120</strong></p>
<p>“Heavens! What happened here?!”</p>
<p>Lina held a basket in one hand and stared at the miserable state of the room.</p>
<p>A bunch of books and cups floated mid-air, and the carpeted floor was littered with morsels of leftover dessert. In the middle of all of these, a conspicuous black energy swirled innocently.</p>
<p>The person who was responsible for all of these, was currently sitting by the window sill with a book in one hand.</p>
<p>“Young master!”</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh, it’s Lina.” Sean slowly closed the book he was reading, “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>With the obstruction gone, Lina could finally see the boy’s features. Soft, light-brown hair, long lashes, and a milky white complexion that made him look like an angel. However, seeing the mischievous smirk on his face, Lina thought he was more like a little devil in disguise.</p>
<p>She sighed deeply.</p>
<p>He did not even resemble the brooding temperament of his father, nor did he acquire the gentle disposition of his mother. His personality was too cheeky.</p>
<p>Right now, he was still a bit too young and his features hadn’t matured yet. But by the time he reaches adulthood, every woman who had ever laid their eyes on him would  not be able to sleep at night knowing that such a godly face existed on this earth.</p>
<p>Lina gave a disapproving glance at his messy room and shook her head.</p>
<p>Forget it, that would be in the future anyways. At this moment, this high and mighty young master still had to listen to her. Simply having beautiful features isn’t enough, he had to have power and skills to back himself. Otherwise, he would just be a decorative vase.</p>
<p>“You made a mess of things again, ah!” she fussed and tried to soothe herself.</p>
<p>The child is only seven years old.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old troublemaker.</p>
<p><em>A seven-year-old troublemaker who knows how to use magic.</em></p>
<p>Just the thought of it makes her even more exasperated. This naughty young master knowing magic only made things more chaotic!</p>
<p>“Young master, you shouldn’t practice in the study.”</p>
<p>He sniggered, “Why don’t I help you clean up instead?”</p>
<p>Lina thought he was just pulling another prank on her, so she ignored him and began to pick up the stuff that had fallen on the floor.</p>
<p>Sean saw a young maid, about his age, walk through the open door with a wet mop. When the young maid raised her head, her eyes met with his.</p>
<p>She hurriedly bowed her head to avoid his gaze. Sean frowned. Everyone tried to look good in front of him. Some of them couldn’t even speak properly at the sight of him. But that kid…</p>
<p>At the end of the young master’s gaze, was a maid working hard to clean up his mess. Feeling his gaze, she hurriedly shrinked into one of the corners of the room.</p>
<p><em>Why is he looking at me? Does he hate me?</em></p>
<p>As the maid did her work, she noticed that there was something wrong with her hand and sighed.</p>
<p><em>It’s swollen again.</em></p>
<p>Raising an eyebrow, Sean lifted his finger.</p>
<p>In an instant, everything flew back to its rightful place—the books went towards the shelves, the cups and bowls rearranged themselves on the table, and the cake leftovers threw themselves into the trash bin.</p>
<p>“I think your work is done now.” Sean uttered slyly and shrugged.</p>
<p>Lina could only stare blankly at the room that was tidied within a second and she then grabbed the back of her neck.</p>
<p>Feeling something similar, the young maid’s mouth parted in amazement, but then she swiftly turned her head away in fear that the young master might disdain her ignorant actions.</p>
<p>Because of this, Sean’s eyebrows furrowed.</p>
<p>However, after the shock dissipated, Lina’s blood pressure immediately skyrocketed. “Young master! If you can clean up your own mess, then you should do it every single time!”</p>
<p>“That’s her job, not mine.” he gestured towards the little maid. “She just seemed so thrilled with this job, so I thought to let her clean this place every day. Who am I to deny someone else’s happiness?”</p>
<p>Smirking at the end of his words, Lina almost pounded her chest in frustration.</p>
<p>That maid looked anything <em>but</em> happy! In fact, she looked like she would rather be anywhere else but here.</p>
<p>“Right,” he suddenly recalled something, “where is my mother?”</p>
<p>Lina exhaled, “The madam is in the herb garden.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Sean dropped the book he was holding and quickly jumped outside the window. “I need to go see her before my father monopolizes her again.”</p>
<p><em>“You—!” </em>Frightened to death by his impulsive actions, Lina, along with the little maid, ran with all their might towards the window. As she gazed down, she saw the impudent young man landing safely on solid ground.</p>
<p>“Young master! Really?!”</p>
<p>Lina felt tears of relief flowing down her cheeks, then she slumped down on the floor. If his antics were to continue under her watch, she would definitely age quicker than she’s supposed to. At this moment, she might already have white hair!</p>
<p>In contrast, the young maid watched on with her mouth open in astonishment.</p>
<p>Sean grinned.</p>
<p><em>You’re willing to look at me now? Seems like I should do this more often in the future.</em></p>
<p>With a smile, Sean turned around and ran towards the herb garden.</p>
