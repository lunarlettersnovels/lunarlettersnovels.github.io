            <p><strong>Chapter 64</strong></p>
<p>“Are you feeling hot?”</p>
<p>“A little bit.”</p>
<p>“I guess you have never danced the waltz properly. Well, my brother wouldn’t have danced with you, but didn’t you dance with your former fiancée?”</p>
<p>Surprised by the word ‘fiancée’, Adele frowned. She didn’t know how Noah knew that before she married Enon, she had brief marriage engagement with another man. She said bitterly, remembering her fiancée’s face, which had already been faded in her memories.</p>
<p>“It was just a short engagement due to our parents’ interests. As a result, we didn’t get along well, and he didn’t like me either.”</p>
<p>A temporary, breakable engagement that was made because of her father’s business. However, seventeen was the perfect age to indulge in romance-like fantasies so she still had small expectations. But it was foolish to think that a lively young man would have fond feelings towards someone like her, a shy and boring maiden.</p>
<p>Besides, wasn’t he imprisoned for doing bad things? Thinking back on her naive days, she realized she had always been easily deceived.</p>
<p>“I was young back then. That’s why—<em>Ah!</em>”</p>
<p>Noah abruptly turned around and made Adele face him, forcibly holding back the desire to kiss her right away as he looked at her with moist eyes, soaking in her beauty.</p>
<p>He uttered in absolute disdain, “That man you used to call your fiancée, he’s stupid.”</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>
<p>“But, I’m glad though…”</p>
<p>When Noah mumbled something incomprehensible, Adele frowned and bit her lips. He cocked an eyebrow as he watched her small lips, extremely tempted to devour claim them for himself.</p>
<p>Unaware of Noah’s desires, Adele simply followed his lead and focused on dancing. But the more they did, the more their lower halves made contact with each other repeatedly. For Noah, this was torture.</p>
<p>“I haven’t touched you for a week and I’m going crazy.” he said, his voice already a little raspy and a notch deeper than normal.</p>
<p>Adele tried to increase the distance, but the arm wrapped around her waist never loosened. His smirk made her face pale.</p>
<p><em>Hearing you say something like that, you don’t appear to hate me…</em></p>
<p>As Adele averted her gaze, Noah twirled her around. Her body staggered, then dropped her head in front of him. Naturally, her forehead touched his chest.</p>
<p>“Look at me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Are you thinking of your former fiancée?”</p>
<p>“I don’t even remember his face.”</p>
<p>“Lady Maktus, will you not talk of other men in front of me?”</p>
<p><em>You were the one who talked about him first!</em></p>
<p>Speechless, Adele felt like crying in indignation and pulled herself back, but Noah gripped her tighter in response.</p>
<p>As she lowered her head, her lips stretched her lips into a thin line, Adele tilted her face backwards in embarrassment. She feared that he would kiss her here.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he only stroked her pale cheek. But he did it so carefully, it felt like he was touching fragile glass.</p>
<p>Her eyes trembled as she felt the warmth from his hands, her face turning ruddy for some reason that it was embarrassing. Gradually, the gap between their lips narrowed until their foreheads met.</p>
<p>Without her knowing, Adele closed her eyes, but as time passed and nothing touched her lips, she slowly opened them back.</p>
<p>Noah grinned widely, “Why are you closing your eyes?”</p>
<p>“Ah…?”</p>
<p>“Are you expecting something, milady?”</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>He wasn’t going to let her off that easily.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘no’? You just closed your eyes and even puckered your lips.”</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The music resumed and Noah wrapped his arms around her waist yet again and guided her around. Adele was taken aback, but she swiftly concentrated her attention back to the waltz, no longer caring about their bodies touching.</p>
<p>Noah glanced at her and stopped abruptly. As soon as Adele raised her head, their lips met.</p>
<p>“Mnnf!”</p>
<p><em>They were at the imperial palace, inside the banquet hall, where all of nobility were gathered!</em></p>
<p>She tried to shake him off, but to no avail, he held her body tightly there wasn’t even room for her to wiggle around. Noah’s tongue gently entered Adele’s mouth and rubbed against hers.</p>
<p>His passionately teasing kiss weakened her knees, and he hugged her tighter to keep her from falling. Adele hit his broad shoulder to tell him to stop. At her adorable reactions, Noah separated their lips in regret.</p>
<p>“People are watching!”</p>
<p>“I’m doing this for them to see.”</p>
<p>Adele stared at him in disbelief. Noah looked down at her. Her eyes were moist and cheeks flushed. Those pink lips…</p>
<p><em>I can’t stand this!</em></p>
<p>He grabbed her with his arms wrapped around her waist.</p>
<p>“What are you—<em>mmnf!</em>”</p>
<p><em>Smooch!</em></p>
<p>“Stop—”</p>
<p><em>Smooch!</em></p>
<p>“I’m serious—”</p>
<p><em>Smooch!</em></p>
<p>Noah kissed her briefly several times and slowly retreated his lips with a devious grin. He thought about doing it one more time, but when Adele bit her lip and stared at him, he stepped back. Soon after, he raised both hands innocently as if he did nothing wrong then shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>Adele glared at his smirking face and had the urge to beat him up severely.</p>
<p>This man was exasperating!</p>
<p>“Oh, my lord!”</p>
<p>“Are my eyes playing tricks on me?”</p>
<p>Everyone in the hall, from nobles to servants, was staring at them with a small smile on their lips. It was a cute and refreshing sight after all.</p>
