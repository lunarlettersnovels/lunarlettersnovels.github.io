            <p><strong>Chapter 124</strong></p>
<p>“Well, I would’ve wanted to live a simple life with just the two of us.”</p>
<p>This time, a cheeky grin crossed his features. “That one, is quite impossible. The amount of fortune I have wouldn’t permit a life of simplicity.”</p>
<p>Adele playfully rolled her eyes. Then recalling something, she said.</p>
<p>“You should go on a picnic with Sean.”</p>
<p>“…he’s too weak to accompany me.”</p>
<p>It was such a blatant lie to anyone who heard it.</p>
<p>As Adele glared at him, Noah hugged her tightly and snuggled into her bosom to avoid her gaze. In return, he received a crisp slap on his back. He looked at the forget-me-nots in the field without showing any sign of pain.</p>
<p>“Mmm. I think it was around this time.”</p>
<p>“Our marriage?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p><em>When I first confessed to you.</em></p>
<p>But Noah swallowed his words and uttered instead. “I have a request.”</p>
<p>Adele eyed him suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Aside from discarding Sean’s status as our son and giving him another sibling, what is it that you want?”</p>
<p>He coughed, “Well, then I have nothing to say.”</p>
<p><em>Pa!</em></p>
<p>Noah received another slap in the back, but he simply hugged her. Falling onto his back, and carrying her with him, he laid her on his side and continued cuddling with her. Underneath the blue sky, they looked into each other’s eyes and smiled at the same time.</p>
<p>He gently kissed her lips.</p>
<p>“I know you didn’t tell the truth.” She glanced at him questioningly, “Was this what you wanted?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then what?”</p>
<p>“Adellia.”</p>
<p>Hearing her name, she slowly opened her eyes. In her eyes, there was only Noah’s brilliantly golden eyes. Nothing else could enter her field of vision.</p>
<p>“Stay with me for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“To stay like this… is my only wish.”</p>
<p>Adele hugged him tightly. Noah put her in his own arms and kissed her hair several times, stroking her whole body. Adele burst into laughter at the somewhat tickling kiss and said in a loud voice.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright! But only because I love you!”</p>
<p>After that, they kissed several times and whispered words of affection to each other.</p>
<p>The sunlight shone on the two figures hugging each other like it was giving its blessing of eternal love. But even then, its radiance could not match the bright smile on the man’s face as he stared fondly at the woman in his arms.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At 10 in the evening, Selena’s waiting room was already full of women, but they weren’t like the young girls in the same age group as her.</p>
<p>Mn. They were several years older and more mature.</p>
<p>After having a night out after a long time, drinking wine and champagne instead of their usual tea, these girls were immensely satisfied.</p>
<p>“How long has it been since we had a fun time like this?!”</p>
<p>“I know, right? If it wasn’t for the young miss, we wouldn’t have been able to enjoy things like we did.”</p>
<p>“Should I call you Marquis Kesenon instead of Selena now?”</p>
<p>“Gosh! I can’t tell you how happy I am that you ladies are here for the night tea.”</p>
<p>Night Teatime was held for the young lady Selena. This was an event held for the purpose of giving advice to young ladies who were about to get married. It goes without saying, that advice also includes the future couple’s… <em>bed activities</em>.</p>
<p>“There’s something I want to ask you…” the young miss started.</p>
<p>“About the first night?”</p>
<p>Even if Selena didn’t say everything, the wedded ladies were smiling mischievously as if they knew everything. Mrs. Arsene was about to tell her not to be too scared, but then she saw Adele, whom she had never spoken to before, and mentioned her instead.</p>
<p>“The Duchess of Maktus will give you advice,” she said.</p>
<p>“Hm? Me?” When Adele answered, not only Selena’s, but all the other ladies’ eyes widened.</p>
<p>Everyone knew who her husband was.</p>
<p>If that man only had an extremely good-looking face, the women in the empire might’ve still been able to endure. But that truly wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>Adele’s husband was a tall and valiant knight, as well as a wealthy and powerful individual. All these facts combined together made the ladies, both wed and unwed, unable to peacefully sleep at night with envy, regret, and longing.</p>
<p>Naturally, they would also wonder how he behaved at night, but they weren’t close with Adele so they couldn’t ask her outright.</p>
<p>When Adele hesitated, the others immediately encouraged.</p>
<p>“If the duchess can enlighten Selena with her story, the young miss would definitely be able to lead a fulfilling married life.”</p>
<p>“Oh… that. The first night—err… well…” Adele blushed and fanned her face with her hands.</p>
<p>The lady sitting next to her beckoned her maid to pour champagne into her empty glass. Adele took the filled cup and drank quickly.</p>
<p>Nervous, she started to speak. “You don’t have to be afraid…”</p>
<p>All the noble ladies, even the maids, listened to her attentively.</p>
<p>“F-from my experience… he will worship your body and use his touch to show you how much he adores you. Err—from the start, a newly wed woman would have no idea what to do next, but he will guide you gently. Even if you choose to remain still, he… will do everything to make you feel better.”</p>
<p>Then she added, “It also doesn’t hurt when… w-when he… puts <em>it </em>inside. And, as time goes by… it will eventually get better.”</p>
<p>Feeling mortified, Adele could only gulp down her drink.</p>
<p>The ladies frowned as they recalled their first night.</p>
<p>The man shall take care of everything?</p>
<p>They remembered their own respective first nights, back when their spouses had only satiated their own lust by inserting themselves without even properly arousing their new wives. As for loving their body and trying to make them feel better? These females experienced none of that during their first times.</p>
<p>And what did she say again? It doesn’t hurt and would only get better? Doesn’t that mean that Duke Maktus’ bed skills are on a godly level?</p>
<p>It was so unbelievable that the room immediately quietened down.</p>
