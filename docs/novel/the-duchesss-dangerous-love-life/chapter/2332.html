            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 25</strong></p>
<p>He remained silent and kept on cutting away at the stems. Adele felt him speeding up, so she just kept her mouth shut and followed after him. A long journey later, a large garden and a castle came into view. In front was Madame Maktus, whom she met last time.</p>
<p>As Madame Maktus saw the two familiar figures her, she hurried over and took Adele’s hand.</p>
<p><em>‘Miss Adele!’</em> She enthusiastically uttered.</p>
<p><em>‘Madame, nice meeting you again.’ </em>She offered a short curtsy and smiled.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh, how can you be this sweet? My apologies dear, I seem to have forgotten that the maid assigned to you will not be present today and was just about to tell the other servants to find you. When they said they couldn’t see hide nor hair of you, I panicked.” </em>Expressed the madam as she put a hand over her chest in worry. <em>‘Therefore, it’s such a relief that you have arrived safely. Ah, Noah, did you guide Miss Adele?’</em></p>
<p>The man called as Noah nodded his head.</p>
<p><em>‘But mother,’ </em>he started,<em> ‘what do you mean by ‘fiancée’?’</em></p>
<p><em>Mother?</em></p>
<p>Shocked, Adele stared at the man who accompanied her all this while.</p>
<p><em>He called Madame Maktus his mother, is this person my soon-to-be-husband?</em> Adele blushed at the thought.</p>
<p>He was handsome and tall with big strong arms. He didn’t speak much, but she thought it was fine. She could tell he was a kind person.</p>
<p>Adele looked at him and bowed her head coyly as their eyes met. Madame Maktus smiled and motioned behind her.</p>
<p><em>‘Enon! Come here. Your bride has arrived.’</em></p>
<p><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>Adele immediately became flustered as she looked behind Madame Maktus.</p>
<p>A man of a short, small stature and ordinary appearance came running from a distance.</p>
<p>What she was expecting… wasn’t this.</p>
<p>Disappointed, she turned her head and met Noah’s gaze. He frowned, but Madame Maktus just smiled.</p>
<p><em>‘Noah, you should also greet her. Her name is Adellia Liliand, your soon-to-be sister-in-law.’</em></p>
<p>At her words, his scowl became even worse, <em>‘So you’re telling me that she is my brother’s bride?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Yes.’</em> His mother replied, unaware of her son’s tumultuous thoughts.</p>
<p><em>‘Why should he even get married?’</em></p>
<p>Madame Maktus quickly spun her head towards Noah after hearing his words.</p>
<p><em>‘O-of course he should get married, it is only right and proper for a man to wed a woman when he is of age.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘How?’ </em>Noah pressed, displeasure written all over his face,<em> ‘He’s a—’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Be quiet!’ </em>She hastily cut off his words.</p>
<p>At his mother’s warning, Noah shook his head. <em>‘So, this was the surprising news you told me about.’</em></p>
<p>Adele hesitated, somewhat frightened by Noah’s irritated expression when he said those words.</p>
<p>Madame Maktus glanced at her and patted her shoulder with a strained smile. <em>‘It’s not a big deal. Do not worry about it.’ </em>comforted the madame, <em>‘Miss Adele, meet my second son, Noah. He will be your brother-in-law in the future.’</em></p>
<p><em>Future brother-in-law…</em> Adele mused, but she responded anyway.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah, yes. Nice to meet you, Noah—no, brother-in-law.’</em></p>
<p>Contrary to her expectations, Noah laughed despite the circumstances. Then he stared at her with an intense and unflinching gaze.</p>
<p><em>‘Don’t call me brother-in-law.’</em></p>
<p>There were no other words exchanged as Noah turned around unexpectedly and walked away. Adele couldn’t understand Noah’s sudden cold attitude. <em>Why was he suddenly like this? He was so kind earlier. Could it be that he didn’t want me entering into his family?</em></p>
<p>She clasped her trembling hands and quietly looked at his retreating back.</p>
<p>Then she remembered his eyes that used to stare at her with such a kind expression…</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“What happened? Do your feet hurt?”</p>
<p>Adele, who was in the midst of reminiscing her memories, looked ahead and found that Noah was staring at her. She halted her steps to think for a moment then shook her head. At her action, Noah looked at her feet.</p>
<p>“Tell me if it hurts.” Then he thought of a something and said to her softly, “Do you want me to carry you?”</p>
<p>“I… can walk by myself.”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head once more and Noah grabbed her hand. Thanks to him guiding her upwards, she climbed the hill with ease.</p>
<p>A flat, soft field and a large zelkova tree emerged. He grinned and pointed his chin behind her. “Take a look behind you.”</p>
<p>When she turned around, the wonderful view of the castle unfolded before her eyes as a sea of clouds slowly parted to reveal its majesty. It was a truly stunning sight.</p>
<p>“Wow! It’s so beautiful.” She exclaimed as she felt the refreshing breeze blowing across her delicate skin and smelt the unique fragrance of the forest revitalizing her senses.</p>
<p>“I usually come here by myself.”</p>
<p>Adele stared at him in gratitude, “You have revealed to me your special place. Thank you.”</p>
<p>She smiled brightly and Noah quickly turned his head. He took off the black cloak from his shoulders and laid it over the grass.</p>
<p>“Sit here.”</p>
<p>Adele blinked her eyes at the kind gesture she rarely received.</p>
<p>As if wanting to give an explanation for his actions, he reasoned, “You don’t like your dress getting dirty.”</p>
<p>He paid attention even to the small details back when he guided her in the past. Adele looked at the brook in the distance and grinned. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Noah picked up the ranges from her basket and handed it to her.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you.”</p>
<p>“How many times have you been saying ‘thank you’ today?”</p>
<p>Adele smiled shyly and didn’t answer. Noah took a bite of the sandwich she made.</p>
<p>Seeing this, she carefully asked. “Does the taste suit you well?”</p>
<p>“How did you hurt your hands?” came his sudden question.</p>
<p><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>“Oh.” Adele lowered her fingers at Noah’s question. “It has been a long time since I last prepared food.”</p>
<p>He furrowed his eyebrows in disapproval, his gaze remaining on that small wound. Adele eyed him and then pivoted her gaze elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Be more careful while cooking in the future.” Then his frown disappeared, and he repeated in a pleased voice. “Yes, be careful. This body isn’t only yours anymore.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?” Unable to grasp the underlying meaning of his words, Adele stared at him with a foolish expression.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Noah smirked deviously, a somewhat conniving smile emerged from his lips.</p>
