            <p><strong>Chapter 136</strong></p>
<p>Seeing Noah gripping the hem of the blanket tightly, Adele blinked her eyes and smirked.</p>
<p>“Pfft.”</p>
<p>Hearing her snickering out of nowhere, he felt mystified, “Why are you laughing?”</p>
<p>“You….”</p>
<p><em>Look at you, the exact same as you were last time.</em></p>
<p>Adele laughed as she remembered the time when 12-year-old Noah threw her fiancée into a pond. She seemed to understand why he was reacting this way and found it so adorable that his emotions were currently so plain to see.</p>
<p>She tidied Noah’s messy hair a little bit.</p>
<p>His muscles were taut, but he gradually calmed down through Adele’s delicate and affectionate touch. He closed his eyes at the novel feeling, looking like a large dog that had turned docile in the hands of his gentle owner.</p>
<p>Adele noticed that the fringes had become longer now and would block his vision, so she said, “I think it’s time for you to trim your hair agai—<em>ahhhh!</em>”</p>
<p>She was abruptly pushed down onto the bed.</p>
<p>Noah lifted one of her legs. He began biting and licking from her calf all the way up to her thigh in an agonizingly slow fashion that Adele couldn’t help but let out her moans.</p>
<p>He then said in a low voice, “I can do better.”</p>
<p>“Huh? W-what?”</p>
<p>“I can do better than my brother.”</p>
<p>Noah avoided contact with her eyes and kept his face down. Then he shoved his face between her thighs and started licking her wet genitals with his hot tongue. Adele was startled and raised her torso, but his large hand gently pressed against her to put her back down.</p>
<p>When his tongue boldly licked and sucked up to her labia, a moan came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Her body shuddered, “S-stop—<em>ugh!</em>”</p>
<p>Noah was insistent with his actions and continued claiming her genitals with his tongue, even as Adele struggled and pulled at Noah’s hair.</p>
<p>He remembered his weak and feeble older brother and was confident that he could outperform him since his condition is so much better than him.</p>
<p>Thinking of how his brother’s body must’ve possessed her and those scandalous objects that he had accidentally seen when he was young, Noah began stimulating her by pressing on the flesh of her half-lifted leg.</p>
<p>“Ah! D-don’t press that!”</p>
<p>“But… I want to.”</p>
<p>“Uh, what?”</p>
<p>“We can do this, right? We’re a couple.”</p>
<p><em>Didn’t you say earlier that you said you won’t do it without permission?!</em></p>
<p>Adele was stunned, unable to speak. As soon as he began sucking hard again, she gasped lightly.</p>
<p>Having been with him for a lot more than a year, she was aware of his reactions as well.</p>
<p>At this point, she anticipated that his member would become erect and he would be at a loss in what to do.</p>
<p>She took a peek below.</p>
<p>As expected, the veins on his appendage were already throbbing so much and he was ramrod straight. Adele stretched her legs out, barely making it to her toes to touch the tip of his pen*s.</p>
<p>Then, she gently toyed with it.</p>
<p>“Urgh!”</p>
<p>Noah quickly turned his face away and looked up at her as they locked gazes with each other. When she met his desperate eyes, Adele’s whole body tingled. It was the appearance of a young man, with a mixture of innocence and passion in those clear and intoxicated eyes.</p>
<p>She felt that she had somehow overexcited herself. It was because she, who was always calm, was at a loss for what to do with his gestures and words. Her strange self-confidence sprang up from nowhere and she subsequently wrapped her legs around his waist and pulled him closer.</p>
<p>“I want you inside me.”</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>“You can do it.”</p>
<p>Noah was dazed in disbelief, then came to his senses when she went down and rubbed at his glans. Soon, she grabbed her pelvis and brought his engorged member to her entrance.</p>
<p>Adele reached out and pressed her hand against his shoulder. “Slowly.”</p>
<p>“…I know…”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>“Darn it! Won’t it hurt? You’re not too loos—I mean, you’re too tight.”</p>
<p>When Adele nodded her head, indicating it was okay, Noah directly plunged himself deeper into her. He gritted his teeth in pleasure when he felt her inner walls tightened around him.</p>
<p>He just looked down at her.</p>
<p>Adele asked a question upon seeing the disbelieving expression in his eyes, “W-what?”</p>
<p>“I just can’t… believe it.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Just yesterday, I was still on the battlefield…”</p>
<p>Adele remembered that he had told stories of what happened on the battlefield once in a while. When he was 17, he was in charge of an abandoned army because of the checks of the families that already had the Knights Templar.</p>
<p>He was still living in a time of war that he was just experiencing for the first time.</p>
<p>He must’ve been mentally devastated after that, perhaps even more by some events that followed. He was pitiful.</p>
<p>Noah spoke, “My colleagues disappeared one by one. All the men who were older than me… they all died.”</p>
<p>Adele reached out her hand and stroked his cheek.</p>
<p>“It must have been painful.”</p>
<p>“It was much more difficult than just that…” he blankly answered and became slightly lost in thought, “…there’s something more difficult than that…”</p>
<p>This time Noah gently felt a gentle touch on his cheek. Holding it with one hand, he tenderly kissed her palm.</p>
<p>She slowly began moving her waist.</p>
<p>Her insides were soaked to the brim and seamlessly allowed entrance for Noah’s thick pen*s to penetrate deep into her.</p>
