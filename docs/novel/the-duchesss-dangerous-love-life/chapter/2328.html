            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 29</strong></p>
<p><em>Sigh.</em></p>
<p>Adele was embarrassed. She was flattered by his touch and words, but pretended she wasn’t. She was already 32 years old for heaven’s sake! Old enough to understand even if she had no prior experience with men.</p>
<p>Those eyes that used to look at her coldly suddenly changed into warm, loving eyes. He became overly caring, which was so unlike him. But now she knew, it was all an act to keep his promise to his deceased brother.</p>
<p>Her heart thumped because of his sweet and thoughtful actions, unaware that all of it were just pretenses. She felt like an idiot.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, she thought it was strange and suspicious. He didn’t even treat her like a sister-in-law for the past two years, there was no reason for a man to suddenly change overnight. But if it was because of Enon’s request, then everything would make sense.</p>
<p><em>‘Bear my child.’<br>
</em><br>
She now understood the meaning behind those words. If she became pregnant within this month, the child might be suspected of becoming Enon’s child. Of course, only Enon and Adele knew that Enon was impotent, everyone else was none the wiser and should remain that way.</p>
<p>This, she can leave the duke’s family as Noah’s sister-in-law who bore his brother’s child, rather than live as his wife. Then she will be free, she could get married again as well…</p>
<p>Adele touched her head. <em>Is it really the only way?</em> It was complicated, but it was the only logical conclusion she reached after some careful deliberation.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“As I mentioned, split the money for tax.”</p>
<p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
<p>Noah rubbed his eyes with a tired look. The ever-astute butler, James, tactfully withdrew from the office. The maids who were about to dry his recently washed hair also quickly scuttled outside.</p>
<p>When Noah entered the bedroom, he thought his vision deceived him. “I didn’t expect you to be here.”</p>
<p>Adele was inside, wordlessly sitting on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>He leaned against the door. “You didn’t come here because you want to have s*x, right?”</p>
<p>Adele lowered her head and replied. “You told me.”</p>
<p>“Told you what?”</p>
<p>“That a husband may enter the wife’s room without permission.” Adele gripped the hem of the thin-laced lingerie she was wearing. She looked like a bashful woman exposed in front of her unrequited love.</p>
<p>The sight gave him a strange sensation, Noah ran his hands through her loosely tied hair.</p>
<p>She felt his touch and raised her head to look at him. Noah was in a good mood, his lips quirked up slightly.</p>
<p><em>Maybe he’s pretending to be happy even though he isn’t</em>. Adele was about to tell him that he didn’t need to act anymore but ended up asking something else instead.</p>
<p>“I have something to ask you.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Why did you marry me?”</p>
<p>At Adele’s words, the hand that was touching her light brown hair stopped. Noah went to the table and poured the wine, “Didn’t you like what happened?”</p>
<p>“I know you have your reasons.”</p>
<p>Noah didn’t speak for a while. Adele was convinced as she watched him drink his wine. She knew it. She miserably bit her lip as she took his silence as confirmation.</p>
<p>She couldn’t do anything about the fact that they were already married. She could though, find a way to free them from each other. Adele touched her belly.</p>
<p>Noah saw her faintly quivering figure and opened his mouth. “You’re like a child sold to the war barracks.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>He took a swig of the wine, “Girls under fifteen spread their legs in the barracks on the battlefield.”</p>
<p>Noah changed the subject unnaturally, but Adele’s eyes widened at his terrible words.</p>
<p>“Did… did you sleep with them?”</p>
<p>His fixed his gaze into hers, “I killed them.”</p>
<p>His hand, which had been touching her light brown hair, went down and stroked her white face. Adele felt his touch and fiddled with her hands.</p>
<p>“I killed whoever slept with young girls in my battalion by beheading them.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“They weren’t in their right minds if they get aroused by little girls.”</p>
<p>Noah spoke softly and pulled the band that tied her light brown hair. Adele’s luscious strands ran down her pale face.</p>
<p>Back then, she always tried to look more mature by tying her hair neatly. All this time, to protect the dignity of the lady, she had worn things that did not suit her. But now, it was different.</p>
<p>The soft tendrils framed her face, making her look younger than she actually was.</p>
<p>Noah caressed her cheek, “What should I do? I can’t find it within me to be aroused when you look this young. Too young.”</p>
<p>Adele, who was about to say she already knew everything earlier but hesitated afterwards, found that Noah’s thing was slightly bulging out. Her eyes widened, she thought everything was an act, but it seems that his sexual desire was the same.</p>
<p>Her face blushed, she raised her head and looked at him. He was wearing a soft smile while staring her. Heart pounding, Adele grabbed her chest. She replied sharply, “Don’t mess around, I am already thirty-two.”</p>
<p>“But still very much like a virgin.”</p>
<p>Adele bit her lip at his remark. On the other hand, Noah kept a smile on his lips.</p>
<p>“Tell me.” He took a step closer, “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>Adele turned her head without saying a word. She took a deep breath and prepared the words in her heart. <em>‘I heard about your conversation with Enon. You don’t need to act anymore.’</em></p>
<p>But they couldn’t come out of her mouth. Meanwhile, Noah kissed her hair.</p>
<p>“Peonies?” he queried, noticing the change in scent.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Does it smell good?”</p>
<p>“It smells tempting. I just might get an er3ction soon.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say—” At the embarrassing words, Adele let out a breath. Noah turned his back on the red candle and looked strangely pleased.</p>
<p>“Shall I guess?” He said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Are you in need of money?”</p>
<p>She felt indignant at his words. She wasn’t after his money, at all! Adele tried to say no, but somehow her mouth felt like it was sealed shut.</p>
<p>As she paused, Noah sat down on the bed. He soon hugged her waist from behind. He rubbed his lips against her ear and on the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>“How much do you need?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Say, a hundred thousand? A million?” then he leaned in with a slightly husky voice laced with desire. “Say whatever you want.”</p>
