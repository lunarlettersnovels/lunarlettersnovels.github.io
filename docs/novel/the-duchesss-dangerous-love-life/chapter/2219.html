            <p><strong>Chapter 138</strong></p>
<p>Noah held the top of his head, feeling an intense headache bombarding his brain. Alarmed, Adele quickly approached him.</p>
<p>But Noah immediately enveloped her in a hug. He then murmured as he saw memories go through his mind. “I wasn’t serious…”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Noah was silent for a second, then spoke, “I’m just a little upset. You kept thinking of my brother.”</p>
<p>“What are you sayi—”</p>
<p>“You’re my woman now. <em>My wife.</em>” he stressed, but then he frowned, “But my mind still says to me that you are my brother’s wife, and the thought just makes me so angry.”</p>
<p>Adele was about to refute his words when she suddenly thought about an incident a few years ago.</p>
<p>After she had married him, Adele thought he only wanted to impregnate her because of his supposed promise with Enon. Angered by her thoughts, Noah spat out some words of ridicule.</p>
<p>Hearing his mocking tone, she too became indignant and slapped him in the face.</p>
<p>When Adele later asked why he said those words back then, Noah simply kissed her and turned his back to her. He didn’t answer, that’s why Adele still didn’t know. As it turns out, he was actually jealous and just didn’t want to speak because it would seem pretty childish.</p>
<p>Adele sighed. She felt his arms snaking around her waist and hugging her tightly, stroking her head on instinct. Melting into his touch, she slowly succumbed to his request. “Alright, I won’t go.”</p>
<p>“…sorry.”</p>
<p>“Whatever it is you’re thinking about, it’s all in the past. Instead,” she craned her neck to look up at him, “never do that again.”</p>
<p>Noah looked into her eyes, then gave her a small nod. Adele glanced at him adorably and let out a sigh.</p>
<p><em>How can he manage to look so cute even at a moment like this?</em></p>
<p>Adele sighed again and slowly got up. Feeling her coming out of his embrace, Noah was startled and hurriedly took hold of her arm.</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>She glanced at him amusedly, “Water, or else I’d die of thirst.”</p>
<p>“Oh…” he hurriedly put his hand down. A sheepish expression crossed his face when he realized he was acting like a child.</p>
<p>But to his defense, she said she wouldn’t leave, but she’s already gone outside the room.Noah glanced at the half-open door with a disgruntled look, like a bullied husband. When his head started hurting again, he pressed his fingers against his forehead.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, his memories began to come to mind one by one, as if poking through his head.</p>
<p>Adele heard Noah’s groan and was so worried that she immediately rushed into the bedroom, tray in hand. She saw him leaning against the wall with his head bowed and she handed him a cup of water, which he drank all in a few gulps.</p>
<p>Frowning, she asked, “Does your head hurt a lot?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay… It’s just that,” Noah put his cup down on the tabletop and hugged her tightly. “I’m confused.”</p>
<p>“About?”</p>
<p>“I keep thinking about this and that, and my thoughts feel like my enemy…”</p>
<p>Adele cupped his face into her palms, “What should I do? Should I tell the maids to bring some soothing medicine or sleeping pills? Wait he—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Noah stopped her from trying to call the servant. He then buried his face into her chest and said in a low, slightly pleading voice. “Comfort me?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“…can’t you?”</p>
<p>Noah lifted his head and looked at her. His eyes that were wet with unshed tears made her chest heavy.</p>
<p>How pitiful.</p>
<p><em>He must be so confused right now, but I don’t blame him. I’d be like that if I was him too, maybe even worse.</em></p>
<p>Adele patted the back of his head and the two of them laid down softly on the bed. But this small action exposed her chest through her loose slips.</p>
<p>Tempted, Noah began sucking on her bare breasts.</p>
<p>Surprised, Adele tried to restrain him, but then he looked at her so pitifully that she could only helplessly touch his shoulder. Strangely enough, he sucked quite hard and seemed very skillful in stimulating her nipples.</p>
<p>Just like the Noah she knew.</p>
<p>“Mmn…” she moaned, ”H-how can I comfort you?”</p>
<p>He grunted, “Just… tell me how I am with you.”</p>
<p><em>Lick, lick.</em></p>
<p>“Mmm… You… you were… ”</p>
<p>“I was what?” he gently urged.</p>
<p>“You’re very… affectionate and a wonderful husband.”</p>
<p>As Noah sucked on her breast and playfully nipped on it, Adele felt a jolt run through her nerves and she slapped him on the shoulder. He opened his mouth and this time, licked her adorable belly.</p>
<p>“Next question.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“How am I at night?”</p>
<p>“Maybe you—” Feeling stunned, Adele paused to look at him, “Did your memories come back?”</p>
<p>When Noah saw her glance at him imploringly, he hesitated and eventually sighed. “They seem to be coming back little by little. It’s still not complete though, and the memories are all mixed up…”</p>
<p>“Oh my!” Her heart trembled slightly as she touched him, and the worry in her mind escalated.</p>
<p>He asked.</p>
<p>“I… Have I been cruel to you?”</p>
<p>“Ah…?” Adele thought back to a year ago, when they still didn’t know each other’s feelings and during the first times they slept together and uttered in a low voice tinged with regret. “You… were. Although, that was only until I knew what you felt for me.”</p>
<p>The corners of his lips turned downwards, doubt clouding his face. Adele was quick to reassure him.</p>
<p>“Either way, you don’t have to worry about that anymore.”</p>
