            <p><strong>Chapter 45 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Adele groaned in pleasure.</p>
<p>“I only played with my fingers and you’re already so wet.”</p>
<p><em>“Ugh.”</em></p>
<p>Noah’s fingers touched the entrance and slipped inside. He pressed his thumb against her clitoris and circled his two fingers inside.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Noah’s fingers ran inside her tight walls. She let out a moan and her legs shuddered. He grinned as he watched the liquid flowing down his fingers.</p>
<p>“You like being fingered, is it?”</p>
<p>With her blurring mind, Adele only nodded and lowered her hand to grab Noah’s hardened penis.</p>
<p>“Do something sexy for me…”</p>
<p>The smile on Noah’s face disappeared. He bit his lip and furrowed his eyebrows, his face constrained like he was holding something in.</p>
<p>“What should I do?”</p>
<p>She hardened her grip on his manhood.</p>
<p>Noah groaned, he drew closer and licked the back of Adele’s ears.</p>
<p>“Should I f*ck you hard?”</p>
<p>He rubbed his pen!s against Adele’s wetness. She felt the heat emanating from below and twisted her body. Noah made her wrap her legs around his waist to keep her from moving. The tip of her finger touched Noah’s.</p>
<p>“Then say it.”</p>
<p>Adele was gasping for breath, “P-put…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Her face flushed and she looked at Noah, then gently lowered her head. “Put…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Put it in…”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>Adele bit her lip and shook her head in annoyance. She was like a cute shivering child, but Noah didn’t care. As he grabbed her backside and rubbed her sensitive spot with his thumb, Adele parted her mouth and moaned louder.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Where do you want me to put it in.”</p>
<p>“Down here…”</p>
<p>A dangerous glint flash through his eyes, “You want me to f*ck you? Here?”</p>
<p>Adele closed her eyes and nodded in shame. Noah rubbed his painfully erect pen!s against her clitoris even harder. His constant stimulation made her more and more exhilarated.</p>
<p><em>A little more, a little more. Not like this, not outside, it should enter inside me… please… </em>Adele raised her nails and grabbed his broad shoulders.</p>
<p>“Please!”</p>
<p>He flicked his fingers that was inside of her, and Adele could only gasp at the pleasurable feeling.</p>
<p>“Speak properly, what do you want?”</p>
<p>“F-faster, h-here…”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p><em>Ah, faster…</em> As the irritation showed on Adele’s face, Noah stopped moving and he glanced at her. He gently pushed himself back so that his member wouldn’t make contact with her nether lips. Then he looked up at her intently.</p>
<p>Adele whined, and Noah tenderly kissed her on the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>“Say it, Adele.”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>“There’s no use if you keep on throwing tantrums.”</p>
<p>Adele bit her lip and glared at him, then stretched out her hand. She grabbed Noah’s meat and pulled it gently with onto her wet entrance.</p>
<p>“Please put your… in here—<em>ah!</em>”</p>
<p>As soon as Adele finished speaking, Noah penetrated her immediately. He fit snugly inside her, and Adele felt instantly full. She tilted her head, when she thought that this would make her feel pleasure, her inner walls contracted.</p>
<p>Noah furrowed his brows as he felt her tightening around his shaft.</p>
<p>“So, you’ve made up your mind to do it rough.” He chuckled deviously.</p>
<p>“Ah?” came her confused reply amid her panting breaths.</p>
<p>“If you keep on doing that, I just might lose that little bit of control I have left.”</p>
<p>Normally, he would thrust into her like crazy, but she wasn’t in her right mind because of the drug. He had to be careful.</p>
<p>Instead of moving his waist, Noah hand made contact with Adele’s now lukewarm body, “Your body still needs to be touched.”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>Adele looked at Noah and straightened her bent upper body, revealing her plump chest. He smiled and fondled her chest with his warm hand. At the same time, his lower body began to move.</p>
<p>“Ah, uh!”</p>
<p>He moved his member, gently stroking the inner wall. He wanted her to feel a little warmer. But above all, because she was intoxicated, her insides were soaked, soft and incredibly tight. Adele whimpered softly as Noah kept on thrusting inside her.</p>
<p>It was driving her crazy. He was so slow!</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head and leaned forward. As her chest drew closer to him, he grinned.</p>
<p>“I’ll suck it for you.”</p>
<p>As Noah lapped at it and bit her round breasts, Adele flinched. Soon after, she looked straight at him with her tear-brimmed eyes. She caressed Noah’s face and started moving her ass up and down.</p>
<p>He saw Adele moving and swallowing up her own liquid and crossed the line that Noah had been trying so hard to keep.</p>
<p>Between ragged breaths, he said out loud, “If you planned to make me lose my mind, you have succeeded, Adellia.”</p>
<p>He grabbed her waist and started intensely ramming against her like a beast.</p>
<p>The dangerous thing about weakening drugs was that they were more intense than regular drugs. Noah looked down at the woman underneath him, clasped her in his arms and squeezed her ass.</p>
<p>As his shaft became drenched and he slipped into her vagina, she moved her body on her own. They were connected as one in the most humanly way possible, with a part of him inside of her.</p>
<p>Love fluids flowed between her thighs.</p>
<p>“Ah, uh, huh!”</p>
<p>“My wife, relax. Okay? Don’t squeeze me so tightly.”</p>
<p>A bit of tension left Adele’s body.</p>
<p><em>That’s right.</em> Noah put his hands on Adele’s breast that had now decreased in temperature and played with it. He rubbed her nipples with his fingers, pressed his wrists under her armpits, and she uncontrollably clenched herself down there.</p>
<p>Noah inhaled sharply, his voice thick with desire, “Do you like my pen!s that much?”</p>
<p>When Adele shook her head, Noah grinned and pulled himself out, then put them back in abruptly.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie to me. I know you like it.”</p>
<p>An intense pleasure dominated her senses. Adele tilted her head back and slightly parted her mouth in tears. Noah put his tongue between her lips and teased her for a while, then drew away. He grabbed her pelvis and pounded against her just as hard as before.</p>
<p>Like a beast.</p>
