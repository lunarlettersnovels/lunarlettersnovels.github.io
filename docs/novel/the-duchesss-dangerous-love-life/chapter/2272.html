            <p><strong>Chapter 85 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>His member went so deep inside of her. She felt her whole body getting ruined him, her soul too. She was even questioning her personal character, as it was also in the verge of ruin because of him.</p>
<p><em>I’ve become so naughty.</em></p>
<p>“Hoo… I’m ruined, n-no…”</p>
<p>Noah laughed lowly, “My dear, you are the one ruining me.”</p>
<p>“Ah, n-no, s-stop…”</p>
<p>Adele was really worried that her body will get wrecked because of this. She was worried as her vagina kept on feeling the pleasure and excitement. Guessing her thoughts, Noah caressed her abdomen with his large hand and whispered into her ears.</p>
<p>“Should I destroy you thoroughly?”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head in desperation, she can’t do it anymore.</p>
<p>“Mn. You’ll feel better.”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head yet again. She really felt that she won’t be able to handle it any further, ah!</p>
<p>As Adele cried, Noah licked her tears with his tongue. “Don’t worry. At worst, your body will just become one that won’t be able to live without my touch.”</p>
<p>She didn’t shake her head this time. Adele turned around and could barely even speak while holding back her screams. “I-I’m already—”</p>
<p>“Damn, stop talking.” He felt like he was going crazy.</p>
<p>He already <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Noah lifted her leg and wrapped his arm around her waist then started to f*ck her so hard that even dull thudding sounds could be heard. Adele’s breathed grew more ragged and cried out even louder as he plunged deeper and deeper inside of her that she never thought was possible before.</p>
<p><em>Too deep, ah!</em></p>
<p>“Ah, uh, ah…”</p>
<p>Adele tried to push him away as she felt her stomach getting filled by him. But she was too weak at the moment.</p>
<p>Not that she was ever strong enough in the first place to make him budge.</p>
<p>Unbothered, Noah massaged her stomach with his hand. “Do you want me to cum inside you?”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head strongly.</p>
<p>Noah’s expression darkened for a brief second. “You told me you liked it before, you even urged me to impregnate you.”</p>
<p>Adele almost cried in lament.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t in my right mind at that time—<em>ah!”</em></p>
<p>“It’ll be your punishment then.” Noah poked hard at her sensitive spot and abruptly cut off her words. Adele’s mind came to a screeching halt as she had lost consciousness for a moment. A shudder made her come to her senses and she slipped down.</p>
<p>Noah turned her body while still inside of her and he gently pulled it out to ejaculate on her white, plump stomach.</p>
<p>Seeing her blushing face, gasping with every breath that caused her chest to heave up and down as she looked up at him with teary eyes…</p>
<p>Noah felt himself orgasming just from the sheer sight alone.</p>
<p>“My woman.” He uttered, making a sweeping motion on her body with the tips of his fingers. <em>“My wife.”</em></p>
<p>A feeling of joy and excitement that couldn’t be put into words overcame her. Before, they were only one with the body, but now…</p>
<p>Adele, seeing Noah’s satisfied gaze, reached out her hand and carefully stroked his cheek. “My… my husband.”</p>
<p>She had finally decided to accept Noah as her husband, Enon had even requested that. To tell the truth, she actually did not… dislike him.</p>
<p>Instead…</p>
<p>As Adele’s cheeks turned red, Noah closed his eyes deeply, placing a kiss on her chest where her heart lay.</p>
<p>Adele smiled weakly, stood up and subsequently stumbled on a wooden post.</p>
<p>The rain had already stopped</p>
<p>The pole that was wet caused her body slip off a wall. Noah carried her and gently laid her on the grass. Adele felt that the grass was too cold, so she climbed onto him, catching her breath.</p>
<p>The feeling of intimate pleasure persisted for a long time.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, Adele lifted her head when she heard the sound of the wind brushing through the leaves. Everywhere she looked, it was as if a beautiful sight unfolded in front of her.</p>
<p>It felt like her entire being was merged with nature. She could taste freedom, contentment, and being uninhibited.</p>
<p>It felt so good. What had she been living for all this while?</p>
<p>Adele looked at her left hand’s ring finger. She wasn’t wearing her wedding ring.</p>
<p>She felt guilty and Noah saw her expression.</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong?”</p>
<p>She shook her head, not wanting to ruin the moment. From her peripheral vision, she saw a forget-me-not plant near a well by the end of the field.</p>
<p>Noah could hear a faint whisper of the words ‘how pretty’ after Adele reached out her hand and plucked them.</p>
<p>He stroked her hair dotingly, “My duchess is so delicate, you can even see these little things as pretty.”</p>
<p>“It <em>is</em> pretty.” She defended, “Look at this.”</p>
