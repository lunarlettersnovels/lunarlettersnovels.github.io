            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 19 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Adele complied and opened her eyes at his command, Noah gave a satisfied smile, “Wrap your legs around my waist.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>A smirked graced his features, “It’s easier to enter you that way.”</p>
<p>Adele bit her lip, nervous of the pleasure that was about to come and Noah was pleased with her reaction.</p>
<p>“I know you’ve been waiting for it.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“There’s no use in denying it, you’re already so wet.”</p>
<p>He just knew, her body wanted it. That <em>she</em> wanted it.</p>
<p>Adele’s body trembled even more. Her b0ssom that had become redder after being played with, shook as he started penetrating deeper inside of her. He rubbed her luscious bre@sts and suckled on them.</p>
<p><em>Smooch, smooch.</em> Adele fisted her hands at Noah’s hair, sensing the oncoming pleasure.</p>
<p>“Wait, stop!”</p>
<p>“Stop? You want me to stop?” came his teasing voice. Then his member unsheathed itself completely and went back in at once, hitting deep inside of her womb. Adele felt that he probably even reached her stomach.</p>
<p>He wasn’t finished speaking, “I know you want more.”</p>
<p>“Stop confusing me!”</p>
<p>“Tell me you want me.”</p>
<p>Adele bit her lip in shame and turned her head. Noah raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“You know what happens to a person who lies in Astria, right?”</p>
<p>As Adele’s eyes widened, a loud slap was heard. Noah continued to stroke her butt with his large hand. Adele, shocked by his sudden actions, felt her core tightening and clenching at the tingling sensation.</p>
<p>“Ah! You’re so tight.” He groaned, feeling her inner walls clamping down tightly around his member.</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>Once again, Noah slapped her bottom and Adele shook her head as her eyes turned glossy. He gently wiped her damp cheeks with his hands as he continued moving inside of her with his throbbing member.</p>
<p>He started pounding onto her hard, slapping sounds could be heard every now and then. Moments later, she quivered with des!re and could barely breathe.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Adele let out a moan and closed her eyes. Noah smirked and poured kisses onto her lips as he kept thrusting into her. As he pulled himself out, thick s3men flowed. Noah took Adele’s hand, and stretched his hand under her. “I won.”</p>
<p><em>Huh? </em>Adele’s thoughts were still in disarray therefore, she couldn’t fully make out his words as her fluids continued to spill out from her.</p>
<p>He chuckled as she gasped for breath, “What? Still trying to get them all out?”</p>
<p>Adele tried to get her hand back, but Noah wouldn’t let her go. He gently caressed her stomach and instead, addressed another issue.</p>
<p>“So, now do you admit?”</p>
<p>She didn’t reply.</p>
<p>“The fact that you have a promiscuous body?”</p>
<p>Adele tried to push him away. He furrowed his eyebrows and abruptly spoke, “Bear my child.”</p>
<p>“What?!” Adele lifted her head up and stared at him. Noah lowered his head and whispered.</p>
<p>“It is my wish.”</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p>“For you to be the mother of my child.”</p>
<p>Hearing something she couldn’t even begin to comprehend, Adele stared at him incredulously. Noah’s eyelashes fluttered, seemingly anxious.</p>
<p><em>Why would he be anxious?</em> Adele looked at him and hesitantly turned her head away.</p>
<p>This time, Noah was successfully pushed aside.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At the second floor of the hall, Adele sat at the sofa while having a sip of tea. This was to calm her heart that had been confused these past few days. During this time, Lina walked in from the entrance of the hall with a letter and a basket in hand and called her.</p>
<p>“Milady, there is a letter for you.”</p>
<p>“A letter? But I am not expecting any. Are you sure you aren’t mistaken?”</p>
<p>Lina said no as she gave the letter to Adele. It was engraved with her family name. She opened it quickly and instead of her father, it contained someone else’s handwriting. She thought it was quite strange.</p>
<p><em>「Miss Adele, have you been doing well? I apologize as I have only been able to write back today. The urgent matter regarding the family has been settled thanks to the funds sent by the head of the Maktus family. I wrote this letter because master might not have been able to convey the situation properly due to his negative frame of mind.</em></p>
<p><em>In order to express our sincere appreciation to Mr. Maktus, we have procured the most expensive and superior-quality items to be gifted to him. We hope that you accept our heartfelt gratitude. 」</em></p>
<p>“Milady, the letter came together with presents. They seemed to be jewels, and I am still uncertain about the others inside the basket.” Lina gave her the jewelry box and basket. Adele opened the jewelry box first.</p>
<p>Inside were three pink diamonds the size of a baby’s fist, each one wrapped in a delicate cloth. As she opened the basket, she found that they contained oranges; round, fresh, and fragrant.</p>
<p>“Oh, oranges.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” Lina, who grew up in the capital, did not know what these were.</p>
<p>This was a fruit that was difficult to find, even for the royal family. They didn’t even grow in Astria as it was hard to cultivate them due to geographical conditions. People had to travel across the continent to be even able to buy them.</p>
<p>Since oranges were occasionally grown in her mother’s hometown from another country, Adele was lucky enough to be able to sample this tropical delicacy.</p>
<p>“It is a type of fruit, to be eaten with the peel off. You can also make jam with it.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see!” the maid exclaimed, staring at the fruit intently.</p>
<p>Smiling at Lina’s adorable reaction, Adele looked at the letter again. The sender’s name was not written. But there was only one person who knew what she liked the most.</p>
<p>“Naon, what am I supposed to do if you are this nice.”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head and put the letter on the desk. <em>Okay. It’s reasonable that they have to give thanks. After all, 60,000 pesos was enough money to buy a small castle.</em> She tapped her desk with her finger.</p>
<p>Lina, who was holding the orange basket, carefully opened her mouth. “Uhm, milady?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“The jewelries will be handed to the vassal, but about these fruits… We do not know how to prepare them.” She lowered her head, ashamed of her incompetence.</p>
<p>Adele glanced at the orange Lina was holding and turned her head. Outside the window, she could see the knights training below. She felt that she had to thank them too. Besides, all this time, she had been ignoring Noah because of the guilt she felt for her late husband.</p>
<p>Can she ever get along with him too, the way she got along well with Enon two years ago? Then she shook her head in response to her own question.</p>
<p>Enon and Noah were completely different. Could they get along well even if they tried to?</p>
<p>She got up and beckoned Lina for her basket. “It is time to eat soon. What type of meat are they preparing for lunch?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah! I mean, pheasant and duck meat, milady.” Then she furrowed her brows, “But milady, you don’t like meat.”</p>
<p>“It’s not for me.”</p>
<p>Adele finished her words and headed towards the kitchen with the basket.</p>
