            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 26</strong></p>
<p>Adele was strolling near the knight’s training grounds when they were suddenly disrupted by a noisy voice.</p>
<p>When she turned her head to find out where it came from, her eyes met with a blonde woman.</p>
<p>She glared at Adele fiercely, then grabbed the iron gate and shook it. The knights pushed the woman away.</p>
<p>“You can’t do this to me!” she shrugged off the hands that were restricting her. “Move! Don’t you know who I am?”</p>
<p>The knights continued to pull the woman away from the door. Adele saw the rough situation and made a motion to stop them, but she was afraid of the riot, so she decided against it. Instead, Lina whispered in her ear and told her who the woman was.</p>
<p>“That woman is Miss Irie from the count’s family.”</p>
<p>Adele struggled to remember that name, she was sure she heard it somewhere. Then realization struck.</p>
<p>That woman, Irie, she is…</p>
<p>“Who is she? How dare she enter the palace!” Irie pointed a vicious finger at Adele. The knights intercepted her offending limb and answered on their mistress’s behalf.</p>
<p>“She is the Lady of the Maktus family. Please show your respect.”</p>
<p>But she just scoffed, “Lady? I am Noah’s fiancée!”</p>
<p>That’s right. She was Noah’s fiancée. Out of the blue, Adele recollected about the time she first saw this woman.</p>
<p>It was when her mother-in-law was still alive. In the afternoon tea-time, her mother-in-law and her husband, Enon, were sitting at the round table.</p>
<p><em>‘Now that Enon has gotten married, it is now Noah’s turn.’</em></p>
<p>Adele poured jasmine tea into her mother-in-law’s cup. They looked at her and smiled.</p>
<p><em>‘Enon couldn’t get married and Noah can’t marry before his brother, but now he can.’</em></p>
<p>In the Astrian Empire, the younger brothers were encouraged not to marry until the eldest son has been wedded. It wasn’t exactly a law, but more of a custom. If you don’t follow it, then it would reflect badly upon yourself and your family. How bad was the eldest son be that he couldn’t get married before his younger brother?</p>
<p>Enon, who was sitting to Adele’s left, bowed his head with a gloomy look on his face.</p>
<p><em>‘It is all because of my flaws.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘It’s okay, it’s in the past. In the end, you have gotten a nice wife for yourself.’ </em>Madame Maktus looked at Adele and smiled warmly. Adele dropped her head.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah, I almost forgot. Butler, put the portraits down on the table.’</em></p>
<p>At her instructions, the butler opened a box and placed a bunch of portraits on the table. All of them were ladies that were beautiful in appearance and had a splendid or sophisticated appearance.</p>
<p>Graceful and gentle, their faces were the polar opposite of Adele. Her mother-in-law took Adele’s hand as she scanned the portraits.</p>
<p><em>‘My child, who do you think would be a good match for Noah?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘I’m not sure.’ </em>When Adele hesitated, her father-in-law, who was touching his mustache, opened his mouth.</p>
<p><em>‘The woman in the yellow dress looks fine to me.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Tsk. I wasn’t asking for your opinion!’ </em>The Madame scolded her own husband.</p>
<p><em>‘But, why!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘These matters are to be decided by the lady!’</em></p>
<p>At the mother-in-law’s resolute attitude, the father-in-law only harrumphed and kept his mouth shut. Adele struggled to contain her laughter at their bantering.</p>
<p>Still, her mother-in-law did not forget the matter at hand.</p>
<p><em>‘My child, choose one.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Me?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Why, of course! Aren’t you the lady of the Maktus family now? I will inform Noah to meet the woman you chose.’</em></p>
<p>Adele hesitated and selected a portrait of a gorgeous blonde woman. Among the portraits, it was the most different face from herself. Her father-in-law was taken by surprise when he saw the portrait.</p>
<p>‘<em>Don’t think too much.’</em></p>
<p>She felt puzzled by his words, <em>‘Yes?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Noah did not oppose your marriage because he hated you.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Oppose? Did he initially oppose to our marriage?’ </em>At Adele’s words, the mother-in-law pinched her husband’s side. Then she directed her attention back to her and smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p><em>‘Well, there was a time when he was against your wedding, it was probably because of their deep brotherhood.’</em> Madame Maktus graciously replied.</p>
<p><em>At that, Lord Maktus made his disagreement known, ‘Bah! What do you mean ‘deep brotherhood’? Noah went to the academy at the age of 12 and grew up without even seeing Enon—’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Haha!’ </em>She glared at her slow-witted husband,<em> ‘Perhaps it was because he felt like he had lost his older brother, that’s why he opposed your marriage, but it was only for a short while. Not a cause for worry.’</em></p>
<p>Then she let out forced smile.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she had this uncooperative person for a husband.</p>
<p><em>‘It wasn’t just for a short while, he was against it until they got married! Then, what did he say? He said he’d find a girl for Enon himself!’</em></p>
<p>The mother-in-law threw a sharp gaze to the father-in-law. Then her father-in-law shut his mouth and shook his head. She beat her own chest, lamenting. <em>I can’t live up to my name!</em></p>
<p>Adele bit her mouth at the shocking fact. Then the door to the living room opened.</p>
<p><em>‘Noah has arrived.’</em></p>
<p>Following the maid’s words, Noah walked into the living room. ‘<em>You called for me?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Yes. Sit here.’</em></p>
<p>As the topic changed, the visibly delighted mother-in-law smiled broadly and pointed to the chair. Noah sat next to Enon, placing his sword in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Wearing black clothes, he felt a sense of dissonance as he sat down at the tea table colored in mint and light pink.</p>
<p>He felt like a carnivore forced to get along with a bunch of herbivores.</p>
<p><em>‘I thought I told you to leave your sword outside the castle.’</em></p>
<p>Noah’s expression did not change at his mother’s words. She broke into a cold sweat and hurriedly tried to salvage the situation.</p>
<p><em>‘Right, do you see these portraits?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Yes.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘These are the women for you to choose from. Do you see someone you like?’</em></p>
<p>Noah frowned, then raised his head. He stared into Adele’s light brown eyes and opened his mouth.</p>
<p><em>‘No.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Take another look. Oh, how about this woman here?’</em></p>
<p>His mother showed him the portrait that Adele had chosen earlier.</p>
<p><em>‘This is Miss Irie, isn’t she a gorgeous and sophisticated beauty?’</em></p>
