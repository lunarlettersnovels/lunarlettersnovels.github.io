            <p><strong>Chapter 82</strong></p>
<p>Adele remembered a certain couple who occasionally came to provide a report on the duke’s territories in the mountains and its surrounding environment. She saw that they got along so well, as if they had originally been a couple before…</p>
<p>The law to marry your own sister-in-law was an optional law for the aristocracy, but essential for the common people. Noble women did not work, but commoner women did a lot of work.</p>
<p>They were part of the labor force in the household, the added source income they can contribute to the table wasn’t something commoners could easily ignore. Therefore, it was a better choice for men and women who were in difficult circumstances to live together.</p>
<p><em>If I was a commoner like them…</em></p>
<p>Adele looked at Noah’s face, his features exposed as the wind brushed away the hair covering his face<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>If I had been a commoner, would I have been able to forget everything and take Noah into my heart without any guilt?</em></p>
<p><em>Swooosh!</em></p>
<p>The wind blew, creating ripples on the calm surface of the bathtub. Noah looked at Adele, her eyes glossy and appeared quite pitiful as she looked back at him. She unconsciously bit her lip.</p>
<p>His eyes zoned in on that little movement and he inhaled deeply, “Are you tempting me?”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“Stop staring at me like that.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“With eyes that look like you want me to ravage you.”</p>
<p>She looked at him blankly, she really didn’t know her eyes had already betrayed her innermost thoughts.</p>
<p>Noah wasn’t stupid, he was very much aware of the kind of gaze a woman would give him if they wanted him. But what made him hesitate to act upon his impulses was that the woman in front of him had always pushed him away because of guilt.</p>
<p>He really wanted to hold her in his arms and make her cry as she succumbed to the pleasure.</p>
<p><em>I want you.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to bury myself inside of you, as you desperately writhe beneath me.</em></p>
<p><em>Only with you, can I find my release.</em></p>
<p><em>If you knew exactly just how deep my intense thirst for you had become, you would run away in fear.</em></p>
<p>Noah’s breathing became heavy. He rested his arms on the edge of the tub and propped up his chin. His pupils became dilated as he felt overcome with passion.</p>
<p>“I want to turn you into a hot mess.”</p>
<p>Adele felt the shift in the atmosphere and her heart almost caught up to her throat.</p>
<p>“Drive you crazy with pleasure and leave you begging for more.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’ll make it so that you can think of nobody else but me.”</p>
<p>Noah said that on purpose, he knew she was wracked with guilt whenever she thought of his brother. Just thinking about this fact soured his expression.</p>
<p>Back then, he had to force himself to get drunk so he could forget and relieve himself. But soon, it was no longer enough.</p>
<p>He couldn’t drown himself in wine anymore like he had always done, no matter how aroused he became just by looking at that woman.</p>
<p>It left him feeling miserable.</p>
<p>But now, she was here. Right in front of him. However, he couldn’t touch and it’s messing with his head.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>Adele’s lips trembled. Her heart was pounding, contemplating whether to give in to the temptation or not. Hidden deep within were the feelings she knew she shouldn’t have for her husband’s brother.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>Many events flashed through her mind.</p>
<p>Their first meeting, when he took the book out of the bookshelf for her, when he saved her in the mountains, the nights after marrying him….</p>
<p>Adele placed her hand gently on her pounding chest, her heart fluttering nervously.</p>
<p>She slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p><em>Splash!</em></p>
<p>Adele approached Noah cautiously, gingerly wrapping her arms around his broad shoulders and hugging him with her head still lowered.</p>
<p>“Do it.” She whispered in his ear with a shaky voice, “Make me forget about everything, make it so that there’s only you left in my eyes.”</p>
<p>Noah scanned her face with a disbelieving expression. Was he hearing things?</p>
<p>His heart skipped a beat. “You…”</p>
<p>Adele blushed and licked her lips, she took his hand and used it to cup one side of her face. She timidly gazed up at Noah.</p>
<p>“There’s no one here, so… it’s alright.”</p>
<p>In disbelief, Noah tentatively stroked her warm cheek with his hand. It felt soft and smooth to the touch. His chest heaved up and down as he let out rough breaths that almost sounded like an animalistic growl.</p>
<p>He spoke in a dangerously low voice in at Adele’s ears, his close proximity and warm breath causing shivers to creep up her spine.</p>
<p>“The moment I start, I won’t be able to stop. You know that, right?”</p>
<p>“Mn.”</p>
<p>“You’ll end up crying and begging me to stop.”</p>
<p>“Mn.”</p>
<p>“I won’t ever stop.”</p>
<p>He was only warning her, but as she listened to him, she felt her genitals heating up and throbbing. Instead of speaking, Adele looked at him with misty eyes and gave him a clumsy kiss.</p>
<p><em>Smooch!</em></p>
<p>It was a loving and endearing kiss, as if asking him to be a little nicer to her.</p>
<p>It was Noah who spiraled the kiss into a hotter and more passionate exchange. He greedily lapped at her tongue, enough to make her whole body soften and melt into his arms.</p>
<p>He quickly grabbed a hold of her voluptuous backside.</p>
<p><em>“Ah!”</em></p>
