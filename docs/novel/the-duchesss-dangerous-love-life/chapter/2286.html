            <p><strong>Chapter 71</strong></p>
<p>When Adele beckoned her to leave, Ellie gave a low bow.</p>
<p>The door to the study closed and Adele was finally alone again. When she thought back on Ellie’s words, she felt out of sorts.</p>
<p>She stretched out her arm to reach for something.</p>
<p>Unlike the time before she closed the book, when her finger made contact with the cover, Adele felt a bit nauseous and stopped.</p>
<p>It was during fall, one year ago…</p>
<p><em>‘Lady, may I do it for you?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘You don’t know how to read, right?’</em></p>
<p>In front of the hallway where the study was found, Adele grinned as she looked at a discouraged Lina.</p>
<p>Soon after, she waved her hand a couple of times as a signal. Lina opened the door of the study and stepped back. Once inside, Adele went through the bookshelves and started looking for a book with the words ‘Standard Nammon Language’ written on it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what she was looking for was in the top compartment of the bookshelf. Even though Adele was taller than most women, when she reached out for the book, she still fell short by a large margin so she raised her heels.</p>
<p><em>‘I think we need to call a taller servant here.’</em></p>
<p>Lina muttered to herself, however, a low voice echoed in her ear as Adele was about to lower her arm.</p>
<p><em>‘This book?’</em></p>
<p>She felt warmth behind her back that exuded a thick, woody smell. If she turned around at this time, Adele was certain that she would surely see a handsome face with an impressive build. Adele remained silent and let her trembling finger point towards the book she was looking for.</p>
<p>Noah didn’t say anything, he only reached his hand out and lightly brushed against her hand. It was only a minimal contact between their skin, but Adele jolted in surprise. She let out a yelp as her knees slammed hard against the bookshelf and her legs lost strength to keep herself upright.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah!’</em></p>
<p>Just before she fell, a sturdy arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her body backwards. In a blink of an eye, her back was leaning against Noah’s broad chest. His hands were positioned downwards, with his large palms resting on her belly and his fingers pressing gently against her pubis.</p>
<p>Adele could feel the pressure from his fingers and felt herself getting warm down there. She abruptly whirled her head to look behind her.</p>
<p>She caught sight of Noah with an agitated expression on his face.</p>
<p><em>This feels strange. He had always looked at me coldly before.</em></p>
<p>Thick eyebrows and deep eyes, sharp nose, and rosy red lips…</p>
<p>After staring at his features that were merged together in perfect harmony, Adele came back to her senses and pushed him away. Scuttling out of Noah’s arms, she let out a deep breath. He glanced at her reddened face and handed her the book she was looking for.</p>
<p><em>‘…thank you.’</em></p>
<p>Adele accepted it, and Noah left the study with nary a word, and as the owner of this place, he really wasn’t obligated to say much to her.</p>
<p>Immediately after that, Lina came in, carrying a ladder. She put it down on the floor.</p>
<p><em>‘Milady, I shall bring out the book for yo—oh my! Milady, why is your face so red?! Are you running a fever?’</em></p>
<p>Adele unconsciously touched the side of her face.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s nothing.’ </em>Then she added, <em>‘I have nothing more to do here, I shall take my leave.’</em></p>
<p>Wanting to get far away from this place as soon far as possible, Adele hastily left the study. The cool autumn breeze blew through the unlatched hallway windows, but it didn’t do anything to help cool the rising temperature on Adele’s face.</p>
<p>It was getting dark. At this time, she was usually asleep or would look through some unfinished documents, but now she just sat there and quietly waited for Enon in the bedroom. After a while, Enon entered the bedroom with a tired expression and sat down on the bed. Adele hugged her pillow and crossed her legs.</p>
<p><em>‘Are you tired?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Hm? Oh, yeah. There was a lot of things that needed to be boarded on the ship today.’</em></p>
<p>Adele wasn’t really sure about what she was expecting from his answer, but she felt a little down inside.</p>
<p>He asked her.</p>
<p><em>‘Why aren’t you sleeping?’</em></p>
<p>Adele smiled awkwardly and shook her head slightly. She heard that couples who didn’t want to bear a child, sometimes do it with their hands…</p>
<p><em>If that’s the case, maybe I can do it with him too?</em></p>
<p><em>No, what if he gets angry and insults me like last time…?</em></p>
<p>Adele hesitated, unable to speak her heart out. Enon couldn’t understand what Adele wanted to say, so he just tiredly rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p><em>‘I was busy for the whole day and need to close my eyes for a few. You must’ve been busy attending to all of the paperwork today, you should get some rest too.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Mm.’</em></p>
<p>After loosening his tie, Enon uttered.</p>
<p><em>‘But Noah helped me today. It was a pleasant surprise, I thought he would be busy with his training.’</em></p>
<p>Regarding this brother of his, Enon had some goodwill towards him.</p>
<p><em>‘I knew he would do well. In the first place, he was the one who took the successor class instead of me when I was ill. So, from the financial paperwork to dealing with the merchants, he could do it all! I feel glad to have such a brother like him.’</em></p>
<p>Adele simply listened to him.</p>
<p><em>‘I feel a little guilty for making him work when he just got back from the war. Still, I’m glad I got to be closer with that brother of mine. When he returns to the castle, I should treat… him better… hm…’</em></p>
<p>Enon started closing his eyes while muttering. Adele hurriedly shook him, trying to keep him from falling asleep, but it appears he was really worn out. As soon as his back hit the mattress, he had already sunk into oblivion.</p>
