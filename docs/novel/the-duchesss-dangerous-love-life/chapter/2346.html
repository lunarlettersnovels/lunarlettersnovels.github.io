            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 11 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Noah wasn’t done with his proclamations.</p>
<p>“I want you,” his raspy voice continued, “crying out in pleasure in my arms.”</p>
<p>“Huh…”</p>
<p>Limpid tears rolled out into her cheeks, the pleasurable feeling inside of her was too much that she could hardly contain it. Noah licked her salty tears with his tongue.</p>
<p>“Feeling pleasure…”</p>
<p>Another gasp.</p>
<p>“I’ll make you beg me to hit you every night.”</p>
<p><em>‘This feels strange, this isn’t me…</em> <em>We can’t do any more than this.’ </em>Adele shook her head and pounded his chest hard with her fist. But the more she did, the more stubborn and rampant Noah’s hands became. At last, his thumbs pressed against her little bud and lifted her torso.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>As Adele opened her lips, Noah quickly shoved his tongue into the gaping mouth. Then he kissed her wildly.</p>
<p>Slurping noises and pleasurable groans ensued. As he slid his finger out of her, Adele felt empty, and her legs shook unconsciously.</p>
<p>But then, a thing far bigger and thicker than his fingers, came in.</p>
<p>She was so shocked at the sudden intrusion that she let out a yelp.</p>
<p><em>“Argh!”</em></p>
<p>He gently stroked her hair, “Shh… don’t worry. You’re already handling it well.”</p>
<p>“It’s too big. Ah, <em>ah…</em>”</p>
<p>Ever so slowly, Noah’s thick, rock-hard shaft entered and her sopping wetness clamped down tightly on him. Adele instantly felt full, her mouth agape as he stroked her chest to soothe her nerves.</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>“Usually, people would beg to let me hit them faster. What do you mean by ‘no’, sister-in-law?”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>When all of him was finally shoved up to the hilt, Adele exhaled heavily. Noah’s breath was hot as it caressed her skin. He glanced down at her womanly parts, fortunately, it wasn’t completely torn. The only problem was that, it was too tight.</p>
<p>He glanced at Adele. It didn’t look like she was in pain because she rubbed her skin against him a lot. She was just surprised as this was her first time, but still, she couldn’t help but say, “D-Don’t move…”</p>
<p>Adele was panting hard because of the huge appendage that was filling her insides. Noah smirked but remained unmoving. As she took the chance to slyly retreat to the head of her bed, he grabbed her wide hips, obviously not letting her get away.</p>
<p>A muffled sound was heard, <em>“Mmnff!”</em></p>
<p>“Don’t move.” Noah threw her words back at her. “It’ll slip out.”</p>
<p>She complained, “You’ve already put it in, that’s enough.”</p>
<p>A smirk flitted through Noah’s face and he abruptly pulled her hips back down. As his appendage went into her opening again, Adele hastily shook her head.</p>
<p>“It seems like you don’t know how to have s*x.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll teach you.”</p>
<p>As Noah slowly pulled out his member, put it back in, and continuously moved his waist; Adele unwittingly grabbed the blanket and clenched it tightly. He took her hands and placed it around his neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>Feeling something that she’d never felt before in her whole life, Adele had no choice but to cling desperately at Noah’s shoulder. He moved his body as he relished in the sight of her that was snugly bound to him. It stirred his passion further.</p>
<p>She felt her entire body tingle more and more as her heart pulsated wildly. “It feels—<em>hngff</em>—strange.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s normal.”</p>
<p>Noah kissed Adele’s wet eyes as she whined. “You’ll get even wetter soon.”</p>
<p>His lower body moved fiercely. His shaft kept coming in and out of her tight walls and then went back in once more. The more vigorous he was, the paler her face became.</p>
<p>Her eyes rolled at the back as she felt a peculiar sensation. She was immediately frightened and retreated to the head of the bed to get away. Now that it has come to this point, Noah naturally wouldn’t accept her escape. He grabbed her pelvis and thrusted his erect member right back inside of her.</p>
<p>She screamed. “Ah!”</p>
<p>“So tight.” He could feel her clenching her walls around his thickness and he groaned in pleasure, “You feel so good.”</p>
<p>A series of incoherent, gasping noises was all the reply he received.</p>
<p>“How did you manage to live so quietly, dear sister-in-law.”</p>
<p>At his remark, Adele raised her fingers and grabbed his shoulder. Her nails sharply pierced his broad shoulders, but Noah kept moving his waist without hesitation. As he kept ramming into her, Adele cried out in immense pleasure.</p>
<p><em>“Ahh!”</em></p>
<p>The indescribably euphoric feeling that passed through her pelvis and spread throughout her body soon rushed to her head. Adele couldn’t think of anything else except of savoring such an intoxicating bliss. She was only able to cry and surrender her body to orgasm. Afterwards, she trembled at the invigorating ecstasy that paralyzed her whole body and numbed her senses.</p>
<p>Her mind was fuzzy.</p>
<p>Adele, who had reached the climax first, looked at Noah, breathing heavily. With his bangs slightly damp, he looked at her contentedly and fondly caressed her cheek. Like a drowsy carnivore satisfied from feeding, Noah smiled languidly.</p>
<p>Adele stared at him and felt her heart flutter. Suddenly, the dead Enon came to her mind and she bit her lips.</p>
<p><em>Enon, I’m so sorry.  I already have you but I…</em>  She wept as she remembered her dead husband.</p>
<p>Noah licked her cheek until the tears stopped. Adele tried to turn her head away from his chilling touch but he pinched her chin. His golden eyes only stared at her as she whimpered.</p>
<p>“I guess you are reminded of my brother.”</p>
<p><em>How did he know?</em> Confused, Adele’s eyes quivered.</p>
<p>Noah raised the corners of his lips sullenly.  “Are you feeling guilty towards him because of having s*x with me?”</p>
<p>She closed her eyes. It was a silent affirmation.</p>
<p>He drew in a breath, “You’re not the one that’s supposed to be sorry.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“To be precise, my brother is the one who has to apologize for wronging you.”</p>
<p>Noah pulled out his backside. Then he scratched the thick lining of her vag!na and pushed his finger forward. Adele groaned in surprise. He smiled contentedly and moved his waist.</p>
<p><em>“Adele, I’m sorry. I wasn’t able to please you as a husband after all this time.” </em>His deep voice laced with scorn resonated against her ears.</p>
<p>“He should’ve apologized to you like this, but then, he’s already dead.”</p>
<p><em>Puck!</em></p>
<p>Adele, who had just reached her climax, once again succumbed to the rising pleasure. Noah pushed harder and bit her earlobe.</p>
<p>“Now I’m the one pleasing you in his stead.”</p>
<p><em>“Mmph!”</em></p>
<p>“Sister-in-law, how is it? Is it delicious? Does it feel good?” His skillful ministrations kept teasing her, his member penetrating inside of her.</p>
<p>“S-stop, ah!”</p>
<p>“Ah, you don’t have to answer me.” Because it seemed like she was enjoying it, Noah’s breathed out a low laughter that raised goosebumps on her back. Her spine soon arched with pleasure.</p>
<p><em>“Uh, ah, ah!”</em></p>
