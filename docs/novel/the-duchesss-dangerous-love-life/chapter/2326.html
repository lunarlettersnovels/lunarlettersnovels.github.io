            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 31 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Noah kept on probing her intentions for being present, “What do you want?”</p>
<p>Adele hardened her resolve and looked at him with a determined gaze. In a steady voice, she answered, “A child.”</p>
<p>He stared at her blankly. He didn’t expect these words to come from her.</p>
<p>Not letting his scrutiny intimidate her, she persisted. “I want to get pregnant.”</p>
<p>Noah furrowed his eyebrows, he really hadn’t misheard.</p>
<p>“I met your f-fiancée today.”</p>
<p>He tilted his head slightly, “And?”</p>
<p>“And I heard that, Enon told you to… be responsible for me.” She eyed him, “You did not want this marriage in the first place.”</p>
<p>Adele embraced her stomach. “Err, the only ones who know of Enon’s impotency are you and me. No one would be suspicious if I get pregnant within this month, and when everyone believes what I would carry is Enon’s child, you will be freed from the marriage. Isn’t that what you wish for?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I didn’t know Enon would make such requests to you. I’m so sorry.” Adele covered her eyes with her hands, feeling miserable. But Noah pulled them off, his eyes full of rage.</p>
<p>“Right, now that you mention it, I remember that he did make that request.” He disdainfully uttered, as if recalling something of little significance.</p>
<p><em>Remember? What did he mean, ‘remember’?</em> Adele forehead creased.</p>
<p>Noah sat down. “Didn’t you ask me for the reason I’m marrying you?”</p>
<p>Unsure of why this question suddenly popped up, she just simply replied. “Yes.”</p>
<p>Noah had a somewhat angry expression on his while he smirked. It didn’t look off at all, if it was others, it would’ve been outright creepy.</p>
<p>Adele had goosebumps witnessing this side of him she hadn’t seen after a long time. The bedroom, which had just been warm, suddenly turned frigid. Noah hugged her and whispered bluntly in her ear.</p>
<p>“I wanted to have you.”</p>
<p>Then she froze along with the decreasing temperature.</p>
<p>“You have always been clean and innocent.”</p>
<p>Adele tried to pry him off, but Noah didn’t let her succeed. Rather, he ripped off her lingerie. Appreciating her exposed skin, he added, “The thought that only my brother could see this body almost drove me crazy.”</p>
<p>He caressed her stomach. “Therefore, I made up my mind. I will make you mine and I will squeeze every bit of pleasure from you as you writhe underneath me.”</p>
<p>His words made her heat up, his tone and his sensual voice made it even harder for her to breathe.</p>
<p>“The things my brother has never been able to do,” His hands on her stomach went up and grabbed her breast roughly. “I will do them all to you and more.”</p>
<p>Adele was startled by the sensation on her chest and let out a yelp. Noah glanced at her and murmured. “Perhaps, you might even end up wanting more.”</p>
<p>“W-what do you mean?”</p>
<p>He stroked her hair and consoled, albeit insincerely, “How hard it must’ve been to live with such an impotent husband.”</p>
<p>Adele remembered the nights she spent with Enon. She was human too, so there were times when she wanted to be intimate with her husband, s*x wasn’t always just about the exchange of genitals.</p>
<p>One day, she found the courage to speak her mind, so she grabbed his collar and told him of her wishes. But he didn’t see it the same way she did. Instead, Enon insulted her as a disgraceful woman.</p>
<p>Of course, he apologized in tears the next day. After that, they didn’t mention s*xual intercourse with each other ever again. Still, they went on without any problems, proceeding with daily matters just like an ordinary couple.</p>
<p>Adele shook her head vigorously. No, she never had a hard time. It was just s*x and she was okay without it. She didn’t do anything to be ashamed of!</p>
<p>She, who had been shouting the words of denial inside herself, remembered the autumn night this time a year ago. As her chest grew heavy with guilt, she tried to push Noah away. Although he was as unmoving as mountain, Adele did not give up and continued to push his hand away.</p>
<p>“Do not say anything that insults me.”</p>
<p>“Insult? I am simply telling the truth. The shameful truth that you desperately wanted to hide.”</p>
<p>She clenched her fists, “I think having a divorce after I get pregnant would be good. We didn’t get married because we wanted to in the first place.”</p>
<p>Adele turned her head away, avoiding Noah’s piercing gaze.</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. “Divorce?” He chuckled dangerously, “You really like to mess with people, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Unaware of how her words aggravated him, Adele spoke, “It will be better for you and your reputation. Your prestige might be affected if people knew that you truly married your sister-in-law.”</p>
<p>“I will be the one making the decision, not you.” Adele was momentarily at a loss by Noah’s resolute words, but hurriedly spat out the words she had heard last night. “You’re the one who wanted a child.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Then he smirked, “So spread your legs.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You said you wanted a child, hm?”</p>
<p>Noah grabbed her by the waist. His swollen appendage touched her entrance. Knowing how big that thing was and how it went inside her, she tried to back away from him. Ready to begin, Noah grabbed her pelvis and rubbed it against his maleness.</p>
<p>“My dear wife, weren’t you wishing for a child?” Her words backfired to her.</p>
<p>No matter the number of times they’ve already done it, Adele was still greatly embarrassed, “S-stop!”</p>
<p>A rough kiss followed before Adele could respond. She wasn’t able turn her head in time as Noah held her chin and tangled his lips with hers, his tongue running rampant inside her mouth.</p>
<p>He shoved her raging member into her.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Fortunately, she was already very wet from his prior fondling, so it didn’t hurt as much.</p>
<p>“Lift your butt.”</p>
<p>“D-don’t do this.”</p>
<p>“Why should I when I’m only granting my wife’s wish?”</p>
