            <p><strong>Chapter 61</strong></p>
<p>They were in an engagement arranged by her father and his work partner. It was an engagement that would break quickly if there was nothing left to gain.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Although Adele didn’t love him, she was still disappointed, but she didn’t want to look so miserable about it.</p>
<p>She looked back.</p>
<p>Young ladies here and there wore gorgeous dresses while hers was too shabby. The shoes they wore were densely studded with jewels, but her shoes were quite plain. They held hands with decent and handsome-looking men, but there was no one by her side.</p>
<p>There wouldn’t be a man who’d want to hold her hand anyway.</p>
<p><em>‘That’s right, no one would like me.’</em></p>
<p>Adele clenched her fists, her pale hands trembling.</p>
<p>Realizing her fate, she hurriedly left the royal banquet hall. As Adele spun her head around and stared at the resplendent entrance, she swore that she would never come here again.</p>
<p>But in the end, more than ten years later, she still came back.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Adele stood in front of the Imperial Palace’s banquet hall; she was attending the dinner party with her identity as the duchess. A lot of time has passed, but the memories it held within was still difficult for her to take in.</p>
<p>Adele clenched her fists and trembled. Noah stood next to her and coincidentally saw her movements. He spoke, “Are you feeling unwell?”</p>
<p>Adele raised her head to meet his gaze.</p>
<p>“Ah, no. I’m just reminded of the past.”</p>
<p>He frowned and stared at her, then he altered his gaze straight ahead.</p>
<p>“Let us enter.”</p>
<p>She stubbornly maintained distance from him for about a week, starting from the day they went out on the streets. But today, there was a dinner party that they must attend together. But on the way here, he didn’t even say a single word.</p>
<p>It felt so awkward inside the carriage.</p>
<p>“Ho…”</p>
<p>Adele sighed and looked around the garden that was lavishly decorated. Every year, around this time of the month, an imperial banquet is held here. But to Adele, this was an unfamiliar place for her. This is because the banquet has not been held for the past two years due to the unstable reign of the new emperor.</p>
<p>In addition, gatherings hosted by the imperial family were usually only attended by nobles and high-ranking people living in the capital or ladies making their debut.</p>
<p>Since it has already been a long time from when Adele attended an imperial ceremony, she felt somewhat anxious and swallowed her saliva.</p>
<p>“Are you nervous?” Noah spoke.</p>
<p>“Ah? Yes…” Somehow, Adele admitted what she felt, “It’s been a while since I last came here.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be worried about. This place is just filled with snobbish people flaunting their wealth and power.” There wasn’t even a change in his expression, these people were ants in his eyes and a waste of his time.</p>
<p>Adele felt frightened, “Someone might hear you!”</p>
<p>She looked around. Fortunately, no one seemed to be listening. She took a deep breath and looked at him.</p>
<p>Noah was dressed more formally than usual. He wore a black-red, perfectly lined robe that brought forth an imposing air about him. His fringes that usually covered his forehead was gelled back, revealing his sculpted features. Right now, he looked like those mighty and highly influential, aloof gentlemen.</p>
<p>There’s no way around it, no matter what he wore, he was still incomparably handsome.</p>
<p>Adele clenched her fists. In contrast to her outstanding husband, be it looks or bearing, she felt incredibly inferior.</p>
<p>Noah took her hand and gently shook it, “As I have said, there’s nothing here to be afraid of.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“No one here is better than us.”</p>
<p>He was right. He was part of the most noble family in the empire, even the imperial family had no control over them. Raising the corners of his mouth with an arrogant look, he tapped the peacock-patterned brooch on his chest with his thumb.</p>
<p>In a place like this, there was no one else to lean on at this moment. Somehow, the calm Noah appeared the most reliable. Adele unwittingly grabbed the hem of his clothes. His golden eyes contracted for a moment.</p>
<p>“You can hide behind me if you feel nervous.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Mm.” He nodded in satisfaction, “You’re short, you won’t be seen anyway.”</p>
<p>Adele felt speechless at his words.</p>
<p><em>Was he teasing me?</em></p>
<p>“I’m taller than you think.” Adele, who was about an inch taller than the most ladies, snorted in absurdity.</p>
<p>Noah doubted if she was serious and looked down at her. Her head only reached his chest.</p>
<p>He kissed her forehead lightly and smirked, “Are you?”</p>
<p>Adele ignored his question. She wondered if she should ignore him the whole night as well, “It’s our turn to enter the room.” She turned around and looked straight ahead.</p>
<p>Noah let out a low laugh when he saw her blushing slightly. <em>How cute.</em></p>
<p>After a while, the servants opened the door to the banquet hall. The first thing they saw was a magnificent chandelier gilded with gold and precious glass, and a red carpet laid on the floor. Gold linings were engraved on the pristine white walls of the hallways to form stunning patterns for the guests to marvel at.</p>
<p>The nobles who were already inside covered their faces with fans while looking at the entrance.</p>
<p>“The Duke and Duchess Maktus!” a voice bellowed loudly. The words stirred up a commotion inside the banquet hall.</p>
<p>“Gosh, so the news of his marriage was true?!”</p>
<p>“But, his wife used to be his sister-in-law?”</p>
<p>“Heavens! What did I just see? Noah is escorting his wife with such a gentle expression!”</p>
<p>Unlike her debut years ago, Adele was attracting people’s attention. She shuddered as she heard the content of the people’s conversation.</p>
<p>Noah grabbed her pale, quivering hand. He patted the back of her palms with his thumb, assuring her.</p>
<p>“Keep your head up.”</p>
<p>Worried, she glanced at him.</p>
<p>“No one here would dare to judge you.” He assured her.</p>
<p>From an angle Adele couldn’t see, Noah glared menacingly at the nobles, and they shifted in discomfort at his warning gaze.</p>
