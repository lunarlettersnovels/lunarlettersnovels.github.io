            <p><strong>Chapter 140</strong></p>
<p>Adele, who had fallen for his pathetic gaze, nodded her head and increased her pace.</p>
<p>As if waiting for that exact moment, Noah began to follow her rhythmic movements and abruptly slapped her ass.</p>
<p>Then, his expression changed and his tensed muscles relaxed. He completely withdrew his penis from inside of her, then he drove all the way back in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Adele cried out helplessly.</p>
<p><em>“Ahhh!”</em></p>
<p>“Adele.” he said slowly, still drilling his member into her wetness and keeping her in a state of frenzy.</p>
<p><em>“Ah, ah, ah, ahhhh!”</em></p>
<p>“We <em>really </em>used to do it like this?” He smirked, “I really don’t know what I should do, mmm.”</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>His way of speaking has changed so drastically.</p>
<p>Adele opened her eyes that had closed because of the pleasure she felt. Then, she quickly noticed the raised corners of his lips as looked at her.</p>
<p>With eyes full of love.</p>
<p>“Y-you—!”</p>
<p>“Continue, it’s something that you’ve always done after all, am I right?”</p>
<p>“W-when did you return…”</p>
<p>“Does that even matter?” he watched her amusedly, “What’s important is that… you’re acting like this. <em>So sexy, baby</em>.”</p>
<p>“S-stop—”</p>
<p>“No, I won’t stop. We only did it once, we should do more of it today.”</p>
<p><em>What do you mean? We’ve done it 3 times before and now we’re doing it again!</em></p>
<p>Adele shook her head.</p>
<p>“We did it earlier—<em>ugh</em>!”</p>
<p>“That was the teenage me. But now,” He abruptly cut off her words with a big thrust and teased, “you’ll be riding the adult me.”</p>
<p>“What?! Ahh, ahh, s-stop!”</p>
<p>Adele was mortified beyond words.</p>
<p>“Shh… It’s alright.”</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>He spanked her butt and began to rub the tender area. Adele fell forward and supported her upper body with her palms, her generous chest dangling above him like a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>He gave her nipple a little lick, and her whole body shuddered. Then, he penetrated her up to the deepest parts of her and moved.</p>
<p>Adele trembled from the pleasure and her eyes welled up, Noah wiped her tears with his thumb and soothed her with a deep kiss.</p>
<p>When their lips separated, a string of saliva remained between their tongues. Adele rested her weight against his chest and pleaded.</p>
<p>“S-slowly…”</p>
<p>Deciding to be lenient, Noah agreed. “Alright, I’ll move slowly.”</p>
<p>“You’re not lying, right?” she asked skeptically.</p>
<p>“You love me, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“You—! Really…”</p>
<p>Adele appeared to be relieved as he smiled and moved, this time like being in a tender lover’s embrace. Exhaling a warm breath of air, Noah moved his waist unhurriedly. If he really did what he wanted to do right now and not according to her wishes, their coupling would be over so soon.</p>
<p>As Adele moved, her chest shook slightly, and Noah rubbed her with a satisfied expression on his face. Then, biting her nipples and sucking it hard, she trembled and tightened her inner muscles.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, and Noah pounded inside of her up a few more times before releasing his seed into her. Adele felt like she was treading murky waters, languid and hazy, from the aftermath of her climax.</p>
<p>She stared at him with a pitiful look. But Noah just shrugged his shoulders and ruffled her hair.</p>
<p>“You’re really mean.” she pouted.</p>
<p>He smirked.</p>
<p>“One more?”</p>
<p>Panicked, Adele chided him, “Have you no conscience?!”</p>
<p>“Don’t be naive.”</p>
<p>“Who’s naive?!” Adele hit him on the shoulder, but Noah smiled sweetly and hugged her tightly.</p>
<p>He was really happy—he managed to marry the woman of his dreams.</p>
<p>She saved him.</p>
<p>He had forgotten about this little fact for a while because of the bliss he experienced in her arms.</p>
<p>If someone listened to the ramblings of his heart, they might exclaim that he was overreacting. But Noah would’ve said no. All those years when he didn’t have her in his life were exhausting, desperate, and hell. There was nothing to rejoice about living.</p>
<p>“I’m so relieved that you are my wife.” he openly expressed to her.</p>
<p>“Hm? Is there something wro—”</p>
<p>“I love you, Adellia.”</p>
<p>Adele paused, not knowing what to do with the sudden confession. She then sighed and patted his back.</p>
<p><em>He’s so mean…</em></p>
<p><em>Teasing me like this…</em></p>
<p>She blushed. Adele really couldn’t rebuke him with this kind of sweet atmosphere so she simply puckered her mouth.</p>
<p>His younger self was cuter and more lovable. Her making love with him wasn’t to bring back his memories, so she felt a bit of regret she couldn’t toy with him for a little while longer.</p>
<p>As she was thinking this and that, Noah took Adele’s hand and placed it on his head.</p>
<p>Her eyes blinked, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Won’t you praise me?”</p>
<p>A confused look appeared on her face.</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>“The s*x.”</p>
<p>“Who would even praise such a thing—”</p>
<p>“You praised the teenage me.”</p>
<p>“W-well, <em>that is—!</em> Ugh, seriously…” Adele was flustered, then suddenly brushed his hair back.</p>
<p>He smiled and rubbed her cheek against the palm of his hand, seemingly satisfied. “I like it when you touch me.”</p>
<p>Adele blinked again.</p>
<p>She felt something strange. Although most—if not all—of his memories came back and he was back to his previous self, it felt like he was still exuding the faint aura of childishness.</p>
