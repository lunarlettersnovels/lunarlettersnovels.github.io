            <p><b>Chapter 117</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele waved the gun in her hand. Noah patted her on the shoulder as he gazed into her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve always wanted to make you smile. But,” he smiled ruefully, “I keep failing, every time.” Noah whispered so softly that his body barely even moved. He was afraid that any moment from now, she might disappear from his sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I’m afraid I would have to agree with you on that one.” Adele chuckled faintly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah gingerly kissed the ring finger on her left hand. Unlike his usual tender or passionate kisses, this one exuded a feeling of reverence for her being. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Live with me forever, Adellia.” Cupping his cheek with one hand, Adele gently nodded her head. “Gladly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling choked with bliss, but unable to outwardly show it in his face, Noah kissed her deeply and placed her hands into his own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One was clothed in a white dress, and the other, in a black tailcoat—man and woman kissing after a passionate confession on Virgin Road. The guests unintentionally shed tears when they saw the affectionate ducal couple’s actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has never been a more romantic moment than this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clanging sound of metal falling onto the marbled floor resounded loudly. Looking back, Adele saw that the emperor’s sword was no longer in his hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her words fell on deaf ears. The emperor only felt loathing towards Adele at this very moment. Why did it have to be Noah Maktus? Why couldn’t it be him instead? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was why, even if Adele asked him to spare Noah’s life, Rayence decided he would still execute the duke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment he picked up his sword again, Adele quickly rushed towards him and pulled it to her neck. The emperor was a bit too slow to react, “Adele! What are you d—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just kill me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His heart suddenly constricted with pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How can I not know of my husband’s treason? If you still wish for his death, then allow me to accompany him to the netherworld.” Adele moved forward, the weapon narrowing dangerously just a hair’s breadth away. “Kill us, Your Majesty. Eliminate the couple who had conspired against the empire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor could not speak, nor could he move. Her every word struck him like a lightning bolt out of the blue, tearing apart his already tattered heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please…” she urged. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele… </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just why…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing her holding Noah’s hand and gazing at him with loving eyes, Rayence found it so difficult to breathe. He even felt like strangling himself to death just to get rid of the excruciating feeling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His body turned rigid, remaining deathly still as he held a sword by his side. All this time, he had only wanted her by his side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how could she tell him to kill her? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could he even bear to lay a finger on her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rayence could only watch on as they whispered their love to each other, with Adele still as radiant and beautiful as the day he met her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unmindful of the emperor’s forlorn expression, Noah lifted her by the waist and hugged her tightly. Then he looked at Adele, “Close your eyes for a moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shh. It’ll be over soon.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah decisively struck a pressure point behind her neck. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No—” </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Adele’s resistance was all for naught. Dizziness engulfed her mind and she soon fell into oblivion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah supported her weight and then straightened his back. He soon walked to where Adele’s personal maids stood and laid her down on a comfortable chair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, the emperor finally had a change in expression as he frowned. “You still need to pay the consequences of your treason.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah ignored him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor added, “There is no need to worry. I shall let you suffer a painless death with a swift execution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His knights were all disbanded, and the castle was conquered and destroyed. But strangely enough, Noah still remained calm throughout this whole ordeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gazing in a faraway distance, a faint smirk crossed his features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let the true battle unfold.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Noah finished speaking, Rayence heard the shrieking sound of a particular animal. An ominous feeling pervaded the emperor’s senses as he drifted his gaze upwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A huge, bird-shaped silhouette could be seen on the outer side of the transparent glass roof. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as everyone was just wondering what it was, the shadow gradually loomed closer and—</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clink! </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The glass ceiling shattered into razor-sharp fragments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the shards fell from above, the guests screamed and crouched. When they raised their heads to take a peak, instead of seeing the palace’s marvelously crafted glass designs, what they saw was a clear sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a monstrous pterosaur flapping its wings, leaving gales in its wake.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roaaarrr!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pterosaur screeched, it was so piercing that the weaker ones who were nearest to the vicinity had some blood running from their ears. Even the ground rumbled in response. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the nobles covered their ears and fell to the ground to save their lives. No one knew that a monster of this magnitude would suddenly appear out of nowhere, much less how it managed to arrive within the heart of the capital undetected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was even more terrifying was that most of the knights guarding the imperial castle had little experience in dealing with monsters of this advanced tier because they only had to deal with catching ordinary humans.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shrieeeekkkk!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster’s cries echoed once more, and a white light began to form in its mouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the pillars and objects of the wedding hall on the topmost floor of the castle were demolished. The knights of the imperial family fired spears and arrows diligently, but they couldn’t even penetrate its defenses and it only served to aggravate its anger. The pterosaur roared once more and smashed whatever remained of the roof with its large wings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heed my command, all abled knights!” The emperor bellowed loudly, “Rally to me and defeat that monster!” </span></p>
