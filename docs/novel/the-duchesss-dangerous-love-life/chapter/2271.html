            <p><strong>Chapter 86</strong></p>
<p>“I left my wedding ring behind. Please let me off today, I promise to always wear it in the future.”</p>
<p>After fiddling with it for a short while, Adele now wore a ring made from a forget-me-not.</p>
<p>Noah’s gaze stared at the flower on her ring finger, eyes never straying even after some time passed. Adele didn’t notice anything strange, so she continued speaking.</p>
<p>“I’ve worn a lot of flower rings when I was young—”</p>
<p>“Do you remember?” He asked all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Adele was a little confused. She naturally remembered flower rings, wasn’t she just speaking about it? “Well, of course. I made these a lot of times with my maids.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that—never mind.”</p>
<p>He realized that she was still naked, so he asked, “Aren’t you feeling cold?”</p>
<p>Sensing that his face seemed a little forlorn, Adele lifted herself up, wanting to say more. But Noah just smiled and pressed his forehead against hers as he breathed in her scent.</p>
<p>“If you catch a cold, it’ll be hard for me to hug you.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>He glanced at her slightly, “My sick wife wouldn’t be able to handle the consequence if I get aroused.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Adele hit his broad shoulder playfully, and Noah laughed out loud as he strode into the hut.</p>
<p>As they both lied on the bed, Adele closed her eyes and fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Adele woke up after half a day had passed. She moved for a bit and felt the warmth from her back. Twisting her body, she saw Noah still sound asleep.</p>
<p>Seeing a man who had always been cold and domineering sleeping so innocently like this made her feel…</p>
<p>Adele propped her chin onto her palms and admired his face. She wanted to poke at his cheek with her finger, still disbelieving that such a man—this man—was her husband.</p>
<p>Very carefully, she started moving her hands. However, her finger was caught.</p>
<p>Opening his golden-hued eyes, Noah turned his body to face Adele and grinned as he immediately started tousling her hair.</p>
<p>“Did my wife want to touch me somewhere, hm?”</p>
<p>A low, seductive voice spoke in her ears. His sexual innuendo made Adele’s ears turn furiously red as she hastily muttered with a small voice. “Let me go.”</p>
<p>“Just say it.”</p>
<p>Before she could even reply, a rumbling sound could be heard from her stomach. Embarrassed, Adele covered her face with both her hands and heard a muffled laughter.</p>
<p>Noah got up and poured some mint water from the table to and offered it to Adele. But she found her arm strength a little to lacking at the moment that she was barely able to hold the cup in place.</p>
<p>“You haven’t eaten anything yet, so you might feel a little weak. Especially with our earlier… <em>activities</em>.”</p>
<p>“Tha—that’s right.” Adele blushed at the thought of the things they did before she went to sleep.</p>
<p>Noah smirked, but decided to let her off this time, “Eat some fruits first, food will take a little while before it’s ready.”</p>
<p>Noah’s finger pointed to a pot over the furnace. Before she could ask what was inside it, he walked over and ignited the fire, then he washed his hands with the water from a wooden bucket. Cutting a lumpy fruit on the table with a knife, he brought a piece to her lips.</p>
<p>Adele felt shy, “You can just give it to me, I’ll eat it by myself.”</p>
<p>“Just open your mouth.”</p>
<p>Noah did not listen and continued to hover the fruit in front of her lips.</p>
<p><em>I’m not a child…</em></p>
<p>Adele hesitated, but she still opened her mouth. The sweet and sour taste spread tickled her tastebuds. She didn’t know the name of the yellow fruit, but it tastes good. A lot of juice dribbled from the corners of her lips so she licked them with her little tongue.</p>
<p>Noah’s eyes darkened at the sight, he himself licked his lips and was holding back his desires.</p>
<p>“Do that one more time and you won’t be able to get up for a week.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Tsk, my innocent wife still can’t understand this.” He raised another fruit to her lips, “Here, ‘ah’.”</p>
<p>Adele opened her mouth again. After several bites more, she’d have already eaten the whole fruit. By the time he cleared away the peelings and washed his hands, a fragrant smell wafted inside the house.</p>
<p>“Is that a stew?”</p>
<p>“Mn. Although, there are only vegetables in it.”</p>
<p>Adele easily gets indigestion if she ate meat out of the blue, so it was quite considerate of the cook. But she remembered there was only him and her in this hut, so who prepared the food?</p>
<p><em>Don’t tell me…</em></p>
<p>Noah smiled as he saw Adele’s confused expression.</p>
<p>“I made it.”</p>
<p>“You?” She could hardly believe it. She lightly sniggered at the thought of a cold-blooded man being patient enough to even start chopping some vegetables or cooking.</p>
<p>Although, he was quite adept at chopping off heads… But that was entirely a different matter!</p>
<p>At this thought, Adele chuckled nervously, “Haha, did you really make that?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Noah gave her a bowl. Surprised by the appetizing scent of the stew, Adele tried to scoop some, but her hand was unsteady. Noah took the spoon from her and began scooping from her bowl. He blew on it and then brought the spoon to her lips.</p>
<p>“Open your mouth.”</p>
<p>Hesitation appeared on Adele’s face. She didn’t want to feel like a child who couldn’t do anything by herself. However, the expression Noah’s face while feeding her looked dead serious and earnest that it was just so adorable to look at.</p>
<p>Therefore, she conceded and let him feed her.</p>
