            <p><strong>Chapter 135</strong></p>
<p>Once she had spoken in a slightly rushed tone, Noah clenched his fists and hugged her tightly. Adele expected they would walk together to the room as per usual, but then she abruptly yelped and grabbed his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Hold on to me.”</p>
<p>“Wait, slow down!”</p>
<p>Before long, they had arrived in a small bedroom attached to her office and Noah stared at the bed in front of him.</p>
<p><em>Dump!</em></p>
<p>A soft thud was heard.</p>
<p>He hurriedly peppered her kisses and roughly took off her shirt.</p>
<p>Adele pressed on his shoulders and said hurriedly. “S-slow down—<em>ah!</em>”</p>
<p>Stark naked, Noah towered over her form, gazing at her with fervent desire.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I-I can’t… restrain myself any longer.” Then he proceeded to position himself on top of her.</p>
<p>The light of the moon sprinkled on his back and defined the contours of his back muscles. Yet, despite his large and manly frame, a fresh and childish expression graced his features. Like a youth spending the night for the first time with the girl he liked—clueless of what to do next.</p>
<p>Adele glided her fingers against his back and bit the sensitive part of his neck. Immediately, she grabbed his genitals with one hand.</p>
<p>At her unexpected action, Noah let out a low groan and tried to further suppress his desires, “Ugh.”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Have you ever done it?”</p>
<p>“…what?” Noah opened his mouth and looked down at her with hooded eyes.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Adele got up with a smirk as she saw him acting so clumsily. Then, she began to caress his upper body with her fingers as she initiated a rough kiss and put her tongue into his gaping mouth.</p>
<p>In between kisses, she asked again, “Have you ever done it with anyone else before?”</p>
<p>“N-no.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p><em>At seventeen, he really hadn’t been with any woman before?</em></p>
<p>Noah shook his head. “I don’t lie… to you.”</p>
<p>He must’ve been embarrassed by his obvious lack of experience, because his ears began to turn a glaring bright red. Adele was moved by how cute it looked.</p>
<p><em>Does that mean… I was his first?</em></p>
<p>As if a memory was triggered, Adele also recalled her first experience with him as well. Noah completely took control over the whole situation back then, she had only desperately clung to him as she sobbed at how domineering he was with her.</p>
<p>But now, seeing his face being so shy and innocent, she felt proud and then a sense of triumph pervaded her senses.</p>
<p>She planned to put her wicked schemes into motion. Because if not this time, when would she ever get the chance to do it to him?</p>
<p>She spoke firmly, “Stay still.”</p>
<p>“…what?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of it.”</p>
<p>Then, she pushed him down against the bed.</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>Putting her legs on either side of him, Adele sat on his body.</p>
<p>She started caressing his skin with ghost-like touches, lowering her body to suck at his neck and going further down to give an erotic lick on his chest.</p>
<p>She had only given a suck and lick, and yet Noah’s face was already furiously red from his face to his neck.</p>
<p>Adele definitely wasn’t going to shy away now.</p>
<p>Rarely had she ever tackled him so aggressively because he had always been the dominant one when they made love. But back then, she still had the chance to tease him and had more experience than the current Noah. Hence, she acted daringly today, perhaps as a little bit of payback too.</p>
<p>Adele dragged down his underwear and started rubbing the tip of his pen*s.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Feeling her excessive stimulation, Noah’s face contorted both in pain and pleasure and bit his lip. He really didn’t want her to see how embarrassed his face was.</p>
<p>But when he opened his eyes and saw her on top of him, with the hem of her underskirt in her mouth, rubbing her nether lips so sensually with her fingers—the sight was so f*cking arousing that he only wanted to put her knees and roughly take her from behind.</p>
<p>He tried to get his body into an upright position, but Adele quickly pressed against his torso.</p>
<p>“I—” she moaned breathily, “I told you… stay still.”</p>
<p>“A-alright…”</p>
<p>Then he cursed out loud, “F*ck!”</p>
<p>There was a squelching sound. Adele moved her hand faster and faster without even realizing it and afterwards, there was intense rubbing with her genitalia against his.</p>
<p>When Adele’s wet entrance positioned against his glans, they both let out shouts of pleasure as they climaxed together.</p>
<p><em>“Ah!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Urgh!”</em></p>
<p>There hadn’t even been penetration yet, so even if they had both cum, it still felt lacking.</p>
<p>Adele bowed her head and lightly nipped at his bottom lip, then she immediately sucked.</p>
<p>Noah seized the back of her neck and swiftly captured her wandering tongue, suckling on it as he fiercely grabbed her bare butt0cks. The intensity of their kisses heightened as they savored the taste of each other, and then their lips parted.</p>
<p>“Adele.”</p>
<p>Panting and out of breath, she responded.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Why are you so good at thi—<em>darn it!</em> No, don’t answer that.”</p>
<p>Noah had a regretful and resentful look on his face.</p>
<p><em>If she’s re-married, she naturally would’ve had plenty of experience. Then, she must’ve done it with my older brother</em> <em>too?</em></p>
<p>He was so angry that he couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p>This beautiful body, her soft skin, her white, rounded breasts, her lovely and aroused expressions—they all should’ve all belonged exclusively to him…</p>
<p>What had his old self been doing in the past ten years that he actually allowed this woman to marry another man?</p>
<p><em>What an idiot!</em></p>
<p><em>Stupid bastard!</em></p>
