            <p><strong>Chapter 103</strong></p>
<p>Running as fast as he could, he immediately slashed at the beast. Being pierced through its thick hide with the sword digging into its flesh, the bear let out an enraged roar as it felt a sting of pain.</p>
<p>However, that kind of injury was superficial to something of its kind and only served to provoke its fury.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy for the boy to achieve this, he couldn’t even will his weapon to cut deeper because the bear’s muscles were too compact it felt like he was fighting against block of impenetrable stone. He instinctively realized that he wouldn’t be able to deal with this troublesome bear by simply relying on his current self.</p>
<p>The bear charged towards to boy, exposing teeth dripping with saliva as it let out a deafening roar.</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>The beast immediately paused in its attempt to mangle the boy to death and slowly glanced behind.</p>
<p>To the woman currently holding a gun in her hand.</p>
<p>It lazily shook its huge body and the bullet lodged in its body directly fell to the ground. Instantly, its flesh with a punctured hole pieced themselves together, as if it was never shot in the first place.</p>
<p>If the beast could make an expression, it would’ve definitely sneered at her.</p>
<p>“N-no way…” Adele’s complexion paled. Her hand trembled as she held onto her small weapon for dear life.</p>
<p><em>Bang! Bang! Bang!</em></p>
<p>She shot another bullet at the bear’s gaping mouth. But for some inexplicable reason, the beast caught them all and spit them out with a disgusted look, then it walked closer to her.</p>
<p>It was starting to get irritated with this pesky fly.</p>
<p>The boy saw this scene and assumed a sword striking position. At that moment, a black energy slowly materialized out of his hand.</p>
<p><em>[Use my power…]</em></p>
<p>The boy violently shook his head to get rid of that diabolical and ominous voice in his mind.</p>
<p><em>[You’re too weak… why don’t you… surrender your body to me…]</em></p>
<p>He ignored those words and threw his scabbard at the monster’s head to catch its attention. “Fight <em>me</em>, you stupid bear!”</p>
<p>But the beast only growled and continued walking closer towards Adele.</p>
<p><em>[Human… do you really think you stand a chance against that… given how pathetic you are?]</em></p>
<p>The boy rushed to the monster, but he only fell down.</p>
<p><em>[That girl… she will die…]</em></p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>Then his breathing staggered. He inhaled deeply and closed his trembling eyes as black energy began enveloping his whole body. When he opened his eyes, his dark-colored irises had been replaced with a golden hue.</p>
<p>Penetrating his sword deep into the ground, dark energy swirled around his body.</p>
<p>He bellowed at the sky with a pained expression and immediately stormed towards the beast he currently detested with all his being.</p>
<p><em>Roaaaarr!</em></p>
<p>All animals have an instinctive sense for danger, much more so for advanced beasts. Which is why, when the bear detected that the boy changed so incomprehensibly that he could even threaten its life, it began to flee.</p>
<p>Alas! While its huge body granted it strength and defensive capabilities, it also meant its speed was much inferior.</p>
<p><em>Shiinggg!</em></p>
<p>The huge bear fell down with a loud thump.</p>
<p>Hearing the sound, Adele cautiously opened her eyes as she struggled to calm her quivering body. The fishy scent of blood from a dead monster pervaded her senses and she started to retch. Soon, she remembered the boy and quickly got up to her feet.</p>
<p>Adele had just cleaned him up earlier, but now, the boy stood with another bloody cheek.</p>
<p>The only difference was that, he had an eerie smile on his face.</p>
<p>Feeling frightened by the disturbing sight, Adele grabbed his arm, but her voice was almost inaudible.</p>
<p>“Are you… are you alright?” As Adele tried to approach him, he hurriedly backed away, covering his face with his hands.</p>
<p>“Don’t come any closer!”</p>
<p>She frowned, “But I need to see if you’re hurt anywher—”</p>
<p>“I said don’t come near me, it’s dangerous—<em>ukh!</em>”</p>
<p>His eyes reverted back to its dark shade, and he collapsed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the black energy that had permeated his body had escaped and disappeared almost instantaneously. Seeing the strange sight, Adele was shocked and hesitated.</p>
<p>But she still decided to approach the boy’s unconscious body and hugged him.</p>
<p><em>We must go to a safe place first.</em></p>
<p>Adele, holding the boy’s body that was heavier than expected, groaned and walked away. Then she had a fleeting thought.</p>
<p><em>This has never happened before. Why would a monster that lives deep inside the mountain come all the way near the outskirts?</em></p>
<p><em>In the future, I shouldn’t move around recklessly anymore.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Waking up, he could feel a pounding headache assaulting his brain.</p>
<p>“Urgh…”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re awake.”</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was Adele’s beautiful and delicate face.</p>
<p>The embarrassed boy tried to get up but was pushed back down by Adele pressing her hand against his chest. His ears reddened slightly, but that was because he could feel Adele’s soft thighs touching the back of his head!</p>
<p>He was laying on top of her lap.</p>
<p><em>On her lap.</em></p>
<p>He coughed, “Where is this place?”</p>
<p>Glancing around surreptitiously, his eyes caught sight of a field and a huge zelkova tree. There was also pond nearby and forget-me-not flowers were in full bloom. Little birds tittered by the lawn for scavenge for food.</p>
<p>Adele patted the boy’s forehead to calm him down.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, it’s safe here. Only herbivores and friendly beasts come here.” Then her expression changed, “Which is why I don’t understand, a carnivorous animal appearing in this area out of the blue? It just feels strange.”</p>
<p>That was true.</p>
<p>Carnivorous monsters did not come to this section mountain very often because it was near human settlement, and they would risk being hunted for their valuable body parts. Likewise, the more docile beasts wouldn’t venture deep inside just to end up as fodder for more powerful beasts.</p>
