            <p><b>Chapter 119</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking of his question, Noah smirked and eyed the emperor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rayence’s body shook in indignation at the arrogance in the duke’s eyes. “How far have you been looking?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahh—!”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outnumbered knights in the throes of death cried out as they were soon slain by the hands of the enemy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor closed his eyes, consolidating his resolve to summon the army he had put in the dungeons. He needed them to save the palace, the city, and its people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had to, even if it meant returning some form of power to his rival. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he opened his eyelids, an undaunted expression flitted past his exquisite face as he issued an order to the commander of the imperial knights, “Release the Black Knights—let them fight!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-Your Majesty?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commander hurriedly nodded as he sprinted with all his might towards the gates of the underground cells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradually, monsters started to ascend the stairs of the palace and began attacking other people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah immediately split them in two with no hesitation whatsoever. Meanwhile, the emperor, who had a sword in hand, had a more indirect approach. He ordered the knights protecting him to do the work for him instead.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slash!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slicing the flesh of a small monster that launched a sneak attack on him, Rayence shook off the blood and frowned at the unappealing scent. Surveying his surroundings, he noted that the interior of the palace was utterly ruined. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah spoke in a low voice, adding fuel to his already despairing heart. “It wasn’t foreseen, it was planned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of answering, Noah swiftly cut down a monster that rushed towards the two maids. They were all curled up and trembling amidst this brutal situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah went closer and wiped the blood from the sleeping Adele’s cheek using the back of his hand. Without even turning his head to look, he made a piercing gesture with his sword and immediately impaled another unlucky creature, killing it instantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if feeling the warmth on her cheeks, Adele smiled faintly. Seeing this scene, the emperor smiled bitterly. “If you are happy… then that’s… enough for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sigh.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letting out a long breath of air, the emperor walked towards them and drew his sword, presenting it to Noah hilt-first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Duke Noah Maktus, a nobleman and knight, in the name of upholding the dignity of the Astrian empire against foreign invaders, I command you—!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then his voice boomed loudly,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Protect the palace!”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah knelt down on one knee and accepted the sword with both hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, I shall </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gladly </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">carry out His Majesty’s orders.” As an added bonus, he raised his eyebrows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor wanted to roll his eyes in irritation. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lost…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “This bastard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring the emperor’s words, Noah carried the sleeping Adele in one arm. She then subconsciously leaned closer to him and fastened her arms behind his neck, letting out a little sigh like a satiated cat. Suffice to say, Noah was immensely pleased with himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, he saw Adele’s broken necklace and muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was good that you left it as it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it was given by the emperor as a gift, he was hesitant in throwing it away, so he left it behind. This necklace was passable, as its magical powers not only healed her, but also purged the unclean energy in her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If not for that, given that it had come from the hands of that hateful emperor, he would’ve already chucked it far, far away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe the dark energy that entered her when he signed a contract back then had already left her body? Noah thought to himself, but he wasn’t sure if his assumption was correct. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, he was able to reap a great harvest this time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele had confessed to him, and that pesky, unwanted emperor who kept intruding on their relationship, had also been successfully subdued by him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am satisfied.” Noah raised the corners of his lips as he caught a glimpse of the emperor staring at him with a bewildered expression. Walking straight past a broken wall with a protruding floor, he glanced down and saw familiar looking men coming out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Knights were finally free from the underground prison!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip was on his mount and was conducting an aerial inspection when he caught sight of his commander. Soon he grabbed the reins of a bird beast who had no rider in them and subsequently approached them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah straddled the bird without hesitation, securely tucking Adele into his arms, and addressed his men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under His Majesty’s orders, the Black Knights shall protect the Imperial Palace!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed his sword towards the sky and gave a domineering command.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Show no mercy!”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loyal Black Knights picked up their own swords and held it up high as they let out a deafening roar. Altogether, they pierced their swords into the earth and swore allegiance once more to the only master they would ever acknowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, like an unstoppable force not to be reckoned with, they began their slaughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Imperial Knights stared on dumbly as the obstacles they faced earlier with extreme difficulty, were being butchered so quickly with their superior skills. A beast going toe to toe with one of them could only last 5 seconds, with the worst being half a minute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They started questioning life, how can the gap between them be this big?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah watched the scene being organized. He then kissed Adele’s sleeping forehead that caused her to rouse from her sleep. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She opened her eyes faintly, “Noah…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sleep a little longer, darling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distraught by his words and by always finding herself in an unconscious situation, Adele fell into slumber yet again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah stared at her tender face with loving eyes. Kissing her small nose, he whispered, “We’re going home soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, he pulled on the reins.</span></p>
