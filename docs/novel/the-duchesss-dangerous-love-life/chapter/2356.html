            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p>
<p>At the entrance to the castle of the Duke of Maktus, merchants and servants piled the goods carried on the ship. At the forefront stood Enon, the head of the Maktus family, looking through the goods. Adele, standing behind him, handed him a sheet of paper with the list of items.</p>
<p>“Enon, here,” she said.</p>
<p>“Hm,” he said turning to look at her. Adele’s light brown hair and hazel eyes shone.</p>
<p>Her features would be considered plain conventionally but her sweet temperament won over people readily. Enon, looking at her, thought he was lucky to have a person like her by his side. He took the paper.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’ll be along, soon,” said Adele, “Don’t push yourself too hard.”</p>
<p>“Push myself?” said Enon, smiling, “It’s you who works harder than me. You worked so hard to prepare for this voyage. The Emperor gave the order out of the blue…”</p>
<p>Their country, Astria, always had trade problems with the neighboring country, Telen. The Emperor had instructed the Duke of Maktus to build goodwill with Telen before the divide between the two countries worsened.</p>
<p>There had been a lot of preparation for gifts and exchanges that was to be offered to the other country. “It’s alright,” said Adele, smiling, “I have always had a knack for these kind of jobs since my parents hold top positions as well. It wasn’t very difficult.”</p>
<p>“Just as well that this nerdy guy has a capable wife like you,” said Enon.</p>
<p>“You are the Duke,” said Adele, “You are capable enough. And flattery will get you nowhere.”</p>
<p>When Adel gently patted him on the shoulder and Enon’s face flushed. He took her hands in his. “I will buy you whatever you want this time,” he said, “You can look forward to it!”</p>
<p>Adele smiled. “I will be late,” she whispered in his ear. “Go now.”</p>
<p>“There is still time!” said Enon, “Ah, there is Noah.” He pointed to a figure on a horse galloping towards the castle. Adele saw his reach the castle and getting off the horse. He took off his helmet to reveal his messy black hair, sharp jawline and tanned skin. His golden eyes gleamed. She avoided looking at him.</p>
<p>As usual, the women who were present blushed as he arrived.</p>
<p>“Is that Noah Maktus?” asked one.</p>
<p>“Yeah. He saved the Emperor’s sister by breaking through a thousand enemy troops in the last war,” said another.</p>
<p>“I heard he never missed a single enemy, and he killed them all.”</p>
<p>“He is so handsome!”</p>
<p>No one particularly understood the foreign tongue of the merchants. Noah just looked at them as they talked, his curious gaze making them smile and blush instantly.</p>
<p>Upon reaching his brother, his wife at his side, Noah shook his Enon’s hands.</p>
<p>“Noah!”</p>
<p>“Brother.”</p>
<p>Enon grinned. “Been so long since I saw you!” He then glanced at Adele, as though seeking her permission to introduce her to Noah. She nodded and gave him an awkward smile.</p>
<p>“This is your sister-in-law, my wife, Adele.”</p>
<p>Adele met his striking golden eyes. He looked beastly, so to speak. Cold and ruthless. She flinched without meaning to. Noah raised an eyebrow at her involuntary reaction.</p>
<p>“Sister-in-law,” he said, “nice to make your acquaintance.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said, “Nice to meet you too.”</p>
<p>Adele lowered her head after the introduction. Noah, meanwhile, cleaned his sword on the grass and sheathed it. The smell of blood invaded Adele’s nose and she tried not to gag. Adele went pale seeing the amount of blood.</p>
<p>“Adele,” said Enon with worry, “You are suddenly pale. Are you okay?” He held her by her shoulders, gentle but firm. “Is it the blood?”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head trying to tell him that she was alright. Enon rubbed her back softly to soothe her.</p>
<p>Noah mouth twitched. He only seemed amused.</p>
<p>“I feel sick…” Adele said wearily, finding support in her husband.</p>
<p>“Oh, can I now expect a nephew, sister-in-law?”</p>
<p>Adele’s body stiffened at the word nephew. Enon, who had alternated between the two, sighed and asked the maid standing next to her. When the maid took the faltering Adele, Enon put his hands on his waist.</p>
<p>“Why are you cleaning up your blood here? She has a weak stomach,” Enon said, sounding annoyed.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know that,” Noah replied.</p>
<p>“It’s been two years since we got married, but you’re still having a hard time getting along with her… Oh, and also, pay some attention to your sister-in-law, and don’t make silly jokes.”</p>
<p>“I’m already giving her a lot of attention.”</p>
<p>“Oh really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, excessively.”</p>
<p>“Stop with the jokes!” Instead of answering, Noah looked at Adele sitting far away. A drop of water flowed from her lips to the elegant arch of her white neck, a drop she had not swallowed.</p>
<p>Crumpled forehead, he followed at it persistently with his eyes half closed.</p>
<p>Sensing his gaze, Adele turned her head to the side and their eyes locked.</p>
