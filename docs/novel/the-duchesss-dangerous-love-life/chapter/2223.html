            <p><strong>Chapter 134</strong></p>
<p><em>He’s… truly handsome.</em></p>
<p><em>What should I do?</em></p>
<p>There are probably only so many men in the Empire who are able to look this breathtakingly good in a white shirt.</p>
<p>And how the veins on his hand protrude slightly from holding the pen, Adele found it strangely sexy.</p>
<p>And the way he runs his fingers through his slightly damp hair, with traitorous strands framing his forehead that only added to his appeal…</p>
<p><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p>Adele slowly closed her eyes as she reveled in his beauty.</p>
<p>From worrying about Noah’s injuries and him not waking up, to finishing her tasks as the lady of the castle, and now watching him work… Slowly, her fatigue started to settle in and she soon fell asleep.</p>
<p>Feeling something unusual, Noah lifted up his head and saw her dozing off.</p>
<p>“Adele?”</p>
<p>He thought it was just his servant sitting on the sofa and thumbing through the papers. To think it was actually her?</p>
<p>Staring at the woman on the cushioned sofa and watching the subtle rise and fall of her chest, Noah slowly got up and carefully approached her.</p>
<p>When he sat down next to her, her features were magnified by his affectionate gaze that he could see every little detail about her. Especially the way her pink lips parted slightly whenever she exhales.</p>
<p>He unconsciously stroked her lips with his finger.</p>
<p>“Hmm… ”</p>
<p>Adele let out a breath that sounded like a sigh.</p>
<p>Noah carefully lowered his head to check if he had gained courage. He then noticed her hair was damp, most probably from being washed, and he could detect the faint scent of flowers coming from her.</p>
<p>The gap between their lips gradually narrowed.</p>
<p>A soft, feather-light kiss followed. But soon, it increased in fervor and their tongues began to entangle as he invaded the inside of her mouth.</p>
<p>Adele wrapped her arms around his shoulders in a dream-like state, knowing it could only be her husband who would kiss her like this. But as he grabbed her own shoulder, she felt his hand tremble slightly and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>His eyes nervously glanced at her as it darted from left to right, and back at her.</p>
<p>“I-I didn’t mean to… that is…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He stammered, “A-as you said, w-we are a couple, so…”</p>
<p>“… ”</p>
<p><em>“Damn it!”</em> he cursed. “I’m so sorry, I went overboard.”</p>
<p>Noah thought he had gone mad and blamed himself.</p>
<p>Even if she was his wife, it was only right to get her permission first before he touched her like this. He quickly got up from his bent position to distance himself from her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Adele grabbed the hem of his shirt. “It’s alright. I just… thought you already went back to your usual self.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Because you would often touch me like that.”</p>
<p>“Even when you are sleeping?” When she nodded her head, Noah clenched his fists in shock and anger. “Did I really do that?”</p>
<p>“…yes.”</p>
<p>“I mistreated you…”</p>
<p><em>How could I have done that?</em></p>
<p>Noah put his hand on her shoulder with a remorseful and wretched expression, then he sat down with his back to hers.</p>
<p>Adele shook her head. “No. You did not mistreat me, we are a couple—”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“For acting like a scoundrel. Even if we are married, I shouldn’t have treated you the way I did.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>“Damn it all!”</em></p>
<p><em>Why was I such a scumbag?</em></p>
<p>He claimed her, his previous sister-in-law, as his own wife, then touched her body as he pleased. It was nothing short of callous.</p>
<p>Noah couldn’t fathom how his 27-year-old self managed to mistreat her so badly like this. Stealing her from his brother, letting her be tired from overworking, then touching her without her consent?</p>
<p>Noah gripped his head with both hands.</p>
<p>The woman he had yearned for when he was 17… was this how he treated her? How come he had devolved into this deranged man? What other monstrosities did he do to her that he had yet to remember?</p>
<p>He turned his head to look at her, thinking that she was probably scared inside and just chose to submit to him because of his rank and their marital status.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. If it makes you uncomfortable, I won’t touch you without permission.” He already said so, but still, there was this desperate look in his eyes that he tried so hard to rein in. A hot passion that wanted her.</p>
<p>Adele looked at his blushing ears and carefully raised her hand. Touching his face and ears, he frowned and bowed his head.</p>
<p>“Uh…?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry.” she giggled. “You’re just too cute right now.”</p>
<p>His bottom lip unconsciously protruded into a pout, “Don’t treat me like a child.”</p>
<p>“Did you feel bad when I touched you?” she asked. Then, when Adele tried to lower her hand, Noah grabbed hold of it.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t feel bad either. I only pretended to feel unwell, but when you touched me… <em>it felt good</em>.”</p>
<p>Noah’s eyes widened as Adele whispered the last words.</p>
<p>Adele shook her head, her cheeks flushing in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Soon their eyes met and the desire to touch her welled up inside him. His two hands slid off her shoulders and rested at the small of her back. When he asked with his eyes if it was okay, Adele nodded her head.</p>
<p>His hands gradually moved from her back towards her chest.</p>
<p><em>So soft…</em></p>
<p>She felt so good in his palms.</p>
<p>Noah lost his mind and fondled her chest.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>At Adele’s slight moan, Noah paused for a moment, but moved again when he felt no resistance. Even though he couldn’t remember, it was like he knew exactly where and how to touch in order to properly stimulate her body.</p>
<p>“Ugh… ”</p>
<p>Body tingling at the pleasurable sensation, Adele averted her gaze in shame. Noah reflexively stretched his hand behind her and untied her night clothes by pulling the ribbon at the back.</p>
<p>The soft material slowly cascaded down her shoulders and exposed her delicate upper body.</p>
<p>“Ah… ”</p>
<p>Adele was a little flustered at his not-so-inexperienced action. Wasn’t his mindset still seventeen? How come he knew how to skillfully remove her clothes? I heard he was on the battlefield when he was 17. Then, was he born with these skills?</p>
<p>Or at that age, did he… <em>experience</em> other women before her?</p>
<p>Noah stared at her creamy white breasts and whispered.</p>
<p>“Can I… lick it?”</p>
<p>“…only a little.”</p>
<p>Usually he would caress her breasts so much until she would let out a moan. But Noah, only having the memory of a 17-year-old, would have a different approach.</p>
<p><em>Smooch.</em></p>
<p>As she expected, Noah kissed her in the middle of her chest… <em>very politely</em>.  He then gently suckled on her nipples while his mouth and swirled his tongue around them.</p>
<p>”Mmm…”</p>
<p>Even her small moans were incredibly stimulating to him and he felt himself getting even more aroused.</p>
<p>Adele fisted his shirt in her hand, enjoying the tingling feeling coursing all throughout her body.</p>
<p>Parting his mouth slightly, Noah paused to marvel at the sight of her. Then he raised his head to kiss her lips while gripping her small waist and playing with her breasts.</p>
<p>Adele instinctively wrapped her legs around his waist and rubbed her core against him, trembling in anticipation at the thought of him possessing her body with his member.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Noah spoke as he looked down at her worriedly, “Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What? Oh… no.” Her mind was a bit hazy, so it took a whole second for Adele to process his words. “Why…?”</p>
<p>“Can I touch you somewhere else?”</p>
<p>Adele nodded her head.</p>
<p>Noah’s hand went down to her hip, his big hands began kneading her voluptuous butt. Then with his middle finger, he pressed the flesh in the middle of her buttocks to stimulate it.</p>
<p>Adele, whose sensitive area had just been stirred, let out a moan that was even louder as compared to before.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Listening to her making such erotic noises and the way her body arched so teasingly, he knew her moans weren’t sounds of pain. Emboldened, he pressed harder and brought his other hand to her waist.</p>
<p>This time, Adele got up.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch me there.” she muttered with an embarrassed look.</p>
<p>“Your waist? What—<em>why?</em>” It wasn’t a sensitive part like her chest, so he wondered why he couldn’t touch her there.</p>
<p>As Noah gazed at her quietly, Adele turned her head away. “I recently gained weight…”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>She glared at him.</p>
<p>“It’s because of you! You told the maid to give me more food!”</p>
<p>Still glaring at him with tears in her eyes, Adele remembered the high-calorie desserts she had to eat these past few days.</p>
<p>The seventeen-year-old Noah, unable to understand her, blinked his eyes and looked at her waist and noticed just a little bit of belly fat.</p>
<p>He held them in his hand.</p>
<p><em>Why is it so cute…?</em></p>
<p>Noah grinned and touched it gently, despite her obvious reluctance. “Don’t worry, it’s okay.”</p>
<p>“What’s oka—” her words were cut off.</p>
<p>“It’s cute.”</p>
<p><em>Smooch.</em></p>
<p>Noah kissed Adele’s belly and for a moment, she was mesmerized by his caring smile. She wrapped her legs around his waist and he supported her back as he pulled her up.</p>
<p>“Go to the bedroom.”</p>
<p>“…?!!!”</p>
<p>“If you pull the bookshelf at the middle, t-the bedroom will appear.” Then, she breathily added with a low voice. “<em>Hurry..</em>.”</p>
