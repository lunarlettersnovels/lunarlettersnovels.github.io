            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 21</strong></p>
<p><em>Why is she here?</em></p>
<p>Noah quickly approached her when he saw that she was about to fall and held her in his arms. He then immediately pulled her back and softly stroked her light brown hair with his hand.</p>
<p>Noah pressed his lips to her hair. Adele stared at him in surprise.</p>
<p>Her pale skin, shiny eyes, and long fluttering eyelashes were so gorgeous. He also really wanted to bite at those red cheeks and puffy pink lips that enticed him over and over again.</p>
<p>Like any other day, she tied her hair into a ponytail that showed her white neckline. He glanced over those slender shoulders and hugged her tighter.</p>
<p>“You’re not here because you miss me.” He stated. Noah already knew her for some time to know that she held no affection for him.</p>
<p>She just silently gazed at him.</p>
<p>“What is the matter?”</p>
<p>Adele realized that she was in his arms and hastily tried to escape. Her struggle cost her a bit of strength but to Noah, it was just something akin to an adorable rebellion. He looked at her rustling in his arms with a satisfied glint in his eyes, then he shifted his gaze.</p>
<p>Philip, the commander of the First Army Battalion was with his henchmen and Lina stood behind them. The commander shrugged as he glanced at them, unable to grasp the situation, as if everything had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>“I just guided the lady into the tent.”</p>
<p>Philip, with red hair and a neat face, recalled the time he met with the madam just a while ago.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>A few moments earlier…</em></p>
<p>“Damn it, our time must’ve come.”</p>
<p>In front of the iron bars at the Knights Templar Training Ground, Philip looked around. He was trying to find out if that person he was looking for had come. Unfortunately, there was no one except for two knights guarding the entrance. One of them hesitated, but then approached Philip and asked.</p>
<p>“A question for the commander, is there a problem?”</p>
<p>“Did the blonde-haired girl who came yesterday come again today?”</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen her today. Is she coming again today? Who is she?” the other knight’s tone turned somewhat gossipy.</p>
<p>“Someone I can’t ever understand. Ha, there is no need to know.” Philip sighed and shook his head. His head hurt as he recalled the woman who came by yesterday to the training grounds, with divorce documents on her hand, saying she couldn’t believe what was happening.</p>
<p>By now, the head commander must be in a good mood after hunting monsters, but if he knew about this…</p>
<p><em>What a terrifying thought</em>. Philip’s complexion became pale and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell this to anyone. Understood? If he hears about this, we will be tortured by him for two weeks.” If Noah was in a bad mood, he would personally lead knights’ training. Very harshly at that. The knights shook their heads as they recalled the terrible memory.</p>
<p>“Yes, we understand. But he seems to be in a good mood often after he got married.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, he went on a monster hunt today.” This statement was more than enough to make them anxious.</p>
<p>“Ah! T-then will we have a battle simulation training today?” A knight shuddered subconsciously.</p>
<p>“Maybe, if his mood gets worse.”</p>
<p>They clamored together, “We must avoid it at all costs!”</p>
<p>When Philip nodded, the knights followed him and their faces turned pale. One of them stuttered. “I-is there any way to make his mood better?”</p>
<p>“Hah, fool. There is no way! I have served him for so many years, so I know—” Philip abruptly cut off his speech. At the end of his gaze was Adele coming down from the garden stairs and walking towards the training grounds’ door.</p>
<p>He suddenly said, “There might be a way.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” The other knights were confused.</p>
<p>“We can survive this.” Philip said, this time, with more conviction in his voice.</p>
<p>Remembering his lord who had become a bit more elated and a little less cranky after the wedding, Philip had goosebumps. He quickly rushed to Adele.</p>
<p>“Milady!”</p>
<p>Adele blinked as Philip called her. He ran to her with a hopeful face.</p>
<p>“Milady, how may I help you?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I came here to visit the lord, but who are you?” Adele found it a bit peculiar that a knight would approach her out of the blue. But Philip just grinned as he knelt down with a fist on his chest</p>
<p>“I am the lord’s henchman and the first unit commander, Captain Philip!”</p>
<p>“Ah, I think I saw you at the wedding.”</p>
<p>It was the knight who had beaten Lina at the wedding and won the bouquet. His red hair was quite easy to remember. Adele waved her hand up and down.</p>
<p>“I remember. Philip, arise.”</p>
<p>“It is an honor, milady!”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to feel honored.” Adele could not understand the actions and thoughts of the knights. She sighed at the thought of having to meet them often. Philip’s eyes lit up and he motioned towards the door.</p>
<p>“I will show you the way to the lord, milady.”</p>
<p>“There is no need for that. I can just go—”</p>
<p>“Please! Give me the honor of leading the way!”</p>
<p>Adele only lowered her waving hand at his firm attitude. Philip listened to her sigh, but ignored it and took the lead. The tightly closed gate opened, he beckoned Adele to enter first.</p>
<p>“Milady, shall we go? My legs are so excited to get out of here.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes…”</p>
<p>Philip, who made a nonsensical sound, jumped and took the lead. Lina, who was following behind him, whispered to Adele, “Milady, is there a possibility that he likes you?”</p>
<p>“Be careful of your words.”</p>
<p>“Yes, milady.” the reprimanded Lina hastily replied.</p>
<p>Philip glanced back while humming a tune. “Milady, be careful with where you place your feet. There is mud underneath.”</p>
<p>“… I will take note of it.”</p>
<p>He fussed some more, “We are already near, but do tell me if your legs hurt, milady.”</p>
<p>Philip said while pointing to the tent in the distance. Adele nodded her head to indicate yes, and silence fell after that. <em>Ahem</em>, he cleared his throat and opened his mouth to get rid of the awkward atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Milady, may I… ask you something?”</p>
<p>Adele laughed softly. His commander’s wife was uncomfortable, so she thought that he was just talking to her to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“How did our commander propose to you?”</p>
<p>She immediately became speechless.</p>
<p>Philip spoke again as Adele frowned in embarrassment. “I never thought that he would get married.”</p>
