            <p><strong>Chapter 76</strong></p>
<p>“This is too much, Your Majesty! You’re taking away the knights we’ve painstakingly raised!”</p>
<p>Marquis Leanon bellowed in fury.</p>
<p>It was rude, but the others had the same thought as him, so they naturally had no thoughts of berating him.</p>
<p>Because this was equivalent to the emperor stating that he would pursue absolute monarchy, the only man who could control the army of the country. As part of the nobility, what was the one thing they feared the most?</p>
<p>It was the lack of power and authority!</p>
<p>If the emperor decided to ransack their homes, who would defend them? Their knights were already in the army! Sure, they could train new ones, but it would take years! And they could all end up inside the national army.</p>
<p>Rayence put down his teacup and beckoned to his servants again. “I never said that I won’t be giving anything in return.”</p>
<p>Another document was placed in front of them.</p>
<p>They brusquely grabbed the paper and quickly read through them.</p>
<p>It was a reward, that if the knights belonging to them were given to the Armed Forces and they participated in the war or made a contribution, the profits would be distributed at 50%.</p>
<p>It was an unbelievably huge reward. In a war, they could plunder countries and it remains as something that is highly profitable, with tens of millions of gold already being a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>It was a very coveted price.</p>
<p>“If this happens, you won’t be forced to participate in the war directly. By receiving the decree, you would only need to receive compensation once everything is over.”</p>
<p>The people inside the room were torn. They wanted it, but at the same time they didn’t. It meant they would have to rely on the mercy of the emperor.</p>
<p>“For the price of taking away the knights that you cherish, I’m already being generous.”</p>
<p>The emperor slowly swirled the tea in his cup. His bearing appeared a little laid-back, but there were some that was already aware of the ruthlessness hidden within.</p>
<p>The nobles began to mumble, everyone was in a dilemma. Their eyes are clouded by the huge profit. The chaplain, who had been looking at them as they were arguing, approached the emperor and whispered.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, what if they unite and oppose…? This seems to be too much.”</p>
<p>The emperor mused. This chaplain was right—he really was making an irrational choice. But this had to be done.</p>
<p><em>Because…</em></p>
<p>“I am aware of the consequences.” The emperor mentioned instead.</p>
<p>The army of Duke Maktus was strong. From barbarians to monster troops, they faced powerful enemies and had never suffered a single defeat. If the nation’s military army was eventually formed, only then, would they have the chance to face off against Noah’s Black Knights on equal grounds.</p>
<p>However, if Noah chose to recruit troops from the sidelines to fight back, a civil war would erupt.</p>
<p>He was not an easy opponent. Therefore, Rayence himself had to strengthen his own army to improve his chances of winning.</p>
<p>His mind pictured Adele in Noah’s arms, he clenched his fists beneath his robes.</p>
<p>“If I don’t do it like this, I won’t be able to have her.”</p>
<p><em>To cause destruction for a beauty…</em></p>
<p>Rayence was willing to go into this path, blinded by his love and desire.</p>
<p>Ambient rays poured in through the windows. With his head raised, the emperor’s hair shimmered like spun gold.</p>
<p>He looked so charismatic, like a magnificent creature wrought by the mellow light of the sun. In the room, all servants had gaping mouths and admired the emperor’s beautiful figure, uncaring if they were straight men themselves.</p>
<p>Tranquility flowed inside the place for a short moment, until the sound of the eldest servant’s cough disrupted them all from their reveries.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“S-so, I have already sent your opinion that stood against turning the Knights Templar into the emperor’s Armed Forces.”</p>
<p>In stark contrast, the Maktus’ family castle had the opposing party, that consisted of nobles and their financial advisors, sitting in his study. One of the advisors trembled and the others fared no better. There were some that even visibly gulped and glanced at the man in charge.</p>
<p>Noah, who was sitting in the front, irately took off his glasses and pressed his forehead.</p>
<p>“I thought I’ve made my stance clear?”</p>
<p>The person he questioned was already sweating buckets.</p>
<p>“You should’ve stated that it was impossible for me to agree to anything, not just giving a meagre opposition.”</p>
<p>The advisor gave a pensive look at incensed man before him and sighed inwardly, he really felt like dying these days.</p>
<p>It was because he didn’t know that the duke, who he thought was only good at sharpening swords, could do political job like this. He also did not know that he could control his subjects so thoroughly. In his mind though, he consequently thought that he was a great man that was good in many things.</p>
<p>He then said cautiously, “Uh… His Majesty, The Emperor, made it seem like he was giving us a good offer and exhorted his own opinion strongly. It was quite hard to oppose him. As you may know, it is His Majesty that holds the civil servants together—”</p>
<p><em>Smack!</em></p>
<p>Noah put the pen down harshly. The jittery ones have already jumped from their seats and hastily pulled themselves together. He lifted his head slightly and viewed them with eyes full of anger. Everyone in the study shrank their necks and bowed.</p>
<p>Noah raised the corners of his lips caustically.</p>
<p>“I am the duke of this nation, who commands the most formidable army in the entire Astrian empire.” He asserted in an unnervingly, steady tone. “Am I not?”</p>
