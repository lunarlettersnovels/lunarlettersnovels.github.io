            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Prologue</strong></p>
<p>The lights were bright at the first night. The dark interior was adorned with red fabrics across the ceiling, fluttering, and the red candles emanated a soft glow. Sitting on the edge of the bed in a slip, Adele grabbed her hem with trembling hands. The maid who was tying her slip’s bre@st strap noticed her disquietude.</p>
<p>“Is everything alright, my lady?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I seem to have trouble breathing,” replied Adele, raising her head in labored breaths. She looked at the reflection in the mirror in front of her. The maid had put the mirror on the table to dress her.</p>
<p>Adele had luscious, light brown hair but her face had turned pale. Her hazel eyes trembled. She had nice, sculpted features and pink lips. She turned the mirror away and sighed wearily.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to untie your slip, Madam?” asked the maid.</p>
<p>“No, it’s alright,” said Adele.</p>
<p>The maid knew that Adele was nervous about her first night, that too at age of thirty-two. It was her second wedding. The maid thought maybe she could offer some words of consolation when heavy footsteps were heard and a sort of clanging sound.</p>
<p>The sound was from joints of armor clashing with each other. Adele turned and looked towards the sound. It was her husband, Noah, who stood at the entrance of the bedroom. Dressed in black armor, he stepped on the white mat just inside the door, leaving muddy footprints.</p>
<p>Adele tried not to tremble at the overbearing appearance of Noah. He took off his helmet revealing dark hair and tanned skin. Noah glanced at Adele with sharp golden eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>Adele bit her lower lip. The maids, scared of Noah, blushed at his smile. They offered to remove his armor, but he dismissed them.</p>
<p>“Leave us,” he said in a low, velvety voice.</p>
<p>The maids scurried out of the room. Now it was only them, Adele and Noah. She pulled at the bed sheets in apprehension. He walked towards the bed where she was seated and Adele lowered her head.</p>
<p>Screech. A door opened—Noah had made his way towards the bathroom instead. He didn’t so much as glance after her. When Adele heard the splash of water in the bathroom, she crawled to the corner of the bed and hugged her knees for comfort.</p>
<p>How she wished she could freeze time so that he never came out of the bathroom to her! But all her wishes were for nothing. Shortly, the bathroom door would open, and he would eventually emerge.</p>
<p>After a few moments, it did. She heard the bathroom door open and Noah emerged draped in a navy-blue bathrobe that tied around his waist and showed the length of his chest. He had another towel over his head, rubbing his hair dry. The water dripped past his golden eyes and down towards his nose and lips.</p>
<p>She heard rustling of closes as Noah untied the sash that tied his robe around the waist. His wide shoulders and muscular body shone in the moonlight. As the robes fell from his body, pooling to the ground, she saw his massive member between his thick, muscular legs. She caught herself staring and blushed.</p>
<p>She turned her head away. Noah walked to the bed and Adele flinched and scooted back to the corner of the bed, tying to create distance.</p>
<p>Seeing her cower away from him, Noah smirked. She looked into his golden eye. They were like a beasts’, full of passion. He wanted to devour her. She stiffened with fear.</p>
<p>“It’s our first night today,” he said in that low voice watching her cower. “You don’t have to curl up like that.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to do this, you know,” said Adele.</p>
<p>Noah asked, sitting at the edge of the bed. Adele flinched. He softened his tone a little. “What?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I am your brother’s wife,” she said.</p>
<p>“Not anymore,” he said, “My brother is dead.” He said it so nonchalantly, without emotion. Adele trembled as his hands touched her ankle.</p>
<p>“Who obeys such laws these days?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I do,” said Noah.</p>
<p>“Everyone puts their sister-in-law in the family registry and lets her live separately when they are widowed. Who is even getting married in such a way?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Noah grabbed her think ankle and pulled her down on the middle of the bed. She struggled to escape. The more she did, the more her slip came off, revealing her legs.</p>
<p>“L-let go…,” she said, gritting her teeth.</p>
<p>Ignoring her words, he caressed her legs along their lengths. He lifted her leg and licked it very slowly. He proceeded to do so along her inner th!ghs and bit them softly. Adele let out a m0an in surprise. She shivered and still he did not let go.</p>
<p>“Open…,” he said hoarsely. Adele didn’t. She clenched her legs tighter. “Sister-in-law, spread your legs for me.”</p>
<p>Noah pried her legs open and placed his head between them, licking her softly, his hot lips pressed down on her most intimate parts. He lips found her cl!t and sucked on it. Adele jerked and m0aned.</p>
<p>His t0ngue then slid inside her and explored her most sensitive parts. Adele trembled and grabbed his head, her fingers in his hair, woven tightly.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh, no,” she cried, incoherently, “Yes, ahhh. Don’t….”</p>
<p>Noah stopped his tender abuses and slid his fingers inside her hot opening. She was wet but still her skin clenched around tight. He moved his fingers urging her to open wider. Adele arched her back.</p>
<p>“Ahhh,” cried Adele.</p>
<p>“My fingers are going to break, sister-in-law,” he said hoarsely. “How do I get myself in you when you’ve tightened it like this?”</p>
<p>A hard, hot thing touched Adele’s leg. It was the size of his forearm, dangling between Noah’s legs. He rubbed it and Adele tried to close her legs, but Noah’s fingers still entered her. Adele’s vision blurred.</p>
<p>His fingers moved frantically, and she felt the heat building inside her explode as reached her climax.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!” A flood of sticky liquid poured out of her. She was panting, her cheeks the color of red as Noah looked at her with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Adele blinked to clear her vision and gasped for breath. Slowly, Noah retracted his fingers from inside her. “Too fast,” he said as he looked down at her and winked. He stuck his tongue out and licked his fingers which still were smeared with her fluid.</p>
<p>How did this happen? Adele wondered. It was supposed to be chaste brother-in-law and sister-in-law relationship. It was from that day that their relationship had taken a different turn. Adele looked at Noah and closed her eyes.</p>
