            <p><strong>Chapter 34</strong></p>
<p>Adele almost facepalmed at her own words. Weren’t they too insensitive? Couldn’t attend a funeral for your dead husband because you were busy preparing to welcome another husband?</p>
<p>Either the countess’s thoughts didn’t align with hers or she deliberately ignored it.</p>
<p>“It is only right for me to attend, so don’t worry about that.” Then she noticed Adele’s state, “Your face has become so thin.”</p>
<p>Adele touched her face and felt a little conscious, “I’ve been busy lately, but don’t worry about it. I am fine.”</p>
<p>She clicked her tongue and glanced at Adele. Her rich light brown hair and elegant features were as beautiful as ever. But, unlike the usual, her chubby cheeks had turned slimmer. Countess Arsene sadly gazed at Adele and changed the subject quickly.</p>
<p>“I heard that you were closing the top-tier household?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. The owner is gone, so it must now be closed.”</p>
<p>The countess watched her with sympathetic eyes, “Tsk, you must be so sad about it. Now that we’re talking about it, weren’t you the one in charge of managing it?”</p>
<p>“I was only helping my husband.”</p>
<p>At Adele’s humble words, Countess Arsene looked at her with tender eyes. Unlike today’s young girls and young ladies, Adele was humble and polite. She had also been steadfast in helping her husband without any shortcomings. She was the best kind of daughter-in-law to the ladies of the older generation.</p>
<p>The Countess Arsene couldn’t understand why, two years ago, Madame Maktus would marry her eldest son to a woman of a low-ranked baron family. But now that she thought of it, Madame Maktus was wise.</p>
<p>The Countess Arsene’s forehead creased, remembering her own poor son. “Tsk.” <em>If only he had a wife like Adele, he would at least be able to act like a decent human being!</em></p>
<p>Adele looked at the countess, who appeared somewhat uncomfortable, and spoke. “I will be preparing for a tea party soon. But seeing one this fancy, I am quite worried I will not be able to live up to it.”</p>
<p>“Ah, have you never held a tea party before?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t. But now, I decided to host one. It’s just that,” hesitation appeared on Adele’s face, “there are a lot of things to think about. Any advice from the experienced countess? It would be deeply appreciated.”</p>
<p>“What do you expect from an oldie like me?” She may have answered coldly, but the corners of her mouth went up and she covered her face with a fan, she gave some advice anyways. “Flowers and decorations must be well-taken care of. Did you think of what teacup to use?”</p>
<p>At a tea party, the teacup was the pride of the hostess. Most of the wives invested half of their money in teacups. If the same sets were used at each tea party, there was no bigger shame than that because it showed how little their allowance was. It also showed their status and how pampered they were by their husbands.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the teacup at a tea party was the biggest concern of all the ladies.</p>
<p>Adele smiled, “Yes, I am planning to use the Risetta collection.”</p>
<p>“Risetta?”</p>
<p>Risetta was a brand that produces teacups to the point of perfection, it was created by a well-known artisan in the country. Due to its expertly crafted design and unique aesthetic appeal, it was too expensive, therefore, only a few ladies had it. Furthermore, there were only a few made at a time as they placed a big emphasis on quality.</p>
<p>When the supply cannot meet the demands, naturally, prices would skyrocket as people would almost pay anything for priority to get their hands on these prestigious teacups to show off their status and wealth.</p>
<p>In truth, the teacup in front of them right now was that of Risseta, but this was only possible because the hostess was a princess.</p>
<p>This shows how rare the Risetta was. From Adele’s reply, the Countess Arsene realized that Noah, had given her a large sum of money.</p>
<p>“Risetta,” The countess mused, “What a wise choice.”</p>
<p>Countess Arsene thought of Noah, the current head of state and the second son of the Maktus family. She thought he only married her because of the law, but… <em>Giving such a generous amount of money, didn’t this mean that the man has the heart for his woman? But Adele was his sister-in-law. Well, previously.</em></p>
<p>However, Adele was, by no means, the type to seduce the two brothers as rumored. The countess had been watching over them for the past two years, so she was certain of this. Then she recalled Noah who had a cold and sharp temper, very much unlike the first child who was cheerful.</p>
<p><em>Does the Duke truly like Adele</em>? Countess Arsene frowned.</p>
<p>Adele asked the countess who had an unseemly expression for some time now, “Madame, are you sick anywhere?”</p>
<p>“Ah, no. I just feel nauseous.” and the countess truly felt that way.</p>
<p>Adele felt flustered as she thought the countess really needed medical attention. Before she could call for assistance, a servant announced in a large booming voice.</p>
<p>“The princess has arrived.”</p>
