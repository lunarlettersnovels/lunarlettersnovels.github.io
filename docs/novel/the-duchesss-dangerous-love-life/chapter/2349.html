            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 8</strong></p>
<p>“Gosh!” Exclaims of the attendees could be heard inside.</p>
<p>“What in the world…”</p>
<p>“Too hot, ah!” The guests exclaimed and blushed.</p>
<p>Adele was startled by Noah’s sudden actions and tried to resist, but the more she did, the stronger his arms hugged her. As their dense kisses continued, all she could do was clench her fists with her trembling hands, his tongue continuously intertwined and rubbing against hers.</p>
<p>“Haha! Ah, I give my blessings to the beautiful couple!”</p>
<p>The embarrassed host’s words induced applause and celebration from the audience. People clapped urgently, only then did the gap between the two’s lips widened. Adele, whose face suddenly went red, turned her face away, eyes turning moist with shame.</p>
<p>But Noah just smiled contentedly and slowly wiped the smudged lipstick off her lips with his thumb.</p>
<p>“Next is the bride’s bouquet time. If you want to receive a bouquet, please come to the right of the pulpit!”</p>
<p>There was no one in the guest seat of the bride. She was from a low-status family in the southern mountainous region, so she couldn’t communicate between the ladies and attend the academy.<br>
The only person she could call a close acquaintance here would be Countess Arsene, who was already married. Even at her first wedding, she was awfully embarrassed by the absence of people at her side.</p>
<p>At the host’s guidance, she added more strength to her hand that was holding the bouquet. As the heartbroken Adele gently turned her head, an unexpected scene unfolded.</p>
<p>“Move! I will be the one receiving it!”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about battalion commander? I’m getting married next month! I have to get it! You don’t even have a lover!”</p>
<p>“Excuse me knights! The bouquet is supposed to be caught by a woman!”</p>
<p>The members of the Black Knights gathered together and were arguing on who should catch the bouquet. Next to them, the maid Lina, who was wearing the clothes Adele no longer used, scolded the knights. It seems that she was taking on the role of a noble woman so that her lady won’t be too embarrassed. Her supposed aristocratic behavior was atrocious, but Adele was deeply grateful to Lina for doing such a thing for her.</p>
<p>“Now, bride, please throw it!”</p>
<p>At the host’s urging, Adele turned around and threw her bouquet. Hoping Lina would catch it since she was already of marriageable age.</p>
<p>At the sound of a loud noise, Adele looked back.</p>
<p>“Got it!”</p>
<p>A red-haired knight smiled and shook the bouquet he caught. Lina, who was next to him, frowned. Looking at the ridiculous sight, Adele puffed and laughed a little.</p>
<p>Noah, who was standing next to her, said quietly while gazing at her. “You look prettier when you smile.”</p>
<p>“.…”</p>
<p>“It would be nice if you can smile like this tonight.” At his deep whisper, Adele stumbled and stepped back. He took her hand and kissed the back of it slowly.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Oh, where?”</p>
<p>“What a married couple would do at night.”</p>
<p>First night. There was nothing else but that.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to it.” He smirked.</p>
<p>“Are you serious about that?”</p>
<p>“Yes I am. Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for this?”</p>
<p>“.…” Honestly, Adele didn’t know what to say. Such a blunt statement, how was she supposed to respond?</p>
<p>“I couldn’t even sleep well because I could hardly wait.”</p>
<p>“You can sleep well later.” Adele turned her head to hide her red face. Noah smiled leisurely and touched her fingers one by one.</p>
<p>“What about you? Are you looking forward to it?”</p>
<p>She paused, then continued saying, “I have already been a married woman. At this age, I find it quite hard to be flattered.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then why is your face red?”</p>
<p>“I… I just feel hot.”</p>
<p>As soon as Adele turned her head, she could hear Noah’s soft laughter.</p>
<p>“What to do? It will be hotter later.” He said teasingly.</p>
<p>“.…”</p>
<p>Then he said in a suggestive tone, “If it gets very hot, then take your clothes off beforehand. Wait until I enter the bedroom.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! And be quiet! Someone might hear you!” She looked around. Fortunately, people were interested in the red-haired knight who caught the bouquet.</p>
<p>However, only one man, the emperor who wore a mask, was looking her way. Adele turned her face in embarrassment yet again. She faced Noah’s eyes that were filled with passion and felt hesitant, his stare was a bit frightening.</p>
<p>“Sleep if you’re tired.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Tonight, will be a long night.” Noah grinned and patted her hair. Her face was blushing and she couldn’t help but stare at him with her trembling lips.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As it was a remarriage, there was no need for a reception. The couple went off early to their chambers.</p>
<p>When she finally came to her senses, Adele was laying under a red lamp that was recently lit during dawn. In the dark bedroom, on the wide bed, Adele held her legs in her arms.</p>
<p>She was about to fall asleep, when the sound of water hitting the bathroom floor pulled her out of her reverie. Her new husband, Noah, was washing up.</p>
