            <p><b>Chapter 118</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commander of the Imperial Knights shouted, “Your Majesty! We can’t—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an order!” he gritted his teeth.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahhhhh!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A scream was heard from afar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor glanced downwards and saw that hundreds of monsters of differing race and size had already joined the fray and had locked their knights in battle, making them unable to leave unless they’ve defeated their opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commander’s complexion paled and urgently divulged to his lord. “Your Majesty! The remaining forces that we have are insufficient to deal with those beasts!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rayence tightened his fists because he knew it was true. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the civil war with Duke Maktus had ended, other nations wanted to take this prime chance when the country was at its weakest to get some benefits. War naturally broke out again among the borders, so it was imperative they send more men as troop reinforcements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this left the imperial palace with men that are only capable of protecting against a number of humans within an acceptable range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn’t enough to fend off an invasion of ferocious beasts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are currently facing a crisis that would definitely lead to the destruction of Astria if they don’t act fast enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was just that… The only remaining army he could mobilize was the Black Knights, who were imprisoned in the palace dungeons. The emperor thought hard of an alternative for the welfare of the country, but nothing else good came out. But all of a sudden, ten gigantic birds flew up the sky and attacked the pterosaur.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoooosh!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pterosaur counterattacked and swung its wings harshly, but the birds pierced the monster’s stomach by sticking out their tentacle-like tongues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nobles saw a ray of hope for their predicament and stared intensely at the sky. One of them pointed his finger at the man holding the reins of a bird.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-he is the battalion commander of the Black Knights!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? But weren’t all the Black Knights captured?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No! Some of them ran away and had a bounty attached to their heads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip was unaware that, at this moment, he was the most charming person in the eyes of the desperate nobles. He was too busy holding onto the reins and trying to calm this damnable bird beast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stupid bird, listen to me or I’ll eat you for dinner!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he felt something wasn’t right and glanced behind his fellow riders. “Oi, what’re you staring dumbly for? Attack!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Philip’s command, the other knights also pulled the strings on their mounts taut. Then, they began to attack more violently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights surrounded the monster on all sides and took turns in dealing short yet effective blows in critical areas, slowly wearing out the pterosaur. Confused and infuriated, the monster attacked with wild abandon in an attempt to kill them all at once using an area of effect attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this reckless action only hastened its impending doom. The Black Knights deftly maneuvered the birds and successfully evaded its fearsome attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After losing the majority of its strength and stamina, the monster was severely weakened, and the mounted knights used this opportunity to deal a killing strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pterosaur groaned in despair, then it began to descend from the air.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bang!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pterosaur fell straight down into the wedding hall, spiderweb cracks forming beneath its humongous body. A few more columns collapsed and the near-devastated walls near the monster completely broke in shambles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slightly emboldened knight went a little closer, but then he quickly retreated and yelled in fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pterosaur was still alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Imperial Knights drew their swords and immediately raised their wariness to the extreme. But as the monsters writhed and indiscriminately attacked people, Noah stood by the sidelines, unperturbed. He grabbed his sword and swiveled his gaze to meet eye to eye with the ruler of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Astria is in crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just so happens that my knights have encountered such monsters before.” the corners of Noah’s lips curved into a languid smile, “What a coincidence.” </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shing!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah cut off the pterosaur’s tongue which was about to emit another deadly ray of white light. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screeech!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing the sound of pain, he struck the monster’s neck. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thud!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pterosaur’s corpse fell limply to the ground. Covered in its blood, Noah released a chilling smile as he licked his lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a sworn protector of Astria, it is my duty to ensure the security of the empire and the safety of its citizens—” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ha!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sardonic laugh emanated from the emperor’s throat. Unbothered, Noah continued, “I hereby request permission from His Majesty, the Emperor, to allow this subject to carry out the mission to eradicate these unwelcome elements.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though he mentioned those words, not once did he kneel, nor did he speak in a respectful tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor clenched his fist at Noah’s shameless declarations. But from the painful screams of his men and the ravenous beasts continuing their incessant assaults, he knew time was of essence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frowning, he glanced at Noah with a skeptical look. “Have you learned how to control beasts during your expeditions in the northwest region?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t understand what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slash! </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah slashed the giant insect monster that creeped towards him with his sword. The emperor narrowed his eyes, feeling as if something was familiar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pretending to be a savior to clear your name of treason…” he laughed scornfully, “Am I correct?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah effortlessly decapitated another beast. “The emperor misunderstands, I only want to serve for the good of the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rayence was unconvinced, “When did you plan all this?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the moment I was sent to the northwest region, as per your royal order.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah answered inside his heart and brushed off the blood staining his sword. The northwest region was a place where there were many beasts of varying origins and classifications ran amok.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the emperor who kept sending him there to die, he was able to tame monsters and even managed to build a castle. Killing two birds with one stone. </span></p>
