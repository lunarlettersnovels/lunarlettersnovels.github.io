            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 30</strong></p>
<p>Adele was startled by his whisper, a million was already enough to buy a few households. Of course, it was just some spare change for him who had a troop of knights. But…</p>
<p>As she shook her head, Noah nipped at her neck, and she let out a soft gasp.</p>
<p>“Can you even borrow money by simply staying still? You have to at least satisfy me first, don’t you think so?”</p>
<p>Noah rubbed his lower body against her lower body. Adele shivered as his big, hard member kept rubbing against her bottom.</p>
<p>He took the opportunity to pull her into his arms. Adele turned around when she was suddenly placed on Noah’s thigs. With her eyes half-closed, he grabbed her face.</p>
<p><em>“Ugh.”</em></p>
<p>Thanks to the previous experience she had with him, she knew how to open her mouth while kissing. Noah stopped for moment after playing with her tongue, and smiled contentedly. “That’s right. You now know how to do it.”</p>
<p>Suffice to say, she was mortified.</p>
<p>“Stick out your tongue. I’ll suck on it.”</p>
<p>Adele meekly opened her mouth, and Noah’s tongue immediately slithered in. His tongue was fiercely conquering her inside, hungry and insatiable. She grabbed his shoulder, feeling the tongue rubbing against her rapidly increased in its intensity.</p>
<p>“Huff…”</p>
<p>Out of breath, Adele pulled away and pouted. Noah’s eyes zoned in on that protruding lip, his golden eyes contained a penetrating desire to play with a certain woman.</p>
<p>She panicked at his dreadfully piercing gaze and touched the corner of his eyes. She wanted to cover his eyes, but somehow touched his soft eyelashes and paused.</p>
<p>These eyelashes had always attracted her.</p>
<p>“What?” he asked, curious of her actions.</p>
<p>“It’s… beautiful.”</p>
<p>Instead of responding to her words, Noah licked her palm. Adele flicked her finger at the strange sensation. This time, he bit on her hand, sucked on it, and glanced at woman who shuddered at his touch. “I’m the one who’s supposed to say that.”</p>
<p><em>“Ugh.”</em></p>
<p>Noah’s tongue slid onto her wrist and then went down until it reached the inside of her elbow. With one swipe of his tongue, Adele bit her lip. Usually, men wouldn’t know how to play like this. But he knew a woman’s body all too well.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Adele groaned softly at the subtly burning pleasure. Noah put her hand in her slip and stroked the curve of her spine. At the end of it, he grabbed her butt.</p>
<p>“Ah! Please don’t grab it too hard.”</p>
<p>“Answer me. What do you want?”</p>
<p>Usually, a man shuddered when his wife said there was something she wanted. That’s why she couldn’t understand why he was so excited to fulfill her wants, if there was actually any. As Adele hesitated, Noah pushed his head. He sucked at her thickly swollen breast and lapped on it hard.</p>
<p>“Just say it. Money? Jewels?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I shall torment you until you answer me.” Noah continued fiddling with her n!pples, playing with it with obvious delight. “I’ll make it so that It’ll be so swollen, people will see it bulging from your dress.”</p>
<p>“Don’t… don’t do that.”</p>
<p>“The male servants who’ll see it would be aroused and rub their own private parts, while thinking of the Lady that had her bre@sts sucked last night.” Noah positioned his swollen appendage between her buttocks.</p>
<p>Appalled, Adele quickly refuted, “No one will think of such a thing!”</p>
<p>“You obviously don’t know men.”</p>
<p>“I am the lady of the house! Why would they do such a scandalous thi—”</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>Noah roughly ripped off Adele’s lingerie. Her body was still covered with the kiss marks he left yesterday.</p>
<p>“You don’t know that your body will make their manhood stand up when they see you?”</p>
<p>She furiously denied, “I am thirty-two, a-also—”</p>
<p>“Also?”</p>
<p>“Men don’t like girls of my type. They like elegant—<em>ugh!</em>”</p>
<p>It was Noah’s finger that cut off her words. His hand gripped her sensitive little bud and rubbed her moist opening. “Like what?”</p>
<p>She was momentarily disoriented, by she still understood his words. She breathed out, “Ah, ah, elegant and f-fancy, ugh…”</p>
<p>“Be specific.”</p>
<p>Noah’s rubbing became faster. The plump, swollen nether lips from last night was trembling and getting wetter and wetter.</p>
<p>“Slim legs, and—”</p>
<p>Noah stroked Adele’s thick thighs with the other hand.</p>
<p>“—slim waist—”</p>
<p>The hand that was on the thigh went to her waist and fondled with it.</p>
<p>“—with a sophisticated face.”</p>
<p>Noah stroked Adele’s round chin with his thumb and stared at her intently. Plump cheeks, a sharp nose bridge, light brown eyes, a round forehead, and tantalizing lips.</p>
<p>He couldn’t hold it in anymore.</p>
<p><em>Smooch</em>.</p>
<p>The sound of kissing echoed throughout the room. Adele remained still and poked at the tongue that entered her mouth. Noah wrinkled his eyebrows and smiled, then he grabbed her back and pushed her down. “Those are women of your taste.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>When Adele, whose sight had become blurry, asked Noah, he just tapped her inner lips and slapped it with the palm of his hand. Adele was jolted and felt a surge of pleasure coursing through her.</p>
<p>“Strange. There are no male servants here.”</p>
<p>“What do you… mean?”</p>
<p>“Have you done anything with your maids?”</p>
<p>Aghast, Adele rebuked his accusing words. “Stop saying those kinds of words. I did no such thing!”</p>
<p>While Adele was startled, Noah silenced her and patted her bottom. “Is that why they’re always sticking to you?”</p>
<p>“No! It’s not like that.”</p>
<p>“How do you do it with women? With your fingers?”</p>
<p>Noah rubbed her labia hard with his fingers. Before Adele could struggle, he slipped his finger in.</p>
<p>“Ah! Don’t—”</p>
<p>“I asked if you had fun with the maids instead of my brother.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t.” As Adele shook her head, Noah grinned and ran his fingers inside.</p>
<p>He plunged his fingers in and out as she leaned back and felt the rising momentum in her lower abdomen. Then he pulled his finger out.</p>
<p>Adele blinked her eyes at the sudden feeling of emptiness. Noah looked at the puckered hole and his head sank.</p>
<p>“Shall I put in another thing?”</p>
<p>“N-no, stop—”</p>
<p>“Like this one?” he said, as he pulled out his thickly erect member with bulging veins, slowly stroking it with his long fingers.</p>
<p>Adele felt ashamed and tried to close her legs. Noah caught her and rubbed his enraged manhood near her entrance.</p>
<p>“You’re all wet, you’re begging me to put it in, right?”</p>
<p>“I’m… I’m not here because of that.”</p>
<p>“Then what do you want.” Noah rubbed his swollen genitals against Adele’s thigh.</p>
<p>“Not that…”</p>
<p>“I’m asking you, what do you want?”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“There must be something, my dear wife, for you to come here.”</p>
<p>Tears flowed from Adele’s eyes as she stood up. Noah indulged her. “Tell me what you want”</p>
<p>She remained motionless.</p>
<p>“Seeing how you can’t speak, is it a huge amount of money? An impossibly expensive jewelry?”</p>
