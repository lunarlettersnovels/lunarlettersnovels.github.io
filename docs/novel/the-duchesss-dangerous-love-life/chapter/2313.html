            <p><strong>Chapter 44 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>“I will go inside the bedroom with her, bring the fever medicine inside.”</p>
<p>There was no other way to cure this. The only remedy was to take an antipyretic and release the heat inside the body through s*xual activity.</p>
<p>“But we have called the doc—”</p>
<p>“Shut up and do as I say.” At Noah’s words, the servants moved in a flurry.</p>
<p>As he entered the bedroom, a servant inside that was opening a window quickly hurried out. Through the closing door, Lina rushed in with something in her hand.</p>
<p>“Milord! The fever medicine!” she hastily said, slightly out of breath.</p>
<p>When Noah received the small bottle, he slammed the door completely shut. He pressed Adele’s cheek with one hand, opening her mouth, and started to pour the contents. When her lips met with the bottle, medicinal liquid began to flow.</p>
<p>He removed the clothes from her heated body. After that, he went into the bathroom and took an impossibly quick shower with cold water. He hurriedly came out and touched her forehead.</p>
<p>“F*ck, just how much was she fed that she’s already in this state?”</p>
<p>Noah touched Adele’s body with his cold hands. Her forehead and cheeks were warm, her neck and armpits were hot. Fortunately, her private region was lukewarm compared to others.</p>
<p>He hugged her tightly. Adele let out a moan and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>“It feels good…”</p>
<p>Her eyes were unfocused. Clearly, she wasn’t in her right frame of mind.</p>
<p>Noah looked down at her and spoke anxiously. “Adele, can you see me?”</p>
<p>“M-my body feels itchy, ah…”</p>
<p>“Come here.” Noah hugged her tightly. She tearfully quivered in his arms. He whispered, stroking her red cheek. “What happened?”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head and cried.</p>
<p>“I-I don’t know…”</p>
<p>Noah quickly wiped her cheek. Then with his cold hands, he caressed her whole body.</p>
<p>Adele let out a sigh. “It feels good… T-touch me more…” as she became more muddled by the minute, her actions became even more unconstrained.</p>
<p>Noah stared at her intently, “Where?”</p>
<p>Adele grabbed his hand and dragged it down to her chest. Noah, who was sitting leaning against the wall, wrapped one of his arms around her, and his other hand rubbed her round breasts.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah…”</p>
<p>“Where else should I touch you.”</p>
<p>Adele rubbed her hot cheek against Noah’s cold nape. His pupils dilated as she whined to him like a cat. Meanwhile, Adele felt the cold body temperature and gave a content smile.</p>
<p>“It feels good…”</p>
<p>Noah let out a groan as he felt himself aroused. He wiped Adele’s face and kissed her forehead.</p>
<p>She rubbed her face in his hands, visibly in a good mood, and closed her eyes. Noah frowned and hugged her tightly.</p>
<p>He bit her earlobe and the nape of her neck, and with his big hand, he stroked Adele’s back and squeezed her backside.</p>
<p>She moaned, “Feels so good…”</p>
<p>Adele instinctively wrapped her legs around his waist. When his member touched her flower, she moved her waist and rubbed hers against his.</p>
<p>Noah had a pained expression on his face. “Adele.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’re not in your right mind.” He inhaled deeply, “If you move like that, I might not be able to…”</p>
<p>Noah looked into Adele’s blurring eyes that lost their focus, he clicked his tongue.</p>
<p><em>Restrain yourself. The girl is sick now.</em></p>
<p>He was startled from his thoughts when he felt her warm touch, but then he put her body on top of him to allow her to get closer. Adele shook and her eyes glossed over.</p>
<p>“It’s unbearable…”</p>
<p>“Your chest? Stomach? Tell me where, I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>Adele stared at Noah, took his hand and pushed it down. As his long fingers touched her damp entrance, she looked up at him with pitiful eyes.</p>
<p>“It feels weird here…”</p>
<p>“Let me see.” Noah touched her folds with his thick fingers, it was wet and slippery as a result of the drug. He wanted to put his pen!s in at once, but there was an order to how things were done.</p>
<p>He grabbed Adele’s chin. “Open your mouth.”</p>
<p>Adele submissively opened her mouth. Noah smiled bitterly. “How nice would it be if you obeyed me like this every time.”</p>
<p>“Faster please…”</p>
<p>At the urgency in her tone, Noah pushed his tongue inside her lips. Adele sucked his hot tongue into her mouth, wildly lapping on it like a deprived woman. He grabbed her by the back of her neck and moved his mouth vigorously.</p>
<p>As Adele gasped and moaned, Noah parted his mouth for a moment.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Adele caught her breath for a moment, then suddenly grabbed back Noah’s face. As she kissed him, she tapped his tongue. Noah’s tongue re-entered her mouth she suckled at it again. This time, she gently wrestled her tongue with his.</p>
<p>Adele twisted her body.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>Noah opened his mouth and wiped her lips with his thumb. Adele’s chest swelled slightly, her n!pples erect. She let out a feeble moan as Noah twisted and squeezed her peaks.</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>“These beautiful breasts—”</p>
<p>“Lick it.” She ordered.</p>
<p>He was stunned, “What?”</p>
<p>“Lick it, like you always did…” Adele’s flushed face turned even redder.</p>
<p>It was very arousing to see her lewdly twisting her body. Noah could barely resist the urge to put his face in her chest and claim those breasts with his mouth. Things were already like this, but…</p>
<p>He wanted to see her plead.</p>
<p>As Noah remained still, she pulled at his face. “Suck it, please.”</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>“Please…” she groaned.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel like doing it today.”</p>
<p>Adele cried at his words. “Bad man. You suck when I tell you not to, and when I do, you…you…”</p>
<p>She took Noah’s hand, and this time, brought it to her folds.</p>
<p>“Touch me here…” Adele rubbed against Noah’s chest with an extremely reddened face. He kept kneading her chest. He even pinched her n!pples to stimulate her further, and Adele let out a pleasured groan.</p>
<p>She abruptly seized Noah’s member into her hands. It was the first time she ever held him by herself. She giggled and played with the tip.</p>
<p>“Really feels so good…”</p>
<p>Her hands moved awkwardly, like a child fondling with something unfamiliar. However, Noah’s member became harder and harder. Feeling the pleasure that continued to rise, he whispered in Adele’s ear with a voiced laced with desire, “Hold it up and down, and stroke it.”</p>
<p>Adele rubbed Noah’s genitals up and down with one hand. Afterwards, she quickly used two hands to do it. He put his hand between her thighs.</p>
<p>She was already incredibly wet.</p>
