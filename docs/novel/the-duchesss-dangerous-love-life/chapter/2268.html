            <p><strong>Chapter 89</strong></p>
<p>“My father has sent me a letter.” Adele uttered as she walked closer to him.</p>
<p>“Mn.” Noah pondered for moment before he spoke again, “Come to think of it, I haven’t even visited my father-in-law yet.” He added further, “He must miss his daughter so dearly.”</p>
<p>“We got married hastily. It’s alright.” She tried so console, although she wasn’t clear whether it was him or herself she was consoling.</p>
<p>She missed her father as well.</p>
<p>“I plan to visit them before the weather gets too cold for travel.”</p>
<p>“You mean ‘we’?” he grinned. “You’re not leaving by yourself. I’m coming with you.”</p>
<p>“.…”</p>
<p>“It is my duty to at least meet my wife’s father officially and fulfill my obligations as his son-in-law.”</p>
<p>Adele felt a little surprised by his words. Seeing his attitude towards her father, a man of a lower rank than him, warmed her heart and a soft smile emerged from her lips.</p>
<p>But Noah suddenly furrowed his eyebrows and said, “But that’s only secondary, I’m coming because I need to take you back with me.”</p>
<p>Adele was bewildered, “Huh?”</p>
<p>He gave her a pointed stare, “You may not want to come back here again after arriving at a place you like better, which is why I have to make sure you come back.”</p>
<p>A light sound of snickering was heard, the maids that were still inside the room struggled to hold back their laughter. Adele looked at him all suited up in his armor and tried to change the topic.</p>
<p>“Are you departing for another battle with monsters?” Adele spoke with concern, “Do you not feel afraid?</p>
<p>Noah approached her, “I am afraid, but not of monsters.”</p>
<p>He took her hand and gently massaged them with his thumb.</p>
<p>“What I fear more, is my wife being in danger, especially during the times when I’m not by her side.”</p>
<p>His golden eyes watched her in all seriousness that Adele became fidgety, “S-stop with this nonsense.”</p>
<p>She changed the topic again.</p>
<p>“Oh, right. How are you faring with the new law? Everyone else seems to be in a state of chaos because of it.”</p>
<p>Recently, nobles offered up their knights to the emperor.</p>
<p>When the law was first promulgated, they rebelled, but the profit to be given was too hard to ignore. They all gave in to the temptation and enlisted their knights into the imperial family’s army. Thanks to this, the only remaining private knights were the Black Knights of the Maktus family.</p>
<p>“If the emperor wants victory in any kind of war, he wouldn’t dare take my knights away.”</p>
<p>War isn’t solely won by numbers. Quality is as equally important, and the Black Knights are the strongest of its kind.</p>
<p>Although they might be small in number, they are unique assets that excel highly in both combat and strategy. One must remember that these exceptional knights has vowed their loyalty to Noah of the Maktus family, and they deeply respect him as well.</p>
<p>Another person would not be able to have them without any difficulties, not that they would they submit so easily either.</p>
<p>In short, the emperor would have men that is impossible to lead and is like a ticking time bomb. He would never be at ease knowing these knights could betray him at any time.</p>
<p>“I don’t like participating in wars, but I have to. Foreign nations are quite insistent on invading us. But enough about that, it looks like you’re going out…” he looked at her, all dressed up for an outing, “…somewhere, without even telling your husband.”</p>
<p>Noah didn’t know why he was feeling a little jealous, he just didn’t want her dressing up for another man.</p>
<p>“Ah, I was going to visit Count Arsene’s wife.”</p>
<p>“…” <em>Oh.</em></p>
<p>Adele continued, “Yes, she was close to mother-in-law and the countess visited when she was sick.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” Noah nodded his head, as if suddenly remembering a faraway memory.</p>
<p>Adele let out a sigh of relief and was a little perplexed. Countess Arsene had always visited them at least once a month, how could he forget about such a person so quickly?</p>
<p>“I heard she’s struggling with pneumonia.”</p>
<p>“With her advanced age, it ought to be normal.” He answered shortly.</p>
<p>“She’s a good person, so I need to treat her well before the time comes that I won’t be able to see her anymore.” After saying this, Adele felt a little sad.</p>
<p>Time is a blessing, but it can also be so cruel.</p>
<p>“This duchess, you recognize that she is good?” Noah uttered in mock surprise, “Have you also recognized how good I am too?”</p>
<p>Adele almost—<em>almost—</em>rolled her eyes. “Don’t you have knights waiting for you?”</p>
<p>She stood up as the maids tidied up the hem of her dress and they tactfully took a step back once everything was done.</p>
<p>Noah looked closely at her, who was staring back at him. Thanks to the deft fingers of her maids, her eyebrows arched delicately, and her lips were in a lovely shade of red that the sight kept tempting him to throw caution straight out the window.</p>
<p>Even though she didn’t have much cosmetics on her face, her white and lustrous skin with plump cheeks were so cute that he wanted to pinch her so badly.</p>
<p>He gently stroked Adele’s flattering jawline and pressed his forehead against hers. As she drew closer to his handsome face, she saw her maids bowing their heads urgently and pushed Noah’s shoulder. But he didn’t even budge.</p>
<p>“You’ll be late, the knights are waiting.”</p>
<p>“I still have time for a kiss.”</p>
<p>“Someone would see us.”</p>
