            <p><strong>Chapter 131</strong></p>
<p>This was a peculiar development that the newly arrived maids could not comprehend. What happened to their lord who was practically attached to the madam’s hip?</p>
<p>“Mn.” Noah nodded his head and was about to turn around when he chanced upon their strange expressions, “Why? What’s wrong? Ah, yes—tell her there’s no need to take the blame.”</p>
<p>It is highly likely that he and his ‘wife’ had some sort of relationship agreement between them and she was probably just being worried for appearance’s sake. His mind was fatigued and he wanted nothing more than to rest at the moment.</p>
<p>But just then, the door swung open and Noah swiveled his head to the direction of the noise.</p>
<p>“Noah!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>His lips parted slightly, and his lashes trembled.</p>
<p>Adele rushed into his arms and hugged him tightly, oblivious to the man’s clamorous thoughts and the look of pure disbelief on his face. Looking up at him, their eyes connected with each other as tears streamed down her face.</p>
<p>Noah felt his heart being jolted awake.</p>
<p>“Are you okay now?” she asked.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“If only you hadn’t protected me, you would’ve been fine…”</p>
<p><em>Sniffle, sniffle.</em></p>
<p>“What would I do if I lost you…”</p>
<p><em>Sniffle, sniffle.</em></p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Ah! I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I’m not mad at you, I’m just upset with myself…” As Adele shed her tears, Noah stroked her light brown hair with his trembling hand. Seeing him being so silent, Adele asked him cautiously as her anxiety skyrocketed, “Why aren’t you speaking?”</p>
<p>Noah quietly cupped her jaw and touched her tear-stained cheeks with his thumb. He still couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p><em>Is this woman my wife?</em></p>
<p><em>Am I really married to Adele?</em></p>
<p>A thought crossed his mind. Maybe he really was dying on the battlefield, and in the midst of it all, he was seeing his deep-seated fantasies? He didn’t believe in gods, but he thought if they were out there giving him these visions, he could peacefully pass on to the afterlife.</p>
<p>Noah gazed deeply into her glossy, light-brown eyes and lowered his head.</p>
<p>Then he kissed her.</p>
<p>Moist and soft to the touch—<em>it was real</em>. The woman he had longed for was truly right in front of his very own eyes.</p>
<p>This was neither a dream nor a fantasy and he still couldn’t believe it. With her occupying his entire vision, the hellish battlefield he thought he was in seemed to fade into nothingness.</p>
<p>Adele was conscious of his gaze around her and poked his thigh with her hand. “Really? As soon as you wake up?! I told you not to do things like this, especially in crowded places!”</p>
<p>“… are you really my wife?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Noah carefully grabbed her slender shoulder and said, “Answer me, Adellia Liliand.”</p>
<p>Adele fluttered her eyelids in embarrassment. She then nodded her head and he immediately hugged her tightly. A soft and supple body felt in his arms. Taking a deep breath, her citrus scent tickled his nostrils, and the gaping hole in his heart finally felt complete.</p>
<p>Noah looked at her again and smiled happily, “Ten years have passed, and you… ”</p>
<p>“What about me?”</p>
<p>“How are you still so…”</p>
<p><em>—so beautiful.</em></p>
<p>Noah gulped. He couldn’t fathom how she managed to be his, nor how she did not seem to age from the first day he had met her. Adele’s cheeks and ears slowly turned red from his stare, and she quickly covered her mouth with her hand.</p>
<p>“…so cute.” Noah murmured to himself.</p>
<p>Adele didn’t understand what he was saying and frowned, “What’s wrong? Are you hurting anywhere?”</p>
<p>But Noah simply looked at her stupidly, with eyes practically dripping with honey. Like a man enthralled by a siren’s song.</p>
<p>He asked, “How did we get married?”</p>
<p>“Hm? What do you mean? Don’t tell me you’ve already forgotten so quickly?”</p>
<p>Adele lightly chuckled, but the butler, who was just quietly observing by the side, hurriedly intervened. “Madam, the lord has no recollection of the events that happened after he was seventeen.”</p>
<p>Adele took a moment to process the words, then she gasped in shock. She turned to the doctor, eyes silently hoping for him to deny what had just been said.</p>
<p>The doctor answered in a comforting tone, “Please allow me to have a detailed inspection of the duke’s current situation first. May I request the madam to step outside for a moment?”</p>
<p>“Oh, okay. That would be… for the best.”</p>
<p>When Adele tried to get up from her seat, Noah grabbed her hand. As Adele sat back on her bed, Noah grabbed her hand and glanced at the doctor.</p>
<p>“Does she really need to leave?”</p>
<p>“…yes?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it enough to check just how much memory I have lost?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“If you can’t provide proper treatment just because there’s an extra person in the room, aren’t your skills terribly lacking? And you dare say that you’re the duke’s doctor?”</p>
<p>The doctor in question was taken aback for a moment by Noah’s biting tone, but then he coughed.</p>
<p>As a medical practitioner, he prioritized confidentiality, and this was just part of the protocol. He bitterly recalled those times he had examined husbands with their spouses present and diagnosed them with diseases that came from sleeping with… unsavory women.</p>
<p>What’s more, it was without the wife’s knowledge. Suffice to say, what happened next was chaos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the maids around them couldn’t hide the absurd expressions and took a peep at the couple—their lord held his wife’s hand so snugly, as if he would never let go of it for the rest of his life and defending against the evil doctor that threatened to take her away from him.</p>
<p>Ah, yes. That was the lord they definitely knew.</p>
<p>Adele was perplexed, but her heart was touched by Noah who held onto her like his life depended on it. She understood his predicament; his memories amounting to a decade were all gone, how could he stay calm?</p>
<p>She grabbed Noah’s hand and made him look at her. “Get medical treatment first, hm?”</p>
<p>Then she fixed his tousled hair and smiled softly.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about the fact that you lost your memory, you could be hurt elsewhere too. Listen to the doctor, alright? I’ll get you something to eat after you’re treated.”</p>
<p>“…” His eyebrows furrowed, “…don’t treat me like a child.”</p>
<p>Adele smiled awkwardly and lowered her hair. Looking at his side profile, it somewhat reminded her of the 12-year-old little boy she had met back then at the mountains.</p>
<p>Adele waved her hand, “I’m not. I’m just tidying your hair—”</p>
<p>“Alright, you can go.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to get treatment.”</p>
<p>At Noah’s words, Adele abruptly got up from her seat. From her periphery, she caught sight of his slightly reddened ears.</p>
<p>Mn. Just like when he was still a child—shy, adorable, and easily tickled.</p>
<p>She had forgotten about that side of him because she was more exposed to his domineering side. Have to say, she kind of missed his little bun-face.</p>
<p>Adele glanced at him, hesitating for a bit, then swiftly lowered her head and kissed him lightly on the cheek.</p>
<p>“See you later!” Then she hastily escaped out of the bedroom.</p>
<p>It was just a light greeting and everyone else regarded it as such, but Adele was notorious for being so bashful when they display affection in public. Hence, she rushed out with an embarrassed look and sped down the stairs.</p>
<p>Because of that, she didn’t know that Noah, whose face was so red, was glancing at her back in extreme wonder.</p>
