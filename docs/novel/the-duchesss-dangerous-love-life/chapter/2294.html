            <p><strong>Chapter 63</strong></p>
<p>“Of course. It is a pleasure to hear these words of advice from you. Then, we shall meet another time, duchess.”</p>
<p>The princess left without a second look.</p>
<p>The victor was Lady Maktus, and that was against an arrogant and prideful princess of the empire!</p>
<p>The young ladies around them covered their faces with fans and whispered to each other. Then, they started rushing towards Adele and tried to build up a favorable impression of themselves. The princess has long been thrown in the back of their minds.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, Lady Maktus. How have you been?”</p>
<p>“I heard you were sick. Forgive me for not being able to visit!”</p>
<p>“Did you buy this brooch from Eligana? Oh my, it suits you perfectly!”</p>
<p>Their fawning words made Adele break in a cold sweat. When she had met with the wives of important persons, she met them individually, not in big numbers like these! When her mother-in-law was still alive, she only had to speak a few words from behind. It was troublesome for her to deal with so many people at once.</p>
<p>As Adele struggled to smile and awkwardly pondered on how to answer, a sturdy arm wrapped around her slender shoulders pivoting her gaze upwards, she saw Noah’s lips curved into a smile. He gave a courteous bow to the girls and said, “May I be impolite as to steal my wife for a dance?”</p>
<p>Then, he gave them a dazzling smile, stunning the poor ladies and causing them to agree absentmindedly.</p>
<p>“Of course! Of course!”</p>
<p>When they came to their senses, Adele was already whisked away by her dashing husband.</p>
<p>“How enviable!” they cried.</p>
<p>Before Adele could say anything, Noah took her and walked into the middle of the banquet hall. Standing under the chandelier, the two of them faced each other. Noah held her hands and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know my wife was a scary person.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Being able to scold the princess like that is no ordinary feat. Will you scold me like that as well?”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!”</p>
<p>A mischievous grin surfaced in his lips, “Pity, I was hoping you would scold me in bed.”</p>
<p>“Be quiet!”</p>
<p>Panicked and embarrassed, Adele tried to shake off his hand, but a thick arm snaked around her waist and pulled her closer until she could feel his warm breath lingering on her skin. When his other hand reached her shoulders, their waltz posture was complete.</p>
<p>Silence fell inside the banquet hall, everyone’s eyes immediately focused on them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Considering his past actions, it wasn’t strange for them to suddenly catch the attention of everyone here.</p>
<p>Noah Maktus, a man who completely ignored all women that approached him and slaughtered all his enemies with a smile on the battlefield, had actually asked a woman to dance with him for the first time in history.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that I’m seeing Noah Maktus being nice.”</p>
<p>“Even a cold-blooded fiend could actually be this warm…”</p>
<p>The nobles who saw this scene murmured incessantly.</p>
<p>Adele, burdened with the attention, hesitated in embarrassment, and he placed his lips against the back of her hand. The area he touched felt warm. Because of this, Adele paused for a moment, then soft music began to play.</p>
<p>Noah lightly grabbed her chin with his fingers and lifted it up. The moment their eyes met, Adele blinked, and he smiled languidly.</p>
<p>“Focus on me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Seeing her blank stare, he chuckled. “Are you mad? That would be better. Only then, would you scold me in bed tonight.”</p>
<p>“Keep quiet!” She hushed him quickly.</p>
<p>Noah moved his feet to the music before the scowling Adele could respond. She was led by him like a reed swaying harmoniously with the wind.</p>
<p>“Do you like waltz?”</p>
<p>She did not like it. It was such an embarrassing act to her. Holding a man’s hand and letting them wrap their arms around her waist, what’s more embarrassing was that she had to keep eye contact with the other person.</p>
<p>Adele felt the burning passion in Noah’s eyes that stared intently at her.</p>
<p>Her whole body began to heat up.</p>
<p>Perhaps he realized what she was trying to say, the tip of Noah’s finger touched her buttocks very slightly. Surprised, Adele moved back and inserted more force to keep her lower body from touching his.</p>
<p>“I don’t like waltz.”</p>
<p>“I can see that. You’re dancing so sloppily.” Noah raised the corners of his mouth and suddenly pulled her even closer into his arms.</p>
<p>Adele felt something hard and bulging inside his robe. She was so embarrassed by the constant friction of Noah’s lower body against her belly, she immediately gave strength to widen the distance between them.</p>
<p>But the more she did, the more he pulled himself forward as they danced.</p>
<p>As they followed the steps in that state, turning around and Adele leaning back through Noah’s lead then bending down again, Adele buried her face in his broad shoulders.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Adele let out a small moan and closed her eyes slightly, smelling his thick masculine scent. Right now, she was incredibly sensitive. His movements became even more magnified to her senses.</p>
<p>His hot breath that caressed her ear, his firm body that engulfed hers, his big warm hand that was slightly rubbing against her back, his arms that securely held her and was unable let go of her waist…</p>
<p>It was like she was completely ensnared by him.</p>
<p>Noah’s hand gradually grew bolder, stroking Adele’s back where his fingers made contact with her bare skin that wasn’t covered by the dress. He touched her slightly damp skin and whispered in her reddened ear.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling hot?”</p>
