            <p><strong>Chapter 110</strong></p>
<p>They calmly talked about their plans and pulled out their knives. One of them was messing around with Adele’s clothes, tugging at them but not strong enough to actually rip it.</p>
<p>“What should we do now, fellas?”</p>
<p>One of them licked his lips.</p>
<p>“Well, he did tell us to possess her body in a way that would disgust any man…”</p>
<p>Adele immediately knew what they were going to do to her. If a woman was violated or had interrelations before marriage, especially with another man, their engagement would be automatically terminated.</p>
<p><em>Daniel, you dastardly scoundrel!</em></p>
<p>She hurriedly pulled her gun out of her bag, but one of them was faster. That man, who would’ve been the first to die had he not been fast enough, lifted his hands in the air with a mocking expression.</p>
<p>“You sneaky b*tch!”</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>Adele’s cheeks turned red and she fell down hard onto the ground. Fortunately, she brought a rescue flute instead of her necklace. She blew on it, hard. The men scoffed at her, thinking that it was already too late and all her attempts were futile, so they grabbed her.</p>
<p>She rebelled with what little strength she had left. One of them grabbed her ankle and forcefully yanked it downwards.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Shut up! If you continue resisting, you’ll just be making things difficult for all of us! Loosen up…”</p>
<p>Adele resolutely shook her head and then she lifted her chin higher to glare at them hatefully.</p>
<p>One man ripped off her dress, exposing her creamy white skin under the moonlight. But then, the ground rumbled, and behind the man appeared a huge monster.</p>
<p>“Look out!”</p>
<p>“What?” Before the man could even look behind him, a sand shark bit on his shoulder. Without even giving him a chance cry out in pain, his heart was pierced and the monster sucked his blood.</p>
<p>Stunned and panicked, the men dumped Adele onto the ground and began to run away. But then, the tentacles from the back of the sand sharks chased after them and penetrated their bodies.</p>
<p>Dead.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Adele glanced back at the scene, stupefied. But everything seemed to slow down when it began approaching her.</p>
<p>When it opened its maws, it bared it gigantic and razor-sharp teeth, preparing to devour this defenseless woman in front of it.</p>
<p><em>Shing!</em></p>
<p>Upon hearing a sound, the sand shark paused and glanced behind her.</p>
<p>“Run away!” There was the silhouette of a small figure at the back of the sand shark, his sword stabbing at its hide.</p>
<p>As the monster howled in fury, the earth shook. Meanwhile, the boy ran towards her and hugged her. But when the sand shark got up, the two fell down.</p>
<p>“You need to get up and run away!” The boy got up quickly and hurriedly grabbed Adele’s arm.</p>
<p>A person died right before her eyes, which caused her to lose strength in her legs and she couldn’t get up. Her whole body ached, and she was shaking. Her ankle was swollen from the pressing on her earlier. She wasn’t even able to run. Adele, having decided that it was too late to escape, she hurriedly told the boy.</p>
<p>“Hurry, run away!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I can’t escape with my legs anyway. You should save yourself. I’ve already used the rescue flute, so find the servants who are looking for me.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense—<em>ah!</em>”</p>
<p>As if not wanting to give it a break, the sand shark wrapped its tentacles around the boy’s leg and threw him away.</p>
<p><em>Ouch!</em></p>
<p>The twelve-year-old fell hard on the floor, but he still stood up even if his body badly hurt.</p>
<p>The sand shark’s scary tentacles stretched out to strike again. Fortunately, the boy escaped quickly, but it managed to brush against his side. Soon, blood began to flow.</p>
<p>“Uh!”</p>
<p>He groaned, his vision swirled and he tumbled to the ground. Meanwhile, the sand shark bit the hem of her skirt as she crawled away and jerked her closer.</p>
<p><em>Ah!</em></p>
<p>When Adele screamed, the monster towed her over its head, landing on a rocky area a few distance away. She immediately felt dizzy during and after the impact.</p>
<p>Seeing her being handled around like a ragdoll, the boy clenched his fist.</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p><em>Why am I so weak, why can’t I protect her?</em></p>
<p>He was extremely frustrated with himself.</p>
<p>At that moment, a black energy emanated from the boy’s body. However, it wasn’t taunting him with whispers like it did before. Instead, it only spoke solemnly in a warning tone.</p>
<p><em>[This time, it won’t be enough… even if I lend you my strength.]</em></p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p><em>[That creature is a strong one. Enough to destroy a city.]</em></p>
<p>The dark energy made the shape of a finger and pointed to the dead coachman, bleeding from his head.</p>
<p><em>[It is usually active during the day. It must’ve been… attracted by that corpse.]</em></p>
<p>The boy saw the monster getting closer and closer to Adele, and he asked frantically. “What should I do to save her?”</p>
<p><em>[Make a contract with me.]</em></p>
<p>The boy tightened his hold on the sword in his hand.</p>
<p><em>[You shall become one with Me… and gain tremendous power. You can save her then.]</em></p>
<p>“Then I would become a person who relishes in the thrill of slaughter.” he gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>The dark energy didn’t answer and there came a moment of silence between them.</p>
<p>He threw stones with all his might. However, it didn’t do anything to deter its movements and they only bounced back when the monster flicked them away with its tentacles.</p>
<p><em>[It’s useless. With your paltry strength, you will not stand a chance.]</em></p>
<p>“Damn it all!”</p>
<p><em>[You will die. She will die too.]</em></p>
<p>While the black energy spoke, the boy crawled, squeezing all of his strength into his limbs. He barely clung onto the sand shark’s hind legs. But the monster kicked him away and he came flying into the air.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>
<p>Crashing into a nearby tree, the boy vomited blood and the black aura clicked its tongue.</p>
<p><em>[What a fool…]</em></p>
