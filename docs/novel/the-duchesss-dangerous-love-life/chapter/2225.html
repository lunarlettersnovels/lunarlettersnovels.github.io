            <p><strong>Chapter 132</strong></p>
<p>“The meal is ready, madam.”</p>
<p>As Adele went down the stairs to the first floor, she heard the report from the butler who was following her.</p>
<p>“What did the doctor say?”</p>
<p>“The doctor confirmed that the lord had definitely lost most of his memories after the age of 17. But not all hope is lost, there’s also a chance that he can slowly recover them with time, or if this was only some form of short-term amnesia.”</p>
<p>She breathed out. “That’s a relief.”</p>
<p>When Adele arrived on the first floor, she saw Noah sitting at a table inside the hall. He looked at her and stood up, then pulled out the chair from across his seat.</p>
<p>At Noah’s gentlemanly, Adele felt little butterflies in her tummy. Perhaps it was because his very formal behavior was akin to that of an inexperienced young man who interacted with a woman for the first time.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Moving her hips slightly, she sat down and he pushed the chair forward.</p>
<p>When the food was brought in, Noah saw the pitiful amount that was laid out in front of her. He frowned and couldn’t help himself from speaking out.</p>
<p>“Eating so little?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh!” She made a sound of agreement, “I eat a little because my stomach cannot handle so much. But—”</p>
<p>“Tsk.” he clicked his tongue in disapproval, “The servants need scolding. The food was subpar, and you’re too skinny.”</p>
<p>Adele raised her head as her eyes widened at her words she had never heard before. For a moment, her eyes met with Noah’s. Suddenly, he bent his body forward, shook his head, and let out a pained moan.</p>
<p>“Urgh…”</p>
<p>Noah felt an unpleasant feeling, as if someone was poking through his head. In an instant, a scene similar to this appeared.</p>
<p><em>What memory is this?</em></p>
<p><em>Hm… was this about a year ago? Wait—no.</em></p>
<p>It was about his older brother going to Tellen, and Noah wanted to express his interest in Adele. But he couldn’t reveal his feelings because at that time, she was his brother’s wife. So he put up with it for the meantime.</p>
<p><em>Wait—what? My brother’s wife?</em></p>
<p>“You…” he clutched his aching head, “Didn’t you say that you’re my wife?”</p>
<p>Noah hurriedly raised her left hand, inspected the ring on her fourth finger and compared it with what he remembered earlier.</p>
<p>It was the exact same ring she was wearing.</p>
<p>Seeing that Noah was confused, Adele urged him to take a seat first. “Sit down first.”</p>
<p>As he quietly obliged, the maids brought more food one after the other. When Adele beckoned him to eat, he had no choice but to obediently put the food in his mouth. She looked at him happily but then remembered.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know how else to say it, but… you are my second marriage.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I married Enon first.”</p>
<p>As his back stiffened from shock, he unconsciously exerted more force into his fork and made a screeching sound against the ceramic plate.</p>
<p>“But it was only an arranged marriage, I did not truly love him back then.” she hurriedly added.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“And I didn’t remember you. Because of this strange power you had and we—”</p>
<p>“I know that part.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Noah put down his fork with a displeased expression, he then guzzled down a glass of water as if swallowing his unexplainable anger. Perhaps, it was jealousy.</p>
<p>Adele was expecting a hearty meal, so she became uncomfortable when he reacted like that. However, seeing him avoiding her gaze and staring blankly at a spot on the table, she just wanted to give him assurance.</p>
<p>“Noah.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Noah, listen to me. I am now your wife.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“All those things were already in the past. You’re the one I’m with right now, that’s what matters now.” then she enclosed his tightly fisted hand into her palms. “And I like you, I genuinely do.”</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>Adele said those things even if she was embarrassed to death. But to her amazement, his ears and cheeks flushed slightly, and finally, as red as a fully-ripened tomato.</p>
<p><em>Oh my gosh! How adorable!</em></p>
<p>Adele rested her chin in her hand and looked at him silently.</p>
<p>Noah couldn’t control the emotions he felt at the moment. But it was more the fact that he felt helpless at his situation of forgetting the time that had definitely shared with her, than of his anger and jealousy of her belonging to someone else.</p>
<p>He loved every word she said, but right now, he just didn’t know what to do. Completely different from the person who made fun of her skillfully just a few days ago.</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me like that.”</p>
<p>“Why? How do I look at you?”</p>
<p>“…like a child.”</p>
<p>Noah turned his head away and avoided her gaze once more. But his eyes were still drawn to her and would steal a glance from time to time. This was because, in his eyes, it was a waste if he didn’t take the chance to immerse himself in this view of her.</p>
<p>Especially with her beauty of such high calibre.</p>
<p>“Nothing’s really changed.” he said, out of the blue.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>“…me?”</p>
<p>Noah stared directly into her eyes with an enigmatic expression, “You still make people go crazy over you.”</p>
<p><em>Oh my—</em></p>
<p>Adele felt something a little different as Noah said what Adele would have said. Therefore, as she was about to reply, Adele suddenly remembered the Countess Arsene’s words.</p>
<p>How to deal with a husband who was younger than her…</p>
<p><em>He only remembers meeting me when he was twelve, so he probably doesn’t know what our relationship was like before, right?</em></p>
<p>Adele pondered to herself as her line of sight collided with his.</p>
<p>Then she smirked.</p>
<p>“…” Seeing her bright and colorful smile, Noah shook his head.</p>
<p>His years and years of experience on the battlefield, even if he had already forgotten most of them, honed his survival instincts to the extreme. And right now, something was telling him that he was in danger.</p>
<p>He heard Adele ask him in a cheery voice.</p>
<p>“You don’t have your memories of 10 years, so you are very confused, right?”</p>
