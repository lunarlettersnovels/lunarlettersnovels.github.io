            <p><strong>Chapter 129</strong></p>
<p>“Oi, Maktus! You coming?”</p>
<p>Near the barracks, Noah was doing some stretches to relieve his muscle pain after engaging in a tough battle a few hours ago. Some of his companions were calling out to him and he waved his hand in response. Next to them, a couple of… harlots were standing with bashful smiles.</p>
<p>Noah frowned and shook his head. “I’m not interested.”</p>
<p>“What the f—what are you? <em>A monk?</em> C’mon, at least try it just once.”</p>
<p>Noah sighed and jumped up from his seat.</p>
<p>“I said, I’m not interested.”</p>
<p>When the women went a little closer and got a good look at his face, they blushed and giggled coquettishly. The comrade grabbed Noah’s arm when he sensed that the evasive monk was about to leave. “Don’t do that, take a look. They are the prettiest women in the area.”</p>
<p>“What can’t you understand—?”</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Noah shook off the man’s grip on his arm. Coincidentally, his eyes met with one of the women. Brown-haired and a little chubby.</p>
<p>Even her eyes were light brown.</p>
<p>It was an appearance that immediately reminded him of someone.</p>
<p>Noah looked at her and realized that they looked somewhat alike, but was still completely different from his first love.</p>
<p>He turned his head without hesitation.</p>
<p>But his colleague, noticing Noah’s quick glimpse, misunderstood it and said, “Do you like that girl?”</p>
<p>“None of your business.”</p>
<p>“Woah, woah, woah! Relax, don’t be so defensi—”</p>
<p><em>Rooooaarr!</em></p>
<p>A beastly sound rang out as a fellow knight tried to catch him again and Noah hurriedly ran towards the source. All the other knights in the vicinity stood up and armed themselves with their swords.</p>
<p>The troops began trembling as they looked at the approaching enemy with despair in their eyes.</p>
<p>“Co-commander-in-Chief! It seems that a group of knights specialized in dealing with monsters is on their way here!”</p>
<p>Noah gave a cursory glance of his troops without saying a word.</p>
<p>Knights from the nobility, demoted knights, and rejected knights with certain problems.</p>
<p>To sum it up, they were all cannon fodder under the control of the imperial and the Knights Templar. Easily disposed of and replaced.</p>
<p>But to think he was actually assigned as the company commander of such a hopeless and abandoned unit.</p>
<p>Noah clenched his sword.</p>
<p>He looked at the hordes of monsters coming from afar and thought that no one would even mourn him even if he died today.</p>
<p><em>Mother?</em></p>
<p>There was no such thing. She had always been afraid of him, the inheritor of the family’s evil power. Perhaps, she may be a little saddened, but that would probably be the extent of her supposed grief.</p>
<p><em>Father?</em></p>
<p>He’s only going to click his tongue and quickly forget he even had a second son. He would just intensify his now-only-son’s training and let him become the perfect successor.</p>
<p><em>Brother?</em></p>
<p>From a young age, he was envious and jealous of his little brother who was superior to him in everything. The only reason he treated Noah nicely was when Enon was declared as the successor.</p>
<p>The look his older brother gave him back then was so haughty that it was disgusting. It didn’t match the persona of a kind and caring man he portrayed to other people.</p>
<p>Thousands of faces flashed through Noah’s head, even those he barely paid attention to and saw about once or twice. Then he thought of a woman with light-brown hair and clear eyes. He laughed sardonically to himself.</p>
<p><em>She doesn’t even remember me.</em></p>
<p>Right now, she must’ve already been engaged to, or even married, another man.</p>
<p>But still…</p>
<p>“C-commander!” A subordinate urgently called Noah, who remained unnervingly still. Noah then got on his horse and drew his sword.</p>
<p>He bellowed, “Weapons at the ready!”</p>
<p>Unsheathing his sword, he urged his horse to gallop forward, leaving behind a few words in an indifferent manner.</p>
<p>“I’m going ahead to block their advance. Prepare for battle.”</p>
<p><em>Whip!</em></p>
<p>When his horse started running, the knights around yanked their reins as well.</p>
<p>Noah suppressed his uneasiness when he saw his men had followed him. Slashing enemies left and right, he began to unleash the inherent dark power in his body.</p>
<p>His vision blurred.</p>
<p>After that, his mind blanked.</p>
<p>Like a madman, he kept swinging his sword with a crazed expression on his face. Piercing, stabbing, hacking…</p>
<p>Noah momentarily closed his eyes as he felt hot blood splashing against his skin, immersing himself in the feel of the thick liquid as it coated his body like a long-lost lover returning to his embrace.</p>
<p>This… was also a way for him to survive the reality of experiencing hell on earth.</p>
<p><em>Giving in to the desires of his inner demons.</em></p>
