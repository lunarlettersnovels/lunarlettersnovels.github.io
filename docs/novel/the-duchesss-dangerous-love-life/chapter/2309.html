            <p><strong>Chapter 48</strong></p>
<p>“You have always coveted what’s mine.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was strange that Adele was alone with the emperor last time. <em>Why was my wife with him when she was invited to the princess’s tea party? He must have seduced her.</em></p>
<p>“Why would I covet something that is yours? I lack nothing.” The emperor’s thoughts strayed.</p>
<p>Rayence had to strengthen his throne as a crown prince from an early age, and Noah back then was like a thorn to his side.</p>
<p>He recalled those nobles, who only had to look and support him as the crown prince, had already respected Noah and followed him. This was due to the previous emperor who persuaded the nobles to support him with his glib tongue.</p>
<p>Noah didn’t care, in fact, he was displeased about it. That’s why he often didn’t appear on summons or official matters.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was out of character of him to marry simply because the law dictates as such.</p>
<p>Thinking up to this point, the emperor spoke, “I am thinking of abolishing the law that obligates the brother-in-law to marry their recently widowed sister-in-law.</p>
<p>“The emperor sure seems to have a lot of free time dallying with such trifling matters.” Noah expressed in a tone tinted with sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Women are having a hard time because of this troublesome law. It is my duty to ensure the well-being of my citizens.”</p>
<p>Noah’s formerly relaxed eyes narrowed in anger. In an instant, the atmosphere became cold. The emperor answered, touching his chin with his fingertips.</p>
<p>“Hm, how about the state gives compensation to women with deceased husbands? Would sixty thousand be enough?”</p>
<p>Noah clenched his jaw.</p>
<p>“There would be no need for women to unwillingly remarry, and there would be no need for them to be tied with someone they don’t necessarily want.” The emperor smiled, “Wouldn’t that be wonderful?”</p>
<p>The princess’s irksome voice piped in, “I don’t know if Charlie would approve of this.”</p>
<p>The emperor raised his eyebrows. Count Charlie was the head of the family that governed the law. He was also a staunch supporter of the Maktus family that stemmed from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Silence permeated the premises.</p>
<p>Noah glared at the princess and then walked brusquely towards the door. Hearing the emperor’s words made him stop in his tracks, again.</p>
<p>“Let your wife know of my sincere thanks. Her wonderful suggestions made my garden even more beautiful.”</p>
<p>Noah turned his head, killing intent radiating viciously as he glared at the emperor.</p>
<p>Rayence provoked him further, “We have decided to meet again, at that place.”</p>
<p>“I will tell my wife if ever I am reminded of it. However,” he smirked, “she may not be able to visit the castle for quite a while.”</p>
<p>It was a statement that clearly showed whose wife Adele was. Noah left through the entrance gate. After that, just as serenity befell the garden, the princess hurriedly approached the emperor.</p>
<p>“Brother! Will you just leave him be?”</p>
<p>“Janice.”</p>
<p>“Please do something to him!”</p>
<p>“Janice.” The emperor gripped her shoulder with a detached look on his face. “Thanks to you, the honor of the imperial family is deteriorating by the day.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean—”</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t for your recklessness, Duke Maktus wouldn’t have been so rude today.” And of course, there were also other matters.</p>
<p>The princess couldn’t refute.</p>
<p>“Stay low for a while. Reflect on what you did wrong.” Then he called out, “Servants!”</p>
<p>The emperor beckoned to the knights and servants. “Do not let the princess take one step out of the castle.”</p>
<p>“Brother—!”</p>
<p>His glare had her rooted on the spot. “Stay quiet until the day of the dinner party. Am I understood?”</p>
<p>The princess tried to protest, but the emperor shoved her aside and left. As he ruffled his lapels, he felt his hands and feet grow cold at the thought of Adele being embraced by Noah last night.</p>
<p>He couldn’t lose her just like this. With forceful steps, he arrived at the castle’s warehouse, a place where only the emperor could enter.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty! Is there anything I could help you with?”</p>
<p>The servant situated outside asked a question, but the emperor remained still. Then he spoke, “Come with me.”</p>
<p>“Ah? B-but—”</p>
<p>His intimidating posture immediately made the servant cower.</p>
<p>“Y-yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Rayence glanced at the multitude of valuables that filled the warehouse. There were rings made from frozen dragon’s tears, beads containing aurora magic, powerful artifacts, and many more. The emperor touched and wore them with his own hands.</p>
<p>He scrutinized them intently and muttered lowly, “What do you think of this?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty?”</p>
<p>He put it back and asked instead, “Is there any gift suitable for a duchess?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p><em>This must be an apology gift for what the princess has done</em>. The servant smiled awkwardly and pointed to a rather plain and modest diamond bracelet.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this is a good gift to express sincerity without burdening the person.”</p>
<p>At first glance, the emperor immediately disdained it. “Too plain.”</p>
<p><em>Ah?</em></p>
<p>“That won’t look good on her. What about this?”</p>
<p>The emperor, with a bright expression on his face, picked up the dazzling crystal ring and showed it to his servant. Pink diamonds and opals were mixed to give off a blinding light. The servant was flustered at the emperor’s actions.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this is a precious diamond sent by the King of Tellen.”</p>
<p>“Then this diamond it shall be. This will match her well.”</p>
<p><em>Err, Your Majesty, isn’t that a little too much?</em> Naturally, the servant would only say this in his mind.</p>
<p>To describe that piece of valuable stone, it was a national treasure that the King of Tellen gave with tears in his eyes after he signed a military pact with Astria. Now, the emperor wanted to gift it to the duchess? Just like that?</p>
<p>No matter how wrong the princess was, this was still a national treasure with latent magical power!</p>
