            <p><strong>Chapter 84 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Ah!</em> It hurts…”</p>
<p>Noah withdrew his mouth from her neck when he heard her little cry, he gave a soft lick at reddened area where he bit her. His movements descended to her chest where he proceeded to slowly swirl his tongue around her nipples and put them in his mouth, sucking them unreservedly.</p>
<p>Adele’s body jolted.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Mngh—ugh.”</p>
<p>Noah hungrily lapped on her breast while the other one was kneaded using his hand. He pressed below her armpits with his thumb. He stimulated her hidden erogenous zones, and Adele tightened her bottom that he furrowed his brows in pain.</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Adele quickly loosened her grip on his member. Noah inserted his member in and out repeatedly as he closed his eyes and let out a small moan. She felt a strange sense of satisfaction when she saw his face being riddled with pleasure.</p>
<p>As she carefully kissed his forehead, he suddenly opened his eyes. He touched her warm body and pressed his hand against her forehead.</p>
<p>“Hot.”</p>
<p>Adele nodded, “Ha… it’s hot…”</p>
<p>He examined her closely.</p>
<p>“Mn. You feel hot because I’m touching you, hm? But right now, that’s not what I meant.” Noah immediately grabbed her thighs and wrapped them around his hips, then he stood up.</p>
<p><em>Ah!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly out of the water, Adele felt the cold and hugged him tighter. He kissed her lips and spoke softly. “Let’s get back inside. I can’t let you get sick again.”</p>
<p>She felt a little disappointed that it ended just like this because of her constitution. As they walked past the bathtub, Adele unknowingly tightened her insides.</p>
<p>Noah halted in his steps and peered intently at her. A passionate gaze met with another’s, and Adele nodded her head.</p>
<p>She was still afraid that someone might see them, but looking around, there was no one here anyway.</p>
<p>At her silent approval, Noah rested his back against a wooden pole and then jerked his lower body upwards. Soon enough, squelching sounds could be heard.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah! Ah!”</p>
<p>“You like it rough, hm?”</p>
<p>Adele nodded, and Noah’s mind immediately became filled with obscenities.</p>
<p><em>Damn it, I wasn’t planning on going so hard on her today.</em></p>
<p>“Ugh, uh, uh…”</p>
<p>Noah let out a chuckle as he eyed her springy breasts that bobbed up and down together with his thrusts.</p>
<p><em>Such a tempting woman, who can resist?</em></p>
<p>He pushed harder and bit her ear slightly.</p>
<p><em>Certainly not me.</em></p>
<p>It’s harder than you think for a woman to have sex while being held. Her legs were floating in the air, so it could go numb.</p>
<p>“Shall I f*ck you from behind?”</p>
<p>While she was hesitating to allow him to do it from the back, Noah whispered like the devil he was, “I’ll make you feel better by f*cking you even harder.”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>“You want to cum one more, right?”</p>
<p>“So—” he suddenly rammed into her, leaving her breathless and panting for air, “—s-so mean…”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, there’s no one here.”</p>
<p>When Noah gently released his arms off her, Adele lost strength in both of her legs and almost toppled down. She quickly turned around and grabbed the wooden pole in front of her to stabilize herself.</p>
<p>Once again, she could feel his tip poking at her drenched entrance. Slowly, his thickly erect penis started to fill up her insides.</p>
<p>He shoved himself within her and started to increase his speed.</p>
<p>Every time his huge girth reached deep inside her core, Adele grabbed the pole and let out a silent scream. This position had stimulated her in more ways than one, and the facts that they were out in public where people could see their vulgar acts aroused her even more.</p>
<p>The pleasure was too exhilarating.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh!”</p>
<p>Adele’s scream rang like an echo.</p>
<p>She was startled by her own voice and covered her mouth with one hand. In front of her was a view of the forest. She felt shameful for having sex in an open space but felt even more thrilled because of it.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Noah raised an eyebrow, he didn’t like her stifling her erotic moans.</p>
<p>Looking at the curvy figure of the woman in front of him, with her ass against his front and her breasts moving in wild abandon, he started f*cking her even harder and faster than before.</p>
<p>Adele clung onto the pole so tightly as his member ruthlessly ravaged her insides. A loud moan inevitably escaped her little pink lips.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh! Ahhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Noah stroked her spine with his hand. “No one else will hear us.”</p>
<p>“Uh, n-no…”</p>
<p>“Don’t hold them in, let me hear your lewd little voice.”</p>
<p><em>Smooch.</em></p>
<p>He kissed her quivering shoulder and it immediately flushed red. Hugging her from behind, Noah stroked her whole body and began to leave traces of him on her naked body.</p>
<p>Her flesh was so soft to the touch that he felt a little obsessed.</p>
<p><em>Thankfully, my impotent brother had never witnessed Adele’s exquisite body</em>.</p>
<p><em>If any other man was to see her body in this state…</em></p>
<p>Noah, who was giving gentle licks and kisses, suddenly bit her forcefully.</p>
<p>He would definitely torture those scoundrels who dare to lay eyes on his woman’s bare body until they begged for death.</p>
<p>Even while having murderous thoughts, his lower body had never ceased its actions.</p>
<p>In contrast, Adele felt like she was going to die. He was pounding into her like a man with vengeance!</p>
<p>“Urgh, ah! Hah, ugh!”</p>
<p>She couldn’t return to her senses due to the overwhelming pleasure. She could only helplessly get held and handled by the man behind her, moreover, she even felt more pleasure from the way she was positioned.</p>
