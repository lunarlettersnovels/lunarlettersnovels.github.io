            <p><strong>Chapter 67</strong></p>
<p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>
<p>The curtains fluttered as a gust of wind entered from an unclosed window, causing the documents to be cluttered on the floor near the bookshelf. James clicked his tongue to pick it up.</p>
<p>When he raised his head, he saw a red book on the bookshelf and was a little baffled.</p>
<p><em>Since when did we have a book as old as this?</em></p>
<p>He removed the ancient-looking book from the shelf to scan it, with the intention to throw it away if he saw it was of useless content.</p>
<p>Neither the title nor the author was stated. But on the cover, a peacock print with a figure of a wolf enclosed within laurel leaves could be seen. Feeling something unusual and a little unsettled by the glaring eyes of the wolf, he opened the book.</p>
<p><strong>「<em>The men of the Maktus family are divided into black and white.</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>If White becomes the head of the state, the family will enjoy a lifetime of peace and harmony.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Black was born with black magic to protect the family. Because of this power, he is doomed to be embroiled in slaughter for the rest of his life. But he will revel in the thrill of bloodshed.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Black has no greed for power, wealth, or fame. Ultimately uninterested in obtaining authority to become the master of the household. Although he does not hunger for these things, his desire must never be provoked.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>If the day comes that he desires for something, White must grant Black’s wish. If the wish is ignored or remains unfulfilled…</strong></em><strong>」</strong></p>
<p><em>What is this book?</em></p>
<p>Reading a passage from the book, the butler frowned. He already had an inkling of what was written in the next page.</p>
<p>He was suddenly reminded of a scene he accidentally witnessed in the study two years prior.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>‘Noah, what exactly is the reason that you oppose this marriage? Are you really not giving your support to your brother’s marriage? Don’t you feel bad for Enon? He has never stared at a skirt, let alone a woman in his entire life!’</em></p>
<p>Madam Maktus’ face was pale as she looked up at Noah, her hand tightly clutching onto her chest.</p>
<p>Unmindful of his mother’s plight, he smirked.</p>
<p><em>‘I, also, have never stared at a skirt all my life. Ah, though I have already looked into what’s inside—’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Noah!’</em></p>
<p>Despite Madame Maktus’ loud cry, Noah leaned against the window solemnly.</p>
<p>Under the open window, he saw Adele strolling through the garden with his brother. He saw Enon blushing red as a helpless expression was pasted on his face while he gazed at his future wife.</p>
<p>Adele treated him politely, but a troubled look would grace her features from time to time. Although it was like this, in a way, the two of them appeared like well-matched pair. Noah gritted his teeth at their relationship.</p>
<p><em>‘Adellia is a good woman. She has a good personality and has learned business under Baron Liliand, she will do a good job of helping us out. Her identity doesn’t matter—’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Mother.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Speak out your thoughts.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘I want to get married.’</em></p>
<p>Madam Maktus’ face lit up at Noah’s unexpected words.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah. so that’s how it is! You’re getting impatient as you wait for your brother to get married. Sure, sure!</em></p>
<p>She exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p><em>‘Which family’s daughter is it, hm? Just speak. There’s no woman you can’t have!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Is that true?’</em></p>
<p>At his somewhat heavy and ominous remark, Madame Maktus heart skipped a beat. Soon, she nodded her head.</p>
<p>Noah pointed his finger over the window. Madame Maktus walked closer and followed to look at where her son was pointing.</p>
<p>At the tip of his finger, was her soon-to-be daughter-in-law, talking to Enon.</p>
<p><em>‘What do you mean by this?’</em></p>
<p>Noah whispered in his mother’s ear.</p>
<p><em>‘Mother, I want that woman.’</em></p>
<p>Madame Maktus’ complexion deteriorated into a deathly pallor, the hand she used to grip her clothes tightened even further until it turned several shades whiter.</p>
<p><em>‘Noah… Miss Liliand is your brother’s.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘No, she has been mine from the start.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘What?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘She is to be mine, mother.’</em></p>
<p>Her son’s golden eyes contained intense pain as he gazed at the couple below. From a young age, Noah was never the one to cry even if he was cut by a sword or severely injured. Madame Maktus shook her head in denial at his shocking request and began to weep.</p>
<p><em>‘No! Noah, no! You have a noble appearance, a noble status, you are even the commander of the knights! You can have any woman you want, but not your brother’s!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Didn’t you say that she was a good woman?’</em></p>
<p>In panic, she wasn’t able to process his words. <em>‘What?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘So, your plan was to find an easy woman who can accept Enon’s disability?’</em></p>
<p>Madame Maktus sat down, confounded by his sharp words.</p>
<p>Noah glanced down at his own mother with an arctic gaze and took a step away from her. In his periphery, he saw the butler standing at the entrance of the study, but Noah simply walked past him without accepting his greetings.</p>
<p>James slowly straightened his back. He couldn’t help but stare at Noah’s back as he walked down the hallway. He himself had the same thoughts.</p>
<p>Noah could have any woman he wanted, so why? Why did it have to be his brother’s wife?</p>
