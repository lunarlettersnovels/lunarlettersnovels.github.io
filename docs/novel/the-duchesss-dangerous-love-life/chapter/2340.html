            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 17 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p><em>Slurp</em>.</p>
<p>There was a sound of sucking and slurping. At the same time, the tip of her chest felt hot and tickled as she laid asleep. A tingling sensation spread from below. She had felt this feeling before somewhere.</p>
<p><em>Ah, yes. It was last night</em>. No, she shouldn’t move anymore. She can’t allow herself to feel good.</p>
<p>As Adele bit her lip to hold back the pleasure, a long finger ran across her lips. “Don’t bite your lips.”</p>
<p>“Hng…”</p>
<p>A warm hand touched her whole body. Her nether region was already aching. At the same time, she wanted to feel something more when his fingers fondled with her insides.</p>
<p>She pressed herself harder into his hands.</p>
<p>“My finger will break off if you keep on.” He said, feeling the increased pressure on his fingers.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“Don’t overdo it.”</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em> A stinging sensation filled her bottom, Adele turned her body over as she disliked this feeling. Not wanting to let her continue, his thick arms turned her body right back over to the opposite direction. The blankets slipped down, and she shivered.</p>
<p>“It’s cold.”</p>
<p>Hearing those words, a large warm hand caressed Adele’s whole body. After touching her for a while, her whole body heated up. Adele let out a small m0an and lifted her back. A low laughter spread through the quiet room.</p>
<p>“Why are you so cute?”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>“I made the right choice in rushing back here.”</p>
<p>His long fingers pressed against her swollen bud, rubbing it against her moist entrance. Adele curled her toes as she felt the tickling sensation.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p><em>Lick, lick, slurp.</em></p>
<p>Again, a warm tongue licked her n!pples. As he rubbed her erect little peaks with his fingers and pressed them together, her inner walls that had his finger in them contracted. A tingling pleasure spread through Adele’s body as his thumbs pressed her bud with his two fingers playing inside her.</p>
<p>“You’re already soaking wet.”</p>
<p>“Hng…”</p>
<p>“Your body feels so good. How did it remain hidden all this time?” A chuckle emitted from his throat as the sound of a finger poking continued.</p>
<p><em>Slop, slop!</em> When her wetness poured out lots of love juice, the pleasure gradually became clearer. Adele, who had been wriggling around, opened her eyes.</p>
<p>“W-what–<em>ah!</em>”</p>
<p>She raised her body slightly and grasped the situation but was unable to speak as his lips clashed into hers. She pounded on Noah’s broad shoulder with her fist, but he didn’t even budge. Instead, he grabbed Adele’s back with his big hand and kissed her.</p>
<p>“Mmnf.”</p>
<p>Noah’s tongue relentlessly rubbed against her tongue. The kiss was intense and thrilling, he played with her tongue that remained motionless. Consequently, his thick fingers played inside her and pressed a certain spot hard. Her body shook.</p>
<p>“Ah… hng, ha…”</p>
<p>“Cry for me.”</p>
<p>“S-stop, uh.”</p>
<p>At the sound of Adele’s m0an, Noah grinned and kissed her trembling eyes. “I’ve always wanted to make you cry.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about—ah! The time… still too early.”</p>
<p>“It’s early evening. Time doesn’t matter for newly wedded couples.”</p>
<p>Adele bit her lips at Noah’s words. She tried to pull out his finger, but her whole body shook as Noah pressed her sensitive nub with his thumb. Not wanting to miss the chance, he quickly pounced with his fingers.</p>
<p>“Ha, hng!”</p>
<p>Music to his ears, “Louder.”</p>
<p>“N-no, uh.”</p>
<p>“No?” He chuckled, “You should’ve realized it by now, your voice is quite good at doing it.”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks, but Noah smiled as he opened his eyes. Adele found herself agape, admiring his beautiful golden orbs.</p>
<p>But it didn’t last long.</p>
<p><em>Slip!</em> As he poked around her core, Adele shuddered at the pleasure. Noah clasped her hand.</p>
<p>“It feels strange, ah!”</p>
<p>“Shh, just give in to the pleasure.”</p>
<p>She kept gasping for air, er0t!c m0ans coming out of her mouth every now and then.</p>
<p>“Why are you even holding it in? There’s no use—” Because he was going to hammer her senseless.</p>
<p>At the sound of Noah’s low laugh, Adele gave in to the pleasure. The pleasure flashed past her, from underneath to the tip of her head. Her fluttering feet slowly descended to the bed.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>“Good girl.” Noah’s moist lips kissed Adele’s eyes. After that, she was able to move and took up a sitting position.</p>
<p>“What do you think you’re doing to a sleeping person?!”</p>
<p>“I told you to come, and you didn’t. So, I came to you myself.”</p>
<p><em>‘What?’</em></p>
<p>“Weren’t you planning on seducing me? You’re wearing this kind of clothing.” Noah said as he fiddled with her lingerie.</p>
<p>“I usually wear this to sleep,”</p>
<p>Adele fixed her nightwear. Noah didn’t mind that, he let his big hand into her clothes and stroked her bre@st. Adele grabbed his arm and tried to push him away, but to no avail, it was like a child pushing a tree.</p>
<p>She added, “and this is my room.”</p>
<p>“I am your husband.”</p>
<p>“He did not come into my room without permission.”</p>
<p>Noah furrowed his eyebrows at Adele’s reply. Aware of his expression, she turned her head and avoided his gaze. Noah rubbed his wet fingers against Adele’s pale thighs.</p>
<p>“We got married and had our first night.”</p>
<p><em>Uh…</em></p>
<p>“I am your husband now.”</p>
<p>Adele knew of the exhilarating pleasures that Noah’s body gave her. She pushed him away as she yelped, unfamiliar and afraid of herself.</p>
<p>“I said, I am now your husband.”</p>
<p>“T-to me, my husband is Enon.” Adele felt the guilt gnawing at her that she tried so hard to ignore, she pushed him away.</p>
<p>A scowl appeared on Noah’s face. “Oh, really? Even when he didn’t give you the pleasure you deserve?”</p>
<p>She pretended to not hear him.</p>
<p>“Can you even call him, someone can’t even have s*x with you, your husband?”</p>
<p>Adele was startled and let her voice out. “Don’t go too far, he’s still your brother!”</p>
<p>“Well, he’s already dead.”</p>
<p>Adele turned her head at Noah’s cold attitude. He frowned and pulled her chin close to him. She met his golden eyes. Right, these eyes. The eyes that she had always feared. Noah spoke in a low, but enraged voice. “Now, your husband is me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“If you can’t forget him, then I’ll make you.”</p>
<p>Noah pushed his hand between her legs. His fingers rubbed her wet center and Adele, startled by the sudden action, slapped him on the arm. He didn’t even flinch. Noah raised the corners of his mouth at her attitude. “I guess my brother has never entered his fingers inside you either.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Your reaction is too innocent. But,” Noah’s fingers pressed against her cl!toris. Adele’s body was heating up with pleasure and let out a gasp. “Your body is so lu$tful.”</p>
