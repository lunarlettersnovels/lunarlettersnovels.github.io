            <p><strong>Chapter 80</strong></p>
<p>Adele nodded as she drank some water. She winced slightly when she felt pain on her ankle lifted the blanket to take a look, it was a little swollen. Noah grabbed her dainty foot and put a wet towel on it.</p>
<p>She shuddered at the sudden ice-cold temperature on her skin.</p>
<p>“The swelling has reduced significantly.” Noah gently wrapped her ankle with the towel. After finishing, he looked quite pleased with his own handiwork.</p>
<p>Adele felt awkward, so she grabbed the blanket and covered herself up to the chin.</p>
<p>Noah just smiled and touched her little white feet.</p>
<p>“So small…”</p>
<p>A sly grin emerged from his face, “Considering its size, it’s a wonder how you don’t fall over when walking.”</p>
<p>This was the first time someone had touched her feet like this. It was only today that Adele realized that this situation was far more embarrassing than being naked.</p>
<p>She hastily said something else. “W-when will we be returning to the castle?”</p>
<p>Noah was amused by her little reactions.</p>
<p>“The knights are still in the middle of clearing up the road blockage. They said that it would take at least a day.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Adele pouted and shook her head. Facing the window, she saw a pigeon eating in a feeder.</p>
<p>Noah languidly sat back on the chair, his arms crossed and his right leg on top of the other. “You don’t have to look so glum about it. Am I really that unpleasant to be with?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>He changed his stance and turned his head away, “Be patient, for about a day.”</p>
<p>Noah looked at the table with a bitter look. On top of it were fruits, freshly picked and still had those dewy droplets to them. Over the fireplace was a boiling pot.</p>
<p>Adele looked at the pot, then back at him, her eyes flashing with curiosity.</p>
<p>Noticing her subtle movements, he asked, “Are you hungry?”</p>
<p>“Ah?” She shook her head, “No, but I would like to take a bath.”</p>
<p>Remembering she was in a humble hut with limited facilities, she waved her hands to take back her words. There was no place for her to take a bath anyway.</p>
<p>“Never mind. I can do it when we get back.”</p>
<p>Adele touched her dampened body. She had sweated so much last night and there’s this sticky feeling that lingered on her skin. No matter how much she used a towel to clean herself, it was still different from a real bath. Hence, she felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At this time, Noah decided to speak. “You can take a bath.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Sorry what?”</p>
<p>He stood up from the chair and strode towards the bed. He then sat down and spread his arms. “You won’t be able to walk. I’ll carry you.”</p>
<p>Adele hesitated. She looked down at the blankets that had her naked body underneath. But then, she nodded and allowed herself to be gently embraced by him. She knew that it would be too hard to walk given the condition of her ankle.</p>
<p>She smiled bitterly as she remembered being in his arms last year. Even then, just by looking at those broad shoulders and side profile, she felt like her face was on fire.</p>
<p>Noah slowly opened the door of the hut without showing any signs of difficulty.</p>
<p><em>Swiiishh.</em></p>
<p>The smell of wet soil and clear pine needles entered her senses, with the sound of rain pitter-pattering in the background.</p>
<p>When they turned around a corner, there was a space kept out of the rain with a wide wooden roof and secured with thick pillars. A large wooden bathtub that could fit two people was currently inside of it, emitting steam that Adele could see from a distance.</p>
<p>“Can you stand for a while?”</p>
<p>She moved her foot for a bit, “I think so.”</p>
<p>“Lean on the wall.”</p>
<p>Noah carefully set her down on within the confines of the makeshift cover. As Adele reached out and leaned against a wooden pole, he pulled the string from the roof.</p>
<p><em>Sshh!</em></p>
<p>Warm water flowed out from a long bamboo barrel attached to the ceiling. Gently covering her body with her arms and hands, she quickly went near to the water source and started scrubbing.</p>
<p>Noah himself, began to undress. When his clear-cut muscles were exposed, Adele swiftly averted her eyes and washed her face.</p>
<p>Even though they were already couple and there was nothing they needed to hide from each other; still, it was embarrassing for her. She glanced at him and quickly turned her head.</p>
<p>As if guessing her thoughts, Noah chuckled. “I need to wash myself too.”</p>
<p>“I… didn’t say anything.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your understanding.”</p>
<p>She hummed in response, “Wash yourself as much as you want.”</p>
<p>Noah grinned at Adele’s silly words. On the other hand, she concentrated on her bath, thinking that if this atmosphere is to be continued, she might do something embarrassing. As the water got colder, Adele shivered.</p>
<p>Having finished bathing, Noah approached her and stretched out his arms to carry her.</p>
<p>“I can walk…”</p>
<p>Despite Adele’s insistence, he carried her without delay and placed her inside the bathtub.</p>
