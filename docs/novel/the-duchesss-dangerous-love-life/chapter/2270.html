            <p><strong>Chapter 87</strong></p>
<p>The soft potato gradually melted into her mouth, it was seasoned perfectly, and its texture was also very excellent. Adele looked at Noah with wide eyes, “It’s delicious! How did you learn how to cook like this?”</p>
<p>In return, he gently wiped the stew off her lips. “Do not underestimate your husband. Here, have some more.”</p>
<p>Adele happily ate his offered food, “I just can’t believe you were the one who made this.”</p>
<p>“I, too, have been an apprentice knight once.”</p>
<p>Ah… she seems to have known the reason to why he could cook so well. He’s a person who went up slowly from being an apprentice to becoming the Knights’ Commander.</p>
<p>“Is it still hot?” he asked, afraid that her mouth would get burned so he continued to blow on the stew before he fed some to her.</p>
<p>Adele shook her head as she ate. “Can you make anything else?”</p>
<p>“No, this is the only one I know how.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Why?”</p>
<p><em>Because this is the kind of food that knights would eat if they were hungry, and…</em> He wasn’t in the mood to talk to Adele about this story.</p>
<p>Noah looked at the empty bowl and patted her head, indicating that she had done well. Adele grinned at the savory smell on his hands.</p>
<p>Noah started talking to the pot again, “You should have another bowl.”</p>
<p>“But I already feel full.” She couldn’t eat much after starving for a day. Although normally, she would eat a lot.</p>
<p>“You need to gain more weight.”</p>
<p>After filling the bowl again, Noah lifted the blankets that was covering Adele. She quickly hid back inside, but Noah just flipped the blankets again. She pouted and said, “I’m already heavier than most wome—<em>mmph</em>.”</p>
<p>Noah stopped her from talking by feeding her a spoonful of stew</p>
<p>“To raise your stamina, you need to endure for more than just a few rounds.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by ‘just—<em>nngh</em>—a few rounds’?!</p>
<p>“You’re still a long way off before you can catch up with me, duchess.” Although catching up to his stamina meant she would have to undergo rigorous and hellish training for years, which really isn’t his intention. He just wanted her to persist for a little while longer so he could play with her to his heart’s content.</p>
<p>Adele glared at him in warning, but her cheeks were stuffed like a chipmunk’s that she looked too cute to even appear the slightest bit threatening. Instead, it further provoked Noah.</p>
<p>Oblivious to Noah’s eyes that were burning with passion, Adele scanned the interior of the house.</p>
<p><em>A modest family home.</em></p>
<p><em>If only we were simple commoners, would it be possible for just the two of us to live together in this house without worrying about our reputation?</em></p>
<p>Because of her husband’s death and her marriage to his younger brother, Adele’s guilty conscience distanced her from the servants of the castle. She had never looked down on them, but she never thought she would have a tinge of envy to their lives that had lesser restrictions…</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about.”</p>
<p>“Ah… I am—”</p>
<p><em>Thump!</em></p>
<p>A noise was heard from the distance. Adele held her chest in surprise as Noah calmly stood up. He was quick to assuage her worries, “They must be clearing up the road.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>
<p>“The rain has stopped too. I need to go down and check on the situation.”</p>
<p>Noah put the bowl down and walked towards the door. Adele glanced at his back and turned her body in his direction, feeling somewhat sad. He turned around and observed the still-unclothed woman on the bed.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>She nodded, “Alright.”</p>
<p>“Don’t open the door to anyone.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a little child.”</p>
<p>“If you’re in danger, use that to ask for help.”</p>
<p>Noah pointed to an item on the table. At the end of his finger was a mountain flute, it was used in remote mountainous regions to ask for help as it had a very loud sound that people further away could still hear it.</p>
<p>Adele nodded.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Noah still glanced at her worriedly as he absentmindedly opened the door.</p>
<p>Seeing his broad back that radiated safety and warmth, Adele spoke unexpectedly. “Be safe, ho-…”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Honey…” her voice trailed off so softly it was barely even heard. But Noah’s eyebrows shot up in incredulity, the leg that was almost one step out the door abruptly froze in its tracks.</p>
<p>Adele covered her face with the blanket, feeling utterly embarrassed of herself for calling him like that. Noah walked towards her and removed the blanket from her face.</p>
<p>Her skin was as red as a fully ripened tomato.</p>
<p>She was startled by his sudden actions, “What are you… err—you should go.”</p>
<p>Noah’s face was as brooding and serious as ever.</p>
<p>“Do you need anything?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“I’ll buy them for you on the way back.” At this time, even if she asked for something impossible, Noah would surely go to hell and back to get them for her.</p>
<p>Yes, he was <em>that </em>happy right now.</p>
<p>Adele thought to herself, where could he even buy anything on this isolated mountain? He was too cute, trying to match with Adele.</p>
<p>That… doesn’t sound bad. Adele shook her head as she laughed lightly. “I don’t need anything.”</p>
<p>Noah frowned, “Still, there might be—”</p>
<p>“Except for you.”</p>
<p>“….” Noah inhaled sharply as he ran his fingers through his hair, his unfeeling heart was already doing somersaults in his chest. “Damn it, woman.”</p>
<p>She was driving him to the point of madness, and he couldn’t even cuddle with her right now!</p>
