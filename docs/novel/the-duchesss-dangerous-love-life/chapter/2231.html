            <p><strong>Chapter 126</strong></p>
<p><em>Kyah!</em></p>
<p>Laughter abounded as they continued chatting. But when Adele heard the contents of their conversation, her eyes widened.</p>
<p>Does everyone get permission easily? But she…</p>
<p>Adele recalled a conversation she had with Noah just a few hours ago.</p>
<p><em>‘Night teatime?’</em></p>
<p>Noah asked her with a dubious expression.</p>
<p><em>‘Yes. Do you know Lady Selena?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Erm—the one who decided to marry the Marquis of Kesenon.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Oh.’ </em>He then nodded.</p>
<p>Adele took a deep breath as she adjusted his outfit because it was a little disheveled since he had worn it for quite some time now. Meanwhile, Noah bowed his head and smiled delightedly as he watched her little movements.</p>
<p><em>‘What’s the problem with her?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Well, they are hosting a night teatime before the wedding. We’re not very close, but Countess Arsene invited me to attend.’</em></p>
<p>The countess was a woman involved in the education of young girls and grooming them to be the perfect mistress that knew how to manage a household and have a few other skills in their arsenal. The young girls, whom she had educated, would soon be reborn as dignified ladies and shall be matched with a mate that complements them well.</p>
<p>Many parents wanted her to be their daughter’s teacher, but only a select few are fortunate enough to be chosen by the virtue of their character.</p>
<p>One of the countess’s pupils will be getting married, so it was only natural that Adele was to be invited as per her relationship with the older lady.</p>
<p>But Noah just grunted.</p>
<p><em>‘Hmm.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘I won’t be out for too long.’</em></p>
<p>Noah pursed his lips into a thin line, he really didn’t like it when she would leave the safety of their home. Looking outside the window and seeing the darkening skies, his frown deepened.</p>
<p><em>‘Isn’t it a little too late?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘But I’ll leave as we’re done.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘I just don’t like you seeing another man.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘A man? But I’m going to a ladies’ meeting.’</em></p>
<p>Noah arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p><em>‘Is a coachman coming to pick you up and a guard, not a man?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Wha—Noah! Are you for real?’</em></p>
<p>He grinned and kissed her luscious hair. Adele struck Noah’s chest with her fist.</p>
<p><em>‘Don’t be silly.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘And don’t ignore my sincere worries, dear wife. I only wish for your safety.’</em></p>
<p>Noah grabbed her hand and placed his lips at the back of her hand, kissing them several times. Adele was embarrassed by his warm touch and responded by gently turning her head.</p>
<p><em>‘…anyways, you will let me attend, right?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘No.’</em></p>
<p>His tone was firm and final instead of being playful.</p>
<p>Adele blinked. Suddenly, her bottom lip protruded into a pout without her realizing it.</p>
<p><em>‘That’s unfair. How come you can attend night banquets and I can’t even partake in a ladies’ gathering?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘But you don’t give me presents.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘A… present?’</em></p>
<p>Ruminating over his words, she realized he truly always gave her little gifts when he left for late night meetings.</p>
<p>Initially, he offered her gems or minerals, but she refused because it was too ostentatious. However, Noah did not give up and gave her the things she liked: bouquets of flowers, ornaments, or forbidden or extremely limited-edition books.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, Adele always anticipated a present from him whenever he attended his official nightly duties. But of course, the following night, her body would ache so much because he ‘missed her so much’.</p>
<p>Noah smiled and tapped his lips with his finger.</p>
<p><em>‘Bribe me then.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…can it be a tie clip?’</em></p>
<p>He tilted his head to the side, amused.</p>
<p><em>‘You know what I want.’</em></p>
<p>Noah grinned and patted her waist with a warm hand. Adele hesitated for a moment at his scalding touch, then decidedly lifted her feet and kissed his lips. When she looked up at him in question of whether it was okay now, he smiled softly and swiftly recaptured her lips.</p>
<p>An intense kiss took place, stimulating each other’s senses as their tongues intertwined. Adele’s breath kept getting shorter. Taking the break, Noah quickly untied her corset straps behind her back. As if she wouldn’t allow it, Adele slapped his treacherous hand.</p>
<p><em>‘Really?’</em></p>
<p>Noah blinked his eyes, trying to gain sympathy from his wife.</p>
<p><em>‘Isn’t your husband pitiful? He has to work alone tonight until 1 in the morning.’</em></p>
<p>Flustered, Adele sighed and looked at the clock on the table—there were still three hours left until the event. If she dealt with him quickly and then left, she would still roughly arrive on time.</p>
<p>Plus, she didn’t actually hate doing it with him either. So…</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be such a loss if she dealt with her clingy husband first.</p>
<p>But her plan was completely shattered. In the end, Noah’s tenacity still left her gasping for breath even as she left and had arrived at Lady Selena’s mansion.</p>
<p><em>Late, might I add.</em></p>
<p>Adele blushed as she recalled the fiercely passionate time she had shared with Noah earlier. As the blush creeped up from her neck towards her face, Countess Arsene had a sullen smile on her face.</p>
<p>“For the most part, it seems like it was easy to get permission. Although, there might’ve been others who did not.”</p>
<p>Countess Arsene opened her fan and looked at Adele slyly. Embarrassed by her focused attention, she turned her head away.</p>
<p>Adele innocently blinked her eyes at Lady Selena, who was the only one that did not know what the countess was referring to, and spoke.</p>
<p>“By the way… Young lady, are you older than your fiancée, the Marquis?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.” Lady Selena nodded, “At the academy, I was his senior.”</p>
<p>“It’s a coincidence then. I’m a bit older than my husband too.” Adele expressed.</p>
<p>Countess Arsene smiled and put down her teacup. Selena bit her lip as if she was envious of her being relaxed.</p>
<p>“Although our marriage is bound by a family covenant, I still like the Marquis very much. But I don’t have a brother, so I’m still a little unfamiliar with men.”</p>
<p>The other ladies were quick to reassure her.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, young lady. What a man becomes, is ultimately up to his woman.”</p>
<p>“Ah…?”</p>
<p>Selena was confused by the statement. When everyone else saw her expression, they hurriedly added.</p>
<p>“It’s like this, when a woman is kind and treats the man well, the man himself shall be kind. Of course, it goes both ways. The smile on a woman’s face is also a reflection of how his man treats her, so don’t let yourself be bullied.”</p>
<p>Countess Arsene lifted an eyebrow and raised her teacup to her lips.</p>
<p>“Men are simple creatures by nature, especially in front of women.” she proclaimed with a knowing smile. “If you want to have an amicable relationship with one another, then act like damsel in distress and allow them to take care of you.”</p>
<p>The other ladies’ eyes widened, concentrating on her words.</p>
