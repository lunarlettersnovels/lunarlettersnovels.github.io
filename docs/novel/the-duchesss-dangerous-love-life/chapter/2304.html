            <p><strong>Chapter 53</strong></p>
<p>Adele’s ears seemed to be burning at the sound of Noah’s low laughter and nudged him lightly.</p>
<p><em>Tsk</em>.</p>
<p>Adele quickly recollected her memories, “Thank you, but how did you know I was here?”</p>
<p>His brow furrowed.</p>
<p>“I was walking around the area when your maid came to ask for help.”</p>
<p>Noah glanced at Lina in warning and the maid hesitated in speaking. This was because Noah was the one who appeared first, as if he had been waiting for Adele back when she entered the alley.</p>
<p>However, after working ten years as a maid, it was the basic of basics to look out for the master’s emotions. Hence, Lina just smiled softly in silent agreement and nodded her head.</p>
<p>Even if it was wrong, it is a maid’s duty to believe it is right!</p>
<p>However, Noah frowned and said to Lina.</p>
<p>“Why weren’t you with the lady earlier?”</p>
<p>Adele quickly waved her hands, “I told her not to follow me earlier. It isn’t her fault.”</p>
<p>His scowl deepened, “What would’ve happened to you if I wasn’t here? You don’t even have a single guard with you.”</p>
<p>When he was busy scolding her, Adele pouted in embarrassment. It was onerous to always be accompanied by a knight, there would be these big burly men tailing her wherever she went. She thought she wouldn’t have any problem walking around the city because it was always crowded and there were military police patrolling on every corner.</p>
<p>Unless you enter the alleyway leading to the slums.</p>
<p>She wanted to slap her own face and reflected on her foolish behavior of following strangers just to listen to their conversation. Watching Adele’s face getting distressed, Noah let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“Never walk by yourself again. Now, let’s leave.”</p>
<p>Noah naturally wrapped his arms around Adele’s shoulders. She was embarrassed, but she didn’t pry his arms away. As she left the alley, the lively and bustling streets devolved into silence.</p>
<p>The women who were walking along the pavements eyed Noah’s face and blushed. Adele felt their scrutinizing gazes and tried to move away from him, but Noah only pulled her closer.</p>
<p>“You can return to the castle first. I still have something I need to buy.”</p>
<p>“What if you find yourself in danger again?”</p>
<p>Adele staggered, “Err… what happened earlier was because I went to there by myself…”</p>
<p>Noah paused and glanced at her pointedly, as if to say, ‘That’s exactly my point.’.</p>
<p>Adele couldn’t rebuke his meaningful stare, she was in the wrong after all.</p>
<p>Noah walked forward, guiding her with his arms and said, “Let’s go together. What do you need to buy?”</p>
<p>At his words, Adele hastily sneaked out of his arms and walked ahead of him. “I’m buying a new dress for the upcoming dinner party. Men have no interests in these, so you may return to the castle first. I’ll look around for—<em>ah!</em>”</p>
<p>Adele stumbled back at the sudden influx of people. She felt perplexed to see a multitude of them running towards the street entrance. Adele was swept away by the moving masses and faltered against the wall. Then Noah circumnavigated within the crowd and wrapped his arms around her securely.</p>
<p>“Like I said, we should go together.”</p>
<p>A circus troupe appeared further behind the clueless Noah and the crowd continued to hurriedly rush into the streets. Everyone wanted to be on the front.</p>
<p>It was chaotic.</p>
<p><em>Tsk.</em></p>
<p>Noah clicked his tongue and propped his hand against the wall behind Adele. He held her in his arms, preventing her from being swooped up by the speeding horde. Noah stretched his neck upwards and using his height advantage to find out why these people had suddenly gathered. Obviously, Adele knew why because she already saw them.</p>
<p>While he was busy with his investigation, Adele quietly scanned his features.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful face, the longer she looked at it, the more she kept admiring it. She recalled her heart fluttering when she first saw him. But was it only once, back then?</p>
<p>No, her heart still flutters whenever she sees his face—whenever Noah looked at her with his soft and gentle eyes.</p>
<p>She immediately became flustered and quickly turned her head to avoid his gaze.</p>
<p>Unaware of her tumultuous thoughts, Noah moved his head so that he could see himself in Adele’s eyes. She was forced to make eye contact with Noah. Ignoring the clamorous background noise, he spoke, “Where did you learn how to shoot a gun?”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>He spoke louder, “Your shooting skills are exceptional. Your aim is good, and your form is satisfactory enough.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Adele smiled as she remembered her childhood. “Outsiders often come to the castle. So, even if I am a woman, my father deemed it fit for me to learn how to use one. He said that a woman ought to be able to protect herself.”</p>
<p>“Did you learn it from father-in-law?”</p>
<p><em>Father-in-law.</em> He gave her father, who was of lower status than him, a dignified title. Adele felt inwardly happy with this, and her heart pounded.</p>
