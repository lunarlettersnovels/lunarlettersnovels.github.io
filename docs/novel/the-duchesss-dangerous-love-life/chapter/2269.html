            <p><strong>Chapter 88</strong></p>
<p>Noah rubbed his face in frustration. She had never even talked to him in the castle. He promised himself that if he had enough time, he would bring her for a vacation or trip with him, even if they were for official matters.</p>
<p>Unable to resist anymore, Noah stole a kiss from her. It was supposed to be brief, but the sweet and soft kiss soon turned rough. They soon paused their actions to catch their breaths.</p>
<p>Noah felt a surge of lust, but he managed to calm it down and ended it with a kiss on Adele’s forehead. “I’ll be back soon, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Come back quickly.”</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>Noah purposedly left without looking back, he was afraid he would lose that little bit of self-control he had and gobble her up.</p>
<p>Adele felt sad, but she understood that he had to go. They had no way of knowing what the other exactly felt, but for now, at least they both shared the same thoughts.</p>
<p>A while later, Noah began his inspection. But he moved around uneasily, fearing that beasts and outsiders might attack Adele while he was away. He was also afraid that she might get injured just by simply walking around the mountain.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the way down from the mountain to the castle, there were knights clearing a path that was blocked by fallen trees and hurling piles of rocks at one the side.</p>
<p>A man could be seen kneeling on the cold hard ground. There were two men standing that gave off an overwhelming aura, one in particular was even more frightening than the other.</p>
<p>It was the territory manager on his knees.</p>
<p>“So… the landslide happened because of a monster?” Noah glared at him viciously, his eyes full of icy rage.</p>
<p>Philip answered in affirmative on behalf of the terrified man on his knees. The manager’s pathetic face was filled with snots and tears that Noah gritted his teeth in disdain.</p>
<p>“A monster was lurking in the vicinity for months, and you thought to remain silent about it?! You even dare to implicate my wife’s life with your incompetence?!”</p>
<p>He was seething, this man’s negligence had almost cost him his precious wife!</p>
<p>“Moreover, it’s the kind of monster that never stays put and goes roaming about in several places. Even if a disaster didn’t occur here, it would occur in other places!” He continued, imagining the lives that will be taken if the monster roams free.</p>
<p>The manager yelled out some excuses and continued pleading for his life. He had failed his one and only duty, and this means death.</p>
<p>Noah had no intention of wasting time with a dead man. He instantly drew his sword and cleanly chopped of his head. Not long after, there was a sound of an object falling to the ground with a muffled thump.</p>
<p>Philip uttered some condolences for the man in his mind, but he didn’t feel pity. He had already seen far too many deaths, and that manager was wrong in the first place.</p>
<p>He made a mental warning to himself.</p>
<p><em>Do not touch the duchess, or you’ll die.</em></p>
<p>He also took it upon himself to notify his fellow knights of this taboo. After all, it wouldn’t be fun to have a comrade’s head chopped off over a silly joke.</p>
<p>On that note, he also found a new goal.</p>
<p><em>Curry up to the commander’s wife and gain favor!</em></p>
<p>“Commander, shall I go and escort the lady?”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll go. Focus on clearing a path and make sure to finish before I come back.”</p>
<p>“Yes, commander.” Gaining favor can wait then. “How long will you be gone for?”</p>
<p>Noah checked if there was blood splattered on his clothes, then he spoke, “Three hours.”</p>
<p>The knights who were shoveling around had their eyes widened in disbelief. Philip was more familiar with Noah’s methods, so he simply replied with a ‘yes’ and got back to work.</p>
<p><em>Can he even make a round trip in such a small amount of time? On a road obstructed by rain and debris?</em></p>
<p>After Noah left, the knights murmured whether he could make it back within three hours and someone had even made a bet. From what they know, that little hut was quite far, and added with road blockages, it might take them four to six hours at minimum to go back and forth.</p>
<p>But exactly three hours later, Noah walked down with the duchess in his arms.</p>
<p>Capability speaks for itself.</p>
<p>The knights vowed, that even if they died, they would never betray nor disobey that person.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>「My daughter, it has already been a while, but it is only now after the harvest festival that I have sent you a letter. Your father feels ashamed to face you, I hope you haven’t forgotten about this old man yet.</p>
<p>How do you fare with your new husband? Does he treat you well? It’s actually quite a pity, I haven’t even seen my new son-in-law’s face, and I live so far away to even visit…」</p>
<p>At noon, when the sun shone at its the brightest, Adele was reading a letter from her father while being dressed by the maids. She thought his health might’ve gotten better now since he could even joke at his expense.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to put the letter down, a familiar voice resounded through her ears.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at?”</p>
<p>Noah leaned against the door, watching her with a tender expression.</p>
<p>Adele smiled and folded the letter back into its envelope.</p>
