            <p><strong>Chapter 114</strong></p>
<p>“I hold onto the hope that this matrimonial ceremony shall relieve the country of its gloomy atmosphere, which has accumulated over the course of two years of frequent wars. The most recent one being Duke Maktus’ insurgency.”</p>
<p>His tone was solemn, and yet the emperor suddenly smiled and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Be that as it may, with the unstable situation sorted out, I now plan on taking an empress for myself.”</p>
<p>The guests were immediately dumbfounded, especially those nobles who had female children. Their eyes widened into saucers, and they subsequently glanced at their own daughters, hoping they would be chosen as the mother of the empire.</p>
<p>The emperor’s lips quirked up into an imperceptible smile and he held a goblet of sparkling champagne. “For the noble wedding of the imperial family!”</p>
<p>The quick-witted guests raised their wine glasses and the emperor let out a satisfied expression as raised his arm.</p>
<p>“Cheers!”</p>
<p>The gigantic bells began to ring, and guests clinked their glasses towards each other, signaling the start of this year’s royal wedding.</p>
<p>Then, the priest loudly proclaimed, “Let us welcome the groom!”</p>
<p>A guard pulled open the huge mahogany doors, revealing the back of a tall figure. Noah wore a black, stately tailcoat that brought forth his dignified aura. His hair was slicked back so neatly that not a single one was out of place. But there was a dark undertone of red beneath his eyes as he let out a deep, reluctant, and painful sigh.</p>
<p>Oblivious to his erratic thoughts, the women blushed and remained fixated at his noble and majestic bearing.</p>
<p>The processional ensued. Little flower girls scattered rose petals onto the ground, followed by the ring bearer, and other important characters of the imperial family.</p>
<p>Once they have all finished, everyone stood in a uniformed fashion as the loud fanfare heralded the arrival of the, allegedly, most beautiful woman of this moment.</p>
<p>“Let the bride enter!”</p>
<p>The princess appeared, donning her pristine white wedding dress that represented one’s purity and nobility.</p>
<p>It was definitely grand. However, there were too many jewels embedded and other flashy designs that the dress looked too… <em>gaudy.</em></p>
<p>Behind her walked three unwilling bridesmaids in similarly white apparel, whose faces were covered with unadorned white cloths and veils. They were holding bunches of white anemones to give to the guests, which was unusual, but that was how it is according to the Astrian tradition.</p>
<p>Finally, the princess reached Noah’s side.</p>
<p>The priest announced, “Now that both the bride and groom have entered, we shall continue with the vows of–”</p>
<p>“Wait.” the emperor interrupted and all eyes immediately went to him, “Let me do the honor.”</p>
<p>He stood up and strode towards the altar, the priest bowed down and respectfully stood to the side, allowing the emperor to replace his position.</p>
<p>Glancing down at the ‘groom’, he spoke, “Do you, Noah Maktus, the groom, vow to take this bride as yours and cherish her?”</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p>After a few more moments, a low voice was heard.</p>
<p>“Yes.” he uttered with utmost insincerity.</p>
<p>The emperor smiled, “Do you, Noah Maktus, the groom, vow to stay by your bride’s side in sickness or in health, and shall protect her for as long as you live?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Do you, Noah Maktus, the groom, vow to love Janice Quincet and shower her with your unconditional affection?”</p>
<p>A mocking smile appeared on Noah’s lips.</p>
<p>Instantly, he snatched a sword from an unsuspecting knight. The knight was alarmed and consequently rushed towards the assaulter to retrieve his weapon.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Alas! His attempt was unsuccessful when Noah grabbed his neck and mercilessly crushed his bones, his lifeless body collapsing towards the floor.</p>
<p>Sword in hand, Noah dashed towards the emperor, the latter’s imperial guards immediately took action to intercept his attack.</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em></p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The bridesmaids near the princess pulled her out of the sword’s trajectory, narrowly avoiding death.</p>
<p>But unlike her, the knights were killed all at once. The emperor saw Noah aiming his sword towards his neck and he, too, drew his sword. Soon after, their weapons met, and he deflected Noah’s killing strike.</p>
<p>If it was during usual circumstances, Noah would’ve been able to casually break the emperor’s sword. Unfortunately, after he was arrested, he was interrogated and tortured that caused him to be significantly weakened. Owing to this fact, the emperor slashed Noah’s sword in two with relative ease.</p>
<p>“Duke Maktus, you still dare to rebel?”</p>
<p>“Rebel?” Noah laughed self-deprecatingly, “I lost my knights, my castle, and my wife. I have nothing else to lose, so do you really expect me to follow your commands like an idiot?”</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em></p>
<p>The sound of metal echoed within the confines of the vicinity as two heavily clashed their swords against each other.</p>
<p>“Did you really think I’ll marry your poor excuse of a sister?”</p>
