            <p><strong>Chapter 115</strong></p>
<p>“I thought it was strange at first because you readily agreed. But then again,” The emperor smirked, “whether or not your marriage was successful, it won’t really make that big of a difference.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>Swoosh!</em></p>
<p>“You’re a lone man with no power attached to his name. By simply breathing the same air that I do, you are already committing an unforgivable sin.” The emperor continued amidst the onslaught of attacks.</p>
<p><em>Clank!</em></p>
<p>The emperor’s sword swerved towards his enemy’s neck, but with Noah’s fast reflexes, he was able to effectively parry the assault. The emperor tightened his grasp on the hilt and frowned.</p>
<p>“Do you really wish to die?”</p>
<p>With slow steps, they began stalking each other in circles. Placing his sword perpendicular to his body, Noah’s expression didn’t change.</p>
<p>“Living… no longer holds any meaning for me.”</p>
<p>Assuming an attacking stance, the emperor replied, “I commend your bravery. Then, allow me the honor of severing your head from your neck!”</p>
<p><em>Swoosh!</em></p>
<p><em>Clank!</em></p>
<p>“You must be mistaken. Between the two of us, you are the brave one for daring to covet someone else’s wife!”</p>
<p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>
<p>Amidst their deadly exchanges, the emperor laughed. “Coveting another’s wife, aren’t you referring to yourself?”</p>
<p>Noah clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>“You desired your brother’s wife.” Then he added with a grin, “But do not worry, you will have many more chances to covet her, that is—<em>when she becomes my empress!</em>”</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>Noah struck his sword with extreme brute force that numbed the emperor’s hand numb, causing him to let go of his weapon. The nearby knights rushed to defend their sovereign.</p>
<p>“Stop right there, Duke Maktus!”</p>
<p>Without another thought, Noah swung his sword towards the knights who barged in on their duel. Black energy escaped from his body and started attacking them. The knights soon writhed in agony from its lethal strikes.</p>
<p>Noah quickly went into sheathed-sword position by placing his weapon by his side. Bending his right foot forward and lowering his upper body, he swiftly released his sword and made a sweeping motion that cut through the air.</p>
<p><em>Shiiinggg!</em></p>
<p>The knights paused and grabbed their stomachs, then they all fell over, blood and insides pooling across the floor. Terror appeared on the face of every noble who saw this ghastly scene, but they were quick to cover their expressions. But even then, fear was evident in their eyes.</p>
<p>Grabbing his blood-stained sword, Noah steadily approached the emperor who was already waiting in a defensive position.</p>
<p>“Duke!” He loudly declared, “By continuing your lawless acts, do you, hereby, admit to committing treason?!”</p>
<p>Noah answered in a lackadaisical manner, playfully swinging his sword in front of him. “I only want my wife back. Pray tell, how is that treason?”</p>
<p>“If only you had obediently married my sister, your life would’ve been spared.” the emperor bellowed to his subordinates, “Capture the rebel!”</p>
<p>The knights clamored towards Noah’s location. But then, a gun was fired, immediately distracting the battle-driven people into a screeching halt.</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>The enemy sword closest to Noah was knocked off from the knight’s hand. When both the emperor and Noah simultaneously turned their heads in a single direction, what they saw was one of the bridesmaids holding a bouquet with smoke coming from the center.</p>
<p>“Please stop.”</p>
<p>Hearing the voice, the two immediately knew who she was without even seeing her face.</p>
<p>Removing the veil and cloth covering the bridesmaid’s face, a familiar face revealed itself. She even pulled out the gun she had hidden among the flowers.</p>
<p>Seeing this shocking turn of events, the princess hatefully clenched her teeth.</p>
<p>“Adellia, how are you even here?!”</p>
<p>The emperor and Noah had the same thoughts. How did she sneak around undetected? Meanwhile, the guests followed the two men’s line of sight. When they saw her, they were stupefied.</p>
<p>Adele sighed deeply. “Supervision and management were too sloppy; I was able to enter by taking advantage of it.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Adele felt a little embarrassed by being the center of attention and spoke, “I have something to return to the emperor.” She took off her white glove and took off the ring on her fourth finger.</p>
<p>She presented it to the emperor. He looked at the emerald ring and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Adele—”</p>
<p>“Scram!” The princess cut off the emperor’s words and shouted. “Go away, Adellia! T-this is my wedding!”</p>
<p>The other bridesmaids quickly restrained the princess because Adele had a gun. But the princess shoved them aside and walked towards her with a conceited look. But Adele was unperturbed, she carelessly fired another shot without a change in her calm expression.</p>
<p>The princess shrieked, <em>“Ah!”</em></p>
<p>“Please be quiet.”</p>
<p>The bullet landed right in front of the princess’s feet. Overcome with shock, the princess glanced at Adele with tightened fists.</p>
<p>And then she fainted.</p>
<p>Adele gave her a fleeting glance, then she turned her head to face the emperor. “Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She let out a breath and continued, “I want to remain as Lady Maktus. I am deeply sorry, I will not be able to repay you in this lifetime.”</p>
<p> </p>
