            <p><strong>Chapter 46 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>“Haven’t I told you before?” Noah pressed his lips against Adele’s wet cheeks.“I will make your body into a body that won’t ever be satisfied without me.”</p>
<p><em>And I think I have already succeeded.</em> As Noah let out a small laugh and kept on moving his waist, Adele let out a feeble moan.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>She was muddled. Her sight was blurry, and she felt cold, but there’s this burning sensation in her body.</p>
<p>It keeps getting wet down there. Her head was filled with racing thoughts.</p>
<p><em>I want him to touch me more, to handle me roughly, I want to feel better…</em> With a lust-filled expression, she gazed at Noah with fluttering lashes. Adele could only raise her hand, Noah grabbed it and intertwined his fingers with hers.</p>
<p>“So now, do you think you can live without me?”</p>
<p>Adele shook her head. <em>Ah, i-it’s coming! I want to feel good, I want to feel better…</em></p>
<p>“This weak body that can’t even climax without my help.”</p>
<p>“F-faster—<em>ah!</em> —harder…”</p>
<p>“Now you won’t be able to live without me.”</p>
<p>Noah kissed her cheek and gave her a saccharine smile as he pounded onto her. Adele arched her back and Noah kept moving, but then her body stiffened.</p>
<p>Her whole body was numb, and she couldn’t move, and she couldn’t even think properly. She could only shed tears at the pleasure that rendered her mind blank.</p>
<p>She screamed out in extreme carnal bliss.</p>
<p>As Adele remained still, softly moaning from time to time, Noah finally stopped. He tried to pull himself out of her as he kissed her on the corner of her wet eyes. Adele stopped him by squeezing him harder.</p>
<p>“Release your seed inside of me.”</p>
<p><em>I like it because it’s warm.</em> She wanted something hot inside her body because of the drug. Noah stroked her belly, and in no time, plunged himself inside her depths again.</p>
<p>Feeling the pleasure building up inside him, he said, “You want me to c*m inside you?”</p>
<p>“…ah…”</p>
<p>“Adele.”</p>
<p>Adele only moved her waist in annoyance when the warm liquid did not spread inside of her.</p>
<p>“I asked you if you’d like me to cum inside you.”</p>
<p>Adele nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>“F-faster…” Hurrying him, Adele tightened and loosened her inner muscles repeatedly.</p>
<p>His response was one deep thrust. “You must be really desperate for it.”</p>
<p>“Give me lots of it…”</p>
<p>Adele bit her lip.</p>
<p>Noah zeroed into her action as he narrowed his eyes and gritted his teeth. He abruptly planted his lips onto hers and relentlessly plundered her mouth.</p>
<p>As she felt his tongue speeding up, clenching her inner walls and squeezing him was all but forgotten.</p>
<p><em>It feels so good to have my tongue tingle. </em>After teasing Adele’s little tongue for a while, he pulled his lips off and grabbed her ass.</p>
<p>“Adele.”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“Should I make you pregnant?”</p>
<p>Adele didn’t understand his words at the moment and tilted her head.</p>
<p>“You want me to c*m inside you and make you pregnant, right?”</p>
<p>At his bewitching voice, Adele nodded subconsciously, not really comprehending. <em>Anything is fine, so, come on, make me feel good.</em></p>
<p>Noah’s eyes were filled with lust for her. He quickly hammered himself against her and gave her what she wanted.</p>
<p>“Ha, uh…”</p>
<p><em>More, more!</em> Adele teared up as Noah pulled his penis out. Then, the semen naturally dripped. She looked at it and grabbed him by the waist, asking for more. Noah pinched Adele’s chin lightly.</p>
<p>“You want me to do it again?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“You want to feel good?”</p>
<p>Again, she nodded.</p>
<p>“Alright.” He smirked, “You can’t live without me now.”</p>
<p>Adele looked down at him and touched his eyes. Noah bit her finger. “Live with me.”</p>
<p>Adele was motionless, Noah kissed the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>“Stay with me forever, Adellia.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I shall make you feel all this pleasure every time and more.”</p>
<p>When Adele looked at him blankly, Noah smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it one more time.” Then he said provocatively, “I’ll c*m a lot more this time.”</p>
<p>Adele smiled meekly and nodded at Noah’s lewd remarks. He fell over the bed holding her as she sat on top of him…</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day after the tea party.</p>
<p>“Princess, you seem to be in a good mood today.”</p>
<p>“Hm, is it obvious?”</p>
<p>The princess, who had recently gone out, returned the hat she was holding to the maid. She smiled as she recalled Adele who drank the drugged tea yesterday. She didn’t feel bad at all.</p>
<p><em>By now, Noah Maktus must have rejected or turned away his wife. He would’ve hated Adele who clung to him like a leech.</em></p>
<p>The princess, thinking Noah would soon be alone, struggled to hold back her laughter. At that time, a maid rushed into the dressing room and called her.</p>
<p>“Princess, there’s a guest.”</p>
<p>“A guest?”</p>
<p>“Duke Noah Maktus is waiting for you at the garden.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened in shock, “Noah?”</p>
<p><em>Hm.</em> The princess tilted her head to the side and then headed for the garden.</p>
<p><em>Did he come because of what I did? Impossible. He doesn’t love his wife. But seeing that he came here for me… Well, even if he asks me, I can just deny it. He doesn’t know, there’s no evidence either, so he can’t just simply accuse me.</em></p>
<p>As the princess set foot inside the greenhouse garden, she saw Noah sitting at a tea table. He was drinking from a teacup without saying a word. The princess frowned in uncertainty and walked to him.</p>
<p>When she finally arrived before him, she saw Noah looking at her with a dazzling smile. Momentarily stumped, the princess forgot what she was about to say. She unknowingly blushed and sat down on her seat.</p>
<p>Noah started, “Long time no see, princess.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you to come here. Is there anything that I can help you with?”</p>
<p>Because they were in the castle, she needed to speak politely.</p>
<p>Noah answered calmly as well. “I came here to thank you.”</p>
<p>“Thank me?”</p>
<p>“I had a good time with my wife, thanks to you.” Then another smile graced his features.</p>
<p>Stunned silly, his words weren’t processed properly in her flustered mind.</p>
<p>“W-what?”</p>
