            <p><strong>Chapter 97</strong></p>
<p>The little maid looked a little nervous, “Apologies, Your Ladyship. I do not have the authority to decide that matter. Moreover, your safety is of primary concern. It would be dangerous if you meet with outsiders.”</p>
<p>“I am aware of the gravity of the situation. However, those girls are people that I care for. I don’t know what will happen to the duke, but what will happen to those girls if they aren’t taken under my wing… That much is obvious.”</p>
<p>Adele exhaled distractedly and gazed at the maid before her, “They are like little sisters to me, I want to see them.”</p>
<p>The maid stood still for a while and spoke. “I shall see what I can do, Your Ladyship.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” She uttered, “You may go now.”</p>
<p>The other servants bowed in response to her words, but Adele could detect their faces were anxious. Feeling it was a little strange, she squeezed her sweaty palms.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After a while, another knock was heard.</p>
<p>It was after lunch time and Adele was drinking tea. When she told them to enter, the door opened, and her eyes widened at the sight of the two familiar faces.</p>
<p>Lina and Ellie came towards Adele with tears in their eyes, covered in dust and dirt.</p>
<p>“Lina, Ellie!”</p>
<p>“Mila—!”</p>
<p>Lina quickly shut the mouth of Ellie, who was about to call her ‘Milady’. She then lowered her head as she lifted her skirt on both sides.</p>
<p>“Greetings to the future Empress!”</p>
<p>Lina was a little more sensible now. Considering what had happened, they must’ve gone through a lot themselves. Perhaps even now, their lives must be on the line as their every action was still being monitored.</p>
<p>Even though their appearance was a bit filthier than usual, they still retained a semblance of how a personal maid should be.</p>
<p>Adele smiled bitterly and motioned for them to sit.</p>
<p>The two of sat at the table and couldn’t stop themselves from weeping. Lina eventually wiped her wet cheeks and told her in a relieved tone, “We’re so glad to see that you are safe and sound, mila-future Empress.”</p>
<p>“Shh, don’t cry now. It’s my fault, I should have taken care of you better.”</p>
<p>“Huu…” Lina and Ellie were busy crying that they couldn’t even begin to talk.</p>
<p>Adele was wiping her own dampened eyes with a handkerchief when she felt a peculiar gaze on her and turned her head. The maid standing in front of the wall was looking at her directly.</p>
<p>They were polite, but something, like their attitude, really felt off. It made Adele feel like she was under tight surveillance.</p>
<p>Maybe she really was… Adele furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>At the same time, Lina, who was sitting with her back to the maids, suddenly sobbed loudly and bowed down to an angle where the palace maids couldn’t see her hands. Then she drew the Duke Maktus’ pattern with her finger on the table and crossed them out with a big ‘X’.</p>
<p>Adele struggled to contain her sadness, she stood abruptly and went to her dressing table.</p>
<p>In one of the drawers, there was some ornaments that she wore back when she passed out. After she brought them out, she took off her earrings and bracelet she currently wore and gave all of them to both Ellie and Lina.</p>
<p>“This is in return for taking care of me all this time.”</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>Her two maids felt panicked, but Adele only let out a sigh of resignation and guilt.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry, these are the only things I am able to give you. But do not worry, I will make a request to the emperor to ascertain your safety once you leave the palace walls.”</p>
<p>Adele looked kindly upon Ellie and comforted her, “Thank you for helping me as well, you travelled such a long way from home in another country, just to be met with misfortune. I truly am sorry.”</p>
<p>Ellie, who was born and raised here in Astria, creased her forehead in confusion. She didn’t understand what nonsense her mistress was saying and was about to correct her when Lina suddenly grabbed her hand, stopping her from saying anything detrimental.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Adele remained calm and spoke steadily using the Nammon language.</p>
<p>[I want to escape the imperial palace, help me find a way.]</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>[But if it gets too dangerous… please…]</p>
<p>Adele was gambling on the fact that the Nammon language was only used in developed areas. Thus, there was the probability that the palace maids wouldn’t understand her even if they’ve received higher education.</p>
<p>Ellie blinked as realization dawned on her, then she shook her head.</p>
<p>[Milady, wouldn’t that be dangerous? Now that the duke has fallen, it would be even harder to leave this place. Isn’t it safer for you to stay?]</p>
<p>[There must areas we can slip out of undetected because of the chaos brought by the civil war. I do not intend on going back to the duke’s castle nor will I go back to my hometown.]</p>
<p>Adele breathed in slightly and examined the expressions of the monitoring maids, noticing that they didn’t look suspicious, she continued.</p>
<p>[I plan to go to another country, a neutral one, dressed as a commoner, where no military of other countries can simply trespass. I just need to be able to quickly have transportation ready once I’m out of palace grounds.]</p>
<p>Seeing the determined glint in her mistress’s eyes, Ellie felt a surge of courage in her heart.</p>
<p>[If that is milady’s wish, I shall do my best to find you a way out.]</p>
<p>Adele nodded.</p>
<p>[Just as I’ve said before, your safety is your priority. Do not overdo things, am I understood? Don’t move alone and go together with Lina.]</p>
<p>Ellie nodded and cried again.</p>
<p>[Yes, milady!]</p>
<p>The palace maids couldn’t understand what the two were saying, but they watched the sad scene unfold with solemn expressions. Just then, a commotion was heard outside, and Adele heard the troubled voice of the knight guarding the door.</p>
<p>“Princess, the Emperor has ordered that no one is allowed to come in here.”</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>A resounding of slap was heard, and the door swung open. The princess wearing a golden tiara sauntered in, looking down at Adele with an arrogant gaze.</p>
