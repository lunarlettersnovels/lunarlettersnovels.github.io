            <p><b>Chapter 50</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the tip of Lina’s finger, there was the sealing mark of the royal family on the letter. Adele accepted it and took the letter out of the envelope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Dear Adellia Maktus, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard that you have gotten ill due to the foolish conduct of the princess. I can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">only apologize to you as her brother. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please do not feel burdened and accept this gift I have sent as a token of my </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sincerity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would bring me joy to see you at the dinner party in good health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signed,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">       Rayence Quincet 」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele switched her attention from the letter to Lina who held out a box wrapped in black velvet. When she removed the cover, a golden necklace with a 12-carat emerald unveiled itself in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised, she touched the large jewel with her trembling fingers. At that moment, the emerald shone. The wound she received while making food for Noah not long ago healed instantly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She gasped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was no ordinary thing. It was a necklace imbued with healing magic!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele sighed and bit her lip. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I refuse this, it would mean that I have not received his apology. On the other hand, if I accept this, the value attached to this precious gem is quite burdensome, not to mention it’s healing properties.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hand, which was about to push the box away, hesitated. Then she realized that her body was aching here and there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She picked up the necklace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lina was attentive to her mistress’s actions and carefully took and clasped it behind her nape. The elegant jewelry hung around her pale neck with the gemstone laid between the valley of her breasts. Soon, a dazzling light shone and engulfed Adele’s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, the kiss marks began to disappear, and the swollen areas had been healed. The maids who saw it was at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“M-milady, what just happened? Was that magic?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that her body was all healed, she remembered the emperor and smiled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is nothing to be surprised of. In any case, what date is today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lina rubbed her eyes in disbelief and answered. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, there’s just a week before the dinner party. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele had a lot to prepare. She also had to host a tea party event the following month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stood, “I’m going out to the streets tomorrow. Prepare well according to my arrangements.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes? Ah! Yes, milady!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Lina’s answer, the other maids also came to their senses and started organizing the bedding and clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Milady, it’s been a while since I’ve been out on the streets. There are many shops I haven’t seen before, they must be new!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lina excitedly took a quick glimpse of the surroundings and spoke in an eager voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele smiled and silently gazed about, her eyes shifting from left to right was the only movement that came from her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to her former husband’s funeral and her subsequent marriage, she only had the time to meander the streets after two months. During those two months, it was apparent that lot has changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a newly opened dessert shop where there was once an empty lot, and there’s this boutique putting up a fancy signboard. She came out to prepare for a dinner party, but this change of scenery somehow uplifted her mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, milady! I heard that the circus is coming in today!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circus?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so? We have a lot of time, let’s take a stroll for a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, milady!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While listening to Lina’s enthusiastic reply, she saw another boutique across the street. She had to go to a dinner party, so she naturally had to buy a dress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele was walking towards the store when she abruptly paused, some men sauntered past her grumblingly and walked into the alley right next to her. She heard their griping words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shipbuilding work is all sh*t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel bad for you. Who knew the ship you built for the Duke Maktus would be ruined just like that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes widened when she heard them say the familiar name. As they entered the alley, Adele unwittingly moved her steps. Lina called from behind, but Adele beckoned her to wait for a moment and followed after them. The men continued chattering without knowing that somebody was following them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel wronged. I checked every nook and cranny over and over again. I even had the bulbous bow perfectly attached but when the ship came back, it disappeared! It must have been deliberately removed by someone!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as Adele knew, the bulbous bow was a structure attached to the ship that served to block the resistance from the waves. How could it be gone?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how careless Enon was, there was no way he wouldn’t have checked something that concerned his safety. Besides, Enon was the only one who died on the ship. Maybe someone had a grudge? But he’s not the type of person to make enemies…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another man spoke, “Man, how can a person cut a bulbous bow by himself? If it had been cut off, at least one arm would’ve fallen off together!” he paused, “You’re lucky though, the new duke didn’t ask for any compensation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing the other person’s words of comfort to the shipbuilder, Adele thought of Noah. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why didn’t he ask for compensation?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, when such an accident occurred, the victim/s or their family would demand reparations and the builder would be punished. This was customary. </span></p>
