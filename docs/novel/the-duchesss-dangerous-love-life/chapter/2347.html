            <p><strong>Chapter 10 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Adele bit her lip and Noah wiped her pale face with his hand. Her lips visibly quivered when she felt his rigid shaft on her th!ghs. She had never done anything like this before. This action… Adele blushed her face and said hurriedly.</p>
<p>“T-turn off the lights.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p><em>How—!</em></p>
<p>Adele reached out to turn off the lights but was promptly stopped by Noah as he placed his lips onto her ravishingly plump bre@st. Without lifting his mouth, he pressed his hand underneath her bosom with his hand, kneading it with just the right amount of force.</p>
<p>As Noah’s tongue twirled and played with her n!pples, her body stiffened as another strange sensation welled up inside her being.</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p><em>What should I do? My body just keeps losing strength. </em>As Adele slightly drooped, Noah opened his mouth wider and sucked hard on her chest. He grabbed her pelvis with his large hands and bulging veins. Squeezing her pub!s with his thumbs, he continued to suck and lightly nipped at her sensitive peaks.</p>
<p>The feeling was so novel to her as a pleasured m0an flowed through her lips. “Ugh!”</p>
<p>She thought that s*x was about man touching her bre@sts and putting his pen!s inside of hers. She had no idea that it was so much more than that. He can stimulate her body by simply touching it. As Adele let out feeble groan, Noah went further down. Finally, the thick, swollen nub he licked before touched his thumb.</p>
<p>Adele’s eyes widened at the sensation. Noah immediately slammed his face into her little hole that was slick with her own fluids, and now, with his saliva. Sucking her clitoris with his tongue, her grabbed her under her knees and lifted her legs to lap it all up. Adele was breathless and couldn’t do anything else but bit her lip. In the meantime, her sensual m0ans continued to rolling out of her mouth.</p>
<p>“Hngf, ugh!”</p>
<p>Adele, who was exceedingly aroused by such an exhilarating action, twisted her body. For a moment, Noah spread his legs apart and leaned over Adele’s torso, revealing his pub!c hair and buttocks.</p>
<p>“How did you manage to hide such a delectable thing all along?”</p>
<p>She didn’t respond, and she couldn’t respond even if she wanted to.</p>
<p>“It’s all wet, sister-in-law.”</p>
<p><em>“S-shameless!”</em></p>
<p>Adele’s face was burning with embarrassment. She raised her torso and Noah bowed his head to narrow the gap between their lips. Adele was stunned by the sudden approach of his face.</p>
<p>Noah tilted his head politely and looked at her. Adele didn’t say anything, and just moved her lips. Noah licked her lips at once.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“It seems like you’ve never had a kiss before.”</p>
<p>“It’s not how you think it is!” In tears, Adele remembered the kiss she had with her husband. She either kissed his lips before sleeping or when no one was around, and even then, their tongues only slightly intertwined.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>Adele turned her head, eyes brimming with tears of pleasure and shame. Noah grabbed her chin with her hand and made her look at him. “Didn’t I tell you to look at me?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, s-stop… I don’t…”</p>
<p>“You can’t enjoy it alone.”</p>
<p><em>I haven’t even done anything—Hm?!</em></p>
<p>Noah rubbed his erect member against her creamy white legs. She hurriedly closed her slip with her hand.</p>
<p><em>If that big thing is inside me, I would be utterly wrecked!</em></p>
<p>Adele swallowed her saliva.</p>
<p>Raising an eyebrow at her action, he pulled the slip down. In an instant, it was torn. With just a few of gestures, Adele was instantly n@ked. Flushed red from the nape of her neck, she bit her lip.</p>
<p>“It’s not even your first time, so why are you trembling?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Then, it was as if he was struck by realization, “Or is it?”</p>
<p>He felt slightly dazed.</p>
<p>Adele remembered that two years ago, her husband opened up her clothes on the first night and said that he was sorry. But she was happy even without this, she was perfectly fine. She didn’t need this kind of thing. This kind of… pleasure.</p>
<p><em>“Ugh!”</em></p>
<p>Snapping out of her thoughts, Adele let out a m0an when Noah sucked hard on her erect n!pple. She lightly slapped his broad shoulder with her hand in distaste.</p>
<p>Noah carelessly stroked Adele’s body with his hand as if he had been hit with nothing but air. She was gentle as she was relaxed, but at the same time, persistent. He looked at her swollen bre@sts and ran his hand over her wet underside once more.</p>
<p>He let out a sound of satisfaction. “You’re even wetter than before.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m so glad that my brother died unaware of such a gorgeous and lewd body.” His faintly elated voice resounded through her ears. Noah reached out slowly and stroked Adele’s white cheek and kissed her.</p>
<p>It was a tenacious kiss filled with fervent excitement. Noah’s tongue provoked the meek Adele and rubbed it ardently. She choked on her breath and back arched. Needless to say, he squeezed Adele’s swollen bre@sts.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The pain was brief. Noah stroked her bosom softly, then pinched her nipples and rubbed them with his fingers. With his wet mouth, he bit and sucked on her nape. Adele couldn’t help but tremble slightly.</p>
<p>“Stop, stop! It feels strange…”</p>
<p>Noah, who was biting into Adele’s earlobe, let out a low whisper. “I shall let you enjoy this kind of pleasure in the future.”</p>
<p>Adele’s eyes widened at Noah’s sultry voice.</p>
<p>“That would be,” two of his fingers went right inside of her, “every night,” his thick, hard fingers wandered through her clenching, wet insides, “in my embrace.”</p>
<p>The faster his fingers moved, the more Adele couldn’t control her excitement. He pulled her body closer to him and tenderly enveloped her into his arms.</p>
