            <p><strong>Chapter 109</strong></p>
<p>Two weeks have passed since then.</p>
<p>Adele returned to the castle that day and explained the boy’s situation to the Duke and Duchess. The two respected their son’s wishes and decided to send back a carriage before it was time for him to enter the academy.</p>
<p>It seems like they wouldn’t be able to accompany him on the way there because their eldest son was ill, so they had no time to care about their youngest.</p>
<p>Adele waited by the gates to respectfully send off the pair of husband and wife. After that, she became busy for a while due to the castle’s internal affairs and upper-class work. From time to time, she would gaze at the mountains through the window and couldn’t help but think of the boy as she sorted out some documents in her hand.</p>
<p>She wanted to visit, but she had no spare time. Even personal time for herself could be considered a luxury.</p>
<p>But after hearing the news that her maternal grandmother had pneumonia that threatened her life, Adele got into a carriage late at night. This caused Baron Lilliand to be very worried about his daughter, who was leaving when the moon was already so high up.</p>
<p>“I feel uneasy to let you travel at such an hour.”</p>
<p>A helpless expression could be seen on her face, “I’ll be safe father, don’t worry. I will let grandmother know that you worry for her when I get there.”</p>
<p>The baron pouted, unwilling to part with his beloved daughter.</p>
<p>Then he sighed, “Alright. I’m going to finish up my work and go tomorrow morning. Ah! And another thing, about that little bastard…”</p>
<p>There was only one person in this world that her father would call rudely right in front of her face.</p>
<p><em>Daniel.</em></p>
<p>“He came back yesterday and I kicked him out. He actually had the gall to ask me to let you meet with him? Tsk, to think such a man is an heir, the marquis has some rotten luck.”</p>
<p>Adele sighed, remembering his doltish expression.</p>
<p>Not long ago, she wrote a letter about Daniel’s foul behavior and delivered it to his grandfather, the Marquis.</p>
<p>The feelings of the Marquis, who value honor and face the most, cannot be expressed in words. His grandson embarrassed him by causing a scandal, and instead of apologizing to his fiancée, he even disrespected her! He felt like he was the one being shamed instead.</p>
<p>Hence, the Marquis sent her a jewel box as a token of apology.</p>
<p>The baron looked at Adele’s face, worried. “You… did not truly love him, right?”</p>
<p>She grinned. “Father, I already told you, I will break my engagement with him in a month.”</p>
<p>Because by then, Daniel and Bella might’ve tired of each other and would have probably broken up. She never wanted to do anything for someone who didn’t respect her as a person and would even belittle her being.</p>
<p>Perhaps he will be punished by his grandfather, and that ‘Bella’ would leave him out of her own volition. If that was the case, things would be even more fun.</p>
<p>Was she being petty? Maybe, but she didn’t really care. Back then, she was ready to agree to break off their marriage, but he just had to run off his mouth.</p>
<p>Adele snorted at the pathetic image of him groveling in her mind and quickly sat inside the carriage. “I need to go now.”</p>
<p>“Alright, you be careful lass. Do you have your gun with you?”</p>
<p>Adele shook her bag and nodded.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As soon as the carriage door closed, they departed. After travelling for a long time, they reached the top of the mountain. But all of a sudden, a loud noise was heard. The horses stopped moving and collapsed. The carriage fell to the side, and the coachman plummeted towards the ground and hit his head.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Adele let out a yelp.</p>
<p>Fortunately, only her arm received a harsh blow and she suffered no other injuries. The servant who first came to his senses opened the carriage door and went out. He reached for her hand to get her out, but then he groaned. His head began to bleed and he immediately lost consciousness.</p>
<p>“Uh!”</p>
<p>Behind him, were three men looking down at them, grinning and laughing.</p>
<p>“Hehe… little miss.”</p>
<p>“Well, well. Look what we have here?”</p>
<p>“She’s prettier than what I’ve heard.”</p>
<p>Adele found it hard to think that they were thieves. This is because thieves only target the more prestigious carriages that carried a lot of stuff, where they were sure to make money if they succeeded. The one she rode on was unadorned and too simple.</p>
<p>What’s more, they usually traveled in large numbers because monsters appeared a lot in this mountain, and ordinary men wouldn’t be able to take them down with just a scant few of them.</p>
<p>The men grabbed Adele’s arm and dragged her out of the carriage. Crouching down on the ground, she tried to calm her trembling body and spoke. “Did Daniel send you here?”</p>
<p>They grinned and pulled out a rope. “There was no need for us to cross paths. You should’ve broken off the engagement when you had the chance.”</p>
<p>Adele steadied her voice. “You know who I am, right? If you dare to do this, both you and Daniel will be in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Sorry to break it to you, sweetheart, but our boss has the perfect alibi by attending a count’s party today.” They eyed her lasciviously, “There’s no way anyone can link this incident to him. So, we’re going to have fun with you first before we enter Telen.”</p>
