            <p><strong>Chapter 52</strong></p>
<p>Adele heard her maid calling for her. She swiveled her gaze and she saw Lina running closer towards her. Behind her, Noah stood like the god of death, his venomous gaze condemning unfortunate souls of the damned to the depths of hell.</p>
<p>He took one step forward.</p>
<p>Philip saw his commander’s menacing expression and touched his head.</p>
<p><em>Unlucky bastards.</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, about what I said with me being able to spare your lives.” He chuckled and gave a sympathetic glance to the rest of them, “I take them back, you lot are doomed to die today.”</p>
<p>Outraged by his words, the men rushed at him with their makeshift weapons. Philip welcomed their assault. He swung his sword and ran at them while swiftly exchanging blows and parrying their attacks. One man slipped through his defenses and took Adele hostage by grabbing her arm and directing a weapon to her neck.</p>
<p>Noah’s eyes darkened.</p>
<p>A screeching hum reverberated against the walls of the alley and the sound of flesh being cut was heard.</p>
<p>Viscous red liquid adorned the sides of his blade.</p>
<p>The man’s decapitated head fell to the floor with a resounding thud, blood slowly pooling from the detached body.</p>
<p>Adele lips turned pale with shock when she saw its lifeless eyes staring straight at her and abruptly closed her eyes in fright. But then she felt something strange. As she cautiously peeked at the corpse, she saw that his lips were exceptionally black.</p>
<p>Just like Enon’s when he drowned.</p>
<p>“Step back.”</p>
<p>Noah furrowed his brows and stood in front of her while holding a blood-stained sword.</p>
<p>Adele lowered her gaze, stomach churning at the sight of corpse and those black lips. But the metallic smell of blood mixed with his thick woody scent seemed to calm her turbulent thoughts for some reason. Her trembling ceased as well.</p>
<p>“Hurry up and kill him, damn it! Suppress him with our numbers!”</p>
<p>When a thug that appeared to be the leader of the group bellowed angrily, everyone attacked, and another bout of fighting occurred.</p>
<p>A wrangler swerved his club at Noah, but he only had his head cut with a light movement of his opponent’s arm. Noah grinned, thrilled with all the slaughter as blood splattered on his cheek.</p>
<p>He laughed softly, his golden eyes relishing in the pleasure of killing. Instantly, the alley was filled with carnage and the air of death.</p>
<p>The hoodlums in front of him trembled involuntarily, fear overruling against their rational thoughts. Noah took adjusted his stance and coldly slashed his sword against their petrified bodies.</p>
<p>Then, a faint moan reached his ears.</p>
<p>Adele gasped as she saw the corpse that had fallen close to her ankles. The putrid stench that grew stronger by the second made her nauseous, but she struggled to endure.</p>
<p>Noah was just about to start his killing spree, but seeing her in this state, he suddenly cursed out loud.</p>
<p>“F*ck it!”</p>
<p>Noah slammed his sword into the ground, thin coils of black energy expanded rapidly and wrapped themselves around the filthy men’s necks. It increasingly tightened itself like a noose, the men choked and shortly breathed their last. Noah relinquished his control of the black energy and it immediately vanished into nothingness.</p>
<p>Philip widened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Commander, why use black energy against these people that can just be easily killed?”</p>
<p>But his question was soon answered by Noah’s actions.</p>
<p>Noah quickly put his sword back in its sheath and gently caressed the shivering Adele, he softly placed the back of his fingers against her cheeks.</p>
<p>When Adele lifted her head, she saw his eyes filled with worry. She nodded her head to indicate that she was fine. But her face turned pale when she saw the dead bodies that littered the cold, hard ground with their blackened tongues sticking out.</p>
<p>She felt bile rising from her stomach.</p>
<p>Noah hugged her tightly, gently stroking her rigid back to calm her shaking body. With his silent consolation, her ragged breathing gradually settled down. Noah felt Adele’s breath steadying and glanced at Phillip. He drew an oblique line with his chin.</p>
<p>For others, it may have looked like something akin to a single shake of the head, but Phillip knew better.</p>
<p><em>Kill all the men that ran away.</em></p>
<p>Philip stuck out his similarly blackened tongue, he navigated through the dead bodies and moved deeper into the back of the alley. When Philip disappeared, Noah reverted his attention back to the woman in his arms.</p>
<p>“Are you injured anywhere?”</p>
<p>“N-no.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing the answer, Noah lowered his head and rubbed his nose against the nape of her delicate neck. He wasn’t able to satisfy his lust for slaughter, so he had to do something else. In that moment, the perfect target was already in front of him.</p>
<p>As he inhaled deeply, he took in her sweet scent. Adele flinched when he touched at a sensitive area.</p>
<p>Noah saw Adele trembling in his arms like a timid squirrel. It showed the cute side of her that made him want to kiss her right there and then, but they were outside. Remembering how easily abashed she was, he reckoned that if he forced his mouth into her, she really just might bite off his tongue. He grinned as he recalled the adorable threat she uttered last time.</p>
