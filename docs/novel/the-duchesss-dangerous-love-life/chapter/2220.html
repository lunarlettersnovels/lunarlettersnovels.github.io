            <p><strong>Chapter 137</strong></p>
<p>Adele instinctively tightened and loosened herself down there, then she lifted her upper body slightly. With her bare chest exposed to him, Noah lowered his head and kissed her creamy breasts and neck over and over again.</p>
<p>“I suffered more than just that.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t even see you, but I keep thinking about—”</p>
<p>Adele gasped loudly.</p>
<p>“Huh… w-what? Are you…” Even though she wanted to ask what was bothering him, Adele’s mind was already becoming hazy as she could only moan at the pleasurable sensation she was feeling.</p>
<p>Gazing at her coming undone on top of him, Noah’s eyes moistened.</p>
<p>This was the woman who appeared in his dreams every night.</p>
<p>His partner.</p>
<p>“Adellia.”</p>
<p>She moaned in response.</p>
<p>The young man who couldn’t find other words to effectively convey just exactly what the wondrous sensation he was feeling deep in his chest. He smiled and his eyes turned soft as he watched her adoringly.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>Afraid to hear the answer, Noah reflexively increased his pace and began to f*ck her even harder as she bobbed on top of him, her breasts jiggling at the same time.</p>
<p>Having the control wrenched away from her, Adele’s body slowly lowered as her knees gradually weakened, but Noah supported her and placed her in his arms. Just then, she barely came to her senses and replied to him.</p>
<p>“Hehe… Me too.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I love you too…” she giggled.</p>
<p>“F*ck!”</p>
<p>Noah spat out a few more curse words and furiously ravaged her insides as his excitement heightened to the extreme. The two of them began feeling the build-up of the momentum in their bellies.</p>
<p>When they couldn’t hold on any longer, they both cried out.</p>
<p><em>“Aaahhh!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ughhh!”</em></p>
<p>Climax took over her body. Adele trembled and half closed her eyes.</p>
<p>His mind was only 17 years old, one who has never touched a woman before. How could he pleasure her so well?</p>
<p>Adele covered her mouth in wonder and stared at him intently.</p>
<p>As soon as he opened his eyes from his release, Noah had never stopped looking straight at her, not wanting to lose sight of her even for a fleeting moment.</p>
<p>It was as if his eyes were screaming he loved him, and his body ached to show her just exactly how much he cared. He reached out his hand to hold her, but Adele unwittingly raised her hand and stroked his hair.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She commented with a light snigger, “You did great…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m not treating you like a child. It’s just that, I’m in awe. Supposedly, this should be your first time…”</p>
<p>At her words, Noah’s face began to turn red again. He turned his head to avoid her gaze and Adele’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“…sorry, I was too excited. I’ll… take it out right away.” Then he quickly removed himself from inside of her.</p>
<p>“Ah?” Realizing something, her eyes popped, “Did you not take the medicine that the butler gave you last night?”</p>
<p>“Medicine? The one where they said it’s a drug that promotes my memory?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Well… that’s…”</p>
<p>At the exact moment, the butler sneezed. James seemed to think that even if the lord lost his memory, his married life would still be good. Thinking up to this point, the man felt a little embarrassed at being so familiar with their habits, even in bed, that he was able to pinpoint his masters’ circumstances so well.</p>
<p>Adele clarified for him, “It’s the birth control pill.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Our relationship was so good that we did it… very often. Pills aren’t very good for women’s health, that’s why you ate the birth control pill every day and not… me…”</p>
<p>Noah was silent for a fraction for a second, then he spoke.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case…” Noah lifted her legs and laid them over his shoulders. Then he glanced at her, rubbing his tip against Adele’s entrance. “Two times.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t we agree to do it three times a day?”</p>
<p>At Adele’s lustful expression, Noah hurriedly pinned her body beneath his. After that, only moans and other erotic noises could be heard from the room for a long while.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Feeling her throat becoming parched, Adele awakened from her rest after all of his… hammering was finished.</p>
<p>“Ah… I’m thirsty.”</p>
<p>She caught a glimpse of Noah, who had also fallen asleep while hugging her tightly. Just like a large Siberian Husky embracing her master uncaring if his size crushed her to death.</p>
<p>She lifted her body up slowly and smirked as she got out of her bed.</p>
<p>The maids who guessed the couple’s relationship would have been good, attentively prepared teapots and cups on the office table and had the foresight to leave them outside the bedroom. Perfectly anticipating when they would wake up, or at least one of them.</p>
<p>Adele wore the slip that hung on the wall and twisted the doorknob. Noah suddenly grabbed her arm.</p>
<p>“Don’t go.”</p>
<p>Startled, she asked, “How long have you been awake?”</p>
<p>“I said don’t go.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Is there anything wrong?”</p>
<p>“You can’t—<em>ugh!</em>”</p>
