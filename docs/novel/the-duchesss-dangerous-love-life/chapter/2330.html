            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 27</strong></p>
<p><em>‘…’</em></p>
<p>When Noah didn’t respond, this time, his father was the one who spoke.</p>
<p><em>‘Don’t be like that and take a look. Your sister-in-law chose her for you.’</em></p>
<p>When Noah, who had been indifferent until now, responded, <em>‘My sister-in-law?’</em></p>
<p>His mother was taken aback for a moment and then beamed. <em>‘Y-yes! Take a look first, you can meet her afterwards if you want!’</em></p>
<p>Noah took a look at the portrait and let out a snort. Everyone frowned at the cold atmosphere that emerged all of a sudden. Soon, he got up and left the room without a word. With his sharp attitude, everyone could only watch his back before he completely disappeared.</p>
<p><em>‘Why is he still like that…’</em></p>
<p>The mother-in-law stared at the door where Noah had left and clicked her tongue, she moved her sight to Adele. Her father-in-law lit a cigarette and sighed.</p>
<p><em>‘He is my son, but I can never truly know what goes inside his head.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘I will go and ask him.’ </em>Her husband, Enon, got up and left the room. Adele followed and grabbed his arm.</p>
<p><em>‘I will go.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘You?’ </em>his tone silently asking why.</p>
<p><em>‘He was acting like that because he didn’t like my choice.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘There’s no need for you to go.’ </em>At Enon’s words, Adele shook her head and stepped forward.</p>
<p>Hastily moving her feet, she asked the maids where Noah was last seen. As she reached the garden, she saw Noah on his horse, getting ready to leave.</p>
<p><em>‘Noah!’</em></p>
<p>Seeing her approaching, he acknowledged, <em>‘Sister-in-law.’</em></p>
<p>Noah turned his head and Adele walked cautiously.</p>
<p><em>‘I’m sorry for what happened earlier. I did not mean to upset you by choosing her.’</em></p>
<p>As Noah frowned, Adele fiddled with her fingers anxiously.</p>
<p><em>‘I mean, this is not revenge because you opposed my marriage.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘I just picked her because she looked pretty, and I thought she would match you well.’</em></p>
<p>At Adele’s words, Noah faced his body completely in her direction.</p>
<p><em>‘Sister-in-law.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Yes?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Do you love my brother?’</em></p>
<p>Adele’s eyes widened at the unexpected question. Of course, she was going to answer yes. But seeing his bitter golden eyes, as if he could not tolerate a single lie…</p>
<p>She tried to weasel herself out of the question and said instead, <em>‘I understand your reluctance towards an arranged marriage—’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Sister-in-law.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘—but when you start to live together, you might have a change of heart and love her—’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Adellia.’ </em>Noah said in a firm, authoritative tone. He narrowed his eyes. He looked like a carnivore stalking its prey. Adele almost swayed, she quickly avoided his gaze and lowered her head.</p>
<p>Noah spoke softly.<em> ‘I asked you if you love him.’</em></p>
<p>She didn’t speak.</p>
<p><em>‘Seeing your response, it seems that I do not need to hear your answer.’</em></p>
<p>Adele raised her head. Noah got up on the horse. <em>He can’t go like this!</em> She hurried up to him and asked. <em>‘Are you going to meet Ms. Irie?’</em></p>
<p>Noah looked at Adele with eyes questioning her reason for asking him.</p>
<p><em>‘Why, are you curious?’</em></p>
<p>Adele was taken aback by Noah’s rudeness and responded quickly.</p>
<p><em>‘That is because I am now the lady of this family. If you decide to get married, then it means I shall have a sister-in-law in the near future.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Is that really the reason?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Do I really need to have any reason other than that?’</em></p>
<p>Instead of answering, Noah stared at her. Adele became flustered at his expression and shook her head. She didn’t know why he was asking so much, he didn’t seem to believe the words she said either.</p>
<p>It was fine if he didn’t believe her. However, his attitude towards her, his sister-in-law, was truly overly rude.</p>
<p>Adele clenched her fist.</p>
<p>She was from a low-ranked family, so it was clear that he looked down on her. Wasn’t that the case when he first met her?</p>
<p><em>‘Don’t treat Irie like how you treat me.’</em></p>
<p>At her words, Noah abruptly widened his eyes.</p>
<p><em>‘Why? How did I treat you?’</em></p>
<p>Instead of answering him directly, she simply advised him,</p>
<p><em>‘Always be kind to Ms. Irie. Give her flowers, jewels too if you wish, and reply kindly to her no matter how annoying they may be.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Don’t be so cold to her too…’</em></p>
<p>At Adele’s words, Noah’s expression turned strange. His entire being was stupefied and his brow furrowed. Adele saw the unusual expression on his face and hurriedly turned around, fearing that Noah would give a reply.</p>
<p>She quickly fled before he could even open his mouth and refute her words.</p>
<p>The garden that she passed by that day had a lot of roses and thorns.</p>
<p>“A lot of roses have bloomed again this year.”</p>
<p>Lina did not hear her mistress’s words clearly. “Sorry? Did you say something, milady?”</p>
<p>Adele paused, then recovered her usual calm. “It’s nothing.”</p>
