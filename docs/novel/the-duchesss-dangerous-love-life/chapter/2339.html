            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 18 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Adele, who was shaken by Noah’s finger yet again, came to her senses and turned around. She was obviously trying to resist him. Hence, Noah firmly lifted her body and laid her atop his lap, her back facing him. He glanced at her milky back and then ran his fingers across her bre@st, it was plump and swollen.</p>
<p>“Ha, I told you not to do—” He squeezed.</p>
<p>“It seems that he also didn’t touch these hard n!pples.”</p>
<p>Noah’s fingers pinched and twisted them. Adele squirmed then abruptly became still, startled by the bite he gave on her neck.</p>
<p>It left a red mark on her tender skin. As if to comfort the pain, he licked the bruise and moved down to her spine.</p>
<p>“What about here? Did he touch this pretty thing?”</p>
<p>“Stop! He never did that, uh!”</p>
<p>“What an idiot.” Noah said in an obvious ridiculing tone.</p>
<p>Adele was terrified and tried to push Noah away. But she had no choice but to gently spread her thighs as he rubbed his member on her entrance and played with her butt0cks.</p>
<p>“I’m guessing no one has ever touched you here before me either.”</p>
<p>“Stop rubbing!”</p>
<p>“How did you endure being this lonely?”</p>
<p>Noah wrapped her arms around Adele’s waist and rubbed her gen!tals violently. Her opening was too wet. His appendage that was flowing with bodily fluids became extremely slippery, making it easier to thrust into her. The scene was overly provocative.</p>
<p>“How did you hide this beautiful body for two years?”</p>
<p>“Hm, hng…”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you m@sturbated by yourself? Poking at your own v@gina while thinking of other men?” Adele widened her eyes at his words. Immediately, she shook her head and vigorously denied.  “I am not that kind of person!”</p>
<p>He whispered as she was still denying strongly. “I know that, but your body is truly overly prom!scuous. It’s the type of body made for s3x.”</p>
<p>“Ukh, my body is not like that!”</p>
<p>“Really? Then prove it to me.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Don’t m0an when I suck or thrust into you.”</p>
<p>Adele swallowed her saliva.</p>
<p>“Why should I?”</p>
<p>“I’ll grant you a wish if you succeed.”</p>
<p>Adele was enchanted by the word ‘wish’. She had many questions for him, she was most curious of the reason why he married her. She knew that he wouldn’t answer if she just asked him plainly. This way, Adele nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Noah raised his eyebrows and touched nether lips with his hand. “I don’t think you’re supposed to be confident in this.”</p>
<p>She bit her lip and contained her voice in order to win. He smirked and shoved his face into her aching core.</p>
<p>Adele’s legs were stretched out towards the ceiling and trembled incessantly. Noah buried his face between her legs, teasing her with his tongue and sucking at her sensitive spots.</p>
<p><em>Slurp, slurp.</em></p>
<p>Unable to contain it, white sticky liquid burst out until it flowed into her buttocks. He sucked and drank it. Seeing his actions, she wanted to tell him to stop.</p>
<p><em>This is too embarrassing. </em>Adele was speechless as she grabbed his hair.</p>
<p><em>Smooch!</em></p>
<p>Her head tilted as Noah’s tongue climbed from her nether lips upwards to licked her swollen little nub. Noah pulled her pelvis as she tried to pull herself back. She bit her lip as he sucked on her even faster. She bit so hard that her lips bled.</p>
<p>When all of her insides were drained from climaxing, Adele covered her mouth with her hand and collapsed on the bed. Noah removed his face from her lady part and wiped his lips with his palm.</p>
<p>“You get wet so easily.”</p>
<p>She was too engrossed in the pleasure to respond to his words.</p>
<p>“Good job at enduring it.”</p>
<p>Noah took off the clothing he was wearing. Then his enraged member was erect, fiercely directed towards the sky. Adele knew how that gigantic thing wreaked havoc inside her body and how it hurt her, but she didn’t know how it tastes like.</p>
<p>“It’s quite unfair that you’re enjoying the pleasure all by yourself.”</p>
<p>Instead of using words, Noah pointed to his own cock with his chin. Adele, nervous about his large and thick member, swallowed her saliva. Feeling frustrated, he grabbed her face, and her lips touched the tip of his engorged appendage.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Adele bit her lip. Noticing that he was telling her s*ck him… She did not want to do it.</p>
<p>She gently raised her head to see Noah’s unfazed expression and frowned. She grabbed it with her trembling hands. It was the first time she had a man’s gen!tals this close to her face. She stuck out her tongue and licked cautiously.</p>
<p><em>Lick, lick.</em></p>
<p>Adele’s skills in the bedroom were relatively poor, as shown by her inexperienced tongue making tentative movements towards his member.</p>
<p>But it was enough for Noah to rekindle his appetite. He glanced at her.</p>
<p>A trembling body and swollen bre@sts with erect n!pples, plump stomach and thighs that was fascinating to fondle with, those little sensitive spots of her lower lips that easily gets wet when he toyed with them…</p>
<p><em>Everything…</em></p>
<p>Noah narrowed his eyes dangerously and lifted her leg.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The woman who was quietly lying down opened her eyes widely in surprise. With one leg lifted, Noah grinned and looked at those soaked regions between her legs.</p>
<p>It was sopping wet as the sticky juices kept on flowing out of it. Her face was red, and she tried to cover it with her hands, but it was of no use. He quickly grabbed Adele’s wrist and used his other hand to spread her nether lips apart.</p>
<p>“See? It’s all wet.” It was such as enticing sight, exciting him to no end.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You must be begging me to enter you, right?”</p>
<p>Before Adele was able to deny, Noah plunged inside of her without warning. She could only open her mouth in wonder as Noah’s slammed into her repeatedly.</p>
<p><em>Glug, glug, glug!</em></p>
<p>Erot!c noises and slopping sounds ensued inside the bedroom.</p>
<p>Noah submerged himself into her wetness that had been aroused with the cunnilingus earlier. Adele closed her eyes at the feeling of him digging inside of her and at the same time, letting pleasure spread throughout her body.</p>
<p>“Open your eyes.”</p>
