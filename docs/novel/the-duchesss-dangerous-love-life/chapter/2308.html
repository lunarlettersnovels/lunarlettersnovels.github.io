            <p><b>Chapter 49</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhm, Your Majesty, I don’t think…” the servant was still hesitating when he finally built up the courage to say the words, “Your Majesty, with all due respect, I know that you have good eyesight when it comes to these kinds of things. But the color of this stone is too gaudy, I’m afraid she wouldn’t like it very much when she receives it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, the emperor picked up a dagger the length of the palm of his hand. The scabbard was studded with gems from rubies to diamonds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t matter if she’s a lady, the world is full of evil creatures these days. A gift like this isn’t too bad either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty!” The servant couldn’t keep up with what he was saying and his body shuddered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a self-defense product owned by the deceased queen that was only put on display and never used because she cherished it too much! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the emperor was unaware of the inner turmoil of the person beside him. He was too busy finding bigger and shinier diamonds to give to the duchess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poor servant mustered up the strength to open his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-Your Majesty, I think this is too much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He breathed in deeply, “Your Majesty, I am aware that the princess made a grave mistake, but you can’t just… give out… national treasures…” his voiced turned meeker until it could barely be even heard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm.” The emperor put the dagger down. “This is a gift for my first love, I want it to be special.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pitiful servant stared on blankly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One that would express a man’s sincerity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor smiled fondly. Right now, he looked nothing more than young man who had recently fallen into the abyss called love. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was strange. He was obviously a 26-year-old adult and a dignified emperor. But now, he just resembled an ordinary man trying to impress his crush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servant just smiled at the hidden, innocent side of the emperor. Perhaps that was why he didn’t say anything regarding the duchess being a married woman. Though, he had to be careful not to spread rumors, he still wanted his head attached to his neck!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then,” he paused “how about this one?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the tip of the servant’s finger was a gold necklace decorated with a 12-carat emerald.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? Isn’t that a necklace studded with magic stones?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servant nodded with renewed vigor, “Yes, yes! It was a gift from the previous emperor when Her Highness was ill, a wish for her to get well soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, that’s right. I remember my mother having it. She had a hard time because of the illness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor carefully picked up the jewelry. The bright and transparent emerald reflected his golden hair and similarly-colored emerald eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope she will be reminded of me whenever she sees this necklace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rayence raised the corners of his lips as he conjured a scene where an emerald necklace identical to his own rested against Adele’s slender neck. Next time, if the chance presents itself, he would gift her some dresses, shoes, and accessories too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, shoes wouldn’t make a good gift. She could run to Noah while wearing those… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smiling expression could not be erased from the emperor’s face, whose thoughts became fully occupied by a certain duchess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He sighed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please forgive me for the atrocities Janice has done.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lady has opened her eyes! Milady, are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sunlight coming through the window overwhelmed Adele’s sense of sight. She tried to speak with Lina who was watching her with a worried expression, but she found that her voice was hoarse, so she closed her mouth again.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happened? I attended the tea party held by the princess, had a conversation with emperor, and I returned in a carriage. Wait, did I return? And the night with him…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lina looked at her confused face and put down the towel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Milady, you had a fever as you were… drugged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Drugged?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, milady. The lord cared for you all night.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-the lord…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele felt a little disheveled and looked down. She saw her naked body with clusters of kiss marks on it, her nipples were sore and swollen, and her lower regions… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She quickly became embarrassed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her ravaged body was exposed in front of her maids!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry, milady. A female doctor came by and looked after you. She said your fever has receded and you’re all better now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lina explained everything from the medicine she had taken to the doctor’s examination to her mistress who stayed quiet throughout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele touched her head, thinking about where the hell she was drugged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were places she suspected, but perhaps, it was ultimately the princess who was behind all this. She groaned as she felt a splitting headache.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Milady, are you all right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have already cleansed your body with a cloth, milady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele’s face quickly turned red. At the same time, her maids bowed their heads to hide their heated cheeks. They weren’t deaf. They could hear the moans coming through the window. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All night long.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele simply handed the cup without saying a word. As she drank the warm water, she blushed as she thought of the events that occurred last night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ha…” She remembered how wild and uninhibited she was last night. Her lustful voice pleading with him to satisfy her carnal desires, his seductive figure promising to impregnate her… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She sucked in a sharp breath. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh my lord, why on earth did I have to get drugged?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele sighed and took the calming medicine that Lina gave her and drank it all in one gulp. She asked, “Where is the lord right now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lord said he had something to do and went out.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as I can remember, we did it until dawn… Isn’t he tired? Where did he go?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele veered her gaze towards the outside of window. Beyond the building, the Imperial Palace could be seen in the distance. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t tell me he…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Adele frowned, Lina held out a letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhm, milady, there is a letter for you. I was supposed to hand it over when you are well, but this doesn’t seem like an ordinary matter.”</span></p>
