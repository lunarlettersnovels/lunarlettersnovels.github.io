            <p><strong>Chapter 83 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Noah moved his waist, rubbing his engorged member against her plump bottoms. Adele gasped loudly at the sensation of her butt being handled roughly by him, but he quickly recaptured her mouth and swept his tongue even deeper.</p>
<p>Out of breath from his fervent kisses, Adele wanted to push him away when Noah caught her hand and began to kiss them instead, running his tongue across each and every one of her slender fingers to their tips.</p>
<p>He bit her palm, which shocked Adele for brief moment.</p>
<p>“Uh!”</p>
<p>“I told you I won’t stop.”</p>
<p>Adele could even hear her own heavy breathing, “I just… need some air.”</p>
<p>Her words slipped by Noah’s ears who decided to pretend as if he heard nothing.</p>
<p>“Spread your legs.”</p>
<p>Adele stared at Noah’s lustful eyes, she obediently spread her legs and wrapped it around his waist.</p>
<p><em>Ah, it has started…</em></p>
<p>She closed her eyes, tightly clinging onto his heated body as she felt a hard object prodding into her entrance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p><em>Splash! Splash! Splash!</em></p>
<p>Water spilled every time Noah moved his lower body, pounding into Adele with extreme intensity that her head became muddled with tingling sensations of pleasure, a lewd expression on her face.</p>
<p>Her breasts bounced up and down from his movements that whenever she arched her back, those luscious peaks would be presented to him in all its glory, driving Noah even crazier that he rammed into her harder than ever.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Ah… ahh!”</p>
<p>Erotic noises continued to flow from her lips and melded together with the sounds of splashing water. She sounded so vulgar that Adele bit her lips in an attempt to restrain her mouth.</p>
<p>But Noah only smirked.</p>
<p><em>Splash!</em></p>
<p><em>Splash!</em></p>
<p>Water sprayed against their bodies, but Adele couldn’t feel any of it. Her mind was too overwhelmed by the dizzying pleasure that wracked her senses.</p>
<p>“P-please, do it gently…”</p>
<p>Noah slowed down his pace without saying a word, different from how he had always done it aggressively. He captured her lips for a deep kiss that went on for an extended amount of time. He slowly and tenderly caressed her body with his tongue, licking every inch of it from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Noah’s eyes focused admiringly on the beauty beneath him, too absorbed in his task to notice anything else as if he couldn’t bear to look away for a single moment.</p>
<p>Even while he was doing that, his member that was inside of her never stopped its movements.</p>
<p>It was another form of delicious torture, different from the past nights where he would usually handle her roughly and aggressively.</p>
<p>He was being so agonizingly slow that Adele felt pleasure in a blissful kind of way, the way his member would fill her up inside so sweetly… But then, she also felt this was driving her to insanity and her eyes were silently begging him to go faster.</p>
<p>Noah’s eyes were filled with mirth—<em>he was teasing her</em>.</p>
<p>“Uh, uh….”</p>
<p>The water that gushed out had this sort of cadence to it and Noah matched his thrusting to the rhythm of it. He touched and played with her breasts, alternating between kneading them hard and rubbing them softly.</p>
<p>Adele peaks were sensitive, she liked the sensation of his hands playing with her chest that her back arched as she moaned. As her pale neck was revealed, Noah began to lick them lightly that caused her toes to curl.</p>
<p>He abruptly bit her thighs that were out of the bathtub.</p>
<p>“Ah! Don’t bite, it hurts…”</p>
<p>He licked it gently and pressed himself inside of her again, moving back and forth without saying a word.</p>
<p>Adele could hear him groan every now and then. The sound sent shivers up to her spine that would cause her nether regions to clench. Noah felt her walls tightening around his penis and it elicited another groan from him.</p>
<p>A dark glint flashed across his eye.</p>
<p>He continued to move so slowly that Adele was drowning in pleasure. She had climaxed so many times form his skillful ministrations that she felt like she’d been to ninth heaven.</p>
<p>The feeling was… <em>so addicting</em>.</p>
<p>“Do… do it again, please.”</p>
<p>“Shh, it’s okay…”</p>
<p>A loving voice entered her ears, she felt his warm breath against her neck. Noah licked her ear and lightly nipped at it. He lifted his hands and fondled her bewitching body.</p>
<p>Adele’s body couldn’t stop itself from trembling in another bout of pleasure.</p>
<p>He wanted to possess her, he was even tempted to hide her and keep her all to himself. But he knew she wouldn’t want that.</p>
<p>Noah’s intense gaze caused Adele’s heart to beat ferociously inside her ribcage. But instead of being aggressive, he showered her with gentle kisses.</p>
<p>He had always been rough and fast-paced, but for her…</p>
<p>“Hoo…”</p>
<p>Noah kissed her watery eyes and nudged his nose against her heated cheeks, savoring her scent and supple skin.</p>
<p>He still wanted more of her. Even though he’s had her, it never felt like it would be enough and he would be left thirsting for more. A primal urge sprang up from within him and he bit her nape, like a bloodsucking creature feasting on its prey.</p>
