            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 7</strong></p>
<p>“My lady, in a little while, it will be your turn to enter.”</p>
<p>Adele, who was looking at the night sky outside the window of the bride’s waiting room, turned her head when the maid spoke in a solemn tone. The time was already approaching midnight.</p>
<p>She sighed as she looked at the white wedding dress she was wearing. She didn’t expect that she would don it twice. As she was squeezing her dress with her pale hands, someone came through the door of her waiting room. Adele saw the incoming person and stood up subconsciously.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty?”</p>
<p>“Bride.” The emperor smiled and waved to Adele.</p>
<p>White skinned and dark blonde hair as if made from pure melted gold, with vivid emerald eyes and red ruby lips; even though he wore a butterfly mask that covered his face, his stunning and beautiful figure was evidently distinct. As this was an unofficial visit, the mask was for also for his safety.</p>
<p>No one expected that he would come this late at night, it was even the time before her remarriage. No invitations were made, this is because it was customary to keep the wedding ceremony brief.</p>
<p>“Thank you for attending, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Your face does not resemble the appearance of a bride.” He commented, noticing her lack of cheer.</p>
<p>“Ah…” Was is that obvious? As to why she looked unwell, wasn’t it because of her husband’s death and that she suddenly had to marry his younger brother?</p>
<p>However, the emperor did not speak about this. He didn’t celebrate either. He only spoke warm words as if he was truly concerned about Adele’s difficult situation.</p>
<p>“I heard that your father was injured and unable to attend. Jim’s attendant had also been shot once, but it was nothing serious and he recovered. Lord Liliand will surely get well soon.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>He glanced at Adele, who gave a bitter smile as she was being consoled. As soon as the king was about to say more, the bridesmaids waiting outside the door opened their mouths. “Bride, it is time.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I would have to depart to the guest seat now.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, thank you for keeping me company.”</p>
<p>The emperor nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders and left the bride’s waiting room. While leaving, he muttered a few meaningful words, “I should have abolished ridiculous laws like this…”</p>
<p>Adele, who couldn’t hear his words clearly, frowned. She tried to ask, but she had to lower her head as her maids arranged her wedding dress. After a while, Adele stood at the starting point of the Virgin Road and looked around the wedding hall. She was getting remarried, therefore, only a few people were present.</p>
<p>There were lower nobles and sidelines who came in order to be viewed favorably by the Duke, there were also knights of the Black Knights, and the Count Arsene couple who had a relationship with her mother-in-law.</p>
<p>That was it. In comparison to a regular wedding, this was really too pitifully few.</p>
<p>As she stood in front of the Virgin Road, she bowed her head and met with his golden eyes.</p>
<p>“Let the bride enter!”</p>
<p>Adele walked alone, without holding anyone’s hand. She felt relieved and fortunate that there were only a few people inside, no one would make any unwanted commotion. However, her legs kept shaking. She was tensed and struggled to walk the entire time. By the time she finally reached the end, she stumbled and lost strength.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Adele closed her eyes, fully aware she was going to fall. But her body did not make contact with the floor; she opened her eyes when she realized she didn’t feel any pain.</p>
<p>A firm and big embrace prevented her fall. When she lifted her head, she saw that Noah, who was hugging her, was staring at her, concerned. When she felt his arms wounded around her waist, she quickly pushed him away.</p>
<p>He smirked and proceeded to take her hand to escort her, hand in hand. Upon arriving in front of the podium, the host began to read the prepared congratulatory speech. Adele glanced at his side profile, then towards his hand that was still holding hers firmly. He turned his head to look at her but she hurriedly avoided his gaze.</p>
<p>Reaching the more pivotal parts of the wedding, the priest then asked the necessary questions.</p>
<p>“Groom, do you swear, to love only the bride forever?”</p>
<p>“I swear.”</p>
<p>‘How could he? Without even a single hesitation!’ Adele couldn’t believe it. It sounded too insincere.</p>
<p>Being completely unable to understand him, she turned her head again. She found that he was already looking at her and they immediately locked gazes with each other. She was held captive by his golden eyes. Because of the serious look on his face, Adele nervously licked her lips.</p>
<p>“Bride, do you swear, to love only the groom forever?”</p>
<p>“I…” Her voice faltered and she lowered her head to avoid his gaze. The face of her deceased ex-husband, Enon, was getting fainter and fainter in her head. A pang of guilt sprung from corner of her heart.</p>
<p>It was when her eyes trembled that Noah grabbed her chin and kissed her without any warning.</p>
