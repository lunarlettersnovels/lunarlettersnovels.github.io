            <p><strong>Chapter 107</strong></p>
<p><em>Ah, yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Bella.</em></p>
<p><em>The woman whom he had a scandal with.</em></p>
<p>She thought that she wouldn’t have to do anything with him after this, but it seems like she was expecting too much. Still, how dense could he be? To let his former fiancée meet with his lover?</p>
<p>Oblivious to Adele’s eyes that gazed at him strangely, he continued speaking. “Well, Bella is suspicious of me, so…”</p>
<p>Adele raised a delicate brow, “Are you insinuating that I tell her we feel nothing for each other?”</p>
<p>He laughed, albeit a little too forced.</p>
<p>“Right, right! It’s not that hard, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>Adele could only let out a sigh at how preposterous he was being.</p>
<p>Is he really so brazen? Or is his head made of water? Adele massaged her temples that suddenly began throbbing with pain.</p>
<p>Daniel glanced at her and cleared his throat. “I know that this request may be a bit difficult for you, but please help me just this once.”</p>
<p>“I refuse.”</p>
<p>He paused, “If you clarify that matter to Lady Bella, I shall convince my father to assist the Lilliand family.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the issue here. This is about my dignity, and I dare not sully my family’s pride by lowering myself just to receive someone else’s help.”</p>
<p>“What dignity and pride? The Lilliand family isn’t all that great…”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Daniel shrugged his shoulders. “The Lilliand family’s title isn’t really that high. If my grandfather hadn’t been entangled with Baron Lilliand, I wouldn’t have been part of this lowly engagement…” Daniel suddenly realized what he just said and waved his hand as if to refute his own words.</p>
<p>Adele’s eyes narrowed, “I knew you were rude, but I didn’t know you would be this shameless.”</p>
<p>Anger suddenly surfaced on her always-amicable face that it threw Daniel into a fluster.</p>
<p>“It’s not like that. What I meant is—”</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, what power do I have to defy the decisions our elders have made?” a mocking smile emerged on Adele’s face, “If you want to break up the engagement, persuade your grandfather first.”</p>
<p>“W-what?”</p>
<p>She chuckled, “What I’m saying, <em>darling</em>, is that I’m not breaking off this engagement.”</p>
<p>Dare to ridicule her family and herself?</p>
<p>She decided to dissolve their engagement as slowly as possible. Adele wanted his <em>lowly</em>, egotistical self to suffer first. Because if she easily agreed to do his bidding, wouldn’t that be letting him off lightly? In any case, their divorce is already set in stone if they ever did marry.</p>
<p>Thinking up to this point, Adele gave him a gracious smile. “Then, I shall take my leave.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Wait! You don’t want to break the engagement?” Daniel glanced at Adele up and down.</p>
<p>Adele glared at him.</p>
<p>He smirked, “I’m sorry, but… I don’t have even a little bit of interest in you.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Adele felt a little bewildered, where was this nonsense coming from?</p>
<p><em>I’m not one bit interested in you too. I thought we’ve already established that?</em></p>
<p>“You know it yourself, you aren’t as beautiful as other ladies. In fact, you look more like a country girl to me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Your body is okay, but your face,” his face contorted in displeasure, “boring, uninteresting and plain—<em>ah! Argh!</em>”</p>
<p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>
<p>Daniel suddenly stumbled backwards.</p>
<p><em>Plop!</em></p>
<p>In an instant, he fell into a deep pond just behind where he stood, currently flailing his arms. It was… an interesting sight to say the least. Quite refreshing too.</p>
<p>However, Adele’s eyes widened when she found the boy standing where Daniel stood before. The boy with a frown on his forehead pressed down on Daniel’s head with a scabbard.</p>
<p>“Stupid bastard.” the boy irritatingly grumbled underneath his breath.</p>
<p>“W-who are you?!”</p>
<p>The boy glanced at Daniel with a cold expression while he groaned and spat out curses. Unperturbed, the boy ignored his words and took her hand.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Adele gave a short glance at her pathetic fiancée and followed after the boy.</p>
<p>Daniel watched her retreating back and moaned painfully.</p>
<p>“Ah! S-save me!”</p>
<p>This idiot.</p>
<p>His feet could probably reach the bottom of the pond if he just calmly stretched his legs. Adele stared at him with contemptuous eyes. “I will never forget today’s rudeness. Whatever misfortune you’ve suffered today or in the future, you can only blame yourself. I hope to never see you again, Sir Daniel.”</p>
<p>“Young lady! Young lady!”</p>
<p>Daniel was still fussing when he realized that his feet were touching the floor, but the two of them had already disappeared.</p>
<p>He practically crawled out of the pond and flopped down, then he let out a few expletives.</p>
<p>“Damn it, that cocky b*tch! To think I even treated her so politely?! I’ll show yo—”</p>
<p><em>Achoo!</em> Daniel sneezed and grinded his teeth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After walking for a few minutes without saying a single word, the boy felt a little gloomy when he remembered Daniel’s words.</p>
<p><em>Why is she not saying anything? Does she really believe the words of an asshole?</em></p>
<p>He who was about to speak when he felt the soft hand in his hold tremble slightly. Looking back, Adele’s eyes were glossy with tears.</p>
<p><em>Damn it! I really don’t know how to comfort someone</em>.</p>
<p>A hesitant expression appeared on his face. Adele could only smile awkwardly.</p>
<p>“I hated that person. Thank you for punishing him for me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But where are we going?” then she remembered something, “Ah! Right, your parents—”</p>
<p>“My hideout.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to my hideout, so follow me.” The boy held her hand tighter and walked ahead.</p>
<p><em>How can the grip of a boy could be this strong? Is it because of that dark power?</em></p>
<p>Adele felt her hands tingle and continued walking. When her legs hurt and she slowed down, he would slow down too. Once a hill came jutting out of view, he went a few steps in front of her and held out his hand.</p>
<p>Adele admired this little man’s chivalrous deeds, “You’d make for a good knight.”</p>
<p>He pursed his lips, “Stop talking and just hold my hand.”</p>
<p>She did as told, and after that, they went up the hill.</p>
