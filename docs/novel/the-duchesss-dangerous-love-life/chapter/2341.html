            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 16</strong></p>
<p>Adele smiled bitterly at the maid’s shy voice. She remembered two years ago, she was just like the maid. Adele looked at her reflection in the water. It was a reflection of when she was thirty years old, and not thirty-two.</p>
<p><em>‘I’m sorry, Adele. I planned to tell you before our wedding but couldn’t find it in me to do so.’</em></p>
<p>It was her first night with Enon.</p>
<p>Adele, who was sitting on the bed in the bedroom, looked at him, who had his head bowed to her with only his underwear on. Impotent, she heard that word for the first time that night. Confused, Adele hesitated to open her mouth.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s because I had a severe disease when I was young…’ Enon had said.</em></p>
<p>‘…’</p>
<p><em>‘I-if you’re disappointed, you can call the wedding off right now!’</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t call it off. How would the society view her if she decided to divorce her husband because of his impotency? Adele shook her head as she remembered her father’s face that was grinning happily with her marriage to the Maktus family. The back of the man who had just become her husband was trembling pitifully.</p>
<p><em>‘I’m okay.’ </em>She eventually responded.</p>
<p><em>‘Truly?’</em></p>
<p>She shrugged, <em>‘It’s not a big problem. I can surely live without… that.’</em></p>
<p>At Adele’s words, Enon hugged her tightly. She smiled awkwardly and gripped the hem of her robe. She expected differently from her first night—a night where her husband would touch and love her. Adele let the hem of her robe go and patted him.</p>
<p><em>Splash!</em></p>
<p>Adele stirred up the water that reminded her of her memories. Then she saw her own body which was filled by last night’s kiss marks.</p>
<p><em>‘So tight… You feel so good. How did you manage live so quietly, dear sister-in-law?’ </em>She recalled Noah’s words from the night they made love.</p>
<p>How could brothers be this different? Adele grab on a flower petal which was floating around her body.</p>
<p><em>‘I shall let you enjoy this kind of pleasure in the future.’</em></p>
<p>As he said, last night was filled with pleasure and tears. It was the first time she felt that way. It was shameful and embarrassing, but it was… good.</p>
<p>Yes, to be completely honest, it was thrilling. It was also true that, as a woman, she was satisfied.</p>
<p>If Noah had been her husband from the beginning, she would have probably been…</p>
<p><em>Been happy as a woman</em>.</p>
<p>Adele massaged her temples. Enon’s face came to mind and her heart became heavy. She’s sorry for the man who was already dead. Shaking her head, she touched her sore vagina with her fingers.</p>
<p>“Ah!” It was swollen. It’s good that it wasn’t torn apart. It was painful at first. The pain slowly went away as the pleasure came. But are men’s pen!ses always that big? Adele shook her head.</p>
<p>No. It was his that was exceptionally big. It was all thanks to Noah’s skill that made her first experience almost painless even with such a large thing. She was certainly grateful about it, especially since she was still a virgin that time.</p>
<p>“But why did he spit out those words?”</p>
<p>Why did he say those shameful things? Adele took a deep breath. People say there is a man who makes a woman cry by saying harsh words in bed. Who would’ve thought Noah was like that? Okay, let’s assume that he’s only like that in bed. Let’s also assume that he… was always like that. However…</p>
<p>“Phew…”</p>
<p>Why did he really decide to marry her? Adele could never understand why. In her opinion, Noah had no reason to marry her.</p>
<p>She knew that it was the law, but everyone was quiet and did not even follow it. The nobles also asked the judges to pretend they didn’t know and just gave them money. Why did he have to do that? It wasn’t like he didn’t have enough money to bribe the judges.</p>
<p><em>Splash!</em></p>
<p>Adele remembered the Maktus family’s ledger that she had seen for the first time two years ago. With the net capital alone, this family had enough money to buy three or four small countries. Now all the money belonged to Noah, who had become head of the state.</p>
<p><em>Splash!</em></p>
<p>Unlike Enon, he was not lacking in anything. Enon became the head of the state at a late age because he couldn’t get a job because of his disease, Noah Maktus was the exact opposite of her late husband.</p>
<p>He was a hero who protected his country for five years on the battlefield and was the knights’ commander, the strongest on the continent. All the women wanted to date him and marry him, that meant he could’ve just picked and married any woman who flocked towards him.</p>
<p>“But why me…”</p>
<p>As Adele was mulling over her thoughts, she heard the voice of her maid.</p>
<p>“Milady, the lord…”</p>
<p>At the maid’s hesitation, Adele urged her, “Say it.”</p>
<p>“The lord has arrived at the castle, and he requests for you.”</p>
<p>Adele bit her lips as she recalled last night’s scene.</p>
<p><em>What should I do?</em></p>
<p>“Find out why.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know why he wanted to meet her all of a sudden, but she didn’t want to see him. Embarrassed and shy, he was someone she wanted to avoid. She thought of doing the same thing too tonight, but she decided to go to sleep early in her private bedroom.</p>
<p><em>I am guessing he won’t wake a sleeping person and talk to her, right? If he asks for me tomorrow, I will just simply say that I am sick.</em></p>
<p>“Yes, milady.”</p>
<p>At the maid’s answer, Adele got up from the bathtub. Her body was red because of the heat, but the kiss marks didn’t go away. She sighed and wiped her body with the cloth on the shelf.</p>
