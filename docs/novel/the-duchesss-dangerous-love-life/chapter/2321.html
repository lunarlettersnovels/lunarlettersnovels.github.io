            <p><strong>Chapter 36</strong></p>
<p>The princess glanced at her gloomy expression and smiled. “Irie, don’t worry too much about Noah. I can testify that he is a strong man, he once saved me from the battlefield before.”</p>
<p>In the most dramatic way plausible, Irie wiped her tears with her handkerchief. “But my heart hurts for him. One year ago, he still looked calm and happy, but now he wears a frown everywhere he goes.”</p>
<p>The young ladies who looked at Irie snorted at her exaggerated behavior. Everyone knew that she was genuinely Noah’s fiancée, at least she was in the past. Still, they scanned Adele up and down.</p>
<p>“Poor Irie. It breaks my heart to see my dear friend in so much pain.” At the princess’s words, the young girls threw words of support to Irie, telling her to cheer up.</p>
<p>To everyone, Irie was indeed Noah’s fiancée, but he had no choice but to marry this hateful Adele.</p>
<p>The woman in the receiving end of all the hatred and disgust, Adele, remained calm in her seat as she watched the teary-eyed Irie. She knew how petty these girls could become. She didn’t like Irie, but on the other hand, there existed a part of her which feels truly sorry for Irie.</p>
<p>Adele didn’t know how much Noah liked Irie, but seeing him give her flowers, it might mean that he had been starting to like her. Besides, it was Adele herself that had chosen a portrait of her when Noah began to meet her.</p>
<p>Adele lifted her head up and called out to her. “Young Lady Irie.”</p>
<p>At Adele’s words, all the young girls looked at her. Irie looked at her with a resentful gaze.</p>
<p>Adele was calm and unfazed. “I am sorry.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“You lost your fiancée because of me.”</p>
<p>No one dared to interrupt Adele’s straightforward words. Even Irie just blinked stupidly.</p>
<p>“Noah did not leave you because he hated you, he married me because of Enon’s will.”</p>
<p>“Will?” The princess became interested at the story and asked Adele, but Adele only looked at Irie.</p>
<p>“The late lord had made a request to Noah. ‘Take care of your sister-in-law while I’m away.’ That became his will.”</p>
<p>Adele clenched her fists in pain as she spoke. But it’s the truth. In this case, it is better to be honest. It’s because she’s had relationships with other ladies who lie to her and bluffs, and she sees honesty as a better solution.</p>
<p>“I know that you missed your marriage while waiting for Noah. If I had not given Noah a portrait of a you in the first place…”</p>
<p>“P-portrait?”</p>
<p>Irie blinked her eyes, trying to understand what Adele meant. Adele nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes. When my parents-in-law were still alive, they told me to choose portraits of young ladies in order to find a match for Noah. At that time, as the eldest daughter-in-law, I chose your portrait.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“In my eyes, I chose you because you looked the prettiest. I didn’t think things would turn out this way. If you don’t mind, I will tell Noah about this and find a good solution for you.”</p>
<p>Adele’s words may be understood as ‘if it wasn’t for me, the two of you wouldn’t have known each other’. But she was sincere.</p>
<p>“As a fellow woman, I am sorry to you, Irie.”</p>
<p>Irie didn’t know what to do with Adele’s direct and calm attitude, then turned her head.</p>
<p><em>I can’t beat her!</em> Irie’s thoughts resounded in the minds of the other young ladies.</p>
<p>Adele was a woman who spoke her mind, fearing nothing of those shallow-minded girls. Some of the ladies were won over and admired her attitude, they covered their smiling mouths with their fans.</p>
<p>“D-don’t worry about me!” Irie shrieked.</p>
<p>But at Adele’s calm attitude, Irie head finally dropped. Adele looked at the lady who was eight years younger than herself with a pitying gaze, it was obvious that she grew up being spoiled by her parents.</p>
<p>She didn’t know how difficult it was for women who lost their marriage. If you weren’t going to get married, you’ll have to take over your parents’ business and become the head of the state, which was very rare and had a lot of legal processes to undergo.</p>
<p>She doubted Irie’s capabilities as she didn’t look like she could handle it.</p>
<p>As Adele clicked her tongue, the princess opened her mouth. “How are you so delicate and kind? It appears that Noah has found himself a good wife.”</p>
<p>She accepted her words with a subtle bow. “It is an honor to hear compliments from you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, not only Noah, but Enon too.”</p>
<p>Adele took a sip of tea instead of answering.</p>
<p>“It is true that Irie is to be pitied, but Madame Maktus must have been very heartbroken. She couldn’t even attend the funeral, and got married right away, imagine how unhappy she must have been.”</p>
<p>The princess began to make Adele a ‘poor woman’. And yet, at the same time, made her a ‘shameless woman’. She wanted to say that even though it was Enon’s will, it was strange to get married without even attending the funeral.</p>
<p>Adele bit her lip in shame and the princess quickly spoke.</p>
<p>“I heard that you have been managing the merchants’ community?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Is it safe from the war?”</p>
<p>Adele looked at her in shame. The princess’s face became unhesitant, confident and arrogant.</p>
<p>Although she was younger than Adele, she grew up in the imperial family. She acted haughtily as she knew that no one could touch her because of her status. “Seeing how you can’t answer, I can assume that you have lost a lot of money?”</p>
<p>What the princess truly meant was, ‘You seduced Noah for money, right?’.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Contrary to how he looks, Noah is a kind person, so he will surely help you ‘more’ in the future. Just like how he saved me from the battlefield.”</p>
<p>Adele, who felt insulted by the princess’ words, clenched her fists. She wanted to leave her seat right this moment.</p>
<p>“How can you say such harsh things to your guest? You’re being rude, Janice.” A soft, low-pitched voice was heard. When she raised her head, a man with brilliant golden hair was smiling with his eyes closed. All the women sitting at the table rose up to greet him.</p>
<p>“Greetings to the Sun of this empire.”</p>
