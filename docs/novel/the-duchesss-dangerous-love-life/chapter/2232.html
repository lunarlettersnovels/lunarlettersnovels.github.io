            <p><strong>Chapter 125</strong></p>
<p>Adele immediately became shy because of her words. She could only face Selena with a furiously blushing face.</p>
<p>“Umm… in sleeping together with your partner… It is inevitable that the two of you may desire something different. But from my experience, one thing is almost always true. That is, the desire of your spouse would usually be greater than that of yours. In that case…”</p>
<p>“…in that case what?” The ladies themselves were unaware that they adjusted their seats in order to be closer to her.</p>
<p>“You must insist on a certain day of the week.” Adele uttered as she had a stubborn look on her face, “Otherwise, you would be sore every morning.”</p>
<p>One lady had a thoughtful expression on her face. “But what if he still insists on doing it? Should I pretend to be asleep then?”</p>
<p>“No, don’t!” Adele hurriedly answered. “M-men are like beasts that he might actually do it even if you are asleep. For me, I just hold his hand to comfort him and then let him accompany me to sleep.”</p>
<p>Adele remembered Noah appeared quite pitiful back then too. His member was raging hard, but she was coaxing him to sleep instead. It truly was a laughable situation.</p>
<p>Selena was still listening to the duchess’s explanation, but the other ladies were already chirping in their hearts and rejoicing.</p>
<p>That callous Duke of Maktus who coldly treated other women like air, adores his wife so much that he’s turned on just by the sight of his sleeping wife? What’s even better, he was actually denied action in bed by the very same woman?</p>
<p>The ladies hastily covered their faces with fans.</p>
<p><em>Oh my lord—!</em></p>
<p>Feeling that the atmosphere took a somewhat peculiar turn, Selena continued to ask about things she was still curious about. “Duchess Maktus, what if… W-what if your spouse asks you for more?”</p>
<p><em>Wonderful question, Selena!</em></p>
<p>The ladies applauded inwardly and expressed their great gratitude to the young miss with their eyes, who spoke on behalf of what they were curious about. But Selena was oblivious to the meaning in their gazes.</p>
<p>Similarly, Adele also could not understand. She then proceeded to speak in a low voice with a red face.</p>
<p>“Since the young miss is getting married now, I think it is only correct to ask. My advice would be, you shouldn’t force yourself to continue simply for his sake, especially if you are uncomfortable with anything. You can also do this by making a compromise in advance, just in case.”</p>
<p>“A compromise?”</p>
<p>“Err—yes.” Adele nodded her head slightly, “Something like… how I would tell my husband to do it only three times for today and not keep me up all night long again.”</p>
<p>At this point, Adele was utterly unaware of the huge gap between her husband’s and the other ladies’ husbands’ performance in bed. She simply assumed all men were like Noah.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other women’s thoughts were in disarray.</p>
<p>Only three times,<em> for tonight</em>?</p>
<p>He could still go on further?!</p>
<p><em>All night long—?!</em></p>
<p>The ladies suddenly remembered when Noah took off his upper clothes while training during their academy days because of the scorching heat. The sight that greeted them was truly something to marvel at.</p>
<p>Toned and powerful-looking muscles, broad shoulders, a tapered waist, and thick long legs…</p>
<p><em>Ah!</em></p>
<p>The ladies almost drooled at the thought. They lamented at their own misfortune as they thought of their husbands who couldn’t do their job properly. Then, they unwittingly looked at Adele with grim expressions.</p>
<p>The hairs on Adele’s back stood as she felt their gaze and she bowed her head in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Countess Arsene quickly saved her from the situation, “Stop teasing her. The Duchess isn’t used to speaking out.”</p>
<p>“But we didn’t say a word?”</p>
<p>“Your eyes speak volumes.” the countess retorted.</p>
<p>One lady answered with a teasing tone, “But you have to admit, listening to the Duchess’s accounts is very… interesting to say the least.”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded their heads in agreement.</p>
<p>The more they did this, the more Adele’s face resembled a ripened tomato.</p>
<p>Watching her reaction, the Countess Arsene remembered Noah, a man who seemed to have neither blood nor tears, had actually managed to fall in love.</p>
<p>Looking back to when Adele had just arrived at this location, there was a suspicious red mark on her neck as she lightly gasped for breath while apologizing for her tardiness. Of course, it was quickly forgotten as soon as she organized her dress.</p>
<p>The Countess of Arsene realized that the duchess’s marital relationship was not only good, but also extremely hot and passionate.</p>
<p>She smiled and set down her teacup, saying, “It seems that everyone has been given permission to attend our night teatime. Was there anyone who ran into any form of trouble?”</p>
<p>“It’s our fifth year of marriage. Now that they’ve seen everything, they would only tell you to be careful of what you say.” Adele pouted a little.</p>
<p>She felt indignant at that insufferable man.</p>
<p>Originally, she always had to seek permission from Noah if she left late at night for either private or public work regardless if she was only accompanied by females. Her security was always tight since the night held hidden dangers, so she had to be extra careful.</p>
<p>Naturally, Noah wouldn’t risk the safety of his darling wife once he agreed. Aside from her current guards, he had definitely sent hidden guards around here somewhere…</p>
<p>“Pfft!”</p>
<p>A lady burst out laughing, “Madam Maktus, as have I. As time goes by, they would slack and their attention towards you would become lax. You can freely leave your castle then!”</p>
<p>“Oh my, me too!” another one chimed in, “But don’t be too prejudiced against him, lest you let the young Lady Selena have second thoughts about marrying!”</p>
