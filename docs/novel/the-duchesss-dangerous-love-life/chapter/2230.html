            <p><strong>Chapter 127</strong></p>
<p>“But of course, it must be done in moderation during the perfect timing. Afterwards, your husband would be like putty in your hands. Furthermore, the Marquis is younger than you, so I assume you would have a far easier time to achieve this.”</p>
<p>The women least expected that the dignified Countess Arsene, who was always stubborn and obstinate, would say something like this.</p>
<p>She was the woman who could transform an absolute fool into a respectable count of a noble family. Even her two sons, who had ferocious temperaments just like their father, were as meek as a mouse in front of her.</p>
<p>Just a single raise of the countess’s eyebrow was enough to silence the men in her family into submission.</p>
<p>“Young Lady, a short piece of advice. When the Marquis did something good, you should stroke his hair.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“A man likes to be recognized for his deeds as well, especially by his wife. By stroking his hair, you are giving him a sense of comfort, bonding with him in the process, and treating him as a man despite his age.”</p>
<p>Putting down her teacup, the countess eyed the ladies’ eager expressions.</p>
<p>“Then, it’ll only be a matter of time before he clings to each and every word you say and does your bidding.” an imperceptible smirk crossed her face for a split second before it quickly disappeared. “Those with younger husbands here, why don’t you give it a try?”</p>
<p>Countess Arsene gave a cursory glance towards Adele.</p>
<p>Sensing her meaning, Adele’s eyes widened and soon agreed with her statement. She truly couldn’t have imagined Noah clinging to herself, acting like a ‘young man’. Instead, he was the one who had always treated her like a child.</p>
<p>Of course she knows he loves her and it was also his way of showing affection, but… there were times when she once wanted to take control.</p>
<p><em>Especially in bed.</em></p>
<p>It’s just that, she was only smaller and Noah was the one who was… more adept.</p>
<p>Speak of the devil, and the devil shall appear. When Adele tried to ask a question to the Countess of Arsene, a maid hastily knocked on their door and entered.</p>
<p>“Madam! Duke Maktus has visited!”</p>
<p><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>“What do you mean the duke has visited? <em>At this hour?</em>”</p>
<p>The maid hesitated, “Well, the duke said he… came to pick up his wife…”</p>
<p>At the maid’s words, everyone collectively looked at Adele.</p>
<p>When Noah sauntered into the reception room with big strides, Adele jumped, still feeling confused. Selena was at the duke’s visit anyway, so she quickly got up and ordered her maid to guide him.</p>
<p>Noah, clad in a navy blue uniform, fluttered his coat and approached the open door. His stoic yet dignified appearance entered the eyes of the women present and they immediately blushed.</p>
<p>Noah took off his hat and bowed his head in greeting. “Apologies for the interruption, ladies.”</p>
<p>“Oh… <em>Oh!</em>”</p>
<p>When the soon-to-be-wedded Lady Selena saw Noah, her face blushed involuntarily as she shook her head. “No worries, milord. You weren’t interrupting anything!”</p>
<p>Noah dipped his head lightly in acknowledgment. “On the way home, I recalled that my wife was just around the vicinity. Therefore, I took it upon myself to come and go home together with her. I hope the ladies do not mind if I steal my wife for now?”</p>
<p>Was it time for her to go home already? The night teatime ended at midnight at the earliest and at 2 am at the latest. Glancing at the clock hanging by a nearby wall, it was only 11 pm.</p>
<p>Still too early.</p>
<p>Adele groaned at his words and began walking towards him. During this time, she could feel his hot gaze on her.</p>
<p>Adele bit her lip.</p>
<p>She might be seen as a passive woman if she simply followed like an obedient housewife. She didn’t want to appear like a coward to the young lady who has yet to be married.</p>
<p>Therefore, she said to him with a determined expression, “Your watch must be broken, dear. It’s still too early. You should go first, our dialogue isn’t over yet.”</p>
<p>“Why? Are you even enjoying it?” he answered monotonously.</p>
<p>She wasn’t.</p>
<p>To be honest, she had never really been close with any noble-bred ladies. When her husband saved the country seven years ago, she needed to establish herself as a duchess. Which is why she needed to further socialize with other people befitting of her status.</p>
<p>However, all those conversations only ever amounted to polite and shallow talk. There truly wasn’t an opportunity to be able to genuinely connect with those high-status women. There were some who tried to worm their way into her circle, but it was obvious at first glance that they were simply after the benefits of being associated with her.</p>
<p>After it being repeated on several occasions, Adele grew tired of all those same troublesome people, so she laid low.</p>
<p>This time however, she truly couldn’t refuse because it was the countess who had invited her. And she also wanted to interact with others too.</p>
<p>Putting on a bright smile, she said in reply, “Of course, I am enjoying myself here.”</p>
<p>“My wife is so cruel.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“She’s having fun without my presence. I, on the other hand, feel so lonely and miserable without her.”</p>
<p><em>Kiss!</em></p>
<p>Noah took Adele’s hand, bowed his head, and kissed the back of her white hand. Then he lifted his head and looked up at her, whose somewhat determined expression still remained. “Even your heart is unfazed, truly a cruel woman.”</p>
<p>“Oh, stop joking.”</p>
<p>“But I came over as soon as we finished training. Come home with me.” he gently coaxed.</p>
<p>Adele pursed her lips.</p>
<p>“I told you, go back home without me.”</p>
<p>A contemplative look crossed his handsome face. “I agree.”</p>
<p>Adele almost breathed out a sigh of relief, when she heard his next words.</p>
<p>“But on one condition.” Noah tugged at her and whispered in her ear, although it was still loud enough for everyone else to hear, “Kiss me.”</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>“Only then, will I leave.” a smirk made its way onto his face.</p>
<p>“You—<em>really</em>!”</p>
<p>Adele habitually clenched her fists and pounded his chest. After being satisfied with her ‘pummeling’, she lowered her hand. But the women in the waiting room had incredibly amused expressions at their little exchange that they couldn’t prevent themselves from grinning.</p>
<p>Then, they realized they’ve forgotten the basic etiquette of covering their faces with a fan. Hence, when the countess set her stern gaze on them, they shrunk their necks as a poor attempt at hiding.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Adele remembered the countess’s earlier words and decided to apply what she’d heard. Folding her arms, she tried to appear more imposing, “Is that so? Although, you seem to have forgotten something.”</p>
<p>Noah furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You are six years younger than me.”</p>
<p>Noah looked lovingly at Adele, who crossed her arms and tried to look at him sternly. “And so?”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, young man. I should’ve been more considerate of your immaturity. As your senior, it is my duty to guide you down the right path. Hence, I have decided, let us go back to the castle!”</p>
<p>“Pfffft.”</p>
<p>Noah let out a small laugh at her and glanced over at the other women in the room. She must’ve heard some strange advice for her to say these strange words.</p>
<p>He, nonetheless, raised the corners of his mouth and decided to play along.</p>
<p>“Okay, wife. Take ‘good care of me’ when we get back home, alright?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
