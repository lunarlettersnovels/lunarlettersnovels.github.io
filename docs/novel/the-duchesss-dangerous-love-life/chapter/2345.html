            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 12 – (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Noah stopped thrusting into her waist and climaxed, spurring hot s3men into the depths of her core, then he gently pulled out his appendage. A white, sticky substance started drizzling out of her. He glanced at it, then lifted his head and peered at her lying figure.</p>
<p>Rich light brown hair and white skin that easily flushes red, light brown eyes glistening with tears with a tall nose and pink lips, an adorably plump belly with a voluptuous bre@st…</p>
<p>Seeing her thighs dripping with his seed, Noah throat became dry.</p>
<p>“Now, I own all these.” He was talking to her, but it also felt like he was talking to himself.</p>
<p>Her still muddled mind couldn’t process his words, “What?”</p>
<p>“This face, this body, these breasts and thighs—everything is mine now.”</p>
<p>Adele couldn’t figure out what the hell he was talking about. She cried out again as she remembered the shame she was trying to ignore.</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>Ashamed that the deed was committed by her husband’s younger brother. Ashamed that she also felt the pleasure of being a woman for the first time. She didn’t know what to do, so she wept. She shook her head as if she could stop Noah’s advances.</p>
<p>“We only did it twice and you’re already crying.”</p>
<p>When Adele shook her head instead of answering, he raised an eyebrow. “Are you tired?”</p>
<p>She nodded, asking him to stop. Noah caressed her intimate area. “But it’s asking me to enter again.” He shamelessly declared.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? No, stop!”</p>
<p>“But I’m not done yet.” He wasn’t hearing any of her pleas. “Put your legs around my waist and lift your butt.”</p>
<p>Adele furiously shook her head.</p>
<p>“Wife, didn’t you hear me?”</p>
<p>Adele felt at a loss with him calling her ‘wife’ instead of ‘sister-in-law’, but Noah only smiled. “You must obey your husband. Hm?”</p>
<p>“Please stop. I beg of you.”</p>
<p>Noah smiled sweetly and grabbed Adele’s hipbone and pulled her closer. As she shook her head and clasped her legs, he thought for a moment and then lied down next to her. She finally turned her back, relieved. Noah wiped Adele’s white back with his hand as she twisted her gaze away from him.</p>
<p>“I have served you pleasantly. Don’t turn your back on me.”</p>
<p>As she was heaving, Adele paused and blinked at his words. Then her body was turned by his big hands.</p>
<p>She was stunned and remained deathly still as she looked at Noah.</p>
<p>He smiled in contentment as he ran his hands all over her body. Adele lowered her head in embarrassment at the thought of the pleasure he gave her. She felt insane, after her husband’s death, she married his brother and had s*x for the first time.</p>
<p>Adele wanted to end this situation quickly so shook her head when she realized Noah’s genitalia was still standing up.</p>
<p><em>‘Gosh, he’s still…</em>’</p>
<p>When Adele was startled, he calmly opened his mouth…</p>
<p>“Well, we still have tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Noah’s lips lightly grazed Adele’s forehead. His face somehow kind, he was usually not this kind of person. When she thought of Noah, she would always associate it with someone who was always cold with an expressionless face. Unable to match the man in her mind to the man in front of her, Adele quickly closed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Are you tired?”</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p>“You’re pretending to sleep.”</p>
<p>When Noah’s lips touched her cheek, Adele bit her lips, thinking of it being next. Then she heard him chuckle. “Okay, I’ll stop.”</p>
<p>At his tender voice, her heart was finally at ease.</p>
<p>A warm blanket covered her naked body. The lights were turned off and her eyes relaxed as he placed his thick arms around her. Tired, Adele felt the warmth of his firm embrace and quickly fell asleep.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a morning where the sun was shining brightly. The fields were lined with evergreen plants and was exceptionally exquisite. However, the low-ranked nobles that were present have no care for such a wonderful scenery at all. They were sitting there with ropes tied around their bodies, visibly quaking as they watched the scenery unfold before their eyes.</p>
<p><em>Splash!</em></p>
<p>Blood splattered as Noah’s sword cut off the head of a nobleman. Strangely, not a single drop of red stained his sword. Instead, a few blotches tainted his cheeks as the viscous liquid slowly dripped towards the ground.</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>At his words, the knight standing behind him brought him a list. The nobles wailed.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, please! Spare our lives!”</p>
<p>“We only thought about the safety of our household!”</p>
<p>At their pathetic words, Noah smiled smugly. “Receiving fifty-five percent of tax from commoners and receiving ten thousand from my castle? Was it for the reason of fixing the waterways? Or…” he drew out the last word, “Was it to build your own castle?”</p>
<p>The noblemen were agitated and tried to give more excuses, but Noah shut their mouths. He swung his sword lightly while scanning the papers in his hand. The blood spattered on the papers and he crumpled it in irritation.</p>
<p>“What a mess.”</p>
<p>The lower nobles belonging to the Duke Maktus lived within the duke’s territory. Their job was to manage their own territories.</p>
<p>They pay the taxes received from the commoners to the Duke and use it to apply for subsidies to manage the territory. Noah looked at the signature of the grantee at the bottom of the document.</p>
<p>“Sebastian.”</p>
<p>Hearing his call, a middle-aged man with dull blonde hair, Sebastian, strode forward. He was in charge of the duke’s finances.</p>
<p>“Yes, sire.”</p>
<p>“Are all these documents signed by the late master?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sire.”</p>
<p>“Even these trashy ones?”</p>
<p>When applying for a subsidy, documents stating the purpose of the subsidy must be submitted. It was quite easy to calculate and input detailed information to fill out those forms. It was a process one should undergo if they wanted to utilize the taxes to gain subsidy</p>
<p>But the purpose of the documents in his hands were only roughly outlined, far from the required detailed description of their plans.</p>
<p>Sebastian lowered his head at Noah’s frightening eyes.</p>
<p>“As expected, he must have acted like a dog since he thought he was the highest-ranking tier of the state.”</p>
<p>At Noah’s harsh words, Sebastian refrained from nodding his head. His words were harsh, but they were all correct.</p>
<p>The former head of the state, Enon, couldn’t do his duties well because of his illness.</p>
