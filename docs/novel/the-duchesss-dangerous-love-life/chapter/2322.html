            <p><strong>Chapter 35</strong></p>
<p>After the announcement, the women took to their designated seats.</p>
<p>Adele also hurriedly went to her reserved seat and sat down. Soon, a regal figure walked through the door. Her wavy blue hair and a tiara studded with red gems attracted the attention of many.</p>
<p>From head to toe, she looked elegantly exquisite and gorgeous with her porcelain-like skin giving off a glossy sheen. Her gait was slow, and the gaze she used to look down at the noble ladies was lofty. Those cold eyes shifted to Adele.</p>
<p>“A pleasure to be acquainted with you all.” The princess sat down and greeted them. The young ladies quickly took their chance to speak with her.</p>
<p>“Princess! Is it true that Rosa Canaria’s chief designer made a dress that was inspired by you?”</p>
<p>Rosa Canaria was the most famous boutique in the Astrian Empire. The princess answered with a small smile.</p>
<p>“I did not want to say this initially, but I have to say, she does make good clothes.” She uttered, in silent agreement with what they said.</p>
<p>They immediately fawned over her, inwardly envious, “I can’t imagine how pretty it would be!”</p>
<p>Adele saw the girls flattering the princess and thought they were all still young. Come to think of it, why was she still seated among the young ladies? She was already past her thirties.</p>
<p>As she turned her head in embarrassment, she saw ladies of her age sitting at the table across her.</p>
<p>Among them were ladies with whom she had conversed with, such as Countess Arsene. She couldn’t figure out why the princess had assigned her seat this way. Adele put the teacup down without saying a word, feeling something ominous looming over her. Meanwhile, the young ladies kept on chirping with Risetta teacups in their hands.</p>
<p>“Princess, I wonder if the clothes you’re wearing today were made by the Canaria designer?”</p>
<p>The princess beamed, “As expected from Young Lady Tare, you have good eyes. You are correct, this had truly come from her.”</p>
<p>Lady Tare giggled, “It is my pleasure, princess.”</p>
<p>Adele stopped trying to figure out the age difference between her and the young ladies, including the princess. She just drank the tea quietly, but it seems that others became overly interested with her.</p>
<p>“Oh my, Lady Maktus? I heard you have gotten married twice.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Somehow…”</p>
<p>As Adele mumbled, the young ladies looked at her scornfully. As she caught their gaze, a headache came. She didn’t want this to happen.</p>
<p>Adele looked at the young lady who asked her. “Recently graduating from the academy, and currently meddling with other people’s personal matters. You truly have a lot of free time. Have you even found work yet?”</p>
<p>After graduating from the academy and still not getting hired, it meant that she was useless and that she was equally interested in useless things. The young lady who asked her that question, had her face turned red in embarrassment and bowed her head.</p>
<p>Another young lady opened her mouth this time. “How does it feel after getting married twice? I haven’t got married before, so I don’t know well.”</p>
<p>“You’ll know of it once you’ve become my age.” Then she mumbled to herself, “How inauspicious, already cursing your first husband to die to know what it’s like to marry twice?”</p>
<p>What Adele intended from her words was to tell the young lady that she was still young and doesn’t understand much about the society. The young lady, who had just spoken up, bit her lip.</p>
<p>Adele put down her teacup gracefully.</p>
<p>No matter how little she attended tea or official parties, it was easy to deal with these young, pampered ladies. She had already dealt with merchant wives who were more stubborn and selfish than this.</p>
<p>Adele looked at the young ladies and smiled. They quickly averted their eyes, feeling like they had lost to her. They felt like the youngest sister fighting against her eldest sister.</p>
<p>However, the worse was about to happen, for one of the ladies seated around Adele’s table was none other than Irie, Noah’s ex-fiance.</p>
<p>Adele couldn’t possibly ignore the glares the young lady threw her way. She put down her teacup hard as Irie made her thoughts known.</p>
<p>“Noah is going to the northwest region this time, right?” Irie asked her.</p>
<p>They haven’t conversed these days, so she didn’t know about this. As Adele’s complexion darkened slightly, Irie’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“It is said that Noah had been training hard for half a year because of how fiercely the barbarians and monsters attacked in the northwest region. Recently, a lot of unfortunate things happened, but he still decided to go there.”</p>
<p>What Irie meant by ‘unfortunate’ was not Enon’s death, but her marriage to Noah.</p>
<p>“I was worried, but I didn’t contact him. Noah is in charge of Astria’s army so I was afraid that I might disturb him. As his colleague and fiancée, I can only pray every night for his well-being.”</p>
<p>Adele didn’t know everything about Noah, but she was well aware that he was a hero who saved the country. The head of a ducal family with as much power as the imperial family in this empire. He was a man with a bright future ahead.</p>
<p>He was also man who was six years younger than her.</p>
<p><em>He married me, a woman at the age that should’ve had at least two children.</em> Adele sighed.</p>
