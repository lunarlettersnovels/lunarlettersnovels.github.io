            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>
<p><em>*Please reread the last parts of Chapter 1 (conversation between the two brothers) as there were sentences skipped. </em></p>
<p>“Noah!”</p>
<p>Noah turned his head towards Enon – his much smaller built, older brother – calling him with a stern look on his face, “You know the reason why I’m calling you right?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>
<p>“What an honest kid you are.” Enon held Noah’s hand. He didn’t care that it was covered in blood. “You should’ve known about this. I’m going to board a ship heading to Telen. It will be about a two-month journey,” Enon informed him. “I’ll leave this castle and my wife, for you to care for.”</p>
<p>Noah couldn’t remove his hands from Enon after hearing his sincere plea. “The servants of our household know their place, but the merchants may look down on your sister-in-law, as a woman who does internal affairs,” he continued. “But it’ll be different if you are here. Those arrogant jerks won’t stand up to you. Also….”</p>
<p>Enon’s words faded, and he struggled to open his mouth again but was finally able to say, “I could also die while sailing. I know that’s unlikely to happen, but if anything does happen, I’m asking for you to be responsible and take good care of the castle and your sister-in-law. It’s my plea.”</p>
<p>Noah turned his head, hearing his brother’s serious request. At the end of his gaze was Adele having a conversation and laughing with other women. He raised his lips and spoke in a low voice, “Of course, brother.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, that makes me feel at ease,” he said, sighing in relief. “I’m thinking of stopping by the island you told me about the other day. How did you know that there was a mine on the island?”</p>
<p>“I found it by chance while searching for a way to attack the enemy.”</p>
<p>“I thought you didn’t care for our household affairs?” Enon stared at Noah, impressed. But Noah never answered his question.</p>
<p>His little brother had always been hard to predict. He had been bedridden his entire childhood due to an illness. Noah had had an awkward relationship with Enon though because he’d entered the academy dorm early. But after their parents had passed away, they’d started engaging more with each other. He spoiled him now whenever he returned to the palace, and Noah would be happy and excited, thinking of it as a reward. Enon felt the tip of his nose watering up, and spoke while rubbing it, “Anyway, thank you for telling me about the mine.”</p>
<p>A sailor waved his hand from afar, “We need to depart now!”</p>
<p>“I need to go now. Please get closer to your sister-in-law while I’m away.”</p>
<p>Noah raised his eyebrows hearing Enon’s words, “How?”</p>
<p>“By having a meal together or go for a walk together and have a conversation. Anyway, be good to her. She can’t stop living her life as a woman because of being married to me.”</p>
<p>Enon looked at Adele with guilt-filled eyes. The sailor waved his hands again, and Enon hurriedly moved his feet and said, “Stay well!”</p>
<p>“Enon.” Enon looked backed at Noah who called him. “Do you love my sister-in-law?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Is that even worth asking?”</p>
<p>Enon smiled and hurriedly ran to the entrance. Adele who was already waiting there waved her white embroidered handkerchief at him and Noah looked sadly back at them, holding the handle of his sword, but left it in its holster.</p>
<p>“So he said he loved her.” No one heard his words and Noah smiled smugly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It had been two weeks since the owner of the peacock garden had left. Meanwhile, rosebuds were blooming in the beautiful garden, sprouting liveliness on the old wall brick wall. Looking through the window from the second floor, Adele smiled as she felt the freshness that early summer brought.</p>
<p>“Lady, your breakfast is ready. You can go down when you are dressed.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Adele answered with a kind voice as she sat in front of her dressing table. Drying her hair that had been washed by the maids, she slowly started to dress. An auburn-haired girl, named Lina, said excitedly while brushing Adele’s hair, “Lady! There’s a new rose tea coming in today! I tasted some and it was delicious!”</p>
<p>“Is that true? Well, I’ll be expecting some then.”</p>
<p>Lina blinked her eyes hearing Adele’s gentle voice. Her answer sounded indifferent for someone who loved drinking tea.</p>
<p>“Lady, are you sad that the Master is away?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“You look disheartened.”</p>
<p>The other maids nodded their heads in agreement. Adele was about to answer that it was because she had a lot to attend to, but her thoughts were interrupted by a rough voice from outside, “Pay loyalty to the Black Knight commander!” It was the knights’ thunderous pledge of loyalty.</p>
<p>The maids stopped what they were doing, as they were also surprised and Adele sighed heavily, “So he’s still at the castle then.” She said out loud by accident.</p>
<p>“Pardon?” One of the maids asked.</p>
<p>“Are you finished dressing the lady?” The knight asked.</p>
<p>“Almost, we’ll hurry up,” replied one of the maids, feeling flushed.</p>
<p>The maids moved their hands diligently as Adele signed that she didn’t want to talk anymore. They quickly opened the bedroom door once they’d finished dressing her.</p>
<p>Adele frowned and walked down the stairs, noticing that the first floor was busy, which was usual.</p>
<p>In the middle of the hall, Noah was sitting in front of the long wooden table which had a delicious spread of all kinds of food, from fresh salads to seafood. He lifted his head when he heard footsteps entering the dining hall. Not knowing how to act when their eyes met, she smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Are you having your meal here today?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she answered shyly.</p>
<p>“Please sit,” he invited her.</p>
