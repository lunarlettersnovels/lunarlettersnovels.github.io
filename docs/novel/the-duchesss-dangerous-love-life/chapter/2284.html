            <p><b>Chapter 73</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele didn’t realize his presence even though he was already this close to her! Embarrassed, she tried to get up to run away, but his large hand pressed down on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shh. Someone might hear us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah climbed onto the sofa and kissed her hard, greedily lapping at her lips like a man starved. As his tongue intertwined with hers, Adele moaned and grabbed his shoulders. Noah clasped her hands into his, he licked her tongue through her dainty mouth and parted his lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Adele gasping for air, eyes glossy with lu$t, he felt himself hardening at the view. He wanted nothing more than to f*ck her senseless, but he had to be patient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He rubbed his half-erected member against her creamy white legs. “Do it again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He took her hand that touched her womanhood and used mouth to gently nip at the tip of her finger. It was a simple action, but it was so sensual that she unintentionally clenched her genitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He guided her hand towards her groin, “Hurry, don’t make me go crazy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rays of moonlight cascaded down his towering figure. Like a beast getting ready to taste its prey, he licked his lips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His aura was so alluring that Adele meekly placed her trembling hand in that place that was already wet from desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She rubbed her fingers gently over her clothes, but there wasn’t enough strength in her fingers. Her toes curled and he grabbed her feet to rub them against his genitals. Adele’s body jerked at the strange sensation. On the other hand, Noah calmly raised his brows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know you’re craving for it.” Noah leaned down, his husky voice whispered on her reddened ear, “I can give you however much you want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You like that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele was afraid of being embarrassed and immediately injected more force into her hands as she rubbed her labia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah reveled at the scene unfolding before his very eyes, his face gradually began to show traces of euphoria. Adele, on the other hand, was unable to get out of the swamp of pleasure she was feeling, eyes dripping with physiological tears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being watched by someone as she touched herself was so erotic, she felt even more aroused than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She groaned in ecstasy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rub it harder, like this.” He rubbed his genitals heatedly against the sole of her small foot. Adele rubbed her fingers hard against her clitoris to his rhythm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah, outfitted in his dark red apparel that was buttoned to the end of his neck, looked like the most proper gentleman. But when he was this disheveled, his member bulging with his face contorted in extreme pleasure… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His seductive force was so deadly that the sight almost immediately made her cum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overcome with the intensity of her emotions, she lifted her body up and smacked her lips against his. It started so passionately and then slowly dwindled into small, feathered kisses. With her diminishing fervor, Noah was disgruntled and abruptly grabbed her face.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smooch!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wanted more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of tongues rubbing against each other filled with groans and moans filled the study. The two of them swapped positions and rubbed each other’s genitals over their clothes. Noah detached his mouth for a moment, then put his forehead against to gaze deep into her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You seem to be enjoying yourself, Lady Maktus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-you’re not any different from me…” She countered in defense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He chuckled, seemingly finding something amusing. “I would get an erection just by looking at the hem of your skirt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?” Just as Adele asked him, Noah had already roughly torn the front of his shirt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking off his clothes with an unchanging expression made it seem like he was unmoved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like he wasn’t already overridden with a raging lust and desire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several buttons ripped open and they all fell to the floor with pattering sounds. Adele could already peek at the well-defined abs in his torso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Adele was blatantly ogling him, Noah startled her with a brief kiss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who did you of think of while touching yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele blinked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Should I guess?” Noah’s hand, which was on Adele’s lower lips, began to rubbing. “I did say I’d let you feel indescribable pleasure every night, but it appears you’ve been doing things behind my back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t say that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do I not satisfy you enough?” His ferocious appendage was still engorged and rubbed against her plump, white thighs. Adele shook her head vigorously, trying to contain the feeling building up inside of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I did not think of anything. I just, just…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shall I take guess of your thoughts when you played with yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of answering, Noah put his hand into her slip and swiped at her underwear. It was already very damp. He set her panties aside and put his fingers against her sensitive skin, kneading them gently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Was it my fingers?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You like it when I touch you inside, hm?” he licked behind her ears, “Those little moans of yours are the best proof.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His thick, bony fingers fondled her vagina roughly, then firmly pressed against her little nub. Adele arched her back to the excessive stimulation and let out a moan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah raised her slip over, exposing the inside of her legs. He rubbed the ferocious object against her crotch</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Or was it my crotch?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah let out a mischievous smile and spoke in a low tone, “I would do my utmost to live up to your expectations and pleasure you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Or did you think of other men?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ugh—</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What were you thinking about then, hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Noah’s question, Adele stared intently at his muscular body. She couldn’t possibly say that she was thinking of his… of his… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Noah had already noticed, he pulled her hand and let it roam around his broad chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thinking of me?” he teased, “How lewd you are, Lady Maktus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blushing and panting furiously, Adele whimpered defeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S-stop!” </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was so embarrassing!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Noah simply grinned, “I am pleased to know that you are satisfied with this body.”</span></p>
