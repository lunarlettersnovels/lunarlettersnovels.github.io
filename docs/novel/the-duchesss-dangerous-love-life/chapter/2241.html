            <p><b>Chapter 116</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor’s face darkened in an instant at Adele’s pained and consoling expression.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you choose him—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will die.” she smiled softly, “I know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t want to give up and he was adamant about changing her mind, “I can provide you with anything under the skies. Riches, glory, power, and fame! Isn’t the position of an empress that rules the country so much better than being a duchess?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you never thought of asking me what I want? Because those that you have said, I have… never wanted them in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor’s lashes visibly trembled. “I can do anything for you. I can–and I will–shower you with all the love, affection, and pampering that you deserve. I can be anyone you want me to b—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rayence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stiffened and stared blankly at her. For the first time, she had called him directly by his given name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t love you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rayence clenched his fists so hard that it drew blood. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a cruel woman. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele bypassed the unmoving emperor and walked closer to Noah. Cupping his face with both hands, she lightly caressed his cheek.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you this hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah snapped out of his reverie and berated her softly, “Why did you come here? You could’ve been hurt!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His forehead creased so harshly as he looked at her with immeasurable concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve lost so much weight in just a few days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She chuckled gently, “It’s because you’re not beside me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His heart twisted, but in a good kind of way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop it… Really, why are you so stupid, really…” Adele shed tears and clapped her hands. Noah grinned and clasped her hands tightly. “Shh. I’m alright now. Stop crying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She sniffled and stared at his bright golden eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have something to give you.” With trembling hands, Adele placed something in his palm. Noah looked at the flower in his hand for a long time without saying a word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he spoke, his voice was a little hoarse. “You must have remembered.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah touched the forget-me-not with his fingertips, a few drops of tears fell over it. He raised his head and saw Adele’s tear-stained cheeks. He tenderly touched her face as she responded, “I’m so sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon she saw the yellow diamond ring on her finger and smiled weakly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For forgetting about you, for making you feel lonely, for being so late, and for marrying Enon.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did he feel in those two years of me being his sister-in-law?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele felt pained for him. She was deeply indebted to him because he had saved her life, multiple times already even before they were married. To the point where he even sacrificed his sanity for her. Which is why she was partly to blame for putting him in this situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to her completely forgetting about him, her marrying his brother only made things worse that it was truly the point that almost pushed him to the brink of destruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele was unable to speak. She might not have loved him when she was seventeen, but after everything that has happened and finally understanding the crux of it all… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah slowly kissed her dampened eyes, not forgetting to allay her worries by whispering in her ear, saying ‘It’s okay, it’s okay’ many times over. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Adele.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Noah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Will you marry me again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele nodded fervently. “I will. But, I think… it will have to wait…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele suddenly remembered where they were and carefully surveyed her surroundings. A ravaged wedding hall, bodies strewn on the floor with their innards in display, anxious knights with swords in their hands, and an emperor who was quietly looking at himself in consternation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in front of her, was her husband, a lawless element that had sparked a civil war and was still currently rebelling against authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, at least she had already been prepared for the worst when she had attempted her escape. The scene in front of her was still a little quaint compared to the worst-case scenario. Adele nodded her head in satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah spoke calmly, “I have lost everything as of today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mn.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m empty-handed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mn.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The castle is gone too.”</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…let us go to my home, or in that little hut by the mountains.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them felt they didn’t need a castle for a home, but their reasons were entirely different. For Noah, it was more pessimistic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He just might be executed soon, so he really had no need for one. But in the last moments of his life, he wanted to give her the best that he could, which is something he might not be able to accomplish given his current situation. However, he didn’t want to cower, certainly not in front of her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There won’t be any knights to escort and protect you. Nor would there be any maids to wait on you.” he softly reminded her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I have you…” Adele grinned, showing off her pearly whites. “And I’m plenty strong too!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
