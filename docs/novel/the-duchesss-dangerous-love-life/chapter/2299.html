            <p><strong>Chapter 58</strong></p>
<p>As the children took the lead, the emperor followed them and beckoned Adele to come with him. He wanted to go together with her.</p>
<p>She hesitated. Then decided to follow him, and so the two of them headed for the field.</p>
<p>When they arrived, the emperor let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“This looks like a wasteland.”</p>
<p>It was because the fields where flowers and herbs had always grown abundantly had turned into a place filled with dark soil, it was most probably infertile land too.</p>
<p>“How in the world…”</p>
<p>Two months ago, this place had been filled with different varieties of lovely flowers. Adele sighed. It was such a pity.</p>
<p>The emperor came closer to her and whispered, “Milady, shall I show you something beautiful?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you like dahlias?”</p>
<p>He should’ve been sighing in lament as he looked at the ruined fields, but somehow, he had a relaxed attitude.</p>
<p>“Yes, but—”</p>
<p>“Help me a little.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“I need your necklace.”</p>
<p>Realization dawned on her, “Ah!”</p>
<p>A necklace imbued with ancient healing magic might be of some help. Adele touched the emerald stone and then tried to unclasp it from the back, but she was accustomed to the assistance of her maids so she found it a bit difficult.</p>
<p>Seeing her movements, the emperor extended his arms.</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>His fingers touched the back of her neck, and he began to unhook it. Adele sniffed the cool and refreshing scent from his arms and stared at his jawline. Her gaze traveled to his straight nose, soft skin, emerald-studded eyes and long eyelashes.</p>
<p>Appreciating his pure and untainted countenance, her eyes accidentally met with the emperor’s.</p>
<p>She hurriedly averted her gaze.</p>
<p>Seeing her endearing actions, the emperor smiled warmly. At the sound of a low laughter ringing in her ear, Adele felt her face heat up and heard him say, “Give me your hand.”</p>
<p>Embarrassed, she quickly held out her hand without question and felt something cold touch her palm. It was the emerald necklace she had just been wearing before.</p>
<p>He told the children in a playful tone, “In a little while, the two of us will revive the field. Go over there and play.”</p>
<p>“Wow! Really?” At his words, the children excitedly rushed towards a tree that hadn’t withered yet.</p>
<p>The emperor stood behind Adele and took her hand that held the emerald necklace. He said in a soft voice, “Adele, close your eyes.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Hurry.”</p>
<p>The emperor spoke urgently, so Adele could only comply and swiftly shut her eyes. He wrapped his arms around her as he positioned himself behind her back, raised her arms high, and then reached out to hold her hands that was up in the air.</p>
<p>After that, he whispered gently, as if he were coaxing a small child, “Count together with me.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“One.”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Two.” he lightly coaxed.</p>
<p>Stammering, she followed after him, “T-two.”</p>
<p>“Three!”</p>
<p>“Three!”</p>
<p>Adele closed her eyes and felt the cool air flowing from the back of her hand and into her palm. Soon, a gigantic light began to seep throughout the entire field. Adele felt the scent of flowers stinging her nose and uttered incredulously, “This smell…”</p>
<p>The emperor whispered with a small laugh.</p>
<p>“You may open your eyes.”</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes, the first thing she saw were flower petals fluttering around. Next, she saw an apricot tree emerging in the middle of the field as it quickly rose toward the heavens. Then she saw flowers budding all around as it popped up one after the other, filling the barren land with its wondrous blossoming beauty.</p>
<p>Half of them were dahlias in full bloom.</p>
<p>The children ran around with obvious joy in their faces. The emperor stood in front of her and looked at the revived land with an ecstatic expression on his face.</p>
<p>Adele gazed at the emperor in amazement, “How did this happen?”</p>
<p>“Your necklace.”</p>
<p>“My necklace?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The power in that necklace can only be used by its owner.”</p>
<p>As soon as he finished answering, a gust of wind blew. The emperor looked back at her, his blonde hair fluttering with the wind. She soon realized that it wasn’t simply because of the necklace’s magic. He changed this field with the divine magic passed down within the royal family, though he made it look like he needed the necklace to do it.</p>
<p>Adele was unable to speak at the spectacular sight. The emperor picked up a dahlia and handed it to her.</p>
<p>He gestured towards the place that was currently undergoing its transformation, “What do you think about this?”</p>
<p>“I am honored to be able to see such a sight.”</p>
<p>He chuckled, “What a relief to hear that you like it.”</p>
<p>Adele smiled at his remark and reached out her hand to receive the offered dahlia, but her hand wasn’t able to touch the flower. She thought it was strange and looked down, only to see her body floating.</p>
<p>She screamed.</p>
<p>“<em>Ahhh!”</em></p>
<p>Adele felt her body gradually rising upwards and trembled. The emperor smiled brightly at the interesting display.</p>
<p>“I forgot to tell you that gravity will temporarily disappear if you use too much power of the necklace.”</p>
<p>She found it a little hard to believe.</p>
<p>“Uhm, Your Majesty? Will you help me?”</p>
<p>He hummed in response, “Then grant me a wish, milady.”</p>
