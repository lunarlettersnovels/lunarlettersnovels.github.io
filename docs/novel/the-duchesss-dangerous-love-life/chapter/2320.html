            <p><strong>Chapter 37</strong></p>
<p>“Greetings to the Sun of this empire.”</p>
<p>“It is alright. Please sit down.”</p>
<p>At his words, the women sat down and looked at the emperor’s face. White skin and dark blonde hair like pure melted gold. Bright emerald-colored eyes glimmered brightly under those long lashes.</p>
<p>The face that looks like it had been delicately crafted made people question if he truly was human. Words that circulated among the streets that ‘the most important flower of the empire is the emperor’ was true. He was even more beautiful than a female, yet he still managed to appear distinctly male.</p>
<p>This delicate balance led the young ladies to stare at him in awe. The ladies also pretended to be polite and covered their flushed faces with fans.</p>
<p>After receiving everyone’s attention, he calmly spoke to the princess. “Speak kindly, Janice.”</p>
<p>“Brother, this is the place for ladies to gather and talk.”</p>
<p>“I’m here because I missed you, but here you are, treating your brother badly.” The emperor’s eloquent rhetoric made some young ladies laugh, some ladies blush.</p>
<p>Then he saw a blonde-haired woman next to his sister, “Have you made up with Irie? Weren’t you guys love rivals who fought over Noah?”</p>
<p>“Ray!”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, the emperor glanced over the girls and found Adele, his eyes slightly parted in surprise.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. Madame Maktus.” The emperor quickly approached Adele with a wide stride and kissed the back of her hand.</p>
<p>Adele, unfamiliar with the imperial court’s etiquette, simply bowed her head slightly. As his face got close, she was afraid that her face would turn red, so she swiftly spoke up. “Thank you for attending the wedding before, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Mm. I wasn’t able to congratulate you properly that day.”</p>
<p>“It is alright, your presence was already such an honor. I am the one who hasn’t thanked you properly.”</p>
<p>Adele remembered the emperor who had also attended her wedding with Enon, and sincerely thanked him. At that time, she couldn’t even remember if she had properly thanked him. The emperor looked at her bitter smile and slowly blinked his eyes.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t able to tell you that day, but I’m really sorry about what happened to Enon.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Let me bear the burden, because Enon left after I sent the command. I am the one to be resented.”</p>
<p>“No.” Adele hastily shook her head, “It is not Your Majesty’s fault.”</p>
<p>As Adele shook her head, the emperor had a sad look on his face.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know he would leave like that. He was lively, kind, and one of the few people I liked. It’s a sad thing—” The emperor paused as he looked at her. Adele felt bewildered at his somewhat surprised expression and touched her cheek. It was already drenched in tears.</p>
<p>“Ah.”He apologized, “I must have gone too far.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no. It’s because there has never been someone who treated him sincerely like you.” Adele quickly covered her face with her hand. She was not in the right mind to think first of wiping her tears away.</p>
<p>The emperor took out his handkerchief and gently wiped her wet cheeks. “Madam Maktus, don’t you feel uncomfortable in here?”</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>
<p>“The garden has just finished being renovated. It’s a pity that I didn’t have a chance to show you. Will you accompany me today?”</p>
<p>Adele nodded at the gentle invitation. The emperor held out his scepter to her. Adele grabbed it gently and got up from her seat. She greeted the princess briefly and went out to the garden with him.</p>
<p><em>Ha! She’s really something! </em>The princess, looking at Adele’s back, clenched her fist and bit her lip.</p>
<p><em>The husband and wife dare to make fun of me?</em> As she gazed at the scorching sunlight through her window, she recalled the first day she met Noah.</p>
<p><em>‘You are Noah Maktus?’</em></p>
<p>A year ago, in the tent in the corner of the battlefield, the princess was sitting on an old chair. The knights were busy taking glances at her, admiring her beauty. Receiving the gaze of the men on her body, the princess lifted her chin and glanced at Noah, who had just taken off his armor.</p>
<p><em>‘I’ll thank you first. Who knew I’d be kidnapped on the way home?’</em></p>
<p>The princess was on her way home from studying at an academy abroad in a neighboring country. Growing up being spoiled, her personality was naturally arrogant. She frowned upon seeing Noah not answering her question.</p>
<p><em>‘Are you mute? Or you don’t dare answer what the princess is saying?’</em></p>
<p>Ignoring her question, Noah took off his shirt that was soaked in blood.</p>
<p>The maid standing behind the princess said, ‘Oh my!’ and covered her eyes. The princess, on the other hand, swallowed her saliva, her eyes scanning his muscular body.</p>
<p><em>‘You…’</em></p>
<p>He ignored her.</p>
<p><em>‘Do you have any thoughts on becoming a princess’s husband?’</em></p>
<p>Everyone in the tent gasped in surprise at the princess’s proposal. She glanced at Noah’s reaction. He was still wiping the blood from his body with a towel without answering. The princess opened her mouth again.</p>
<p><em>‘If you aren’t interested in that, then, as a man, you must have some lu$t for a woman’s body.’</em></p>
<p>After saying those words, the princess took off her coat. As she ran away earlier, the hem of her robe was torn, revealing her chest. The knights quickly bowed their heads. But because they were men who stayed on the battlefield for too long and was rarely able to see women, they took the chance to peek at her plumpness.</p>
<p><em>‘How is it? You can have me as a reward for saving me.’</em></p>
