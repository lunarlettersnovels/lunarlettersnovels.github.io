            <p><strong>Chapter 55</strong></p>
<p>Back then, she was so mortified with what happened that night that she simply pretended to forget. Adele hurriedly walked forward, but Noah playfully pursued this frightened little deer quickly walked behind her.</p>
<p>“Oh? Pretending not to know, is it?” he teased.</p>
<p>“Lina! Where are you?” Deliberately ignoring his words, she called out to her maid. Adele hurriedly went to find her when Noah tried to wrap his arms around her shoulders. Lina, who was waiting for her nearby in front of a jewelry store, turned her head.</p>
<p>“Milady?”</p>
<p>“Found you!” Adele let out a sigh of relief and sprint-walked towards her. “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Lina felt guilty and let out an excuse, “I did not want to disturb my lord and lady, so I went looking around by myself!”</p>
<p>In other words, she didn’t want to disturb their date.</p>
<p>Adele fanned her face and her gaze darted around. In front of her was the Elligana, a boutique that specialized in jewelry.</p>
<p>Men usually don’t like shopping with women. She thought that, if she went inside the boutique, she would be able to avoid him. She rushed into the store with Lina. The owner, a middle-aged handsome man with a mustache, warmly greeted her.</p>
<p>“Welcome, madame! It is an honor that you have visited our humble boutique. Is there anything in particular that you are looking for?”</p>
<p>“I’m just looking around.”</p>
<p>“If you allow me, madame, I shall help you find the pieces that will perfectly match your preferences. Please look this way.” The owner pointed to a delicate glass showcase on the right side of the store.</p>
<p>As they walked over, they could see every kind of jewelry in existence. From a common pearl necklace to rare jade bracelets, to a certain pink diamond ring that was almost impossible to find. The owner recommended this and that, but Adele, who wanted to slowly look around and admire the pieces, stopped his enthusiastic explanation with a gesture.</p>
<p>Afterwards, she glanced at the items in the display case. Among them, her eyes focused on the earrings with peridot stones as well as a lustrously pink pearl ring. However, there were other things she needed to buy. Then she eyed another piece, it was a lovely brooch this time.</p>
<p>A long finger suddenly intruded her contemplation as it pointed at the 20-carat, aquamarine studded brooch she was staring at.</p>
<p>“Take this out.”</p>
<p>When Adele turned her head, she was surprised to see it was Noah’s. She really didn’t know he would come here. As she stood still, the boutique owner took out the aquamarine brooch and placed it on top of the glass showcase for closer inspection.</p>
<p>“This is a new arrival, in addition to the high-quality work of its craftsman, this made it even more valuable and pleasing to the eye. It is the perfect accessory for your wife.” The owner let out his most genial smile.</p>
<p>Naturally, if the woman came with a man, didn’t this show she at least had some level of importance to his heart? His smile became even wider, thinking he might profit handsomely today.</p>
<p>Before Adele could reach for it, Noah picked up the brooch himself. He tugged at the chest part of her dress to place it in and Adele lowered her gaze in embarrassment.</p>
<p>When he fastened the brooch with an unusually gentle touch, she glanced at him again in wonder. Noah looked at her and smiled.</p>
<p>“Pretty.”</p>
<p>She felt her face getting hot, so she quickly turned around.</p>
<p>In the mirror above the glass case, she saw herself wearing a brooch that perfectly complemented her pink and white lace dress. It also brought out the fairness of her doll-like complexion. Noah felt like he had found some good stuff, aquamarine was her favorite after all.</p>
<p>“Buy it, it matches you well.” The expression on his face as he leaned against the shelf and stared at Adele was breathtakingly sweet, very much unlike his usual poker face.</p>
<p>She paused for a moment.</p>
<p>She could buy it with her own allowance, but…</p>
<p>Seeing his adoring face, she felt like Noah would buy anything for her if she asks for it.</p>
<p>She had never asked for anything from Enon. She acted humbly because he hated women who spent money for excessive luxury. But as a human, she has her wants too. Every time she wanted to have something, she always bought it with her own allowance. But truth was, she had always been envious of women who received gifts from their husbands.</p>
<p>But Noah, he may be cold, but she could feel his tenderness within—tenderness that was only for her.</p>
<p>Last time, he took care of her and today, he had rescued her. Adele felt the reassuring presence of a husband coming from him.</p>
<p>It felt… good.</p>
<p><em>Then, it wouldn’t hurt to act like his wife too</em>, <em>right?</em></p>
<p>Adele glanced at him and carefully tugged Noah’s clothes, “I’ll take this…”</p>
<p>“Just like that?”</p>
<p>He tapped his lips with a sly expression. Realizing what Noah was asking her of, her face quickly turned red.</p>
<p><em>Shameless! Where does he think he is!</em></p>
<p>As she turned away from him, he spoke regretfully, “Why is it so hard to get a kiss from my own wife? Excuse me,” he addressed the shop owner, “does this come with a set?”</p>
<p>The owner nodded ecstatically, quickly taking out the entire set and presenting it with both hands. It had everything, from aquamarine earrings down to its own set of anklets. Noah asked Adele, beckoning her.</p>
<p>“Do you like it?”</p>
<p>Adele looked at the aquamarine trinkets and smiled softly. “Yes.”</p>
<p>Seeing her adorable side profile, Noah resisted the desire to pinch those reddish cheeks. She quickly pointed her finger at the peridot earrings and the pink pearl necklace. Those were the things she had looked at earlier.</p>
<p>“Give me this set too.”</p>
<p>“Of course, milord.” Then, the owner happily sauntered away to retrieve the items from another set. Today was a good day, these two sets were two of the most expensive ones he currently had after all.</p>
<p>Before Adele could say anything, Noah’s thick arms wrapped around her thin shoulders. She squinted at him, then bowed her head slightly.</p>
<p><em>He didn’t have to do that.</em></p>
<p>Noah looked down at Adele whose neck was so red and whispered lowly in her ear.</p>
<p>“Should I buy you anything else?”</p>
