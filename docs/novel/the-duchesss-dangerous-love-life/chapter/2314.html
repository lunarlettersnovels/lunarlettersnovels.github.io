            <p><strong>Chapter 43 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Adele noticed that the emperor was a bit weary.</p>
<p><em>‘You must be tired.’</em></p>
<p>He waved it off, <em>‘I am the emperor, it is my duty to attend to numerous matters for the country. Do not worry about it.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘But you are a human first, an emperor second. It’s okay to be tired and get some rest from time to time.’</em></p>
<p><em>Ah, she’s the same as always. </em>The emperor couldn’t answer and stood still. He had no choice but to reign in his words when the bridesmaids signaled that they had to prepare for the wedding.</p>
<p>Rayence could only look at Adele in a white wedding dress walking down the Virgin Road towards a different man.</p>
<p><em>I should’ve asked her name that day…</em></p>
<p>He had lost the only woman who saw him as a person, not as an emperor. He lamented his plight, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>Two years had passed, and he finally had a chance. Her husband, Enon Maktus, had died.</p>
<p>But then, Noah Maktus married her because of the law. But he saw no signs of her love for her recent husband today. Moreover, she directly said at the tea party that she got married because of Enon’s will. Though he felt something different with Noah…</p>
<p>“Perhaps, I still have a chance.”</p>
<p>Rayence, who swore not to miss even the slightest possibility, watched Adele and Noah’s back as they walked in the distance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Noah glanced at the woman by his side, “Why did you go to the castle?”</p>
<p>“Well, because I was invited.”</p>
<p>“Don’t go there next time.” He demanded.</p>
<p>Adele was nonplussed, “Yes?”</p>
<p>“Just give some excuses and—”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“—no one can say anything.”</p>
<p>“Why are you saying nonsense?” Adele was already awkward because of last night’s event with Noah, but it felt even more awkward as the two of them were stuck together riding in the same carriage.</p>
<p>Because of that, the temperature felt hotter than before and she had to fan herself. She glanced at Noah who kept trying to restrict her.</p>
<p>“I am the Duchess, the Lady of the Maktus family, I can’t miss events like these with such petty reasons.”</p>
<p>“Lady, you say…” Noah repeated her words and smiled in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Vexed, she could only question him, “Well? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“The same with you. I am the lord of the Maktus family, I have some matters to report on.”</p>
<p>“Matters? Ha, aren’t you, focusing on training, these days?”</p>
<p>Noah managed the Knights Templar, so he did not work as a subordinate of the Imperial Castle. Therefore, he seldom had a reason to go to the castle.</p>
<p>Hearing her words, he quirked a brow, “It seems that you’re quite interested in me.”</p>
<p>She stopped fanning herself, “What did you say?”</p>
<p>He continued and sat in a more languid manner, “Doesn’t seem at all like the woman who ignored me all week.”</p>
<p>“That is—!”</p>
<p>“What an honor. Though, I’m a little uncertain with what to do now that you are showing interest in me.” He smirked.</p>
<p><em>This infuriating man!</em></p>
<p>“Don’t change the topic.”</p>
<p>Finally, Noah had a more serious look on his face. “I really came here as I had something to do.”</p>
<p>“Something? At the castle?” Adele asked a question as his words were a little ambiguous.</p>
<p>Instead of answering her, Noah glanced at her red face and he clenched his fists. If he touched her chubby cheeks and tell her that she was cute now, he may be ignored for a month rather than a week. Suppressing the urge to touch her, he struggled to respond.</p>
<p>“When I came back to the castle after training, you were already gone.”</p>
<p><em>Uh…</em></p>
<p>“Therefore,” he looked at her with a deadpanned expression, “I went out to search for my missing wife.”</p>
<p>“Why would you—”</p>
<p>Adele rapidly shook her head at his reply. She soon tried to tell him something, but her condition wasn’t very good. Her whole body was hot. If that were simply the case, she would’ve thought that this was just a fever that had just risen due to her body aches. But her nether regions kept getting hot and moist.</p>
<p>She also had strange thoughts—thoughts about Noah.</p>
<p>Adele eyed him. She noticed his large hands and long fingers, broad shoulders, thick nape and a wide chest. His body was rippling with powerful muscles. And…</p>
<p>She stared intently at the area between his thighs.</p>
<p>“Adele, is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“Ah, there isn’t…” As Adele mumbled, Noah quickly put a hand on her forehead.</p>
<p>She was too hot.</p>
<p>He frowned, “Are you down with a fever? You went to the castle in this state?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that. My b-body feels strange… I…”</p>
<p>Adele was unable to finish her words and leaned forward. Fortunately, she was embraced by Noah, and she fainted in his arms.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“My goodness! The lady’s temperature is too hot!”</p>
<p>“Milord, shall I call the doctor?”</p>
<p>Noah entered the castle gate and slowly gazed at Adele, he carried on with his large strides, leaving behind the fussing servants.</p>
<p>It was dark inside the carriage, so he couldn’t clearly see her appearance before.</p>
<p>A flushed face and watery eyes, heavy breaths, a trembling body. She struggled to open her eyes and stretched out her shaking hand toward him.</p>
<p>“Uh… h-help me…”</p>
<p>Noah’s body jolted when he heard the moan from her small lips.</p>
<p>This was a symptom of intoxication, from a substance the soldiers and prostitutes often used on the battlefield.</p>
<p><em>What happened? You said you were invited to the Imperial Palace!</em></p>
<p>Noah noticed the unusual circumstances and his face went grim. Seconds later, Lina brought a towel soaked in cold water and wiped Adele’s face.</p>
<p>“Milord, she wasn’t like this when she went to the palace!”</p>
<p>He fixed her a severe gaze, “What made her go to the palace?”</p>
<p>The maid spluttered, “Sh-she went there b-because of the tea party that the princess held.”</p>
<p><em>Princess!</em></p>
<p>Noah remembered the day when he met the princess one year ago. He roughly grasped what had happened and gritted his teeth. She was the only person who was capable of drugging Adele.</p>
