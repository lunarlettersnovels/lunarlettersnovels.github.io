        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 79</strong></p>
<p>Her protests were ignored.</p>
<p><em>‘If a beast appears again, you won’t be able to escape.’</em></p>
<p>Adele couldn’t retort to that, so she decided to bargain feebly. <em>‘I can… follow you well enough from the back.’</em></p>
<p>She grumbled incoherently underneath her breath and wriggled in his arms.</p>
<p><em>‘You’ll fall if you keep struggling.’</em></p>
<p>They were on the way down. Adele halted her unnecessary movements in fear of him letting go accidentally. She unconsciously rested her upper body against his chest and shoulders.</p>
<p>He didn’t show any signs of exhaustion at all, even while carrying an adult woman in his left arm and holding his sword in the other. Adele admired his strength, but then she remembered he was her brother-in-law so she felt embarrassed.</p>
<p>She tried to initiate a conversation with him.</p>
<p><em>‘I’ll walk by myself starting from that point, it’s already safe there.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Aren’t you tired?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘I’m sorry.’</em></p>
<p>Again, he didn’t answer. This wasn’t the first time, but she couldn’t help but to get angry. Adele bit her lip, thinking that Noah looked unfavorably upon her.</p>
<p>As if he could read her mind, Noah eyed her and smirked.</p>
<p>His handsome smile made Adele blush and she quickly bowed her head. Burying her own face in Noah’s shoulder. She sensed the warmth from his body that exuded a thick masculine scent that was uniquely his. She stole a glance at his face.</p>
<p><em>How handsome.</em></p>
<p>His mother must be so glad to have a son like him. He’s the most famous and good-looking man in the empire, but that isn’t all there is to him. His capabilities also spoke volumes of what kind of person he was.</p>
<p>However, he spoke so coldly and sarcastically all the time. He didn’t even know how to respect his sister-in-law.</p>
<p>As Adele puckered her lips in disapproval, Noah spoke unexpectedly.</p>
<p><em>‘You need to gain weight.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Sorry?’</em></p>
<p>He didn’t speak after that. He said that to her, who was already taller and more voluminous than most women. Adele fanned her hands to calm her flushed face. This was the first time someone’s ever commented on her to gain weight. She couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Was he goading her?</p>
<p>When she finished fanning herself, her trembling hands brushed the nape of Noah’s neck.</p>
<p><em>‘Mn. It tickles.’</em> His voice didn’t even fluctuate, it was like he just uttered a report on some uninteresting topic.</p>
<p>Noah stopped walking and looked at her. Adele was about to say sorry out of habit, but then she immediately forgot what to say.</p>
<p>Because Noah’s stunning face stared at her closely, an eyebrow raised provocatively. This was truly too good-looking!</p>
<p>Adele turned her head away to hide her reddening face.</p>
<p>Some say that if your husband was attractive, even in a fight, your anger would disperse immediately if you just stared at his face. She thought it was nonsense, but looking at him, she thought it might be possible.</p>
<p><em>Who will have the honor of marrying this handsome man? Sighs, even if I think about it, wouldn’t know, and it has nothing to do with me anyway. I can only hope that she would be a good person.</em></p>
<p>But she never dreamed that he would marry her.</p>
<p>Adele wandered through the recesses of her memory, seeking something, but she couldn’t pinpoint what. Perhaps it was because she dreamt an old dream that occurred after a long time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Adele came to her senses, she saw was a wooden ceiling.</p>
<p>“Lie down, don’t get up yet.”</p>
<p>“Hm…?”</p>
<p>Turning her head, she spotted Noah sitting on a chair in front of the bed. He asked with a look of concern. “Are you alright? Do you feel pain anywhere?”</p>
<p>“No, but…” she glanced at herself hesitantly, “why am I naked?”</p>
<p>Adele hugged the blanket and looked at Noah with an inquisitive gaze. He spoke with a righteous expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Your clothes were muddied, why would I let you keep wearing it?”</p>
<p>“T-that’s not what I meant.”</p>
<p>Noah found it amusing, really.</p>
<p>“My dear wife, we are in a relationship. I,” he emphasized the word deeply, “am your husband. We are allowed to see each other naked.”</p>
<p>Adele pulled the blanket up to her neck. No matter how frequent they’ve had s*x, it was incredibly mortifying just to imagine him taking off her clothes and then seeing her naked while she was still dead to the world.</p>
<p>Raising the corners of his mouth, Noah put the wet towel he was holding inside the basin that was placed on the floor.</p>
<p>“You were burning with fever last night.”</p>
<p>Seeing her body was clean of any filth and grime, she asked, “Did you nurse me afterwards?”</p>
<p>Without responding, he squeezed the wet towel of its water. Adele felt apologetic that she doubted him when in reality, he was just taking care of her.</p>
<p>“S-sorry, and um… T-thank you.”</p>
<p>“Anything else you want to know?”</p>
<p>Adele remembered that this place was unfamiliar to her. “Um, where is this place?”</p>
<p>She was inside a small wooden house, with a reindeer’s head and a gun hanging on a wall. Rain tapped on the window and wood burned in the fireplace that made crackling sounds every now and then. The room she was in felt warm and cozy.</p>
<p>“It’s a hunter’s house.”</p>
<p>“What happened? The earthquake happened so suddenly—”</p>
<p>He interrupted her words, “The ground collapsed because of a landslide. It’s not on a large scale, so you don’t need to worry. But it’s raining hard, so it’s dangerous to go out right now.”</p>
