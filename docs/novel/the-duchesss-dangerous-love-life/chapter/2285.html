            <p><strong>Chapter 72</strong></p>
<p>Adele let out a deep sigh. <em>Right, I have already made my mind up before marrying him. I knew this would happen.</em></p>
<p><em>Click! </em>Adele turned off the lights. She sat and drank a glass of wine on the table, positioned herself next to him as she closed her eyes, and waited for sleep to claim her.</p>
<p>But after more than an hour of tossing and turning, she gave up and stood in vexation.</p>
<p><em>I should at least read a book.</em></p>
<p>Adele got out of bed, being careful so as to not wake Enon. She was about to call the maids, but then stopped and glanced back at her sleeping husband.</p>
<p><em>It would be too noisy.</em></p>
<p>Instead of ringing the bell, Adele went down the hallway stairs with a flashlight and went into the study.</p>
<p><em>Creak!</em></p>
<p>With the moonlight streaming down from glass paneled windows, she arrived at the library and stood in front of a bookshelf. When she thought about which book she’d have to read to get a good night’s sleep, she saw the title ‘About Animals’.</p>
<p><em>Mn! Reading such a boring book would eventually make me feel sleepy.</em></p>
<p>Adele stretched out her hand and stood on her tiptoes. When she placed her hand on the spine of the book, she suddenly remembered the day before</p>
<p>She huffed out a breath.</p>
<p>Adele lowered her arms in embarrassment, but was startled when a protruding book on the lower end touched her pubic bone. She bit her lip and cautiously surveyed her surroundings. Fortunately, there was no one around.</p>
<p>Relieved, Adele gently placed her hand down there.</p>
<p><em>There’s no one around anyway, so…</em></p>
<p><em>‘Ahh…’</em></p>
<p>It was early dawn, so her mind was still a little too hazy.</p>
<p><em>I think it’s because of the wine that I drank earlier.</em></p>
<p>Adele arbitrarily made an excuse and proceeded to run her fingers over the clothes that covered her labia. At her age, this was only her first masturbation.</p>
<p>She pressed her fingers against her clitoris hard, but only felt ticklish. Like something was missing.</p>
<p>Well, there really was…</p>
<p><em>‘Uh…’</em></p>
<p>She thought how nice it would be if someone did this for her instead. He would support her with broad shoulders and arms strong, his thick nimble fingers would do pleasure her, and she would get to hear his low, masculine voice…</p>
<p>When Noah’s figure emerged inside her mind, Adele shook her head violently. She inhaled sharply and converted her thoughts into something else.</p>
<p>The scent of old paper, thick wood.</p>
<p>The scent of paper and wood.</p>
<p>His scent—</p>
<p><em>No…</em></p>
<p>Adele weakly protested inside her mind and struggled internally.</p>
<p><em>I wish Enon would touch my body, but he can’t!</em></p>
<p><em>I… I have to think of ‘him’.</em></p>
<p>Adele let out a hot breath and squeezed her eyes shut. Her grip on the bookshelf became tighter as her imagination wandered.</p>
<p>She recollected the feeling of being embraced in Noah’s wide and strong arms, staring at his extraordinarily handsome features. She imagined his deep eyes with the gaze of a wanting man who looked down at her hungrily.</p>
<p>She imagined how his nimble fingers would pleasure her and how his body would feel if she laid underneath him…</p>
<p>She squeezed her legs together as an intense desire overwhelmed her senses and she quickened the pace of the two fingers inside of her.</p>
<p><em>‘Ahh!!’</em></p>
<p>The most exhilarating feeling coursed through her body, she felt weak and trembled lightly.</p>
<p>At last, having felt the pleasure she yearned for, Adele slowly put herself together and sat down properly.</p>
<p><em>How lucky his wife would be, to be able to do those things with him…</em></p>
<p>Coming back to her senses, she shook her head hard and slapped her cheek with her hands.</p>
<p><em>How can you think of your husband’s brother and do this!</em></p>
<p>Greatly ashamed and disappointed with herself, she lost strength in her legs that she couldn’t even get up. She just squinted her eyes around to see who might’ve seen her doing such a lewd activity.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I didn’t know things would turn out like this…”</p>
<p>Recalling that autumn night a year ago, Adele plopped down on the sofa. Her white thighs were revealed through the thin slip that she wore, her shawl sliding down on her delicate shoulders.</p>
<p>Her body heated up when she thought about that incident.</p>
<p>She was a human, so she would naturally have sexual desires. Come to think of it, she hasn’t slept with him for over a week. Just as then, she looked around and scanned the study.</p>
<p>“Right, it’s because of the champagne…”</p>
<p><em>At the dinner party, I felt thirsty and drank a few glasses of champagne, so that’s why…</em></p>
<p>Struggling to make another flimsy excuse, she slipped her hand into her nightgown. She started rubbing herself over her underwear. She was still very clumsy with her hands, obviously having not done this often.</p>
<p>A moan escaped her lips and she twisted her own legs. She was getting closer to pleasure.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, in her mind was his now familiar face.</p>
<p>That autumn night, she had only vaguely imagined things. But now, she could now picture him in her mind with stark clarity.</p>
<p>His big hand that softly caressed her body and would playfully squeeze her breasts. His scorching tongue that would travel to every inch of her body, eventually reaching to lick at her soaked nether regions.</p>
<p>His drastic change from a silent, brooding man to a hot-blooded and passionate man that would spit lascivious words that greatly aroused her even though she didn’t want to admit it.</p>
<p>And his member that filled her to the brim with mind-numbing pleasure…</p>
<p>“Uh.”</p>
<p>No matter how much she rubbed it with her own hands, she couldn’t climax.</p>
<p>Something was missing, and the unsatisfied ache that she felt was starting to become painful. Deciding to discontinue her actions, she wanted to take her hand away when she heard a familiar voice.</p>
<p>“Don’t stop, that was such a nice sight to see.” Stunned, Adele turned around and saw Noah, still dressed formally while holding a glass of wine.</p>
