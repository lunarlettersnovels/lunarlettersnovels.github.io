            <p><strong>Chapter 38</strong></p>
<p>The princess was known for her boldness and confidence. When she set her eyes on Noah, she didn’t twice of seducing him, right then and there.</p>
<p>As she spoke, she admired Noah’s thick torso and large muscled thighs. A man she wanted to have. When he cut off the head of the enemy captain earlier, she barely resisted the desire to mount herself on top of him right away and squeeze him dry. She licked her dry lips with her tongue.</p>
<p>Without looking at the princess, Noah tossed his subordinate a wet towel.</p>
<p><em>‘Tell the others to wipe their swords. We’ll attack the Castle of Haria tomorrow.’ </em>Noah ordered.</p>
<p>The subordinate, distracted by the princess’s chest, took some time to process his words.</p>
<p><em>‘Yes? Ah, yes sir!’ </em>He quickly offered him a new shirt. Noah took it and put it on without a word.</p>
<p>The princess stomped her foot at his attitude of completely ignoring her.</p>
<p><em>‘Noah Maktus!’</em></p>
<p>Noah turned his head when she called out his name. The princess was satisfied and raised the corners of her lips.</p>
<p><em>‘So, now you see me.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Shut her mouth.’ </em>Noah gave orders to the knights. They hesitated, unable to treat the princess lightly, she opened her mouth in disbelief.</p>
<p><em>‘What?! How dare you! I am a princess!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘If you don’t shut that mouth, I’ll cut off your arms.’ </em>He threatened the knights, only then did they come to the princess with the cloth.</p>
<p>She unknowingly took a step back from them. When the princess’ buttocks touched her chair, Noah restrained the knights and grabbed her by the neck with his thick hands, a menacing expression on his face.</p>
<p><em>‘Although, if I twist your neck, it would spare me the trouble of binding you.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘What do you mean!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘You must be Rayence’s sister.’ </em>He scoffed in derision,<em> ‘Just like your brother, you really like to use the imperial family’s name.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Let me go!’</em></p>
<p>As the princess trembled, Noah raised the corners of his lips.</p>
<p><em>‘The emperor told me to save you, not to kill you, but do not tempt me. Otherwise…’</em></p>
<p>Otherwise, he would kill her. When the princess didn’t say anything, he spoke.</p>
<p><em>‘A cargo ship heading to the capital will arrive in a week.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Until then, you’ll have to prove you’re worthy of living.’ </em>Noah lifted his hand and looked down at the princess.<em> ‘If you’re worthy of the sacrifice made with the lives my three hundred men.’</em></p>
<p>The princess jumped up as he turned around to leave the tent.</p>
<p><em>‘I am a princess! That mere fact alone proves I am worthy to live. Also—’</em></p>
<p>Drop! The dress the princess was wearing fell to the floor. As soon as her naked body was exposed, the maid hurriedly told the knights to turn her back. Although, they pretended they couldn’t hear and ogled at the n@ked princess with reddened faces.</p>
<p><em>‘—I am a beautiful lady. Wouldn’t that be worthy enough to you?’</em></p>
<p>Noah, who was walking to the entrance of the tent, looked back in disdain.</p>
<p>Big breasts, yet a slovenly body.</p>
<p>The princess was sure Noah would be interested in her beautiful, unclothed figure. A true man would definitely be flustered! Her arrogance was really sky high.</p>
<p>His face glowed as the light poured down from the tent entrance. A straight nose and a sharp jawline, long eyelashes and shiny golden eyes, red lips that she  couldn’t help but want to taste…</p>
<p>The princess instantly fell in love with Noah.</p>
<p>His lips, which were pressed into a thin line, uttered, <em>‘Not interested.’</em></p>
<p>The princess was confounded, <em>‘What?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘My thing won’t stand up.’ </em>Noah placed his hand on his pelvis.</p>
<p>The princess, feeling intense mortification, lowered her head.</p>
<p><em>‘In my unit, anyone who rapes a woman will be punished a death penalty. But if you plan to spread your legs like a whore to prove your worth like you’re doing now</em>,’ he paused, and sneered at her, <em>‘wouldn’t this prove how utterly useless you are that you can’t even think of anything else?’</em></p>
<p>He chuckled, <em>‘It annoys me to think that my men died for a harlot.’</em></p>
<p>With these words, Noah left the tent.</p>
<p><em>‘Ugh!’</em></p>
<p>The princess’s face had already turned red and had been brimming with tears from his insult.</p>
<p><em>Bastard! He dares to do that knowing that he had stunning face?!</em></p>
<p>The princess grabbed her furiously pounding chest and bit her lip.</p>
<p><em>Wait until I take you with me when I return to the Imperial Palace. There isn’t a man I can’t have!</em> The princess gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>But her wish did not come true, Noah was busy commanding the soldiers and planning. The princess couldn’t eat properly, so she became weak. She could’ve gotten better quickly with medicine, but she was in a battlefield.</p>
<p><em>‘Princess, I think we should go back, your health is deteriorating.’</em></p>
<p>Inside Noah’s tent, the maid trembled with anxiety, looking around for him to appear. The princess raised her head and pretended to be calm. Then her eyes widened when she saw the herbs on her desk.</p>
<p>It was a good herb for women’s mild fever, body aches, and diseases. She smiled and thought smugly. <em>Even if you act coldly, you’re still worried about me. After all, I’m a princess through and through.</em></p>
<p>Thinking she was someone special, her mood improved and she asked, <em>‘I’m fine. Where is Noah Maktus right now?’</em></p>
<p>The answer to the princess’s words was given by the knight who stood guard outside the tent.</p>
<p><em>‘He went to the forest with a few men, to see for himself the path they could take to raid the castle.’</em></p>
