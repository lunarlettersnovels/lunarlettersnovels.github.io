            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 20</strong></p>
<p><em>Creak!</em></p>
<p>A monster was crawling out of the moist ground in the forest adjacent to the castle of the Maktus family. It was a sand shark, a monster with a shark’s body and salamander’s legs, that came out with its mouth wide open.</p>
<p>The knights nearby untied the ropes tied to the sand shark and hurriedly retreated. Noah glanced at it silently and slowly drew his sword.</p>
<p>The sand shark roared and charged towards him. Noah swung his sword lightly.</p>
<p><em>Swoosh!</em> The monster’s leg was cut off in an instant.</p>
<p>But after a while, flesh began to regrow from the wound. Soon after, it had completely regenerated. The other knights who saw it turned pale, but Noah raised the corners of his mouth, as if it was a fun discovery for him.</p>
<p><em>Thump!</em></p>
<p>Blood splattered towards the sky, the body of the sand shark that rushed back at him was cut off. Noah, covered in blood that came pouring down from above, continued to move his sword lightly with pleasure-filled eyes. The monster screamed in anger as it realized the human seemed to be toying with him.</p>
<p><em>Shriek!</em></p>
<p>At the deafening noise, Noah looked at the castle of the Maktus family in the distance. “They must’ve heard it from there.”</p>
<p>Thinking that it might’ve possibly disturbed her, Noah nailed his weapon to the ground. A black mirage spewed out of the sword, and in an instant, it enveloped the entire body of the sand shark.</p>
<p>The monster was quickly devoured by the black energy. It floundered violently, but afterwards, it just collapsed.</p>
<p>The sand shark whose irises have turned from brown to black, bowed its head to Noah and closed its eyes. Noah brushed off the thick blood on the sword. One of the knights who had been watching the slaughter bravely opened his mouth. “Milord, you can return now.”</p>
<p>“Is this the last one?”</p>
<p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
<p>Noah touched the body of the shark with his foot. “How boring.”</p>
<p>The Black Knights who had followed Noah were staring at him familiarly. Meanwhile, the knights of the castle could not hide their tension in face of the power of the new lord who would lead them in the future.</p>
<p>If Noah had not come, the sand shark would’ve managed to win against twenty knights even if all of them attacked at once. But he dealt with such a monster by himself in an instant. Seemingly having the same thoughts, the knights hired at the duke’s castle looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Return to the training grounds.”</p>
<p>Noah turned around and went back. On the way, the corpses of the monsters he killed were strewn about, all unmoving with their tongues dyed black. In order to survive, the knights followed, keeping a certain distance from their lord. When they finally arrived at the training grounds, the knights knelt down without a word and bowed their heads.</p>
<p>Ignoring the greetings, Noah took off his armor and went into the shower room to wash off the blood.</p>
<p><em>Shh!</em></p>
<p>A cool stream of water flowed down his healthy tanned skin and firm muscles. Noah closed his eyes, feeling the pleasure of slaughter that could not be contained.</p>
<p>His thirst was not quenched.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, the desire was satiated by slaughtering humans and monsters all day, but the same cannot happen here. He needed something to alleviate his urges.</p>
<p>He stared at his bloodstained hands.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, before he grabbed the sword, he had stroked and touched her soft and supple flesh at dawn. Noah narrowed his eyes and recalled Adele’s body that he had savored yesterday.</p>
<p>Light brown eyes and plump cheeks that quivered when she stared at him. Round, ample chest and thighs. A body so beautiful that you would want to touch it until you lose your mind. He wanted to hug Adele right away and make love to her.</p>
<p>But if he did that, she would feel ashamed afterwards. What more if he got her pregnant?</p>
<p>If she gave birth to a child, would she still leave? She wouldn’t dare to. After all, it would still be her child, who might resemble either her or him. Noah licked his lips and ran his wet hand through his hair.</p>
<p>“I was quite serious about that…” he mumbled. Noah let out a sigh and stopped the water. Then he heard the voice of the 2nd Army Battalion Commander outside of the room.</p>
<p>“Commander, I have placed the documents you need to check inside the tent.” He continued, “How should we proceed with the training today?”</p>
<p>Noah replied, “Today’s training will be a battle simulation.”</p>
<p>At his answer, the 2nd Army Battalion Commander’s was startled and his mouth gaped.</p>
<p><em>Ugh!</em> He groaned inwardly. What did this mean? It was to create a defensive line in preparation for a night attack by an enemy, preparing for a siege, engaging in multiple formations to fend off attackers, and to train without break for 10 hours straight. In short, it was a mock battle and the perfect type of training that would tire the knights to death.</p>
<p>After the battalion commander almost inaudibly replied that he would do as Noah said, he quickly scampered off.</p>
<p>When Noah came out of the shower with clothes on, the knights around him stood still to avoid offending him. If they did something that displeased him, they would be considered as a ‘prey’ by him who was still in a sensitive and blood-driven state. They could very well lose their pathetic little lives.</p>
<p>A light thud resounded as Noah threw the wet towel on the ground and walked straight towards the tent. As he was about to enter, he saw someone running towards it. Barehanded, Noah reached out to his sword to deal with the coming intruder.</p>
<p>But he stopped as the scent of flowers wafted out in an instant. A familiar face was visible through the light brown hair that fluttered softly from the wind.</p>
<p>He was dumbstruck for a few seconds, then he hesitantly asked.</p>
<p>“…Adele?”</p>
