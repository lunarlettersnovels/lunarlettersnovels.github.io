            <p>There was only one opportunity. Their physiques are so dissimilar that if this attack fails, she may be injured.</p>
<p>“It appears suspicious. Don’t you agree?”</p>
<p>A man with dangerous eyes approached Freya, his hand clenched. Freya, who was full of spirit, remembered Gemini’s beast-suppressing technique. When there is a size difference, it is thought to be more effective to reach the crucial point.</p>
<p>“We don’t have time, so please leave as soon as possible,” Freya instructed Lottie.</p>
<p>Freya bent down, took a quick step on the wall next to her, drew her dagger, and swung it. Before being prepared for the unexpected attack, the man collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, Lottie.”</p>
<p>“Freya, did you murder someone?”</p>
<p>Lottie had round eyes that watched everything.</p>
<p>“No, I’m a little upset. He’ll be awake in no time.”</p>
<p>When the two people who had crawled over the man’s body arrived safely at the rear door, Archer, who had been waiting, hugged Lottie.</p>
<p>“Then come see Hero, Freya.”</p>
<p>“Please take charge of Lottie, Archer.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Lottie appeared to be smaller in Archer’s arms. Freya couldn’t stop crying at the sight. It was like seeing Lottie when she was younger and asking her to carry her leg on her back. She quietly opened her mouth and wiped her eyes with her sleeve.</p>
<p>“Come on, hurry on.”</p>
<p>It was similar to previously, but Lottie was about to say something to a different landscape when her carriage came. She heard a familiar voice from behind her as she gazed at the carriage in which the two people were riding.</p>
<p>“Shall we then go?”</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>I’m not sure what Hero did, but there was a shambles inside.</p>
<p>“It’s not a genuine fire, but it will appear that way to them.”</p>
<p>“What about money?”</p>
<p>“Without a doubt. You can’t spend so much gold on the royal wizard’s wages.”</p>
<p>The two people in the prepared carriage were allowed to leave in the state they were in. Freya removed her hat as they sat face-to-face. She was sweating profusely because she was so frightened. Hero, who was standing nearby, inquired.</p>
<p>“By the way, you used a sword.” She cleaned the blood off the dagger, but the stench of fishy blood lingered. Her hands remained hidden in her sleeves, but her lips trembled.</p>
<p>“I hoped I wouldn’t have to use it.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright if you’re not hurt.”</p>
<p>Freya nodded silently in response to Hero’s remarks. Hero nodded all the way, possibly because she did something she shouldn’t have done. Freya’s eyes were bright red as she glanced out the window.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The party led by Lucius, which had gone to the outskirts, was on its way back. Through the dense dust, Gemini came to Lucius’ aid.</p>
<p>“Your Highness the Crown Prince, the horses are fatigued and require some rest.”</p>
<p>Because they were in a hurry, both the horse and the soldier appeared exhausted. Lucius nodded, hating himself for his lack of sensitivity.</p>
<p>“We are taking an hour off here.”</p>
<p>He wanted to go back to the palace immediately, no matter what. He requested Freya from Hero and Archer, but he couldn’t relax. It was especially true when things were as twisted up as they were today.</p>
<p><em>But I can sort everything out in a minute, Freya.</em></p>
<p>It was an obvious reason to deal with what happened on the outskirts.</p>
<p>“No one will suspect that I purposefully caused a commotion.”</p>
<p>He needed a compelling reason to leave the palace.</p>
<p>It was always odd that Milady, who had little power, had such widespread support.</p>
<p>Milady used to be like a rumor, but she finally got proof that the wizard and knight she hired were who they said they were.</p>
<p>It is said that everyone who violated the queen’s orders was executed.</p>
<p>There was no family that vanished owing to a dark magic wizard and a sword wielded by a knight who had no one see his face, and the imperial family grabbed all of their stuff.</p>
<p>It was employed to dress up the superior empress rather than the imperial household.</p>
<p>Furthermore, few people are willing to discuss the rumor right now. People were more on the side of the loyal followers of the empress than of the crazy crown prince. Lucius’ only followers were mainly impoverished and powerless communities.</p>
<p><em>Count Edelion, like a bat, is ineffective.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t too much of an exaggeration to say that Count Edelion was the most powerful person in the south, but he was still a very interesting person. Selena’s work was also excellent. Didn’t the two, who had sworn allegiance to Lucius until yesterday, kneel in front of Hart overnight?</p>
<p>“The north is where I should concentrate my efforts.”</p>
<p>The majority of the empire was centered in the north. And he has the Count of Diverto in the north. Even though power has changed a lot in the past few years, the Diverto family was at the top of their game. Following the sad catastrophe, he engaged in a minimal outside activity. In fact, he didn’t appear to care who was on the throne. Lucius, on the other hand, has always kept his genuine feelings hidden from him.</p>
<p><em>The crucial question is whether Count Diverto will be my guy.</em></p>
<p>They have amassed sufficient force to depose the empress. He trained each group of soldiers separately, trying to avoid other people’s eyes while pretending to kill the enemy who had sneaked into the perimeter. Lucius disposed of all of his mother’s southern holdings in the process.</p>
<p><em>I, too, am well prepared, Your Highness.</em></p>
