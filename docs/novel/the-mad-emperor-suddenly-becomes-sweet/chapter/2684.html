            <p>The emperor, surrounded by his advisors, was failing in his duties. Instead of providing aid to farmers suffering from a poor harvest, he was exploiting them.</p>
<p>“Of course, Your Majesty may not be aware,” Herro acknowledged.</p>
<p>The emperor’s orders were carried out by the nobles who governed each territory, and it was believed that such cruelty would diminish if Lucius became the emperor. Herro believed that Lucius, who had been a passive observer until now, would be just, if not kind.</p>
<p>“Therefore, we need the support of Count Edelion even more,” Hero continued.</p>
<p>Securing Edelion’s support was crucial to consolidating power more efficiently and rapidly.</p>
<p>“Let’s discuss this further next time, Hero,” Lucius said.</p>
<p>Hero’s mind was preoccupied with thoughts of Freya, and he felt like his head was about to explode. He was unfamiliar with relationships and love stories.</p>
<p>His heart was overflowing with emotions for her, making it difficult for him to focus on anything else. This feeling was a hindrance at a time when he was facing major challenges.</p>
<p>“For the sake of the Empire and for the mother who was wrongfully taken from us.” He managed to compose himself and put on a hunting tweed jacket, while Hero cast a spell for protection.</p>
<p>“This time, we must not harm His Highness Dokdo,” he said with determination, though he knew there was no such thing as a foolproof defense. He added, looking serious, “If you feel it’s dangerous, Your Highness, it’s best to stay away.”</p>
<p>“Hero, I won’t get hurt or die before I finish all this,” came the reply from Lucius, who was not one to shy away from danger. He had already faced death multiple times in the past.</p>
<p>Hart and Selena’s engagement was announced in a public ceremony. Congratulatory messages filled the air as people wished them a happy union.</p>
<p>“To celebrate the engagement of His Majesty, Emperor Hart, and my daughter, I have released a hundred foxes for your entertainment,” said Count Edelion, who had put on more weight than ever before, as he flaunted his wealth to the attending nobles. Most of the nobles were dressed in hunting attire, but Lucius, the main event, looked grim and out of place.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, the Crown Prince, why don’t you smile a little?” Selena asked, noticing his solemn expression on what was supposed to be a joyous occasion.</p>
<p>“You must be in the mood for a laugh,” he replied with a forced smile, making Selena’s face twitch.</p>
<p>“Do you think this engagement is happening because you actually like me?” she asked, her mood dampened by the sight of Lucius and Miss De Bua on the other side. She wondered if she was making a huge mistake, but it was too late to turn back now.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, we are not in a position to do as we please,” Lucius said, reminding her of the limitations they faced.</p>
<p>Selena spoke firmly to the unyielding reality. She had hoped that her fiancé would recognize that it was not the right time for such a lament.</p>
<p>“Adelion, please drop the formalities,” she said.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, the Crown Prince, you must fulfill your duties,” Hart replied.</p>
<p>“That’s exactly why I dislike them.”</p>
<p>Hart glanced over at his mother, who was sitting at the head of the table with a smile on her face and tugged on the reins of his horse.</p>
<p>“Where are you going, Your Highness?” asked Selena.</p>
<p>“I think I’ve done enough for today,” Hart replied, feeling frustrated with being treated like a puppet without a will of his own. He never wanted to attend this absurd engagement, but his mother had forced him to come after causing a commotion about her own illness.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, Your Highness, let’s go together,” Selena said, not wanting to be left alone.</p>
<p>In the cool corner of the hunting grounds, Lucius was fidgeting the entire time. He was constantly monitored by Freya during the ceremony. He leaned in and whispered to her while keeping his head lowered.</p>
<p>“Freya, I’m sorry I frightened you that night,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” she replied.</p>
<p>Lucius had no interest in Hart’s grand engagement. All he could think about was Freia and the chill that emanated from her. It was risky to express his feelings openly like this, but he couldn’t help his impatience.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, the hunt is about to begin,” someone announced.</p>
<p>“Freya, please,” Lucius begged.</p>
<p>Freya refused to look at him until the end. At a time like this, he wondered if the hunt was truly important. However, as a man of royal standing, Lucius knew that he had to put his personal feelings aside at times.</p>
<p>Bang, bang, bang, bang! The sound of the hunt echoed through the air.</p>
