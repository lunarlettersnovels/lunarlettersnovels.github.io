            <p>In fact, it was Lucius, not Freya, who was sympathetic. Freya’s eyes were clear as she looked at Lucius when they first met in the attic of the orphanage.</p>
<p>He gave her a warm look. In the attic, where there was no warmth, Freya shared the embers that could keep her going with Lucius.</p>
<p>“I remember the day you covered me with a shawl,” Lucius said with a sigh.</p>
<p>There were numerous holes, making it unrecognizable as a shawl. Freia remembered the time when he covered a child who appeared to have fallen asleep and quickly made his way to the kitchen. The creaking of the old stairs and the blonde hair that brushed against the light filtering through the dusty window were visible.</p>
<p>“Freya was already an adult by then.”</p>
<p>With chaos reigning all around, Frey had no time to dwell on his emotions.</p>
<p>“You have been my love ever since,” Lucius proclaimed.</p>
<p>“Stop saying that,” Freya replied, looking down and attempting to conceal the truth while teasing Lucius.</p>
<p>If Lucius’ feelings were genuine, the situation would become even more complicated.</p>
<p>“Did everything go as planned?” the queen, seated in a wagon instead of on a horse, asked as she sipped from a glass of alcohol. The man beside her nodded.</p>
<p>“He’s quite the tough guy,” he remarked.</p>
<p>Lucius was immune to Michael’s magic, so classical methods had to be employed to eliminate him. Michael sent a spray, poisoned it, and set it afire.</p>
<p>“It’s remarkable that you don’t die even with that,” the empress commented.</p>
<p>This was almost the final opportunity. Hart was safely engaged, and the emperor had only one day left to live.</p>
<p>“I’m fed up with his veins,” the man sighed.</p>
<p>Milady was born as an illegitimate child, but she was fortunate to have inherited her last name. Although she was initially acquired with the intention of selling her, she managed to secure a position as a maid in the palace.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it truly unjust, Michael?” she asked the man who understood her better than anyone else.</p>
<p>“That’s how the world works,” he replied.</p>
<p>An illegitimate child born into a wizard family, he displayed exceptional talent but was cast out due to his impure blood.</p>
<p>“Your blood is not pure, so it is not suitable for our family,” he was told.</p>
<p>“But thanks to you, I was able to meet a better teacher,” he said to Michael.</p>
<p>“Yes, it was good for both of us. Had you not been cast out, we would never have met,” Michael agreed.</p>
<p>Milady continued, recalling the emperor, who was unable to attend due to illness.</p>
<p>“Yes. What had been prepared for the day?”</p>
<p>“A classic trick had also been prepared,” replied Michael as he smiled faintly, recalling the deep pit and the bear trap he had left in the forest. For those who don’t work magic, it was enough to treat them accordingly.</p>
<p>“Tom was waiting in the woods,” added Michael.</p>
<p>“That sounds interesting,” said Milady. “By the way, what happened the other day?”</p>
<p>“Tom handled it himself,” replied Michael.</p>
<p>“Oh my, it’s not time for me to drink. Stop the wagon. I need to go to the hunting ground too,” said Milady, feeling light as if she had taken a headache pill.</p>
<p>The deeper the conversation went, the more the misunderstanding between the two grew. Lucius couldn’t figure out what to say when he realized it.</p>
<p>“I need to hunt,” said Lucius.</p>
<p>Freya, unable to stand the stuffy atmosphere, jumped to her feet and said, “Let’s go together.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine, I’ll take the escort,” replied Lucius, but before he could catch her, she got on a horse and left.</p>
<p>“I’m going after Miss De Bua right now,” thought Lucius, unable to let her go with such anxious eyes. “What if they all fall down?”</p>
<p>Lucius, who couldn’t even put on his jacket, immediately urged the horse.</p>
<p>Freya was not good at horseback riding, so it was impossible for her to ride the horse in a hurry. “Oh my,” she gasped, trying to slow down a little.</p>
<p>“Why is there no one?” Freya wondered, thinking that the escort sent was following her when they started.</p>
<p>“Did I run that fast?” Freya finally wiped the sweat off her forehead with one hand as she caressed the horse, which began to run slowly.</p>
<p>“I’ve done enough now,” thought Freya, realizing that was the limit.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you to make such a confession,” Freya thought.</p>
