            <p>With one hand, Lucius stroked Freya’s cheek.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you didn’t recognize me sooner.”</p>
<p>“Don’t keep saying strange stuff. Hero’s medicine for me today must have been strange.”</p>
<p>She was terrified of him since he continued saying strange things, but Freya mumbled, unable to get away from him because of the rain hammering on the window. Why would he say that?</p>
<p>something like that?</p>
<p>It wasn’t that she didn’t think they resembled each other.</p>
<p>Ruth was a younger child whom she met in an orphanage. This didn’t make sense, despite Freya’s lack of growth since then.</p>
<p>“Please hear my story.”</p>
<p>Lucius continued, one hand gently caressing her back.</p>
<p>“I mean. “I’ve been through a lot in my life.”</p>
<p>Freya naturally nodded in response to his comments. She didn’t notice Lucius spitting blood just once or twice.</p>
<p>“The worst was when someone set fire to the room I was sleeping in and then shut the door.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my goodness.”</p>
<p>It indicated he was going to kill Lucius. Even she, who thought she knew how nasty humans could become, was taken aback.</p>
<p>“I narrowly escaped thanks to Hero and Gemini.”</p>
<p>When the awful feeling he had that night returned, he shivered in rage for a brief period. He hid his life in the orphanage where Freya was kept.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t my intended destination, but you saved me, I was dying in the orphanage that day.”</p>
<p>The medication’s negative effects nearly killed me.</p>
<p>“But Lou, Ruth…” It was surely easy for Hero to change the color of his eyes.</p>
<p>It was impossible to avoid the empress’s eyes with blue eyes like the emperor. However, he stated that it was his first time controlling his age.</p>
<p>“……No way.”</p>
<p>It was difficult to explain their first meeting if Lucius was Ruth.</p>
<p>“They were clearly unfamiliar eyes.”</p>
<p>“That’s correct. As a side effect of the medicine, I went back to how I used to be. Because I attempted too much magic, I lost some memory and developed sleeplessness. Hero persevered, but he had no recollection of what happened there.</p>
<p>Freya, who emerged one day, was vexing, and Lucius couldn’t stop thinking about her. He was curious as to why he was experiencing this sensation. The longer he remained with Freya, the more perplexed he grew.</p>
<p>“I thought I forgot about you, but I guess I never did.”</p>
<p>It was for this reason that he attempted, even if it was against his will, to keep Freya by his side.</p>
<p>“Why me, why me?”</p>
<p>When she tried to ask if he had come to pick her up, she closed her mouth. He claimed to have lost his memory.</p>
<p><em>Ruth might as well not return.</em></p>
<p>She claimed, but in reality, she had spent the entire time waiting for Ruth. To be honest, she had been attempting to ignore reality out of fear of being even sadder.</p>
<p>“You may blame me, Freya.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean it, Your Highness, Ruth?”</p>
<p>Lucius stroked Freya’s bangs with his large palm as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Please, Freya, never do this again.” I guarantee it.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t question Lucius’ words any longer. His eyes changed color, and he expanded significantly, yet he was certain he was Ruth.</p>
<p>“Oh, my goodness.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know it was Ruth, but all the feelings she had hidden for Lucius came out at once. She couldn’t take her gaze away from His Majesty. Lucius is a self-centered and secretive man. Half of the reason she didn’t flee was that she was with him, which could have put her in danger.</p>
<p>“Because when I was with you, my memory naturally recovered.”</p>
<p>“You should have stated it in the middle, then.”</p>
<p>Freya raised her voice without realizing she was speaking casually.</p>
<p>After hearing it, she thought of a lot of unfair things. After all, she had no idea what Ruth was like. After all, she had no idea what Ruth was like. That Lucius is Ruth, the missing crown prince.</p>
<p>She knew nothing, but she liked Ruth. She was very concerned about him. The same might be said for Lucius. It wasn’t the same as her sentiments for Ruth, but she couldn’t deny that she was drawn to him.</p>
<p>“Nothing has changed, Freya.”</p>
<p>That appears to be illogical. It’s not that nothing has changed, but the world around her has been turned upside down.</p>
<p>“You betrayed me.”</p>
<p>The blurry eyes went down, and the dry lips trembled.</p>
<p>It made no difference when you discovered the memory. It’s the same reason he didn’t tell her.</p>
<p>“I was attempting to keep it a secret because I was scared it would put you in danger.”</p>
<p>“However, why are you informing me now?”</p>
<p>Freya couldn’t comprehend what he was saying.</p>
<p>“The empress is perilous.” “You are familiar with that.”</p>
<p>It would be hard to keep the empress in check while dealing with a mountain of work for the position of her successor. Also, it will be harder if he tells her that he is Ruth, an orphanage friend she met.</p>
<p>It would have been easier to conceal such vexing issues.</p>
<p>Freya was even more perplexed after hearing his confession.</p>
<p>“It felt as though even the experiences that I remembered like a spring day had been snatched from my humble life.” “Take a look at my face, Freya.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Please let me go.”</p>
<p>Freya stepped out of his arms and looked Lucius in the eyes—a man who made one’s heart flutter and the one who betrayed her.</p>
<p>“How enjoyable it must have been.”</p>
<p>She ran into him again, although briefly, at the orphanage. She would have been suitable for use if she had no background. She did all she intended to do but acted carelessly.</p>
<p>“And you offered me that type of deal from the start.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t have done that if she wasn’t a noblewoman or had parents. She used to have no family and nothing, but was there ever a sad day like today? She was dissatisfied because every word from Lucius made her tremble like a reed in front of the wind.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even look funny.” Freya stood up and shook her shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’m going back now.”</p>
<p>Lucius reached out his hand again, embarrassed by her chilly demeanor.</p>
<p>“Freya, please hear my story.”</p>
<p>Her hands were shaking when she turned her back, and she had to grip the other wrist with one hand. Lucius was clearly the reason for her detention. Freya grinned coldly as she examined her wrist.</p>
<p>The Morciani Empire’s Crown Prince must marry. His ancestors, whose children were valuable, said that the crown prince would not do well if he did not get married. So she created a fictional character named Freya de Bua.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua was not her; she was someone who could never be her.” Isn’t it impossible to play a nobleman who doesn’t exist at the start of Del Mundo?</p>
<p>The chilly green eyes peered at the closed door, where no light was leaking in. Is he still attempting to apprehend Freya or Miss De Bua of Del Mundo?</p>
<p>As she visualized the two people on the scale, she smiled dryly. It was a problem that she didn’t have to deal with right away.</p>
<p>Freya, who was born and raised in an orphanage, is an outcast among the crown prince’s subjects. A passing dog would be aware of this information.</p>
<p>“Don’t be concerned.” I’m sure I’ll keep the deal.”</p>
<p>At the end of the sentence, she headed straight to the door and never looked back until she returned to the room.</p>
