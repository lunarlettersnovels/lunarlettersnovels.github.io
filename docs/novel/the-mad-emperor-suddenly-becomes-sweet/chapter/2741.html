            <p>Freya was squatting in the corner of her new room.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t it a dream?</em></p>
<p>No matter how deep she took a breath, she couldn’t calm down. It was strange to enter the palace, dressed up in a beautiful gown and attending the banquet.</p>
<p><em>More, I saw His Majesty the Emperor and the Empress.</em></p>
<p>Even if she told Archer later, she wouldn’t believe it. However, it was clear that it was not a dream when she looked at her twisted heels because of her shoes.</p>
<p>“Are you saying this is de Bua’s room?”</p>
<p>She looked around the room with her beautifully dressed hair tangled.</p>
<p>White lace was fluttering along the pillar on the slope of the bed. It was just amazing that such a lace could run on the bed.</p>
<p>“I won’t be able to sleep in this huge bed.”</p>
<p>Freya wrapped her head with her hands and put her forehead on her knee. Sweeping her neck with her hand, she opened her mouth roughly.</p>
<p>“If I had clothes to change, I would have taken them off right away.”</p>
<p>However, her comfortable clothes disappeared somewhere. She opened the closet filled with colorful dresses a hundred times more than this.</p>
<p>“Wooooh.”</p>
<p>She had imagined a closet like this when she was very young. A closet was full of her dress, not a perforated dress from someone.</p>
<p>“But why do I feel so messed up?”</p>
<p>Freya thought she would be happy if she had only cake and gold, but maybe that’s not it. Her eyes were watery as she was touching the hem of the dress.</p>
<p>Time went by, but she couldn’t get rid of the feeling of something stuck in her throat.</p>
<p>“It’s suffocating.”</p>
<p>Freya raised her hand and pounded her chest. However, she was heavy, as if she had an upset stomach.</p>
<p>“I should get some fresh air.”</p>
<p>Freya, who stood up, pulled the door to the balcony. She leaned slightly against the railing a little higher than her waist. The palace garden, which was overlooking the second floor, was fantastic. The well-groomed flower beds and lights everywhere sparkled like fireflies.</p>
<p>“It’s like magic.”</p>
<p>What unfolded in front of her was a world that she didn’t even know existed. But soon, the impression was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>“It’s not the time for me to admire this beautiful scenery.”</p>
<p>The cold night breeze passed by her cheek and soon penetrated between the thin saliva.</p>
<p>“It’s quite cold.”</p>
<p>But she didn’t want to enter the room with a large bed because it was so awkward. She missed the floor where the sound of Archer’s snoring rang loudly, and trash was rolling around.</p>
<p>“Archer is probably sleeping somewhere over there, too.”</p>
<p>Lucius caught a faint smile on Freya’s lips as she looked far away.</p>
<p>She thinks she has grown quite attached to him.</p>
<p>“Ha! What will happen to me in the future?”</p>
<p>She wanted to buy a small house with a garden if she collected a few gold coins. <em>Was that such a big desire?</em></p>
<p>“I feel so creepy here.”</p>
<p>Life here was more challenging than expected. Lucius said it was not difficult at all, but it was unbelievable. She still recalls how the empress stares at her. She scratched her head, thinking of the empress showing hostility to her earlier. Something similar like this happened before.</p>
<p>“Oh! That’s right. It feels similar to Sophia.”</p>
<p>When she spit out the words, she looked depressed.</p>
<p><em>It’s terrible to have someone like that again.</em></p>
<p>There was something else that disturbed her head.</p>
<p>“Why does his highness keep doing this to me?”</p>
<p>After that intense first meeting, she kept getting involved with Lucius. She became his servant, and that’s why she’s here.</p>
<p><em>It is all because of you, Lucius.</em></p>
<p>However, his appearance in the cornfield was still vivid in her mind. The pale cheeks covered with blood and a beautiful smile were in front of her.</p>
<p>“It’s because we’re so close these days.”</p>
<p>Otherwise, there was no reason to feel this way.</p>
<p>Freya sat on the railing and hugged her head. Because she didn’t eat anything all day, her stomach was growling, but somehow she didn’t have any appetite.</p>
<p>“Did I become a noble lady? That’s funny.”</p>
<p>Freya rubbed her shoulders with both hands and slowly walked into the bedroom. The food that was left untouched on the table remained the same.</p>
<p>“Hmmm…When did I fall asleep?”</p>
<p>Freya, who stretched while leaning on the sofa, muttered. When the morning sun came in, the bedroom sparkled even more.</p>
<p>“I was pondering and starved.”</p>
<p>She picked up the bread she had left yesterday and bit it when someone knocked on the door.</p>
<p>“Lady, your Highness Lucius is here.”</p>
<p><em>What is he doing here?</em></p>
<p>Freya looked everywhere, but Lucius, wearing a red cape, walked into the room.</p>
<p>“You’re very adaptable.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Only then did she realize that she was standing holding the bread. As Freya quickly hid it behind her back, he strode up and opened the window.</p>
<p>“I’m going to be very busy from today.”</p>
<p>“And so?”</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with her whether he is busy or not.</p>
<p>When Freya answered half-heartedly, he twisted his lips.</p>
<p>“I’m not alone, and you’re going with me.”</p>
<p>“Why me? I only needed to be next to you.”</p>
<p>“I think you need to reread the contract?”</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>Thanks to Lucius, who threatened her again in the early morning, her dim eyes opened wide. Standing with his back against the open window, Lucius stared at her and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“You think it was as easy as standing like a statue next to me? Of course, that’s not it, Freya.”</p>
<p>Freya was angry to the tip of her head at his sly words.</p>
<p>“Why you’re always doing this to me?”</p>
<p>“You should have expected it first when I asked you to act as my fiancee.”</p>
<p>Lucius, looking at her angrily, swept her lips with his index finger. Freya was speechless at his trivial gesture.</p>
