            <p>Freya felt sorry for Lucius when she saw him sitting in the banquet hall and drinking wine with a sad face. So she went over to him. “Your Highness, come here,” she said, holding out her hand.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just stay here a little while?” She encouraged him to dance with her, even though she knew it would be a waste of her practice. “Get up quickly. “My hands hurt,” she said, with a determined look on her face.</p>
<p>Relieved, Lucius got up, and the two of them went to the center of the banquet hall to dance. Freya noticed that Lucius seemed to be looking at her with an odd expression and asked, “Why do you look at me with such an odd face?” Lucius replied, “No, it seems like this happened,” referring to their dance.</p>
<p>Freya smiled and thought back to the time she used her imagination while living in an orphanage. She realized that both then and now, it was her that reached out to help Lucius when he was feeling down. Lucius knew he had to look strong in front of his enemies, but as they danced, he couldn’t help but think about the beautiful music he made up in his head instead of the melody played by the court musicians.</p>
<p>“A night of lakes, breaking moonlight, mint scents, and flushed red cheeks.” That night, Lucius almost stole a kiss from Freya, whose lips were shaking as she closed her eyes. With the song playing that night, she was completely inebriated.</p>
<p>Freya realized that the dance that had bothered her during practice was actually quite interesting. Wearing a beautiful dress, Freya was led around the banquet hall by Lucius’ hand and felt hypnotized. “You’re looking good tonight,” he said. It was also fun to look at Lucius’ sharp jawline, which was usually distant. “Freya, you dance well,” he said. “I usually learn everything quickly,” she replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Lucius secretly wanted to hear compliments and started to flirt with Freya. She looked coy as she approached him, holding his hand tightly. “Freya, I guess you’re not afraid of me,” Lucius said, looking into her eyes. “Why are your eyes like that all of a sudden?” Freya asked. Lucius, who held her tightly in his arms, said grimly. He hated the idea of Pierre being Freya’s dance instructor and secretly wished that the young and handsome man would quit. “I told you there was no other man,” Freya said. “Mr. Pierre will be deceived when he hears it. He’s been devoted to his work,” Lucius replied.</p>
<p>As they began to spray cool air all over their bodies, there was no one left around them. “Oh, I should stop dancing now,” Freya said, trying to release Lucius’ hand. But just as they tried to look comfortable, someone popped up around them. It was Hart in a dress suit, with disheveled hair and wrinkles. “Oh, my God! Do I have to dance with Lucius again?” Freya thought to herself.</p>
<p>“Can I have this lady for a dance?” Prince Hart asked, holding out his hand to Freya. Lucius, who was looking around at Hart’s request, soon backed down, barely hiding his disapproval. Freya, who was walking around the banquet hall holding Prince Hart’s hand, had a low voice. “Prince Hart,” she said. “Thank you, huh? It felt like saving a princess trapped in a tower,” Hart replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Freya felt uncomfortable with his words but didn’t know how to respond. “It’s okay. It’s customary to dance together like this,” Hart added. “No wonder you look different today,” he whispered as he watched her, carefully decorated from head to toe. “If I were you, I would have given you a more colorful crown, necklace, and bracelet,” he said.</p>
<p>Freya’s eyes became uncomfortable, so she quickly changed the subject. “Well, you’re engaged, congratulations,” she said. “Oh, that. It’s not me, it’s my mother and the Adelion family,” Hart replied with a bitter tone.</p>
<p>As they danced, Freya happened to see Lucius and Selena walking around the center of the banquet hall. The two’s expressions couldn’t be confirmed, but Freya couldn’t take her gaze away from their appearance of being together like water. She couldn’t help but think that Selena looked good in her golden dress, overflowing with natural elegance. The jewelry wrapped around her wrist and neck, and the small tiara on her head, were completely different from hers.</p>
<p>Freya realized that Selena, who was born a noble and grew up beautifully, could not be the same as her. She had already stopped comparing herself to others and knew the feeling of comparison was a pest that ate at her heart. The memory of feeling cold and hungry with an empty stomach came back to her, and it felt like her body hardened.</p>
