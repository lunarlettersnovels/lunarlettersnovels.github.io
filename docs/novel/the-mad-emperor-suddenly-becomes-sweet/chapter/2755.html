            <p>Herro’s voice was so small that she couldn’t hear him. That moment, the fire in the fireplace was blinking like it was going out and someone approached him.</p>
<p>“Herro, the fire in the fireplace went out, what should I do?”</p>
<p>“Do you need my help?”</p>
<p>Herro smiled warmly then at the tip of his fingers came a red light and the logs went out started to burn again.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>The lady that was cooking porridge on a big pot kept bowing at him. Freya was reminded that Herro is a wizard whenever something like this happened.</p>
<p>“Wow! Herro, you’re so amazing.”</p>
<p>Herro waved his hands with his cheeks blushing from her compliment.</p>
<p>“Just a low talent.”</p>
<p>There was almost no one that didn’t get his help in this barracks. He was good at making potions to heal the casualties, and his ability to handle water and fire was exceptional.</p>
<p>“But you’re a Grand Wizard!”</p>
<p>Herro’s cheeks would not calm at her constant compliment.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“So sick of it.”</p>
<p>Herro, after throwing the white cape he was wearing, spoke in a cold tone, unlike his normal tone. The kind and red eyes grew cold. He didn’t forget to glance back before going to his secret space inside the tent.</p>
<p>As he flicked his fingers, his place that was sleeping in dark got a little brighter. There were unknown animals and herbs everywhere.</p>
<p>“You’re pathetic, Herro.”</p>
<p>Herro sighed deeply after opening the book he’s been writing for a few years.</p>
<p>Herro was the firstborn son of the family that produced many great wizards, including Elymus. His grandfather and father were all called Grand Wizard, but for some odd reason, Herro’s magic power wasn’t so strong when he was young.</p>
<p><em>I appointed Herro Elymus as Crown Prince Lucius Morciani’s personal wizard.</em></p>
<p>This was usually for wizards that came to age. There was a great scheme behind such an outrageous reality.</p>
<p>Milady, who became the Queen after pushing out the previous Queen, looked down on Lucius, who was being protected by young Herro and Gemini.</p>
<p><em>She probably thought we were three weak children.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t a farfetched idea, but there was one thing Milady missed. The reason why Herro’s magic power was measured low was that there was no crystal ball that can properly measure his ability.</p>
<p><em>But I’m still lacking.</em></p>
<p>Herro’s face got darker as he was brushing the outskirt of the book.</p>
<p>The Emperor ignored how his son was being threatened with poison and assassination attempts every night. Gemini and Herro had to perform over their ability to protect their master.</p>
<p><em>Milady is so evil.</em></p>
<p>As the Emperor went to a spa for medical purposes, she clogged the door and the windows of Lucius’s room and started a fire. It was to kill Lucius, who was a thorn in her eyes. Three of them desperately tried to make an exit, but it was no use.</p>
<p><em>I don’t think this will work.</em></p>
<p>Herro, who had strong power but couldn’t control it, had to decide.</p>
<p><em>Your Majesty, we can’t run away right away.</em></p>
<p>There was blood streaming down on Gemini’s hand as he swung his sword at the door to open it. Lucius’s face was mixed with giving up and anger. He handed a wet towel to Herro and spoke.</p>
<p><em>I will not forget you for trying your best.</em></p>
<p>He saw it in the middle of the smoking-room. Herro couldn’t handle his anger. Lucius should’ve become the Emperor no matter who said.</p>
<p><em>I pledged to Diana as I became His Majesty’s wizard.</em></p>
<p>To give his master the crown no matter what…..</p>
<p>“Why am I remembering such terrible memory?”</p>
<p>He ominously whispered.</p>
<p>He had to do his best as Lucius’s personal wizard.</p>
<p>That was his reason and everything for living.</p>
<p>He straightened his back on the chair, lifted his long sleeves, and ominously mumbled incarnation. As he did, a black symbol appeared on his wrist and his body became twisted.</p>
<p>“Lucius can wear the crown if I hold on a bit longer.”</p>
<p>As his long nail stabbed on top of the symbol, the blackish-red blood started to spill. An unknown spell kept coming out of his spell, and Herro’s red eyes became completely black.</p>
<p>“Hm….”</p>
<p>As he was panting in pain, someone’s voice went across his ears.</p>
<p><em>Herro, you’re amazing.</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve never seen a wizard before.</em></p>
<p><em>Does it hurt to perform magic?</em></p>
<p>The green eyes that smiled like a child just at a small light shown at the fingertip were reminded. He smiled unintentionally and at that moment a bigger pain came upon him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Thick darkness came upon the northern forest.</p>
<p>Freya took out the sword she cleaned and cleaned it again, and fixed the shield again. As she had nothing to do, she rolled up the carpet on the floor and wiped the floor.</p>
<p>“Freya. I can’t breathe because of the dust.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who was writing a message leaning again the table, spoke as he stared at her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I feel like I should start preparing now.”</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>The army to defend and the fixing of the fence on the border was almost done. Now Lucius will be returning to the castle tomorrow.</p>
<p>“I’m tired.”</p>
<p>Lucius put down the pen and took off his glasses as he spoke in a low tone.</p>
<p>“…..!”</p>
