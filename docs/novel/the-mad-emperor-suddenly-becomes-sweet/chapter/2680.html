            <p>Something strange was felt by Lucius as the noise on the hunting ground decreased. The forest quickly became quiet, as if the tide were rushing. The silence fell, and the guards who followed him fell one by one.</p>
<p>“Oh, was it for this reason?” he muttered.</p>
<p>The knights said they could not attend the hunt in the name of protecting the castle. The escort of Freya was lying in the grass as he ran away from the enemy chasing him.</p>
<p>“If they want to touch it, they’ll only touch me,” Lucius said roughly, as arrows poured from the tree like rain.</p>
<p>“Milady, I must compliment you for your persistence,” he said calmly while wielding a sword and striking off the arrow. Lucius held the horse’s bridle firmly with his lips closed. When Freya thought she was in danger, he was in a hurry.</p>
<p><em>I need to save her right now</em>, he thought while running like that, a dark shadow blocked him.</p>
<p>“That’s him,” Lucius said as he stared at the giant man who appeared swinging an ax behind the tree. He jumped off his horse and drew his sword right away. The Knight of the Hart was hired by Milady, and it was the first time Lucius saw the rumored opponent.</p>
<p>The reason why no one has seen the wizard of Emperor Hart is that none of the people who met him survived. The masked giant man swung his axe at Lucius without responding when asked to leave since he was busy. Lucius realized that if he could not defeat the author, he would not be able to go to Freya.</p>
<p>“Then there’s only a head-to-head match,” he said.</p>
<p>The giant swung the axe vigorously at Lucius, who quickly avoided it and aimed at the opponent’s knee with his sword. However, it was not easy to attack because of the opponent’s quick movements despite their large size. The opponent seemed surprised that Lucius had managed to land an unexpected attack.</p>
<p>“Did you think I’d be scared because there’s a scary rumor?” Lucius taunted.</p>
<p>There were endless bizarre rumors about the opponent, such as his taking a bath in blood and licking a sword that stabbed a person with his tongue. The opponent charged at Lucius again at full speed, destroying a tree in the process.</p>
<p>“Oh, my,” Lucius remarked.</p>
<p>He searched for his opponent’s weakness with his sword when a sudden blow hit his ankle and shoulder. The opponent had criticized Lucius for being no different from a local cop, but Lucius was unfazed. Without waiting for an opening, he immediately stabbed the opponent’s chest with his sword, bringing a sudden end to the fight.</p>
<p>“Uh…” the opponent groaned before falling to the ground with a thud, and the earth shook a little. Lucius approached and drew his sword from his opponent’s chest. It was unpleasant to see the life escape from the opponent’s eyes. He whistled for his horse, which soon appeared. However, getting on the horse was difficult because of his injuries.</p>
<p>Gemini and the soldiers appeared and shouted for Lucius, informing him of the news.</p>
<p>“Your Highness! Your Highness!”</p>
<p>Lucius instructed Gemini to keep the surroundings clean, but Gemini expressed concern over his deep wound.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. This is nothing,” Lucius reassured Gemini.</p>
<p>Despite his injury, Lucius insisted on staying behind to handle the situation, leaving Gemini and the soldiers behind.</p>
<p>“Go back to the palace quickly,” Freya suggested.</p>
<p>Lucius hesitated, struggling to move with his injury. Freya wanted to avoid being alone with him, but her concern for his well-being overrode her reservations.</p>
<p>“I think it’s better to avoid this position for now,” Lucius suggested.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Freya agreed.</p>
<p>It was dangerous to be exposed and unprotected even when there were no threats left, and yet they found themselves in that very situation. As they trudged along, Lucius asked,</p>
<p>“But where are we going?”</p>
<p>“If you go a little bit from here, it’s near the lake we went to together last time,” Freya replied.</p>
<p>Lucius’s words made her frown, but they had no choice. Freya quickly helped him up on the horse, and together they made their way down the forest path. Lucius’ moaning mingled with the sound of grass bugs as they rode.</p>
<p>“We’ve arrived,” Freya announced when they reached their destination. She quickly stretched out her arms to help Lucius get off his horse. As they pushed through the door hidden in the bushes, a small house full of cold air came into view.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” Freya said. She put Lucius in bed and quickly made a fire, looking around as she did so.</p>
<p>“Look at the wound,” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s all right. This has always happened,” Lucius replied.</p>
<p>Observing the situation, Freya realized that he was Ruth. Ruth always tried her best not to show it when he got hurt.</p>
<p>“I’ll pour a little bit of alcohol,” she said, and when she poured alcohol from the small drawing room below his knees, Lucius’s mouth burst into an unbearable moan.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden…</p>
<p>“Can you say it’s okay after watching this?” Freya asked.</p>
<p>It was hard to believe that they had made it this far, especially when Freya saw the flesh near Lucius’s ankle, which was clearly dug out, with a small piece of commendation embedded. Every move must have been painful. “We have to get that out,” she said.</p>
<p>However, Freya did not dare to do such treatment soberly. She gulped down a bottle of wine in her mouth, and when Lucius tried to protest, she silenced him with a sharp “Shut up.”</p>
<p>Lucius looked at his wound with a bewildered gaze, touching his small, round head as he did so.</p>
<p>The sound of firewood burning filled the small building, with no clear distinction between the bedroom and the drawing room. Freia bit her lips tightly as she picked up the tip of the citation piece with her hand, washing it with alcohol.</p>
<p>“Hmm! Be gentle, please be gentle,” Lucius moaned.</p>
<p>“It’s because it’s stuck really hard,” Freya replied.</p>
<p>Unlike in the past, when Lucius was calm even if he was more severely hurt, he now revealed his identity and shook his head hard. Freia focused on her fingertips, trying to ignore his groaning.</p>
<p>“This isn’t easy,” she thought. She had tried her best to escape the pit earlier, but her hands were not properly energized. Lucius screamed as she twisted the piece again.</p>
<p>“If you make such a fuss, I can’t take this out,” she warned.</p>
