        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“You don’t mean that, do you?”</p>
<p>As she swallowed her saliva, she imagined her lover, who had been kissing her like one body at the alley entrance. The lovers whispering love exchanged looks as if they were caressing and swallowing each other.</p>
<p>“Do you mean we have to do what a real couple does?”</p>
<p>After shaking her neck with her hands, she realized that she was wearing a thin needle now. Freya covered her chest with her hands, and the bread fell to the floor.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of doing so.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to break the contract?”</p>
<p>Freya seemed to go crazy over his lousy contract.</p>
<p>“No, Your Highness –”</p>
<p>“I have no intention of rubbing my lips or coveting my body, pretending to be engaged.”‘</p>
<p>She was embarrassed to say one thing together, so her voice kept crawling.</p>
<p>“Why, do you like me or something?”</p>
<p>“…What? That’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“Then what’s the problem? We have to do what we agreed.”</p>
<p>Her voice grew louder because she was so surprised by Lucius’s wild question.</p>
<p>“What? Am I being too complicated? You didn’t mean it at all, did you?”</p>
<p>She supposes to feel that way from his highness.</p>
<p>Freya coughed because she was ashamed of her excessive imagination. Lucius, who approached her, took off his red cloak and put it on her.</p>
<p>“Miss de Bua of Del Mundo, I hope you don’t catch a cold.”</p>
<p>His fingertips touched Freya’s shoulders for a moment. The rude gesture tickled her heart.</p>
<p>“There you go again.”</p>
<p>Lucius made her so angry that she was so affectionate. After a while, he delivered the schedule.</p>
<p>“I’m here for a message.”</p>
<p>Starting today, she is going into severe training. There was no end to horseback riding and beauty based on etiquette, dance, philosophy, art, and music. Freya was out of breath and distracted just by listening.</p>
<p>“How can a woman learn all that? And why would I do that?”</p>
<p>“Why do you think so, Freya?”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll just have to imitate it for months.”</p>
<p>“How can you imitate it? Huh?”</p>
<p>It did make sense to hear that. No matter how discreet you may be, there will be limitations in pretending to be a noble person. Eventually, she could not say anything, but Lucius pulled the rope near the bed.</p>
<p>Soon the bedroom door opened, and the maid appeared.</p>
<p>“I’ve brought what you told me to do.”</p>
<p>The thing on the table was covered with a silver lid; Freya couldn’t tell what it was.</p>
<p>“Open it, Freya,”</p>
<p>It was the sweetest voice I’ve ever heard.</p>
<p><em>I will no longer be swayed by this man, whatever that may be.</em></p>
<p>She gave a dissatisfied look on her face. Lucius reached out to the table and made a curt voice.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what this is, but it’s no use.”</p>
<p>As she opened the lid with a huff, Freya could see its glare.</p>
<p>“Well, uh….”</p>
<p>The thing was covered with sugar-coated and white cream. In an instant, the room was filled with sweet scents. Freya, speechless, stuttered as she watched it.</p>
<p>“Your highness, this is the cake…”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m sorry I’ve been having a hard time since this morning. I’ll take care of you every day.”</p>
<p>“Every day…? I will eat cake every day?”</p>
<p>Receiving this was more exciting to her than meeting the emperor. The emperor and nobles are far from her life, but the cake is right in front of her.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>Freya’s mouth was watering. In other words, Lucius’s words are not wrong. They’ll all come in handy if you learn these things later on.</p>
<p><em>I’m not going to beg for life.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Freya, eager to learn, tightened her fists.</p>
<p>“Somebody told me that there is no end to learning.”</p>
<p>“Sure, sure, taste it for now.”</p>
<p>Lucius held a small silver fork in Freya’s hand.</p>
<p>Freya took her hand out of the red cloak and quickly tasted the cream.</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>Such exclamations came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>The whole body trembled with a completely different feeling from meat. It tasted like milk, soft and sweet. It tasted just like the cake Freya had imagined.</p>
<p>Lucius sighed secretly as he watched Freya enjoy her cake. He pretended to be fine, but he was always nervous when he stood next to her.</p>
<p><em>It’s always a mess.</em></p>
<p>Freya was a precious person to him. He wanted to be nice to her, but it wasn’t easy. Because she keeps trying to get away from him. Freya always looks for a moment and tries to run away. So, he was forced to mention the contract.</p>
<p><em>What a coward!</em></p>
<p>After a long sigh, Lucius smiled faintly at her eating the cake.</p>
