            <p>When he returned to the palace, Lucius was anxious for a moment.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! What am I thinking here?”</p>
<p>The sound of Gemini’s cough managed to get him back to reality. At the banquet hall, he stared at the dagger given by the emperor.</p>
<p>“Is he making fun of me?”</p>
<p>He didn’t expect that the price for his life was so simple. Usually, it was common to receive a sword used by the emperor himself in this case.</p>
<p>“It’s not a big deal.” Lucius sigh.</p>
<p>Milady, who tried to undermine him in front of many people, was even more disgusting. She glared at Lucius with fierce eyes.</p>
<p>“You must know the virtues of successors.”</p>
<p>Lucius recalled the emperor’s promise to him before he left for the frontier.</p>
<p><em>Prince, if you bring your fiancé back after making an outstanding achievement on the periphery, we will have a succession ceremony soon.</em></p>
<p>Lucius wanted to go through due process in ascending to the throne.</p>
<p>“So that the sacrifices of my dead mother will not be wasted.”</p>
<p>But somehow, that day, his hand was trembling towards Freya.</p>
<p><em>I hope Freya doesn’t hold this hand.</em></p>
<p>On the day of the return ceremony, Lucius wished she would kick out the door and run away. At the same time, he desperately wanted her to hold his hand.</p>
<p>“What if my greed hurts you?”</p>
<p>Freya took his hand as soon as he was about to bend his knees in a confused mood. She held his trembling hand tightly in fear of being left alone.</p>
<p>“Cheer up.”</p>
<p>It was as if Freya had been cheering him on without a word spoken. Her warm body temperature brought Lucius back to his senses.</p>
<p>“The play isn’t over yet.”</p>
<p>Lucius soon made the face of the madman.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>How long has it been?</p>
<p>The sunset was out of the window, and she felt a cold wind on her forehead.</p>
<p>“Did I fall asleep?”</p>
<p>As Freya stood up, her lengthy hair fell before her shoulder. As she arranged her tangled hair, Lucius leaned against the door, looking at her.</p>
<p>“…Your Highness?” Freya was surprised by Lucius’ presence.</p>
<p>“Did I wake you up?” Lucius asked.</p>
<p>He slowly approached her and saw it more clearly, taking himself away from the door. The sweat-drenched shirt clung to her body, and her blond hair was everywhere.</p>
<p>“Freya, you look like a noble lady now.”</p>
<p>“That kind of joke is terrible, so stop it.”</p>
<p>Lucius grinned with his green eyes while Freya was crumpling her blue muslin dress.</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing when I’m so angry?”</p>
<p>As he strode closer, Freya took the remaining teacup at the table and gulped it down. She won’t know why she’s so thirsty.</p>
<p>“I’ve been a little far, but..”</p>
<p>Lucius put a small box dangling in his hand before her.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Freya raised her head.</p>
<p>“I promised you.”</p>
<p>When Freya opened the box, there were a lot of carrot-shaped and star-shaped cookies. When she saw the cookies, she felt sorry for swearing at him, so she asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Did you get hurt?”</p>
<p>“…did you worry about me?”</p>
<p>Lucius was perplexed by her questioning him.</p>
<p>“Is it against the rules to worry about your highness?”</p>
<p>In the book of etiquette, there was only a lot of content that this and that was not the law, and she had only learned a little of it yet.</p>
<p>“It’s not that, but because your majesty has gone to get rid of the evil.”</p>
<p>Freya had never seen a demon, but she was sure it was more terrifying than the beast that appeared in the cornfield. When she looked closely, Freya saw something blue splashed on his white shirt, and his pants were torn.</p>
<p>“Are you hurt?”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. Just try it.”</p>
<p>As he stepped closer, he sat down beside Freya. She didn’t want to care about Lucius, but she had to admit that she was glad to see him again.</p>
<p>“He who gives food is always welcome.”</p>
<p>Freya, who hid her red cheeks, gave her poor excuse.</p>
<p>“Did you bring it for me?”</p>
