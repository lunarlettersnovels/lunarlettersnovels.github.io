            <p>He looked proud as he brought an armful of meat and alcohol in both hands.</p>
<p>“What do you say? It’s the house that Prince Lucius bestowed upon me.”</p>
<p>“Oh….”</p>
<p>Freya didn’t want to hear that name all the way here. Archer was clamoring the whole time, even though Freya was being roughly distracted.</p>
<p>“Your Highness has acknowledged my hard work.”</p>
<p>Freya picked up the chicken leg familiarly, listening to Archer, who was excited to show off. When she ate the whole meat without looking around, she felt like her stomach was open.</p>
<p>“You haven’t broken your habit of eating like a pig.”</p>
<p>“Stop nagging me! Do you know how hard I am these days?”</p>
<p>Freya could not remember how many times Francesca had beaten the back of her hand on her first meal tutorial.</p>
<p><em>‘Miss de Bua. Try it as you like.’</em></p>
<p>Freya ate the way she like. She drank with a bamboo bowl, and the meat was held in both hands and opened. The fruit spat out the seeds on the floor. Mrs. Francesca looked at her because she was so quiet that she trembled as if she had seen something she could not see.</p>
<p><em>No matter how freely Del Mundo is, isn’t this too much?</em> She can clearly recall Mars. Francesca said.</p>
<p>Thinking about the situation at that time, the chicken legs Freya was eating were almost indigestion.</p>
<p>“Archer that is unimaginable. Do it like with some manners.”</p>
<p>Freya shook her head and Archer pouted.</p>
<p>“Like this?”</p>
<p>Archer, who was sucking his glass as if he was going to chew it, suddenly lifted it gracefully and took only a bite of alcohol. It looked so aristocratic that Freya’s eyes almost popped out.</p>
<p>“Some might think Archer is a nobleman and be fooled.”</p>
<p>Her words cleared Archer’s jaw and awkwardly swept his beardless chin.</p>
<p>“That’s the thing. Because I’m a nobleman.”</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<p>Freya forgot to chew the meat and looked blank. Archer said he was the eldest son of the baron family.</p>
<p>“A Baron? Come on, don’t joke like that.”</p>
<p>Who can guess that he is an aristocrat when he drinks in the grass and wears clothes full of fleas? This was even more shocking than when Freya saw him change after shaving his beard and hair.</p>
<p>“That’s the thing. I left home a long time ago for some reason.”</p>
<p>He added that he was born an aristocrat, but he is no longer an aristocrat.</p>
<p>“Oh, I shouldn’t have said that.”</p>
<p>He frowned heavily and gulped down the wine.</p>
<p>“Drink slowly. You might fall out of bed again.”</p>
<p>Freya closed her lips and spoke quietly. She could guess a lot from Archer’s expression.</p>
<p>“There’s a secret that everyone can’t tell.”</p>
<p>“Why is your face like death? Drink this. It makes me feel better.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“It’s from the palace, so it’s different from the alcohol I’ve been drinking so far, just moisten your throat.”</p>
<p>He went on to seduce her by shaking the glass. Freya wasn’t curious about the taste, but she couldn’t reach out willingly.</p>
<p><em>Freya, I don’t allow you to take alcohol from now on.</em></p>
<p>The voice of Lucius, who was giving her a firm command over her glasses looking into the document, was vivid.</p>
<p><em>Let me see if I hear that.</em></p>
<p>Freya bit her lips tightly, thinking of him acting like he was going to kiss her.</p>
<p>“Shall we? Even nobles enjoy wine at meals.”</p>
<p>Then a tree, which acts as a door to a small house, creaked and three unexpected customers appeared.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, Lucius!”</p>
<p>Archer threw away his drink and knelt before Lucius.</p>
<p>Lucius, who was greeted, stared at her a lot.</p>
<p>“What? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>The glass of alcohol was right before Freya’s mouth and her hips were tingling because she was acting like an aristocrat who was not even her life. Freya, annoyed in her own way, clasped her clothes with both hands.</p>
<p>“I’m coming back from training, and I can smell something amazing around here.”</p>
<p>It was Hero who set out to defuse the stark atmosphere. Then Archer, who was very excited, trembled.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you’re here. There’s something really good.”</p>
<p>Archer boasted that he bought all the alcohol with the money he received from the Knights. Then Gemini spoke bluntly.</p>
<p>“Lord Walther, please bear in mind that it is against the rules for a knight to drink too much.”</p>
<p>Lucius, still frozen, came close to Freya. He whispered in Freya’s ear in a voice that no one could hear.</p>
<p>“If you’ve ever dreamed of a court romance, you’d better quit.””If you’ve ever dreamed of a court romance, you’d better quit.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>What a fool this is. It would have been less unfair if she had fallen for someone.</p>
<p>“I told you no one else could.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Only then did Freya realize that Lucius did not recognize the change in Archer. In his eyes, does Freya look like she’s dating some tall guy? Freya was trying to make an excuse, but Lucius got angry.</p>
<p>“Your Highness is that–”</p>
<p>“Stop, stop. I don’t want to hear any more.”</p>
<p>Lucius plopped down on the table without lifting up to see her face at all. Now Lucius wasn’t showing any signs as he drank the wine right into the bottle, but his whole body seemed to be burning. There were a million question marks in Freya’s eyes watching him.</p>
<p><em>What? Why is he so angry?</em></p>
<p>Lucius, who dropped the bottle as it was, opened his mouth toward Freya.</p>
<p>“Come here.”</p>
<p>With his red cheeks loaded with alcohol, he held out his arm. Freya didn’t  want to go to him</p>
<p>But in this situation, his Highness might give Archer a hundred gold pieces. Her lips trembled subtly as she, who hesitated for a moment, grabbed Lucius’ arm.</p>
<p>“We’ll go ahead.”</p>
<p>As Freya and the crown prince left,  the tactless Archer greeted them loudly.</p>
<p>“Please take a look, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>And the more tactless Gemini quickly tried to follow suit for the prince’s escort. Hero stretched out his arms to stop the two.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we should follow them.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I think your Highness is angry with Miss De Bua.”</p>
<p>“Why on earth..?”</p>
<p>There was nothing wrong with Gemini’s view. Archer and Freya were family-like, and it was not against etiquette to sit face to face and eat chicken legs.</p>
<p>“How can I know why? You will never know what’s inside the mind of his Highness even until you die.”</p>
<p>Hero, who had a strange face, tapped the back of his hand with his fingernails, and Archer opened his mouth excitedly. He seemed to have forgotten the awkwardness of the situation.</p>
<p>“How about having a drink?”</p>
<p>“Good, Lord Walter.”</p>
<p>When Hero was seated, Gemini was still watching his Highness near the door.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. Leader.”</p>
<p>Hero cast a spell on Gemini, who shook himself in armor and made only a metallic sound. Hero, who was watching the scene, smiled lightly and joked.</p>
<p>“So, Knight Commander, come here. If you join us, we’ll be happy to release it.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Elias! Shame on you for using magic this way.”</p>
<p>“Gemini, if I live like you, I’ll be out of breath for a day.”</p>
<p>Archer bowed his head at Hero’s words and managed to contain the burst of laughter. Gemini has excellent sword skills and leadership, but he was usually frustrated.</p>
<p>“Untie it now, Wizard.”</p>
<p>Eventually, Gemini, who had given up following Lucius, sat down, and the three hit their glasses hard enough to splash.</p>
