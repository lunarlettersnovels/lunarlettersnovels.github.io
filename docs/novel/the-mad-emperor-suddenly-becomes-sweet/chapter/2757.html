            <p>Ever since Archer started living with Freya, he woke up surprised on a rainy night. Whenever it started to thunder and lightning, Freya whimpered and shouted a small scream in her sleep. Sometimes she mumbled a few words that he didn’t understand which made him scared at first but he felt bad in the end.</p>
<p>She looked around the inside of the tent after saying goodbye to Archer. It felt like a very old story how she randomly ran into Archer on the street and how she got here since.</p>
<p><em>I almost had something terrible happen to me while hanging around here….</em></p>
<p>In the moment of danger, Archer became a pillar that she could lean on.</p>
<p><em>I don’t really have things to pack.</em></p>
<p>She didn’t have anything to take as she was moving the tent. As she was tidying up the fireplace where she always slept, Archer stopped her while cleaning his sword.</p>
<p>“Freya, whenever you want.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“Come back if you want.”</p>
<p>Freya’s face twisted at his short words.</p>
<p>“Why are you saying such a thing after eating a good breakfast?” As she spoke bluntly while her eyes became red because of Archer’s words, he continued while staring at the ground.</p>
<p>“Who’s going to clean here without you? Isn’t that so?”</p>
<p>“You’re leaving here soon anyway.”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying,” Archer said angrily as he seemed awkward. Two of them were angry without having the intention to be and just kept standing there. Freya, who didn’t like the awkward atmosphere, moved first.</p>
<p>“His Majesty is waiting so I’ll be off first.” Her nose felt a little tingly as she came out of the tent.</p>
<p><em>Such a short distance to the tent, I don’t know why he’s acting like that.</em></p>
<p>She was trying to be brave, but she kept seeing the tent she stayed with Archer.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Freya quickly went to the Grand Master while Lucius was getting treated by Herro.</p>
<p>“Master, how about it? Do I have some talent?”</p>
<p>“You’re talking about talent after such short sessions?”</p>
<p>She definitely felt like she was getting a little better, but he wouldn’t compliment her.</p>
<p><em>Hmph, so old-fashioned….</em></p>
<p>If Lucius was annoying, Gemini was like a wall that was really high and thick. Usually, people would get a little closer as they see each other more often, but he was the same as usual.</p>
<p>“Lower your chest a little then quickly swing your arms.”</p>
<p>But since he tried to keep his promise of teaching her swordsmanship, he wasn’t a bad person. He’s personally teaching her how to use a dagger while delaying his duty at the order.</p>
<p>“Let’s practice hitting the target this time.”</p>
<p>Gemini held a dagger and personally demonstrated.</p>
<p>“When you’re throwing a dagger, it’s efficient to aim for their vital area.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I’ll ever get that good.”</p>
<p>Freya felt goosebumps at Gemini’s amazing accuracy as he aimed for the neck and the forehead of the target while being expressionless.</p>
<p>“Ha, ha.”</p>
<p>Freya thanked him after she practiced until her back was covered in sweat.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much, Master.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for taking up so much of your valuable time.”</p>
<p>“The men of the Stern family keep their promise.”</p>
<p>She stared at Gemini, who disappeared without even looking back after the training.</p>
<p>“Man. He looks pretty cool.”</p>
<p>She rubbed her nose as she felt awkward.</p>
<p>As she passed the barracks, she felt at home as everyone was moving busily. Freya started cleaning when she came back to Lucius’s tent. She didn’t think of anything when she was dusting and cleaning the floor, as it was a familiar task to her. How long has she been on her knees?</p>
<p>“….. Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>Lucius was leaning by the tent’s entrance without a sound. As Freya’s eyes widened in surprise, he frowned a little.</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>“I still have the stuff to do.”</p>
<p>“Now,” he commanded.</p>
<p>Freya roughly washed her hands and started following him. As Lucius was heading where the stable was, her eyes became a little unstable. As he ordered her to take out two horses, Freya spoke anxiously.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I don’t know how to ride a horse.”</p>
<p>She told him at the last hunt, but Lucius wouldn’t remember. He shrugged his shoulders at Freya’s words and brushed the horse’s mane.</p>
<p><em>I don’t know what he’s thinking.</em></p>
<p>Lucius stretched out his long legs and jumped on the horse and slowly moved it.</p>
<p>“Be careful.”</p>
<p>As she thought he was going alone and was about to send him off, a hand randomly snatched her.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>When Freya came back to her senses after screaming, she was on the back of the horse.</p>
<p>“If you scream like that, the horse gets surprised.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I was more surprised.”</p>
<p>As Freya somehow straightened her upper body, she could see the wide-open field in front of her. It was different from seeing it on the ground. It was open that made her feel like it would be endless no matter how long they go.</p>
<p>“Wow, so wide.”</p>
<p>As her mouth was wide opened from surprise, his lips faintly moved while holding onto Freya’s waist.</p>
<p>“But it’s a little uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“You mind that I’m holding onto you?”</p>
<p>“A little….”</p>
<p>After being in awe of the scenery, she became very aware of her position. Her back was touching Lucius’s hard chest and the hand that was holding her waist was very big.</p>
<p>“Fine. Then I’ll let go.”</p>
<p>Lucius answered in a light tone and really let go, and at that moment Freya lost balance on the horse and swayed. She had to grab Lucius’s thigh in surprise.</p>
<p><em>How can he really let go, I almost died.</em></p>
<p>Freya, who barely got up, moved her lips.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, can I ask you a favour again?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t keep riding while holding onto his thighs. The tip of Lucius’s lips rose at her words.</p>
<p>“If you insist.” As his hands grabbed her waist steadily, the horse calmed down and started running hard again.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?”</p>
<p>“We’re scouting.”</p>
<p>Freya looked around as he said they were scouting the opposite field of the outskirt. As she did, a blackbird flew at them from afar. Freya closed her eyes as she got scared of the sharp eyes of the bird.</p>
<p>She felt like she heard a story of how a bird that big could swoop up a baby goat.</p>
<p>“Looks like a pretty aggressive bird.”</p>
<p>“It’s called an eagle.”</p>
<p>As the big bird settled down on a tree nearby, Lucius started to slow down.</p>
<p>“Ah! It’s Ruth.”</p>
