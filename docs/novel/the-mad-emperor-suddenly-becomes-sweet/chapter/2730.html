            <p>His eyes twitched and his shoulders soon drooped.</p>
<p>With her lips full, she hesitated, and Lucius bowed and leaned on Freya’s shoulder. She was about to yell or smack something, but when the crown prince suddenly hugged her exhausted body, the hiccups stopped in surprise.</p>
<p>“Freya, I was worried you were late.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not what I want to hear.”</p>
<p>Freya was embarrassed when he didn’t seem to want to question her about Prince Hart.</p>
<p><em>What the hell did he want from me?</em></p>
<p>As Lucius’s forehead, which was excited by the heat, touched her shoulder, Freya somehow felt a tingle in her heart.</p>
<p><em>Why do I feel like a wife who cheated?</em></p>
<p>She and Prince Lucius have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p><em>We’re on a contractual relationship with a hundred gold pieces in exchange.</em></p>
<p>Freya couldn’t know what to reply to his words. There could not have been anyone in the world who could see the depths of Lucius.</p>
<p><em>Maybe even the goddess Diana can’t handle Lucius.</em></p>
<p>“You remember our promise, don’t you, Freya?”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I’ll keep my promise.” Her ears were ringing before she could speak.</p>
<p><em>Cause I’ll be back soon.</em></p>
<p>The promise of a day that Ruth never kept.</p>
<p>But Freya didn’t blame him. His childhood oath was vain, but it was a hill for Freya to lean on whenever she was tired and exhausted.</p>
<p>“You said you’d keep your promise.”</p>
<p>Lucius looked up at her words, his eyes wetter and his lips redder than usual. Freya couldn’t take her eyes off his strangely racy face and licked her lips automatically.</p>
<p>“…well.”</p>
<p>It was natural for a kiss to come to mind in a cave.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of people who doubt that we’re dating.”</p>
<p>“Oh, is that so?”</p>
<p>It was not unreasonable to have such doubts. No matter how much you look at it, you don’t seem to have an atmosphere full of love.</p>
<p>Freya was thinking to herself, and he spoke slowly.</p>
<p>“That’s why. I think I’ll kiss you here now.”</p>
<p>At Lucius’s words, Freya paused to think.</p>
<p>“Maybe it means that we’re going to match what we said in the last carriage.”</p>
<p>“There’s something I need to know in advance.”</p>
<p>“No, Freya. It’s not like that.”</p>
<p>Lucius, staring furiously at her lips, shook his head.</p>
<p>“…what? If not, I’ll kisses</p>
<p>There was an unprecedented red heat around his eyes staring at Freya, whose face turned red.</p>
<p>“Why on earth?”</p>
<p>As the big green eyes filled with questions, Lucius grinned.</p>
<p>“It’s not a big deal. It’s because we really…”</p>
<p>“Huh? How come that’s not a big deal?”</p>
<p>Freya frowned, and he continued.</p>
<p>“We don’t mean anything to each other anyway.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“What’s the point of rubbing your lips?”</p>
<p>Freya shouted to herself, sticking out her chin.</p>
<p>Lucius, who was watching her, slightly covered his mouth with one hand. After throwing a proposal that wasn’t even planned, the fever spread out from her body.</p>
<p>It wasn’t wrong at all.</p>
<p>“You do need a play like that to clear your doubts.”</p>
<p>Freya needed to give the impression that she was going to be his fiancee, not just a doll to stand by.</p>
<p><em>But really, my heart is…</em></p>
<p>The complicated emotions tangled together and weighed heavily on Lucius’ heart. He wanted to hold her body like this and covet her soft lips.</p>
<p>Not for someone’s watch or play.</p>
<p>A heart that should never be embraced now was winding Lucius’ ankle and pulling him into the ground.</p>
<p>Having regained his composure, he strengthened Freya’s hand by the waist.</p>
<p>“Freya, no one else, anyway.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I want you to be faithful to the contract.”</p>
<p>“If I’m this big, uh…….”</p>
<p>Freya protested with trembling, and his eyes deepened as he looked down at her. In fact, Lucius was very angry with her with Hart. But even Lucius couldn’t know what his mind was like now.</p>
<p>rustling</p>
<p>When he heard footsteps near the garden, Lucius, who bowed to her, whispered.</p>
<p>“Don’t meet anyone else.”</p>
<p>Freya’s whole body trembled as he acted as if his lips would overlap at any moment.</p>
<p>“Close your eyes. Freya.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness…”</p>
<p>Lucius told her to close her eyes, but the strain made her eyes bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Freya gulped down his breath and heat as he approached again.</p>
<p>“What if we really kiss at this rate?”</p>
