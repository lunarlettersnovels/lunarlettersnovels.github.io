            <p>Freya’s back flinched at Lucius’s words. She was aware of it since the sun was going down so when he spat it out, her mouth dried up. Normally it wouldn’t be too weird. To live in a tent like this, the servant has to sleep near the master’s bed so that they could answer at any time.</p>
<p><em>It was like that at Archer’s tent too.</em></p>
<p>If Archer looked for water overnight as he fell asleep after drinking a ton, she would bring him a water bottle. If he fell from the bed, she should push his back.</p>
<p><em>It’s the same as that.</em></p>
<p>Of course, she also remembered that most servants are men.</p>
<p><em>Hmph! I’m just serving.</em></p>
<p>She decided to not think much about it. Or else she might have to be up all night.</p>
<p>Freya put the robe on the wall on the chair and then took off Lucius’s cost. As she took off his vest and then undid his shirt, Freya’s cheeks blushed.</p>
<p><em>Why am I suddenly remembering the incident in the cave?</em></p>
<p>“What are you blushing and flaring your nostril all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Lucius lazily smiled as he stood on the stool and stared into her face.</p>
<p><em>So crazy. Why is he smiling like that?</em></p>
<p>He was so different from dragging a bloody sword on the ground.</p>
<p><em>He’s a little weird after he recovered from the poison.</em></p>
<p>He was a little weird, to begin with, but he became very dangerous in a different way.</p>
<p>Lucius’s face shone in the darkness like there was stardust on him. Freya gulped at his different expressions and action.</p>
<p>“Why, is it because I’m so handsome?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that….”</p>
<p>His expression suddenly became vicious at her words.</p>
<p>“So are you thinking that I’m ugly?”</p>
<p>“No. Y, you’re handsome.”</p>
<p>There was a hot atmosphere in Lucius’s blue eyes at her words and he kept asking tenaciously.</p>
<p>“How about it? Is it the best out of all the men you’ve seen? Hm?”</p>
<p>Freya almost fall from the stool as he shoved his face into her while she was about to take his shirt off. She barely got her balance together and then responded.</p>
<p><em>Why is he asking how handsome he is?</em></p>
<p>He probably already knows too well, so why is he asking so tenaciously?</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you answering?”</p>
<p>“That is.”</p>
<p>Lucius’s face was handsome, but it wasn’t the best for her. Ruth, who was like a spring flower, was the best Freya has ever seen. Also, unlike His Majesty, Ruth was nice and cute.</p>
<p>“…. How boring.”</p>
<p>Lucius cold said after waiting for her answer.</p>
<p>She thought Lucius was going to be angry at her for not answering, but he took the robe from the chair and turned his back against her.</p>
<p>As Lucius disappeared into the bedroom, she quickly turned the candles off and sat in the corner. She couldn’t stop her heart from thumping so fast. She breathed in and out a few times while sitting on the floor to calm her heart.</p>
<p>“Phew, finally.”</p>
<p>Freya had no intention of sleeping on her bed that was in His Majesty’s bedroom.</p>
<p><em>I wouldn’t be able to sleep there.</em></p>
<p>She imagined lying on the bed. She might see his hard chest and wide shoulders if she turned her head.</p>
<p>“….. Huh.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know when she started to be so conscious about him. Freya shook her head hard and mumbled.</p>
<p><em>I, it’s not that, but because he’s a scary person</em>.</p>
<p>There was a long sound of a horn indicating dinner time, and also what sounded like a cry of a wolf.</p>
<p>“I’m so tired.”</p>
<p>As Freya leaned her head against a pillar, she kept blinking. She was all tense as she might wake Lucius up if she made any noise. Then her head fell to the side and soon there was calm breathing.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>A moment later, the curtain that was covering the bedroom was lifted and someone very quietly came out. Lucius bent his knee a little, sat in front of Freya, and then sighed.</p>
<p>“Freya, what should I do with you?”</p>
<p>The enemy that was after Lucius was even stronger and tenaciously bothered him. To survive, to beat them Lucius had to throw away emotions. The result was that he was becoming more exhausted. When he thought he lost all emotions, Lucius met her.</p>
<p>“….. Ha.”</p>
<p>The emotion that caught fire spread out in his heart like wildfire. Lucius, with his eyes becoming teary, stretched out his hand and retracted it in the end.</p>
<p><em>I’m right in front of you like this, but you are asleep.</em></p>
<p>He lifted the bangs with one hand and stared into Freya’s face, as she was sound asleep.</p>
<p><em>You always show up at my hardest time.</em></p>
<p>The fragment of memory that Herro couldn’t find was right in front of him.</p>
<p>The night when he accidentally saw Freya’s necklace, he had a worse headache than normal.</p>
<p><em>Why is Freya wearing the same necklace as mine?</em></p>
<p>That necklace that was made from special metal from Mount Alpi was left by his mother. The necklace he thought he lost was being worn by his servant. But no matter how hard he thought, he couldn’t remember when he and Freya would have met. He fell asleep sometime after having cold sweat from pain and he had a familiar dream overnight.</p>
<p><em>Ruth….</em></p>
<p>He remembered the voice that called him quietly. The place he hid to save his life, she kept giving her hand to him who wasn’t thinking at all. The thin and rough small hand kept patting him. Lucius remembered the face that was from his lost memory that night.</p>
<p>That familiar green eyes were Freya’s.</p>
<p><em>Sixteen and thirteen.</em></p>
<p>To call it love, was certainly an immature emotion. But before even realizing that Freya was already entrenched in his heart.</p>
<p><em>Freya, what would you think if I say I’m Ruth? </em>His head was in chaos, but his sharp eyes had determination.</p>
