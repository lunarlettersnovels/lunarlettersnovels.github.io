        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“Miss, Miss, we’re here.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Freya came back to herself when she heard Miriam’s voice. She had been lost in her own thoughts. Her thoughts were so complicated that she just sat blankly, even when she returned to the bedroom.</p>
<p>“Lottie, Count Diverto, and His Highness Lucius,” she murmured softly.</p>
<p>Then she jumped up and called Miriam, who was arranging flowers in a vase.</p>
<p>“Have you heard anything about the Diverto family?”</p>
<p>In a flash, Miriam approached Freya and gazed at her.</p>
<p>“Of course, it was a long time ago because they were really famous.”</p>
<p>The Diverto family, which was the second most powerful in the north after the imperial family, fell because of a tragedy.</p>
<p>“One day, I heard that the count’s baby had disappeared.”</p>
<p>When she heard Miriam’s story, she could feel the count more easily. The countess had died of depression, and the count also suffered from heart problems.</p>
<p>“That is what happened.”</p>
<p>That’s why his body was so damaged that he had to carry medicine all the time. The count’s heart attack was caused by the deaths of his child and his wife.</p>
<p>The family that seemed so united was destroyed in an instant.’</p>
<p>Freya understood the count’s grief.</p>
<p>“I secretly listened to what adults used to say,”</p>
<p>Miriam uttered a very low voice and whispered near Freya’s ear.</p>
<p>“At that time, there was a rumor that the Diverto family had such an accident because they supported His Highness, Lucius.”</p>
<p>“………who did such a thing!”</p>
<p>Freya, who was making quite a bit of noise, covered her mouth with her hand. because there was no need to ask who it was.</p>
<p>“I heard that there were a lot of aristocratic families that collapsed at that time.”</p>
<p>“There were so many things I didn’t know.”</p>
<p>“Because you’re from Del Mundo.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much for talking to me today.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it. Now rest.”</p>
<p>Miriam left the bedroom after preparing milk and cookies to eat before retiring to bed. Her body was quite tired, but she didn’t think she could sleep easily. Freya put a thick cape and shawl on top of Schmitz before lifting the lamp. The hallway on the second floor outside the bedroom was quiet.</p>
<p>“Did he come back to his room?”</p>
<p>Freya, who glanced at the room right next to her, rushed her way again. Finding a small library down the hallway, she carefully opened the door. This was the prince’s private library, and although it was not large, it kept quite a lot of books.</p>
<p>“Let’s see the history of Morsiani.”</p>
<p>Taking it out, she climbed to a place to sit near the window. She put a candlestick on the window frame, hugged one of the cushions that looked soft, and opened the book. Freya’s face, which had been reading for a long time, became darker than the first time.</p>
<p>“It’s like a tree root”</p>
<p>There was no way she could understand how entangled it was by reading it like this. Exhausted, she stretched herself back with the book on her stomach. She just wanted to know a little more about the work of Lucius or Count Diverto.</p>
<p><em>How do you define power?</em></p>
<p>She is hurting an innocent person so much. This was not necessarily true of the empress. She was no different from Shylo.</p>
<p>She quickly blew out the candle at the squeak of the heavy wooden door. She didn’t do anything wrong, but Freya buried her face between the cushions because her heart was beating so fast.</p>
<p>Slurping.</p>
<p>In the dark, the sound of the hem dragging on the floor sounded dreary. Fear-stricken Freya put a finger in her mouth and bit it. Then something flashed out of the window, and there was thunder. The strong rain knocking on Freya’s window soon turned her face blue.</p>
<p><em>I don’t like rain.</em></p>
<p>She overcame most of it as she grew up, but the rainy night was still scary. If she made a sound, it seemed like someone chasing her would bend her long hair and drag her to a darker place. The baby’s cry and the laughter of a strange woman echoed in my ears.</p>
<p>“My dear Freya.”</p>
<p>Finding the bookshelf wasn’t a scary thing.</p>
<p>She shed tears at the familiar voice. Actually, she didn’t know how much she had been holding back her tears since the day the count was crying, and her heart seemed to tremble with him. The reason was unknown.</p>
<p>“Crying.”</p>
<p>With a warm embrace, Lucio welcomed Freya, who lifted her head from the pile of cushions.</p>
<p>“You’re still afraid of the rain.”</p>
<p>Clasped in Lucius’ arms, she couldn’t hear him well due to intense tension.</p>
<p>Freya said she wasn’t afraid of ghosts, but she was afraid of the rain.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I’m afraid of the rain, but I hate the flashing sky and the sound.”</p>
<p>Freya thought the conversation of the past was ringing in her ears, and a warm breath tickled her forehead.</p>
<p>“Freya, I’ll always be by your side when it rains.”</p>
<p>“That means….”</p>
<p>It was definitely what Ruth told her.</p>
<p>There was a flash of light outside the window again. Freya, who raised her head at his words, appeared to be a different color in the eyes of Lucius, who had received the light. It was just like green, mixed with blue and yellow.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, your eyes…”</p>
<p>“Did I change that much, Freya?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Lucius made a strange expression as he looked down at her, who was beginning to tremble more than the first time.</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t want to reveal it this way</p>
<p>However, it became difficult to catch her as she talked about the contract. No, he just found it difficult to pretend to be emotionless with her in front of him.</p>
<p><em>I don’t want another man to see you. Freya.</em></p>
<p>Lucius, who was looking at Freya’s confused gaze, sighed a long sigh.</p>
