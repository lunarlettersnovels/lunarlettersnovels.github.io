            <p>“I guess you can’t sleep at night these days, Miss. Should we go to Archer?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Bell.”</p>
<p>Freya began to change at some point, and Bell and Miriam had no idea why. Freya, who was always cheerful and kind, lost her expression and appeared frighteningly cold at times.</p>
<p>“Would you please make me a cup of tea?”</p>
<p>Even Hero and Gemini were hesitant to meet Lucius as he grew trashier. Everything related to him wanted to get away from him. Even Archer, who admires Lucius, was reluctant to meet now.</p>
<p>“Miss, we have a visitor.”</p>
<p>“……..who is this?”</p>
<p>The majority of the aristocracy was uninterested in her. Freya’s interactions were almost entirely with Count Diverto.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in meeting anyone right now.”</p>
<p>She muttered to herself while clutching her brow with one hand. And an unexpected visitor awaited her in the parlor where she had left.</p>
<p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Miss De Bua.”</p>
<p>“I am Viscount Ferrol. I’m sorry for being late in greeting you.”</p>
<p>Shylo and Sophia sat next to each other, pretending to be noble while holding a teacup. Their appearance has not changed from the past, giving them the impression that this is an orphanage.</p>
<p>“You were apprehended.”</p>
<p>Freya had a feeling she wouldn’t be able to hide it this time. Sophia’s venomous eyes were proof.</p>
<p>“The tea smells wonderful because it was given to me by the crown prince.”</p>
<p>Freya opened her mouth calmly in response to Sophia’s words while sipping tea.</p>
<p>“Miriam, Bell, are you going to stay outside?”</p>
<p>Their conversation was now something no one should hear.</p>
<p>“But, miss,” Miriam, who had a gloomy look on her face, blurted out the end of Shylo’s words. Freya smiled at Miriam and Bell, who were both concerned.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. They’re people I used to work with at Del Mundo.”</p>
<p>“Then call us if you have any questions.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please.”</p>
<p>Only the steam from the teacup was rising in the drawing room, where only three people remained.</p>
<p>“Yes, you’ve been a swindler since you were a child. But I had no idea it would result in such a major accident.”</p>
<p>Sophia smiled as she slammed the teacup down.</p>
<p>“What had happened to my daughter, such a self-made lady, whom I hadn’t seen in a long time?”</p>
<p>Shylo may have played the role of a caring father, but he said something inappropriate. Freya pressed her lips together, trying to keep her nausea at bay. What the hell are those vile writers up to?</p>
<p>Whatever it is, it will not be good for her.</p>
<p>Freya frowned, while Sophia smiled.</p>
<p>“Yeah, because we’re the only ones who can help you. I’ll do my best to ensure your smooth court life.”</p>
<p>What are they related to her staying in the palace?</p>
<p>“What are you on about?”</p>
<p>“I’ve had enough of that nonsense. Are you speaking to me?”</p>
<p>Freya raised her chin and stared at Sofia as she blurted out the rest of her words.</p>
<p>So, who else is there?</p>
<p>Shylo insisted on resolving Freya’s difficult appearance.</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness, Sophia. Freya is doing fine right now, so nitpicking is pointless.”</p>
<p>She has no idea why they pretend to be a couple, but she had to kick them out. However, it was not as simple as she had imagined, opening her mouth proudly in front of an existence that had been smacking her since childhood. Freya spoke quietly, clearing her throat.</p>
<p>“Since you’re already familiar with it, I’ll just get to the point. You should leave me alone because you know who’s behind me.”</p>
<p>She prayed earnestly that her opponent would make some kind of threat.</p>
<p>“Did I mention I like the way you look, baby?”</p>
<p>Shylo scanned Freya’s lips with her tongue, looking greedily at her.</p>
<p>“Does the crown prince know you grew up in an orphanage?” Is His Majesty the Emperor or Empress aware? “Sophia continued to speak.</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult for us to prove your ancestry. Besides, all of the kids you used to hang out with are now with us. You remember that, don’t you? Lottie is a child.”</p>
<p>Sophia’s eyes narrowed as she mentioned Lottie.</p>
<p>“Didn’t he assist you in fleeing?”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>She hoped she wouldn’t be caught, but heaven wasn’t on her side this time. Freya shook, her fists clenching. She wished she hadn’t had to witness what Lottie had gone through. They are cruel and despicable authors.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason to make such a scary face if we’re talking smoothly, right, baby?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have more to lose than we do now?”</p>
<p>Sophia smiled with her eyes as she coyly grabbed the teacup again.</p>
<p>“It’s a threat that if I don’t listen to you, I won’t be able to stand still.”</p>
<p>Shylo talked about her later business for a long time, but Freya couldn’t hear anything.</p>
<p>Everything was a shambles.</p>
<p>He hasn’t seen him since that rainy night in the bookstore when she met Lucius. A strange sign was detected on the outskirts, and she ran there herself. It was actually a good thing. It was becoming increasingly difficult for her to face Lucius.</p>
<p>She was naive to believe she could fool everyone.</p>
<p>The conclusion was self-evident.</p>
<p>Her worries weighed heavily on her shoulders after Shylo and Sophia’s visit.</p>
<p>If I keep acting like this, I might ruin everything.</p>
<p>Lottie was concerned as well, and her situation, in which she had no idea where she was going, was frustrating.</p>
<p>“Your face is a shambles, Freya.”</p>
<p>Michael greeted her with a bright smile. She didn’t want to meet anyone, but she was pleased with his presence. Michael made her feel very at ease.</p>
<p>“It’s a medicine I created that will help you sleep soundly at night.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate it.”</p>
<p>It was exactly what she needed right now. She couldn’t sleep at night because she leaned against the sofa, but only a terrible imagination came to mind. She resents me for being too imaginative at times like this. Michael smiled as he took the medicine bottle and spoke to her.</p>
