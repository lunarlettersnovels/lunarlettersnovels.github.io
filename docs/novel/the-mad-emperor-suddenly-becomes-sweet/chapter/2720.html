            <p>“Tell me! Was the wound on the back of your hand caused by Selena?”</p>
<p>“It’s past already.”</p>
<p>“Hurry up and tell me!” Near Freya’s neck, his raspy sigh passed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Freya could see the end of an unusually long day. With the door to the balcony wide open, Freya paced around the room.</p>
<p>“If there’s another day like today, it’ll be hard to hold out.”</p>
<p>She drank tea with the empress because she was bored in her poetry class and terrible etiquette class. But it all ended with a fight with Selena in the rose garden.</p>
<p>“I should have scolded that Edelion lady more.”</p>
<p>No matter how much she thought about it, Freya was weak in revenge due to the pain in her hand.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to let you go next time when I see you.”</p>
<p>As she rubbed the back of her hand, Lucius, who was screaming at the sight of her wound, came to her mind.</p>
<p>“He is so cute when he is angry?”</p>
<p>Freya, who was heating up, sat leaning against the sofa, but her eyes were wide open.</p>
<p>“I’m going crazy. Why can’t I sleep?”</p>
<p>Freya was embarrassed because she had never experienced anything like this in her life. As long as she’s full, she would lie down and sleep well.</p>
<p>“No way, is it insomnia?”</p>
<p>After playing aristocratic games, is it now that such disease has been transmitted?</p>
<p>“I left the door open, but why is it so frustrating?”</p>
<p>Freya felt like a ball of fire was filling her heart, so she gulped down the water. Still, the excitement didn’t subside.</p>
<p>“Should I at least knit?”</p>
<p>Freya was so flattered that she wanted to knit so much that she was tired of it.</p>
<p>“Don’t do this and do your homework.”</p>
<p>Freya sat at her desk and opened a book of poems, but she couldn’t see a word. Next, she opened a book of etiquette but soon covered it.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it crazy?” How can you memorize all that?”</p>
<p>When folding hands, considering whether the left hand is above or the right hand is above, the explanation of the angle of lowering the head was boring. She sprang to her feet, pushing her chair loudly. Freya, taking off her gown, headed to the balcony.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s cool.”</p>
<p>Sitting on the railing, she dangled her legs. The wind blew, and in the meantime, long brown hair fluttered everywhere. Having her hair done with her hands, she looked up and saw a lake breaking in the moonlight. When she saw the lake, Lucius came into her mind. Freya spent quite a long time with him, but he was still an unknown person. She shook her head vigorously as she thought of his blue eyes.</p>
<p>“Why do you think about him for no reason?”</p>
<p>Freya hurriedly thought of the other person.</p>
<p>The first person that came to mind was Baroness Francesca, who was in charge of her etiquette.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to be close to her even if you die and wake up.”</p>
<p>Next up is Selena Edelion.</p>
<p>“I hate you more than Mrs. Francesca.”</p>
<p>And the last was the empress who didn’t even want to think about it. The smiling face as if it were kind was somehow chilling.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter. At least, it’s only a few months away and I’m going to leave far away.”</p>
<p>The thought of finding Lottie and finding a small house with a bag of gold coins on her back made Freya hum. When the wind blew and tickled her forehead, someone she had barely forgotten came back to her mind. Freya, whose cheeks were hot, felt the wound hidden under her bangs with her hands. As she was fidgeting with her forehead, Freya suddenly remembered what happened in the rose garden earlier.</p>
<p>” I am angry as fire.”</p>
<p>Freya couldn’t see his face because it was dark, but she could feel the anger felt behind her. Freya replied to him, asking if Selena was the one who hurt the back of her hand.</p>
<p>“It’s all right. One cut can’t kill me.”</p>
<p>It was true. Such a scratch on a rose thorn didn’t even come on the axis of the wound. In her calm answer, Lucius jerked Freya’s bangs.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”’</p>
<p>“I won’t allow anybody to hurt you from now on.”</p>
<p>The voice of Lucius commanding was very sad.</p>
<p><em>Why does he care so much about my wounds?</em></p>
<p>Unable to figure out why she kept flinching. Lucius, who slowly turned her around, looked down at her for a long time. Freya wasn’t sure because it was all dark, but his blue eyes were moist.</p>
<p><em>What is he trying to do?</em></p>
<p>In an instant, his lips touched Freya’s forehead wound and soon licked the wound on her cheek. It was so embarrassing that her toes got twisted without anyone looking at it.</p>
<p>“Ugh, it tickles.”</p>
<p>“Shhh… It’s just a cure.”</p>
<p>Freya thought it was fortunate that this place was in a shady bush.</p>
<p>Thinking of a boy with blond hair, blue eyes, and red lips these days made Freya think of Lucius.</p>
<p>“This is because it’s been so long since I broke up with Ruth.”</p>
<p>Freya, who came down from the railing, sat with her back in the corner of the balcony, her legs folded. This kind of place was more comfortable for her than that flamboyant bedroom with fluffy bedding.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m back in Archer’s tent like this.”</p>
<p>Her back was a little sore, but soon after she was tired, and her eyes closed. As Freya fell into a deep sleep, a blackbird flew over the railing in the distance.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s cold.”</p>
<p>Freya, who opened her eyes trembling, realized that she had fallen asleep on the balcony. She had goosebumps on her skin, whether it was cold all night. Sweeping down her arms, there was a strange shadow over her.</p>
<p>“Ruth! When did you get here?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an eagle that seemed to have grown bigger was staring at her. To Freya’s call, the bird spread its large wings and responded.</p>
<p>“Ruth, have you been protecting me all night? What?”</p>
<p>Unlike Freya’s fierce-looking appearance, the bird flapped its beak down.</p>
<p>“You’re so cute!”</p>
<p>She got up and approached the oddly familiar bird.</p>
<p>“It’s strange. I think I’ve seen you before.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know why she remembered the blonde boy who looked at the sky through the window a long time ago.</p>
<p>Then there was a short whistle, and the bird soon flapped its wings and flew up to the sky. Freya, who was watching Ruth leave, stretched.</p>
<p>“I have to hurry, too.”</p>
<p>If she gets caught sleeping on the floor, she will surely have a pretty difficult situation. Back in the bedroom, Freya quickly changed her dress after organizing her randomly thrown book yesterday. It was clear that if you procrastinate, the maids would come in and make up for you.</p>
<p>“I don’t like that..”</p>
<p>However, a dress with many ribbons was too much to wear alone. Freya doesn’t know how much she cursed inside while sweating alone.</p>
<p>“Who made all these complicated decorations?”</p>
<p>There was no sign of a mouth coming out of the morning.</p>
