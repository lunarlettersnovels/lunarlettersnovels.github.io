            <p>“Oh, no! “Even if I write a hundred times all night, I won’t be able to get it correctly.”</p>
<p>Freya was bothered by her own loud voice and hastily looked around. Fortunately, the maid was cleaning the windows from afar and was unaware. She swiftly jumped up from her seat and grabbed her pen, notebook, and book.</p>
<p>“It’s both pleasant and frustrating to be inside.”</p>
<p>Freya, who came out, arrived at her location sweating on her brow. She unpacked all her stuff and sat still in a cane chair when she came upon an arch with purple flowers on one side of the lawn.</p>
<p>“Is it any good?”</p>
<p>When she walked out of her dreary class, everything looked lovely. But it wasn’t the only time to unwind in this manner.</p>
<p>“We’ll see.”</p>
<p>Francesca instructed her to draft a ten-page copy.</p>
<p>“Is she insane?” “It wasn’t schoolwork; it was bullying,” Freya groaned.</p>
<p>“She is so obnoxious, Your Highness, that I can’t help myself.”</p>
<p>Freya couldn’t waste time whining. She started huffing and puffing and doing her schoolwork.</p>
<p>How much has she already completed?</p>
<p>Her wrist began to emit an unusual sound. But the desperate thing was that she had only completed one page.</p>
<p>What a shambles!</p>
<p>Freya laid her head on the table in despair, and a long shadow stretched forward.</p>
<p>“Are you begging for a nap, Freya?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, Michael.”</p>
<p>She raised her head and spotted Michael, who was holding a basket and smiling.</p>
<p>“You appear to be preoccupied. Do you have time to munch on some snacks?”</p>
<p>In Freya’s eyes, he appeared to be an angel without wings for a brief instant.</p>
<p>“Your timing is impeccable. I’m starving!”</p>
<p>She stood up quickly and motioned to the other seat, where she asked for him. The basket was placed on the table by Michael.</p>
<p>“This was sent to me by someone.”</p>
<p>Freshly baked bread, jam, meat, and steamed veggies were all contained within the basket. Freya recalled skipping meals because she was worried about the etiquette class.</p>
<p>“Oh, my goodness, I’m delighted you stopped by. “I believe I can eat all of these.”</p>
<p>“That’s great news.”</p>
<p>“I’ll eat without a second thought.”</p>
<p>Freya placed the meat on the bread and nibbled on it. Then it reminded her of the beef bread she had eaten on the street the day before. Freya’s face was painted with a pleasing smile, and Michael, seated across from her, observed and inquired.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to eat in such a manner?”</p>
<p>A typical aristocrat ate bread and meat the size of a bird’s nest. Freya did not open her mouth wide or place the meat on the bread in that manner. Freya smiled nervously, wiping the crumbs from her mouth as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I tried it once when I was out.”</p>
<p>Michael, an aristocratic scribe by birth, was actually a commoner. Because no one in the family gathered Michael, who was traveling, grew up in the hands of a gypsy.</p>
<p>“I eat it frequently as well.”</p>
<p>Michael, who was smiling, put the meat on the bread like she did and grabbed it. However, swallowing was difficult since the loaf of bread kept plugging his throat. This is because the empress’s order instantly came to mind.</p>
<p>‘Seduce that girl, Michael. Allow her to fall in love with you and turn on Lucius.’</p>
<p>Michael isn’t feeling it, but it wasn’t difficult.</p>
<p><em>She’ll come to me shortly.</em></p>
<p><em>We haven’t been together long, but we’re getting along well.</em></p>
<p>His Majesty Lucius, whom he had been observing for months, was simply using Freya as a method of ascension. There was no regard for her, and love seemed to have vanished.</p>
<p>Small acts of compassion can easily impact you in strange places.</p>
<p>He gave Freya an odd smile as she ate the excellent bread.</p>
<p>Women are the same whether they are aristocratic or common.</p>
<p>Michael has never believed in love, even after meeting Milady and other women. All they wanted was the appearance of affection. The enigmatic red-eyed woman abandoned her husband, child, and parents.</p>
<p><em>I wouldn’t be the one to cry the instant my fantasy was shattered.</em></p>
<p>Michael was able to come to when he was absorbed in Freya’s voice.</p>
<p>“I appreciate the dinner. “I’m going to finish my schoolwork now.”</p>
<p>Freya took up her pen once again and returned her attention to her assignment. She quickly lost her balance, fell on her stomach, and twisted her body. Ink splashed all over her hands, wrists, and dress sleeves moments later.</p>
<p>“You know what, Freya?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Freya’s beautiful eyes were flooded with the greenness of the garden as she gazed up. There was a speck of ink on her adorable freckled cheeks.</p>
<p>“Oh, I see…”</p>
<p>For a brief while, Michael, who was leaning forward, appeared blank. He completely forgot what he was about to say. Freya was unlike any other woman he had met.</p>
<p>I don’t understand her attraction to me.</p>
<p>“What exactly is it, Michael?”</p>
<p>“Freya, you’re stunning.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Michael’s comments, delivered with a solemn expression, dilated her pupils.</p>
<p>“What exactly is it, Michael?” That’s cruel.”</p>
<p>Michael was taken aback when he said something unexpected.</p>
<p>“No, it was all a joke.”</p>
<p>Normally, women would blush in response to his compliments.</p>
<p>Michael, who had been lightly shaking his long silver hair, opened his mouth only belatedly. As a joke, he couldn’t give her a serious glance.</p>
<p>“But there is some honesty in it.”</p>
<p>“In any case, thank you.”</p>
<p>Freya, on the other hand, was concentrating on her homework with her head down. With a faint pout, he swept his burning cheeks down.</p>
<p>“There will be another chance next time.”</p>
