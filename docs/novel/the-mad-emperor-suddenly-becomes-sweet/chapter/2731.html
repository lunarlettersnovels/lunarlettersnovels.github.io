            <p>The handle of the cane was elaborately decorated with rose patterns. But Freya couldn’t figure out how to open it. The gentleman was panting and his eyes were shaking. Freya’s touch became urgent in a situation where it would not be strange even if her breath passed as it was.</p>
<p>“I’m going crazy.”</p>
<p>She turned the rose on the handle with the feeling of grasping at straws, and the stomach of the cane moved.</p>
<p>“Wow! Is this opening?”</p>
<p>The handle opened and a small bottle of medicine came out inside. She quickly took out the pill and put it under the old man’s tongue.</p>
<p>“I wish I had water…”</p>
<p>However, it seemed that the medicine worked, and the man’s breathing soon became comfortable.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank God.”</p>
<p>It was horrible to watch a man die. She shivered as she recalled the orphanage child buried in sponsorship.</p>
<p>“Thank you…”</p>
<p>The man was unable to speak clearly, but he picked his breath again and again.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you’re okay. I’ll go out and call someone.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute…”</p>
<p>Freya hesitated for a moment as the gentleman stretched out his arm and tried to hold her. She lent her arm so that he could sit upright, and only then they could see each other’s faces.</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Freya has never felt so strange in her life. A man with pale green eyes and brown hair blinked at her. Perhaps the man also wants to look at Freya’s face hidden by the cape.</p>
<p>“I have to go back now!”</p>
<p>Hart, who appeared at the time, pulled her arm, breaking the delicate atmosphere between the two.</p>
<p>“Did you enjoy the tour?”</p>
<p>Freya fumbled as she looked back.</p>
<p>“There’s a man down there.”</p>
<p>“You can send someone out.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but…”</p>
<p>With the field behind the coughing gentleman, Freya soon left the store. Somehow she felt uncomfortable. She looked back over and over again the whole time she was away from there.</p>
<p>They followed the channel and went through the opening hole again. It wasn’t hard at all when she went out, but their way back was only slow. It was not until she came to the palace garden that she could barely straighten her back. Hart, who was looking beyond the wall where the sun began to set, whispered quietly.</p>
<p>“I’m glad we got back early.”</p>
<p>At Prince Hart’s words, she took a breather and nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s annoying when I come back at night.”</p>
<p>“……Yes.”</p>
<p>Freya had blank eyes, thinking about the secret passage behind her. She did a lot of adventures in a very short time. They ate street food and looked around interesting shops.</p>
<p><em>And I was able to help a sick man,</em> Freya thought.</p>
<p>“How was it? Did you have fun today?” Hart asks Freya while arranging his messy hair by the cloak.</p>
<p>“It’s…”</p>
<p>It was definitely more fun than a boring class.</p>
<p>In addition, Prince Hart was not as bad as she thought. It was offbeat but easygoing and pleasant. But Freya heard he was the enemy of Lucius.</p>
<p>Somehow Freya was bothered that someone might know that she was hanging out with Hart.</p>
<p>In the end, hesitating, she just smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p>“I enjoyed being with you,” Hart told Freya.</p>
<p>That was strange. Hart, who had been talking all alone, stopped when they reached the Royal Palace of Lucius.</p>
<p>“I think we should break up now.”</p>
<p>“Go home safely.”</p>
<p>Freya walked gently with swollen feet because she walked around excitedly. She crossed the garden and reached between the arches leading to the building. And when she got in there, she screamed.</p>
<p>“Oh my god!”</p>
<p>It was because she faced the sharp eyes of someone sitting on the railing. It was Lucius who stared at her as if he was going to eat her.</p>
<p>“Lou, Your Grace, Lucius.”</p>
<p>“Why would you sit here and watch?”</p>
<p>Freya, who was sweeping her arms in a chilling mood, couldn’t breathe properly.</p>
<p>Hiccups.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the hiccups burst and he slowly approached Freya as he blocked her mouth with his hand. His face was as ghastly as a volcano on the verge of bursting.</p>
<p><em>Don’t tell me, he saw me with Lord Hart?</em></p>
<p>But it was beyond her control, Hart asked her to go out with him.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t her fault at all, it was hard to raise her head straight.</p>
<p><em>You don’t have to stare at me like that.</em></p>
<p>She kept backing away from his aggressive gaze and was pushed back to the post. A cool thing soon touched her back and she was trapped between Lucius’ arms and pillars.</p>
<p>“Freya, where have you been?”</p>
<p>“Well, Francesca’s class was at the palace today.” She stammered even though she wasn’t lying at all.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I’m curious about.”</p>
<p>“That’s where I met Prince Hart.”</p>
<p>“You met…?”</p>
<p>Freya, looking into his blue eyes blazing with anger, trembled slightly.</p>
<p><em>Ohhh, it might be hard to understand.</em></p>
