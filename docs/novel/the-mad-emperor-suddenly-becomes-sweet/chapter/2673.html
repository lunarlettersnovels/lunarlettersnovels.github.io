            <p>Freya glanced down at the clothes she wore. Her hair was a bit long, but she was far from the look of a noble person. Lucius, who was frowning at her words, spoke off.</p>
<p>“If I say it’s possible, it’s possible.”</p>
<p>“But your Highness, I don’t really know how to do anything.”</p>
<p>“What I need now is a reliable person, Freya.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>She gave up her conversation with Lucius, who was saying absurd things. Of course, she’d gotten quite attached in the meantime, but how can she say that?</p>
<p>“Why do you keep talking about faith, hope, and love?”</p>
<p>Perhaps he didn’t know how she felt at the moment, full of agony. The carriage gradually slowed down.</p>
<p><em>I guess I’m close to the palace now.</em></p>
<p>Freya chewed her lips without even thinking of looking outside at all. Soon the wagon stopped completely, and a serious light shone on Lucius’ face.</p>
<p>“Hero, take charge of Freya, please.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Freya, don’t think about anything else. I won’t let you go twice.”</p>
<p>He stared at Freya’s eyes for a moment before getting off. Freya lost her will to run away due to the threat of the crown prince. It felt like he was going to get a knife if she got caught.</p>
<p>Looking around, she also got off the wagon along with Hero.</p>
<p>“Wow! Is this the palace?”’</p>
<p>It was an unfamiliar scene for her, she who had never experienced anything other than an orphanage or barracks. Freya’s shoulders, overwhelmed by a well-groomed garden and a huge building in front of her, kept shrinking.</p>
<p>“Freya, just follow me.”</p>
<p>Walking behind Hero, she whispered quietly.</p>
<p>“Hero. I don’t think this is right.”</p>
<p>“But it’s the meaning of your Highness.”</p>
<p>“This doesn’t make sense even to you.”</p>
<p>It seemed that Hero had a lot to say, but the conversation soon ended.</p>
<p>As she went through a garden wider than the field, a winding corridor appeared. As Freya climbed the stairs and repeatedly passed through the hallway again, Hero heard a rough breathing sound from Freya’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Hero, it’s not a maze, right?”</p>
<p>Where in the world are we going? Is it so complicated and far away? Freya, who was out of breath, put her hand on her waist and breathed heavily, and he took his mouth off.</p>
<p>“We’ve arrived.”</p>
<p>Freya’s mysterious eyes opened the door and a strange woman appeared.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’d like to ask you to decorate Ms. de Bua here.” Hero pushed Freya into the room and smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“Hero! Can you wait a little bit?” It was her first time at the palace and she was scared to be alone among complete strangers. He smiled softly through the closing door.</p>
<p>“Your Highness Lucius will be fine.”</p>
<p>Soon, the door was closed, and only Freya dressed in rugged clothes was left alone.</p>
<p>“What if you suddenly throw it here and go?” Freya stood as if confronting a few maids standing in front of her and pulled the hem of her clothes. The employees were much nicer and tidier than her.</p>
<p><em>What should I do?</em> When Freya acted awkwardly, one of them spoke first.</p>
<p>“Can you wait a moment?”</p>
<p>Freya thought she was sharing her opinions for a while but soon they came to Freya.</p>
<p>“Lady, trust us.” Those who drew a circle touched Freya’s head and tried to undress her.</p>
<p>“Uh..Uh..”</p>
<p>“I think you need to take a bath first.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Freya had no intention of undressing or bathing in front of strangers like this. But after a while, she became a mouse in a bathtub.</p>
