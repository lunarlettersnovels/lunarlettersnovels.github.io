            <p>Freya awoke in the morning to find the maid in her room.</p>
<p>“The Empress wanted to see you, Miss De Bua.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>No, the day had only just begun, but seeing the most despised face in the palace did not bode well. The Empress was not alone when she arrived with a grim expression. She smiled broadly at Freya as she sat among dozens of noble women.</p>
<p>“I invited Miss De Bua today because I was curious about Del Mundo’s story.”</p>
<p>On the surface, they were said to be interested in different cultures, but the questions they asked were spectacular.</p>
<p>“Don’t the people there really wear so few clothes?”</p>
<p>“Do you really eat soaked bread because you don’t have anything else to eat?”</p>
<p>Freya tried not to blush in the face of the onslaught of questions.</p>
<p>Freya murmured to herself, “You’ve gathered in such a crowd to mock me.”</p>
<p>faces of nobles visiting the orphanage merged with them. The nobles described the children as pitiful, but their eyes were filled with contempt.</p>
<p>“Yes! “Everything is true.”</p>
<p>Freya’s response astounded the woman flapping her fan. Freya made an exaggerated gesture as she looked the woman in the eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m naked, and I eat with my hands.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my goodness!”</p>
<p>“That’s it. “Many people die when they are sick because there are no clinics.”</p>
<p>Anyway, she had no idea what they were interested in about Del Mundo. Instead of Del Mundo’s story, Freya told them about the orphanage. All the Empress wants is for them to put her down.</p>
<p>As Freya exited tea with the Empress and the noblewoman, the heat spread from the top of her head. Freya responded naturally, but she wasn’t feeling well. She has to put on a brave face and pretend they are watching a strange beast. Freya’s annoyance eventually focused on someone.</p>
<p>I can’t believe I’ve lost track of where I am with just one pudding!</p>
<p>It was so pitiful that she was disheveled by the little soft treat that Prince Lucius had given her the day before.</p>
<p>Are you a beast, Freya? She chastised herself.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>A hawk flew into Freya’s back, pondering what had happened the night before.</p>
<p>“Oh, my.”</p>
<p>“Pay attention, Miss De Bua.”</p>
<p>Instead of becoming accustomed to motion sickness, I’m experiencing it. Who made all of these ridiculous rules? Freya suspected that someone was being tortured.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua, you need to lower your back a little more.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>When Freya met the Emperor at the upcoming ball or when another aristocrat asked her to dance, she was practicing her manners. Her back was on the verge of collapsing, and her throat hurt.</p>
<p>When she meets His Highness, she will almost certainly have to request overtime pay.</p>
<p>Freya clenched her fists, having practiced the same posture hundreds of times.</p>
<p>For a long time, it was unnecessary to blame Lucius.</p>
<p>Because she was preoccupied with the gold coins, she was the one who accepted the offer.</p>
<p>Who would be to blame?</p>
<p>Francesca’s shrill voice came in as if she were peering into Freya’s mind.</p>
<p>“Where are you going to sell your mind?”</p>
<p>A sharp hawk flew toward Freya’s back, causing her to sway slightly. She has no qualms about wielding a hawk.</p>
<p>“Oh…….”</p>
<p>“I hope you don’t forget that I’m doing everything I can for Miss De Bua, who is lacking in noble knowledge.”</p>
<p>Francesca laughed bitterly as Freya caressed her back in pain.</p>
<p>Sophia isn’t the only one. That’s not all. It’s not any less.</p>
<p>How can she look at Francesca, who beats her and brags about her gratitude?</p>
<p>Freya believed she would never fit in with the world of aristocrats.</p>
<p>“I appreciate it.”</p>
<p>“As you may know, this ball also features the announcement of Prince Hart’s engagement to Miss Edelion.”</p>
<p>Freya frowned as she returned her attention to Selena’s story. She was shaky when she was with Selena.</p>
<p>“Ms. De Bua will most likely be compared to Ms. Edelion, who has a natural grace.” “As a result, you must concentrate more on the class.”</p>
<p>Francesca’s words, on the other hand, completely discouraged her. She had no chance of beating an aristocratic opponent from the moment she was born.</p>
<p>Will Lucius be shamed as a result of my actions?</p>
<p>She said she did everything she could to go to her classes, but in reality, she was just putting straw on a muddy pile of dirt as a temporary fix.</p>
<p>“If you look closely at me, you might notice how lowly, let alone nobility, I am.”</p>
<p>Freya responded with no enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“The class for today concludes here.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, the class had ended, and she felt a little better.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>“And then copy this section a hundred times.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” Undefined Freya’s eyes trembled violently as if struck by a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua’s handwriting is terrible.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t argue with anything because she wasn’t wrong. Freya poked her tongue out and nodded.</p>
<p>“I despise reading, but I despise writing even more…”</p>
<p>She was going to run out into the garden after this class. She climbed the tree with the intention of resting quietly.</p>
