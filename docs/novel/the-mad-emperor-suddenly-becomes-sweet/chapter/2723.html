            <p>It’s been three months since Freya came to the palace. She had a dream of escaping from pain, but she gradually got used to this place.</p>
<p>Mrs. Francesca still stared at her in every class, although Maudne gave up understanding that her talent in art was hopeless. It was doubtful that her horseback riding was also improving, but her daily life must go on.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean I can sleep in that bed…”</p>
<p>Freya, who was only staring at the bed, grabbed her long hair as one and tied a blue ribbon. Two maids were assigned to take care of her, but Freya rarely asked for minimal help. Nominally for being shy, but being looked after by someone was a really weird feeling.</p>
<p>“It’s like an ant crawling around!”</p>
<p>The thought of ants reminded her of Lucius, who praised her dress. Freya looked at him with a very satisfied face. His blue eyes tickled all over.</p>
<p>“Don’t give it meaning, he just stares at it to see if it’s flawless,” Freya murmured.</p>
<p>When she thought of him, Freya always had mixed feelings.  Freya tried to think of something else quickly.</p>
<p>“I’m glad I got to know Michael.”</p>
<p>She would often have tea and snacks with him whom she happened to hang out often, and the stories Michael told were really interesting.</p>
<p>“Will I be able to see you after class today?”</p>
<p>It was a new pleasure for her, who had rarely made friends of her age.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“The last class is now!”’</p>
<p>It may be better to learn manners by getting hit by Francesca. She didn’t remember taking this class sober. The class itself was impeccable. The teacher was a very elegant person, and her voice was as good as water.</p>
<p>“The problem is that I don’t know any poetry.”</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua, please read this part.”</p>
<p>The teacher pointed to a section of the book, and she, with blank eyes, stammered away.</p>
<p>“To you, the master of the desert, this red land, are all yours.”</p>
<p>“Good. How do you feel?” The teacher asked.</p>
<p>Whenever Freya was asked to read, she felt suffocated. How can she understand the poet’s mind? A little hesitating, she opened her mouth cautiously.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! I can’t believe I feel this sad love as a mere material desire.”</p>
<p>Freya read the upper part again to the teacher’s lament, but no matter how much she look at it, its mournful theme was no sign of love, let alone love.</p>
<p>“If you love, you have to give gold and bread.’</p>
<p>There was too much difference between the love Freya thought of and the love of the noble aristocrat Nari. Freya pinched her thighs and rubbed her eyes so as not to fall asleep, and by the time the class was almost over, Freya was exhausted.</p>
<p>Then the servant knocked on the door.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua, Her Majesty has invited you.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Damn it.”</p>
<p>Freya almost spits out a lot of nausea. If she were to pick the person she least want to meet in this palace, it was the empress.</p>
<p>“I feel uncomfortable for no reason.”</p>
<p>But she was not in a position to dare to decline the empress’ invitation. She arrived at the empress palace with heavy steps, and she was guided to a different room than last time. It was a seat on a terrace connected to the garden. The person who came first was already holding a teacup. The empress smiled brightly at Freya’s appearance.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua, I haven’t seen you in a while, you must be very busy. But I’m not sure if I should have invited someone.”</p>
<p>Freya was irritated by the empress’ words.</p>
<p>Freya didn’t know why nobles say such insincere things. Freya set her example, barely pushing her lips slightly protruding forward.</p>
<p>“It’s my pleasure, your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Come on, come on. I have someone to introduce to you.”</p>
<p>When she went to her seat, Freya could identify Selena, who was sitting across from her.</p>
<p><em>What? I don’t like her either. Even her?</em></p>
<p>Her expression frowned.</p>
<p>Selena Adelion was the main character with red hair decorated with pearls. Freya vividly remembered Selena’s vile behavior.</p>
<p><em>Just looking at that unlucky face makes my hand hot.</em></p>
<p>Selena greeted her with a most graceful face.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua, it’s nice to see you here again.”</p>
<p>“……Oh, yes.”</p>
<p>There was no knack for a big smile on someone who was not at all welcome. Freya turned her head, and the opponent laughed and took off her mouth.</p>
<p>“I guess that’s how you do in Del Mundo?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Freya had no idea what she was talking about. But she could expect Selena wouldn’t say anything nice to her.</p>
<p>“Is that how you seduce a man?”</p>
<p>Freya opened her eyes wide at such a baffling remark, Selena continued.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty may have no idea, but your love affair Miss de Bua was very unusual. Miss De Bua and His Highness had already used a tent.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my God, that’s…”</p>
<p>The empress opened her eyes wide at Selena’s words and covered her mouth with a fan. Freya sweated at the reproachful gaze of the two.</p>
<p><em>Aha! Is that how the story goes?</em></p>
<p>It was all true, but subtly out of the truth.</p>
<p>“It’s only been a day since I used a tent, and it’s not like that at all!”</p>
<p>But even if you refute it here, it will seem more and more strange. Without any answer, Freya stood still, and the empress grinned.</p>
<p>“Now Miss de Bua is a very interesting person. And it’s very popular.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean popular?”</p>
