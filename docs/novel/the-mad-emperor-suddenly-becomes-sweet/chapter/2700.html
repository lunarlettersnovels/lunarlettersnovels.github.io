            <p>The light from the small window kept disturbing Freya’s sleep. She tried to move away from the light but found it difficult as her body felt heavy and stiff.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s like a fight, not a drink,” she thought to herself. Suddenly, she heard a low voice next to her say, “Miriam, I’m up.”</p>
<p>Freya was confused as to who this person was and why they were in her bed.</p>
<p>“Gasp!” she exclaimed as she realized she was not alone. She turned her head to see Lucius lying next to her with nothing on his upper body.</p>
<p>“What is this situation?” she stammered, feeling a sudden sobering sensation.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” she asked him.</p>
<p>“Well, first of all, this is my space,” Lucius replied casually.</p>
<p>Freya was shocked and confused, “Why am I in your place?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Let’s take it one step at a time,” Lucius suggested.</p>
<p>Freya noticed drool on her face and quickly wiped it away. She reached out to cover herself with a blanket, feeling embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Why are you taking off your clothes?” she asked Lucius, unable to look at him.</p>
<p>“I usually take off my clothes when I sleep,” he replied leisurely.</p>
<p>Freya was confused and unsure of what to do, but Lucius couldn’t help feeling a little hopeful after last night’s incident. Maybe Freya likes him too.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>Lucius, who had just come from a banquet and was heading straight to his office, couldn’t leave until late at night. He thought of Freya waiting for him, but he couldn’t dismiss his work.</p>
<p>“I will have dinner with Miss De Bua,” he thought to himself, trying to make excuses for not spending time with her. But when he found out that Freya was not at the Imperial Palace, he was embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Then where is she?” he asked.</p>
<p>“They said she was having dinner with her relative, Archer Walter,” came the reply.</p>
<p>Lucius felt a mix of relief and jealousy at the thought of Freya being with Archer. He knew that the claim about them being related was a lie, and he didn’t like the idea of them being close.</p>
<p>“This jealousy is really ugly,” he thought to himself, feeling ashamed of his own lack of generosity.</p>
<p>“Is this to repay the benefactor?” he wondered, his feelings becoming clear to him.</p>
<p>“You’re talking about grace,” he realized, acknowledging that he loved Freya. The half-baked love that started in the orphanage has now fully blossomed.</p>
<p>“It’s a big problem that I’m feeling alone,” he thought as he arrived to see Freya’s face resting on the table. He gathered himself and called out her name.</p>
<p>“Freya!”</p>
<p>Both he and Archer exclaimed in amazement as they approached the table and saw Freya, who was half asleep, grinning.</p>
<p>“Go, it’s a cat,” she said before falling asleep.</p>
<p>Archer, who was also drunk, tried to make excuses,</p>
<p>“I tried to stop.. hiccuping… Freya, no, De Bua, drank it at will.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who was staring at the bottle on the table, coolly ordered,</p>
<p>“Archer, I order you to abstain from drinking for half a year.”</p>
<p>Archer, with a red face, tried to protest but fell to the floor. Lucius walked past him and picked up Freya, who hugged him.</p>
<p>“Gemini, take care of this guy here,” he said, gesturing to a black, unclothed man who emerged from the shadows and began dragging Archer away.</p>
<p>“Freya, did I get a drunk fiancée?” Lucius asked, holding Freya in his arms as she reeked of alcohol and continued to flounder in her sleep.</p>
<p>“Lucius, don’t go,” Freya said in a small voice, causing Lucius to stop on his way to his horse. He had originally intended to take her to her bedroom in the Imperial Palace, but he didn’t want to.</p>
<p>“Freya, when can I tell you everything?” he wondered. He couldn’t tell her the secret he was keeping or the strong feelings he had for her.</p>
<p>Freya felt sick as soon as he put her down in a small bedroom attached to his private home.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God,” she exclaimed, as he had to change his clothes due to her spittle.</p>
<p>“There are only a few people I know here, so I can’t call them employees,” Lucius said, as he picked up some water and wiped off her face, lips, and clothes. He then carefully took off his shirt, revealing his clean and well-toned chest to Freya’s view.</p>
