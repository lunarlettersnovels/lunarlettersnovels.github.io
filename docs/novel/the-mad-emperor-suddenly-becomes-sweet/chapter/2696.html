        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“Miss de Bua….”</p>
<p>It was when Gabriel, who was fascinated with the portraits, was about to say something to Freya. The old woman, who was passing by the end of the hallway, dropped the knitting materials that she was holding on the floor and ran towards her.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! Your sister is back.”</p>
<p>A short, old woman hugged Freya’s waist tightly and shed heavy tears.</p>
<p>“Mildred, Mildred. This isn’t her. I’m sorry, Freya.” Gabriel abruptly explained.</p>
<p>Mildred was Diverto’s family’s long-term maid who served their mother.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to fool me, young master. “Even if my memory is fading, I’m not stupid to not recognize my master.”</p>
<p>Even though the old woman couldn’t say Freya’s name clearly because of her false teeth, she seemed to think it was Countess Diverto.</p>
<p>“Stop crying over there. It’s not good if you keep on crying.”</p>
<p>It was embarrassing, though, and it was pathetic to see an old woman crying in her arms. Freya realized how much she had missed her when she cried so loudly when seeing a strange woman.</p>
<p><em>I don’t think we look that much alike, but was there something similar?</em></p>
<p>When Freya’s eyes touched the portrait again, Gabriel, whose eyes were red, opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“That portrait is me, my father, my mother, and my sister.”</p>
<p>“……Ah.”</p>
<p>A small boy who had plump cheeks with redness grew up like this. What has happened to the Diverto family? There was little doubt in Freya’s eyes. Gabriel ordered two other maids to take Mildred.</p>
<p>“Mildred was my mother’s maid, but she was my sister’s nanny.”</p>
<p>“You look very uncomfortable right now.”</p>
<p>“She’s old, and she’s been through a lot of hard times.”</p>
<p>Mildred, who suffered the death of her host and the kidnapping of Diverto’s daughter at almost the same time, lost her mind at some point.</p>
<p>“I think she’s a good woman, which is unfortunate.”</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry for her rude behavior.”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t feel bad at all.”</p>
<p>Even if it was an illusion, it felt very good that someone welcomed her. Almost past the corridor, Freya’s gaze glanced at the family portrait again.</p>
<p>“Did you have a good tour?”</p>
<p>The count, who was waiting in the receiving area, looked happy when the two entered.</p>
<p>“Mildred was disrespectful, but Miss De Bua was generous.”</p>
<p>“Well, I apologize again for Mildred’s behavior.”</p>
<p>She was only embarrassed by the count’s polite bowing. Freya, who was in a hurry, bent down together.</p>
<p>“At this rate, I’ll have to apologize all the time.”</p>
<p>At Gabriel’s mischievous words, Freya and the count looked up and looked awkward.</p>
<p>She barely sat down and took a sip. It was her first time tasting this kind of tea.</p>
<p>“It’s a tea made of flowers that only come from our estates.”</p>
<p>Freya, who nodded at Gabriel’s explanation, seemed to have a slight tingling on the tip of her tongue. Then immediately, the sensation of the lips and tongue became dull.</p>
<p>The count looked at Freya’s face with startled eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t think Miss De Bua fits this tea. Gabrielle, hurry up and get the doctor. Let go of yourself.”</p>
<p>“Yes, father!”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. This will get better over time.”</p>
<p>“You can’t do that to the guests of the Deverto family. Isn’t she the precious fiancee of my benefactor?”</p>
<p>The eyes of the middle-aged count who was saying that turned red, and a stream of tears flowed down his cheeks.</p>
<p>“No, why all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Freya was at a loss to see how the count was overreacting.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, count, I’m fine. It’s a little tingling, but it doesn’t hurt.”</p>
<p>As the count began to cry, she couldn’t remember any manners that Francesca had taught her.</p>
<p><em>Oh my god.</em></p>
<p>Freya, who jumped up, went to the count’s side and grabbed his hand.</p>
<p>“Hey, stop crying.”</p>
<p>A rather rough consolation flowed from her mouth, who did not know how to tenderly soothe people.</p>
<p>Allergies caused by flowers were treated quickly with drugs brought by the clinic. There was a slight dullness on the tongue and lips, but it was bearable.</p>
<p>Freya, who was groping her lips in the carriage returning, was lost in deep thought. She couldn’t get an idea out of her head.</p>
<p><em>If anyone knew, they would laugh at me.</em></p>
<p>Unable to withstand Sofia’s harsh beating as a child, she always imagined this.</p>
<p><em>I’m the daughter of an aristocrat, and I came to the orphanage for a reason.</em></p>
<p>That her parents would show up to find her someday. She had such a vain dream for a while. If she won’t imagine anything ridiculous, she’s going to go crazy.</p>
<p>“But it’s a little different from then.”</p>
<p>There was something hidden that was hard to explain, not a wild imagination. That’s how her instincts cried out.</p>
<p>Freya’s world was full of chaos, and it was only herself that could be trusted. It was also the driving force behind not being beaten to death or starved to death.</p>
<p>“But will the count be all right?</p>
<p>It wasn’t a visit for nothing, it was a reproach.</p>
<p>Earlier, Count Diverto patted Freya’s hand, sobbing louder at her comfort.</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry. The truth is…’</p>
<p>The moment he saw Freya’s face that saved him, he couldn’t forget her.</p>
<p>He was obsessed with the idea that if his daughter, who was lost decades ago, was alive, she would be as big as Freya. He knows it was a ridiculous idea, but he doesn’t think Mildred’s delusion is anything but strange.</p>
<p>The count, who was wiping away tears, took something out of his arms with his trembling hands. It was a necklace, and he carefully opened the rocket on it and showed it.</p>
<p>‘It’s my wife and daughter.’</p>
<p>The lady in the faded photo kept with her short brown hair really looked like Freya.</p>
<p>‘Forgive me for bringing this up without asking permission.’</p>
<p>‘No, It’s fine.’</p>
<p>The count checked Freya’s face and went on.</p>
<p>‘My daughter disappeared, leaving only her navel here.’</p>
<p>One night, a newborn baby was kidnapped.</p>
<p>‘Everything was my fault.’</p>
<p>Countess Diverto, who had been wandering around the cradle all day, lost her mind and died from depression.</p>
<p>The reason why the count has been living a miserable life so far is to find his daughter.</p>
<p>‘I want to tell my daughter that I had never forgotten her.’</p>
<p>Freya’s eyes were reddened by the count’s words.</p>
<p>‘How happy she would be to hear this. Her father is such a good man.’</p>
<p>Freya hoped that the count would meet his long-lost daughter.</p>
<p>‘I’m so sorry for this disgraceful behavior. It’s weird. I’ve never talked about this except for my son.….’</p>
<p>Sweatdrops formed on the count’s forehead, which began to tremble, and soon he began to tear his heart away.</p>
<p>‘Count, count.’</p>
<p>It was the same situation she encountered the previous day.</p>
<p>‘I have to find the medicine!’</p>
<p>Freya opened the cane near the sofa and quickly put the medicine under his tongue.</p>
<p>‘Bell, Miriam. Come here and help me.’</p>
<p>The three laid the trembling count on the sofa and raised his neck to drink water. Freya, who confirmed that the pill was safely crossed the neck, took a breather and a doctor arrived.</p>
<p>‘Miss De Bua, are you all right?’</p>
<p>‘Please look at the count first. Suddenly, he was tapping his heart….’</p>
<p>‘Father, father!’</p>
<p>‘Fortunately, you seem to have overcome the emergency.’</p>
<p>The doctor checked his condition, and Gabriel rubbed the count’s hand by his side for a long time.</p>
<p>‘Thank you for saving my father twice.’</p>
<p>‘No, thank God.’</p>
<p>Freya waved her hand and Gabriel fell on one knee in front of her.</p>
<p>‘I, Gabriel Diverto, swear to be a knight for you.’</p>
<p>Freya’s eyes widened at the sudden situation. Her swollen lips are uncomfortable and she cares about the count’s act.</p>
<p>‘What do he mean, a knight for me?’</p>
<p>She had heard that aristocrats sometimes have knights who swear loyalty. Although Lucius said Gemini did, and Hart did.</p>
<p>‘I’m not even a real aristocrat.’</p>
<p>She can’t hear the knighthood of a man as high as Viscount Deverto. She refused again and again, but Gabriel rarely gave up.</p>
