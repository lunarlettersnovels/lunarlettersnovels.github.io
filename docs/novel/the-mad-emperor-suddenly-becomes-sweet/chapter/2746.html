            <p>It was after quite some time that Lucius noticed something strange.</p>
<p>“Luuu…Lucio…”</p>
<p>He suffered from nightmares from months ago. When he lay in bed at night, someone looked for him with a sobbing voice. He couldn’t sleep properly, and the next day, he suffered from a severe headache. Lucius complained about his pain to Milady, and she offered to help, but the nightmare continued.</p>
<p><em>I can’t be the one who promised my mother like this.</em></p>
<p>Lucius plucked up his courage, thinking of his late mother.</p>
<p><em>It isn’t a ghost.</em></p>
<p>One day, Lucius pretended to have fallen asleep and covered himself with a blanket. Then someone opened the door and appeared and made a creepy sound.</p>
<p><em>As expected, it was not a ghost but a person.</em></p>
<p>One of the servants took Milady’s order to make a gloomy voice while hanging around on Lucius’ bed.</p>
<p>At first, Lucius didn’t believe it, but he realized it after repeated bizarre actions repeatedly.</p>
<p><em>All the sweet voices were false.</em></p>
<p>The soft cotton candy-like world that the child believed in collapsed.</p>
<p>Once he began to doubt it, he was out of control. He thought he saw and heard something which is not there. He was hallucinating.</p>
<p>“How pathetic was that?” he recalled.</p>
<p>Milady wanted to end his life cleverly. The milk contained poison, and a faceless man suddenly swung a sword at him. The result of believing the way it was, was terrible.</p>
<p>Without Hero and Gemini, he would not be here today.</p>
<p>Lucius’ bright personality got darker and darker. Then he faced a lifetime crisis. He almost died in the fire and managed to escape and stay in a strange place.</p>
<p><em>Yes. I met Freya there.</em></p>
<p>He had nothing, and he was comfortable with her, not with anyone. Lucius didn’t know that he, who had been in the palace all the time, would be able to get along with someone.</p>
<p><em>She didn’t know about me.</em></p>
<p>Freya was not pessimistic about life and not afraid to try new things. He learned a lot from her, who calmly accepted fate. Lucius was always knitted and cleaned.</p>
<p>“I hope to eat a lot of cake.”</p>
<p>It was Freya’s simple wish. So, Lucius’ eagerly wanted to be strong. He tried to gain more strength than he originally had.</p>
<p><em>Freya, I want to show you something that I’m not afraid of anything.</em></p>
<p>Freya was such a precious person. She always readily gave him some food with a smile.</p>
<p><em>But I forgot you, it’s pathetic.</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted to repay you.</em></p>
<p>She was his savior, the first and last friend to make him live on the most challenging day of his life.</p>
<p><em>Yes. I might curse myself for being selfish now.</em></p>
<p>Lucius’ blue eyes gradually deepened as he watched Freya sleep, leaning against the wagon window.</p>
<p><em>Will you smile at me like that soon?</em></p>
<p>While back in the barracks where Lucius was riding a horse at the forefront, he saw Freya conversing with Archer, which was different from what she usually showed him.</p>
<p>“That was how you smile.”</p>
<p>When she stayed at his barracks, she always frowned or had a mouth sticking out.</p>
<p>“Why is she glancing at the cornfield so often?”</p>
<p>An ominous hunch wrapped around his whole body. And after a while, his prediction became a reality. Freya, who was next to Archer, disappeared.</p>
<p>“She said she’s taken a break for a while, but where did she go?”</p>
<p>Lucius jumped off the horse at the appearance of Archer, who was restless. Hero, who noticed that his expression was unusual, stepped up.</p>
<p>“If you remove all the cornfields by magic, it is easy for us to find her. If she’s lost, she’ll come to us right away,” Gemini asked Hero.</p>
<p>“No. I’ll take care of this with my own hands.” Lucius blocked Gemini, who was preparing to search directly with the soldier.</p>
<p><em>Freya, did you run away from me?</em></p>
<p>Anger soon shifted to nervousness. He cut countless corns over his height. The saliva in his mouth dried up, but still, he couldn’t find Freya.</p>
<p><em>Freya, where the hell are you hiding?</em></p>
<p>It was because of that damn contract.</p>
<p><em>It’s all because of me. I forced myself to hold you.</em></p>
<p>He blamed himself severely, and finally, Freya’s back came in front of him. He found her.</p>
<p>Lucius was about to feel relieved when suddenly a fierce beast came in front of her. The energy of pulling a sword alone could handle such a beast, but Lucius did not.</p>
<p>He approached Freya silently and covered her eyes.</p>
<p><em>You don’t have to be scared. Let me see all kinds of dirty and ugly things instead.</em></p>
<p>Hiding his words, Lucius stabbed the beast’s heart that was rushing toward them. After killing the beast, he proudly turned toward Freya.</p>
<p>Blood flowed from his hands, even though he was intentionally injured. However, Lucius couldn’t think of anything when he looked back at Freya. Freya’s face, which seemed to have suffered all day, was heartbroken. He could only do to hold her hand.</p>
<p>His whole body trembled lightly, recalling his sense of that time.</p>
<p><em>We won’t break up again.</em></p>
<p>Lucius reached out and made Freya’s head fall asleep and lean against his shoulder.</p>
<p><em>Freya, sweet dreams.</em></p>
<p>“Your Highness.” Hero stuttered as if he had seen a ghost on the other side.</p>
<p>“Why?” As Lucius raised his chin, Hero shook his hand.</p>
<p>“It’s scary because you do something before you didn’t do.”</p>
<p>“…shut up.” In response to Lucius’ fierce answer, Hero fiddled with his cape sleeves. The condition of the electric charge was strange.</p>
<p><em>What should I do? Is your gone Highness crazy?</em></p>
<p>That’s why he was curious about the story Gemini told him.</p>
<p><em>Your Highness was attracted to an ordinary woman?</em></p>
<p>His Highness showed an extraordinary interest in Freya. Of course, it was far from likable, but he tried to keep it by his side anyway.</p>
<p><em>She is only a servant.</em></p>
<p>It is fortunate to show interest in the opposite sex, but it was hard to say that all of them were good.</p>
<p><em>Your Highness must be engaged to Lady Selena.</em></p>
<p>To strengthen his position to become the future Emperor, Lady Selena’s support, coming from an influential family, is needed.</p>
