            <p>“You don’t remember anything from the cave?” Lucius asked Freya innocently.</p>
<p>Freya’s eyes grew wide at the mention of the cave. She was certain Lucius had a high fever at the time and thought he wouldn’t recall anything.</p>
<p>“Is this a dream?” she wondered.</p>
<p>“Were we in a cave?” Freya asked. “I don’t know, I’ve never been there.” All she could offer was a weak excuse.</p>
<p>“Freya, you’re a terrible liar,” Lucius stated.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please stop,” Freya pleaded. “We’re not in a relationship that allows for this conversation.”</p>
<p>She was now aware of the danger she faced if she was caught touching a member of the royal family. Freya, who was fearless at first, became frightened of the world after coming to the palace. If she committed a crime against the imperial family, she would be locked away in a dungeon and never see the light of day again.</p>
<p>“I need to stay away from you,” Freya said.</p>
<p>Lucius demanded that she abandon her illusions. Freya shook her long hair as he recited slowly, admiring it.</p>
<p>“Freya, I don’t think I can let you go,” Lucius said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Freya asked, trembling as she covered her lips. Wasn’t this a promise? They had a binding contract. The terms of the agreement were simple. Freya was hired by Lucius for a year, which is why she was acting as Freya de Bua.</p>
<p>“We have three months left,” Lucius reminded her.</p>
<p>One side of Freya’s chest ached as he spoke. Perhaps she was unconsciously counting down the days.</p>
<p>She wished time would stop, or that all this would pass quickly and she could forget everything. Freya couldn’t figure out what she truly wanted.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how I feel. Does that make sense?” Freya thought to herself.</p>
<p>She hated herself for wanting to forget how warm Lucius’ strong arms were and how wonderful his short smile was in the cold. She despised her heart for beating so wildly with such small gestures.</p>
<p>“This is just a dream,” Freya thought.</p>
<p>She lowered her hand from her lips and looked Lucius in the eye.</p>
<p>“Freya?” Lucius said.</p>
<p>“I can do whatever I want since it’s my dream, right?” Freya responded.</p>
<p>“Freya, you’re not dreaming,” Lucius stated.</p>
<p>“You’re lying,” Freya retorted, not falling for his lie despite having had too much to drink. She reached out and touched his cheek, something she had always wanted to do.</p>
<p>“It’s hard for me to bear,” Lucius said in a voice that seemed to be suppressed. Freya continued to feel his face as if she couldn’t hear him.</p>
<p>“I wish you weren’t the crown prince,” Freya said.</p>
<p>“What would it have been like if we met at an orphanage like mine?” she asked, instead of answering Lucius’ question. Freya leaned forward, still looking up at him as if under a spell. She wrapped her arms around his neck and rested her cheek on the top of his head.</p>
<p>“What should I do?” Freya asked, her heart fluttering from his strong scent. She was about to cry. She didn’t realize she had Lucius so deeply ingrained in her heart.</p>
<p>“Your Highness….”</p>
<p>“Yes, Freya. Tell me anything.”</p>
<p>Lucius’ body in her arms trembled strongly.</p>
<p>“I don’t like you at all.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>Freya’s confession was whispered to him very quietly.</p>
<p>“Because I don’t like it, because it’s a dream.”</p>
<p>Her hands caressed Lucius’ cheeks. When they slightly bent their knees, their eyes got tangled up in the middle of the dark bedroom.</p>
<p>“You hate me, Freya.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I’m crazy about you alone.”</p>
<p>She murmured as she gazed at Lucius’ lips. Freya kissed him gently on the cheek and looked into his eyes.</p>
<p>It was hard to take her eyes off him.</p>
<p>“Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Call me Lucius.”</p>
<p>“Ru…”</p>
<p>When Freya, who couldn’t bear to call his name, blurted the end of his words, Lucius’ lips covered hers.</p>
<p>Freya’s eyes were round when their lips touched.</p>
<p>She had been longing for a kiss with him all along, but doing it was completely different from what she imagined. She was overwhelmed with unknown excitement by the feeling of his moist lips. As his hot breath flowed into her, she gasped.</p>
<p>“Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Call me by name.”</p>
<p>Their eyes met, and Lucius smiled.</p>
<p>“Why are you so surprised?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not….”</p>
<p>Freya reached out and tried to stop him, but Lucius was adamant.</p>
<p>“Freya, it’s so soft that my hands are melting.”</p>
<p>His whispering voice was so wonderful.</p>
<p>Freya dropped her hand to her lower abdomen. His kiss on her forehead made Freya wish she had a few more happy dreams.</p>
