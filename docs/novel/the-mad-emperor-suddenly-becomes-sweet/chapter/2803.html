            <p>When Lucius laughed at her, Milady signaled to the soldier guarding the chamber. Soldiers armed with spears rushed to attack Lucius all at once.</p>
<p>“As you well know, attacking the Crown Prince is an act of treason.”</p>
<p>“It’s not treason if you’re not the Crown Prince.”</p>
<p>When her mask shattered, Milady didn’t bother to hide her true intentions.</p>
<p>“Anyone who opposes me will suffer the same fate as the Crown Prince.”</p>
<p>Despite the daunting threat, Lucius remained seated and calmly signaled to Gemini. At Gemini’s command, the building shook, and a deafening roar echoed outside.</p>
<p>“What’s that noise?”</p>
<p>Milady looked out to see an army of soldiers armed with spears pointing directly at her.</p>
<p>“You coward. I can’t believe you hid a soldier like that.”</p>
<p>“When dealing with a witch who sets fire to children’s rooms, this is the least we can do, Mother.”</p>
<p>“I… I…”</p>
<p>Milady was humiliated and at a loss for words. However, giving up now was never an option. She sent a signal to Count Edelion.</p>
<p>“The Edelion family stands firmly behind Emperor Hart.”</p>
<p>The count’s words carried great weight, representing the entire southern region of the country. Hero, who was listening, sighed deeply and pulled his cloak closer around himself. That’s why he strongly supported the alliance between Selena and the aristocracy. Among these nobles, someone was needed to support the prince’s aspirations.</p>
<p>No matter how skilled he is in military strategy or how powerful his wizardry is, the prince will need the support of the nobles to become an emperor who can rule over both the people and the aristocracy.</p>
<p>Hero looked troubled as a figure appeared outside the conference room. Count Diverto and his son Gabriel, who had brown hair and green eyes, walked in slowly. The aristocrat whispered something in his ear.</p>
<p>“Why is Count Diverto here?”</p>
<p>Few had seen his face in many years, but his seat remained at the round table, and he sat there comfortably. He seemed unfazed by the tense and unusual atmosphere in the room.</p>
<p>“I believe I have a say in this matter, correct?”</p>
<p>Count Diverto, who had entered the conference room for the first time in a very long time, hesitated at the edge of the table before speaking.</p>
<p>“Of course, count Diverto.”</p>
<p>Milady allowed him to speak, but she didn’t really care about his opinion.</p>
<p>“He’s a toothless tiger now,” she thought.</p>
<p>Count Diverto placed his hand over his heart and then paused before slowly speaking.</p>
<p>“The Diverto family will support Prince Lucius.”</p>
<p>“What? What are you…?”</p>
<p>Milady was taken aback by the sudden announcement, but it seemed that only Count Diverto and his son were unsurprised by the news. After finishing his speech, the room fell silent as the count sat down again.</p>
<p>Lucius looked just as bewildered, and Hero whispered to him, but he shrugged his shoulders in response. He didn’t know how this turn of events would play out either. What was clear, however, was that with the support of Count Diverto, the legitimacy of his actions was bolstered. The writer Diverto Baek, second only to the imperial family in terms of traditional writers, had sworn allegiance to him. Lucius thought to himself that even the goddess Diana seemed to be on his side.</p>
<p>There was a time when he believed that God had abandoned him after losing his mother and being in danger of death many times. His hands were stained with blood from repeated wars, and the smell of rotting corpses filled his nostrils. Perhaps if he had continued to live like that, he would have never found God.</p>
<p>But then he met Freya again at the end of hell, and memories of losing her flooded back. The thought of her made him feel alive and excited, and everything went according to plan.</p>
<p>But he wanted to give her more than just a cake; he wanted to give her the entire empire.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you the whole empire, Freya,” he said with a faint smile, which was rare for him. When Lucius laughed as if he had won all the games, the angry Milady foamed at the mouth.</p>
<p>“I only follow the documents of His Majesty the Emperor,” she said.</p>
<p>“You’re putting out a son who’s not even of imperial blood,” he replied coolly, and Milady pounded on the table.</p>
<p>“What are you saying? No matter what, I am the Empress of Morsiani. Show some respect!”</p>
<p>“Oh, my. Are you still playing the soldier of my mother? Deceive the emperor over there, catch a woman who conspired against treason, and lock her up in a tower.”</p>
<p>“Hart!” Milady screamed as he walked out of the meeting room without saying a word.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, the tower is too elegant. Put her in a cellar,” he said, and Milady’s eyes widened with madness.</p>
<p>“No one can stop me,” she said, grabbing Michael’s hand. He stood behind her like a stone, his face remaining impassive even in this precarious situation.</p>
