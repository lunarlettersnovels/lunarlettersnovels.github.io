            <p>“Your Majesty, need I remind you, it costs a huge amount to maintain all the weapons, horses, and feed the mercenaries… even during the duration of Count’s visit.”</p>
<p>Gemini cleared his throat and adjusted his sword consciously at the wizard’s words. They were caught in unfavourable circumstances and needed more than just good tactics and winning battles to continue the reign.</p>
<p>Lucius grimaced at Herro’s words.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“You’re… going hunting?” Freya probed curiously.</p>
<p>“Yes,” The King replied shortly.</p>
<p>Freya bustled about the King, dressing him in a leather vest while also shooting him questioning glances. In whatever time she’d spent with the King, she had never once seen him be vivacious about hunting. Unlike the rumors spread about him, he wasn’t always bathed in the blood of people or animals for the pleasure of it.</p>
<p>“Maybe he’s just a little out of it,” Freya thought as she nodded to herself.</p>
<p>“Get ready, you’re going with me,” The King ordered, breaking Freya out of her thoughts.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, me? But I don’t know how to ride or hunt,” Freya emphasised, hoping to dissuade him.</p>
<p>“No one said you were going to ride,” He replied and Freya frowned as she realised he wanted her to carry his things. She packed extra clothes and got herself ready for hunting. The leather bag she held was heavy and she huffed as she dragged it. As she followed the King outside, Selena stood to greet them, her fanciful clothes shining in the sunlight. She wore a beautiful puffy white dress with a red jacket on top. Freya watched her with saucer eyes, her mouth hanging open at the lady’s effortless beauty.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty Lucius, I’m so happy you accepted my request.”</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t answer, choosing to grind his teeth silently. Herro quickly spoke in his place.</p>
<p>“Miss Selena, you look exquisite today,” He smiled as he bent down to lay a peck on her dainty hand.</p>
<p>“Oh my, you flatter me,” She giggled slowly, covering her face with her mouth delicately as if she were shy.</p>
<p>“Shall we get a move on?” Lucius cut through abruptly, and it was apparent through his demeanor that he wasn’t particularly happy about this situation. He rode forward and Selena quickly joined his side.</p>
<p>Behind them, Gemini rode with a cavalry of soldiers wielding their swords and spears. Freya walked alone behind the procession, thinking to herself. “The other side is trying to kill us and they are out here enjoying hunting,”</p>
<p>When her thoughts shifted towards Archer and the wounds he came with sometimes, she felt a wave of displeasure go through her. She quickly sighed, she knew she couldn’t do anything about it even if she didn’t like it.</p>
<p>Her gaze flicked towards the front of the procession. The hunt was a treat for the Count, and his daughter, the fair Selena. She admired the way Selena spoke, the air of confidence yet simplicity that hung about her. Freya wouldn’t have been able to imitate it even if she tried.</p>
<p>She huffed as she dragged the heavy buffalo skin bag. Why did they feel the need to change their clothes at the hunting grounds, Freya would never understand. The scout who was assigned with her was nowhere to be seen but she could hear the sounds of the hunting horn bellowing in the distance and could estimate where the procession might be.</p>
<p>“I’ll just rest for a bit,” Freya declared to herself and sat under the shade of a large comforting tree, plucking a grass blade from the ground and placing it between her teeth thoughtfully. She envisioned her future, a little house paired with a farm and a beautiful garden. If she saved coins for herself each month, she’d be able to achieve her goal.</p>
<p>It would be better to move to the north, as the south wasn’t much plentiful for paupers like herself, then her thoughts shifted to Lottie and she gripped her hands. “I wonder if she’s doing well,” Freya grimaced and sighed deeply. She hated that she had to leave him as she did. She should’ve just grabbed him and ran.</p>
<p>She spat on the grass and heard the faraway sounds of the horn. A flock of birds flew up in a flurry and Freya gave a grim smile, someone was successful in his hunt.</p>
<p>She mused over her swordsmanship skills and realised she should practice. Gemini had told her that her body wasn’t fit for a longsword but she could use a dagger and practice on her surprise attacks. She grabbed a stick from the ground and practiced swinging.</p>
<p>“It would look ridiculous to someone.” She laughed and continued swinging, her body heating up as her movements quickened and she repeated her moves.</p>
<p>After a while, she grew hungry, and sat on the ground, devouring the bread she brought along with her. She lifted her head and sniffed the air, realising it would probably rain. She didn’t consider herself superstitious but a disaster always occurred on rainy days.</p>
<p>Freya suddenly realised she’d strayed far too long from the royal company. She was Lucius’s servant, after all, she needed to take care of him. So she picked up the heavy bag and made her way towards the King.</p>
<p>Repetition was the only meaning of becoming skilled. She was hungry as she moved quite a bit. Freya took out a piece of bread and started to chew on it a little.</p>
<p>To get to the King, she needed to go through the forest and cross a wide river. She sighed and wished she’d gone with the King earlier. She walked quickly, her head down. All of a sudden, a scream pitched through the forest and Freya froze, her back flooded with cold sweat in an instant. Her eyes fell upon the origin of the sound and she quickly hid behind a tree. Before she was an army of men who wore uniforms unfamiliar to her.</p>
<p>She realised the soldiers were advancing towards the place where she’d last spotted the King’s cavalry. Her heartbeat quickened as she realised something bad might unfold in front of her, her body caught in the unease she felt when Sophia had beat her senseless. Freya remembered Archer’s words. King Lucius wasn’t just protecting the outskirts but the entire Morciani Empire.</p>
<p>She needed to warn the King, he was in danger. At that moment, she thought about nothing but Lucius and his blonde head.</p>
