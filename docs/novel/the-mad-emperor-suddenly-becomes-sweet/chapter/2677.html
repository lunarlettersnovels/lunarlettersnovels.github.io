            <p>Freya intended to ignore it, but as the attic scene unfolded before her eyes in his story, she couldn’t help but reminisce about her childhood with Ruth. Even when they were young, they laughed while playing games with Mom and Dad that they had never played before. Ruth’s expression that she wanted to play the role of her father because she was a man was amazing.</p>
<p>It meant that Freya was already an adult. In Ruth’s eyes, who could not know the facts, their words seemed just like cute whining. They were small and precious, and she wanted to protect them. Together, they made a cake out of the mud and pretended to pull out candles.</p>
<p>As she reflected on this memory, Freya couldn’t help but think how pathetic she must have looked in Ruth’s eyes. She even asked him, the crown prince, if he had seen a cake. Perhaps this was the reason why Lucius bought a cake that didn’t fit in.</p>
<p>“I had no idea,” Lucius replied.</p>
<p>“Well, who knows what’s going on in there?” she said.</p>
<p>“Freya, Freya,” Lucius called out to her, and when Freya came to her senses, he held her tightly and kept calling her name. Freya tried to turn a blind eye to the voice, but his grip on her waist was too tight for her to ignore.</p>
<p>“Let go of this hand,” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s because it’s cold.”</p>
<p>“Then let go of this. I’ll put more firewood in the stove.”</p>
<p>“Freya, look at me,” he said.</p>
<p>As she turned around, Freya’s heart began to race at the sight of him. His blue eyes were shining brightly as he asked her, “Freya, what would you choose between gold and later?”</p>
<p>A memory suddenly came to her mind, and Freya blushed at the thought of how different Ruth’s question had been. In the past, Ruth had felt like a younger brother who wanted to protect her, but now Lucius was holding her tightly.</p>
<p><em>“It’s not cute at all,”</em> she thought to herself.</p>
<p>Freya remembered how she had preferred Ruth and had said, “<em>I can earn a lot of gold.”</em></p>
<p>As Lucius pressed against her toned muscles, he seemed to be urging for an answer. Freya cleared her throat and responded in a cold tone, “Of course, gold is better.”</p>
<p>Lucius noticed that Freya had changed a lot since the last time they had talked. Freya tried to get him to leave her alone by saying, “Not as much as your Highness has changed.” However, as the shadows thickened over the snow, Lucius leaned in closer.</p>
<p>“I think you answered a little differently in the past,” he whispered, holding Freya’s hair band in his hand.</p>
<p>Freya was taken aback by Lucius’s sudden proximity, and before she knew it, their lips touched. She quickly pulled back and covered her mouth with her hand.</p>
<p>“Why do you have to stick your lips out there?” she questioned, feeling embarrassed.</p>
<p>Lucius seemed unfazed and responded, “What does it matter? I don’t mind choosing gold or anything. I’m going to give you both anyway.”</p>
<p>His eyes burned with intensity, and his red lips were wet with his tongue. Freya was flustered by the sudden advance and pushed his head away. However, his large hand blocked her, and his hot fingers lifted the tip of her chin.</p>
<p>Freya felt uncomfortable as Lucius continued to press her, asking if he was better than gold.</p>
<p>“I made that promise to Ruth, not to your Highness,” she reminded him, trying to resist his advances. But Lucius wasn’t deterred and leaned in even closer, whispering,</p>
<p>“Now you know everything. That’s all I am.”</p>
<p>Despite her protests, Lucius continued to make advances toward Freya. He reminded her that she was the first person to ever kiss him and moved in to do so again, causing her to feel flustered and embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Please stop,” she begged, but Lucius didn’t seem to care.</p>
<p>Freya grew increasingly agitated as Lucius continued to make suggestive comments and touch her.</p>
<p>“What kind of body are you talking about?” she asked, her voice growing shrill with surprise. Lucius blew a hot breath on her forehead, causing her to feel itchy and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“You touched my naked back,” he said, his eyes growing wild and crazy. “You stroked your chest and shoulders. You’re the only one who’s ever allowed my body, so it’s natural for you to take responsibility for me.”</p>
<p>Freya was frightened by Lucius’s intensity and his dark, piercing eyes. She remembered the rumors she had heard about him being a dangerous person, and she felt like they might be true.</p>
<p>“We can’t be the same anymore,” she said, trying to distance herself from him. But her words only seemed to make him more furious.</p>
