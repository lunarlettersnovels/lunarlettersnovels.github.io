        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her excited and seductive tone was driving Lucius wild as he moved his hand to Freya’s flat lower abdomen before sliding it between her silky smooth thighs and gently caressing her cl*toris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, he let out a loud moan, “I can’t take it anymore, Freya!” In an instant, his rock-hard er*ction, which had been raging from a while ago, penetrated her flesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aah!” She gasped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius’s p*nis filled her soft, wet insides as he slowly moved in and out of her. Freya couldn’t open her eyes because of the intense pleasure as his red-hot love pierced her body. Without him even kissing her, she couldn’t control her breathing, and she begged him as he started to gyrate his waist, “Lucius! slowly!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violently grunting, he grabbed her chin and lifted her face, “Open your eyes and look at me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obliging him, she opened her eyes, seeing Lucius’s blue eyes focused on her through her hazy vision.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I am receiving his love.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sweat drops falling from Lucius’s forehead landed on her cheeks. As he gradually thrust in and out more vigorously, an uncontrollable pleasure fell over Freya; nothing on the planet turned her on more than this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I love you, Freya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After moaning and groaning so loudly during their lovemaking, her voice had become hoarse, but she managed to mumble, “Me too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they both reached the peak of their orgasms, the two held each other’s hands so tightly that their knuckles went white as they shook from the indescribable sensations coursing through their bodies.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a remote village up north, a woman crouched in a small field, her long brown hair blowing in the wind as she attempted to break through some gravel and the solid ground beneath it. Such earth was unsuitable for cultivation, and the pickax couldn’t pierce it. With all her strength, she brought the pickax down, but only a cloud of dust came up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it possible to plant crops here?” She muttered in irritation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had bought this land with all the money that she didn’t have to waste, and Freya felt like screaming as she recalled what the weasel-like broker, who had confidently recommended this place, had said, “This is the perfect home and field for you!” </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should go and find him and give him a beating! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freya’s eyes glistened from anger, but she knew that it would be best to avoid starting a commotion. It would be a pointless exercise, which would be a hassle and a waste of her time. “No time to complain,” she said, calming herself down. She was going to do this right and gradually work the land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing up and stretching her muscles after a long day of work, Freya wiped the beads of sweat from her forehead as the sun beamed down on her emerald-green eyes. Off in the distance, she saw a mountain range and was satisfied that her new home was quite far from the Imperial Palace. As Freya stood in the cool breeze of the afternoon, admiring her new surroundings, the memory of someone’s face popped into her mind. But it quickly faded when she heard the bells installed on the fence ringing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s that? The wind?” This part of the road was frequented more by animals than people, so she expected it to be a massive black bear or some other wild animal. Freya crept behind the house with the pickax by her side and bravely shouted, “Who is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she rounded the corner of the house, she saw that it was a person, not an animal, that had broken the fence. Someone was leaning against the smashed fencing, sprawled over it like hung laundry. As she approached the unidentified person, the saliva in her mouth dried up. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a big man!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> No matter how much Freya trained to keep herself fit, she had a slim chance of winning against a man of that size.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man was covered in dirt, yet his thick blonde hair was glistening under the sunlight, and seeing this made Freya’s heart race. “Hey, you here. Are you all right?” She called out as she cautiously approached him, but he didn’t respond because of his injuries. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think he can hurt me, considering the condition he’s in.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scanning the surroundings, she didn’t see any witnesses. “I should take care of this fast.” Setting the pickaxe on the ground, Freya lowered the man from the fence. The moment she checked his face, she let out a scream and reflexively covered her hands over her mouth, “Lucius!” How in the world did he end up here like this? She had two choices: either turn a blind eye to him or help him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sighing heavily, Freya looked around in all directions and then made up her mind to move him inside the house. She raced to the shed, returning soon after, with a thick leather harness, and then pulled him on it so that she could drag him to the house. Sweat dripped down her back as she struggled to move forward with him. “He’s too heavy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, after an agonizing hour of pulling him across the hard ground, she crossed the threshold of the front door and laid Lucius down on a soft blanket near the old wood stove. The fence needed mending, and she quickly went back outside to attend to it. After that, she cleared Lucius’s tracks by following the path he had taken. Even while taking care of the situation, her thoughts were consumed by the man she had left alone in her house, and she shook her head in disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dusk fell as she returned to the house feeling exhausted, and Freya let out another long sigh as she stood with her back against the closed door. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was wanting to start a quiet new life too much to ask?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of all people, why me?” She asked as she looked up at the high ceiling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her big eyes reflected bright red as she looked at the pool of blood around Lucius’s limp body, and she jumped at the sight of him lying in such a poor condition. Covering her eyes with her hands to block out the ghastly sight of him, she frowned at the pain from the thorns in her fingertips. “This cannot be happening to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blanket that she had placed below Lucius was soaked with his blood, and she quickly brought him another one. While she was covering him, she whispered, “Let me look at your wounds.” But to do that, she had to take off his clothes. She was used to seeing naked bodies of men on the battlefield, but for some reason, her fingertips trembled slightly. Perhaps it was because it was only the two of them in this space. As she shook her head, her face was full of determination, “Lucius is only a patient now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She opened the first-aid kit that she’d fetched from the shelf in the kitchen and tried to check his wounds, but then, with his eyes still closed, he moaned, startling her.</span></p>
