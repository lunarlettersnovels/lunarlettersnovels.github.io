            <p>Soon, a trumpet sounded to signal the start of the hunt, and a pigeon flew into the sky. In accordance with the tradition that catching many foxes brings good luck to married couples, everyone began to run vigorously. Freya let out a short sigh and moved her horse slowly. Despite her discomfort with horseback riding, she moved forward.</p>
<p>Thoughts ran through her mind, “This is almost over.” Freya considered that it might not be useful to be next to Lucius, as she couldn’t help but think of his blonde hair that was like sunlight and his deep blue eyes. She ran her horse hard, trying to distance herself from Lucius, who was keeping pace next to her. The only thing she wanted was to be in a place where she wouldn’t be bothered.</p>
<p>As the hunt progressed, cheering voices could be heard everywhere. Count Edelion’s foxes seemed to be caught one after another. Lucius and Freya ran their horses towards the side of the hunting ground, with a large procession following them, making it difficult for the two to have a private conversation.</p>
<p>“Let’s take a break here,” said Lucius. An employee quickly set up a temporary tent and placed a chair and table on the cart. Soldiers stood guard, with sharp eyes, while the employee prepared tea and refreshments. Tensions were high due to previous attacks in the forest.</p>
<p>The two people sitting face to face were given warm tea, and Lucius tried to talk to Freya. However, he struggled to find the right words, and Freya felt like a stranger to him.</p>
<p>Apologizing for their behavior the day before, Lucius admitted to drinking too much due to work-related stress. Despite this being just an excuse, Lucius took a deep breath and continued speaking.</p>
<p>“I know I can be selfish at times, but could you please just wait a bit?”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I don’t understand what you’re referring to,” Freya replied, her voice cold yet still pleasing to hear. Lucius couldn’t help but gaze at her lips, despite the steam from the cup in front of her. It was amazing to him that he couldn’t remember how she sounded before.</p>
<p>“You have the same face as when we first met in the attic,” he said, his tone revealing his surprise at the familiarity. At that time, he felt alive but lacked energy, and was actually more animated when he was angry with her.</p>
<p>“It took me a while to regain my memory,” he admitted, explaining that he had kept her by his side in order to uncover the reason behind his repeated mistreatment.</p>
<p>“In truth, I may not have forgotten you at all,” Lucius declared, causing Freya’s heart to flutter at the earnestness in his words.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, what’s the point of this now?” she asked, shaking her head at the incredible coincidence of them reuniting as adults after meeting as children at the orphanage.</p>
<p>“We were never in a relationship,” Freya reminded him with a faint smile as she shook her long hair. It was her friendship with Ruth that helped her endure her life at the orphanage, and the prince in front of her represented hope.</p>
<p>“I was just a young girl searching for affection. I was just happy to meet a child who was even prettier than I was. It was like collecting a feather because of its pretty color,” Freya explained, reminiscing about their time together.</p>
<p>It makes Lucius feel good to take out the memory whenever he has a hard time, but Freya can’t have a bird flying vigorously in the sky.</p>
<p>“Do you really not understand how I feel?” Lucius asked.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Freya’s voice quivered a little as she replied. Lucius’ excessive kindness or perspective often made Freya’s heart sink. She was also caught up in the ridiculous illusion that he might like her.</p>
<p>Lucius roughly swept up Freya’s flowing blonde hair and whispered softly.</p>
<p>“I love you, Freya.”</p>
<p>The moment Freya heard Lucius’ confession, she felt trapped in a thin curtain, a space where only two people existed. Freya wondered what she had just heard, and even Lucius, who had made the confession, was surprised and covered his face with his hands.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to do it this way.”</p>
<p>Lucius had planned to confess in a nice place later when everything stabilized, but the words that filled his heart suddenly poured out.</p>
<p>“I’ll pretend I didn’t hear you.” Freya thought.</p>
<p>Lucius may feel the same way he did then. Freya thought she could do anything for Ruth, but even if Lucius left and didn’t come back, her feelings wouldn’t change.</p>
<p>She needed something she valued. The world was too stark for her to live without such a thing in her heart.</p>
<p>“You may just think of compassion or sympathy as love,” Freya said.</p>
<p>“Freya, I never sympathized with you,” Lucius replied.</p>
