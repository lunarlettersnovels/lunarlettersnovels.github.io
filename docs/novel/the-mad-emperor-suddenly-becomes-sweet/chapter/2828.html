        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was glorious weather for taking a walk. Under the cloudless blue sky, a gentle breeze blew, and Freya stood in the garden, admiring the fresh mixture of cherry tomatoes that she’d planted with her own hands. This was what the joy of harvesting must feel like, and she felt proud of her achievement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lucius! Come and look at this. Don’t they look so delicious?” She squealed in delight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking one of the well-grown cherry tomatoes from the bush, she smiled at Lucius, who stood staring blankly. He looked at her for a long time, with an indecipherable look in his blue eyes, before finally brushing his bangs to the side of his face and replying, “Yeah. It looks delicious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freya blushed for no apparent reason in response to his answer, which left an odd afterglow on her face. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looks especially handsome today, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she thought.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He was a man who shone brightly, even when standing in an underwhelming garden. The solid muscles that bulged underneath his broad shoulders could easily be seen under his thin shirt, which clung to his body whenever the wind blew. And, the exquisite combination of his sparkling blond hair and blue eyes could only be a blessing from God. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a handsome husband.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius’s thigh muscles tightened over his long legs as he strode casually toward Freya. Feeling shy for staring at him for so long, she reached out to him and asked, “Would you like to try a tomato?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius stood in front of her, looking her up and down, and then he grabbed Freya’s waist and slowly bent her backward; they were so close that they could feel each other’s breath on their skin. Feeling nervous for no reason, Freya gulped down saliva as Lucius slowly bent his head down and whispered, “What I am curious about is not that tomato, Freya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then what are you curious about?” She asked, almost faltering with her words. The look in Lucius’s eyes became more intense as he stared longingly into her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wh-wh-why are you looking at me like that?” she stuttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How am I looking at you?” Lucius joked as he held her around the waist tightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh,” she uttered, not knowing how to answer him. He looked like a predator living in the mountains that had finally found its prey, but Freya couldn’t say that to his face. While she was hesitating to speak, Lucius looked her directly in the eyes and whispered, “I want to plant a kiss on you right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re c-c-crazy!” she stuttered. No matter how rare it was to see people in this neighborhood, hunters and merchants passed by often, and Freya didn’t want to display affection in front of others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bewildered, when she hurriedly covered her mouth with her sleeve, he puckered up his lips, “It’ll be fine if no one sees us, right? So let’s go inside right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we just got here. We’re supposed to take a walk.” Freya, who had already been pestered by him last night, was feeling a bit tired. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t only want a kiss!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she held back what she wanted to say, Lucius’s eyes opened wider. “Maybe we can take a walk later.” And just like that, he gripped her wrist and dragged her down the cobbled pathway to the house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lucius, slow down!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius pushed the door open so forcefully that it sounded as if it would break in half! He let out a heavy sigh after moving Freya in front of the now-closed door as he murmured, “Freya, I want to kiss you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lucius. It is because of you that I can’t live my life!” Freya, who couldn’t control her racing heart, reached out and touched his cheeks. Lucius’s hands held her body tightly in the silence, and when she grabbed his neck, he placed his lips onto hers. And a strong desire that could no longer be contained seeped out through their parted lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, Freya. It feels so good.” His impatient desire echoed in their tangled breathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lucius. Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today he was more persistent than usual, giving her no room to breathe, he placed his lips on hers again, and his tongue tapped Freya’s lips through the slow kiss. “Open your mouth, Freya,” he whispered hungrily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But, what about our walk?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now,” he said, ignoring her question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lucius!” While calling his name, his soft red tongue slipped into her mouth. “Ah…” Freya couldn’t think straight as she felt her body tingle all over. When she reached out to push his chest, Lucius dug into her mouth deeper with his tongue. The passionate kiss made her vision blurry, and her whole body began to tremble. But, this tremor was most certainly not due to fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desperate kiss showed her just how much Lucius loved her. How long had it been since the last time that they kissed like this? Freya twisted her body as hard as she could. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll choke to death if he kisses me more.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But Lucius, drunk on her lips, didn’t budge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After gently playing with her mounds for a long time, he finally released his lips from hers and coughed, “Aren’t you supposed to breathe while kissing?” Looking at Freya, who was catching her breath, Lucius’s eyes became more and more fierce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he tried to kiss her again, she yelled out, “No! My legs hurt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since they’d been kissing while still standing up since they entered the room, her legs were sore, and her back, which had been rubbing against the door, was tingling. Perhaps Lucius had finally come to his senses as he pulled Freya up, straightening her back, and then managed to give her some space by backing away.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a relief! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freya’s breathing was so quick that the front of her dress looked like it may burst at any moment, and her voluptuous mounds were bulging over the top of it. She thought that it had ended, but Lucius suddenly lifted her off the ground. Freya, now helpless in his tight grasp, swung her legs like a child throwing a tantrum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carefully seating her on the bed, he wiped the shiny corners of his mouth with his sleeve, “We can continue now, right?”</span></p>
