            <p>“That’s very good, right?”</p>
<p>Freya talked in a cheerful tone on purpose. She meant it. A battle like this that kills so many people should end for sure.</p>
<p><em>Archer would go back to where he’s from once the war is over.</em></p>
<p>Lucius that she’s serving would go back to the palace.</p>
<p><em>That’s really good. I don’t have to see that strange man again.</em></p>
<p>But she also felt a little sad that she had to leave Lucius.</p>
<p><em>I guess I got closer to him than I thought.</em></p>
<p>Freya kept walking after finally getting Lucius off her mind.</p>
<p><em>How can I earn money?</em></p>
<p><em>And where should I go?</em></p>
<p>Freya was in deep thought while biting her lips as she has yet to earn enough. But she also had tons to do right now.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back.”</p>
<p>Freya wore the clothes that Lucius fit for her and went across the barracks. It was a big difference from the old clothes that she picked up.</p>
<p>“What is the use of such luxurious fabric when I’m only wearing it for work?”</p>
<p>And as Hero attended her wounds, they healed quickly.</p>
<p><em>It was such an embarrassing moment to confuse Hero as a servant.</em></p>
<p>Hero’s position was grander than she knew.</p>
<p>“A wizard….!”</p>
<p>Hero seemed even more handsome after knowing that. He was pretty popular with his luscious black hair and calming red eyes.</p>
<p>“He’s also kind too.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, her heartfelt burdened thinking of His Majesty’s cold personality.</p>
<p><em>Why am I like this?</em></p>
<p>Shouldn’t she feel happy now that she can get away from those annoying nagging? She was a temporary servant as it was hard to find people on the battlefield.</p>
<p><em>It was weird from the start. A girl servant…</em></p>
<p>She remembered his Majesty and Selena who were standing together after she took a few steps.</p>
<p>Two of them will get married soon, and Freya will live a life of her own.</p>
<p><em>That’s that, but that woman. If she tries something funny again I won’t leave her alone.</em></p>
<p>Hero attended to the burn on the back of the hand, but in the end, it still left a faint scar. Archer nagged her because of that.</p>
<p><em>A girl shouldn’t have a scar.</em></p>
<p>Archer wouldn’t know. The giant wound started from Freya’s forehead and went across her back and leg.</p>
<p>“Well, really doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>She already knew that she wouldn’t be able to live like a normal lady. To be raised by parents and marry someone next door, and have children like her parents and then age.</p>
<p><em>That sounds like as big of a bluff as a hundred gold.</em></p>
<p>But by the sound of getting a dress, Archer seemed to have that kind of dream.</p>
<p><em>I don’t mind Archer worrying about me.</em></p>
<p>It was just unfamiliar, but Archer’s nagging was warming.</p>
<p>It felt like he was her family.</p>
<p>As she walked in thought for a while, someone stopped her.</p>
<p>“Oh my, His Majesty’s servant.”</p>
<p>“…. Hello, Count Adelion.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you recognize me.”</p>
<p>It was Count Adelion she met in the middle of the street. He was wearing a shirt with puffy lace that seemed a little small for him, as his buttons look like they were going to burst. His greasy face had a smile on, but it felt a little too much.</p>
<p><em>Where have I seen this face before?</em></p>
<p>As Freya lowered her gaze, she remembered someone.</p>
<p><em>Shilo….</em></p>
<p>He had similar creepy eyes as the man who always examined her from top to bottom.</p>
<p>“I confused you as a boy before. I heard from Selena that you’re a pretty lady?”</p>
<p>His tone was kind, but his stare wasn’t. He kept staring at her chest and examining the legs that were more revealed rather than the dress.</p>
<p><em>It would’ve been better if you were still wrong.</em></p>
<p>Freya barely nodded her head as she felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“You haven’t reached the age yet? Hm?”</p>
<p>“No, I have passed the age.”</p>
<p>Count that is wondering about the age of a lowly servant. She wasn’t even curious about his intention.</p>
<p>As Freya acted like she had to leave, he acted like a good person.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you again.”</p>
<p>“Take care.”</p>
<p>As she was getting away from Count Adelion, her back felt so hot that it felt like it was burning.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As she arrived at the tent, there was something covered with a cloth on the table.</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>It made some strange noise.</p>
<p>As Freya carefully took the cloth off, there was a pretty big bird glaring at her. The bird with yellow eyes and black feathers seemed to have very sharp claws.</p>
<p><em>That’s weird. I feel like I’ve seen it before….</em></p>
<p>Freya felt like the bird seemed frustrated being caged.</p>
<p>As she opened the cage, the bird flapped its wings a few times, came out, and sat on the table.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>The bird shook its beak at Freya’s greeting. It was pretty calm, unlike the way it looked.</p>
<p>“What’s your name? Have we seen each other before?”</p>
<p>But no matter how much she tried to remember, she couldn’t remember seeing such a big and amazing-looking bird. Freya crushed the bread she had in her pocket on the table. The bird put its beak on it and then showed no interest.</p>
<p>“Ah, you eat meat.”</p>
<p>She was able to remember an old memory without much trouble.</p>
<p>There was a little bell-like voice that was heard beside her a long time ago.</p>
<p><em>Freya, that bird likes fruits. Some birds only like meat, and other birds at omnivores.</em></p>
<p><em>What’s an omnivore?</em></p>
<p><em>A bird that eats anything just like us.</em></p>
