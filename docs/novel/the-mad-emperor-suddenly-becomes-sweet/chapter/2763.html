            <p>Freya straightened to welcome the newcomers. Upon viewing Selena and Lucius standing side by side, Freya’s head bowed immediately. Selena raised her chin as she looked at the servant in front of her, “Please bring us some tea,” She commanded as she seated herself gracefully. Freya bustled to make tea, her eyes viewing Lucius from a corner as she watched him disappear into his bedroom. Freya felt the sharp watchful gaze of someone as she poured the tea leaves into the kettle.</p>
<p>The tea was ready in a little while, and she took it to the noble who sat on a chair haughtily. “So, you are his Highness’s servant,” She asked, her voice filled with displeasure. Freya raised an eyebrow as she looked at the woman as she served her tea. Selena stared at her with an expression that was dripping acid. She looked down at herself, wondering if her clothes were too meager for the noblewoman’s tastes.</p>
<p>Selena took a sip from the tea and curled her lips distastefully. “This tea is cold,” she spoke and raised it towards Freya expectantly. Freya felt a surge of annoyance, considering she’d just poured the liquid boiling hot from the kettle.</p>
<p>She walked forwards, her hand raised to take the cup from the woman. “I’ll remedy that, my lady,” she said. Just as her hand came close to Selena, the woman tilted her hand, pouring red hot liquid on Freya’s hand. She winced inwardly but she didn’t react, not bothering to clutch her burnt hand. “Well?” Selena asked, her voice singing with victory.</p>
<p>Freya felt like screaming but she knew it’d add to her opponent’s satisfaction. She looked at her hands and walked to a basin calmly, putting them in the cold water. The skin on the back of her hands threatened to peel off and Freya groaned slowly.</p>
<p>“It hurts,” she thought miserably. Despite being used to such treatment, she felt anger rising through her. She’d misunderstood the dainty beautiful Selena. At first glance, she’d seemed like an angel, but her ugly layers were showing underneath. Unlike Sophia and Shylo, Selena had the advantage of her beauty, hiding the ugliness in her heart. Her burnt fingers itched to pull the pretty hair off the noblewoman’s head. But she knew it wasn’t worth it, the only outcome would be punished for speaking back to a noble, so Freya buried her resentment.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>It was not an exaggeration to say that Selena Edelion was born with a silver spoon in her mouth, and was gifted with everything from birth. Being the eldest daughter of the richest family in the south, she had all eyes on her. From her family’s wealth to her beauty, she was quite popular among the noblemen- but Selena’s attention was always diverted to one person. She couldn’t forget the first day she’d seen Lucius Morsiani.</p>
<p>She was three years younger than the man himself. Her mind played back the moment she’d seen him, going to the palace holding her father’s hand firmly. His shiny blonde hair, red lips, and milky white skin were exactly what she’d dreamed of from the crown prince. She played the words, “Empress Morsiani,” in her mind repeatedly. She’d made it her life’s mission to get closer to him. So far, everything had been going smoothly.</p>
<p>Lucius barely had other interests besides war, scarcely attending social events- which Selena considered fortunate. She’d always reveled in hearing the rumors about him. She knew he wasn’t the monster everyone painted him as it was an advantage to her as it reduced the competition for her. It was only a matter of time before Lucius ascended the throne and then she’d be next to him. It was only after coming here that Selena had felt anxious for the first time. She could tell that the mousy little servant was more than that to the King. Lucius, the man who hated women, was close to this girl. It was something that’d been on her mind as soon as she’d watched the interaction between the two of them.</p>
<p>Coupled with that, the fact that this incessant bug was with him during the attack and spent a night with him had bothered Selena very much. She’d been sent away by Lucius’ lackeys, and she knew she’d have done a better job with the Crown Prince than the servant. She could never forgive her for her proximity to the Crown Prince. Pouring the tea on the servant’s hands was a way of showing her who was superior but the servant hadn’t shown any reaction and Selena felt even more annoyed.</p>
<p>“I’d like to rest now,” Lucius’ voice spoke from the back. Selena realized what he was asking of her and was angered at leaving the suspicious servant alone with her Prince. However, wanting to appear perfect in front of him, she bowed gracefully and left the tent.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, get well soon,” she muttered before leaving. Silence ensued between the two as Selena left and Freya realized it quickly as she hid her hands behind her back.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I trust you are well?” She asked formally, her eyes on the ground.</p>
<p>“I’m perfectly fine, why do you think I’m standing upright?”</p>
<p>Freya rolled her eyes away from the King’s gaze and regretted having been worried about him from her sickbed. He was as grumpy and rude as ever.</p>
<p>“I hear Count Adelion and his daughter saved me,” he said suddenly, his tone not believing the words which came out of his mouth. He leaned on the sofa, his eyes trained on Freya with questions. Freya hesitated, her mind rebelling. Should she tell him and get generous compensation from him? Was it necessary to talk about things in the order that happened?</p>
<p>She knew if she said yes she’d have to confess about the moment she’d shared with the King and the thought shook her. She knew she wasn’t good at lying and she would probably spill the contents of what happened that night and face the shame.</p>
<p>Freya bit her lower lip, her mind and heart debating. In the end, she shook a little as she answered, “Yes- yes they did,”</p>
<p>“I see, that was expected.”</p>
