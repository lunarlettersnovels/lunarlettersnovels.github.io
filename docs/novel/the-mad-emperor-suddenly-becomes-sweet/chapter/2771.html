            <p>“I realized that after coming here.”</p>
<p><em>What were they talking about?</em></p>
<p>Freya thought with building confusion. It was obvious she was involved in their conversation but she wasn’t aware how- and couldn’t figure out the tense and weird atmosphere between the two men. While she wondered, she felt Lucius’ rough hand on her arm.</p>
<p>Within a second, she was on his lap and she landed with an oomph as her back hit his strong hard legs. She panicked as she attempted to move and push herself off of him but his hands held her in a tight cage.</p>
<p>“Keep quiet and assist me, Freya.”</p>
<p>He whispered in her ear discreetly and Freya shivered involuntarily. This was unlike him, unlike his cold demeaning behavior. <em>His Majesty himself was asking for her assistance?</em> Freya could’ve imagined the effort it took for him to ask for her help, especially.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she became more aware of her surroundings and realized the guests were staring at her. Her face burned with shame and she covered it with her palm, hoping to hide.</p>
<p>Count Adelion couldn’t hide bewilderment as his face reddened.</p>
<p>“Oh my God!”</p>
<p>He could not do this to him, especially after he and his precious Selena had come a long way to meet him. His doubt was certain on his face as he tried to form a sentence but struggled, squinting and mumbling.</p>
<p><em>Your Majesty Lucius, what are you trying to do?</em></p>
<p>He thought to himself as he clenched his hands under the table.</p>
<p>The Count immediately changed his demeanor and bowed politely. His Majesty was acting strangely but that didn’t mean he was going to change his mind.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I’ll see you again at dinner.”</p>
<p>Count Adelion excused himself and took his surprised daughter, leaving the tent quickly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Freya felt like a ridiculous puppy sitting on the Prince’s lap while he waited for the Count and his companions to leave. Lucius pet her gently and smiled at her with a tenderness that was unusual to Freya. She knew he was putting on an act and it made her sick to her stomach realizing he could fake his feelings to such an extent.</p>
<p><em>What was wrong with him? Did the bread he ate have something bad in it?</em></p>
<p>Unless he was insane, it was hard to understand his actions. The moment the Count disappeared, Lucius pushed her to her waist immediately- leaving Freya cold and dejected.</p>
<p><em>Weren’t you just asking for my help? You could be a little less rude</em>. She thought irately as she rolled her eyes behind his back.</p>
<p>He headed to the tent without a word, his long strides hard to compete with. He stood waiting in his tent for Freya, a bored expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Freya, I’m tired.” He commented non-committal as he stood and watched her expectantly.</p>
<p>Freya raised her eyebrows irritatedly, as she grumbled and reached to take off his clothes. Her mind was still on the moment they’d shared in the tent, her emotions ranging from angry to confused. She cursed under her breath while she pulled at the fabric roughly. How could he be so indifferent? Did he not care about how she felt because of his crass actions?</p>
<p>But then she remembered; of course, she was just a servant, and Lucius was… well him.</p>
<p>As she undid his collar, she imagined choking him with the golden rope.</p>
<p>“Can’t you do it faster?” He grumbled.</p>
<p>“Hah!” Freya exclaimed to herself angrily. Of course, instead of apologizing, he’d closed his eyes and ordered her to do it faster. But she held herself back. She couldn’t risk angering him and getting herself rid of this position. She needed this to progress.</p>
<p>She wanted to hurt him so badly, but she had to hold it in. She undid the sash above the shirt and the ribbon that was tightened around his neck. Why was he even tired? He was dressed, fed, and taken care of by others. Even now, <em>she</em> was undressing him!</p>
<p>But she had to know of his motives.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty…” She spoke quietly, convinced she’d made a bad choice as soon as her mouth opened.</p>
<p>“What is it?” He demanded. Lucius opened his eyes from his pseudo slumber and stared at her deeply with his intense blue eyes.</p>
<p>“I- Why did you do.. that in the tent..before?” She stammered pathetically under his scrutinizing gaze.</p>
<p>She was right to question him but it seemed that with every second he stared at her, she felt smaller and unimportant.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Lucius’ tired eyes blinked at her clearly. It felt like he couldn’t understand why she’d asked the question, that it was weird.</p>
<p>“You- grabbed me, and sat me on your thigh” she gulped as she remembered the feel of his thighs on her back.</p>
<p>“Why? Did that bother you?” he asked nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Lucius looked like he couldn’t understand, and Freya quickly answered.</p>
<p>“No! I..”</p>
<p>She would look foolish if she let him think she was affected by him.</p>
<p>As she answered, Lucius’s eyes became narrow and the tip of his lips went up.</p>
<p>“Then there is no reason to mention it.” He lifted an eyebrow lazily.</p>
<p>“I mentioned it because Selena was looking,” she hissed back.</p>
<p>“Hm? Who’s that?”</p>
<p>Freya perked her head up as she was undoing the belt around his waist.</p>
<p>How could he forget her? Selena was the most beautiful woman alive! Did he not care at all?</p>
<p>After looking at Freya’s questioning eyes, Lucius let out a weary sigh.</p>
<p>“I assume you meant Count Adelion’s daughter?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t Selena your fiancée?”</p>
<p>“Who said that?” he barked out suddenly, his lethargic demeanor quickly converted to a cold and demonic one. He glared at Freya’s neck as he would wring it. Freya touched her neck consciously, wondering if this was how it felt like being hunted by a beast.</p>
<p>“Did Count Adelion tell you to say that?” He spat out distastefully, his voice rising.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Freya trembled as she looked at the man in front of her.</p>
<p>He looked at her ominously, and she kept inching back on her footstool, almost at its edge.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, what is going on?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Herro and Gemini entered the tent and she lost her balance, her attention diverted.</p>
<p>The foothold Freya was standing on flipped and there was a loud sound. Her body flew up for a moment, and she clenched her eyes out of fear. She was going to break a bone.</p>
<p>With closed eyes, she reached out and patted for a wound but realized she didn’t hurt.</p>
<p>It didn’t hurt?</p>
<p>She opened her eyes slowly, her gaze flitting to the frozen faces of Herro and Gemini at the entrance of the tent. She looked up and saw Lucius’ shining eye.</p>
<p>For some reason… she was in his protective arms, and he was holding her close to him.</p>
