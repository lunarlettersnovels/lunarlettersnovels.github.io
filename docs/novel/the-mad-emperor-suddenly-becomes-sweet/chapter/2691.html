            <p>“Freya, I just need you to be there for me,” Hero said.</p>
<p>“I apologize for burdening you like this,” Freya replied, her regret clear in her tone.</p>
<p>“Are we not friends?” Despite her remorse, Hero couldn’t help but smile at Freya’s words.</p>
<p>“I truly appreciate it,” he said. “I haven’t thanked you in a while.”</p>
<p>Hero had never kept secrets from Lucius, but he couldn’t stand idly by as events unfolded. His only concern was ensuring a smooth succession to the throne for Lucius. It would be better for Freya as well. It’s just a process, nothing more. Keeping his emotions in check, Hero smiled at Freya as he looked down at his attire.</p>
<p>“I may not be a wizard today, but I look like a wealthy young master, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“It’s not the same thing,” Freya corrected.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” Hero said, his anxiety easing slightly as they made small talk. He knocked on the door of a narrow, muddy alleyway, his horse pushing aside a wooden plank blocking a small hole. Though he tried to appear calm, the tension was evident on Hero’s face, something that was unusual for him.</p>
<p>“What’s the problem? I’m just going to grab a drink,” Hero said.</p>
<p>A set of yellow eyes studied Hero’s diamonds and clothing before the door opened. The man looked like a hero, dressed in costume. The operation was now in progress.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming, sir,” the large man said as Hero approached.</p>
<p>“What’s the most expensive drink on the menu?” Hero asked.</p>
<p>The man stood up and said, “Hold on a moment.”</p>
<p>The inside was even worse than Freya remembered. The walls were stained with the odors of alcohol, perfume, and cigarettes. A mouse scurried across the floor, and a woman with too much flesh exposed sat smoking nearby.</p>
<p>“If you keep looking around like that, Freya, you’ll draw attention,” Hero warned.</p>
<p>Freya, who had been startled by Hero’s comment, sat back down. But the stress of rescuing Lottie had made her hands sweat.</p>
<p>“Please, bring me a drink,” Freya said.</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” the owner said, taking some gold coins from the table.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a lot to offer here. The best in the alley, of course. And we’ve got some talented kids who sing and dance.”</p>
<p>The man swept the gold coins into his pocket with a towel and asked the woman sitting nearby for something. Soon, a woman in a feather-decorated gown danced and sang in front of Hero and Freya. Freya recognized a familiar face among the performers, whose original faces were obscured by makeup. Lottie, dressed in a green gown with her ankles and neck exposed, moved her body without expression.</p>
<p>“Lottie…” Freya said and practically ran out to embrace her as soon as their eyes met. Hero, holding his glass, pulled Freya’s sleeve as her body trembled.</p>
<p>“Green…”</p>
<p>“Master, the performance is over. May you introduce me to your friend now? It’s no fun drinking alone. Everyone here is drinking together.”</p>
<p>As the owner held out his hand for more money, Hero placed a gold coin on the table.</p>
<p>“Who are you looking for?” the owner asked Hero.</p>
<p>“The actress in the green gown,” Hero replied.</p>
<p>“Lottie, Lottie, Lottie!” the owner shouted.</p>
<p>“You stay and everyone else goes out.” Lottie approached the table, sat down, and took a drink.</p>
<p>Freya covered her lips with her hand as she saw the familiar face. Both of them had changed so much in less than a year.</p>
<p>“I need you to be quiet,” Hero said, his words fading quickly as Freya could only communicate with Lottie in silence.</p>
<p>“Lottie, Lottie,” Freya said.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“That is Lottie,” Freya said, her voice barely audible but with a hint of glitter in Lottie’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Please, you’re not allowed to enter,” Lottie said, her voice trembling with fear.</p>
<p>“Oh, Freya, let’s get her out of here first. I’ll take care of this place,” Hero said, as Freya began to move out of the corridor with Lottie’s assistance.</p>
<p>“I despise fire the most,” Hero said, as he rolled up his sleeves and chanted something. The table he was sitting on soon began to burn.</p>
<p>“Fire!” someone shouted, creating a commotion inside. It didn’t seem strange for Freya and Lottie to leave, with people running to grab water and evacuate outside.</p>
<p>“Freya, I’m glad you’re here,” Lottie said, tears streaming down her face. “I didn’t expect you to come back in such a dangerous situation.”</p>
<p>Freya hugged Lottie tightly, trying to calm her down. “We have to get you out of here, Lottie. Archer, a large man who helped me, will take you to a safe place.”</p>
<p>Lottie looked at Freya with confusion. “Who is Archer?”</p>
<p>“He’s a trustworthy person, you can rely on him,” Freya reassured her. “But first, let’s focus on your health. You don’t look well.”</p>
<p>Lottie’s face was pale and gaunt, with dark circles under her eyes. Her hands were shaking, and she couldn’t stop crying. Freya couldn’t understand why Lottie always ended up in these situations.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s go,” Freya said, helping Lottie to her feet. They made their way to a kitchen with a back entrance.</p>
<p>But as they were about to leave, they were met by a rough-looking man blocking their path. “Who are you, and why are you trying to kidnap my child?” he growled.</p>
<p>Freya pushed Lottie behind her and pulled out a dagger she had prepared. “We’re not kidnapping anyone. We’re just trying to get her to safety.”</p>
<p>The man eyed the dagger warily but didn’t move. “Prove it,” he said.</p>
<p>Freya explained the situation to him and showed him Lottie’s condition. He reluctantly let them pass, and Freya and Lottie were able to escape the dangerous situation.</p>
