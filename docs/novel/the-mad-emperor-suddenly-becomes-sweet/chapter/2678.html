            <p>“I’m glad to hear that,” Lucius whispered quietly as he watched Freya go out to scoop water. He felt grateful that she had been by his side throughout his ordeal. Even if he tried so hard, he couldn’t be happier with the way things had turned out.</p>
<p>After examining all of Lucius’s wounds and putting a wet towel on his forehead, the night became increasingly dark.</p>
<p>“I’m at my limit now,” Lucius groaned as he tried to overcome his pain. All the tension in his body relaxed, and his legs shook from the strain of his injuries. As he fell into a deep pit, his injured body roared with pain.</p>
<p>“I’m starting to get drunk now,” Freya remarked. She normally feels hot as soon as she drinks, but today she feels dizzy instead. When she checked Lucius’s forehead with her hand, she could not feel the same feverish energy as before.</p>
<p>“I’m going to take a break for a while,” Freya said as she threw the towel aside and laid down next to Lucius. She stretched her legs without taking off her clothes or using a blanket, feeling too sick to do so. However, the place was not as fancy as the palace bedroom, so it gave off a comfortable feeling.</p>
<p>“Ha,” she sighed when she lay down. Her last work and today’s events began to get tangled up in her mind. Her heart pounded with the feeling of alcohol, and she was bothered by the man lying next to her.</p>
<p>“Oh my God, it’s a dream,” she whispered to herself, thinking of the memory of when she had clung to Lucius’s naked body and kissed him. The moist texture of his lips was vivid in her mind, and she shook her head quickly to erase the memory.</p>
<p>“I’m tired, so let’s get some sleep,” Freya said, trying to focus on the present. She needed to rest or risk staying up all night. She relaxed her body, turned her head upward, and closed her eyes tightly, inhaling the subtle scent of the trees mixed with the smell of alcohol.</p>
<p>“When I open my eyes, I have to go straight back and get ready to leave because the term stipulated in the contract is almost over,” she thought to herself as she drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she didn’t have much to pack. She had no intention of taking any of the dresses or items that she used to pretend to be Miss De Bua. Besides, the money she earned from working was quite considerable.</p>
<p>“They say land prices are cheap near the outskirts.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps I should go further north. If it’s there, no one would know her, and she could live the rest of her life in peace,” she thought.</p>
<p>There was a sound of groaning again, but Freya did not open her closed eyes. She had done enough today, and it was no longer her job.</p>
<p>“Pssst, Freya.”</p>
<p>After turning slightly to the side, she opened her eyes and saw Lucius looking for her, waving his arms up.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you thirsty?”</p>
<p>“Chu, it’s cold.”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, there was not enough firewood to heat the entire building with a small stove. Her head was dizzy, so she held her forehead with one hand, dragged the blanket a little more, and pulled it up to Lucius’ neck. Still, he murmured that it was cold all the time.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to…”</p>
<p>She was hot under the influence of alcohol, and she didn’t want to cover herself with him. However, she couldn’t pretend to see him shaking, so she went into the blanket lightly. When Freya covered herself with the blanket, he quickly clung to her body.</p>
<p>“It’s warm.”</p>
<p>His large hand stammered, and before he knew it, he had wrapped himself strongly around Freya’s waist. Soon after, she was in Lucius’ arms, and she wriggled. She was afraid of the familiar feeling of his arms, which gave him a hard but cozy feeling.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I’ll miss you later.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s too late.”</p>
<p>She hadn’t forgotten any of the days she spent with Ruth.</p>
<p>“Freya, Freya.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>When Lucius woke up, he kept calling her. When she didn’t keep answering, he hugged her body more intensely and breathed hot breath into her neck. It felt strange to stay still, so she reached out and pushed his chin away.</p>
<p>“Are you awake, Freya?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m sleeping, so please don’t talk to me and let me sleep.”</p>
<p>She needed to rest well while she was sick, but she couldn’t help but wonder why she had woken up.</p>
<p>When she closed her mouth with her shoulders down, he asked again.</p>
<p>“Do you remember when we played house?”</p>
<p>Why was he bringing up that old game now, of all times?</p>
<p>Lying down, she opened her eyes, and Lucius continued.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t I the father, and you were the mother?”</p>
<p>It was actually the other way around, but she never intended to correct him.</p>
