<div class="sc-gKclnd cDdKdQ">Freya pointed out her awkwardness throughout to Pierre who teaches her dance.</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="sc-1sp3zau-0 jaefFT sc-1di2uql-0 tiegV" data-tag="post-content">
<p>“Miss de Bua, straighten your back and turns your  body gracefully and naturally.”</p>
<p>At the same time as her class started, Freya, who had already stepped on his foot a dozen times, gave a look of embarrassment.</p>
<p><em>Is it possible to turn around gracefully with your back straight?</em></p>
<p>A tired look was evident on her crying face. However, the over-passionate Pierre never rested.</p>
<p>“Come on again! One, two, three!”</p>
<p>She thought practice with Michael made her a little better, but she was mistaken. After taking a deep breath, Pierre opened his mouth very carefully.</p>
<p>“I know these words are disrespectful, but I think Miss Bua seems to be born with a lack of flexibility.”</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>At this point Freya wanted her teacher to give up on her. She sighed more often than she had heard these days, and her face was red from anger. She held her breath when Pierre, clenching her fists, opened her mouth again.</p>
<p><em>Please give up on me!</em></p>
<p>But she overlooked Pierre’s responsibility as much as his passion. He gave a serious look to Freya as he swept away the flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>“If you are not born with it, you have no choice but to overcome it with effort.”</p>
<p>“Sir, you look tired already. That’s enough for today.”</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as giving up in my dictionary. Just trust and follow me.”</p>
<p>Pierre took her hand again and started walking through the long room. He did not stop his dancing even after Freya stepped on his foot several times. Because of her higher-heeled shoes, she slowly began to feel the heat and slight pain in her ankles. At least her toes will be blistered.</p>
<p>“Sir, I’m out of breath.”</p>
<p>“Forget me in pain and let the flow of your body let Miss De Bua go. There will come a moment when you will forget that you are thirsty and that you are short of breath.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>Freya gasping for her breath, looked at Pierre with curious eyes, drunk on her strange words. Freya continued to practice without her rest, and her leg twisted in her turn, and she fell to Pierre.</p>
<p>“Uh, uh… !”</p>
<p>The two fell to the floor with a loud noise. When she opened her eyes, she was on top of Pierre.</p>
<p>“Sir, are you okay?”</p>
<p>Astonished, she stood up, and Pierre moaned.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m too heavy.”</p>
<p>Freya quickly reached out her arm to Pierre and tried to lift him up, when she heard the sound of her sword scraping the floor.</p>
<p>“… … ?”</p>
<p>Lucius, wearing tight white pants and a black shirt with rich sleeves, was hanging a sword under his feet. Pierre trembled at the sight of his majesty, which made him cringe and gave him courtesy.</p>
<p>“I see you, your Highness Lucius.”</p>
<p>“Is it some kind of class to roll around with my fiancee?”</p>
<p>Pierre claimed innocence by shaking his neck. He was terrified that Lucius’ sword might pierce his chest at any moment. Lucius, who bent his head sideways, spoke still.</p>
<p>“We’d better call it a day.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I will. Thank you for your hard work;” Pierre turned his gaze to Freya.</p>
<p>“Get out.”</p>
<p>As he limped, Pierre hurried out of the classroom. And the practice room soon became silent.</p>
