            <p>After Freya was groomed by the maids she stares at the mirror.</p>
<p>“Wow! Who is this?”</p>
<p>The disheveled hair and dirty face were nowhere to be found, and a neat noble lady was reflected in the mirror. Freya laughed awkwardly, scattering her hair for no reason.</p>
<p>“You look less awkward in a dress these days.”</p>
<p>Now Freya looked quite like the girl she envied on the street 10 years ago. As she walked slightly along with the waist-length cloak, She could see a  rich lace at the end of the hem. It was unthinkable when she was begging for money in the street with her rags and worn clothes.</p>
<p>Should she thank Lucius for all of these? If it wasn’t for him, she would never know that the water in the silver basin was not for drinking but for washing his Majesty’s hands.</p>
<p>She sighed as she sat at her desk organizing the books to learn today before preparing for class.</p>
<p>“I wish Lottie could read.”</p>
<p>If so, Freya could have delivered the general news by letter. Perhaps Lottie’s eyes will pop out when he sees her now.</p>
<p>“Is he doing well?”</p>
<p>The thought of Lottie made Freya depressed.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to do this. There are only seven months left and I’m out here in the palace.”</p>
<p>Freya endured sixteen years in such a dark den, and there was no way she couldn’t stand in seven months. Freya’s whole body seemed to be full of energy when she made a determination that cheered her up.</p>
<p>“Assy, please take care of me today.”</p>
<p>Freya named her horse Assy. Though a handsome horse with a friendly name, Freya’s riding skills were boring. The man guiding her walked slowly, holding the reins with a firm expression.</p>
<p>“If you’re so scared, the horse feels it all.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Freya sat on the horse’s back with a stiff expression and managed to straighten her back.</p>
<p><em>But I don’t want to ride.</em></p>
<p>Freya was a little scared of horses since she was young. Every time she sat on the street begging, she know how big the horses of the wagon passing by.</p>
<p><em>If it kicks me, I might die.</em></p>
<p>It was when Freya took her three or four-year-old friend to work instead of Lottie.</p>
<p>They can get a lot of money if they always look cold and hungry.</p>
<p>As Sofia said, the money saved by begging should be transferred into the pocket. Freya could earn more pennies by sticking out an empty bowl.</p>
<p><em>Don’t move. Because I have to clean up the money.</em></p>
<p>Freya just looked away for a moment, and in the meantime, the little child who walked out was standing on the way to the carriage.</p>
<p><em>No!</em></p>
<p>Freya, who had lost her mind, threw herself. She didn’t even worry about dying together.</p>
<p>(Screaming)</p>
<p>The child’s screams rang out everywhere, and when they came to their senses, the two were safe. Thanks to Freya’s tight hug with her friend while rolling around the floor, the child was nowhere injured except scratched.</p>
<p><em>Well, my leg was stepped on by a horse.</em></p>
<p>Freya felt her ankle was sore again from the memory of being squishy for a while.</p>
<p>At that time, the ankle with the ligament stretched hurt for a long time.</p>
<p><em>I tried my best not to get caught by Sophia.</em></p>
<p>A sick child in an orphanage was the most useless and easily neglected.</p>
<p><em>I hate horses and horseback riding.</em></p>
<p>But now she couldn’t make that excuse.</p>
<p>“You’re Miss de Bua!” she said slowly.</p>
<p>She held the reins for a long time and sweated, but a group of knights was passing by after training. Archer, who had identified Freya, ran toward her with a welcoming face hidden.</p>
<p>“Oh! You must be riding.”</p>
<p>Freya’s cheeks flushed up when she saw Archer’s grinning face. It was obvious that she would be teased for at least a few months to show him this ugly appearance.</p>
<p>“This is the end of the class.”</p>
<p>A few rounds of practice finally ended, and she came down from her horse holding Archer’s hand.</p>
<p>“Do you have some time now?”</p>
<p>Archer was making a very small noise in case anyone heard him. Freya snapped at Archer, who secretly teased her for her sophisticated attire and riding.</p>
<p>“If you have time, well.”</p>
<p>“How do you like chicken legs? Huh? Looks like you’re having a hard time being a lady.”</p>
<p>Freya couldn’t express it much because she was afraid someone else would see it, but Freya’s face turned bright.</p>
<p><em>This boring lady can’t wait to cut off the leg of a chicken.</em></p>
<p>Freya’s heart was pounding thinking about it, but Freya shook her head pretending to be elegant.</p>
<p>“I need an escort, please. Archer.”</p>
<p>“It’s an honor, Miss.”</p>
<p>Archer, with his chest out wide, took the lead, followed by Freya very slowly. The place where Archer took her was a very small house, with wooden tables and chairs in a narrow yard to be called a garden.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>As Freya sat there, the lilac tree standing behind her back created a large shadow. A sweet smell reached the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>“There was a place like this in the palace.”</p>
<p>It was a great home, considering the narrow barracks.</p>
<p>Enjoying the beautiful scenery for a while, Freya rode the horse nervously. Her butt was tingling and her body ached. She just thought that playing the role of a noble lady would be a business that she would lose even if she gave 100 gold pieces.</p>
