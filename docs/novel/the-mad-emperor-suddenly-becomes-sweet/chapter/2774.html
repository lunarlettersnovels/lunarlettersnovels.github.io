            <p>“It’s an honour.”</p>
<p>She was responding to most of Lucius’s words with this. At first, she felt a little sick, but now that she got used to it, she wasn’t thinking much about it.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, if you don’t need me anymore then I’ll dismiss-.”</p>
<p>Lucius, quick-witted, was very displeased that she was dealing with him with no effort. That wasn’t all. The weird emotion that he felt earlier in the day wasn’t going away. As he saw the red skin on Freya’s body, he felt displeased. Lucius hated when someone touched anything that was his. He spoke to Freya who was still looking for a chance to get out of here.</p>
<p>“There’s something left for you to do.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>Freya’s face showed disappointment that she couldn’t hide. Lucius faintly smiled at her distorted face.</p>
<p>That moment, the tent opened and many servants appeared. Soon a dinner table that had so much food that its legs might break was prepared.</p>
<p>“What is happening?”</p>
<p>Today was the first time she saw so much food prepared on this table. Lucius usually ate little so he only ate one meal, two at most.</p>
<p>As all the preparation were finished, the servants left. The tent was full of the sweet smell of bread and the smell of pork roasting on the fire.</p>
<p><em>Oh my god! Feels like my stomach is turning.</em></p>
<p>Freya, who was just swallowing saliva while staring at the table, looked away. No matter how delicious the food was, she didn’t want to eat with Lucius.</p>
<p><em>Not like he’d call a lowly person like me anyway.</em></p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I’ll be off then.”</p>
<p>“Sit over there.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who already sat at the middle of the table while holding a wine glass, ordered her.</p>
<p>“How could I sit at the same table as you-.”</p>
<p>Freya was sweating as she didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Then Lucius put down his glass, frowned and spoke.</p>
<p>“If anyone heard, it would sound like I invited you. If you don’t attend, then how would I eat meat like that?”</p>
<p>Lucius’ face looked very serious and Freya for a moment thought it was logical. But the meat was already cut and so was the bread. All he had to do was to use the tongs to put it on his plate.</p>
<p><em>He can’t do that so he’s going to use me?</em></p>
<p>“Hurry….”</p>
<p>The chair was also beside Lucius so Freya went near him with an uncomfortable expression.</p>
<p>“Cut the meat very small.”</p>
<p>“Ok.”</p>
<p>As Freya cut the meat like she was crushing it, Lucius ordered her to taste it.</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>Freya was wondering what’s gotten into Lucius who always bullied her and asked back loudly.</p>
<p>Lucius, who was swerving his glass, talked lazily.</p>
<p>“There are so many people that want to kill me.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t be someone who’d just be kind to her.</p>
<p><em>He doesn’t know if this will kill me, but it’ll save him.</em></p>
<p>Freya looked up and remembered what Archer told her.</p>
<p><em>The ghost of a well-fed person looks better.</em></p>
<p>Freya frowned a little and put the meat into her mouth.</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>She was chewing the meat carefully and let out a huge exclamation.</p>
<p>“Why do you feel poison or something?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. It’s just that it was very delicious.”</p>
<p>It was something she’s never tasted before.</p>
<p><em>The meat I had before doesn’t count as meat.</em></p>
<p>Normally the meat she ate was tough and had a weird smell so she had to bite roughly into it. But this meat, its skin was crunchy and its inside was so soft that it melted the moment she put it in her mouth. Freya quickly put the other meat on the plate and gave it to him.</p>
<p>“It should be ok for you to eat.”</p>
<p>Lucius ate the meat in a very small portion, and Freya started to test all the food on the table. Honestly, she could tell the poison by just poking the food with a fork, but she was willing to do the work properly. But as she tasted more and more, she felt thirsty.</p>
<p><em>I want more.</em></p>
<p>She kept eating food, but for some reason, she felt more hungry.</p>
<p><em>Why is he only looking at the food and not eating it?</em></p>
<p>Freya frowned as she saw that Lucius was barely eating the food she handed to him. Freya met his eyes as she was about to take a little portion of other food and taste it.</p>
<p>“….Yikes!”</p>
<p>“What’s that expression?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I was just wondering why you weren’t eating.”</p>
<p>Freya wiped the saliva off her mouth and pretended as nothing happened.</p>
<p>“I thought I was hungry, but that wasn’t the case. You can do whatever you want with the leftovers.”</p>
<p>“…. Pardon?”</p>
<p>Freya’s voice was so loud that the shadow of the soldier that was guarding the tent flinched. She was flabbergasted at the luck she was having as it wasn’t even her birthday.</p>
<p>“But how can I eat these?”</p>
<p>“Then you should throw it all away.”</p>
<p>“No, no.”</p>
<p>Freya waved her hands at his words.</p>
<p>In this tent, his words are the law.</p>
<p><em>It’s not because I’m tempted by the food or anything. I’m his servant and following the Crown Prince’s order.</em></p>
<p>Also, throwing away food is committing a horrible sin. She opened her mouth with a very serious face.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll take your order.”</p>
<p>Freya put a big piece of pork on her plate.</p>
<p><em>How greedy. She’s attacking the expensive meat first.</em></p>
<p>Lucius smiled while sipping on wine. He had trouble digesting as he was sensitive so he skipped dinner most of the time.</p>
<p>“But why did I have them prepared such a meal today?”</p>
<p>Lucius secretly asked Freya, who wasn’t even looking up from her plate.</p>
<p><em>Yes, this is bait.</em></p>
<p>It was so that he could hold Freya, who always wanted to leave at night.</p>
