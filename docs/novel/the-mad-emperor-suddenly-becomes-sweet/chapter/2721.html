<p><em>Did she say Pierre?</em></p>
<p>Art and poetry classes were bearable because he was a middle-aged man, but Lucius was concerned that Pierre, quite handsome and sophisticated, was holding her hand or waist. while dancing. But what annoys him the most?</p>
<p><em>I don’t deserve to be this angry.</em></p>
<p>Realizing that, Lucius took his sword and calmly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“I guess I’ll have to find someone else.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Freya’s face, still sitting on the floor, turned white.</p>
<p>“My dancing skills were bad. That’s why I’m embarrassed too. But the teacher worked really hard because of my incompetence.”</p>
<p>“There’s no way his better than me, right?”</p>
<p>“What?” Freya’s eyes widened as if they were about to pop out. Of course, she did not doubt his abilities as the Crown Prince.</p>
<p><em>I don’t want to learn from you.</em></p>
<p>Learning to dance from him, who constantly nagging, may shorten her lifespan.</p>
<p>Besides, they have to make contact. She tried to imagine him holding her hand and making eye contact with him.</p>
<p><em>Really? Are we in danger?</em></p>
<p>Love was important, but she didn’t want to give up everything she had. She didn’t lose interest in Lucius, but Freya decided to give him up.</p>
<p><em>He doesn’t even look after me.</em></p>
<p>That’s how Selena’s unrequited love came to an end. She decided to become Hart’s fiancée, abandoning her long-standing greed. That didn’t mean she couldn’t have enjoyed having tea with the one who had ruined her virtuous love.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>The Empress, who was touching her temple, called her maidservant and stood up. “I need some rest, so the two of you can take a walk in the garden. How nice it is to be friends.”</p>
<p>Freya had no intention of going for a walk with Selena, of course. But she decided to pretend she did because the Empress’s maids stood guarding them two by two. In the garden connected to the terrace, various roses were giving off a strong scent.</p>
<p><em>It’s pretty.</em></p>
<p>Compared to the desolate landscape of the orphanage’s backyard, this place was almost unrealistic. Freya undefined as she looked around, Selena, who was picking roses, muttered sharply.</p>
<p>“If I had known this would be the case, I would have scolded you even more.”</p>
<p>“…..?”</p>
<p>Could it be that pouring hot water on the back of a person’s hand wasn’t enough? Freya was so stunned that she forgot what to say for a moment. Selena raised her voice even more at her silence.</p>
<p>“Isn’t there anything that can be seen with the presence of His Highness Lucius now? But do you think you can become like me, the forbidden jade leaf of the Edelion family?”</p>
<p>Selena couldn’t stand it because she was upset that Lucius had been taken away by that girl who suddenly rolled in. Her venomous eyes glared at her, Freya only shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Are you ignoring me now? Stand there right now!”</p>
<p>Selena grabbed Freya’s shoulder as she was about to leave her seat first. She held her so tightly that her dress was wrinkled, and her skin burned under it. Freya took a deep breath in her.</p>
<p>“Are you avoiding me because you’re afraid?”</p>
<p>It was just that she didn’t want to deal with it, but Freya had no intention of ignoring it.</p>
<p><em>But Selena’s running rampant on her own.</em></p>
<p>When she still didn’t answer, Selena called out to her hysteria.</p>
<p>“Do you think that trampling on someone else’s love will make you happy?”</p>
<p>Freya was a little scared to see her screaming like a demon in her sober mind.</p>
<p><em>I didn’t know she was like this, I thought she was an angel.</em></p>
<p>Her outward appearance was only a part of that person. Freya, who was about to pass by, changed her mind. If she goes back like this, she’s a person who doesn’t know what she’s going to do next.</p>
<p>“You have to speak right away.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean!”</p>
<p>“Your unrequited love is over.”</p>
<p>Never, did she not put up a fight between the two of them dead and dying, or when she got engaged.</p>
<p>“What does this mean now!”</p>
<p>Her graceful mask was removed in an instant. She ripped open a rose vine. Selena, who was arrogant, was caught near Freya.</p>
<p>“I should have poured the hot water on your brazen face, not your hands!” Selena, who was embarrassed grabbed the prickly rose stem and rushed at her recklessly. If Freya was asked to fight, she would probably win, but she was at a loss as to what to do.</p>
<p><em>Can I hit Selena, the real aristocrat?</em></p>
<p>As she hesitated, a thorn vine wielded by Selena brushed her cheek. In an instant, an unpleasant lukewarm liquid ran down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Freya wrapped her cheeks in her hands and kicked Selena straight away. Selena, wearing several layers of dresses, was tossed around in her sudden attack. Her stomach was relieved, but her head throbbed at the thought of what was behind her. Freya was very angry.</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this to me?”</p>
<p>“You’re disgusting!”</p>
<p>Selena gushed with anger. However, it was difficult to argue more because of the scar on Freya’s cheek.</p>
<p>“I won’t let you go!”</p>
<p>Selena struggled to get up and hurriedly left the garden.</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m so tired.”</p>
<p>The scratch on her cheek stung badly.</p>
<p>“I have to go back.”</p>
<p>Just as Freya was about to turn her body, one of her hands came out of her bush and grabbed her. As she tried to scream, her large hand covered her lips all the way.</p>
<p>“… ..!”</p>
<p>It was a dark bush, but Freya quickly recognized the main character of this bosom.</p>
<p>“You scared me, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Shh…”</p>
<p>After completing his work, Lucius went to visit Freya. He was told that she had gone to see her Empress and Selena. His anxiety was so overwhelming that he couldn’t sit still and wait. So he sneaked into the garden, where he watched Freya. Lucius chanted in a low tone, pretending to be as calm as possible.</p>
