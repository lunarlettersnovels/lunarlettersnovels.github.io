            <p>“Have I ever said this before?” “We have a lot in common!” Michael yelled. “……?”</p>
<p>Freya was confused by Michael’s sudden outburst.</p>
<p>“I am, in fact, the son of a wizard family,” Michael explained, his face strange because it was the first time he had told a story like this. It was against the rules for him to become a wizard in the imperial family.</p>
<p>The empress, on the other hand, gave him her full support and assisted him in becoming Hart’s wizard, but no one else noticed.</p>
<p>“My mother died, and my family abandoned me,” Michael continued, his voice filled with loneliness.</p>
<p>It reminded Freya of herself. A gypsy woman was said to have raised young Michael.</p>
<p>“She was the one who reminded me, like an orphan, that I had an amazing talent.”</p>
<p>She nodded slowly in response to Michael’s words. She, like him, had nothing and was abandoned by everyone, as Michael pointed out.</p>
<p>“That’s probably why I liked you from the start. Del Mundo doesn’t really recognize local aristocrats here.” Michael’s words reminded her of a swarm of eyes staring at her as if they were on the lookout for a rare beast. He continued, his gaze drawn to Freya’s dark energy.</p>
<p>“This is what I’m saying for you, but it’s best to get away from the crown prince as soon as possible. He’s a very cunning man who will harm you.”</p>
<p>“……but.” Freya was hesitant to accept Michael’s warning.</p>
<p>Lucius had indeed hurt her by deceiving her. He certainly used Freya, but the phrase “hurt” was difficult to accept.</p>
<p>“You have no idea how much blood he had on his hands in order to keep his crown.”</p>
<p>According to Michael, the prince killed dozens or hundreds of soldiers during his insane days. Many of our soldiers are dying in the field on the outskirts of Lucius’ sword.</p>
<p>“There are days when he disappears and returns alone.”</p>
<p>He also claimed to have attempted to humiliate Her Majesty. Her Majesty, who was surprised that day, dropped a candle and set fire to the bedroom. She’d heard about the accident from Lucius. However, someone attempted to murder him.</p>
<p>“Why would he have been out of the palace for so long if he hadn’t committed a crime?”</p>
<p>“His life is at stake.” Freya defended Lucius.</p>
<p>“No way. Hero, the great wizard, and Gemini, who rose to prominence as adults, stood by the crown prince. ”</p>
<p>It was a bizarre story, but it was difficult to close the ears that had led to it.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>Her head had been throbbing for days, but she couldn’t wait any longer.</p>
<p><em> I need to get Lottie out of here as soon as possible</em>. She struggled with guilt, remembering Lottie, who must have suffered under Shylo and Sophia. She asked Archer and Hero on the day of the planning.</p>
<p>“I need a temporary hiding place for Lottie.” Even if she got out, it would be difficult to enter as a maid because of her ambiguous identity, and it would be dangerous because Shylo came in and out of the palace.</p>
<p>“In that case, I can assist you.”</p>
<p>The Illimas family-owned homes in a variety of areas and found suitable locations.</p>
<p>“I believe we can evacuate and bring her back later.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Hero.” Freya was truly grateful to them, aside from Lucius’ work. She learned from them that there are good people in the world.</p>
<p>“First, I’ll pose as a guest and cause a scene, so save Lottie from the back door.”</p>
<p>Freya nodded firmly in response to Hero’s words. They were last seen planning in a moving carriage.</p>
<p>“Are you required to do it yourself? I can’t sit here and wait. You also don’t have any hands.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t tell many people because she was trying to solve it in secret. She touches the man’s clothes while pretending to be Hero’s escort, and she opens her mouth to Archer, who is sitting across from her.</p>
<p>“Archer, please keep the back door secure.” Hero and Freya broke through the front door, rescued Lottie, and fled through the back door, and Archer, who was waiting for her, decided to take her in the carriage and evacuate her.</p>
<p>“Don’t be concerned.” Archer, who wore a long sword around his waist, had solemn eyes.</p>
<p>It’s a request from someone who never apologizes for anything in her life. Freya was petite, but she had a platform. She received no assistance and did not share her concerns. It is a necessary virtue for survival in a harsh world.</p>
<p>He was the one who was occasionally irritated by Freya’s independence.</p>
<p>“It reminds me of the first time we met.”</p>
<p>The skinny child on the verge of death matured quickly. He couldn’t tell whether it was a girl or a boy because her long hair was rolled into her hat and she was wearing a black coat.</p>
<p>Archer, who left the noble family, has had a difficult life for well over a decade. He could detect a strange unease in Freya’s eyes. He was wondering if she would be all right. She gradually became cheerful, despite having the desolate eyes of a wounded lamb. It was very rewarding and enjoyable to watch, and Freya became gloomy again at some point.</p>
<p>“I should not have let her come to the palace if I had known this would happen.” He simply assumed that by coming to the palace, he would be able to avoid the cold and be satisfied. He was also going to look after Freya and try to find her a good guy if he could.</p>
<p>Something complicated happened in the middle, and it did not go as planned. His Royal Highness was a wonderful man whose loyalty never wavered. But, he did not approve of what he did to Freya.</p>
<p>Archer, who coughed lightly, offered Freya some advice. “Don’t do anything risky, Freya.”</p>
<p>“Of course, take care of yourself.” Freya and Hero exited the carriage at the alley’s entrance when it came to a halt.</p>
<p>The carriage that had left them vanished in front of his eyes.</p>
