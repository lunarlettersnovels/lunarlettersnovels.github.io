            <p><em>I don’t care if he knows wrong facts, but this really isn’t fair.</em></p>
<p>He was the actual real why she’s hurt like this.</p>
<p>Freya frowned at the pain felt from her ankle. It was her that didn’t ignore Lucius and dragged him with all her might to the cave. She even turned that big body around to change him, since she was worried that he might catch a cold while being poisoned.</p>
<p><em>If it wasn’t for me, you might not even be here!</em></p>
<p>If she didn’t use her wit when she heard those suspicious footsteps, their hideout would’ve been discovered because of Lucius’s moans. She got goosebumps imagining what would’ve happened next.</p>
<p><em>To think what I had to do to stop that….</em></p>
<p>Her mind turned blank thinking about the memory. But it was too late to reveal all of that.</p>
<p>Freya unintentionally brushed her lips with her finger.</p>
<p>“What’s that on the back of your hand?”</p>
<p>Lucius, taking his back off the sofa, fixed his sharp gaze on the back of her hand. Freya mumbled as she hid the hand at his question.</p>
<p><em>Would be it ok to tell him the truth.</em></p>
<p>While she was hesitating, Lucius came close to her, grabbed her wrist hard and then lift it up. His lips displayed cold rage.</p>
<p>“You were burned.”</p>
<p>It was her that was burned so she didn’t understand why he was being angry.</p>
<p>“I made a mistake while making tea a moment ago.”</p>
<p>Freya didn’t want to make a fuss. Even she told the truth, who would they believe between the Count’s daughter and a delivery girl from the battlefield?</p>
<p>“Something like this gets better quickly.”</p>
<p>As she moaned because of the arm that was being held, he let it go. Then he glared and went back to the sofa and roughly leaned back.</p>
<p>“I don’t like it when my people are careless. So be careful from now on.”</p>
<p>“….. Okay.”</p>
<p>“Enough with that. Come here.”</p>
<p>He coughed lightly and then called Freya to sit near him.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t even use one arm the first day because of poison it seemed.”</p>
<p>Lucius pointed at his arm while frowning.</p>
<p>“It seems like it was very strong poison. If Sir Gemini also was impacted so heavily…”</p>
<p>Freya had cold sweats as she realized the arm she put her head on was the same arm he was pointing at.</p>
<p><em>Does his arm hurt because I used it as a pillow rather than because of poison?</em></p>
<p>If Lucius found out about the truth, he would take the sword off the wall and…..</p>
<p><em>No. Let’s not think like that.</em></p>
<p>Freya shook her head vigorously.</p>
<p>“Since Herro is examining what kind of poison it is, I’m sure we’ll find out soon.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. Something like this shouldn’t happen again.”</p>
<p>“For someone who stayed in the cave calmly while I was wandering through death, you have a lot of wounds.”</p>
<p>Lucius’s gaze sharply examined her body. The scratches that have yet to heal covered her arms, legs, and cheeks.</p>
<p>Freya gulped at his sharp question.</p>
<p>“That’s because I had to face a beast when we went into the cave.”</p>
<p>“…. What kind of a beast?”</p>
<p>“The one that’s a little big and had yellow fur?”</p>
<p>Her eyes kept shaking and her breathing got rougher as she kept talking.</p>
<p>But she was flustered as she was wondering what kind of beat would be big and have yellow fur after she spoke. Lucius, examining her flustered expression, spoke as he leaned his back.</p>
<p>“A yellow furred beast…”</p>
<p>His tone wasn’t questioning like a moment ago. Actually, it sounded like he was barely holding back laughter.</p>
<p><em>He seemed like he was angry just a moment ago, so what’s going on?</em></p>
<p>Was he just insane or did the poison do this to him?</p>
<p>She was scared whichever it was.</p>
<p>Lucius looked at the back of her hand while kept lightly coughing.</p>
<p>“When Herro comes, show him your wounds.”</p>
<p>“I’m ok. To be healed by a wizard, that’s absurd.”</p>
<p>The grand wizard only took care of the person they’re guarding as a principle.</p>
<p><em>And such kindness, it doesn’t suit him.</em></p>
<p>As Freya looked suspiciously at him, Lucius put his hand on his forehead and mumbled.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t I be uncomfortable if you’re hurt?”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s right.“</p>
<p>Of course, it was probably more for him than her.</p>
<p><em>He just had to say that….</em></p>
<p>There was a reason why saying like being neutral takes you further. His Majesty Lucius was always like that.</p>
<p>‘He makes it that I drop what little affection I have.’</p>
<p>Freya twisted her lips as she looked at him, who had his eyes closed while leaning against the sofa.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Count Adelion, who said he was going back soon, has been staying here for over a week. The soldiers were in good mood every day as they could see lily-like Selena a bit longer. Archer, who also seemed to be smitten by Selena’s beauty, said something he usually wouldn’t.</p>
<p>“Freya. I was thinking we get you a dress.”</p>
<p>“Archer, did you go crazy? How would I work while wearing that.”</p>
<p>“I know, but the battle here is almost over so.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who has yet to completely recover from poison, took his army and completely destroyed the enemy that was aiming the outskirt. They almost accomplished the small goal they came here for. Archer was thinking about helping Freya live a normal life once they leave here.</p>
