            <p>She can push his chest hard with both arms and she’ll get away with it. But Freya did not.</p>
<p>His breath, looking into Freya’s confused eyes, tickled her cheeks. Only then did she come to her senses and groped her lips.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Stay still.”</p>
<p>He put his lips near Freya’s cheek with a wink in one eye. It was a really short moment, but the moment Lucius’ lips touched her flesh, almost made her heart skip.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a real kiss.</p>
<p>“What? Why are you sad?” Lucius teases her.</p>
<p>Her cheeks touched his lips were ticklish, but he was caught up in a regrettable feeling. Then there was a short laugh in her ear.</p>
<p>“You look pretty carried away.”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>“Did you expect me to kiss you?”</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes, Lucius’ blue eyes were looking into her face closely.</p>
<p>“Well, that can’t be true!” Freya’s green eyes, which were furious, had sparked.</p>
<p>There was a wave of unbearable anger at being played down by Lucius. Freya was furious.</p>
<p>She thought her heart stopped beating because she thought it was really a kiss. Freya quivered and he whispered in a mean whisper.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation today.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Freya wanted to be angry, but she was upset that she couldn’t.</p>
<p>“You’re so annoying!”</p>
<p>If she had any power, she would have smacked him on the forehead.</p>
<p>But such a great thing had to stop in the imagination.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving now. Your Highness!”</p>
<p>Freya, whose cheeks were burning, walked toward her room with her fists clenched. Then Lucius closed his eyes and laughed and began to chase after her.</p>
<p>“Freya, I haven’t even brought up my business yet.”</p>
<p>Freya walked quickly without looking back, and silence descended on the Palace, which was noisy by the disturbance caused by the two.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Moonless night, darkness fell deep in the city of Morsiani.</p>
<p>“Michael, this is your last chance.”</p>
<p>“There’s no such thing as that, Her Majesty the Empress.”</p>
<p>MIlady covered in a black cloak, secretly visits the place underneath the castle. She was the second daughter of the Viscount family but in fact, an illegitimate child born of Viscount’s infidelity. Her mother was a gypsy that everyone was pointing fingers at.</p>
<p><em>It’s annoying to be born a self-writer, and even this blood is vulgar.</em></p>
<p>Mature Milady looked up at her mother. She visited her dying mother in a shabby tent and even so couldn’t even ask her mother why she gave birth to her.</p>
<p>“Michael, you didn’t forget Kira.”</p>
<p>Michael’s face hardened noticeably when he mentioned Kira’s name.</p>
<p>She was Milady’s mother and benefactor to raise Michael who was wandering around. Whenever the queen felt his loyalty faltered, she forced him to obey in the name of her mother. With a short sigh, he took his mouth off.</p>
<p>“Of course, I never forgot that.”</p>
<p>Milady gritted her teeth as he watched Michael bowing to her.</p>
<p>“We must find a way to kill Lucius!”</p>
<p>After repeated unsuccessful attempts to kill the crown prince, she became overly nervous.</p>
<p>“The dead queen. I wonder what she did to the crown prince.”</p>
<p>Milady chewed her nails and recalled the dead Empress. She took her place and eventually led to death. But Milady didn’t feel a bit guilty.</p>
<p>Milady’s mother, who died three days after MIlady’s visit, was leaving the gypsy’s blood. She taught her daughter a secret recipe for atonement.</p>
<p>“Magic that can captivate any person at once.” her mother once said.</p>
<p>At first, she thought it was a bluff, but it wasn’t a lie to see that she seduced the Emperor and divorced the first Empress. The thought of the Emperor, who still believes that she is his true love, made MIlady laugh. She untied the robe she was covering, and soon reveal the silk underwear. Milady spread her arms roughly across the table.</p>
<p>Her eyes were smeared with an indelible desire.</p>
<p>“Come here, Michael. It’s a long night.”</p>
<p>Under the faint candle, the silver hair shook and Michael soon breathed hot air into her throat. Milady, who groaned in a heartbeat, whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>“Tempt the stupid girl into yours.”</p>
<p>Michael nodded as he recalled the brown-haired woman he had met the other day under the guise of coincidence. He didn’t mean anything particular to MIady.</p>
<p>He is now staying here just to do the favor of his benefactor, Kira.</p>
<p>“Give me you now, Michael,” Milady commanded.</p>
<p>Michael, in the Empress’ name, buried his head in the bosom of her silk underwear with an emotionless face. His hands slowly peeled off the empress’s underwear and Milady, who was very excited, gasped. Michael’s red eyes were conspicuous by the appearance of the Empress, who was thoroughly naked under him.</p>
<p>“…Hurry!”</p>
<p>At her urging, Michael also took off his clothes and dug into the Empress’ skin. There was no foreplay, but Milady’s insides were already slippery, so it was not difficult to insert.</p>
<p>“Oh my god!”</p>
<p>At the Empress groan, Michael constantly bent his waist from bottom to top. Every time he pushed, MIlady’s legs shook up and down. Michael grabbed her legs, pinned them to her shoulders, and coveted the queen’s interior with all his might. A dilute liquid splashed all over the combined lower body.</p>
<p>“…Michael! Ugh. Push a little harder!”</p>
<p>Michael, who had no expression unlike the Empress’ blushing face, recited to himself.</p>
<p><em>Your Majesty, I will be your dog for a while.</em></p>
<p>Michael’s face with his eyes closed was smeared with a sneer.</p>
