<div class="sc-iCfMLu bZHFRR">Because of Lucius’ visit, Freya’s honey-like rest was wasted.</div>
</div>
<div class="sc-1sp3zau-0 jaefFT sc-1di2uql-0 tiegV" data-tag="post-content">“Yes, that would be great. Yes, that’s a beautiful thing, too.”<p></p>
<p>All afternoon Freya sat motionless in her chair and continued to say meaningless things. As soon as she finished choosing the pieces of stuff, Freya ran out of the room.</p>
<p><em>I want to be alone somewhere.</em></p>
<p>She felt sick after choosing hats and shoes for almost the entire day. She crouched in the corner of the garden, avoiding the eyes crowd.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m so tired. We still have a few months left, and it’s a big deal.”</p>
<p>She thought the aristocrats were not suffering but she was so conscious of the eyes of others that her neck was about to break.</p>
<p>“Don’t do this either. Don’t do that either.”</p>
<p>She picked what she could do comfortably. Freya felt very disappointed in herself and complained every time.</p>
<p>” I’ve been doing this and that all the time.”</p>
<p>If she decided to do it, she would just work hard, but when Freya was having a hard time, her heart was always shaken like a reed.</p>
<p>“You wanted to buy a house. You can do it.” Freya told herself deliberately made a cheerful voice and jumped up from her seat.</p>
<p>“I was wondering why you’re so weak!”</p>
<p>Freya remembered that she couldn’t eat anything all day. She remembered that she was exhausted earlier and refused the dinner that someone brought her.</p>
<p>“You were really out of your mind.”</p>
<p>Her stomach is growling.</p>
<p>“I’m so hungry.”</p>
<p>She’s just as good as a rat in the kitchen.</p>
<p>“But I can’t do that now.”</p>
<p>She’s the girl on the island at the very end of the imperial map. Freya raised her chin a lot, saying she was a nobleman who had never been before, but soon her head fell to the floor.</p>
<p>“I can’t help it.”</p>
<p>Darkness began to fall in the garden, and while looking around, she made a quick decision. Unlike the Empress Palace, the security of the Grand Duke’s Palace here was very lax. There were soldiers with spears, but they were often away.</p>
<p>“And there were more times when I couldn’t see them.”</p>
<p>The part was considered suspicious but soon Freya moved busily like a beast foraging. The Grand Duke had a small kitchen where you could prepare light snacks.</p>
<p>Every time she passed by, Freya smelled something delicious. As she approached the kitchen in the corner of the first floor, she looked inside with an agile movement.</p>
<p>“As expected, there’s no one at this time.”</p>
<p>Everyone must have gone to dinner. At first glance, there seemed to be nothing to eat in the neatly arranged kitchen. But when Freya sniffed, she smelled something savory bread.</p>
<p>“Oh! Here it is.”</p>
<p>The bread was gently contained in the basket covered with cloth, and Freya’s face was colored with happiness.</p>
<p>“What’s there to put on?”</p>
<p>Her taste has changed a little since she came here. She ate moldy or dry porridge well, but now she was choked up when she ate bread without butter or jam.</p>
<p>“Later. I don’t think I can think of a dress or anything else.”</p>
<p>It was a little disappointing to think that she couldn’t eat sweet juice or moist bread. Freya looked around the shelf and found a bottle of jam.</p>
<p>“There are so many kinds of jam!”</p>
<p>The sight made my mouth water. But she couldn’t reach it, so she had to find a way. She dragged a small box of wood and stepped up.</p>
<p>“What? I still can’t reach it.”</p>
<p>Freya had not eaten anything, she consumed all her energy from roaming around. After a short breather, Freya tore off some round bread and mumbled.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s savory and delicious.”</p>
<p>But something was missing. Freya poured water from the table and climbed back onto the box. It’s a delicious bread just to eat, but she could imagine how it would taste if she ate it with strawberry jam. Holding her tiptoe, Freya stretched out her arms, and her balance faltered.</p>
<p>“Oh…!”</p>
<p>Freya thought she was falling to the floor. But thanks to someone holding her, she was safe. The opponent who grabbed Freya’s arm and waist sarcastically said.</p>
<p>“What? Did a rat hide in my kitchen?”</p>
<p>As if in his arms, Freya made a crawling voice.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, what are you doing here?”</p>
<p><em>I mean, why are you here at this time and disturbing me like this?</em></p>
<p>“There’s no one to wait in the room. Why did you come to the kitchen anyway?”</p>
<p>Freya’s eyes shook violently at his question.</p>
<p><em>I can never tell you that I found the kitchen because I was hungry.</em></p>
<p>Lucius, who hugged her lightly, strode across the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please drop me off.”</p>
<p>Pushing her arms against his chest, Freya sat still on the table.</p>
<p>“If you don’t tell me what you’ve been doing behind closed doors, I won’t let you out of here.”</p>
<p><em>He is so persistent.</em></p>
<p>Freya’s face turned pale at the words of Lucius, who leaned over and locked her up in his arms. Freya, who looked into his blue eyes, clenched the hem of his dress.</p>
<p><em>Ah! Is this when we first met?</em></p>
<p>No, it felt like I was begging you to show me my back. By the time she thought his eyelashes were going to touch her cheek, Lucius raised his hand and stretched it out.</p>
<p>“What is this……?”</p>
<p>“Oh…….”</p>
<p>His fingers brushed the soft flesh near her lips. Pounding, Freya’s heart stopped for a moment. Then her eyes trembled at the crumbs on his fingertips. She was already caught.</p>
<p>“Freya, you have to answer.”</p>
<p>“Uh…….”</p>
<p><em>You know everything! Why do you keep questioning me?</em></p>
<p>Her excitement for a moment was unjustified and she was angry.</p>
<p><em>How did I starve myself?</em></p>
<p>Playing absurd aristocrats, Freya missed her meal while choosing a very boring hat. With her mouth shut, she opened it coldly.</p>
<p>“I just ate it before you ate it.”</p>
<p>“So you’re checking to see if it’s poisonous?”</p>
<p>“That’s it.”</p>
<p>Freya was elated to watch Lucius fall for it very easily.</p>
<p>His face, turning his head as he coughed for a while, was all distorted to hold back his laughter.</p>
<p><em>Why is he so cute?</em></p>
<p>Freya, covered with crumbs, looked like a cute hamster.</p>
<p><em>I’m seriously sick, too.</em></p>
