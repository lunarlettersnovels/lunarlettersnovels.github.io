            <p>Half of the Morsiani Empire’s nobles were uninterested in the succession battle, and the other half valued merit over honor. Meanwhile, the majority of them supported Empress Milady, putting Lucius’ crown prince position in jeopardy.</p>
<p>“The situation is dire because of the atrocities committed against many nobles who supported you.”</p>
<p>Hero resumed, a heavy expression on his face.</p>
<p>‘To do anything, you must be alive.’</p>
<p>After taking the medicine Hero gave him, he opened his eyes in an orphanage in an unknown area.</p>
<p>Lucius met a girl in the attic there.</p>
<p>Lucius pretended to be asleep after a brief conversation, and the girl leaving the attic covered Lucius’ shoulder with something. When he opened his eyes and looked around, he noticed that it was very old and shabby. He smoothed it instead of throwing it.</p>
<p>“It’s nice and warm.”</p>
<p>The warm cloth was suffused with a distinct body odor. It felt like someone was hugging a heart that had been wounded and torn apart by another person during a particularly sensitive time.</p>
<p>It was most likely from then.</p>
<p>What stood out, especially among all the other people with green eyes.</p>
<p>Lucius only had a bite of porridge, but the memory of that time made him smile.</p>
<p>“It will not appeal to His Majesty.”</p>
<p>Freya murmured to herself, accepting his laughter as teasing.</p>
<p>She was well aware that there was insufficient food for such a precious person as his Majesty to eat. Unlike orphanages, where only similar foods were served all year, this place was brimming with delicious food to eat.</p>
<p>“I can’t. “All I can do,” Freya said.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t taste bad,” Lucius replied quickly.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>She was embarrassed when Lucius, who she thought was obviously flawed, complimented her.</p>
<p>“It’s oddly nostalgic,” Lucius murmured.</p>
<p>When Freya heard him talking to himself, she pouted.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, why would you eat this porridge?”</p>
<p>After that, Freya and Lucius sat opposite each other, eating porridge without saying anything. The only sound was the stove rattling and the spoon scratching the bottom of the bowl.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time since I’ve eaten, Freya.”</p>
<p>Lucius couldn’t fully appreciate the taste of the food because he had been nervous the entire time. Lucius’ bowl of warm porridge today was as warm and delicious as the shawl at the time.</p>
<p>“Nothing at all…”</p>
<p>Freya was unsure whether Lucius’ words were true or not after his friendly thanks.</p>
<p>“This is in exchange.”</p>
<p>Lucius rose to his feet and pushed a small box in front of her.</p>
<p>“What exactly is this?”</p>
<p>Before Freya could ask, Lucius had vanished, leaving only the groveling maids to peer into the kitchen. Her figure must be a sight to behold in their eyes. It’s unusual for a noble lady to do something rash.</p>
<p>“What in the world is this?”</p>
<p>It’s natural to be upset, but it’s not always necessary.</p>
<p>Freya stood up and walked out of the kitchen, a small box hidden in her long sleeves.</p>
<p>“Lucius is a very strange man,” Freya says quietly.</p>
<p>Freya returned to the room and grumbled as she changed her dress. But, in any case, she was fortunate to have a good day.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long day, and I need to get some rest.”</p>
<p>Freya smiled involuntarily at the memory of the porridge they had eaten earlier.</p>
<p>“Oh, that was there.”</p>
<p>Freya quickly opened the small box and discovered half an orange inside.</p>
<p>“What exactly is this?” “Did he give me the orange he was eating?”</p>
<p>Lucius also clearly enjoys making fun of her.</p>
<p>“How come there’s a teaspoon in it?”</p>
<p>The teaspoon was wrapped in a yellow ribbon. Freya was in a strange mood as she picked up a teaspoon and an orange. The skin is unmistakably orange, but the contents differed from what she expected. It was gleaming and smooth.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure it’s orange.”</p>
<p>She felt a lumpy sensation when she carefully pushed the spoon in. Freya’s eyes were round as she took it to her mouth. It smelled like oranges but wasn’t actually orange.</p>
<p>“Pudding…”</p>
<p>Only then did she notice the gold leaf writing on the surface of the box.</p>
<p>“What exactly is this writing?” Would it be better if he explained it to me if he is going to give me something like this?”</p>
<p>She grumbled to herself because she was embarrassed by Lucius.</p>
<p>“Do I want to try it again?”</p>
<p>Freya quickly ran out of orange peel and a teaspoon as she ate the pudding with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>“I believe I should eat about ten of these.”</p>
<p>Freya, who was smacking her lips, appeared dissatisfied. She removed the skin, but she returned it to the box because it was too pretty to waste a small teaspoon.</p>
<p>“If someone sees it, it’s embarrassing, so where should I hide it?”</p>
<p>Lottie used to make fun of her for collecting pebbles in a small bowl, but she now resembles Lottie from the past.</p>
<p>“Right, there was that as well.”</p>
<p>Freya felt rich for no reason when she placed the glass bottle that Hero had given her. Freya, who had hidden the box well beneath the bed, stretched out loudly and sat against the sofa.</p>
<p>“Good evening…”</p>
<p>Freya quickly closed her eyes as she welcomed the race by gently flying in the breeze on the bedpost.</p>
