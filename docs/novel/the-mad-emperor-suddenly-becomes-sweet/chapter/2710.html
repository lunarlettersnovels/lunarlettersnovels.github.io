            <p>As the sun set, Freya finished her homework and walked back to her room. Freya’s back and shoulders appeared to crack as she sat doing her homework in an awkward stance.</p>
<p>“I’m not even halfway there yet, but I think I need to take a break.”</p>
<p>When Michael offered to help Freya with her homework using magic, Freya felt a twinge of remorse and wished she had taken his offer.</p>
<p>“But I want to do it myself!” Freya exhales.</p>
<p>She put her baggage on the table and went to the balcony without asking for help. She felt sleepy. Freya screamed in astonishment as she opened the door and walked out.</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous, Your Highness!”</p>
<p>Lucius, dressed in a dark cloak, stood at the end of the railing.</p>
<p>With his eyes closed, the Grand Duke floated in the wind. He appeared to plummet swiftly. Despite Freya’s screams, Lucius remained still.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Lucius!”</p>
<p>When Freya yelled again, the golden spell on Lucius’ cloak shook fiercely, causing him to trip over the railing.</p>
<p>“Oh, my goodness!”</p>
<p>Freya couldn’t open her eyes since the small railing was so easy to slide down. Freya put her hands over her eyes and felt a tiny vibration on the balcony floor. Lucius appeared when she opened her eyes. He smiled as he fixed his wind-blown bangs.</p>
<p>“Are you concerned about me, Freya?”</p>
<p>“Who gives a damn about what?”</p>
<p>Freya made a lot of noise. Lucius, who had a flushed cheek when he gazed at her, grinned pleasantly.</p>
<p>“I should undertake risky things more regularly.”</p>
<p>“……?”</p>
<p>The round moon gleamed behind Lucius and Freya while they murmured incoherently.</p>
<p>Freya gritted her teeth, her gaze fixed on the floor. It has nothing to do with whether Lucius does something harmful. Furthermore, she was irritated by the Grand Duke’s constant taunting of her.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s stop thinking about it. I’m rushing to finish my schoolwork.</p>
<p>She was hesitant to return to her room because of her thoughts from the day.</p>
<p>“I have something to tell you since we’ve met in this fashion,” Freya began to say.</p>
<p>“What exactly is going on?” Lucius inquired.</p>
<p>“I think that’s a loss for me, no matter how hard I think about it.”</p>
<p>“How come you say that?”</p>
<p>“I said I’d stay in the barracks at first, but I didn’t mean to play aristocratic games.”</p>
<p>Freya clenched her teeth and pointed at a tight green dress. The face, hair, and shoes were all uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, it’s difficult.”</p>
<p>It irritated Freya to be smacked by Francesca, and she wanted to throw away her homework.</p>
<p>“As a result, I’d like you to meet my requirement.”</p>
<p>“…umm.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t talk for a while as he stared at Freya with green eyes. Hearing her whine was excruciating. And Lucius felt bad that it was all because of his avarice.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to express my gratitude.”</p>
<p>Making these explanations all the time was cowardly. Freya was drenched in a cold perspiration and didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth after a long stare into Freya’s huge, dark green eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I unintentionally caused you pain.”</p>
<p>“……What?”</p>
<p>Freya was taken aback by his apology. She expected Lucius to be irritated or upset.</p>
<p>“I mean it, Freya.”</p>
<p>Lucius’ blond hair shined even brighter now.</p>
<p>“What exactly is it?”</p>
<p>Freya flinched in surprise as his long fingers approached her.</p>
<p>“Wait a second.”</p>
<p>Lucius ripped the hair off her cheek.</p>
<p>“And any request is acceptable.”</p>
<p>Freya took a brief breath at his whisper. She had to shake this hand off. Her body, however, had frozen, and she was unable to move. It was comforting to see herself reflected in Lucius’ blue eyes. His finger soon made contact with a little ink mark on her face.</p>
<p>“You’re not a child.” “What is it, Freya?”</p>
<p>Freya took a step back when the tip of her finger brushed across her cheek. Her back soon came into contact with the railing. As she swayed from the icy sensation, Lucius’ arm caught her.</p>
<p>“You must use caution.”</p>
<p>Freya was irritated rather than grateful that he was holding her.</p>
<p>This would not have happened if you had not done this.</p>
<p>Freya bit her lips tightly, aware of the shoulder catch.</p>
<p>“How come you’re so…”</p>
<p><em>Is he perplexing her?</em></p>
<p>In response to her swallowing cries, Lucius cocked his head.</p>
<p>“What comes next?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>Freya wrenched away from his grasp. But Lucius refused to let her leave.</p>
<p>He appears to have two faces, which is odd.</p>
<p>When she was alone with Lucius, it felt like she was dealing with two different people: the Lucius she knows with other people and the Lucius she knows alone.</p>
<p>He’s so perplexing.</p>
<p>Because the air surrounding her was so dense, Freya felt a lump in her chest.</p>
<p>“Please release my hand.”</p>
<p>“Look at me, Freya.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Lucius’ voice trembled slightly. Freya noticed herself mirrored in his blue eyes as he slowly raised his head. Freya’s cheeks flushed scarlet as her heart began to beat slowly. He was a rambunctious man with a fiery personality who showed no signs of getting along with others.</p>
<p>He’s just too good to be true.</p>
<p>Lucius, who was looking Freya in the eyes, smiled and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Yes, Freya. Are you certain you’re dancing?”</p>
<p>“Are you referring to the dance?”</p>
<p>Her mind raced at the prospect of the dance. Every day, she had a nightmare of falling down in the middle of a ball and being embarrassed.</p>
<p>“The game is in three days.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t had much time to practice lately.”</p>
<p>Freya became enraged once more at the concept of time. Hero swiftly healed her damaged leg, but Pierre, who was filled with passion, was never able to see her again.</p>
<p>“First, let’s practice dancing.”</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>Although the balcony was spacious, practicing dance was difficult. Lucius then approached the railing and offered his hand to her.</p>
<p>“Freya, hold your hand.”</p>
<p>Lucius’ blue eyes sparkled oddly, and she shook her head. Freya had an uneasy feeling about it.</p>
<p>“I’ll take the stairs.”</p>
<p>“Then it sticks out, and there isn’t much time.”</p>
