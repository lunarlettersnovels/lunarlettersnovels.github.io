            <p>Freya only smelled the alcohol, it was Lucius who drank it.</p>
<p>“I didn’t drink it. I was curious, but…”</p>
<p>“Then what are you going to say about the guy who was with you earlier?”</p>
<p>His words reduced Freya’s excitement. All of this happened because of the contract with his Majesty.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s her fault for being blinded by gold coins.</p>
<p>She spent two months trying to become Miss de Bua in a region where she don’t even know where it was.</p>
<p>“Since I came here, I was doing my best. That’s why I’m taking all kinds of classes.”</p>
<p>Lucius sighed at her words as he swept up his bangs scattered by the wind. He didn’t mean to do this.</p>
<p><em>Poor Freya, she cannot do the things she wanted here.</em></p>
<p>Lucius looked at her, Freya who was looking at the lake reflected the sunset on her face that was so beautiful that Lucius couldn’t take his eyes off it.</p>
<p><em>I want to see you so beautifully like this only.</em></p>
<p>Lucius had become more childish than usual as if really drunk.</p>
<p>“Don’t hang out with other men in the palace.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“I don’t want our relationship to be questioned for nothing,” Lucius added a poor excuse.</p>
<p>“You know what?”</p>
<p>Freya turned her head towards Lucius, the moment she had her full view of his face, Freya was speechless.</p>
<p><em>……beautiful.</em></p>
<p>Blond hair swaying gently in the breeze, blue eyes like a lake, red cheeks, and moist lips.</p>
<p><em>You sound jealous when you say that.</em></p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed, Freya had to press her heart gently. Hate him, beat him, and it must have been really crazy.</p>
<p>“You have to answer, Freya.”</p>
<p>Freya, who was about to answer him, bit her lip gently. She wasn’t immature to imagine the world would be all pink. While they strolled, she felt how harsh the world was.</p>
<p><em>This uncertainty just interferes with my work.</em></p>
<p>At this rate, it was clear that she would be dragged by Lucius for the rest of the seven months. She was both excited and disappointed by his meaningless words.</p>
<p><em>You’re already doing that.</em></p>
<p>On days when Lucius did not come, she wandered outside the balcony for a long time. From one day on, Freya waited for a small box that he brought. When she saw the crown prince, her mouth was watering, a habit that was really scary.</p>
<p><em>Poorly, what is this?</em></p>
<p>Then Freya realized that she was vulnerable to affection. Even Sophia, who was always evil to her, belonged to a welcome face as a child.</p>
<p><em>You have to throw away the weak part of yourself. </em>Freya told herself.</p>
<p>Only then can you survive. With a calm mind, she took her mouth off her lips.</p>
<p>“It was Archer who I was with a while ago. I was glad to see him after a long time, so I just talked to him, but I didn’t know it will create a big fuss.”</p>
<p>Freya said it out of anger, but it was true.</p>
<p>There weren’t enough people to talk to here in the palace. Lucius was always busy, and he sometimes said that she would be taken care of Hero, but it was only for a moment. Freya thought she was used to being alone but she was mistaken. Lucius’ face darkened as he was looking at Freya’s gloomy expression.</p>
<p>“……did you feel lonely?”</p>
<p>“There’s no one who’s not lonely.”</p>
<p>Freya hated the atmosphere that kept getting awkward. It’s just that Prince Lucius is a nobleman, so he’s yelling all the time, and she’s good enough to keep up with the rhythm.</p>
<p><em>There are only seven months left.</em></p>
<p>Freya, who jumped up from her seat, approached the lake. The swan floated leisurely over the fine waves. Now she was shining on the lake, which was completely red, and Lucius came next to her. When he told Freya earlier is she was lonely, he felt like crying.</p>
<p><em>What should I do with you?</em></p>
<p>Lucius wanted to hug her right away and show her everything. But it’s not the time yet.</p>
<p><em>You have to hold it in.</em></p>
<p>Lucius’ long wobbly eyelashes, barely calmed down, soon headed for Freya. His heart leaped again at her glare of the lake.</p>
<p><em>You are not alone, Freya.</em></p>
<p>His determined eyes touched Freya’s recalled cheeks for a long time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Freya was sitting in the classroom where she had a dance class. If looked closely, it was almost collapsed rather than sitting.</p>
<p>‘You’re out of breath.’</p>
<p>Freya was out of breath but she struggled to get up again.</p>
<p>‘You have to practice properly.’</p>
<p>After Lucius’ strange acting by the lake, he visited her more often than before and bothered her.</p>
<p>‘You’ll have to learn how to dance well.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>She wasn’t particularly good at anything else, including dancing. Freya kept missing the beat, and her body was stiff.  It was hard to tell whether she was dancing or fighting.</p>
<p>‘If you can’t dance well, I can help you.’</p>
<p>His threat under the guise of kindness brought Freya to her senses. If she doesn’t do it right, she may have to practice dancing with Lucius.</p>
<p>‘Thank you for saying that, but I’ll try harder.’</p>
<p>Freya, who recalled that time, swept her heart.</p>
<p>“Practice is the only way to live!”</p>
<p>She stood up and tried to strengthen her will.</p>
<p>“You already did this before.”</p>
<p>It was very awkward to do it alone while reviewing the movements she learned. Then someone stuck their head out between the open door.</p>
<p>“Did I disturb you?”</p>
<p>“Hello, Michael.”</p>
<p>The man she met in the garden the other day was carrying a package in his arms.</p>
<p>“I was on my way, but I heard something, so I came.”</p>
<p>“Aha.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the sound of Freya’s twisting feet and falling. She scratched her head, blushing for no reason, and put down what Michael had.</p>
<p>“Can I help you? Isn’t it hard to practice alone?”</p>
<p>“Dance?”</p>
<p>There’s no reason to dance unless you’re an aristocrat.</p>
<p>Only then did Freya wonder what the other person was doing.</p>
<p>He certainly wasn’t a nobleman, but he wasn’t even dressed for his servants. Recognizing her question, Michael quickly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“I am Prince Hart’s wizard.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re a wizard.”</p>
<p>A wizard, somehow, felt friendly. Moreover, when he lowered his cloak, his eyes were as red as heroin.</p>
<p><em>Can I ask you a favor like that?</em></p>
<p>Hero had said he had never danced, and Gemini was not close enough to make such a request. Archer would have been happy to help, but it wasn’t time. It was time to borrow a brackish hand to avoid one-on-one lessons with Lucius.</p>
<p>“Then can I ask you a little bit of shame?”</p>
<p>“I learned a little bit when I was young, so I’m not good at it either.”</p>
<p>“This is my first time.”</p>
<p>Michael put down what he was carrying and soon took off his cloak. Long silver hair was scattered over the shoulders, and a robe over the slender body was revealed. Freya, enraptured by his dazzling beauty, stood blankly, and he reached out his hand.</p>
<p>“Hold hands like this first.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The dance that started like that was very smooth.</p>
<p><em>He said it’s been a while, but his skills are still amazing.</em></p>
<p>Michael’s dancing was so good that she was able to master the part she had failed earlier.</p>
<p>“It’s advantageous for people who have practiced a lot since they were young.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>
<p>“So Freya is talented.”</p>
<p>Freya’s face, which had been encouraged by his praise, bloomed brightly. She thought there were only bad and weird people in the world, but she guess that’s not the only one. Having gained confidence, Freya struggled through the narrow and long practice room.</p>
<p>“You’re doing a great job.”</p>
<p>Michael’s red eyes stood out in her arms.</p>
