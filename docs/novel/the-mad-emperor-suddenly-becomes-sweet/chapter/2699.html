        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>Her bosom was so deep that the flesh bulged through her silk dress. As she appeared stealthily, Lucius abruptly turned his back. He had not intended to bring Freya into the room in her inebriated state, hoping to keep her hidden from view.</p>
<p>“Oh, Goddess Diana is testing me,” Lucius muttered to himself, rubbing his face with his large hand. He turned off all the lights in the room, allowing moonlight to filter through the small window, filling the room with the sound of Freya’s breathing and the intensity of Lucius’s gaze.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Freya’s daily routine remained largely unchanged. She still attended classes on proper etiquette, drank tea with the empress, and endured tedious meetings. The aristocratic ladies, however, seemed to take a keen interest in her.</p>
<p>But in one way, things were very different.</p>
<p>She couldn’t bring herself to meet Lucius’s gaze. She refused to acknowledge that what happened on the night of their engagement wasn’t just a dream.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was impossible to forget.</p>
<p>The scent and warmth of that night lingered in her memory, as did the goosebumps on her skin. When she saw Lucius after that night, she was much more self-conscious.</p>
<p>“Yes, Freya, about the wedding…”</p>
<p>“What?!” Freya choked on a piece of cake that Lucius had brought back from his provincial patrol.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for a long engagement.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Grace,” Freya whispered, looking around for Bell and Miriam, who were attending to the carriage.</p>
<p>“The contract is almost up.”</p>
<p>The end of the year, which had once seemed so distant, was now just three months away.</p>
<p>“It’s not a real engagement. Why do we have to get married?”</p>
<p>But when she saw the serious expression on Lucius’s face, her heart sank.</p>
<p>“Freya, you can’t say no without giving it proper consideration. Didn’t we already discuss this?”</p>
<p>It was then that she remembered him promising to give her ten times the amount of a gold coin. She had thought it was a ridiculous offer, but she had listened anyway. Now, after seeing his slightly gaunt face and feeling a strange sense of pity, she knew that she would probably make another mistake if she stayed with him like this.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I have an important appointment today. I’ll see you later.”</p>
<p>“How come I wasn’t informed? What’s the deal?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you everything later.”</p>
<p>Freya quickly rose from her seat before he could catch her.</p>
<p>Wearing a cape prepared by Miriam, Freya ran down the hallway, ignoring the sideways glances from some people.</p>
<p>“Artsy!”</p>
<p>“Slow down, or you’re going to fall.”</p>
<p>“Archer, you know you’re acting strange lately, right?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Archer, who had suffered from dermatitis and had only worn smelly, baggy clothes, had now appeared well-dressed. He wore blue pants, a white shirt, and a black jacket, and he looked like a noble gentleman to everyone.</p>
<p>“You look like a nobleman.”</p>
<p>“I am a nobleman.”</p>
<p>As Archer approached the carriage he had prepared in advance, Hero appeared.</p>
<p>“Can Hero come with us?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have to go out and buy some herbs.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s settled.”</p>
<p>Freya was going to visit Lottie today. It was a pretext to check on him and organize a rescue operation. However, it was not easy because the empress was always under surveillance. Today’s outing was also supposed to be a visit to a relative’s house with Archer.</p>
<p>“Freya, may I ask what kind of friend she is?”</p>
<p>She hadn’t told anyone about her time at the orphanage yet. She wasn’t ashamed, but it wasn’t a good story to hear. Besides, she was cautious because Shylo might be chasing her.</p>
<p>But with Archer and Hero, it would be fine. With great determination, Freya looked up from the rattling carriage. Archer and Hero, who sat across from her, looked at each other and opened their mouths.</p>
<p>“We met when we were at the orphanage.”</p>
<p>And she briefly explained the story to them.</p>
<p>“I promised that if I made a fortune, I would come back and take her with me.”</p>
<p>However, when she met Shylo at the engagement banquet, she suddenly became scared. If she saved enough money and Lottie didn’t get away with her, it would be pointless.</p>

<p>“Freya, do you happen to remember seeing a blond child with striking beauty while you were living in the orphanage?” Hero asked, his attention focused on her story.</p>
<p>Freya’s eyes widened in surprise at the question. “Can a wizard know that? I do remember having a friend like that.”</p>
<p>Hero listened to the story intently, pulling his cloak around himself again at the end of it. Archer interjected with a series of questions, his curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>“So, you’re planning to see if she’s still alive today, aren’t you?” Archer inquired.</p>
<p>“Yes, but we can’t act recklessly or we might make a mistake,” Hero replied.</p>
<p>The problem still remained, however. Lottie might not be there, and even if she were, it wouldn’t be easy to gain access.</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of it,” Hero said, removing his cape and grinning as he winked at one eye.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m confident with my face.”</p>
<p>Archer smiled in agreement, his mouth quirking up in a soft smile, as Freya watched the two in agony.</p>
<p>“Archer, you’re the Empire’s greatest knight. You’ll need to provide cover for Hero,” Freya said, the weight of their mission settling upon her once more.</p>
<p>“Well, well, that’s true. The Empire is the best,” Archer replied with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Soon, the carriage came to a stop on a wide road near their destination, and Hero and Archer set out for their mission. The carriage quickly became silent, and Freya leaned her head back and dozed off for a while. Rest was essential, for without it, they would quickly deplete their physical strength. As she was about to drift off, she heard a faint whisper in her ear.</p>
<p>“Freya, Freya…”</p>
