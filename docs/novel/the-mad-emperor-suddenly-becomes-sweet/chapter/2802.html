            <p>“Please don’t stand there like that, Michael. Can you give me a boost?”</p>
<p>Michael was the only person she could rely on now. He gave her a faint smile and whispered to Milady,</p>
<p>“My Majesty the Empress, it’s all over now.”</p>
<p>Milady looked at him in confusion as he gently removed her hand from his wrist. Michael continued,</p>
<p>“I think it will be difficult to place Your Highness Hart on the throne, but as you wish, I will make his eyes shed tears of blood. I swear it.”</p>
<p>Michael had been attacked without anyone knowing, but he managed to kiss the back of the empress’s hand, barely holding back his own blood. He kept his promise to the gypsy Kira, who had saved him from dying. He gave all his strength to Milady, Kira’s daughter, and made her wish come true.</p>
<p>“Michael, Michael,” Milady cried out in terror as the soldiers trapped her body. She reached out her hands and made eye contact with the aristocrats who had once kissed her feet. However, they all hurriedly turned their heads as if they had seen the plague.</p>
<p>“Count Edelion, you can’t do this to me,” Milady pleaded, but the count, who had just pledged his allegiance to her, covered his face with his hands.</p>
<p>He was in danger of being taken to an underground prison. The consequences of being in the same boat as Empress Milady, who had committed treason, were harsh. He had been proud of his ability to calculate, but this time he had been completely wrong. He had dismissed Lucius as a mad prince and thought he could change it at any time.</p>
<p>“My daughter, Selena,” he thought to himself, as tears flowed down his face. The fall of his family and his own destruction were terrible, but what about Selena, who had only dreamed of a bright future? Milady continued to curse as she was dragged out, while Lucius stood still and opened his mouth, clearly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“I should not forget that it was you who ignited a fire in my young heart, making me want to become an emperor.”</p>
<p>Exhausted from the tedious work, Lucius contemplated giving up on what his stepmother so desperately wanted.  He felt weak, but back then, it was that hard.</p>
<p>“Hey, you there!”</p>
<p>Finally, Milady was completely dragged out, and the conference room fell silent.</p>
<p>“Is it almost finished?”</p>
<p>Looking around at the aristocrats sitting in the chamber, Lucius exhaled deeply and spoke.</p>
<p>“I would like to express my admiration for the wisdom of the Crown Prince.”</p>
<p>“The House of Barrios pledges allegiance to His Highness.”</p>
<p>“The Cio Dels have always believed in you.”</p>
<p>Lucius smiled at the loyalty of those changing their allegiance. There was no need to pretend. Whether they liked it or not, they were the ones who had to build the future of the empire together.</p>
<p>“Since we’re gathered here, it would be better to have dinner together.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Hero’s eyes filled with tears at the sight of Lucius skillfully dominating the aristocracy. He didn’t know how long he had been waiting for a moment like this. Gemini also struggled to control his overwhelming emotions, and her hand holding her sword at her waist trembled slightly. After all the other nobles left the chamber, only Lucius and Count Diverto remained.</p>
<p>“Why did you suddenly change your mind, Count Diverto?”</p>
<p>The count’s support was very useful, but in fact, Lucius was determined to win today even without his help.</p>
<p>“It’s all because of my daughter.”</p>
<p>Did the count have a daughter?</p>
<p>All he confirmed was that it was his grown son, Viscount Gabriel. He said Gabriel was a man who looked just like his father and was a very good knight. Then Lucius suddenly remembered the story Hero had told me.</p>
<p>“The Tragedy of Diverto.”</p>
<p>He said the count had lost his newborn baby. The shock had killed the countess, and she stopped going outside.</p>
<p>“I have lived secluded from the world behind a wall for more than a decade,” the count said.</p>
<p>“I see,” Lucius replied.</p>
<p>“But with the protection of the goddess Diana, I was able to find my daughter.”</p>
<p>“Congratulations, count. That’s a relief to hear.”</p>
<p>The count’s face lit up as he spoke of finding his long-lost daughter.</p>
<p>“My daughter has taken it upon herself to empower those who have no one else to believe in but His Highness Lucius.”</p>
<p>Lucius was intrigued. “And who is your daughter?” he asked.</p>
<p>The question hung in the air, leaving everyone waiting for the count’s response.</p>
