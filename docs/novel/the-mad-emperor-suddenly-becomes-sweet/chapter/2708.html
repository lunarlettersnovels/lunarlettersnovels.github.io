            <p style="text-align: left;">Lucius spoke just as Freya was going to elevate her butt.</p>
<p>“This was a frequent destination for my mom and me.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Freya’s eyes furrowed as she first heard the Grand Duke’s description of the previous Empress. It was as though the deceased Empress had never existed in the palace. There was no portrait on display in the Crown Prince’s Palace.</p>
<p>“My mother admired the graceful motion of the swan.”</p>
<p>Freya, on the other hand, was awestruck upon seeing the swan for the first time.</p>
<p>“I had no idea such a large and gorgeous bird existed.”</p>
<p>Lucius shrugged. “However, she claimed that the coolest aspect is that the lovely bird continues to tap its feet underwater.”</p>
<p>As Freya scrutinized the feet of a bird that appeared at ease, the lake’s surface expanded.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, your mother?”</p>
<p>She passed away due to illness when I was a child.</p>
<p>His expression appears sad as he discusses his mother. Freya contemplated the term “mother” as she regarded the glistening surface of the lake. Freya is frequently depressed when she considers the fact that she does not know her parents, but she is also interested in their presence.</p>
<p><em>Whose eyes do I see with? Why am I left alone there?</em></p>
<p>Freya suddenly felt chilly, so she gathered her knees and wrapped her arms around them.</p>
<p>Freya believed that she was not lonely, but her behavior suggested otherwise.</p>
<p>“You are the first person I bring here.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Her ears were tickled by Lucius’ low voice in the night air. His voice was so enchanting that Freya placed her hand on her chest.</p>
<p><em>It is beginning again. Stop acting as though you’re a couple.</em></p>
<p>Occasionally, this perplexed her. Freya inhaled deeply and then stretched her legs.</p>
<p><em>Do not be misled; visualize a tiny house and garden.</em></p>
<p>She ignored this sensation the entire time, but it was evident that she liked Lucius.</p>
<p><em>Regain control of yourself. There will be nothing nice in my life if I fall in love with you.</em></p>
<p>The conclusion was so inevitable that it was pointless to contemplate. Freya has heard many stories about this location.</p>
<p>{She ruined his life by allowing a nobleman to control her.}</p>
<p>{The infant was not identified.}</p>
<p>It was lucky that so much feeling still existed. She is merely anxious.</p>
<p><em>I will pretend to be an aristocrat for a few months before leaving with my money.</em></p>
<p>Freya purposefully opened her mouth with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“My dancing abilities have increased significantly, right?”</p>
<p>“I’ll feel embarrassed if this continues. “You must exercise every day.”</p>
<p>But his words made Freya feel forlorn.</p>
<p>Freya believes that if she continues to do this daily, her heart will not survive.</p>
<p>A little gift protruded before her as she bowed her head.</p>
<p>“Open it.”</p>
<p>When she unfolded the white handkerchief, she saw that it contained candies that resembled gems. The night breeze was wonderfully infused with fruity aromas.</p>
<p>“Is it edible?” Freya narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Of course.” The Grand Duke cried out.</p>
<p>Freya examined the fine sweets carefully before selecting the yellow one. The circular object in her mouth smelled simultaneously of bananas and mild lemons.</p>
<p>“It is extremely good.”</p>
<p>Freya’s melancholy eventually dissipated as a result of the sweetness she tasted.</p>
<p>“You look like a squirrel.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who was observing Freya with one cheek protruding, bowed his eyes and laughed.</p>
<p>“Why a squirrel?”</p>
<p>Freya immediately turned around and said to herself.</p>
<p>“I brought you something tasty, so let’s overlook it today.”</p>
<p>Freya opened her mouth and extended her handkerchief as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Please accept one of these, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Then I will go with this.”</p>
<p>His extended fingers captured a green sucker. Lucius held the sweet in the air between his fingers without inhaling.</p>
<p>It appears that the moon is also green.</p>
<p>“It is rather strange to have a green moon.”</p>
<p>“Is that right?”</p>
<p>He fidgeted for an extended period while holding the candy in his mouth. Freya asked as she observed him enjoying the chocolates carefully.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, how does this taste?”</p>
<p>“Are you curious?”</p>
<p>“There was only a single…I’ll tell you; close your eyes.”</p>
<p>The enigmatic words Lucius uttered were a warning of imminent disaster. It was difficult for him to keep his eyes off her face, which appeared even more listless than usual. She stutteringly turned her head just slightly.</p>
<p>“I am no longer curious.”</p>
<p>“I sincerely want to inform you.”</p>
<p>His hand rolled over and kissed Freya’s brown hair. Freya tightly clenched her eyes due to her own excitement.</p>
<p><em>He is a truly naughty person. </em>Freya cried inwardly.</p>
<p>Freya did not wish to do this, but his lips so irritated her.</p>
<p><em>What if we at least kissed each other?</em></p>
<p>Freya’s lips were quivering and her shoulders were rigid due to her absurd fantasy. Lucius’s head began to move as her hair began to curl.</p>
<p>“I am closing my eyes, hence I cannot see it.”</p>
<p>His bodily odor and heat emanated from close proximity.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God.”</p>
<p>With Freya’s heart quivering uncontrollably, she squeezed her hand. His breath gently stroked his cheek. She inhaled with surprise, detecting mint in the air.</p>
<p>“Peppermint…”</p>
<p>“Why are you closing your eyes, Freya?”</p>
<p>Before she realized it, Lucius was throwing a little rock into the water while he was away from her.</p>
<p>“There is merely a fly in my eye.”</p>
<p>Freya responded abruptly while rolling the candy violently in her mouth. She had no expectations, yet she felt resentful.</p>
