            <p>He had no intention of letting her go now that he found her.</p>
<p>“Freya, don’t worry about a thing from now on.” He hesitated for a while before lifting up Freya and heading to the bedroom.</p>
<p>“Mm…” Her hand touched his arm as it dropped. Lucius’s ears blushed immediately at such small touch. He tried not to look, but his gaze kept touching her lips. The heat that was created on a rainy night could be felt.</p>
<p><em>Lucius! Get a hold of yourself.</em></p>
<p>He shook his head, lifted Freya, and walked into the bedroom over the curtain. This was solely his area and he let no woman in until now.</p>
<p>“Freya, you’re the first.”</p>
<p>She stumbled to the bed as he carefully laid her and mumbled lowly.</p>
<p>“You’ll fall….”</p>
<p>A long sigh came out from him as he tucked her away under a blanket and turned away.</p>
<p><em>I thought it’d be all okay if I found my memory….</em></p>
<p>He returned to his bed and lay down beside her. His stare was pointed at Freya, who was sound asleep.</p>
<p><em>Did she grow a bit taller since?</em></p>
<p>It felt like he could remember her voice as she was boasting that she was thirteen.</p>
<p>He was sixteen then.</p>
<p>He remembered he flared up as she treated him like a child.</p>
<p><em>You wanted me to call you big sis even though you didn’t even reach my neck.</em></p>
<p>Lucius locked his hands and used them as a pillow as he stared at Freya, who was moving her lips and smiling. She was the only one that could make him smile now and then.</p>
<p>Lucius sighed again.</p>
<p><em>If it wasn’t for the side effect of the antidote…..</em></p>
<p>He would’ve immediately gone to find her at the orphanage. He was very angry that he wasted three years.</p>
<p>How long would she have waited for him? Freya would’ve had a hard time at the orphanage.  Thinking about it made him angry which drove him insane.</p>
<p><em>It’s alright. There’s more time left. I’ve already found you.</em></p>
<p>As he came to that conclusion, he felt a little calmer.</p>
<p><em>You’re the only one for me, Freya.</em></p>
<p>Like always, it was just that he didn’t realize it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>For some reason, she felt light as a feather waking up in the morning. As Freya stretched out her arms and yawned, she touched a soft cloth.</p>
<p>“….. Soft?”</p>
<p>The only that she touched on Archer’s tent floor were bones or squashed fruit. As she felt an unfamiliar touch, she stood up and sat.</p>
<p>“Oh my god! There’s no way.”</p>
<p>She was lying on the bed she swore she would never lie in.</p>
<p>“When did I come here?”</p>
<p>She remembered Archer saying that her sleeping habit was wacky. Did she get up and just walk around too?</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything bad right?”</p>
<p>She remembered acting up to Lucius while asking for more meat.</p>
<p>“No. That can’t be possible.”</p>
<p>Her back was completely wet just by thinking of it.</p>
<p>As she glanced, his bed was empty.</p>
<p>“I have to be hurry!”</p>
<p>She was panicking as she was going to get scolded for sleeping in.</p>
<p><em>You’re trying to get free money? You must have pride as the Crown Prince’s servant.</em></p>
<p>The Crown Prince’s nagging was out of this world.</p>
<p>As Freya tidied up a little and made both of the beds, she heard a conversation outside.</p>
<p><em>What? He’s working already?</em></p>
<p>It seemed like there was no way she wouldn’t be scolded today. The voice she heard was getting louder.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty. There’s no way the Emperor can ignore this time.”</p>
<p>“There’s no one that doesn’t know about your achievement of driving out the enemies’ outskirt.”</p>
<p>It was Gemini and Herro’s voices, which sounded like they were a little worked up.</p>
<p><em>It sounds like they’re having a pretty serious convo, so can I just leave?</em></p>
<p>Freya hesitated in front of the curtain.</p>
<p>“But, there’s one more thing left.”</p>
<p>Her attention automatically went to Lucius’s strangely exciting voice.</p>
<p>“This is outrageous. To put all kinds of conditions on the rightful heir!”</p>
<p>As enraged Herro criticized the Emperor, Gemini hit the sword against the ground a few times.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t help His Majesty at all.”</p>
<p>“Like I didn’t know that…..”</p>
<p>Freya gulped over the curtain.</p>
<p><em>The Crown Prince isn’t in the Emperor’s favor?</em></p>
