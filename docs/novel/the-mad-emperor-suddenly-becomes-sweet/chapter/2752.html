            <p>Even though he went through all the trouble in the war, no one from the palace came to congratulate him. She thought if you were born as a royal it would be a flowery path, but it didn’t seem like it.</p>
<p><em>He almost died too.</em></p>
<p>She remembered the day Lucius fell while bleeding. It was more often than she thought. But she eventually shook her head.</p>
<p>‘They said worrying about the nobles is the most useless thing in the world.”</p>
<p>Herro was a Grand Wizard Gemini was a great knight so there was no need to worry.</p>
<p><em>I have the biggest problem out of all of them.</em></p>
<p>She didn’t even know what was going to happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>Freya held on to the curtain and hesitated but then someone opened the curtain. Because of that she lost her balance and leaned forward.</p>
<p>“Uh, uh…..”</p>
<p>Someone’s solid hand grabbed her waist and hands as she was about to stumble forward. Freya lifted her head and awkwardly met Lucius’s eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s a bad habit to eavesdrop.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to.”</p>
<p>She stood up straight, and blushed as she listed out her excuse. How could I not hear it when you’re speaking so loudly right beside me?</p>
<p>“Freya, you were there?”</p>
<p>Herro waved his hands cheerfully at her.</p>
<p>“H, hello.”</p>
<p>Freya was embarrassed as she was caught eavesdropping so she couldn’t lift her head and stammered. Then she realized that Lucius was still holding her wrist.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, my hand….”</p>
<p>But for some reason, Lucius held onto it tighter.</p>
<p>“Freya, hush. I’m going to say something important now.”</p>
<p>As she just woke up, she just nodded at his words. Lucius waved the hand he was holding and smiled.</p>
<p>“I’m dating the daughter of the Count’s family from the del Mundo region with marriage in mind.”</p>
<p>“….. What?”</p>
<p>Herro’s voice was so loud that it would pierce through the tent. For him as Lucius’s closest personnel to hear this for the first time!</p>
<p><em>He wouldn’t let a woman get close to him.</em></p>
<p>But to be dating someone came as a shock. Especially Del Mundo was too weak of a region to give him proper support.</p>
<p>“Who is that lady?”</p>
<p>Even Gemini, who was normally quiet, spoke in surprise. Herro gathered his mind and then asked again.</p>
<p>“What about Selena? No, first, when did you start seeing this person?”</p>
<p>“Why is everyone so curious?”</p>
<p>Lucius pushed Freya to the front instead of answering. Her brown and pretty long hair touched the shoulders, and her questioning green eyes were full of fear.</p>
<p>“I’ll introduce you to her. It’s Freya de Bua.”</p>
<p>“…. Pardon?”</p>
<p>Lucius was the only one not surprised at this. Everyone covered their mouth and kept blinking, and a heavy silence followed. Freya, while pointing at herself, stammered.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, you don’t mean me as that Freya right?”</p>
<p>“You’re pretty smart.”</p>
<p>Lucius looked very satisfied and Herro quickly intervened.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty! Freya isn’t noble.”</p>
<p>“She is starting today.”</p>
<p>Lucius took out a document and showed it to them. He was no longer a small boy that was scared of assassination attempts.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After the sudden engagement announcement, Gemini and Herro left to take care of urgent work, and only two of them were left in the tent. Freya couldn’t think for a while about such a shocking event.</p>
<p><em>What is going on? Who is de Bua, and why am I a noble?</em></p>
<p>She thought over and over again but couldn’t come up with anything.</p>
<p>And del Mundo, she never heard of this place.</p>
<p>She kept quiet for a long time and then spoke.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I really don’t know.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“How I can be a noble and that I’m dat-?”</p>
<p>Freya murmured as she couldn’t put say such a word. Not just dating, but dating for engagement.</p>
<p>Lucius, who looked relaxed, gave her a glass of water.</p>
<p>“You look like you’re going to faint.”</p>
<p>Freya felt like she was going to faint but was also very annoyed at the Crown Prince, who looked relaxed.</p>
<p>“How can I not be surprised by something like this?”</p>
<p>Freya drank and wiped her mouth, then Lucius spoke seriously.</p>
<p>“You remember what we talked about before. How long our contract….”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>But what does that have to do with this?</em></p>
<p>As Freya frowned, he took out a paper from his drawer and showed her.</p>
<p>“This is a copy so read it.”</p>
<p>Her head was spinning from looking at all the letters on the document. As Freya just rolled her eyes, he took the document.</p>
<p>“I’ll read the important part for you.”</p>
<p>Lucius slowly read the violation of the contract.</p>
<p>“Unless the death of the contractor, the duration of the contract must be fulfilled.”</p>
<p>“….. Ugh.”</p>
<p> </p>
