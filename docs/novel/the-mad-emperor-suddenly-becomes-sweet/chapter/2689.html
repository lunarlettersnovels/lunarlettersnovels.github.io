            <p>Hero has had a lot of training and has shown that he is always willing to do what he is told.</p>
<p>Even Gemini, the most trustworthy knight, was at Lucius’ side.</p>
<p>“However, why am I so anxious?”</p>
<p>He isn’t even a helpless child who couldn’t save her mother until the very end. Even a brief respite brought him so much pain.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, would you prefer medication?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay. Is there any other messenger like the one we sent?”</p>
<p>“Thankfully not?”</p>
<p>It was instructed to send a notification whenever something occurred at the palace.</p>
<p>“Is there an issue?”</p>
<p>Gemini inquired while seeing Lucius’ countenance, which was impossibly black. Given that the silent subordinate closed his mouth, the utterance must have been quite impressive. The embarrassed Lucius patted Gemini’s shoulder and nodded, assuring him that everything was fine.</p>
<p>“I can’t sleep because I’m so enthusiastic about the impending conclusion.”</p>
<p>A soldier standing next to Lucius smiled and shook his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I suppose my rumors have not changed.”</p>
<p>“I believe it will be simple for at least the next decade.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who was laughing meanly at Gemini’s joke, turned his eyes to the palace in the distance.</p>
<p>“Before going to the palace, I will visit a specific location.”</p>
<p>He intended to purchase Freya a white-cream-filled cake. On each journey back to the palace, Lucius stopped at a bakery to purchase cookies or bread. She has no idea how proud he was whenever he carried out a neatly wrapped box.</p>
<p><em>because I can do so much that I was unable to do before.</em></p>
<p>There was so much going on that he could not adequately explain it to her.</p>
<p>All misunderstandings will be cleared up if you apologize repeatedly and communicate appropriately.</p>
<p>Freya is the only one who has ever held his hand, both then and now.</p>
<p>His blue eyes, which were momentarily lost in meditation, became progressively cooler. He gathered his golden hair with his hand and then opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Leader, let us now depart.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take orders.”</p>
<p>Gemini told the soldiers to get back to work when Lucius put on the helmet he had taken off.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty, I’d like to introduce you to Viscount Ferrol.”</p>
<p>“Ferrol?”</p>
<p>The empress cocked her head when she heard the name of a family she was unfamiliar with. There was, however, no reason not to meet. The majority of the aristocrats kneeling before her donate valuable items.</p>
<p>“Inform her to come in.”</p>
<p>“Your Imperial Majesty’s, Best Wishes, Diana.”</p>
<p>Milady scowled as the woman wearing a veil entered the room.</p>
<p>“Everyone, go out.”</p>
<p>She was not pleased with the visit of the guest, whom she believed she would never see again.</p>
<p>“Really?” “You are Viscount Ferrol, correct?”</p>
<p>It was clear that all of the names were made up. Her back is just as awful as Sophia’s.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I offer you a significant amount of money because I didn’t want to meet in this manner?”</p>
<p>“Money vanished rapidly.”</p>
<p>“What a disgraceful…”</p>
<p>“Can’t Your Majesty have a little mercy on me?”</p>
<p>Milady grinned in response to the sudden threat.</p>
<p>“Do you know with whom you’re speaking?”</p>
<p>Before entering the palace, Sophia resided in the basement of the same home.</p>
<p>“I am aware of the fact that your Majesty appreciates these things. “I’m sure you’ve seen some of my credit as well.”</p>
<p>Sophia held her chin high and was in a good mood. She now possesses two cards with game-changing potential. If one were to fall, the empress would be cast into the abyss, while the other would bring the crown prince to disaster.</p>
<p>“Ferrol, as the Viscount, I’ve changed significantly from the past.”</p>
<p>“The same applies to me.”</p>
<p>In exchange for a task done with Milady, Sophia earned a substantial sum of money. It was sufficient to purchase nearby estates and homes. But Sofia used the money to buy beautiful clothing and jewelry and to gamble in a casino. The first taste of a wealthy man’s lifestyle left her tongue aching.</p>
<p>When she regained her wits, she realized.</p>
<p>Sophia would have been in serious trouble if she hadn’t met Shylo at that time. By establishing an orphanage with his assistance, she made a comfortable living.</p>
<p>She did not visit this location because she liked it.</p>
<p>She probably would have never visited the capital if nothing had gone wrong. She was hesitant to meet the empress, but there was a person present with whom she should never make eye contact.</p>
<p>“I must immediately leave because I’m busy. Please send someone to the given address, which I will provide. “I believe gold coins are superior to jewelry.”</p>
<p>“It’s amazing.”</p>
<p>When Sofia vanished, Milady flipped her finger in the air. Her small movement unlocked the concealed door in the wall, and a man of above-average height appeared. The masked man kneeled before Milady.</p>
<p>“A dog that attempts to attack its owner’s hand should be punished.”</p>
<p>The man bowed softly before exiting through the door that had reopened.</p>
