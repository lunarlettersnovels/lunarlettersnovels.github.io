            <p>“How can you not recognize me?” Freya uttered a shrill voice.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God,” Archer scratched his head, and the two facing each other burst into laughter. Freya, clutching her stomach, spoke as she looked at his unfamiliar face.</p>
<p>“How old are you, Archer? I thought you were over forty!”</p>
<p>Archer, who had a shaggy beard and was not well-decorated, looked old. “You little rascal! Stop messing with a gentleman who is not even thirty!” Archer, who was very angry at her words, shouted.</p>
<p>“Why have you been such a mess so far, Archer?”</p>
<p>Hero also examined Archer’s appearance, wondering if his change was strange.</p>
<p>“That’s because I’m too lazy to trim my beard,” Archer answered.</p>
<p>When Freya uttered a disgruntled voice, Archer glanced at her and spoke.</p>
<p>“Who would recognize you now?”</p>
<p>“That’s…!”</p>
<p>Freya was angry, but she couldn’t say anything because it was true. As she puffed up her cheeks, Archer spoke to her with a happy face.</p>
<p>“Look at that. Don’t you look good in a dress?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Flushed with sudden praise, Freya turned her head sharply.</p>
<p>“By the way, Freya, what do you do in the palace? I’m sure you are not a maid in that  dress.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s…”</p>
<p>It was a natural question for Archer, who knew nothing yet. When asked by him, Freya carefully opened her mouth as she grabbed the front hem of the dress.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m His Highness Lucius-”</p>
<p>But Freya couldn’t finish her words.</p>
<p><em>It’s not true, but I’m ashamed to say it.</em></p>
<p>Hero, who was picking up the tea, spoke for her.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua will soon be engaged to his Highness.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by getting engaged to your Highness?” said Archer with his wide-eyed.</p>
<p>He seemed skeptical when he heard it.</p>
<p>“It’s not that surprising, for this is all to help his Highness.”</p>
<p>Freya added a very brief explanation.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! Freya!”</p>
<p>Archer, who had heard what she had to say, looked at her profoundly moving eyes.</p>
<p>“You have at last pledged your allegiance to your Highness!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by oath? That’s just what happened.”</p>
<p>It reminded Freya of the moment she had wanted to jump out of the palace window for the past month but gave up thinking about her debt.</p>
<p>“By the way, do something about the way you said.”</p>
<p>Freya went mad with the awkwardness of Archer, who had a young man’s face. Gemini, watching their conversation, looked through the papers silently, and Hero grinned.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Your chin is always raised, and your eyelashes fall, but your eyes should never look down –”</p>
<p>These were a few of a series of boring etiquette lessons. Freya lowered her eyelashes, but her eyes were full of sarcasm. She began to think about something else in her head.</p>
<p><em>After class, should I go to Archer and eat chicken legs?</em></p>
<p>At the end of the lesson, she was dancing with joy, and suddenly Mrs. Francesca’s words awoke her mind.</p>
<p>“Today, the Empress invited you to the tea-time.”</p>
<p>Freya could have escaped from here in a little while, but….</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<p>Freya shuddered as she remembered the Empress, who had a frightening face in her dream.</p>
<p><em>What if I go and make a mistake?</em></p>
<p>“I shouldn’t refuse her invitation, should I?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Isn’t it an honor for the Empress to call you personally?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. It’s an honor.”</p>
<p>Freya, who was smiling awkwardly, secretly broke into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>“In this case, let’s go to the Queen and try not to speak as much as possible.” Francesca reminded her.</p>
<p>The Empress Palace had exceptional boundaries from the entrance. The guard who stood in the corridor to the door stood a tight guard as if a war had just broken out. A soldier with an unnamed weapon with a round iron on both sides was wearing a black mask, starting with a spear that seemed to kill him instantly.</p>
<p><em>I can’t even pick a bone if I try to break into the Imperial Palace.</em></p>
<p>Freya’s throat was cold as she was swallowing her saliva with tension.</p>
