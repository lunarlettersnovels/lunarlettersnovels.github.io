<div class="sc-iCfMLu bZHFRR">Lucius, who was very excited, took a long deep breath and organized what he had to say.</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="sc-1sp3zau-0 jaefFT sc-1di2uql-0 tiegV" data-tag="post-content">
<p><em>It’s crazy.</em></p>
<p>He didn’t mean to do this.</p>
<p>After finishing his daily routine, he sometimes secretly came to watch Freya’s class. She often made mistakes, as if the dance were difficult.</p>
<p><em>But even so, she’s so cute.</em></p>
<p>When he watched Freya smiling while clumsily stepping on her foot or stuttering, Lucius felt like the fatigue of the day was relieved.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing that’s going on, it was that the person who taught the dance was an excessively young man.</p>
<p><em>That’s absolutely a no-no.</em></p>
<p>Lucius, meanwhile, washes his face dry as he sees Freya. Somehow he was reluctant to make his proposal. The story he wanted to talk about wasn’t this kind of thing.</p>
<p>“Lucius Morsiani, wake up.”</p>
<p>He is still confronting his enemies.</p>
<p>If he exposes his weakness, not only he but also Freya will become in danger.</p>
<p><em>She and my work are a secret.</em></p>
<p>In addition, it was clear that he would not be able to handle it if he spoke of his confused mind now.</p>
<p>“Freya, Freya.”</p>
<p>Lucius called out her name to himself.</p>
<p>When Lucius met Freya at the orphanage, he was sixteen years old. He must have looked like a little boy just past her age. It looked like that, but it was old enough to wake up to reason.</p>
<p><em>I didn’t know that.</em></p>
<p>Like the grass that bloomed in a very barren environment, the two of them relied on each other there.</p>
<p><em>It was nice to be together.</em></p>
<p>The feeling was the same up to now.</p>
<p>Even if Freya got angry and pushed him away, it was good to be with her.</p>
<p>After struggling to grind his dizzy heart, he spoke as coldly as possible.</p>
<p>“Stop giving up. We are having a dance before the engagement ball.”</p>
<p>“Who’s getting engaged?”</p>
<p>Lucius, reaching out to her, stared at Freya. Only then was Freya surprised to realize that the main characters of the engagement were her and Lucius.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! It’s just a play. Why are you having an engagement ceremony?”</p>
<p>“I don’t do it carelessly. Hurry up and grab my hand.”</p>
<p>A faint sound of pain leaked between Freya’s lips as she tried to get up with Lucius’ hand. She felt a strong pain in her ankle.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I think I sprained my ankle.”</p>
<p>Freya hated being sick, but it wasn’t bad to think that she could avoid dancing with Lucius. Freya smiled awkwardly as she pressed her hands on her legs. Lucius’ thick eyebrows flinched as he looked at it.</p>
<p>“I can’t.”</p>
<p>Lucius called the maid who was passing straight by.</p>
<p>“Here, take Miss De Bua to her bedroom, and let the doctor see her.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I’ll go first.”</p>
<p>Two maids came to help Freya and soon moved away from his sight. Lucius opened his clenched fist weakly.</p>
<p>Lucius wanted to hug her right away and take her to the room. But now he is neither too close nor too far from his fiance. Milady’s eyes will be everywhere watching him.</p>
<p>His face was distorted when he stood still at the wall.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A man was alone in the dim bedroom. The only sound of glass occasionally hitting the table or sipping a drink was heard. Hart heaved a long sigh.</p>
<p>“I can’t stand a moment in my sober mind.”</p>
<p>With a faint smile, he took the glass back to his mouth. At the age of 20, he was one year younger than the crown prince, Lucius.</p>
<p><em>But I liked it anyway.</em></p>
<p>Because he had a beautiful, loving mother and a man with blond hair who sometimes came to see her.</p>
<p><em>Baby, I’ll let you see your father soon.</em></p>
<p>His mother often said this, and Hart just smiled. With red cilantro hair and chubby cheeks, he was really cute and innocent.</p>
<p><em>I’m about to kick the girl out!</em></p>
<p>His mother’s eyes and voice changed little by little.</p>
<p>If he wasn’t a delicate child, it would probably be hard to notice. His mother often cursed someone. Young Hart didn’t know who the target was or why she had to curse.</p>
<p>He feels like something bad is going to happen.</p>
<p>Just like the sky as it turns black before it rains.</p>
<p>From some time on, Milady cursed someone instead of a lullaby. And at the end of the long curse, she murmured like a habit.</p>
<p><em>Baby, this whole thing is for you.</em></p>
<p>His mother became increasingly hysterical. Hart was too concerned about such a mother. Then they left their small house and came to the palace.</p>
<p><em>Hart, this is our home now.</em></p>
<p><em>My house is here?</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, Prince Hart.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a castle and a big house, and Hart became a prince. Hart was unfamiliar with this place, but he was very happy to see the man who occasionally found their hat every day.</p>
<p>In addition, the identity of the man has been revealed.</p>
<p><em>He was my dad!</em></p>
<p>Besides, he’s the emperor of Morsiani.</p>
<p>Excited with joy, Hart wandered from place to place in his new palace. Then, he happened to see his peers and showed interest.</p>
<p><em>Mother, who is he?</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, never mind him.</em></p>
<p>His mother glared at the blond blue-eyed boy.</p>
<p><em>Why is she telling me not to care?</em></p>
<p>At first sight, the boy muttered to himself who was quite fond of Hart. Having been sick frequently since childhood, he had no chance to make friends.</p>
<p><em>It would be nice to be friends…</em></p>
<p>But the two never became friends.</p>
<p>One day, Hart was shocked to hear a story of maids talking. The blonde boy he saw the other day was Lucius Morsiani, the heir to the imperial family and his half-brother.</p>
<p><em>He’s my brother……?</em></p>
<p>So it was he who was born into an affair.</p>
<p>The following story was more shocking and almost made Hart vomit.</p>
<p>She kicked Lucius’ mother out of the palace.</p>
<p>Milady had no hesitation in becoming a vicious face to come here. Hart’s happiness was built on someone’s tears.</p>
<p>Milady pretended to embrace Lucius in public. Now that Hart knows who his mother’s curse is, it’s hard to watch. Fifteen hearts were never young.</p>
<p><em>My mother hates my brother.</em></p>
