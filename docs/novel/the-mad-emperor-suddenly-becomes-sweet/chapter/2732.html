        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“Oh….”</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go out?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You’re from Del Mundo, aren’t you? Is it a free place?”</p>
<p>Freya, who had no idea of Del Mundo’s atmosphere, just nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Come here. There’s a hole I dug.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p><em>What does he mean, a frog?</em></p>
<p>Freya tilted her head at something she had never expected.</p>
<p><em>Why is the Prince sneaking out?</em></p>
<p>When he cleared the bushes he had covered with his hands, a hole was revealed enough to pass by if he bent over.</p>
<p>“Come here.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s…….”</p>
<p>At Prince Hart’s gesture, Freya hesitated. Freya knew better that’s why she followed him.</p>
<p><em>I wanted to go out and look around, too.</em></p>
<p>Besides, wouldn’t it be less dangerous to be with a Prince, not with someone else? While her thoughts were busy wandering, the prince disappeared.</p>
<p>“Oh…! Wait a minute.”Freya chased him through the hole in a muddle.</p>
<p>“Now, let’s have something to cover your dress. It’s troublesome when you’re seen.”</p>
<p>Hart handed over a cape taken out of a box hidden outside the hole.</p>
<p>It’s not something Freya did before. She wore her cape deeply and walked along the waterway with him. The floor was muddy, and a gutter rat squeaked by near the ankle.</p>
<p>“Surprised.” The Prince exclaimed.</p>
<p>Freya wonders how many times she was surprised by him.</p>
<p>Soon a bright light came out and a street crowded with people came out.</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>It was Freya’s first time seeing the proper appearance of the capital since she entered the palace. Everyone looked sophisticated and joyful.</p>
<p>“Should I fill your stomach?”</p>
<p>Hart led her to a place where meat and vegetables were stuffed between pieces of bread and sold.</p>
<p>“It’s called meat bread and it’s the most popular these days.”</p>
<p>When he handed over the money with a familiar feeling, the merchant immediately began to make meat bread. After baking a wide bread, put lettuce and onion on it, then thinly sliced meat and finished it with bread.</p>
<p>“Here, try it.”</p>
<p>Freya was the first to eat something on the street, so she only looked at it for a long time even after holding the bread.</p>
<p>“You’ve never eaten street food?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s my first time.”</p>
<p>It’s not that Freya hasn’t tried it because she’s an aristocratic lady.</p>
<p>Mumbling inside, she immediately took a bite of the bread.</p>
<p>“Wow! What is this?”</p>
<p>Freya burst into admiration. The moderately seasoned meat and vegetables and the savory, coarse-textured bread were incredibly harmonious.</p>
<p>“It’s delicious.”</p>
<p>“It’s a taste that you can’t find in the palace.”</p>
<p>Sweet sauce flowed through the mouths of two people standing side by side. Freya kept biting the bread, licking the sauce with her tongue.</p>
<p>“It’s really good.”’</p>
<p>Freya ate the bread hard and looked at Hart secretly.</p>
<p>“Here’s one more, master. Would you like another one?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She had already finished one bread and looked blankly at him ordering something new. The place looks very familiar.</p>
<p>“I’m thirsty. If you go here, there’s a place that makes great lemonade.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes…?”</p>
<p>The lemonade in the stall, which was led by him, was moderately sweet and sour, leaving her stomach wide open. After filling her stomach, he led Freya to a place with an unusual sign. She made a low noise and read the words on the sign.</p>
<p>“A store that has everything except the ones that don’t have it.”</p>
<p>“It sells everything in the world. I’m just looking around for a while.”</p>
<p>“Really?</p>
<p>Prince Hart disappeared without her time to hold him, and Freya was left alone.</p>
<p>“I’m out of my mind.”</p>
<p>A tired voice crept from her mouth. Freya was tired because she filled her stomach too much after being dragged around.</p>
<p>“By the way, where am I?”</p>
<p>Freya, who stretched, looked around. Unlike ordinary stores, strange-looking props were just kicked in their feet.</p>
<p>“Is that real?”</p>
<p>Freya, opened her eyes wide and peered intently at what was displayed on the glass shelf. The upper body is human, and the lower body is made up of fish. It felt rather creepy, but she only shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of fun stuff.”</p>
<p>More bizarre things came out as she walked along the winding passage. Some frames collected butterflies hanging from the ceiling, and there were many portraits of someone.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of daggers, too.”</p>
<p>Interested in this area, she took a close look at the things neatly placed under the display.</p>
<p>“If I have money, I want something with jewels like that.”</p>
<p>Where there were a lot of books, she suddenly thought of Gemini, and where the medicine bottle was placed, Freya thought of Hero.</p>
<p><em>I’ll have to buy some presents when I get the money later.</em></p>
<p>Looking around looking for something suitable for Archer, Freya’s eyes stayed on the gloves with blue jewels. Freya thought of someone unconsciously as she watched it. It refers to the appearance of a large, hard hand sweeping over the blond hair or holding a teacup.</p>
<p><em>Crazy. Why am I thinking about Lucius?</em></p>
<p>Surprised, she shook her head and walked past it. Going in a little bit more, there were a lot of antiques on display. Her writing skills are much better than they used to be, so she can easily read the words written underneath the article.</p>
<p>“Nulitas’ gown.”</p>
<p>It was the first time Freya heard the name, she tilted her head and looked at the next item.</p>
<p>“Gelda’s whip.”</p>
<p>It was also a stranger.</p>
<p>“Is it famous?”</p>
<p>Freya was about to get tired of looking at the novelty. As she was trying to find the entrance around the corner, she heard someone moaning somewhere.</p>
<p><em>It is the sound of pain.</em></p>
<p>Freya hurried to visit the place, and a middle-aged gentleman collapsed under the bookshelf, clutching his chest.</p>
<p>“Are you all right? I’ll call someone.”</p>
<p>Frayah’s bewildered voice filled the narrow aisle.</p>
<p>At that time, the gentleman, who was shaking his fingers, struggled to open his mouth.</p>
<p>“I need to take medicine.”</p>
<p>“Where is the medicine?”</p>
<p>The gentleman pointed his finger at the cane, and Freya asked back urgently.</p>
<p>“Do you have medicine in your stick?”</p>
