            <p>From the outside, the drawing room of a Ferole artist appeared to be large and quite wealthy. Shilo, deeply buried on the sofa, breathed out long, thick cigarette smoke as he spoke with Sophia. The wallpaper was old and showed signs of wear, with gaps in places and portraits of unfamiliar characters hanging on the walls.</p>
<p>“That’s what happened,” Shilo told Sophia.</p>
<p>“I can’t help but admire you, Mr. Shilo,” Sophia whispered, leaning her cheek against his lap on the sofa. They had known each other for nearly twenty years. Sophia, now an adult, was quite beautiful and lively. It was Shilo who saved her when she was in crisis after losing all her money at the gambling house.</p>
<p>Sophia, who had no family members to turn to, followed Shilo and became his lover. However, as her youth faded, her affection for him cooled. Despite this, she clung to Shilo and ended up running an orphanage. Shilo appeared to be an ordinary merchant on the surface but was actually a dangerous individual who would do anything for the right price. Sophia never revealed her secret during her time by his side.</p>
<p>“It’s a card that you have to use only at the last minute,” Shilo told Sophia when she returned to him after a period of absence. She had left him after failing in her work, but the situation was not good for Shilo either. Despite buying an aristocratic title, his reputation remained unchanged, and the money he had invested was gone after a ship carrying his goods sank in a storm.</p>
<p>“If I help him at this time, I won’t give up for the rest of my life,” Sophia thought to herself as she confessed a secret she had kept for the empress. Upon hearing this, Shilo presented her with two options, both of which carried high risks but promised a guaranteed sum of money.</p>
<p>When Sophia informed him that she would be visiting the empress, she was advised by him to ensure that the empress is on her side, or they risk facing the enemy.</p>
<p>“The empress has indeed sent a lavish gift to the household,” Sophia remarked, referring to the man who arrived at the specified address instead of a wagon filled with gold. The dangerous job was only accomplished for the price of silence and not for the money, which left Sophia’s eyes bloodshot.</p>
<p>“Who was at the house?” Sophia asked.</p>
<p>Thinking that the identity of Sophia’s body may not be recognized, she took a look-alike to the location as a precaution. In such a case, it was helpful to have a child with similar features taken care of separately.</p>
<p>“You have a sharp mind,” Shilo praised Sophia, who raised her head with a radiant smile.</p>
<p>“Now it’s your turn, Prince,” Sophia said.</p>
<p>“He’s in a position where he can’t refuse,” replied Shilo, who would soon receive a grand castle and a piece of land as a reward.</p>
<p>“Of course, that’s just the beginning. After working hard to raise that young thing, it’s only fair to receive this much reward,” Shilo added.</p>
<p>“Exactly. We’re like his parents,” said Sophia, who started caressing the man’s thigh as she spoke. Her affection for the man, whom she initially thought would bring her a lot of money, seemed to arise unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“The Viscount Ferrol,” said Shilo.</p>
<p>“Oh, my! Stop teasing me,” Sophia replied, giggling.</p>
<p>The two were in a plain drawing room with no staff, but their eyes were full of passion.</p>
<p>Lucius quickly recovered with the help of heroin. He longed to have a private conversation with Freya, but it was impossible due to Hart Morsiani and Selena Edelion’s upcoming engagement hunt.</p>
<p>“It’s quite extravagant,” Lucius commented as he dressed up to attend the hunting competition, with Hero grumbling beside him. The engagement was larger than the crown prince’s, which seemed absurd to Hero.</p>
<p>“It’s disheartening that not a single noble have voiced their dissent.”</p>
<p>“Most of them are indifferent to who becomes the next emperor, Hero.”</p>
<p>Lucius’ eyes, once sharp but now gaunt, shone with a cool gleam.</p>
<p>“That’s why we must concentrate on our enemies,” he said.</p>
<p>Hero, who had noticed a change in Lucius and Freya lately, hesitated to speak.</p>
<p>“What are you hesitating about, Hero? Isn’t that the greatest wizard in the world?”</p>
<p>“It’s about Miss De Bua,” Hero replied.</p>
<p>He wondered if he should bring up the incident where he helped rescue her friend but decided against it. Lucius was unaware of the situation. Instead, Hero chose to broach a different topic.</p>
<p>“What are your plans after the deadline?” he asked.</p>
<p>Hero still supported the union between Lucius and Selena and believed that this was not the time to question who was more virtuous.</p>
<p>“Because you are the rightful heir and the hope of the Morciani Empire,” he added.</p>
