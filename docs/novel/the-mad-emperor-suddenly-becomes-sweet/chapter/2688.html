            <div class="stackable mb-xs">
<div class="sc-hiCibw hwnkdv">The silver-haired man was rummaging through a magic book in the dark underground of the Imperial Palace when someone emerged from the stairs. A figure, covered in a red gown, approached the man, who was identified as Michael and made a strange noise by scouring the end of the table with their long red nails. Michael glanced at the visitor and closed the book he was reading.</div>
</div>
<div class="sc-hzuobC eIfgWu sc-inrDdN fOExfD" data-tag="post-content">“Hello.”<p></p>
<p>The man politely prepared a ceremony with his hands together, and the opponent pulled back the cap of the cloak that covered their face. Milady’s splendid features were revealed in the dim light. She poked Michael’s forearm with her fingernails and opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Michael, when does the emperor die?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a problem if you die now?”</p>
<p>Milady laughed as she leaned back at his words.</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>After Lucius died, the order in which the emperor died had to be determined. The moment was something Michael had been waiting for so long that he sometimes became impatient. The empress spilled her red gown on the floor.</p>
<p>“I can proudly call you to my bedroom only if the emperor dies quickly…”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty the Empress. That day will come soon.”</p>
<p>Michael smiled faintly at her words. In fact, there were no personal feelings toward the empress. The empress was the daughter of the gypsy who raised Michael. The gypsy was dead, and the empress owed a debt of grace to Michael, which he would repay at the risk of his life.</p>
<p>“Yeah. How’s the girl’s work going?”</p>
<p>“I’ve changed the method a little bit.”</p>
<p>“Without telling me……?”</p>
<p>The queen looked puzzled, as this was the first time Michael did not follow her orders. He quickly hugged the queen’s back and whispered softly.</p>
<p>“I thought it would be okay because it was a more miserable and terrible way. Please punish the dog for violating his master’s order.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my God. A more miserable and terrible way. You always make me happy, Michael.”</p>
<p>The empress was smiling satisfactorily at Michael’s words, flicking her nails. Michael, watching her reaction, was insensitive. The reason for changing the method was not solely what he told her.</p>
<p>“It’s okay if the plan goes right.”</p>
<p>Michael wondered if it was necessary to destroy Freya,, the little green-eyed person. One reason was to avoid being tempted by him, but it wasn’t impossible to use that kind of spell.</p>
<p><em>As expected, I don’t feel like it.</em></p>
<p>Michael’s mind was changed by an image he saw one day. The appearance of Freya giving bread to a child who seemed to be happy and taking off her cape was not fabricated. After struggling with hunger on the street, Michael felt the sincerity in Freya’s actions.</p>
<p>It was not an act of mercy, but rather noble.</p>
<p>Michael smiled faintly as he looked down at Milady, who was becoming increasingly heated.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, please destroy me.”</p>
<p>He went straight to bed and knelt down, and the shadow of the empress filled a corner of the room.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>Miriam brought a bowl of porridge to Freya, who was lying motionless on the bed.</p>
<p>“Is it really alright if I don’t call a doctor? It must have been a tough time for you, with the fever and all,” Miriam said.</p>
<p>“I think I should just rest well until morning. That should be enough,” Freya replied.</p>
<p>It was crucial to go save Lottie, and Freya had only confided in Archer and Hero about it. After feeling unwell earlier, Freya went back to the bedroom to rest, and Miriam left the room. Freya woke up later, kicking and whining about the blanket.</p>
<p>“I was so close to dying from frustration,” Freya said.</p>
<p>When Freya rolled up her sleeves, the wound from wielding a dagger was still visible on her hand. The blood had stopped flowing, but a fishy smell still lingered in the room.</p>
<p>“The smell of sweat is suffocating me,” Freya said.</p>
<p>Although Freya had succeeded in her mission, the nervousness had left her whole body aching. Then she remembered the small hot spring behind the Crown Prince’s Palace.</p>
<p>“He said I could use it anytime,” Freya said, remembering the words.</p>
<p>With Lucius not in the palace, Freya had no chance of running into him. It was better to use the hot spring secretly, as it was something she had snuck out to do.</p>
<p>Freya covered herself with her cloak and slipped outside, bringing some clothes to change into. If she passed the short hallway behind the palace, she would reach a small forest. And if she went through there, she would find the hot spring.</p>
<p>“It was really there,” Freya thought.</p>
<p>The steam from the hot spring was foggy, and the bubbling water was amazing. Freya leaned over and dipped a finger into it.</p>
<p>“It’s really warm,” Freya said.</p>
<p>She took off her cloak and changed into a chemise. After looking around once more, Freya saw that there was nothing but small trees and grass blowing in the wind. She slowly entered the hot spring and settled down, letting out a sigh. Just sitting down made her feel like half of her fatigue had been relieved.</p>
<p>“It’s the best. Really,” Freya said.</p>
<p>She stretched out her wounded hand and poured hot water over it with one hand. It was difficult, so she leaned back and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>“By the way, did Lottie arrive safely?” Freya asked, feeling emotional again when she thought about earlier events. She knew that sitting in tears or wallowing wouldn’t solve anything.</p>
<p>“I will never cry. There’s still so much work to be done,” Freya thought, determined to stay strong.</p>
<p>She couldn’t afford to collapse before it was all done.</p>
<p>Just then, she heard footsteps brushing over the grass. She froze, surprised, and shrunk her neck. Someone must be standing there, looking at her back.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t…,” Freya thought, her heart racing.</p>
<p>She usually covered her hair with her long locks, but today she had put her hair up, making her flesh clearly visible through the wet chemise. Freya was too afraid to look back and instead covered herself with one hand.</p>
<p>“What is it? It’s…,” Freya stammered, her lips pressed tightly together at the familiar voice.</p>
<p>There were traces on her back that she didn’t want to show anyone.</p>
<p><em>You’re there that I don’t want to show you the most.</em></p>
