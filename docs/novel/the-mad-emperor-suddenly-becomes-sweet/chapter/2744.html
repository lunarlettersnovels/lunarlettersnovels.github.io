            <p>Freya couldn’t stand the feeling of a wide, long green dress touching her ankle.</p>
<p><em>You can’t take a step out of this way.</em></p>
<p>If Archer saw her, he would probably laugh because she looks like a boy in a dress. Freya, whose cheeks were hot, was restless, then Hero appeared in the room again.</p>
<p>“Gracious! Miss Freya De Bua!” Hero who was changing into a white robe embroidered with gold thread, couldn’t speak properly.</p>
<p>Freya blushed at his reaction.</p>
<p>“It must look ridiculous!” She raised her hand out of embarrassment and tried to erase what was applied to her lips.</p>
<p>“Don’t do that.”</p>
<p>“But it’s weird.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. It suits you very well.”</p>
<p>“No way.” Not believing Hero’s words, she blurted the end of her words and he spoke off.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to your highness first. Come on.” Hero, who came close to her, reached out one arm. Freya grabbed his arm without a clue what would happen. Her fingertips trembled slightly.</p>
<p>She tried not to look as awkward as possible, but her eyes kept turning because it was so bright everywhere. It was her first time seeing such a colorful building and walking on a soft carpet.</p>
<p>“Hero, can you walk a little slower?”</p>
<p>The end of the long dress she wore for the first time was constantly wrapped around her ankle and almost fell.</p>
<p>“By the way, where are we going right now?”</p>
<p>“We’re on our way to meet someone.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>She just came to the palace, and now Hero’s telling her she would meet someone? Freya’s face turned pale in an instant. If it was a palace, there would surely be crowds of nobles and imperial families, the thought of it made her feel nauseous.</p>
<p>“But I’m not ready for anything yet.”</p>
<p>When she cried, Hero continued with a slightly nervous face.</p>
<p>“The place we’re going now is no different from the battlefield.” However, you only have to remember that you are Freya De Bua.”</p>
<p>Freya nodded, and they suddenly stopped in front of an incredibly large door. The guard who was guarding the door pulled out the spear, and when the servant pushed the door, someone made a loud noise.</p>
<p>“Hero Elymus, the Great Wizard.”</p>
<p>Freya keeps blinking her eyes because of the pouring light. Hero’s appearance seemed to draw attention for a while, but soon the lights focused on the left-center where the emperor was seated.</p>
<p><em>Oh my gosh! Am I in front of the emperor right now?</em></p>
<p>Freya, who had never thought of meeting the emperor in her whole life, was suddenly become nervous. She wanted to run away through the open door.</p>
<p><em>What? When did I sit here?</em></p>
<p>When Freya came to her senses, she was already sitting stiffly next to Hero.</p>
<p><em>What am I doing here?</em></p>
<p>Questions kept pouring into her mind, but she couldn’t open her mouth carelessly due to the suffocating atmosphere. Stealing the sweat from her forehead, she saw someone sitting near the emperor. There was a man who was escorted by Gemini armed with armor and exuded cool energy.</p>
<p>“Your Highness Lucius…”</p>
<p>When she saw him, she was somehow relaxed.</p>
<p>He was wearing tight black pants with his long legs emphasized and a navy cape with gold wine over a white shirt. Blond hair that went back, sharp nose blades, and thin lips were revealing his sensitive nature. Dressed up splendidly, he proved to be noble from head to toe.</p>
<p><em>Why is so different from the way he looks on the battlefield?</em></p>
<p>Lucius, who was originally handsome, was more beautiful here.</p>
<p>Bam ba-a-bam!</p>
<p>When the emperor beckoned, the man next to him blew a trumpet. The wind barely allowed Freya, who was drunk on Lucius’ beauty, to come to her senses.</p>
<p>“It’s not a dream, right?”</p>
<p>She tried to sit as if nothing had happened, but she was too nervous that she felt her lower abdomen was going to twist.</p>
<p>“I guess the rumor that the disease is serious is right.” Even from a distance, the emperor’s yellow eyes stood out.</p>
<p>It was then. “Prince Lucius, the successor of the Morsiani Empire, come here.”</p>
<p>At his call, Lucius stood up and knelt under the emperor’s feet.</p>
<p>“I praise you for annihilating enemies on the periphery and protecting the empire.”</p>
<p>The emperor gave the crown prince an emerald-embedded dagger. Lucius accepted it and the people gathered at the banquet hall cheered.</p>
<p><em>But why is it so weird?</em></p>
<p>Everyone was delighted, but it was a little different from them celebrating the victory near the barracks.</p>
<p><em>I don’t think it’s for real.</em></p>
<p>Like acting.</p>
<p>She was aware of this atmosphere at once because she had lived her whole life. Squashed by the awkward and stuffy air of the banquet hall, she clenched her fist.</p>
<p>“Prince Lucius, congratulations on your victory.”</p>
<p>The empress, who came down three or four stairs dragging the hem of the dress, held Lucius’ hand. The red-haired empress was wearing a muslin dress of the same color as her hair, and several gold necklaces were hung on her neck.</p>
<p>“Thanks to the crown prince, we were all able to spend the night with confidence.”</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to protect Her Majesty.”</p>
<p>Lucius greeted politely and soon opened his mouth to the emperor.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty the Emperor,  I’ve done everything you said the other day.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>There was no one here who didn’t know what it meant. The empress mediated Lucius’ challenging attitude.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty is sick, so let’s discuss the matter quietly.”</p>
<p>Standing next to Lucius, the empress slightly bent her knee toward the emperor with her hand on her chest. It was like a loving wife who thought of her husband.</p>
