            <p>Milady Xavier, who was born the second daughter of a Korean-American self-composed family, had only one dazzling beauty. However, because she was poor, she didn’t even get a chance to use her beauty properly. After adulthood, she had the fortune to find out about the re-employment of an old man.</p>
<p><em>I will never live a life of warming up the body of an old man.</em></p>
<p>She woke up quite early in the world and forced herself into the palace as a maid. It was the result of Milady’s unspeakable efforts that allowed women from prominent families to do what they could.</p>
<p><em>This is where I’m going to stay.</em></p>
<p>Flamboyant dresses, elegant furniture, well-decorated gardens, and everything in the palace captivated Milady’s heart. At first, she decided to seduce a young aristocrat entering and leaving the palace. It would have been if she hadn’t met the emperor in the garden by chance.</p>
<p>“Did you fall?”</p>
<p>The emperor, who encountered Milady, who fell in while walking through the rain in the garden, fell in love with her at first sight. The emperor couldn’t draw attention from her in a sticky dress that revealed her moist eyes and body shape. Thus, the emperor’s heart tilted to Milady overnight.</p>
<p><em>I will give you the title of a marquis wife.</em></p>
<p>Thus, Milady had a high position, and while being the empress’ maid, she secretly built a conspiracy with the emperor.</p>
<p>There have been countless crises before reaching the top.</p>
<p><em>It wasn’t a coincidence or luck that I was standing here.</em></p>
<p>After her son Hart was born, her goal became clear. Making Hart the crown prince, before that, she had no intention of giving up this journey. However, it was impossible before Lucius died.</p>
<p><em>I won’t let anything like how to fail to hold my son’s ankle.</em></p>
<p>Milady, who struggled to escape from her past thoughts, spoke affectionately.</p>
<p>“Prince, you know the norms of our Morsiani Empire.”</p>
<p>The crown prince of the empire must be engaged to be guaranteed his legitimate position.</p>
<p>“Even so, I have someone to introduce to you today.”</p>
<p>Milady was a little nervous at Lucius’ relaxed words.</p>
<p>“How dare you brag about it?”</p>
<p>She has done her best to prevent the marriage of her successor, Lucius. Until recently, the Edelion family has been struggling, but it will not be a problem because it has made some kind of deal with Count Banderas.</p>
<p><em>“Lucius, you won’t be able to find a girl next to you in the empire.’</em></p>
<p>In high spirits again, she raised her chin, and Lucius reached out as he looked somewhere.</p>
<p>“I’ll introduce her to you, Miss De Bua from Del Mundo.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>The crowd quickly became noisy at Lucius’ words. In the Del Mundo region, it was the southernmost island in the Morsiani Empire, and in fact, there was little exchange with the capital nobleman.</p>
<p>Even then, Freya just watched the exciting scene by bouncing her finger. Your Highness is going to introduce someone today, but why does it seem everyone is so surprised?</p>
<p>“What situation is this?”</p>
<p>Although she worked hard on her brain, it was not enough for her to know the work of noble Nari.</p>
<p>“Freya, Freya.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Freya came to her senses when Hero called her name.</p>
<p>“Your Highness is calling you.”</p>
<p>“Now? Why me?”</p>
<p>It was only then that she realized that she was the one who was supposed to be introduced.</p>
<p><em>Oh my gosh! I knew this would happen.</em></p>
<p>It was no use wanting to run away from the carriage coming to the palace.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this isn’t it!”</p>
<p>Freya raised her head, and Lucius’ eyes were intertwined. She could see the desperation in his blue gaze.</p>
<p><em>But it has nothing to do with me.</em></p>
<p>Soon she turned away from Lucius’ gaze.</p>
<p>She didn’t have the guts to do such a play in front of so many people.</p>
<p>“Your Highness Lucius, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Freya decided to pretend not to know the situation with her head down.</p>
<p><em>It’s best not to be involved in the work of the nobles.</em></p>
<p>When Freya, who had been ignoring him the whole time, looked up, she made eye contact with Lucius, who was still looking in her way.</p>
<p><em>What’s with those eyes?</em></p>
<p>If it was a high-pressure feeling, Freya would have turned her head right away. But the figure of Lucius now was like her before, one face that seemed lonely among many people. Enchanted by the gaze, she raised herself with her armrest.</p>
<p><em>What the heck. Why does he look like a puppy in the rain?</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t long before her legs shook as she walked on the red carpet.</p>
<p><em>This must be crazy.</em></p>
<p>Freya was sure she’d regret it later. She stared at her opponent who was reaching out to her.</p>
<p><em>This is all because of your threats.</em></p>
<p>She reiterated that it was never something she wanted to do.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>The moment they held hands, a voice small enough to be heard only by her flowed from Lucius’ mouth.</p>
<p><em>I knew you’d say hello like that.</em></p>
<p>The grabbed hand soon got tangled, and tremors were transmitted through thin gloves. Freya opened her eyes wide as she feel her hand’s strong vibration. She wasn’t the only one shaking.</p>
<p><em>“Your Highness, Lucius, is shaking too?</em></p>
<p>She put a little force on her hand.</p>
<p><em>Being confident anywhere suits him better.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps reading Freya’s mind, the tremors surrounding the two soon subsided.</p>
