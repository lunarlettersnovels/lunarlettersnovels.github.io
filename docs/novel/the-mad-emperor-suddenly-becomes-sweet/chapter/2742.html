            <p>“So, who is she?”</p>
<p>The empress raised her chin and gave Freya a sharp look. Freya stood in a hurry, grabbed the dress awkwardly, and bowed her head.</p>
<p>“Hello, I’m Freya de Bua from Del Mundo.”</p>
<p>The empress pretended to have heard a greeting and then chined up again.</p>
<p>“So, who is it?” The empress turned her gaze to Lucius.</p>
<p>“She’s the one I am currently seeing,” Lucius answered.</p>
<p>Milady bit her lips tightly at his words and scanned Freya’s whole body.</p>
<p>“I heard that if it’s Del Mundo, barbarians lived there.”</p>
<p>Lucius briefly flinched at the empress’ words.</p>
<p>“You’re going to ignore Freya and me at the same time?”</p>
<p>If he moves according to the opponent’s will, Lucius will lose.</p>
<p>“I think I’ve met the right partner.”</p>
<p>Lucius acted sly as he raised his eyes. In a way, it seemed like a joke between a harmonious hat, but the banquet hall atmosphere seemed to be walking on thin ice.</p>
<p>“On top of that, doesn’t it matter where my fiancee, who will soon be the empress, came from?”</p>
<p>Milady’s face heated up with what Lucius added. That cheeky fellow must openly mock her that she is the illegitimate child of a noble family. She smiled affectionately to avoid this conversation quickly.</p>
<p>“I agree that the true hearts of the two are important, just like the relationship between his Majesty and me.”</p>
<p>After watching the conversation between the two, Freya trembled in the cold air of the empress. She and the empress saw for the first time felt like she was going to make a hole in her chest just with her gaze.</p>
<p><em>What is it? Why is she so scary?</em></p>
<p>The disregard for being a savage was nothing. Freya heard a lot of things already. First of all, the important thing is to get out of this situation. Freya who is determined firmly gave her stomach a lot of strength and she smiled naturally.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty! Empress! Please take good care of us!”</p>
<p>All the nobles who gathered at the banquet hall became contemplated at a powerful greeting that would not even be a gardener of the palace.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen such an undignified lady like that.”</p>
<p>“Oh my god, how can that be?”</p>
<p>Soon, the nobles murmured, and Milady also made an impression as if she had seen something he would not see. Lucius was the only one who smiled at Freya.</p>
<p>“Ms. de Bua, nice to meet you. Let’s say goodbye here for now.”</p>
<p>The empress, who barely managed to put on an absurd look, announced the start of the banquet.</p>
<p>Soon after, Muhee came out in the middle of the banquet hall and showed a delicate dance. Freya, who sat down along Lucius, shook her knees and ripped off the rubble of her fingers.</p>
<p><em>Wow, I think my heart is going to pop out to the floor.</em></p>
<p>She pretended to be confident, but she was so nervous.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Freya drank the water on the table in a hurry. Her heart palpitations showed no signs of calming down. Then Lucius bowed his head and whispered.</p>
<p>“Freya, shall we go out?”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter anyway.”</p>
<p>She heard it was a banquet for Lucius, but he wanted to go out.</p>
<p>Lucius, who held her hand with strange eyes, left the noisy banquet hall.</p>
<p>After a while, the two arrived in an ornamental garden.</p>
<p>Freya first filled her stuffy chest with cool air. She felt like she was going to buy a little now. Then, he stared intensely at Lucius.</p>
<p>“Your highness! What are you doing right now?”</p>
<p>Freya whispered very quietly in case someone would hear it.</p>
<p>Lucius, who stopped walking in her voice, reached out to the rose arch above his head. There he broke the white rose, and he smiled. Lucius slowly appreciated Freya’s dress and did not hide his admiration.</p>
<p>“The person in front of me is Freya, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s not the time to play around like that.”</p>
<p>Freya was ignorant of etiquette, but she was not tactless. As Hero said earlier, this place was as brutal as a battlefield. Despite her serious response, Lucius’ blue eyes only turned to Freya.</p>
<p>“It looks good on you.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who had friendly eyes, gently stuck a flower into the side of her ear. Her heart pounded at the touch of him. She didn’t want to admit this feeling, so she acted unevenly.</p>
<p>“Even if you don’t tease me like that, I know well that I look funny.”</p>
<p>It was bizarre to wear a noble lady for the first time in her life.</p>
<p>“Yeah. It would be better if it were a joke, Freya.”</p>
<p>Somehow, she faltered as she tried to get angry at Lucius’ strange voice.</p>
<p>“What does it mean?”</p>
<p>Freya, who was quite quick-witted and confident, could not understand the prince’s attitude for a while.</p>
<p>“Something changed.”</p>
<p>She was not particularly good to him, but she was a little more interested in him than usual.</p>
<p>“You must be used as my fiancee.”</p>
<p>She was contemplating for a long time and heard the footsteps of another person coming out of the garden.</p>
<p>“I think I should do more plays.”</p>
<p>Even before Freya could answer, his hand hugged his back. As a result of the rebound, she naturally put her forehead on Lucius’ hard chest.</p>
<p>“It’s falling off right now.”</p>
<p>“Hold on. Stay like this for a second.”</p>
<p>Lucius whispered, who tightened her struggling body more intensely.</p>
<p>“It’s easy for people to misunderstand.”‘</p>
<p>Freya has never been interested in anybody before. She never went dating. But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t know what dating was. When she begged on the street, she saw and heard more than she thought.</p>
<p><em>My beloved lover made friendly eye contact and held hands tightly.</em></p>
<p>When his hot breath tickled Freya’s forehead, she could recall the night she wanted to forget. The texture of the lips I put on to cover Lucius’ mouth was vivid again.</p>
<p><em>Crazy. Why are you thinking about that now?</em></p>
<p>Freya felt like it would be weirder if she didn’t move away from him. She turned stronger and met a pair of blue eyes looking down at her.</p>
<p>“What? Why do you look at me like that?”</p>
<p>The two staring at each other under the arch were buried in a white rose.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>The maid, who was trying to stop the empress, sweated hard. Milady screamed in response. After returning from the banquet, the empress’ palace was turned upside down. Milady threw things as soon as she could. The necklace was loosened, the pieces of jewelry were scattered, the vase was broken, and water was splashed everywhere.</p>
<p>Milady was anxious that what she had worked hard on would go wrong.</p>
<p>“We were almost there..!” she screamed.</p>
<p>Prince Lucius returned alive and sound with all the cheers of the people on their backs. And that wasn’t all. She brought a girl with him, saying that they were engaged.</p>
<p>“Did you see that woman earlier?”</p>
<p>It was a barbarian-like woman who was not worthy of the imperial family of Morciani. She hurriedly put on her hair and makeup and dressed up in a nightgown, but she couldn’t avoid her eyes.</p>
<p>“Who recognizes the aristocrats in Del Mundo?”</p>
<p>At Milady’s evil words, a middle-aged maid approached and wrapped a cloth around her bloody hand.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty. That’s not what’s important right now.”</p>
<p>“Yes. That man who never dies is the problem.”</p>
<p>The empress was trying to cool her mind.</p>
<p>“It’s like I’m almost close to my goal. We have to deal with things somehow before the emperor dies.”</p>
<p>The emperor was so weak that it would not be strange if he died today. If he died without saying that he would change his successor, the crown goes to Lucius.</p>
<p>“I’ve been grilling so many nobles.”</p>
<p>When Milady, who was exhausted, threw herself into bed, the maids rushed in and began to massage her arms and legs. Milady, who frowned a lot on her fine forehead, jumped up and sat, shaking off the maid’s touch as if it were annoying.</p>
<p>“Hart, did Hart come back?”</p>
<p>She pressed her temple with her fingertips to ease her headache that was gathering again at the thought of her son.</p>
<p>“I was so desperate, and he is not even on my side?”</p>
<p>On the day when a lot of nobles gathered like today, she had to attend unconditionally. However, Hart didn’t even show his nose to Lucius’ victory banquet today.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, his Majesty Hart came…”</p>
<p>“Tell him to come here right now.”</p>
<p>After a while, a man appeared staggering. The tall man swept a lot of cilantro hair and spoke blurry.</p>
<p>“Mother, did you find it?”</p>
<p>“Hart, oh my god! Are you hooked on alcohol?”</p>
<p>Milady was confused about the appearance of her son, the smell of strong alcohol vibrated in the room.</p>
<p>Milady quickly sat his son on the sofa as he mended. The son was very sensitive, so she was careful not to get angry. She managed to make a real voice.</p>
<p>“My beloved son, didn’t I say I’d bring you the whole world in a little while?”</p>
<p>“Mother. I’m sick and tired of that.”</p>
<p>Hart, whose eyes were relaxed at her words, shook his head hard. Milady was angry at his son’s insincere attitude.</p>
<p>“You can’t say things like that. I did everything for you.”</p>
<p>“Did someone ask you to do that, mother?</p>
<p>“…Hart!”</p>
<p>He didn’t know how hard she struggled to remove the label of resuscitation of an empress who was a former maid. Milady held his son’s hand and began to recite her efforts. Then, while listening to his mother, Hart leaned on the sofa and fell asleep.</p>
