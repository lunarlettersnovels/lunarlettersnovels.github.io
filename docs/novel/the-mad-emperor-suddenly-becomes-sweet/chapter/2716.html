<div class="sc-iCfMLu bZHFRR">“It brings great luck, it’s my gift for you,” Freya exclaimed.</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="sc-1sp3zau-0 jaefFT sc-1di2uql-0 tiegV" data-tag="post-content">
<p>“That’s so precious but I already have a lot.” Hero said.</p>
<p>Freya was glad that she has Archer, and now she got to know Hero.</p>
<p>Although it was hard in the palace, she then realized how wide the world was while experiencing various experiences.</p>
<p>“If you get more greedy, you’ll lose all your hair.”</p>
<p>Hero smirked at the sound of her muttering to herself.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you this in return.”</p>
<p>He took a small bottle out of his pocket and handed it to her. Pink pills rolled in the bottle. Freya lifted it high and then shook it lightly.</p>
<p>“The color is pretty.”</p>
<p>“If you take the medicine, you can breathe underwater for about an hour.”</p>
<p>“So I’m going to be a fish? It’s amazing!”</p>
<p>“It’s best not to use it too much at once.”</p>
<p>“Wow! Thank you so much.”</p>
<p>She suddenly screamed, holding up Hero’s present. This is because she suddenly remembered the schedule she had forgotten.</p>
<p>“I had to choose a hat or shoes today, but I forgot. I’m leaving!”</p>
<p>After the short goodbye, she lifted both ends of the dress and began to run with all her might. Hero patted his forehead with his hand as she revealed the lace under the dress.</p>
<p>“I don’t want Lucius or Francesca to see that.”</p>
<p>His palm was sticking out of a well-kept bunny glue.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Shoes, hats, and gloves were already stretched out in the room where Freya ran in a hurry. Freya hurried to the chair and sat down, smoothing her dress. After roughly stealing the sweat from her sleeve, Freya tried to relax on the chair.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon.”</p>
<p>In front of her, a man with wide trousers and a furry shirt greeted her grandly.</p>
<p>“We’ve only prepared the best products that fit Miss de Bua’s elegant taste.”</p>
<p>But Freya was not interested in the best product. What stood out from fatigue was a hat full of bird feathers.</p>
<p><em>That must be the trend.</em></p>
<p>Selena’s hair was full of that new hair ornament the other day. Recognizing her gaze, the merchant lifted it up in white gloves.</p>
<p>“It’s made from the feathers of a peacock, a local specialty of Dolores. The peacock is uniquely associated with mythology.”</p>
<p>He showed no sign of struggle with how passionate he was. Freya’s head began to throb because of the merchant who was constantly giving explanations.</p>
<p>Unable to resist, she raised her hand and opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“I’m not feeling well,  can I take a break for a while?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>After barely enduring the crying face, Freya opened the door of the bedroom connected to the drawing room.</p>
<p>“Oh, my god, I thought it would be happy to buy the things that I don’t have.”</p>
<p>It was an unachievable dream for her when she never had a loaf to buy. She used to do her chores by begging and watching people buy and sell things.</p>
<p>“But it was worse than the etiquette class.”</p>
<p>Sitting in a round chair with an armrest, Freya wiped the sweat off her forehead with the tip of her sleeve. Then she looked up and saw someone standing on the railing of the balcony that was wide open. The wind-shaking blonde hair, the familiar image, was certainly Lucius.</p>
<p>“Why are you there?”</p>
<p>Freya’s green eyes widened.</p>
<p>Freya, who jumped up, quickly opened the door connected to the balcony. When Lucius saw her, he jumped and frowned.</p>
<p>“Are you slow? I’ve been waiting for a long time.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p><em>When did he make an appointment?</em></p>
<p>Freya asked back, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>“Did you say you’d see me in the afternoon?”</p>
<p>“Are you not honored to be able to see you like this.”</p>
<p>She was already suffering from a weak headache and she was always having trouble when talking to Lucius.</p>
<p>“But why are you here?”</p>
<p>Lucius was briefly taken aback by her question.</p>
<p>His work on behalf of the emperor, who was ill, was piled up every day. He came to see Freya secretly because he thought she would be lonely even though she was busy.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?”’</p>
<p>Her tone was a little harsh. However, Lucius quickly resolved his disappointment.</p>
<p>“You can make me look at you.”</p>
<p>With a rough touch, Lucius untied the ribbon around the neck of the lace-decorated shirt.</p>
<p>“Freya, are you not happy to see me?”</p>
<p>His firm chest was slightly exposed along with the shoulder pads.</p>
<p>“Oh, no. It’s not that, but I was surprised to see you standing on the balcony railing.”</p>
<p>“So the answer is.?”</p>
<p>At his persistent question, Freya hesitated as she looked at the ribbon wrapped around his fingertips. There was no way she wasn’t curious. It was a little comfort to see him, though he had upset her or made her feel strange when he came.</p>
<p>“It’s, it’s…”</p>
<p>However, Freya shouldn’t express her feelings recklessly, it’s better not to say anything. He was meant to be Emperor of Morsiani, and she was nothing.</p>
<p>Freya bowed her head and he reached out and raised her chin. Lucius, who stared into her green eyes, whispered.</p>
<p>“Freya, I’ll allow you to welcome me.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>She froze for a moment at Lucius’s words.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Freya couldn’t guess the meaning behind Lucius’ expression or tone.</p>
<p>“And I had a hard time finding a teacher to teach you how to dance. I’ll introduce you at night.”</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<p>Who’s the new teacher, and why is he taking classes at night?</p>
<p>Lucius, who was glancing around, jumped off the high railing.</p>
<p>“I’m going to…”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, Your Highness! You can’t just leave.”</p>
<p>Her voice, which used to call Lucius, died down. Lucius’s cloak fluttered like a wing, and his shiny blond hair resembled the feathers of a bird.</p>
<p>“It’s like a bird…….”</p>
