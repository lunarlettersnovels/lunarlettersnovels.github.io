            <p>Freya brushed her neck at the word death.</p>
<p>“If the contractor breaches the contract as she cannot fulfill the duration….”</p>
<p>She felt like she was going to faint as Lucius read that part very slowly.</p>
<p>‘What happens if there’s a breach in contract.’</p>
<p>As Freya was about faint from curiosity, his red lips moved.</p>
<p>“The penalty is one hundred gold coins.”</p>
<p>“…. Pardon?”</p>
<p>Her mind turned blank when she heard the penalty for breaching the contract. So truthfully she couldn’t hear what Lucius said after.</p>
<p><em>What could I do with that?</em></p>
<p>“So, there’s a reason for both of us to carry on the contract. I’m going to the palace but there’s time left on the contract. I’m suggesting one thing….”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>She felt chilled looking at Lucius’s smile. She hit the tent’s pillar as she stepped back.</p>
<p>“Freya, it’s not all bad for you.”</p>
<p>But Freya already felt like was losing out.</p>
<p><em>I can’t keep doing this. Never!</em></p>
<p>As Freya screamed internally, Lucius leaned his hand against the pillar after stepping in front of her. Freya was locked between his arms that she couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>“If it’s something about dating, then I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>Freya shook her head vigorously as she trembled. She barely was able to do servant work but to act like a fake noble and fake girlfriend. She didn’t think she could even if there was a sword against her neck.</p>
<p>“You see. I have no intention of forcing it on you.”</p>
<p>Lucius put one arm down and stared down at her while whispering.</p>
<p>“I just have to deal with it through the means of a contract.”</p>
<p>It didn’t sound like a threat, but his words had heavyweight.</p>
<p>“I have to pay a penalty of one hundred gold coins right?”</p>
<p>“That’s it. Freya.”</p>
<p>She wouldn’t be able to pay that amount even if she begged on the street for life. If she tried to pay it off by working, it would take several years at least. So if she didn’t listen to him, the dream of buying and house and farmland was.</p>
<p><em>Just a bubble that’ll burst?</em></p>
<p>Freya, even though she didn’t want to, had no choice but to listen to the plan.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Freya sat at the corner after coming back to the tent and kept taking a deep breath. She was sitting still but her head was spinning and her hands and feet were shaking. Her neck kept losing strength and slouched.</p>
<p>“Freya, are you sleeping with your eyes open?”</p>
<p>She was able to come back to her senses after Archer’s loud voice. As Freya rubbed her eyes and looked up, Archer smiled.</p>
<p>“There’s good news.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I also have news….”</p>
<p>Archer, who roughly sat on the bed, stop drinking and speaking.</p>
<p>“Freya, I’m working under the Grand Master now. I’m no longer a mercenary.”</p>
<p>“Wow! Congratulations.”</p>
<p>Freya was truly happy that Archer’s skill was recognized.</p>
<p>“There’s wages every month and a place to stay too. So don’t you worry too much!”</p>
<p>Freya’s eyes perked at Archer’s words.</p>
<p>“….. Me?”</p>
<p>“You’d think I’d leave you here alone? I’m not that heartless.”</p>
<p>Archer hit his chest while speaking vigorously.</p>
<p>“I’ll take you and let you study, so just trust Archer from now on!”</p>
<p>Freya couldn’t hold back her tears as Archer spoke. She was so tired from such tiring work, so she was truly touched by his warm heart.</p>
<p>“Archer…..”</p>
<p>Archer became flustered and get talking as Freya looked teary.</p>
<p>“Of course, it won’t be a big house, but wouldn’t it be better than here?”</p>
<p>“Archer, thank you.”</p>
<p>For not ignoring someone like me.</p>
<p>She felt embarrassed to say it out loud so she swallowed that part.</p>
<p>“Anyways, what did you want to tell me? Are you all packed?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you a little later.”</p>
<p>Freya felt like she was going to cry so she kept spitting it out.</p>
<p>“I told you to change the way you speak.”</p>
<p>“Let me be. I lived well like this.”</p>
<p>“How are you going to date like that? Hm?”</p>
<p>Her body froze like a statue at his thoughtless words. Normally she would say she wouldn’t date even if someone paid her in gold and would laugh it off.</p>
<p><em>Ha, I don’t know.</em></p>
<p>Freya lay down and put the blanket over her head at his joke. It was because her face became bright red thinking of Lucius at the word dating.</p>
<p>“You taught you to sleep before saying anything!”</p>
<p>Archer scolded her, but she didn’t want to show anyone this face.</p>
