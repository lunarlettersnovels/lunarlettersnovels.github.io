            <p>“Miss, will you wait here in the carriage?”</p>
<p>Bell, who came down from the seat next to the horseman, knocked on the window of the carriage. Waking up in the wind, Freya lowered a veil to cover her face. She didn’t want to show someone her slightly red face because of the dream she had while taking a nap.</p>
<p>“No, let’s take a look around here.”</p>
<p>She left this place long before, and she can hardly recall where the orphanage was located. The place has changed a lot. The alley that Sophia took them through was gloomy, but now, where the carriage was, it looked normal. Freya, who was walking on the street, stopped for a moment. Two very young-looking children were playing with a small bowl.</p>
<p>“Miss, please give us some food.”</p>
<p>Freya suffered from her childlessness and worn-out clothes. However, there was no way to know if the children came out because they were really in need or if they were in the same situation as her before.</p>
<p>If there is someone watching and you hastily sympathize with them, they may get hurt even more.</p>
<p>She quickly entered the bakery across the street and greeted the owner.</p>
<p>“I’d like to buy some bread and cookies.”</p>
<p>“What can I get you, young lady?”</p>
<p>The bakery owner was smiling because he was excited about the precious lady shopping in his store.</p>
<p>“By the way, do you know the stories of those children on that road?”</p>
<p>Freya asked softly, as if with a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>“Oh, they have a sad story.”</p>
<p>Their mother died while giving birth to their youngest brother, and their father couldn’t come home often because he was making money.</p>
<p>“Maybe the oldest child is now 10 years old.”</p>
<p>“Bell, how much money did you bring?” Freya asked the maid.</p>
<p>Freya had saved up the money she received each month. It was to buy a house and a small field to live in with Lottie. But she didn’t know where to find Lottie or if he still wanted to be with her.</p>
<p>“Sir, can you sometimes give bread to the children over there? I’ll pay you in advance.”</p>
<p>Actually, it wasn’t that she was generous, it was the best she could do for them. In her words, the owner promised that he would do so, saying that he would sometimes take care of the leftover bread. Freya handed over a gold coin and crossed the street with the bread she had bought.</p>
<p>“Don’t just look around, please help us. We have a baby at home.”</p>
<p>The eldest child, who was said to be ten years old, looked up at Freya. Freya hesitated, giving them the bread. She knew better than anyone how miserable they felt, but she didn’t want to rush into sympathy.</p>
<p>“Take this and share it. And take this too.”</p>
<p>Freya took off her cloak and handed it to the child. Lucius bought it for her, but she wanted to share something else with the children. She didn’t feel good when she got emotional for no reason.</p>
<p>“You know, I’ve talked to the bakery over there, so sometimes you can get something to eat.” I’ll drop by often, or I’ll send someone. I mean,”</p>
<p>Her throat tightened as she spoke about such an embarrassing story. She wanted to give them such comfort as Archer did when she was having a hard time, but it was not easy. Freya hesitated for a while, so the little child touched the bread and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Are you Diana?”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Freya shook her head. <em>What did he mean, Diana? </em>That’s ridiculous. Maybe she’s more pathetic than these kids in front of her. She didn’t have a glimpse of her parents’ faces, and she has nothing. Still, these children can support each other when they are having a hard time, and they still have a father.</p>
<p>“I’ll come often.”</p>
<p>She wanted to instill some hope in the children. Freya was puzzled because it was the first time she had this kind of heart for others, not herself. Two small children kissed the back of her hand with confused eyes.</p>
<p>“The blessing of Diana…”</p>
<p>“Hurry up and go.”</p>
<p>The two children, carefully wrapping bread in their capes, began to run toward the house, where their youngest brother would be waiting alone. She looked back while the children disappeared, and Bell cried.</p>
<p>“Miss, forgive me for being disappointed when I first took care of you.”</p>
<p>Belle pouted her lips as if she were moved by Freya’s warm heart. Freya waved at the sight.</p>
<p>“It’s not like that. Sometimes you want to do something good, right?”</p>
<p>Freya, who rubbed her teary eyes, left the road pleasantly. Archer, who had just returned, hopped in the carriage that was carrying her, joined by Hero, and left the place, dusting.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this?”</p>
<p>The man standing behind the wagon in the distance grimaced and opened his mouth. He was wearing a brown cape, with long silver strands sticking out.</p>
<p>“She said she was going to visit her relative’s house.”</p>
<p>The man muttering to himself was Michael, a wizard sent by the empress. He was ordered to find out what Freya was doing today and who she was meeting.</p>
<p>“From giving bread to a child begging on the street to taking off her clothes.”</p>
<p>I’ve never seen or heard of such an aristocrat. In addition, he could see a natural expression on Freya that was not shown in the palace.</p>
<p>“What is this feeling?”</p>
<p>Her beautiful face was briefly revealed when the chilly wind blew and she flapped her cape.</p>
