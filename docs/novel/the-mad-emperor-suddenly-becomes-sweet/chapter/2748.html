            <p><em>Why does this keep happening?</em></p>
<p>It hasn’t been that long since the night Lucius was attacked.</p>
<p>Freya quickly leaned Lucius against cornstalk, took off his cape, and checked his arm.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, there’s a stabbed wound there.”</p>
<p>“This is fine.”</p>
<p>“You’re bleeding so much, what do you mean you’re fine.”</p>
<p>“It’s not too bad to get hurt.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who was staring into her eyes, whispered very quietly. Freya looked through her bag, found a piece of cloth, and tied it around his wound.</p>
<p>“It’ll be too dangerous if you don’t stop bleeding.”</p>
<p>“It’ll stop soon.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, you remember your way back right?”</p>
<p>Lucius leisurely but slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, I was lost and found you.”</p>
<p>“…. Pardon?”</p>
<p>Lucius was in the same situation as her, she couldn’t say anything about this ridiculous situation.</p>
<p>“Then what should we do now? You’re hurt and it’s so dark.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Lucius looked at her and the dead beast and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>Then when she found something that shined on the floor and as she went to pick it up, Lucius stretched out his arm.</p>
<p>“Are you going to leave a patient?”</p>
<p>She sat right back down at his strong pull. Freya complained as she dusted her clothes.</p>
<p>“It looks like we dropped something there.”</p>
<p>“Just stay by my side.”</p>
<p>Lucius held her tight and his eyes flashed strong light.</p>
<p>“How is someone that was badly hurt, this strong?”</p>
<p>In the end, Freya sat beside him with her handheld by him. It was uncomfortable just to be sleeping in the cornfield, but to be with his Majesty as well.</p>
<p><em>So unlucky I am. So unlucky.</em></p>
<p>Also, she was scared that Lucius might find out that she tried to run away.</p>
<p>He mumbled slowly as he stared at Freya’s nervous face.</p>
<p>“I won’t let your hand go no matter what you say so keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, why?”</p>
<p>She was uncomfortable sitting so close, and her mind headed to the wrist that was being held hard. Lucius spoke as she was frowning.</p>
<p>“I was hurt trying to save you. If you run away at this point, who’s going to take care of me?”</p>
<p>“….. Ha.”</p>
<p>She was about to say something but his face was so serious that she couldn’t.</p>
<p>Freya calmed her breathing and spoke.</p>
<p>“What do you mean running away?”</p>
<p>She felt a little guilty after yelling. It wasn’t like she wasn’t thinking of running away then and now.</p>
<p>“Then you weren’t running away from me?”</p>
<p>Lucius held her wrist tight, stared away, and responded bitterly.</p>
<p>“No, I was… I just got lost.”</p>
<p>As she was trying to lie, her tongue twisted as she wasn’t used to it but she couldn’t admit that she was running away.</p>
<p>Freya glared as she was put in a corner. If Lucius found out she was running away, she has to give him hundred gold coins.</p>
<p>“But why are you here, Your Majesty?”</p>
<p>If on schedule, he should be at the palace already.</p>
<p>Lucius pulled her wrist at her question and their bodies touched each other. His eyes were curved with a smile as he stood so close that they could share the same breath.</p>
<p>“I had something to catch here.”</p>
<p>She stammered as she felt the heat from Lucius coldly smiled.</p>
<p>“That beast just now?”</p>
<p>But it was weird.</p>
<p>His Majesty didn’t enjoy hunting. Also, if it was for hunting then he would’ve brought hunting dogs and the chasers.</p>
<p><em>No way could that be it.</em></p>
<p>She met eyes with Lucius as she was shaking her head in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Yes. I came to get you.”</p>
<p>Hiccup.</p>
<p>Freya hiccupped in surprise as she stared into Lucius’s blue eyes.</p>
<p>‘Me?’</p>
<p>His eyes were very serious.</p>
<p>The wind that came through the cornfield wrapped around them, and Freya carefully opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry, but I can’t-.”</p>
<p><em>Be part of your insane plan.</em></p>
<p><em>I only have one life.</em></p>
<p>She bit her lips as she couldn’t continue. Lucius continued as he saw her troubled face.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of letting you go.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I’m getting a little scared.”</p>
<p>Freya threw a joke trying to alleviate the heavy feeling, but Lucius smiled.</p>
<p>“Freya of Flanders, I heard Archer is your relative?”</p>
<p>“….. Ah.”</p>
<p>The end of a lie was never good. People thought that Freya was from the region of Cheese and Archer’s relative.</p>
<p>“This is a threat!”</p>
<p>As she fought back, Lucius brushed his bang.</p>
<p>“Freya, I’m being fair.”</p>
<p>“How is this fair?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you being too mean to a patient?”</p>
<p>She didn’t feel pity as he held his wounded part and moaned.</p>
<p>“If I knew this was how it was going to be, I would’ve never signed.”</p>
<p>He calmly spoke as she looked enraged.</p>
<p>“That’s why you should really consider when you sign a contract.”</p>
<p>Lucius pulled Freya’s hand strongly and put his cold lips on the back of her hand. As her eyes opened wide surprised at the feeling, Lucius smiled.</p>
<p>“…. This is my signature.”</p>
<p>Freya froze and turned her head.</p>
<p>The night got deeper.</p>
<p>Freya kept complaining while sitting face away from him. The gratefulness that she felt when he saved her from the beast was no longer there.</p>
<p><em>I’m not thankful, and I don’t pity him!</em></p>
<p>She was trying not to pay attention to Lucius, who was moaning once in a while due to the wound.</p>
<p><em>How can he threaten me with that?</em></p>
<p>It was Lucius who spoke first after they didn’t talk for a while.</p>
<p>“Freya.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She was waiting for whatever weird thing he was about to say, but he really did say something weird.</p>
<p>“That moon looks like your face.”</p>
<p>At the end of Lucius’s gaze was a full moon that was glowing brightly.</p>
<p><em>Is he saying that my face is round and chubby like that? </em><em>How could he pick such annoying words all the time?</em></p>
<p>Freya tapped on her fattened cheeks and frowned.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you asking me why?” Lucius asked while still holding her hand. Then Freya shook her head while not even looking at his face.</p>
<p>“I’m not curious at all.”</p>
<p>It was when Lucius was about to speak.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>Soldiers led by Gemini showed up through the cornstalks. Red torches surrounded them and Freya sighed secretly. Just like that, her plan to run away failed.</p>
