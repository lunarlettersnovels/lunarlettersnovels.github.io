            <p>“I can’t compare him to His Highness.”‘</p>
<p>“I guess you miss Archer a lot. I should have arranged a seat earlier.”</p>
<p>“…that is,”</p>
<p>His question made her a little hesitant. It was a little strange to Freya that she wanted to see someone. It bothered her that they broke up without saying goodbye.</p>
<p>“He has arrived.”</p>
<p>On the building where Hero’s finger indicated, a flag with a black eagle, symbolizing His Highness, fluttered violently. When asked if she wanted to see him, Freya, who had been hesitant, grabbed the hem of the dress and began to run.</p>
<p>“Archer! Archer!”</p>
<p>As she pushed her way through the heavy wooden door, she suddenly shut her mouth with her hands. It was completely different from the noisy atmosphere of the battlefield barracks. Inside the quiet room, a group of knights sat at a long table, quietly grooming their swords.</p>
<p>“… I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>She bowed slightly in embarrassment, and the knights stood up and greeted her at once. Freya who had responded awkwardly to them, opened her eyes wide. Seeing only a bunch of dirty soldiers on the battlefield, these men look different. She slowly approached the top seat. It was awkward because it was the first time in a month that Gemini, the captain of the Knights, saw her. Moreover, it was almost the first time she had met her in a dress, so Freya couldn’t speak very well.</p>
<p>“Good morning, sir,”</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua, how are you?”</p>
<p>Gemini, sitting at the top of the table, stood up and politely showed respect. Freya was perplexed because it looked very different from how she had been treated in the barracks.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua said she wanted to see Archer, so I brought her.”</p>
<p>Gemini nodded with a stern look at Hero’s smile. But his black eyes were focused on a woman with a white silk dress and a long green strap around her waist. He hesitated at Freya’s unfamiliar appearance, and she made a low voice.</p>
<p>“By the way, sir, I think you forgot something?”</p>
<p>“Yes…?” Gemini was puzzled.</p>
<p>“You said you’d keep your promise, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Gemini smiled vainly at Freya, glaring at him, with her hand on the waist of a delicate dress. For a moment, he was fascinated by her appearance and forgot what she was like before.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it the woman who threw the man out of the mud?”</p>
<p>With the smile off his lips, he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“I’m not good enough, and I didn’t. Next time, I’ll make it good,” replied Freya coolly, waving her fan in her hand.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the office and have a cup of tea. I’m thirsty.”</p>
<p>At Hero’s suggestion, the three entered the office of the Knights-General and sat down. The room looked like its owner; there was no speck. The books filled one side of the wall, and the title alone made Freya’s headache.</p>
<p><em>It’s just the right thing to do with a strict Gemini.</em></p>
<p>She was looking around with curious eyes, and the door opened with a knock.</p>
<p>“Did you call me, sir?”</p>
<p>A knight with neat brown hair and a thick face came in and bowed his head.</p>
<p>“Archer Walther,”</p>
<p>Gemini’s words made Freya’s eyes round.</p>
<p>“Is it an article with the same name as Archer?”</p>
<p>As Archer stood across from her, Freya’s confusion grew more significant.</p>
<p>“I feel somewhat familiar?”</p>
<p>Hero finally burst into laughter at this beautiful reunion of the two. But no matter how hard she looked at him, he was not the man she knew. It seemed like she had no idea whether it was the same with her.</p>
<p>“Archer, this is Miss Freya De Bua.”</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<p>Archer, who could not recognize her after hearing her name, scratched her head awkwardly, and Freya was moved to tears with delight in the familiar gesture.</p>
<p>“That’s Archer!”</p>
<p>She jumped out of her chair and jumped into Archer’s arms.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear!”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>The elegant lady burst in, and the startled Archer was about to take off her body. Freya narrowed her eyes and pretended to hit him with her fingers raised on the chin.</p>
<p>“Well, uh…?”</p>
<p>Archer’s mouth, which prevented her attack, continued to groan strangely.</p>
<p>“Oh! Freya, is that you?</p>
