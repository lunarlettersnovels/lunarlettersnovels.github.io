            <p>What if the warmth belonged to her and Lucius died overnight?</p>
<p>When Freya crawled back and touched Lucius’ nose, she could feel his breath even though it was weak.</p>
<p><em>Thank God!</em></p>
<p>Freya, who swept his chest, organized Lucius’ clothes that he threw randomly yesterday.</p>
<p>“It’s time for someone to show up…”</p>
<p>When she stepped out of the cave, it was hard to open her eyes to the sunlight. Freya was carefully looking outside the bush after pulling out her neck long. At that time, she heard the voice of a slender woman.</p>
<p>“Where are you his Majesty!?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s Selena.”</p>
<p>At the thought of finally being safe, Freya broke through the bushes. She waved her arms and was delighted with the rescue’s touch.</p>
<p>“This is it! Here you go!”</p>
<p>With the appearance of the rescue team, which started early in the morning, the subsequent work runs smoothly</p>
<p>They safely carried his Majesty’s stretcher into the wagon.</p>
<p><em>That’s a relief.</em></p>
<p>Freya muttered as she watched the back of the wagon running on the wet road. Now that Hero’s good, he will take care of Lucius. He will definitely be fine.</p>
<p>“By the way, it’s still difficult to walk…”</p>
<p>She felt sore all over, and her back, shoulders, and ankles were throbbing.</p>
<p>Somehow she was impatient and couldn’t stop walking. She was also curious if the poisoned soldier has woken up, and also concerned with his majesty’s condition.</p>
<p><em>I’ll have to hurry up and be by his side.</em></p>
<p>Otherwise, the accusations of His Majesty that she would only receive gold and not do the work would be endlessly pouring out.</p>
<p>Freya picked up a long wooden rod and began to walk with her body relying on it.</p>
<p>“But it hurts so much.”</p>
<p>Freya reached out her hand and fumbled once on the wound on her forehead that kept hurting, and then she lifted her mouth bitterly.</p>
<p>“It’s not the first time that I’m sick alone,” she muttered</p>
<p>She forced herself to move a heavy step, but it was painful, she could hear a painful sound in her mouth. The rain that fell all night was stuck in the leaves and wet her forehead every step she took.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, you’re awake”</p>
<p>Lucius, who opened his eyes, was surprised by the unfamiliar environment and stared fiercely everywhere. Near the bed where he lay, Count Edelion and his daughter stood, looking very anxious.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Herro, who was nearby, approached and explained quickly.</p>
<p>“I am delighted your Majesty that you are awake. There was a surprise attack yesterday, whether the information about our going hunting was leaked.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>He tried to raise his body, but he could hardly feel a sensation in one arm.</p>
<p>“Your highness, you can’t move now.” The doctor  said we should take absolute stability.”</p>
<p>Selena approached and lifted her mouth gently as she raised her hand on Lucius’ arm.</p>
<p>“Get rid of it.”</p>
<p>Selena looked embarrassed when he turned and shook off her hand. As the atmosphere suddenly cooled down, Herro quickly stepped out.</p>
<p>“Lady Selena here has been nursing you since morning.”</p>
<p>But without a reply, Lucius asked.</p>
<p>“……tell me what happened first.”</p>
<p>A rough voice flowed from Lucius’ neck as if scratching iron.</p>
<p>“It seems the opponents used a strong poison arrow that neutralizes the limbs. Gemini is also severely injured and is undergoing treatment.”</p>
<p>“Did you figure out what it was?”</p>
<p>“I’ll find out soon.”</p>
<p>They have no idea the kind of poison used and they have never seen anything so serious. When Herro, who had a serious expression, bowed his head and disappeared, Selena came back to his majesty’s side and made an exaggerated voice.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, don’t worry about anything now, I will be here by your side.”</p>
<p>Selena covered Lucius with a blanket with her fine hands.</p>
<p>“You have no idea how heartbroken I was when I found that you fell in the forest today.”</p>
<p>The Count helped his daughter say a word.</p>
<p>“Selena said she would go to the forest to save you even if it was raining. Ha! Ha! Ha!”</p>
<p>Lucius felt like his head was about to burst at their voices and laughter.</p>
<p><em>Really, I wanted to be alone.</em></p>
<p>“……thank you.”</p>
<p>He turned around and grabbed a shirt that smelled of dry sunlight. It wasn’t what he wore when he went hunting. It was clear that someone changed his clothes.</p>
<p><em>I couldn’t have allowed Count Edelion to do this.</em></p>
<p>Due to frequent threats of assassination and his sensitive nature, Lucius was extremely reluctant to let anyone touch his body.</p>
<p>At that moment, what caught his eye was a long, dark hair attached to the bottom of the hem.</p>
<p><em>Wasn’t that a dream?</em></p>
<p>Lucius’ cheeks heated up with a short memory that suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>In his dream, he was lying in a dark, cold space. It was raining outside, and the sound of knocking on the floor could be heard. Having suffered from a severe fever, he saw someone. He couldn’t remember the face clearly, but the eyes were vivid.</p>
<p><em>It was eyes that I wanted to reach and have.</em></p>
