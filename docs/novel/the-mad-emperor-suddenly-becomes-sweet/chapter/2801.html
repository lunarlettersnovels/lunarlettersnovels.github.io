            <p>Recently, Freya has been experiencing mood swings. The world seemed beautiful, and she was happy. But soon, she would feel like a deflated ball, crawling on the floor.</p>
<p>“It’s really strange.”</p>
<p>Freya didn’t know she loved Lucius so much until she felt these overwhelming emotions. Now, just the thought of him makes her heart sink. As she brushed her heated cheeks, she touched the necklace he had given her.</p>
<p>“I miss you so much.”</p>
<p>Freya yearned to see him, hold his warm hands, and make eye contact. It would be lovely to share a warm embrace and run her fingers through Lucius’ soft blonde hair.</p>
<p><em>Freya, I think I’ll be very busy for a few days. But I promise. Let’s go on a trip together after this work. Let’s do that. Alright?</em></p>
<p>Despite the cold wind of the season, his sweet voice warmed her heart.</p>
<p>“But for some reason, I feel nervous.”</p>
<p>Freya had never felt this way in her life, and it felt strange to be so excited about happiness.</p>
<p>“I hope this isn’t a dream.”</p>
<p>She stopped by the library on this floor and, on her way back, passed by Lucius’ bedroom. Freya hugged the book she brought after blushing for no reason. Then she heard a strange groan through the crevice of the bedroom door.</p>
<p>“Is Lucius back?”</p>
<p>But she didn’t know he had returned yet. She couldn’t resist approaching the door, but it wouldn’t budge. Then, she heard a woman’s voice from inside the room.</p>
<p>“Lucius, I love you.”</p>
<p><em>Why was there a woman in his bedroom?</em></p>
<p>Freya knew she shouldn’t eavesdrop, but she leaned in closer to hear.</p>
<p>“Selena, our plan is almost in the final stages.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how long I’ve been waiting. Ugh.”</p>
<p>Freya’s eyes caught sight of two naked individuals, a man and a woman, who had been indulging in each other for a long time. Selena, with her red hair, was lying on the bed, while a sturdy man was on top of her.</p>
<p>“It can’t be Lucius,” thought Freya to herself, desperately hoping it wasn’t him.</p>
<p>She could see the face of the man tossing and turning, and it wasn’t Lucius’. His brilliant blonde hair and blue eyes resembling the sky were directed at Selena lying on the bed, not her.</p>
<p>“Oh, my.”</p>
<p>The two minds confronted each other, thinking that they should stop looking and check what happened. Frozen, Freya opened the door a little more, and the two on the bed noticed her presence.</p>
<p>“She’s so uncultivated. Can’t you see what I’m doing with her now?”</p>
<p>Selena shot back sharply as she wrapped her upper body in a white cloth. Freya couldn’t hear Selena very well, and she whispered low to herself.</p>
<p>“Selena, you’re out.”</p>
<p>All she wanted to know now was what was happening in her heart.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>Count Diverto stood in front of the crown prince and shed tears at the thought of his daughter. He had seen a woman who looked like Sophia at the palace, but he thought it was an illusion. He had been looking for Sophia for so long that he could see everything.</p>
<p>But when he met Sophia again in front of the dressing room, he realized it wasn’t a dream. The enemy, who had shattered his family, was smiling calmly. Seeing the expression on Count Diverto’s face, she hurried away.</p>
<p>“I need to catch the devil who stole my daughter’s child.”</p>
<p>As he saw the woman trying to get away in the wagon, he shouted with his heart in his hand.</p>
<p>“Gabriel, go after that carriage.”</p>
<p>Enduring the terrible pain, the count succeeded in chasing Sophia. He secretly lurked in front of the building where the woman entered, waiting anxiously. Every minute felt like an eternity.</p>
<p>“Gabriel, that woman must be captured alive. We have to catch her and reveal what happened to my daughter. That way, your mother will be able to close her eyes comfortably.”</p>
<p>Startled from his sleep, he couldn’t help but think of his daughter, wondering if she had lived or died over the past decade. Since her disappearance, her room has remained frozen in time, with the dolls and dresses he had bought for her still waiting for their owners.</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting for a decade, but it feels like just a day,” he murmured to himself, pressing his chest as his heart ached with impatience.</p>
<p>But then he scolded himself. After waiting so long, couldn’t he wait a little longer? With that decision, the pain gradually subsided.</p>
<p>As dawn approached and the sun had yet to rise, Sophia emerged and climbed into the carriage she had prepared.</p>
<p>“Gabriel, let’s follow her closely,” she ordered.</p>
<p>They rode for hours, leaving the capital behind and entering a quiet town. Count Diverto, Gabriel, and the knight followed Sophia, watching as she entered a small door.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” a voice demanded.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, they broke down the door and rushed in. One man guarded the entrance while the other pointed his sword at Sophia’s neck.</p>
<p>“What’s going on here?” Sophia cried out at the sudden threat, only to fall silent when she saw Count Diverto’s face behind her.</p>
<p>Realizing that it was pointless to pretend otherwise, Sophia kneeled down and begged for forgiveness.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to do anything wrong. It was all because of her. She made me do it,” she pleaded, trembling with fear.</p>
<p>“What have you done with my daughter?” the count demanded, his composure slipping.</p>
<p>Sophia sat back on her heels, looking up at the count’s face with a mixture of hatred and longing.</p>
