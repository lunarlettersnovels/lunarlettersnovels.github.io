            <p>Lucius twitched Freya’s back, where it looked like thick ropes had been tied. They must have been from when she was in the orphanage. What had Freya done to deserve this cruel punishment? These wounds wouldn’t be enough to make a mere slave. Lucius, trembling with anger, hugged Freya tightly with one arm around her waist.</p>
<p>“I swear I will find that woman and twist her neck with my bare hands.”</p>
<p>“Let me handle my revenge, don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Thinking of Sophie and Shylo made her want to vomit. To use her for their own gain, were they really human?</p>
<p>“Freya, it’s all right, please don’t push me away.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right, please don’t do this to me.”</p>
<p>Freya tightened the thick hand that was around her waist and twisted her body. She felt her chest tighten at the hot breath that reached her neck, and her lower abdomen was completely crunched.</p>
<p><em>I should hate him, but it’s too hard for me.</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t deny even this emotion, which was the first time she felt it in her life. But even so, she shouldn’t expect anything else.</p>
<p>“Freya, Freya, please look at me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t do this. Somebody might  see us?”</p>
<p>Lucius slowly relaxed the strength in his hand, taking advantage of the moment Freya shielded herself with the cloak that was laid on the ground and moved away from him. Her knees shook, and it was difficult to walk properly. It felt like blood was flowing, as if the wound had opened again.</p>
<p>“Alright. Leave me behind, Freya.”</p>
<p>Lucius couldn’t even turn to look at her, and he just swayed there. A moment later, with a sound of splashing, water spattered up to where Freya was standing.</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>Surprised, she turned around, but Lucius, who had fallen into the hot spring, did not lift his head.</p>
<p>“What? Why are you doing this?”</p>
<p>She waited for a while, thinking it might just be a joke, but there was no movement from Lucius’ body. She remembered the scent of the drink she gave him earlier and had a terrible thought. She ran over to him and quickly dragged him out of the hot springs.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, Your Highness!” she called, but there was no response. No matter how much she shook him or checked his pulse, there was no sign of life.</p>
<p>“Someone help me!” she cried out, but only the sound of the wind answered her. She realized that the only person who could come and go in this place was Lucius, and her face filled with despair.</p>
<p>“If he’s going to die anyway, what’s the point?” She was furious with Lucius, but his death was another matter entirely.</p>
<p>“Wake up! Don’t die!” In her panic, she frantically shook his body and even lightly slapped his face. Then she remembered a story she had heard from Archer</p>
<p>Archer didn’t like bathing because he almost drowned when he was young. Freya quickly lifted Lucius’ jaw and held it firmly with her hands. Freya’s fingertips kept shaking, and his wet face slipped from her hands.</p>
<p>“What on earth are we meant to be, not once…?” she thought, as she watched Lucius try to open his mouth with her fingers but was still unable to get her act together. Freya put her ear to Lucius’ chest.</p>
<p>“He’s still alive,” she said.</p>
<p>She looked up at the dark night sky and took a deep breath before bowing her head straight away. After covering Lucius’ nose with her hand, she slowly breathed into his lips. Tears flowed automatically from the touch of Lucius’ too-cold lips.</p>
<p>“Don’t die. You were doing something important enough to make a person this big.” Freya thought as she watched Lucius’ chest go up and down when she folded her lips again and breathed. After a while, Lucius coughed up a little water.</p>
<p>“You’re alive,” she said, and at the moment of eye contact, Freya turned her head. She didn’t want him to see her face soaked with tears.</p>
<p>“I’ll call someone in a minute,” she said.</p>
<p>Lucius couldn’t breathe properly and coughed in pain. Freya had to barely hold herself back from moving automatically toward him, as he rolled around the grass in pain. She slowly got up and looked at the bushes.</p>
<p>“I’ve done as much as I can,” she thought. Freya had saved Lucius from drowning and given him first aid. There was nothing more she could do.</p>
<p>“Don’t go.” Lucius’ deep voice made her heart throb again. The moment Freya first met Lucius overlapped with his weakened appearance.</p>
<p>Freya, who covered her ears with both hands, ran straight through the bushes.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to listen to anything,” she thought.</p>
<p>When Freya looked into Lucius’ eyes and heard his voice, she kept getting weaker, as if it were not her.</p>
<p>“I’m so ugly like that,” she thought.</p>
<p>Freya decided to pursue only her simple dreams. The rest was nothing but a nuisance.</p>
