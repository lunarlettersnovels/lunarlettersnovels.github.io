            <p>“To the Empress Milady’s blessing!”</p>
<p>Francesca, who entered the audience room, greeted the Empress with an impeccable gesture, and Freya, who stood next to her, copied it clumsily.</p>
<p>“Come here, Miss De Bua.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Freya sat down on the chair on the opposite side of the Empress, whose head was turned upward and decorated with feathers, looking like a sculpture with her closed mouth. The red lips rattled, and soon the Empress spoke.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the late invitation. I haven’t been feeling well.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it is okay, your Majesty.” <em>It’s all right if you’re not feeling well all the time. </em>She gulped down what she couldn’t say.</p>
<p>“Do you know that I raised Lucius as my son?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>
<p>“So I’ll think of you as my daughter.”</p>
<p>Freya smiled forcefully as she looked at the Queen. She did not know the court manners and stuttered through the writings, but Freya knew the Empress was after Lucius’s life.</p>
<p><em>Every little boy on the street knows the story.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, she was disgusted by the Empress’s words.</p>
<p>The Empress’s gaze becomes disgusting as she looks down on Freya from head to toes. Her expression changed, and she sat down quickly.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor.”</p>
<p>The Empress nodded with great satisfaction at Freya’s answer.</p>
<p>Again, this answer was all-around.</p>
<p>Freya began to eat muffins and scones placed on the table in a quiet atmosphere. Francesca told her to take it slowly, but Freya had no choice but to fill her mouth as if she did not want to speak in such a stuffy atmosphere. She puffed her cheeks like a squirrel, and the Empress smiled at her.</p>
<p>“Ms. De Bua eats so exquisitely.”</p>
<p>“It is because, in Del Mundo, we have plenty of delicious foods.”</p>
<p>Freya scratched her head with her hands full of crumbs, and Francesca frowned at the sight.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua, didn’t I tell you to be careful?”</p>
<p>The Baroness whispered lowly, and the Empress waved her hand.</p>
<p>“It’s all right. I like Miss De Bua’s freewheeling part.”</p>
<p>Contrary to her gentle way of speaking, the Empress did not hide the contempt in her eyes. Freya broke the cookies into small pieces with her hands, looking forward to the end of a terrible time.</p>
<p><em>Why is time so slow?</em></p>
<p>Freya was so conscious of the time, suddenly the door burst open, and someone came in.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you had such a visitor.”</p>
<p>Francesca jumped up and bowed politely at the man’s appearance. He had brownish red hair, black eyes, and a slightly fragile impression.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua, this is my son, Prince Hart.”</p>
<p>Milady clasped Hart’s hand beside her with a happy face. But he held out the Empress’ hand and gulped down the tea in front of him. He put the teacup down and gave a chin to Freya.</p>
<p>“Oh, so you’re my brother’s fiancee? ”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Prince Hart.”</p>
<p>Freya greeted Prince Hart as politely as she could. The prince, who seemed to be greeted by her, grinned and spoke.</p>
<p>“Don’t say such a greeting. It’s not fun.”</p>
<p>“…oh.”</p>
<p>Prince Hart was the most unusual person she had ever seen here. She didn’t know what expression to make, so Freya was spaced out, and he leaned forward and whispered.</p>
<p>“Do you know that? It is a secret, but there was a rumor that he was a dead man because he had never been in a relationship.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Freya’s jaw dropped at his shocking remarks.</p>
<p><em>Oh, my God! Lucius is a nobleman!</em></p>
<p>Freya’s face flamed up. She didn’t expect to hear such a story from Prince Hart.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a rumor. Lucius is in such good shape that it’s possible.”</p>
<p>For a short time, the rumor of Lucius made her head want to explode.</p>
<p>Freya thought that it had nothing to do with her anyway.</p>
<p><em>Anyway, I’m not his fiancee.</em></p>
<p>For a short time, Milady squealed. “Hart! How could you be so ungrateful.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m only telling her that there’s a rumor.”</p>
<p>Since then, Milady has been preaching to his son in front of them.</p>
<p><em>Oh, please save me from here. </em>Freya wishes to disappear from her seat.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we get out of here. I’ll show you around the palace.”</p>
<p>Hart jumped up from his seat and grabbed Freya’s hand, and pulled her. It happened in an instant.</p>
<p>“Well, uh….” Freya looked perplexed, but no one could stop her. Then she was left alone with him holding her hand.</p>
<p>“Does crazy run in the family?”</p>
<p>The Prince who dragged Freya helplessly became aggressive again. He let go of his grip on her when they were a little out of the public’s eyes.</p>
<p>“You almost died of frustration while drinking tea, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” She was suffocated but couldn’t speak honestly.</p>
<p>“No way! It’s hard for me to deal with my mother, too.”</p>
