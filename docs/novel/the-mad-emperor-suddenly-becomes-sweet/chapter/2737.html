            <p>Lucius whispered at Freya, who had been looking into a box for a while.</p>
<p>“I wanted to bring the cake, but it was all going to be crushed in bringing it here.”</p>
<p>Freya thought of a strange scene as she stared at a cute little cookie. With a bloody sword, the creepy-looking Lucius went into the bakery and chose these things.</p>
<p><em>The bakery owner might be frightened?</em></p>
<p>What a ridiculous imagination, she sighed.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you eat?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“You don’t like sweet things very much, do you?”</p>
<p>“No way. When I was a child, I imagined eating something like this out of the mud.”</p>
<p>Out of excitement, Freya said something that she shouldn’t have said. Lucius, too, swept his face with her words. Lucius pressed his thigh tightly and swallowed his saliva in all the memories that he thought she had forgotten.</p>
<p>“Then try to eat comfortably. I’ll take a break.”</p>
<p>Freya pouted her lips and looked at him, leaning back on the sofa again.</p>
<p>“What skill do you want me to eat comfortably?”</p>
<p>When Lucius glanced sideways, Freya’s loose shirt covered her chest narrowly, and her thigh muscles, which looked thicker than her waist, popped out on the outside of her pants.</p>
<p><em>Why does he keep peeping on me?</em></p>
<p>Freya, whose cheeks kept burning, quickly stared at the box with her eyes drawn.</p>
<p><em>I didn’t know Lucius is this sincere!</em></p>
<p>Freya carefully picked up a carrot-shaped cookie. The moderately sweet and savory flavor spread through her mouth when she took a bite.</p>
<p>“Oh my, it’s so delicious!”</p>
<p>Without consciousness, she uttered an exclamation, and in the wind, Lucius moved his body.</p>
<p>“How does it taste?” Is there a carrot in it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if they put in a carrot, but it’s very savory.”</p>
<p>“If you’ve tasted it, I’ll try it, too.”</p>
<p>“……?”</p>
<p>Freya looked at him with suspicious eyes as he opened his mouth toward her.</p>
<p><em>That’s right. There’s nothing strange about it.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t once or twice that she suddenly asked him to stand down or did something strange. Freya picked up a cookie and put it in his mouth. Lucius, who ate the cookies, made a tiny voice.</p>
<p>“It reminds me of my childhood.”</p>
<p>“Your childhood?”</p>
<p>“I shared this with my friend.”</p>
<p>Looking at his dream-like blue eyes, Freya recalled similar but different memories.</p>
<p><em>We had a lot of fun.</em></p>
<p>Ruth’s face, who complained about Freya’s playing the role of a mother, stood out.</p>
<p><em>It was adorable,</em></p>
<p>Freya struggled for a moment in the past, and Lucius picked up a cup of tea from the table. Freya shook her arm in astonishment.</p>
<p>“Your highness! That’s the cup I was drinking.”</p>
<p>Regardless of what she said, Lucius gulped down the rest of the tea.</p>
<p>“Why is it poisoned?”</p>
<p>“That’s not true, but I –”</p>
<p>No, there’s a new cup next to it. Freya realized that there was no point in weighing these things for a moment.</p>
<p><em>Is he weird?</em></p>
<p>A picture of the corner of the table came into his eyes as he put the cup down.</p>
<p>“By the way, what is this?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t look!”</p>
<p>Freya quickly stretched out her arms to stop him, but Lucius’s arms were faster.</p>
<p>“…well,” he unfolded the paper and frowned heavily. “You must have taken art lessons.”</p>
<p>“Yes,”</p>
<p>“But what are these black circles and lines?” Lucius, too, responded no differently than the teacher.</p>
<p>“That’s my friend,”</p>
<p>“Is it Won’s face or Sun’s hair?”</p>
<p>Fortunately, unlike the teacher, he recognized that the painting was someone’s face. He was so excited that Freya spoke pleasantly.</p>
<p>“Ruth’s face was pale, and his blond hair shone like the sun. The green eyes were like bushes. His lips were thin but very red.”</p>
<p>“Ruth…”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry,”</p>
<p>Who made such a fuss about her childhood friend?</p>
<p>Lucius, who had been silent for a moment, folded the painting and put it in his arms.</p>
<p>“I’ll take this,”</p>
<p>“…what?”</p>
<p>It was of little significance to others, but it was precious to Freya.</p>
<p>“It’s the first Ruth I’ve painted.”‘</p>
<p>Freya could not understand why he took her painting.</p>
<p>“No, Your Highness, what good is that?”</p>
<p>“I’ll give it back to you when I’m done. It’s a kind of collateral.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p><em>Why did he give me cookies and be friendly?</em></p>
<p>Again, His Highness Lucius was evident as a dark cloud hanging over her life.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In dance class, Freya gasped and hid in the garden. She breathed heavily as she wiped away her sweat like it was raining.</p>
<p>“I want to run away for a while.”</p>
<p>When she said a short word, her nose seemed to be steaming.</p>
<p>Freya thought she had experienced many things that she couldn’t see in her life, but it was also a mistake. An etiquette class where you get a cramp in your head every time you listen to it, a poem class where you fall asleep when you open a book, and a horseback riding class that is fear itself.</p>
<p>“They all look elegant, but they’re all the worst!”</p>
<p>Among them, were the dance lessons.</p>
<p>Mr. Pierre was full of enthusiasm. He was a man who would not let his hands and feet alone for a moment and forced Freya to do it. Today, Freya practiced touching her forehead for an hour, and she felt like she would get hurt continuously.</p>
<p>“No, I’m afraid I’ve fallen before.”</p>
<p>Her legs trembled, and her face burned, but Pierre was not satisfied.</p>
<p>“Now! Miss! Stretch your legs further!” You can do it!”</p>
<p>Freya ran away after saying she would drink water for a while.</p>
<p>“Gasp. I’m going to rest over there for a while.”</p>
