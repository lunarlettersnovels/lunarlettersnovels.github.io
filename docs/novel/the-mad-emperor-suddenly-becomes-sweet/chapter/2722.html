<p>To Freya’s question, the empress pretended not to win and opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Your court romances include the Knight Commander, the Magician, and the tall Knight. They say it’s hard to even count it by hand.”</p>
<p>They talked about things that Freya couldn’t understand at all.</p>
<p>She had never been in a relationship before, but what is court love?</p>
<p>Then last time, she remembered that Lucius said something similar to this.</p>
<p>“Relationship in the palace?”</p>
<p>“Oh, are you pretending you don’t know?”</p>
<p>The empress said that it is popular for aristocratic women who are married to the Empire to have a separate lover.</p>
<p>“Of course, I’m not interested in anything that’s so downbeat.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Freya, who had been eating cake for a while, squinted her eyes. They had no intention of listening to her.</p>
<p><em>They think whatever they want when they hear rumors. So, there is no use to pretend</em> <em>to be a positive lady.</em></p>
<p>“Doesn’t your highness get angry about court relationships?”</p>
<p>Selena, who was shaking the fan gently, asked Freya who snapped her fork down and raised her head straight.</p>
<p>“Well, I can’t help being popular. And the rumor is a little lacking.”</p>
<p>“Which part is that?”</p>
<p>The empress, who sipped tea, also showed interest.</p>
<p>” I went out with Prince Hart, too.”</p>
<p>“……Oh, my God.”</p>
<p>Freya’s remarks froze the surroundings in an instant.</p>
<p>Certainly, the words were quite shocking, and the two aristocrats in front of her couldn’t open their mouths. Freya calmly sipped her tea and picked up the cookies.</p>
<p><em>If you want to be such a promiscuous woman, I’ll be.</em></p>
<p>As she sat down with great vigor and spread her shoulders wide, the empress took her mouth off.</p>
<p>“Miss De Bua must have been mistaken. I’m sure you misunderstood that because our hearts are kind. Miss Edelion here will soon be Hart’s mate.”</p>
<p>“……Ah.”</p>
<p>When she looked at Selena at the empress’s words, her eyes were staring at Freya as if they were stabbing her. When she was confident, Freya always had a little regret.</p>
<p>“Prince Hart doesn’t feel like that to me.”</p>
<p>It seemed a little out of the ordinary to say this in front of his soon-to-be-engaged partner.</p>
<p>“By the way, isn’t Selena fond of His Highness Lucius?”</p>
<p>Selena’s affection for Lucius was so obvious to her that she didn’t even know much about love between men and women.</p>
<p>Is it because of her? Is it because she started a play like this is why things went wrong? Hero’s ideas were a little different, although Lucius didn’t like Selena much.</p>
<p><em>Hero said he needed Selena’s family.</em></p>
<p>With all her confusion hidden, she greeted politely.</p>
<p>“Congratulations.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>But Selena sipped her tea, completely ignoring her greetings. In a frozen pond-like atmosphere, the empress spoke softly, out of place.</p>
<p>“We’re all going to be one family, so if there’s any misunderstanding, we’d better resolve it quickly. Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p>“I would like to express my deepest thanks for Her Majesty’s consideration.”</p>
<p>Selena, who did not listen to Freya’s greeting, bowed to the empress. Beautiful red hair sparkled like a thorny rose, and white teeth were slightly revealed through the red lips.</p>
<p><em>I won’t stay still.</em></p>
<p>Freya de Bua vowed to crush a savage girl with her own hands.</p>
<p>Selena Edelion lived an unenviable life for the royal family. His father cherished Selena.</p>
<p>‘I’ll get everything under your feet, my daughter.’</p>
<p>Expensive, colorful dresses and jewelry were common enough to be caught in the foot. The Count of Southern Edelion was so powerful that Selena was like the sun there.</p>
<p>‘There’s nothing I don’t have.’</p>
<p>The encounter between the successors of the Morsian Empire and the southern sun Selena was close to inevitable. She fell in love with Lucius at first sight. Selena’s first love began, and she never thought of anything else.</p>
<p>‘I need to be next to you, Lucius.’</p>
<p>It’s been many years since Selena saw Lucius with this strong belief.</p>
<p>Selena had to watch her love be denied for a moment. A shallow girl from Del Mundo took over Lucius.</p>
<p>‘Father, I want to have His Royal Highness Lucius! I don’t like anything else.’</p>
<p>Count Edelion, who was particularly vulnerable to his daughter, tried to appease Selena, but to no avail. Selena completely ate and drank and remained stubborn. Selena wanted to own Lucius like a toy made of silver that she had when she was young.</p>
<p>Then one day, Count Edelion received a secret communication.</p>
<p>‘There was a message from the Empress.’</p>
<p>The count was a good calculator. He realized that it was time to make a big decision for his daughter’s future. Count Edelion had met with the empress, avoiding the eyes of others. The two were dressed up in black and had a conversation in the carriage. The empress’ lips, which were veiled and hard to see, moved.</p>
<p>‘The South is in the hands of our Earl of Edelion.’</p>
<p>‘I don’t think that all the weeds growing in the fields of the Morsiani Empire belong to the great emperor. I rely on the count’s loyalty.’</p>
<p>The empress soon broached the subject.</p>
<p>‘I’d like to marry Prince Hart and  Selena.’</p>
<p>Count Edelion sweated a little. He had to answer after careful consideration.</p>
<p>‘It’s hard to convince Selena, but I can help it.’</p>
<p>It was partly because it was not a losing business, but there were other reasons why I couldn’t refuse the empress’ offer.</p>
<p>‘I might be like that’’</p>
<p>The process of the emperor’s divorce and remarriage was not all smooth. Quite a few families had objected, but they all had accidents. As things turned out that way, public opinion gradually ruled in favor of Milady.</p>
<p>There were rumors that Empress Milady was carrying a black wizard on her back.</p>
<p>In this situation, Count Edelion could not refuse the Empress’s proposal.</p>
<p>After returning home, Count Edelion began to conciliate his daughter eagerly.</p>
<p>“My family could be in danger. In addition, the next emperor will be Prince Hart.”</p>
<p>“What I want to be is not the next empress, but next to Lucius.”</p>
<p>“If you stand by Lucius now, everyone can be in danger.”</p>
