            <p>Freya remembered making eye contact with a child her age who was passing by in a carriage. Freya felt ashamed of her own circumstances because the child had never known hunger or cold. She resented her parents, whom she had never met, and couldn’t understand why she had to beg on the streets. Her unhappy childhood weighed heavily on her mind, and she remembered Sophia, a woman who was frequently drunk, saying,</p>
<p>“You’ll die soon if you envy the child in the carriage. When trying to survive, you shouldn’t make such comparisons.”</p>
<p>Freya’s day-to-day life was a constant struggle to eat, work, and sleep. Hart’s voice cut her off in her thoughts.</p>
<p>“Freya, Freya, Freya? I’m so sorry. “What’s on your mind that has you looking so terrified?”</p>
<p>“None,” Freya replied.</p>
<p>The song was almost finished, and she felt she had done her job well enough for the day. She even improved her dance. Pierre might have clapped his hands if he had seen it. Hart seemed to have something to say as Freya prepared for her final greeting, but Freya couldn’t hear him.</p>
<p>Who exactly are they?</p>
<p>Shilo and Sophia were talking among the nobles with their arms crossed, and Freya’s entire body froze and trembled. She couldn’t recall how she ended the greeting.</p>
<p>She emerged from the banquet hall, trying not to fall, and someone held Freya’s hand. She didn’t want to look down to see who it was because she was afraid it was Shilo. She had to pretend she wasn’t Freya and hoped she wouldn’t be recognized.</p>
<p>Every morning when she looks in the mirror, she tells herself this. She guessed it was because she was good at aristocratic games. She claims she was unafraid when the dagger flew in.</p>
<p>It was Lucius who popped his head in front of her stiff face. Her legs reeled as he examined her face. He let out a low growl at the sight of Freya, who had turned pale.</p>
<p>“Did Prince Heart irritate you?” Freya had to intervene because he was about to wrap his sword around his waist.</p>
<p>“He didn’t, no. “I’m not feeling well.” She had no choice but to take this wrong turn.</p>
<p>Freya couldn’t admit she was scared because the people who had bullied her entire life were present. Freya tried to straighten her back because no one could protect her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Freya walked down the hall, her head throbbing, wishing she hadn’t seen anything. Her maids were silently following her, and anyone who saw her in the hallway bowed to her. Lucius had told her to return to her room. She decided to go to her bedroom and unwind without thinking about anything. Lucius will be able to protect her while the contract is in effect. Someone called her as she was about to turn the corner.</p>
<p>“Freya?”</p>
<p>She would never forget a sharp voice from behind her. Freya turned slowly, and there stood Sophia, a ferocious expression on her face.</p>
<p>“Oh, I was wondering about that, but I guess it’s correct.” Freya was concerned that because she was dressed up, she would not be recognized. Freya had a firm grip on Sophia’s stomach and was ready to greet her. There was no sign of blushing.</p>
<p>“What is your name?” Sophia flinched when she opened her mouth gracefully, waving the fan she was holding.</p>
<p>Freya tried to imitate Selena by relaxedly blinking her eyelashes. Her back was drenched in a cold sweat, and her legs were trembling. Freya raised her chin arrogantly, putting a lot of strength in her stomach.</p>
<p>“Did we know each other before?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I must have seen it incorrectly.”</p>
<p>A familiar face appeared from the opposite side as the two people stood in the hallway having an awkward conversation.</p>
<p>“What brings you here, Miss de Bua? Has the banquet concluded?”</p>
<p>“Count Diverto,” she says.</p>
<p>Sophia’s face turned pale when Freya called his opponent’s name. She took her cape, covered her face, and walked away without saying hello.</p>
<p>“……uggghhh.”</p>
<p>Freya struggled to prepare for the banquet, but she lacked the energy to confront her old adversaries. The count seized her as she staggered.</p>
<p>“I think I’m going to pass out soon; I’m taking a break.”</p>
<p>The count led her to a nearby drawing room and requested that the maid bring her water.</p>
<p>“Are you all right?” The count’s concern was visible next to Freya, who sat obliquely in the long chair.</p>
<p>“I owe you something.”</p>
<p>“What exactly do you mean?” Freya inquired.</p>
<p>A young man bowed to her as the drawing-room door opened.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right over.”</p>
<p>Freya greeted the young man, who resembled the count, with a slight recline.</p>
<p>“Hello, my name is Gabriel Diverto. My father sent me a message to come here, so please accept my apologies.”</p>
<p>Freya soon found herself in an unusual mood. I have the impression that I know them. Why do I feel this way when I meet someone for the first time?</p>
<p>“You recently saved my father. Thank you for taking the time to read this.”</p>
<p>“No, no one but me would have done that.”</p>
<p>“Drink the water quickly.”</p>
<p>Freya took the water from the young man.</p>
<p>After drinking the water, she felt better. She could clearly see Gabriel and the count’s green eyes. Green eyes are unusual, but… Such coincidences can occur frequently.</p>
<p>“I’d like to invite you to Diverto Street later when you’re feeling better.”</p>
<p>“That’s great.” Even though she was a phony aristocrat, she couldn’t say no to the count’s earnest request to invite her twice. She soon recovered her spirits and ended her relationship with Count Diverto, but their thoughts lingered in her mind for a long time.</p>
