            <p>Milady was fully prepared in case Lucius could not be killed. She created a document that he forced the emperor to sign, giving Hart the crown. When Milady presented the document, the aristocrats exchanged glances. It stated that the throne would pass to Hart.</p>
<p>“This must be His Majesty’s signature.”</p>
<p>“It’s not even amusing to watch.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who was observing, straightened his back slowly. He didn’t know what Milady was planning, so he remained silent.</p>
<p>“I thought she was using her brain, but I didn’t realize she was this foolish.”</p>
<p>“I cannot believe she thought she could depose the eldest son of the imperial family and the legitimate heir with just one piece of paper.”</p>
<p>“But, Your Highness, the Crown Prince, it is clearly stated here.”</p>
<p>The minister, who spoke firmly, noticed Lucius’ cold gaze and quickly trailed off. The Earl of Edelion then rose from his seat.</p>
<p>“The Edelion family is determined to obey the Emperor’s will even if it means sacrificing our lives.”</p>
<p>In this tense situation, even the slightest misstep could result in severe injury or death. Now that Hart and Selena were in the same position, Count Edelion would push Milady back unconditionally. Lucius nodded in agreement with the count’s words.</p>
<p>“Yes. In fact, it wouldn’t be bad for someone more deserving, like myself, to become emperor.”</p>
<p>Lucius’ words silenced the room. This was the first time he talked about relinquishing his position as crown prince.</p>
<p>“But you know what? He deserves it. Don’t you think so? If anyone could become emperor, we could just take a stray dog off the street and crown it.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, you have gone too far. Morsiani is a glorious empire protected by Dianas. The person who becomes Emperor Morsiani must be of higher status than anyone else.”</p>
<p>Lucius smirked at Milady’s words.</p>
<p>“That’s right. They must be of noble birth.”</p>
<p>Lucius winked at Gemini, who was standing behind him, and a wooden box covered with cloth emerged from a corner.</p>
<p>“What is that, Your Highness?” Milady’s words were tinged with an ominous premonition.</p>
<p>“My gift for Her Majesty the Empress,” replied Lucius.</p>
<p>When the soldier standing guard opened the box, a shabby man popped out. The aristocrats were astonished at Lucius, who had locked a person in a wooden box.</p>
<p>“Well, who is that, Your Highness?” one of them asked.</p>
<p>The man coughed before Lucius could speak, and he frowned, wondering if the bright light was unfamiliar. Suddenly, the man shouted, “Milady!”</p>
<p>“…Who are you to call my name?” Milady replied.</p>
<p>The man, whose wrists were tied with a rope, spoke again. “Is my child well?”</p>
<p>Milady’s eyes widened, and she shouted fiercely, “What is my intention to bring such a crazy beggar to such an important place? Bring that man out right now!”</p>
<p>At Milady’s order, the soldier guarding her tried to cover the box containing the man again.</p>
<p>“Wait, wait.” Hart, who had little interest in the meeting, jumped to his feet and approached the box. Although his memory was faint because he was very young, he certainly looked familiar.</p>
<p>“Are you Hart? Do you recognize your father?” he asked.</p>
<p>“…Father?” Hart replied, his eyes widening.</p>
<p>Hart remembered riding horses and running around with a man when he was young. Was it for this reason? Strangely, he kept saying that his mother looked like him, who did not resemble the emperor at all. Whenever that happened, the emperor only laughed and said that Hart would look more like him when he grew up.</p>
<p>“Oh, then my mother met the emperor and met another man.” As the thought crossed his mind, Hart began to feel uneasy.</p>
<p>He was aware of the scandal surrounding his mother. There were rumors of her involvement with multiple men and even the wizard Michael. Whenever it was brought up, he wanted to cover his ears and close his eyes, but now he had reached his limit. He could not bear to watch his mother become more entangled in bloodshed.</p>
<p>“Mother, what do you gain from all of this?” Hart, who had just abandoned the man in shabby clothes, gazed at Milady and asked.</p>
<p>“Hart, I have only lived for your happiness. Everything I have done has been for you,” Milady replied, her voice shaking.</p>
<p>Hart shook his head as he looked at his mother’s red eyes. “Mother, when did you ever ask me what I wanted?”</p>
<p>All he ever wanted was to live in a small house, as peaceful as before. But he had given up that hope long ago.</p>
<p>“Hart! How could you speak to your mother like that? I have sacrificed so much for you,” the aristocrat exclaimed, shocked and surprised at their conversation. If what they were saying was true, then Hart was not fit to inherit the throne.</p>
<p>“This document contains a list of lawmakers and witnesses who helped the empress during her childbirth, as well as their testimonies,” Lucius explained, presenting the papers to the aristocrat.</p>
<p>The aristocrat examined the documents and clicked his tongue, dismissing them as not worth further discussion.</p>
<p>“What are they doing? Don’t you know who I am?” Milady made a scene, glaring at the aristocrat with fierce eyes. How many tears had she shed before giving birth to Hart as an illegitimate child, and how much blood was on her hands? Despite her aristocratic threats, Milady knew that people who are unconvincing would weaken her power.</p>
<p>“I will soon put the world at my son’s feet,” Milady vowed to herself. She could not falter here.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you accept this document, in which you once believed so much?” Lucius asked.</p>
