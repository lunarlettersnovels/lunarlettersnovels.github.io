            <p><em>He believes that jumping off would be far more enjoyable.</em></p>
<p>Freya sighed as she swallowed her saliva. Why is it so difficult for her to dismiss Lucius’ words? She was compelled to keep his hand still. When they stood on the railing together, she felt sick.</p>
<p>“If you’re scared, Freya, don’t look down; just look at me.”</p>
<p><em>Your eyes are terrifying.</em></p>
<p>Freya murmured quietly to herself as she gazed into his deep blue eyes. A large hand bent over her waist at that moment, and her foot slipped off the railing. It happened in an instant.</p>
<p>Scream!</p>
<p>Freya let out a short shriek as they jumped down. Lucius smirked and narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Ah! “Why do you keep falling?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, you’re not going to get hurt.”</p>
<p>Freya moved her legs slightly as she leaned into Lucius’ arms. He said the Grand Duke has the strength of a beast, so she wasn’t hurt “as he is rumored to be.” She was, however, a regular person. Freya drew hard on the crumpled clothes as she fell away from him. She couldn’t even do that because her hands were shaking.</p>
<p>“What, after all, is the point of the stairs?”</p>
<p>Lucius reached for Freya as she grumbled.</p>
<p>“I dislike being observed.” “Please, please, please.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I am ill.”</p>
<p>Freya’s head was spinning, just like the first time, she rode in a carriage. Lucius took her hand in his and began running without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Gasp. “I’m afraid I can’t go any further, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who had previously stated that it would be difficult, dragged her helplessly and eventually stopped. Freya straightened her back and patted her chest with both hands, which were pounding furiously. Sweat was dripping from her brow. Freya wiped the sweat from her brow with her sleeves.</p>
<p>“Oh! This is where we went the last time.”</p>
<p>“Because this is where no one is looking.”</p>
<p>The moonlit lake had a different feel than it did during the day. The mysterious allure of the lake enchanted Freya. She could see the world in a different light than before. It was a relief to no longer have to rush to feed her ravenous stomach.</p>
<p>There’s a rustling sound.</p>
<p>As she turned to face Lucius, who stood politely, he extended his hand and bowed slightly. His broad shoulders were revealed by a black shirt fluttering in the wind, and his blond hair, which was finer than moonlight, dazzled.</p>
<p>“Goddess Diana’s blessing to you,” he said softly as he kissed the back of Freya’s hand. Freya recited what Francesca had taught her.</p>
<p>“May the Lord grant the goddess Diana peace.”</p>
<p>Not in a stiff banquet hall, the two began to dance slowly on the soft and damp grass. Instead of the grand sound of music, they subjected their bodies to grass bugs, wind sounds, and lakeside songs.</p>
<p><em>Oh, my goodness! My heart is racing so quickly.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t the same as when she danced with Pierre and Michael. Freya was aware of Lucius’ massive hand holding hers, and her forehead touched his burning chest. Furthermore, Lucius’ dancing abilities were so impressive that he led her very well.</p>
<p><em>Because your eyes were on me, I felt like my body was on fire.</em></p>
<p>“Am I that attractive, Freya?”</p>
<p>Freya nearly tripped over his query. Freya remained silent, pretending not to hear.</p>
<p>“Why are you not responding?” “Do you still remember your first love?”</p>
<p>He asked jokingly, holding her waist with a graceful movement.</p>
<p>“Please tell me.” “Do you know anyone in the empire better than I do?”</p>
<p>“Am I acquainted with any other men in the empire?”</p>
<p>Freya did not want to give the arrogant response that Lucius gave. Freya’s curt reply made his face pale.</p>
<p>“Would you like to meet another guy?”</p>
<p>Freya shook her head quickly, recalling his warning the day before not to meet another man.</p>
<p>“No way. “I’m not looking for a relationship.”</p>
<p>“Certainly not…”</p>
<p>Freya, who was following him around, was having difficulty concentrating on the dance. He was usually quiet, but he had a lot of questions, which Freya would occasionally convey in this manner.</p>
<p>“I’m starving and don’t know where to go, so who should I meet?”</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t you change your mind if you met a handsome, wealthy man like me?”</p>
<p>“I’ll consider it then.”</p>
<p>Lucius immediately stopped dancing after hearing her words. Freya, who was standing slightly away from him and holding one hand, stole a glance.</p>
<p>“You appear to be uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>Freya did it frequently, but she had no idea why she was acting strangely.</p>
<p>“I mean us, Freya.” “We need to cut the engagement period in half.”</p>
<p>“……?”</p>
<p>Freya blinked, unsure of what it meant.</p>
<p>“Let’s get married, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Marriage?”</p>
<p>“The plan has shifted slightly.”</p>
<p>Freya can’t believe they’re marrying when she hadn’t even accepted their engagement.</p>
<p>“Freya. “It’s similar to getting engaged or married.”</p>
<p>“……No way.”</p>
<p>Now Lucius is comparing eating cake to eating cookies, but the two are nothing alike.</p>
<p>That’s ridiculous; I’m married to Your Highness Lucius.</p>
<p>He hurriedly added after sensing Freya’s question.</p>
<p>“I would have married after a brief engagement anyway.”</p>
<p>“I hadn’t considered that.”</p>
<p>Freya thought it would suffice if she just pretended to be her fiancée.</p>
<p>“I’ll compensate you for your trouble.” “What are your thoughts?”</p>
<p>“It’s not a problem that can be fixed.”</p>
<p>Freya glared angrily at the Grand Duke, who thought money would work.</p>
<p>Freya repeatedly regretted being distracted by the gold coins and entering into a hasty contract. She didn’t want to make the same mistake twice.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you ten times what you’re supposed to get from me.”</p>
<p>But Freya couldn’t come up with anything in response to Lucius’ suggestion. How many times? Freya had no idea how much it cost.</p>
<p>She believed that money would not solve all of her problems.</p>
<p>It appeared that the idea should be postponed for the time being. Lucius hesitantly whispered to her.</p>
<p>“The time frame we promised remains unchanged.”</p>
<p>“But it’s…….”</p>
<p>Freya despised him for pushing her into a corner.</p>
<p>“It won’t be any different than it is now.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“I’ll think about it for a couple of days.”</p>
<p>“More thinking will make no difference.”</p>
<p>He took a step back as Freya’s face was filled with worry. Lucius, who had overcome his impatience, continued to speak as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“Please take a seat.”</p>
<p>He brought the cloak he had placed on the tree and laid it on the grass while wiping the sweat from her brow.</p>
<p>“What exactly is it?”</p>
<p>Freya’s face hardened as it appeared to be an act for a genuine lover.</p>
<p>I’m not going to sit here.</p>
<p>Freya turned down his offer as she tried to sit away from her cloak.</p>
<p>“How can you sit on something so valuable?” “Because the grass is wet, the dress will be ruined.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my!”</p>
<p>It was difficult to continue rejecting it when it came out this way. Freya had to sit on it, but her impression was strong.</p>
<p>I’d rather appear angry.</p>
<p>She should ignore him because his kindness made her very uncomfortable. Lucius sat down as soon as she did. Freya shifted to the side when his broad shoulders touched her.</p>
<p><em>Should I just return?</em></p>
<p>This sensation of being aware of Lucius was strange. His expression pierced her heart.</p>
<p><em>Even worse, I’m not sick.</em></p>
