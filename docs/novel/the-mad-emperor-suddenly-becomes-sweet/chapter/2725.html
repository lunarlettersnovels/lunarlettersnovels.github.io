            <p>Lucius did not speak a word until he was far from Archer’s residence.</p>
<p><em>I can’t breathe…</em></p>
<p>It may seem like a leisurely walk to some people, but the reality she was dragged by Lucius away. Freya’s mind was stuffy, and her steps were heavy, all she can do was only to slow her pace.</p>
<p><em>Why is he angry?</em></p>
<p>She’s a smart girl, but she couldn’t tell.</p>
<p><em>Why is he holding her hand so tight?</em></p>
<p>Of course, there was a reason, but if they hold hands and stuff like that.</p>
<p><em>It’s like he like me at least.</em></p>
<p>Throughout the walk, Freya’s face was filled with confusion.</p>
<p><em>Where are we going, anyway?</em></p>
<p>This place was not on the side of the Imperial Palace.</p>
<p>Freya, weighed down by the heavy atmosphere, sneaked around.</p>
<p>“Oh….”</p>
<p>The sun was about to set over the lake under the high wall. She was overwhelmed by the scenery that she had never seen in months here. The strong wind fluttered the ends of her pink dress, and her brown hair danced along with the wind.</p>
<p>“Have you seen this, Your Highness? It’s really cool.”</p>
<p>Lucius stood behind Freya and spoke softly. The place where his eyes focused was not the scenery, but the view of someone.</p>
<p>“……pretty.”</p>
<p>“……?”</p>
<p>The wind was so strong that she could hardly hear his voice. Freya put her hands together and shouted.</p>
<p>“Your Highness! I can’t hear you well.”</p>
<p>A gust of wind rattled her. A few steps later, it was a place where a long cliff unfolded.</p>
<p>“Freya!”</p>
<p>For a moment, Lucius’ arms quickly wrapped around her body and the two were hugging each other for a very short time. Puffing with astonishment, she clung to Lucius’ neck and blushed. There was a subtle smell of wine in him. It was no big deal, but Freya’s heart fluttered for no reason.</p>
<p><em>It smells like alcohol. It’s what it used to grow inside the tent.….’</em></p>
<p>But why does the smell from Lucius feel so special? Freya turned her head aside, apparently conscious. But she could feel his gaze staring strongly at her cheek. Her cheeks were burning, and her neck was itchy.</p>
<p><em>Why are you looking at me like that? I wanted to quit, please.</em></p>
<p>At the same time, she wondered about his face.</p>
<p>What kind of expression will she be looking at?</p>
<p>“Come here.”</p>
<p>Lucius took her hand again and led her somewhere.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, Your Highness…….”</p>
<p>Today’s electrical charge is really strange.</p>
<p>Freya followed him with occasional steps, looking up at his side hair grazing by the wind. She thought she was going downhill for a long time and passed through a small door.</p>
<p>“Where the hell am I?”</p>
<p>How long did she walk? By the time Freya’s forehead began to sweat, she stopped.</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>The beautiful scenery she saw from above unfolded right in front of her. On the grass standing on its feet, blue gallbladder flowers bloomed gently, and there was a flock of goats grazing leisurely. And in front of it, the emerald lake was turning red.</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Lucius, who was standing next to her, sat down on the grass. She wanted to sit down, too, but she looked around for nothing.</p>
<p><em>I think Mrs. Francesca will pop out and hit me on the back if I sit anywhere.</em></p>
<p>“Sit next to me.”</p>
<p>Her hand was pulled by Lucius and she almost fell down on the grass. The puffy dress eased the shock, so it didn’t hurt much, but she screeched in surprise.</p>
<p>“You can’t pull it all of a sudden. It hurts!”</p>
<p>“You’re so loud.”</p>
<p>It was exactly what she heard when she rescued him from his injury.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’ve changed at all.”</p>
<p>Freya laughed in vain at the thought of sounding so affectionate.</p>
<p>“……?”</p>
<p>However, his body gradually tilted, and Lucius lay down on Freya’s leg.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, what is this all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Freya, startled by the touch of his cheeks through the dress and moved back.</p>
<p>“Stay like this for a second.”</p>
<p>Lucius clutched at her ankle and couldn’t let go, leaving her unmoved.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, if anyone sees you.”</p>
<p>“Nobody will doubt between us.”</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t this be too undignified?”</p>
<p>He spouted whatever came to mind to stir up Lucius somehow. Lucius, who was giggling alone at her words, turned his body. Freya, who faced him in an embarrassing position in the wind, quickly turned her head.</p>
<p>“Freya, the love of royalty and nobility is no different. If you love, you want to touch it, it wants to steal your lips.”</p>
<p>Freya’s neck turned red with the word love, and a trembling voice came out on her lips. Freya and he are not really engaged.</p>
<p>“What do you mean love? That’s nonsense. Your Highness, you’ve been drinking too much.”</p>
<p>“Freya, I can’t see your face.”</p>
<p>Lucius eventually stood up as she turned her head to avoid his eyes. Lucius drank in a hurry and his head rang and he felt nauseous.</p>
<p>“Who made me drink like this?”</p>
<p>But what was really unfair was that he couldn’t reveal his feelings. So how can the other person know his true feelings? He took his mouth off, taking care of the simmering confusion.</p>
<p>“In case you don’t know, now you are….”</p>
<p>He stood on the opposite side of Freya’s seat and chose to breathe again.</p>
<p>“You are engaged to me. Miss De Bua.” He continued.</p>
<p>“It’s just the two of us. Please sing comfortably. And I remember the contract clearly.”</p>
<p><em>Threatening in front of such beautiful nature!</em></p>
<p>Freya clicked her tongue at the sight of him, who had not a shred of romance. Regardless of what she said, Lucius lowered his eyes and took his mouth off.</p>
<p>“Freya, I banned alcohol.”</p>
<p>This was really unfair.</p>
