<p>His mother, who visited his bedroom at night, made a malicious pledge as usual.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing I can’t do for you, our prince.”</p>
<p>Hart, who covered his face with a blanket, pretended to be in a deep sleep,  but inside he was shaking. Hart also thought it would not be his mother who said such scary things.</p>
<p>“Mother, please stop saying that.”</p>
<p>He never wanted to be a prince much more than to become the crown prince.</p>
<p>Milady began to gather her forces secretly and created public opinion in favor of Hart. Milady also made unreasonable requests to the emperor, who couldn’t refuse.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you give Hart a wizard and an escort?”</p>
<p>It was unprecedented, but the emperor, blinded by love, was willing to allow it.</p>
<p>“Hart, from now on these men will protect you.”</p>
<p>“Mother, who the hell are you protecting me from?”</p>
<p>Michael, who had a strange silver-haired face, greeted him, and a man named Tom, who covered his face, thumped on the floor with a spear. Hart was afraid rather than reassured by the appearance of strange men.</p>
<p>It has become difficult to see his mother since they came to the palace. Then one night, Milady came in and whispered in his ear as he slept.</p>
<p>“I’m going to get rid of that nuisance today and give you an empire because it only belonged to you.”</p>
<p>It was such a chilling voice that Hart tried to ignore it.</p>
<p>Then that night, an unknown fire broke out in the palace and Lucius disappeared. The emperor ordered the whole of Morsiani to search for the crown prince.</p>
<p>They didn’t find Lucius’ body. But when Hart thought of his mother’s voice, he knew she was behind it.</p>
<p>When he found Lucius’ room with only black ashes, he knelt down and cried. He knew clearly what a terrible curse his mother had made, but he couldn’t stop anything. He may also be responsible for the tragedy, after all.</p>
<p>“Nothing has changed since then and now.” Hart’s face, which recalled the past, was ridiculed.</p>
<p>“Ha, what should I do if my mother continues to be greedy?”</p>
<p>Although he was nicknamed “the Fool,” Hart did not know what was going on with the empire. Milady has committed countless crimes on the name of his behalf.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see anyone get hurt anymore.”</p>
<p>Miss De Bua’s’ smile, which was smiling brightly while they were eating bread together, came up strangely on his mind.</p>
<p>“Whoever it is.”</p>
<p>The bottle fell from his hand, which was leaning uncomfortably on the sofa, and soon unstable breathing filled the room.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Freya’s class was canceled due to the sudden circumstances of the teacher in charge of the poetry class.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen such a good thing in my life!”’</p>
<p>After a long break, Freya wondered what to do. At that moment, she decided to take a walk with Hero, who visited her. The weather was sunny and as they strolled together, a story in her mind came out naturally.</p>
<p>“His Majesty Lucius is sometimes hard to understand.”</p>
<p>“That would be the same for everyone.”</p>
<p>His Highness Lucius was clearly full of the capability to lead the Morsiani Empire. He had excellent leadership, bold determination, and quick drive.</p>
<p>“But I don’t know much about people.”</p>
<p>Freya is in a lot of thought, and Hero, who was hesitating for a long time, spoke up.</p>
<p>“But Freya, in the past, His Highness Lucius was quite different.”</p>
<p>About five years ago, Lucius’ personality changed greatly after a fire broke out, and went through a big deal.</p>
<p>“Really? I think it’s a little better than the beginning.”</p>
<p>Freya remembered the moment when she first met Prince Lucius in the barracks.</p>
<p>“I heard you’re preparing for an engagement ball,” Hero asked.</p>
<p>“That’s why I can’t sleep well these days.”</p>
<p>Hero carefully collected the fruit from the tree. Freya, who was hanging around the tree, sighed deeply. It’s nerve-wracking to cheat a lot of aristocrats, and there’s an engagement ball.</p>
<p><em>And how much more to do.</em></p>
<p>The tailor stopped by to match the dress day after day, and the jeweler visited and recommended this and that.</p>
<p>‘Your Highness, there are already so many dresses in the closet.’</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t listen to her, although Freya conveyed that she didn’t need a new dress.</p>
<p>‘Are you going to harm my dignity?’</p>
<p>Such cool words raged her complaints.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know I’d Miss Pierre,” Freya murmured.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I couldn’t be of any help,” Hero smiled and comforted her with a tearful smile.</p>
<p>“Your Highness said that he will not let you go to the engagement party if you were humiliated by me.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it just a joke?”</p>
<p>“It can’t be a joke.”</p>
<p>After collecting, he tilted his head.</p>
<p>Freya didn’t want to look good in public, but she didn’t want to be publicly humiliated.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry too much. I’m practicing hard.”</p>
<p>“Still, Freya. You’re doing very well.”</p>
<p>“……Thank you, Hero.”</p>
<p>The sweetest person she had ever met would be Hero. Plus the good looks and personality. In addition, his talent as a wizard was terrific. Hero shrugged at Freya’s sincere words.</p>
<p>“As I said, I’m probably the most popular in the palace.”</p>
<p>Freya grinned at his words. It was also true. When Hero passes by, he gets a lot of glances and looks at him.</p>
<p>“If it were someone else, I wouldn’t have been lucky.”’</p>
<p>Hero didn’t hate being sly and condescending at all.</p>
<p>“Shh! I’m afraid Mrs. Francesca will hear you.”</p>
<p>The ridiculous look on his face made her laugh again.</p>
<p>“Hero you are really nice person.”</p>
<p>Freya murmured softly, barely holding back her laughter. Then the little flowers in the bushes drew my eyes.</p>
<p>“There are flowers here, too.”</p>
<p>It was very cute to see small white flowers huddled together. At the same time, she was distracted by the flowers, and Hero’s impression hardened by the sudden spasm in his arm.</p>
<p><em>……Damn it.</em></p>
<p>Hiding behind the tree quickly, Hero lifted his sleeve. The black letters on his arms wriggled as if they were alive. The pain seemed to warp bones all over.</p>
<p>“Ugh….”</p>
<p>“Hero! Hero! I found a lucky rabbitfish.”</p>
<p>Freya popped her head in and held out something. Hero, who grabbed it by surprise, looked puzzled.</p>
