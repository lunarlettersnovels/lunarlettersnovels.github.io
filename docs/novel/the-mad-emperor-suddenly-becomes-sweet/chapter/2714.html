            <p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="5e420e5d-c7cd-41fe-926a-daade89bd69d">Lucius left his work at noon and walked over to see Freya’s face. He thought he could do a better job, but it was purely his illusion. Lucius missed the questions several times during the meeting, and he looked blank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="41136198-5e03-4923-956d-e5464960dbf5"><em>Would she like it if I taught her how to dance?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="712d692e-e8a3-47a4-8812-1df42397fa8c">He is sure she will be surprised. She may not like it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="cc4ac13c-2f1a-417a-8c74-0301984e66e2"><em>Yes, she will.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="11f9ee2f-f1e6-4ef2-b88c-38754752718d">She may want to learn more from others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="e7199948-7106-49f1-907c-f4cb0cd66560">Her moderate distancing from him was oddly reassuring and disturbing at the same time. After the meeting, he hurried to find Freya’s room, but she was not there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="46f5706d-c2f5-4d4b-b260-d89ebdd6adfd">“Did she leave to see another man?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="2f968c4c-17d4-4a47-8fba-b5a4a6f65e1d">There was no qualification that could be used to force her. When he asked the maid who was cleaning the room, she tilted her head. She said Freya refused to eat and said she would go for a walk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="cdb0bd2f-a314-4ce8-88a4-acdd6c9f5fac">“But she likes to eat.” Lucius wondered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="d22cec04-fb5e-4731-83c7-d83e8af8f7a1">To refuse it, something must have happened. Trying to find Freya, Lucius searched the garden like a mouse. Just in case, she stopped by here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="be73f774-c605-43a6-ad2a-8263aae78698">It’s rattling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="5ab8b1fe-bc55-4183-bd27-ce9bed6fe13b">She was trying to grab a jar of jam on the shelf when she stepped on a box. The woman’s coveted brown hair was sticking out from under her cape.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="49fdc231-6cbf-46d5-825a-7d2be03149da">“Let’s just go back.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="cf99b5c7-0e1d-47c1-8bae-d9a967c6dfdd">Although there were no people, it was better not to be seen with Freya in such a public place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="9eb12859-37e7-4e13-8dce-437523aac970"><em>If Freya wants to stay safe.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="2311c3f8-9df0-42fd-b789-a541b59f7f41">But when he saw the box she stepped on shake, Lucius had no time to think about anything else. Lucius, who jumped into the kitchen, stopped her from rolling on the floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="d607506a-b696-49bf-8f04-31ee0fe67f27"><span class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-error-main hover:bg-error-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline" data-issueid="5173474f67d35eff2665c53f381c50ef"><em>Ah</em></span><em>…</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="1400fce9-8498-47ad-8b7f-d1bce450df97">Why doesn’t it always work out the way he wants it to?</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="5fb49fc7-1f31-45b0-9f8e-396b7bb845e2">Lucius had to stay away from her, but he couldn’t. He saw Freya’s cheeks burning red in his arms. When he looked at Freya, who had been sitting at the table, he met a pair of eyes as if he were about to attack. Embarrassed, he uttered the wrong words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="a9e655d1-ef77-4b55-82cd-7cd160617e57">“Well done to you. Because I’m hungry, too.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="82f4953d-4995-44c5-ac64-b6ea91d458af">“What?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="8cb25666-5411-4b47-aa15-0742fbcc44e4">A maid who was passing through the hallway entered the kitchen because of a loud noise that could be heard outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="0fa3ebd2-1650-4091-b7d8-bba4dc6d907f">“Your highness, don’t eat in such a shabby place. Come up, I’ll prepare a meal soon.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="19fc0973-c001-4f4e-afac-b8457bf434ef">Lucius waved his hand at the maid’s words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="3664cd8f-f05d-4516-9633-d3a064ef2012">“No, everybody gets out. Today, Miss De Bua is preparing to show off her skills for me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="85978f6e-d272-4279-ae4c-0249fb6f1dab">“……!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="83f7e7b5-fa00-4cb7-9ece-e9b6b0739966">At his words, Freya opened her mouth wide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="13933218-814c-45db-958c-d0998d9f0e3d">She only learned it for a few months, but she had never heard of a noble lady working in the kitchen. Most of them wore stylish dresses, drank tea leisurely, or watched performances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="5d1d6367-1616-4ca2-b18e-66836e4287cf"><em>I’m sure he meant to humiliate you, </em>Freya murmured.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="7565ac0d-a479-47b1-a1db-1cf9dd95813a">So, instead of kissing people when his Majesty comes and departs, he kicks out the dance teacher and makes a ridiculous threat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="5a76e695-07d5-4a13-ac90-19a03aa2f170"><em>I’m willing to accept the challenge, Your Highness.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="d4c378d8-cd3d-4ca0-bf34-5a054b10ae60">She’s not the real Miss de Bua, she’s Freya.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="0d37a694-42f0-489b-9cc0-8e4ced8df6b1">Her green eyes were blazing <span class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-error-main hover:bg-error-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline" data-issueid="c4cee89df2bd8e9dfcffca5fbc2332f0">with the will.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="755085af-c60f-4c2b-ad2d-36b7a5af5275">“It’s an honor for me, Your Highness. In Del Mundo, we have quite a few aristocrats who can cook.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="8910ac90-5604-42a1-9da3-fbd4cefae1c3">The maid, frightened by Freya’s nerd, disappeared quickly outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="cd4ccb45-8f7d-4121-9432-7a8e83f62675">“Let’s see.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="5b19ee76-6fbc-4c8e-bfe6-67d5f6c4535e">She rolled up her arms and looked around the kitchen. She wasn’t really confident. There was an old lady in the orphanage who was in charge of the kitchen, and Freya only did small chores from time to time. Still, she remembered a dish that she saw over her shoulder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="0d527987-9a48-4337-a1f2-83c6b68c061e">There’s bread, jam, potatoes, and some meat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="bba92cda-ec35-4156-9439-77f642e86173">“I will prepare Del Mundo porridge for you. I could function with my eyes closed.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="c34a3aef-dda1-4666-a53c-b3cb9ea02e7b">“I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="c9095085-397e-41aa-aa56-6fc33632c35a">As she began to cook, Lucius sat at the table across from her and laid his hands under his chin. Freya was upset by his sudden request.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="7c23d124-1253-4b7b-8f17-ee0717a3478b">“Are you watching because you don’t want me to make something that you can’t eat?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="9f838a75-631b-4535-986c-aa842401a74a">Freya tried to ignore his gaze. Immediately, she poured water into the pot in the oven and began to boil. After peeling the potato, she put it in a pot with the meat and stirred it to a boil. When the meat was done, the bread was crushed into small pieces and sprinkled with salt. It didn’t take long to prepare the dish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="7b317e3a-8e43-492f-a5ea-64ec765ea74a">“Your Highness, please eat.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="923062b5-08ac-4940-846c-d25bcd75eda0"><span class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition cursor-pointer decoration-error-main hover:bg-error-lightest" data-testid="issue-underline" data-issueid="87e469d10638774ff0208ed67f7a9ff7">“…….”</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="b580a177-c8c4-415b-8d9e-cada41928ecd">Steam erupted from the unidentified porridge in front of Lucius.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="fd0de03e-19fe-494b-9482-2edfdde1dd2e">“Freya, what’s the name of this dish?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="da24e45a-6bad-4f04-8f70-152eb87aae83">“Del Mundo’s special porridge.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="feb27826-2b55-43ee-9cc4-e8e4c86381dc">Freya, sitting across from him, held out a coarse wooden spoon. Then Freya broke the bread without saying a word, dipped it in the porridge, and began to eat it. Lucius, who was slightly offended by the appearance, opened his mouth in a small voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="9d85635e-5f4d-44a3-af70-367774539b86">“You didn’t even tell me to eat it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="632757df-7de5-4ade-96a5-df5ab013fa18">“You don’t even say thank you for making it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="7c25fccc-a8d0-4a7b-b9d0-6b475533832e">Freya shrugged and ate porridge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="cb5f8f88-cd6c-4a72-9220-1938785073b6">Lucius was embarrassed for no reason because she was all right. Freya must have been too excited to make something for him. Now that he had come to say hello, he coughed briefly, embarrassed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="0622bf39-a1fb-44a2-8134-083594d1e574">“Thank you for the food.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="2b290cdb-8cc3-4d12-92ec-b18fbaf1d422">Lucius was unable to speak for a moment after eating porridge with a spoon. Lucius was unable to speak for a moment. The familiar taste reminded him of that gloomy building he thought he had forgotten. It was definitely delicious and savory, but it was incomparable to that time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="84f5e9d3-9078-490a-bcd3-ea04f3033303"><em>I ate something that didn’t even look like food.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="73021d3c-b874-4feb-8b13-71a28bc0388f">It was common in the orphanage to eat moldy or spoiled food.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="2f7609ad-1e43-4fa2-97ee-7fbcebb8da73">In fact, Lucius remembered Freya, but he couldn’t remember the whole past. Because the drug that was given to him was just awful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="032d26db-6f40-4bde-8f06-dca5a6cb7116">Hero’s voice, which was shouting on the day Lucius ran away from the palace, was vivid in his ears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="51a020a2-5632-41ab-a605-2f87d01ac5a3">‘Your Highness, please stay away for a moment. Then I will persuade Count Diverto to come and get you.’</p>

<p class="mb-2.5" data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="0e864b47-3d93-4877-9bce-1a09c5540870">The odds were even.</p>
