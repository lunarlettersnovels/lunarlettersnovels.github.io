            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you talking like that?” asked Freya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Freya, I’m still not finished.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not finished with what?” She retreated to lean against the wall, avoiding Lucius, who was staring only at her lips. Sitting on top of the bed with his knees bent, Lucius slowly undid his shirt. As soon as he pulled it off, his solid chest was exposed, revealing a perfect balance of well-toned muscles. Freya, her throat bone dry now, could barely manage, “Why are you taking your clothes off?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s too hot in here,” he said jokingly, and Freya’s eyebrows shot up at the ridiculous reply. Reading her mood, Lucius fanned himself with his hand again. “What is it with me today? I don’t know what’s going on.” Lucius nimbly lowered his eyes, and his gorgeous eyelashes fluttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was wondering the same thing,” Freya replied, staring at him as he scratched his neck with his big hand and slowly rubbed his chest. The area around his neck, which he’d touched, turned reddish, and thick drops of sweat trickled down to his collarbone. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is crazy. I can’t take my eyes off of him!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it was obvious that she would fall for his seduction eventually, Freya felt like a butterfly caught in a spider’s web because she couldn’t turn her gaze away from his gorgeous eyes and attractive body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Freya. What’s that look in your eyes?” He asked quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What look?” Freya hesitated for a moment, weighing up what she still had to do today. If she was going to go back tomorrow, she had to pack her things and go to bed early, to be well-rested for the carriage trip. She didn’t want to hide her feelings from him now, and after her lips had quivered for a while, a suffocating voice leaked out through them, “My Lucius is so handsome. I miss you even though I’m looking at you now.” Lucius didn’t say a word at her candid confession. Perhaps embarrassed, his neck and face had reddened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re really…” Unable to speak further, Lucius leaned over and approached her, his muscles under his broad shoulders flexing as he moved. “Freya, I am trying to hold myself back,” his voice lowered, and he paused at Freya’s lips, looking deeply into her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hold yourself back from what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius Morciani was never one to hold himself back from showing affection. When Freya grumbled, his hot breath touched her ear, “You want to know how long I’ve been enduring? Since this morning, when I saw you open your eyes, and then when you drank your tea. Then again, when we did the dishes together and also when we were pulling weeds out together. And then finally, when I touched you earlier. I held myself back the whole time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop! Stop it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In other words, I have endured it all day, holding myself back from you. Now, do you know what you have to give me?” Lucius, saying these strange things with such insidious eyes, was very unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What am I supposed to give you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A reward for my all-day efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve never seen you like this before. You’re behaving like an animal!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius had no physical reaction to her words and only blinked leisurely, “Freya, then I want to do as an animal does.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her back against the ice-cold wall, Freya shook like a deer that was trapped. “There is still so much to do today since we have to leave tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freya’s words sounded like gibberish to him as she turned a blind eye to the obvious desire burning in his eyes. It hadn’t been just once or twice that she’d fallen for his pretty face and couldn’t focus on what she needed to do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius, however, didn’t look like he wanted to hear what she had to say, “This is all we have to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His large hands lifted her dress, and despite only having her legs exposed, Freya couldn’t control her excitement. Lucius moved quickly, and in one swift movement, she was left with only her lingerie on, with her chest completely exposed. She wasn’t even completely naked, but somehow, feeling bashful, she then covered her chest with her arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t cover yourself. You’re so beautiful,” Lucius muttered with a hoarse voice as he speedily removed his pants. Admiring his sexy naked body, Freya groaned. At this point, she was nervous, and seeing him kneeling on the bed was overly suggestive. Clear liquid dripped from the head of his manhood, which was now hard from excitement, looking as if it would burst at any moment. Freya’s chest felt like it was about to explode as she looked at his inviting erection, feeling weak with desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come here, Freya.” His tone was like black magic. Freya, fascinated by his blue eyes shining even in the dark, made her way toward him. “You’re so kind, Freya.” His fingers slid gently through her hair, and then he undid her lingerie. Soon after that, Lucius put his arms around her waist and lifted her onto his lap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh!” Something slippery came out of her body and made a sloshing sound as soon as she plopped down onto his lap. Biting her bottom lip, she began to move back and forth as she wanted the excitement to spread a little more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lucius,” she whispered lustfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.” His eyes were bloodshot, but the way he pretended to be calm and open his mouth was so cheeky. It was he who’d kissed her so passionately and undressed her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t think I don’t know that you’re trying to make me say that I want to? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But love naturally included being deceived at least once, and so she decided to say the words that he wanted to hear, “Lucius, make love to me right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Freya. You really might regret it.” His teasing voice filled Freya’s ears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lying on the bed, still hugging him, she rubbed his rock-hard muscles and muttered, “I think I’ll regret it if you don’t make love to me today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh? Really?” Lucius, who now held her hands tightly above her head, kissed her neck and shoulders gently with his soft wet lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freya could no longer relax as his lips traveled down to her bre*sts, and she moaned loudly, “Oh, that makes me feel good.”</span></p>
