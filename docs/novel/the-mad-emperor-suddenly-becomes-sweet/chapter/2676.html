            <p>“Why?” Lucius asked.</p>
<p>“There was a reason why he couldn’t identify himself then,” he explained, hoping to defend himself. “I didn’t mean to cheat. I’m telling you.”</p>
<p>Freya couldn’t believe what she was hearing.</p>
<p>“Now it doesn’t matter whether it’s true or not. We are not children who enjoyed playing house,” she replied coldly.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Lucius again, Freya was overwhelmed with a feeling of love. She realized too late that she had fallen for him without even knowing what it was. She felt trapped in a fever that had no safe way out. At times, Freya imagined how nice it would be if she were really Miss De Bua, but she knew that it was nothing more than pathetic wishful thinking. It was no different from the imaginary games she played during the orphanage’s sponsorship.</p>
<p>“You are not Ruth. Ruth is sleeping there forever,” Freya said, finally coming to terms with the reality of her situation.</p>
<p>Lucius understood how much he had hurt Freya, and his shoulders trembled as he listened to her. He held onto her neck and wrist with both hands and gave her strength.</p>
<p>“You can hate me, or you can forget about me in the past,” he told her.</p>
<p>“Why do you keep saying it doesn’t matter?” Freya asked, confused by his behavior.</p>
<p>Lucius had no idea how much Freya cared for him, and he was acting strangely because of it.</p>
<p>“Because I won’t let you go,” he said determinedly.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Our relationship is almost over,” Freya pointed out.</p>
<p>“Yes. Miss De Bua and Prince Lucius are done, and now we start anew with me and you,” Lucius replied, trying to salvage their relationship.</p>
<p>“It’s crazy,” Freya responded, overwhelmed by the intensity of his emotions.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m completely crazy about you,” Lucius admitted.</p>
<p>Freya was about to burst into tears at his desperate emotional appeal.</p>
<p>“Freya, I want to give you me,” Lucius said, hoping to convey his feelings to her.</p>
<p>She couldn’t understand why Lucius looked so sad now.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to give me anything. Don’t do this,” Freya pleaded with him.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to refuse, push me like this,” Lucius said, feeling like a coward.</p>
<p>“It’s cowardly,” Freya agreed.</p>
<p>As Freya scuffed away from him, Lucius’ shirt opened, revealing his chest covered in wounds. She almost reopened one of the wounds as she touched it.</p>
<p>“There’s no way I could hurt you,” she told him.</p>
<p>Lucius gave a faint smile in response. “I could be even more cowardly if it meant having you.”</p>
<p>His gestures and words, completely blinded by love, made her dizzy. But she needed to stay focused.</p>
<p><em>I’ll be leaving soon, so I need to stay strong. Stop looking at the handsome Lucius, </em>she thought to herself.</p>
<p>It was too dangerous to be alone with Lucius, who looked hundreds of times more attractive than usual. Freya’s mouth was so dry that it was hard to swallow. She lifted her arm that was not caught by him and tried to push Lucius’ chest slightly, but even her wrist was caught.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to push me away? Huh? I’m sick right now.”</p>
<p>His blue eyes, which sounded like they were about to cry, were moist. Lucius, who was about to burst into tears, barely warmed his mouth.</p>
<p>“Since then, you’ve been the only one for me. Freya.”</p>
<p>Moon-shaped ornaments hung from his neck, said to be relics of the late Empress.</p>
<p>Freya muttered to herself, looking at it for a long time as if possessed by its glare.</p>
<p><em>I’ll forget all about him, so wouldn’t it be okay? </em>she thought.</p>
<p>The desire that now flowed through her whole body was not false.</p>
<p>Lucius, who felt the strength of Freya’s hand slowly loosen, asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Are you giving me permission?”</p>
<p>Lucius’ hand, which had held her strongly, fell helplessly down. Freya pushed his unbroken shoulder slightly with one arm behind him.</p>
<p>“Freya.”</p>
<p>“You said you couldn’t bite what you spit out.”</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled as she stared at Lucius, whose face was red. Freya carefully removed his shirt and swept away the old scars.</p>
<p>“It must have hurt.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who was struggling to catch his breath, stopped Freya with his hands.</p>
<p>“Stop, stop. I think I’m going to die at this rate.”</p>
<p>He was so confident when they kissed and did more. Freya touched his bare body and felt as if she was about to faint.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, even if you faint.”</p>
<p>Her hands moved freely as her heart commanded her to. Freya’s eyes slid down the man’s beautiful features, from his eyes to his nose, neck, shoulders, and chest.</p>
<p><em>I can’t love anyone else anymore.</em></p>
<p>She wouldn’t be able to find someone as lovely as Lucius. When she thought about it like that, she felt regret for this night.</p>
<p>“Ugghhh…”</p>
<p>Lucius, trembling under her touch, jumped up and tore Freya’s shirt. Her inside revealed a hideous wound on the body underneath. Sophia’s whip marks covered her back, chest, stomach, and legs.</p>
<p>“Freya, I promise. I won’t hurt you anymore.”</p>
<p>His big hand gently swept away each of Freya’s wounds. Freya also reached out and smoothed the wound on his body. She didn’t know why she was crying like this.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry.”</p>
<p>As soon as her shirt loosened her breast knot, Freya’s shoulders were revealed in the moonlight. Lucius’ lips slowly touched her shoulders, and the two tear-stained faces intertwined. The wooden bed bumped against the wall, filling the room with a dull thud and harsh breathing sounds all night.</p>
