            <p>Archer threw a nut at Freya and said, “It doesn’t suit you to be discouraged.” He then winced with a playful grin.</p>
<p>Freya rubbed her forehead and laughed, “What are you doing to a sick person?”</p>
<p>Archer replied, “People like us just wash with cold water and eat slightly spoiled meat, and we’re okay.”</p>
<p>Freya asked, “Take me out of the pack.”</p>
<p>Archer responded, “We’re relatives, and we can’t do that.”</p>
<p>Archer continued, “I’ll find the best way, so don’t worry too much. Let’s put off tomorrow’s work until tomorrow, and let’s eat and drink today.”</p>
<p>Freya was reminded of Lucius’ words not to drink, but today she couldn’t resist. She replied, “Yeah, it doesn’t mean you’re going to have a sharp number just because you don’t think about it.”</p>
<p>Archer said, “Look, I only have a headache.”</p>
<p>Freya replied, “Yes, I’ve become super strong! I’m not afraid of them at all.”</p>
<p>Archer teased, “There’s someone standing behind you, what are you afraid of?”</p>
<p>Freya retorted, “Archer is really strong!”</p>
<p>Archer chuckled, “Well, then there’s the only muscle in this body.”</p>
<p>The two encouraged each other, clinking their wooden glasses. Freya remembered her first time making a loud noise at Archer’s barracks.</p>
<p>Archer said, “He’s a very thankful person.”</p>
<p>Freya replied, tears streaming down her cheeks, “Archer, did you spill alcohol on your face?”</p>
<p>Archer was taken aback, “Freya, this is tears.” He asked, “Why are you crying after eating and drinking well?”</p>
<p>Freya replied, “Just because. I appreciate everything.”</p>
<p>Archer, embarrassed, scratched the back of his head and finished his drink. He was indeed a man who matched chicken legs with alcohol.</p>
<p>She slammed her head on the table, slurring her words. “I’ll buy you a whole chicken cart if you succeed later.” The alcohol dulled the pain, and she chuckled. “Ah, Archer. I’m going to take a nap.” Alcohol was a strange liquid—bitter to drink, yet exciting. “I’m Archer’s daughter if I drink again. Daughter!” she hugged her head and looked around the unfamiliar room.</p>
<p>“Bell, where are we?” Freya reached for a glass of water, but no one answered her call. She sat up, groggy.</p>
<p>“Miriam, give me some water.” In the dark room, she heard a voice. “Lucius, your Highness?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me.” Lucius was by her bedside, holding a glass of water. He sat next to her, and she drank it eagerly. One side of the bed sank, and she leaned towards him.</p>
<p>“Where am I? This doesn’t look like the palace.” “This is my private place,” Lucius replied.</p>
<p>Freya felt uneasy. “Can I be here?” She didn’t want to be caught up in the prince’s secrets.</p>
<p>“It’s okay because it’s you.” Lucius’ eyes were persistent. “What do you think of me?”</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine you’re not the prince,” Freya answered. “You’re like a cat,” she added, feeling bold in the dream-like state. “Yes, you have a cute face, like a cat.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere was calm and comfortable, unlike in the palace, and she felt like she was talking to a friend.</p>
<p>Freya’s voice was shaking, but Lucius’ eyes were deep and dark. “But you’re the one who made me want to.” Lucius brought his face closer, his breath touching Freya’s cheeks. She could feel the heat coming from his body, and she couldn’t help but lean toward him.</p>
<p>“Lucius, what are you doing? I want to keep this feeling forever.” His voice was gentle, but his eyes were blazing. Freya felt like she was melting, and she was captured by Lucius’ gaze.</p>
<p>“Freya, will you stay with me? I-I can’t. This is not appropriate. I don’t care. I just want you by my side.” Freya’s heart was pounding, and she was struggling to keep her composure. She didn’t know what to do, but she knew she couldn’t just stay there like this.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please let go of me.”</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t seem to be listening, and his eyes were getting closer and closer. Freya felt like she was drowning, and she didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>“Lucius, please stop.” At her plea, Lucius finally released her, and Freya breathed a sigh of relief. She looked at Lucius, and she could see the regret and sadness in his eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Freya. I shouldn’t have acted like that.”</p>
