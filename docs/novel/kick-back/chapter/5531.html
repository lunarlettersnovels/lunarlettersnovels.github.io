            <p>In Sodom, entertainment always comes with violence and s*x.</p>
<p>Inside the iron cage, a Tosa and a Pit Bull snarled and bared their teeth. The moment the referee’s whistle blew, the choke chains were released.</p>
<p>The two beasts lunged at each other, bred solely for fighting from birth. Violence was in their blood, sharpened by human hands that had trained them to kill on command.</p>
<p>Before the fight began, the spectators had already placed their bets, shouting hoarse encouragements that bordered on madness.</p>
<p>“Come on! Bite harder! Tear him apart!”</p>
<p>“I put a fortune on you, don’t you dare lose!”</p>
<p>None of it sounded remotely human.</p>
<p>Go Hee-seong shook his head slowly. Madness knew no race or age.</p>
<p>There were a few cities where exiles, those branded traitors by their own nations, had gathered. Each city had its own flavor, its own sickness. Among them, Sodom was the sewer where humanity’s cruelty and depravity flowed together.</p>
<p>In an era like this, only the savage and ruthless survived, just like the undefeated champion about to appear.</p>
<p>Most had bet on the Pit Bull, famed for its power and aggression. Tonight, the lucky few who’d backed it would walk away rich.</p>
<p>Go Hee-seong watched as the Tosa seized the Pit Bull by the neck, shaking it violently until its flesh tore. Then he turned away and left the arena.</p>
<p>He climbed the steel stairs and entered a restricted door meant only for staff. A dim corridor stretched ahead, ending at a curtained room that served as a waiting area.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>When he pulled the curtain aside, a familiar scene unfolded.</p>
<p>A man sat sprawled on the sofa, his broad arms draped along the backrest, head tilted lazily. A woman knelt at his feet.</p>
<p>Even without seeing clearly, the situation was obvious. Go Hee-seong’s eyes narrowed. The man’s reputation for excess preceded him, and nothing in his manner suggested shame or surprise.</p>
<p>Go Hee-seong cleared his throat loudly.</p>
<p>At the sound, the man’s square jaw tilted his way. Deep-set eyes lifted slowly, carrying a languid, almost predatory air.</p>
<p>For someone who always looked bored and detached, his presence still pulsed with something volatile, desire, violence, or both.</p>
<p>“About today’s job…”</p>
<p>His voice cut through the tense air. The woman froze at the sudden sound, startled. But the man placed a hand on her shoulder, forcing her to stay still.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The woman groaned as the head pierced her windpipe, trying to throw her head back in pain. But Do Sagyeom, clutching her curly hair, moved his hand back and forth, as if masturbating.</p>
<p>“Honey, if you’re begging me to suck your dick, then… suck it properly. Or are you just trying to trick your lover into winning?”</p>
<p>At Do Sagyeom’s words, Go Hee-seong finally realized who the woman was.</p>
<p>The lover Do Sagyeom had mentioned was the one competing against him in this match. His face was covered in tattoos, making him look even more out of place, and he was well over two meters tall. Dosa-gyeom was tall, but he wasn’t even close to two meters.</p>
<p>But Go Hee-seong wasn’t particularly worried. If anything, it was the woman he was using as a s*x toy.</p>
<p>Well, she was the one who had been relentlessly pursuing and seducing the opposing player, leaving her lover behind. There was nothing to feel sorry for, was there?</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Finally, the man, having fully penetrated the woman’s throat, let out a faint moan through his clenched teeth.</p>
<p>“Haa, hmph…”</p>
<p>The woman couldn’t finish Dosa-gyeom’s semen, dripping down her chin. She wiped her face with a tissue from the table, showing no sign of shame at the sight of Go Hee-seong.</p>
<p>“Honey, when you come back victorious, I’ll make you tingle between my legs too.”</p>
<p>The woman, with her smooth English pronunciation and charming bronzed skin, blew a hand kiss and cheered on the man who had just treated her so rudely. He knew those words were no different from wishing for the death of his true love.</p>
<p>Go Hee-seong clicked his tongue as he listened to the woman’s shoes disappearing beyond the curtain.</p>
<p>“So, what’s the request?”</p>
<p>“It’s asking you to protect some girl.”</p>
<p>“You put the request in the wrong place.”</p>
<p>Do Sa-gyeom shrugged and took a sip of beer from the table.</p>
<p>“I’m good at killing and plundering, not guarding. Especially not children.”</p>
<p>“Not children. They’re just barely adults. And the pay is substantial. You’ll be surprised.”</p>
