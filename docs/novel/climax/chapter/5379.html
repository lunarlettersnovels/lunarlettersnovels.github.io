            <p><strong>Chapter 26.2</strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time Yeon-ha had done this. Even as a child, she’d sometimes save up her small allowance only to splurge on snacks and eat them all at once. Back then, at least, she had limits.</p>
<p>She had spent her savings impulsively, and sometimes, when she couldn’t afford snacks, she’d cook several packets of instant noodles and force them down. It often ended with an upset stomach and days of regret. The act felt oddly satisfying in the moment but always left her questioning herself later.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why she did it, nor did she ever think to analyze it. It wasn’t something she considered strange, and even now, her only concern was the embarrassment of being caught by Min-gyu—not the reason behind her actions. After all, it had never caused any real problems before.</p>
<p>As she wandered aimlessly, her steps halted in front of a bright yellow flower in the yard. Its long, slender stem caught her attention, and she reached out to touch it lightly.</p>
<p><em>Did Min-gyu come back early?</em></p>
<p>Though the evening approached, the sunlight still bathed the yard in warmth. The vibrant blooms felt bittersweet—beautiful yet inexplicably melancholic. She absentmindedly traced the petals until a familiar voice broke her thoughts.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Startled, Yeon-ha pulled her hand back and turned to see Min-gyu walking toward her in casual clothes, his damp hair and freshly washed face betraying his recent shower. She quickly looked away, her gaze returning to the flower as her heart raced.</p>
<p>“You look like you’re about to tear that flower apart,” he teased.</p>
<p>“What? No,” she muttered, frowning at the absurd remark.</p>
<p>He smirked and continued, “You know, you haven’t said a word to me since I got back.”</p>
<p>She stayed silent, pretending to focus on the flower.</p>
<p>“Do you like flowers? Should we go see some tomorrow?”</p>
<p>His question caught her off guard. She hesitated before shaking her head. “No.”</p>
<p>“What, you don’t like flowers?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that,” she replied, avoiding his gaze. “You’ve got work tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“So you <em>do</em> want to go. Just say it,” he pressed, his tone playful but insistent.</p>
<p>Before she could respond, he bent down to pick up an empty bottle that had somehow ended up in the yard. Watching him clean up made her uneasy.</p>
<p>“Give it to me,” she blurted out. “I’ll throw it away.”</p>
<p>Min-gyu let out a sharp breath and, as if to dismiss her offer, tossed the bottle into the distant black recycling bin. It landed perfectly with a crisp clang. Turning back, he met her gaze again, unbothered and steady. This time, Yeon-ha didn’t look away.</p>
<p>Amid the burst of spring blossoms, their eyes lingered, slow and searching.</p>
<p>Her breath felt a little heavier, though she couldn’t say why.</p>
<p>At first, she had only found him intimidating—his rough demeanor and imposing frame made her reluctant to even meet his eyes. She’d been scared, plain and simple.</p>
<p>But now, after shared conversations and fleeting touches, something in him felt different. The faint, lazy smile that rested on his face stirred something unfamiliar in her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” she blurted out, surprising even herself.</p>
<p>“For what?” he asked, tilting his head slightly.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha pressed her lips together, unsure how to explain. Maybe it was guilt—something small but persistent surfacing from within. A vague sense of owing him, magnified by the languid ease of the spring air.</p>
<p>“If you haven’t done anything wrong, don’t throw around apologies,” he said after a pause, his casual tone soft but firm. “It’s a habit you don’t need.”</p>
<p>Her words dried up, leaving her staring at the vibrant yellow flower before her. She felt like she should say something more, but no words came to mind.</p>
<p>The yard grew dimmer as twilight crept in. While Yeon-ha’s gaze stayed on the flower, Min-gyu’s never wavered from her.</p>
<p>And then, her eyes widened.</p>
