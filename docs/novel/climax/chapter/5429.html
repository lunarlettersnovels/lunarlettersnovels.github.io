            <p><strong>Chapter 1.1</strong></p>
<p>I am a parasite to him.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Although it was spring, the night drenched by a sudden shower was cold, unlike the dark and quiet space that still retained residual heat.</p>
<p>His slender face, breathing heavily, still had an oddly excited look. The man who had been nibbling on the soft nape of her neck lifted his head slightly. Even in the dim light, he stared at the familiar face, which appeared clear to him, and impulsively kissed it.</p>
<p>The sound of hurried breaths mingling filled the air.</p>
<p>His tongue, not moving much otherwise, wrapped around hers and rubbed against it greedily. Despite twisting her head at the overwhelming wetness filling her mouth, it was to no avail. There was nothing delicate in the way he sucked on the base of her tongue and traced her palate. It was a rough, almost devouring kiss that could never be described as tender.</p>
<p>After tying the cond.om, the man once again put his weight on her. The sloppy kiss was distinctly different from the restrained passion he had exhibited earlier when he had fiercely suppressed his desire to ravage.</p>
<p>Even after pressing their lips together for a while as if to release something unsatisfied, he did not let go of her. He just stared intently at her small, seemingly tired face as if absorbed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his large hand slowly stroked her bare waist a few times. As he enjoyed the sensation of her soft skin, he eventually gripped her buttocks, causing her to squirm lightly under the weight of his warm body.</p>
<p>“Why.”</p>
<p>At the low, resonant voice, she paused for a moment before parting her lips. Though somewhat accustomed to it now, Kwon Min-kyu’s mere words had a way of making people flinch.</p>
<p>“…I want to wash up.”</p>
<p>There was no strength in the faint sound that escaped her. His lips twisted slightly at the sight of her avoiding his gaze. “Yes, you should wash up…” he replied, but he didn’t remove his hand from her soft skin. His black eyes, still staring intently at her defenseless face, remained the same. When his tongue sensually licked her ear, she flinched involuntarily.</p>
<p>“Why are you pulling away?”</p>
<p>She frowned slightly at the laughter near her ear. Who wouldn’t react like that if such a sensitive part was touched?</p>
<p>“I’m cold.”</p>
<p>“Cold?”</p>
<p>At her casual words, he paused and then let out a hollow laugh.</p>
<p>“You’re so weak.”</p>
<p>His rough words didn’t seem to carry any real annoyance. In fact, there was a hint of a smile in his voice.</p>
<p>With a sigh that seemed somewhat regretful, he finally moved his large body away from her. He haphazardly put on the pants that had been thrown under the bed and took a few steps forward. The silhouette of his broad shoulders was vaguely visible as he turned on the boiler switch. The room suddenly brightened, and she reflexively closed her eyes.</p>
<p>‘So bright.’</p>
<p>Reaching out to find the blanket, she felt his hand suddenly grab the back of her neck. Startled, her eyes flew open.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“This is the only house turning on the boiler in this weather. Do you know what month it is? It’s April, April.”</p>
<p>Despite his grumbling, his movements were careful as he lifted her slender body. She, awkwardly held by him, moved her lips.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Put me down.”</p>
<p>“You said you wanted to wash up.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>But why? She couldn’t finish her sentence. Standing still, he lowered his head and pressed his lips all over her face. The rough motion made a mess of her small face, and her pale forehead furrowed slightly.</p>
<p>“You’re so dam.n cute.”</p>
<p>Finding her reaction amusing, he laughed openly. She kept her lips tightly shut without responding. She was too tired and just wanted to wash up and sleep.</p>
<p>With a smile still on his face, he walked towards the bathroom. Even after entering the bathroom, he didn’t put her down. When she tried to support herself and get down, he finally set her gently on the floor.</p>
<p>‘Cold.’</p>
<p>Why does the bathroom feel so chilly today? As soon as she moved away from the man with naturally high body heat, a cold shiver ran through her. Trying to hide her discomfort, she looked blankly at the man still standing in front of her and asked.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you leaving?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to help you wash.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>His straightforward and confident tone left her speechless. Her gaze wavered slightly.</p>
<p>“Stop joking and get out.”</p>
<p>“I’ll wash alone,” she insisted firmly, but he stood his ground, unmoved. His face, now void of any hint of a smile, was as expressionless as ever. He glanced at her slender ankle, easily fitting in his hand, and said seriously…</p>
<p>“What if you lose strength in your legs and fall? If you break your ankle again, I won’t be able to take responsibility this time.”</p>
<p>His words, though serious, left her stunned. What the… Her mouth fell open in disbelief, and she saw his sleek eyes narrow.</p>
<p>Realizing too late that he was staring openly at her chest, she curled up a bit. Despite everything they had done together, his blatant gaze was still too much to handle.</p>
