            <p>Chapter 29.2</p>
<p>“I mean… you take care of me so thoughtfully. You’re like family, really. And honestly, I should feel even guiltier than I already do.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’ve been so caught up in being sick and overwhelmed that I haven’t had time to really think. Not that I don’t appreciate you—because I do. I’m so thankful, and I feel bad, too. But sometimes I can’t help wondering… why are you doing all this for me?”</p>
<p>The last words she spoke might have been an unguarded truth, slipping out before she could stop them. Of course, Yeon-ha no longer thought Min-gyu treated her kindly because of some hidden agenda. Still, it wasn’t a topic she wanted to dig into. The moment she said it, regret followed quickly.</p>
<p>For a moment, silence blanketed the table. The stillness stretched long enough to feel oppressive, broken only by his characteristically indifferent tone.</p>
<p>“Does there really need to be a reason? I do it because I want to.”</p>
<p>It was such a Min-gyu answer—casual, straightforward, and perfect for the moment. Neither evasive nor overly introspective, just balanced enough to close the subject without further questions.</p>
<p>As she awkwardly nodded, Min-gyu let out a deep sigh. His gaze locked onto hers, his expression steady yet weighted. His voice, though unhurried, carried an unmistakable certainty.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious, though. Sooner or later, you’re going to leave.”</p>
<p>The statement didn’t sound like a question, nor did it seem like he was fishing for a response. Still meeting her eyes, he exhaled lightly and added, almost as if confessing,</p>
<p>“So, I just want to take care of you while you’re here….”</p>
<p>Is that so wrong?</p>
<p>The words were muttered low, almost to himself. He laughed faintly, but the curve of his lips carried a bitterness she wasn’t used to seeing.</p>
<p><em>Ah.</em></p>
<p>Her breath caught. That weary expression didn’t suit him at all. The sight unsettled her, sending an unfamiliar, aching sensation sweeping through her body. She quickly averted her gaze, as though doing so might steady the tremor inside her.</p>
<p>The food on the table was still more than half untouched. Though she’d eaten her share, there was simply too much, and he’d clearly been more focused on the alcohol than the food.</p>
<p>“It’s probably all cold by now. Should I heat it up again?”</p>
<p>Before she could fully process the emotion behind his flickering eyes, he rose as if to take care of it. She hurriedly stopped him.</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine. It still tastes good even when it’s cold.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Besides, I’m full….”</p>
<p>“You barely ate, though.”</p>
<p>Min-gyu muttered his dissatisfaction but stood up anyway. He made his way to the fridge, and this time, Yeon-ha didn’t stop him. When he returned, he placed a single beer bottle on the table, almost defensively.</p>
<p>“Just one more,” he said, as if offering an excuse.</p>
<p>Sitting back down, he popped the cap off the bottle. Watching him, Yeon-ha found herself suddenly extending her empty glass toward him.</p>
<p>“I want to try some, too.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Min-gyu squinted his eyes sharply, caught off guard by her sudden request. His reluctance was written all over his face, but Yeon-ha didn’t back down.</p>
<p>“Why? One drink is fine, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“You said you’ve never had alcohol before.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but you said you’d teach me, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Her confident tone made him let out a faint laugh. “My arm hurts. Hurry up,” she urged with mock impatience. His astonishment turned into outright laughter as he muttered, “What’s with you today?” in a tone that suggested he was both amused and baffled.</p>
<p>“Fine, but just one drink,” he said, the laughter still lingering in his voice. “I don’t have a hobby cleaning up after drunk people, got it?”</p>
<p>“I won’t get drunk from just one drink,” she replied with a casual confidence, nodding firmly as if to reassure him. Her impulsive request seemed harmless enough.</p>
<p>“You sure about that?”</p>
<p>His doubtful tone was accompanied by a faint hissing sound as he drew in a skeptical breath. Even after agreeing, Min-gyu hesitated, glancing back and forth between her face and the beer bottle in his hand. Slowly, he took her glass, previously filled with juice, and poured just enough beer to barely fill half of it—this in stark contrast to his own glass, which he had generously topped off.</p>
<p>Handing the cup back, he added with a playful smirk, “Anyway, if Hwang Yeon-ha keeps being this cute, I can’t help but give in.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha blinked, taken aback. She mentally replayed her words and actions to pinpoint where exactly he had drawn such an absurd conclusion. Still stunned, her lips moved soundlessly in protest, but he interrupted her train of thought with an exaggeratedly benevolent expression as he handed over the glass.</p>
<p>“Well then, shall we toast?”</p>
<p>“…Sure.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha nodded faintly, still thrown off by the playful turn of events. Judging by the way his lips were quirked up, it was clear he was thoroughly enjoying the situation.</p>
<p>“Cheers.”</p>
<p>His even, low voice punctuated the clinking of their glasses—her juice cup lightly tapping against his beer glass. She hesitated for a moment but then quickly tilted her glass and took a gulp. The sight of her eagerly downing the beer made his eyebrows knit together in growing suspicion.</p>
<p>“Hey, slow down,” he muttered, his gaze narrowing as the cup in her hand rapidly emptied.</p>
