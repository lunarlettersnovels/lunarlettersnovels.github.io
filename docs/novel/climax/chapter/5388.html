            <p><strong>Chapter 22.1</strong></p>
<p>On the way back, Min-gyu insisted they stop by a nearby clinic. The doctor warned that the flu going around was particularly nasty and prescribed some medication. As they left the pharmacy next to the clinic, Yeon-ha’s face looked pale. Although she was feeling better after a good night’s sleep, just a bit of walking had drained her energy.</p>
<p>Still, she felt comfortable throughout the day. Min-gyu took care of everything, so all she had to do was follow along. His solid presence beside her was oddly reassuring.</p>
<p>Returning home and stepping into the front entrance, the reality of living with Kwon Min-gyu began to sink in.</p>
<p>“Get some rest.”</p>
<p>As he left for errands, Yeon-ha curled up on her bedding and quickly fell asleep. When she awoke, a blanket had been draped over her. She had only meant to rest her eyes but ended up sleeping much longer than expected. After a dinner of takeout food Min-gyu had brought back, she did some ankle exercises the hospital had recommended. Min-gyu kept insisting she do them right away.</p>
<p>“Don’t go up and down the stairs alone. We can go together later and pick up any clothes or things you need. Also…”</p>
<p>As he explained how she should handle meals while he was out working early the next morning, Yeon-ha only nodded absentmindedly. Whether it was the strong medication or just the remnants of sleep, she couldn’t fully focus on what he was saying.</p>
<p>Still, Yeon-ha couldn’t help but notice how considerate he was. After spending the day with him, it became clear that he had a knack for taking care of things—always anticipating what needed to be done.</p>
<p>“You should sleep here. It’s like you’ve always slept here… I can sleep anywhere.”</p>
<p>That night, unable to overcome her feelings of guilt, Yeon-ha suggested they swap sleeping arrangements. Min-gyu frowned deeply at her words.</p>
<p>“Do you think I have no manners?”</p>
<p>He firmly refused, saying he had always slept in the living room anyway, and then firmly closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>And so, the second day of their unexpected cohabitation came to an end.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Days passed quickly, much faster than Yeon-ha had anticipated. She spent her last day as a twenty-year-old sitting in the living room with Min-gyu, watching snow fall outside the window.</p>
<p>The scene wasn’t particularly romantic—a somewhat extravagant cake contrasting with the stark view outside, and a can of beer beside him—but it was still better than spending it alone in her room. It felt almost surreal.</p>
<p>And so, in someone else’s space, she welcomed her twenty-first birthday. A few days later, she applied to universities. While she was seriously focused on her tablet, Min-gyu mentioned offhandedly that he was confident she’d get into the school she wanted, and he’d cover her tuition.</p>
<p>She heard him, but didn’t respond, neither affirming nor denying his offer. Maybe she felt unable to. She felt ashamed of herself for not firmly refusing, for feeling powerless and cowardly.</p>
<p>Still, life with him was surprisingly smooth.</p>
<p>Even though they didn’t make a big deal out of it, they were careful and considerate of each other. The days passed peacefully, not too lively but not too dull either.</p>
<p>As time went on, they learned each other’s little habits—things you could only know by living together. Conversations became easier, and she started to learn more about him, things she hadn’t known before. Like his incredibly diligent, almost simple, daily routine.</p>
<p>She learned he had started working as a carpenter’s assistant a few months ago. She was surprised to hear he had already attended a trade school and earned his certification. From the bits and pieces he shared, it seemed like he took on whatever jobs he could find.</p>
<p>The reason he had been away for a couple of months was that he had taken a temporary job at a construction site in the countryside.</p>
<p>“That must have been tough.”</p>
<p>“It’s just work to make a living, nothing more.”</p>
<p>His nonchalant reply made her realize how mature he seemed, far beyond his twenty-one years.</p>
<p>He probably would have answered any more questions she had, but Yeon-ha didn’t pry. Perhaps she instinctively wanted to avoid crossing a certain line. She knew she would be leaving soon, and that was the natural course of things. Knowing that he worked hard was enough for her.</p>
<p>Above all, Yeon-ha’s injured ankle was not healing well, leaving her little time to focus on anything else. Although recovery varies from person to person after surgery, hers was undoubtedly slow. She wasn’t one to exaggerate pain, but the sudden sharp pangs that came and went were hard to bear.</p>
<p>It was just her ankle that was injured, yet her whole body seemed to ache. Often, she would toss and turn in discomfort, only to find that after a brief nap, most of the day had slipped away.</p>
<p>During this time, she came to deeply appreciate the reassurance of having someone nearby.</p>
