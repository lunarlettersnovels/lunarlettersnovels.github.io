            <p><strong>Chapter 28.2</strong></p>
<p>Min-gyu added the word “temporarily” lightly before opening a bottle of soju next to him. Yeon-ha paused, wondering if that meant something more. She hadn’t really thought about it before, but there hadn’t been any promises between them… or at least, she hadn’t thought so. She didn’t dwell on that, though—something else felt more urgent.</p>
<p>“Does that mean if I wasn’t around, you’d start smoking again?”</p>
<p>“Probably.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha was momentarily stunned by Min-gyu’s blunt response. It was true that he had mentioned quitting smoking before, claiming it was because of the risks of secondhand smoke, but still…</p>
<p>‘Maybe he should just quit for good.’</p>
<p>She wanted to say it out loud, but kept her mouth shut. She didn’t want to come off as too controlling. Min-gyu seemed to notice her change in expression and squinted slightly, but he didn’t press further. Instead, he poured more soju into his empty beer glass. Yeon-ha watched, somewhat disgusted, as the transparent liquid filled the glass halfway.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Stop pouring so much!”</p>
<p>Min-gyu froze for a moment, giving her a bewildered look. Yeon-ha, realizing she might have overreacted, quickly added an explanation.</p>
<p>“No, I just don’t get why you’re pouring so much soju…”</p>
<p>“I usually drink like this.”</p>
<p>“…Well, don’t drink like that today.”</p>
<p>Her voice had come out more forcefully than she intended. Min-gyu remained silent for a moment but then nodded, almost resigned. Yeon-ha felt a little relief at his compliance.</p>
<p>“By the way, clear some time for the day after tomorrow. The weekend’s coming up, so you’ll be with me all day.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha blinked in confusion at the sudden request. She didn’t have any particular plans—she’d be at home anyway—but she was still caught off guard.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to see the flowers. I’ve decided to take the day off.”</p>
<p>Oh, right. Yeon-ha vaguely remembered him mentioning that before. The way Min-gyu spoke, though, made it sound like he’d already made all the arrangements.</p>
<p>“Spring flowers are almost gone, so we’ll catch the last of them. It’ll be less crowded on Friday too. Weekends will be packed. Anyway, we’ll see the flowers, I’ve already made a dinner reservation… That’s the best time for it.”</p>
<p>He casually added that if they were running late, they could just stay over and sleep there. Yeon-ha mulled over his words. Flowers, dinner, maybe even stay over? He had already cleared his schedule for it, and everything was set.</p>
<p>“You made a reservation for dinner?”</p>
<p>Her voice was a bit higher than usual as she processed the information. Min-gyu shrugged nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you didn’t celebrate your birthday, so we should at least have a proper meal.”</p>
<p>“What’s that about?”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha couldn’t help but smile softly at the mention of her birthday. It was an unexpected suggestion, but honestly, she liked it. It felt like a fun little outing, and the idea alone was already making her excited. Min-gyu watched her, his eyes lingering on her with a faint smile. After a brief pause, his quiet voice drifted toward her.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha blinked in surprise at Min-gyu’s sudden statement. He had clearly been referring to her birthday earlier, but his casual comment about her being his girlfriend had caught her off guard. For a moment, she froze, unsure of how to respond. It wasn’t that she was angry or upset, but the question just felt heavier than expected. She gave a hesitant nod, almost as if she were seeking clarification.</p>
<p>“Am I your girlfriend?”</p>
<p>Her tone wasn’t accusatory or harsh; it was gentle, almost as though she were testing the waters. Min-gyu’s response came swiftly, almost too easily.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha felt a strange sense of discomfort wash over her, a tightening in her chest as if the air had suddenly been sucked out of the room. Min-gyu, however, seemed completely unaware of the effect his words had on her. He continued to drink from his glass as though the conversation had never taken a turn.</p>
<p>“I was just making an excuse,” he added casually.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha remained silent for a moment, processing his words. She wasn’t sure if she was disappointed or relieved, but she definitely felt something stirring in her chest. Her thoughts were interrupted by his teasing voice.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you upset?”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha immediately shook her head, trying to dispel the discomfort that had settled in. She wasn’t upset—just confused. As she turned to deny it, Min-gyu smiled and took another gulp of his drink, emptying his glass like it was nothing.</p>
<p>Then, as if on cue, he started nagging her.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you eating more? You should have some more.”</p>
<p>His voice was light, but it carried an undertone of insistence. Yeon-ha glanced at the large hand refilling her drink and couldn’t help but think that Min-gyu seemed to have a very clear stance when it came to their relationship. He wasn’t interested in labeling it, but perhaps it wasn’t something she needed to force, either.</p>
<p>She pushed the complicated thoughts aside, focusing instead on the dinner and the conversation, still swirling with uncertainty. Something was off about Min-gyu tonight. While he didn’t show it openly, there was a faint tension in his demeanor, a subtle restlessness that lingered throughout the evening. Despite his calm exterior, Yeon-ha could sense that something was bothering him.</p>
