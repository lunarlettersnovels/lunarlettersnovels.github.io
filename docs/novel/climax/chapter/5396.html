            <p><strong>Chapter 18.1</strong></p>
<p>The next afternoon, when Yeon-ha finally stepped out of the house to go to the store, Min-kyu was waiting at the bottom of the stairs. She had no idea how long he’d been standing there, but their timing was perfect.</p>
<p>He’d been pacing around the yard, and when he saw her, he quickly bounded up the steps two at a time, shoving a white envelope into the front pocket of her padded jacket. Yeon-ha, balancing on her crutches, naturally refused.</p>
<p>“Don’t say anything. Just take it, okay?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“It’s not like you’re saying no. I’ll get it back later, so just hold onto it for now.”</p>
<p>Their voices grew louder as they exchanged a few more words until Yeon-ha felt a lump in her throat. Why was he insisting on giving her something she clearly didn’t want? She was the one who needed the money, after all.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a thought she’d usually entertain, but she really was desperate. In the end, she took the envelope and went back inside to leave the money as he’d told her. When she came back out, his expression had softened a little.</p>
<p>Then, Min-gyu added, “By the way, let me know when you’re going to the hospital again.”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>“What do you think? I’m going with you.”</p>
<p>She looked up at him, her eyes wide and questioning. He awkwardly ran a hand through his hair.</p>
<p>“It’s not like that. I just want to help.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha blinked slowly before replying calmly. She appreciated the offer, but, “There are other people who can help.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>His hand, reaching out toward her crutch, froze upon her reply. His sharp, narrow eyes slanted in a thin line. The sudden dryness in her mouth made her chew on the inside of her cheek. She felt it again—Min-kyu’s gaze was intense. His eyes seemed to search her like he could see right through her thoughts. She couldn’t move, caught in that direct, penetrating stare.</p>
<p>Yet she couldn’t even begin to guess what he was thinking.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha spoke again, this time with a bit more resolve, though her heart was racing. She tried to sound casual, almost indifferent.</p>
<p>“I have a relative who drops by now and then. So, really, you don’t need to worry about me.”</p>
<p>It was a complete lie, of course. The only person who had come to this house was her great-aunt, and they hadn’t spoken since that day.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha had no intention of reaching out to her, either. It might seem foolish to hold on to her pride in a situation like this, but she couldn’t bring herself to explain her circumstances or ask to borrow money. That was simply not an option in her mind.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha just wanted to stop feeling so utterly wretched.</p>
<p>Look at her now—alone after her grandmother’s passing, even this man seemed to be looking down on her. If she had a family like everyone else, she wouldn’t have to expose her vulnerabilities to a complete stranger.</p>
<p>There was no way she could trust a man who offered to help without expecting anything in return, yet she couldn’t exactly throw the money in his face and demand to know what he really thought of her.</p>
<p>In short, her situation was already bad enough.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha had a cautious certainty that he probably knew she was lying. But in this situation, that flimsy deception was the best defense she could muster.</p>
<p>“…Do as you wish.”</p>
<p>He ran a hand through his hair one last time before turning away without another word. As she watched him stride down the stairs, she felt a sudden wave of exhaustion. Any thoughts of going to the store vanished, and she turned back into the house.</p>
<p>That was their final conversation.</p>
<p>After that, she never crossed paths with Kwon Min-gyu again. It wasn’t because she was avoiding him; it just happened that way. Though they were both aware of each other’s presence, they remained within their own boundaries, never stepping beyond.</p>
<p>Each passing day felt unbearably heavy for Yeon-ha.</p>
<p>Going to the hospital alone, struggling through school with her ailing body—it was far from easy. But she did it because she had no choice. In the midst of it all, the university entrance exam results came out. Given how she had lost the most crucial preparation period, she wasn’t expecting much. But the results were surprisingly good—better than she had hoped. Although getting into her first-choice university seemed out of reach, she might still make it into one of the top few schools.</p>
<p>Or maybe that was just wishful thinking.</p>
<p>She needed to submit her application early next month. But even if she got in, could she afford the tuition? And tuition wasn’t the only expense, after all.</p>
<p>“Just a little longer.”</p>
<p>Just a little more sleep. As her thoughts drifted, Yeon-ha’s eyes fluttered shut once again. There was so much to do, but she simply couldn’t manage it. She used to be so diligent, even to the point where people called her relentless.</p>
<p>She couldn’t remember the last time she had a proper rest; her life had always been a whirlwind of activity. Now, that version of herself seemed like a distant, faded memory.</p>
<p>As she teetered on the edge between sleep and unconsciousness—</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Ding-dong, ding-dong.</p>
