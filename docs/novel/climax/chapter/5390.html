            <p><strong>Chapter 21.1</strong></p>
<p>-gyu carefully observed the inscrutable expression before him, trying to read the emotions concealed behind it. Then, he spoke slowly.</p>
<p>“Should I, maybe, give you more time to think…?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a complaint but a genuine concern. He was still deeply contemplating the situation. As she met the eyes of the man standing at the entrance, Yeon-ha realized she had already made up her mind. It wasn’t a matter of trusting or not trusting him.</p>
<p>She had simply been drawn to the warmth of a fleeting moment during her most vulnerable time, even though she knew better.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was that very night when she followed him down to the first floor. Was he worried she might change her mind? From the moment she nodded, Min-gyu had noticeably hastened his actions.</p>
<p>“I’ll go turn on the boiler. It’s usually off, so it’ll still be cold.”</p>
<p>He told her to pack just the essentials, and within an hour, he was back knocking on Yeon-ha’s door. His judgment, though somewhat rushed, was accurate. Was she going to move in with him right away?</p>
<p>As she gathered a few clothes and basic necessities in his absence, Yeon-ha couldn’t stop thinking about calling the whole thing off. Of course, she had agreed, but everything felt so sudden.</p>
<p>When she finally entered the unfamiliar space with the man who had come to take her, an odd feeling washed over her. Standing awkwardly in the hallway, she heard his voice, softer now but still tinged with a hint of embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Just think of it as your own home and make yourself comfortable.”</p>
<p>Without a moment to take in her surroundings, she followed him directly to what seemed to be his bedroom. The first thing that caught her eye was the thick blanket spread out on the mat on the floor.</p>
<p>“I changed the pillow and brought out a new blanket… But if you’d prefer the one you’re used to, you can go get it now.”</p>
<p>As Min-gyu placed the small suitcase on the floor, he added a few words, but Yeon-ha quietly shook her head in response. The room, which felt a bit empty, fell into silence. A low, rumbling hum came from beside her.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, let’s go together and pick up anything else you might need.”</p>
<p>She nodded silently again, then glanced at the man beside her. He awkwardly rubbed his chin, an expression she had never seen before. It took her a moment to realize just how restless he was.</p>
<p>“Okay… For now, just rest. Or better yet, get some sleep. You’ll feel better after some sleep.”</p>
<p>After all, she had taken her medicine. Min-gyu, speaking quickly, suddenly paused and asked, “Is there anything else you need? Something to eat, maybe? Just tell me.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha was about to say she was fine, but a thought crossed her mind. Without much hesitation, she replied, “Then… I’d like some more of that juice from earlier.”</p>
<p>Min-gyu’s face lit up so noticeably that it startled her. Without even a word of acknowledgment, he turned and left.</p>
<p>Once the sound of the front door closing reached her, Yeon-ha let out a long sigh. It was already late, and the feeling of being alone in someone else’s space was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Not long after, Min-gyu returned, carrying a whole box of juice. Without saying anything, Yeon-ha drank two bottles in quick succession. As she did, she wondered if he felt as awkward as she did.</p>
<p>After she finished, Min-gyu picked up the empty bottles, told her to rest, and quietly closed the door behind him. With nothing else to do, Yeon-ha lay down on the bed he had prepared. The warmth in the room was unfamiliar, but it was comforting.</p>
<p>She tossed and turned for a bit, but soon fell into a deep, dreamless sleep—the best sleep she’d had in a long time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next morning, Min-gyu’s voice woke her, and reality hit her all over again. Last night felt like a distant dream. Sitting across from Min-gyu at breakfast was so awkward that she ate mechanically, not even sure how the food got into her mouth.</p>
<p>“Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Were you cold?”</p>
<p>“Mm-mm.”</p>
<p>Unlike her, Min-gyu seemed perfectly at ease. He talked to her and took care of her as if she’d always lived there. The awkwardness she had felt from him the night before was completely gone.</p>
<p>“You should take your medicine.”</p>
<p>After making sure she took the cold medicine he had bought yesterday, Min-gyu took her to the hospital. She thought there were still a few days left before her orthopedic appointment, but it turned out they had scheduled it for that day.</p>
<p>After her appointment, they had an early lunch at the same place as before. Yeon-ha felt a bit more at ease as she ate, her body noticeably lighter after a good night’s sleep. Even her cough had subsided.</p>
