            <p><strong>Chapter 17.1</strong></p>
<p>In the taxi home, Yeon-ha was hit by a wave of exhaustion and drowsiness. Min-gyu had settled her into the back seat, set her crutches neatly beside her, and then took the passenger seat. He gave her a quick check-in through the rearview mirror before turning his attention back to the driver and giving directions.</p>
<p>The city lights flickering past the window made the whole day feel like a weird dream. Not in a dreamy way, but because it had been a string of totally unexpected events.</p>
<p>‘Why is he being so nice?’ That thought looped through her foggy mind.</p>
<p>When they arrived at her place, Min-gyu’s attentiveness didn’t let up. He grabbed her crutches and the medication without missing a beat and carried her inside. Yeon-ha found it a bit funny how she just let him carry her without protest. But honestly, she didn’t have the energy to argue; she just wanted to get to her own space and call it a day.</p>
<p>Min-gyu moved at his own slow, deliberate pace through the chilly evening air. Yeon-ha watched him, feeling like the whole scene was a bit surreal. His broad shoulders, the crutches, his steady steps, and the soft rustling of the medication bag all seemed to blur together.</p>
<p>‘This is comfortable.’</p>
<p>She surprised herself with the thought. It was strange how, despite feeling unsettled inside, her body was actually enjoying the ease of it all.</p>
<p>Even though she was starting to feel better after spending the day with him, her initial discomfort with Min-gyu wasn’t going away that quickly. Still, there was something reassuring about his presence.</p>
<p>From catching a taxi to taking care of the little things at the hospital and restaurant, Min-gyu had been there for her. He made sure she didn’t trip on stairs or get jostled by passersby, making everything easier.</p>
<p>The two soon arrived at Yeon-ha’s front door. Min-gyu’s low voice broke the silence of the darkened space.</p>
<p>“We’re here.”</p>
<p>He helped Yeon-ha down, his tone oddly tender. As soon as Yeon-ha’s feet touched the ground, Min-gyu’s arm extended to gently support him, as if afraid he might topple over. The gesture felt more natural and intimate than before, like a smooth, instinctive flow. Only after handing over the crutches did Min-gyu pull his hand away, though not without some reluctance.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“What’s with that look?”</p>
<p>Min-gyu chuckled at the way Yeon-ha peered up at him with round, uncertain eyes. The shift in atmosphere was subtle, leaving Yeon-ha with a mixed feeling.</p>
<p>“Get some rest and take your medicine.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha watched his faint smile in the darkness for a moment before hesitantly speaking up.</p>
<p>“Thanks for everything today.”</p>
<p>Min-gyu only responded by ruffling his own hair with one hand, avoiding eye contact. Before he could say anything, Yeon-ha hurried on.</p>
<p>“And… I’m really sorry about the rent. I’ll transfer it all right away. But I might be a bit short this month…”</p>
<p>Min-gyu’s smile vanished instantly, replaced by a cold tone that pierced Yeon-ha’s ears.</p>
<p>“Stop talking about it. Didn’t I tell you not to worry?”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha paused, recalling Min-gyu’s earlier comment about not worrying about the rent and how he’d said that carrying him would cover it.</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember? I said I’d cover your rent by carrying you, and you didn’t hesitate for a second.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha shook her. She didn’t remember such a thing. Even if it were true, it seemed absurd to think that being carried could cover months of rent. The seriousness with which Min-gyu brought it up made it sound like a joke.</p>
<p>But was he serious? Yeon-ha’s voice raised slightly in disbelief. “That doesn’t make any sense.”</p>
<p>Min-gyu’s casual yet firm demeanor was disarming. His tone held an edge that suggested he was not to be argued with. As he held out his phone, his next words were straightforward.</p>
<p>“Enter your number here.”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>“So I can reach you.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha hesitated but ultimately complied, inputting her number. Given that her grandmother was no longer around, it was practical to share her contact information. Min-gyu promptly dialed her number to verify it.</p>
<p>“Save my number too.”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>“Call me if you need anything.”</p>
<p>With that, he turned and descended the stairs. Yeon-ha watched his retreating figure, her thoughts swirling with gratitude and bewilderment.</p>
