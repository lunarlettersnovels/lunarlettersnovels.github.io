            <p><strong>Chapter 11.1</strong></p>
<p>“Don’t hate your mom too much. She had a tough life, so I sent her away. Both you and Mi-young are my children, and it’s heartbreaking…”</p>
<p>Looking back, it was strange how much Yeon-ha’s grandmother talked about Mom around that time. She suddenly brought up the forbidden topic, hoping Yeon-ha wouldn’t harbor resentment towards her mother. Could it be that her grandmother had a premonition?</p>
<p>However, Yeon-ha had no real interest in the stories her grandmother seemed eager to tell. She didn’t have the mental space for it and had never been particularly curious anyway. More urgent matters were at hand, like unpacking and planning her upcoming study schedule.</p>
<p>Their new neighborhood was quiet and unfamiliar, with a different atmosphere just a block away. Their new home was an old two-story house at the end of a narrow alley. The second floor, where they would live, had two rooms, including a small side room, and was cleaner than expected. The deposit and rent were surprisingly low, making Yeon-ha a bit suspicious.</p>
<p>Right outside their front door was a seemingly abandoned shed, and a stone staircase led down to a modest yard. Although the landlord supposedly lived on the first floor, they hadn’t met even on moving day or the day after.</p>
<p>“A young man handled the contract himself. He’s young but already has a house like this; it seems his parents left it to him.”</p>
<p>Her grandmother explained as if making excuses while Yeon-ha reviewed the lease agreement. Normally, she would have been more meticulous about the moving process, but with the chaos of transferring schools and studying for exams, she left most of it to her guardian.</p>
<p>The repercussions of that decision became apparent very quickly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was the third day after moving in. The night before, her grandmother had complained that her perm was coming loose, so Yeon-ha accompanied her to a local hair salon. The friendly salon owner insisted they have a drink, so Yeon-ha sat on a chair at the back. She had planned to head home and then go grocery shopping, returning to the salon just as her perm would be finished.</p>
<p>“Oh my, you moved into that house? I hope everything stays alright. It’s a bit concerning.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha, about to stand up, paused at the salon owner’s words, spoken warmly to her grandmother as if they were old friends.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Her grandmother’s voice rose sharply from the chair where she sat, getting her hair done. The salon owner, casting a glance at Yeon-ha through the mirror, continued awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Well, there are rumors that the boy living there is the son of a gangster. I mean, we don’t know for sure, but…”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha’s heart sank.</p>
<p>‘Gangster?’</p>
<p>The unexpected word made her eyes widen. Another woman, who had been flipping through a magazine with her hair in curlers, chimed in.</p>
<p>“Not a gangster, a thug, isn’t it?” Her voice was sharp, but the salon owner shook her head.</p>
<p>“Same thing, gangster or thug.”</p>
<p>She continued to skillfully tend to a customer’s hair, even as an awkward silence briefly settled over the busy salon. Her grandmother, who had been watching Yeon-ha through the mirror, let out a scoffing laugh.</p>
<p>“Oh please, there are no gangsters around these days.”</p>
<p>The old lady’s confident voice rang out, even in her old age, making Yeon-ha gulp nervously.</p>
<p>“The boy who owns the house, I met him myself, and he didn’t seem like that kind of person. He’s not very talkative and said he just graduated from high school.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, but his father’s reputation is well-known around here.”</p>
<p>The salon owner added awkwardly, unsure of what to call the young man since he wasn’t a university student yet. Then she started sharing more details. Initially hesitant, she seemed to be more forthcoming as her grandmother firmly denied the rumors. Yeon-ha listened intently, barely breathing, as she fixed her gaze on the salon owner’s hands applying chemicals to the customer’s hair.</p>
<p>In summary, no one knew exactly what the boy’s father did, and he had left the area a long time ago. However, rumors had it that he was a key figure in a large gang fight that made the news years ago, causing quite a commotion in the area. The talk about being part of a gang stemmed from that incident.</p>
<p>“People said it was a gang turf war, and some even said he was connected to a construction company. It was a big deal back then. I thought he was arrested, but later, I heard he sent someone else to jail in his place. All just rumors, though.”</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty, those who had seen the man described him as someone who didn’t seem to have a regular job but constantly changed cars and wore flashy designer clothes. The salon owner’s voice rose a bit when she recounted her own experience.</p>
<p>“It’s not about prejudice, but he just didn’t look like an ordinary person. Even seeing him from a distance gave me chills.”</p>
<p>At some point, her grandmother stopped responding and just listened. The small space felt quieter, and no one paid attention to the TV mounted on the wall.</p>
<p>“Anyway, after that, only his wife and two sons lived there. I was worried when my son was assigned to the same middle school, but he seemed to attend quietly enough. Then, suddenly, they moved out. Everyone thought it was for the best. Then, about two years ago, the son came back alone. I have a good eye for faces, and I was sure it was him after the real estate agent confirmed it. He does resemble his father, handsome, but you’ve already met him.”</p>
