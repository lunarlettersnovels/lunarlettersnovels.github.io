            <p><strong>Chapter 7.1</strong></p>
<p>“How is it?” She asked, prompting a nonchalant reply from him.</p>
<p>“It’s just ice cream.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Yeon-ha nodded and focused on her portion of ice cream. Unlike the sporadic conversation between them, the people at the adjacent table were chatting incessantly. Despite not intending to eavesdrop, their conversation was clear.</p>
<p>They seemed to be freshmen from a certain university, back home for the weekend. After briefly mentioning their upcoming midterms, one of them lamented that the new dress she had splurged on didn’t suit her.</p>
<p>Her friend reassured her, saying she looked pretty. Yeon-ha, quietly listening, suddenly asked, “Is today Saturday?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” came the short reply from Min-gyu, who had already finished his small cup. Surprised, Yeon-ha realized she had lost track of the days, having spent so much time cooped up at home.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha stole a subtle glance to her side.</p>
<p>The girl in the flowing dress, with her radiant smile, looked delightful. Though it was brief, Yeon-ha found their conversation about university life fascinating. Earlier, while searching for part-time jobs, she had even checked the university website where she had been accepted.</p>
<p>Her gaze drifted to her rugged coat. Despite her slender frame, the coat’s loose fit looked awkward. It wasn’t oversized enough to be fashionable, nor did it fit well; it was just plain unflattering.</p>
<p>Yet, it was warm and practical, making it her go-to during the changing seasons. It was one of the several items her grandmother had bought shortly after she started high school. Most of the other clothes were decent, but this jacket stood out as particularly ill-fitting.</p>
<p>“My dear, you’re still so small,” her grandmother had remarked, unable to replace it, to which Yeon-ha had assured her that the extra room was fine.</p>
<p>Though she didn’t have many casual clothes to begin with, she wore this jacket often, partly out of sentiment. She wore it while helping at the restaurant, to school, and almost everywhere.</p>
<p>Her closest friend, on the other hand, often wore high-end brands and designer outfits, casually discussing new purchases and desires for the latest trends. Yeon-ha felt an inevitable sense of alienation but didn’t mind.</p>
<p>Everyone lives within their means; she knew that all too well.</p>
<p>Pushing down the clutter in her mind, Yeon-ha quickly popped the rest of the ice cream into her mouth. She realized that the man with his arms crossed was blatantly staring at her, but she didn’t care.</p>
<p>Min-gyu often looked at her that way, as if he was trying to read her, so she was used to it.</p>
<p>After a brief dessert break, the two stepped back outside. Yeon-ha now held a cone of ice cream, which Min-gyu had insisted on buying for her despite her protests. She took a small bite of the new flavor, feeling slightly embarrassed under his gaze.</p>
<p>“…Do you want some?” she offered, expecting him to decline. To her surprise, he nodded. Taken aback, she watched as his large hand enveloped her slender one, taking a big bite of the cone. The casual intimacy of the gesture left her momentarily frozen.</p>
<p>“It’s good,” he remarked, briefly smiling. Yeon-ha felt a strange commotion within her, something unfamiliar stirring.</p>
<p>‘…Ah.’</p>
<p>Before she could dwell on this new sensation, his hand withdrew. She glanced up at his smooth face, then turned her gaze to the busy road. The vibrant, glittering city night reflected quietly in her wavering vision.</p>
<p>On the way home, Min-gyu carried her again.</p>
<p>They had been walking a bit after getting out of the taxi when, upon seeing the stone steps in the distance, he naturally bent down. This time, Yeon-ha obediently wrapped her arms around his neck. There were no passersby around anyway. His warmth was, as always, comforting.</p>
<p>It was dusk when she had been carried down the steps on his back, but now it was a deep, quiet night as they ascended.</p>
<p>As he climbed the stairs slowly, Min-gyu suddenly spoke. “It’s a good thing I didn’t go to work.”</p>
<p>His low voice almost sounded like he was talking to himself. With her cheek pressed against his broad back, Yeon-ha merely blinked. She had almost dozed off in the taxi earlier, full and drowsy. The gentle sway of his sturdy frame beneath her was, to be honest, quite soothing and comfortable.</p>
<p>As they climbed more than halfway up the stairs, Min-gyu suddenly asked, “Are you falling asleep again? Huh?” His voice sounded unusually cheerful. Yeon-ha, too tired to reply, just stayed silent, pressing herself closer to him.</p>
<p>“Go ahead and sleep,” he said with a chuckle. “I’ll make sure you get home safe.” His voice carried a warmth that brought Yeon-ha a deep sense of reassurance. She closed her eyes, letting the dim light fade into comforting darkness, ready to forget everything for a while as she drifted off.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>On Monday, Yeon-ha woke up much earlier than usual. Min-gyu was always careful not to disturb her, so she often slept through his morning routine, but today, she woke up as soon as he left the bed. She lay quietly under the now-familiar blankets, listening to the sound of water from the bathroom, then wiggled her right ankle a few times before sitting up.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Are you hurt?” Min-gyu emerged from the bathroom and was surprised to see Yeon-ha already up and tidying the bed. She quickly shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not hurt. I just woke up.”</p>
<p>“Really?” He scanned her quickly with his dark eyes, from her pale face to her tousled hair, the loose t-shirt, and thin pants revealing her slender wrists and bare feet. He seemed to confirm her slightly dazed expression and then suddenly spread his arms wide.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha stared at him, wondering what he was doing. After a moment, he let out a small laugh.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to say good morning?” Min-gyu said.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t, I will,” he said with a playful grin.</p>
