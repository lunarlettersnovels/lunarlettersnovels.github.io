            <p><strong>Chapter 15.2</strong></p>
<p>The man sounded uncomfortable for the first time during their conversation.</p>
<p>“I received the first month’s rent when we signed the lease, but I haven’t received the rent for the following month because you had circumstances.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“After that, you paid for two months at once, and that’s it.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha’s face turned deathly pale as she listened. Her mind, still sluggish, started piecing it together. They paid for three months and then nothing. That lined up with when her grandmother had collapsed. It was now November.</p>
<p>She had planned for her college housing rent yet had completely neglected to pay for the house she was currently living in.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha felt like dying from embarrassment. How shameless she must have seemed to him. Even now, she hadn’t brought up the rent and acted like she wanted to run away.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. I really forgot. I’ll pay you right away. I’m truly sorry.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha’s voice trembled slightly and she was unable to meet his eyes.</p>
<p>“No, it’s–”</p>
<p>The man started to say something but closed his mouth firmly. Without looking up, Yeon-ha fumbled in her padded jacket pocket for her phone, intending to transfer the money immediately. Her mind habitually calculated the amount. Just then, she realized she didn’t have enough for six months’ rent.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>A dull thud echoed through the cold space as she accidentally dropped her crutch. The man, who had been watching her every move, finally let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>Their eyes met again. Her frantic eyes made him wince inside yet his voice came out rough and irritated.</p>
<p>“Forget about all this for now and just get down the stairs. Huh? Weren’t you heading out somewhere?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If you keep going like this, you’ll end up breaking your other ankle too, da*n it.”</p>
<p>The man let out a dry laugh, his coarse curse words hanging in the air. His gaze lingered on her small face, which looked dazed and stunned, before he abruptly reached out.</p>
<p>Despite his harsh tone, his actions were surprisingly considerate as he took the crutch from Yeon-ha and put her phone back in her padded jacket pocket. She had no way of knowing that he was intentionally speaking more roughly. His broad back was now in front of her again, and this time, he didn’t wait.</p>
<p>“Would you get on if I said I’d waive the rent?”</p>
<p>Muttering something that barely registered in her ears, he reached back and pulled her stiff body towards him. Yeon-ha, having lost the will to resist or even think, found herself on his broad back as if in a trance. The warmth of another person’s body felt strange against her now-cold skin.</p>
<p>Even with the crutches in his hands, he carried her effortlessly. When Yeon-ha awkwardly placed her hands on his broad shoulders, his lips curled slightly. He adjusted her securely and began descending the stairs, one careful step at a time.</p>
<p>They stepped outside, and even after the gate closed, he showed no sign of putting her down. Instead, he casually asked,</p>
<p>“Where are you headed?”</p>
<p>“…To the hospital.”</p>
<p>“Is it for your leg?”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha nodded and tensed her body, silently asking to be put down. Understanding her signal, the man gently set her down, his movements careful.</p>
<p>She swallowed hard as she took back the crutches, but the recent events still felt unreal. Despite the cold wind brushing against her cheeks, she didn’t feel cold at all.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Even amidst the chaos, Yeon-ha managed to bow and thank him. Seemingly indifferent, he continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Are you planning to take a taxi?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Let’s call one here,” He said.</p>
<p>“I’m about to call one,” Yeon-ha replied, her voice soft. Despite her compliant answer, he continued to look down at her. She was about to bring up the rent again when he spoke.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you can go by yourself?”</p>
