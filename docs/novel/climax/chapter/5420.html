            <p><strong>Chapter 6.1</strong></p>
<p>Overall, Min-gyu gave off an impression of being rugged and strong. At first, he seemed nothing more than endlessly rough around the edges, but to be honest, his looks were… well, quite good. No, actually, he was very handsome.</p>
<p>His striking appearance undoubtedly contributed to the intense, almost daunting aura he exuded. When he smiled, it softened a bit, but when he was expressionless, he seemed cold—almost fierce.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha thought there was something about him that was quite overpowering. This was putting it mildly.</p>
<p>His eyes, especially, were intense.</p>
<p>Kwon Min-gyu had an unusually piercing gaze, one that seemed to see right through a person. The memory of him smoking a cigarette with a crooked posture, staring at her with that blank expression, remained vivid in Yeon-ha’s mind.</p>
<p>Despite having done nothing wrong, she felt incredibly tense back then. Her heart pounded even as she passed by him quickly. The sense of unease she felt towards someone she had never spoken to was undoubtedly due to the rumors surrounding him.</p>
<p>It made sense. How else could she explain her one-sided discomfort?</p>
<p>Min-gyu’s presence was distinctly different from the boys their age. He seemed like someone from another world, especially when she saw him in his uniform. Honestly, she thought he must be much older.</p>
<p>‘But he says we’re the same age.’</p>
<p>Well, he says so, so she tries to accept it, but it’s not entirely believable.</p>
<p>Reflecting on their first meeting, a dry laugh escaped her. She remembered cautiously opening the front gate and rushing into her place on the second floor, hoping not to run into him. She never imagined in her wildest dreams that she would end up living with him downstairs.</p>
<p>Even now, the vague unease hadn’t completely dissipated. That is why she didn’t ask Min-gyu too many questions. She was afraid of what he might say.</p>
<p>Still…</p>
<p>‘I owe him so much.’</p>
<p>Regardless of who Kwon Min-gyu really was, the thought of him not being around was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha, who was usually tough, found the past few months extremely challenging. The pain had been so intense that she couldn’t think of anything else. There were times when the very act of walking seemed impossible.</p>
<p>Somehow, she would have endured, but it wasn’t a situation that could be glossed over. What if she had been alone? Such a scenario was unimaginable. With an injured body, she couldn’t go out to earn money, and even minor household chores were a struggle. Most of all, she lacked the strength to endure everyday life.</p>
<p>Yeon-ha desperately needed someone’s help. In that situation, Min-gyu was the one who accompanied her to the hospital with crutches, diligently iced her swollen foot, prepared meals while she lay bedridden, and took care of all the other trivial tasks.</p>
<p>The memories of those days, spent in a daze due to the sudden change in environment and harsh reality, flashed through Yeon-ha’s mind.</p>
<p>Even if Min-gyu was ‘that kind of person,’ as the rumors said, the help he provided was indelible.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha quickly averted her gaze as Min-gyu placed his phone on the table. She realized belatedly that she had been staring too intensely.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, not eating?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Just don’t force yourself, okay?”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha nodded again. They continued eating and drinking for a while. As Min-gyu opened a new bottle of soju, he suddenly called out to her.</p>
<p>“Yeon-ha.”</p>
<p>“While living with me… hasn’t anything been difficult for you? Any hardships?”</p>
<p>The answer came without hesitation.</p>
<p>“None.”</p>
<p>Ignoring the complex thoughts in her head and the condition of her injured ankle, she couldn’t remember a time when she had lived so luxuriously. Everything ran smoothly in Min-gyu’s house, even if she did nothing. Min-gyu’s eyes narrowed at the firm answer. His sharp gaze scrutinized her small face, now showing signs of fatigue from the rare feast.</p>
<p>“No, really think about it. Is there anything you want to say to me or anything you need?”</p>
<p>His words were slightly off, and he tilted his head as if puzzled.</p>
<p>“I mean, is there anything more you wish I’d do for you?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha replied curtly. He was a strict man to himself but excessively generous to her in many ways. To Yeon-ha, who believed there was no such thing as unconditional kindness, this fact inevitably became a burden.</p>
<p>She was full, a bit tired, and in a languid state when her lips moved on their own.</p>
<p>“I have so much to repay.”</p>
<p>“Repay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Even if it’s hard right now, I’ll repay everything soon—the money and everything else.”</p>
<p>Her expression subtly changed in a calm yet clear tone. Yeon-ha, who had slightly lowered her eyes, didn’t notice.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not long now, anyway.” She was recovering and would be able to work hard to pay for his generosity.</p>
