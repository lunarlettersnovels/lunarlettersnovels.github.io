            <p><strong>Chapter 9.2</strong></p>
<p>“No,” She hesitated.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Just return it. The sneakers, too… I don’t need any of this.”</p>
<p>The initial excitement she felt over the well-fitting sneakers faded as she glanced around at the boxes and shopping bags strewn about. She felt overwhelmed. It wasn’t about the difference between sneakers and clothes; it was just the feeling of it all. She appreciated that he had bought the dress because he thought she liked it, but still…</p>
<p>Whether Min-gyu noticed her mood or not, he continued in a different tone.</p>
<p>“Honestly, the clothes aren’t what matters. If you’re happy wearing something pretty, then that’s all that counts.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“With your face, you’d look good in anything.”</p>
<p>Despite his straightforward compliment, Yeon-ha couldn’t help but furrow her brows. But then…</p>
<p>“Don’t overthink it. Just accept it. Living together and not celebrating your birthday would be too cold, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>…Ah.</p>
<p>His quiet words made her freeze. She hadn’t even considered that he would know about her birthday. Stunned, she took a deep breath and carefully asked, “How did you know?”</p>
<p>“I know everything.”</p>
<p>“Don’t joke around… How did you really know?”</p>
<p>At her insistent questioning, a playful smile appeared on his well-defined face. A hint of mischief sparkled in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Hmm, maybe I went through your wallet?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“When you first came here, I checked your ID. Even though I brought you here, I had to make sure of your identity. What if you ran off with all my money?”</p>
<p>Was this another one of his jokes? As she looked into his eyes, which were firmly fixed on hers, she couldn’t help but feel tense. His calm voice and enigmatic expression gave off an intimidating vibe. Even though he was smiling, there was something unsettling about it. For a brief moment, he felt eerily unfamiliar.</p>
<p>“Ah, Yeon-ha, you’re too serious. You’re so naïve,” Min-gyu chuckled. It turned out he had simply remembered it from when she had casually left it out while unpacking her things when she first moved in.</p>
<p>Relieved, Yeon-ha murmured, “I really… forgot about it.”</p>
<p>She genuinely hadn’t thought about it. Although she didn’t place much importance on birthdays, her grandmother always made seaweed soup for her, and her friends never forgot to celebrate with her.</p>
<p>Hearing her say that, Min-gyu raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“You don’t think it’s today, do you?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your birthday is in two days.”</p>
<p>To clear up any confusion, he mentioned today’s date, and Yeon-ha realized she had lost track of time lately. Min-gyu explained that he had bought the gifts in advance because he would be busy with work.</p>
<p>“I put aside my work to get these gifts, so please accept them, okay?”</p>
<p>Having nothing more to say, Yeon-ha reluctantly changed into the new outfit in her room. After her shower, she checked her reflection in the large bathroom mirror. Seeing her slightly flushed face felt strange. She felt more embarrassed than pleased. She had to show him the outfit now, as he insisted.</p>
<p>‘Should I just take it off and go out?’</p>
<p>While she was hesitating, a loud voice came from outside. “Hwang Yeon-ha! Did you fall while changing?”</p>
<p>When she didn’t answer, he added, “Why is it taking so long? I’m coming in.”</p>
<p>Yeon-ha sighed and stepped into the living room. His impatience was something else. He was already on his feet, ready to come in if she took any longer.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>After all his urging, now that she was standing awkwardly before him, he just stood there silently, a few steps away, scrutinizing her. His gaze was intense like he was inspecting every detail. Even though she thought she was used to his blatant stares, the situation made her feel more self-conscious.</p>
<p>While her eyes wandered, Min-gyu’s gaze never left her. He observed the white neckline, the delicate arms extending from the frilled sleeves, and the slender legs revealed up to her knees. Though the swelling had gone down, the slight difference in the thickness of her legs was still noticeable. Hi</p>
<p>s eyes lingered on the scarred right ankle before slowly moving back up to her fluttering eyelashes and trembling lips. Finally, he spoke.</p>
<p>“It suits you well.”</p>
<p>Already overwhelmed with embarrassment, Yeon-ha barely met his gaze as she mumbled, “Uh-huh.”</p>
<p>“But don’t wear it outside.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” His voice sounded almost gruff, making her finally meet his eyes properly. She stared at him quizically, wondering why he would buy her clothes only to tell her not to wear them outside. As he met her large, clear eyes, he smirked.</p>
