            <p><strong>Chapter 21.2</strong></p>
<p>As they were finishing their meal, Min-gyu spoke up. “I want to make one thing clear. While you’re with me, don’t worry about money, okay? I know your situation, so there’s no need to apologize or feel bad about anything.”</p>
<p>He wanted them to be transparent with each other. She wasn’t entirely sure what he meant, but she asked bluntly, “Aren’t you losing out because of me? I haven’t even paid all my rent, and I can’t pay you back right away.”</p>
<p>Min-gyu let out a sound that showed he wasn’t pleased with her question, then replied in his usual indifferent tone, “Do you think I’m an idiot?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m not the sharpest when it comes to academics, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do basic math.”</p>
<p>Min-gyu propped his chin up with one hand, flashing a sly grin. Seeing that made Yeon-ha swallow nervously.</p>
<p>“You’re smart, you know that? I’m doing this because I know you’ll pay me back someday. I can tell you’re headed for a good university and a great job.”</p>
<p>His words, tinged with a hint of nonchalance, were the most reassuring thing Yeon-ha could hear at that moment. The idea that he expected repayment someday, rather than just brushing it off, was oddly comforting. Of course, she’d repay him—every last bit—even if it took time. If he had said he’d simply let it all go, she would have felt uneasy. Min-gyu’s consistent stance from the start gave her a small sense of relief.</p>
<p>As Yeon-ha sipped on the drink he had insisted on ordering for her, she asked a question that had been nagging at her.</p>
<p>“But… I haven’t been paying rent for a while. Why didn’t you say anything?”</p>
<p>“Well, as long as someone’s still living upstairs, I figured you’d pay eventually.”</p>
<p>“Is that how you normally are?”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“I mean, most landlords wouldn’t be so patient.”</p>
<p>She meant it. What kind of landlord was this lenient? Min-gyu, stretching his words like it was no big deal, reached for his glass and mumbled as if talking to himself.</p>
<p>“I’m not exactly the most patient guy.”</p>
<p>His perfectly shaped lips twisted slightly as he trailed off. Though curious about what he left unsaid, Yeon-ha decided not to press further. Watching him, she noticed he seemed to have more to say, but when he spoke again, his tone was gentle.</p>
<p>“Anything else you’re curious about?”</p>
<p>After a moment’s hesitation, Yeon-ha slowly parted her lips. Her next question came out almost impulsively.</p>
<p>“Are you… really that rich?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>A brief silence fell between them. It wasn’t until after she asked that Yeon-ha realized how strange her question might have sounded. Min-gyu, however, responded with his usual indifference.</p>
<p>“Why? Planning to live off me?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Go ahead, give it a try.”</p>
<p>He chuckled, clearly amused. That’s not what I meant… Yeon-ha started to say, but Min-gyu cut her off.</p>
<p>“I can afford to care for you for a while, no problem.”</p>
<p>As she watched his throat bob while he drank his water, Yeon-ha found herself taking another sip of her own drink. Setting down his cup, he continued in a casual tone.</p>
<p>“I might not be able to spoil you, but I promise you won’t be uncomfortable while you’re here. That’s one thing I can really guarantee.”</p>
<p>As Min-gyu finished speaking, he stretched his shoulders, muscles rippling under his shirt. Watching his broad chest, Yeon-ha found herself pondering the word “discomfort” with new curiosity. Did they share the same idea of what was comfortable or uncomfortable? The question lingered in her mind, though it seemed trivial.</p>
<p>It was about time to get up, but there was still something Yeon-ha wanted to say. After hesitating a bit longer this time, she carefully asked,</p>
<p>“One last question.”</p>
<p>“You can ask me all day if you want.”</p>
<p>“Are you… you’re not involved in anything shady, right?”</p>
<p>For a split second, the smooth lines of Min-gyu’s brow furrowed, and the faint smile on his sharp features vanished. The sudden change in his expression made Yeon-ha tense up. But when he spoke again, his voice was steady, with no hint of offense.</p>
<p>“If I were, I wouldn’t have asked you to stay with me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I only touch money I’ve earned honestly. Well… except for the rent money, maybe.”</p>
<p>He let out a small, dry laugh as if mocking himself. Though he was smiling, there was a cool edge to his demeanor that made Yeon-ha instinctively clamp her mouth shut. Min-gyu had a way of being gentle and reliable one moment, then exuding a subtle air of danger the next. It probably wasn’t intentional on his part, but still…</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” he said, standing up. As Yeon-ha nodded, she noticed him grabbing her crutches first. She decided to save her questions about his father for another time.</p>
