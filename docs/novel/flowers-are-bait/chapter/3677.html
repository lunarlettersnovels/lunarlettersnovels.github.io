            <p><strong>Chapter 103</strong></p>
<p>When he stepped off his ladder, he was immediately confronted by Lee-yeon who was holding out a can of orange juice to him. His instincts made him flinch, but he accepted the juice as casually as he could.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a problem with our product,” he said. “It should be good now, but please let me know if you encounter any issues in the future.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon nodded as he packed up his toolbox. Curious, Lee-yeon looked inside it. She immediately paled and stepped back.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, who was sitting on a chair, quickly got up and moved towards her. “Lee-yeon?” he said. “Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon, realizing her mistake, shook her head. “It’s nothing!” she said. “I just felt weird all of a sudden.” She rubbed her arm and leaned against Kwon Chae-woo’s shoulder.</p>
<p>The repairman casually closed the toolbox, but Lee-yeon had already seen what was inside: a red rose.</p>
<p>A rose was a symbol of stalking.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, I’ll be right back,” Kwon Chae-woo said.</p>
<p>She frowned. “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>He placed a hand on Lee-yeon’s head and smiled. “Just over there,” he told her. “I think I need to sweep the yard.” But, before Lee-yeon could even say a thing, his eyes changed as he ran to chase the repairman that was already leaving.</p>
<p>Before he knew it, Jang Boem-hee was being pushed against the wall and choked. Kwon Chae-woo was placing pressure on his throat with his elbow.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe this is the first time we’ve met,” he said.</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee’s eyes widened when he heard the words. The moment he realized that Kwon Chae-woo was running after him, he realized that this wasn’t an opportunity that he could waste. He had been waiting for a chance for Kwon Chae-woo to attack him.</p>
<p>“Young master—”</p>
<p>“Why do you keep hanging around here?” Kwon Chae-woo demanded.</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee froze at the unexpected question. “What?”</p>
<p>“You live across the street,” Kwon Chae-woo said. “You served at the hotel the other day. Now you’re fixing light bulbs?”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee wanted to kick himself. Why had so many people noticed him? His mind flashed to the woman who had left the house the other day and was immediately suspicious of him.</p>
<p>When Kwon Chae-woo didn’t let up, Jang Beom-hee became annoyed. He had never faced Kwon Chae-woo personally. He had only seen Hwang Jo-yoon in the corridor for a few seconds and only a bit in the party hall.</p>
<p>But he was terrified by how Kwon Chae-woo had managed to piece it all together.</p>
<p>“This is the third time we’ve met,” Kwon Chae-woo hissed. “Is that still a coincidence?” He pushed the neck harder and Jang Beom-hee realized that it had been a while since he had been this overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee chuckled suddenly and that only made Kwon Chae-woo frown even more. “Who are you?” Kwon Chae-woo demanded. When the other man didn’t answer, he growled. “Answer me,” he said. “I will squash all the bugs that come after my wife either way.”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee shook his head as he realized the misunderstanding. “Young master, that’s not it!” Kwon Chae-woo’s face became stern so Jang Beom-hee continued. “Did you get the rose that I sent you?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Does it not bring back any memories?” Jang Beom-hee asked. “Do you not remember me? Do you really not know who I am?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo frowned. “What are you saying, pervert?” he sneered.</p>
<p>As Jang Beom-hee realized how he had been further misunderstood, he kicked Kwon Chae-woo in the shin and managed to escape the other man’s grip. But Kwon Chae-woo’s reflexes were unbelievable and he was able to grab Jang Beom-hee. The two men broke out into a fight.</p>
<p>Eventually, Kwon Chae-woo pushed Jang Beom-hee against the wall again and managed to hit his head. He twisted the man’s arm and gritted his teeth as he said, “Get lost. This is my last warning. I don’t ever want to see you again.”</p>
<p>“Young master, please come back to your senses!” Jang Beom-hee pleaded. “You have to get your memory back!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s grip loosened when he heard the man start to beg.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you curious about your past?” Jang Beom-hee asked. “Don’t you want to know what kind of person you were? What kind of thoughts you had? You can’t stay here and play husband and wife forever. Don’t let that woman fool you! That woman is—”</p>
<p>“Stop.” Kwon Chae-woo went back to twisting Jang Beom-hee’s arm.</p>
<p>“Young master!”</p>
<p>But Kwon Chae-woo just shook his head. “I’ve heard enough.” When Jang Beom-hee frowned at him, he said, “I’m sorry to tell you, but I’m not interested in knowing about my past. I promised my wife that I didn’t want to know.”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee tried to speak more, but Kwon Chae-woo just twisted his arm. The man seemed used to keeping people in check.</p>
<p>“If you really know me well,” Kwon Chae-woo said. “Then, I hope you’ll shut up.”</p>
<p>“Young master, don’t be fooled!” Jang Beom-hee said. “That woman is—”</p>
<p>“I told you to stop.” Kwon Chae-woo’s voice was cold. “And stop fucking calling me that.”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee broke out into cold sweats. He tried to look at Kwon Chae-woo, but the man wouldn’t meet his eyes. He felt empty as he looked ahead at the man holding him against the wall.</p>
<p>Where had the devil in charge of the Kwon family’s hunting dogs gone?</p>
