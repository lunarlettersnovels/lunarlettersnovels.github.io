            <p><strong>Chapter 210</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes sparkled mischievously. She wasn’t holding back.</p>
<p>“Whenever I was talking to you, I was busy trying to avoid the situation by lying. I was always like that, so don’t you think I’ll make an excuse that’ll benefit me?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon laughed out loud at his voice.</p>
<p>“Why are you so easy?”</p>
<p>“… Even if you do, I don’t care about that now. That’s something I have to deal with. I want to embrace the person you are. Your sin, your debt, whatever you have.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo grabbed her wrist gently and let down everything he had. The man who decided to be stupid again looked at that one woman.</p>
<p>As her soft skin touched his sweaty hand, his sighed in relief.</p>
<p>“My heart beat me, so I lost to you.”</p>
<p>He brushed Lee-yeon’s neck with his thumb. She flinched and stepped back.</p>
<p>“You accepted a bastard like me, so why don’t you think I can’t do it?”</p>
<p>‘I could’ve pretended not to know until I die! But why…! Why can’t you! I could’ve accepted whatever person Kwon Chae-woo is…!’</p>
<p>“Do you think you’re dirtier and uglier than me, Lee-yeon?”</p>
<p>The moment she met Kwon Chae-woo’s eyes that melted with pain, Lee-yeon hit his hand away and turned like she was running away.</p>
<p>She had to escape, no matter what it took. Her body acted before her mind could catch up to the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p>Despite the sunny day outside, the hallway seemed gloomy, with no sunlight reaching its depths. Lee-yeon ran as if her life depended on it, her heart racing.</p>
<p>She sprinted away just like that day in the mountains when she had run from him. If she were caught again this time… If she allowed it to happen again… She couldn’t bear the thought. She felt a wave of nausea wash over her at the mere image of Kwon Chae-woo’s face, but she didn’t dare to stop.</p>
<p>And then, in a split second, a heavy weight pressed down on Lee-yeon’s back, and strong arms enveloped her.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!” Her voice trembled, mirroring the shiver that ran down her spine.</p>
<p>“I’m also Kwon Chae-woo, so why don’t you recognize your husband!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I’m here, Lee-yeon. I’m still here.”</p>
<p>“L, let go—“</p>
<p>“I’m your husband so why don’t you recognize me!”</p>
<p>His voice of resentment scratched Lee-yeon’s ears. Lee-yeon bit her lips and tried to push his arms away, but Kwon Chae-woo restricted her even harder.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t want to let you go, Lee-yeon. Please, don’t leave me.”</p>
<p>“Let go!”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Don’t leave. I’ll be good. Please, take me with you. I’ll do everything. Hug me too. I’ll do better.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo kept on repeating his words and dug his face on her neck. His hot and heavy breath fell on her neck. But his voice of desperation started to become chilling.</p>
<p>“Why should I be separated from you? Why aren’t we the same body? If you leave like this, I’ll be waiting for you forever. I’ll be waiting on that spot until I die. F*ck, I’ll wait even after I die.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon realized that even though Kwon Chae-woo pretended to be obedient, his true nature didn’t change.</p>
<p>“I get it, so let go first…!”</p>
<p>“No, Idon’t want to.”</p>
<p>“You asked what you can do right. You said you’ll do what I told you. Didn’t you want to change my mind even a little?’</p>
<p>She felt him flinch. As Lee-yeon quietly waited, the man slowly let her go.</p>
<p>They finally faced each other again. Kwon Chae-woo was red from the neck up and stared at Lee-yeon’s lips.</p>
<p>“If you don’t even follow one thing—“</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>He quickly cut her off.</p>
<p>“First, don’t touch me thoughtlessly.”</p>
<p>It was the moment the dominance has changed completely.</p>
<p>“Second, don’t chase me.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t move his legs like her order had chains. Kwon Chae-woo stared at Lee-yeon who was getting away as he took the call on his phone.</p>
<p>–Young master, we found him.</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee panted over the over.</p>
<p>–15 years ago, it’s driver Choi who worked at Kwon family. All the secretaries under the chairman who were in charge of Yoon Joo-ha either all died or went missing, but we found driver Choi who quit around then.</p>
<p>“Your point.’</p>
<p>–So Lee-yeon didn’t accept the reward.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo moaned that he was holding back. His face turned cold.</p>
<p>–They prepared the reward and went but she ended up refusing, and that he heard her complain about how things got annoying. Then they went to the hospital and he said he remember overhearing the phone call saying that they paid for the medical bill.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo hands started to shake. Jang Beom-hee carefully added his opinion.</p>
<p>–Young master, So Lee-yeon in this case…</p>
<p>“… I know. I understand.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t breath and he felt nauseated. He wanted to embrace everything about her but it was different when he was confirmed with truth.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo put his hand on his cheek and breathed hard. It looked like he was covering his mouth but it looked like he was trying to hold back from spilling something from inside.</p>
<p>It had been around ten days since their reunion, but it felt like an eternity had passed. And yet, it seemed like it was already too late.</p>
<p>His eyes burned as if they were on the verge of bursting.</p>
