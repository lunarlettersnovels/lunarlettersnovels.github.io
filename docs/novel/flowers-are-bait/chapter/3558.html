            <p><strong>Chapter 225</strong></p>
<p>“Give us a wide smile!”</p>
<p>Upon the makeup artist’s request, Lee-yeon forced her lips into a smile, and something sticky was applied there.</p>
<p>She had a hectic day right from the morning and had people knocking on her door.</p>
<p>They thoroughly examined Lee-yeon from head to toe, then whisked her away to a shop. There, she had to change into evening dresses dozens of times, and her tousled hair was expertly styled into gentle waves.</p>
<p>“Your image is already so clean, so we’ve chosen elaborate accessories.”</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon finally opened her eyes, she saw her unfamiliar self trapped in the mirror. A subtle touch of makeup, sharper eyes, dewy skin, and lips.</p>
<p>The emerald crystal earrings sparkled with different hues as she moved, and the snow-white dress, richly flowing below her waist, exuded elegance.</p>
<p>“I’m sure the director will be pleasantly surprised when she sees herself.”</p>
<p>However, seeing her heavily adorned appearance, Lee-yeon’s mood was sinking further and further. Kwon Chae-woo had bandages wrapped around his arms, legs, and sides, and she was wearing a white dress, entering with someone.</p>
<p>“Ms. So Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Just then, Kwon Ki-seok’s reflection appeared in the mirror. He scanned Lee-yeon’s outfit, fastening his cufflinks. Through the mirror, they exchanged different glances, one assessing and the other wary.</p>
<p>“If you find it difficult during the ceremony, feel free to let me know.”</p>
<p>He had a cold look in his eyes, but there was no sense of threat or malice. In fact, if anything, he was rather courteous.</p>
<p>“Have you made up your mind about what I proposed yesterday?”</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>“If you need more time, take it and let me know.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kwon Ki-seok grabbed her shoulders tightly. His hand on her bare skin felt cold.</p>
<p>“And please, smile.”</p>
<p>Hyedom Opening Ceremony Party.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon followed Kwon Ki-seok as they strolled beneath the glamorous chandeliers, wearing a smile that seemed to have gone through spasms. He would occasionally ask her if she was not having a hard time, but Lee-yeon found no warmth in such kindness.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the nation’s largest botanical garden was just around the corner. The event proceeded calmly and sensibly.</p>
<p>Key figures such as the mayor of Hwayang City, the Minister of Planning and Finance, and representatives from construction companies took the stage to deliver commemorative speeches and speeches.</p>
<p>When graceful applause showered down, Lee-yeon’s face remained a bit round. However, as the completed Hyedom appeared as a hologram, filling the banquet hall, she couldn’t help but let out a small sigh of admiration.</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>Hyedom felt like an earthly paradise. It was filled with unfamiliar, expensive foreign trees and flowers, perfectly recreated tropical forests, and waterfalls that brought to mind the pristine mountains of old.</p>
<p>As she toured the virtual Hyedom and clapped, the commemoration ceremony came to an end without any major incidents.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon, who had experienced all sorts of trials, could finally relax her previously tense shoulders. She watched people leaving the banquet hall as if she was waiting for something.</p>
<p>“Can we go home now?”</p>
<p>To her hesitant question, Kwon Ki-seok let out a small chuckle.</p>
<p>“No, the real business is just beginning.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember?”</p>
<p>“What—”</p>
<p>At that moment, the black blinds descended over the circular windows, which had been brightly illuminating the banquet hall. The chandeliers’ light dimmed, and the slowly closing doors kept the departing guests outside.</p>
<p>If the ceremony was any indication, about half of the attendees remained. They all stared at Kwon Ki-seok with expectant eyes.</p>
<p>With the sudden change in atmosphere, Lee-yeon felt her guard, which she had momentarily let down, creeping back up.</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok cast a meaningful glance at Lee-yeon and then proceeded to the stage.</p>
<p>The man standing in front of the microphone was shrouded in deep shadows, making his expression impossible to discern.</p>
<p>“Today, Suguk Pharmacy, after dedicating considerable resources and time, presents a new drug that we have long strived for—”</p>
<p>Just as he spoke, a small door opened, and neatly dressed servers walked in carrying champagne glasses.</p>
<p>“—for the first time.”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok tilted a velvet box over a glass filled with slightly yellowish liquid and sprinkled some powder into it. The enigmatic powder instantly created bubbles and dissolved, leaving no trace behind.</p>
<p>“It’s a type of hallucinogenic drug, similar to LSD. A few years ago, we succeeded in growing a rare, unregistered plant on a large scale after extensive research and investment, producing a substance that is over 35 times more potent than the existing hallucinogenic ingredients. This new drug, born after numerous trials and errors, is called ‘Summer.'”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kwon Ki-seok’s gaze turned in her direction.</p>
<p>“It’s a new paradigm of hallucinogen that recreates what the individual desires through memory distortion.”</p>
<p>At his words, people throughout the venue hastily raised their glasses and took a sip.</p>
<p><em>Summer.</em></p>
<p>Lee-yeon felt strangely uneasy like something was tugging at the back of her mind. She squeezed her skirt tightly with an irregularly pounding heart.</p>
<p>For a moment, the words of his former boss, Director Jo Kyung-cheon resurfaced in her mind and then vanished.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, can’t you stop here?”</p>
<p>“You have already gone up to the fourth round. You should have failed a long time ago. I think I’ve given you many chances, and if you continue like this, you will be in trouble.”</p>
<p>“As you get closer to winning the Hwaidome project, you’re bound to hear or meet them at least once.”</p>
<p>“Suguk Pharmaceuticals, the family behind it.”</p>
<p>“Innocent doctors can never bear it.”</p>
<p>Why did he try to stop Lee-yeon and subtly warn her? Lee-yeon furrowed her brow, feeling uneasy.</p>
<p><em>What am I missing?</em></p>
