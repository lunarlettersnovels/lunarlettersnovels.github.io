            <p><strong>Chapter 178</strong></p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s sharp gaze glared at Jang Beom-hee’s lips. He didn’t answer and put on a jacket. Before he left the room, his examined the empty sofa.</p>
<p>“I am, I completely destroyed it.”</p>
<p><em>It was a bad fate. So I left without leaving any hope.</em></p>
<p>If there was a problem it was that because he was no longer an observant, and he was ‘sometimes’ the husband of that woman.</p>
<p>He kept on remembering the happy time and remember her smiles but he also remembered the all the spiteful words he spat out to her.</p>
<p>He felt nauseous just smelling any perfume that didn’t smell like wet grass, and he felt randomly angry, and stopped walking when he saw trees or flowers.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo knew this emotion he couldn’t stop. He bit his tongue out of habit each time and suck on his blood.</p>
<p>“… My choice can’t be wrong.”</p>
<p>He pushed down on his eyes out of fatigue.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A white tea table that was placed in the middle of a very large and green garden.</p>
<p>A woman in wavy hair wearing elegant pearl earring and ivory dress was staring at Kwon Chae-woo dissatisfied with her arms crossed.</p>
<p>“You’re alive.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Did you know that this was for two years ago? I couldn’t believe that I was stood up for two years so I came out to see who are you are—“</p>
<p>The woman smiled satisfyingly after examining Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>“Just what were you two during that time that no one knows where you are?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The man kept his silence during all of her chatter. Ever since he walked across the garden with his hands in his pocket and sat down at the table.</p>
<p>The woman realized that Kwon Chae-woo wasn’t interested.</p>
<p>A few years had passed since the swirling rumors of her association with the wrong crowd had begun to circulate. It was during that tumultuous time that fate, in its unpredictable nature, brought her face-to-face with him.</p>
<p>Amongst the intoxicated crowd, his gaze remained sharp and vigilant, a stark contrast to the blurred visions around him.</p>
<p>She felt her eyes meet his for a brief moment, just as one of her intoxicated companions approached him and was abruptly shoved to the ground. With an air of composed detachment, the man calmly stepped on the fallen hand and continued on his way, a faint smile playing on his lips as the man cried out in pain.</p>
<p>Although years had passed since that encounter, the memory of his ethically dubious smile eluded her recollection. “The rumors are circulating because you don’t say anything. All ambitious people are trying to get involved with the Kwon family. All four of their sons aren’t married so it’s us single ladies that are being pushed.”</p>
<p>She turned to scan the huge mansion and shrugged.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have anything to ask me, Mr. Kwon Chae-woo?”</p>
<p>The man leaned against the chair arm and rested his chin on his hand. He didn’t look at the woman but instead was staring at something else.</p>
<p>As she followed Kwon Chae-woo’s gaze, there was an empty chair, and she thought for a moment before getting up.</p>
<p>“Should I move?”</p>
<p>“Stay there.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be annoying and sit.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She sat down at his order. Kwon Chae-woo wouldn’t even glance at her during all of this.</p>
<p>The woman was getting annoyed. She was the one who was use to bossing around, not the other way.</p>
<p>“Do you know what I’m going to say when I leave? That you went into a rehab because of cocaine, was involved in hit and run so had to hide in a mental hospital. Do you know how many rumors there are? It’s about time the share price of the Sooguk pharmaceutical drop and I can add to that.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo scoffed.</p>
<p>“You’re right.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>She also dropped her honorific and glared at him.</p>
<p>“I was in a hospital.”</p>
<p>She was flustered by his sudden acceptance. “… Which hospital?”</p>
<p>“The one in an island.”</p>
<p>“… W, what did you do there?”</p>
<p>“From what the doctor said, I was very good at taking care of flowers.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p><em>Taking care of flowers? How? </em>She gulped. Her voice suddenly got a bit more polite.</p>
<p>“… Were you admitted?”</p>
<p>“I was tied up.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“My hands, feet, neck. I couldn’t move.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. He was a sever patient. She had to end this. There was something you shouldn’t be doing with a crazy person.</p>
<p>But his dry yet sensitive looking eyes. His tall nose and his wide shoulders made her think twice.</p>
<p>“… Why were you in a hospital?”</p>
<p>“My head was crushed.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>She smiled awkwardly while picking up her bag. Kwon Chae-woo didn’t even glance no matter what she was doing.</p>
<p>His attention was all towards the empty chair anyway. His eyes were so concentrated it was weird.</p>
<p>“Who…. Can I say something before I go?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but saying something for being treated like air.</p>
<p>“Just what are you staring at? Is there something there?”</p>
<p>“You can’t see it right?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“The pretty woman dozing off there.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The person that couldn’t understood was scary. She frowned and took a step back.</p>
<p>“Just say you don’t like me if you don’t. Don’t joke around like that!”</p>
<p>“How nice it would be if it was a joke?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t tell if he was laughing or frowning when he finally looked at her.</p>
<p>“I stomped on her heart and she smashed my head.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s stare stopped coincidentally.</p>
<p><em>Fuck, what is that? The woman who was wearing a familiar straw hat and walking around the tree. </em>Kwon Chae-woo squinted then leaned his head back while pressing down on her eyes.</p>
<p>“… Ha.”</p>
<p><em>Wasn’t one enough? There’s more that will try to make him crazy.</em></p>
<p><em>But… why is that hallucination moving around so busily instead of dozing?</em></p>
