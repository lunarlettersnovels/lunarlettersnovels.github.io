            <p><strong>Chapter 191</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon was lifted as if she were a mere piece of cardboard when she entered the room, only to find the door swiftly locked behind her. Kwon Chae-woo gently placed the frozen Lee-yeon on the cold, hard floor.</p>
<p>“Surprised?” he asked with a hint of amusement.</p>
<p>“W-What are you doing?” Lee-yeon’s voice trembled as fear and confusion gripped her heart. The sensation of his strong arms holding her felt all too real.</p>
<p>She desperately tried to wriggle free, tugging at her top, but her attempts were futile. If anything, the heat emanating from his body only made her situation more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Let go of me…! I’m leaving!” Lee-yeon demanded, her voice shaky but defiant.</p>
<p>“Is it your pride that stops you from uttering my name?” Kwon Chae-woo inquired, his gaze steady and intense.</p>
<p>“I already told you to let go.” Her words were laced with both fear and determination.t was dark, and her mouth hurt from being held down by him.</p>
<p>“If you sleep with me one night.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon. I was notifying you. I wasn’t asking for your permission.”</p>
<p>The man lifted her up again, walked across the living room and put her on the white sheet.</p>
<p>The way he was holding her was basically like a cage. She leaned on her elbow and stood up straight.</p>
<p>“I’m going to breathe like a plant.”</p>
<p>His voice was very fatigued. He was also saying something familiar.</p>
<p>“I’ll be like old husband if you want as well.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed for a moment. Because it touched where it hurts for her.</p>
<p>“… Don’t pretend! Just act like how you are, mean and cruel. That’s better. How dare you mention my husband… I won’t forgive you!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon panted to the point where her neck got red. She loved him to best of her ability even though she was frightened, lost him, and even buried him. She went nuts as he was attempting to unlock all of that from her.</p>
<p>“Even if you try to act like him, you’re not the same so don’t even bother. I was being fooled on purpose at the time, it wasn’t like you were doing a good job acting. You’re not even close to Kwon Chae-woo…!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Just because you look the same doesn’t mean you’re the same person.”</p>
<p>Her eyes were full of hatred. It was like she was glaring at her mortal enemy that killed her husband.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo frowned and mumbled, “… My husband.” He looked like he was longing for her, yet he still frowned. His eyes became focused again.</p>
<p>He was realizing that he never received love from Lee-yeon as the hunting dog of the Kwon family. They were basically meeting for the first time in this situation.</p>
<p>But even so, it hurt him as she called him Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo. It stuck in his mouth.</p>
<p>She wasn’t calling him that, and it just proved her love for her ex-husband, but it still made him want to suck on her sweet tongue that much.</p>
<p>When she called, the idiot’s desire, no, his own desire boiled hard.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo lowered his tone even more.</p>
<p>“It’s just one night.”</p>
<p>“Just what do you—No, never mind. I can guess.”</p>
<p>She frowned. But she couldn’t let him do whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>“I’m done with you. I’m sorry, but the forest princess is buried.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“So I’m telling you I have nothing to do with you. If you really need someone, go look for her.”</p>
<p>“What can I do to make you sleep with me?”</p>
<p>She scoffed.</p>
<p>“You think that’s possible?”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll tie you?”</p>
<p>“Sure you—what?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo quickly squeezed Lee-yeon’s legs with his thigh, then tied her wrist to the head of the bed with an elastic band.</p>
<p>He was so fast; then he was done while Lee-yeon blanked out. Lee-yeon started struggling after.</p>
<p>“W, wait, are you insane?”</p>
<p>“I told you it was an ultimatum.”</p>
<p>“You really have no manners.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was angry at this nonchalant answer.</p>
<p>“No, I think you don’t know. You’re so selfish. You’re the one who destroyed my pride by saying you don’t need me anymore.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon exclaimed, her emotions running high. Kwon Chae-woo couldn’t meet her gaze and looked away.</p>
<p>“Then now you say you want to check again, so you kidnap me?”</p>
<p>“I was—“</p>
<p>“You’re not human!”</p>
<p>As she screamed, frustration boiled within her. Meanwhile, the more foolish side of Kwon Chae-woo wanted to apologize for all the pain he had caused her. Yet, he resisted the urge to spill everything he wanted to say. His suspicions lingered, preventing him from opening up completely.</p>
<p>“… Stop and sleep.”</p>
<p>He brushed her forehead like trying to calm an angry pet.</p>
<p>“Sleep and then—“</p>
<p>“How can I? I wanted to eat!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon finally started to tear up. It only took a moment to sway her emotion. She was more sad than angry now.</p>
<p>“Why do I have to hang out with you….! I also have a need that I need to fulfill! But why do you keep getting in the way? I was really desperate!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo then grabbed her chin and looked at her.</p>
<p>“Who did you want to eat?”</p>
<p>He sounded cold.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
