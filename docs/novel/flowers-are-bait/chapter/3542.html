            <p><strong>Chapter 242</strong></p>
<p>When he was waking up from his vegetative state, she remembered him asking all kinds of questions like how he became in a vegetative state, when they got married, how long they dated, why they were sexless, who was bad at it, was the intercourse bad, or was the foreplay bad.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was somewhat paying him back for that. But this time, there was no lies.</p>
<p>She giggled as she stared at the man who seemed flustered by the questions.</p>
<p>“You said I don’t know the real you. So shouldn’t you tell me when I ask you?”</p>
<p>She stared at him.</p>
<p>“Since when did you start using cello for that purpose? Do I have to wait for you to come out from jail?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo wiped the rain off of Lee-yeon’s cheek and slowly answered.</p>
<p>“… What I do involves being a part of the Kwon family, engaging in professional torture and killing. Currently, I work directly for the president, and any actions that can’t be documented are funded with confidential money. I can’t disclose more than that.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon gulped, absorbing the weight of his revelation.</p>
<p>“Do you still want to know more?” he asked.</p>
<p>She immediately shook her head. Kwon Chae-woo averted his gaze, hiding part of his face. Lee-yeon promptly pulled his hand down.</p>
<p>She was well aware of his cruelty and the abnormality of the Kwon family, yet witnessing him express shame was something new to her.</p>
<p>“I was a cellist before I became a hunting dog. My first love, four years older and from the same area, never engaged in anything improper. But… I want to do it with you.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” she stammered.</p>
<p>“I’ve only observed and learned about those kinds of things.”</p>
<p>His hand resumed caressing her lower stomach, gradually moving up to touch her underwear.</p>
<p>“When the baby is born, you just take care of your body. I’ll raise the child. I’m only 28 so it’s not too late for me to be so lewd. I want to raise the child and my pen*s as well.”</p>
<p>“W, what…”</p>
<p>“When will the baby move over for the father?”</p>
<p>He breathed heavily on her neck.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, can I just suck it for you?”</p>
<p>“… Where?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Wherever,” he replied.</p>
<p>He moved his head down from her ears to her neck, biting, sucking, and leaving marks. The intensity of his sucking increased, and as she felt the heat on her stomach and her pelvic area tense, Lee-yeon turned away and pushed him.</p>
<p>“… I think I’ll have a contraction if I feel too much,” she said.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo immediately stopped and nestled into her embrace.</p>
<p>He whispered  apologetically and proceeded to hit  his own thigh while cursing under his breath. Lee-yeon comfortingly patted him and asked, “Kwon Chae-woo, are you crying?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The suitcase kept on rolling.</p>
<p>It was the same suitcase Kwon Chae-woo threw however he wanted on the first day Lee-yeon arrived at the Kwon family house. It was in his hand again and rolling calmly against the pavement. His other hand was holding Lee-yeon’s hand.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon realized that he was walking slower on purpose but she didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>But whenever he looked back, Lee-yeon couldn’t help but feel a bit uncomfortable.</p>
<p>That was because…</p>
<p>“I really feel uneasy about leaving you here.”</p>
<p>“I’m the young master of this house, so don’t worry about it.” He reassured her.</p>
<p>“Well… Ha…!” Lee-yeon bit back the urge to raise her voice.</p>
<p>The previous night, she had attempted to create some distance between Kwon Ki-seok and Kwon Chae-woo by suggesting a visit to Hwaido, but he only responded with a vague smile.</p>
<p>Despite that, he seemed to detest any moment their bodies were not entwined, evident in the persistent contact of his bulging lower part against her .</p>
<p>They came to a conclusion after a long argument, but she couldn’t leave easily while leaving Kwon Chae-woo here.</p>
<p>“I’ll follow soon.”</p>
<p>He winked and smiled sweetly.</p>
<p>“I have zero intention on making you and our baby part of Kwon family.”</p>
<p>Unlike his calm voice, her hand hurt from his grasp.</p>
<p>“You believe me right?”</p>
<p>“… Don’t get hurt.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon covered his cheek. He closed his eyes comfortably and felt her warm hand. Lee-yeon flinched as he seemed like a well behaved pet, but she knew how cruel he can become.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you soon in Hawido, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo hid his intention and smiled.</p>
<p>To be honest, he wanted to follow Lee-yeon right away, but there were things he needed to finish. If he left everything and followed her now, Lee-yeon might get hurt.</p>
<p>When he stands in front of her again, is when the Kwon family is overtaken by him.</p>
<p>He needed to expedite the process. Trying to handle everything discreetly would take too much time. Tonight, the Kwon family would withdraw into seclusion, and the heirship would undergo a change. His gaze turned sinister.</p>
<p>“It won’t take long.”</p>
<p>“Do you know how to get to Hwaido?” Lee-yeon inquired, drawing out the conversation. Kwon Chae-woo scoffed and pulled her into an embrace.</p>
<p>“Even if my feet give out, I’ll pursue you relentlessly.”</p>
<p>“You still can’t become Kwon Chae-so,” Lee-yeon pointed out, raising her finger. Despite her words, warmth filled the man’s eyes.</p>
<p>“If you dislike that, don’texclude me anymore. I am part of your life now.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon shut her mouth like she wasn’t going to answer and Gyu-baek came running from afar.</p>
