            <p><strong>Chapter 172</strong></p>
<p>The attendee was completely frozen while looking down.</p>
<p>“W, what are you talking about…”</p>
<p>“Where is my wife?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“Don’t make me repeat myself the third time.”</p>
<p>Even though she was trained to not say anything while in the cottage, she couldn’t do anything as he was so insistent. She curled up her shoulders while stammering.</p>
<p>“What are you… Y, you’re the only one using this… cottage… ah–.”</p>
<p>The man didn’t miss her moment of hesitation.</p>
<p>“Lead the way.”</p>
<p>“What are you… That door is locked right now…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Well, the guest kept trying to escape…” Kwon Chae-woo frowned. His face was sharper from the weight loss during his sleep and that made him look even scarier.</p>
<p>“So you lock someone up?”</p>
<p>His clenched fist was pale. His sight was blurred with the vision of So Lee-yeon being locked up. He put the attendee in front of him and made her lead the way.</p>
<p>The dark hallway was dubious like inside of someone’s stomach. The marble was cold. It was when he faced the mirror while turning the corner.</p>
<p>The moment his eyes met the mirror.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘—Love, you really want to speak that bullshit?’</strong></em></p>
<p>His top swayed like he was shot.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘I’m going to destroy every single memory I had with you right here.’</strong></em></p>
<p>His dark face started convulsing.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘—No matter what you do, you can never meet you husband again.’</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>‘You should be ashamed.’</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>‘Think straight, So Lee-yeon. You really like fucking that much?’</strong></em></p>
<p>He faced the poisonous words he spat out. Was he dreaming in the middle of the day, or did he finally go insane?</p>
<p>But what seemed to be his imagination was true—</p>
<p><em><strong>‘I came to Hwaido to bury you in the first place.’</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>‘You don’t think I can choke you twice?’</strong></em></p>
<p>The memory that was locked up all started to flow in at once. His shell becoming filled up with memory. It was like Kwon Chae-woo putting together with another Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>“… Y, young master?”</p>
<p>The attendee was curiously watching him as he stopped moving, but Kwon Chae-woo didn’t even blink while staring into the mirror.</p>
<p>He left her in the even though he knew she was going to get hurt, ruined the orchestra, and crushed her as she latched onto him. He cut the Spirit Tree and even scoffed at the woman who was buried amongst the angry people.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘How did you expect me to handle you?’</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>‘I feel disgusted just looking at you.’</strong></em></p>
<p>What kind of awful feeling his incomplete had against So Lee-yeon and how he took it out.</p>
<p>Everything was clear. That moment, that debris, her eyelashes that was becoming wet.</p>
<p>All the memory came up like blister.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>The immense amount of information kept on crashing in and boiling his mind.</p>
<p>And in that moment, he saw a black hand pop out of the mirror, which was not something he expected to imagine. He froze, his eyes fixed on the hand as it grabbed his neck, choking him.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>The <em>dumb</em> Kwon Chae-woo, with his eyes completely red, started choking his neck. He was such a low state that didn’t make him look like human. He started to scratch the hunting dog and the last son of the Kwon Family.</p>
<p>Its grip of resentment made him choke and his neck twist in a weird way. Funny thing was that dumb one was the one who looked like a hunting dog.</p>
<p>Eyes of blind loyalty, habit of never letting go what it bit on, the mad dog that looks like it lost its owner. The beast that was wearing a broken leash looked quite unhappy.</p>
<p>“You’re the one that was rolling around with So Lee-yeon.” Kwon Chae-woo grabbed the dumb one’s wrist and met his eyes.</p>
<p>“There’s only one dick, but it still felt like there was two of us and made me feel dirty.”</p>
<p>The dumb one growled.</p>
<p>“If you’re the one that So Lee-yeon made—“</p>
<p>It was only a season living as So Lee-yeon’s husband. But that short summer day was so strong that it could reinvent Kwon Chae-woo’s life. Before he could think, he pressed his hand against the dumb one’s face.</p>
<p>“I will have it all.” Jealousy and greed, even if it’s himself, he whispered that he will have it all.</p>
<p>The dumb one tried to resist, but Kwon Chae-woo kept on grasping harder.</p>
<p>He was crumbling the other’s face as he heard some awful laughter.</p>
<p>The mirror cracked just for him. The dumb one was laughing joyfully.</p>
<p>The black hair that was melting like paint, the eyes of a beast that showed through that. It was his face that he saw. It was himself that he saw through the cracked mirror, not the dumb one.</p>
<p>“Ha… Ha…”</p>
<p>He was covered in cold sweat.</p>
<p>The complete different two worlds absorbed into each other without a trace.</p>
<p>The dumb one consumed the hunting dog and vice versa. They consumed each other.</p>
<p>“…. Y, young master, are you ok?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m a mess.”</p>
<p>“If you’re not feeling well—“</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo walked passed the attendee without a word.</p>
<p>It didn’t make sense that So Lee-yeon was staying at his home, but if something did happen while he was asleep—,</p>
<p>His legs didn’t feel like his as he was walking down the hallway. There was nothing nice to be said between him and So Lee-yeon but for some reason he was in a rush.</p>
<p>He wanted to rub his face against her knees saying her husband is back, but at the same time he felt like he was going to say all the mean things.</p>
<p>But when he forced himself into the guest room, there was no one there.</p>
<p>He stood there looking at the empty room.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo.”</p>
<p>As he turned his head towards the voice that annoyed him, Kwon Ki-seok was glancing at him while fixing his cuffs.</p>
<p>“Has it been a month since I saw your face? Or 2 years?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s eyebrow lifted slightly.</p>
