            <p><strong>Chapter 171</strong></p>
<p>His voice was shaking for the first time.</p>
<p>The child slowly went towards the bed. He rubbed his eyes as he saw Kwon Chae-woo who wasn’t moving at all and kept on rubbing his eyes over and over again.</p>
<p>“It’s the male. The male! That male from our place…!”</p>
<p>His voice started to gain confidence.</p>
<p>“It’s really almost our male!”</p>
<p>Gyu-baek was so excited as if he found something he lost.</p>
<p>“Where were you all this time!”</p>
<p>Gyu-baek grabbed his hands and started to shake Kwon Chae-woo, begging him to wake up.</p>
<p>“Our male consists of head, body, and legs, with two arms and two legs so a perfect body. His length is longer than a bed, big hands and feet and his nose is sharp. His genital—“</p>
<p>At that moment, the door was opened roughly and Jang Beom-hee locked him up by his side quickly. It seemed like it wasn’t the first time as they both looked like they were used to the situation.</p>
<p>Gyu-baek’s eyes was moist while being carried out.</p>
<p>The moment the door closed, Kwon Chae-woo lids started trembling.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was chewing on her nails while pacing around the living room.</p>
<p>The police said they will review the plate number but that didn’t really give her hope.</p>
<p>There will be nothing they can figure out. She was ready to bet everything that they will come back empty handed.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon brushed her face while sitting down on the sofa.</p>
<p>She knew where Gyu-baek was. She also knew the quickest and easiest way to find the child.</p>
<p>The car that took Kwon Chae-woo had high chance of going back to its home and all she had to do was ask Kwon Ki-seok.</p>
<p>But as she was about to do this, she was reminded of Director Jo’s words.</p>
<p><strong>‘Just avoid anyone with last name Kwon.’</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon looked down at her phone.</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok and the slaughter house, and Kwon Chae-woo who was burying someone in the mountain.</p>
<p>It might be time for her to face the fact that she didn’t seek out. If she called, there was no turning back. She could feel her whole body pounding.</p>
<p><em>Don’t be afraid. Kwon Chae-woo is dead and only think about Gyu-baek.</em></p>
<p>She touched the screen and put the phone to her ears. The ringing felt like a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>– You’re late.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon bit her lower lip. Her throat was tight and she was having cold sweat.</p>
<p>– You wouldn’t be calling just to ask how I am.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>– It seems like you have a favour to ask, Miss So Lee-yeon. Or resentment.</p>
<p>“… I was hoping you could check something.”</p>
<p>– Chae-woo is well.</p>
<p>“N, no. Not him…!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon froze for a moment.</p>
<p>“Gyu-baek. He’s small for an eight-year old and he was carried in the trunk.”</p>
<p>– Ah, I see.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon became nervous at such lazy response.</p>
<p>“Your people must have found him. Is Gyu-baek well? Check now—“</p>
<p>– Ask more politely.</p>
<p>“… Pardon?”</p>
<p>–If I hang up now, it’ll be an hour before the next call.</p>
<p>“W-wait!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stood up from the sofa and the cold voice hit her.</p>
<p>– I’ve never missed something that came into my hand.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>– Even if I did, I always somehow get what I want.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>This wasn’t a good sign. By the tone of his voice, Lee-yeon knew Kwon Ki-seok had no inkling to send the lost child back home.</p>
<p>He was trying to negotiate with her.</p>
<p>– So think carefully before you say anything. If you’re trying to take what’s mine, what can you give me?</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>“I, I’m Kwon Chae-woo’s wife.”</strong></em></p>
<p>When he opened his eyes, his lips were blue like a frozen person. His body was shaking strangely like his body temperature was lower than normal.</p>
<p>Judging from the cool air, it seemed like the day has cooled while he was asleep.</p>
<p>Just how has he been sleeping?</p>
<p>He pressed down on his temple and said something.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>He fumbled his side. But the only thing he was feeling was a blanket. He was alone in this big bed.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The man tried to wrap his head around the situation. A familiar yet unfamiliar room.</p>
<p><em>Lee-yeon</em>. He kept on clenching his cold hand and kept on calling her but there was no answer.</p>
<p>He leaned against the mattress on his elbow and lifted his top. His eyes and body were both loose.</p>
<p><em>Lee-yeon, I had a horrible nightmare</em>. He kept on scoffing while brushing his face. He wanted to breathe her in and hug her tight.</p>
<p><em>It was such a random dream. </em>He wanted to act childish and wanted to kiss her soft skin.</p>
<p>His half opened eyes went towards the door. It felt like Lee-yeon would open that door and run into his arms at any moment.</p>
<p>Then tell him how the Spirit Tree has recovered, what she wanted to do after the tournament. He wanted to put her between his legs and listen. He wanted to wrap his arms around her skinny belly and put his chin against her shoulders.</p>
<p>But the silence that was interrupted by the humidifier was making his heart beat. It wasn’t like they repainted the room but the unique smell of a tree hospital was gone like a dream.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo stood up in the end while clenching his teeth and opened the curtain.</p>
<p>The garden that looked endless.</p>
<p>“… What happened?”</p>
<p>The man’s face instantly changed. His loose eyes from the drug instantly sharpened up.</p>
<p>This was his home.</p>
<p>The light in front his face disappeared and his head was in chaos. Two very separate memories were clashing with each other.</p>
<p>While two different ego within him was battling, a headache came in. He frowned and kept up hitting his head.</p>
<p>It felt like he was going to remember something, but nothing came up in the end.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Then Kwon Chae-woo moved instinctively.</p>
<p>He stop thinking about his chaos mind and let his body do what seemed more urgent, like thirst. He followed what his body was remembering, not his mind.</p>
<p>He opened the door roughly and grabbed the attendee who was watering flower.</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness…!”</p>
<p>He grabbed the vase and took out the floor. The old attendee was surprised to see a tall man drinking out of a flower vase. The water was pouring down his throat like sweet nectar.</p>
<p>He drank it all and then threw it on the ground while asking. The flower in his hand was crushed.</p>
<p>“Where is the woman that came with me?”</p>
<p>“… Pardon?”</p>
