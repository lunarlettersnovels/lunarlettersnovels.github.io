            <p><strong>Chapter 19</strong></p>
<p>A sharp sound reached his ears. Kwon Chae-woo blinked and raised his hands in front of him to brace against the sunlight pouring in. But before he could, the back of his hand collided with something… someone. He turned to his side, frowning in puzzlement.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was sleeping beside him. She clung to his arms. Kwon Chae-woo stiffened. He forgot what he was going to say. He felt fully awake as though a bucket of ice water had been upended on his head. He vaguely remembered having a painful nightmare but all that disappeared when he saw her.</p>
<p><em>Seems like this man named Kwon Chae-woo was born stupid. My head goes blank at the slightest touch from her.</em></p>
<p><em>So Lee-yeon.</em></p>
<p><em>My wife.</em></p>
<p><em>A tree doctor.</em></p>
<p><em>An accident.</em></p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo looked at the woman at his side and pondered a few things that came to his mind. All the information he heard and found out was nothing special. He clicked his tongue as if he was annoyed. He remembered the first time he saw her. The day he finally became conscious, hers was the only face etched into his memory. He still remembered the strange smell of wet grass and dirt that tickled his nose when he was near her.</p>
<p>Memory loss came as a big blow. He felt more nauseous and frustrated than he thought he would be. In place of everything he might have ever done from his birth, only one face lingered. He didn’t remember his family, his friends, his life. Only her.</p>
<p>It had been instinct. It hadn’t taken him long to make up his mind. The only thing in his empty head was her face, so he accepted her. But the more he got to know her, the stranger he found things relating to So Lee-yeon.</p>
<p><em>“A wife you can’t even remember suddenly appeared in front of you. I was worried about how uncomfortable this would be for you, so that’s why….”</em></p>
<p><em>“No. I could tell at a glance why you are my wife and why you have to be my wife.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I couldn’t take my eyes off of you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Kwon, Kwon Chae-woo. Kwon Chae-woo.”</em></p>
<p>But although her mouth claimed that she was his wife, her body didn’t stop trembling whenever he came close to her. Her eyes always filled with fear. Her fingers had no ring marks to indicate a wedding ring. Her house had no wedding photos of them.</p>
<p>There was no sign of delight when she saw him, only fear. Every time he moved, she flinched. Sometimes, he wanted to gently hold her chin, turn her to face him and ask, “You are my everything in this world. But why are you so afraid of me?” He wanted to ask her why she had nursed him back to health if she didn’t want him anymore.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” said Lee-yeon, waking up and rubbing her eyes.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo stared at her with his chin resting on his hand and did not answer. Lee-yeon’s face slowly hardened.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong></strong>Lee-yeon was on her guard, studying his face. Kwon Chae-woo could even hear her racing heartbeat. <em>Look at her,</em> he lifted an eyebrow and thought to himself. <em>Was Kwon Chae-woo really kind and gentle?</em></p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, have you been doing okay?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I… yes…”</p>
<p>“I have been feeling under the weather. How long did I sleep?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon slowly lowered her shoulders in relief at his gentle voice. “A week and a day.”</p>
<p>He stretched his neck to loosen the stiffness. There was a cracking noise. “Hm… now I know for sure.”</p>
<p>“Know what?”</p>
<p>“That you hold my mornings.”</p>
<p>Professional findings and examinations didn’t matter to him. When Lee-yeon slept by his side, he slept peacefully and woke up normally. Without her, he was unable to wake up.</p>
<p>“I also want to leave my night to you.”</p>
<p>She winced and her face stiffened. She desperately tried to hide her feelings, but he knew what she was thinking. He knew she wanted to run away from him. He found it sad seeing her make an attempt to smile at that, not realizing that he had already read her mind.</p>
<p>Perhaps So Lee-yeon had been waiting for the perfect time to escape from him this whole time just like the door of her room that didn’t open no matter how hard he knocked. But he didn’t know for sure. It was something he needed to figure out on his own. But, in any case, he didn’t want to let her go.</p>
<p><em>What kind of idiot would let go of the only memory he has? </em>She was his everything in this world and Kwon Chae-woo was ready to become anything she wanted. He would be the ‘kind and gentle’ husband she wished for. <em>If that is what she wants.</em></p>
<p>He would do anything to make her comfortable so that she might confess everything that might have happened.</p>
<p>So Lee-yeon running away from him—</p>
<p>And Kwon Chae-woo making her stay.</p>
<p>No one knew who would do better.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, sleep with me from today.”</p>
<p>The way she tried to avoid his gaze. Kwon Chae-woo lowered his gaze and in doing so, noticed her wet sleeves. <em>Ah… now I understand why my eyes sting. </em>He felt a warmth spreading in his chest. He covered his face with his hands trying to hide his smile.</p>
