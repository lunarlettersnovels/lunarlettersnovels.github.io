            <p><strong>Chapter 123</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon had no idea what he was talking about. She couldn’t understand this sudden change.</p>
<p>Despite being face to face, she couldn’t see him, and words kept coming out of his mouth, but it wasn’t the conversation she expected. For the first time in a long time, she felt a barrier between them as if he were a stranger.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon clenched her hands nervously. On such a good day, she didn’t want him to see how scared she was.</p>
<p>“…Chae-woo, I don’t know what you’re talking about all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>“I asked what you would think if I killed Ki-seok.”</p>
<p>The light voice in which he spoke felt even more foreign to her because of its flat tone. As expected, she hadn’t misheard him. Lee-yeon’s lips were dry when she replied, “Let me turn on the light first.”</p>
<p>When she moved to get up and turn on the light, Chase-woo grabbed Lee-yeon’s face roughly and turned it towards him so she could see his reaction. The tips of their noses were smushed together.</p>
<p>“Is that your answer?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I think showing your back to me now means only one thing.”</p>
<p>“No. That’s not it. I just want to be able to see your face.”</p>
<p>“Say it here.”</p>
<p>Seeing Chae-woo suddenly acting so oppressive, Lee-yeon had trouble focusing. When their eyes met, she could feel he was too dark, too close. It was like being swallowed up by a huge blob. In her confusion, she suddenly blurted out a thought that had not crossed her mind before now.</p>
<p>“…Are you really Chae-woo?”</p>
<p>For a split second his grip loosened, but he soon recovered himself and tightened his hold on her. Lee-yeon half forced her eyes to stay fixed on him.</p>
<p>“If I’m not your husband, then who the hell am I?” His empty eyes and tone were unchanged. “Who was the one who paved the way to turn me into this?”</p>
<p>“But, but why….”</p>
<p>“You smell like cigarettes, like you’ve been in an enclosed space with someone.” He leaned his head close to her ear and inhaled. “And I’m pretty sure that someone was Ki-seok.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“All I did today was obediently wait around for you. No matter how much I think about it, I don’t think being a pathetic little watchdog really suits me.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, she realized that Chae-woo was scrutinizing her closely, trying to read her reaction. Despite their proximity, she couldn’t hear the sound of his breathing as his eyes slowly scanned her face.</p>
<p>The longer she waited to answer, the more it seemed as though this strange confrontation would never end. However, seeing how unstable Chae-woo looked, Lee-yeon decided to set aside her own turbulent emotions for now.</p>
<p>Of course, he’s frustrated and angry.</p>
<p>It’s natural that he would be feeling this way after waking up a month later, seeing how much time has passed, and realizing that while everything around him changed little by little, he alone remained the same.</p>
<p>She gently stroked the back of his hand, believing him to be in a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>“…Do you remember what I told you before? I only ever want you to see things that are good and beautiful. I’m someone who saves trees. I can’t help you with that, with what you want to do.” Lee-yeon glanced at him furtively and continued, “So, if you want my opinion, I’m against it. Killing him? I, I can’t even fathom doing something like that. All I’m going to do is continue planting flowers in the front yard no matter what.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“And if you’re asking me how I’d feel, I’d mourn Ki-seok’s death for sure, but I’d get over it quickly. Our relationship was terrible, but I’ve always liked trees more than people. However-,” she paused momentarily and drew in a breath. “I’m worried about myself. I feel like I’ll be more hesitant then to touch you or be with you.”</p>
<p>She could feel Chae-woo’s body go stiff at that moment.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I’ll get scared and my heart will waver when I kiss and hug you.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Is that what you want?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s voice trembled as she spoke but she kept her gaze steady. Chae-woo burst into huffs of laughter and let go of her face. She immediately rubbed the sides of her hair and shot him a sideways glance.</p>
<p>Chae-woo was already far away, rubbing his face with his hands. When she saw how frustrated he seemed, her heart sank. He was a straightforward and simple man, but she suddenly felt troubled and hopeless.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo. First, we should go to the hospital and have you examined-”</p>
<p>“Examined? For what?” he interjected, his voice sharp and defiant. Without realizing what she was doing, Lee-yeon held out one hand as if to keep a safe distance between them. She approached him carefully one step at a time as he was a vicious hound.</p>
<p>“You know, you suddenly woke up after being asleep for a month so it’s natural to be confused. The doctor also asked me to call him as soon as you wake up and it seems like you’re very sensitive right now. I understand it’s a lot to take in right now.”</p>
<p>“So you think something’s wrong with me?” Chae-woo gazed at her, a smirk stretched across his face. “My head has never been clearer.”</p>
<p>“…Well then, that’s a relief.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon clasped her hands together hesitantly. Their conversation suddenly at an end, the two stood there awkwardly for some time.</p>
<p>Chae-woo kept his eyes on her, scanning her body, the tips of her nails, as if he were deciphering a text written in foreign language. Not knowing how to react to his blatant staring, Lee-yeon eventually turned toward the bedroom.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo, then……. I’ll wash up first.”</p>
<p>Her shirt flowed behind her like she was standing in front of a fan. Lee-yeon looked back several times as she moved. Something more uncomfortable than dry sweat made her hair stand on end, but he only nodded showing little other reaction.</p>
<p>Soon after the bathroom door closed, Chae-woo finally let out the breath he’d been holding in. His face, which had just barely passed him off as the role of her husband, hardened coldly. The change was instantaneous.</p>
<p>“All this time it’s like I’ve been possessed.”</p>
<p>The scent of her body was his first battle. The slightly sweaty smell was particularly stimulating, and he nearly licked his lips at the sight of the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>Even more so, when her soft breasts had pressed against his lower abdomen, his head throbbed. Playing the part of a good husband wasn’t as easy as he thought it would be.</p>
<p>Just then, the door suddenly swung open and Lee-yeon ran out of the bedroom. The man quickly shook off the frost that had frozen over his expression as she breathed heavily, her ears red.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo, are you—!”</p>
<p>There was tension in her urgent tone. Lee-yeon licked her rough lips and hugged her arms around herself tightly as if trying to control her racing pulse. It had just hit her.</p>
<p>“Have I been a complete idiot?”</p>
<p>At that, Chae-woo squinted warily.</p>
<p>“Your d*ck, no no, I mean, down there, did you really just want me to do that and I was just too dense to realize it? Chae-woo, is that what you needed?</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Will it help you calm down?”</p>
<p>How would the idiot version of Chae-woo have responded to this?</p>
<p>He recalled the report Beom-hee had shown him and carefully considered the way the two of them had spoken to each other, but he still failed to find an appropriate response. In the meantime he felt himself harden as if a heavy fist was pushing against the inside of his pants.</p>
<p><em>Damn it, I’m going crazy,</em> he thought to himself, chewing on his own swears.</p>
<p>His body reacted too quickly. Chae-woo managed to pass himself off as the loving husband by staring at her red lips.</p>
<p>“…It’s not like that, so hurry up and finish washing up.”</p>
<p>“Then you don’t want to do it today?”</p>
<p>He looked at the ceiling as if something was caught in his throat. “We have a lot to catch up on.”</p>
<p>They left it at that, and Lee-yeon went back into the bathroom. Chae-woo opened and closed his trembling eyelids, trying to suppress his temper which threatened to burst at any moment. Despite his efforts, the desire to conquer, a feeling far from affection, finally stuck out its head.</p>
<p>“Ha, you must really have a death wish.”</p>
