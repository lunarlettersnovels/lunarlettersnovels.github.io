            <p><strong>Chapter 54</strong></p>
<p>It was dark outside. It’s an everyday routine for sky to turn gloomy for some people by the time night arrives.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was staring at the man that was sobbing like he was having a nightmare. The man who was aggressive, wily, and was extreme during the day became a weak boy each night.</p>
<p><em>One hardly knows who really wants to cry.</em></p>
<p>“Go,” Inhaling heavily, Kwon Chae-woo whispered.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon chose to stay silent and be by his side.</p>
<p>“I’ll come…” He continued murmuring one thing or other which she couldn’t decipher.</p>
<p>Another set of tears escaped his eyes which Lee-yeon wiped with calm expression. Whenever she watched Kwon Chae-woo’s nights, her heart felt heavy. <em>Why is this man so sad?</em></p>
<p>One day he was looking for someone, someday he was hiding it, some day he was running away. <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Lee-yeon stood up. She couldn’t bear watching his trembling lips. His condition was deeply affecting her. But for some reason, she didn’t want to leave him alone tonight.</p>
<p>She slowly made her way outside and went downstairs. The office that was filled of smell of soil and herbs was now messy with bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>She opened drawer after drawer, rummaging each one for a while. Finally, she fished her hand out with an old CD. Her eyes were glistening with happiness.</p>
<p>That CD was the first gift she received from someone special. This memory is also linked with the first tree.</p>
<p>Her fingers stopped at the roughness behind the old surface of CD. It was a classic record. Noting down one of the titles in her cell phone’s notepad, she placed CD back inside her drawer.</p>
<p>Going upstairs, her footsteps were light. She again lied beside Kwon Chae-woo and played must on her smartphone.</p>
<p>[Bach: Suite for Cello Solo No. 1 In G, BWV 1007-1. Prelude]</p>
<p>Only the man’s crying mixed with the melody of this masterpiece was being absorbed with the night like moonlight. Otherwise, the room was quiet and only had a sleeping lamp on.</p>
<p>While listening to the music she missed for the longest time, Lee-yeon was hoping Kwon Chae-woo would fall into deep slumber.</p>
<p>For the first time, moons and stars together witnessed how the man’s crying started to calm.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“You just have to go and smile!”</p>
<p>“But I still don’t want to do that.” Lee-yeon frowned and turned her head.</p>
<p>Choo-ja who was shaking evening dress covered in a vinyl bag glared at her.</p>
<p>Today, there was a celebration party for the owner of Joorim Seedling Park Limited, an agricultural corporation celebrating 40th year.</p>
<p>For all the people working in agriculture or forest industry, Chairman Lim has been that superstar who cannot be forgotten. He has been effectively maintaining this region for years. And Choo-ja strongly felt Lee-yeon should show up before him.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon opposed the thought. She didn’t want to do it because of the dress Choo-ja was holding.</p>
<p>As Choo-ja noticed the way Lee-yeon was looking at it, she spoke first. “Not again! It’s not revealing and looks nice.” Choo-ja knows how Lee-yeon preferred to keep herself wrapped completely and was extremely careful when choosing a dress for her.</p>
<p>The calm mermaid dress with square neck.</p>
<p>Because of thick green, it looked elegant. The length that reached her calves and the line that emphasized her waist was luxurious.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon, who was looking at it without any expression, pointed at her bedroom, “In my closet, I have lots to wear.”</p>
<p>“Please! Those aren’t clothes but mere covers.” Choo-ja flashed her eyes like she wouldn’t back down.<strong></strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong></strong>Kwon Chae-woo walked downstairs.</p>
<p>His black suit highlighted long legs and straight shoulder line. Suit covering him looked like his natural skin. Neither did he pull the sleeves up or stretched his neck while touching the collars.</p>
<p>Hair which reached underneath his eyebrows, untied tie and white socks—he looked dishevelled but nonetheless dashing. Lee-yeon couldn’t take her eyes off him.</p>
<p>It felt as if she never knew this man. The shiny black raincoat. Loose patient clothes. Her mind suddenly popped up a nonsense thought. <em>What if he’s not the real Kwon Chae-woo?</em></p>
<p>And this thought nowhere made her happy.</p>
<p>Choo-ja’s voice broke her trance. “Now I can only trust my son-in-law.” She handed over Lee-yeon’s clothes to Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo was quick in exchanging glances between dress in his hold and pouting Lee-yeon. Understanding, he lifted the tip of his lips.</p>
<p>“I believe in you.”</p>
<p>“Choo-ja-” Lee-yeon glare-warned her but Choo-ja turned her back pretending she saw no warnings coming her way. Her ability to ignore was as high class as her quick wit.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like Choo-ja didn’t know why Lee-yeon was trying to cover herself. She knew her story inside out, nonetheless she was hoping for a change. She wasn’t in a rush after 10 years long wait. But this seemed a great opportunity to initiate the same.</p>
<p>Someday, Lee-yeon has to come out of her cocoon and turn into a butterfly.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, you don’t like this?”</p>
<p>She refused to answer.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo lifted his eyebrow and crossed his arms. “Then I’ll use it on this.”</p>
<p>“Use what?”</p>
<p>“My wish.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon remember you told me you’ll do anything that I asked once but touching?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon opened and closed her mouth. She was not in a position to speak.</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t for that, why would I have stopped? There was so much more for me to lick.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was blank. Kwon Chae-woo’s wit left her flabbergasted.</p>
