        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 190</strong></p>
<p>In the first place, rejecting one’s own family and following a kidnapper were fundamental contradictions within Kwon Chae-woo himself. Being trapped in such gray areas always felt precarious, as if standing on a shaky bridge, making him appear distorted as a human being.</p>
<p>Feeling suffocated by the disrupted balance, Kwon Chae-woo realized the need to confront it again.</p>
<p>“If you’ve stolen something, you should know that eventually, your belongings might get stolen too.”</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Kwon Ki-seok met his gaze directly and murmured. It was unclear to whom he was speaking, but an inner impulse surged within Kwon Chae-woo, making his heart throb.</p>
<p>When he returned to his senses, he noticed that the front seat was now empty, and Kwon Chae-woo immediately erased his expression and dialed Jang Beom-hee’s number. A mysterious intuition had heightened his alertness.</p>
<p>– Yes, Master.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>– Master?</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Kwon Chae-woo’s gaze was stolen by the sound of cheerful scissor-cutting coming from Lee-yeon, who was standing on the folding ladder. She was skillfully trimming the branches, and every time Lee-yeon twisted her waist or moved her arms even slightly, Kwon Chae-woo’s fingers trembled involuntarily, his face expressionless.</p>
<p>While the harmless (apparition) Lee-yeon continued to sleep, the Lee-yeon that provoked him remained active, wielding scissors. Kwon Chae-woo splashed water on his tired face as if performing a dry ritual.</p>
<p>If it were true that Lee-yeon was the bait, then Kwon Chae-woo would be trying to catch it, not Kwon Ki-seok.</p>
<p>His ultimate goal as the eldest son, who had recovered the lost youngest sibling, punished the kidnapper, and rallied the family with duty and responsibility, would be the aching finger of the Kwon family, the embodiment of vengeance.</p>
<p>It’s always Kwon Ki-seok’s will that prevails.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo decided to follow his instincts as a man, something he had never doubted before.</p>
<p>“Yoon Joo-ha…”</p>
<p>A low, husky voice flowed out. The grudge between his parents and Yoon Joo-ha had been valid and fair, leaving no room for further doubts. So now…</p>
<p>“I need to find out about Kwon Ki-seok’s relationship.”</p>
<p>Even with his wavering gaze, he continued to stare persistently at Lee-yeon in the distance.</p>
<p>Instead of rushing in like a wild horse as he did on the first day, he only sent glances toward Lee-yeon as if observing her. Lee-yeon grew increasingly uneasy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Grumble… grumble…</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon, who had been staring at the pattern on the ceiling wallpaper, sighed and stood up.</p>
<p>She couldn’t fall asleep because she was extremely hungry.</p>
<p>Ignoring her half-hearted attempt at a meal, her heart continued to race, urging her on like a wild horse until the food lodged in her mind was resolved.</p>
<p>Even though she wasn’t usually someone with a strong appetite, perhaps due to the influence of pregnancy, it was difficult for her to resist the impulse to the point that tears welled up if she couldn’t have it.</p>
<p>The crispy scrambled eggs and tangy cherry tomatoes. Just the thought of the softly cooked eggs melting in her mouth made her salivate.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Having imagined the savory flavor and refreshing juiciness multiple times, she finally extended her legs out of bed.</p>
<p>However, when she stopped by the kitchen in the main house where she currently resides and opened the refrigerator…</p>
<p>“Ugh… My eggs!”</p>
<p>Of all things, the eggs compartments were empty.</p>
<p>Feeling anxious, she wandered around the kitchen and impulsively decided to go outside. She didn’t want to be caught eating something at such a late hour, but it should be fine if it was the servants’ quarters. With a rough idea of the mansion’s layout, Lee-yeon stealthily moved her steps.</p>
<p>“Where are you going like a rat?”</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon turned around, pressing her hand against her chest.</p>
<p>“You almost scared me!”</p>
<p>She scolded the person behind her, shouting in surprise.</p>
<p>“What almost scared you?”</p>
<p>In response to the emotionless inquiry, Lee-yeon shook her head and said, “Ah, it’s nothing.” She bit her lip, suppressing her pounding heart. She couldn’t hide her surprise, her eyes not showing any signs of being composed.</p>
<p>“I asked where you were going on a night like this, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, dressed comfortably, looked at her with half-lowered, sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>“…Why does it matter where I go?”</p>
<p>“If you keep going straight there, do you know what you’ll find?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo pointed with a nod of his chin towards the path Lee-yeon was heading.</p>
<p>“It’s not just inhabited by ordinary people.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon brushed off her forearm at the low and meaningful voice. However, she didn’t retort and abruptly changed direction. Despite having memorized the route during the day, she seemed confused as night fell.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing there.”</p>
<p>Nonchalantly, he added without hesitation as he followed along.</p>
<p>Ignoring his words, Lee-yeon kept walking, but there seemed no end, no matter how far she went.</p>
<p>The only certainty was that this path wasn’t the right one. With a sense of defeat, Lee-yeon tightly held onto the edge of her cardigan.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, I’ll guide you. I won’t let you get lost.”</p>
<p>He appeared much more composed in various ways compared to the first day. His breathing, voice, and manner of speaking were calm and steady, without any trace of aggression.</p>
<p>Even in the darkness, his unwavering gaze followed her, but still, he seemed remarkably more docile, enough to bring back memories of the past Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>“…It’s the servants’ quarters.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon still refused to meet his gaze.</p>
<p>“Why there?”</p>
<p>“You said you would guide me.”</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon coolly passed by, Kwon Chae-woo silently followed. The two remained quiet as they searched for the way, but at some point, the man stepped ahead and gently guided Lee-yeon along the path.</p>
<p>It was a cool autumn night. Lee-yeon briefly glanced at the man’s back filling her field of vision before lowering her head. She only looked at her footsteps as she followed along.</p>
<p>“We’ve arrived.”</p>
<p>As Kwon Chae-woo spoke, Lee-yeon raised her head.</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>Where is this? It wasn’t this layout before. Just as she was about to turn her head, a firm hand wrapped around her from behind.</p>
<p>Under the strong grip, her mouth was shut, and her waist bent.</p>
<p>“Uh…!”</p>
<p>As the familiar scent enveloped her, Lee-yeon was lifted as if bound by her body. Perhaps due to the height difference, she effortlessly rose like a ballerina, and her legs dangled in the air.</p>
<p>“Uh, uh…!”</p>
<p>“Stay still. I told you I wouldn’t harm you.”</p>
<p>A low voice scratched her ear. The tone sounded polite, but there was a hint of sensitivity.</p>
<p>“Uh!”</p>
<p>“Because there’s something I want to confirm.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s steps as he passed through the dark corridor were leisurely. However, Lee-yeon could feel the rapid heartbeat coming from their proximity.</p>
<p>His muscular arm firmly wrapped around her waist, and his palm supported her just below her chest.</p>
<p>“Tonight, all you have to do is sleep with me.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon felt suffocated by the force that imprisoned her.</p>
