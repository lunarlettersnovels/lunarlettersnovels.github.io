            <p><strong>Chapter 226</strong></p>
<p>Just then, as if to interrupt Lee-yeon’s thoughts, a glass was pushed in front of her. Kwon Ki-seok, who had appeared out of nowhere, held out a glass filled with “Summer.” She had no intention of drinking, not even a sip, but Lee-yeon quietly accepted the glass.</p>
<p><em>Summer, Summer…</em> While Lee-yeon was absorbed in her thoughts, people who had taken the drug began to show reactions, bit by bit.</p>
<p>They spoke to the empty air, moved like they were dancing, but their reactions could be broadly divided into two types:</p>
<p>They laughed or cried.</p>
<p>The amplitude of these simple emotions was palpable. Surprisingly, no one exhibited extreme behavior. Clearly, they had taken drugs, but they held their hands together as if they had witnessed a god.</p>
<p>“Each one will meet what they’ve been yearning for.”</p>
<p>Jo Kyung-cheon, Hwaidome, the drug fields, Suguk Pharmaceuticals, and Kwon Ki-seok with the new drug Summer—all these things were scratching at some sensitive nerve in Lee-yeon. The picture felt elusive, like something almost in reach but not quite.</p>
<p>“In the near future, the landscape of desires and pleasures will change. People will want to stay in the world of fantasy longer than reality.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, do you have something you’re yearning for?”</p>
<p>“Yoon Joo-ha.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s mouth opened involuntarily.</p>
<p>“Is it by any chance derived from Yoon Joo-ha’s name, this name ‘Summer’?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon followed her intuition. Wasn’t the name ‘Summer’ taken from the summer part of Yoon Joo-ha (夏)?</p>
<p>In that moment, Kwon Ki-seok’s demeanor dramatically changed. It was like the sound of a single streak of gold going through the frozen ice. Kwon Ki-seok stared at Lee-yeon with eyes that seemed to be teeming with all sorts of maggots.</p>
<p>“Now you’re babbling about Yoon Joo-ha, like everybody else.”</p>
<p>His snake-like eyes bore into Lee-yeon, and despite not saying a word, there was something palpable. More than emotions, it was something closer to madness that emanated from Kwon Ki-seok.</p>
<p>Just receiving that gaze, Lee-yeon’s fingertips stiffened, and her insides writhed.</p>
<p>As he bent over, he whispered in Lee-yeon’s ear.</p>
<p>“Do you know why Yoon Joo-ha died?”</p>
<p>Their faces were so close that their noses almost touched, and strangely, she felt short of breath.</p>
<p>“Why should I even mention that hateful woman’s name—”</p>
<p>Then, something like a wooden stick forcefully wedged itself between the two of them.</p>
<p>“Both of you, separate a bit.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Startled, Lee-yeon turned her head, and there was Kwon Chae-woo, standing upright with a crutch.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>For a moment, Lee-yeon’s heart raced, and her gaze lingered on the empty glass that he was clutching. As it sunk in that a sick patient had consumed something deadly, she pushed aside the overwhelming panic and started to think.</p>
<p>“Did you wear your school uniform today?”</p>
<p>…What?</p>
<p>“What are you saying? What’s happening—”</p>
<p>Strangely, Kwon Chae-woo, who appeared somewhat innocent, tilted his chin.</p>
<p>“Did you not want to hear me play today?”</p>
<p>What’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>A few moments ago:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Where on earth are you going in that condition?”</em></p>
<p><em>Jang Beom-hee fiercely prevented Kwon Chae-woo from leaving the room.</em></p>
<p><em>Last night, Jang Beom-hee had no qualms about lowering his head and telling Lee-yeon, who had guarded the spot all night, not to wake him up…!</em></p>
<p><em>“There’s nothing good about rushing out like this, Young Master!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Who’s worrying about the damn dogs? Where’s So Lee-yeon?”</em></p>
<p><em>“What?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I need to confirm with my own eyes that she’s unharmed. If you’re not going to bring her, get out of the way.”</em></p>
<p><em>Kwon Chae-woo pressed on relentlessly, focusing on one person.</em></p>
<p><em>“Where is Lee-yeon now?”</em></p>
<p><em>Instantly, Jang Beom-hee hesitated, and Kwon Chae-woo’s face contorted with anger. He shoved him forcefully, interpreting the brief silence in his own way. It sent shivers down his spine, but he gritted his teeth and took a hesitant step.</em></p>
<p><em>“Am I wrong?”</em></p>
<p><em>“What, young master?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Damn it, she didn’t run away, leaving me behind, did she?”</em></p>
<p><em>“…”</em></p>
<p><em>“What day is it today? How long did I sleep for…?”</em></p>
<p><em>Kwon Chae-woo grabbed his forehead, breathing heavily, and the startled Jang Beom-hee quickly turned on the tablet he was holding and thrust it to him.</em></p>
<p><em>“Master, So Lee-yeon is unharmed. Please calm down now!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Do I look I can calm down now…!”</em></p>
<p><em>The wildly shaking pupils gradually settled as if they were fixed on the screen. He stared at the picture with a sense of urgency as if he had to breathe.</em></p>
<p><em>“Currently, Ms. So Lee-yeon is attending the Hyedom commemorative event.”</em></p>
<p><em>‘When was the last time she had smiled so brightly?’</em></p>
<p><em>Shown in the screen of the tablet, So Lee-yeon was walking arm in arm with Kwon Kiseok, consistently wearing a smile. She, in her pure white dress, smiled shyly, but she seemed like a completely different person from the one he knew.</em></p>
<p><em>This fact stabbed deep into his guts more painfully than a broken rib. If a single fact could hurt more than his broken rib.</em></p>
<p><em>“Who on earth dressed her in a white dress?”</em></p>
<p><em>***</em></p>
<p><em>“Who on earth dressed her in a white dress?”</em></p>
<p><em>Kwon Chae-woo tossed his tablet into Jang Beom-hee’s chest and flashed a meaningful look.</em></p>
<p><em>“Do you know what kinds of thoughts I’ve been having lately?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I sometimes think about trying something I’ve hated so much that I wanted to die. I don’t have much time left.”</em></p>
<p><em>Jang Beom-hee waited for an explanation since he couldn’t understand the words. However, Kwon Chae-woo merely swallowed his words, moving his throat as if he were choking on them.</em></p>
<p><em>How fierce the conflict would become between the Kwon family and the opposing forces in the future remained uncertain, and even if they could ensure So Lee-yeon’s safety, was there any chance for her to return?</em></p>
<p><em>It was impossible to estimate how long it would take for the Kwon family to disband.</em></p>
<p><em>If he couldn’t be with her when their child was born and growing up, if she had to face all the hardships on her own, if he forced all that upon her, he clenched his fist, which was no longer as strong as it used to be, stubbornly.</em></p>
<p><em>“Lead the way.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Master, you can’t move properly right now!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Even if my legs were severed, I would’ve crawled my way out of here.”</em></p>
<p><em>With relentless determination in his words, Jang Beom-hee had no choice but to support Kwon Chae-woo, who was resolute on advancing.</em></p>
