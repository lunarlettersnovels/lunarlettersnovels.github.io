            <p><strong>Chapter 86</strong></p>
<p>“I said let’s do well together!”</p>
<p>Treating as many trees as possible within the time limit was the task. Lee-yeon, after coming into the closed town for the second test, glared at Kwon Chae-woo with her lips all swollen.</p>
<p>The messiness of the town reflected how she felt. It was almost summer.  Lee-yeon wore a jumpsuit and stomped away.</p>
<p>“Who forgot to tell me in 24 hours, Lee-yeon?”</p>
<p>“I said it’ll only be overnight!”</p>
<p>“Outdoor camping in the middle of the mountain. Sleeping on a plank at the bottom part of the mountain slide—” The judge could be heard from afar.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo composed himself while he listened to the judge. It seemed like he prefers beating the crap out of thugs than the prospect of Lee-yeon sleeping outdoors for a night.</p>
<p>She was annoyed at the man looking after her like a mother hen, but she also wanted to laugh. She didn’t know how to react. She wasn’t familiar with receiving such attention.</p>
<p>The opponent was Me Tree Hospital.</p>
<p>She didn’t like that she had to leave Choo-ja behind, but she had no regrets. Since the drug farm incident, she didn’t leave Kwon Chae-woo on the hospital bed. Lee-yeon had prepped him for this day. So, he won’t have much trouble assisting her.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stopped in her tracks. A familiar face in the Me Tree Hospital team made her bite the insides of her lips.</p>
<p><em>Director Jo Kyung-cheon…</em></p>
<p>He was her former boss.</p>
<p>What was more troubling was his name was on the thug’s phone, who was maintaining the drug farm. But the investigation became a farce and the only answer she received whenever she visited the D hospital was that the director wasn’t there.</p>
<p>She had almost given up…</p>
<p>He approached her with a smile. “Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>The first person to react to his voice was Kwon Chae-woo. He wrapped his arm around her waist, protectively, and glared at the man. Jo Kyung-cheon looked away from him after a while.</p>
<p>“I heard you’ve been looking for me?”</p>
<p>“What are you doing in Hwaido?” Lee-yeon lowered her voice and glared at him coldly. “It better not be what I think it is.”</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, I was the first to bring you here.”</p>
<p>She frowned at the random chatter. She knew what Jo Kyung-cheon was talking about. He probably meant the time she came to Hwaido for a business trip not long after she got hired at his tree hospital.</p>
<p>Jo Kyung-cheon stared impassively at Lee-yeon, who kept her mouth shut. He just remembered the conversation he had with Executive Kwon.</p>
<p><em>“How is the plan coming along?”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s going smoothly.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You should make sure no one finds out about that rare plant.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I’ll keep that in mind.”</em></p>
<p><em>If she didn’t find that plant, everything would have been better…</em> Jo Kyung-cheon’s face darkened. Seven years ago, something rare was discovered in a swamp at Hwaido. During the training, Lee-yeon had taken a wrong turn into the swamp and Jo Kyung-cheon had benefited from it.</p>
<p>It was a type of plant that wasn’t even known to the world yet. It had no name. But a rumor of a rare plant started originating. There was an incident where it was uprooted from its roots, and it suddenly disappeared. It was the Kwon family’s doing.</p>
<p>And a few years later, the researchers who studied the plant disappeared. He had used Hwang Jo-yoon’s behavior as an excuse to kick So Lee-yeon out of the hospital. He had no idea that she would settle in Hwaido.</p>
<p>Jo Kyung-cheon took a step forward towards her with mixed feelings. “Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>“Stop there.” Kwon Chae-woo stopped him.</p>
<p>As the two men glared at each other, Lee-yeon bit her tongue in anticipation.</p>
<p>“This is my husband,” said Lee-yeon as a way of introduction.</p>
<p>“What?!” Jo Kyung-cheon was surprised. Director Jo felt that there were many flaws in Lee-yeon from the time she worked in his hospital, so he was shocked to hear that she was now wed.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, can’t you stop here?” Jo Kyung-cheon boldly asked her.</p>
<p>“Stop what?”</p>
<p>“Hwaidome.”</p>
<p>“Are you asking me to forfeit? Why should I?”</p>
<p>Jo Kyung-cheon realized that she didn’t know anything. As he walked past her, he whispered, “You keep your mouth shut if you don’t want to die.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Only Lee-yeon could hear him. But there was no way Kwon Chae-woo wouldn’t have noticed with those sensitive ears of his.</p>
<p>He was about to lunge at the director when Lee-yeon hurriedly tugged at his sleeve. She shook her head and Kwon Chae-woo frowned, but he calmed down.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stared blankly at the spot where Jo Kyung-cheon had been standing. She couldn’t tell if that was a threat or a warning.</p>
