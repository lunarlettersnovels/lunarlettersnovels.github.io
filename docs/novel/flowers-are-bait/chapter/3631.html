            <p><strong>Chapter 151</strong></p>
<p>Beautiful Hwaido Island.</p>
<p>As they stepped into the tranquil forest, refreshing air filled their nostrils. Lee-yeon looked up at the large banner and tightly held little Gyu-baek’s hand.</p>
<p>The child clutched an insect encyclopedia to their chest, their cheeks turning red. “The blue-banded swallowtail butterfly has large, slender wings. Especially, butterflies fly in a line by biting each other’s tails.”</p>
<p>Today, Gyubaek’s voice sounded like singing. This was part of the ecological restoration project for “Beautiful Hwaido Island.”</p>
<p>The project was started by Hwaido Island, the Korea Forest Service, and the Insect Research Association, with the aim of mass breeding endangered butterfly species. Recently, they succeeded in breeding over 2,000 blue-banded swallowtail butterflies, leading to the opening of the “Butterfly Flight” festival.</p>
<p>“Director, could you introduce us, please?”</p>
<p>Gyu-baek kept tugging on Yeon’s hand, making the request for what seemed like the hundredth time.</p>
<p>“Okay, I understand.”</p>
<p>“I prefer Jamanchu.”</p>
<p>“What’s Jamanchu?”</p>
<p>“It’s a pursuit of natural encounters.”</p>
<p>*자만추 – Ja-man-chu: reference to meet a romantic partner <em>naturally</em>. Here, naturally would mean without the intention of meeting a significant other.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was momentarily bewildered, then furrowed her brow.</p>
<p>“Where did you learn that kind of talk?”</p>
<p>“It’s basic.”</p>
<p>The Insect Research Association was a place that Gyu-baek had always admired, and he had devoted his entire eight-year-old life to collecting the magazines published there every month. Especially upon hearing the news that the first and second leaders of the butterfly division, as well as the director in charge of the beetle division, would be attending, he couldn’t resist striking poses in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>His determined gaze suggested that he was ready to face any challenge.</p>
<p>“Butterflies can recognize females even from a distance of over 100km.”</p>
<p>As people came to watch the festival, each holding hands with their families or loved ones, Yeon couldn’t help but think of someone in particular upon seeing those smiling behind their masks.</p>
<p>Last night, she fell asleep, closing her eyes, refusing to acknowledge the sticky liquid on her hands.</p>
<p>When she woke up, her hands were clean, and Kwon Chae-woo was making breakfast in the middle of his usual daily life.</p>
<p>Lately, the two had been making do with hastily patching and mending their torn clothes, but how long could that go on for?</p>
<p>When her face darkened inward, Gyu-baek began to jump. As she turned my head along with the growing hum, dozens of large cages that looked about 5m came in one after another.</p>
<p>Amidst the dense foliage of the forest stood a cream-colored antique cage, its bars intricately woven and interlocked like a masterpiece of a bygone era. It seemed to command attention, almost as if it were a stage set for a wondrous display of magic.</p>
<p>The host and the heads of related associations beamed with pride as they delivered their congratulatory remarks, their voices ringing out in the tranquil forest. The anticipation in the air was palpable, and as the last word of praise was uttered, the ornate door of the cage creaked open, releasing a sense of wonder and curiosity into the stillness of the woods.</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>Gyu-baek and the gathered crowd couldn’t help but gasp in awe as they witnessed a breathtaking spectacle before their very eyes.</p>
<p>Thousands of delicate petals danced in the air, carried aloft by a gentle breeze. A kaleidoscope of butterflies flitted about, their wings beating in perfect unison, creating a mesmerizing sight as they swooped and soared like a swirling whirlwind.</p>
<p>As the butterflies drew near, their wings brushing past the amazed onlookers, Lee Yeon found herself lost in the enchanting display. She stared, transfixed, as the sparkling wings of the Pyeonlin shimmered like a precious secret, one that she had kept hidden for so long.</p>
<p>The delicate wings, each one reflecting the light, were like a broken mirror, revealing the moments when she had to deceive even herself.</p>
<p><em>“Have you ever sucked a dick, Lee-yeon?”</em></p>
<p><em>“What if I killed Kwon Ki-seok?”</em></p>
<p><em>“You always have to be careful when you say something.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Damn it, you should do things in moderation.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You are tearing up. It’s a shame to watch it alone. When did you become so sincere?”</em></p>
<p><em>“…Should I beg you, Lee-yeon?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Now come and don’t look weak. You have to keep being shameless.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Prey, by nature, can’t survive once they’re caught.”</em></p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s remarks kept ringing in her ears…</p>
<p>The man’s eyes, tone, and behavior, which had occasionally felt ruthless and hostile, couldn’t be ignored any longer.</p>
<p>Even when he felt unfamiliar, Lee-yeon tried to dismiss her anxious feelings. She thought it was nothing, just a process of him sorting out his words and burying his memories.</p>
<p>If Kwon Chae-woo continued to pretend to be her husband, she would have been willing to go along with it. “Let’s try it. If the biggest obstacle to us being together is our past memories, then I don’t need them. Even if Lee-yeon didn’t ask me first, I would have thrown them away,” He said that…</p>
<p>Because of this, she had made a promise to herself that if he won’t remember, she would bury his past like this. Perhaps the determination that Lee-yeon engraved alone contained a stronger binding force than a fake marriage certificate.</p>
<p>But somehow, she could feel that he go</p>
<p>But somehow, she could feel that he got his memories back… The change in him was apparent.</p>
<p>But he pretended otherwise…</p>
<p>So, if Kwon Chae-woo continued to pretend to be her husband, she could willingly be deceived.</p>
<p>But she was still unsure.</p>
<p>She believed that his confusion would subside once this transitional period passed.</p>
<p>“I can wait,” she said.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon briefly closed her eyes, much like a butterfly that was basking in the sunlight. She wanted to protect this relationship, even if it meant turning a blind eye to reality. She was willing to endure the discomfort that crept up on her from time to time, and she was determined to hold onto Kwon Chae-woo alone.</p>
<p>Having reached the point of deceiving herself, not just lying to others, her self-delusion was sweet. She believed the relationship was safe as long as she suppressed her desire to ask questions and voice suspicions.</p>
<p>She couldn’t afford to let go of the person she had barely managed to connect with, even if it meant keeping her guard up and biting her tongue.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a swarm of butterflies scattered in the wind and flapped around her. In defense, she instinctively lifted her elbow to protect her forehead. And when she lowered her arm, an all-too-familiar man came into view, as if the butterflies had brought him to her.</p>
<p>With her legs stiffened, Lee-yeon stared at Kwon Chae-woo, as if in a dream.</p>
