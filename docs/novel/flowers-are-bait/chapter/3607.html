            <p><strong>Chapter 176</strong></p>
<p>“Ughhh…!”</p>
<p>In the basement with not a single ray of light.</p>
<p>A person tied up to a rusted chair was moaning. His hands and feet were tied up and his head was covered in black cloth. He kept on turning his head as he felt the unusual atmosphere of the basement.</p>
<p>“I, I’m sorry. S, spare me…!”</p>
<p>“Is it him?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo asked, while sitting on an old sofa and playing with a lighter. His face could be seen as the light kept turning on and off. His expressionless face was like a cold statue.</p>
<p>“Yes, he is the one who dated VIP’s daughter for a short while during her study abroad.”</p>
<p>One of the hunting dog answered.</p>
<p>“They supported him with around $700,000 but he changed his mind and broke up. But not even a month left to her wedding, he kept sending her videos and blackmailing her. His request for $3 million and a part of the video was sent to her. The VIP asked to take care of this quietly.</p>
<p>The man shook his head in fear.</p>
<p>“… P, please let me go. It was a mistake, and there was no—“</p>
<p>“You don’t blackmail on by accident, only an animal does that.”</p>
<p>As Kwon Chae-woo stood up, dusts flew up. As each time he walked around, the sound of glass shattered. The only thing that was shining under his black hair was his chestnut eyes.</p>
<p>“I hear you take good videos.”</p>
<p>“I, I won’t do it again!”</p>
<p>“It’s not just her.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“The videos that you had in your bag.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>His shoulders flinched.</p>
<p>“You have so many people on your leash, yet you beg just at such little thing?”</p>
<p>“Ut…!”</p>
<p>The man seemed to have sensed what was going to happen to him as he clenched his fist.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo picked up an axe. The hunting dogs that were standing around exchanged a curious glance as he didn’t look for a string for some reason.</p>
<p>The man shouted then.</p>
<p>“D, do you know what it feels to be not able to get what you want?!”</p>
<p>The black cloth stuck to his face as he was panting hard.</p>
<p>“Have you even loved!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo felt the wood touching his palm. There was a weird emotion on his face for a moment. He kept on fixing the grip on his hand then in the end took the blade off.</p>
<p>“It was my choice to the loving memory that I want to keep, so who are you to–!”</p>
<p>“You disgust me.”</p>
<p>“Y, you motherfuckers, if you’re so confident, take the cloth off my head first! Don’t hide—“</p>
<p>Then, the cloth was taken off his head.</p>
<p>“How did you know we are motherfuckers?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo curved his lips. Just because the lips were curved didn’t mean he was smiling.</p>
<p>His cold eyes made the man instantly forget about everything around him.</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare lie in front of me.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo lowered his body and met his eyes. The man gulped.</p>
<p>“That was business to you, not love.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Did you want to grab her by her hair and wanted to do things at your will?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo started breaking the man’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>Even though the man was screaming in pain, it didn’t bring him joy like before. It wasn’t like before.</p>
<p>It was the same lethargy he felt when heard that Yoon Joo-ha has died, and music was gone in his life.</p>
<p>But he still beat down on the man’s shoulder. Still, nothing. He was getting bored of what it felt like beating down on dead meat.</p>
<p>“… S, stop. I’m sorry. Ahhh…! S, sir, s, spare me…! I, I feel wronged! I really love them and it was painful not to be able to see them… Ugh!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo grabbed the man’s head and made him look into his eyes.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll let you see them.”</p>
<p>“… What do you—“</p>
<p>He started striking the man’s face with the wooden handle. Blood was spurting but his face was so calm. Only his messy hair covered his eyes.</p>
<p>“Be crippled just once. You’ll start hallucinating all kind of things.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo glanced at the table. The woman who was curled up sleeping was grabbing his attention.</p>
<p>The moment he saw her face, his grip loosened. The hunting dogs also turned their head but there was nothing that they saw. It was just an old table.</p>
<p>“… You didn’t protect the woman you love but instead—“</p>
<p>His voice sounded empty.</p>
<p>“If you made them bow in shame—“</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo kicked the man. As the man struggled, he took a knife out of his pocket and cut the man’s Achilles, cruciate ligaments, wrist, everything. It was quick and on point.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhh!”</p>
<p>“See what you lost for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p><em>You’re probably still saving tree. But I still kill people. </em>He felt nauseated. He looked at his bloody knife and threw it on the ground.</p>
<p>“Take a picture and send it to the VIP and take care of the rest.”</p>
<p>“Yes, young master.”</p>
