<p><strong>Chapter 148</strong></p>
<p>“Like I said before, don’t take it unless necessary.”</p>
<p>The doctor gave him a bottle of medicine hesitantly but wouldn’t let go easily.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo snatched the bottle regardless of the doctor’s warning.</p>
<p>He used going to the store as an excuse so he had to go back in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Just sleep instead!”</p>
<p>The doctor shouted behind him.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t take it so leisu—“</p>
<p>The world became so quiet as he slammed the door. He stopped frowning as well.</p>
<p>As he walked down the hallway of a hospital, the phone vibrated. Kwon Chae-woo took the call.</p>
<p>–Kwon Ki-Seok, no movement from him.</p>
<p>“What about So Lee-yeon?”</p>
<p>–She’s tending the garden.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo kicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“She’s like a puppy.”</p>
<p>–Young master.</p>
<p>That moment, Jang Beom-hee called him worryingly. Kwon Chae-woo frowned like he knew what was coming.</p>
<p>–How about we go back up instead of taking the medicine? I’ll get it prepared immediately.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo didn’t use his face at all like he wasn’t on the phone.</p>
<p>–No matter how I think, I think staying in Hwaido is waste of time. Just don’t think about So Lee-yeon and sleep comfortably. I’ll take you to your home.</p>
<p>As he regained more of his memories, the fantasy of So Lee-yeon being able to cure his hypersomnia began to fade. The emotional bond he once felt towards her was weakening with each passing day, and eventually, the chain was broken completely.</p>
<p>It was his absolute instinct and Kwon Chae-woo hasn’t slept in a few days so that he wouldn’t be caught.</p>
<p>–Wasn’t your goal Kwon Ki-seok to begin with?</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>His family was trying to transform the youngest son who came back in 10 years as a fitting member of the family.</p>
<p>The family that was maintaining its relationship through bad tradition emphasized on solidarity but to the boy who lived as Yoon Joo-ha’s son, it meant nothing.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo kept denying the connection by blood and chose to be in solitude.</p>
<p>When the man who stopped playing chess became the hunting dog, he dug about Yoon Joo-ha, his mother, like he had been waiting for this opportunity.</p>
<p>And he found out that the reason why his parents locked up Yoon Joo-ha in the basement wasn’t just because of anger.</p>
<p>Yoon Joo-ha was the sole survival from the illegal human experience that was ran by Sooguk pharmaceutical.</p>
<p>When she was about 10 years old, she was able to barely escape thanks to a kind lab partner, and she was able to find a sponsor that helped her fulfill her musical talent.</p>
<p>She pushed aside the memories of her torment and grew into a beautiful young woman. Yet as she began to teach the talented Kwon Ki-Seok the art of music, her past slowly crept back into her consciousness.</p>
<p>When she found out that the Kwon family was actual owner of Sooguk pharmaceutical, the 21-year-old Yoon Joo-ha was swallowed by her nightmare from the past.</p>
<p>People screaming in pain, her little brother who was starving to death, the basement facility full of molds. All of this overcame her each time she walked past Kwon family’s fancy garden and saw Kwon Ki-Seok in fancy private school uniform.</p>
<p>Yoon Joo-ha had a gentle heart, but she made a desperate choice to hide the Kwon’s three-year-old son in a cello bag and flee just a year after becoming Kwon Ki-seok’s music teacher.</p>
<p>Her plan for revenge was flawed from the start.</p>
<p>Instead of causing harm to the child, she raised him with love.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo felt a sense of obligation to fulfill the unfinished mission of the woman who raised him.</p>
<p>“Would I really be the only one in Korea that detest Kwon family?”</p>
<p>Was there really not a single person who didn’t protest about their method of total obedience?</p>
<p>The main duty of these people was basically being a hunting dog, so once Kwon Chae-woo overtook this group, it was more often that he would secretly take them board.</p>
<p>Something Kwon Chae-woo has been planning a long time.</p>
<p>That was the dissolution of the Kwon family.</p>
<p>–Yes, so do we really have to ruin your body just to fool So Lee-yeon?”</p>
<p>“Just to fool her.”</p>
<p>He chewed on Jang Beom-hee’s words without emotion.</p>
<p>“Honestly, it really isn’t important. But,” Kwon Chae-woo slowed down and eventually stopped. “Nowadays, she feigns a smile, yet her eyes tell a different story.”</p>
<p>–… Pardon?</p>
<p>“You know the process, Beom-hee.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo took in the smell of the alcohol for sanitary purposes.</p>
<p>“How the animals react when they realized they’re about to be slaughtered.”</p>
<p>“Meat gets tougher the more they struggle.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo said, his eyes flickering as he gazed out the window. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, trying to compose himself.</p>
<p>“I didn’t wait until now to eat something that’s not good.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. His voice was calm.</p>
