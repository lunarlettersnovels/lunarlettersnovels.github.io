            <p><strong>Chapter 97</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon yelped in surprise at the suddenness of the action. There was no pain this time, though, just pure bliss as Kwon Chae-woo started to thrust into her. He pulled her into a deep kiss to soften her moans and Lee-yeon felt like she was losing her mind every time he plunged into her.</p>
<p>The only thing she could think of was how hard and aggressive he was being and just how sensitive she was becoming with his every touch.</p>
<p>The first night they had spent together, she had wondered how she was able to take all of him. She felt so connected to him when they engaged in such primal activities.</p>
<p>“What are you staring at?” Kwon Chae-woo asked her. His voice was soft, clouded by her dazed state.</p>
<p>When Lee-yeon saw him staring at her with dark and greedy eyes, she could feel herself get more wet. He looked at her like she was an altar, and he was intent on worshiping her.</p>
<p>“What are you staring at?” he asked again. She could hear it now that he was teasing her. “Are you staring at my dick?”</p>
<p>“What?” Lee-yeon asked, startled. She was all the more embarrassed by her actions when Kwon Chae-woo noticed the way her body was reacting to everything they did.</p>
<p>He simply laughed, like he read her mind. “You know,” he said. “I would be happy living in a basement, I would need sun or water or anything, as long as I can have you. If I have you, everything else doesn’t matter. I’m the easiest thing to take care of.” He licked his finger and pressed it against her clit to rub it. “But I’ll die if the water from down here dries.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon groaned at his words, her insides growing tighter around him.</p>
<p>“So good, Lee-yeon,” Kwon Chae-woo moaned. “So good.”</p>
<p>He continued to snap his hips against her. There was so much pleasure in the movement that Lee-yeon felt like she was losing her mind. She tried to stay conscious, but she could feel herself starting to slip. She didn’t even know how much time had passed already. She looked out the window to try and see if she could tell, but it was no use.</p>
<p>She moaned again, except this time it wasn’t a moan of pleasure. She felt like she was going to die of fatigue.</p>
<p>“Get a job.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo looked at her with hard eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Lee-yeon told him. “You can leave the house.”</p>
<p>“Why do you sound so tired all of a sudden?” he asked.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon looked down at her heat and groaned. She felt like she was actually going to die.</p>
<p>“Even though the mountain was dangerous, you still did so well,” she told him with her last bits of strength. “I think I was just worried about you.” Her breasts pushed against his chest as she started breathing harder. She flinched when she felt his dick become harder inside her, but she didn’t have the strength to say a thing.</p>
<p>Seemingly losing his patience, Kwon Chae-woo started pounding into her harder. His moans were loud, and his movements were strong.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon felt herself consumed by a burning white heat as an orgasm washed over her again. She clenched around Kwon Chae-woo who glared at her as he reached his climax at the sudden pressure. He pulled out and came on a towel.</p>
<p>Roughly, Kwon Chae-woo pushed his finger into her and swirled it around as if he were taking his cum out of her. Their bodies had only been separated for a moment when he grabbed her ankles again.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon felt like passing out. “Get a job,” she said again, but faintly this time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was dawn and the air around her was cold. Lee-yeon woke up with a frown as she felt that her mouth was dry. She felt thirsty so she tried to look around for some water.</p>
<p>Light came through the thin curtains of the hospital room. She felt nauseous just looking at the light.</p>
<p>“Are you up?” she heard Kwon Chae-woo ask behind her.</p>
<p>When she heard the quiet voice, she felt emotions surge through her body. She felt the sadness that came with running through the light of dawn and the relief that came with planting her roots around someone.</p>
<p>“Don’t be scared,” she could almost hear. She felt like crying as she remembered Choo-ja’s voice.</p>
<p>When she turned around to see Kwon Chae-woo, a tongue pushed into her mouth. Her dry lips were wet once more. She tried to push herself away from him, but he just grabbed her so that she could feel his hard dick against her.</p>
<p>She froze at the feeling, but Kwon Chae-woo calmed her down. “It’s okay,” he whispered. Then, he surprised her by shoving his cock back inside her. She cried out in shock.</p>
<p>“How are you so pretty?” Kwon Chae-woo asked as he thrust into her.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Lee-yeon cried out. “Stop!”</p>
<p>But he was relentless and he pounded into her tirelessly. He moved fervently and quickly, moving against her like a dog. The sound of skin slapping echoed through the dawn.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon,” he moaned. His pace slowed but he went deeper. “It’s so good, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>As he hit her spot, Lee-yeon had no choice but to moan. She felt him grab her breasts from the back and start playing with her nipples. His hips kept moving as he toyed with her and sucked on her earlobes.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time they had done it, but Kwon Chae-woo was being more aggressive than he usually was.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was about to scream when he stuffed his fingers into her mouth. Hazily, she started to suck on them and his movements only became rougher.</p>
<p>When she bit on his fingers, he laughed. “Good morning, Lee-yeon.”</p>
