            <p><strong>Chapter 52</strong></p>
<p>“How much more do I have to endure this?”</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” she mumbled. Lee-yeon could have defended herself but at this time, she though he was right. She had used him when she needed him.</p>
<p>“Are you playing with me because I’m a handicap?”</p>
<p>She had lied to him. She had fed him stories just because he had no memory of his past life. “I am sorry. I think I did a little because I was confused.”</p>
<p>She had to tread carefully. A little bit of truth and honesty so that he can accept her explanation. He had no memory of his own so she had the upper hand. Maybe she could try and diffuse the situation. At least that was how she had rationalized so far.</p>
<p>But—</p>
<p>“Who’s really the one being swayed from the deep down.”</p>
<p>He bumped his forehead to hers. Their nose met and their hair got mixed. Lee-yeon opened her eyes wide at the sudden bump and forgot about everything she was about to say. Strangely she couldn’t say a word. She had a few excuses that came into her mind but she couldn’t utter a word.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. But I….”</p>
<p>I don’t believe in emotion. That was the closest thing to how she felt. But that was something she should have been hiding because she was still pretending to be his wife.</p>
<p>“I still worry about you….”</p>
<p>“Ok.” His voice was cold. “Then I will just be a crazy person for you.”</p>
<p>He pulled off her top suddenly and caressed her lower back. She felt goosebumps on her skin because of the cold. “A crazy person with sickness of his d*ck erecting uncontrollably. I can do that, if you need an excuse.” He looked at her. “So, humor me.”</p>
<p>He pulled her brassier off and fondled her br*asts. Her smooth skin was squished in his thick, rough palms.</p>
<p>“Kwon, Chae-woo, wait….!”</p>
<p>He lowered his lips and took her br*ast in his mouth. “Kwon Chae-woo…”</p>
<p>His tongue brushed her tip and sent her quivering. His hands fumbled lower and took her panties off. The cold air that touched her naked bottom felt dirty. Lee-yeon tried to push him away weakly, but his mouth playing with her chest rendered her unable to think. His teeth grazed on the tip and he gently bit her. He looked at her as he did it. She moaned.</p>
<p>The inside of her thighs felt hot and burned. She wasn’t used to something like this. She didn’t like this. This was all so sudden. She instinctively grabbed his writs and he let go.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, you love me,” he said. “So, how can you doubt your husband?” he smiled and lowered his head towards her thighs. Lee-yeon clenched her legs together but he simply grabbed her thighs and pried them open. The hands that grabbed her bottom was rough and firm. Kwon Chae-woo buried his lips between her legs without hesitation.</p>
<p>She felt his hot breath on her skin before the tip of his nose touched her skin. Her privates were sensitive and swollen. He sucked and nibbled on her cl*t and played with it with his tongue. Lee-yeon gasped and shuddered.</p>
<p>He licked her and rubbed her down there, occasionally sucking her enlarged lump to evoke pleasure. Her toes curled and she grabbed his hair. She buckled without intending too. As his mouth played with her, she felt like she would lose her mind.</p>
<p>His thump pried her lower lips open and his lips and tongue became even more tenacious. When he bit on her sensitive part gently, the heat built up so much that she arched her back not able to take it anymore.</p>
<p>Her vision blurred and pin pricks of light blinded her sight. She let out a long moan. He didn’t stop there. He drank all her fluid.</p>
<p>When she thought that she was gaining her sanity back, Kwon Chae-woo pulled her bottom to him and imitated with his tongue what he wanted to do to her. He sucked her skin even more. Her mind went blank. Her body felt weak.</p>
<p>Thump, thump, thump.</p>
<p>Her hazy mind instantly became clear when she heard the footsteps. “Someone’s coming!” she exclaimed as she pushed his head away. She could hear them on the stairs now leading to the second-floor window. “Kwon Chae-woo!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s heart pounded. She was terrified that someone might see them like this, naked. But he wouldn’t stop. He just laughed. “Kwon Chae-woo! Someone’s coming! It must be the doctor!”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“What?!” She half-listed herself on her hands and glared at him. “You crazy bastard! Let me go! What will they think if they saw us like this? What about my reputation?”</p>
<p>“Then I think the bastard who is coming here should know what happens when they sneak into a newlywed’s room. And don’t worry about your reputation, I am your husband, not a stranger.”</p>
<p>His lips were slippery from a clear liquid. Lee-yeon knew what it was. She looked away.</p>
