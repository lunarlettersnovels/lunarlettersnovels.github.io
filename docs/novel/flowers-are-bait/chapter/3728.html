            <p><strong>Chapter 51</strong></p>
<p>“Wait….!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon pushed him away but kwon Chae-woo wouldn’t budge. He looked her in the eye and found her lips again. His nose pressed down on her cheek. His hot palm rubbed against her panties. She wasn’t pushing him away anymore. She felt something for the first time in her life.</p>
<p>He rubbed her cl*t slowly. She bit her lips to withheld her moans. His strong forearm held her to him. Kwon Chae-woo was breathless too. She gasped for breath. Every time he kissed her and rubbed her, moans tore out of her.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, seeing her aroused, grabbed the back of her head and deepened his kiss. He kissed her frantically and passionately. He kept rubbing her there, over her panties. Her heart raced and the heat she felt boiled within her.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo swore. He pulled at her panties, partly taking them off. She felt the rush of water splashing against her privates. Lee-yeon took ragged breaths to calm herself.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo,” she mumbled. “You are sick right now.’</p>
<p>His hands stopped. Lee-yeon panted and tried to calm her breathing. His eyes acknowledged her. “Yes, I am. My d*ick is.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon bit her lips. Kwon Chae-woo continued fondling her and making it harder for her to explain. She pushed him as hard as she could. “Kwon Chae-woo,” she said, “Just listen. The doctor told me that there are many symptoms accompanying your syndrome. It includes aggressiveness, impulsiveness, hypersexuality. These symptoms fit you. This is what you are doing right now!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo stared at her. His eyes looked so innocent. “Just calm yourself,” she said. “This might just be part of your symptoms. This compulsion and your horniness. It could be your disease. So, just stop for a moment.”</p>
<p>He scoffed. He tucked a stray hair behind her ears. His hand was gentle but his eyes were dark. “That is just nonsense,” he said. “You just want to believe that.” He got off her and leaned against the wall. “The doctors might not be right all the time. But you were so easily persuaded. Do you think I don’t know what my own body wants?”</p>
<p>He washed his face and ran his fingers through his hair to get them out of his eyes. “Maybe you’re right,” he said. “let’s say my brain is screwed up and I become hard whenever I see you.”</p>
<p>The crusted blood fell in rivulets down his face. “Since, I am not well, does that mean I can act as sick as I want?”</p>
<p>She was then lifted up and placed harshly on the bed. Lee-yeon was reminded of their second meeting when he had woken up from his vegetative state and then attacked her.</p>
<p>“K-Kwon Chae-woo…,” she tried to protest. He crawled on top of her.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Please. This is…”</p>
<p>“It’s because of my illness, or whatever you want to believe,” he said with smirk and pulled her by the collar, leaning close. His lips aggressively found hers. Lee-yeon froze, in spite of herself. Her eyes were teary.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo suddenly stopped. He looked at her teary eyes and went quiet. He frowned. He then sighed a sad sigh as though this caused him so much pain.</p>
<p><em>Why is he acting like this? I am the one who is scared! </em>“Don’t do this,” she pleaded. “Don’t take out your anger in this manner. You aren’t like this.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon didn’t know him beyond the fact that he had been a murderer. But the new person he had become hadn’t been like this. He was never aggressive or violent. He had respected her wishes and her opinion. He had cared for her.</p>
<p>“Then how much more do I have to endure you?” he looked at her. His eyes looked tired. “Do you know how many times I have to hold myself back from grabbing you and taking you right there?” He gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon shrank at the sound of his voice. “You tried to leave me in the mountain,” he said. “You almost shoved me towards another woman. You ignore my emotions and always make this syndrome an excuse.”</p>
<p>“You tell me, was that right of you?” he asked.</p>
<p>His eyes really looked bloodshot. He looked very tired. Too many things had happened. He had to deal with Hwang Jo-yoon after waking up from his sleep, he had climbed a tree which he had never done before. He had even gone to that social and then to the hospital for a check-up. On top of all that, he had beaten down a boar. He must really be exhausted.</p>
<p>But Lee-yeon treating him just as a patient ruined him. Kwon Chae-woo was shaken just by her breathing. Lee-yeon thought that maybe he was mentally exhausted because he had hurt his head.</p>
<p>“Perhaps, you are just playing with me because I’m a handicap?” he suggested.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon lowered her eyes guiltily. It wasn’t completely untrue.</p>
