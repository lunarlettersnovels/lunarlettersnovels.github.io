        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 254</strong></p>
<p>At that moment, the creaking door opened, and a low voice sounded. Late to receive the news, Choo-ja rushed in with a disheveled expression. She rolled her eyes back, observing the two people sticking together.</p>
<p>She quickly grasped the situation, had a surprised expression. Their relationship had undergone a drastic change in just a month.</p>
<p>“…No way, it must not be, not in my eyes!”</p>
<p>Choo-ja stepped in briskly and shouted for the hospital room to clear.</p>
<p>“That damn good-looking bastard thinks he can get away with anything!”</p>
<p>“… Choo-ja?”</p>
<p>“Even if every other man in the world turns out like this, what a world will we live in!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon blinked her eyes at Choo-ja’s voice that erupted like a volcano. Kwon Chae-woo, unexpectedly facing opposition, frowned but then meekly lowered the corners of his mouth. His change in attitude was remarkably swift and discreet.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo, no, Mr. Kwon Chae-woo, do you know how Lee-yeon endured while you were away?”</p>
<p>Choo-ja struck his chest as if a fire had erupted.</p>
<p>“Not eating, not sleeping… Her eyes were lifeless like frozen pollack…!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Choo-ja’s eyes turned red.</p>
<p>“My insides, even Ma’s insides, weren’t as tough as yours. You shamelessly had the audacity to show your face to Lee-yeon, who almost died that day. If you had seen her gasping for breath even once, you would have wanted to stick your head in the toilet!”</p>
<p>Choo-ja began to indiscriminately hit Kwon Chae-woo’s shoulders and arms with the hand that was lecturing.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was startled and tried to intervene, but Kwon Chae-woo firmly held her hand, silently signaling her to stay still.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Choo-ja was hitting the area where he had been shot, and it would be quite painful. However, he maintained a stoic expression, lowering his eyelashes without a change.</p>
<p>“What kind of person is he? How pitiful and bold! Why should I accept someone who hurt my child? The one who forced her to arrange a funeral instead of a wedding…! I will never allow it!”</p>
<p>Choo-ja grabbed Kwon Chae-woo and began to shake him.</p>
<p>“This marriage certificate!…! It’s useless…! How dare he! There is no way I am allowing this!”</p>
<p>Even with a stretched-out T-shirt collar covering his eyes and his bangs obscuring his forehead, he did not show any emotion. Choo-ja continued to shake Kwon Chae-woo, leading him silently.</p>
<p>A man who hadn’t eaten properly, couldn’t sleep, and suffered a major injury soon turned pale. Choo-ja momentarily stopped, but then raised her voice even louder, glaring at Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“Do you remember what you said? It’s barely been a season since then.”</p>
<p>“Well, Ms. Choo-ja, um…”</p>
<p>“Did you say that it’s over as soon as this man left? Did you say that this man isn’t the man you loved?”</p>
<p>While understanding Choo-ja’s feelings, Lee-yeon couldn’t help but feel uneasy about Kwon Chae-woo. It was definitely not the right time to bring up <em>another man</em> in this situation.</p>
<p>“But crazy things like rushing to declare marriage? Just date and live freely, just date!  Just live by dating, without bothering about legal ties! These guys who haven’t even put a ring on it think they can tie the knot with a fancy piece of paper…! I won’t allow it!”</p>
<p>When Choo-ja pointed her finger at Lee-yeon this time, Kwon Chae-woo unexpectedly stepped in to stop her.</p>
<p>“Mother-in-law, I made a mistake.”</p>
<p>“Who is your mother-in-law?!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo massaged his chin and narrowed his eyes. At the same time, he spoke with a remorseful tone, causing Choo-ja to falter slightly. Oh, it’s really absurd. What a nerve from a bastard who belongs to another house. But he quickly regained his composure and firmed up his wavering emotions.</p>
<p>“I’ll send mother-in-law to marriage first.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>The venomous tone momentarily deflated, leaving behind a sense of disappointment. Kwon Chae-woo didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>“I heard mother-in-law was Brooke Shields in her younger days. My third brother is running an investment company, a production company, and an entertainment company. I can introduce you to him. His domestic entertainment company’s market capitalization exceeded 4 trillion won when it went public.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Mother-in-law, isn’t it a shame to waste your talent only on managing the household… alone? It’s expensive too.”</p>
<p>He was undoubtedly a scheming man. Chooja’s cheeks were already flushed as if she had drunk heavily. As if signaling the end, Lee-yeon nonchalantly shook the blanket, raising her head.</p>
<p>“If that path doesn’t suit you, I’ll find some clean, elderly gentlemen with assets of over 100 billion won and no troublesome children for you.”</p>
<p>“…Don’t analyze too much.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>While Kwon Chae-woo chuckled and said he’d go buy something to drink, Chooja had already escaped. Lee-yeon was about to call Chooja but stopped as she saw her expression change.</p>
<p>“That should be enough.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon asked, and Choo-ja squinted one eye.</p>
<p>“You should perform this kind of show to keep a tight grip on Mr. Kwon in the future.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Men need to know how scary their in-laws can be.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Just now, didn’t you see how scared he was of me to the point of bargaining me with a marriage?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“And from my intuition, that’s not the end for you two. The sprout is not just yellow, it’s sparkling gold!”</p>
<p>Choo-ja, who had been wiggling her nostrils, suddenly used her rough hand to gently stroke Lee-yeon’s face.</p>
<p>“We won’t rush the marriage registration, okay? There’s no harm in living together for a while.”</p>
<p>Despite the tender touch, Choo-ja’s mouth curled up as if to say, ‘It’s really satisfying.’</p>
<p>Lee-yeon lowered her head and let go of the embarrassment that lingered in her heart. “Is it… not pathetic?”</p>
<p>“You? Why?”</p>
<p>“Breaking up so noisily and now reconcciling like this…”</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon lowered her voice as if she was ashamed, Choo-ja laughed heartily and took the opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>“That’s called love!”</p>
<p>Choo-ja laughed kindly and put her palm against her cheek. Her face tilted slightly, reminiscent of somewhere in the past, exuding a faint and enchanting feeling.</p>
<p>“Yeon-ah, your husband’s face is still handsome even if you tore it apart.”</p>
<p>“Bringing back the guy who fled from the island, well done, well done,” Choo-ja said, patting her knees for a while.</p>
<p>It was still an inexplicable fight between the mother-in-law and son-in-law where it was unclear who won or lost.</p>
