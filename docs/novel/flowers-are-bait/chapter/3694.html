            <p><strong>Chapter 85</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon felt sick as she remembered that these are all an illusion.</p>
<p><em>“If I don’t remember anything, our relationship will get easier?”</em> He had told her before, which she answered a treacherous “yes”.</p>
<p>Lies are being piled up.</p>
<p>Even so, she wanted to live a normal life, so she could cherish memories of this time forever.</p>
<p>It was all an hourglass that Lee-yeon had flipped, and the sand was slipping quickly.</p>
<p>Finally pulling his lips away, Kwon Chae-woo grinned at her. “I think it would be a good idea if I worked,” he said. “Your reaction is really turning me on. <em>It’s</em>getting harder.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was dumfounded and blushed at his bluntness, trying her best to restrain herself from looking down..</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo looked at her. “I’ll work,” he told her. “No matter what the work may be.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon bit her lip. She didn’t know how Kwon Chae-woo would handle being an animal rescuer. He seemed more like the type to hunt them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Joo Dong-mi stared at the door as it closed behind her. She hoped Lee-yeon would forgive her for her actions towards her husband. It wasn’t right to meddle in the business of another family, much more show interest to a married man right in front of his wife.</p>
<p>She turned around a corner scratching her head, feeling ridiculous of how things turned out when suddenly she saw something which piqued her interest.</p>
<p><em>‘I feel like I’ve seen him somewhere before…. But where?’</em></p>
<p>She caught sight of a man leaning against the wall of the house. She would have just walked by, but his physique reeled her in. It was rare to see a man like this in Hwaido. And it was also strange to see one hanging about in the middle of the week.</p>
<p>Most of all, he looked very familiar to her.</p>
<p>“Hey there,” she smiled.</p>
<p>As she approached, Jang Beom-hee flinched. He had expected her to walk past him, but now she was looking right at him. He pulled his cap down but that didn’t stop Joo Dong-mi from trying to get a proper look at him.</p>
<p>“Howdy!” she said. “Do you live nearby?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer but she could see his throat bob.</p>
<p>“I work for the Wildlife Rescue Center,” Joo Dong-mi explained, showing the logo on her jacket.</p>
<p>Ignoring her, Jang Beom-hee tried to walk away. But Joo Dong-mi stopped him. She was used to herding animals.</p>
<p>“I have no bad intentions,” she said. “But have we met before? Your face seems familiar.”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee tried to evade her gaze, but he failed.</p>
<p>“Oh! I remember!” Joo Dong-mi exclaimed. “You’re the server that took my glass at my uncle’s party!”</p>
<p>The man became flustered right away.</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee knew Joo Dong-mi, of course. He knew everyone that knew the young master and Lee-yeon. It was also partly a mistake when he took her glass, he had hoped she wouldn’t have remembered him for that.</p>
<p>“I knew it,” Joo Dong-mi smiled to herself. “I recognize people pretty easily. But your clothes…” She stepped back a little to study him. “Are you a police then?” Jang Beom-hee froze, and Joo Dong-mi pouted.</p>
<p>She looked down at his clothes, even if he already knew what he was wearing. He had been using his police uniform after wrapping up an incident at the drug farm. How could he be so unlucky? Why did someone have to recognize him?</p>
<p>Instinctively, he reached into his pocket and clutched his small knife.</p>
<p>“What is it about this town?” Joo Dong-mi laughed, completely oblivious to the man’s discomfort. “There seems to be so many people with the perfect physique nowadays.” She rubbed the back of her neck. “But why was a police at my uncle’s party? Was it like an undercover thing? Did my uncle get involved in some money laundering? He’s not a bad person but he seems like the type to something like that.”</p>
<p>As Joo Dong-mi reached up to rub her chin, Jang Beom-hee pushed her off and started to walk away.</p>
<p>“Hey! What’s your name?!” Joo Dong-mi persisted. “How old are you?!”</p>
<p>Just as she was about to say something else, Jang Beom-hee grabbed her collar and slammed her against a wall.</p>
<p>“Don’t get in my way,” he finally said, his voice grave. He let her go but, just as he was about to leave, a flying kick threw him off. Before he could regain his balance, she had already wrapped a rope around his ankle and pulled him in.</p>
<p>“Can police even do that to a citizen?” she demanded. “What are you, you bastard?”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee glanced at the door nervously. If Kwon Chae-woo came out now, it would be very bad. Jang Beom-hee’s job was to protect the Young Master and keep Hwaido under control. His role wasn’t supposed to cause a commotion like this.</p>
<p>Deciding on the best course of action, he lowered his body and covered Joo Dong-mi’s mouth with his hand. “Just be quiet first,” he said. He sighed and ran a hand over his face. “What is it that you want?”</p>
<p>Joo Dong-mi’s eyes lit up.</p>
