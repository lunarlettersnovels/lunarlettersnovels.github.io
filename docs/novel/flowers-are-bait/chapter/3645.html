            <p><strong>Chapter 136</strong></p>
<p>At that moment, he grabbed Lee-yeon’s neck roughly and placed his lips over hers. As their breathing grew rapid, their two bodies came together softly. As their legs became entangled, he thrust his tongue into her mouth.</p>
<p>He slid his tongue along the roof of her mouth causing Lee-yeon to wriggle her shoulders and tilt her head up.</p>
<p>Chae-woo buried his hand deep in her hair and kissed her deeply as though trying to swallow her up. As their kisses grew more passionate, he felt himself harden as their bodies rubbed against each other.</p>
<p>“Hahh…,” a low moan escaped his lips.</p>
<p>This was the woman who had deceived him and who had some sort of relationship with his brother. Chae-woo was confused himself.</p>
<p>Just as she had deceived him, he would do the same to her and shamelessly continue to pose as her husband. Until the day he left her side.</p>
<p>But it was getting harder to tell what was an act and what was sincere. He knew he needed to push her away with everything he had, and yet she pulled him back in with all her might.</p>
<p>This man, whose heart was full of confusion and loathing, tilted Lee-yeon’s head back and kissed her desperately.</p>
<p>He felt an inexplicable joy, the unfamiliarity of which caused him to distort his face. The more he ran his hands over her smooth body and explored her tongue with his, the more intense his feeling of longing grew, washing over him like a wave.</p>
<p>The softness of her tongue. The tip of his nose pressing against her. The warmth of her breath on his face as she moaned softly. Saliva dripped from their mouths. He bit Lee-yeon’s lip hard, tugging her bottom lip with his teeth. Her breathless moans were sweet like honey.</p>
<p>Chae-woo’s body shook with desire. He knew the name of every scale and chord of the piano and yet there was no word to express the sounds coming from Lee-yeon. An indescribable sense of relief pulled him in deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>“Uh, Chae-woo, ha….”</p>
<p>At the same time, he noticed how comfortable Lee-yeon was with kissing and a new feeling sparked inside him.</p>
<p><em>Who the fuck has she been kissing?</em></p>
<p>Chae-woo immediately felt the urge to interrogate her but decided that would come off as unseemly.</p>
<p>His strange desire to have sole possession of her transformed him into a different person every moment.</p>
<p>“From now on, don’t be overly considerate and share your every burden with me.”</p>
<p>“Hhmm…”</p>
<p>“Even if what you’re trying to hide is a shitty family.”</p>
<p>Their voices, heated glances, and hot breath mingled and intertwined in the space between them. His lips against hers, he whispered, “You have to throw me something to gnaw on.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“That’s how you treat a dog.”</p>
<p>Riiiip–he tore away Lee-yeon’s linen shirt.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Embarrassed, Lee-yeon pushed against Chae-woo’s shoulder, but he responded by lifting her hips.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>With their positions reversed, lifted his head as though he’d been waiting for this moment and pressed head between her legs. Nipping her lightly here and there with his teeth, he explored the taste of her with the tip of his tongue. Lee-yeon shook her head, but his lips were already on her.</p>
<p>Chae-woo wrapped her legs around his waist and pushed her against the wall. Caught between the wall and Chae-woo, Lee-yeon couldn’t resist feeling aroused by the feel of his body against hers.</p>
<p>“Ha…!”</p>
<p>He bent his head down and kissed her neck, swirling his tongue around and sucking hard. His body trembled at the taste of her body.</p>
<p>He had already become irresistibly hard and could feel himself pressing against her stomach as he growled, “Why do you keep making me care about everything?”</p>
<p>He tore away the rest of her torn shirt and grabbed for her breasts.</p>
<p>“Chae, Chae-woo, hold on ah!”</p>
<p>“We were getting along just fine.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>“I really tried my best.”</p>
<p>He swept his eyes over her breasts.</p>
<p>“But you started this. By showing me such a pitiful side of yourself.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s body trembled at the sound of breath. He pushed Lee-yeon’s bra aside and looked at her bare breasts expressionlessly. But the sense of calm lasted just an instant. Small, round, and red. His mouth watered at the sight of it, the same color as her red swollen lips. He reached for her nipples hungrily with his mouth. He wrapped his mouth around the small of her breast and slowly flicked his tongue against the tip.</p>
<p>“Chae, Chae-woo. Hah, wait, Hah, hold on!”</p>
<p>Shudders, goosebumps, and in an instant her nipple stiffened to a point.</p>
<p>But it only made him more ravenous. She almost winced out of instinct when he suddenly coiled his tongue once more around her nipple and sucked so hard his cheeks dimpled. Her nipples became harder and harder from the stimulation.</p>
<p>“Hah, hah……!”</p>
<p>As swirled his tongue over her breasts and continued to suck on her nipples. As his tongue traveled over her skin, Lee-yeon pushed her head back against the wall or tightened her legs.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, ah.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon grabbed his shoulder and looked into his eyes, her face flush with lust. At the same time, Chae-woo slipped off her tights and loosened his buckle. Lee-yeon’s body writhed, her hair a mess.</p>
<p>“I’m, I’m sweaty……”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I ever tell you? I like your sweat.”</p>
