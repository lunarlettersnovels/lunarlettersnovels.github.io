            <p><strong>Chapter 80</strong></p>
<p>His hard shaft went deeper. As he rubbed against her, it pierced something deep inside her. She couldn’t control herself anymore. The pleasure was impossible.</p>
<p>“Hng…. Ahhhh!” she moaned.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s insides squeezed tighter. Kwon Chae-woo closed his eyes and groaned. He gritted his teeth. When he saw her hard n*pples and her neck, he wanted to come so badly. He was barely able to hold back.</p>
<p>She moaned and grabbed the pillow tightly as Kwon Chae-woo’s thrusts became frantic. His length was shoved so hard and fast that she felt scared for a moment. This was truly an act of animals. She felt as though she would die momentarily every time he thrust inside her and was out of breath.</p>
<p>“It’s strange, Lee-yeon,” he whispered hoarsely as he thrust in and out of her. “Why does it seem like you are a virgin to me?”</p>
<p>His eyes that looked at her were confused. He looked at her body below him. Her face seemed flustered. Her body trembled. Her hands didn’t embrace him, not even a little. It was almost like she didn’t know what to do with her body in this situation.</p>
<p>“Why does it seem like it’s your first time?” he asked. “It doesn’t make sense. We were married way back.”</p>
<p>She bit her lower lips trying to keep her pleasure under control and averted his eyes. As he moved frantically against her, she couldn’t help but moan again.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Lee-yeon,” he whispered. “Why do you act so timid?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t speak. He couldn’t make sense of anything except him inside her and the pleasure that it gave. Her walls were torn down. Her mind was blank.</p>
<p>“Did… the previous Kwon Chae-woo didn’t do it like this?” he thrust into her, and her fluid flowed out. “Hmm… is that it?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo grunted, grabbed her thighs and pushed himself even more in a hurry. <em>I haven’t done much and she is already… </em>As he thrust inside her, he caressed her lower part. It wasn’t enough. Lee-yeon felt like she was going to burn with the heat.</p>
<p>“Tell me,” he whispered. “Do I feel like a foreign man?”</p>
<p>He was panting now. His eyes looked bloodshot. Lee-yeon knew that question came out of jealousy. “How could we have been sexually incompatible, Lee-yeon? This feels so good. It was a lie, wasn’t it? You are a liar.”</p>
<p>He buried his head onto her chest. Her body felt too hot. Her mind was completely blank.</p>
<p>“That bastard probably did it every day. Can’t I do it a little?” he said hoarsely.</p>
<p>He buried his head onto her chest and refused to look at her. He grunted as he shoved inside her. Lee-yeon panted. The pleasure was too overwhelming.</p>
<p>“I’m your husband now, so you should spread only for me,” he said in a low voice. “You said we didn’t do it. Do you know what your inside is like? Just who do you think I am that you’re suddenly so welcoming?”</p>
<p>His thrusts became rough. “Why won’t you touch me?” he asked. “Why won’t you touch me even a little?”</p>
<p>She felt like she was on fire. His body was too hot. She was going to burn.</p>
<p>“It’s fun to watch you like this. Somedays you hold onto me tightly as if out of some damned responsibility. But some other day, you meet someone else. You are just too much.”</p>
<p>He let out a moan. His eyes shone like a beast’s. One hand held her down while the other caressed her. Lee-yeon felt as though her mind might turn completely into mush.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo…,” she whimpered.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo heard her tiny voice. His hips, that thrust so hard that it was sending her reeling to the edge, suddenly stopped. He stared at her.</p>
<p>“Don’t you look down on me, you idiot,” she said, panting. “It’s reasonable for someone to not be that good in bed. Not everyone’s the same! If the one who is bad in bed is me, so what? I am the one who consented to sleep with you. Why are you making me feel incompetent?!”</p>
<p>Her anger was justified. She didn’t know what to do with her body because she had never done this before. And she couldn’t understand all the strange feelings. Even so, he didn’t need to spell it out to her.</p>
<p>“You are really so heartless. You have no kindness. No bedroom manners, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo was stunned. She grabbed her waist and lifted her up to sit on his thigh. Lee-yeon wrapped her arms around his shoulders instinctively.</p>
<p>Somehow, his hardness found its way back into her. She gasped. She let out a low moan as he moved against him. Kwon Chae-woo liked seeing her like this. He couldn’t take his eyes off her face.</p>
<p>As she moved against him, he slid his hand down and touched her below. She buckled. ‘That’s right. Fill yourself up as much as you want to, Lee-yeon,” he whispered.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo held her tight. He kissed her neck and on her cheek. She felt flustered but she kept moving against him. She dug her nails into his shoulders. She moved faster and harder until she felt as though she couldn’t anymore. He laid her on the bed and continued thrusting into her, most gently. She looked up at him. This was the first time she had gathered to see him as he was.</p>
<p>He moaned and slid out of her, spraying her belly with a white liquid. He sounded as though he was ready to retire anytime soon and settled himself beside Lee-yeon who looked just as exhausted. Kwon Chae-woo, after a while, raised his head from her shoulders and looked at her.</p>
<p>“You look more beautiful when you are messy.” He smiled and pulled her close to him. Lee-yeon could only stare at him as he slept.</p>
