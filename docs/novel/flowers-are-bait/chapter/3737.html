            <p><strong>Chapter 42</strong></p>
<p>It was already morning when Lee-yeon woke up with a headache. She got up from the bed, not knowing how the dinner party ended.</p>
<p>Just then, the bathroom door opened, and a man wrapped in a large towel, dripping water, walked out.</p>
<p>His wide shoulders and the water cascading down his toned chest caught Lee-yeon’s attention immediately.</p>
<p>“Good morning”</p>
<p>“What, what is that?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean, why are you…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon couldn’t take her eyes off the man who had just come out from the shower. She knew that observing a half-naked person was not a manner, but human curiosity was more tenacious than she thought.</p>
<p>Her hangover went away like magic. Her eyes then turned to the towel that covered his lower body.</p>
<p><em>‘The silhouette under the fabric…….’</em></p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, do you remember what I said after the dinner party yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes?” Lee-yeon flinched and looked up at Kwon Chae-woo. She brushed her hair and pretended like she was unperturbed, but there was no way to hide her blushing face.</p>
<p>“What… did you say?”</p>
<p>“I said my memory came back a little bit.” He said with a frown.</p>
<p>“What?!”Her mouth was wide open, and her face turned pale. The dust floating in the air seemed to have stifled her. It suddenly became difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>“W—what did you just-”Her voice trembled.</p>
<p>He stepped closer, the water dripping from his hair started to form a valley on ran down Lee-yeon’s knees.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo looked down at Lee-yeon and said in a calm voice.</p>
<p>“I was going to kill myself.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as if time had stopped. <em>‘He was…. going to kill himself?’</em> It was something Lee-yeon didn’t know. Her body became so stiff that she couldn’t even manage to pry her mouth open.</p>
<p>Since she was the one who knew the truth and hid the truth, she always got the upper in her relationship with Kwon Chae-woo. But for the first time, their position changed.</p>
<p>“I died two years ago.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo knelt on the bed and looked down at her. His posture looked like he was begging for forgiveness, but in Lee-yeon’s eyes, he looked authoritative.</p>
<p>Between the man’s knees, Lee-yeon’s legs were bound. She was so close to him that she could see the tiny water droplets dripping down his abs.</p>
<p>“I’m dead.” He repeated as if trying to brainwash her. “That Kwon Chae-woo is dead.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I never wanted him to wake up.”</p>
<p>It was not only Lee-yeon who took advantage of the memory loss. Kwon Chae-woo wanted to comfort her by erasing all his past. He wanted to tell her that the man who gave her unrecoverable wounds was gone.</p>
<p>If only he could squeeze in even a little bit of Lee-yeon’s closed heart and become a new sprout, he wouldn’t feel guilty about lying.</p>
<p>“… Do you, do you really remember?”</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes filled with confusion.</p>
<p><em>‘The man who was burying a person was trying to kill himself?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘No way.’</em></p>
<p>Lee-yeon narrowed her eyes, and Kwon Chae-woo did not avoid her gaze. Suddenly, she remembered the moment when her eyes met with Kwon Chae-woo’s in the dark mountain that night.</p>
<p><em>‘He seemed surprised to see me.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Come to think of it, I know nothing about Kwon Chae-woo.’</em></p>
<p>What nightmares he has every night, and why, as Kwon Ki-seok said, a person who has sensitive hearing got attacked from behind. There were too many unknowns in the first place to doubt his confession, so every attempt felt useless.</p>
<p>In that respect, she was no different from Kwon Chae-woo, who lost his memory because she knew nothing about him.</p>
<p>As if insisting on his innocence, the man looked her straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>“There is only one thing you need to remember from now on.”</p>
<p>She wanted to organize her thoughts, but the man didn’t allow even the slightest gap. Lee-yeon broke out in a cold sweat despite his mellow, soothing voice.</p>
<p>“Because you told me I was a kind and gentle husband, I wanted to become such a husband from now on. So, I filled my empty head with only your words.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Because your words are my first milestone to change.”</p>
<p>“Keep in mind. Your first husband died two years ago. I’m not your ex-husband. If you still have a ring, throw it away, and if there are any pictures you took with him, burn them.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon didn’t know how to react.</p>
<p>“You now have a new husband, and I’m not going to lose to ‘that Kwon Chae-woo’ in your memory.” He revealed his fierce possessiveness. “Since you started taming me, you have to take responsibility until the end.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon held her breath without realizing it. The man who put shackles on his own neck was beaming, and she couldn’t tell if that was a good thing or not.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Clear eyes, creaseless forehead, Kwon Chae-woo was enjoying the morning sun shining through the window.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon couldn’t get used to the man sitting at the table eating breakfast with her.</p>
<p><em>‘…Why is he not asking anything? If his memory is coming back, he must have a lot of questions. Did Kwon Chae-woo really tried to kill himself?’</em></p>
<p>However, Kwon Chae-woo, who was only interested in the present and even made bean sprout soup in the morning for Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>She began to study the man’s face. He was sitting in a straight posture, and the way he held the chopsticks was perfect as the images from the textbook.</p>
<p>There was no sound of tableware hitting or chewing food. Lee-yeon slightly frowned as the unexpected silence fell between them.</p>
<p>She put the spoon down as she rubbed her cheek. “Kwon Chae-woo.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” He immediately turned his eyes to her.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have anything to say to me? Anything you’re curious about.”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Lee-yeon bit her lips.</p>
<p><em>‘Tak―’ </em>Just then, Kwon Chae-woo put down his chopsticks. It was the first noise he made since he had sat down at the table.</p>
