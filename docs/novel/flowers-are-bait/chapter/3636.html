            <p><strong>Chapter 145</strong></p>
<p>“Introducing you all to the tax-paying pine tree, Seok Song-ryeong,” Lee-yeon declared, capturing the attention of the slumbering students. Their curious eyes fixed on the towering specimen, filled with wonder.</p>
<p>As a group that shared a deep love for pine trees, the students instinctively analyzed the tree’s age and health. A smile played on Lee-yeon’s lips as she basked in their shared passion for the natural world.</p>
<p>“Do any of you pay property tax?” the students asked in hushed tones.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon shook her head. “Not yet, but this tree is unique. It holds a resident number and is a registered landowner.”</p>
<p>“A landowner?” they repeated in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Lee-yeon confirmed. “It owns a plot of land measuring two thousand pyeong.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The students gasped in amazement at the information they received.</p>
<p>“If a tree can inherit, you won’t find its like anywhere else in the world,” Lee-yeon added, emphasizing the tree’s unique qualities.</p>
<p>Even the small fir tree, with its simple brushstroke appearance, seemed even more magnificent in light of this new knowledge. The students gazed in awe at the large leaves overhead, their mouths slightly agape.</p>
<p>“This tree not only pays income and land taxes from the crops it produces, but it also supports the community by offering scholarships to nearby students,” Lee-yeon explained, scanning the group with a hint of nervousness.</p>
<p>Her cheeks flushed red as she locked eyes with a few male students, particularly the towering figure of Kwon Chae-woo, who stood out with his cold expression.</p>
<p>Despite her efforts to remain composed, Lee-yeon couldn’t shake off the nervousness that came with being watched by him..</p>
<p>“And so every year on Lunar New Year, the villagers hold a ceremony in honor of the tree,” Lee-yeon added with a forced smile, her jaw visibly trembling.</p>
<p>Her thoughts raced as she wondered why Kwon Chae-woo was here. She had gone to the office the night before to avoid him, but now he was here in front of her. The sound of footsteps and breathing echoed in her mind from that pitch-black room.</p>
<p>She had stayed up late, scribbling in her treatment diary with a focused gaze. It wasn’t until the break of dawn that she returned to the living room.</p>
<p>“Whoa…” the students exclaimed in wonder, but Lee-yeon’s thoughts were elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the darkness, Lee-yeon’s eyes locked with Kwon Chae-woo’s, their gaze as intense as blades. He was sitting on the sofa, just as she had left him, and the moment she saw him, his cold and piercing eyes made her shiver. She couldn’t understand why he was still here, waiting for her with such determination.</p>
<p>“Is everything finished?” Kwon asked, examining her closely. Lee-yeon quickly nodded, feeling intimidated by the severity in his words.</p>
<p>As he stood up from the couch, the cheap leather cushions sagged under his weight. He walked towards Lee-yeon, making her feel trapped and leading her towards the bedroom. Despite the uncomfortable atmosphere, she slept soundly and woke up feeling refreshed the next morning.</p>
<p>She went about her day normally, seeing Kwon off to work. Yet, there he was, still observing her with a hawk-like intensity.</p>
<p><em>‘Why is he here?’</em></p>
<p>The man in his casual clothes looked no different from the surrounding students. But his eyes were different from the students. He looked suspicious. Lee-yeon kept trying to break away from the nerve-wracking stare and continued with her teaching.</p>
<p>“The landowner who had no children gave this land to this tree. It’s already been registered for eighty years and left a will, so it’s officially inherited. The trunk had withered. Lee-yeon checked her watch while slightly raising her straw hat.</p>
<p>“Shall we go to the next pine tree?”</p>
<p>At that moment, the club president approached and handed her a cold drink. “Here you go, teacher,” he said, his voice soft and respectful.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon hesitated, her eyes flicking between the aluminum can and the young man in front of her.</p>
<p>“Teacher, you used to write a column about tree stories for the K newspaper, right?” the young man continued, a hint of excitement in his voice.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stiffened, her eyes wide with surprise. “How do you know that?”</p>
<p>She thought no one read the article she wrote.</p>
<p>“I just happened to see it in my uncle’s newspaper, and I’ve been reading it ever since. I thought your perspective was cool. I’ve been wondering who this person is who thinks from the perspective of a tree. I was disappointed that it wasn’t a regular column.”</p>
<p>The young man’s words caused a flicker of pride in Lee-yeon’s chest, but it was quickly replaced with a sense of unease. She couldn’t shake the feeling that she was being watched.</p>
<p>The young man with a gentle expression ran his fingers through his hair.</p>
<p>“I thought maybe I could become a fan of you at this point,” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh, I am happy that you liked my article,” said Lee-yeon, startled by the unfamiliar words and lowering her head.</p>
<p>“It’s true. From the perspective of the hurting trees, it’s a shock for me to inflict harm on people. To be honest, I even asked my uncle to introduce us because I really wanted to meet you.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“I’ve been looking for someone who can fill a whole day just talking about trees.” He blushed and smoothed his neck.</p>
<p>“Teacher, do you know older men?”</p>
<p>The young man’s sharp eyebrows drew together as he struggled to find the words he wanted to say. He opened and closed his mouth, looking momentarily flustered.</p>
<p>“If you’re talking about older men who spend hours talking to trees,” Lee-yeon responded with a small smile, “then I know plenty of them.”</p>
<p>The young man seemed to relax a little, but his gaze remained intense. “No, that’s not what I meant,” he corrected.</p>
<p>His eyes never left Lee-yeon’s as he asked, “Teacher, do you have a boyfriend?”</p>
