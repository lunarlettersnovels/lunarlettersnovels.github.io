            <p><strong>Chapter 181</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon hurriedly left the garden with quick steps, clutching her thumping heart.</p>
<p>“What, what is this…!”</p>
<p>Ever since she set foot in the mansion, or perhaps even since she packed her belongings to temporarily leave Hwaido, she had considered the possibility of encountering Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>But she never expected to come face to face with him so suddenly like this, not even in her dreams.</p>
<p>“Gasp…!”</p>
<p>Yeon quickly moved away from the spot without running, gasping for breath. Her shoulder and hand, which had been held by him, felt hot and tingling.</p>
<p>She brushed over them as if trying to rub off any invisible marks, as if trying to brush away any lingering traces.</p>
<p>The moment she faced the man, still without a single blemish, Lee-yeon felt like the past month had flown by like a shooting star.</p>
<p>The presence of time she had overcome seemed even more precious than his towering existence. Though she momentarily felt surprised, her heart quickly regained its composure.</p>
<p>She brushed it off, labeling him as someone who only shared superficial similarities.</p>
<p>“It’s wise to strike fast and make a swift exit.”</p>
<p>Like someone fleeing, she had the urge to glance back, but Lee-yeon clenched her fist and restrained herself.</p>
<p>Throughout her journey from Hwaido to this place, she had felt discomfort, yet she received an exceptional chauffeur.</p>
<p>This morning, passing through a grand gate that resembled a fortress, traversing a long and lush tree-lined street that seemed astonishingly endless, and passing through the main gate and another inner gate, Lee-yeon finally arrived at the well-positioned mansion nestled beneath a scenic mountain.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lee-yeon managed to gather some trivial information about the Kwon family. The second son was a primary school teacher who had long severed ties with this household, and the third son had become independent by pursuing an entertainment business.</p>
<p>Therefore, only the eldest son, Kwon Ki-seok, and the youngest, Kwon Chae-woo, were currently responsible for the family affairs and maintaining the estate.</p>
<p>The chauffeur had strongly advised the newcomer never to get involved with those two individuals, but Lee-yeon could only manage an awkward smile in response.</p>
<p><em>If only he knew.</em></p>
<p>As she approached the mansion, the gradually revealed garden appeared vast and lush. In particular, the enchanting display of blooming flowers left Lee-yeon with no choice but to immerse her hazy mind in their intoxicating fragrance.</p>
<p>Among all the gardens she had seen, this one stood out as the most vivid and splendid. She requested a momentary pause, seeking permission to step onto the grass without hesitation.</p>
<p>It resembled the meticulously maintained gardens of foreign palaces. Usually, gardens designed in such a manner were shaped according to people’s preferences, with trees meticulously pruned.</p>
<p>Fortunately, contrary to such concerns, the garden looked exceptionally healthy at first glance.</p>
<p><em>Who took care of it? What kind of fertilizer did they use? Look at their skillful craftsmanship… </em>Lee-yeon wanted to quickly open their work logs and find out. But unexpectedly, she ended up encountering Kwon Chae-woo…</p>
<p>She abruptly interrupted her train of thought and hastened her steps.</p>
<p>“Have you seen enough?”</p>
<p>The chauffeur, who had been leaning against the car, casually asked as Lee-yeon approached in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you for waiting…!”</p>
<p>“But is someone chasing you? Why are you in such a rush–”</p>
<p>“Sir, hurry!”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Quickly, let’s go!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon forcefully urged, opening the car door and acting impatiently.</p>
<p>To her surprise, Kwon Chae-woo, who had belatedly regained his composure, was chasing after her with a fearsome expression.</p>
<p>While Lee-yeon had been gradually distancing herself with her occasional strides, witnessing Chae-woo sprinting like a wild horse with his long legs made her heart race uncontrollably and her lips dry up.</p>
<p>“Sir!”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, I got it!”</p>
<p>The chauffeur, trembling with sudden anxiety, started the car. Just as they blinked, Chae-woo approached them, bending his waist and peering into the backseat. His large palm stuck firmly to the window, his pupils scrutinizing the interior, and his hunched posture with a twisted head somehow seemed inhuman.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Startled, Lee-yeon involuntarily let out a gasp, and the corners of the man’s mouth lifted. Despite the heavily tinted windows of the car, making it impossible to see anything, he instinctively seemed to sense Lee-yeon’s presence.</p>
<p>The muffled voice from behind the thick car body pierced Lee-yeon’s ears with precision.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, come out quietly before I break this and drag you out.”</p>
<p>Silently, the car’s frame shook relentlessly as he forcefully pounded on the roof. The chauffeur, bewildered, tightly gripped the steering wheel, while Lee-yeon held onto the door handle.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, let’s have a talk.”</p>
<p>Though the familiar tone sent shivers down her spine, she mustered the courage to shout back in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>“Step on the accelerator, sir!”</p>
<p>“But, what about the young master—”</p>
<p>“He’s insane, so just step on it!”</p>
<p>As if those words were a trigger, the chauffeur swiftly pressed down on the accelerator. Then, faintly, came a furious curse, “Damn it!” But Lee-yeon didn’t have the courage to look back.</p>
<p>Thump, thump, thump! The trunk rattled violently under the aggressive hands of the man.</p>
