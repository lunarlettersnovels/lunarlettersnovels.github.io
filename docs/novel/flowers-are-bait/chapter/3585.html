            <p><strong>Chapter 198</strong></p>
<p>He pressed Lee-yeon against the tree and sucked on her index and middle finger. The fingers being drawn into Kwon Chae-woo’s mouth felt like they might melt any moment.</p>
<p>As the warm, wet sensation enveloped her fingers, Lee-yeon’s face turned red. His hot tongue gently grazed her wound as it sucked in her blood.</p>
<p>“W-What are you—”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, his emotions clearly not fully restrained, gazed at her with a mixture of annoyance and intense heat. As Lee-yeon instinctively attempted to withdraw her finger, he tightened his grip on her wrist and looked down. He swallowed her finger completely.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Her finger tingled.</p>
<p>He continued to swallow, whether it was his own saliva or her blood. Kwon Chae-woo scraped the tip of her finger with his teeth and pressed her wound with his tongue. The pain in her finger grew.</p>
<p>“Stop it and back off…!”</p>
<p>“But it’s still juicy.”</p>
<p>As Kwon Chae-woo mumbled with her finger in his mouth, she could see her blood on his tongue. Lee-yeon felt embarrassed and pushed him but it was no use.</p>
<p>If anything, his bottom started to react.</p>
<p>“Ut…! Don’t you get hard.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Then w, what is this….!”</p>
<p>“Just a normal d*ck. It’s calm.”</p>
<p>“… What?”</p>
<p>At the same time, there was a sexual moan nearby, with laughter and sound of banging and other noise that made her ears flare.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon looked down, but Kwon Chae-woo was still looking at her.</p>
<p>The wound from the scissors was so wet that it tingled. But he kept on sucking on it like he was kissing it.</p>
<p>The way he was pressuring made her head go numb. Lee-yeon just spat out whatever she could think of.</p>
<p>“…. What are you really trying to do with me? This is too much between us. Stop crossing the line.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon kept on pushing his shoulders but she quickly took her hands off from the heat.</p>
<p>“Y, you think we’ll make up? What is your intention? Just bite me instead! Stop sucking on my blood and make me bleed instead!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stomped her feet anxiously.</p>
<p>At that moment, Kwon Chae-woo’s teeth touched her finger. Lee-yeon took her chance and tapped on his teeth and scratched the top of his mouth.</p>
<p>–It’s 00:24, we’re going in.</p>
<p>But Kwon Chae-woo didn’t look hurt. If anything, he was smiling. When his sharp eyes relaxed, Kwon Chae-woo noticed a subtle change and covered Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“You f*cking bastard!” A man hurled insults.</p>
<p>Something broke and exploded in front of his nose.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo, you crazy bastard, this isn’t fair.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon breathed in surprise.</p>
<p>Standing there was a man with his forehead teared up and holding a neck of a broken wine bottle.</p>
<p>His always smiling face was utterly ruined and his eyes were no longer normal.</p>
<p>It looked like he had some wine as there was a purple trace from his mouth to his chin and there was some weird white powder by his nose.</p>
<p>“Take her clothes off. Why the f*ck are you putting in back on?”</p>
<p>He was pointing at Lee-yeon while waving her mask in the air.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s face turned cold and he turned around while putting Lee-yeon behind him. As he brushed his hair, the pieces of glass fell on the floor.</p>
<p>He should’ve gone into the deeper part of the garden the moment they came off the tree, but he was too preoccupied with sucking on her finger so it was his fault.</p>
<p>-00:44, we couldn’t get through. We’ll be going around.</p>
<p>He didn’t ponder for that long. Kwon Chae-woo wasn’t shaken as he went to Do Kyung-jin, the son of the hospital director.</p>
<p>He choked Do Kyung-jin’s throat and looked into his eyes.</p>
<p>Then he took the bottleneck from him and shoved it in his mouth.</p>
<p>“Do Kyung-jin, who is this mask you are looking for?”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>As he couldn’t answer due to pain, Kwon Chae-woo took out the bottle from his mouth and asked again.</p>
<p>“Who is that mask?”</p>
<p>“Y, you fucking asshole, are you crazy? Why are you acting like this? Ah fuck, I told you it’s that bitch!”</p>
<p>“You’re wrong.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo stabbed his tongue with a piece of glass. Do Kyung-jin waved his arms and scratched Kwon Chae-woo’s back.</p>
<p>“Kyung-jin, who’s the mask?”</p>
<p>“That woman—“</p>
<p>“Wrong.”</p>
<p>He shoved the bottleneck into his mouth again. Do Kyung-jin’s mouth became bloody.</p>
<p>“Kyung-jin, who’s the mask?”</p>
<p>“Hm…!”</p>
<p>“You’re on drugs and confused, so I’m correcting you.”</p>
<p>As Kwon Chae-woo gritted his teeth and slowly shoved the bottle down his throat, the man’s breathing also got weaker. Do Kyung-jin’s eyes were turning white, and Kwon Chae-woo whispered to him like he was waiting for that moment.</p>
<p>“I’m the mask, Kyung-jin.”</p>
<p>“Uh…!”</p>
<p>The cold fear drove the drugs away from Do Kyung-jin.</p>
<p>As people slowly gathered, Kwon Chae-woo threw the bottleneck on the ground and put the mask on.</p>
<p>Do Kyung-jin grabbed his throat and coughed out blood. His lips were completely ripped and it kept on bleeding. He was cursing while having cold sweat.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, on the other hand, whispered to Lee-yeon while wearing her mask.</p>
<p>“When people come, hide amongst the crowd. No matter what happens, pretend you don’t know me and hang on for 20 minutes.”</p>
