        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 224</strong></p>
<p>Someone urgently inquired about her, sending a shiver down Lee-yeon’s spine. She rose quickly from her task of filling the earth and turned to see the concerned face.</p>
<p>“Since he’s wearing a bulletproof vest, apart from the gunshot wound in his arm, he’s okay. Thankfully, the major blood vessels are undamaged. However, with nine bullets lodged in the bulletproof vest, a rib broke. The fractured rib punctured an organ, causing significant bleeding, but it’s been sutured cleanly, and his vitals are stable.”</p>
<p>The doctor cleared his throat a couple of times and, passing Lee-yeon, exited the scene. His room had already been perfectly prepared as a VIP suite, and this kind of interior was quite familiar to Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>It was just like the room she’d had for the past two years, taking care of a plant-human. Bizarrely, memories suddenly emerged, pricking her heart.</p>
<p><em>“Since I’m a bastard, just treat me like a plant. Lee-yeon, you cut branches well, right? Keep adding my restrictions, first, second, third, and each time, just cut off my limbs until I can’t do anything. Then you can just water me a little each time.”</em></p>
<p>Lee-yeon stood beside his bed, staring at Kwon Chae-woo, who looked like a corpse. She pressed down her feelings that threatened to overflow at any moment.</p>
<p>She touched his dry, lifeless fingers, and it made her tear up.</p>
<p>“Never… bring up the idea of cutting plants and limbs again. Why are people so extreme?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, without warning, the door swung open, and Kwon Ki-seok rushed in. He stood outside the door for a moment, staring at the motionless Kwon Chae-woo before slowly making his way inside. Lee-yeon stiffened as she watched him, her guard up.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be like this, Chae-woo.”</p>
<p>However, Kwon Ki-seok simply stood by the bed, looking like he was lost in thought. He opened his arms, grasped the bed’s railing, and lowered his head.</p>
<p>He pulled at his tie as if feeling a bit uneasy. Kwon Ki-seok’s expression was complex, making it difficult for Lee-yeon to interpret. He seemed quite displeased, gnawing at his lip as if jealous, and his face was stern, like scolding a misbehaving child.</p>
<p>“You’re losing your charm, brother.”</p>
<p>However, as all these complicated emotions intertwined, they couldn’t be neatly categorized under one name. Suddenly, Kwon Ki-seok’s gaze shifted to Lee-yeon. When their unfiltered, trembling eyes met, Lee-yeon’s insides felt queasy.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow is the Hyedom Memorial Ceremony. So Lee-yeon, you need to attend as my partner. I’ll send someone to assist you. Please follow the schedule without complaints.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon couldn’t help but think that a whole other level of complexity was about to be added to her life.</p>
<p>Seeing the man calmly discussing business while his younger brother nearly died in front of him filled Lee-yeon with a sense of disgust. His meticulously crafted face, as if carved from ice, seemed especially obnoxious today.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon remained silent, pursing her lips as she glared at him. In response, Kwon Ki-seok tilted his head slightly, shifting his gaze between her eyes and her stomach, adding unspoken pressure.</p>
<p>“If you need something in exchange for accompanying you as a partner,” he said, his lips strangely twitching upwards, “I’ll make sure you can run away from here.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“If you wish to make the expression that you desperately want to escape from here.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Is there a part of you that wants to be forever tied to a man raised in a place like this, in such circumstances?”</p>
<p>It was a dark whisper that stirred the fear in Lee-yeon’s core. At this moment, Kwon Ki-seok extended a poisoned chalice.</p>
<p>“Now, there’s not much time left until the agreed one-month period ends. I can provide you with safety and prosperity, ensuring you can live a good life together with the child. If So Lee-yeon wishes, I’ll make sure Chae-woo never finds out. For five years, ten years, or even longer…!”</p>
<p>His lips twitched upward unnaturally. His breathing grew heavier as his voice became shaky.</p>
<p>“…I can ensure you will never be able to find him.”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok clenched the bed frame again and hunched over as if struggling to catch his breath.</p>
<p>“You won’t see Chae-woo deteriorate, helpless and unable to use his hands—”</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, Kwon Chae-woo, who had been lying lifeless, suddenly grasped Lee-yeon’s wrist as if triggered by a reflex.</p>
<p>The vital signs remained stable, and his eyelids stayed motionless and serene. But Lee-yeon’s heart began to pound as if she were the one caught red-handed. “Don’t go. That’s what the man pleaded in her ear.</p>
<p>“Speak only. Whether you leave with no trace before Chae-woo awakens, well, that’s uncertain.”</p>
<p>“Why me, though…?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you? I wished Chae-woo could be more like me.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kwon Ki-seok’s gaze, buried deep inside, landed on Lee-yeon’s abdomen and then dropped away.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That night, Lee-yeon received a call from Choo-ja after a long time. As soon as she saw her name on the screen, warmth flooded her eyes. Lee-yeon bit her lower lip once and forced a smile, grateful that tears hadn’t come.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>-“Oh, is that you? Your voice sounds like you’re… not well.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that.” Lee-yeon tilted her head without knowing her unseen companion’s reaction.</p>
<p>Another ‘Aigo’…</p>
<p>*T/N: Aigo means “Oh dear!”</p>
<p>-“I urgently need to show you something.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>-“In the front yard, where we buried Mr. Kwon…”</p>
<p>Choo-ja hesitated as if struggling to get the words out.</p>
<p>“Why, what’s there?”</p>
<p>-“Something has… grown on his grave. I just sent a picture.”</p>
<p>A sigh came through the phone, and Lee-yeon’s face became serious as well. She immediately removed her phone from her ear and clicked on the message containing a picture.</p>
<p>The screen displayed the small mound where they had supposedly held Kwon Chae-woo’s funeral.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes shook uncontrollably.</p>
<p>-“Did we actually bury Mr. Kwon, or did we plant something?”</p>
<p>Sprouting on that grave, quite absurdly, was a delicate sapling.</p>
<p>-“Did the seed fall, or was it already hidden in the crevice from the beginning?”</p>
<p>A jolt of electricity seemed to rush through Lee-yeon as she gripped her phone.</p>
<p>-“Something… has… sprouted, Lee-yeon. “</p>
<p>He also suffered. He had been hurt and in pain because of me. But how could he…? How did he find the courage to choose me again?</p>
<p><em>Why didn’t you just hate me?</em></p>
<p><em>Why didn’t you just give up?</em></p>
<p>But just like trees, like trees that regenerate well, even if they cut and cut, they looked like thet didn’t hurt. They look so strong coming up through the grave.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon used her fingernail to gently trace the tender sprout visible through the screen.</p>
<p>She felt an inexplicable urge to cry.</p>
