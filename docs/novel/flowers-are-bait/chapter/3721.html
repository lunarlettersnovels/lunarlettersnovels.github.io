            <p><strong>Chapter 58</strong></p>
<p>“You are making a mistake! I was trying to help you!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo turned away from Hwang Jo-yoon. He struggled with all his might, struggling where he was bound to the tree.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to help you before you get trapped by a gold digger, damn it! Do you know what kind of b*tch So Lee-yeon is?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo walked to Lee-yeon and leaned down to her. He hugged her quietly. His hands wrapped around her and pulled her close. She didn’t push him away.</p>
<p>“She is from a completely broken family! And that’s because the same family members fell in love with each other and committed adultery —”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“You know?” asked Hwang Jo-yoon in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I’m her husband, of course I know everything about her. She told me.” Kwon Chae-woo dismissed Hwang Jo-yoon. He pulled Lee-yeon to him and hugged her. Lee-yeon could finally breathe a little properly. Hwang Jo-yoon tried to spread his venom again. But they ignored him as they walked in the garden away from him.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“The tree,” said Lee-yeon. “If leave him tied around it, the branches might break. It might harm the tree.”</p>
<p>He pressed his lips to her forehead. His heart ached for her. She was in pain but still she worried about her trees.</p>
<p>“The staff will find him soon enough and let him go,” said kwon Chae-woo. “But now is not the time for you to worry about trees, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I told you that I’m ruthless, didn’t I?” he said. “If you run away, then don’t get caught.” He went deeper into the garden with Lee-yeon. His headache disappeared like it had never been there in the first place.</p>
<p>“You!” Hwang Jo-yoon trebled as he saw the man appear in front of him. The same man he had met in the bar.</p>
<p>“I told you to live quietly.” The man was in a server’s costume as though he had just been serving guests in the party.</p>
<p>“Fuck Director Kwon,” shouted Hwang Jo-yoon. “You are all thugs! Every time you open your mouth, you threaten people. Do you think the stench of bullies can be covered so easily?”</p>
<p>“Who is So Lee-yeon’s husband?” asked Hwang Jo-yoon. “Is he a thug too? Does he kill people as well?”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee suddenly raised his head from his phone. He had been putting up a front like a veteran soldier but he had momentarily lost his composure.</p>
<p>“Young master is different from us.”</p>
<p>He pressed send on the phone. It read: <strong>Get the bucket ready.</strong></p>
<p>After a while, only a tie remained on the tree, swaying in the wind. The man was no longer seen.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” said Kwon Chae-woo. “I did explain very clearly to that bastard to not bother you again. But I didn’t expect him to appear in front of you again.”</p>
<p>The Venus Garden, the pride of Hwaido Grand Hotel, was mysterious and beautiful. Kwon Chae-woo led Lee-yeon towards the thicket of trees. Lee-yeon followed quietly. They sat down under the largest tree they could find.</p>
<p>“Did you… did you hear what Hwang Jo-yoon said about my family?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“My… family story.” She couldn’t look at him. However, kwon Chae-woo didn’t care about that. He wanted to tuck her hair behind her ear.</p>
<p>“We are a married couple,” he said. “Of course, I would have known, wouldn’t I? It’s just I forgot it with the rest of my past.”</p>
<p><em>So, you don’t know about it…. </em>It all felt absurd and strange to her. Just a while ago he was acting cranky because he didn’t know anything about her. Here he was now claiming he might know about everything just to comfort her.</p>
<p>“I… I didn’t tell you. Even before marriage,” she said. “I deceived you.”</p>
<p>A heavy silence fell between them. Lee-yeon dreaded what came next. She had confessed now. Even if it wasn’t the whole truth. She had deceived him. She was even deceiving him right now.</p>
<p>The Kwon Chae-woo burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was confused. She didn’t know what she had expected. Anger, maybe. But his laughter didn’t match the situation at all. She looked at him. Kwon Chae-woo leaned back on the tree with his hands behind his head. He looked so relaxed.</p>
<p>“Then why are you telling me now?” he asked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Are you implying that I am now more reliable and trustworthy than I was before?” He looked at her. “Is this a confession?”</p>
<p><em>How did it get interpreted that way? </em>He squinted his eyes in the sun and smiled at her. His eyes only looked at her, unwaveringly.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, if you do this suddenly, then I might get turned on. Just saying.”</p>
<p>“No… I… it’s not like that,” said Lee-yeon hurriedly. “I just meant that I led you on. You were led on by a woman with a complicated family history. Think of the situation a little!”</p>
<p>“I maybe an idiot so I don’t know about that,” he dabbed at his dry lips. “But if it is you, I think I like being led on.”</p>
