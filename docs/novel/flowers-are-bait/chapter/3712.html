            <p><strong>Chapter 67</strong></p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo was biting his lip, drawing blood in an attempt to not make any sound. He buried his face into Lee-yeon’s thigh and moaned.</p>
<p>“We’re just ordinary people!” Lee-yeon tried to plead to the drug dealers.</p>
<p>“Think about it,” the man with the sledgehammer said, “Is it more beneficial to us if we let you live or if we kill you?” Lee-yeon just stared at the men in fear.</p>
<p>“Dice up the man so we can bag him and take him to the boat for dumping.”</p>
<p>All the thugs advanced at once. They pulled Kwon Chae-woo away from Lee-yeon and started stomping on him and striking him with the steel pipes. Kwon-Chae-woo didn’t resist and just curled up in a fetus position to try and protect the vulnerable parts of his anatomy.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo!” Lee-yeon screamed as she strained against her bonds. “Stop! Please, stop!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo body was convulsing on the floor. He had a split on his brow that was pouring blood, and bruises were purpling on every inch of his exposed skin. Lee-yeon struggled harder, but there was nothing she could do.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Get up Kwon Chae-woo! Are you just going to let them beat you?” Lee-yeon cried, her voice trembling.</p>
<p>One of the drug dealers lifted a steel pipe, aiming for it to come crashing down on Kwon’s head. Lee-yeon tried to stand, while still attached to the chair, and ended up falling over.</p>
<p>“Please not the head! Don’t hit his head! If you need to hit him, hit anywhere else, just not the head!” Lee-yeon cried. The man stopped; the steel pipe held over his head.</p>
<p>“Please! His head is weak! If he gets hit in the head, it can be really bad! Please don’t do this!” Lee-yeon tried to crawl across the floor to her husband, dragging the chair she was attached to with her. The steel pipe started it’s swing downwards. “Kwon Chae-woo, move!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo suddenly rolled to the side. The steel pipe struck the empty floor. But the rest of the men did not stop pummeling him.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo, what are you doing!?” Lee-yeon shouted. “Why are you letting beat them beat you!? You’re not that person! Hit them, hit them! You’re capable of fighting back!”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t be doing that.” He moaned between strikes. “You don’t want me to become violent.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon could not believe what she was hearing. This situation was entirely different. “Are you really that stupid? They’re killing you! This is not the time to act all noble! F*cking kill them,” she shrieked.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s lips curved up in a smile of joy. She had finally come up to his level. His eyed cleared and he moaned in pleasure. Taking out a dagger he had hidden in his coat, he began slicing at the thugs, cutting tendons in their ankles and stabbing into the muscles of their calves.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo actions were fluid, and the men began falling like freshly harvested sugar cane. Lee-yeon flinched and closed her eyes. She could hear the sickening sounds as Kwon Chae-woo started smashing their skulls in by slamming their heads against the table.</p>
<p>When the sounds of suffering died down, Lee-yeon slowly opened her eyes. It was if the room had been hosed down with blood. It pooled on the floor, ran down the walls, and dripped from the ceiling. Lee-yeon fought the urge to vomit and shook her head, trying to remove the sight before her. Yet, if this situation ever occurred again, she would say the same thing to Kwon.</p>
<p>One dealer still stood in this drug farm on the beautiful island of Hwaido. They needed to get past him so they could reveal to the authorities this location. Maybe there were more drug dens on the other mountains. It was important that they found them all.</p>
<p>“What are you?” It was the man with the sledgehammer who still stood, his eyes wide in fear at the sight of the bloody mess that was Kwon. Kwon Chae-woo wiped the blade of his knife clean on his clothes and ignored the man’s question.</p>
<p>The drug dealer attempted one last attack in desperation. Kwon Chae-woo dodged the heavily swinging hammer and got within the man’s guard. Grasping the man’s arms, he flipped him to the ground. The man lay on the ground, moaning in pain. He picked up the hammer and swung it down on the man’s feet, just like what had been done to him. Then he raised the hammer again and smashed it down on the man’s hands, in retribution for touching Lee-yeon. This entire time, his face showed no emotion.</p>
<p>When the massacre had been completed, Kwon Chae-woo dug through the pockets of the bodies. He collected a number of cell phones. Then he made his way to Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“Are you all right?” he asked, as he sat her up and cut the ropes that held her.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Lee-yeon tried to control her fear, not only from the drug dealers that had tortured her, but from the man he had become just now. Kwon Chae-woo saw the terror in her eyes and he became saddened at what he put her through.</p>
