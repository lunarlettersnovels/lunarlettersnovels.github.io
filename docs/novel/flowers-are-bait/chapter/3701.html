            <p><strong>Chapter 78</strong></p>
<p>“What? No… I—”</p>
<p>“It seems you really want to get rid of me since you are now lying about our marriage.”</p>
<p>“Wait… I wasn’t! I can even prove it,” she said.</p>
<p>“Prove it then,” he said.</p>
<p>“I will get the family relationship certificate tomorrow and show it to you,” she said.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo sighed and took out a folded piece of paper from his coat pocket. He handed it to her and lifted his chin, gesturing for her to open it. His cold gaze remained unrelenting on her.</p>
<p>She opened the folded paper and looked at it. She froze as though she had been hit by a massive wave. She felt paralyzed.</p>
<p>The Family Relations Certificate showed So Lee-yeon as Kwon Chae-woo’s wife no matter how many times she read it. She was stunned. “What is this?!” <em>This must be forged, </em>she thought. <em>It has to be forged! How is this possible?</em></p>
<p>“You are really shameless, aren’t you? Lying outright to my face yet again.”</p>
<p>She remembered the man who was smoking a thick cigar. He had threatened her to make her life hell if she didn’t agree to him. Wouldn’t it be possible for him to do something like this and completely alter her life?</p>
<p>“So, that’s why you are meeting other men behind my back. You want to meet someone ‘kind and warm’ like you wanted and remarry?”</p>
<p>She was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to convince your dumbass of a husband, isn’t it?” He stared at Lee-yeon miserably. “You could have convinced me that we never signed a marriage license and then just run away.” He stroked her neck and grabbed it. “Lee-yeon, how is it that we aren’t married? How is it that I am not your husband? Tell me once again.” His harsh voice sounded dangerous.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon winced. “Don’t do anything stupid, Kwon Chae-woo,” she said, aware of his hand on her neck.</p>
<p>His eyes didn’t look human. Lee-yeon’s heart pounded. Her mouth was dry. His hot palm melted her wet body.</p>
<p>“Just because you have lied about that, I am not going to be a gentleman today,” he said. His hand lifted her wet blouse and brushed down her back. He unhooked her bra. The lips she couldn’t refuse came down on her lips again.</p>
<p>“How could you be so naïve?” he whispered. His lips crashed hard on hers and she flinched at his hot breath.</p>
<p>She felt cold and chilly, but a heat was rising in her. Her feelings were all mixed. Since she couldn’t push him away, she wrapped her arms around his back and pulled him to her. Kwon Chae-woo grunted as though no matter how much they touched; it wasn’t enough for him. His tongue was aggressive in her mouth. It poked and explored. His kiss was frantic… almost primal.</p>
<p>She held onto his shoulders as her knees trembled. She felt as though her legs would give in and she would fall any moment. Kwon Chae-woo lifted her up and she wrapped her legs around his waist. He carried her to her room. His lips never stopped. She felt breathless every time his lips sucked on hers.</p>
<p>He pulled away and placed her on the bed. He stared at her as he leaned over her. Their chests rose and fell frantically as they tried to catch their breaths.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo let out a swear and bit her lips again. His hot tongue skillfully explored her mouth. He ripped off her clothes. She gasped in surprise as the buttons rolled on the floor.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo—”</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon. Don’t. No more lies.” He fumbled with the buckle on her belt. His eyes were full of lust. She couldn’t tell whether his face was wet because of rainwater or sweat. “I don’t want to play this charade of being a husband and wife just on the surface. I want you for real.”</p>
<p>As her bra was already unhooked, her chest was bare. Kwon Chae-woo leaned down and took it in his mouth. He started sucking on them, making her tremble.</p>
<p>“Ahh,” she gasped. She felt heat rise somewhere below. She could feel his tongue on her chest crushing her tip. She tried to breathe.</p>
<p>She felt herself becoming wet somewhere down below. She had never felt this hot and flustered so she didn’t know what to do. She was out of breath. Kwon Chae-woo finally unbuckled her pants and pulled them down as he gently nibbled on the tip of her br*ast.</p>
<p>“Ahhh,” she moaned as he rubbed her most sensitive part. “Kwon Chae-woo…”</p>
<p>He pulled down her panties to her butt and spread her legs wide. He touched her more. He rubbed the cl*t between his fingers making her lose all sense of reality. He clenched his teeth as he felt the soft and sensitive wet part.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, mm!” she moaned. “Kwon Chae-woo, please promise me something.”</p>
<p>He shoved a finger within her without warning. She buckled and leaned over his shoulder, panting. “Never…ahh… get your memory back. Never. Mmm ahhhh!”</p>
<p>Her body fluid was already wet on his finger. This was the first time he had felt her insides. It was softer than he had imagined. He was aroused. His eyes filled with desire. He just wanted to shove his thing inside her without any regard, but he restrained himself. He was already hard. He looked into her eyes.</p>
<p>“Is that important to you in this situation?” he asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she sighed in pleasure.</p>
<p>“Would it be… easier for you to accept our relationship if I don’t get my memory back?” he asked.</p>
<p>She looked at him with shaky eyes. “Yes.”</p>
