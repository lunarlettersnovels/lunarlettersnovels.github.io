            <p><strong>Chapter 27</strong></p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo silently caressed her skin. Lee-yeon tried hard to ignore the feeling of his hand touching her back.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Use the washcloth over there.”</p>
<p>“It looks painful.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“If I use the washcloth, it might make your skin sore.”</p>
<p>“What? Then… what is the point of taking a bath?” Lee-yeon bent over and hid the bruises she got from branches and thorns. This was normal in the type of environment she worked in.</p>
<p>“Then let’s skip the bath today…”</p>
<p>“What the… are you kidding me?” Lee-yeon turned around and stared at him, furious. First, he wanted to bathe together even when she refused and now, he was saying this.</p>
<p>“I’ll just―” He paused for a moment. “I will do it my way.”</p>
<p>His warm palms touched her back. With his rough hands, he gently massaged her shoulders. Whenever he pressed the middle part of her back, she flinched. She was uncomfortable of the heat between his palms and her skin.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon bit her lips and held her breath. The air was humid and moist and warm. When the tip of his finger brushed under her breasts, she quickly covered them with her forearms. He rubbed his thumbs in circles along the spine down to her waist. Lee-yeon felt like melting into the hot water.</p>
<p>Feeling awkward and nervous, Lee-yeon fixed her eyes on the ceiling. <em>It’s because of the water. The water is hot and it feels like my face is burning.</em></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>After taking a shower together, she was less reluctant to lie on the same bed with him. The warm bath, however, had made her cozy and drowsy. She let out a weary sigh. “Goodnight, Kwon Chae-woo.”</p>
<p>He lifted the blanket, draped it on her and laid down beside her on the bed. The mattress suddenly felt too small to Lee-yeon. But she felt so comfortable that she slowly closed her eyes. <em>Today was such a long day, </em>she thought, <em>will everyday be like this? It’s the first time I spent the day together with him. Not everything was as I had wished for but… it wasn’t entirely bad…</em></p>
<p>“Are you sleepy already?”</p>
<p>“Yes…,” mumbled Lee-yeon, then she jerked up awake and sat upright.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” asked Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p><em>Why am I feeling this comfortable? </em>Lee-yeon panicked. <em>Did I just think the day wasn’t entirely bad? What is wrong with me?! The man tried to kill me, and I hit him with a saw! He might just kill me if he gets his memory back.</em></p>
<p>Lee-yeon made a fist and hit herself on the head. Kwon Chae-woo got up and grabbed her small fists. “What are you doing?” he asked.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon looked at him. <em>What the hell is this? Am I really this comfortable lying next to a murderer? Get a grip, Lee-yeon! Don’t forget about the slaughterhouse! How the hell can I sleep peacefully next to a murderer? </em>Lee-yeon’s face turned pale and she turned away.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon.” Kwon Chae-woo held her chin and turned her face to him. When their eyes met, Lee-yeon immediately closed hers, trying to brush off her thoughts.</p>
<p>“Open your eyes.” He said gently.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon didn’t open her eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why you’re acting like this. Why did you put your leg out on the floor?’</p>
<p>She had instinctively lowered her leg on the floor, ready to bolt. She wanted to turn her face away from him but he held on. She bit her lips in protest.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s face stiffened at her rejection. “Are you really not going to open your eyes? Are you not going to even look at me? You don’t even want to talk to me?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon didn’t respond to the man’s impatient voice.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, have you ever made someone go crazy?”</p>
<p>Just then, Kwon Chae-woo bit Lee-yeon’s neck lightly. Lee-yeon opened her eyes in surprise. A short scream escaped her mouth.</p>
<p>“The answer is probably no, because you are being too reckless.”</p>
<p>He buried his head in her neck, licked, and sucked her skin even harder. He was biting and scratching her like a person who had lost his mind. Her body odor was heady enough to seduce him.</p>
<p>“Ah…” Lee-yeon squirmed in his grip and groaned in pain. But it only made him more excited. His head went blank. He only wanted to quench his thirst and nothing else mattered to him anymore. He held her face with one hand, and the other one grabbed the back of her head. He wanted to have every part of her, even her blood.</p>
<p>“Ah!” cried Lee-yeon. Kwon Chae-woo pressed his teeth deeper into her soft skin. His thirst had been ignited since morning.</p>
<p>His drawers were slowly getting wet because of the prec*m exuded from the tip of his manhood. Just the act of licking her nape made him heated. <em>This is not enough, I want more, </em>he thought. Something deep inside him craved for more. Kwon Chae-woo wanted to devour her, body and soul.</p>
