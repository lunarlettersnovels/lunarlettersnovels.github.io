            <p><strong>Chapter 217</strong></p>
<p>As the two left, Lee-yeon scowled at Kwon Chae-woo again, her face flushed with anger. The mixture of embarrassment, irritation, and confusion caused an intense heat that covered her from head to toe.</p>
<p>In truth, everything was in chaos. Lee-yeon’s body kept leaning backward because Kwon Chae-woo trying to get closer to her somehow.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, please…”</p>
<p>“I’ve taken care of everything on your side, so now, just be quiet and sleep.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was not pleased, but she had surprised and angered the man enough by hitting his back in a show of frustration.</p>
<p>There was a hint of resignation in Lee-yeon’s eyes as she looked up at the ceiling as if she had given up.</p>
<p>“I know you’re pretending to be asleep right now.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Don’t pretend, just close your eyes comfortably.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon bit her lower lip, sighed heavily, and said, “Tonight, I’ll stay with you, so let’s let this go quietly.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“What’s with the ‘hmm’?”</p>
<p>As if scolding him, Lee-yeon lightly tapped the man’s broad back. When she did, Kwon Chae-woo groaned and shuddered as his body pressed against her neck.</p>
<p>Normally, he would have torn Lee-yeon away, bitten her, chewed her, or sucked on her neck forcefully, leaving a terrifying hickey. But it was clear that he was holding back, perhaps due to the rules that Lee-yeon had established.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, my body…”</p>
<p>A rigid part of him pressed against her, almost as if it were pushing her, but she made a conscious effort to ignore it.</p>
<p>“It’s perfectly normal, and I will not be affected by anything. Let’s stop this teasing.”</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>Though there was no physical discomfort, Kwon Chae-woo’s body felt scorching hot, as if he were suffering from a fever.</p>
<p>“If you want me just to sleep, I should get a goodnight kiss.”</p>
<p>“What—”</p>
<p>“Give me a kiss.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Since I can’t touch Lee-yeon, if she takes just one step closer—”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo lifted his head and stared directly at Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of everything myself.”</p>
<p>His drug-induced, hazy pupils seemed to engulf people like whirlpools. Some part of his body tingled with anticipation. However, Lee-yeon, gripping the rusty railing with both hands, pushed him away as if holding her ground.</p>
<p>“Lips should stay apart between us.”</p>
<p>“Then, what are you willing to allow? Hands, nails—”</p>
<p>At his cautious inquiry, Kwon Chae-woo’s forehead creased. With an adorable frown on his face, he leaned in towards Lee-yeon. His sharp nose and eyelashes brushed randomly against her delicate neck.</p>
<p>“Darn it, who’s asking you to suck <em>it</em>? I just want you to suck my lips.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon had to suppress a burst of laughter. The man who was pathetically begging with his pants noticeably bulging was both amusing and astonishing.</p>
<p>At the same time, she had to admit that she was drawn to Kwon Chae-woo, whether then or now. It wasn’t Jang Beom-hee, or the woman from a moment ago who could shake her. Only this sinister, prideless, and utterly shameless black-haired beast could fundamentally ensnare Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Is it that difficult?” Kwon Chae-woo confidently whispered, his voice low and somewhat intimidating in the night.</p>
<p>“As ugly as it may sound, my dignity is all but gone because of you. But my desire for you remains,” he added, his serious tone made Lee-yeon’s heart beat faster.</p>
<p>“Have you never thought about me at night? Dreamt of us together? Pleasured yourself while thinking of my touch?” he continued, each word causing Lee-yeon to shift her gaze away.</p>
<p>“I haven’t…,” she mumbled, avoiding his eyes, her cheeks flushing.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo appeared to want to say something but clenched his jaw, furrowing his eyebrows. Nevertheless, he couldn’t contain himself any longer and exhaled with apparent audacity, his trembling breath tormenting Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>As his muscles flexed and relaxed rhythmically, Lee-yeon suddenly recalled the advice from the dog trainer she met.</p>
<p>“At first, dogs are uncontrollable. Ignore these behaviors. If you don’t tame them at this point, taking care of them in everyday life becomes difficult.”</p>
<p>“…Play with them a lot. Balance neglect, encouragement, and rewards properly. Make sure they get used to your scent.”</p>
<p>With an awkward pat on his back, Lee-yeon uttered in a strange, detached tone, “Um, about my scent… You can smell it if you want.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, restless and persistent, abruptly stopped as if frozen in time. A strange and inexplicable silence fell over them, abruptly interrupting the moment.</p>
<p>“Only the scent,” she cautiously added.</p>
<p>Despite this minor concession, Kwon Chae-woo lunged at her as if he had just found a priceless treasure.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!” Lee-yeon exclaimed.</p>
<p>The issue was that he had devoured her ear in one bite, and his moist tongue traced the contours of her earlobe, drawing shapes and teasing the edges. The sound of saliva, sticky and tantalizing, stimulated Lee-yeon’s hearing in a seductive manner.</p>
<p>As a cold sensation, akin to ice, spread from her ear to her head, Lee-yeon pushed him away, hunching her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Wait, hold on, this is insane, you can’t…!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Kwon Chae-woo’s voice pierced through her eardrums.</p>
<p>“Easy now—don’t move. Before I bury my face between your legs.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was left stunned into silence.</p>
<p>“Or would you prefer that instead?”</p>
<p>The man’s warm breath continued to invade her moist ear canal.</p>
<p>“That’s right, Lee-yeon…”</p>
<p>Her mind was already in chaos, and the sensation of surrender overwhelmed her.</p>
<p>Before she could even think, her lips were claimed again. The sensual texture of their tongues and the hot breath intertwined, creating an intense, aggressive kiss.</p>
