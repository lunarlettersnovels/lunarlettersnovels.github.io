            <p><strong>Chapter 147</strong></p>
<p>Clink. Clink.</p>
<p>The silverware echoed through the silent dining room.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s gaze is fixed on Kwon Chae-woo, her attention so absorbed that she hardly notices as her food slips from her plate. The warm aroma of the meal fills the air as she removes her shoes, enveloping her in its comforting embrace.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo gestures towards the washroom, his movements measured and unhurried as he sets down the utensils.</p>
<p>Just as Lee-yeon prepares to demand an explanation for his behavior, she falters, the fire in her chest dissipating in the face of his tranquil demeanor.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you a foot rub a bit later.” Kwon Chae-woo picked up her food for her.</p>
<p>“W-why?” Lee-yeon asked while staring at the eggroll on her bowl.</p>
<p>“Your feet must hurt from walking all day.”</p>
<p>“That’s true but…” Kwon Chae-woo almost scoffed at her reaction.</p>
<p>“We even wrapped our thighs around each other, what’s wrong with feet?”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“Also I said I’ll rub it, not break it.”</p>
<p>That added explanation is even weirder…</p>
<p>Lee-yeon hardly smiled and bit the eggroll.</p>
<p>She feels the vibration of her phone and instinctively glances at the screen. A message from the head of her club lights up the screen. Mention of a gathering sends her mind racing. Suddenly, Kwon Chae-woo slams down his chopsticks, his voice cold.</p>
<p>“We’re having a meal right now.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon looks up at him, taken aback.</p>
<p>“But it’s after work hours. What do they want?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? I’m getting paid for this,” she retorts.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo tried to hide his frustration as Lee-yeon casually answered.</p>
<p>“So, just because of that you’re being distracted.”</p>
<p>“… What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“I caught this fish with my own two hands and cooked it just for you. So, pay attention to me.” Kwon Chae-woo’s voice is tinged with frustration as he grips the edge of the table, causing the dishes to tremble.</p>
<p>“What’s so special about money? I’m giving you all of me. My body.” He spoke.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon is taken aback by his words. Kwon Chae-woo continues, his voice rising,</p>
<p><em>‘I can give you that money, I own the mountain behind your place. Half of the mountains in Hwaido are mine!’</em> He almost said this but bit back the rest of his outburst and wallowing a gulp of water instead.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon set down her utensils, her expression growing serious.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘just money’? You are talking too much for someone just starting out in their career.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo said nothing, but his frown deepened as he pressed a hand to his chest.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon continued, her voice stern, “Our store would close down if you don’t take money seriously.”</p>
<p>Her words stung and Kwon Chae-woo felt a surge of anger. He imagined making her kneel before him, making her suffer even more than his mother did.</p>
<p>But he held his tongue, swallowing his emotions and forcing himself to stay calm.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was tapping on the table even during all this and kept scolding.</p>
<p>“I think you’re forgetting that you came here with nothing. This house, car, electronics, everything is mine. Even the interest on our debt I’m paying all on my own! Who is complaining now? …. Ah, except for second floor.”</p>
<p>She added quietly.</p>
<p>“As couple, we have to work towards the same goal.”</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, you’ve changed.”</p>
<p>She flinched as his dark eyes looked at her.</p>
<p>“H-how did I change? That’s what I should be…!”</p>
<p>“You said let’s only look at things that are beautiful and good.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“You were worried that I would fly away. You liked me so much that you wanted to hide me. You said that only you can see something this good and that you wouldn’t even let me leave the house. How could you change so much?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo couldn’t help feeling annoyed at the stark difference in how she was treating the two of him—the old, foolish Kwon Chae-woo and the one that got back his memories.</p>
<p>Despite hearing her words himself, he couldn’t ignore the fact that discrimination was wrong.</p>
<p>“You’re distracted while we eat, so are you going to be same while we have sex?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Do it, I’m curious what will happen.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes shook. She was examining his face either because she couldn’t say anything because of his point or that he remembers all the conversation they had.</p>
<p>“A child is a child. Pathetic how they think they can use money for you.”</p>
<p>His lips twisted.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother with dongsaengs*. What would you even do with dick that’s not—”</p>
<p><strong>*Dongsaeng – younger ones</strong></p>
<p>That moment, Kwon Chae-woo shut his mouth. His face suddenly turned dark and changed.</p>
<p>“… What’s wrong?” As she carefully asked, the man chugged water and avoided her.</p>
<p>“… I’m—”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo was also four years younger than So Lee-yeon so he was also a dongsaeng.</p>
<p>He thought he f*cked up.</p>
<p>“I was a bit rash.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“…. A little monkey smells good apparently.”</p>
<p>He felt dirty for some reason. He lost his appetite and didn’t eat.</p>
