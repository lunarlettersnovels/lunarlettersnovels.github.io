            <p><strong>Chapter 222</strong></p>
<p>Concerned that Pakistan might escalate the issue, he thought it best to give away the flesh since they were already at it, going so far as to give away the bones.</p>
<p>“We should have more than enough to pay for the ambassador’s wife’s life.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The cold determination echoed in his ears once again. However, as Kwon Chae-woo waited for Kwon Hee-joon’s orders, the guard dogs, silenced by the command, stood still. Kwon Ki-seok immediately issued new instructions in another language.</p>
<p>“Shoot any staff on sight.”</p>
<p>“حسنا (Understood.)”</p>
<p>“Roger that.”</p>
<p>The one who responded to the order with this back-and-forth was not the guard dogs. A sly smile played on Kwon Chae-woo’s lips. It was finally the moment when Kwon Ki-seok’s new pawn was revealed.</p>
<p>Following the advice of his second brother to think a few steps ahead, Kwon Chae-woo had secretly been waiting for this moment. Kwon Hee-joon’s game was already over. So, Kwon Chae-woo’s goal was now to eliminate the notorious mercenaries in the front yard of the Kwon residence all at once.</p>
<p>He increased his speed, and after deploying the sniper to the designated location, he quickly reversed. Strangely, his heart was pounding. Even if the time to carry out the killings was fast, it was still too soon. But Miss Lee-yeon would be safely inside.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo suppressed his anxious thoughts and turned the steering wheel sharply. He retrieved the automatic rifle and magazines from under the seat and loaded the silencer.</p>
<p>Then, he issued a direct order to the guard dogs that were crouched down. His expression was as ruthless as it could get.</p>
<p>“Don’t leave a single one alive.”</p>
<p>“Run…! Get out of the way!”</p>
<p>“Argh! Move…! Get out of the way!”</p>
<p>Amidst the chaotic cacophony of people of all ages and genders, gunshots punctuated the scene. The once lush and pristine lawn erupted with dirt and debris.</p>
<p>The grand garden transformed into a mere battlefield within moments. After the security guards had escorted the Future Society ladies away, this place had briefly settled into a quiet state, but gunshots resounded once more.</p>
<p><strong>Bang, bang, bang, bang…!</strong></p>
<p>The smell of ammunition, an unfamiliar odor, overwhelmed their senses. People rushed to find cover in the vast garden, now their only refuge.</p>
<p>Even the frozen Lee-yeon was jostled and bumped into the fleeing crowd repeatedly before she could regain her composure. The constant barrage of gunshots had made her ears ring.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>It was chaos. Some people were yelling urgently for everyone to get inside the mansion, but it seemed too far away. Her throat stung from the labored breath she had been holding.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Then, the people ahead of her started collapsing like toppled corn stalks. Their crumpled backs slumped, and their once vibrant bodies sagged.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah…!”</p>
<p>Her dilated pupils stiffened in shock. Lee-yeon couldn’t fathom making it through this horrifying garden where everyone was being mercilessly shot down. A choked sob escaped her lips.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos, something like a mirror glinted in the air. Without thinking, Lee-yeon instinctively lowered her body, shielding her head. She crawled awkwardly inside the shattered table, seeking refuge.</p>
<p>Her heart pounded as if it would explode any moment.</p>
<p>She tasted the metallic tang of blood beyond her parched throat. Step by step, someone with crimson-soaked shoes walked closer.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon held her breath, the pace of her racing heart matching her desperate, silent plea.</p>
<p>It was in that very moment when the cold muzzle of a loaded gun, like a looming shadow, reached towards her.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon!”</p>
<p><strong>Screech! </strong>The ear-piercing sound of the brakes brought everyone to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>“Stop here!”</p>
<p>At the sound of the familiar voice, Lee-yeon’s head shot up. Tears that had been welling up in her eyes spilled over.</p>
<p>“Ugh… Ugh…”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. It’s okay, come here!”</p>
<p>Though Kwon Chae-woo tried to reassure her, his face contorted with worry as he reached his hand out through the car window.</p>
<p>However, Lee-yeon’s legs wouldn’t cooperate. When she finally managed to stand, Kwon Chae-woo leaped out like a bolt, tossing two smoke grenades across to the opposite side.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the relentless hail of bullets shattered the car’s windows and left the seats in tatters. Fortunately, the quickly rising smoke concealed their view.</p>
<p>“Damm*t, I can’t leave you here any longer. Wherever I send you, you know what to do.”</p>
<p>As Kwon Chae-woo embraced Lee-yeon and prepared to carry her, he staggered suddenly. An ominous vibration spread from the point of impact.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Inquisitive, Lee-yeon looked at him, but Kwon Chae-woo remained expressionless.</p>
<p>“Report.”</p>
<p>“Eight out of ten targets have been eliminated.”</p>
<p>“And the remaining two?”</p>
<p>“One is in sector B-1 at 9 o’clock direction, the other is heading from the main building at 1 o’clock.”</p>
<p>“You handle B-1, and then both of you evacuate immediately. Wait at the safehouses.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, an already terrified servant took the initiative, jumped into the driver’s seat, and started the car. Kwon Chae-woo cursed under his breath, but the car, swerving dangerously, didn’t stop.</p>
<p>However, it was short-lived. The relentless hail of bullets began to take its toll, causing the tires to deflate and shattering the front windshield. The unrelenting gunfire showed no sign of stopping, as blood trickled through the cracks.</p>
<p>“Lower your head.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo gently pushed Lee-yeon back into the cover of the table and exposed his back to shield her. His bloodied hand pushed Lee-yeon’s head down.</p>
<p>“Never again, Lee-yeon, will I let you get hurt.”</p>
