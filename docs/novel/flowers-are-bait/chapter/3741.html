            <p><strong>Chapter 38</strong></p>
<p>“Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s hand lifted Lee-yeon’s face. His warm palm gently melted her frozen cheeks.</p>
<p>“The tournament has begun.”</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>His voice woke up Lee-yeon, who was lost in thoughts. She bit the tip of her tongue at the sudden warmth. Just then, someone shouted.</p>
<p>“We will start with the Green Tree Hospital!”.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon clasped her hands and stretched out her arms.</p>
<p><em>‘Thinking about an unanswerable question right now doesn’t help at all.’</em></p>
<p>Soon, the camera started recording.</p>
<p>The director of Green Hospital and a staff member tied a rope around their waist. After finishing the preparations, they quickly grabbed the saw for pruning and began climbing the tree.</p>
<p>Seeing him climbing the tree without hesitation, Lee-yeon clenched her fists.</p>
<p>Just then, she heard a sigh behind her.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand this situation. Are you telling me you’re going to do that?” Kwon Chae-woo was standing there with his face distorted by anger and confusion.</p>
<p>Since she had never told Kwon Chae-woo about the details of the tournament, it must have taken some time for him to figure out what was going on. Lee-yeon shrugged her shoulders, shading her eyes with her hands.</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid of heights.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo looked up at the crooked tree and appeared unimpressed, “That’s not the problem. It’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I still have to do it. I’m good at climbing trees like a monkey.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s frown deepened, swallowing the stinging words that almost came out from his mouth like a fire. <em>‘Good at climbing trees? But your face is growing pale.’</em></p>
<p>Although it was clear that she was tense, Lee-yeon pretended like she was not afraid of anything.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A few minutes later.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a commotion from above. Then she saw the director of Green Hospital coming down without even getting closer to the branch. As soon as his feet landed on the ground, the director shook his head firmly and burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Do they want us to die or something…?”</p>
<p>He muttered to himself and turned to Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“You should think twice before doing this, Director So. The branches are more curved than I thought. I couldn’t even climb on them, afraid that they would snap.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon held her breath. Choo-ja, who was standing right next to her, tried to convince her to give up. “Lee-yeon, wouldn’t it be better for us to withdraw from this test?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“What if something happens? Even if you won’t win the monetary reward, at least you are safe. Let’s just withdraw—”</p>
<p>“Then our hospital will be eliminated immediately.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes looked very determined. Choo-ja snorted at her. “Didn’t you say that you didn’t want to be in front of the cameras?”</p>
<p>“…But I’m sure this is something I can do well.” Lee-yeon muttered as she turned her head away.</p>
<p>“Do you really want to take a risk like this? If you treat the clients more friendly, they’ll keep coming to our hospital one after another!” Choo-ja’s accusing voice was enough to make the bystanders look their way.</p>
<p>“That sounds very unlikely…”</p>
<p>To her syurprise, Choo-ja sneakily winked at Lee-yeon and glanced at Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon could immediately tell what her wink meant and dropped her head in embarrassment. It was to appease Kwon Chae-woo, insinuating that Lee-yeon doesn’t entertain men other than him.</p>
<p><em>‘You can do this, Lee-yeon. You even fought Kwon Chae-woo with a saw in the mountain and won, so this is a piece of cake.’</em></p>
<p>“Are you ready, Spruce Tree Hospital?” The manager who was taking notes on the tablet called Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo stopped her and snatched the rope she was holding over her head.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, it’s not too late yet.”</p>
<p>“Give it back!” She stood on tiptoe and stretched out her arms.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it to you if you go home with me.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding with me right now?”</p>
<p>“I wish I was. Why are you being so reckless?”</p>
<p>Looking at him, Lee-yeon was suddenly lost for words. She had never seen Kwon Chae-woo looked so worried.</p>
<p>“…Yes, I’m scared, but responsibility comes before that. This is a competitive bid, and I’m willing to participate. So, give me the rope.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“You said you’ll do whatever I tell you to do.”</p>
<p>When Kwon Chae-woo still kept his mouth shut, Lee-yeon asked, placing her hand on her waist without realizing it.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo, are you trying to argue with me right now?”</p>
<p><em>‘Ah, I didn’t mean to say something childish like this….’ </em>Lee-yeon wanted to take back her words, but it was already too late. The moment Kwon Chae-woo’s eyes narrowed, her heart beat faster, and her hands immediately became sweaty.</p>
<p>He stared at Lee-yeon but soon lowered his gaze. “No, Lee-yeon. How can I ever do that?” It was hard to read his face, but his eyes looked darker than usual.</p>
<p>The obedient man tied the rope around Lee-yeon’s waist. Surprisingly, he hooked and knotted the rope step by step. Lee-yeon’s eyes widened at the skillful and quick movements of his hands.</p>
<p>Just then, a raspy voice brought her back from her reverie. “You don’t even think about your husband, do you?”</p>
<p>Every time he checked the joints, her body wobbled back and forth like paper. Kwon Chae-woo clenched his jaw so tight that she could hear the creak of bone. Lee-yeon held her breath.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to disturb you, I just wanted to protect you. And I wasn’t kidding, I really wanted you to comfort me.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Because I’m anxious.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon could only blink her eyes at the man’s voice.</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to go anywhere far.”</p>
<p>His cold eyes were boiling. “I made it clear that I don’t want to be apart from you, even a little.” His gaze contained no malice, no hate, no irrational satisfaction from anger. It was fundamentally different from what she saw from her family.</p>
<p>All she could see was the pure affection towards her. She suddenly felt her heart tickle.</p>
