            <p><strong>Chapter 245</strong></p>
<p>“The eldest son, who was obedient to our parents like a puppet, suddenly became strange. Of course, our parents tried to deal with Yoon Joo-ha quickly, but Kwon Ki-seok found out about it.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo descended into the basement, stepping on the hollow iron stairs.</p>
<p>“…I don’t know, though. I don’t know if Kwon Ki-seok changed ‘overnight.’ I couldn’t even guess when he started acting that way, even though I saw it right next to him.”</p>
<p>When Kwon Chae-woo entered the confined space without any windows, he couldn’t breathe. However, there is only a small dressing table and a bed. In a shabby place where that was all there was to it, Kwon Ki-seok took off his glasses and relaxed.</p>
<p>An old but pretty-looking ivory-colored dressing table. Liquor bottles and glasses were scattered all over it. And a white powder. Summer.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s gaze keenly scanned it all. Kwon Ki-seok was still dressed casually, adjusting his cufflinks and pretending to know.</p>
<p>“You’re late.”</p>
<p>He never spoke nonsense even after taking Summer. Kwon Chae-woo felt a strange sense of discomfort and gave strength to the twitching corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>“All I need is your thumb to stamp the inheritance papers.”</p>
<p>He muttered coldly and immediately slashed Kwon Ki-seok’s hand on the dressing table with a knife and poured out the bottle of alcohol.</p>
<p>The strong smell of alcohol assaulted his nose and filled the room. Kwon Ki-seok just slowly raised the corner of his mouth without any resistance.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo, you shouldn’t waste time.”</p>
<p>“I heard everything, what you said to Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>With eyes now hazy, Kwon Chae-woo pulled out another dagger from his waist. As if peeling an apple, he pressed the blade against Kwon Ki-seok’s thumb. It looked as if the finger would be severed at any moment.</p>
<p>“.…”</p>
<p>“How the fuck can you starve someone to death?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok’s eyebrows twitched at that.</p>
<p>The festering revenge, anger, self-reproach, and murderous intent were laced into the knife he was holding. With bloodshot eyes, Kwon Chae-woo began to sharpen his blade. Although his bones were pounding, he was persistent, like a seasoned butcher.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo kept at it, expressing frustration while not letting up on his harsh task. Kwon Ki-seok, reacting instinctively, tried to pull away, but his drugged body was flattened, and the grim work continued.</p>
<p>“Miss Lee-yeon, I bugged your work clothes.”</p>
<p>With each grimace on Kwon Chae-woo’s face while slicing through the flesh, the robust dressing table shook.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Crimson veins bulged on Kwon Ki-seok’s forehead, and blood trickled from the corners of his mouth as he bit his tongue to endure the pain.</p>
<p>“I deliberately chose a dull knife for you.”</p>
<p>“Uh, ugh…!”</p>
<p>Unable to move for the past few days due to gunshot wounds, Kwon Chae-woo spent his time checking Lee-yeon’s activities through the CCTV in the mansion. In the process, he accidentally overheard the conversation between the two.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this happened when he finally regained strength and gripped the cello, Kwon Ki-seok’s harsh words streamed in. He was dusting off the dust from the cello for Lee-yeon when he heard their conversation through his earpiece.</p>
<p>He felt as if his knees were breaking, and his head splitting at the revelation.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, he got up and went to her, as if offering himself as a sacrifice. Perhaps he thought of his mother who might have eagerly awaited the sound of his cello every day, carrying guilt and self-reproach.</p>
<p>The arrow that he relentlessly aimed at her turned back on him.</p>
<p>It was the most painful performance of his life.</p>
<p>“You won’t die peacefully, Kwon Ki-seok.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, with a rugged breath, inserted his thumb into the alcohol glass. Despite Kwon Ki-seok’s fingers being cut off without anesthesia and submerged to alcohol, he chuckled, intoxicated by the spectacle and drugged from Summer.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo grabbed his collar and continued to punch him until the small room became a mess.</p>
<p>“Ugh… if do this, you won’t meet Yoon Joo-ha.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo sneered and then regained his composure.</p>
<p>“Do you think I will send you to where Yoon Joo-ha is?”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok’s fixation was solely on Kwon Chae-woo’s suffering, not death. Even if the place Yoon Joo-ha was in meant death, Kwon Ki-seok wouldn’t allow it. They should never meet again.</p>
<p>“Teacher, it’s my turn now, right?” Kwon Ki-seok started to not make sense, Summer getting into him.</p>
<p>There was a moment of hesitation in Kwon Chae-woo at the unfamiliar tone coming from Kwon Ki-seok.</p>
<p>“The way you’ve been living will eventually harm <em>her</em>.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“You, the hunting dog, the Kwon family, will end up killing that woman. You will lose everything again.”</p>
<p>It was unclear whether it was a muttered soliloquy or not. Whether ‘that woman’ referred to Yoon Joo-ha or someone else—</p>
<p>With a stern expression, Kwon Chae-woo stared into the dilated pupils of his relaxed opponent.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo, I won.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo suddenly felt a chill in his neck and gestured to open a tank. He had no patience left to listen to Kwon Ki-seok’s nonsense.</p>
<p>With starving someone to death, he wanted to let Kwon Ki-seok experience it himself, driven mad by starvation. If Kwon Ki-seok had the will to live, he would escape, and if not, he would do nothing to save himself and rot.</p>
<p>Despite living with the highest position, in the end, all that remained of the man was an empty shell. Power, fame, and desire meant nothing to Kwon Ki-seok. It was only the intense jealousy, like a finger that had already melted into a lump, that he couldn’t let go.</p>
<p>Pitiful… ruthless.</p>
