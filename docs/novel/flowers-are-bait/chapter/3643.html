            <p><strong>Chapter 138</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon bit her lip as she braced herself for the force with which Kwon Chae-woo was rutting against her. She felt completely full as he thrust into her.</p>
<p>He chuckled as she made a face at the feeling. “Lee-yeon, come on, loosen up for me.”</p>
<p>When he pulled out a little, she let out a sigh of relief. Kwon Chae-woo slid arm behind her neck and allowed himself a moment to feel her soft skin. Compared to how he usually was, he was being quite tender. Still, Lee-yeon couldn’t help but feel like she was being shackled to him causing her to tense up.</p>
<p>“Right,” Kwon Chae-woo grunted. “You really don’t listen to me.” And, with that, he bottomed out into her. “I’ve always been the one who’s listened to you. You’ve practically enslaved me.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon threw her head back in pleasure, hitting the bathroom wall, as Kwon Chae-woo put his leg beneath her ass and grabbed her hip. He could feel her slowly drifting away, unable to hear what he was saying. He rocked her body back and forth as her breath began to quicken, thrusting in and out with each movement.</p>
<p>He reached behind her back, and, with a swift touch, he unhooked her bra and took hold of one of her breasts. The flesh was supple in his grasp as he fondled it and flicked her nipple with his thumb.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon shut her eyes as she tried to hold herself together. She wasn’t exactly feeling like herself at that moment. “Chae-woo,” she rasped. “I don’t like this—”</p>
<p>“You don’t like it?”</p>
<p>He thrust into her at that moment, and she couldn’t help but moan.</p>
<p>“You don’t like having sex?” he pressed. He moved against her sharply as he spoke. “Would you like it if it wasn’t me doing it to you?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon tried to answer but her breath was caught in her throat. The way he was ramming into her was suffocating.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo tutted. “My wife can’t even answer such a simple question,” he said. “I must be fucking you really good.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t even scream, too wrapped up in her own pleasure to muster a sound. It seemed like he was on a rampage and she was the carnage that he planned to leave behind. With each thrust, his grip on her neck seemed to tighten.</p>
<p>“Don’t go all soft on me now,” he told her. “You are the bold So Lee-yeon, right?” His breath was hot against her neck. “Turn your head.”</p>
<p>Weakly, Lee-yeon did as she was told. Suddenly, a set of teeth closed in on her bottom lip and a tongue slid into her mouth forcefully. He was pressing his tongue against hers, pushing in until she couldn’t seem to breathe anymore.</p>
<p>Then, he reached down and rubbed at her clit, sending shockwaves through her body at the sudden feeling. It was like her entire body was on fire and she felt her legs begin to shake.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon tried to push Kwon Chae-woo away, too overwhelmed by the feeling, but his hand wouldn’t budge. He was set on rubbing his thumb against her heat and he was merciless in his attack. It was like her body was being ripped in half, like she was being pulled in two different directions all at once. Behind her, Kwon Chae-woo moaned lowly as he squeezed her breast and sucked on her tongue. The point where their bodies collided was sopping wet from Lee-yeon’s slick.</p>
<p>“I can taste blood in your mouth, Lee-yeon.” He frowned against her lips. “It seems like I’ve sucked too hard.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t respond. Her pleasure was reaching its usual peak, but it felt different this time. The knot in her stomach seemed so much tighter and her feelings seemed so much more out of sorts.</p>
<p>“I don’t care,” Kwon Chae-woo continued. “Your sweat, your blood, your juice… I can never have enough of you.” His thrusts were getting stronger and they were beginning to hurt from all the impact and the pressure. He nibbled on ear, his lips traveling down her neck all the way to her cheek. His grip on her was tight as he continued to move.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Lee-yeon cried. “I feel weird!”</p>
<p>But all he did was chuckle. “You’re not the only one,” he said. “I’m sure I feel way worse.”</p>
<p><em>“Kwon Chae-woo, promise me one thing.”</em></p>
<p>The moment seemed so far away, but he could hear the voice clearly in the back of his mind. Kwon Chae-woo felt his heart stop in his chest.</p>
<p><em>“Never find your memory. Ever.”</em></p>
<p>He shook his head at the memory and frowned. He pulled his thoughts away from it and focused on holding Lee-yeon’s waist. It bothered him to know that his heart was beating because of something completely unrelated to sex so he tried to refocus on the task at hand. He thrust into her sharply, as if by instinct.</p>
<p><em>“Even if I go back to who I was, why would anything between us change? I’m so hung up on you, Lee-yeon. What are you afraid of?”</em></p>
<p>It was his voice that he could hear in the back of his head, but it wasn’t really him. His emotions began to take over him and he bit his bottom lip and shook his head to clear the thought away.</p>
<p>“I don’t need it,” he said mindlessly.</p>
