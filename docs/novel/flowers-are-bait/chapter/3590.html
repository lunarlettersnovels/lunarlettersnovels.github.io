            <p><strong>Chapter 193</strong></p>
<p>“… Director! He’s here!”</p>
<p>She was thinking about this unexpected morning when someone interrupted her thought. It was one of the members of the garden team.</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok got off the black sedan, and Kwon Chae-woo got off the bike.</p>
<p>He was wearing a leather jacket and brushed off his wet hair.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was uncomfortable seeing him in the daylight, but she stood up straight. Today was an important day to show the completed garden for the first time.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon nodded to Kwon Ki-seok and led them through.</p>
<p>“The flower words for camellia is secretive love.”</p>
<p>The red camellia tree was lined up like a welcoming crew. She intentionally dropped the red petals at the bottom of the trees to make it look fancier. It was the beginning of the enjoyment.</p>
<p>A wide garden opened as they exited a small camellia tree forest.</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok looked around, but Kwon Chae-woo’s attention was only to one person. She felt his stare, but she tried her best to ignore it and only focused on her employer’s reaction.</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok looked around and then smiled mysteriously.</p>
<p>“It feels odd. Quite explicit too.”</p>
<p>“That is a boulder looking like… penis.” Lee-yeon couldn’t help but comment.</p>
<p>“Yes, it looks like that.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t like she wanted a response, but she blushed.</p>
<p>“That’s a penis tree that we got from Yeosu. As you can see… It looks the same.”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok looked interested.</p>
<p>“That’s a silver magnolia that grows on the island, and it’s shaped like that sometimes as its bark is clean. Hm, I searched hard.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon didn’t forget to appeal herself.</p>
<p>The silver magnolia that is nicknamed the penis tree looked like a man’s two legs and penis. It was a big beautiful tree, so it was most noticeable.</p>
<p>“There was a hugging tree and the evergreen that looked like it’s having sex.”</p>
<p>“So Lee-yeon, are you unwell?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Your neck is so red.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Hope you won’t faint explaining all this.”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok whispered as he passed Lee-yeon. Lee-yeon scratched her ear, and Kwon Chae-woo glared at her like he wanted to scrape something off her collarbones.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon flinched but never looked at him. She just continued to explain on.</p>
<p>“This is a rattan. Its flower word is welcome.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon opened the rattan’s flower like a curtain.</p>
<p>“And this is a pin oak that’s good at absorbing noise. It acts like a divider.”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok scoffed.</p>
<p>“So Lee-yeon, you’re very proactive.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Never mind. Continue.”</p>
<p>“… This is a chestnut tree.”</p>
<p>They were standing in front of a white chestnut tree.</p>
<p>“Yes, I was wondering the smell of cum was coming from.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon flinched as he said words that didn’t suit him. She continued to make excuses, wondering if it was her client’s first complaint.</p>
<p>“Uh… It doesn’t seem that bad…”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok looked at her.</p>
<p>“Did you smell it?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“You sounded like you knew well.”</p>
<p>“Well, no…”</p>
<p>“I was asking because your standard was a bit odd.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon glanced at Kwon Chae-woo out of embarrassment. Kwon Chae-woo locked his hands behind his hand and frowned. He looked annoyed about this meeting, unlike Kwon Ki-seok.</p>
<p>“… I planted while calculating it all. I thought it was ok.”</p>
<p>“Is that a reasonable standard?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t say anything. Standard? Standard…</p>
<p>She looked around again. When her eyes met Kwon Chae-woo’s, his eyebrow raised. Lee-yeon quickly looked down.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I chose it using my own judgment, but if you want me to change it—”</p>
<p>“Ki-seok, why are you acting like this to a tree doctor?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo spoke at that moment.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon’s standard is so young that that can’t even be considered bad smelling.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s tried her best to keep her mouth shut.</p>
<p>“You’re also too old.” Kwon Chae-woo retaliated.</p>
<p>There was a silence that she couldn’t break. Lee-yeon blinked fast and tried her best to move. She felt the heat on her forehead as well.</p>
<p>Even so, she pointed like she didn’t hear anything. She stopped in front of every single flower.</p>
<p>“Snapdragon’s flower word is greed. Solanum Japanese is ‘I can’t hold back’…”</p>
<p>She introduced a couple more flowers after too. The flowers were all blossoming nicely, and their light color made the atmosphere thicker. All the flowers she picked were all wild.</p>
<p>“The flower shaped…”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok looked down. Kwon Chae-woo kicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“Flowers are also genital.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon flinched as she walked in front of them.</p>
<p><em>‘Lee-yeon, I heard that flowers were genitals, then won’t need another flower.”</em></p>
<p>The Kwon Chae-woo of that day pulled Lee-yeon and put her on top of his face. He grabbed her butt while putting his tongue into her.</p>
<p>She felt like she was being crushed, and something was being poured out of her. The thought of that suddenly hit her.</p>
<p>‘W, what’s going on…’</p>
<p>The Kwon Chae-woo, in her memory, pulled down his pants and underwear and took out his penis. He grabbed her legs, spread them, and put the head of his penis on her.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon shook her head and tapped on her cheeks. Her ears flared up.</p>
<p>“This is called mountain halibut, and the uniqueness is that its penis, no, petals—“</p>
<p>She didn’t even know what she was babbling. She wished this would end quickly.</p>
<p>“The last flower is flower poppy.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon mumbled.</p>
<p>“Unlike normal poppy, this doesn’t have any drugs. But the poppy that has drug… You shouldn’t farm it, no matter what the reason is. If you do and get caught, it’s less than five years or 50 million won or less fine…”</p>
<p>Someone scoffed as they seemed to find it funny. She remembered that they usually make the rules rather than follow them.</p>
<p>Even so, Lee-yeon didn’t want to forget her normal life. It felt like it was going to faint.</p>
<p>“You’re more so than….”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok looked at Lee-yeon oddly. He stopped talking like he was thinking about something then started talking again.</p>
<p>“So Lee-yeon, would you like to attend the party tonight?”</p>
<p>“… Pardon?’</p>
<p>“You become curious about the chef when you eat something delicious. They’re all well-endowed about galleries and exhibitions, so they might want to hear your explanation.”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon couldn’t answer his sudden request, Kwon Chae-woo pushed down on his brother’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“Don’t act so high and mighty. They’re only after our connection. She doesn’t need to come.”</p>
<p>And his sharp glare came to her like a warning.</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about it.”</p>
<p>That night, the guests started to arrive.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Try this!”</p>
<p>The youngest of the administrative team brought a handful of chickens, and all those working came.</p>
<p>Even she started to move after sitting on the chair blankly. Lee-yeon was yawning, yet she was still trying the chicken.</p>
<p>Even though she was eating chicken, she felt like something was lacking. Thankfully morning sickness seemed to be not her problem, but this wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>‘This isn’t it… I just want…!”</p>
<p>She suddenly remembered what she wanted as she salivated.</p>
<p>What Lee-yeon wanted was a simple home-cooked meal.</p>
<p>Warm rice and a normal side dish.</p>
<p>But the problem was that, like how pregnant women want their late mom’s cooking, she wanted her dead husband’s cooking. She was disappointed as it seemed impossible.</p>
<p>She was chewing chicken automatically while thinking about a normal home-cooked breakfast on the side.</p>
<p>There was a sound from the radio.</p>
<p>“Director, Director So Lee-yeon–!”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>One of the members handed her the radio.</p>
<p>“The security wants something removed from the garden?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“They say something is wrong with one of the trees and wanted it fixed…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon quickly swallowed her food and took the radio.</p>
<p>“It’s So Lee-yeon. What’s the problem with the tree?”</p>
