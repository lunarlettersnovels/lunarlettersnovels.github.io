            <p><strong>Chapter 156</strong></p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo blinked his bloodshot eyes a few times and then finally was able to focus.</p>
<p>He grabbed a broom and came out. “Tonight is the night of your competition. Eat well.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo brushed the floor like nothing happened.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo, you said you’re coming tonight right?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stared at the man with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>“I’ll go ahead and get ready so you have to come after you finish your meal.”</p>
<p>Tonight was the 4th competition.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon kept everything a secret.</p>
<p>She wanted to give Kwon Chae-woo the music that ring through the forest, the memory that was contained within like a gift. She wanted to unravel this misunderstanding from the forest she worked so hard on.</p>
<p><em>“Ah, a spoil?”</em></p>
<p>It seemed like somewhere in Lee-yeon’s memory, that sarcastic remark was hitting her. But she couldn’t say anything as the man looked sensitive and tired for the week.</p>
<p>Then the event from 15 years ago came into her dream. That moment, that guest. She never had a dream like that before….</p>
<p>Her last shout especially was complete imagination but Lee-yeon arm hurt like it was actually grabbed by her.</p>
<p>“It might be the last time so I have to go see.”</p>
<p>“Last time…! I’m going until the end!”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>As he smiled oddly, Lee-yeon also smiled childishly.</p>
<p>There was a rehearsal with an orchestra that was hard for her to book from another region this morning.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>But the more she chewed, the more her face became dark and stern, and her chewing slowed.</p>
<p>Eventually, she realized that the seasoning on all of the side dishes had been poorly done. One bite of a particularly salty dish made her almost frown, but she managed to swallow it down with a gulp of water.</p>
<p>The next dish was far too sweet, and it was clear that Chae-woo had confused salt and sugar in his cooking.</p>
<p>Well, humans make mistake.</p>
<p>Despite the seasoning mishap, Lee-yeon continued to eat and pretended to be impressed with Chae-woo’s cooking, not wanting to hurt his feelings or make him feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>She knew that it wasn’t easy to cook for someone else, and appreciated the effort that he had put into making the meal for her.</p>
<p>But as she ate, she couldn’t help but feel distracted by everything that had happened recently – the bad dream she had last night, and now the poorly seasoned food.</p>
<p>She was so preoccupied with her own thoughts that she didn’t even notice Chae-woo struggling to use his chopsticks in front of her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A dead black forest.</p>
<p>But the orchestra in their white dress shirt was shining like magnolia denudate.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the mountain, The D hospital had a wall up to hide their area completely, but Lee-yeon wasn’t even slightly curious. She was already occupied by the orchestra that was tuning.</p>
<p>Each time the sound travelled through the clear air, her heart trembled like she was little.</p>
<p>She quickly checked her watch and called Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>Before the competition starts, so before crowd comes, she wanted him to be the first audience. Lee-yeon was waiting anxiously and then smiled as he picked up.</p>
<p>“Hello? Chae-woo, are you coming? Where are you?”</p>
<p>-….</p>
<p>But there was no response. The orchestra’s uncoordinated sound came in.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon checked the phone but the phone time was still going.</p>
<p>“Hello? Kwon Chae-woo, can you hear me?”</p>
<p>-…..</p>
<p>Still silent. The moment Lee-yeon covered her ear and turned, she could hear odd laughing over the phone. It started to become like crying.</p>
<p>“…. It’s unforgettable gift, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon flinched at such low tone.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo was walking in. His face was so blue as there was no sense of blood in it.</p>
<p>He was also wearing something Lee-yeon hasn’t seen before, which was black suit and dress shirt with some of his buttons undone.</p>
<p>“…. Chae-woo?”</p>
<p>-Since I got a gift, I’ll have to give you something back.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s heart sank as his eyes seemed abnormal.</p>
<p>Her instinct was correct.</p>
<p>-It’s a perfect finale.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo slowly stopped smiling and mumbled coldly.</p>
<p>The man walked past Lee-yeon and went to the orchestra. His eyes looked hazy from lack of sleep, but his steps were determined. The orchestra stopped tuning as the man interrupted them.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo took someone’s cello and lifted it high up in the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the orchestra members stood up and began screaming before fleeing the scene. Kwon Chae-woo repeatedly slammed the cello down onto an empty chair.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon couldn’t even breathe and covered her mouth in shock. Her heart pounded like a warning sign. Instead of the beautiful harmonies she had been expecting, the sound of the broken cello filled the room.</p>
<p>The wooden pieces flew everywhere, and the strings made a painful noise. The cello was being completely destroyed before her eyes.</p>
<p>“Chae, Chae-woo, what are you…”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo hit the long neck of cello until it was completely broken into two and then kept stomping on it.</p>
<p>Pale trembling lips. Vein popping in his hands. And the hair that was covering his brown eyes. Everything made him look like not Kwon Chae-woo but someone else.</p>
<p>He calmed his breathing while looking at broken cello. In the middle of quiet forest, nothing was worse.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo tidied up his hair with his trembling hand and stumbled towards the frozen woman.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me like a monster? Were you scared?”</p>
<p>He caressed Lee-yeon’s cheek. She trembled even though it was just his hand.</p>
<p>“When did you start noticing?”</p>
<p>He started saying something. Lee-yeon wanted to say something. Something—</p>
<p>“You knew. That I’m not your husband.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“The retard Kwon Chae-woo is no longer here—“</p>
<p>He asked Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“You knew from the beginning, didn’t you?”</p>
