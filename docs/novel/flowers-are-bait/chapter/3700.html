            <p><strong>Chapter 79</strong></p>
<p>“Then I won’t.” Kwon Chae-woo nodded pushing his finger deeper into her.</p>
<p>“That’s… that’s not something you can make a promise about,” she said. Whenever his fingers touched her, she gasped.</p>
<p>“Even so, I’ll try. If my memory is what’s stopping you from spending time with me, then I don’t need it. I would’ve buried it myself even if you didn’t ask.” He meant it. He let go of any hopes or desire of having his memories back. It was better to see her like this, wanting him as much as he wanted her, and if he had to forgo his memory for it, then so be it. It wasn’t a very difficult choice for Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>“But I need a promise from you too,” he said, thrusting his fingers in and out of her.</p>
<p>She gasped and panted,</p>
<p>“I want you to remember whose wife you are.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s ears turned red as she heard a wet sucking sound from below. She bit her lips as she felt her lower lips contract and expand. She breathed roughly and started to sweat.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh…”</p>
<p>Whenever she flinched or her waist buckled, his fingers moved even more roughly.</p>
<p>“If ever you lie to me again or meet some other bastard behind my back….” His lips came down on her hard. “I am not letting you off the hook so easily.”</p>
<p>He thrust another finger in without a warning and she felt her thighs open wide. Even though she had surrendered completely, she wanted to open wider. It was a very strange sensation that Lee-yeon wanted to laugh and cry at the same time.</p>
<p>“Can you imagine how awful my life would be without you?” he said. “But you do need to be punished if you do something wrong.”</p>
<p>He looked at her. She had swallowed his fingers whole. He felt like he would spin out of control at this rate. He frowned as he strained against his pants. He wanted to make her scream in pleasure, but he was afraid she would hate him for it.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, like me just a little,” he said, rubbing her sensitive parts and not stopping his fingers. She moaned. She forgot about being embarrassed because she was naked. Even though his fingers kept shoving and rubbing her, she was still reluctant.</p>
<p>“Even when I am cruel,” he said, buckling off the belt on his pants. “You of all people can embrace me.”</p>
<p>“You are my wife,” he said as he pulled down his underwear. He was hard. The thing was so big it stunned her momentarily.</p>
<p><em>What the hell is that? </em>Lee-yeon’s face became stiff.</p>
<p>“Why do you act like this is the first time you have seen your husband naked?” he chuckled.</p>
<p>“Uh well….” She couldn’t think properly. “It’s been a while…” <em>It’s my first time seeing a man naked…</em></p>
<p>“Ah, right. I was in vegetative state.” He rubbed himself. Lee-yeon swallowed.</p>
<p>She knew about intercourse between a man and a woman. But she had never imagined it would feel this obscene. It looked like that thing would give her more pain than pleasure.</p>
<p>“Well, this might be a problem, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>He took the rest of Lee-yeon’s pants and undergarments off completely and crawled over her. “I have no memory of doing it with you…”</p>
<p>He grabbed her chest and fondled it. “I am a virgin in that sense.” She could feel his hardness at her entrance. “So, you will have to guide me since you have more experience.”</p>
<p>Of course, he knew what to do even if he had no memory, but he wanted to involve Lee-yeon more actively. “You said we weren’t good at it.”</p>
<p>“Uh… yes…”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s try it from the beginning.”</p>
<p>He kissed her behind her ears to her collarbone, down to her chest and her bellybutton. He trailed kisses after kisses on her as he gently pried her thighs open again.</p>
<p>“A person tends to get really hungry when a delicious meal is in front of him,” he said. She felt his nose touch her down below. He spread her wide. Her waist buckled in anticipation.</p>
<p>His tongue found its way in and licked like a dog. It rubbed against her most sensitive part and made her wet. He pressed down on her cl*t and sent her reeling at the edge of consciousness.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon moaned. His hands crushed her butt. As he kept shoving his tongue in, she climaxed. Kwon Chae-woo sucked on her fluids.</p>
<p>“Mm… Ahh!”</p>
<p>She trembled. She felt so exhausted that she couldn’t move but she wanted more.</p>
<p>“I am sorry I don’t know what I am supposed to do,” he said mockingly as he rubbed her below. His eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>He poised between her legs.  His hardness seeking entrance. The veins around his neck popped as though he was trying so hard to retrain himself.</p>
<p>He could wait any longer. She clenched the sheets in her fist as he thrust into her. He could feel him hot and hard inside her. She swallowed her scream. He cursed but she couldn’t hear him.</p>
<p>At first, she was blinded by pain as he filled her completely. But slowly the pain subsided as he slid out halfway. An odd pleasure filled her instead. She could feel a heat build up within her. Kwon Chae-woo grabbed her hips and pushed himself in again. She couldn’t withhold her moans.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, was it like this the first time for you too? F*ck, it’s so good I am going to die,” he said roughly.</p>
<p>He thrust in and out. The sound reverberated in the room. His other hand was on her chest. He could see she was aroused too. He got even more excited at the sight. He slid out halfway and shoved in harder.</p>
<p>“Mm… Ahhh!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was so deeply moved by the pleasure that she felt afraid. She felt her body heating up and then cooling down at the same time. All emotions and feelings were jumbled inside her. She felt so confused at this strange sensation.</p>
<p>“Hmmm…”</p>
<p>Her insides felt as though they contracted and expanded not knowing what to do with it. Kwon Chae-woo moaned at the feeling. He sank his teeth into her neck and thrust harder, unable to control himself. Her insides swallowed him whole.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon… Lee-yeon,” he moaned. He grabbed at her chest and kissed her.</p>
<p>Her body trembled, close to another climax. “Kwon Chae-woo… I…uhhh…”</p>
<p>She panted.</p>
<p>“No,” he said. He lifted one of her legs and placed it on his shoulder to open her wide so that it would be easier for her. The eyes that looked at Lee-yeon looked feverish. He thrust again while she moaned.</p>
<p>“Call me Chae-woo…,” he grunted.</p>
