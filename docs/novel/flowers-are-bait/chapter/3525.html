        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 259</strong></p>
<p>“Male, you promised me.” Gyu-baek demanded Kwon Chae-woo. He still called Kwon Chae-woo as “male” like a male insect.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, who was now holding the sleeping Lee-yeon against his shoulder, looked at someone’s slender legs that were close by.</p>
<p>Just then, the noisy laughter of Joo Dong-mi and Choo-ja echoed from a distance. Everyone must be coming this way, embracing beautiful bouquets.</p>
<p>Moreover, to formally introduce Jang Beom-hee, who recently moved in, he invited her here. Kwon Chae-woo’s face still showed no signs of realizing his mistake, appearing nonchalant.</p>
<p>“If you help this male marry Director Lee-yeon, then—”</p>
<p>These were the words a man whispered to a child in front of the Kwon family the other day. This was the condition given to Gyu-baek, who couldn’t get his mind off of money.</p>
<p>He also gave him a heavier and better gold toad, and… …</p>
<p>“I’ll let you officiate the wedding.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. But this male haven’t gotten married yet.”</p>
<p>“No, I practice every night these days.”</p>
<p>“Why, does it seem close?”</p>
<p>“It’s just around the corner.”</p>
<p>At Gyubaek’s significant words, Kwon Chae-woo’s lips curled into a smile. Covering Lee-yeon meticulously with the falling blanket, he gestured with his eyes.</p>
<p>“Then, let’s rehearse.”</p>
<p>“It’s a practice for director’s wedding ceremony.”</p>
<p>Gyubaek held both hands and lifted his heels. He had practiced so much that he could recite it effortlessly even in his sleep. The child’s small lips moved densely.</p>
<p>“Macaroni penguin, gray wolf, pinecone lizard, long-armed monkey, black bald eagle—”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo interrupted with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>“What on earth is that?”</p>
<p>“The groom must not interfere.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Whether his words were blocked or he felt good about the title, Kwon Chae-woo closed his mouth.</p>
<p>“Macaroni penguin, gray wolf, pinecone lizard, long-armed monkey, black bald eagle, owl monkey, gnu, white-headed eagle. Until death, these animals love only one female.”</p>
<p>A soft, small laugh burst out from Kwon Chae-woo’s shoulder. Lee-yeon tried to endure the urge to squirm.</p>
<p>But the man, who had already realized that she had awakened, pressed his lips directly to her forehead.</p>
<p>“In the future, you’ll be responsible for parenting like a macaroni penguin. If your partner is in danger like a gray wolf, you’ll risk your life to run. Like a pinecone lizard, you’ll send the female first and walk behind. Like a long-armed monkey, you’ll raise the offspring together and groom each other. Like a black bald eagle, you’ll stick together every day, year after year. Like a gnu, if your partner leaves the spot, you’ll eat less. Like an owl monkey, you’ll never cheat. Like a white-headed eagle, you’ll spend at least twenty years together.”</p>
<p>With both hands tightly clasped, the child’s pose looked convincing, but the tone was still as if he were reading from an encyclopedia. Lee-yeon bit her lower lip hard, trying her best not to laugh.</p>
<p>“In fact, I don’t really know what a blessing is.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But when I look at Director Lee-yeon and you, words I didn’t know suddenly come to mind. There are many things here that are not in the dictionary.”</p>
<p>The always expressionless child showed a neat row of teeth for the first time. The emotionless face twisted, and unnoticed dimples appeared on both cheeks. The gaze, which was always like reading a book or studying insects, briefly sparkled, facing a person rather than a book or an insect.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon hugged Kwon Chae-woo’s forearm tightly, and he gazed at Gyu-baek with very affectionate eyes.</p>
<p>The baby to be born will have a pure and upright older brother that she never had. Her child will take the opposite path from the life his father chose, and he may grow up to care for his older brother more than anyone else.</p>
<p>However, Namwoo’s older brother’s story of building the largest insect ecology museum in the country for his precious brother is a story from a very, very distant future.</p>
<p>“Director So Lee-yeon—! “I’m here!”</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon-ah, I’m here!”</p>
<p>“Doyeon … ”</p>
<p>“…Who, who is that?” Kwon Chae-woo demanded an answer.</p>
<p>One by one, the invited guests gathered into the forest.</p>
<p>A few seconds before a loud commotion broke out.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woon hoped that she would quickly find the wooden box hidden behind her cello.</p>
<p>Inside, the yellow post-it notes that the girl had secretly left on her tree trunk were piled up like pebbles. Those precious moments when I whispered, <em>“Hello, thank you, you gave me strength, I miss you, I want to meet you.”</em></p>
<p>“I want to live as Lee-yeon’s flower for the rest of my life.” Kwon Chae-woo told her.</p>
<p>The man who started out as her plant became her plant again and fell lightly on her.</p>
<p>But now he wasn’t fooled.</p>
<p>There was no need to lie.</p>
<p>She was the only tree doctor in the world who could deal with this terrifying plant man who could turn at any moment.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon whispered jokingly responded to his confession, “Not as my husband?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>At the same time, Joo Dong-mi, who was growling, made Jang Beom-hee crawl on the ground.</p>
<p>It was early spring, the beginning of the festival.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That night, Lee-yeon opened a storybook in her dream. On the front page, the words Baby Tree- were written, crossed out, and rewritten.</p>
<p>To baby Nam-woo.</p>
<p>It was a story about a tree with deep roots and a tree that sings, and living happily ever after. It was a letter that said that in Hwaido, where music, trees, and insects come together, everyone can love and laugh.</p>
<p><em>So come on over.</em></p>
<p>The author is Lee Gyu-baek , and the title is…</p>
<p>Another unforgettable summer was approaching.</p>
<p>-End</p>
