            <p><strong>Chapter 124</strong></p>
<p>When Lee-yeon finished taking a shower, she emerged from the bathroom to an empty bed. She rushed into the living room and kitchen in search of him, but all she got was the sound of her own footsteps. He was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo?” Lee-yeon leap up the stairs two at a time.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s hair was wet as he stood tall, looking as though he too had just finished taking a shower. As soon as their eyes met, he walked over to her dressed in nothing but a pair of loose-fitting pajama pants.</p>
<p>His strong, broad shoulders, rock hard abs, and sleek waist…</p>
<p>“Are you done staring?”</p>
<p>“Ahm.”</p>
<p>He grabbed Lee-yeon’s chin, taking her so much by surprise that she accidentally bit her tongue. But when the gentle light from the nightlight shone upon his face, she couldn’t even feel the pain.</p>
<p>As the dark shadows receded, they slowly revealed, one after the other, his ears, nose, lips, and his two piercing eyes. When at last she was left face to face with those soft hazel irises, she felt dazed.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon studied the details of his face. Chae-woo furrowed his brow slightly at her blatant staring.</p>
<p>“Is there still something more to see?”</p>
<p>“…All that time you were asleep, I missed seeing these eyes.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Just watching you blink is nice.”</p>
<p>“Then, do you not want to use your mouth?”</p>
<p>He rubbed the tip of his thumb over Lee-yeon’s lower lip, slightly grazing her teeth. Chae-woo’s eyes grew misty every time he saw her shoulders start to shake from the slightest stimulation.</p>
<p>“If I put it in your mouth…”</p>
<p>His pants slipped down, revealing all at once his hardened member, slightly purple and red in color. Just looking at it made her face hot, and her eyes burn. He patted his dick with his palm.</p>
<p>“It’ll be disgusting and make you want to gag.”</p>
<p>“Is it that bad?”</p>
<p>“You’ve never done it before?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t…”</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes gently.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell whether you’re timid or not.”</p>
<p>Chae-woo swallowed his laughter when he saw the innocent look on her face. Even if he forgot everything else, there was no doubting how he felt when spread her legs and drove himself into her. What had they been doing this whole time if she’s never blown him before? What exactly is so precious? What makes her mouth more special than others?</p>
<p>“It’s okay. We have plenty of time.”</p>
<p>Chae-woo smiled, a strange look on his face. But he found his past self was both amusing and unpleasant. His mouth watered with the urge to ridicule himself for acting so foolishly.</p>
<p>He pushed hard against her chest.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon fell onto the bed, embarrassed by his roughness. Then, her body stiffened when he roughly shoved three fingers into her mouth.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to do it, you have to open up wide.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>“If you’re already shocked by this, it’s no fun.”</p>
<p>She was infatuated with glittering lust. His thick hands rubbed the moist inside other mouth as if tickling it and pressed hard against her soft tongue. At the same time, he shoved another finger in.</p>
<p>Chae-woo held Lee-yeon’s chin and continued swirling his fingers around in her mouth. He stroked the soft inner flesh of her mouth, thinking of how it felt to be inside her, and gently stroked her molars and the roots of her gums searching for sensitive areas.</p>
<p>“Ah, hhhh….”</p>
<p>At first she was dumbfounded and bewildered, but slowly she felt her body begin to awaken. Her drool was rolling chillingly down her neck. Then he pulled his hand out, grabbed her by the back of her head and pressed against her.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>He shoved himself into her, scratching the roof of her mouth, and filling it with a fiery, hot sensation. He reached all the way to the back of her throat, suffocating Lee-yeon with a pressure that was entirely different from the four fingers.<br>
“Tighten your lips. And don’t use your teeth.”</p>
<p>“Huh…”</p>
<p>“You have to keep your mouth tight and suck, not just drool all over it.”</p>
<p>The inside of her mouth swelled like it might explode and with every breath she inhaled an unfamiliar, musty scent. Lee-yeon held Chae-woo’s thighs tightly, scared by her lips stretched so tightly around him. His leg muscles stiffened, and he clenched his abs.</p>
<p>“Ha…” A short, feverish moan escaped his lips as he pressed against Lee-yeon’s head.</p>
<p>“Swallow deeply.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, uh…”</p>
<p>There was a considerable difference in their eye levels, and yet they did not take their eyes off each other. Lee-yeon’s eyes shook, but she trusted him and obeyed as he instructed her, his expression filled with suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to take it out. Open your mouth wider.”</p>
<p>She felt her tongue rub against his bulging shaft. Sliding against the inside of her cheek, brushing against the roof of her mouth, at last she felt the tip of his penis hit the back of her throat and slide deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>Every time the sheer length and thickness of him pumped in and out of her mouth, a strong, musty scent surrounded her, making her feel dizzy. Despite this, Lee-yeon instinctively sucked in her cheeks and moved her face back and forth.</p>
<p>At first, his balls had only slightly rubbed against her chin, but now they started to smack strongly against her face.</p>
