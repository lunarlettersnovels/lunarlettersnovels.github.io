            <p><strong>Chapter 125</strong></p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh, ugh.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon opened her mouth wide trying to suppress her gag reflex.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, I have a lot on my mind lately.”</p>
<p>His biting voice was interlaced with sweet breath.</p>
<p>“What should I do, hh…” Chae-woo covered Lee-yeon’s ears and started pumping his hips faster. His burning groin smashed hard against her face and lips. “How can I repay you for all that time?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, ooh…”</p>
<p>“I really want to pay you back.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was just fighting to keep her mouth open. Tears welled in her eyes, and she was struggling to breathe. Her ears buzzed from being covered by his hands, but his gaze looking down at her was clear.</p>
<p>“I know it’s important for people to know kindness.”</p>
<p>But as Lee-yeon was struggling to open her throat and still struggling to breathe, all she could do was focus on trying not to bite down on his penis. Then he thrust into her mouth again as though trying to pierce right through her.</p>
<p>“I’m not some kind of bloodhound that attacks out of nowhere.”</p>
<p>Chae-woo burst into laughter for the first time since having woken from his deep slumber. His normally ferocious-looking eyes were twisted in intense pleasure.</p>
<p>“Hugh, ugh.”</p>
<p>As the tip rubbed mercilessly against the roof of Lee-yeon’s mouth, he got goosebumps and moaned. Lee-yeon involuntarily clenched her jaw, lightly scratching her teeth against him. He thrust himself faster in and out of her mouth. Chae-woo breathed hard and licked his lower lip roughly.</p>
<p>“Oh… Shit…”</p>
<p>His abs clenched and tightened.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t understand this life at all.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh.”</p>
<p>“Actually, your face often pops up in my mind.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Because I want to see you.”</p>
<p>When she suddenly lifted her tongue which had been pressed down the entire time, and rubbed it against him, she felt something hot shoot into the inside of her mouth.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon couldn’t stand the overwhelming scent of semen and pushed against him. However, Chae-woo stood his ground, stubbornly shooting his seed into her mouth. He had no intention of removing himself from her choking mouth.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh…!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon twisted her face and patted his stomach softly. Only then did he pull himself out and rub a line of semen along her cheek with his tip. Lee-yeon immediately coughed up the opaque liquid onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Cough…! Cough…!</p>
<p>Her throat tingled as she fought the urge to vomit. She slowly poked her tongue around the inside of her ravaged mouth, trying to ignore the metallic smell of blood. But as he helped her up, Chae-woo’s eyes were still gentle and kind.</p>
<p>“Was it awful?”</p>
<p>“That…”</p>
<p>“Did you cry?”</p>
<p>For reasons even Chae-woo didn’t know, he found himself frowning. He shuddered roughly and suddenly felt foul.</p>
<p>“I told you it would be disgusting,” he said dully, lightly touching her red eyes. “This is why you should always be careful what you use your mouth for.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Gasp…!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon woke suddenly from a terrible nightmare and jumped from position in the bed. As she slowly blinked her eyes, still half asleep, she noticed the empty space beside her. It was the second time her throat felt swollen and sore. Lee-yeon ran out, not bothering to glance behind her, her hair disheveled.</p>
<p>She hadn’t planned on falling asleep! When had she drifted off?</p>
<p><em>‘Where is him?’</em></p>
<p>Her head filled with awful thoughts, making her more and more frantic.</p>
<p>“Are you up?”</p>
<p>Just then, the voice she’d been hoping to hear came from the kitchen. The savory smell of something sizzling in the frying pan pulled her in slowly. Lee-yeon halted when she saw Chae-woo who was skillfully flipping fried eggs and sausages.</p>
<p>“Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>“….” She felt as if she were still wandering in a dream.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Miss Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>As their eyes met, he smiled familiarly and Lee-yeon seemed to melt slowly at the smell of the food and the sight of the eggshells piled up.</p>
<p>She wanted so badly to believe that she’d finally gotten her life back.</p>
<h3>***<br>
“What are you doing spacing out over there? Aren’t you going to come give me a hug?” Lee-yeon said, her voice full of laughter, as she wrapped her arms around his waist from behind.</h3>
<p>“…Chae-woo, what happened yesterday? Did you sleep beside me?”</p>
<p>“I slept properly and then I got up.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon felt she had to get a glimpse of his expression somehow, so she pushed her face under his arm. Surprised by her assertive attitude, he lifted the frying pan high.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, you’ll get hit by the oil,” he scolded her somewhat harshly as tried to shield her face with his hands, but her eyes were bright.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you really slept? Am I helpful again?”</p>
<p>“I woke up without any trouble and I didn’t have any nightmares.”</p>
<p>“Really? You’re not lying, right?”</p>
<p>“I’m not lying.”</p>
<p>Her eyes gleamed with joy. Chae-woo stared at her as she smiled lightly with her blistered lips, then turned his head.</p>
<p>“My nightmares must have moved on to someone else.”</p>
<p>“Moved on?” she asked in reply, but Chae-woo only smiled cryptically.</p>
<p>“Come, sit down.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon glanced at him, feeling an odd sense of regret in the pit of her stomach as she trudged over to the table. When he heard the chair scrape against the floor, the smile he had been trying to maintain immediately fell and he bit the inside of his lip.</p>
<p>He could sleep last a night, even a week, without sleep. He had trained for this, so it felt as routine as eating breakfast.</p>
<p>Last night, Lee-yeon had fallen asleep as soon as she’d hit the bed, completely forgetting her intention to stay up all night together. Every once in a while, she would murmur his name in her sleep, and he would instinctively scrunch up his face, his stomach twisting in knots.</p>
