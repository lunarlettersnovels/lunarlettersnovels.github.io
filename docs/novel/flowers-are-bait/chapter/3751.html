            <p><strong>Chapter 28</strong></p>
<p>“Is your memory back?” asked Lee-yeon, trembling in his arms. Her question startled him. “Is it?!” she asked again.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was scared. A loyal and gentle person suddenly biting her neck so aggressively could only mean he was back. He was insane. She was scared of the worst scenario that could happen. He could kill her.</p>
<p>“Is your memory back?” Her voice was distraught. It sounded fearful.</p>
<p>It brought Kwon Chae-woo to the present. He stopped what he was doing. He looked at her bruised neck and at Lee-yeon who was trembling. It looked painful. “No…,” he said, ashamed, “No, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes reflect fear and suspicion. Her blood ran cold. She studied Kwon Chae-woo with terrified eyes.</p>
<p>She looked at him as though she saw a monster. Kwon Chae-woo was overcome with a sense of guilt and shame. Her eyes told the story of the kind of person he might have been in the past. When his excitement quietened down, he was only left feeling ashamed.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, I’m sorry.” he said. “I lost my mind for a while and made a mistake.” He ran his hand through his hair and lowered his head. He then covered his eyes with his palms. “I am really sorry.”</p>
<p>However, questions were boiling within him. <em>But why would she ask me if my memories were back? Is it because I touched her? What did Kwon Chae-woo of the past do to her for her to react like this? </em>He took a deep breath to calm himself.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath to calm himself down. “Lee-yeon, we’d better not sleep together today.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“That will be my punishment. I will give up my morning.” He looked at her. “It doesn’t matter if it extends to a month or two. Don’t wake me up until you can forgive me.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo got up from the bed. <em>What the hell does he mean? Is he for real? </em>Lee-yeon watched with wide eyes as he started walking away. She was immensely relieved that his memory wasn’t back and she could sleep alone. She winced as she felt her neck.</p>
<p>She got up from the bed and followed Kwon Chae-woo. “Kwon Chae-woo, wait!”</p>
<p>He looked up at her urgent voice from the bottom of the stairs. When their eyes met, he cursed in a low voice. Lee-yeon could tell that it was a really bad cuss word.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo opened his mouth slightly and frowned as if in pain.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Are you alright?” asked Lee-yeon, confused. She walked down the stairs but Kwon Chae-woo held up a hand to stop her.</p>
<p>“Just stay there,” he said with a restrained voice.</p>
<p>“Why?” she asked.</p>
<p>“If you come any closer, I won’t be able to let you sleep alone. So, just stay there.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon didn’t move.</p>
<p>“Or, is it that you want to see me c*m?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes involuntarily turned to his lower body. She realized he was still aroused.</p>
<p>“Does that mean you want to see it?” He narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“What?! N-no!” said Lee-yeon and averted her eyes.</p>
<p>“Really?” he said, “You just looked very interested seconds ago.”</p>
<p>“I was not,” Lee-yeon shot back. “I was just checking to see if any dropped on the floor. As the owner of this house, I have to keep it clean. I can’t afford to be as careless unlike someone.”</p>
<p>She was annoyed. She avoided his gaze.</p>
<p>“The floor is fine. For now,” he said, equally annoyed. “But if you make me stand here like this, it won’t be fine for long.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s face turned red. Kwon Chae-woo clenched his teeth as though he had a hard time holding himself back. Her blushing made it harder for him.</p>
<p>As soon as he made up his mind, he quickly turned around and crossed the first floor. Lee-yeon watched blankly at him walking away. She then realized she had come here to say something.</p>
<p>“Wait!” she said, bounding after him. “If you want to sleep alone, then we should change rooms. Wait, why are you going to my room? Where will I—”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo had slammed the door close and locked the room from inside. This was the first time she had seen him like this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kwon Chae-woo tried hard to ignore her voice. Her bed with her odor was a terrible paradise to him. It reminded him of her. He buried his face in her pillow and stroked and rubbed his member to satiate his yearning for her.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Is it just you, Choo-ja, and me in this hospital?” Kwon Chae-woo had once asked on his way to the meeting banquet.</p>
<p>“There is one more person. But he is more like an insect doctor. But… it’s been a while since we have seen him. He is busy with school.”</p>
<p>“Is he also a teacher?”</p>
<p>“Um… he goes to elementary school.” Lee-yeon hadn’t given any more information. Kwon Chae-woo would eventually meet him after all.</p>
<p>“Director!” The front door swung open, and a voice of a young boy filled the room. The child was carrying a big backpack that looked like it was about to pop with the contents, but his stride was purposeful. The child was holding a transparent insect box in his arms.</p>
