            <p><strong>Chapter 50</strong></p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s because of all the time I spent in a vegetative state, but I feel scared and uneasy when I can’t control my body.” He was pretending to be weak.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, hurry. I want to wash up fast and rest.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeaon was scared but she couldn’t just up and leave. She didn’t want to rile him. Nothing good would come out of aggravating a man when his memory was supposedly returning.</p>
<p>“I will use the towels to wash you,” said Lee-yeon, getting the towels from the hanger.</p>
<p>“Unbuckle me first.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon put her hand in the tub. The temperature warmed and soothed her. She carefully touched his pant. He let out a little sigh. Lee-yeon had closed her eyes. When she opened them, she saw his face very close.</p>
<p>“That’s not the spot, Lee-yeon,” he said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Those are my balls you are touching,” he said with a smirk. “Go a little higher for the zip.”</p>
<p>She snatched her hand back in surprise. Kwon Chae-woo’s smile disappeared. He then grabbed her arms and pulled her into the tub with him.</p>
<p>Her clothes were all wet now. Lee-yeon pushed his chest away and lifted her head in anger. “Don’t play around!” she yelled.</p>
<p>“You started it.” She wanted to wipe that smirk off his face.</p>
<p>“I did not!”</p>
<p>“How can I not be furious when my own wife puts me on a market?” he said. “And you were in charge.”</p>
<p><em>Weren’t we done talking about that? </em>She saw kwon Chae-woo’s scowl and realized he had bee holding back until this moment. Their fight was just beginning.</p>
<p>“There are times where I want to teach you a lesson,” he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“What do you…”</p>
<p>“What’s the point of holding the leash when you don’t even take advantage of it?” Lee-yeon was speechless. <em>What is he even talking about?</em></p>
<p>“You tremble just unbuckling my pants,” he said. “You’re so unused to me being under you, but you thought about selling me to another woman?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stared at him. “Didn’t you find it a waste?”</p>
<p>He lowered his head and nibbled gently on Lee-yeon’s br*ast that stuck out from the top of her brassiere.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon gasped. Her heart pounded at the sudden bite. <em>Isn’t this a fight?</em></p>
<p>She tried her best to ignore the heat building down her waist and pushed him away hard. But he was too heavy. He suddenly lifted her up and placed her on the tub. Now, she was beneath him. The water splashed out of the tub at the movement.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo, t- this is….”</p>
<p>The body on top of her towered over her. Kwon Chae-woo looked at her with bloodshot eyes. “If you are going to give me away, you should try me first,” he said.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was speechless. “Use me properly before you dismiss me.”</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo, it’s not like that,” she said. She couldn’t tell him the truth. She needed to determine whether all this was his illness talking. She didn’t know how to explain that to him. His reaction wasn’t good.</p>
<p>“You pretend to be so conservative whenever I come near you,” he said, ‘If you were, why would you swap me to another woman? I didn’t think I would get backstabbed by someone who pretends to be so loyal.”</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo…”</p>
<p>“Were you always like this?” he asked. “Since you can’t throw me out directly because you feel like I am your responsibility, you dump me on other people instead?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was so flustered. She didn’t know what to say. She wanted to defend herself but she could only manage an occasional ‘uh’ or ‘huh’.</p>
<p>“Of course, I said I would do anything you wanted,” he said. “I need to clarify for the last time. Do you really want me to f*ck another woman?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was speechless. She hadn’t meant anything like that. “Is that what you want?” he asked coldly.</p>
<p><em>Who even said that? </em>Lee-yeon realized miserably that his thoughts and behavior were always so extreme. The doctor was right.</p>
<p>“You want that?”</p>
<p>“No!” She shook her head. Every time she moved; the water splashed.</p>
<p>“Explain to me properly. Or else I’m going to misunderstand that you’re trying to get rid of me because you’re curious of how other’s d*ck tastes.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon didn’t respond. <em>What was he even talking about?</em></p>
<p>“I’m a little empty in my head so I’m self-critical,” he explained.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon had gotten used to his gentle, obedient side. This was completely unexpected. Lee-yeon felt completely confused.</p>
<p>He spoke calmly enough but he looked angry. Lee-yeon felt frustrated. She was completely clueless on how to handle the situation.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo looked at her and smiled. “Is that your final answer?”</p>
<p>“I… what?… no.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” he said. “I understand perfectly.”</p>
<p>He lowered his head and sucked on Lee-yeon’s lips. He dug his tongue into her mouth. The water splashed out of the tub. Her lips were moist so it opened readily. His eyes were calm. His hot breath was on her skin.</p>
<p>He was intertwined with her from their waist, to their mouth. His strong hands wrapped around her face as he kissed her. Every time they moved; the water spill out of the tub. His chest pressed against hers. His tongue played with hers.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon gasped as his knee pried her legs apart. They were pressed so close together. His manhood was hard and it poked against the bottom of her belly. It brushed against her over her clothes and left her quivering.</p>
<p>He gathered her bre*sts in his rough hands. He lowered his lips from her lips to her cheeks, then to her neck. Every time, his tongue brushed her skin, she felt the heat build up. His hands found their way underneath her clothes in a hurry. He grabbed her perky br*asts and sucked on them. His tongue brushed over the tip.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon moaned. She felt weak and shivery. If her legs weren’t intertwined with his, she would have just fallen in the water. She felt her grip on the sides of the tub weakening.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she was lifted up by her waist and her pants were pulled off. While she fumbled in surprise, his thick hands rested on her panties.</p>
