            <p><strong>Chapter 257</strong></p>
<p><em>‘-I will be the spruce of Hwaido. I will stand in place of the Spiritual Tree, and play old music. Until I die, until I become the heritage of the island.’</em></p>
<p>At the time of the red sunset, Kwon Chae-woo played every day in the place where the spirit tree disappeared as promised.</p>
<p>The unusual performance was rumored in just a few days, and now, two months later, some audiences intentionally crossed from the land to Hwaido to see Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>He began to plan to turn Hwaido into Asia’s Lucerne (*a Swiss city where prestigious music festivals are held) by mobilizing the funds of the family.</p>
<p>It was a project to brand it as a “music city” by establishing a professional concert hall and attracting periodic festivals, international competitions, music academies, and even hosting a children’s song festival.</p>
<p>It was during this time that Lee-yeon heard Kwon Chae-woo speaking German for the first time. When that happened, she felt strange and fascinated, often wandering around him to eavesdrop.</p>
<p>In those moments, Kwon Chae-woo would nonchalantly continue his phone call, abruptly end the conversation, and hurry over. The coarse sound he made while speaking the foreign language suited him as if he were a native.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about the baby’s name for a while.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was walking in the reed field with Kwon Chae-woo, her belly was noticeably round.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Nam-woo.”</p>
<p>“Wood?”</p>
<p>“No, Namwoo!”</p>
<p>“Wait, isn’t that your first love’s name?” Kwon Chae-woo frowned and snapped at Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“What? Do you still hold a grudge because of that?”</p>
<p>“Grudge or not, all I can think of is the jealousy I felt back then. It just makes me feel bad for no reason.”</p>
<p>“But people say they Nam-woo is nice.”</p>
<p>“What people are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“The people who knew I was pregnant early on.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo sighed as if dumbfounded. However, when he saw her laughing while covering her mouth, he felt inexplicably entangled.</p>
<p>He pressed his lips against her plump, tempting cheeks and then opened his coat, enveloping Lee-yeon inside.</p>
<p>Soon, the two of them wandered through the seemingly endless reed fields. Lee-yeon turned her body with an expression of disbelief on her face. When Kwon Chae-woo tried to lean down again for a kiss, she quickly turned her head, avoiding the gesture.</p>
<p>“Is all of this your land, Chae-woo?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And all of this belongs to you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Lost in the vastness, Lee-yeon’s eyes blinked as a sturdy chin was suddenly placed on top of her head.</p>
<p>A gentle voice, the slow movement of an Adam’s apple, and the cool wind playing with the strands of her hair all conveyed a profound sense of presence.</p>
<p>“Beautiful Hwaido Island.”</p>
<p>Although it was a shattered slogan as the reality of Hwaido Island unfolded, Lee-yeon actually liked those words.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it all to you.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“In the future, the entire island will sing for you. Wherever you are, wherever you go, until I become visible in the breeze.”</p>
<p>“I’ll make it happen for you.” Kwon Chae-woo promised, holding her tightly.</p>
<p>It was a moment when a man’s consolation created a vast paradise.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The long winter had passed.</p>
<p>Despite the severe cold and frequent snowstorms due to the first frost warning in more than a decade, Lee-yeon experienced the warmest winter of her life.</p>
<p>Whenever she worried that the trees might suffer from the East Sea winds, Kwon Chae-woo climbed up the hill and wrapped the pine and persimmon trees with straw.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon sent handmade baby clothes to the local government whenever she had spare time, and the house gradually filled with various adorable baby items.</p>
<p>“Let’s endure this winter well and make sure to bloom the leaves. We made it through,” she whispered like a prayer whenever she found a moment.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lee-yeon was leaning against a tree, listening to a gentle melody, much like on a certain day in the distant past.</p>
<p>The “greetings of love” emanating from the man’s hands were as soft and warm as the early spring weather.</p>
<p>In the midst of the dense forest, there were sparkling glass lanterns, a suitable-sized table, and delicately arranged flowers scattered in secret places.</p>
<p>It was a baby shower that Kwon Chae-woo had meticulously prepared for Lee-yeon, who was approaching childbirth.</p>
<p>After finishing the performance, he carefully wiped the fingerboard, body, and bridge with a cotton cloth. Lee-yeon, observing this, scanned Kwon Chae-woo’s black hair, well-defined back, tightly pulled shoulders, and even the thighs revealed when he bent his knees.</p>
<p>Bathing in the sunlight filtering through the leaves, she suddenly asked, “Chae-woo, isn’t it boring to live with me?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what you heard.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo smirked, raising one eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’ve turned you into a househusband, Chae-woo.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I spent a fulfilling winter.”</p>
<p>“Still, originally…”</p>
<p>“Originally?”</p>
<p>“I thought you would rather be a bit more…”</p>
<p>“A bit more?”</p>
<p>“Busier. Back at the Kwon’s house…” Lee-yeon lowered her voice.</p>
<p>In that place, Kwon Chae-woo always carried the scent of blood. During the day, he would either sprawl out or stand tall like a bamboo shoot, and at night, he would wear a pitch-black mask, revealing only his eerie eyes.</p>
<p>The man who used to stand on the stage of the Berlin Philharmonic Hall now played music on the ground like a poor student. Every time she saw him like that, a faint uneasiness took root in Lee-yeon’s heart.</p>
<p>Maybe, he would yearn for the wealth and honor he enjoyed in the past. Perhaps he would one day find his place and leave.</p>
<p>But Lee-yeon didn’t know.</p>
<p>She didn’t know that this househusband had quietly taken root as the next successor of the Kwon family.</p>
