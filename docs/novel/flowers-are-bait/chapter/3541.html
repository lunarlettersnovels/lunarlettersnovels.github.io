            <p><strong>Chapter 243</strong></p>
<p>“… Gyu-baek!”</p>
<p>Gyu-baek, who had a luxurious bath even until the last night before leaving, was all fatten up from the one month of his “confinement”. Even after all the trouble, he was now finally free from the mansion, and acting like high and all mighty.</p>
<p>Even excluding the schedule of reading Lee-yeon the encyclopedia every night, Gyu-baek’s schedule was pretty packed.</p>
<p>Gyu-baek chased Jang Beom-hee around like his sworn enemy until Jang Beom-hee gave up and grabbed a bunch of tutors to keep the child company.</p>
<p>Gyu-baek was able to receive such high education and all the good quality food was just bonus. His face was as smooth as a boiled egg as he looked up at Lee-yeon and Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>“Gyu-baek, what is all these? Are these your luggage?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon pointed at the carriers that were following him.</p>
<p>“It’s branded clothes.”</p>
<p>“…. Huh?”</p>
<p>“Also hundred science books, fountain pens, observation tools, a pair of golden toads, shoes, and a laptop.”</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon was speechless, Gyu-baek sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame. I like living here more than living with my uncle and grandpa.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon looked down, Kwon Chae-woo messed the child’s hair.</p>
<p>“It’s not the place you like, it’s the money.”</p>
<p>“… It’s not bad.”</p>
<p>“All grown up, huh?”</p>
<p>“The taste of money is the best. Insects should also live in a place like this.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon read the ambition that was in the child’s eyes and quickly poked Kwon Chae-woo on the side. But only her finger hurt because of his muscles.</p>
<p>“I’ll let you live like this when we go back to Hwaido.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. It’s impossible as that man is unemployed.” The child pointed Kwon Chae-woo. “I don’t want to go home.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo raised his eyebrows but it was only for a moment.</p>
<p>“Child, who lived here longer than you? Think quickly. You’re smart.”</p>
<p>Gyu-baek’s eyes rolled.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Go home. I have a condition for you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>However, when Gyubaek didn’t budge while fiddling with the gold sleeve buttons. So Kwon Chae-woo added.</p>
<p>“The half of Hwaido is mine. So, you can rest assured you would live the same back in Hwaido. I need you to–”</p>
<p>“Deal. I’ll do it.” Gyu-baek was quick to approve.</p>
<p>The child who experienced the end of capitalism nodded without even hearing the conditions. A meaningful smile passed by Kwon Chae-woo’s lips.</p>
<p>He sat down on his knees and whispered something in the child’s ear. For some reason, his gaze became fierce, and Gyu-baek pursed his lips solemnly.</p>
<p>“Uh, Chae-woo, don’t teach a child something weird…!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo shrugged, opened the trunk to his sedan and started to load it.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about where you’re going. I checked the inside of the car thoroughly and check the engine and heater as well.”</p>
<p>“That far?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo closed the trunk and kissed Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“A car can always become a weapon.”</p>
<p>He smoothly open the door.</p>
<p>“And there was something I couldn’t say last night…”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo curved his eyes.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on getting pregnant.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon felt shocked again. He caressed his neck and looked away as if he was a bit embarrassed and looked back at her.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo was smiling brightly. It was so bright and nice that she wouldn’t forget about it for a long time.</p>
<p>“I was getting sick of family and lineage.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon giggled and nodded at his comment. It was something Lee-yeon could truly empathized.</p>
<p>She was bullied and Kwon Chae-woo was also treated specially. They were two raised in opposite but they were similar in some way.</p>
<p>“Thank you. For giving me this chance.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Everything you gave me was joyful, but you have to give birth yourself…”</p>
<p>He sighed as if it was too much to handle.</p>
<p>He hoped that the new child wouldn’t ask him about Kwon family’s evil doing.</p>
<p>Even if it was in a destructive way, he will have to end evil in this generation.</p>
<p>The best love he could think of is making sure not to give karma from the Kwon family to his new family and life with Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“…. I hope it’s a daughter that looks like you, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>“But I hear that the first daughter has a higher chance of looking like her dad.” Gyu-baek mumbled quickly as he got into the car. He is a brave boy. A small tiger. A  truly brave boy for crossing Kwon Chae-woo all the time.</p>
<p>There was a silence between them. Kwon Chae-woo glared at Gyu-baek and Lee-yeon laughed. She caressed the back of his hand as she got on the car.</p>
<p>“You have to follow soon like you said.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>But Kwon Chae-woo just couldn’t close to doo and hung on to it. Then kissed her deeply again.</p>
<p>As she was about to let out a wet sigh, there was a sound of teeth grinding and the door closed.</p>
<p>The car left the mansion.</p>
<p>“Ha….”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon bit her hot lips and looked back the man. Kwon Chae-woo was just staring at the car that was getting away from him.</p>
<p>‘I’ll wait.’</p>
<p>She felt weird as she was watching the trees she treated.</p>
<p>It took them two hours to get to the harbor.</p>
<p>She went on the deck while she was answering call from Choo-ja and Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>The time passed quickly.</p>
<p>She could finally see the island that she longed. She smiled at Gyu-baek.</p>
<p>It was a long journey.</p>
<p>“We’re home, Gyu-baek.”</p>
<p>That was Lee-yeon’s last memory.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes, she was in a dark room alone.</p>
<p>She got up while pressing her head. She shivered from the cold air.</p>
<p><em>W, what happened?</em></p>
<p>Hwaido was just in front of her.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon got up while touching the floor and the wall.</p>
<p>Grey cement wall, dusty floor, thick steel door. It was a room where barely two, three people can be held.</p>
<p>She felt like she was choking.</p>
<p><em>Where… Am I?”</em></p>
<p>She touched her pants and she couldn’t feel her phone.</p>
<p>But what shocked her the most was…</p>
<p>“—Yeon! Lee-yeon, can you hear me? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>She heard a loud voice and bang on the steel door. Lee-yeon frowned.</p>
<p>It was familiar voice….</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Her head hurt like she was going barely remember.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, can you hear me? Can you? Answer me if you can!”</p>
<p>Her head lit up as she remembered.</p>
<p>“… Is that you? Hwang Jo-yoon?”</p>
<p>That voice belonged to Hwang Jo-yoon, who disappeared from Hwaido randomly.</p>
<p>It seemed like he was in the room next to her as he sounded close. She couldn’t tell how many days have passed.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon closed her eyes and asked.</p>
<p>“Where are we….?”</p>
<p>“… You don’t know?”</p>
<p>Hwang jo-yoon hesitated for a bit and didn’t high his intensified breathing.</p>
<p>“F*ck, this is Hwaidome….!”</p>
