            <p><strong>Chapter 238</strong></p>
<p>It was when Kwon Chae-woo stopped making music due to his mother’s fake death and resroted to violence.</p>
<p>At that time, driven by the lingering hatred for Yoon Joo-ha, Kwon Ki-seok deliberately set such conditions for the bet.</p>
<p><em><strong>Just as you felt maternal love for Kwon Chae-woo, I want you to show that kind of sincerity for my child this time. Just once, please show that earnestness in front of me.</strong></em></p>
<p>However, Yoon Joo-ha soon stopped playing his games, and tightly sealed her lips. She was a woman who would not yield even once.</p>
<p>In the past, he used to pry open her mouth and insert a spoon directly, molding rice balls between his fingers and placing them between her molars as soon as food was obtained.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he used to try closing her jaws with both hands. Chew, chew, and swallow.</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok felt that only by seeing a woman who chose life for their child would his conscience be relieved.</p>
<p>However, Yoon Joo-ha thoroughly rejected him until the moment she starved to death. Even while administering nutritional supplements overnight, she was a woman who would stab herself in the throat with the feeding needle instead. She was so relentless and ruthless.</p>
<p>She hated him so much she’d rather die than bear his son and live with him forever.</p>
<p>One day, as he looked at his brother, who had become So Lee-yeon’s husband while losing his memory, Kwon Ki-seok naturally wished for Kwon Chae-woo to experience the same thing.</p>
<p>After Chae-woo found out about So Lee-yeon’s lie, he hoped that she would be cruel to her with the trauma of ‘fake’ and ‘lies’.</p>
<p>Since killing a person was no easy task, it would be better to burden his brother with the same yoke as Yoon Joon-ha, So Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>He hoped that Chae-woo and he would have something in common. Only then could he bear the the presence of the woman that had deeply affected his heart. However, Chae-woo acted differently each time and sparked a sense of defeat to Kwon Ki-seok.</p>
<p>“…Did you, like, love Yoon Joo-ha?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon looked at him with a horrified expression, as if witnessing something dreadful.</p>
<p>“Love her, like…”</p>
<p>As if he would hear any strange words, he burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Do you think I could? I just did what I had to do as the eldest son of the Kwon family.”</p>
<p>“I was guilty of daring to kidnap a child from the Kwon family and kill another child from the Kwon family.” He added bitterly, “I won that <em>bet</em>.”</p>
<p>As lightning struck, the surroundings brightened, then darkened again. His jawline, once concealed by the backlight, now emerged with stark prominence.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon sensed an unexplainable discomfort emanating from the man whose words and demeanor existed in discord.</p>
<p>Watching a man who clung to misplaced trust all his life made the tightly closed gate seem futilely opened.</p>
<p>Perhaps apprehensive that her own countenance might mirror his, she hastily swallowed her parched saliva.</p>
<p>“Yoon Joo-ha starved to death because Chae-woo didn’t play…” She started incredulously, “What… that’s absurd!”</p>
<p><em>No, the one at fault was you, undoubtedly the perpetrator, it’s you, Kwon Ki-seok.</em> Lee-yeon’s eyes flashed with realization.</p>
<p>“I will personally tell Chae-woo the conditions of this bet when he is happiest.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but be at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“The culprit you’ve been desperately searching for is none other than yourself, the one who abandoned Yoon Joo-ha first.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon kept her face coldly composed. It was undeniable that Kwon Ki-seok was a bad person, but it was also enough to crush Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>She felt strangely uneasy. She couldn’t blame the man who was already weighed down by self-blame. She wanted to get out of there alive.</p>
<p>Even now, she didn’t resent or hate Kwon Chae-woo. It was just his presence was so special to Lee-yeon, she was afraid of being overwhelmed again.</p>
<p>A damp scent of rain filled her nostrils at that moment.</p>
<p>“…Why are you telling me all this?”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok turned and approached her.</p>
<p>“Isn’t the contract ending tomorrow? This will be the last time we see each other. Thank you for your hard work.”</p>
<p>The man, who bowed briefly, passed by Lee-yeon with an expressionless face, leaving her with a perplexing situation.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo is waiting for the day he can be happy by So Lee-yeon’s side.”</p>
<p>That was the profound dilemma Kwon Ki-seok presented.</p>
<p>He had wagered with Yoon Joo-ha. To him, all of this seemed nothing more than entertainment to him.</p>
<p>However, Kwon Ki-seok failed to consider that Lee-yeon was not just an ordinary woman; she was a doctor. When it came to taking care of others, she summoned a strength far greater than what he perceived.</p>
