            <p><strong>Chapter 119</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bang! </strong>Beom-hee was stunned when he saw that half the door had been kicked down. From the moment his ears had picked up the noise, he had immediately closed the laptop he’d been working on and grabbed his baton, but he froze at the warlike force of Chae-woo walking towards him.</p>
<p>That look in his eyes. The familiar energy he’d wielded in the past, of twisting and tearing apart all the things he found unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>“…Are you the young master?”</p>
<p>He felt a feeling of foreboding in his stomach.</p>
<p>“Beom-hee.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, his face white as a sheet, grabbed Beom-hee by the collar and pushed him to the wall.”Ugh…! How on earth…”</p>
<p>“Explain.” Chase-woo’s deeply furrowed brow and roughly raised eyebrows were fiercer than ever. The dim look in his eyes revealed his feelings of confusion and distrust, but something could be read in his expression as clearly as if illuminated by the light of a lighthouse. Jang Beom-hee’s chest expanded and sunk in anticipation. Instead of coughing, he smiled.</p>
<p>“I went under Director Kwon Ki-seok. As the young master ordered.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Are you really back?”</p>
<p>“So much so that I know you dug a cave here.” He slowly turned his head to scan Beom-hee’s room. Large dual monitors, a program still running, telescopes by the window, and pictures all over the table.</p>
<p>“What’s with the wiretapping?” Chase-woo asked, gesturing toward the monitor with his chin.</p>
<p>“Director Kwon told me to keep an eye on Lee-yeon’s every move.”</p>
<p>Chae-woo’s raised a single eyebrow in reaction.</p>
<p>On one wall hung simple descriptions of all the people at Spruce Tree Hospital, and there were an exceptional number of shots of Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>Chae-woo’s indifferent gaze lingered there. In that moment, he couldn’t move his eyes as though he was caught in a trap. Chae-woo started at the woman as if reveling in the mere image of her.</p>
<p>“This is the face of the woman who’s been playing me this whole time.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?” Beom-hee asked blankly, a slight hint of irritation in his voice.</p>
<p>“She definitely said she was my wife.”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-Hee was speechless. His master was now really back.</p>
<p>“Which is odd, since I’ve never been married or had a wife. I’m not some drugged up animal, and I’ve been shoving myself between her legs like a mad man. Like I’ve completely lost my mind.”</p>
<p>“Young Master, have your memories…,” Beom-hee started, frowning at the delicate tone of Chae-woo’s voice, but he did not respond. He was still just staring at Lee-yeon’s picture.</p>
<p>A woman like that always had a man following after her. In the photos it was Chae-woo, always holding her hand, had his arm around her shoulder, or kiss her forehead without the slightest hesitation. This man’s face, smiling affectionately, was like a stranger to Chae-woo.</p>
<p>After examining each photo one by one, Chae-woo slowly turned his head back around.</p>
<p>“I remember rolling around in bed with her whenever I had time, but that’s it.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“So, explain it to me, Beom-hee.”</p>
<p>Beom-hee immediately stood at attention when he saw Chae-woo’s fearsome expression.</p>
<p>“What the hell was I doing in that house?” Chae-woo irritably released Beom-hee’s collar.</p>
<p>“…gaslighting and sexual abuse.”</p>
<p>Chae-woo closed the laptop after reading all the reports up to now.</p>
<p>“At the time, the young master was also suffering from sleep disorders due to aftereffects from the accident.”</p>
<p>“Damn, how did I fall for such lies?” He twisted his mouth in a pernicious way. She used to lie every single time she opened her mouth. As if having a fake mother wasn’t enough, now he had a fake wife, too. To think that he had been mesmerized by that fumbling liar…</p>
<p>“You’re saying that’s how stupid I was.”</p>
<p>Every time he unclenched his fist, there was a slight cracking sound. He also felt angry at himself for having behaved like an idiot with no memory and no intelligence. He pressed his temples and sighed irritably.</p>
<p>“How many?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“So how many bugs did you plant in the house?” he turned his stiff neck and spat out disapprovingly.</p>
<p>“Twelve in total.”</p>
<p>Then he smirked through his teeth and pressed his tongue roughly against the inside of his cheek.</p>
<p>“Make sure you erase everything before you smash all the monitors you have here.”</p>
<p>“…Sorry?”</p>
<p>“Did you not overhear us having sex?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Chae-woo was cold as ice as he spat out the words as if he were cutting them to pieces. Beom-hee’s expression hardened instantly and he raised his voice in protest, “No!”</p>
<p>“I only selected the necessary information and reported it to Director Kwon! I took special care to report that Lee-yeon was committing sex crimes and gaslighting the young master, providing false information about her job, age, education background, and that she was clearly psychologically manipulating you. Other than that, I had absolutely no other intention!”</p>
