            <p><strong>Chapter 44</strong></p>
<p>It was a quiet afternoon. Lee-yeon was enjoying her warm tea as the sunlight entered through the wide window. It was the day of Kwon Chae-woo’s sleep inspection and a visit to Mt. Dongak.</p>
<p>She lifted the mug to her lips and watched the man doing push-ups under the tree without faltering. His rms and back muscles shone in the sun. His legs stretched wide…</p>
<p><em>No! No! </em>Lee-yeon recalled Kwon Chae-woo the other night when he had come out of the bathroom with just a towel wrapped around his waist. She shook her head in embarrassment. Lower part of his body reminded her of a giant mushroom and she always had to remind her self to not be too curious about it.</p>
<p>“Female peacocks focus on the upper part of the male’s tail from far away but focus on the lower part when close.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon almost dropped her mug. She turned around to see a Gyu-baek walking towards her while staring out of the window. His face was expressionless. She greeted him calmly trying to brush off thoughts about Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>“How long have you been there?” she asked. “Have you eaten?”</p>
<p>“The director was looking at the male’s reproductive organ,” declared Gyu-baek.</p>
<p>“Gyu-baek!”</p>
<p>“Female peacocks value the colour and length of the feathers. Shape and pattern also matter.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon frowned. “Very picky peacocks.”</p>
<p>“The director also looks for excellent qualities in a male.” The child piped in confidently again.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“She is also picky.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was lost for words. She shoved a cookie into Gyu-baek’s mouth to shut him up. Out of habit, she checked him behind his ears for dirt. After making sure everything was clean, she handed him a glass of milk.</p>
<p>Gyu-baek pulled out a thick encyclopaedia from his bag and looked up at Lee-yeon again. His eyes were sharp and clear.</p>
<p>“Director, watch out for the elephants.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Be careful.” The child tapped a page of the book with his finger with a serious face.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Estrus of Animals</strong></em></p>
<p>It was the chapter that Gyu-baek had been reading lately. A huge elephant with its ears wide open filled half of the page.</p>
<p>“A male elephant, who’s thirsty for love, becomes a monster.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Male elephants turn violent when they are in estrus. It’s the time when you should never approach them.” Gyu-baek rambled on. His fingers tapping on the book as though he was anxious.</p>
<p><em>*estrus – heat cycle of animals</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“When estrus begins, the elephant’s temples swell and a viscous fluid flow through its skin.” It was quite a terrifying thing to listen to.</p>
<p>“They also become uncontrollably ferocious. Elephants who fail to control their emotions attack whatever might catch their eyes. The director needs to watch out for the male.”</p>
<p>Whether or not Gyu-baek knew the meaning of the term estrus, Lee-yeon was just happy to see Gyu-baek talking so passionately. Meanwhile Gyu-baek’s eyes didn’t stray away from the window. She was surprised that the child was showing interest in something other than insects and encyclopaedias.</p>
<p><em>Why is he so interested in Kwon Chae-woo?</em></p>
<p>“When elephants are ready to love—”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo seemed to be done with his workout, he entered through the door. Lee-yeon shoved another cookie into Gyu-baek’s mouth to shut him up.</p>
<p><em>They become blinded by love. </em>The child was about to say if not for the piece of sweet lodged between his mouth.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Gyu-baek is just a strange child. He doesn’t mean any harm by it,” said Lee-yeon on her way to the hospital in an old truck that had a faded ‘Spruce Hospital’ sticker on it. “He wasn’t calling you a lemur to be rude…”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Kwon Cha-woo.</p>
<p>“When he is obsessed with a topic, he just sticks to it no matter what.”</p>
<p>“I guess I am similar in that matter.”</p>
<p>Her hand on the steering wheel trembled. She could feel his intense gaze from the time she got in the truck. Kwon Chae-woo, seated at the passenger side, stared at her.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo, look ahead. Ahead.”</p>
<p>“But I’m not even driving, do I need to?”</p>
<p>“It will be no good for you if I cause an accident because of that.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to cause one?”</p>
<p>“Maybe!” She could somehow feel the heat on her skin. He sighed as if he wasn’t satisfied. But he turned his head away.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, I need an ID.”</p>
<p>It was a red light. Lee-yeon slammed the breaks so hard that she jerked forward almost hitting the steering wheel. Kwon Chae-woo was quick. He thrust his arms between her and the steering wheel, shielding her.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” he asked.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was hyper-aware of her chest pressing against his arms. She couldn’t even lift her head because she felt her face burning with embarrassment. She was aware of the fabric separating her n*pples from his arms. She felt a tingle down below and instinctively closed her legs. It was a weird sensation.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, what’s wrong? Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Nothing is wrong! I am fine.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon leaned back on her seat. “Um… Kwon Chae-woo, you are too close.”</p>
