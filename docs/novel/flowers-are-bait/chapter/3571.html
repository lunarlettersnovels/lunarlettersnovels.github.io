        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 212</strong></p>
<p>A simple case started to grow and became huge that involved police adhesion, drug, sexual harassment, and tax avoidance, and the assumption on who is really behind it all was everywhere.</p>
<p>Between all that, as conspiracy theory about Club Luna being involved with the current government showed up and the internet was a hot potato.</p>
<p>It was obviously the Kwon family that had real power in the dark, and Kwon Chae-woo was told to quietly get rid of Mr. Jang, who was the seed of all of this.</p>
<p>The room he stepped into contained a man who was all bloody and tied up.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo looked at the hunting dog behind him to leave and he was left alone with Mr. Jang.</p>
<p>“Get up.”</p>
<p>As his bored voice rang, the man got up and spat. “F*ck, that hurt!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“That’s why I hate the dogs at my place. The reason why you all became like this is all due to a lack of public education. You needed to learn wisdom and ethics instead of being chained, fucking bastards.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s face didn’t change at all the insult. The man lifted one of his knees and sat leisurely and then smiled.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while, brother. I heard you were in a vegetative state for all that time?”</p>
<p>It was Kwon Ee-joon, the second child of Kwon family who ran away, and is currently an elementary school teacher.</p>
<p>His face was so swollen from all the beating, but his dark brown colored eyes flashed familiarly.</p>
<p>His curly hair was pulled down to his eyebrows, and a piercing mark on his ear was clear. It seemed like his shirt was stretched from the fight and a tattoo could be seen.</p>
<p>Kwon Ee-joon frowned and smiled coldly.</p>
<p>“You know that I’ve been in deep trouble because of you, right?”</p>
<p>“Teacher, watch your language.” Kwon Chae-woo warned him.</p>
<p>“Since when did you ever care about my students?”</p>
<p>“I’m considering it.”</p>
<p>“Come on, it feels like you’re trying to kill my students in the classroom so stop it.”</p>
<p>The real identity of Kwon Ee-joon was that he was the black hacker who was the center of the anti-Kwon family.</p>
<p>To completely cut his ties with his family, he hacked the foreign bank accounts of Kwon family every 24 hours and his parents completely cut ties with him. There were tens of those secret bank accounts so they gave up after only four.</p>
<p>Kwon Ee-joon stared at his brother’s face.</p>
<p>“There will be more so stay alert.”</p>
<p>Kwon Ee-joon, who was planning on leaving the moment he came to age, happened to stay a bit longer as his younger brother came back from kidnapping. But Chae-woo grew up tidily and wouldn’t give his brothers a chance, and Kwon Ee-joon felt disappointed as his parents just sent Chae-woo away abroad instead of warmly accepting him.</p>
<p>“You live in the house with Kwon Ki-seok now.”</p>
<p>“I’m not living with him, I’m watching him.”</p>
<p>“That bastard, he doesn’t even believe in hunting dogs anymore. He bought a bunch of Syrian killers recently.” Kwon Ee-joon said disgustingly.</p>
<p>“I know. I killed a few yesterday.”</p>
<p>Kwon Ee-joon gave him a glance of warning.</p>
<p>“Assume that Kwon Ki-seok is two or three steps ahead of you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You know right? That your head might be gone if you’re not careful. Even though we left you to take care of everything, you’re still a hunting dog. That you’ll be replaced the moment you’re of no use.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo scoffed. It was a hard laughter to see from the youngest, but Kwon Ee-joon didn’t like it at all. His scoff contained all kinds of cruelty.  But he couldn’t deny that fact that he put all his hand into that cruelty.</p>
<p>“That’s what I want. Kwon Ki-seok just kept on circling around me, and it’s more boring than I thought.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo cut the ropes off his brother. “Kwon Ki-seok can die even tonight.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Chae-woo.”</p>
<p>“But Kwon family will still exist so that’s no good. And right now—“</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo hesitated before continuing.</p>
<p>“He also has something of mine.”</p>
<p>His voice was grave.</p>
<p>Kwon Ee-joon circled his freed hands and sighed.</p>
<p>When he was little, he witnessed the dog house where they put little children to raise them as a pawn of the Kwon family. His way of thinking completely changed. That amplified as his parents didn’t change at all, even after having their youngest child, Kwon Chae-woo, kidnapped.</p>
<p>It might have been because he had witnessed the traumatic incident with the doghouse and his youngest brother’s kidnapping, but Kwon Ee-joon had always been soft-hearted when it came to young children.</p>
<p>This earned him the reputation of being “weak,” though it was for a reason as peculiar as his aversion to fish with eggs.</p>
<p>Since those days, Kwon Ee-joon had been actively working to break free from the dark traditions of the Kwon family and ensure the well-being of the younger generation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his association with a hunting dog that seemed to favor him had brought considerable wealth, even before Kwon Chae-woo, the Kwon family’s prodigy who had grown rapidly and become a source of fear, contacted him. This was all before Kwon Chae-woo fell into a vegetative state.</p>
<p>Kwon Ee-joon ran a hand over his lips, his expression wrinkling in thought. “You’re aware of the charity event hosted by the Mirae Group next week, right?”</p>
<p>“I am,” came the curt response.</p>
<p>“She’s not on the list, but the wife of the Pakistan ambassador will be attending.”</p>
<p>The Mirae group consisted of wives, daughters, and daughters-in-law of all the politicians and business people. The Kwon family offered their outside garden as a hosting place each quarter.</p>
<p>“This is the first chance in a while to give hell to Kwon Ki-seok,”</p>
<p>Kwon Ee-joon took out a strawberry candy out of his pocket and smiled.</p>
<p>“You don’t have anything valuable at home, right? If you do, make sure to move it.”</p>
