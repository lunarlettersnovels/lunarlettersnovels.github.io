            <p><strong>Chapter 214</strong></p>
<p>“Stop talking like that!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon closed her eyes tightly and nervously scratched her ear. Then, Chae-woo, who had regained his composure, grabbed her thigh and leaned his forehead against it.</p>
<p>“Now, just looking at my face annoys you?”</p>
<p>Although it was merely the hem of her clothing that had been pressed, Lee-yeon was startled, and Chae-woo, sensing her response, once again removed himself from her.</p>
<p>“I haven’t touched you recklessly all this time, I haven’t followed you around, and I haven’t received any compliment.”</p>
<p>The persistent gaze that carefully observed Lee-yeon’s complexion was indeed her husband’s, the one she remembered.</p>
<p>In an instant, something inside Lee-yeon snapped. She didn’t want to know what it was, so she raised her voice.</p>
<p>“Someone is sitting in front of my door, and you expect me not to be annoyed?”</p>
<p>“Then, just think of it as not a person.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon couldn’t help but laugh bitterly at his self-deprecating words.</p>
<p>“<em>It</em> is a total bastard anyway, so if you don’t like it, you should just see him as a plant.” Kwon Chae-woo said, referring to himself as “it.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, you cut branches well, right? Keep adding my restrictions, first, second, third, and each time, just cut off my limbs. And if I become completely useless, you can just water me a little each time.”</p>
<p>The man holding onto her thigh muttered with a sigh, and he suddenly looked so pitiful.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, Lee-yeon reached out and lightly touched his hair. Kwon Chae-woo immediately stopped breathing and looked up at Lee-yeon as if she were the sky. Even in the darkness, his eyes seemed to glisten.</p>
<p>It was a belated realization, and Lee-yeon quickly withdrew her hand, biting her lower lip.</p>
<p>It was a huge mistake, a disaster. Because…</p>
<p>“… Let me touch you too.”</p>
<p>His hand began to crawl up.</p>
<p>“Let me touch your belly, Lee-yeon.” He clarified.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>While Lee-yeon remained stiff, his husky voice traveled up her legs.</p>
<p>“Kwon Ki-seok touched it, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>With that one sentence, Lee-yeon was reminded of a fact she had forgotten. She had revealed her pregnancy to Kwon Ki-seok. She hid her fidgeting hand behind her back as if she were putting it aside.</p>
<p>“It’s not just anywhere; it’s your belly he touched. How can I see that and not turn away?” He protested.</p>
<p>“… Why the belly? What’s wrong with my stomach?”</p>
<p>“I filled that belly myself.” Kwon Chae-woo answered her plainly.</p>
<p>Time seemed to stand still for Lee-yeon. She forced a smile onto her lips and stammered, “W-What are you saying…”</p>
<p>nothing more than to hold the flustered Lee-yeon right then and shower her with kisses. But the harsh reality, which prevented him from doing so, caused cracks to appear on his impassive face.</p>
<p>Still, he couldn’t afford to intimidate her. Just like their first encounter, he had learned that he couldn’t predict what she might do when she was scared.</p>
<p>Making her feel safe was the right option for him, so Kwon Chae-woo decided to approach the matter of her pregnancy with utmost caution, at least until she ultimately returned to him.</p>
<p>“Did you forget that I used to cook for you?”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon grabbed the doorknob briskly, weighed down by self-reproach for entertaining inappropriate thoughts. As she did so, her thigh muscles tightened.</p>
<p>“Please don’t go, just allow me.”</p>
<p>“I won’t allow it.”</p>
<p>She wouldn’t care if he froze or died in the corridor. Lee-yeon abruptly swung the door open in front of him, then slammed it shut again with a resounding thud.</p>
<p>Eventually, after a defiant shower, she lay in bed and pulled the covers over her head.</p>
<p><em>Don’t care. Won’t care.</em></p>
<p>Lee-yeon repeated this mantra incessantly but ended up losing sleep that night.</p>
<p>From that day, a strange rumor had started circulating about the youngest master’s new habit – sleeping in the corridor.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I’ll leave work first, thank you for your hard work!” It was another evening of overtime, preparing for the charity auction, selecting flowers to decorate the garden. Lee-yeon habitually checked the time, calculating in her head whether Kwon Chae-woo had left yet.</p>
<p>Ever since that day, at midnight or dawn, there would always be a loud thud, as if something large forcefully hit the door. It was Kwon Chae-woo collapsing outside the door, his body losing all strength.</p>
<p>For several days now, Lee-yeon’s nerves had been worn thin because of a large dog guarding the door. It didn’t scratch or make any loud noises, but its silence seemed to suffocate her like a thin thread.</p>
<p>Especially when Kwon Chae-woo spoke in her husband’s familiar voice, somewhere in her lower back, warmth spread, and sweat formed.</p>
<p>“Miss So Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Then, someone neatly dressed in a suit blocked her path. Lee-yeon hesitated, looking around as if expecting someone else.</p>
<p>“We need to go together for a moment.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” The person looked oddly familiar. Where had she seen them before? She scratched her head, unable to recall.</p>
<p>“Director Kwon has requested your presence.” Jang Beom-hee remained polite, but there was a lack of friendliness in his eyes.</p>
<p><em>What kind of power could one have as a mere Eul (a low-ranking person)?<br>
</em><br>
With her vulnerabilities exposed through her pregnancy and Gyu-baek, Lee-yeon had no choice but to follow Jang Beom-hee silently into a separate building.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, she embraced her belly and chewed on her dry lips.</p>
<p><em>Wait, isn’t this where Kwon Chae-woo stays?</em> When she began to doubt, Jang Beom-hee, who had been quietly leading the way, suddenly turned around.</p>
<p>“I apologize.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
