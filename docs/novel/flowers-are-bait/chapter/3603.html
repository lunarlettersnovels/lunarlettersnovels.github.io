        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 180</strong></p>
<p>Those were the only words he managed to utter, squeezed out with great difficulty.</p>
<p>With no way to escape the piercing gaze of Lee-yeon’s cheek that he wanted to caress recklessly, Kwon Chae-woo found himself at a loss for where to direct his own gaze.</p>
<p>She appeared stiff and rigid, as if ready to step back or push away.</p>
<p>If he were to recall his own actions, such treatment would be well-deserved, but Kwon Chae-woo couldn’t suppress her uneasiness and grabbed her wrist.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes, which once cried out for love, now seemed dry and devoid of any familiarity as if looking at a stranger. It had only been a month since they parted ways, at most, yet it felt as if his place within Lee-yeon had vanished, making Kwon Chae-woo feel uncomfortably miserable.</p>
<p>Despite physically being in motion, it felt more like a mirage from this side.</p>
<p>Sweat trickled down his face.</p>
<p>“You should have stayed on Hwaido Island and never left that place.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Just why the hell are you in this―” The restrained voice trembled faintly.</p>
<p>“Why are you here, of all places!”</p>
<p>It was a fierce burst of anger, fragmented into multiple threads. Kwon Chae-woo, seemingly caught in a state of horror, let out a forceful exhale. Behind his outwardly composed gaze, there were swirling whirlwinds of inexplicable emotions.</p>
<p>“Do you even know where you’ve stepped your foot without any fear?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You can’t be here. If you stay here without knowing anything…”</p>
<p>A sudden dizziness swept over him, perhaps due to the overwhelming heat that surged up to his head.</p>
<p>Even the assumption of her, who had lived a simple life touching nothing but trees, entering the Kwon household sent a chill down his spine. In this land soaked with the blood of countless people, her presence, plump and innocent, left no room for relaxation.</p>
<p>“For the time being, until things are settled, you can’t be here.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo tightly closed and opened his eyes, forcefully pressing down on Lee-yeon’s shoulders. His gaze was filled with rejection and denial, pouring down like a torrential rain.</p>
<p>“Leave, go back.”</p>
<p>Then, Lee-yeon, who had flinched for a moment, firmly exerted strength in her gentle eyes and swiftly brushed away the man’s hand. It was barely even ticklish, at best, but amusingly, Kwon Chae-woo staggered.</p>
<p>The unfamiliar gaze, meeting his eyes for the first time, once again scratched at the depths of his soul.</p>
<p>“Since it’s bothersome, you can hear the explanation from Mr. Kwon Ki-seok.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“He’s my employer.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I heard a brief explanation on the way here. He said you’re the youngest master of this house.”</p>
<p><em>…What on earth is she talking about?</em></p>
<p>“He warned me to be careful because you’re the most ill-tempered person in this house. Although I don’t think we’ll have any direct encounters, I still ask for your consideration.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo furrowed his brow, trying to understand the words she was uttering, but it still sounded like a jest coming from a misaligned channel.</p>
<p>As he half-heartedly stared at her lips, his mind in a daze, Lee-yeon’s greeting, which completely overturned his thoughts, resounded.</p>
<p>“I’m So Lee-yeon, the arborist who will be in charge of managing this house’s garden for a month.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>His mind snapped back to attention due to her introduction that turned his insides upside down. He instinctively closed his jaw and as he unraveled her words, a flame ignited inside his eyes.</p>
<p>When she casually extended her hand, a wild laughter burst out from Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>She wasn’t the shy and easily startled woman she used to be. When it came to trees, she was assertive and strict.</p>
<p>As her emotionless face suddenly appeared, an indescribable hunger surged through him, as if hitting rock bottom.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo wanted to crush the small, delicate hand that was being extended towards him. His esophagus felt like it was burning, even though he hadn’t taken a puff of a cigarette. He clenched his fist and firmly grasped her hand.</p>
<p>“No, not that.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“My hat.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Please give me my hat.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon, who slipped out of his grasp with a slight wriggle, once again toyed with her palm.</p>
<p>“It’s something I treasure.”</p>
<p>In response, Kwon Chae-woo tightly crumpled the hat he was holding. Lee-yeon jumped and slapped his hand, then forcefully yanked the flattened, limp hat from his grip.</p>
<p>She lowered her head, gently tucking the recovered straw hat under her arm. Her determined steps and resolute posture, turning away without hesitation, made Kwon Chae-woo look pitifully feeble.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>Lee-yeon, it’s me. I’m back. I am your Chae-woo.</em>Those pitiful words were threatening to burst forth. <em>I remember everything. Why can’t you recognize me?</em> The man’s eyes grew cold.</p>
<p>However, as he stood still, Lee-yeon grew increasingly distant.</p>
<p>There were numerous reasons why he should stop here, why he must stop, but Kwon Chae-woo swiftly caught up with the distance that had opened. He forcefully turned Lee-yeon around.</p>
<p>“…Where are you going?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon grimaced lightly, her shoulder in pain from being held.</p>
<p>“Why are you so insistent on finding somewhere to go?”</p>
<p>“I moved in today and I’m preparing to work.”</p>
<p>“Stop it. Just stop.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo impatiently wiped his face.</p>
<p>“This is my house, and I have no desire to see you wandering around aimlessly every day.”</p>
<p>In an instant, Lee Yeon’s eyes turned strangely sharp as she boldly confronted him.</p>
<p>“Who do you think you are!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You’re younger than me, you little…!”</p>
<p>Lee Yeon quickly ran away, then abruptly stopped in surprise, walked slowly for a moment, and then engaged in a strange sprint, rapidly distancing herself.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo felt a throbbing sensation on his cheek, leaving him numb. It wasn’t an apparition, but it seemed as if he had been possessed by a ghost.</p>
