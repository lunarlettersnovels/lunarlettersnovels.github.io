            <p><strong>Chapter 150</strong></p>
<p>He was irked by her behavior, a far cry from the first time they had been together. She used to flinch every time he touched her most sensitive spot.</p>
<p>“Who is Lee-yeon’s first love?”</p>
<p>He stretched and pressed on her clit with his middle finger in. His lifeless eyes were quite different from his hands squealing in and out of the way.</p>
<p>She remained unresponsive. Kwon Chae-won spoke to himself, “I don’t understand why you’re so stubborn, but you’ll always be my first love.”</p>
<p>There was no reply.</p>
<p>“I don’t like to repeat myself,” he added with a hint of warning in his voice.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Tree.” Then Lee-yeon blurted out as if she were talking in her sleep.</p>
<p>“Tree? Is that bastard’s name Tree?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Do you know where he lives?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“What does he look like? Can you draw a sketch now?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s head has gone blank. He has not stopped for one second what he was doing. She sighed.</p>
<p>“Stop it. We are supposed to be sleeping, you know… Why do you have to do this while I’m sleeping peacefully…!”</p>
<p>She pushed Kwon Chae-woo’s shoulder, but he didn’t stir.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>As she muttered that, her hand that was rubbing her belly extended to three fingers.</p>
<p>“Is it so terrible for <em>a husband and wife</em> to play in bed together?”</p>
<p>“Gosh…”</p>
<p>“Why are you always so sensitive?” His thrusts persistently stretched her inner walls, scooping up the love juice, and arousing her. His crooked fingers slipped in and out.</p>
<p>Despite her efforts, Lee-yeon could not resist the effects of this ministrations to her.</p>
<p>The flame between her legs burned brighter and hotter. Lee-yeon was close to breaking out in a cold sweat as she bit her tongue, desperately trying to hide any visible reactions.</p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>The anxious moan came from Kwon Chae, not her. Before he knew it, his penis had made his presence visible through his pants and was stabbing at Lee-yeon’s pelvic area. Finally, she opened her eyes and glared at him.</p>
<p>“If you don’t take your hands off now, I won’t have sex with Kwon Chae-won again.”</p>
<p>His face, which had been straight all the time while caressing explicitly, was quickly distorted.</p>
<p>“Do you know what you did wrong?”</p>
<p>“Was my fingers too thin?” He said, spiting her even more.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Or did it hurt because my fingers are too callous? I should have washed it with my mouth from the beginning.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon took a deep breath as if meditating not to get caught up in him.</p>
<p>“It’s not that. You used to react very sensitively to my feelings!”</p>
<p>She fixed him with a cool, unreadable gaze.</p>
<p>“—But these days…”</p>
<p>“Can’t you recognize me anymore, Lee-yeon?” As he said this, he pinched her sensitive nub. The suction was akin to that of his mouth, so she almost groaned loudly.</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>However, once she began to feel uncomfortable, the pleasure transformed into a weighty weakness, rather than a source of pure enjoyment.</p>
<p>Lying helplessly under his power is not what Lee-yeon wanted. She doesn’t even want to affirm Kwon Chae-woo’s rudeness in this way.</p>
<p>Her voice rose in pitch.</p>
<p>“Don’t you care about my feelings?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Kwon Chae-won replied, his tone flat and devoid of any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Then why don’t you leave me alone in the first place?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon clutched her chest, feeling as if her throat was closing up.</p>
<p>“You’re the reason for my mood swings, several times a day,” she said.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo wrinkled his eyebrows and nibbled on her lower lip.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry over such small things.”</p>
<p>His lips were parting, and his tongue was pushing forward. As he licked and sucked, he touched the inside of Lee-yeon’s mouth.</p>
<p>The man caressed everything from the roots of her tongue, and the more he toyed with her reactions, the more she grew an unknown grudge.</p>
<p>“This bastard…” she whispered with a muffled voice.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo parted his lips and asked, “What did you say?”</p>
<p>“You bastard, you bastard…”</p>
<p>Her eyes, filled with disappointment, were welling up with tears. Kwon Chae-woo licked them away.</p>
<p>“Did you know that just now?”</p>
<p>The man deliberately played her sensitive spot and pulled out his finger at last. Her backside trembled, but Lee-yeon struggled not to make a sound.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo looked expressionless at the transparent liquid on his finger, and suddenly lowered his pants and spread it on the tip of his ruddy manhood.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to have sex with me again?” He dragged Lee-yeon’s hand to hold his veiny manhood. She tried to hold back as hard as he could, but it was useless. He held her hands together and made them clasp him tightly.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon freaked out at the strangely wriggling object in the palm of her hand, but soon afterwards, her hands moved quickly from top to bottom.</p>
<p>The heat of friction made her palms burn, but at the same time, something damp kept flowing out.</p>
<p>“I don’t know about Lee-yeon-”</p>
<p>He fixed his gaze on her trembling eyes as if he were sticking his claws into them. Even as his ragged breathing erupted intermittently, his relentless eyes did not waver.</p>
<p>His brow furrowed, and veins tightened around his neck.</p>
<p>“They like to be beaten up.”</p>
<p>Soon, Kwon Chae-woo’s hands began to bob so quickly that he couldn’t keep up. Her arms and wrists hurt, and her hands tingled.</p>
<p>Soon, his lips parted and heavy moans escaped.</p>
<p>When something hot broke above her hand, Lee-yeon felt dizzy from the strong smell.</p>
<p>“Shit, not having sex. Even if Lee-yeon doesn’t like it, I’m going to keep making it. Do you want to vomit?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s entire body relaxed into a state of blissful laziness, as if she had just run a hundred-meter sprint. Her belly pulsed with sensitivity, but she couldn’t muster the strength to lift her heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-won briefly kissed her ear and whispered affectionately,</p>
<p>“Tonight, we’ll have sweet dreams together.”</p>
