            <p><strong>Chapter 46</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon was climbing the mountain with a visiting bag to check the trees that was aided through the surgeries. Lee-yeon, who was used to walking on uneven ground, quickly pushed her way through the thick bushes and followed a winding path.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo stubbornly followed her all the way to the mountain, despite the many times she told him to return home. Just then, he snatched the visiting bag from Lee-yeon’s hand.</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Lee-yeon, who was walking forward without even giving a glance behind, stopped helplessly. Her face was as stiff as a statue.</p>
<p>“You don’t look okay.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Are you not feeling well? Or is it because you’re mad at me?” His sharp eyes studied Lee-yeon’s face.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that—”Lee-yeon did not finish her words and instead let out a sigh. Continuing her made up excuse was futile as Kwon Chae-woo could read her like an open book. Unlike her denial, her face was certainly telling him that she was not alright.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s intense gaze showed how determined he was to find out the cause that made her so unhappy. It was only then that her expression, which had remained looking sullen since they left the hospital, relaxed.</p>
<p>“It’s because I heard something shocking.”</p>
<p>“From who?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was unable to emit an answer.</p>
<p>“From the doctor?”</p>
<p>Seeing his brows scrunched together, Lee-yeon waved her hands. “No, no. Me! From me!” Shewas surprised at the panic her voice had unveiled.</p>
<p>If all the man’s strange behaviors were due to the symptoms of the disease, not to the blindness created by her lies, it meant Lee-yeon had another retreat route. However, she couldn’t understand herself feeling ridiculed rather than happy. She felt a heavy burden on her back.</p>
<p>“I must’ve been born under an unlucky star.” She said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I underestimated how f**ked up my life is…..” Lee-yeon muttered to herself as she slapped herself on the forehead.</p>
<p>“Stop it.” Kwon Chae-woo covered her forehead with his hand.</p>
<p>The leaves shook above their heads in the breeze, akin to the woman’s calmness before Kwon Chae-woo. But he didn’t know Lee-yeon was having an internal battle. She was a mess.</p>
<p>“Mm… there are many trees I have to check. Wouldn’t it be better for you to go back now?”</p>
<p>“Does that mean you want to be alone?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon avoided his gaze and scratched her head. The man raised his brows as if trying read her thoughts but eventually withdrew his gaze and stepped back. “Then I’ll just follow you from behind.”</p>
<p>“It bothers me.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know the way back. And taking the bus is still difficult for me. It’s all because I don’t have anything in my head except you.”</p>
<p>‘<em>He always pretends to be sick and weak only at times like this.’</em></p>
<p>As if to prove her thought, Kwon Chae-woo’s eyes were glistening like that of a wildcat, which didn’t match with his slightly pouted lips.</p>
<p>Just then, heabruptly turned his head.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>His eyes became sharp, and his neckline from below his ear to his collarbone was taut as a tugged string. Lee-yeon swallowed at the sudden change in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Deep wrinkles formed on his forehead. His face, focused on something other than her, was frighteningly serious that Lee-yeon felt like her existence was forgotten for a moment.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong―”</p>
<p>“When I give you a signal, don’t look back and run as fast as you can.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo grabbed Lee-yeon’s wrist and pulled her towards him. “You’re good at climbing trees. Can you climb this tree and stay up there for a while?”</p>
<p>In a moment of confusion, Kwon Chae-woo pushed her back. Hard. His hands felt scalding hot that Lee-yeon flinched in surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Kwaeeeee―!</strong></p>
<p>The ground shook. A chill ran down her spine at a menacing growl. Turning to where the sound was coming from, she saw a big, wild boar running down from the uphill.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo!”</p>
<p>“Go up, Lee-yeon! Now!”</p>
<p>It was a harsh voice. Scared witless of his authoritative gaze, Lee-yeon climbed up the tree like an obedient child. Her feet slipped, and her hands trembled.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo opened her visiting bag, and without hesitation, pulled out a hatchet and several stakes.</p>
<p>“Ouch…! Kwon Chae-woo, don’t do anything risky! That’s used for cutting down trees, not for slaughtering animals! I’ll call the rescue center, so come up first!”</p>
<p>She grabbed a branch and stretched out one hand. But the man did not listen. Biting her lips, she turned on her phone in a hurry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kwon Chae-woo was axing a tree. The time he spent striking the tree dozens of times was only a few seconds. After a few more hits, he managed to make a groove in the tree.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo, what are you doing? Run!”</p>
<p>The wild boar was approaching fast, but the man was still axing the tree.</p>
<p>“Stop! Put that down!”</p>
<p>He didn’t listen and continued what he was doing.</p>
<p>“I said put that down!”</p>
<p>“Just stay there still.”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to die or something?!”</p>
<p>“Haha.” Kwon Chae-woo laughed although there was nothing funny about the situation. “There is only one reason why dogs turn their backs.”</p>
<p>At his calm reaction to the boar, Lee-yeon was lost for words. She couldn’t understand what was going on in the man’s head.<br>
