        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 163</strong></p>
<p>Whenever she feels depressed, she looked at trees.</p>
<p>She sent away Choo-ja who was hanging around at the front door, then started to look at all the record of patients. It was a few years of hard work and now, she even cured the ones that she thought couldn’t be saved.</p>
<p>Starting that day, Lee-yeon started to study again. She opened the books as if to recount the knowledge she lost and read the thesis that was piled up.</p>
<p>She reviewed other hospital’s charts that were being shared and read all kinds of papers to try to recover her root that was shaken.</p>
<p>Then she remembered something—</p>
<p><strong>‘It’s been a while since you became useless.’</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘I told you you’re no longer useful to me.’</strong></p>
<p>She was a fantastic tree doctor that could cut off the branches, cut off the part that was gone, fill the holes, and do a complete makeover.</p>
<p>Even though Kwon Chae-woo scarred her to her core, there were parts that he could never ruin.</p>
<p><em>Ring, ring.</em></p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s neck became stiff. Until the moment she checked the name on her screen, she didn’t realize she stopped breathing. But the moment she checked who it was, her shoulders slumped.</p>
<p>“… Hello?”</p>
<p>She rubbed her face. And a weak voice came with a sigh.</p>
<p>–Lee-yeon, would it be ok to check the Spirit Tree first and then we’ll have to hand in the document at the Tree Agency.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>She couldn’t answer even at such a simple request.</p>
<p>–We’ve been delaying it using your prescription as an excuse, but this is it.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>–Are you listening?</p>
<p>“Just…”</p>
<p>She stopped her voice from shaking.</p>
<p>“Just a little longer.”</p>
<p>As she thought that she had to check the dead Spirit Tree, her fingers went cold.</p>
<p>The conversation she had with Kwon Chae-woo in front of the tree, the gift she got. It was a wooden flower that will never wither and the red part was his blood.</p>
<p>Looking back, that was the last of the man Lee-yeon loved. After that day, Kwon Chae-woo fell asleep for a long time and got his memory back.</p>
<p>“N, not yet…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon took a deep breath and wiped her forehead.</p>
<p>The feeling she was having was similar to rejection. The dead Spirit Tree felt like her stomped heart. She couldn’t see that awful sight.</p>
<p>–By the way, Gyu-baek hasn’t been seen lately.</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>–I’ll stop by his place. You just rest.</p>
<p>The moment the phone went silent, the silence hit her. Then she suddenly felt hungry.</p>
<p>She went to the kitchen to start cooking. She opened the fridge and took out all the side dish she could find. It seemed like Choo-ja cooked a new batch of rice as it didn’t smell anymore. She sat at the table.</p>
<p>“Hmph…!”</p>
<p>The side dish was still too salty. It felt like she could smell something weird but she still couldn’t stop eating.</p>
<p>Last time, Choo-ja tasted all the side dish and looked for garbage. But it was Lee-yeon who stopped her from throwing it all away.</p>
<p><strong>‘Yoon Joo-ha.’</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The name of the woman you surrendered for money.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘She died in that house.’</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon shoved spoonful of rice in her mouth and then the side dish. She didn’t even chew properly and swallowed and then she looked for water to wash it down.</p>
<p>But she had to eat it somehow.</p>
<p><strong>“Mother was held captive in the basement of our hometown for seven years. Right beneath the room where I slept. She never saw the light of day and emerged from there like a lifeless body.”</strong></p>
<p>It was his way of telling her that he wouldn’t listen to Lee-yeon’s claim of innocence, so she had to swallow it all.</p>
<p>To accept, to grasp, to understand, to take in the fate of loving is sinning from her life. To let Kwon Chae-woo find peace. To let him go, to digest this familiar resentment.</p>
<p>She will have to chew it all. She desperately swallowed everything.</p>
<p><strong>‘Why would I have to consider a woman who would lie about everything? You’re telling me to just swallow everything you spit out?’</strong></p>
<p>Even during all of this, his bloodshot eyes were clear to her. His look of contempt opened her stomach and his sharp words became like tattoo.</p>
<p>This might be the ending that was expected since the moment she lied, no, even way before all that.</p>
<p>The relationship between the offender and the victim. The result of the lies she piled up. All the problems that were tangled up like a ball of thread.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, she jumped up and ran to the sink, feeling nauseous. She vomited everything she had eaten and turned on the water, continuing to retch.</p>
<p>The reason her eyes were watering was because of this.</p>
<p>It was a night she couldn’t handle yet again.</p>
