            <p><strong>Chapter 55</strong></p>
<p>The moment Lee-yeon walked her way inside the hotel, fancy wreaths fall above her, making their way into her eyes. She tightly clenched Kwon Chae-woo’s arm that she was loosely holding.</p>
<p>A short sigh escaped her lips. In her head, she was all ready with her plans on ending this quick. <em>I’ll show my face to Chairman Lim and run.</em></p>
<p>Lee-yeon was clearly not comfortable with her outfit. Her stockings were tight around her legs and tickled every time she walked. She was desperate in folding her knees in and out. To top it all, square neck continued to reveal her collarbones.</p>
<p>She felt unfamiliar with herself. Wearing high heels, showing off her calves and slow pace.</p>
<p>“Do you feel nervous?” He lowered his gaze while escorting Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was busy wondering how despite his casually brushed hair, he looked differed because of a slight forehead show. His leisure demeanor was oddly stable making him look like an adult.</p>
<p>Her thoughts made it difficult for her to find a single place to stare.</p>
<p>She took her own sweet time before answering, “Not nervous, just a little uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>Her eyes travelled from his eyes till nose. There was a perfect ration between them. His sensual lips and chin line later gathered attention. He was a sight to be seen at a place like this.</p>
<p>“Are you Lee-yeon?” Jo Kyung-chun, the director of the D hospital, examined Lee-yeon up and down; his eyes opened like a bull.</p>
<p>Her half-tied hair waved whenever she moved. Her white-tone skin and pretty facial features looked rather new. Director Jo couldn’t keep his eyes off. Her thick green dress outlined her thin body and smooth skin well.</p>
<p>“Wow, Hwang Jo-yoon would be surprised!”</p>
<p>“I’ll be off first,” Lee-yeon felt annoyed and walked past him coldly.</p>
<p>For a long time, she has used her fashion and smell to keep people away. It was her way of using thorns and it worked pretty well.</p>
<p>Of course, there were exceptions like Hwang Jo-yoon.</p>
<p>She was confident that her life was different from her parents. Love and emotion aren’t required in her life. Loneliness is the only way to save her.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, are you not feeling well. Should we leave?” Kwon Chae-woo held her hand tightly.</p>
<p>She suffocated and jerked his hands off.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not leaving.” <em>I’m not going to leave one step out of this line.</em></p>
<p>She pushed down what was coming up from her stomach and averted her attention to the people who were busy laughing.</p>
<p>“Director!” A woman walked towards them, waving her long arms. Being owner of an amazing body, she was wearing a black see-through dress that fit her curves perfectly.</p>
<p>“Umm, who are you?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon blinked in surprise. There was nothing more critical than for a director of a hospital to not recognize someone in a social gathering.</p>
<p>“I’m Joo Dong-mi!”</p>
<p>“Ah!” Lee-yeon exclaimed unintentionally. Joo Dong-mi looked complete different from her previous version with no makeup and her big, oversized coat.</p>
<p>“Hi.”</p>
<p>“Wow! I never imagined meeting you here!” Tall and thin, flowing short hair and elegant makeup made her look quite urban. Lee-yeon watched Joo Dong-mi pass her glass of champagne to the server. It was smooth as if she was familiar with that setting.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon questioned herself. Was she mistaken considering Joo Dong-mi, looking like a fancy carnivorous beauty, looked more natural to her than the Joo Dong-mi that looked plain in the emergency room?</p>
<p>Joo Dong-mi blinked one of her eyes adeptly as if she heard Lee-yeon’s question. She remarked, “My uncle is the guest of honour tonight.”</p>
<p>“Chairman Lim?”</p>
<p>Joo Dong-mi smiled and nodded without a word. She lifted the tip of her lips thickly when her eyes caught Kwon Chae-woo nicely dressed. Lee-yeon felt like her throat swelled.</p>
<p>“You said you’ll tell me your name when we meet again.” Joo Dong-mi tilted her head confidently.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo stayed silent. His eyes were chasing Lee-yeon tenaciously with an unknown expression.</p>
<p>Joo Dong-mi noticed his unwavering gaze and soon changed her target. “Can I talk to your employee alone?” She was clearly asking Lee-yeon to leave.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was about to step back as she was trying to negate her face hardening with a smile when Kwon Chae-woo whispered quietly near her ears, “You’re not paying attention,”</p>
<p>In the party full of all kinds of beautiful and loud noises, Kwon Chae-woo’s soft voice shook her like a thunder.</p>
<p>“You should behave well like a married woman. Lee-yeon, there will be no forgiving for your mistakes this time.” He said, awaiting her response.</p>
<p>She stuck her neck up, it was starting to get very suffocating. To her displeasure, her thin bones lining collarbones stuck out too. Before she knew it, her heels were briskly walking away from everything, dodging Joo Dong-mi, champagne, and dresses. Lights, and Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>She didn’t stop until she was enveloped with the chilly air of the night.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lee-yeon sighed in relief. This place was less suffocating and little better.</p>
<p>As she mindlessly walked in the garden, many round trees cut ‘nicely’ from human’s perspective appeared.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon pushed down all those random thoughts that were pushing down her heart and started checking their health.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Her back turned stern at an old voice. There was only one person this voice belonged to.</p>
<p>She turned around frowning. As expected, Hwang Jo-yoon, with big gauze on his forehead and nose, holding onto a crutch, was glaring at her. He became momentarily blank when he noticed Lee-yeon’s dress.</p>
<p>“What are you wearing?”</p>
<p>Even though she was seeing him in horrible state, she couldn’t feel any emotion. If anything, that bruised eye suit him well.</p>
<p>But if she were to feel sorry, she felt this emotion more for those trees wrapped by thousands of small light bulbs. These light bulb decorations ruin their growth. Bulbs slowly dries up their skin and leaves end up turning brown.</p>
<p>“You’re completely ignoring me now?”</p>
<p>She was snapped out of her train of thoughts. “The least you could do is say sorry!”</p>
<p>“Why should I?” Hwang Jo-yoon limped his way and pointed at her like putting a dart in her. “Your husband isn’t normal.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t, as well.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You think it’s normal for an educated person to rub his cheek against someone else’s window?” Lee-yeon responded drily.</p>
<p>Hwang Jo-yoon’s face flushed and in response, he glared at her.</p>
