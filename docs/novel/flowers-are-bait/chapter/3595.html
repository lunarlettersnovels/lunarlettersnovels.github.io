            <p><strong>Chapter 188</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon mechanically let out words that could have come straight out of a textbook. Her feet felt itchy for some reason, and she inexplicably broke out in a cold sweat. She wished the focus had shifted more toward dating and marriage than discussing children.</p>
<p>“I have taken care of all the necessary paperwork, so even if you remarry, it will be like a first marriage,” Kwon Ki-seok stated.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes… Th-thank you…?” Lee-yeon replied, her voice trembling slightly.</p>
<p>“And if there is anything you need for your fresh start, feel free to ask.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>He set the knife down and settled deeply into his chair.</p>
<p>“If you want to dig into a man’s past, go on an adventure, or explore your true nature.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyebrows twitched in a way that wasn’t quite a smile or a cry.</p>
<p>“I apologize, but it seems that Lee-yeon has a discerning eye for men. As someone who once bound and tormented Lee-yeon, I feel a sense of responsibility,” Kwon Ki-seok confessed.</p>
<p>She let out a dry cough.</p>
<p>“And if you happen to fall for another troublesome guy, that would truly be a waste of time. So, if you ever feel unsure about someone in the future, feel free to seek assistance.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“That’s something Chae-woo is good at,” Kwon Ki-seok said, nodding toward Lee-yeon, who was sitting slumped in a bored manner.</p>
<p>Was it the brittle silence that came first, or did Chae-woo burst into laughter first?</p>
<p>No matter how she looked at it, an impure smile was stitched onto Kwon Chae-woo’s face like a surgical scar. He nodded his head and continued to chuckle intermittently.</p>
<p>“That’s right, Lee-yeon. Just talk.”</p>
<p>His gently inclined head carried a strong sense of favor. However–</p>
<p>“I’ll even draw the appearance of that bastard, Oh, Hwang Jo-yoon for example.”</p>
<p>“…!” Lee-yeon was startled.</p>
<p>“So, I mean, you should definitely talk to me.” He clenched his teeth, his eyes promising danger to whoever would attempt to marry Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>Just then, the perfectly cooked fish arrived, emitting a savory aroma.</p>
<p>With skilled hands, Kwon Chae-woo swiftly removed the fish bones as if straightening a spine. Setting aside the cleanly lifted bones, he then carefully picked out the small, inconspicuous thorns one by one with precise chopstick movements.</p>
<p>Having finished the task instantly, he naturally pushed the plate of fish towards Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“Eat.”</p>
<p>His voice was firm. Though he had previously stared at people so intently it was rude, now he didn’t even make eye contact.</p>
<p>“I-I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes trembled at the corner. It was something he always did on the warm dining table, but now an unpleasant feeling  spread through her heart. A sense of refusal surged within Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“You eat it, then.” She replied.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If you did it, then you should eat it. Why should I trust something you offer? I already must be cautious about the food I eat…”</p>
<p>“Then do you want to eat the fish innards?”</p>
<p>He suddenly raised his eyes and spoke, breaking his silence. Lee-yeon hesitated momentarily, but no matter how you looked at it, the beautifully prepared fish didn’t feel like hers.</p>
<p>“But this is for you-”</p>
<p>“I don’t eat meals when you’re around, constantly pestering me.”</p>
<p>The maid standing nearby pulled the plate closer to Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>If Kwon Chae-woo’s pale complexion was any indication, the claim of not feeling well was not a lie, and his complexion had grown even paler than before.</p>
<p>Despite the tantalizing aroma of the savory grilled fish, he crinkled his nose and only sought water. However, even the water seemed to stay in his mouth without taking more than a few sips. Then, with a pained expression as if swallowing poison, his Adam’s apple bobbed. It seemed like he was dividing and reluctantly passing it down his throat.</p>
<p>“By the way, Lee-yeon, there will be an annual ceremony at the main house soon.” Kwon Ki-seok announced.</p>
<p>It was while she was silently observing the steaming grilled fish. As the topic shifted to work, she immediately turned her head, and she could hear a hissing sound from nearby.</p>
<p>“The garden management team will provide assistance, but there is a possibility that you’ll have to oversee the site personally.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please leave it to me.”</p>
<p>Yes, talking about work is better. Lee-yeon focused her mind with a newfound sense of comfort.</p>
<p>“If you drive to the back of the main house, there is a cottage.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, take a visit. The garden there needs to be cleared and replanted.”</p>
<p>“Such a large-scale project?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes widened in surprise as she had only considered tending to existing trees, not expecting such a significant undertaking.</p>
<p>“We must create a new ambiance to fit the event’s atmosphere. I trust your eye for choosing the right trees. With your skills, we will be satisfied, Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Kwon Chae-woo muttered profanity under his breath. When the gazes of the two brothers collided in silence, a long and heavy silence seemed to weigh down on Lee-yeon’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“If it’s Lee-yeon, she’ll choose trees people would love to <em>touch</em>.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p><em>What did he just say?</em> She doubted her own ears and stiffened in confusion.</p>
<p>“A garden that entices, allures, and discreetly conceals people would be ideal.”</p>
<p>“Um, excuse me… I may have misunderstood. Could you please clarify what kind of event it is?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s gaze fixated on a point near Lee-yeon’s ear. He casually wiped the dirty knife up and down as he smirked.</p>
<p>“An outdoor sex party.”</p>
