            <p><strong>Chapter 96</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon could feel the knot in her stomach become tighter. Her mind felt blank. She would have thought she was drifting off into space if Kwon Chae-woo hadn’t leaned down right in front of her face. Her hand came up to caress his face.</p>
<p>“You’re really Kwon Chae-woo, right?” she asked. He nuzzled into her palm and she relaxed. “You really came back, right?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo could tell that Lee-yeon was talking more to herself than anything. He would have been upset if her soft eyes weren’t staring right up at him and her hand wasn’t holding his face.</p>
<p>“More,” she whined. “Chae-woo, more please.”</p>
<p>Obliging, Kwon Chae-woo moved faster and deeper.</p>
<p>Between her moans, Lee-yeon said, “I won’t come like last time. Tonight, we’ll go for as long as we can.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo narrowed his eyes. “Stop talking,” he told her. “If you don’t stop talking, I’ll come in your mouth.”</p>
<p>He was pounding his cock in and out of her mercilessly. It was rushed and primal, the hospital room becoming hot from all their panting. As Lee-yeon tried to bite back a moan with her lips, Kwon Chae-woo kissed her deeply, swallowing her sounds. He felt himself grow harder.</p>
<p>“Do you like it when I pull out?” he asked her, his breath hot on her ear. He watched her reaction as he slowly pulled out of her and quickly thrust back inside. Every time he shoved his cock in, he could see her tremble and squirm. It felt like he was playing a game and he had just managed to make a critical hit.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon writhed in pleasure as his thrusts became deeper and harder. She was growing wet with every little thing that he did and that only made Kwon Chae-woo pump into her faster. She liked feeling his thighs slap against her own and the loud, wet sounds they made when they collided.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why you’re trying to turn me on,” Kwon Chae-woo groaned. He looked down at where the two of them connected and nearly drooled at the sight of her juices coating his length. “You don’t get anything out of it.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he pulled out of Lee-yeon. Before she could even react, he had already flipped her over. He lifted her hips and pushed into her from behind. She was moaning loudly before she could even react to the primal position that they were in.</p>
<p>He was reaching deeper inside of her in the new position. She could feel the pleasure build in her head. The more he moved, the more she felt like crying. With one powerful thrust, his tip slammed against her cervix and Lee-yeon fell forward, her face buried in the pillows as she let out cries of pleasure.</p>
<p>Continuing his punishing pace, Kwon Chae-woo grabbed Lee-yeon’s hips tight enough to bruise them. He pulled her against him and, as he bottomed out, he leaned down to her ear and asked, “Lee-yeon, is this how I do it?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon buried her face in the pillow and let the moans spill from her lips freely. He wasn’t just mindlessly shoving his cock into her; he was making calculated moves. He would pull her to him and move his waist so that he could move within her before continuing his brutal assault on her pussy. Lee-yeon was crying at the amount of power and control that her husband was displaying.</p>
<p>Then, she felt the knot within her break. Her whole body shook as an orgasm took over her. Kwon Chae-woo gritted his teeth when she tightened around him and soaked him in her juices.</p>
<p>Despite her mind-numbing orgasm though, Kwon Chae-woo was still thrusting into Lee-yeon hastily. She didn’t even have the chance to catch her breath and she was already being shoved back into the bed. “Chae-woo!” she exclaimed, hoping that he would give her a break.</p>
<p>She felt his cock slip out of her and she heard him rub himself until she felt a hotness spread across her back. She didn’t even have to look to know what it was.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon collapsed onto the bed and let her body press all its weight into the mattress. She could hear Kwon Chae-woo swear under his breath as he grabbed a towel and wiped her back. Then, he flipped her over.</p>
<p>They lay there for a moment in silence before looking to see one another clearly.</p>
<p>For someone who had just had an orgasm, Kwon Chae-woo looked eerily calm. Even as he panted loudly, his eyes were solemn as they looked at Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>Unable to control herself, Lee-yeon looked at his sculpted form. She inhaled and she could smell his musk deeply. The smell of his sweat as the fucked was intoxicating, she could feel herself melt from just that.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Kwon Chae-woo spread Lee-yeon’s legs and, abruptly, he shoved his cock back into her. From someone who had just come, he was still shockingly rigid.</p>
