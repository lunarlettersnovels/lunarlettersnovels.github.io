            <p><strong>Chapter 94</strong></p>
<p>His breath caught in his throat.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon looked up to see him staring off. There was a silence between them and, eventually, Kwon Chae-woo broke it by licking his lips nervously. Lee-yeon just held her breath and stared at him, waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon,” Kwon Chae-woo finally said. “Were you hurt?”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer. Whatever suggestive comment she had made seemed to be pushed to the side by his question. He was changing the subject. He even took a step back to put some distance between the two of them.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt here?” he asked, his hand coming close to her stomach but stopping before he could touch it. He remembered pushing her stomach when he kicked the backpack off.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Lee-yeon said as she glared at Kwon Chae-woo uncharacteristically. It had taken her all her courage to voice out her request and he had completely ignored her. She was embarrassed but, above all, she felt extremely challenged. In a quiet but firm voice she said, “Don’t get a job.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo couldn’t help but scratch his head at all. Lee-yeon’s unpredictability had thrown him off. “You don’t like your husband earning money?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You keep hurting yourself to save me,” Lee-yeon said, ignoring his question.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but laugh. “I think I should be telling you to not work,” he said. “I may not be a famous tree doctor, but I can’t earn enough to not let you starve.” He didn’t understand the innocent intentions behind her words and it made him restless, forcing him to close his eyes and place his hands behind his head listlessly. “Lee-yeon, don’t make me an incompetent man,” he said, but his voice was too soft for her to hear.</p>
<p>When he calmed down, he opened his eyes and looked at her. “We need to look ahead,” he told her. “I need a job so that we can manage our lives moving forward.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon frowned. She lowered her head and held Kwon Chae-woo’s sleeve weakly. “Even if I whine?”</p>
<p>“Whine?”</p>
<p>“Like if I said that you really, really don’t have to work and ask you to just stay home?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Will you really have to go out even if I whine?” Lee-yeon asked him. “This is the third request I’ve asked of you, will you not let me get what I want?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo stared at Lee-yeon as she played with his sleeve. It was similar to the way she was in the beginning, when she was frightened of him, but it was also different in some way. She was still afraid, but, this time, she wasn’t afraid of him. Instead of pushing him away, she wanted him closer to her.</p>
<p>He realized it was over for him now. She had ignited a fire within him that even he couldn’t put out.</p>
<p>“Are you nagging me?” he asked. “You want me to listen to my wife? Is that it?” Although he tried his hardest, he couldn’t hide the laughter that was bubbling beneath his words. “Why do you want me to be at home all the time? So you can bang me?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was startled at how quickly the tone had shifted. “Sorry?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo shrugged. “I could be going around and hunting wild animals, but you want me to stay home,” he said. “If that’s really what you want, then you’ll need to perform.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon looked at him, then, hesitantly, she asked, “How many times do you want it then?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care about numbers,” he said. “I just want to have you every night.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon blinked. “Kwon Chae-woo, there’s a reason why people only work five days a week,” she tried to explain. “People aren’t meant to overwork themselves.”</p>
<p>“So, you want to lock me up at home, but you can’t even let me have that?” Kwon Chae-woo asked. “That hardly seems fair, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>She looked away and avoided his gaze. She glanced at the door of the hospital room.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo walked over to the door and locked it. “Now,” he said in a warning tone. “Tell me if you’re hurt.”</p>
<p>As the tone shifted, the words he had used to change the subject earlier took on a different meaning. Her heart started racing as Kwon Chae-woo sat on the bed and tapped his thigh.</p>
<p>“Come here,” he said. He began to remove his hospital gown. There was a bandage over his shoulder that drew Lee-yeon’s focus on his hard abs. Lee-yeon blushed as she hesitantly stepped forward.</p>
<p>As she sat on his thigh, Kwon Chae-woo pulled her roughly by the waist. She could feel his hard cock press against her side. “It was like this since you asked me to hold you,” he whispered into her ear.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon turned to meet his eyes. Kwon Chae-woo just smirked.</p>
<p>“I got turned on when I saw you wearing that hospital gown,” he said. “They look a lot like your pajamas.” His voice lowered as he leaned in closer. “I held back because I thought that, if we had sex in the hospital, you wouldn’t be able to make a proper sound.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon swallowed. “You don’t know anything.” With that, she took his face into her hands and crashed her lips into his. Kwon Chae-woo was stunned at the sudden action but, as her smell began to fill his senses, he relaxed into the kiss.</p>
<p>She bit his lower lip just like Kwon Chae-woo usually did. He flinched at the unfamiliar sensation. He let out a breath and pulled her in closer, his grip on her waist becoming firm. He opened his lips and her tongue pushed against his wildly.</p>
<p>He let out a moan as he felt her hot breath against his skin, then continued to kiss her like it was all that mattered.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s back curved and she was pulled against Kwon Chae-woo. She was on cloud nine.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo grabbed her thighs and pulled her closer to his cock. Every time they pulled away from the kiss for air, a wet, sloppy sound filled the room. Eventually, Kwon Chae-woo moved his lips away from Lee-yeon’s and began to suck on her earlobes. A shiver ran through her spine as his lips lowered to her neck and bit into her skin.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon let out a moan as she felt heat begin to build between her legs. She felt him reach under her shirt, then, suddenly, he froze.</p>
<p>“Where’s your bra?” he growled.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon whined at the loss of contact and pulled back to look at Kwon Chae-woo. “I don’t have any spares…”</p>
<p>“And your underwear?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. She saw Kwon Chae-woo inhale sharply before he pulled the hospital gown from her. He held her breasts in his hands and, groaning, he latched onto her nipple. Lee-yeon let out a moan. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/lunarise"></a><strong>Hi!
