        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 6</strong></p>
<p>She was frightened to death. Her heart was racing fast, and her chest could explode anytime. All she wanted at the moment for ground to cut open and swallow her whole.</p>
<p>Yet, Lee-yeon somehow pulled herself together. “Kwon, Kwon Chae-woo. Kwon Chae-woo.”</p>
<p>On receiving no response, she gulped. “You don’t seem to be in a good condition right now,” she with trembling hands reached out to her phone, “I’ll call you a doctor!”</p>
<p>When Lee-yeon and Choo-ja were off to work or were away for a house call, the medical staff Kwon Chae-woo’s brother hired was expected to be on his toes. Reaching their expectations, the medical staff who took care of Kwon Chae-woo was always on standby. He was supposed to come in through the back door they had secretly built when constructing the second floor. He was so far discharging his duties diligently and being in charge of massaging, washing, drying Kwon Chae-woo, he was keeping a close check on the equipment. There was only one thing that Lee-yeon was responsible for.</p>
<p>To take care of him until the real culprit is caught. <em>And not let him leave Hwaido.</em></p>
<p>She froze remembering the eventful day.</p>
<p>There was only one information that she received about him; his name being ‘Kwon Chae-woo’. Other than that, she had no idea who he was. Yet it was not difficult for her to guess, his family had great wealth and power, considering the second floor, which was built in an instant.</p>
<p><em>“It’s not difficult for me to make you a murderer</em>.” She shivered as those words began ringing in her ears.</p>
<p>She has never felt this helpless in any situation. Already, she was found guilty and had to pay a fine for making a false report to 112 because, by the time the police arrived, there was no one left at the mountain. And the person who hit Kwon Chae-woo with a stone flew in a jiffy.</p>
<p>It didn’t take her long to recall the words of policemen<em>– It’s either I went insane, or the world surrounding Kwon Chae-woo is in a way more terrifying place than I can imagine.</em></p>
<p>Once, she had tried visiting the police station but at the right time, she received a phone call from Kwon Chae-woo’s brother. He said he only called her to say hello, but when the call was over, a picture of him with the police chief was sent through a message.</p>
<p>She regretted the day her destiny intersected their paths. There wasn’t anything she could do. Nor her mind was in a position to find a way to escape. Even worse, she already gave up long before without even putting in the effort to fight. All she was hoping was that the man in vegetative state would never wake up.</p>
<p>Alas! He was there right in front of her. His stare was not definitely something she would ever classify as comfortable. Right in the moment her mind reminded her of that one thing she must do. <em>Never ever dare to bark at the opponent who can easily hush up the things.</em></p>
<p>Hence, to not rot in prison for a false accusation, despite her reluctance, she had to make sure that the murderer is in good hands. Wish, those hands weren’t supposed to be hers.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo. I know that you’re confused since you just woke up, but I’ll explain things slowly,” she took a deep breath fighting his gaze. “So, please let me go and stand up!”</p>
<p>The man had to react the opposite. Like her destiny.</p>
<p>He lowered his upper body and brought his face closer to hers. His giant shadow covered the bedside and an unfamiliar warmth pressed down Lee-yeon’s back. In the process, the tip of his nose touched her nape.</p>
<p>“What, what the…!” she screamed at the top of her voice.</p>
<p>The man didn’t budge. He was burying his nose and inhaling the scent of Lee-yeon’s body like a wild animal. His hot breath tickled her skin.</p>
<p>“Stop making a fuss and answer my questions.” His voice was rough.</p>
<p>Gulping the lump formed in her throat, Lee-yeon nodded quickly.</p>
<p>“Did you lock me up?”</p>
<p>“What?” she looked at him bewildered. His tone threw her off track. <em>Kwon Chae-woo, what kind of life did you live? Wait, why is he speaking extra politely?</em></p>
<p>“Or, did I lock you up?”</p>
<p>Her fear soon disappeared at the absurdity of the situation. She shook her head in frustration. “Absolutely not! What do you think of me?”</p>
<p>“It’s me who’s asking questions here,” he glared. “Why am I here?”</p>
<p>This time his voice was extra sweet. She was unfamiliar with the innocence he spoke. His polite question was no less than a threat to her. <em>But is it because I know his true nature?</em></p>
<p>When his tone of voice pressured her to answer, she spoke, “You are just a patient. You woke up after a long sleep.”</p>
<p>The silence stretched. She took it on her shoulders to convince him. This is the least she should be doing to save her life. “It’s, absolutely, not a dangerous situation. Please calm down.”</p>
<p>The man who was breathing heavily regained his normal breathing pace. Perhaps her words were convincing to his ears.</p>
<p>Since the day she’s here she has constantly prayed for him to remain vegetative. He shouldn’t have woken up. Things will get complicated in many ways as and when this murderer will begin to move at his will. How will Lee-yeon deal with his cruel and selfish nature? She wasn’t ready.</p>
<p>“But why are you trembling?” His hoarse voice scratched her ears and brought her out of her thoughts. Did she see a tinge of smirk on his face?</p>
<p>He added, “Did you do something wrong to me?”</p>
<p>“N… no?” Her eyes turned big at his audacity.</p>
<p>The strength pressing her body was gone in an instant. Her body turned over like a fried egg as he grasped her roughly. Her heart slowly started pounding and her ears could catch hold of the vibrations.</p>
<p>He brought his face dangerously closer to hers.</p>
