            <p><strong>Chapter 199</strong></p>
<p>When Kwon Chae-woo stretched his hands, Lee-yeon flinched and closed her eyes. Kwon Chae-woo finally realized what he was doing just until then and flinched as well.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon heard a calm voice while her hands her shaking.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I couldn’t send you off right away.”</p>
<p>It was the first apology she heard from him after they separated.</p>
<p>-Slap!</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s face became red.</p>
<p>“This fucking guy is tastier when you just mince him instead of taking his clothes off, f*ck…!”</p>
<p>Do Kyung-jin giggled.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was so frozen that she couldn’t even breathe properly. She moved her finger as her swollen finger felt weird, but it wasn’t a dream.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon clenched her fist.</p>
<p>When people slowly gathered after hearing Do Kyung-jin’s voice, he introduced Kwon Chae-woo as the new mask.</p>
<p>The first ones to gather around the already shirtless Kwon Chae-woo were some women. They brushed and touched Kwon Chae-woo’s bare skin and even touched his nipples.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon frowned. Her heart was pounding viciously.</p>
<p><em>Why are you standing still?</em></p>
<p><em>What are you doing?</em></p>
<p>She knew Kwon Chae-woo’s personality, he was shoving pieces of bottle down someone’s throat!</p>
<p>She felt absurd watching him helplessly being bullied. But as someone touched his buckle, Kwon Chae-woo swung his arm for the first time.</p>
<p>His mask fell off, and his sculpted face was revealed. The atmosphere instantly changed.</p>
<p>People already forgot about the woman who was being dragged in a jumpsuit and they were after Kwon Chae-woo, who they usually wouldn’t even be able to touch.</p>
<p>They slapped his face, spat, grabbed his pants, and poured wine down.</p>
<p>But Kwon Chae-woo’s face didn’t change at all. People went crazier watching him calm.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo gritted his teeth and touched his ears occasionally, but he didn’t resist to all the drunks. Kwon Chae-woo pulled attention towards him.</p>
<p>–Time is 00:57. We’re on standby.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo frowned and cracked his neck. He looked at So Lee-yeon, who was utterly frozen.</p>
<p>Because he was satisfied with how she didn’t ignore him and run away, but instead just staring at him without even blinking.</p>
<p>–… We.. are…</p>
<p>The in-ear disconnected.</p>
<p>Then it came back on.</p>
<p>–Some rat or asshole came in.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s face instantly turned cold. With that, the people who were surrounding him split.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>People were gasping.</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok, in clean three-piece suit, was dragging some naked man, who could be dead or unconscious.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo instantly realized that their mission failed and changed his face. There was no nervousness or anxiety in his face. There was just the face a young master who looked like he was having fun.</p>
<p>–Who’s the person listening to me on the other side?</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok took out his gun.</p>
<p>He took out the in-ear of the hunting dog he stole from and aimed the gun at it.</p>
<p>Those who are wearing in-ears will have their drumhead explode from the sound.</p>
<p>It was when Kwon Ki-seok was about to pull the trigger while glaring at Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon came out from the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Her legs moved automatically the moment Kwon Ki-seok took out the micro in-ear.</p>
<p>The moment he pointed the gun at the in-ear, Lee-yeon was reminded of Kwon Chae-woo who looked like he was on the phone. She couldn’t think of anything as all the different actions came together. No, there were so many thoughts that he started panting.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon went through the crowd, who looked like they wanted to watch or wanted to participate in the game.</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok pulled the trigger, and Lee-yeon ran to Kwon Chae-woo and undid his buckle.</p>
<p>Everything happened quickly.</p>
<p>As his drawer was revealed, Lee-yeon covered him in a hurry.</p>
<p>People were surprised by the sound of the gun for a moment but eventually looked at So Lee-yeon, who was able to unbuckle him when no one else could’ve.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stared at the man anxiously, who was gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo was trying to withstand the ringing in the ears from the exploding machine. His ripping eardrum was one thing, but he felt dizzy from such a strong shockwave.</p>
<p>His face flared up and veins popped. But people couldn’t tell whether that was from or from shame.</p>
<p>Only Lee-yeon, as she held down on his shoulders.</p>
<p>‘Hang on.’</p>
<p>Lee-yeon moved her lips without any sound.</p>
<p>The man was in a pitiful state, as he was yellow and red from the drinks that were poured on him.</p>
<p>His lips were busted, his eyes were swollen like a boxer’s. His good-looking top showed handprint, and around his nipples were scratch marks. All the degrading that happened was shown clearly. Lee-yeon bit her lips.</p>
<p>Eventually she put her thumb on his underwear and looked at Do Kyung-jin.</p>
<p>“I can take this off, so the game is over, right?”</p>
<p>She wanted to divert attention from Kwon Chae-woo, from Kwon Ki-seok who had a lead.</p>
<p>She had to look casual, but her voice was shaking. Even so, her voice sliced through the air.</p>
<p>Do Kyung-jin kept blinking his hazy eyes. Even though he was insensitive to violence and obvious flirting, Kwon Chae-woo was surprisingly calm.</p>
<p>“Such a trash family…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon mumbled coldly as she pulled down his underwear quickly and backed up again. His erected penis stopped it from going down, but Lee-yeon let go of the band quickly as she was flustered.</p>
<p>She felt like she became one of the offenders in this party so she wasn’t pleased. It was hard to look at Kwon Chae-woo straight.</p>
