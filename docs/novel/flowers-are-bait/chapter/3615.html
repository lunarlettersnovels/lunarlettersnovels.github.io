            <p><strong>Chapter 168</strong></p>
<p>As the wind blew, a new version of Lee-yeon emerged, and Choo-ja closed her eyes in response. “Honey, are you watching? Your niece has grown up so well. The withered little girl is now smiling like an adult. She used to break and cut, but now she has bloomed like a sturdy tree,” she thought.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon looked back at the towering peak, barely containing her trembling lips. She had so many things she wanted to say, but if she had to say only one thing – “Good night.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon finally placed a white flower on top of the tomb.</p>
<p>It was for her first love, who was sleeping deeply inside her heart.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to wake up now.”</p>
<p>For her, he had fallen asleep in the forest forever, there was no need to wake him up anymore.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em><strong>Tut tut tut…</strong></em></p>
<p>The sound of a vital sign monitoring machine flowed indifferently in the room.</p>
<p>“Young master…”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee looked at Kwon Chae-woo, who was sleeping like a dead man, with a depressed gaze.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo had collapsed as soon as he got in the car and had been in a deep sleep for several weeks. The man, who had awakened his central nervous system with his mental strength and medication, fell into a deep sleep as if he were trying to release all the accumulated fatigue at once.</p>
<p>“You have been dragging on for too long.”</p>
<p>He still couldn’t understand why Kwon Chae-woo had to stay by So Lee-yeon’s side so desperately.</p>
<p>In such an unstable state, it was infinitely difficult to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee was an orphan who was “supplied” to the Kwons from an orphanage. He was brought here as a child, knowing nothing, and raised like a hunting dog in a cramped and stuffy place, killing his humanity.</p>
<p>He started helping Kwon Chae-woo because of his alienating gaze that always looked towards somewhere else, even though he was of the same bloodline as the Kwon family.</p>
<p>Children who couldn’t withstand the training disguised as abuse disappeared without a trace, with several disappearing every day. Those whose bodies or minds were too damaged to be of any use were mercilessly disposed of.</p>
<p>Watching fellow orphans from the same daycare center disappear one by one, Jang Beom-hee felt anger instead of vague fear. With that motivation, he became an exceptional hunting dog and met Kwon Chae-woo, who had the same eyes as him and was the youngest son of the Kwon family.</p>
<p>The plan had already been laid out two years ago. If Kwon Chae-woo hadn’t been to coma, they would have finished it long ago.</p>
<p>The witnesses handled by the past hunting dogs, the dirty incidents buried by them, and the decisive evidence that could change the history of the country. It was a situation where all the controversial issues could be brought to light by simply igniting dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>In order to intervene in next year’s presidential election, other information agencies were brought in, and numerous dirty information had already been collected in Kwon Chae-woo’s hands. That’s not all. Suguk Pharmaceuticals planned to expose the inhumane experiments they had been committing worldwide, putting pressure on the entire country.</p>
<p>The intricate brainwashed individuals, who were prepared meticulously through various channels, were all ready to move towards one goal. To bring to light the existence of the Kwons, which had never been revealed in over 80 years, and to expose the truth that a single gangster family had shaken and controlled the country.</p>
<p>To achieve this, they secretly sent government officials who had rebelled against the Kwons overseas, who had disappeared without a trace. They especially worked hard to secure the support of the media and legal professionals who were under the most pressure from the Kwons.</p>
<p>Of course, this was an external matter, and internally, as a gangster family, they had to deal with Kwon Ki-seok. Since he came from a prestigious family, they couldn’t just kill him off like it was nothing. But eventually, he would surely be swept away by a storm of bloodshed.</p>
<p>The problem was that all these plans were at risk of being distorted because of the irregular sleep pattern of the young master.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ziiing. Ziiing.</strong></em></p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee cut off her complicated thoughts and calmly answered the phone.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>-How is the child?</p>
<p>“He’s being taken care of well.”</p>
<p>-Be sure to take good care of him so that he doesn’t get any scratches.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>-But if necessary, you can educate him as you see fit.”….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If it’s more convenient to use, then that might be the way to go.” So for the first time, Jang Beom-hee joined Kwon Ki-seok’s plan.</p>
<p>“Take good care of Lee Gyu-baek.” That was the most feasible way to call So Lee-yeon. While it was still unclear why Kwon Ki-seok was so fixated on Lee-yeon, their goal was the same: to bring her to the Kwon family.</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee looked at the sleeping master, who knew nothing, and closed his eyes tightly. “I’m sorry, young master.” He needed someone to wake him up every morning.</p>
