            <p><strong>Chapter 221</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon walked into the office with an empty lunchbox in hand. Worried that she might attract unwanted attention, just like at the last party, she decided to take a detour around the building and head towards the promenade.</p>
<p>Glancing at the massive outdoor garden that seemed to be at least 20,000 square feet, she noticed the sound of an auctioneer’s voice over a microphone, introducing artworks and ceramics, but she didn’t pay much attention.</p>
<p>Even though it seemed like Gyu-baek might be in the front row, Lee-yeon wasn’t particularly interested in this event.</p>
<p>She thought, “I’ve got plenty of time today, so I’ll spend it with Gyu-baek.” While walking along the promenade with this idea in mind, she spotted an elderly woman leaning against a tree, catching her breath.</p>
<p>Startled, she looked around, but there was no one nearby who could offer help. After a moment’s hesitation, Lee-yeon approached the woman and asked, “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me…”</p>
<p>The elderly woman straightened her posture with a deep breath, wearing an elegant attire that seemed out of place. Lee-yeon quickly assessed the woman’s condition, but she appeared strangely troubled and apprehensive.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon had initially tried to walk past the woman quietly, without further involvement, but after a few steps, she hesitated and turned back. This was because, from her perspective, this seemed to be related to a tree.</p>
<p>“Um, what you’re touching right now, that’s an oak tree.”</p>
<p>The elderly woman, who had a white handkerchief at her lips, turned her attention in this direction.</p>
<p>“It seems like you are having an allergic reaction.”</p>
<p>The elderly woman’s stern expression softened, and she blinked her eyes. There was a noticeable red rash on her arms and neck. If one hadn’t been exposed to oak trees before, they might not have recognized it.</p>
<p>“Let me guide you to the medical room. You might need some antihistamines or medication.”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll go to my primary care doctor.” Her voice seemed strained, as if her throat was swelling. “It might be better to head back early today. Cough…!”</p>
<p>“Do you know the way back?”</p>
<p>Compared to the attendees of a sex party, the people attending were more refined, and the event was just beginning.</p>
<p>So, this should be fine, as long as they didn’t venture too deeply into the garden. Lee-yeon supported the lady’s arm and began to walk.</p>
<p>“It’s Marc Chagall’s ‘Portrait.’ It was officially valued at 3,000 rubles in Russia, but after being smuggled into the Western world, it was sold for $550,000. Now, it’s being presented on our side.” The lady murmured to which Lee-yeon nodded.</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon got closer to the garden, the atmosphere became more lively. The warm sunlight and the elegant laughter seemed to intermingle like expensive table settings.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stopped her steps at a point where the asphalt and grass were distinctly separated. She exchanged greetings with the lady at a suitable spot and watched her from behind as she headed to the medical room safely.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until she had confirmed that her companion was inside the room that she could finally divert her gaze.</p>
<p>And it was when she turned and exchanged a nod of acknowledgment with the servers, housekeepers, and familiar gardeners on the asphalt side.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh!!!”</p>
<p>A blood-curdling scream that sounded like it was being torn apart suddenly froze her legs.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s heart sank to her heels, and as her trembling eyes turned to look, time seemed to slow down.</p>
<p>There was a foreign-looking woman, her forehead pierced, bleeding profusely. The woman keeled forward without even closing her eyes.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Everyone froze, and a dreadful silence fell over the scene.</p>
<p>But before they could grasp the situation, the second and third shots came incessantly.</p>
<p>Somewhere, there was a continuous “tat-tat-tat” of bullets. Tables collapsed, glass bottles shattered, and the illicit goods on the stage became a chaotic mess.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this…!”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The ladies in the garden turned to panic and ran for cover, while the security guards inside the building rushed out. Dogs barked loudly, and someone screamed.</p>
<p>Even Lee-yeon, who had lost her composure, began to take a few steps backward. Everything that had stood upright was now shattered.</p>
<p>Then, Kwon Ki-seok, his expression icy and resolute, pressed one ear and moved his lips.</p>
<p>“Three minutes until the door closes. Get out of there quickly.”</p>
<p>As he heard the voice of Kwon Hee-joon filled with laughter, the sniper finally released his hand from the trigger. Following Kwon Hee-joon’s command, he unleashed a barrage of bullets, laying waste to the semi-circular stage.</p>
<p>While he was checking the 1.5 km distance through his scope, he unexpectedly locked eyes with Kwon Ki-seok, who was scanning the surroundings.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok seemed to be roughly pinpointing the sniper’s location based on the direction the bullets were coming from.</p>
<p>The man with a cold sweat on his back swiftly disassembled his rifle and left his position.</p>
<p>At that moment, Kwon Chae-woo, who had been protecting the sniper under the pretext of providing security, touched his ear. In the chaos where the wife of the Pakistani embassy was killed and the garden turned into a battlefield, Kwon Ki-seok gave orders in a slightly breathless voice.</p>
<p>“Kill them.”</p>
<p>The orders were unclear. When Kwon Chae-woo loaded the approaching sniper into a car.</p>
<p>“Kill the visible mansion staff from now on.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“From this moment on, the Kwon family becomes the victims of a shooting incident within the Kwon family.”</p>
<p>A shooting incident within the Kwon family.</p>
<p>However, there must be only one casualty from the visitors.</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok’s quick decision was made to avoid suspicion. Even with the unexpected attack on the Kwon family, he swiftly planned an escape route.</p>
