            <p><strong>Chapter 216</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyelashes fluttered. There was a warning siren in her mind, telling her not to watch any longer. However, she couldn’t tear her eyes away.</p>
<p>The scene unfolding before her felt surreal, almost like a television screen replaying her memories. The two of them together, it was like a window into her past.</p>
<p>The woman pulled Kwon Chae-woo’s waist closer, closing her eyes in comfort. A soft smile graced her lips. It was a genuine smile, not an act. It revealed a primal satisfaction that emerged when melting into someone’s touch.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kwon Chae-woo leaned towards the woman, wrapping his arms around her waist.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s throat went cold, and for some inexplicable reason, she felt suffocated. It was an insignificant movement, yet it felt monumental and chilling, like a thunderclap.</p>
<p>At that moment, as her temperature rose steadily, Lee-yeon realized the underlying strength she possessed.</p>
<p><em>We must go our separate ways, </em>she had insisted but he stubbornly clung to her. As Lee-yeon embarked on a new life, Kwon Chae-woo was supposed to embrace a new day.</p>
<p>“Perhaps… he never really wished to live,” she thought.</p>
<p>The intense emotions she thought she had left behind still lingered, even in her dreams. Lee-yeon’s face twisted as she witnessed the sudden burst of passion.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a mere unrequited love; it was more perplexing, a deep-seated resentment for a life that couldn’t be saved.</p>
<p>She couldn’t look away as the couple on the bed grew more intimate. The man’s strong arms around the woman bothered her. Her heart raced.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, drawn by the familiar scent, leaned into the woman’s…</p>
<p>In an instant, Lee-yeon shut her eyes tight.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>“Master!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear whose scream came first, but Jang Beom-hee’s cry echoed first. Lee-yeon opened her eyes to see Kwon Chae-woo, who had grabbed the woman’s hair, attacking her as if he had been waiting for the right moment.</p>
<p>With his half-closed eyes, he forcefully pushed the woman away. She screamed and clutched her scalp, and Kwon Chae-woo grabbed her by the neck.</p>
<p>In no time, she was overpowered, gasping for breath and choking. Jang Beom-hee was already trying to restrain Kwon Chae-woo, and Lee-yeon had fled.</p>
<p>The once-quiet bedroom had turned into a chaotic battleground.</p>
<p>“Master, please calm down!”</p>
<p>“Damn it, my… that son of a…”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo snapped like a broken tape, his unfocused gaze unsettling. Whether it was due to sleep or the effects of some drug, his eyes seemed even more eerie as a result.</p>
<p>He seemed to be attempting to regain his composure, deliberately biting his lip hard enough to draw blood. His parched tongue then ran over the wound, leaving a smear of crimson on his lips.</p>
<p>His unsettling behavior left Lee-yeon feeling sickened. If there had been a knife in the room, she suspected she might have used it free the woman.</p>
<p>“Please sir, let me go!” she implored.</p>
<p>“Beom-hee, are you trying to boil me alive?” he chuckled maniacally as if losing his mind.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo tightened his grip on the woman’s neck, and she cried out in terror. His eyes, devoid of sanity, darted around as if trying to focus on something.</p>
<p>“Where did you get these clothes? Where is the owner of these clothes?” Kwon Chae-woo muttered incoherently.</p>
<p>The woman, gasping for breath, could only sob in response.</p>
<p>“What’s the meaning of wearing these clothes, pretending to be someone you’re not?” Kwon Chae-woo continued, his face chillingly stoic. “Why do I smell this familiar scent?”</p>
<p>The woman continued to plead for her life, but Kwon Chae-woo was relentless in his questioning, shaking his disoriented head.</p>
<p>“Where is Lee-yeon? Where is the owner of these clothes? Did you steal them? Did you take what you didn’t want?”</p>
<p>In a sudden burst of movement, Kwon Chae-woo’s shoulders heaved, and Lee-yeon seized the opportunity to step between him and the woman.</p>
<p>“Calm down!” she urged.</p>
<p>She gripped the man’s cheeks hard, causing an audible smack. Kwon Chae-woo, as if he had snapped out of a trance, immediately released the woman and brutally shifted his attention to Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>The transformation was so swift and savage that Lee-yeon involuntarily flinched, her fingers twitching.</p>
<p>His frenzied actions came to a halt when he seemed to recognize Lee-yeon. His mania subsided, and he pressed his lips against her fair neck in a natural, inevitable movement.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, did… did I almost… get forced?” he stammered.</p>
<p>“What?” Lee-yeon replied, taken aback.</p>
<p>“Damn it, what should I do? Was I deceived? Did someone else have me?” His lips brushed against her skin with each word, tingling.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s brows furrowed. “What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“That insane woman, she wanted to have me. Wearing your clothes, as if it would change anything.” His incoherent rambling mixed with sobbing breaths.</p>
<p>“No, no, it wasn’t her intention,” Lee-yeon began, but he cut her off.</p>
<p>“It was strange. I nearly… I was helpless. She wore your clothes. She smelled just like you. What did she want to happen?”</p>
<p>His words scattered aimlessly alongside his sobs and breaths.</p>
<p>“No, it wasn’t like that. Her intentions were not like that,” Lee-yeon tried to explain.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen you and tasted you, but I could be deceived by your scent alone…”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo continued to rub his face against Lee-yeon’s neck, seemingly unable to control himself, and his words grew increasingly incoherent.</p>
<p>“It’s strange. I can’t feel anything on my body. How long, how long was I asleep?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon remained silent.</p>
<p>“My… it feels strange. Damn it, my body feels off, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon shot a furious look at Jang Beom-hee, who responded with innocence. “What the… Is that even a sleeping pill? Are you sure you used sleeping pills? What kind of medicine did you put in there?!”</p>
<p>Then Kwon Chae-woo abruptly reached into Lee-yeon’s clothing, trembling. He choked back a sob.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, someone else touched my… They keep forcing me, violating me… ”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon ordered, “Get out, all of you, right now.”</p>
<p>She raised her voice, pushing Jang Beom-hee and the woman out.</p>
<p>Until then, no one noticed that Kwon Chae-woo’s eyes were completely dry.</p>
