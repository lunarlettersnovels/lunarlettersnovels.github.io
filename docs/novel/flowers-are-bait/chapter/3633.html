            <p><strong>Chapter 149</strong></p>
<p>In the quiet stillness of the night, Lee-yeon lay wide awake, her gaze fixed upon the ceiling above. Suddenly, she was disturbed by the rustling of her bed sheets.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, are you having trouble sleeping?” Kwon Chae-woo’s deep voice interrupted her thoughts, his strong hand gently tapping the side of her head. The heat of his breath was palpable, settling against her cheek as he leaned in close.</p>
<p>She pulled the thin summer blanket all the way up to her nose and only twitched her brows.</p>
<p>“I drank coffee earlier when Chae-woo weren’t here,” she admitted.</p>
<p>“Why did you do that?” Chae-woo asked.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t fall asleep. I thought I would stay up until you fall asleep first.”</p>
<p>There was a brief moment of silence as Chae-woo considered her words. His lips twitched slightly, the only indication of his thoughts in the darkened bedroom.</p>
<p>“These days, I always fall asleep first,” Lee-yeon continued. “But when I wake up, you’re already awake.”</p>
<p>“Is that a problem?” Chae-woo asked.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not a problem,” Lee-yeon replied. “But it would be nice if it changed for a day.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo looked at her eyes without a hint of sleepiness and pressed his mouth in a thin line.</p>
<p>It has been two days since she hasn’t slept well, and she’s already reaching his limit. Her refusal to surrender to slumber was beginning to wear on him. He could only keep going with the aid of caffeine and prescription pills.But then, So Lee-yeon stubbornly refused to sleep too, and his mouth tightened involuntarily.</p>
<p>With a calm voice, he asked, “Didn’t you mention an appointment with Gyu-baek tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Lee-yeon muttered, as if she had forgotten all about it.</p>
<p>“Are you not planning on sleeping tonight?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon hesitated, as if there was something she wanted to keep unsaid. Her gaze met Kwon Chae-woo’s, stretching out like warm, pliant dough, refusing to break.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo thought that it would be better to turn off the concern, suspicion, or interest, and he abruptly reached into Lee-yeon’s pajamas.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was taken aback and grabbed the hand that had crept up on her clothes.</p>
<p>“What, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Just go to sleep like this. You were tired today, right?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo gently massaged Lee-yeon’s belly. As warmth spread through her chilly lower belly, Lee-yeon felt as if her body was melting into a hot spring.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time since I haven’t seen Kwon Chae-woo’s face when he’s asleep…!”</p>
<p>“Did you look at that face for a whole month and still want to see it again? Are you not tired of it?”</p>
<p>“That’s… ”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon longed for the moment when Kwon Chae-woo would awaken in her arms, wrapped in her embrace. At the time, his expression may have been impassive, but her view had since changed.</p>
<p>He has somehow changed.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>The hand that roamed the lower abdomen lifted up her pajamas and touched her underwear. Lee-yeon flinched and grabbed his wrist again, but Kwon Chae-woo didn’t care and rubbed her fold as if digging out with his fingernails.</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>She couldn’t help it, but she was out of breath.<br>
He squeezed his digits underneath her underwear and swept the fragile, smooth flesh at once.</p>
<p>There was a sense of pleasure as if sprouting from a sudden stimuli, but there was also discomfort.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo, stop it, I told you not to!”</p>
<p>She tightened her thigh and raised her upper body, thinking that this couldn’t go on. But her body was blocked by the man’s arm, and she fell back onto the bed helplessly.</p>
<p>“Just go to sleep like this.”</p>
<p>“Uh… How can I sleep in this condition? I’m not feeling okay!”</p>
<p>He quickly found a sensitive spot and pressed it cleverly, shaking it. Every time he tickled her, her breathing swelled as if it was about to burst, but Lee-yeon tried to hold back her moans and bite her lower lip.</p>
<p>The moment Kwon Chae-woo pressed his lips to her cheek-</p>
<p>“Go to sleep!” Lee-yeon fiercely turned her head and spoke firmly.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>The motion that had been grinding against her stilled for an instant, an intentional surrender by Kwon Chae-won. But, strange as it may be, her resistance only served to stir a feelingwithin him.</p>
<p>With a leisurely gaze, Kwon scanned Lee-yeon’s delicate jawline and the collarbone that jutted out sharply. Her desperate attempts to dodge his touch only fueled his mischievous spirit. A thick, calloused finger found its way inside the opening, eliciting a flinch from its recipient.</p>
<p>“Oh..!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s brow wrinkled relentlessly.</p>
<p>“You know what? Lee-yeon only persecutes me. He smiles well to other men and is kind but not to me.”</p>
<p><em>Would you have done that to other Kwon Chae-woo?</em></p>
<p>A pathetic sense of inferiority gnawed at him. How could he be jealous of his past self? He found this ridiculous.</p>
<p>Her trivialities have been frantic lately. The inner wall, which is not even wet yet, swallows its finger well to the end of the root, but she pushes him away.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon even feigned a casual snore, in a vain attempt to escape his touch and caresses. Little did she know that such a flimsy facade only served to incite his desires even further.</p>
