            <p><strong>Chapter 82</strong></p>
<p>He put the tray away on the side table. He leaned over to her and gently pulled her hands from her face. But she turned away from him and averted his eyes.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think I’d get caught. No, I meant I didn’t think it would turn out like this.” She tried to wriggled her way into the blanket again.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo softly grabbed her trembling wrist. “Lee-yeon. Look at me.” She shook her head.</p>
<p>He pulled the blanket away and kissed the back of her hand softly. She flinched. “If you want to hide, a blanket isn’t enough.”</p>
<p>He pulled her to him and hugged her tightly. She felt a strange comfort in his hands.</p>
<p>“So, what was it like comparing me to other men? I want to hear the result.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon squirmed against his chest. He waited patiently. “I didn’t think of anything. I saw you through that window in the café.”</p>
<p>She remembered vividly the way he had stood outside that window, in the pouring rain.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to go home,” she mumbled. “With you.”</p>
<p>He hugged her tighter. “If that’s the case, then why do you keep pushing me away? Look at me.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon turned her head and looked at him.</p>
<p>“Tell me, has something changed about me?” he asked.</p>
<p>When she looked at him, she just recalled what had happened yesterday. The way he had kissed and licked her down there…</p>
<p>Her face flared red, and she couldn’t meet his eyes. <em>Did everyone live a life like that at night? </em>Wondered Lee-yeon. This was all such a new experience.</p>
<p>“Uh….” She stared at him. That was such a random question. If she thought about it, she realized that his eyes were back to normal and there was no predatory gleam there like yesterday. His clothes were buttoned up neatly. But all this just reminded her of how he had been yesterday: raw and naked. She blushed again. She coughed and cleared her throat. “Uh… I guess you look a bit more handsome?</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo smirked and opened his mouth to say something. She quickly changed her words.</p>
<p>“No? Then… has your skin got better? Your face looks clean.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo smiled. His gaze was so intense that it reminded her of last night again.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the compliment,” he said. “But my face was clean when I woke up.”</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo lowered his head and kissed her. He wrapped his arms around her tightly and she melted like cream.</p>
<p>“There was no trace of crying,” he said.</p>
<p>She realized that was true! Even when she had sneaked out a little bit around dawn, she hadn’t heard him sobbing! She looked at him, surprised. She smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“What do you think the reason was, Lee-yeon?”</p>
<p>“Uh… I don’t know?”</p>
<p>As she thought about it, he smiled. “I think I do.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>She finished the sandwich and coffee he had made for her and locked herself in her office for two whole hours. She could hear Kwon Chae-woo washing the dishes and vacuuming the house.</p>
<p>She was curious to see why he was doing house chores, but she wasn’t confident enough to go outside and face him.</p>
<p>“Seems like sex avoids even nightmares.” Thankfully the man didn’t barge into the office.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon scratched her head and tried not to think about it. Lee-yeon spent her morning hiding in the office. She then decided to take care of her garden. She sneaked outside and pulled some weeds. She was then preparing the hose to water her garden when she heard a voice.</p>
<p>“Is Director So Lee-yeon here?”</p>
<p>The gate of the Spruce Tree Hospital opened. Joo Dong-mi, who was wearing quite a large jacket, walked in. She smiled as her eyes met Lee-yeon’s.</p>
<p>“Howdy!” Mature yet playful. Respectful yet rowdy.</p>
<p>“Hello. What brings you here?” Lee-yeon shut the hose.</p>
<p>Joo Dong-mi looked around the area as though she was looking for someone else. Lee-yeon’s face darkened.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that employee here yet?” she asked.</p>
<p>“He is inside but why are you…?”</p>
<p>Joo Dong-mi smiled radiantly. “I wanted to say something to him.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon clenched the hose tightly.</p>
<p>“Is it okay if I go in and talk with him for a moment?” asked Joo Dong-mi. She scratched her head and looked at Lee-yeon. “I will tell you the truth, I like him and would like to—,”.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s face became stiff. “Ms. Joo Dong-mi,” she interrupted. “Actually, there is something I need to tell you.”</p>
<p>She dropped the hose and wiped her hands on the side of her pants. It was scary for Lee-yeon to speak the truth.</p>
<p>She had only learnt to hide the truth. The truth about her parents. The family she lived with. The truth about her birth. She had never interacted with anyone enough to talk to them honestly.  But today, she wanted to tell the truth. She didn’t want to let go of something she cherished so easily.</p>
<p>She wanted to stand her ground. Otherwise, everyone would be like her cousins who always wanted to ruin her life by taking away everything she had.</p>
<p>“He’s not really my employee but my…”</p>
<p>Joo Dong-mi’s eyes widened. “He is not an employee here?!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon flinched as Joo Dong-mi stepped close to her. She was just too enthusiastic a person to deal with.</p>
<p>“Yes, he is not an employee. Instead, he is my boy—”</p>
<p>“Your boy toy?” said Joo Dong-mi eagerly.</p>
<p>“What?! No!” said Lee-yeon, stunned.</p>
<p>“So… he is your boy toy. Wow!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was actually speechless. She stared blankly at Joo Dong-mi.</p>
<p>“You look so innocent, but you are like me! Don’t worry, your secret is safe with me,” said Joo Dong-mi. “It’s good to know.”</p>
<p>Joo Dong-mi extended her hand in a handshake. Lee0yeon shook her hands in a daze. “A woman should indeed have a boy toy or two, if you ask me,” she said eagerly.</p>
<p><em>Who the hell is this person? She is like a mini Choo-ja…. </em>Lee-yeon opened her mouth to respond but Joo Dong-mi wouldn’t give her a chance.</p>
<p>“It’s a waste to marry and be committed to a person. You shouldn’t let him move beyond your pants,” said Joo Dong-mi sagely.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon nodded blankly. This was the weirdest conversation she ever had.</p>
<p>“Do you drink?” Joo Dong-mi suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“No. I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Wow! Then you do it sober? I can’t have fun sober,” Joo Dong-mi looked at her in reverence. “I was getting lonely on this tiny island. Nobody wants to just have fun without commitments. But you, you don’t hide it! I honestly respect you. I drink like a fish. Could we drink together sometimes? Have a long talk?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was awkward. She never had anyone be this friendly to her. But right then, Joo Dong-mi said something to her that annoyed her greatly.</p>
<p>“Then can I borrow him?” she asked. “Please, Director! Please give him to me!”</p>
