            <p><strong>Chapter 255</strong></p>
<p>“I’m back!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon, finishing a week-long hospital stay, shouted as she swung the front door wide open.</p>
<p>Even though the garden tends to get messy quickly if left unattended, Choo-ja seemed to have taken care of it during that time—it was clean and tidy.</p>
<p>Returning home after about forty days, it didn’t feel lonely or cold, thanks to Kwon Chae-woo’s strong hand and warm embrace. However, he still looked discontent.</p>
<p>“What’s on your mind?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking the same thing for a week.”</p>
<p>“…Still?”</p>
<p>When Lee-yeon’s hand went limp, Chae-woo grabbed it firmly.</p>
<p>They agreed to check only the box indicating that the marriage certificate would ultimately follow his mother’s surname.</p>
<p>Whenever Chae-woo looked at the framed certificate on the side table, he made a face as if his back hurt. Sometimes he would grimace, other times he would sigh, and one day he took out a knife and relentlessly carved apples until he got tired of it.</p>
<p>Watching a man go through more emotional ups and downs than a pregnant woman, Lee-yeon suddenly realized the weight of the knife she held.</p>
<p>In the future, Chae-woo will endure this unquenchable thirst, suppressing his temper, coaxing gently, and threatening with a calm voice.</p>
<p>But even if he throws a tantrum, he will endure it one more time at the decisive moment. When she saw that struggling figure, her breath passed over her lips like laughter.</p>
<p>“Seems like Mr. Chae-woo keeps forgetting…”</p>
<p>“Forgetting what?”</p>
<p>“Whose child do you think I’m carrying now?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woon noticed her gentle intentions, but his face stiffened her face even more.</p>
<p>“It’s not like you’re carrying <em>me</em>.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“So I don’t feel reassured even after hearing that.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“While our child is extremely precious, I would die without you. A child can grow up in someone else’s hands, but I… if it’s not you… ”</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon just looked at him in surprise, the man sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, love me more.”</p>
<p>Even though it was just Kwon Chae-woo’s usual nonsense complaining, her ears felt hot today.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon turned her head in surprise at the man’s endlessly longing eyes.</p>
<p>Then two large hands cupped her face and his eyes locked with hers.. Her head, which had turned back in surprise, was firmly fixed in place.</p>
<p>“I’m not convinced, and I’m not backing down.” He said determined.</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“I thought the proposal was the problem.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo hid his anxious feelings and lowered his lips to hers. He bit her upper lip and slid his tongue into the gaping gap, tracing her teeth.</p>
<p>The tip of his tongue was very slow as it touched her soft inner flesh in a sensual way. Her lips parted eagerly and their flesh merged as if it were the first time.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo watched Lee-yeon’s eyelids flutter shut and sucked and pulled her tongue even harder. No matter where he licked, the soft, hot, narrow inside of his mouth aroused his desire to do more than kissing.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon let out a low moan of sexual pleasure that had soared all the way to the tip of Kwon Chae-woo’s head, and roughly thrust his tongue inside her harder.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, Kwon Chae-woo was bothered that  Lee-yeon was reluctant to get married.</p>
<p>This simple conclusion drove him insane. She herself might not have realized it yet, but she was clearly hesitating until the issue with the Hwaidome ebds..</p>
<p>As much as he wanted to wait for that, Kwon Chae-woo knew it would be a long wait.</p>
<p>Whether now or before, Kwon Chae-woo had become a hunting dog on the precarious borderline, shifting between being aggressive and submissive.</p>
<p>The unpredictable waiting, the restless feeling that seemed to float alone. Suddenly, Kwon Chae-woo turned his head and nibbled on her plump cheek. Saliva and tooth marks vividly marked the pale and delicate skin.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon, surprised, looked at him as if to ask, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>However, before she could say anything, their lips met again. As they clashed gazes with fiery sparks, Lee-yeon couldn’t lift a finger.</p>
<p>Lips were devoured, tongues sucked. If she took a step back, Kwon Chae-woo followed suit.</p>
<p>He grasped her, probing her mouth open. He explored her delicate insides with a sensually slow rhythm.</p>
<p>She was hanging on so desperately.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ah.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-won caressed Lee-yeon’s lower back while listening to her moans in his ears. But as she began to gasp for air, he let go of her seemingly inseparable body.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon had a dazed expression, and Kwon Chae-woo furrowed his brows at her flushed cheeks as if they were about to burst. Even if he’s stubborn, he knows when to stop.</p>
<p>To conceal his gloom, he casually wiped his face.</p>
<p>Ignoring the heated and throbbing area, he deliberately changed the subject.</p>
<p>“…Lee-yeon, haven’t seen this before, what is it?”</p>
<p>He pointed to a small hill that rose in front of the tree. However, the voice, heated with passion, was precarious in itself. Lee-yeon scratched her head, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>“…Uh, it’s Chae-woo’s grave.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The man’s completely changing expression was truly something to see.</p>
