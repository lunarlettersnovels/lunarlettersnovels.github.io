        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 137</strong></p>
<p>He dug his nose into Lee-yeon’s collarbone. The soft scent of her body, mingled with the smell of dry sweat on her skin, was completely captivating.</p>
<p>Her red nipple was slick with his saliva. And he could feel how hard he was, how ready he was.</p>
<p>“I’m still all sweaty from work…! I’ll shower first–”</p>
<p>“What a waste of time.”</p>
<p>He raised his head to look her fiercely in the eyes. The clean whites of his eyes creeped her out.</p>
<p>“Even if it’s just a second, I want to take as much time as I can.”</p>
<p>“…What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>He rubbed her through her underwear and felt her body react.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“What are you saying, when you’re this horny?”</p>
<p>His low voice was full of lust. Suddenly, he lifted her into his arms and started heading toward the bathroom.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute…!”</p>
<p>Despite her protests, Chae-woo stepped into the shower. He put Lee-yeon down, turned on the shower and began spraying her with the water.</p>
<p>“Gah!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon jumped at the sudden stream of water. The water pressure was strong and left a painful tingling sensation all over her body. She closed her eyes and mouth tightly and held out her arms as if trying to hold back the water. She tried to somehow avoid the cold water, but Chae-woo mercilessly kept the stream pointed toward her. Eventually, Lee-yeon turned around, shielding herself from the water, wiped her face and shouted, “What are you doing…!”</p>
<p>Her chest, face, and entire body were completely soaked. She wrapped her trembling body with her arms.</p>
<p>“I thought you were worried about being sweaty.”</p>
<p>Chae-woo grabbed Lee-yeon and turned her around forcibly to look her in the eyes.</p>
<p>“Is this good enough?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was struck speechless by his uncharacteristically brazen attitude.</p>
<p>“Are you still not satisfied?”</p>
<p>Chae-woo pulled his shirt off over his head. She could see the outline of his hard dick through his pants, where his buckle still hung loose. He quickly removed his pants as well and picked up the shower head again.</p>
<p>“Wai-Wait–”</p>
<p>“I’ll help you wash up, so you take off your clothes too.”</p>
<p>This time, warm water washed over every corner of Lee-yeon’s body. Her wet, torn clothes suck to her skin, revealing the smooth outline of her body.</p>
<p>Slowly feasting his eyes on her body, he could see the vague shadow of a tuft of hair between her legs. His eyes stopped there and his breathing became quiet.</p>
<p>He fixated the stream of water between her legs, slowly revealing more and more of what lay beneath her now translucent underwear. Suddenly, he licked his lips.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon, sensing his attention, quickly turned around. But it wasn’t a good idea.</p>
<p>A thin piece of cloth, clinging tightly to that secret place. Glossy thighs with firm skin. Round buttocks barely covered by thin fabric. Droplets of water flowing from those cheeks. His eyes were drawn to every bit of her.</p>
<p>“Mnn……”</p>
<p>Maybe it was because of the water pressure, but Lee-yeon groaned weakly.</p>
<p>In an instant, the sound of rushing water stopped.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>A strange silence stretched between them. Lee-yeon tried to turn her head, but she was suddenly pulled backward by her waist.</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>The heat of his touch shocked her system and she gasped as he grabbed her.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo, what, what are you―!”</p>
<p>He pulled her underwear down and quickly pressed his lips together. On his knees, he spread Lee-yeon’s legs apart and buried his head between them. Lee-yeon shuddered with pleasure just from the feel of his breath between her legs. He slid his tongue upward in one slow motion.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…! Chae-woo!”</p>
<p>As she jerked and writhed, he tightened his grip on her abdomen. His nose rubbed against her clit and he didn’t hesitate to rub his tongue around it before shoving his tongue inside her.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Chae-woo, ah, don’t!</p>
<p>He grinned at Lee-yeon’s helpless response. Her face immediately turned red.</p>
<p>Chae-woo going down on her, she pressing herself into him shamelessly. It was all so humiliating. She tried to break free like a deer sensing danger, but Chae-woo held her fast.</p>
<p>Running away was futile.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon flexed her toes, biting her lip roughly. Chae-woo kept moving his tongue around like he was enjoying something delicious, sucking on her soft flesh and persistently shoving his tongue inside her.</p>
<p>“Mmmnnn, nnn, mmm…!”</p>
<p>His red tongue was like a burning ember. Every time he licked and shoved his tongue inside her, back and forth, the fire moved. The slurping sound reminded of the splashing sound of water, but inside she felt hot.</p>
<p>She was being slowly devoured and the squelching sound seemed to echo around her. He thrust his tongue inside her, tilting his head to reach deeper.</p>
<p>Chae-woo flicked her clitoris with his tongue slowly, as if nervous. Each time he did this, Lee-yeon’s breath quickened and she felt like something was melting inside her.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, hahh, aaahhhh……!”</p>
<p>Using his teeth, he nipped lightly at the soft folds of her vagina, sucking the skin into his mouth and lightly tugging with his teeth. He shoved his tongue in again moving his chin moving as though going in for a kiss. She swallowed every drop as she came, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down busily as he gulped.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>As soon as Chae-woo pulled his lips away, breathing heavily–</p>
<p>“Ahh…” he shoved his fingers into her.</p>
<p>“It feels different from the back.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s hand, which was sliding down the bathroom wall, slipped weakly. He swirled his fingers around inside her, using his knuckles to stretch her wider. At the same time, he was bold with his hands.</p>
<p>“I remember every moment we’ve been together, but we’ve never done anything like this.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh…!”</p>
<p>“That’s why I like it.”</p>
<p>His fingers became wet and sticky as he slipped one finger inside of her, slowly sliding it in and out, then two fingers, then three.</p>
<p>He purposely hooked his knuckles and hung them on the end. Whenever his fingers rubbed along the inside of her, Lee-yeon’s hips moved involuntarily.</p>
<p>“Hahh, ahhh…!”</p>
<p>Something was pouring out from deep within her and she couldn’t help but groan.</p>
<p>The fingers, covered in her wetness, kept pushing deep inside her. Lee-yeon’s ears reddened at the stick, slurping, sucking sound.</p>
<p>“Chae, Chae-woo. Hah, stop. Stop……”</p>
<p>“You have to make sense for me to listen to you.”</p>
<p>He let out a low, ridiculing laugh.</p>
<p>“Still, I don’t like this…”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s just, well, I’m a bit cold. Or I at least want to be able to see your face– Ahh!”</p>
<p>Just then, something hot and thick shoved its way into Lee-yeon’s body all at once as if it were on fire.</p>
<p>“…You want me to beg you, right?” he said, his voice rough as he breathed heavily.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon opened her mouth wide and tried to remain still as she bore the painful pressure.</p>
<p>“Must I be so obedient?”</p>
<p>Chae-woo wrapped a hand around Lee-yeon’s neck.</p>
