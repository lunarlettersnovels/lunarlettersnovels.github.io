            <p><strong>Chapter 23</strong></p>
<p>When the two left.</p>
<p>“Hey, Lee-yeon.” Hwang Jo-yoon stretched out his arm towards her. Just then, Kwon Chae-woo sitting next to her pulled her back onto her seat. Hwang Jo-yoon waved his hand in the air and Lee-yeon looked puzzled.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, I’m worried.” Kwon Chae-woo clung to her closely. His body temperature was warm. “Who is he?”</p>
<p>“Ahm…” Lee-yeon didn’t know where to begin. As she hesitated, his arm on her waist pulled her closer.  She couldn’t tell whether it was anxiety or vigilance that was making him act that way but when she saw Hwang Jo-yoon flinch she realized it was the latter. “Is he someone I know?”</p>
<p>She could understand why he was anxious. If Hwang Jo-yoon was an acquaintance, then it would make Kwon Chae-woo feel awkward to not remember him. The memories she didn’t want to remember came unbidden to her mind. She swallowed her bitterness and answered him.</p>
<p>“He used to be a senior at the hospital where I used to work years before,” she said, “You don’t know him. So, don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>“Ah… okay,” said Kwon Chae-woo, nodding slowly. But he didn’t retrieve his arm from her waist. Rather, he had both his arms around her and pulled her close. She wanted to tell him not to do that.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, who is he?” asked Hwang Jo-yoon, glancing at her waist.</p>
<p>“Yes, Lee-yeon. Introduce us,” said Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon straightened her back at a sudden warm touch she felt through her clothes. “This is Kwon Chae-woo. He’s the man I live with.”</p>
<p><em>I will just say we live together….</em></p>
<p>But Hwang Jo-yoon’s eyes widened. “You-you’re married?”</p>
<p>She was at a loss for words. Kwon Chae-woo leaned towards her and whispered, “You should at least nod. He is waiting.”</p>
<p><em>Right!</em> He urged her to answer, and she was highly aware of his arms around her waist. <em>It tickles! </em>Lee-yeon twisted her body away and nodded at Hwang Jo-yoon.</p>
<p>“I am her husband,” said Kwon Chae-woo as though to confirm it once and for all.</p>
<p>Hwang Jo-yoon asked again. “So, you are really married?”</p>
<p>She was offended at his reaction. He was acting as though it was quite impossible for her to be married. But he had always been like that. She had experience dealing with him. He thought he was always right and everybody else was not.</p>
<p>“No, Lee-yeon. Wait a minute. It’s just that I can’t believe it. How can a person like you get married? No way. Are you alright?” Hwang Jo-yoon’s lips trembled.</p>
<p><em>Oh, how I hate him! </em>Lee-yeon was always repulsed by him whenever she saw him secretly spitting on the flower bed whenever he thought no one was watching. She had absolutely abhorred him from the moment she learnt that he used to snip off plants in his childhood, killing them just for fun. She got really annoyed at the way his lips trembled whenever things didn’t go the way he wanted. He was such a brat, ready to put the blame on others and interfere in other people’s life. Lee-yeon had gotten sick of the quarrel and that’s why she had left the hospital for good instead of fighting for her place.</p>
<p>“You weren’t like that before,” said Hwang Jo-yoon.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You are not the kind of person to date a man. You hated being with people. I know you, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon rolled her eyes at his audacity.</p>
<p>“Who understands a woman who only has time for trees and fertilizers? How can anyone fall in love with someone like that? You used to make fertilizers in the weekend and didn’t even go out. This must be a mistake. I am the only one who could accept you for being the way you are.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was amazed. She should have been angry, but she was so amazed at how little a person could change. <em>How is it that he hasn’t changed at all?</em></p>
<p>“It’s because I’m not by your side, so you made such a mistake….” Hwang Jo-yoon widened his eyes and trembled in anger.</p>
<p>Her head began to hurt from overwhelming stress. She was reminded of how helpless she had felt at her tiny place. Hwang Jo-yoon would always follow her and she couldn’t even afford to move to a new place at that time.</p>
<p>On days when Lee-yeon took detours not willing to go home out of fear, he would burst into a rage. She had always gotten angry at her humble beginnings. Nevertheless, she had forced herself to bear with it because she had to fill in her practice hours at the hospital. She had tolerated everything so that she could have her own practice, her own quiet life.</p>
<p>And she finally made it this far by herself. And now…</p>
<p>“Why are you making such a fuss about this?”</p>
<p>“No, Lee-yeon. Was the time between you and me of any importance to you?”</p>
<p>“Clearly not. I never liked you. I hated you. You made my life miserable. It has been years since I left that hospital. I made my own place in the world. And I couldn’t be any happier about it. As you can see, I have a husband. I have my own practice. I am living the best life I could have dreamed of. It looks like you are still stuck in the phase of your life where you act like a spoiled brat and look down on me. Grow up.”</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon.” He licked his lips.</p>
<p>“You really are shamelessly making a fuss in front of my husband.”</p>
<p>“Is he really your husband?!” he suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“Bring the family relations certificate! Until then, I won’t believe it!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon froze. She didn’t any anything. Hwang Jo-yoon didn’t trouble her. But if Kwon Chae-woo asked for it, then everything would be revealed. Her lie would be caught. She felt a prick at her conscience. She hated Hwang Jo-yoon for trying to ruin her life even after all these years.</p>
<p>Just then, she heard a faint grunt. It was a sound that only Lee-yeon could hear.</p>
