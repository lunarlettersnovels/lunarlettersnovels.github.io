            <p><strong>Chapter 165</strong></p>
<p>“When a tree has to withstand strong wind for a long time, grew up on the cliff, shore, or been pressed down by large amount of snow, some strange things happen in its bark. It grows up in a weird way.”</p>
<p>A heavy voice rang through mic.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon attended [Tree and Human] special lecture as the last lecturer and was shaking her legs at the backstage with her speech in her hand. Even though she put in so much effort into it, the words were dancing thanks to her heart thumping.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon rubbed her eyes and took breather. Thankfully, there wasn’t much of audience due to boring subject.</p>
<p>She leaned her head against the cold concrete wall and closed her eyes. The words of the lecturer before her finally settled with her.</p>
<p><em>Who did they say he was? Ah… Did they say he was an instrument crafter?</em></p>
<p>“Our life is the same. Many things go wrong, been suppressed by the pressure for a long time, and even swirled in unexpected storm.”</p>
<p><strong>“Congratulations, you’re pregnant.”</strong></p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s fingers snapped as she remembered the doctor’s exact words.</p>
<p>“Hence our soul has been wounded and had its own unique scar and able to produce our own unique tune. Even though we were full of mistakes, we were able to have great harmony like trees.”</p>
<p><strong>“It’s been around 12 weeks.”</strong></p>
<p>What face was she making in front of the lady who was white gown?  Did she feel like smiling or crying? Did her heart pound or stop? Did she think of the new life that was sprouting or the man who was already dead?</p>
<p>“—Even the perfect shaped violin doesn’t necessarily make great sound. Just like that, people also don’t make great sound only when they’re perfect. The true tune only happens when you know what’s important in your life. Right now, what’s echoing inside you?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s heart was pounding with the name of the man she can’t see anymore.</p>
<p>If it’s 12 weeks…</p>
<p>It was before Kwon Chae-woo got his memory back. Before he fell into a long slumber. That meant–.</p>
<p>It was a child of a man that loved Lee-yeon dearly. Even though he was no longer there, it was the last trace of that Kwon Chae-woo who was soft and kind to her.</p>
<p>Inside her dark and gloomy heart suddenly had fear and joy at the same time. Lee-yeon bit her lower lips. The crumbled paper touched her face.</p>
<p>“-Out of ten thousand trees, maybe one could become a singing tree. First, we put the tree in the high tide water and hear the sound they make when they bump into each other. Or we tapped on it with a hammer to feel its vibration.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If we find a bell sound after many tries, your body probably is already tired.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“We have to put this much effort just to find wood that makes good sound, so how much effort would be need for life? The trees that sing especially are usually grown in difficult and unfair environment.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Would you still like to look for it?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s back flinched suddenly. The question sounded like it was questioning her.</p>
<p>Whether she’ll try to get one out of ten thousand. Whether she will endure with patience and adventure.</p>
<p>The lecture continued for a while and soon the audience clapped and she got up.</p>
<p>There was no tears there. Only sunlight that was shining upon where she was sitting.</p>
<p>***<br>
Lee-yeon finished the lecture successfully even though she was rushing through her paper.</p>
<p>Even though the rest of the audience left by the end, but Lee-yeon found it easier to talk in front of even smaller amount of people.</p>
<p>She was crazy hungry after this. Lee-yeon impulsively turned her handle.</p>
<p>The Spirit Tree was in worse condition than before.</p>
<p>She became emotional before she could even think calmly. The wound that scratched the shaft of the tree. Her sight became hazy instantly.</p>
<p>This was why she didn’t want to see it with her own eyes. This was the Spirit Tree’s wound as well as Lee-yeon’s.</p>
<p>She started to pant like she could sense the shock from that day again.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>That moment, she saw something was hanging on the dead branch.</p>
<p>“What is this…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon frowned.</p>
<p>Even through all of this, she could see this clearly. She wiped her teary eyes and walked towards it.</p>
<p>“… With what strength—“</p>
<p>That you blossom a flower and die.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon saw the last flower that the Spirit Tree blossomed.</p>
<p>Her broken heart seemed have really become fertilizer. The seed that was sprouting secretly inside what she thought was a broken heart wasn’t much different from the Spirit Tree.</p>
<p>Then for the first time in a very long time, she remembered the good times.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, who was a little aggressive but cared so much about her. Poor Kwon Chae-woo, who would’ve slept for eternity if it wasn’t for her. Kwon Chae-woo, who hunted with his heart yet was conscious his owner. Kwon Chae-woo, who was worried about being abandoned forever. Kwon Chae-woo, the vegetative person who she grew.</p>
<p>It was the moment where illusion became memory.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon took out her phone and called someone.</p>
<p>–Hey, did you do well?</p>
<p>“Choo-ja, I think a funeral is necessary.”</p>
<p>–What? We’ll do what?”</p>
<p>“Even just us two—“</p>
<p>It was time she walked towards the light and let go of dead branches.</p>
<p><em>‘The black locust that lives while lying down even after collapsing. The maple that curved its back due to win. It was a fight. I know. I know now.’</em></p>
<p>Like the trees that she worship and love.</p>
<p>“—Kwon Chae-woo’s funeral.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon took off the Spirit Tree’s flower and carefully put it in her pocket.</p>
