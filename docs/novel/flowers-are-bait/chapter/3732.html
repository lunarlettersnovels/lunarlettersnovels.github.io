            <p><strong>Chapter 47</strong></p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo! I don’t need a husband who doesn’t even listen to me!”</p>
<p>While Lee-yeon was hitting her own chest in frustration, he moved even closer to the direction of the approaching animal. When he came into the boar’s sight, the beast snarled even more wildly and rushed towards him.</p>
<p>With nothing to do but be a witness of the disaster that was about to fall before her very eyes, Lee-yeon covered her mouth tightly with both hands.</p>
<p>The moment when the boar’s fangs came close up to Kwon Chae-woo’s face, he quickly turned the stake he was holding. It stabbed the wild boar, and blood spurted from its neck.</p>
<p>Although it was a fatal wound, the wild boar only paused for a second and began to butt Kwon Chae-woo again.</p>
<p>He was pushed and pushed, and eventually, to the tree where Lee-yeon climbed up.</p>
<p><em>‘You can’t die!’ </em>Lee-yeon held her phone with trembling hands, and for the first time, she hoped for the man’s safety.</p>
<p>However, Kwon Chae-woo clearly didn’t regard this as a predicament. In fact, he was… smiling.</p>
<p>With agility comparable to that of professional hunters, he pierced the stake between the axe marks he had just made. The beast, unable to slow down, couldn’t stop before the sharp blade pierced into its body.</p>
<p><strong>Kueehhhhh-</strong></p>
<p>At the painful howl, the mountain birds flew away.</p>
<p>While holding onto the shaking tree, Lee-yeon didn’t take her eyes off the man.</p>
<p>What gave her creeps was that Kwon Chae-woo was smiling as if he was playing a fun game. Just then, he began to wield the axe he was holding firmly.</p>
<p>Whoosh. Whoosh.</p>
<p>Blood spattered every time he swung the axe. When he grabbed the boar’s protruding fang and tore the carotid artery inside it, he was covered in blood from head to foot. The man looked like he had been painted bright red. The red water seeped between his teeth.</p>
<p>“Ew…!”</p>
<p>The man looked like he had been painted bright red. The red liquid oozed between his teeth. After making a terrible noise, the beast staggered as if it was exhausted.</p>
<p>“You can come down now, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Her mouth was dry, and her heart was beating fast. For some reason, she felt like she shouldn’t go down. It was as if she was in a manga and became the sister who escaped from a tiger because of the man who constantly made her choose between “Don’t die” and “Don’t kill.”</p>
<p>(‘The sister who escaped from a tiger’ is an expression that derives from the Korean fairytale called ‘The Sun and The Moon.’)</p>
<p>“Do you want me to go up?”</p>
<p>“No!” She responded firmly.</p>
<p>“My legs, my legs are shaking. I’ll take a breather for a second and go down. Kwon Chae Woo, you should… also calm down.….”</p>
<p>“You think I’m <em>excited</em>?”</p>
<p>When she glanced down, Kwon Chae-woo was no different from usual, except his chest was slightly heaving up and down to catch a breath.</p>
<p>Rather, he was still and calm as a fog.</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. You must have wanted to see me getting excited covered in blood.” He clearly had different ideas in his head.</p>
<p>Turning his shoulder as if he was about to do a stretch, he continued, “If that’s what you want, just say it. Do you want to see my p*nis get excited?”</p>
<p>“What the f―, no!”</p>
<p>“I told you I can do anything you want.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a pervert!” Lee-yeon made it clear. At the same time, the doctor’s words of concern and the serious look on his face lingered in her mind.</p>
<p><em>‘Behavioral abnormalities, aggression, hypersexuality.’ </em>Those three words perfectly described the present Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>When he noticed that she was holding her breath, he wiped the blood clean from his face with the back of his hand and asked. “Were you scared?”</p>
<p>“I’m more scared of your face now.”</p>
<p>With that, he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“Don’t laugh with an axe in your hand!”</p>
<p>Anyone who saw them would mistake the guy for a killer waiting for his prey under the tree. Lee-yeon held onto the tree even more tightly. She felt the strong urge to erase the moment she felt the slightest betrayal at the doctor’s diagnosis.</p>
<p><em>‘I really have to get my head straight from now on to become a better liar.’</em></p>
<p>Just then, Lee-yeon heard Kwon Chae-woo, with his back slightly bent over, moaning in pain.</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo, Are you all right?”</p>
<p>She stuck out her face between the branches. Because he acted so fine, Lee-yeon forgot that Kwon Chae-woo just fought with a big, wild boar.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt a lot?”</p>
<p>Seeing the man not moving, Lee-yeon sensed something was wrong. It was when she was about to switch branchesto move closer to Kwon Chae-woo that the axe fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“As you told me, I put down the axe.” He straightened his back and waved his hand. “So now it’s your turn to come down.”</p>
