            <p><strong>Chapter 218</strong></p>
<p>Their rough breathing and the merging of their tongues produced a slick moisture that left them gasping for air. Lee-yeon’s lips were sealed tightly, and she couldn’t find a way to breathe.</p>
<p>It felt like Kwon Chae-woo was the one who had been drugged with a sleeping pill, yet she was the one sinking into drowsiness.</p>
<p>“Ha, ah…”</p>
<p>Her ribs ached as her waist was constricted, and her nape was tightly held. It was a kiss devoid of tenderness or consideration, but her forgotten sensations gradually stirred within her. His tongue grazed from the softest parts to the firm gums and even brushed against the roof of her mouth.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo leisurely explored her mouth, his low laughter vibrating through their shared kiss, causing her body to tremble with anticipation.</p>
<p>The sounds of their salivary exchange and the suppressed moans he let out kept Lee-yeon’s emotions fluctuating wildly. She knew she should resist him, but her entire body was on fire, and her grip lacked strength.</p>
<p>“…Ah, you had to bury me to survive. But if you die, I will dig you up from the ground. So, which one of us is tougher, Lee-yeon?” He said.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo unbuttoned his pants and pulled down his boxer briefs, giving a clear signal. Lee-yeon felt a familiar threat lurking.</p>
<p>At that moment—</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, I’m sure you were surprised earlier…”</p>
<p>His erect member, like an arrow, was already soaked in precum, making his underwear darken. Kwon Chae-woo pulled Lee-yeon closer again, and the damp, hot scent of a beast assaulted her peripheral nerves.</p>
<p>Her heart pounded so fiercely that she felt flustered.</p>
<p>“…Yes, definitely.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s calm response brought a hint of brightness to Kwon Chae-woo’s expression.</p>
<p>“Now you want to claim and touch, Lee-yeon?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon calmly wiped away the traces of the man’s saliva from her lips. “If you want to eat dog food, you must bow down yourself.”</p>
<p>“…!” A momentarily speechless Kwon Chae-woo raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Fine, if you think your cock has gone crazy enough to drool, we should check it. From now on, you touch it yourself, and you stop when I tell you to.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon raised four fingers, her lips curving slightly.</p>
<p>“Fourth, don’t c*m without permission.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“I warned you, don’t spill it carelessly.”</p>
<p>“If you follow this rule, I’ll let you sleep with me every night. If you can’t, then every morning, you’ll make breakfast for me.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo wiped the slightly blood-tainted corner of his mouth with his tongue, his hazy eyes blinking slowly.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, he pulled the neckline of the T-shirt he was wearing, took off his top at once, and lowered his drawers. The elasticated genitalia bounced out.</p>
<p>He slowly fiddled with his hands and soon began rubbing the pillar with his entire palm.</p>
<p>Gradually, a nervous crease deepened in his brow. He rubbed the tip of his ear lightly, scanned the entire long straight pen*s, and pressed the flesh hard.</p>
<p>Whenever a tendon popped up in his hand, a groan seething in his mouth heated the air.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon watched the scene without realizing it. Whenever Kwon Chae-woo moved his large hand up and down, his arms, shoulders, abs, and chest became tense one after another.</p>
<p>He was kneeling, one hand behind him supporting his torse as he neared his release.</p>
<p>In the meantime, his hand kept moving up and down, and at some point –</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon, watching the man’s expression, suddenly cut off the flow.</p>
<p>The man, flinched and hardened in limbo, frowned and glared.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon decided to pull the lead further.</p>
<p>“You have to take your hands off.”</p>
<p>“… Oh, Lee-yeon. Why on earth are you doing this to me?”</p>
<p>“Fifth, don’t let me say it twice.”</p>
<p>He looked at her pleadingly with the back of his red neck, but Lee-yeon was determined.</p>
<p>In the end, Kwon Chae-woo grimaced and took his hand off himself.</p>
<p>His pen*s was still leaning heavily, and the veins that had popped up shook, dissatisfied, perhaps because of the bland feeling of the personality after reaching the limit.</p>
<p>After some time, Lee-yeon shook his head as if to start again.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, his face contorted with a mix of faint contempt and excitement, roughly grasped himself. He thrust rapidly, pounding his flesh, his neck jerking from side to side as he focused on his prey.</p>
<p>“Sigh, damn it, So Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Continue.” She commanded, to which the man followed.</p>
<p>After split seconds, “Stop it right there.”</p>
<p>She stopped him again, but it was too late…</p>
<p>As the unquenchable thirst continued to build up, Kwon Chae-woo slowly crumbled. The man who had been repeatedly interrupted became even more ravenous with each disruption, yet he couldn’t utter a word to her. He only released ragged breaths as he climaxed.</p>
<p>“Sigh… I messed up, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>He lowered his eyebrows again, licking his lips with moistened pupils.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, I made a mistake. I won’t do it again. I’ll resist. I’ll behave. I was reckless.”</p>
<p>His lips parted due to the surging breath, spoke insistently while his resentful gaze pinpointed her precisely.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon thought, ‘He’s a stubborn one to discipline,’ yet she felt a strange sense of satisfaction. The authority to make him yield so miserably belonged solely to one person.</p>
<p>With a rhythmic motion, Kwon Chae-woo raised his engorged member, covered in slippery fluid, as if engaged in s*x. Simultaneously, his gaze became more aggressive, persistently exploring the space between her legs.</p>
<p>“Sigh… ugh, damn it, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Outside his tightly clenched fist, the sensitive tip twitched roughly. And then, at the moment when his lustful face contorted dramatically…</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s enough. Stop it right there.”</p>
<p>This time, Kwon Chae-woo, now flushed even redder, looked at her resentfully.</p>
<p>“Ugh… it hurts, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>“Then please close your mouth and behave.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Kwon Chae-woo.”</p>
<p>Finally, she called him his name, the way she addressed him before. However, this sweet victory was short-lived, and in the blink of an eye, Kwon Chae-woo surrendered helplessly.</p>
