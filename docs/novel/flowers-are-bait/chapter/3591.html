            <p><strong>Chapter 192</strong></p>
<p>“Is that why you want to the attendee’s room in the middle of the night? Because you had a desperate need?”</p>
<p>He wasn’t wrong, but it sounded weird. As Lee-yeon just blankly stared at him, he added.</p>
<p>“Which bastard was it? Ah–. Was it that one? The stupid one that said he’d lift the ladder? Or the one that chatted with you when you were eating?”</p>
<p>He looked upset.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t eat whatever just because you’re desperate.”</p>
<p>“W, what are you—“</p>
<p>“Just starve then, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>… Starve? Staarve? Lee-yeon shouted before she could think calmly.</p>
<p>“I’m already pissed off that I can’t go and eat, so why do I have to starve! I came out of the house because there was nothing to eat there. I came out secretly because I couldn’t wake up Kwon Ki-seok to feed me—“</p>
<p>“Wake up Kwon Ki-seok?”</p>
<p>He cut her off.</p>
<p>“Just what did you want to fill to wake Kwon Ki-seok?”</p>
<p>His hot hand touched her stomach. She flinched.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, explain well. There’s only us here.”</p>
<p>He spoke creepily. She could smell his strong scent as his vicious face came to her. But it only made her hungrier.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo bit Lee-yeon’s ear. He sucked on it and then started to chew on it.</p>
<p>“Where is that thing that was hanging here?”</p>
<p>His breath touched her sensitive side.</p>
<p>“W, w, what are you doing…!”</p>
<p>I wanted to rip off that earring last time.”</p>
<p>She blushed and hit his shoulders, but it was no use.</p>
<p>“You never did anything like that before.”</p>
<p>“D, don’t chew…! Don’t make an eating sound! W, why do you only chew? I also want my tomato…!”</p>
<p>Her emotion was jumping everywhere. She couldn’t control it. It was like her switch to control it was gone. So she started crying before she could say anything.</p>
<p>“I, I also was going to eat! Juice, juice too…!”</p>
<p>“Juice? What juice?”</p>
<p>He pulled her crying face. Their nose touched.</p>
<p>“I want two eggs… I just wanted two eggs and can eat them without a word.”</p>
<p>“Of course, those bastards also have something similar between their legs, fuck I also have eggs too.”</p>
<p>“You’re already expired… I just want to mix milk with egg and –“</p>
<p>“I probably have that as well.”</p>
<p>“Noooo, not your balls…! Eggs, eggs! I want to mix it with milk and make scrambled eggs! I want scrambled egg and tomato!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon started to cover her empty stomach and bawling, and Kwon Chae-woo, all flustered, lifted her up and wrapped her in a blanket.</p>
<p>“You kidnapped me and didn’t even feed me… You guys aren’t even human.”</p>
<p>One part of the mattress was pushed down heavily, and familiar warmth approached her. Lee-yeon’s stomach felt nauseated from the déjà vu.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo flinched a bit and put his ears to her stomach. The sound of her stomach growling could be heard. He bit his lips while getting up.</p>
<p>“Where are you going with me tied up!”</p>
<p>“I’ll bring it.”</p>
<p>“Bring what?”</p>
<p>“Scrambled egg and tomato, and what else?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stopped crying. Instead, she started salivating.</p>
<p>“Orange juice…”</p>
<p>“Orange juice.”</p>
<p>He kicked the door.</p>
<p>“Open.”</p>
<p>It seemed like someone was on guard in front of the door as it swung open.</p>
<p>A little later, a wide plate full of scrambled egg, freshly washed cherry tomato, and orange juice came in with Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon had her wrist free as she ate as much as possible and somehow fell asleep, and the man who was watching her also fell asleep.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Next morning.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo opened his eyes to the morning sunlight. The first thing that came to his eyes was sleeping So Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>He woke up.</p>
<p>The birds were singing outside.</p>
<p>That simple and clear fact hit him, and Kwon Chae-woo’s face became cold.</p>
<p>He took a piece of egg off Lee-yeon’s mouth and put it into his mouth. He sighed annoyingly. He could feel that he lost this war.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>When did I fall asleep?</em></p>
<p>She was on alert in Kwon Chae-woo’s room, yet she fell asleep casually. She couldn’t sleep well when she came to the Kwon family house, yet she passed out last night.</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes, the thing that was hitting her wasn’t morning sunshine but Kwon Chae-woo’s eyes.</p>
<p>The morning sunlight through the curtain, fresh air, warm blanket. And the weight that was so familiar. Lee-yeon was back in the small house in Hwaido at that moment.</p>
<p><em>Chae-woo. I had a bizarre dream. </em>It felt like she also reached out in the dream.</p>
<p>As she smiled at Kwon Chae-woo, he suddenly became stern.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon suddenly came back to her senses at that small change. If he were her actual husband, he would’ve smiled instead.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon ran from the door, and Kwon Chae-woo didn’t stop her. It was different from last night.</p>
<p>She brushed down her pale face and blamed it on her hormones.</p>
