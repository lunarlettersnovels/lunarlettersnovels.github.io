            <p><strong>Chapter 208</strong></p>
<p>As they entered, a heavy woody scent loomed in the air, pressing down on them like a sharp weight. Kwon Ki-seok, leaning over his large executive desk, flipping through documents, set down the paper pile and clenched his fist.</p>
<p>“Miss So Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You’ve probably heard the news, but the Hwaidom project is completed.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>At the mention of Hwaidom, she couldn’t help but recall the final review. It had been their first ambitious project, so the taste of it was bittersweet. She had temporarily forgotten it in the midst of her busy days.</p>
<p>“Director Jo Kyung-cheon’s hospital, D Hospital, won the final bid. He’s also from Hwaido, so you might be familiar with him.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon gave an awkward smile and nodded her head.</p>
<p>“The opening date for Hwaidom is confirmed, and there will be a big ceremony. Our Su-gook Pharmaceuticals, as the largest investor in Hwaidom, will host the party. At the same time, we’ll be unveiling the new medicine we’ve been researching for a long time.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon approached, pressing her knuckles against her cheekbone, feeling surprised at the mention of Sooguk Pharmaceuticals, but she quickly continued.</p>
<p>“Miss So Lee-yeon, you should attend as my partner that day.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“As you suggested, you are the skilled tree doctor who made it to the fourth stage of the Hwaidom project.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You participated in the evaluation, and you were one of the parties involved. I really want to invite you as my partner.”</p>
<p>It was an incredibly sudden request, no matter how you looked at it. Lee-yeon’s forehead creased in confusion.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit… surprising.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok’s voice was nonchalant, as if he had expected Lee-yeon to refuse.</p>
<p>“You know, I don’t recall such a thing being in the contract originally.”</p>
<p>It was then that Kwon Ki-seok, wearing a knowing smile, suddenly covered her stomach with his palm.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>His close-up gaze felt like it could pierce right through her. Her breath scattered uncontrollably, and her legs lost their strength. She felt like her entire body was frozen, from her throat down to her belly, as she struggled to suppress the urge to scream.</p>
<p>“You thought I didn’t know?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“That’s truly astonishing.”</p>
<p>Even without looking in a mirror, it was clear that her face had turned deathly pale.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo could not have known. But not me.”</p>
<p>“S-Since when…”</p>
<p>Being the person suddenly caught in this situation, all she could come up with were utterly useless questions.</p>
<p>“If you need maternity clinic pictures, just let me know. I have some very lovely photos from that time you had them taken.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>From Hwaido? Lee-yeon’s breathing gradually became more ragged. Unhuman body temperature, snake-skin watch. Lee-yeon was enduring the shock of her world collapsing before her eyes when she reflexively grabbed Kwon Ki-seok’s wrist.</p>
<p>“What are you doing right now?”</p>
<p>At that moment, rather conveniently, Kwon Chae-woo entered the room, leaning slightly against the door frame.</p>
<p>Kwon Ki-seok was touching Lee-yeon’s belly, and when she grabbed his wrist, they seemed affectionate. Their alternating gazes, one of them gripping the other’s hand and the other holding it tenderly, felt as sharp as a blade.</p>
<p>The man exhaled a sigh, but at the same time, he was eerily calm. Kwon Chae-woo moved towards them, pulling apart the intertwined hands of the two.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo promptly took Lee-yeon outside. The man, who had gone cold and stiff, stared at them as they left, and he kept absentmindedly wiping his hand that had been gripping Lee-yeon’s hand just now.</p>
<p>They had seemed just like newlyweds a moment ago, leaving a strong impression in his mind. Kwon Chae-woo muttered a string of curses while gritting his teeth.</p>
<p>“Ah, it hurts…!”</p>
<p>Her plea, mixed with sobs, made him come to a sudden stop. In the silent corridor, only the intertwined breaths of the two could be heard.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo, not knowing what to do, gently stroked Lee-yeon’s wrist, which had turned crimson.</p>
<p>“I always knew you had a temper.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was about to retort but found herself at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“Why… why are you making that face?”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo’s eyelashes were tinged with red. He looked somewhat anxious, then turned cold, then seemed to soften again, as if his throat was dry whenever he blinked. With each blink, a variety of heavy emotions oozed out.</p>
<p>“I… I lost.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I was wrong.”</p>
<p>The man with his head hung low spoke in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>“For the rest of my life, I’ll live being nailed by you. You can grow me like a plant again, or you can keep lying to me until the day I die. I won’t force you with strength, I won’t be oppressive like this. I promise I won’t ever do that again. So…”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo gazed at her with eyes that had turned red from bursting blood vessels.</p>
<p>“Please, just console me.”</p>
