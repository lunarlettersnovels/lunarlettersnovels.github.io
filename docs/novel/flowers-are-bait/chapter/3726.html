            <p><strong>Chapter 53</strong></p>
<p>Sweat dripped down Lee-yeon’s body when she felt door lock was being pressed.</p>
<p>“He even knows the password?” Kwon Chae-woo scoffed.</p>
<p>All this time whenever doctor visited, either Kwon Chae-woo was unconscious or Lee-yeon herself opened the door for doctor. That’s why doctor standing outside the house couldn’t understand why he found door locked this time.</p>
<p>Inside, despite the criticality of situation, Kwon Chae-woo sucked Lee-yeon’s neck on purpose.</p>
<p>Her face colour drained, “Stop, stop! Do you hear me?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon froze at his audacity.</p>
<p>At the moment, they heard buzzer indicating that the password entered is incorrect. Not giving in, doctor started pressing numbers again.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon felt rushed. “I told you to stop!”</p>
<p>Since her requests were given a deaf ear, this time, she warned Kwon Chae-woo by hitting his head lightly.</p>
<p>He lifted his brow with an odd expression. “If I stop…?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do for me, if I stop now?”</p>
<p>“Are you asking this for real?” She raised her brows.</p>
<p>Careful knocks were heard from outside. But to Lee-yeon, it was more of a rush than a horsewhip.</p>
<p>She was trying to think of ways with which they could escape this situation. To her surprise, she yelled because Kwon Chae-woo was touching her private part again.</p>
<p>“Ok!” She muttered hurriedly, controlling her erratic breaths. “I’ll do whatever you want, anything but touching!”</p>
<p>“Anything?” Kwon Chae-woo smirked.</p>
<p>She nodded furiously, glancing at the door. He lifted the tip of her lips and completely took his hands off her body. The moment he stood up, front door opened revealing doctor.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon froze as she didn’t get a chance to hide her bottoms. But Kwon Chae-woo was quick in wrapping a blanket over her. He lifted her up like a princess.</p>
<p>The doctor couldn’t believe his eyes and stammered, “Uhhh…”.</p>
<p>By then, Kwon Chae-woo covered her entirely with a blanket. There was not even a single hair shown.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo glared at the intruder aggressively and soon barked, “You didn’t learn ethics in elementary school?”</p>
<p>Purposely, he picked a fight while going downstairs. All this while doctor felt lost. His mind was numb remembering Lee-yeon’s pants and lace panties that laid carelessly on the bed.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“You have to put me down!” Lee-yeon yelled when Kwon Chae-woo continued holding her. They came back to the room a while ago.</p>
<p>Insides of blanket felt hot and stuffy. Her eyes finally met him when the blanket that was covering her head went down.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo didn’t break the eye lock rather frowned his brows.</p>
<p>Frowning deeper, he confessed, “I still don’t know the password of this house. But that bastard pressed it like it was his home.” He was gritting her teeth. <em>I don’t know the number to the backdoor either.</em></p>
<p>The backdoor was meant to be used only by the medical staff.  Whereas second floor was renovated by Kwon Chae-woo’s brother.</p>
<p>“What’s the password?”</p>
<p>Her body turned stiff, and gaze shifted downwards. She obviously had nothing to respond.</p>
<p>He added, “I swear I won’t let it go if it’s our wedding anniversary, your birthday, or your cell phone number which that b*astard pressed so naturally.”</p>
<p>“Who?” Lee-yeon felt stupid at her question.</p>
<p>Ignoring, he further remarked, “C’mon, think of it, I don’t know anything. Is it from our wedding anniversary, your birthday and cell phone number?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was silent.</p>
<p>“Why do I know nothing?” He hugged Lee-yeon hard and dug his face. He rubbed his head so hard that her shoulders were hurting despite blanket was acting as a cushion.</p>
<p>“I’m your husband but I know you less than others. I feel so impatient whenever this happens.” His left cheek brushed her ears instantly transferring his warmth.</p>
<p>“Even though I probably knew before,” he continued.</p>
<p><em>No, you didn’t!</em> Lee-yeon tried hard to cover up her blank expressions. She loosened herself from his hold and consoled, “It’s, ok. You are hurt.”</p>
<p>He creepily mumbled, “But I still can’t forgive myself.”</p>
<p>Slowly determination took over. He continued, “Let’s start with the backdoor password. To avoid this helpless feeling, I need to know everything concerning you and your life.”</p>
<p>“Uh,” she was tongue-tied. “I can’t.”</p>
<p>He was being unnecessarily curious.</p>
<p>It was only better if Kwon Chae-woo decently ignored housework. But as he was getting used to the fact of losing past memories, he was inevitably getting interested. Into Lee-yeon and everything around her.</p>
<p>He didn’t care to ask about his past, family or hobbies, but he was showcasing this weird obsession about Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>Her head hurt thinking of ways to escape this situation. “Kwon, Kwon Chae-woo,” she called.</p>
<p>At last, the thing that can turn his attention stuck her. “By the way, in my life, I’ve never made that sound before.”</p>
<p>S*x it is. She knew she hit jackpot when his eyes loosened up and his face suddenly became blank.</p>
<p>“You want to keep doing that with me?” Lee-yeon squirmed her hand out and touched his lips.</p>
<p>He turned his head. His ears revealed him blushing.</p>
<p>“You need to get better quickly. I’ve only touched trees before, so I’m not even surprised at something that’s just normal hard!” She exclaimed.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p>“So, put your bandage on and recover quickly.”</p>
<p>“Are you doing this on purpose?” He clenched her chin hard without meeting her eyes.</p>
<p>The man’s Adam’s apple moved as he felt anxious. “When are you going to stop making me such a fool? You’re comparing me to a tree-” He didn’t finish his sentence as he kicked his tongue in frustration.</p>
<p>“So, I can get my hopes up.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Lee-yeon passed him an odd look</p>
<p>“Your palms that only touched trees.”</p>
<p>A brief silence passed.</p>
<p>“I’ll become better quicker.” He was all time pressing his lips. Soon, the tip of his lips squirmed oddly like he was trying to hold back laughter.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon went blank. She dug her face within her knees. The corner of her heart was becoming dark. She really didn’t like this part about herself.</p>
