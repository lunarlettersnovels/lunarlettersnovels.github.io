            <p><strong>Chapter 154</strong></p>
<p>“By the way, it’s impressive that you made it all the way to the fourth round.”</p>
<p>There was a strange tone, neither congratulatory nor mocking. As Lee-yeon just stared silently, he added meaningfully as if there was nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>“You should have failed early even if you were meant to fail.” He said with seriousness in his gaze.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The voice that pierced deeply with such a normal expression was eerie, and Lee-yeon trembled involuntarily.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’ve given you many chances, but this is really becoming difficult.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“Miss Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Director Jo called out quietly, as if comforting a young disciple. He double checked if the big man he had seen before with her was not there and grabbed her shoulder.</p>
<p>Choo Ja exclaimed, “What is this old man doing?” and slapped Jo Kyung-chun’s hand, but he quickly whispered as if being chased by something.</p>
<p>“As you get closer to winning Hwaido project, you will hear or meet him at least once.”</p>
<p>“What…what do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Suguk Pharmaceuticals.”</p>
<p>“That’s a famous pharmaceutical company.”</p>
<p>“The Kwon family is behind it.”</p>
<p>She furrowed her brows at the unfamiliar story.</p>
<p>“If someone from that family tries to contact you….”</p>
<p>Jo Kyung-cheon swallowed hard as if he had a dry mouth. His usually carefree expression disappeared, and he held his breath and leaned in to listen.</p>
<p>“Don’t look back and run away.”</p>
<p>“….What?”</p>
<p>“Just avoid anyone with the surname Kwon for now.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>For a moment, her favorite name flashed through her mind, but she had other questions.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Jo Kyung-cheon closed his mouth for a moment as if choosing his words, then swallowed hard. He wanted to say so many things, but the fear of the Kwon family made him break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>He thought of how the rare plant discovered by So Yi-yeon was being used now…</p>
<p>In the end, Jo Kyung-cheon just cut off the branches and muttered empty words.</p>
<p>“A naive tree doctor can never handle it.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>She took out an old, dusty radio, and her nose itched as soon as she did. Lee-yeon inserted a CD that someone had left behind like a gift and clicked the stiff, protruding buttons.</p>
<p>Shostakovich: Sonata for Cello &amp; Piano in D Minor, Op. 40.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon traced the title of the piece written on the back of the case with her fingers.</p>
<p>Shostakovich’s Sonata for Cello &amp; Piano in D minor. Soon, a soft yet melancholy and poignant melody flowed out.</p>
<p>To her, the forest was like music.</p>
<p>If only one could summon a cool well in a barren wasteland where only humid winds blow, or a thunderous sky, it would be nothing but music. It shows the scenery that each person holds. Especially if one can draw a refreshing mountain field where the trees grow again and spring flowers bloom in the land that has become ruins.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon hoped that the changes they would achieve would provide some comfort to the residents who were waiting without any assurance.</p>
<p>So now it was urgent for her to find the most suitable instruments, songs, and performers.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Kwon Chae-woo knocked loudly, breaking through the gradually increasing vibrato of the strings.</p>
<p>The man was leaning against the door and staring at the old radio in front of him, and strangely, his complexion looked pale.</p>
<p>“Chae-woo, are you not feeling well? You look unwell.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Did you catch a cold?”</p>
<p>However, after a while of silence, Kwon Chae-woo suddenly clenched his fist and asked with a twitch of his jaw, “What kind of classical music is this?”</p>
<p>“Oh…I just took out a CD for the first time in a while to prepare for the exam.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Was it too noisy? I’ll put on my earphones. You can even lie down in bed, Chae-woo.”</p>
<p>“No, leave it. It’s actually refreshing to have my mind clear like this.”</p>
<p>He chuckled, twisting one side of his face. Once again, it was a side of him that Yeon didn’t know. Yeon tried to dispel her gnawing anxiety by biting her lips.</p>
<p>He grinned, his face contorting on one side. Once again, it was a side of him that Yeon didn’t know. Yeon bit her lip, trying to dispel the unease that crept up inside her.</p>
<p>“…Chae-woo used to have nightmares and cry when he was alone, but strangely, he seemed okay when this was playing.”</p>
<p>“That’s probably how it was before.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing.”</p>
<p>He suppressed all kinds of negative emotions behind his gentle smile.</p>
<p>“Oh… now that I think about it, it seems like Chae-woo hasn’t been crying lately. In the past, even if Chae-woo cried in his sleep, I would wake up immediately, but I haven’t seen any signs of that recently. Is it because I haven’t noticed, or is he sleeping comfortably?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon looked worried and tilted her head. Meanwhile, the cello sound from the radio was gradually intensifying.</p>
<p>All the movements that required pressing, plucking, and changing the angle of the bow to quickly scratch the strings without a break came to mind naturally. Even the image of her mother playing this piece came to mind. Kwun Chae-woo pressed his trembling eyebrows as if having a seizure and clenched his ears that were twitching.</p>
<p>“It looks like my tears have dried up. But that CD….”</p>
<p>“Oh, this is… from the person I mentioned last time–”</p>
<p>“Ah, a spoil you hid?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>It was impossible for Lee Yeon to not realize that the man in front of her was annoyed right now.</p>
<p>She felt an intangible sense of reprimand in his subtle tone, causing her heart to sink. “It’s not like that. I, I just didn’t say enough back then.”</p>
<p>However, Kwon Chae-woo’s gaze was already far away from her.</p>
<p>A CD case lying on the floor. Even at a glance, it was clear that it was stained with fingerprints and the gold coating had worn off. This woman wouldn’t even know that it was once a piece of a boy.</p>
<p>Eventually, the man murmured coolly, covering his eyes with his palm.</p>
<p>“Can you stop playing it? My ears hurt, Lee-yeon.” The body, which had been forced to stay awake for several days, was reaching its limit little by little.</p>
