        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 241</strong></p>
<p>There was the wet taste of rain lingering on their lips. The moment Kwon Chae-woo entered the room, he lunged at her, and Lee-yeon instinctively held onto his shoulders to steady herself.</p>
<p>He pressed his lips against hers, the wetness of their skin causing them to cling together more tightly. Amidst this, his tongue eagerly joined the dance.</p>
<p>“Ut…!” she gasped.</p>
<p>His tongue filled her mouth completely, the sensation overwhelming. Pushing her against the wall, he continued his assault on her lips. Lee-yeon struggled for breath, the man’s unbridled passion preventing her from escaping.</p>
<p>His lips persistently teased her soft ones. Each meeting of their tongues resulted in a blend of saliva, and Kwon Chae-woo savored every moment. He seemed unstoppable until, unexpectedly, Lee-yeon sneezed, breaking the intense connection.</p>
<p>Startled, he finally released her.</p>
<p>He lifted her up and went into the bedroom. Even as he was walking, he kept on kissing her lips as if he was dreaming. His eyes were so eager that they felt hot.</p>
<p>He grabbed her arm and took her sleeves off. Lee-yeon’s wet top was about to come off of her when she finally pushed him away in surprise.</p>
<p>She kept panting and covered her stomach. Her flat stomach had a bit of a bump.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, Kwon Chae-woo doesn’t know she’s pregnant. Her head felt numb at that moment.</p>
<p>Does Kwon Chae-woo like kids? She didn’t get such a vibe from him. It might be a bit overwhelming to become a father at the age of 28.</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon was thinking about mentioning this, her lips became tight.</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo seemed annoyed by the wet shirt coming off, so he was ripping it off.</p>
<p>He then bit both sleeves with his teeth and yanked them off. The buttons that were torn off rolled on the floor, and Kwon Chae-woo came onto the bed naked.</p>
<p>“W, why are you taking your clothes off?”</p>
<p>“You’ll catch a cold if you stay like this. You should also take your clothes off.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but I… Well, I….”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon backed off on her butt, but Kwon Chae-woo followed on his four.</p>
<p>“So, let’s talk, but not in this mood….”</p>
<p>“I wanted to wait, but sorry, I’m impatient.”</p>
<p>While Lee-yeon was hesitating, Kwon Chae-woo pushed her hand away and put his lips on her bellybutton.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon froze and he finally breathed out like he could live.</p>
<p>“I was dying to do this.”</p>
<p>“… What?”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“That reason why you only eat what I cook for you. And why you feel nauseated.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon felt uncertainty creeping in as she stared at Kwon Chae-woo, who locked eyes with her.</p>
<p>“You were really considering having a child without me?” he questioned.</p>
<p>“…!” Her mouth fell open. Lee-yeon couldn’t fathom how he knew, her thoughts in disarray.</p>
<p>Perhaps Kwon Chae-woo followed her and  Kwon Ki-seok at the event once he discovered her pregnancy. That must be it.  Still, within the confines of the Kwon family estate, Lee-yeon swiftly spoke as her mind raced.</p>
<p>“This child will be mine legally.”</p>
<p>He looked up, puzzled. “And what about me?” Kwon Chae-woo frowned. “So, this child will be a ‘So’? Just you two, without me?”</p>
<p>This wasn’t what she expected, and confusion caused her to blink rapidly.</p>
<p>“You and I don’t have any legal ties, Lee-yeon?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know….” Lee-yeon mumbled, averting her gaze. He paused, studying her, then pressed himself against her. Their legs intertwined, and their bare stomachs touched.</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon found herself fully on the bed, he made a cold request.</p>
<p>“Make me a ‘So’ too.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to change my name.”</p>
<p>“… Uh, Kwon Chae-woo, wake up. You in Korea change their last name for a woman?”</p>
<p>“You were the one who’s secluding me.”</p>
<p>“I mean…“</p>
<p>Lee-yeon haven’t felt this frustration in a while, and she sighed. She glanced at Kwon Chae-woo and he seemed very serious. His eyes were staring at her like she was at fault.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the type of threat Lee-yeon was thinking about. She just couldn’t tell what made him think this.</p>
<p>“If I can’t use it as my last name, I’m going to put it as last part of my first.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be Kwon Chae-so.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon opened her mouth in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I don’t like being the only one not being associated with you. You can’t say only my dick matters.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What are you…”</p>
<p>It seemed like Kwon Chae-woo already had an imaginary wedding. Lee-yeon was familiar with this kind of behavior and she regret for a moment whether this was the biggest mistake of her life.</p>
<p>“I know that I can live alone well unlike you, Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>He put his lips against her thumping heart.</p>
<p>“So I’m going to bet my last part of my life on you and prove it to you every moment. That I’m someone you need.”</p>
<p>He sucked on the unrevealing part of her chest and left a mark. It was his promise.</p>
<p>“And I only have one thing I want to tell the child.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“That dad loves mom with all his heart.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>That was the same thing that Lee-yeon told herself at one point. That she wouldn’t live without love and that she’ll teach her child.</p>
<p>She could feel her nose tingle. The man looked into her eyes so eagerly that she couldn’t look away. Nothing was said but her ears were turning red.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon was hoping that this man wouldn’t know about Yoon Joo-ha’s death until the end. The world itself was full of awful stories and Lee-yeon no longer wanted to see him blame himself even a little.</p>
<p>But if Kwon Chae-woo was to find out, Lee-yeon was thinking about doing all she could to help him heal. Trees heal as much effort as you put in. She didn’t doubt she could do this for even a moment.</p>
<p>“…. But what exactly is your job?” Lee-yeon smiled tearfully while asking. “You really are four years younger than me right?”</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon’s voice became a bit arrogant, Kwon Chae-woo chuckled.</p>
<p>“You have your memory back now so tell me. Who is your first love?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You graduated from university abroad, so did you play all dirty there? How badly?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Have you dated a foreigner?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon kept throwing all kinds of awkward questions.</p>
