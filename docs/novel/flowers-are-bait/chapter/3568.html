            <p><strong>Chapter 215</strong></p>
<p>“It’s not Director Kwon; it’s actually because of master.” Lee-yeon’s shoulders stiffened, and Jang Beom-hee quickly added, “Don’t worry; master doesn’t know.”</p>
<p>“What?” Lee-yeon interjected in shock, and Jang Beom-hee continued, “Master sometimes receives certain injections.”</p>
<p>“Wait, is he using drugs?!” Lee-yeon exclaimed in alarm, and Jang Beom-hee paused before responding.</p>
<p>“No, it’s a type of neural stimulant. He started taking it to endure his pain since his time at Hwaido.”</p>
<p>“But I switched that for a sleeping pill. It’s not just Master who reached his limit; it’s me watching him, too.”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee stood rigidly by the door, looking down at Lee-yeon with an expressionless face.</p>
<p>“So, please, I’m begging you, help us a little.”</p>
<p>“What exactly…” Lee-yeon began to question when Jang Beom-hee opened the door. Inside, Lee-yeon saw Kwon Chae-woo collapsed on the bed and a woman she had never seen before.</p>
<p>“Could you please lend me the clothes you’re wearing right now?” Jang Beom-hee’s voice grew cold.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Somehow, her fingertips stiffened with a dizzying sensation that felt like a blow to the back of her head. While checking the time out of habit and trying to assess whether Kwon Chae-woo was outside the door or not had become a routine, it wasn’t the case in this situation.</p>
<p>“Will you help?”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stared at the woman, dressed only in a bathrobe, her lips tightly sealed.</p>
<p>The woman in front of her had a similar height and build, a flowing hairstyle, and delicate facial features, much like Lee-yeon herself. Even the bathrobe she wore seemed to be the same as the one she used at Hwaedo.</p>
<p>All of this felt like it was set up for Kwon Chae-woo.</p>
<p>As Lee-yeon stood there in confusion, Jang Beom-hee briskly whispered, “If this goes well, it will be easier for you too, So Lee-yeon.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s heart raced like a drum in response to Jang Beom-hee’s implied urgency.</p>
<p>“Unless we solve the sleep problem, So Lee-yeon will be the only one suffering. Unless you plan to live with the Master forever, you should help here.”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee tactfully conveyed her point, lowering her head as if requesting assistance.</p>
<p>It was a valid point. Kwon Chae-woo needed to find a new method and solution as soon as possible, and perhaps it would also help lessen his obsession.</p>
<p>Moreover, this situation had only arisen because Lee-yeon herself had suggested it to Kwon Chae-woo not long ago. So, she felt she had a responsibility to act.</p>
<p>Clenching her front hem tightly, Lee-yeon asked, “Where should I change my clothes?”</p>
<p>“If you go into that room over there, we have prepared new clothes for you.”</p>
<p>Without giving the bed a second glance, Lee-yeon walked into the room, working on the buttons of her work clothes. But suddenly, her fingers grew tense. Her mouth had been dry, and her heart had been pounding irregularly ever since a while ago.</p>
<p>Still, this was the right thing to do, Lee-yeon told herself. She was soon to leave this place, and Kwon Chae-woo needed to get proper sleep to carry on with his life. So, this was the right direction and the right choice.</p>
<p>“Have you changed into everything?”</p>
<p>Just then, the door creaked open, and a woman’s face peeked through the gap. Seeing the woman with the same eye level, a similar image to herself, Lee-yeon was left speechless.</p>
<p>The woman came in with a bright smile, casually took off her shower robe, revealing her back and buttocks. Lee-yeon was startled and turned her head when she saw the exposed back and buttocks.</p>
<p>“Your scent is quite unique.”</p>
<p>The woman, holding Lee-yeon’s work clothes, commented lightly as she sniffed the clothes. She then began to efficiently put on the leggings and sleeves one by one.</p>
<p>“Do you have any sleep habits?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The woman, now finishing buttoning up the last button of the work clothes, turned to Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>“Anything will do, like moving your body or talking in your sleep. I’m a professional even though I’m nameless. So, I want to do a good job.”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon stayed silent.</p>
<p>“It’s not a difficult job, really. Just sleep quietly next to a man. Do you know how healthy and profitable that can be? Plus, he seems to be an interesting man with a story.”</p>
<p>Silence persisted.</p>
<p>“By the way, how do you touch him while sleeping?” As Lee-yeon remained wordless, the woman’s probing gaze landed squarely on her.</p>
<p>“Ah… I guess you weren’t very active.” The woman answered for Lee-yeon.</p>
<p>The woman then began to tie her hair into a neat bundle, observing it closely to match Lee-yeon’s hairstyle, nail length, and even the habitual breathing pattern.</p>
<p>Despite the awkwardness of the situation, Lee-yeon couldn’t help but think, “She’s a real pro.” She considered, “With someone like her, maybe…”</p>
<p><em>Let’s think positively, So Lee-yeon. Maybe this could truly be a path to liberation.</em></p>
<p>The woman on the bed was now getting closer to Kwon Chae-woo, moving on her knees.</p>
<p>Silence filled the room.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Lee-yeon and Jang Beom-hee were both tense for different reasons. Lee-yeon’s legs refused to move in this strange and unsettling situation, while Jang Beom-hee remained on high alert due to Kwon Chae-woo’s highly developed senses and innate temperament, honed through his training as a hunting dog.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, are you going to keep staring like that?” The woman asked Jang Beom-hee who was watching her moves like a hawk.</p>
<p>“I’m on standby in case of any unforeseen circumstances.”</p>
<p>Jang Beom-hee replied sternly when the woman glanced their way. She seemed perplexed by his response but quickly averted her gaze.</p>
<p>“Well… you seem to be used to it anyway.” She commented.</p>
<p>Soon, she casually took Kwon Chae-woo’s arm, slipping it into hers.</p>
