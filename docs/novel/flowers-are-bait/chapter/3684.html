            <p><strong>Chapter 95</strong></p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo wrapped his tongue around Lee-yeon’s swollen nipple and sucked on it, groaning against her skin as he did. Every now and then, he would stop to flick it, and her toes would curl as she let out a moan.</p>
<p>The more contact he had with her nipple, the harder it seemed to become, and the more he continued to suck on it. He squeezed her breasts as his lips worked against her skin and Lee-yeon couldn’t help the sinful sounds that slipped from her lips.</p>
<p>Finally, Kwon Chae-woo pulled away. “Sit on my face,” he said.</p>
<p>Her mind hazy from pleasure, Lee-yeon looked at him with clouded eyes. “What?”</p>
<p>“Here,” Kwon Chae-woo said as he tapped on his lips. He leaned back and lay down on the bed, pulling her thighs towards him as he did.</p>
<p>Still lost in her thoughts, Lee-yeon didn’t even realize what he was doing until he tried to pull her close. “Wait!” she said. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“I need to suck you properly,” he told her.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s eyes widened. “Isn’t that a little much?”</p>
<p>Ignoring her protests, Kwon Chae-woo began to pull her closer. “Come up here, Lee-yeon,” he said as he aggressively began to undress her and pull her thighs over his head.</p>
<p>Frantically, Lee-yeon held onto the headboard to try to keep her balance. A blush spread across her cheeks when she realized that she was now completely naked.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, you’re so pretty,” Kwon Chae-woo told her innocently, as if his face wasn’t right in front of her heat. He could see her struggling to keep herself up and away from him and his eyes became darker. For her sake, he tried to hide his smile when he realized how naughty the position that they were in was.</p>
<p>But he eventually lost his patience and decided to take matters into his own hands. Roughly, he pushed Lee-yeon’s thighs down so that she was exactly where he wanted her.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon let out sounds of pleasure as Kwon Chae-woo began to nibble on the insides of her thighs. Then, he stuck his tongue out and licked a stripe of her pussy.</p>
<p>“Oh!” Lee-yeon exclaimed, her thighs beginning to tremble. She gripped the headboard with all her might.</p>
<p>As he continued to lick and kiss her growing heat, Kwon Chae-woo could feel her tender flesh pulsing which just made the experience more stimulating. Eventually, he pushed his tongue inside her and Lee-yeon let out a moan. She squirmed as he began to suck on her clit.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon’s arms were shaking now as moans continued to pour out of her mouth. Kwon Chae-woo kept playing with her hole, sucking it and licking it, as he squeezed her thigh tightly. The more Lee-yeon tried to squirm out of his grasp, the tighter his grip became.</p>
<p>The sounds coming from Kwon Chae-woo were dirty as he slurped and licked at her witness. He would stick his tongue out and rub it against the spot inside her that brought her that made her back arch.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon could feel the heat between her legs start to grow as he touched her where she was most sensitive. If she wasn’t so dazed by the pleasure of it, she would have been embarrassed by the sounds coming from both of them.</p>
<p>Then, Kwon Chae-woo lifted Lee-yeon up and changed their positions so that she lay beneath him. He pulled down his pants and quickly tugged his underwear away. His cock slapped against his stomach and he frowned as he saw the pre-cum dripping from the tip.</p>
<p>“Lee-yeon, is it true that the flower is the plant’s reproductive organ?” he asked.</p>
<p>Lee-yeon nodded, her eyebrows furrowed as she was unsure of where he was going with his. “Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo smirked down at her. “Then I don’t need another flower.”</p>
<p>He spread her legs and brushed his hardness against skin. Lee-yeon moaned as it touched her sensitive clit. Then, out of nowhere, Kwon Chae-woo thrust sharply into her.</p>
<p>They both moaned at the action. Lee-yeon could feel her body tingling with pleasure and pain. She reached down to try and soothe herself, but Kwon Chae-woo beat her to it and began to rub her side gently.</p>
<p>“A condom,” Lee-yeon suddenly said, eyes shooting open. “Kwon Chae-woo, you’re not wearing a condom!”</p>
<p>Kwon Chae-woo watched her panic with a smile. “Why should I wear one?” he asked as he rubbed her clit. Her head rolled back in pleasure. “Do I not deserve to be a dad?” Lee-yeon’s hips moved against him instinctively.</p>
<p>She tried to speak, but her words were swallowed by her groans.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you answering, huh?” Kwon Chae-woo teased her, continuing his attack on her clit. “Well, it doesn’t matter anyway. I’ll still be a dad even if you keep your mouth shut.”</p>
<p>When she didn’t answer again, he scoffed and started to pull out of her. As she felt herself start to grow empty, Lee-yeon felt a chill run through her spine.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Kwon Chae-woo whispered before plunging right back into her in one swift movement. She let out a scream as he thrust in and out of her wildly. “I have no intention of giving up on anything.”</p>
