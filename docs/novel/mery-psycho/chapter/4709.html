        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 93.2</strong></p>
<p>The gap between them was too wide to bridge, leaving him plagued by a cognitive dissonance that throbbed like a headache. Why did something that was merely a target, a mission long since completed, bother him so much?</p>
<p>It was when she relentlessly pushed herself in the search for her missing husband that he finally found the real Han Seoryeong.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a “discovery.” In those moments when she tore through the paper he had read with indifference, when she burst out of the document, every single moment had struck him like a shock.</p>
<p>― “But is the owl really that kind of person? The doctor said she’s indifferent to others’ pain, ignores rules easily, and only sees violence as a tool. She acts selfishly and is hostile to most people.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>― “By now, I’m not even sure if she’s searching for Kim Hyun solely out of love!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>― “Team leader, are you sure you want to stay involved with the owl? Maybe it’s time to pull back? I went through all the data, and I’m really scared of getting on the owl’s bad side.”</p>
<p>“I can’t pull back.”</p>
<p>―“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“It’s too late.”</p>
<p>He didn’t elaborate, merely looking indifferent.</p>
<p>If the real Han Seoryeong had a brutal nature, then it would mean she had been putting on an act in front of her husband.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a slight chuckle escaped him.</p>
<p>Damn, she’s adorable.</p>
<p>The heat that always flared up when he saw her now seemed to be subsiding, as if finally quenched.</p>
<p>In the end, what he had wanted to confirm were these little things, things he had never bothered to figure out in the past.</p>
<p>― “Anyway, my conclusion is this: The deputy edited the data to suit her needs. But it’s unclear what exactly she was trying to hide. Having a nasty personality is common these days, and childhood memories fade as we grow. The only thing that sticks out is that phrase she kept repeating like a parrot.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a hollow thud echoed from the linen suit as if something had hit it. Lee Wooshin bent over to look inside the shiny metal canister.</p>
<p>His brows furrowed, his sharp gaze turning more expert-like. The aluminum material quivered slightly. The hesitant voice continued.</p>
<p>―“There may have been some classified information hidden in the owl’s lost memories.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>― “That’s why I think she was constantly checked and monitored. Of course, it’s just my hypothesis!”</p>
<p>At that moment, a figure passed through the linen suit and landed softly in a pile of towels. It was Deputy Joo Seolheon, who lay unconscious and limp. Lee Wooshin’s face, staring downward, carried a cold expression.</p>
<p>“People are driven by fear, fundamentally.”</p>
<p>― “Pardon?”</p>
<p>“What I mean is, everyone has a door tightly locked somewhere.”</p>
<p>― “…”</p>
<p>“Well done, you’ve brought something useful.”</p>
<p>He ended the call, pressing his fingers against his superior’s neck. His unreadable gaze lingered near her artery.</p>
<p>He then took out the phone from Deputy Joo’s pocket and pressed the power button for a long time. Another heavy thud followed as he dropped her into the large linen cart.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>The linen pile swayed, and someone’s familiar breath tickled his ear.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin lowered his mask and extended his hand as if he had been waiting. But Seoryeong, drained from carrying someone up the stairs, simply shook her head wearily.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, he slipped his hands under her armpits and lifted her effortlessly.</p>
<p>“Who told you to go limp in the middle of an operation?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Put strength in your legs and stand up straight.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“You haven’t even finished the job properly yet.”</p>
<p>Clearly, something deep inside him had gone terribly off course.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>The two of them pushed the cart out and finally exited through the underground passage connected to the department store.</p>
<p>Outside, the area was in chaos, with fire trucks and ambulances lined up.</p>
<p>Seoryeong headed straight to the ambulance she had parked in a corner and opened the back door. Lee Wooshin, carrying the deputy on his back, scowled as he watched her.</p>
<p>“You’ll drive,” she said, tossing him the car keys. Seoryeong laid Deputy Joo on the emergency bed in the back and expertly bound her wrists and ankles with Velcro straps.</p>
<p>The inside of the ambulance was filled with familiar medical equipment. A wall with belts, dirty surgical gloves, a peeling portable oxygen tank, and a defibrillator, among other things. But the space felt oddly cold and worn down, sending a chill through his chest, knowing what she planned to do here.</p>
<p>“We’ll leave when the other ambulances pull out,” she said.</p>
<p>“When did you prepare this?” Lee Wooshin asked, turning the ignition with an incredulous look.</p>
<p>“It’s from the nursing home I used to work at. They ran a private ambulance service. I called to check, and they were about to scrap this old one, so I bought it cheap.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“That way, we can keep going without being interrupted.”</p>
<p>She threw off her jacket and rolled up the sleeves of her white blouse. Lee Woo-shin couldn’t help but let out a slight laugh. An ambulance—a tight space where they would never get caught.</p>
<p>Soon, the red emergency lights started flashing, and they merged safely onto the road. With a flick of the blinker to thank the cars making way for them, they sped down the highway.</p>
