            <p><strong>Chapter 102.2</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong’s vision blurred, her body trembling uncontrollably. The pain had shifted into something deeper—raw, almost too much to bear.</p>
<p>It felt like she was being pulled apart, every nerve alight. She’d never experienced anything like this before; nothing had ever pushed her so far beyond her usual boundaries.</p>
<p>The slick, wet sounds filled the room, heightening the overwhelming intensity. Her breaths came in ragged gasps as she struggled to keep up.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah!” Seroyeong’s cries were involuntary; her lips parted as her body gave in to the rhythm. It felt like falling endlessly, a dizzying plunge she couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>And then, the dam broke.</p>
<p>A hot rush of release tore through her, leaving her trembling and breathless.</p>
<p>Lee Woo-shin withdrew his fingers with precision, almost as if he’d been waiting for the moment.</p>
<p>Before she could fully catch her breath, he leaned in, his lips pressing against her trembling flesh.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Her voice cracked as he slapped her firmly on the hip, his movements urging her on. Her abdomen tensed, and another gush followed, clear and unstoppable.</p>
<p>didn’t falter, tilting his head to spread her legs wider, his tongue chasing every drop.</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s body was on the verge of collapse, trembling under his intense attention.</p>
<p>“This is too much,” she gasped, her words barely coherent.</p>
<p>He responded only with a low, satisfied hum, the bridge of his nose brushing against her oversensitized cl*t. The slightest touch sent jolts through her, making her flinch.</p>
<p>“Hah… enough, stop,” she stammered, her voice shaky, her body still trembling.</p>
<p>Lee Woo-shin didn’t listen. He hoisted her legs up, tugged her panties free, and tossed them aside like they were nothing.</p>
<p>She thought it was over, her body ready to collapse—but then he moved closer. Before she could react, he was on all fours and looming over her, his hand grabbing her chin firmly.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>Her breath caught. His eyes bore into hers, wild and untethered, like something had snapped inside him. Those eyes, usually distant and bored, were now sharp with intensity, filled with something raw and unrestrained.</p>
<p>His flushed face hovered closer, his throat bobbing slowly as he swallowed. For a moment, she could only stare, her thoughts scrambled by his sudden shift.</p>
<p>The bed creaked as he leaned down.</p>
<p>“Instructor… mmph—!”</p>
<p>His lips crashed against hers, hot and demanding, stealing her breath. Her lips parted, and his tongue pressed inside, pushing deeper than she thought possible.</p>
<p>He held her chin tightly, keeping her in place as his mouth dominated hers. Their tongues clashed, sliding and tangling with a wet heat that left her no room to think or resist.</p>
<p>“Uh…!”</p>
<p>The inside of her cheek trembled. An uncontrollable heat surged. He repeatedly changed angles, devouring her lips.</p>
<p>His canines grazed her lower lip, and his thick tongue invaded her salivary glands.</p>
<p>Soon, his large hand slipped under Seoryeong’s top and bra in one swift motion. Lee Woo-shin grabbed her round breasts and let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>Even though it wasn’t her first kiss, the strange pleasure made her lower abdomen heat up even more.</p>
<p>Seoryeong, unable to breathe, tapped him. Their saliva-soaked lips parted for a moment, and their eyes met.</p>
<p>His burning eyes seemed to hold many stories, but Seoryeong was too breathless to take it all in.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s chest heaved as he kissed her forehead, the tip of her nose, and the top of her mouth like a bird. He whispered in a husky voice, thick with emotion.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, I wanted to treat you well, but other times I wanted to treat you harshly. You’ve always been like that to me from the beginning.”</p>
<p>From the beginning? When was that? She pondered in her dazed mind.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he straightened his back while pressing down on her body. Then he crossed his arms and began to take off his shirt. His muscular arms and shoulders rose, and a masculine scent wafted over her.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong furrowed her nose unconsciously. She had smelled something similar on her husband before, but this scent was stronger and more ferocious.</p>
<p>He roughly shook off the static from his hair and threw his shirt far away.</p>
<p>His entire upper body was covered with muscles that had likely been developed through real combat.</p>
<p>From his shoulders to his chest, abdomen, and pelvis, every part was meticulously sculpted. The skin on his sides, divided into external and internal obliques, was rough and elegant as if carved with a chisel.</p>
<p>Finally, when he removed his pants and underwear together.</p>
<p>“――.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong was at a loss for words. What… is that?</p>
<p>The object, leaking pre-c*m, was much larger and redder than she remembered. Seoryeong blinked continuously as if trying to clear away the darkness.</p>
<p>The pulsing veins were intimidating. Like a twisted old tree, the tattoo winding around the erect pillar was bizarre. It was even hairless. The subtle pink hue was both obscene and beautiful.</p>
<p>“Turn on the light.”</p>
<p>She spoke in a trembling voice. She stared so intently that her eyes stung, and strangely, her nose tingled. Her vision blurred over unhealed wounds that surged up.</p>
<p>Without warning, tears spilled down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“My husband… sniff… he looks… hic… similar…” she choked out, swallowing her sobs. For one night, she just wanted to forget Kim Hyun and everything tied to him.</p>
<p>The shock, whether from resentment or sorrow, shook her.</p>
<p>“In the living room drawer, sniff, there’s a magnifying glass… please… quickly…”</p>
