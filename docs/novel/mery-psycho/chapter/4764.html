            <p><strong>Chapter 65.1</strong></p>
<p>Han Seoryeong was the one bitten unluckily, but a sense of crisis grew as Lee Wooshin closed in, making her feel like she would be bitten even more severely.</p>
<p>His irises were transparently pale in the sunlight, reflecting off the lens. The cold color, reminiscent of a shark’s spine, sent chills down her spine.</p>
<p>Moreover, Wooshin was chasing her fiercely with a broad smile as if intoxicated by dopamine. Seeing his face, which was fully intent on the hunt, made cold sweat trickle down Seoryeong’s face.</p>
<p>For some reason, the thought that it would be the end if she got caught made Seoryeong run frantically through the mountain path, her leg muscles ready to burst.</p>
<p><em>How far have I come?</em> In her anxiety, even my sense of direction momentarily froze.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, stop! Don’t go any further!”</p>
<p>At that moment, he shouted from right behind her.</p>
<p>Before Han Seoryeong knew it, Lee Wooshin had caught up, and his rough nails scratched the back of her neck. Simultaneously, her feet sank below her, making her whole body tilt.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>Everything happened in an instant.</p>
<p>The ground, which she mistook for solid, collapsed, revealing a steep cliff.</p>
<p>Before she even realized that the spot she stepped on was not solid ground but a pit covered thickly with snow, her body helplessly plummeted.</p>
<p>Her guts twisted, causing a nauseating sensation. No matter how much she flailed her limbs, there was nothing for her shoes to grip. Terrified to the point of forgetting to breathe, her mouth gaped open.</p>
<p><em>So, I can die like this without any meaning. Without even seeing my husband’s face one last time, just like this.</em></p>
<p>Seoryeong’s chest burned with anger as she squeezed her eyes shut, but suddenly, a tearing pain shot through her shoulder.</p>
<p>“<em>Ugh</em>!”</p>
<p>“Why the hell are you running away? Do you think a snow-covered mountain is a joke?”</p>
<p>“Damn it, were you planning to die in front of me…!”</p>
<p>A harsh yell clawed its way out of Lee Wooshin’s throat, turning his familiar voice into something unrecognizable.</p>
<p>The first thing she saw was a military camouflage pattern. Lee Wooshin was holding onto a tree branch growing out from the cliff, with his other hand gripping Seoryeong’s wrist.</p>
<p>“Instructor…” Their eyes met, both filled with helplessness.</p>
<p>Seoryeong looked at him, unable to believe he had kept her from falling, and his gaze shifted past her to the distant void, calculating something.</p>
<p>Seoryeong was barely alive, thanks to Lee Wooshin’s grip. They both grimaced for different reasons.</p>
<p>Then, the hand desperately clutching Seoryeong’s forearm started to slip.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Her heart dropped, and a short scream escaped.</p>
<p>“Da*n it.” Lee Wooshin gritted his teeth and lifted his chin. Veins bulged like roots on his reddened neck. The trembling of his grip was palpable through his skin.</p>
<p>However, the weight of two people bundled in winter gear was much heavier than expected.</p>
<p>As his breath became irregular, he issued a firm command. “Grit your teeth and climb onto my back.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Do what you do best. There’s no time!”</p>
<p>When she hesitated, Lee Wooshin struggled to steady his rough voice. “Have you ever missed the first place when climbing ropes with your bare hands?”</p>
<p>“.…”</p>
<p>“So, you can do this.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never climbed a person before!”</p>
<p>“I’ll hold you up, so stop nagging and come up!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong snapped to attention at his cold command. She quickly composed her body, which had been hanging limp. She took the dagger and wire from her pocket and put them in her mouth, then took off her coat to reduce weight.</p>
<p>“Whoa. Whoa. Let go.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Let go of me!” She shook her captured arm, urging him.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin blinked for a moment, then furrowed his brows. Realizing what she meant, his Adam’s apple bobbed nervously.</p>
<p>But the hesitation was brief.</p>
<p>He dug his nails into her delicate arm that he was gripping like a lifeline. He glared at her with eyes sharp as blades and then began to release his grip without hesitation.</p>
<p>As his hand loosened, Seoryeong let her coat drop and kicked her legs upward.</p>
