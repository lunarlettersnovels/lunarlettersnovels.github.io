            <p><strong>Chapter 163.2</strong></p>
<p>A beast-like roar shattered her eardrums. Lee Wooshin staggered but sprinted straight toward her.</p>
<p>Even without wild flailing, the sheer speed of his charge sent a shiver down her spine.</p>
<p>“You f*cking psycho!”</p>
<p>She slammed the accelerator, lurching forward in a sharp start. Fear drove her to push the jeep even faster, swerving sharply into the desert zone. A cloud of dust obscured the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>“Hah… hahk…!”</p>
<p>The car filled with the sound of her ragged breathing. The moment his figure vanished, her mouth went even drier.</p>
<p>She knew better than anyone, Lee Wooshin never gave up. He had taught her that himself.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Right on cue, a clean gunshot rang out, screech! The steering wheel jerked violently as the rear tire blew out, throwing the jeep off balance.</p>
<p>“Sh*t!”</p>
<p>She slammed the brakes and wrestled with the wheel, fighting to regain control. As she steadied herself and checked the mirror, she saw Lee Wooshin calmly reloading his shotgun.</p>
<p>“You son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>How the hell was she supposed to shake him off? Frustration twisted her face.</p>
<p>If dr*gs didn’t work, if restraints didn’t work,</p>
<p>“You can’t leave unless you kill me.” His words echoed in her ears.</p>
<p>‘Darn bastard… till the very end.’</p>
<p>He was the one in the wrong, yet he showed no remorse, not even a hint of surrender.</p>
<p>Swallowing the bitter lump in her throat, Seoryeong grabbed the hunting rifle she had tossed aside earlier.</p>
<p>Leaning out the window, she fired warning shots while flooring the accelerator.</p>
<p>Bang, bang-bang, !</p>
<p>‘Don’t come after me. Please, just stop!’</p>
<p>Yet the remaining three tires burst in quick succession. Despite the hail of bullets flying past him, Lee Wooshin didn’t flinch, he was systematically crippling her escape.</p>
<p>The now-useless jeep ground to a halt. Seoryeong cursed and kicked the driver’s door wide open.</p>
<p>Endless desert road, not a single blade of grass in sight.</p>
<p>The moment she stepped out, she raised her rifle and aimed straight at him.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She glared at him with sheer exhaustion in her eyes. Was it really this hard to make him disappear from her life?</p>
<p>She had already signaled Kia to come after her, but she couldn’t be sure when or how he’d appear. Still, with Russian forces stationed in Azerbaijan, Kia would find her eventually.</p>
<p>“Stop chasing me, or I will kill you.”</p>
<p>“Two to the body, one to the head.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“Do you remember what you were taught?”</p>
<p>He approached slowly, his expression indifferent.</p>
<p>“I told you to stay back!”</p>
<p>“Did you really think you could leave me without being prepared for this?”</p>
<p>He clicked his tongue in disapproval.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin was referring to the Mozambique Drill, something he had taught her back in training. The same drill where he had suddenly fired bullets into her bulletproof vest.</p>
<p>Now that she thought about it, he had always been like this, pushing her nerves to the limit.</p>
<p>“I taught you to use it when you need to completely stop your target. The goal is to put them down, even if it means killing them. I made sure you learned that firsthand.”</p>
<p>He didn’t look angry. But the razor-sharp glint in his eyes made Seoryeong flinch. It was the same gaze that had frozen her in place at the peak of a glacier.</p>
<p>Why was he still like this? Even now, when everything had been exposed, his eyes burned with desperate greed.</p>
<p>“Now that you know who I really am, then do you also know the wife that lived at my side?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You cared about her, didn’t you? My first woman.”</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth and adjusted her grip on the rifle. At the very least, he wouldn’t come any closer than an effective firing range.</p>
<p>But Lee Wooshin kept walking until the cold muzzle of the gun pressed firmly against his chest. The weight of it made her fingers stiffen.</p>
<p>“I was Kim Hyun. And you were my wife.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“No matter what anyone says, I was your husband. So why?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he exploded.</p>
<p>“Why do I have to lose you again?!”</p>
<p>His face twisted as if crumbling under the weight of fury.</p>
<p>“I can’t do that anymore. That’s why I quit being an agent. I didn’t want anyone interfering, not with our life together, not with us sleeping in the same bed, not even with our naps. The only thing I know is how to eliminate threats, and now there’s nothing left in my way!”</p>
<p>The cold night wind tangled his disheveled hair.</p>
<p>“Anyone else, I could’ve handled. But why…”</p>
<p>Dressed in his dirtied tuxedo, he looked like a man who had lost his way.</p>
<p>“Why did you, Han Seoryeong, have to be the one standing in our way?”</p>
