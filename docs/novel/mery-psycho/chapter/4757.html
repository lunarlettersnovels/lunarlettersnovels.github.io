            <p><strong>Chapter 68.2</strong></p>
<p>Lee Wooshin silenced her with another kiss. His ragged breathing intertwined with hers, digging in deeper.</p>
<p>Determined not to use his tongue, he pressed his mouth against her gums, sucking on her lower teeth as if to extract them. Her held jaw tingled, and when she swallowed the saliva that naturally flowed, a tightness gripped her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>It was a heat she shouldn’t feel, one that induced guilt.</p>
<p>Seoryeong weighed his words.</p>
<p>Was my husband bad at kissing?</p>
<p>Kim Hyun was so innocent after all.</p>
<p>Eventually, Lee Wooshin sucked her lips hard enough to make a popping sound as he let go.</p>
<p>Their fiercely shaking eyes met. He looked shameless while she was confused. However, as time passed, a subtle regret began to build in his eyes as well.</p>
<p>No, rather than regret… it was closer to disappointment. He looked like someone choking.</p>
<p>Even if he had bitten a corpse’s lips, he wouldn’t look this devastated.</p>
<p>A terrible mistake.</p>
<p>The moment she read that expression, Seoryeong felt a wave of relief. Thank goodness it was only a blunder she could forget as soon as she turned away.</p>
<p>“You might as well have gone all the way.”</p>
<p>Changing the subject was always best for diffusing the tension. She pretended not to notice her burning lips and continued.</p>
<p>“With your personality, leaving an annoying wife alone must’ve driven you mad.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Since it can’t be resolved, it became a trauma. You nitpick people over minor things like biting someone’s lips. You should fix that attitude if you want to work well with others.”</p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>“If you feel a bit better, think of it as a debt you owe me.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he seemed to lose strength and let his body droop, resting his chin on the top of Seoryeong’s head. Every time he took a deep breath in and out, her hair tickled and swayed.</p>
<p>“If I were you, I wouldn’t have let that wife of yours get away with it.”</p>
<p>She imagined for a moment her husband writing down a list of women’s names. This thought filled her chest with a fiery rage far greater than the warmth Lee Wooshin had provided.</p>
<p>Regaining her composure, Seoryeong spoke again. “You must have met people based on their looks, so you end up with strange ones.”</p>
<p>“And did you not consider looks when you met someone, Sergeant Han Seoryeong?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see anything at that time. I was blinded by love.”</p>
<p>“So, did it turn out well?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Seoryeong had no comeback, so she clamped her mouth shut in frustration. At that moment, Lee Wooshin’s expression changed as if he was assessing something.</p>
<p>“But Sergeant Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>With a hardened face, he gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>“What have you been doing since earlier?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Fearing another comment about the kiss, she feigned ignorance. Lee Wooshin’s eyes narrowed as he demanded sharply,</p>
<p>“Where do you think you’re touching?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Their eyes locked once again. His sharp, scolding gaze made her quickly withdraw her hand from his crotch.</p>
<p>Her hand had reached his groin as she searched for a warm place.</p>
<p>I thought you were busy melting your lips with mine. Seoryeong averted her gaze and stammered out an excuse.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I didn’t realize. My hands were cold, and it was the warmest place.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think it was a hot pack, but it’s very useful.”</p>
<p>“This is unbelievable…” As he let out a sigh that sounded like a curse, Seoryeong shot back defensively.</p>
<p>“But you put your fingers in mine too!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“And this isn’t a training session; it’s a real situation. You’re being really petty, keeping all the warmth to yourself. Let’s share the heat.”</p>
<p>Instead of removing her hand, she wedged both hands deeper between his legs, beneath his groin.</p>
<p>Ah, this really is the warmest spot. She vaguely felt it growing hard, but in her chilled state, she only appreciated the increasing warmth.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lee Wooshin abruptly moved his arm from around her and muttered harshly,</p>
<p>“Enough, get out.”</p>
<p>As he mercilessly pulled down the zipper of his padded jacket to let her out,</p>
<p>Bang, bang—! The sound of something pounding and chunks of ice falling like hail filled the air. Looking up, she saw the soles of someone’s spiked shoes moving.</p>
<p>“Team Leader!”</p>
<p>A familiar voice echoed. The person descending on a rope, connecting the harnesses on his upper and lower body, was Instructor Jin Hojae. He removed his goggles and called out reassuringly.</p>
<p>“Are you okay? I moved as soon as I got the signal!”</p>
<p>Other instructors rappelling down the ice wall came into view. Seoryeong quickly checked the long rope binding Lee Wooshin.</p>
<p>He was safe, and the big guy had calmed down.</p>
<p>Finally, it was time to go home.</p>
