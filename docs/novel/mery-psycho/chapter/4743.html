        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 75.2</strong></p>
<p>Her hand, busy writing down the account numbers, paused.</p>
<p>―I want to see you too. I… I miss you a lot, Seoryeong. Have you forgotten how good I was to you? I loved you just as fiercely as you loved me.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>―Once everything is settled, I’ll come back to the house we used to live in.</p>
<p>At that moment, ding-dong—the illusion of her husband coming home and ringing the doorbell crept into her mind. Maybe it was just a fantasy, a delusion born of her muddled thoughts. The ordinary life she once took for granted flashed before her eyes.</p>
<p>―Until then, wait quietly.</p>
<p>But isn’t it strange? She felt more lonely and empty now, even as she spoke to him, than she had when she was only yearning for his presence. Something felt off, misaligned.</p>
<p>―If you keep playing games with the National Intelligence Service and causing unintended trouble for the country, it’ll only delay my return. Is that what you want, Seoryeong? By the way, have you finished writing the account numbers?</p>
<p>It was a strange feeling. His words were soft as always, but something in them felt unsettling. His voice, his familiar tone—these belonged to her husband, but it felt like she was speaking to someone else.</p>
<p>Could this be his true nature as an NIS agent? Even so, something still felt.</p>
<p>“Are you… confused about something, Hyun?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong slowly turned her stiff neck, carefully choosing her words.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll make you dinner if you come back home? Sure, I’ll feed you warmly enough. But after that, you won’t see a ray of light, just like I didn’t.”</p>
<p>―…!</p>
<p>“You’ll rot by my side forever.”</p>
<p>Ding-dong, ding-dong, di-ding-dong—!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the doorbell rang wildly. Startled, Seoryeong whipped her head around.</p>
<p>Wait a second. Wasn’t the doorbell just in my imagination?</p>
<p>Bang bang bang, bang bang bang—!</p>
<p>The sound of angry, heavy banging followed. Bang bang bang, bang bang bang—! At this hour, well past midnight, who the hell would be banging on someone’s door like this?</p>
<p>“Is there anyone else you’re expecting?”</p>
<p>She furrowed her brow and asked the agents, but their equally confused expressions suggested they had no idea either.</p>
<p>In the midst of this critical conversation with Kim Hyun, who on earth could be interrupting?! Suppressing her rising irritation, Seoryeong finally stood up.</p>
<p>As she approached the intercom, her mind went blank the moment she saw the face on the screen. The intense thoughts swirling in her head dissipated, and even her husband’s voice became a distant echo.</p>
<p>“…Instructor?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin was angrily kicking her front door.</p>
<p>What in the world? And how did he even find my door? Dazed, she stared at him, but suddenly, the door lock cover lifted.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, calm but determined, began pressing the numbers on the keypad without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Is he insane?”</p>
<p>He was looking directly at the intercom, punching in the numbers one by one. His pupils, rolled upward like someone possessed, made him look anything but normal.</p>
<p>Regaining her senses, Seoryeong hurriedly opened the door. She couldn’t just stand by while he messed with her home’s security code.</p>
<p>“Instructor! What the hell are you doing!”</p>
<p>She was about to demand answers, her breath heavy with frustration, when suddenly, her head was yanked back by her hair. A sharp groan escaped her lips, and his expression hardened instantly. He tightened his grip, preventing her from moving.</p>
<p>His eyes swept over her face—bruised lips, swollen eyes, the beginnings of a dark bruise on her cheekbone. His fierce gaze took in every mark of abuse.</p>
<p>“Don’t go around telling people I taught you anything.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“And in situations like this, you don’t even think to call your instructor?”</p>
<p>His teeth ground together audibly.</p>
<p>“Move.”</p>
<p>Without asking for an explanation, he barged into her apartment.</p>
<p>“Wait! Instructor!”</p>
<p>She reached out in alarm, trailing after him. As he surveyed the wrecked living room and broken furniture, his earlier rage seemed to evaporate. His demeanor shifted into a cold, eerie calm. Overwhelmed by the strange atmosphere, Seoryeong hesitated to speak.</p>
<p>He glanced at the unconscious agent on the floor and the others nursing injuries, his brow arching. It was hard to tell if he was impressed or disappointed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Seoryeong remembered the phone and quickly pressed it back to her ear. In an instant, Wooshin snatched it from her, switching it to speakerphone before she could react.</p>
<p>― I feel bad for leaving like that. But still, Seoryeong, how could what we had be fake? I truly meant it when I married you. I can still picture your skin so clearly.</p>
<p>At those words, Lee Wooshin burst into laughter and started pecking her on the nape of her neck. Seoryeong was stunned by the sound. Her white skin quickly turned red.</p>
<p>Embarrassed by the situation, Seoryeong tried pushing him out of the apartment. She figured getting him to leave was the only way to restore some semblance of order.</p>
<p>But he didn’t budge. Instead, he casually walked to the fridge and grabbed a bottle of water.</p>
<p>She stared in disbelief as he moved around her place like it was his own. With her phone stolen and Lee Wooshin acting unpredictably, it became impossible to focus on the conversation.</p>
<p>Then, he opened a kitchen cabinet, found a bottle of cooking oil, and poured it into the throat of an agent, forcing the man’s head back as oil gushed into his mouth, nose, and eyes.</p>
<p>“Gaggh, ugh!”</p>
<p>The agent convulsed, retching as the oil flooded his airways. Wooshin merely looked down at him, his gaze emotionless.</p>
<p>―We just had some misunderstandings. I love you, Seoryeong. So just do what I say. You know you can’t get this kind of love from anyone else but me. You know that, right?</p>
<p>“Know what, you bastard?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Lee Wooshin hurled the oil container against the wall with a loud crash.</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth before I come find you myself.”</p>
