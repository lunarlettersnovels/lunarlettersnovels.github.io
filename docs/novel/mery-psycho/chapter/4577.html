        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 162.2</strong></p>
<p>Han Seoryeong dragged over the coiled chain in the corner and bound his wrists, one end secured to a protruding nail, the other fastened opposite.</p>
<p>With his arms restrained like this, escape was impossible.</p>
<p>She yanked the chains, testing the knots with metallic clinks. According to the landlady, these had held against enraged beasts. There was no way he could break free.</p>
<p>Just in case, she picked up the hunting rifle, ready to slam the stock into his skull if he stirred.</p>
<p>Seoryeong didn’t relax until the end. Even as his hardened length strained obscenely against his pants, his breathing evened out into sleep.</p>
<p>How many minutes had passed like that?</p>
<p>Enough. Enough… Seoryeong let out a slow breath of relief as she stared at his motionless body.</p>
<p>There couldn’t be anything more tragic than a bride vanishing on her wedding day. The moment had come, still clad only in her slip, she finally turned her back on him.</p>
<p>“…Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>A low voice suddenly snagged her ankle. Reflexively loading her gun, she spun around, but Wooshin still lay with his eyes closed, only his lips moving.</p>
<p>It was hard to tell if he was sleep-talking or not. She’d bound him perfectly, there was no reason to panic, yet her spine turned to ice.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>His pitch-black eyes were open, fixed on her. But his body remained sluggish, his eyelids drooping heavily before fluttering open again.</p>
<p>Wooshin tilted his head slowly, rattling the restraints around his wrists. The metallic clinking echoed unnervingly in the silence.</p>
<p>After testing them a few times, he gave up, shoulders going still. Then he let out a low, chilling laugh.</p>
<p>“So this was your plan.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong froze. No more masks, no more pretenses. She stripped herself bare, like wiping off bridal makeup.</p>
<p>“…You knew?”</p>
<p>“Knew what?”</p>
<p>He blinked lazily before smirking.</p>
<p>“That I’ve been watching you?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Untie me, Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>His hoarse voice scraped against her ears. His gaze, steady and unreadable, pinned her in place.</p>
<p>“How would I know what goes on in that head of yours? I just guessed.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Still, I’m glad you agreed to marry me.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I was happy enough to die, Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>He licked his parched lips.</p>
<p>“Why did you change your mind?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You were the one who told me not to use a condom.”</p>
<p>“Shut your fucking mouth.”</p>
<p>Rage surged at his calm expression. Her voice shook without her meaning it to.</p>
<p>“Enough of this bullshit act, Kim Hyun.”</p>
<p>She saw his eyes harden.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“NIS black operative, codename Masukaмаска, that was you, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of large wings filled the air. Birds of prey; vultures began gathering on the beams of the exposed ceiling.</p>
<p>Wooshin looked as if he had been stabbed in the gut, his face briefly defenseless. Then, slowly, he wiped away all traces of weakness.</p>
<p>Shockingly, this wasn’t the instructor or Kim Hyun. His expression was bleached blank, empty, and exhausted.</p>
<p>A face she had never seen before. And yet, this was likely the real Lee Wooshin, NIS agent: something inorganic, devoid of heat or cold.</p>
<p>No fury, no panic. Just eerie indifference, flickers of displeasure, and beneath his frozen skin, something like restless tension.</p>
<p>“How did you figure it out?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong felt the last taut thread of her nerves snap. A high-pitched ring filled her ears, her breath catching. No, maybe the fuse had burned out long ago.</p>
<p>She dragged over a rusted bucket from the corner. Then, with bare hands, she scooped out the stinky, coagulated blood of animal inside, rotted into a solid mass, and hurled it at his face, his head, over and over like stones.</p>
<p>“‘How did I figure it out?’ HOW?!”</p>
<p>She flung the stinking, putrid flesh again and again. Splat. Splat. His cheeks turned under the blunt impacts.</p>
<p>Each time, the birds perched on the beams flapped their wings at the scent of blood. They couldn’t wait to dig their beaks to Wooshin’s bloodied flesh.</p>
<p>But Wooshin, even as thick blood dripped into his mouth, kept obsessively chewing on the past.</p>
<p>“Ah! Was it that day? When you stole my phone and called He Channa.”</p>
<p>Seoyeong only looked at him silently.</p>
<p>“As soon as you left the interrogation room, you got into an altercation with the police. I traced your movements. When I checked the stolen phone, He Channa’s number was right there. Even then, it pissed me off. Why didn’t you call me first?”</p>
<p>Wooshin continued to mutter, “What did I miss… Where exactly did I fail? Fuck!”</p>
<p>A hollow laugh escaped him, dropping like a lump of congealed blood.</p>
<p>Seoryeong felt her chest grow cold.</p>
<p>Even as the dr*gs eroded his consciousness, Agent Lee Wooshin refused to let go of the mission. This was his true nature.</p>
<p>“You bastard! Is that really what you should be saying right now?!”</p>
<p>Her scream made the birds snap their beaks open in unison.</p>
<p>“You were Kim Hyun! From the very beginning, you were Kim Hyun!”</p>
<p>She wanted to spit in his face. To smash his heart beyond repair. To carve a wound in him that would never heal.</p>
<p>Seoryeong kicked the bucket violently, sending its remaining contents cascading over his torso.</p>
<p>“Now you get to suffer like I did. Lose your eyes so you can’t recognize what’s right in front of you!”</p>
<p>The agitated birds of prey darkened her vision as they swooped down in a black swarm.</p>
