            <p><b>Chapter 181.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seoryeong narrowed her eyes as if comparing the large, moving meat before her to something from her memory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been curved and pretty, like a banana, no… Seoryeong hardened her face fiercely, as if whipping herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps sensing her cold expression, Kia’s hand movements gradually slowed. She was sorry, but it couldn’t be helped. No matter how much Kia gripped and stroked his until it felt raw, there’s not a flicker of heat she felt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After moving from Azerbaijan to Russia, Seoryeong had lived for a while as if in a daze. Eating meals, sleeping; she couldn’t do anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wanted to block out all the sounds from outside if possible, so she just curled up like a silkworm in its cocoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They hid in a secluded retreat. She had heard that this place, one of Kia’s workspaces, was a sanctuary like a Sakhalin monastery, receiving various forms of protection from the Russian government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A cabin nestled deep within a dark forest. If one were to pry open the wooden floor beneath, it would be filled to the brim with firearms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to Kia, they had shaken off all the Interpol agents chasing them, but one day, the sound of his breathing irritated her so much that she flew into a rage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Shut up, Kia! It’s true I was happy and missed you, but please, just for a moment. Just leave me alone for a while!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A desire to not allow anything in had grown inside her like a monster. She didn’t want anyone carelessly breaking into her cocoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Han Seoryeong spent two months in that disheveled state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To somehow lift her up, she who had lost all will to live, Kia rolled his rosary beads and recited the Bible to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seoryeong tore the pages to shreds with an expressionless face, even bit them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she heard news of someone’s death, a death without a subject, and immediately swung at Kia’s jaw.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">They  fought, rolling on the floor like old times.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t easy to overpower Kia, who had returned to Sakhalin instead of escaping, but the wider her eyes flared, the more satisfied he seemed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, he even started getting hard again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hng… Sonya!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Starting one day, he began to undress, layer by layer, with the gloomy face of a bride sold into marriage, and masturb*ted in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is he insane?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even apart from the tender feelings that came with their long-awaited reunion, she couldn’t get used to Kia’s promiscuous behavior. Just how had she been living to treat her own body so carelessly?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kia, there are a lot of men like you in the world, so quit bragging. That thing… you use it so much it’s turned completely black.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh, that’s a terrible stereotype!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s because there are naturally more melanocytes in the genital area!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that moment, the image of Lee Wooshin’s pale complexion invaded her mind. The obscene sight of it, hairless and tinged with a subtle pink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The nape of her neck flushed as if suddenly splashed with hot water. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘D*mn it…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sharply turned her head away. Even while avoiding his gaze, her scolding didn’t stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Last time, you did it with a woman you just met in the bathroom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She looked like you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If anything even remotely reminded me of you, I didn’t hold back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was left speechless. In truth, she understood that feeling all too well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she was searching for Kim Hyun, she had also considered sleeping with numerous men based solely on the shape of their genitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seoryeong let out a quiet, hollow laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how she looked at it, they were fundamentally alike, like two sides of the same coin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, Sonya. Your husband… he was an NIS agent too, wasn’t he?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kia, who had never openly brought up the subject of her ‘husband’ before, suddenly blurted it out. Immediately, every memory of Lee Wooshin surfaced like an ambush. Seoryeong’s face paled and stiffened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had abandoned her wounded husband in Azerbaijan; she didn’t even know if he was dead or alive now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had severed their ties so cruelly and had deliberately closed her ears to any news of him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, with just that single word “husband,” her heart plummeted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then he probably received a similar s*x education to mine. That bastard’s probably even more worn out than I am.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He said, clicking his tongue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Think about it logically. A guy who would even marry a woman he didn’t love for a mission, you think he’d draw the line at s*x? He definitely had a string of women before you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unconsciously, she clenched her jaw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So don’t be so hard on me, Sonya. I’m not promiscuous, I’m just experienced. I’m in the exact same position as Lee Wooshin. Half for the job. Half for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He moved his hand more roughly. A slick, wet sound grew louder, as if he were nearing his climax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His muscular thighs parted with a stretch, and Kia frowned, swallowing a moan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you think I was the only dirty sl*t?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His pen*s was beginning to glisten. Spreading the sticky moisture beading at the tip, he stroked himself rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That bastard, even sleeping with you after marriage was just him selling his body to… Ack!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to bear it any longer, Seoryeong kicked him hard in the groin. Her face cold and expressionless, she began to stomp on his obscenely erect pen*s with the heel of her foot. </span></p>
