            <p><strong>Chapter 175.1</strong></p>
<p>“What are you doing, Yuri Solzhenitsyn? It’s not time yet. You must not provoke grandfather yet.”</p>
<p>Even though that warning echoed in his ears, Yuri stared straight at the opponent.</p>
<p>There was no fear or hesitation in that gaze. The hatred that had been hidden for a long time was clearly reflected in his bright eyes. Maxim raised his eyebrows at that unwavering look.</p>
<p>“If you don’t do it, I have no choice. I will cut open that beast’s belly.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>For some reason, those chilling words made his shoulders stiffen.</p>
<p>“Yuri, do you think I’m tormenting you?”</p>
<p>Maxim said as he roughly massaged his grandson’s nape.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to teach you.”</p>
<p>He took Yuri’s hand and began to cut open the beast’s belly himself. Yuri struggled in defiance, but the old man’s strength was unexpectedly strong, and he could vividly feel the sensation of the belly skin splitting apart.</p>
<p>Maxim mercilessly jabbed at the muscles, tearing the stitches apart. A low voice echoed from behind.</p>
<p>“Did I seem indifferent after losing Ivan?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The expression vanished from Yuri’s face. Since his parents had passed away, he had never spoken his father’s name. Yet, he mentioned Ivan after six years.</p>
<p>“Yuri, never show hatred in your words or expressions. It’s dangerous and foolish. At times, it can even seem ridiculous and childish.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Do you think I didn’t want to get angry? Do you think I didn’t?”</p>
<p>The hands that pierced the flesh were cruel.</p>
<p>“Never show your emotions. Only cold-blooded creatures harbor deadly poison in this world.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The moment the last stitch came undone, something spilled out along with the entrails. Yuri bit his teeth and tried to hold back his nausea, but his eyes grew hot with helplessness.</p>
<p>It was a corpse. What was revealed as the belly skin split open was the lifeless body of an unknown child. Yuri’s eyes trembled.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Unconsciously, Yuri checked the child’s feet first. Small, calloused, with black soles.</p>
<p>Despite his trembling hands, he squeezed the foot. It was cold and rough. The boy exhaled a suppressed breath, his entire face contorted in agony.</p>
<p>It was different. It was not like the foot of his pet mouse.</p>
<p>However, behind the shallow relief surged a horrific self-loathing. Yuri glared at Maxim with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>“Grandfather! What on earth are you actually doing in the Winter Castle?”</p>
<p>“Now and always, I work only for Russia.”</p>
<p>“Is this it? Is this what you call a hideous act?”</p>
<p>Yuri grabbed a handful of the thickly piled snow and threw it at his grandfather’s face.</p>
<p>“You let my parents die- on my birthday!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The snowflakes thrown in anger hit Maxim’s shoulders and cheeks, scattering around. He merely wiped his wet face lightly, not changing his expression at all.</p>
<p>“Yuri, there are always powerful figures in the world with a strong sense of insecurity.”</p>
<p>“Don’t give me nonsensical excuses!”</p>
<p>Yuri glared with wide-open eyes, making a metallic sound.</p>
<p>“Since I took Darya as my wife, I have always been put to the test. I had to prove and demonstrate my loyalty to the motherland time and again. Everyone doubted whether the great Maxim Solzhenitsyn could be swayed by a mere dark-haired woman and become a traitor.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“So, I vowed to make Russia even stronger. For over forty years, I have dedicated this Winter Castle solely to my country.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand any of what you are saying.”</p>
<p>He didn’t want to hear it. No matter what he said, Maxim’s position could not soothe his wounded heart. However, his cold gaze pierced through his like a long spear.</p>
<p>“Yuri, don’t be mistaken. Do you think that giving you a choice is the generosity of the powerful? No. The master of the Kremlin has merely controlled me.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Never be deceived by the word ‘choice’ in the future. It may seem like a fair game is being played, that we have freedom, but in reality, it’s just a method of control that numbs our thoughts.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Humans feel comfortable when their choices are limited, and thus they do not realize they are being manipulated. The bird that enters the cage of its own accord sings much more beautifully, and that’s the reasoning behind it.”</p>
<p>“Then why, Grandfather, if you knew all of this! Why did you abandon my father?”</p>
<p>Yuri shouted, his face contorting further. Maxim grasped his grandson’s chin firmly.</p>
<p>“Because you are still young.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I had to pretend to be fooled. I needed time. Time to raise you properly.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it’s because of me!”</p>
<p>“This is a warning, Yuri.”</p>
<p>Maxim bent down to meet his eye level. He exhaled softly, speaking each word deliberately.</p>
<p>“Those in power never forgive those who plot rebellion.”</p>
<p>A chilling silence enveloped the room. Maxim’s deeply set eyes showed no signs of wavering.</p>
