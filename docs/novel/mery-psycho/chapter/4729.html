            <p><strong>Chapter 83.1</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong aimed for his neck again, lifting her leg. But her heel, which was about to strike, cut through the air without hitting its target.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin easily dodged by turning his head, but he clamped down on her ankle with his teeth, refusing to let go.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The sensation of his fangs piercing her skin was chilling. Even at that moment, her hand continued to move roughly, gripping his s*x. Her palm kept sweeping upward along the shaft where precum was flowing.</p>
<p>Though his breath was labored, a cold calculation remained in his gaze, showing he wasn’t entirely overtaken by instinct.</p>
<p>Letting him in so recklessly had been a mistake.</p>
<p>Had her standards become skewed after living, eating, and sleeping with male comrades without care?</p>
<p>Especially since Lee Wooshin had been the strict instructor who relentlessly addressed s*xual harassment issues within the camp. She had unconsciously let her guard down because of that.</p>
<p>“–.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the fact that she held his most vulnerable spot in her hand hit her like a revelation. He was entirely exposed, offering up his most vital weak point, completely defenseless.</p>
<p>Seong Wookchan had been stabbed with a knife and stomped on his groin before, but she didn’t want to go that far with Lee Wooshin. Even now, his upper body would likely be covered in the scratches she’d left if his shirt were removed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t entirely of her own will, but it wasn’t complete coercion either. She had simply let him do whatever he wanted, swept up in confusion and tension.</p>
<p>The real problem was the sudden rise of heat within her, and how the sight of the curved organ she had been so eager to see now only filled her with bewilderment.</p>
<p>Seoryeong gripped his penis and yanked it forcefully to the other side as if shifting gears.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>For the first time, his face twisted in pain. She raked her nails across his shaft, causing injuries. His fierce movements stopped abruptly. Blood welled up from the scraped skin.</p>
<p>“Listen carefully, Instructor.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong spoke, still holding his penis hostage. She didn’t merely grasp it, she adjusted her grip as if preparing to break it.</p>
<p>Though there are no bones in the penis, you can fracture it in a similar way. Applying force would rupture the internal tissue.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s eyebrows twitched as he realized what she intended to do.</p>
<p>“Do I look like a rich widow to you?”</p>
<p>A strange silence filled the space between them. After a beat, Lee Wooshin propped himself up on his elbows on the mattress and let out a humorless laugh.</p>
<p>There was no sense of him being out of place in her bedroom.</p>
<p>“No, you don’t look wealthy.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Deprived of release, the man surprisingly replied without resistance. But Seoryeong couldn’t help glancing at the grotesque erection still standing proudly between his legs. Each time she did, she bit her tongue and forced herself to stay focused.</p>
<p>Women… even pygmy chimpanzees get aroused by sex scenes. It doesn’t matter who the subject is; it’s the intensity of the visual stimuli that increases the excitement.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a lie—she had really read that study. She had really seen it. So this sight… it was just like a chimpanzee.</p>
<p>*<em>It was not that I’m shaken—I’m just looking at a chimpanzee in my bedroom…</em>*</p>
<p>“…Then, why are you doing this, Instructor?”</p>
<p>It was true that she had acted impulsively, putting her hands on his waistband. But Lee Wooshin had responded willingly. The same man who had once sternly rebuked her for even mentioning the word “genitals” was now offering himself up for comparison.</p>
<p>“If you’re not after my money, then tell me clearly what you want from me. Don’t beat around the bush. Be specific.”</p>
<p>At first, she had thought it was just her superior taking out his frustrations on her. Then, she had understood it as trauma from similar past experiences. But now, she could no longer rationalize it with her head.</p>
<p>“Do you want to mess with me? Or do you just want to sleep with me? Or is it something else?”</p>
<p>Her once rigid thinking had begun to change little by little with each incident.</p>
<p><em>Could it be that he?</em></p>
<p>Her lips, which had been moving to speak, suddenly clamped shut. The thought of saying that final possibility out loud made her skin itch, as if she couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p>“Have you finished comparing me to your husband?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin asked casually as he tucked his still-hard member back into his underwear.</p>
<p>Whether it was due to his impressive self-control or because he was still far from finishing, he showed no signs of agitation, even as he stopped all his movements so abruptly.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just indifference—it was a glimpse of well-trained restraint.</p>
<p>“Is this the cock you’ve been looking for?”</p>
<p>“Wait a second, I didn’t intend to do this so hastily! I wanted to take my time.”</p>
<p>“You said you’d know right away once you touched it. So I let you touch it enough, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I ended up giving you a good time, but I’m the one with my skin peeled off.”</p>
<p>“That’s because you, Instructor—!”</p>
<p>“Let me make it clear so you don’t get confused.” He stood up from the bed and flipped on the once-dark bedroom light. “I just want you, Agent Han Seoryeong, to want only what you can see right in front of you.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong squeezed her eyes shut for a moment, startled by the sudden brightness, and then opened them again.</p>
<p>“Only what you can see.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Be greedy, desire it, and reach for it.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin stood there for a long time, almost possessively staring into her dazed eyes.</p>
