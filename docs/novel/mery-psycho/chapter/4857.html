            <p><strong>Chapter 15.2</strong></p>
<p>Before leaving the office completely, Seoryeong grabbed the towel hanging loosely on a chair. Fortunately, it was a new towel that didn’t emit a musty smell.</p>
<p>She draped it over her head and stood in front of the elevator. Upon reaching downstairs, she quickly wiped her hair and changed her clothes. Then, she planned to catch up on the rest of her laundry tasks.</p>
<p>She calmly reviewed the tasks she needed to accomplish in her mind.</p>
<p>Ding―.</p>
<p>The elevator opened.</p>
<p>Due to the towel hanging down covering her forehead, only people’s feet were visible.</p>
<p>Filling the elevator were black military boots and immaculate men’s shoes.</p>
<p><em>Looks like I’m in trouble. </em>She didn’t have the slightest intention of harming or angering so many people in this state.</p>
<p>It was when she was about to step back.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you getting in?”</p>
<p>A low, slow voice penetrated her ears. Seoryeong hesitated, but instead of responding, she took another step back.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you don’t want to ride?”</p>
<p>Even when heard again, it was a firm voice, making the hairs on her neck stand on end.</p>
<p>As the door was about to close, he casually pressed the open button. Through the towel-covered vision, she saw calloused hands and an expensive-looking watch.</p>
<p>Then, she couldn’t shake the vague feeling that the man was scrutinizing her closely. Under his persistent gaze, her jaw, neck, and arms all tensed one after the other.</p>
<p>Seoryeong lifted her head as if shaking off the staring eyes from all directions. Then, as if he was waiting for it, the man’s hand lightly fell from the button with a sense of resignation.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p><em>“Why doesn’t he close it already? Please leave…”</em></p>
<p>His hand hovered over the close button, not bothering to press it. For no reason, Seoryeong just stared at the elevator floor, waiting for it to close.</p>
<p>It was also then that the motionless man suddenly pressed his shoe heel against the ground as if digging it in. A faint, mournful sound of the wind seemed to be heard over her head.</p>
<p>Finally, as the elevator doors were about to close, Seoryeong lifted the towel slightly to obstruct her view.</p>
<p>Inside were soldiers in black uniforms conversing with a man in a suit. Although only their side profiles were visible, their graceful lines made them appear impressive.</p>
<p><em>That person looks oddly fascinating…</em></p>
<p>Seoryeong thought nonchalantly as she turned away.</p>
<p>She quickly took the emergency stairs. Her steps became heavy with resignation.</p>
<p>But then, as if prompted by an unsettling feeling at the back of her head, she quickly turned around. Her gaze met briefly with the man who was quietly talking with the person next to him.</p>
<p>No, was it a mistake? Did they really make eye contact?</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>However, before she could be sure, the elevator doors firmly closed. Seoryeong felt a bit flustered, standing still with her hand on the door handle of the emergency stairwell.</p>
<p>Even though they only passed by, their eyes seemed to pierce through her as if they could see right through. Because of the gaze, which was different from the leisurely voice, her neck felt chilly for a brief moment.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“That guy? The newcomer.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Oh, I heard he was in Africa for a long time. Nowadays, it’s restless there because of the US, China, and Russia, right? He mainly trained African regular troops and police there.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t they say he’s only 31? But what kind of experience… South African PMC, then government troops, insurgents, she seems to have been everywhere except Antarctica?”</p>
<p>“He enlisted right after becoming an adult. And then kept rolling in special forces…―”</p>
<p>Seoryeong listened to the buzzing conversation of her coworkers and finally realized that the man had been the team leader of the Special Security Team.</p>
<p>His arrival was a topic that has been circulating among the employees for the past few weeks.</p>
<p><em>Ah…. It was a strange moment when everything suddenly made sense.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Clean it again.”</p>
<p>And of course, there were things that just couldn’t be accepted.</p>
<p>Sizzle― hot steam rose from the iron, but suddenly, murky water dripped, plop, onto her dry hands.</p>
<p>It had already been a week. How many times had she done this already? Today, that man she pissed off during the fight brought in training clothes soaked in food waste once again.</p>
<p>The childish taunting began when the food waste guy finally singled out Seoryeong.</p>
<p>Part of the reason was that among the female employees, she was one of the youngest, and with her slender figure and impeccable posture, Seoryeong stood out.</p>
<p>As soon as he found Seoryeong, he shot her a stern look. Initially, he would just grumble, but at some point, he began bothering her about everything.</p>
<p>Whether the laundry was finished, if the name tag was a mess, or if there was a problem with the uniform causing disruptions to the training schedule, the complaints from the soldiers poured in instantly.</p>
<p>Despite his petty retaliation, Seoryeong stood firm, sensing the deputy director’s silent wish for her to just quit altogether.</p>
<p>“But I have to endure as long as possible.”</p>
<p>Until the time was ripe to stage a kidnapping hostage situation.</p>
<p>So even when the brat sent her off for menial tasks to various places for dog training, Seoryeong complied without much complaint.</p>
<p>Today, too, Seoryeong accepted the stinking training clothes without changing her expression. But this time, it was the man’s face that crumpled.</p>
<p>“You’re quite stubborn too, you know?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have the training clothes laundered again and bring them back by 4 p.m.”</p>
<p>“Is that all you have to say to me?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Do you even know my name?”</p>
<p>“It’s on the training clothes. I can read Hangul, too.” She answered sarcastically.=</p>
