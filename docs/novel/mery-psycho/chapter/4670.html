            <p><strong>Chapter 113.2</strong></p>
<p>The man jolted awake, throwing off his blanket and sitting up abruptly. Beads of sweat rolled down Lee Wooshin’s chin, his body drenched enough to soak the sheets.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since a nightmare had left him in such a state. In the stillness of the monastery, devoid even of the chirping of insects, he dragged a hand down his face.</p>
<p>Kia and Sonya…</p>
<p>The unfamiliar names stabbed at his chest. Even pronouncing them felt heavy, frightening.</p>
<p>Sonya… Kia… Kiara…</p>
<p>“――.”</p>
<p>Perhaps returning to this land after so long had frayed his nerves. The entire day had been plagued by unease that clung to him like a shadow.</p>
<p>The connections between the Winter Fortress, the Russian Orthodox Church, and the black-haired children were steadily becoming clearer. Adding to that was Rigay’s act of terrorism, which had blown all the evidence into sharp relief—it was undoubtedly significant.</p>
<p>Rising from the bed, Lee Wooshin felt as if he was standing at the threshold of something monumental.</p>
<p>The lingering questions he had about the Solzhenitsyn family estate. The incidents at the Winter Fortress, where government officials, religious factions, and scientists had been entangled.</p>
<p>If there was one thing tying them all together, it was the sheer power to reshape the world.</p>
<p>Bearing the onset of a throbbing headache, he staggered as he walked. A gnawing unease coiled deep in his gut, propelling him faster with each step.</p>
<p>For reasons he couldn’t explain, he desperately wanted to see Seoryeong.</p>
<p>The feeling was unbearable, like something was about to happen. Had it started when he saw that mask? His pounding heart refused to calm down, as if fueled by a relentless rush of caffeine.</p>
<p>As if letting his guard down for even a moment would trigger disaster—</p>
<p>“What… what nonsense is this?!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a heated voice rang out, fragmented but loud.</p>
<p>At this hour? What’s causing such a commotion? More importantly, the voice sounded familiar.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s expression hardened. Without hesitation, he raced toward the source of the noise—her room.</p>
<p>“…I told you to stop spouting nonsense, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>Another cracked voice erupted, splitting the tense air. “Sonya, Sonya,” the urgent, low voice repeated, like the fragments of a heated argument.</p>
<p>Thud. Thud. Something heavy hit the floor with dull thumps. A muffled sob followed—a sound of someone trying to swallow their tears. The chaos beyond the door reverberated through the worn wooden floor.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin grasped the doorknob with the intent to tear it off and twisted it violently.</p>
<p>“Let go of me! Let go!”</p>
<p>What he saw next froze the blood in his veins.</p>
<p>“Don’t! Don’t touch me… Hic, get away, get away!”</p>
<p>“Sonya, calm down, Sonya!”</p>
<p>“If all you’re going to do is spew nonsense, then just get out!”</p>
<p>“Don’t cry. I’m sorry. Please don’t cry.”</p>
<p>Her room was a wreck. Her belongings lay scattered across the floor in utter disarray. In the middle of it all, the two of them were entangled, locked in what looked like a violent struggle.</p>
<p>Between her forcefully parted lips, something bright red pushed its way in. The wet sound of flesh being sucked was sickeningly vivid.</p>
<p>“――.”</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>His mind went blank. The scene flickered in and out of focus, like a hammer had struck his head, blackening his vision before it returned.</p>
<p>Kia consumed her lips as if trying to devour her entirely. His grip crushed her jaw, and her cheeks hollowed painfully with each agonizing pull.</p>
<p>Even as Seoryeong grimaced and tried to push him away, her sobs broke through in disjointed gasps.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin lunged at them without thinking. Fury ignited every vein in his body, flooding them with molten rage. In a single motion, he grabbed Kia by the neck and wrenched him away from her.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong—!”</p>
<p>His shout shattered the air like a lightning strike, plunging the room into a suffocating silence.</p>
<p>But the sight of her swollen, bloodied lips—violated by another man—sent a murderous wave surging through him.</p>
<p>Damn it! His face hardened as he reached out to steady Seoryeong, but—Smack! His hand recoiled before it could touch her, stinging from the force of her rejection.</p>
<p>The situation made no sense. As his face twisted in utter confusion, his eyes locked with hers—red-rimmed and brimming with an eerie disdain. She glared at him as if he were some vile, loathsome creature.</p>
<p>“I just heard something truly insane.”</p>
<p>Her empty gaze darkened with an unsettling clarity. Slowly, she muttered, almost as if biting down on her words.</p>
<p>“You’re… really—”</p>
<p>A trembling laugh, jagged like a broken arc, escaped her lips.</p>
<p>“Are you Kim Hyun?”</p>
