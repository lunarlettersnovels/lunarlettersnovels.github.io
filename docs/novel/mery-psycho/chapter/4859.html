            <p><strong>Chapter 14</strong></p>
<p>“F*ck, I’m so tired.”</p>
<p>“Just who is the new captain that the training program is like this?”</p>
<p>“You smell when you open your mouth, so shut up and wash up.”</p>
<p>The loud chatter got closer. They were swearing and whiny at the end of every sentence.</p>
<p>The empty locker room was soon filled with big-sized men.</p>
<p>They were the last members of the morning schedule. The Blast agents swarmed in after their training had their muscles pumped.</p>
<p>The training uniforms that they took off were all put in the laundry basket.</p>
<p>After every agent went into the shower, the signal for an empty locker room was turned on. Seoryeong opened the door after staring at the green light button.</p>
<p>The laundry basket was full after all the morning training was completed. Even though she wore a thin, white mask, she could still smell the sweat.</p>
<p>It’s been a month since she started working at Blast Agency.</p>
<p>Seoryeong walked around in a mundane uniform with an apron on. She was so busy trying to learn her duty.</p>
<p>She helped make three huge meals with the cook and did laundry for the agency. After she finished drying the clothes, she checked who they belonged to and gave them to them.</p>
<p>There weren’t that many old people in this department—only around ten people working hard to keep this place clean.</p>
<p>How was she supposed to kidnap a senior manager and find her husband at this rate… She sighed a little.</p>
<p>Seoryeong massaged her shoulder as she went to the kitchen. When she walked in, a lady in a sanitary hat and mask talked to her.</p>
<p>“Seoryeong, you haven’t eaten yet, right?”</p>
<p>“I was about to eat.”</p>
<p>“Then wait for a moment. Let’s bring that in and eat together.”</p>
<p>She looked at the compost bin. Seoryeong was about to sit in it, but she changed her mind and said she’d take care of it.</p>
<p>It was when she was cleaning up leftover food,</p>
<p>“I hear there is a vacancy in the special security team.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong glanced at where the sound came from.</p>
<p>The special security team. More members have been talking about them lately.</p>
<p>When Seoryeong coincidentally met Channa after coming into Blast Agency, there was a time when she was about to tell Channa that she came into Blast Agency because of Jeong Pilgyu’s threat.</p>
<p>Instead, she asked Channa where she was working and Channa just stopped frozen.</p>
<p>“Well… All I can say is that the new leader is an asshole…” She was trying to avoid the conversation and disappear. She hasn’t met Channa since.</p>
<p>“Just what do they do that they get a bonus of $100k?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure they have their reason.”</p>
<p>“No, but still. They even take more than those who are dispatched to Africa. Even those who went to Ukraine and Myanmar didn’t take that much. Just where they go…! They fucking look like pansies and who knows if they’re just going there to suck dicks or what. Just taking everything for themselves…!”</p>
<p>This was the talk that Seoryeong has been hearing a lot lately. But the duty of the special security team was never shared, that they were scouted with the best members.</p>
<p>She seemed to get interested because of this.</p>
<p>“Then why don’t you go in yourself?”</p>
<p>“Are you teasing me?”</p>
<p>“No, who knows if you’re on that scouting list as well. Don’t be so annoyed and eat already.”</p>
<p>The man seemed triggered by the comment as he threw his spoon.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The man glared at his comrade.</p>
<p>Seoryeong stopped putting all the leftover food in the compost bin and stared at them.</p>
<p>The conversation, which started as nonchalant, started to get rougher, and in the end, they started to talk with their fist.</p>
<p>“I was getting sick and tired of you talking down on the special security team. You make me feel like I’m nothing compared to them, and that annoys me…!”</p>
<p>“Fuck, how dare you think I’m feeling insecure?”</p>
<p>As two large men started to wrestle, the huge table started to shake. Everyone else moved away, and Seoryeong just blinked.</p>
<p><em>They’re going at it again.</em> The ladies from the kitchen looked out as if this was the norm.</p>
<p>That moment, a row of piled treys came their way.</p>
<p>“Fuck, you’re the one who’s always on about the special security team!”</p>
<p>“You bastard, you’re having the time of your life because I took you under my wing, and this is how you repay me? I’m the one who took care of a poor, homeless bastard who didn’t have anything to do after leaving the army…! You would’ve become a delivery boy if it weren’t for me!”</p>
<p>“It’s not just once or twice, so I’m getting sick!”</p>
<p>“What, you think you’re clean of all this?”</p>
<p>“For someone with such a small dick, you talk a lot!”</p>
<p>“You fucking bastard!”</p>
<p>“Just say you’re jealous!”</p>
<p>Then the brawl began.</p>
