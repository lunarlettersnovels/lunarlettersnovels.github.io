            <p><strong>Chapter 183.2</strong></p>
<p>A loud crashing sound came through the receiver.</p>
<p>– “No! I’m sorry! I was wrong!” Wonchang shouted.</p>
<p>“Then from now on, before you say anything to me, get it cleared by He Channa first.”</p>
<p>– “…What?!”</p>
<p>“You should do that.”</p>
<p>– Wait, wait a minute, Team Leader! There’s still rank and hierarchy to consider…!</p>
<p>“Only bring me what He Channa agrees to.”</p>
<p>– Team Leadeeer!</p>
<p>“Go have all the meaningless sex you want.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin irritably hung up the phone. His mood was already ruined because of Na Wonchang.</p>
<p>Feeling miserable and horrific due to an overwhelming sense of loss, he wondered what he would do if he ended up wanting to see Seoryeong even more.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, inhaling as if to calm himself.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a hole in his heart where she used to be; it felt like something had sunk below the endless surface, completely submerged.</p>
<p>The rushing water, aside from his struggling body, was entirely her. The pressure of the water, pressing down on his internal organs with immense force, was Han Seo-ryeong.</p>
<p>The brutal longing was more merciless than a knife piercing his heart. However, the life without his wife was just beginning.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Na Wonchang banged his forehead on the desk, frustrated by the situation that had ended without him even recovering his initial investment.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Covering for the lone black agent left in the unofficial first team of the Overseas Intelligence Bureau was a difficult task that required more than ordinary energy, and Na Wonchang was still working as part of the Cybersecurity Team.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had been visiting the hospital for nearly three months and had to handle He Channa’s personality all by himself.</p>
<p>His weight was dropping day by day, yet instead of receiving compliments, he was only met with terrifying threats.</p>
<p>“Sister-in-law Owl… Where on earth are you?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s temperament was becoming increasingly difficult to manage day by day, and the Owl’s friend, the prodigy north Korean spy was no better.</p>
<p>He only wished to return to the days when he had merely worshipped her from afar.</p>
<p>When Lee Wooshin was hospitalized, Na Wonchang visited every day, cursing at his superior’s face while throwing things like herbal tea, jujube tea, ginger tea, and quince tea at him.</p>
<p>“The owl need to come back for my lifespan to increase…”</p>
<p>Despite the pain in his sides, Wonchang kept his focus and began typing on the keyboard again.</p>
<p>He was secretly running a cam tracking program, comparing faces from around the world to find someone resembling the Owl. He felt like he was grasping at straws.</p>
<p>The position of the first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service was still vacant, and if the team were to be reorganized or disbanded, moving freely like this would be impossible. So he needed to find the Owl as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Another Bird Box. But only an empty box remained.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, wake up! It’s urgent!”</p>
<p>At that moment, a rough voice slapped Wonchang’s back. Ah… where have I heard this before? He turned around, hiding his narrowed eyes, feeling a strange sense of déjà vu.</p>
<p>“It’s an emergency meeting for the executives! Especially the Cybersecurity Team, everyone gather!”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>He asked, startled as he got up. His senior grabbed the nape of Wonchang’s neck and ran, panting heavily.</p>
<p>The two passed through a corridor with the NIS logo and climbed the stairs. The higher they went, the more he felt a sense of illusion that the air and noise were diminishing. It was an inexplicable, ominous premonition.</p>
<p>“It was just a few minutes ago. We received a threatening message. To be precise, it’s a terror warning. The IP is from Russia.”</p>
<p>“A threat?”</p>
<p>“They plan to detonate explosives in the Syrian rebel area.”</p>
<p>His heart raced as they ran without stopping.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>What was going on? His senior, noticing Wonchang’s furrowed brow, added an explanation.</p>
<p>It was simple. The United States was supporting the Syrian opposition military organization, the “Free Syrian Army,” while Russia was backing the corrupt government forces. In other words, a Korean was threatening terrorism on the side of Russia.</p>
<p>“Damn it, so the U.S. is in an uproar. They’re wondering why it’s suddenly in Korean. Plus, it’s a woman’s voice.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>No, it shouldn’t be…</p>
<p>“I don’t know what this is about either. Anyway, they’re demanding to know who that voice belongs to, and that’s something you, no, we need to find out!”</p>
<p>Ah, this is strange. No, it can’t be. Could it be? No way. Please.</p>
<p>Cold sweat began to bead on his forehead, which was filled with ominous thoughts.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered the conference room after passing through the security card and fingerprint recognition, an urgent briefing was already underway, and a familiar voice was coming from the large screen. Na Wonchang’s face turned pale.</p>
<p>– …In the first week of my return, I will strike down God’s will with lightning upon the Free Syrian Army military school…</p>
<p>That was the Owl’s, or rather, Han Seoryeong’s voice.</p>
<p>He glanced at the heavy and serious expressions of the NIS executives, his face turning ashen.</p>
<p>Things were heading in a very, very bad direction.</p>
