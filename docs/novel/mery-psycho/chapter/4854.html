            <p><strong>Chapter 17.2</strong></p>
<p>Wonchang asked, his tone tinged with a hint of stupidity or perhaps guilt that he didn’t know what was going on. Lee Wooshin wasn’t happy with his obliviousness.</p>
<p>“How are you getting paid with such shitty work?”</p>
<p>The man tried to hold back as much as he could. His surprised heart was still racing.</p>
<p>Right now, Lee Wooshin has infiltrated the Blast Agency for his last operation. He got in as a special security team leader as it was reported that the NIS’s internal information was being leaked to outside corporations.</p>
<p>That corporation was Blast Agency, the subsidiary of the Sehwa group. Blast Agency was a group of mercenaries that the government used well when they couldn’t do things themselves due to political sensitivity or budget, but if they report them making money illegally abroad, it becomes a different story.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the position of the special security team leader position was opened, and that Blast Agency was quietly looking for someone who fits well.</p>
<p>As they were a business that was providing service that was similar to battle, they wanted a foreigner who was good with battles, strategy, spying, training, etc.</p>
<p>The only person that fit the category within the NIS was Lee Wooshin. He didn’t even have to change his resume – just had to change his experience abroad a little. There was a reasoning behind the senior manager.</p>
<p>“Wonchang, have you gone deaf? Why is… the owl here?”</p>
<p>– W, wait…! Wait… Owl is there right now?</p>
<p>“Best employee ever.”</p>
<p>– No, wait…! O-owl? Our owl?</p>
<p>He sounded surprised.  Lee Wooshin clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>“Our owl?”</p>
<p>– Uh, uh…</p>
<p>“Ah, our Wonchang seemed to be fond of the entire memory, huh?”</p>
<p>He smiled forcefully. He couldn’t believe it. He was trying to recount how he faced the owl and just how he let her go.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin messaged his temple.</p>
<p>Did this ever happen before, where a mission that was basically done just showed up? He was wondering if what he saw was a mirage.</p>
<p>But he was pondering just for a moment, as he was disgusted at how things were turning out. There was the sound of the keyboard over the phone at the same time.</p>
<p>– W, why is the owl….</p>
<p>“If you find anything, just say it.”</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>– …. Han Seoryeong, 27 years old, hired by Blast Agency a month ago. She is part of the military department, where she works in the kitchen and laundry mostly…</p>
<p>Now he could feel blood shooting up to his head. Lee Wooshin pressed down on the desk like he was going to drill a hole.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Owl… So, owl is employed here.</em></p>
<p>– Did you… perhaps meet her?</p>
<p>He shut his mouth as he heard the question. Not just met her.</p>
<p>– She doesn’t recognize you right? You’re not wearing a Kim Hyun mask.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>There is only one truth. The fact that she didn’t recognize him. Lee Wooshin calmed down.</p>
<p>– Is the owl… doing ok?</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>– Well….</p>
<p>He scoffed at him. How could he work as an agent if he was so sympathetic?</p>
<p>It might be best that Na Wonchang, who was skilled but was awful at everything else, was working as a public servant.</p>
<p>– W-well, you told me now to report anything about owl…</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>– Owl was recently arrested for trying to escape to the north.</p>
<p>“… What?”</p>
<p>He frowned. Did he hear it wrong? It was so random that he couldn’t understand it.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin couldn’t move for a few seconds. W… what? What did she try to do?</p>
<p>“What did the… the owl do?”</p>
<p>–… Escape to the north.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>– So she was trying to make you, no, Kim Hyun, a spy.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>– That’s why she escaped to the north, so that Kim Hyun should be investigated too.</p>
<p>He was speechless for a moment. <em>Owl… did that. She did that.</em></p>
<p>The report on the owl was as simple as her personality. Just mundane sentences after mundane sentences. A lonely and kind woman.</p>
<p>The woman who came out to the society the moment she became an adult and she did the same thing every day but she had no complaints.</p>
<p>She was hard working and tried her best at her position. She was such an obedient and quiet person but to think she did something like that.</p>
<p>“She’s not someone to do something like that.”</p>
<p>Even just now. Her hard words, no hesitating in kicking, and even though she knew he might get burned, her decision to turn the water on. It wasn’t like the owl he knew.</p>
<p>Also the way she was staring at his erect penis. Lee Wooshin kicked his tongue in annoyance.</p>
<p><em>Why did he become erect at that point?</em></p>
<p>Her pupils were always around collarbones trying to find Kim Hyun.</p>
<p>Her strong eyes that met his were certainly unfamiliar to him.</p>
<p><em>It looks like she got her sight back</em>. He rubbed his head at something that was oddly bothering him.</p>
<p>– Yes… But after her husband disappeared…</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>– Looks like it was hard on her.</p>
