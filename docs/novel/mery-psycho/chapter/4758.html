            <p><strong>Chapter 68.1</strong></p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The usually composed and detached Lee Wooshin now had excitement lurking on his face.</p>
<p>Facing him head-on, Han Seoryeong felt a surge of heat even in the relentless snowfall of the past few days.</p>
<p>Do men usually make this kind of face? Do they look at women with such wild, raw eyes? She couldn’t imagine, having never seen her husband’s face even during sex.</p>
<p>Deep, dark eyes sinking into an abyss, piercing through people with an unfiltered gaze.</p>
<p>Even before and after going blind, she had never seen such heavy eyes, eyes that sometimes seemed to provoke.</p>
<p>Unlike the filthy look from Seong Wookchan, Lee Wooshin’s eyes held a bitter and regretful fire that flickered oddly. It made her almost want to close hers and avoid it like she always does.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>As Seoryeong kept twisting her face to resist, his rough strength once again subdued her head. He bit and chewed her lips as if holding something back.</p>
<p>It felt like he was satisfying some unquenchable desire through these nibbles. Eventually, her lips split, and the taste of blood filled hermouth.</p>
<p>“Ouch, it… hurts…”</p>
<p>The act of sharing body heat had now degenerated into gluttony. Lee Wooshin sucked the blood sweetly. He didn’t even bother to mix his tongue with it, just the mere touch of his lips together and apart, and an obscene sound followed.</p>
<p>“Haah…”</p>
<p>Her lips, which had been dry, were now moist to the point of feeling clammy.Seoryoeng lost all sense of time. She couldn’t tell if seconds or minutes had passed while their lips pressed and rubbed against each other.</p>
<p>Hot breath exchanged repeatedly. Their high cheekbones pressed into each other’s cheeks, making breathing difficult. However, her once cold lips thawed to the point of throbbing, and her previously sluggish heart beat rapidly again, if only momentarily.</p>
<p>The rough breath through his nose sounded vulgar. Even so, he still didn’t lose complete control, never invading her mouth as if it were forbidden.</p>
<p>Despite her occasional twitching tongue, she couldn’t help but think his self-control was impressive.</p>
<p>“Haah…”</p>
<p>Finally, he pulled his lips away and immediately touched her neck. Taking this chance, she shouted out like someone who had been swindled.</p>
<p>“Instructor! I didn’t mean… to kiss–”</p>
<p>“How is this a kiss?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t even use my tongue once, so how can this be considered a kiss?”</p>
<p>As she swallowed her breath and corrected their miscommunication, his response was just that. Frowning, she asked again.</p>
<p>“Then what was that?”</p>
<p>“It’s more effective than slapping your cheeks, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You told me not to pinch your cheeks.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin licked his saliva-glossed lips with his tongue and laughed. Her eyes were momentarily drawn to his swollen, red lips and the thick tongue that seemed even redder. It made her stomach churn oddly.</p>
<p>“Your complexion has improved, and your lips are no longer blue. What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“But… why did you move your lips like that?”</p>
<p>“Then what?”</p>
<p>I thought we were supposed to talk about something to keep us awake?”</p>
<p>“So, let’s badmouth that shitty wife of mine.”</p>
<p>“She can’t be that shitty…”</p>
<p>“This is funny. Do you even know who my wife is?”</p>
<p>“Then what do we talk about here, instructor? That’s the only common topic we have!”</p>
<p>“Fine, give it a try. This should be pretty entertaining.”</p>
<p>But before she could say anything, those hot lips closed on her again.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin firmly grasped her jaw and parted her lips.</p>
<p>She wanted to push him away, but her arms trapped inside the padded jacket were useless. She could move them down, but not up.</p>
<p>He devoured her hot breath once more, biting her lips and rubbing their skin together. Under his rough lead, her body swayed helplessly.</p>
<p>“Actually, I have plenty to say too.”</p>
<p>He spoke in a defiant tone, taking advantage of the brief moment when their lips parted.</p>
<p>“My wife wrote a list of men on a piece of paper.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. She had thrown out a random comment, but it turned out to be true?</p>
<p>“She seemed to spend all day having lewd thoughts if left alone.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“And she thought that just opening her eyes prettily would solve everything.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“She recklessly used her body whether in the mountains or at the beach.”</p>
<p>“Where did you meet such a strange woman?”</p>
