            <p><strong>Chapter 11.2</strong></p>
<p>“Normally, I shouldn’t say this, but isn’t it true that people get more determined when food is within reach?”</p>
<p>“What—”</p>
<p>“Since you’ve decided, systematically get determined! Even if you’re going to cause an accident, a person should have some basic skills. Learn some skills! Most experts have them.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“At our company.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s forehead wrinkled slightly. Her company? The company Channa worked for? Then the name of the company she heard at the errand center came to her mind, Blast… Was it called Blast?</p>
<p>“If you’re the ones trying to save hostages, you should also be good at capturing them systematically.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>After finishing her words, Channa rolled her eyes, avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p>The more she thought about it, the more reasonable the words seemed. Kidnapping hostages required not only an accomplice but also skills. Moreover, it was not an ordinary person; it was a former NIS hostage. To capture her, she needed the same stamina and ability. Approach naturally but with experienced force.</p>
<p>“So, don’t think of anything else for now; just choose freely!”</p>
<p>And they said the deputy director of the National Intelligence Service walked around with bodyguards/</p>
<p>Blast… The gleam in Seoryeong’s eyes indicated a revelation.</p>
<p>It was a scene straight out of a dream.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Ding—With a jingle, the cafe door opened again, and Seoryeong straightened her already upright posture.</p>
<p>A man who had been lurking around menacingly focused on her as soon as he saw her sitting by the window.</p>
<p>“Miss Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>With each step he took toward her, the wrinkles on his forehead deepened.</p>
<p>“What do you want to talk about regarding Channa?”</p>
<p>Before even taking his seat, Jeong Pilgyu immediately got to the point. His expression made it clear that he had no intention of wasting time.</p>
<p>However, the more indifferent he appeared, the more composed Seoryeong became. She calmly looked at him, letting him reluctantly grab a chair.</p>
<p>His insides were probably boiling with tension. She smiled subtly.</p>
<p>The previous night, she had blackmailed Jeong Pilgyu to set up this meeting.</p>
<p>“I heard you and Ms. Channa are related, brother and sister-in-law.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jeong Pilgyu’s expression hardened. It was evident that her knowledge of their family relationship made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“So, I contacted Jeong Pilgyu to make things difficult for you too.”</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>But her words were silenced by the touch of a button on Seoryeong’s phone.</p>
<p>“Don’t go under the bridge, you’ll get caught anyway, don’t bother, take a car instead,” said a voice that sounded unmistakably He Channa. Seoryong made a face.</p>
<p>“I was thinking of discussing with Channa my next attempt to defect.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The guy, who had been uneasy until now, blinked suddenly.</p>
<p>“I tried to defect the last time and got caught. Channa taught me the method.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Originally, they say you have to be caught a few more times to become a person of interest. I’m also human, so being chased by the National Intelligence Service is terrifying.”</p>
<p>“Is this happening now—”</p>
<p>“At first, things somehow went smoothly, but from now on, I can’t guarantee anything.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Hey, Han Seoryeong!” Channa was in disbelief.</p>
<p>“He Channa, a North Korean defector, helped me.”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Jeong Pil-gyu was livid.</p>
<p>“And it turns out that her brother-in-law is a former National Intelligence Service employee?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong laughed, and Jeong Pilgyu’s neck turned red and his eyes widened.</p>
<p>“What the h*ll are you doing?!”</p>
<p>“It seems that Mr. Jeong Pilgyu is unexpectedly a sweetheart.”</p>
<p>Suddenly she asked with a wry smile.</p>
<p>“Did you quit your job to take care of a North Korean defector sister-in-law and then get married?”</p>
<p>“There’s no reason for me to listen any longer.”</p>
<p>He rose abruptly, turning his body when he spoke.</p>
<p>“Do you not realize that if Channa is suspected, your wife might also get caught? Don’t turn your back on me; sit down. My business with you isn’t finished yet.”</p>
<p>Jeong Pilgyu clenched his fists tightly, his chest heaving. The gaze he directed at Seoryeong was filled with intense disgust and wariness. Seoryeong calmly accepted his piercing stare, waiting patiently.</p>
<p>“… What exactly do you want?”</p>
<p>“A job.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The thick furrow between his eyebrows eased momentarily.</p>
<p>“I heard that the private company that handles VIP customer protection the most is called ‘Blast.’</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I saw an article where the CEO was interviewed, and he said that this year’s cyber defense convention was even awarded by the National Intelligence Service’s Deputy Director General himself, and Blast was in charge of security for the event.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong smiled normally, hiding a dangerous undercurrent.</p>
<p>“I read in a defense paper that Blast is also a subcontractor of the NIS, and when they’re short-handed on an operation, they make good use of private companies.”</p>
<p>“… Why are you looking into such things?”</p>
<p>Jeong Pilgyu, whose complexion had returned to normal, clenched his fist.</p>
<p>“What do you want from me?”</p>
<p>“I told you.”</p>
<p>Whether she utilized the security personnel or directly approached VIP figures, what she urgently needed now was a covert job.</p>
<p>“A job? Do you expect me to believe that?” he asked.</p>
<p>“So you don’t believe me?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jeong Pilgyu set his jaw, ‘What will you do if I don’t believe you?’ His fist clenched involuntarily at Seoreyong’s arrogance.</p>
<p>Thoughts of his wife, young daughter, and the unpredictable sister-in-law crossed his mind.</p>
<p><em>If this woman really involves Channa in an attempt to defect…</em></p>
<p>The mere thought made his temples throb. However, he pragmatically touched upon the difficult aspects first.</p>
<p>“Blast only hires people with military skills. That means people from the Department of Defense, former National Security Agency employees, special agents, intelligence officers, and veterans. But you, Han Seoryon….”</p>
<p>He met her gaze, indicating that her lack of skills was the issue.</p>
<p>“You don’t have the required skills.”</p>
