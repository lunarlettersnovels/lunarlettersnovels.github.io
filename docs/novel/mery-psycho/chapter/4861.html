            <p><strong>Chapter 13.1</strong></p>
<p>The black agent didn’t leave an official document, but Lee Wooshin was basically the corner stone of the Overseas National Interest Information Department.</p>
<p>The field team that helped him changed each time, but Lee Wooshin was permanent.</p>
<p>The unofficial member of team 1 in Overseas National Interest Information Department. Lee Wooshin was the only member of this team.</p>
<p>“I don’t do anything without a silicon mask even in my personal time. Are there any other freaks like me?”</p>
<p>-….</p>
<p>He smiled at the senior manager’s silence.</p>
<p>“I thought it was work habit but the hospital says it’s OCD. If I don’t fix it now, I’ll be that person that rips my own face. Ah… No wonder some random ghost without face was staring me at every night.”</p>
<p>Unlike his pretend to be pity voice, he was all smiles. His tongue was licking the corner of his mouth. He looked like such a bully.</p>
<p>“I can’t do spy work anyway. I got tattoo.”</p>
<p>-What?</p>
<p>The black agent’s body has to be clean. That so that you wouldn’t be pointed as ‘suspect’, so they had to keep their body clean as an unwritten rule.</p>
<p>They especially had to input new visual information or have to make up a new person as they delete them so they had to approach every detail calculative.</p>
<p>To have a tattoo on a black agent…! It was breaking the unwritten rule. The senior manager tried to hide his reaction and respond.</p>
<p>-Is it permanent?</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>-It’s fine. We can hide scars so you don’t think we can’t hide tattoos?</p>
<p>“I did it on my balls.”</p>
<p>-Come again?</p>
<p>“You heard me so why are you asking again?”</p>
<p>As he answered slickly, the senior manager clenched his teeth. Lee Wooshin knew it and he added joyfully.</p>
<p>“I can’t take my d*ck out so leisurely so what should I do?”</p>
<p>-Sigh… We can hide scars so you don’t think we can’t hide tattoos?</p>
<p>“I won’t be able to have s*x with target though.</p>
<p>-…!</p>
<p>“Anyone who would suck it would notice right away.”</p>
<p>-Lee Wooshin, you crazy bastard!</p>
<p>The senior manager shouted in the end.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin just frowned a bit, but he looked quite happy as he turned the wiper on. Then he was smiling as the wiper was cleaning the windshield.</p>
<p>-You belong to the country but you do what? Do what where? Are you crazy?</p>
<p>“I can’t tell if you’re a senior manager or a pimp at this point.”</p>
<p>-Shut your mouth, you bastard!</p>
<p>His superior was good at his job but he was also inflexible.</p>
<p>He thought that all agents are the property of the country so they shouldn’t be hurt or shouldn’t do anything rough, but at the same time, he thought that that someone can sacrifice themselves on behalf of all.</p>
<p>The agents were honest and role model citizen and nationalistic but at the same time they should be able to spy, blackmail, assassin, wiretap, etc.</p>
<p>The senior manager thought this as his life motto, and always put s*x in birdbox operation. The fact that they have to approach a woman who was tired and lonely was the whole point of the operation.</p>
<p>Of course, Lee Wooshin accepted this coldly. This was the first time for him – this type of operation and to suck a woman dry.</p>
<p>-You really going to quit? Is this why you’re doing all this? You out of all the people?</p>
<p>“What have you been listening to?”</p>
<p>-You wouldn’t.</p>
<p>“Unless you’re going to return my face stop. I’ll be the one sending off the dead after life.”</p>
<p>The senior manager didn’t believe Lee Wooshin when he says he was quitting. Because he…</p>
<p>-You… Don’t need that document anymore? That was the reason why you hang on. You’re going to give that up now?</p>
<p>The teasing voice suddenly stopped. His playful eyes showed anger.</p>
<p>His true rough nature showed up his face. It was his real face that he was hiding all along.</p>
<p>“I didn’t give up yet.”</p>
<p>He was quietly watching his hand.</p>
<p>The reason why Lee Wooshin became the NIS black agent was because of the top secret document. Joo Seolheon, the second grade director at the time, promised under the table that she would get him that document as she scouted him.</p>
<p>But even though she was promoted so quickly to the youngest senior manager, she didn’t have access to the document. It was something she was only able to do if she became the head of NIS.</p>
<p>“But, I just became like this after 10 years.”</p>
<p>-You’re still joking around?</p>
<p>“I failed even though I was a servant to an owl.”</p>
<p>His voice was weirdly cheery but his words were sharp. The operation was a success but the result was miniscule. Owl, the only evidence, was no longer useful.</p>
<p>“I have nowhere to take this anger out so I’m venting, is that so wrong?”</p>
<p>-So, you’re just targeting me…</p>
<p>The senior manager mumbled while not even trying to hide his fatigue. Lee Wooshin sounded calm and nice but inside of him lied a sly cunning fox. He was so good at just agitating people.</p>
<p>“It was either you or Wonchang. Gotta go by age first.”</p>
<p>When his eyes became a bit calm, there was a smoke on the bonnet of the car.</p>
<p><em>Ah, fuck</em>… His giggling face swore.</p>
<p>“I can’t pay too much at your funeral. Then—“</p>
<p>It was when he stopped the broken car and about to take in in-ear out.</p>
<p>-Ok, ok! Quit, you can quit!</p>
<p>The senior manager shouted in desperation.</p>
<p>-The operation the deceased was about to do, just finish it for us. I’ll try my best to get access to the document. I’m a step away from becoming the director of NIS.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>-I’m honest, you can quit after this. I’m just saying just settle everything on the field before you go.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin drank from his bottle of water.</p>
<p>-You can take your face and use it again.</p>
<p>He crushed the empty bottle upon hearing this.</p>
