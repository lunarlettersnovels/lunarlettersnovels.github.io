<p>“Cadet Han Seoryeong, you are a distraction to what I am trying to achieve. But no matter what I do, I can’t seem to get rid of you.”</p>
<p>He looked her in the eye and continued, “How far do I have to push you?”</p>
<p>“You know, I won’t quit.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>A cold wind blew between them, yet a faint, rising heat lingered in her stomach.</p>
<p>“Then I have no choice but to teach you properly. If you really must do this, I’ll show you exactly what foolish Cadet Han Seoryeong is missing.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong waited for him to continue, but he kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p>As she glanced down, her eyes caught on his white feet, then moved up to his long, firm calves, his muscular thighs, and the thick outline of his drawers.</p>
<p>His fair and handsome appearance made the sight feel oddly more vulgar. Despite having seen him naked during their first meeting, it still felt strangely new…</p>
<p>As her irritated eyes traveled higher, he suddenly spoke.</p>
<p>“What are you staring at?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin pressed his lips with the tip of his red tongue. The air seemed to freeze in a perfect silence.</p>
<p>Startled, Seoryeong blurted out an explanation. “Your nipples are hard.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You threw us into such cold water, but you don’t like the cold either, do you?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I can see everything.” She gestured with her eyes to his protruding nipples under her wet shirt. He responded with his usual mischievous grin.</p>
<p>“Who are you comparing yourself to? This instructor doesn’t have pubic hair like yours.”</p>
<p>And with that, Seoryeong left him. She couldn’t quite remember how she fled the scene in such a hurry. Even with the stamina to endure a 5km run, she found herself strangely out of breath.</p>
<p>Taking birth control pills to delay her period, Seoryeong suddenly thought she might be ovulating. Otherwise, there was no reason for this constant, irritating warmth.</p>
<p>However, considering that people sometimes experience random spikes in libido, she could accept it as a hormonal effect.</p>
<p>The more she nodded to herself, the more it felt like something uncomfortable inside her was falling away.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>By the fifth week of blast training, she approached combat training with a somewhat lighter heart.</p>
<p>“Shall we have a brief sparring session before we start?”</p>
<p>Even after that subtle day, she still struggled through the grueling training schedule, and Lee Wooshin, while relaxed, was strict and meticulously instructed. The subtle currents she felt at the pool last time had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>“Officer Seong Wookchan, Officer Han Seoryeong, step forward.”</p>
<p>It was then that both of their names were called out by him.</p>
<p>Seeing the man standing opposite her on the mat, Seoryeong couldn’t help but grimace. He was the same man who had started a fight in the Blast Agency facility, forcing her to dump food waste to stop the brawl. So, his name was Seong Wookchan.</p>
<p>Now, looking even more pathetic than before, he was glaring at her fiercely.</p>
<p>Instructors approached and handed them both simple protective gear. As she awkwardly held the headgear and pads, Lee Wooshin walked over. With swift, practiced movements, he equipped her with the gear as if he were rolling sushi, even securing the headgear over her head.</p>
<p>As he adjusted the pads, their eyes unexpectedly met with a hint of discomfort in his expression. Why was his face so stiff when addressing her directly?</p>
<p>“Just give it a try. Try it out and get used to it properly.”</p>
<p>He muttered cryptically.</p>
<p>Stepping into the center of the mat, Seoryeong soon found herself facing Sung Wook-chan. In truth, she had never really fought properly. While confident in a street fight, the problem was—</p>
<p>“Ugh……!”</p>
<p>To her surprise, Seong Wookchan was quite a skilled fighter.</p>
