            <p><strong>Chapter 145.2</strong></p>
<p>Russia? The word caught in her throat without fail.</p>
<p>“Probably because they were assigned the same mission as you, Han Seo-ryeong. And then they were disposed of.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“It must have been top-secret information that couldn’t be leaked. If that’s the case, you’re in just as much danger.”</p>
<p>His firm tone carried certainty. As he gripped her arms tightly, a sense of urgency trembled through their connected skin.</p>
<p>The entrance sensor lit up again. The man, with subtle shadows pooling around the bridge of his nose, leaned his face closer to hers.</p>
<p>“Even now, do you still think I’m interfering too much?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If you were hoping to marry a generous man, I’m sorry. I don’t trust that kind of company. I would never entrust my Seoryeong to those who would use her as a disposable tool and then dispose her off.”</p>
<p>For a moment, his words, spoken through gritted teeth, caught her off guard.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you an in-ear monitor the day before the mission.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Wooshin lifted Seoryeong and placed her on his foot, starting to limp toward the living room.</p>
<p>“Wait, Instructor…!”</p>
<p>“Seoryeong tends to want to do more when told not to, so this is my way of keeping you safe. If you plan to enter that widower’s room, make sure to have a direct line connected to me.”</p>
<p>“Why go that far?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I have to be strict. Am I supposed to make you a widow right after we get married?”</p>
<p>Her body shuddered. Instinctively, she almost averted her gaze but held steady and met his eyes. Feeling uncomfortable with her foot tingling, Seoryeong shifted the topic.</p>
<p>At the same time, she was worried about the pain in his injured foot, so she wrapped her arms around his neck to lighten her weight.</p>
<p>“Was Rigay Viktor just a criminal?”</p>
<p>What on earth is so noisy about this…? Wooshin raised an eyebrow, looking genuinely surprised as if he couldn’t believe she didn’t know that.</p>
<p>The man, whose face had hardened in displeasure, turned his head away. His sharply defined jawline twitched.</p>
<p>“Do you remember the chatter from the special operations team?”</p>
<p>At that moment, the loud voices of her instructors came to mind. Hadn’t they said that an entire family had died in an accident, and the lineage had been cut off? They had mentioned it was the family of a Russian prime minister. The prime minister’s wife was Korean…</p>
<p>But the expressions of the team members, happily gossiping, were clearer in her memory than the meaningless foreign gossip.</p>
<p>“The tragedy of the Solzhenitsyn family. That client was the one who blew up that mansion.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“It’s hard to call him just a simple criminal given his notoriety.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin let out a hollow laugh. Seoryeong didn’t miss the subtle change in the man’s mask-like smile.</p>
<p>Just how remarkable a person must he be to completely topple the family of a prime minister? What kind of malice could be behind it?</p>
<p>Seoryeong fell into thoughts that had nothing to do with her. Wooshin clicked his tongue and sat her down at the dining table.</p>
<p>“And do you remember the contents of the file? Where was the event location?”</p>
<p>“Ah… the Daegu Church of the Korean Orthodox Church.”</p>
<p>“Well remembered. That means, if luck is exceptionally bad, you might run into Kia.”</p>
<p>At that moment, her heart trembled as if she had stolen something.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I was planning to throw an even bigger fit, but I held back for the sake of my image as the groom-to-be. I already got my bad luck out of the way—didn’t want to invite anything worse.”</p>
<p>Kia might come, too?</p>
<p>This wasn’t discomfort or fear; it was anticipation.</p>
<p>The things Kia had said back then, which had once sounded like fanatical nonsense, were finally starting to make sense. Seoryeong barely stifled a smile.</p>
<p>Just when had Kia figured it all out?</p>
<p>If they met again… if they really crossed paths once more…</p>
<p>At that moment, a rough hand grabbed her chin. Wooshin looked deeply and intently into her eyes. The chill in their locked gazes intertwined.</p>
<p>Seoryeong pressed her lips to his.</p>
<p>It was little more than a symbolic act—a seal made of melted wax to silence him.</p>
<p>Even so, Wooshin clung to her like a drowning man.</p>
<p>His hot tongue filled the hollow of her mouth, scraping along her slick palate, stealing her breath.</p>
<p>Seoryeong shut her eyes tight and imagined herself in a wedding dress.</p>
<p>In some exotic corner of the world, she would face him and vow eternity.</p>
<p>And the only guest to witness it…</p>
<p>Would be Kia.</p>
<p>She had to meet Kia.</p>
