            <p><strong>Chapter 89.1</strong></p>
<p><em>Bang, bang―!</em></p>
<p>As the bullets fired, the rifle’s stock dug into her shoulder, sending a jolt of pain. Despite her careful aim, the shots repeatedly missed the target.</p>
<p>Seoryeong shook off her muddled thoughts and pulled her elbow back again. The wooden targets were moving erratically along the metal rails on the ground, shifting in various directions and speeds.</p>
<p>TACTICAL SHOOTING, Special Security Team Second Immediate Action Response Training.</p>
<p>She couldn’t afford to let her breath waver. Frowning, Seoryeong struggled to steady her uneven breathing and aimed once more. The shaking in her hands subsided, and her eyes started to follow the chaotic movement of the targets.</p>
<p><em>Wait, what happened to my marriage? How did I even start dating Hyun? We had a cozy relationship, even built a family together. So why am I so… rattled over just a kiss? Haven’t I practically graduated in that department?</em></p>
<p><em>Bang―!</em> With a precise shot, one of the targets was cleanly pierced.</p>
<p>“Sigh!”</p>
<p>Just as she relaxed her stance and lowered the rifle, a harsh voice rang out from somewhere.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, stay focused!”</p>
<p>A paint round hit her back, bursting on impact. Her tactical shirt, snug against her body, became soaked with red paint. At the same time, a fragment from a counterattack whizzed past, grazing her hair. Lee Wooshin was glaring at her, his expression fierce.</p>
<p>“Why are you dropping your stance before the drill is over?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Don’t apologize to me. Apologize to yourself—you just got killed by a paintball.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Get your head together.”</p>
<p>Really? This is coming from the same person who was shoving his tongue down my throat like a madman a few hours ago? Seoryeong glared at him, bottling up her frustration.</p>
<p>It seemed like she was the only one struggling to concentrate on the task at hand. How could someone who just invaded a married woman’s personal space like that suddenly switch back to being all business? Gritting her teeth, she got back into position.</p>
<p>For Seoryeong, the most challenging part was handling the AK rifle while trying to hit moving targets. The paintballs and smoke grenades flying from all directions were another constant nuisance.</p>
<p>The other shooters responded quickly and efficiently, but she was still far behind. Whenever she fumbled a reload or got hit by a paintball, she could feel the cold, judgmental stares boring into her.</p>
<p>“People like Han Seoryeong, who handle guns carelessly, are the ones who cause firearm accidents.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you handed me a pistol?”</p>
<p>The stern instructor’s expression suddenly softened. He ran a hand through his hair, looking around the training field as if he felt stifled. That’s when a red mark appeared on his previously unblemished forehead.</p>
<p>Seoryeong glanced at the mark she had left, then quickly looked away.</p>
<p>Watching that just reminded her of the blunt tongue that had been swirling inside her mouth. The way it pressed deep into her cheek, making her mouth bulge as if she had been given candy.</p>
<p>And the heat… the way he had suddenly melted in her mouth. <em>Stop, stop thinking about it.</em> The back of her neck started to feel hot.</p>
<p>Noticing her discomfort, Wooshin’s eyes narrowed slightly. He seemed about to say something but then closed his mouth.</p>
<p>Whatever he had intended to say, he swallowed it back, his brow furrowing like someone who had eaten something too sweet. His eyes still held a hint of a smile, but his lips hardened into a cold line.</p>
<p>“If your gun is in poor condition, it can fire even without pulling the trigger. If you’d been unlucky just now, there’d be a hole in your foot. Don’t give me a heart attack—be more careful.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>It was a stark contrast to the man who used to smile while barely lifting the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>The team members’ dazed stares had been piercing into one side of her cheek for a while now. They kept glancing in shock at Seoryeong’s swollen lips, then clearing their throats awkwardly as they scattered. Feeling frustrated, she rubbed her forehead.</p>
<p>This is not good for team morale.</p>
<p>The Special Security Team was currently undergoing weeks of grueling ship armed guard and CQB (Close Quarters Battle) training without any breaks. The tight schedule was to synchronize their every move down to the second in preparation for an upcoming mission in Africa.</p>
<p>But at a time like this.</p>
<p><em>Ugh!</em></p>
<p>Whether he sensed her distress or not, Lee Wooshin approached her from behind. When she tried to turn her head, he simply said, “Face forward,” giving a curt order.</p>
<p>He wrapped himself around her, correcting her improper grip on the firearm. His firm chest brushed against her shoulder blade, and his heavy jaw pressed lightly against the back of her head.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Bending down to match her height, Lee Wooshin firmly supported her wrist and forearm. His calm breathing and short hair tickled her cheek.</p>
<p>He’s too close. Just then, his brusque voice pierced her ear.</p>
<p>“Is the rifle difficult for you?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“I thought you’d handle the AK-47 better than a pistol, considering its length and weight.”</p>
