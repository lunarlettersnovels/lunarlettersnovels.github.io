            <p><strong>Chapter 52.2</strong></p>
<p>“Maybe both of them are trying to get me to talk? Is that it? What do you guys think? Did this only happen to me? Originally, it was probably something they both planned?”</p>
<p>“In fact, that’s highly likely.”</p>
<p>“But still, the other instructor must have been hurt a lot, and that’s because of me because I didn’t speak. I should have just spoken about the coordinates. But now that I think about it again, it’s dizzying.” He shuddered as if dizzy. One of the recruits who had been watching him burst out.</p>
<p>“This guy, snap out of it! Wasn’t it obvious from the start? You’re being deliberately made to feel guilty! Do you know that torture isn’t just about physically stepping on someone? And just by looking at it, it seems to have worked really well on you. Get yourself together for real!”</p>
<p>“Is that so? But I keep feeling my heart pounding. Because I was so clueless, so ignorant, it feels like he got hurt!” He grabbed his head with a pale face as if going mad.</p>
<p>“Should I have just spoken? Especially since he got hit a lot more, I kept running away and getting hit even more!”</p>
<p>As the conversation returned to square one, the recruits exchanged glances and quietly got up from their seats. Seoryeong also blushed and pulled the chair back, lifting the tray.</p>
<p>At that moment, the last person to stand up politely asked, “Who’s the other instructor whom Instructor Lee Wooshin hurt?” His lips twisted into a muffled pronunciation. Then a depressed voice came out.</p>
<p>“Instructor Jin Hojae.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>BANG, BANG-BANG!</p>
<p>The sound of loud gunfire echoed in the underground shooting range. Lee Wooshin, with earmuffs on, relentlessly pulled the trigger with a fierce expression.</p>
<p>Brass casings fell heavily to the ground, and the paper targets far away were torn to shreds in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>It had been days since the interrogation training ended.</p>
<p>As an agent of the National Intelligence Service, he had never hesitated to weigh a man’s life in the balance, but now he was stuck in a trivial dilemma.</p>
<p>Moreover, due to the unreleased heat, one corner of his head was filled with bitter smoke.</p>
<p>Contrary to the expectation that getting rid of the owl would bring him comfort, her declared ambition was rather shocking.</p>
<p>Bent nature… No, I don’t want to dwell on that word or even think about it anymore.</p>
<p>Her determination had already been experienced enough to raise blood pressure. Even if she broke her ankle, she wouldn’t give up on Kim Hyun.</p>
<p>Despite resorting to violence forcibly, her eyes didn’t falter in the slightest. She wasn’t the type to stop just because of a twisted ankle.</p>
<p>But if the owl were to be removed―. I can’t believe you’re just gonna go around looking for bent d!cks…. If you’re really going to leave the academy and go around looking for other assholes’ d!cks….</p>
<p>With that, he used up all the bullets in his magazine, refilled the chamber, and began grinding away at the paper targets.</p>
<p>After reuniting with the owl, a former operative, he felt a little out of sorts. Something in the back of his mind that he couldn’t quite put his finger on.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin was always the kind of person who ripped off the mask at the end of an operation, cutting many things together at the same time because that was the basis, the standard, the law of the job.</p>
<p>So why couldn’t he do that with the owl?</p>
<p>Was it because she was his wife? Was it because they were living together?</p>
<p>If that’s the only reason I’m upset, I shouldn’t be an agent in the first place. I’ve been an agent for ten years, and I’ve intentionally approached and deceived more than a few people.</p>
<p>It’s hard to count, and it’s not like his conscience has been repaired, and it doesn’t make sense for him to be troubled in the first place.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin tightened his grip on his gun to shake off this grim feeling.</p>
<p>In any case, their lives were parallel until the end.</p>
<p>When a target and an NIS agent become entangled, the situation only ends when one of them gives up or gives in.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it would end in ruin for both of them, and Lee Wooshin realized soberingly that he had to be clear at this point.</p>
<p>Hoping that the time ahead would be as smooth and uneventful as their love affair and marriage was now a futile and naive wish. It was no longer possible to hold Han Seoryeong in the palm of his hand. This was the only conclusion.</p>
<p>No one who is not ‘Kim Hyun’ can control her. Then, I’d rather bring Kim Hyun’s body.</p>
<p>The man’s face turned cold at the sudden thought.</p>
<p>Just then, the door to the underground shooting range opened and someone knocked on the partition wall made of sound-absorbing material. He took off his earplugs and realized it was Ki Taemin, a member of the same special security team.</p>
<p>“Team Leader, Jin Hojae’s face is very recognizable.” He said sarcastically. Young and well-groomed, Ki-Taemin was an accomplished sniper who had left the 707th after being bullied in his unit.</p>
<p>Shortly after completing basic special warfare training, he went on a rampage and was kicked out of the unit.</p>
<p>Afterward, Blast began to train him in the camouflage specialty required of snipers.</p>
<p>Recalling the information Wonchang had compiled for him, Lee Wooshin’s eyes glazed over.</p>
<p>“Why are you mad at me for messing with your friend?”</p>
<p>Ki Taemin groaned in disgust, “You should do it more often. I don’t want to see you just lying around and whining.”</p>
<p>“Officer Ki Taemin,” Lee Wooshin said, lowering his gun and looking at his subordinate expressionlessly. “You said you’ve been friends with Officer Jin since you were kids, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Why?” Even though they always fought when put together, despite being long-time friends, his face still looked hesitant when he answered.</p>
<p>“Then you must have taken baths together often when you were young.”</p>
<p>Just then, as the metal rail moved, the paper target resembling a human outline came into view. It had holes punched exclusively in the genital area.</p>
