            <p><strong>Chapter 39.2</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeopng rushed to the shower, but by the time she got there, the guys had already stripped off their clothes and taken up residence under the gushing water. The hot water was falling from all directions at once, and the shower room was soon filled with thick steam. Seoryeong paused outside the door for a moment.</p>
<p>Are you going to wait and freeze yourself to death?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Just then, a thick blanket fell over her head.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong is coming with me.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Otherwise, do you plan to stand there with a face as cold as a stone while the others finish showering?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Seoryeong bit her lip, her shoulders trembling even when she stood still.</p>
<p>“Are you hesitating or just want to peek at them?”</p>
<p>“I…I’m not…”</p>
<p>With her nose still running, Seoryeong reluctantly followed him. Exiting the dormitory and moving to the adjacent building, she saw the private accommodations, quite different from the barracks used by the members.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin casually opened a door, led her through the living room and kitchen, and pushed her into the shower room.</p>
<p>“You can use this shower room from now on.”</p>
<p>“What is this place?”</p>
<p>“My quarters.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Seoryeong hesitated, feeling like she had made a mistake.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin asked, unfazed. “Why?”</p>
<p>“I…I’d rather not argue with someone who asks ‘why’ in this kind of situation.”</p>
<p>“Then how may I help you?” Lee Wooshin asked.</p>
<p>“I want to work for you.”</p>
<p>At that moment, scalding hot water poured down without warning. She recoiled, her shoulders tensing up.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin reset the temperature to a moderately warm setting, but she was so cold that even the hot water felt like a blow. Instead of gently melting her flesh, it hurt like a shattering ice cube.</p>
<p>As she stood frozen beneath the pouring water, Lee Wooshin began to squeeze her hand.</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong flinched and tried to pull her hand away, but the force was more insistent.</p>
<p>“Relax, you’re too frozen.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see how that has anything to do with you, sir, and I’m not the only one who’s frozen.”</p>
<p>“If you keep spacing out like this, even staying under the water all night won’t be enough.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“Are you planning to sleep over in my quarters?”</p>
<p>Annoyed as she was, it was better to comply quickly and leave. Reluctantly yielding her hand, Lee Wooshin skillfully found the right spots to press. Slowly, the tension in her body started to ease as her frozen skin began to thaw.</p>
<p>With her muscles loosened, she could finally breathe a sigh of relief. Gradually, her eyelids drooped.</p>
<p>As she closed her eyes, she suddenly remembered her husband. When she and Kim Hyun would go to the market, everyone would say, “Your husband looks so reliable!”</p>
<p>But Lee Wooshin appeared brash and stubborn, often upsetting people’s expectations. The compliments about his looks were merely superficial, lacking depth.</p>
<p>But his face is so different… Yet, there’s an oddly familiar sensation…</p>
<p>“Keep your eyes open.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Then, a cold voice rang out.</p>
<p>“Do not close your eyes in front of an instructor.”</p>
<p>Sje snapped out of it. She squeezed her eyelids shut, and the sound of the cascading shower began again.</p>
<p>Did I… doze off for a second? Seoryeong quickly rinsed her face.</p>
<p>“Sorry… sorry.”</p>
<p>The water poured down her neck and chest, making her skin tingle. She shook her head and swept her long hair out of her face as if to drive away the dampness.</p>
<p>His well-timed rebuke snapped her out of her thoughts. She’d better get in the shower before her strange thoughts got any deeper.</p>
<p>She opened her lips, the color returning to her cheeks, ready to push him away.</p>
<p>“Instructor, I’d like to clean up properly now. Are you going to stay there?”</p>
<p>In response, Lee Wooshin gave an unexpected response.</p>
<p>“How much have you hidden from your husband, exactly?”</p>
<p>“…Why are you bringing that up now?”</p>
<p>When she looked at him defensively, Lee Wooshin abruptly shut off the shower.</p>
<p>What…!</p>
<p>She let out a shallow cough and looked up at him in disbelief. He didn’t take his hand off the shower switch button in a casual manner.</p>
<p>Is he really going to act like this? Seoryeong even pushed his hand away as if to snatch it, but he didn’t flinch. As her body melted into the warmth, the return of cold air seemed to make her shiver twice as much.|</p>
