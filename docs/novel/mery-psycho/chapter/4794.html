            <p><strong>Chapter 50.1 (R-rated)</strong></p>
<p>“You crazy bastard…!”</p>
<p>The cold air on her lower body made her skin prickle. Seeing her exposed genitals, Seoryeong’s face flushed red with shame.</p>
<p>Unable to bear it, she shut her eyes tightly, and then a foreign finger unhesitatingly brushed through her pubic hair and scratched her sensitive skin.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>She grimaced as if something filthy had touched her, biting her tongue to endure. Each place his fingers touched felt like it was burning. The sensation was intolerable.</p>
<p>“Say it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll kill you, really….”</p>
<p>“Even if you’re penetrated by another man, do you think your husband would feel good about you looking for him?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Though his words were mocking, Seoryeong suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>“Are you going to keep looking for your husband?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Say it quickly. If you don’t speak now, your vag!na will get ruined.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>When Seoryeong glared at him with a sudden seriousness, he lazily tilted his head back and responded.</p>
<p>“I told you, the sensible talk was over.”</p>
<p>Then, without any warning, his middle finger abruptly thrust into her dry opening.</p>
<p>“Aah…!”</p>
<p>It just hurt. There was no warmth in the fingers forcefully shoved inside her. She tried to twist her body, but he immediately restrained her thigh with one arm and subdued her.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>As the inner walls were harshly pressed, pain surged. She gritted her teeth and furrowed her brow, but then he started forcing his index and ring fingers in together.</p>
<p>“Agh…! It hurts…!”</p>
<p>“Of course it hurts. You’re not having s*x for fun right now.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, relax.”</p>
<p>Even he seemed strained, with veins popping on his forehead as he held his breath.</p>
<p>She knew this was torture training and that she hadn’t rung the bell to give up, but a needless wave of sadness welled up inside her.</p>
<p>Would Kim Hyun know? He probably doesn’t know that I’m enduring this, even suffering such humiliation, just to catch him….</p>
<p>That thought somehow made her even angrier, and she bit her tongue hard. A fierce, intense emotion burst forth, aimed at no one in particular.</p>
<p>“This isn’t even s*x, so why should I relax? Just shove it in, you bastard…!”</p>
<p>Wooshin’s brow furrowed. His scrunched face was satisfying, and despite trembling with anger, Seoryeong smiled sarcastically. Then, his fingers inside her paused momentarily.</p>
<p>But only for a moment. Soon, three fingers forcefully dug into her.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Without changing his expression, Wooshin crudely scratched her inner walls. Each movement made her legs spread and tighten. Yet, when she defiantly lifted her head, he cracked his neck side to side.</p>
<p>His fingers moved in and out of her vag!na, slapping against her labia and making lewd, sticky sounds.</p>
<p>He repeatedly bent his fingers, scooping inside as if drawing water. But it wasn’t a caressing motion. His jaw muscles tensed visibly.</p>
<p>“Even being violated like this, finding your husband is still more urgent and important?”</p>
<p>Wooshin’s voice was chillingly cold, slicing through the air like a blade. On the other hand, Seoryeong kept her mouth shut and glared at him, her eyes dry but streaked with burst blood vessels from the strain.</p>
<p>The intensity of Lee Wooshin’s stare could have melted steel, yet she remained unfazed, her resolve unshaken. His breathing also became slightly rougher.</p>
<p>“Coming into Blast Company to find your husband means there’s a chance you might face this kind of violence. How do you not understand that? You walked into the garbage bin yourself, why don’t you get the whole picture, you idiot…!”</p>
<p>He yanked his hand out of her vag!na angrily. The air grew heavy and cold.</p>
<p>They glared at each other, breathing harshly. Their exchanged glances were fierce and intense. But seeing Seoryeong stubbornly keeping her mouth shut, Wooshin displayed his disgust.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so blindly stubborn.”</p>
<p>His gaze lingered on her crimson vag!na.</p>
<p>He ran a hand through his hair, muttered a short curse, and thrust his fingers back inside her. The once-stimulated interior swallowed his slippery fingers immediately.</p>
