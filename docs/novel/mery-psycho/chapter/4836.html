        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 28.2</strong></p>
<p>“Thanks for disobeying your leader’s command and running wild on your own, I finally have the opportunity to get rid of what’s been bothering me all along. I wanted to express my gratitude while I’m at it, but looking at that dumbfounded expression of yours, it seems unnecessary.”</p>
<p>He pointed his chin at Seoryeong, who was speechless.</p>
<p>“Listen to me…!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong, now fully alert, retorted sharply. In response, the man’s large hand firmly grabbed the back of her head.</p>
<p>The scalp tingled under the firm grip. Iweusin locked eyes with her, delivering his warning with each word as if driving a nail into a coffin.</p>
<p>“Remember? The moment you killed someone with a gun.”</p>
<p>Her shoulders twitched involuntarily at the unexpected reminder.</p>
<p>The patience she maintained while enduring the knife, the adrenaline that surged like a pump, the excitement of shooting wildly, and the moment of intense focus when she aimed for the vital spot.</p>
<p>She vividly remembered every moment. She hadn’t overlooked a single thing.</p>
<p>“Seoryeong, you shot and killed a person as a civilian.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Just because the company covered it up doesn’t mean we can shamelessly turn a blind eye.”</p>
<p>A chilling voice admonished quietly.</p>
<p>“But you can still pass it off as a horrific nightmare once. Before you go down the wrong path, it’s time to stop. This isn’t where you belong, Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>The once relaxed grip that had grabbed her tightened lightly and irresponsibly.</p>
<p>“It’s already twisted enough as it is.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin got up from the bed and tightened his loosened tie.</p>
<p>There was nothing but duty and annoyance in his withdrawn demeanor, nothing more than that of a man in charge.</p>
<p>The man who had effortlessly approached now distanced himself as effortlessly as he had come.</p>
<p>“If Seoryeong were my subordinate, it wouldn’t end like this. I wouldn’t have cut you off so simply, so kindly, with such an explanation. Instead, I’d have carved you to death.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“So go back to your ordinary life. This is my final courtesy.”</p>
<p>The opaque mist from the humidifier spread between them.</p>
<p>“If you can’t discard someone without hesitation, then don’t look this way. Don’t make anything precious. Just live safely in a world where taking care of patients with sincerity is always the right answer.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I need someone who is easy to throw away and easy to turn around, and I don’t see much value in someone like you. It’s embarrassing and uncomfortable to watch you, Ms. Han Seoryeong, spouting off platitudes because you’ve lived your whole life like that.”</p>
<p>The man with his back turned, straightening his clothes, looked away. With a crisp smile, he drove the last wedge as if proposing a date.</p>
<p>“Then do me a favor and we’ll never see each other again?”</p>
<p>When Seoryeong had no answer, he shrugged his shoulders once and left the hospital room with a flourish. The click of the door closing was resolute and cold.</p>
<p>Seoryeong couldn’t hide her despondent expression in the hospital room.</p>
<p>She couldn’t even grasp what had just happened. She simply lay there, her body limp with confusion.</p>
<p>Blinking her eyelids slowly, she stared at the ceiling, and only belatedly did she realize the situation.</p>
<p><em>Was I… fired?</em></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A few days passed like that.</p>
<p>From the day Seoryeong woke up, Lee Wooshin no longer visited the hospital room. He was finished with her and there was nothing to discuss.</p>
<p>The nurse who often came in to check on her would say, “A handsome man often came by when you were unconscious.”</p>
<p>The only thing that stuck with her was the fact that she was suddenly unemployed.</p>
<p>Seoryeong also visited Channa’s room when she got the strength.</p>
<p>A girl lying still, as if dead, with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>Around her were Jeong Pilgyu and his wife, both with worried expressions, and their young daughter, surrounding Channa.</p>
<p>Seoryeong didn’t care about the uneasy gaze of Jeong Pilgyu. She stared at the thick bandages around Channa’s neck for a long time before leaving the room.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. She’s alive. Even if she doesn’t wake up right away… she’s alive. I told you I wouldn’t let you die alone.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em></em>Seoryeong smiled as she walked back down the corridor, a smile she had hidden away.</p>
<p><em>You know… I shot that bastard.</em></p>
<p>Thinking back to that moment, her pulse beneath her jaw surged strongly. It was strangely not an unpleasant sensation.</p>
