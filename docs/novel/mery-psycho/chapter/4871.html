            <p><strong>Chapter 6</strong></p>
<p>Facing the confused Jeong Pilgyu, Seoryeong altered the question a bit.</p>
<p>“What if I get caught by the National Intelligence Service?”</p>
<p>It was a simple question. If she absolutely couldn’t find him, then, inversely, wouldn’t it work if she made him find her? If she couldn’t find the tail, couldn’t she set the forest on fire?</p>
<p>“If I do something bad… can I meet current agents? Can I cross paths with him?”</p>
<p>If he was in the unreachable upper echelons, she would just have to start from the bottom and beat her way up. Beat, ask, beat, ask, until she eventually reached him.</p>
<p>Seoryeong was determined to do whatever it took to meet Kim Hyun.</p>
<p>A deep and lengthy silence enveloped the three people. Seoryeong remained expressionless, while the two Blast employees wore faces of suspicion.</p>
<p>In the midst of Jeong Pilgyu struggling to find the right words, Channa, sniffling, exclaimed, “The food from the National Intelligence Service prison must be delicious…!” Jeong Pilgyu kicked her calf to stop him.</p>
<p>“Miss Han Seoryeong, don’t get weird ideas.”</p>
<p>She didn’t respond and began to walk away. The stick she had been holding was promptly thrust into the trash bin. With every step she took, a strange conviction settled in.</p>
<p><em>My eyes were your fault, right Kim Hyun?</em></p>
<p><em>You made me blind.</em></p>
<p>As the lost light returned to her pupils, her chest grew colder and colder.</p>
<p>Seoryeong began to laugh loudly. The sharp laughter echoed in the empty corridor like a persistent echo. Her distorted smirk won’t go away anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>Kim Hyun, we will definitely meet again.</em></p>
<p><em>Because you will come to catch me first.</em></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>With each step down the worn-out stairs, the man’s gait changed.</p>
<p>The honest and affectionate appearance of a diligent office worker in a small company gradually transformed. The once straight steps became slow and uneven, and the eyes filled with affection turned into thin pupils.</p>
<p>He unbuttoned his neatly fastened shirt one by one and peeled off the silicone skin from his collarbone.</p>
<p>As he did, the angular jaw, the long eyes with sparse eyebrows, and the unremarkable nose disappeared, revealing the man’s real face.</p>
<p>His moderately tanned and rough skin transformed into remarkably fair and smooth skin, making him look almost like a foreigner. The distinct eyebrows, the high and sharp nose, extending from the eyebrows to the bridge, all formed a completely different visage.</p>
<p>Literally, he was a completely different person.</p>
<p>Especially striking were the jawline, sharp nose, and deep-set eyes that seemed conspicuously uncharacteristic of an East Asian.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a handsome man but an astounding harmony between facial features that sparkled transparently between them.</p>
<p>He then peeled off the round hydrogel film attached to his neck.</p>
<p>“Well… this is downright disgusting. It’s not like a snake shedding its skin. Even if you see it in person, it’s hard to believe. What would happen if a former CIA agent exposes special makeup secrets on YouTube?”</p>
<p>The field support team hacker from the National Intelligence Service grumbled as he reviewed the CCTV footage collected about a month ago.</p>
<p>At that moment, the man coming down the stairs glanced at the lens hanging from the ceiling. His slightly double-lidded eyes and sharp, converging eye contours suddenly twisted as if to show off.</p>
<p>Even with the torn leather stuck to his face, he seemed quite relaxed. He twirled the silicone mask around his index finger and tossed it like pizza dough, catching it effortlessly.</p>
<p>Crazy… The only pitiable support for this man who does as he pleases was the hacker himself, part of the field support team, especially among them, being the only hacker.</p>
<p>The only relief was that this mission was finally over.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>How did he manage to endure this shaky mission for two years? No, it’s been two and a half years since he approached and befriended the target.</p>
<p>Every time he saw the man on the screen wearing the silicone mask, attaching a chip to modify the pitch of his vocal cords, and effortlessly playing the role of ‘Kim Hyun,’ he felt nervous, unable to discern whether it was a mission or genuine shyness.</p>
<p>But as soon as the withdrawal order came, he changed immediately. He completely tore apart Kim Hyun. Just like the appearance on the CCTV screen.</p>
<p>Despite knowing his dazzling record, the hacker, who had just entered the field like a novice, couldn’t help but be amazed.</p>
<p>The employee pressed the receiver embedded in his ear and spoke up.</p>
<p>“So, Team Leader, did you manage to escape safely?”</p>
<p>In response, a sly chuckle pierced through his ears.</p>
<p>“Oh, didn’t even look back and just ran away. Was afraid I might get caught.”</p>
<p>The smooth and silky voice carried a touch of exaggeration.</p>
<p>The top agent with a hundred faces.</p>
<p>His code name was “Masukaмаска.”</p>
<p>Member of the unofficial first team of the Overseas National Interest Intelligence Service.</p>
<p>Known for having never been caught, a player among players with a cunning and deceptive personality.</p>
<p>The Black Agent, Lee Wooshin, is said to only operate secretly under the command of Deputy Director 1.</p>
<p>He is such a natural actor that with the support of the Agency for Defense Development, he can become an old man, a foreigner, a drug addict, and even change his gender and become a woman.</p>
<p>The young hacker who had assisted and observed Lee Wooshin closely for the past two and a half years now firmly believed those words.</p>
<p>He played the role of a dedicated husband perfectly as well.</p>
<p>“But seriously, did you submit your resignation? Deputy Director was tearing his hair out.”</p>
<p>―What’s it to you?</p>
<p>“If I don’t follow you, who else will?!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a feeling of sadness burst out.</p>
<p>The young man, whose grandfather was a man of national merit, was so moved by Lee Wooshin’s performance that he even pledged loyalty.</p>
<p>How he gathered external and North Korean information overseas, how he assassinated and dealt with traitors who fled with the country’s secrets.</p>
<p>―Won Chang, at this rate, I might end up asking you to wipe my ass later. How about that?</p>
