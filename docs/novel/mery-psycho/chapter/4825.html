        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 34.1</strong></p>
<p>The man opened his eyes again, and his shaped gaze landed squarely on Seoryeong’s right arm. His gaze then naturally drifted to the man standing next to her, who was nervously chewing on a piece of candy.</p>
<p>“For those who have completed basic training-” Lee Wooshin continued casually as if there hadn’t been a pause.</p>
<p>“They will be given a final test to qualify for entry into the Special Security Team. Those with good scores will be prioritised for selection.”</p>
<p>The recruits’ faces changed for a moment at that last statement, as they had all heard before that the salaries and benefits of the Special Security Team were overwhelmingly higher than those of other teams.</p>
<p>“And.”</p>
<p>He gripped the two edges of his sabre tightly and twisted his shoulders once, the tendons in his grip crackling with fiery intensity. ]</p>
<p>He pierced Seoryeong with his gaze, his pupils seeming to penetrate her.</p>
<p>“We will ruthlessly dismiss useless members.”</p>
<p>His lips curved into a smooth smile, resembling that of a clown. His already pale face seemed to glow brighter with his crisp grin.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Outside, three large buses were waiting.</p>
<p>Squeezed between the big men, Seoryeong’s nerves were on edge. She couldn’t get rid of the feeling that everything around her was a landmine, a trap.</p>
<p>In such a hostile environment, all she could do was endure, no matter how deadly and dirty it got. But she had a feeling it wouldn’t be easy.</p>
<p>Still, she made up her mind as she left the house. She gripped the strap of her bag hard.</p>
<p>As she stumbled along, a shadow fell over her head. The scent was unfamiliar, but she knew immediately who it was.</p>
<p>“Miss Han Seoryeong, did my words confuse you?”</p>
<p>He stared down at her, as if on second thought.</p>
<p>“I thought I made it clear that I didn’t want to see you again.”</p>
<p>“Yes, so we should cut off this conversation immediately.”</p>
<p>“Are you doing this on purpose, did you come in here hoping to get your ass kicked?”</p>
<p>He looked a little troubled, a little defeated.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean it in that grandiose way, but I’m good on the line.”</p>
<p>“A line?”</p>
<p>He raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Kang Taegon, CEO.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“Someone fired me, but another one rewarded me, It’s obvious which one I should follow.”</p>
<p>He wrinkled his forehead, making another peculiar expression. Lee Wooshin had seen a similar face even in Thailand. It was more lighthearted than discouraged, more exploratory than intrigued. Even with the nature of the job.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe this.” His eyes narrowed and he ran his finger across his bottom lip.</p>
<p>Just then, a taxi pulled up to the front door, and at the same time, he picked up the phone.</p>
<p>“Yes,” was all he said, and he grabbed Seoryeong’s forearm and started to lead her.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>When Seo tried to shake off his arm, he quickly released his grip.</p>
<p>“Leave if you don’t want to lose your arm, I’m not kidding.”</p>
<p>The other recruits are boarding a large bus, and waiting for her is a rickety taxi. Seoryeong scrunched up her face and glared at him. It was a moment when her dislike for this arrogant man skyrocketed.</p>
<p>He clenched his jaw as he saw the stubbornness and arrogance intertwine, and he, too, looked impatient.</p>
<p>“Ms. Han, you can take that car.”</p>
<p>“Let me go, I’ll call the CEO!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Whether you’re a team leader or an instructor, if I’m being treated like this because of my rank, then I’m going to use another method.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“I told you, I got in through the grace of Mr. Kang Taegon, so if you want me to get fired again, talk to him first.”</p>
<p>“So proud to be his puppet, I see. Do you think the string is still attached? Do you see him her?”</p>
<p>Unyielding glances clashed in the air.</p>
<p>“I think you’re mistaken, Ms. Han, but I don’t think I have any authority over you. Even if the CEO gave you the green light, it’s up to me to kick you out of training.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m telling you, save your fare, you’ll be heading home soon anyway.”</p>
