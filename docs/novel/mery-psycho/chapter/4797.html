            <p><strong>Chapter 48.1</strong></p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>Someone gently pulled the tightly clenched fist. A husky voice sought permission and handed over a warm mug.</p>
<p>“You seemed cold.”</p>
<p>He made sure Seoryeong’s fingertips felt the curvature of the cup, so she wouldn’t be startled. Despite his voice sounding like a bandit’s, his hands were surprisingly gentle.</p>
<p>In that moment, Seoryeong might have, perhaps, suppressed a choked-up feeling, acknowledging a little. She had to live in this kind of world from now on.</p>
<p>Remembering people by their voices, feeling someone’s kindness not through a smile but through temperature—a completely different world.</p>
<p>But she had also thought that maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.</p>
<p>The downpour that day quickly subsided.</p>
<p>“Ack!”</p>
<p>The sensation of a cold needle piercing through made her eyes snap open. Cold water, poured mercilessly onto her face, trickled down her jawline.</p>
<p>Where was this? Blinking dazedly, water droplets flowed into her wet eyelashes.</p>
<p>Memories were gradually coming back to her white, empty mind. Oh… she had been standing in formation at the assembly grounds.</p>
<p>She glanced around while shaking her head. The room was narrow and stuffy, with only one old light bulb hanging from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Seoryeong stared at the flickering bulb as if it might go out at any moment. Each time it dimmed and brightened, the messy room was revealed.</p>
<p>Tiled walls stained with dirt, a broken bathtub filled with water, a wooden table with mismatched legs, and a variety of long tools scattered around. And…</p>
<p>“Why are you just waking up now? I thought you we are gonna rot waiting.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A man was holding her legs with a nonchalant expression.</p>
<p>As her hazy mind cleared, the bound arms started to twitch.</p>
<p>She was suspended like a fish, her arms tied above her head. Since her feet couldn’t touch the ground, just hanging there was quite taxing.</p>
<p>Her wrists, bearing her entire weight, felt numb for quite some time, and the skin rubbed by the ropes was itchy and sore.</p>
<p>Bit by bit, she began to grasp the situation she was in. Amidst it all, she thought it was fortunate not to be hanging upside down.</p>
<p>“Did you drug us?”</p>
<p>She asked the most pressing question first. However, Wooshin remained silent, only pouring water into the bathtub. He didn’t answer, but sometimes silence itself sounded like an answer.</p>
<p>Oh… Was it the water they drank after training?</p>
<p>The man approached with a brimming bucket of water, seeming almost overflowing.</p>
<p>Being with that man in this state for two days…</p>
<p>It was definitely torture and embarrassment.</p>
<p>At that moment, Wooshin muttered with a grim expression.</p>
<p>“59.9343°N, 30.3351°E.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“I already know the contents of the note.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong looked at him with a puzzled expression. What kind of training was this? It seemed to be over before it even started.</p>
<p>“I have something I want to hear, so there’s no need to make that expression,” he said beneath the orange light bulb, his face strangely unfamiliar and alien today.</p>
<p>While he often used informal language to belittle the recruits, it didn’t feel like that now. He wasn’t a team leader or an instructor at the moment. He seemed a bit more natural, and therefore closer to his true self.</p>
<p>“The instructors promised to teach you properly, to show you what you’re missing,” he said, pulling the rope attached to the pulley with force. As a result, her arms were pulled closer to her ears, and her body rose sharply, suspended like a slaughtered piece of meat hanging from the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Have you ever thought about what you might endure if you become a prisoner?”</p>
<p>He was now at eye level with her. Seoryeong glanced down at the distant floor, trying to move her feet unnecessarily. Wooshin picked up a long stick that had been on the table. It resembled a blind person’s cane.</p>
<p>“If you do something wrong, you might end up facing something bad in return,” he said. In an instant, electricity sparked from the stick he held.</p>
<p>“Blast’s main clients are often countries led by corrupt leaders. Most of them commit international crimes, and the Special Security Team cleans up behind these scumbags.”</p>
<p>“Clients associate with dictators, rebels, government agencies, and even drug lords.” Lee Wooshin said.</p>
