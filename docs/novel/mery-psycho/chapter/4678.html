            <p><strong>Chapter 109.2</strong></p>
<p><em>This man! Did he really think he could fold his massive frame and fit into her arms? </em>She exhaled sharply, her body steadily being pushed backward.</p>
<p>Wooshin inhaled her scent deeply as he kept his face buried against her nape. Suddenly, he lifted his head and cupped the back of hers.</p>
<p>“Mm… ngh…”</p>
<p>Without warning, his heated tongue parted her lips and swept across them, his rushed breaths mingling with hers.</p>
<p>Supporting her head, Wooshin kissed her deeply, pushing into her mouth with an almost desperate urgency. His tongue explored relentlessly, stirring and delving as if uneasy.</p>
<p>The searing heat of last night seemed to reignite, making her ache faintly below. Hot breaths mingled greedily, and their lips grew wet with shared desire.</p>
<p>Unable to match his pace, Seoryeong didn’t push him away. Instead, she pulled him closer, her fingertips brushing against the sharp contours of his shoulder blades.</p>
<p>Their bodies pressed together, moving as if beating with a single pulse.</p>
<p>After a brief yet intense kiss, Wooshin pulled back, his voice steady and firm. “You promised me.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong couldn’t tell if this promise was professional or personal.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I called you here for personal reasons—just wanted to hang out.”</p>
<p>The slightly clumsy accent was still clear enough to understand. Muttering to himself, the priest absently fiddled with the cross hanging around his neck, his eyes lazily opening and closing.</p>
<p>His gaze avoided the camera lens, lost in thought.</p>
<p><strong>Blast SA Headquarters.</strong></p>
<p>This mission wasn’t one of those routine assignments where female bodyguards were sent to Russia. The decision to specifically request the special security team struck Kang Taegon as unusually abrupt.</p>
<p>Still, given that this military firm had grown large on Russian investments, refusing their orders was never an option.</p>
<p>“How’s he doing?” Kang asked.</p>
<p>“Same as always,” Kia’s reply was curt, implying that his condition hadn’t improved in the slightest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he began spinning his chair in slow circles. “She had a husband, didn’t she? A husband…” he hummed faintly.</p>
<p>As his face disappeared and reappeared behind the chair’s back, his expression remained impassive, yet something feral rippled beneath the surface. “A husband…”</p>
<p>Was that part of a song lyric?</p>
<p>Mixed intermittently with Russian curses, Kia’s humming continued. His gaze remained stubbornly averted, refusing to settle on the person across from him.</p>
<p>“I heard you’ve lived in a monastery since you were very young.”</p>
<p>Perhaps that was why Kia seemed so fundamentally different from worldly people. He exuded an emptiness, like the hollow quiet of a temple, yet there were times when his explosive energy made you instinctively step back.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since they’d received their first request through Kia, who represented the Sakhalin branch, but even now, Kang Taegon couldn’t quite figure the young man out.</p>
<p>The one thing he did know was not to be deceived by that pale, delicate face. And that, beneath his devoutness, Kia occasionally displayed fanatic, even violent tendencies.</p>
<p>“Блять!”</p>
<p>Another curse erupted from Kia. His chair spun even faster, whirling furiously.</p>
<p>Then, in an instant, Kia’s far-off gaze snapped to the camera lens.</p>
<p>“If they were married, they must’ve had s*x, right?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The abruptness of his movement startled Kang Taegon, making him flinch. The chair came to an abrupt stop, and through the distortion of the lens, Kia’s features looked unnervingly twisted.</p>
<p>“What about here? Are the people who live here as serious about screwing as I am?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Are they as dedicated as me?”</p>
<p><em>Is he drunk?</em> Kang Taegon, baffled by the dissonance between Kia’s seemingly pious demeanor and his words, struggled to compose himself.</p>
<p>“это пиздец!”</p>
<p><em>What did that mean? Something obscene, probably.</em> Suppressing a cough, Kang Taegon quickly shifted to the matter at hand.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to worry about the arrangements here. Preparations for the second leader’s inauguration ceremony are proceeding as planned. But is it really necessary for <em>him</em> to come to Korea in person? If so, perhaps we should send the black-haired woman to meet him before the ceremony…”</p>
<p>Despite his words, Kia seemed indifferent.</p>
<p>“Ah—!”</p>
<p>Kang Taegon rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“The female bodyguard we were going to assign for that occasion has recently joined the special security team heading to Sakhalin.”</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong?”</p>
<p>Kia’s sharp response came with a scowl.</p>
<p>“Yes, Agent Han Seoryeong. But how did you—”</p>
<p>“Don’t call Sonya that.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“That name doesn’t suit her,” Kia said with a pout, his lips jutting out in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Kang Taegon hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to respond. But Kia simply grinned, lowering his head slightly as if closing the conversation.</p>
<p>“So, in the end, she was destined to meet her father after all. Sonya,” Kia murmured, crossing himself with one hand.</p>
<p>With a faint smile, he added, “By the way, make sure to create a whole new special security team.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Just worried you’d be upset if your company stops making money,” Kia said with a sly smile.</p>
<p>Kang Taegon frowned at the monitor, but Kia, unfazed, kissed the cross hanging from his neck.</p>
<p>“From God’s perspective, humans are like mist—here today, gone tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Then, with the end of the cross, Kia smashed the camera lens. The screen flickered with static before going completely black.</p>
