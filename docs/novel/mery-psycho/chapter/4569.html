            <p><strong>Chapter 166.2</strong></p>
<p>“Ugh… bitter.”</p>
<p>He scowled and downed a shot.</p>
<p>Just like that, the unofficial members of the Overseas Intelligence Division’s Team 1 vanished without a trace. Wonchang sat in a daze, poking at his now-cold gukbap (soup rice).</p>
<p>What am I even supposed to do in Team 1 now, with both the Chief and the Team Leader gone? The future looked bleak.</p>
<p>-Police arriving at the scene discovered the 32-year-old husband, Mr. Lee, collapsed from a gunshot wound. The Korean couple had traveled abroad for a simple ceremony at their honeymoon destination-</p>
<p>Wonchang absentmindedly lifted his head, then froze.</p>
<p>Taking up half the screen was none other than an Owl’s composite sketch.</p>
<p>Startled, he knocked over his soju glass.</p>
<p>-Authorities confirmed her escape from custody, and Interpol has launched a manhunt.</p>
<p>‘Why… Why is Owl an Interpol fugitive?!’</p>
<p>-Mr. Lee, the husband, was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery but remains unconscious in critical condition.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Wonchang grabbed his windbreaker and backpack in a frenzy and shot to his feet.</p>
<p>‘An unconscious Mr. Lee?’</p>
<p>‘If Owl really shot her husband, then that husband must be…’</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, the one who left the country with her!</p>
<p>Bowing repeatedly as he shoved past people.</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry!” He fought his way through the crowd.</p>
<p>How did things escalate like this right after the chief’s death?!</p>
<p>He checked the NIS ID in his pocket and immediately flagged down a taxi.</p>
<p>He needed to confirm Lee Wooshin’s condition, now.</p>
<p>“Incheon Airport!”</p>
<h3>***</h3>
<p>Every time he opened his eyes, Lee Wooshin saw flashes; operating room lights, an unfamiliar ceiling, the face of a foreign doctor.</p>
<p>The rattling wheels of a gurney, an oxygen mask pressing against his nose, a blurry field of vision.</p>
<p>A searing pain, like a red-hot iron rod, burned through his ribs. Beyond these fragmented sensations, he remembered nothing.</p>
<p>‘I was… dreaming of something…’</p>
<p>He had been a small boy, skating with his parents on a frozen lake.</p>
<p>His parents, arms wrapped around each other, spun in slow circles as if dancing a waltz. The little boy wasn’t afraid of the winter wind.</p>
<p>The lake had been his birthright, little Solzhenitsyn exploring every inch of the blue expanse.</p>
<p>“Yuri!”</p>
<p>From afar, his loving parents waved at him.</p>
<p>“Yuri! Don’t go too far, it’s dangerous!”</p>
<p>Scraping to a stop, the boy stared down at the mirror-like ice.</p>
<p>“Chief! Team Leader!”</p>
<p>Ah… Who was that?</p>
<p>Beyond the transparent ice, someone’s face appeared.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>A man who had tumbled off a long bench scrambled back up, blocking his view.</p>
<p>With great effort, Wooshin blinked his heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>A young man with a tearful face stared back at him.</p>
<p>“Team Leader, can you hear me?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Please wake up. It’s been a whole week!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You’re still listening to me, right?”</p>
<p>But the boy only tapped the ice with his skate. Tap. Tap. testing its surface.</p>
<p>“I tried looking for her myself, but there’s no trace.”</p>
<p>He clawed at his hair in frustration.</p>
<p>“The owl really vanished without a trace.”</p>
<p>Owl? The boy frowned, but a distant voice called.</p>
<p>“Yuri!”</p>
<p>He turned away without hesitation. His blades scraped sharply against the ice as he circled the lake once, twice, three times, four times.</p>
<p>Then, glancing down again, he saw the same man from before, now even gaunter, rubbing his tired eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s already been two months, Team Leader… You can’t keep sleeping like this. Interpol’s hit a dead end, and we’re way past the golden hour for tracking. Without witness reports, we’ve got nothing left. If this keeps up, we might never find her.”</p>
<p>“Quit the damn doom-talk!”</p>
<p>A girl he’d never seen before suddenly grabbed the young man by the collar. The boy narrowed his eyes, still fixed on the ice.</p>
<p>“They said her life isn’t in danger, so I oughta smash that thick skull of yours with a hammer!”</p>
<p>“Are you, are you insane?!”</p>
<p>“Who the hell asked you?! You think I’d let some sneaky spy bitch play around with unnie?”</p>
<p>‘I can hear the two fighting.’ The boy’s thoughts drifted hazily. His breathing grew faint, his eyelids heavier.</p>
<p>If he didn’t snap out of it now, the deep waters would drag him under again, but luckily, a biting gust of wind stung his cheeks.</p>
<p>“Yuri!” His father’s low, gentle voice echoed. The boy looked past the white birch forest toward the soaring spires of the winter castle in the distance.</p>
<p>It was time to return to the Solzhenitsyn estate.</p>
