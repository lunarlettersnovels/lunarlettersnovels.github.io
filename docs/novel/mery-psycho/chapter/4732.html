            <p><strong>Chapter 81.2</strong></p>
<p>“If you weren’t reliable, the training order wouldn’t have been issued.”</p>
<p>A man standing crookedly in front of the meeting table scowled. He wasn’t in a good mood either; his usual habitual smile had disappeared.</p>
<p>Seoryeong felt she understood why everyone was so tense. That morning, a temporary mobilization order had been issued for the new recruits.</p>
<p>It assigned them to security duty for the Korea-Mongolia Rare Earth MOU signing ceremony. Given their already busy schedules, pulling personnel for this event stirred quite a bit of resistance.</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong, what do you think? Our team’s next assignment is in Equatorial Guinea. Do you think you can follow me to a country that’s been under a dictator for over forty years?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong was about to respond when Wooshin cut in sharply.</p>
<p>“Even if she could, what basis do you have for saying so? Her only experience is from dealing with people she happened to run into, and even the company doesn’t seem satisfied with recruits like that.”</p>
<p>He rubbed his deeply furrowed brow as he spoke.</p>
<p>“That’s why she needs to start practicing staying on edge from now on. If you don’t want to make mistakes during expensive operations, it’s better to take the hits early. So, our team plans to send Agent Han Seoryeong out for training. Any objections?”</p>
<p>“The Instructor is right.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t a training camp. Stick to one title.”</p>
<p>At his sharp correction, Seoryeong flinched and nodded.</p>
<p>“The assignment is to the Rare Earth MOU signing ceremony. More specifically, the Mongolian Economic Development Director requested personal protection, but another team will handle that. The recruits will only be guarding the venue.”</p>
<p>Perfect! Seoryeong celebrated internally but maintained her impassive expression. This was a chance to get a firsthand look at how event security operated! Her hands resting on her knees clenched involuntarily.</p>
<p>“You should at least experience something normal once before you’re dragged into more troublesome cases.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin rubbed the back of his neck and tilted his head, looking tired.</p>
<p>“They said a senior has to accompany you during the guard training.”</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, Jin Hojae raised his hand high in the air.</p>
<p>“Team leader! I’m right here!”</p>
<p>“I’m too busy preparing for a business trip, so I can’t join.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s face twisted into a clear frown. Jin’s long arm kept waving back and forth, but he ignored him without even glancing in his direction.</p>
<p>“Then, for the senior who will accompany—”</p>
<p>“Team leader, it’s me!” Jin Hojae was adamant.</p>
<p>“—we need to decide.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of Agent Han Seoryeong and go with her!”</p>
<p>“Alright, Officer Ki Taemin.” Lee Wooshin dropped his pick.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Ki Taemin, who had been zoning out, snapped his head up, while Jin Hojae, who had half-risen from his seat, froze in place.</p>
<p>“Then it’s settled. Officer Ki Taemin will join.”</p>
<p>“Me?” Ki Taemin was lost and looked at Jin Hojae who said, “No, team leader! I was the one who raised my hand!”</p>
<p>“This concludes the briefing. Agent Han Seoryeong, listen to your senior. I’ll be at home, cooking.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>In an instant, all the officers’ gazes shot toward her. What did he just say? Their questioning eyes sparkled in unison.</p>
<p>Seoryeong flustered, turned toward Lee Wooshin, but he had already left the meeting room.</p>
<p>Thanks to the man who dropped a bomb and left, Seoryeong was stuck dealing with the seniors for quite a while.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After moving around for the first time in a while, she felt completely drained, as if she’d been through a spin cycle.</p>
<p>Returning from training, Seoryeong walked toward the unfamiliar sounds in her apartment. A savory and spicy aroma filled the air—someone was cooking soup.</p>
<p>Her dragging steps came to a sudden halt. It was the moment she saw a large figure moving skillfully around the kitchen.</p>
<p>Why did her legs freeze over something so trivial? Without a word, Seoryeong fixated on his back.</p>
<p>My husband must have looked and moved like that.</p>
<p>The image she had only imagined in her mind suddenly came to life so vividly.</p>
<p>She superimposed the neat, composed silhouette of her husband over Lee Wooshin.</p>
<p>Kim Hyun had been a foodie and could whip up even the most complicated Western dishes, ones whose names she could barely pronounce.</p>
<p>Never in her life did she think she’d have a chance to eat a warm, homemade meal from her family. That was something her husband, Kim Hyun, made possible.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Caught in her memories, she suddenly saw bright red blood drip onto the cutting board. It seemed he had cut something other than the ingredients. Gripping his finger tightly, he offered it out to her.</p>
<p>Startled, Seoryeong rushed over, only for Lee Wooshin to casually extend his bleeding finger with a calm smile.</p>
<p>“See? Knives are dangerous like this.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Only then did Seoryeong snap back to reality.</p>
<p>As if he would have trouble handling a knife, she scoffed.</p>
<p>His appearance suggested that if he raised his waistband or pant leg, you’d likely find something sharp—a hidden blade, perhaps. Even now, instead of setting down the kitchen knife, he held it firmly in his left hand.</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s gaze remained fixed on him, her expression cold and unyielding.</p>
