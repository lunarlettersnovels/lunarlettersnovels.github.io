            <p><strong>Chapter 72.2</strong></p>
<p>Outside, snowflakes were lightly falling. In the middle of the city center, the snowflakes blended into the lights, and the last heavy snowfall that covered the world in white seemed like a dream.</p>
<p>Ki Taemin and Jin Hojae left with their arms around each other’s shoulders, and Yoo Dawit moved to a secluded spot, shaking his cigarette case.</p>
<p>Han Seoryeong watched the team members’ departing figures with a blank expression. It had been fruitful, getting a rough sense of their backgrounds and personalities.</p>
<p>“Sigh.”</p>
<p>The weather was still cold enough that her breath came out in visible puffs. As she buttoned up her coat and started to walk, headlights suddenly blinded her.</p>
<p>It was a Jeep she hadn’t seen before. The vehicle, which looked like it was made for rough terrain, had a design that wandering soldiers would probably like.</p>
<p>The black window rolled down, and through the gap, Lee Wooshin looked up at her, raising his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Get in. It’s past midnight, and it’ll be hard to find a taxi.”</p>
<p>“You said we should drink responsibly and take care of ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Which is exactly what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>There was a strange tension in the air, but she opened the passenger door without hesitation. It was only right to make the most of a favor when there was nothing to lose.</p>
<p>As she sat down, she was met with a new scent—a mix of cologne and leather seats. The car was warm, the heater was on, and the seat was perfectly heated, making her relax. Feeling the alcohol hit her a bit more, Seoryeong fastened her seatbelt.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin smoothly turned the steering wheel and merged onto the road. Sometimes, he had an unpredictable scent. His skin scent would occasionally change, and his clothes carried a wide variety of smells.</p>
<p>She quietly watched the snow melt on the windshield but eventually couldn’t hold back and spoke up.</p>
<p>“But Instructor, aren’t you going without even using the GPS?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You didn’t even ask for my address.”</p>
<p>“Where do you live?”</p>
<p>He reacted a beat too late, but Seoryeong reached out first.</p>
<p>“I’ll press it myself” and Seoryeong put in her address.</p>
<p>The car quickly fell into silence. They didn’t exchange any words, both simply focusing on the open road ahead.</p>
<p>The wipers scraped across the windshield, and a soft pop song played on the radio. The warm air in the car made Seoryeong’s eyelids grow heavy. Just then, the man who had been staring straight ahead with a stern expression began to speak.</p>
<p>“I first met Jin Hojae ten years ago in the UDT.”</p>
<p>Through her slowly closing vision, she could see his emotionless face. The red taillights of the car in front of them cast an eerie glow over the leather.</p>
<p>“He was two classes below me, and I was struck by his face—it looked like he hadn’t been through a single hardship in his life. He was like a healthy, smooth pebble.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Every time I saw him, I noticed how well fed and well spoken he was. It seemed pathetic, but at the same time, I thought he was genuinely diligent. He was especially devoted to his comrades and loyal to his superiors.”</p>
<p>‘Is he bragging about his subordinate? But his deep, sunken voice didn’t match the content, making it feel out of place.’ Seoryeong soon started nodding off.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin glanced at her as she drifted off to sleep, then turned up the radio a bit and continued speaking.</p>
<p>“People who are genuine in every moment are useful once in a while. First, if their appearance is unremarkable, they don’t attract suspicion. Second, they can easily blend in with others.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“So I made sure to take a good look at that innocent face, the kind that probably grew up getting spanked by its parents. I watched, observed, and remembered. It’s much easier and more useful to mimic someone else than to draw on my own emotions.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“And that’s how Kim Hyun came to be.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin let out a short laugh, leaning his head back against the headrest.</p>
<p>“The original version of your husband was Jin Hojae, that bastard.”</p>
<p>His grip on the steering wheel loosened as he muttered under his breath, almost chewing on the words.</p>
<p>Seoryeong was sound asleep, her face peaceful. The navigation system’s loud announcement for a left turn grated on his nerves, so he turned it off and made a sharp right.</p>
<p>“Seoryeong, you’ve got an uncanny knack for spotting the real deal. It makes the fake feel insecure.”</p>
