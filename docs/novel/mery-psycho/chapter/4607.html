            <p><strong>Chapter 146.2</strong></p>
<p>“Did you put in the in-ear just to talk about this?”</p>
<p>–  Just a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’m really going in now.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong stopped in front of the door where Rigay was waiting, recalling the indoor layout.</p>
<p>– Seoryeong.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a lowered voice echoed in her ear.</p>
<p>– Just think of it as being underwater from now on.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>– Just hold your breath for exactly 5 minutes…</p>
<p>At the unexpected remark, she frowned.</p>
<p>–  Let’s see if you can keep your head down for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>“What does that mean…”</p>
<p>–  It’ll only be for a moment. Don’t look directly into Rigay Viktor’s eyes, just focus on the tips of the shoes I polished for you this morning.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>– Do you know how much I polished them to reflect only your face, Seoryeong?</p>
<p>She was at a loss for words at his childish persuasion. What on earth was he trying to do? Did Wooshin realize how absurd she found it? He let out a self-deprecating laugh.</p>
<p>– You’ll listen quietly if it’s an order from CEO Kang, right?</p>
<p>“Are you asking me to believe that?”</p>
<p>– Rigay Viktor is a person with many followers, knowingly or unknowingly. It’s a matter of etiquette not to stare directly at him, and since he’s already an unstable person, it means not to provoke him unnecessarily. Isn’t that right, Seoryeong?</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>–  Your superior isn’t someone who would joke around unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The voice asking, “Isn’t that so?” was quite cold. The personal information about the client hadn’t even been shared with her, who was in charge of close protection, yet for some reason, Wooshin seemed to know everything about him.</p>
<p>Could it be that, as CEO Kang Taegon feared, there was some involvement from the NIS? Seoryeong pursed her lips and glanced around unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was not noisy but subtly sharp. She observed the workers moving the altar for the event preparations and took a look at the faces of the newly installed workers.</p>
<p>– Don’t show that old man your pretty eyes; just wait.</p>
<p>Seoryeong let out a hollow laugh that felt out of place.</p>
<p>– I’ll come over there.</p>
<p>His firm voice seemed to constrict her chest. However, there were parts of Wooshin’s words that she simply couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to ask, the thick arched door opened, and a man who appeared to be a foreigner scanned her. He briefly focused on her neatly tied black hair before stepping aside.</p>
<p>As she stepped inside, treading on the plush carpet, the first thing that caught her eye was a white ceremonial robe. The wide sleeves of the garment hung majestically, resembling a traditional royal robe, and sunlight streamed in behind it.</p>
<p>The well-built man guided her deeper inside and knocked on the door. She unconsciously strained to listen, but only the silence of a dead mouse returned.</p>
<p>The foreigner shrugged as if he were familiar with the situation and creaked open the large door. He suddenly handed her the sunglasses he had tucked in his pocket.</p>
<p>–  Lower your eyes.</p>
<p>It was a command that pressed down on the back of her neck. Her pride was greatly wounded, but the moment she heard that voice, she instinctively bowed her head and began to look only at the tips of her shoes.</p>
<p>The room was completely darkened, with not a single ray of light coming in. Someone was sitting in a chair with their back turned.</p>
<p>Seoryeong slowly shifted her gaze from the person’s feet. In comparison to the spacious room that resembled an auditorium, the person hunched over looked incredibly small.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The unappealingly thin ankles, the spine jutting out sharply up to the neck, and the hair that was growing back like fresh green grass. The head, bent as if heavy, appeared desperate, and the skin that was slightly exposed was dark and mottled.</p>
<p>It felt as if someone had entered her space, yet whether they were unaware or simply ignoring it, they did not feel like a living person.</p>
<p>– Seoryeong, answer me.</p>
<p>At the anxious voice, Seoryeong merely tapped her ear. Looking around, she was relieved to see that there were no sharp objects in sight.</p>
<p>Seoryeong swallowed hard again and took a step closer to the man who was buried like a swamp. She didn’t know what was going on, but she had been told that Wooshin would be coming soon.</p>
<p>As she was absentmindedly glancing at her wristwatch, she threw a glance at the man’s hunched back. At that moment, she locked eyes with him, as his twisted neck suddenly turned to look at her.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>In that instant, her body stiffened. Only then did she understand why the foreign man had handed her the sunglasses.</p>
<p>It was a horrific sight. It seemed that the scars, which had not healed properly, were solidified, not just a result of a few stabs.</p>
<p>Taking a quick breath, Seoryeong pressed the in-ear and whispered. A cold shiver ran down her spine.</p>
<p>“Instructor, this person… doesn’t have eyes…”</p>
