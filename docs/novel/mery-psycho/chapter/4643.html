            <p><strong>Chapter 127.1</strong></p>
<p>Like a rookie experiencing their first kiss, their lips merely pressed together. The warm and soft sensation sent her heart racing, pounding as if trying to escape her chest.</p>
<p>A cold sweat ran down Seoryeong’s back, perhaps from the sudden tension during the brief moment.</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes, the man in front of her, cheeks stiffer and redder than usual, stared at her without so much as a blink.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Pretending not to notice, Seoryeong closed her eyes again and leaned further into his lap, pressing her upper body closer. Tilting her head, she aligned her lips with his, this time more fully.</p>
<p>Though clumsy, she brushed her lower lip against his, tasting him lightly, like savoring melting ice cream.</p>
<p>The thought that she was making an irreversible mistake flickered through her mind, but she clenched her eyes shut, determined not to stop.</p>
<p>The man remained frozen, unmoving as if paralyzed. Yet his soft lips gave way under her touch, yielding like snow being stepped on.</p>
<p>She wasn’t sure if the breath tickling her philtrum belonged to him or to the spring breeze. Slowly, their lightly pressed lips separated.</p>
<p>“So, is today another day you can afford to waste?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s brows twitched slightly, but he stayed frozen. Feeling embarrassed by his lack of response, Seoryeong sat upright.</p>
<p>His face betrayed no expression, yet his sharp gaze clung to her every move with an unsettling intensity. Intimidated by his persistent stare, she added a small excuse.</p>
<p>“I figured you wouldn’t like cake.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah. I don’t.”</p>
<p>Releasing a breath he seemed to have been holding, Wooshin let out a crooked smile, his expression resembling someone who had just received a love confession.</p>
<p>Feeling a sudden wave of discomfort in the atmosphere, Seoryeong shifted her body to create some distance. However, before she could fully retreat, an overwhelming force pulled her back, nearly spinning her head as her waist was seized.</p>
<p>She was promptly dragged onto his firm thigh, and Wooshin wasted no time pulling her down by the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>The sunlight poured down warmly on them. Wooshin’s lips trembled, as if he might cry, but instead, he kissed her deeply.</p>
<p>Caught off guard, Seoryeong’s eyes flew open, and she saw him closing his with an almost irritated expression. His lips parted, and his hot tongue invaded her mouth.</p>
<p>“Mm, mmph…”</p>
<p>The air around them turned charged, sending a shiver down her spine. Through the connection of their lips, she felt the storm of his emotions.</p>
<p>Without resistance, she parted her lips. His firm lips sucked on her tongue, twisting at an angle before capturing hers again. Wet sounds of him sucking and tasting her lips echoed sensually.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his rough thumb pressed firmly against the nape of her neck, holding her in place.</p>
<p>“Wooshin wait, just— mmph!”</p>
<p>She tried to push his shoulders away while speaking in broken syllables, but he was relentless. Even when their lips momentarily parted, he rubbed his nose against hers before diving back in.</p>
<p>His aggressive, consuming kisses left no time for her to indulge in the dreamy warmth of the spring breeze. At this rate, things might spiral out of control.</p>
<p>“Mm, mmph…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Get a hold of— mmph, woosh…”</p>
<p>Wooshin silenced her protests by firmly gripping her face, leaving her with no choice but to gasp for air. Her entire body flushed crimson, heat radiating intensely.</p>
<p>He adjusted the angle of the kiss again, devouring her lips with unrestrained intensity. She could feel her tender skin swelling and tingling, but he didn’t let up, continuing to bite and lick as the sound of their ragged breathing and shared heat consumed the moment.</p>
<p>If this continued, she feared she’d be swept up completely. Filled with dread that pressed against her chest, Seoryeong abruptly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Right then, she noticed a group of children, like fledgling sparrows, clustered nearby and watching them curiously.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong shoved Wooshin away with all her might and stood up. The force sent his wheelchair rolling backward several times.</p>
<p>As their lips abruptly parted, Seoryeong exhaled a shaky breath, while Wooshin leaned forward persistently, making a loud smacking sound as if reluctant to let her go.</p>
<p>“…Why are you stealing my cake?” he teased.</p>
<p>“It’s not like that…”</p>
<p>Seoryeong, blushing all the way to her collarbone, subtly gestured with her chin. Wooshin licked his damp lips and followed her gaze.</p>
<p>There, a group of young children clutched a ball and giggled mischievously. Letting out a soft laugh, Wooshin lazily slung one arm over the back of his wheelchair.</p>
<p>“Hey, kids, come here for a second,” he called with a casual wave of his hand.</p>
<p>The children, with innocent faces free of suspicion, ran over eagerly.</p>
