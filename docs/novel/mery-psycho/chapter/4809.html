            <p><strong>Chapter 42.1</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong climbed the stairs alongside the men, crawling on all fours until they reached the roof door. They stretched out under the sun, letting the red medicine and their shared tears dry. Exhausted, they collapsed onto the bed, their bodies marked by stains of sweat and effort.</p>
<p>Even the guy who boasted about his time on the national team and the former professional athletes had long abandoned the training. They had left early, scoffing at the idea of enduring five straight hours of intense physical exertion, relinquishing their ranks before departing.</p>
<p>On some days, they were tasked with tirelessly stacking rice bags or bricks, only to break them down and stack them again.</p>
<p>It dawned on them that the instructors’ goal was to wear them down, to test their resolve and resilience.</p>
<p>After a week of such a grueling routine, even those who used to grumble about trivial matters fell silent, their faces etched with concern.</p>
<p>Their hate for each other, particularly for Seoryeong, dissipated, and they became humble. After training, even the energy to squabble needlessly and stress over small things was gone.</p>
<p>Ironically, more and more guys approached Seoryeong, who meticulously wrapped bandages and applied ointment, asking for favors.</p>
<p>“What is this? Am I setting up a hospital or what?”</p>
<p>Of course, some ungrateful trainees still complained to her persistently.</p>
<p>“Whoa… whoa… whoa… be careful.”</p>
<p>The morning of the third week was no different. They were out for their morning run.</p>
<p>Once again, her breath filled up her throat, and it stung between her ribs as if a needle was stuck between them. When the moment of wanting to give up came, Seoryeong gradually compromised with herself.</p>
<p>If she barely reached the first kilometer, she’d make it to the second. The secret was to never stop amidst everything.</p>
<p>She kept increasing her goal distance, and when she reached it, she increased it again.</p>
<p>But no matter how much she compromised with herself, her throat was burning like a sore thumb, and breathing in and out was painful like swallowing pins and needles.</p>
<p>“–!”</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew past her. Her eyes widened, and she looked around. A stale odor brushed against her flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>What… was it? Where was it? Clearly, unmistakably…!</p>
<p>She could smell Kim Hyun’s scent from somewhere.</p>
<p>This time it was real. It wasn’t perfume or fabric softener. Just the most blatant body odor that only comes from sweat. It was the raw, hormonal odor that often accompanied sex with Kim Hyun.</p>
<p>Seoryeong kept looking around nervously, but no matter how wide she squinted, she couldn’t see anything but her panting, sour teammates.</p>
<p>Then her eyes fell on the instructor running ahead of her. She was exhausted, and for a moment she thought that she might be mistaken, but the scent was too clear.</p>
<p>It was cool, even if it was an illusion. The blood rushed through her veins, and she couldn’t help but recognize it.</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth and ran over to him, tugging at his clothes.</p>
<p>“Uhhh……!”</p>
<p>She locked eyes with the instructor, who stopped dead in his tracks.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>The tall, swarthy-looking man looked at her questioningly. He was copper-skinned and vaguely familiar, a member of the special security team.</p>
<p>Excuse me, but if I ask if I can stick my nose in that sweaty spot, I’ll be labeled a lunatic.</p>
<p>Seoryeong opened her mouth to speak but shook her head. Instead, she stared deeply into the man’s face. From eye to nose, nose to mouth. He looked so strong and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Seoryeong started comparing the man’s features to Kim Hyun’s, like someone with a syndrome. What did Kim Hyun look like compared to this?</p>
<p>Kim Hyun looked just like she’d always pictured him. She used to trace her husband’s face with her fingertips.</p>
<p>Kim Hyun’s eyes weren’t exactly like that without double eyelids, his nose didn’t stick up like that, and his jaw was more angular. Lee Wooshin surely looked different from him.</p>
<p>He must have been popular with adults and children, and women probably liked him a lot in the sports world.</p>
<p>The instructor in front of her kept overlapping with Kim Hyun in her mind. Seoryeong pursed her split lips like someone finally found an oasis after aimlessly running through the desert.</p>
<p>But there shouldn’t be NIS agents here. Well, still, let’s confirm the voice first. How did my husband’s voice sound? It was a bit husky. Kim Hyun may have blinded my eyes, but he didn’t make me deaf.</p>
