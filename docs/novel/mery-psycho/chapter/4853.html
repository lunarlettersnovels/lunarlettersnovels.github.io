            <p><strong>Chapter 18</strong></p>
<p>Of course, he thought she would be hurt and that she would have questions too.</p>
<p>But she, being kind and accustomed to enduring hardships, believed that Lee Wooshin would simply resent Kim Hyun and return to her life.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin frowned as Seoryeong winced from the pain of the burning hot water.</p>
<p>Despite this, she attempted to escape to North Korea. Lee Wooshin’s expression remained impassive as he found her increasing obsession rather peculiar. Na Wonchang, sensing the possibility of impending reprimand, swiftly changed the subject.</p>
<p>– Thankfully, she was only fined.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>– After that, I should’ve kept track of where she was going, but there was no order… So I left it as it is. It was my fault. I’m sorry.</p>
<p>But nothing had changed whether the owl was here or not. If there was one iron clad rule for him, it was that the operation that was finished should not be impacting the new one.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin rubbed his shoulder. He felt a bit better.</p>
<p>As he realized the situation, his uncertainty disappeared. Wonchang said cheerfully.</p>
<p>– You won’t be running into her much…! You’re in a different department and she didn’t even recognize you! Owl has no other interest to anyone other than Kim Hyun so that’s great!</p>
<p>His eyebrows flinched. It felt like something really bothered him but it went by him so fast that he didn’t know what it was. Anyways, Lee Wooshin needed more information on the owl.</p>
<p>“Investigate.”</p>
<p>– Yes!</p>
<p><em>About what she was thinking, what her current situation is, what her mental state is, how she was handling her husband’s situation.</em></p>
<p>A simple investigation wouldn’t be enough to get all this.</p>
<p>“I’ll just have to get rid of her from my sight.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“A disgusting feeling leaves a longer mark than a good feeling,” Seoryeong mused to herself as she diced carrots in the kitchen. Despite having plenty on her mind already, thoughts of that moment with Lee Wooshin kept intruding.</p>
<p>His body, with its strange tattoo and thick, flaccid penis, seemed to linger in her thoughts like an unwelcome guest. Seoryeong tried to push the memory aside, focusing instead on peeling carrots, but it proved difficult.</p>
<p>Was it because she had been blind for so long? She hadn’t expected the visual shock to leave such a lasting impression.</p>
<p>And his calm yet rude demeanor, the way he spoke—it grated on her nerves. She peeled faster, trying to distract herself.</p>
<p>Then, abruptly, her hand stopped, and she let out a low sigh of frustration.</p>
<p><em>His… </em>was also curved!</p>
<p>Her late realization made her face harden.</p>
<p>It looked like his erect p*nis was curved upward a little…</p>
<p>Kim Hyun was embarrassed about the shape of his penis. How the end of his was curved up like a hook. She remembered vividly.</p>
<p>Her heart dropped.</p>
<p>“Seoryeong…!”</p>
<p>The cook called her.</p>
<p>“Sorry but could you do me a favor? You’re the only one available.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong put down the carrot.</p>
<p>“It’s thirty in total. You just have to deliver it to the factory.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“There will be a car waiting by the front gate. Our employee will meet you when you get to the factory.”</p>
<p>The cook made sure to tell her while putting it in the bag.</p>
<p>“There’s a protest going on there so you have to get out as quickly as you can.”</p>
<p>As she got out with two bags full of lunch boxes, there was a car waiting like the cook said.</p>
<p>As the trunk opened automatically, she put the bag in. Then she tried to open the door but it wouldn’t open.</p>
<p>Usually they would put the employee all together… She kept on pulling but it wouldn’t open. This driver didn’t seem too keen.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to bother so she just opened the door to the front seat. Thankfully it opened but her face hardened. She tried to calm down as she went in.</p>
<p>“Where’s your mask?”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>She flinched as she heard a soft yet low toned voice.</p>
<p>As she turned, she saw the carrot she was holding, no, the man there. That man with a tattoo on his penis.</p>
<p>He leaned his elbow on the wheel and asked calmly. His eyes were black this time instead of grey.</p>
<p>“… What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“I have business here. Do we just have to go to the factory?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Or should we go somewhere else?”</p>
<p>As Seoryoeng froze in the midst of closing the door, he came calmly. He closed the door, then ordered her to wear a belt.</p>
<p>“I turned the car on.”</p>
<p>He said as he started pulling the car. <em>Who asked…</em> Seoryeong scoffed inside.</p>
<p>As the man was wearing a black cap, there was a shade on top of his hat. He seemed like a cheerful person, but his face said otherwise.</p>
<p><em>Ah…! I knew he looked familiar….</em></p>
<p>“Do you recognize who I am?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>As she answered without hesitating, he asked in an odd face.</p>
<p>“Who am I?”</p>
<p>“…. That new person in the special security force.”</p>
<p>“… Ah—“</p>
<p>He fixed his cap.</p>
<p>He looked like a student but his top clearly showed that he was a soldier.</p>
<p><em>Just don’t talk to me…</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
