            <p><strong>Chapter 46.2</strong></p>
<p>His cold gaze pierced her like an accusation, as did her momentary reversal. Seeing his displeasure, Han Seoryeong rose to her feet, unmoved.</p>
<p>“The military combat technique I’ll be teaching you is Krav Maga.”</p>
<p>Instructor Lee Wooshin said as he personally removed Seong Wookchan’s protective gear. Indifferent, he casually tossed the equipment he collected onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Because it’s a combat style based on instinctive reflexes, the better your intuition and reflexes, the faster you’ll learn. Regardless of age, gender, or fitness level, anyone can excel.”</p>
<p>His meaningful gaze brushed past Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“Moreover, it’s said that you can subdue an opponent armed with a gun with your bare hands―”</p>
<p>Abruptly, he pulled a pistol from his waist, completing the cocking motion with a click.</p>
<p>“Let’s hear my gun, shall we?”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>And then, unexpectedly, he handed the gun to the bewildered Seong Wookchan. The sequence of events—being kicked in the head, having his protective gear removed, and then being handed a gun—seemed to leave him baffled.</p>
<p>Standing awkwardly, he froze as Instructor Lee Wooshin lightly slapped his cheek with a smile.</p>
<p>“Well then, Seong Wookchan, aim and shoot.”</p>
<p>As if it were the most natural thing in the world, everyone just blinked at what had transpired. As Seong Wookchan hesitantly raised the gun, the instructor continued his explanation and swiftly knocked his arm aside.</p>
<p>“After dodging or blocking the opponent’s attack, then―”</p>
<p>The gun Seong Wookchan had let slip fell near Seoryeong’s feet.</p>
<p>From that moment on, Lee Wooshin began to relentlessly pummel him.</p>
<p>He kicked his abdomen, twisted his arm, and brought his fist down all the way to Seong Wookchan’s chin, who could only groan in response, unable to resist in the slightest.</p>
<p>“Key target points include the eyes, nose, chin, and throat―”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>With each instruction from Lee Wooshin, a blow landed precisely on those areas.</p>
<p>“Here’s your pressure point,” he said.</p>
<p>“Ack…!”</p>
<p>“These are the vulnerable spots that, if struck right, could kill. Memorize them.”</p>
<p>Blood dripped from Seong Wookchan’s nose. The men were speechless and straightened their backs at the strange atmosphere.</p>
<p>At this point, Wookchan realized that he was being used as a human punching bag and stiffened. Lee Wooshin didn’t seem to mind and continued the lesson with the same bored and flustered expression as the first time.</p>
<p>“Most techniques are arranged to inflict the greatest damage on the opponent. For example, striking the chin with the elbow.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, d*mn!”</p>
<p>“The back of the neck, the throat, the abdomen.”</p>
<p>“Urk…!”</p>
<p>“Using combat boots to target the bones below the ribcage.”</p>
<p>Thud! The sound of fierce blows echoed relentlessly throughout the training ground.</p>
<p>Seong Wookchan finally collapsed, one arm and leg trembling, while Lee Wooshin, unperturbed, casually loosened his collar. Stepping over his fallen opponent, he walked towards Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“Krav Maga is more about technique than strength.”</p>
<p>His penetrating gaze fixed squarely on Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“Got it?”</p>
<p>For a moment, she felt an unknown emotion scrape across her chest. The tips of her fingers burned subtly as if she had cut them somewhere before the training began.</p>
<p>“The moral of the story is, don’t go down easy just because you’re facing a big guy. If the need arises, stab him with whatever you can, whether it’s a ballpoint pen or your finger.”</p>
<p>At the same time, he picked up the fallen gun and shoved the butt of it against Seoryeong’s forehead. She instinctively stiffened at the cold touch.</p>
<p>After watching her flinch, he squeezed the trigger, a twisted grimace appearing on her expressionless face.</p>
<p>“–!”</p>
<p>But instead of a gunshot, it was a transparent soap bubble that leaked out.</p>
<p>Seryeong blinked rapidly and let out the breath he had been holding. Realising she had been tricked, she knit her eyebrows together and glared at him, but Lee Wooshin quickly turned his back to the others and began talking to them.</p>
<p>A soap bubble floating in the air hit her forehead and popped. She frowned and wiped her slippery forehead with her palm, over and over again.</p>
<p>Throughout the session, she continued to spar relentlessly, exchanging blows in a blur of motion. Amidst the chaos, she quickly forgot the fleeting feeling she had experienced earlier.</p>
<p>And as expected, that night, she was ambushed again and plunged into the sea without a moment’s notice.</p>
