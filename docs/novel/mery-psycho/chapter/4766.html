            <p><strong>Chapter 64.1</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong quickly wrapped his wrists with a wire snare. However, the man soon regained his senses, brushed off her hands, and gripped her wrist firmly, almost scolding her.</p>
<p>“Trying to burn your instructor’s face off?”</p>
<p>He showed no fear of the fire creeping from the branches toward his ear, only wearing a sinister smile.</p>
<p>He alternated his gaze between her calm demeanor and the bloodied Seong Wookchan, then pressed his tongue against the inside of his cheek as if he had finally figured out what was happening.</p>
<p>“Why do you go around with other people’s blood on you, you filthy thing.”</p>
<p>As he reached for her face, Seoryeong swung her dagger at him. Lee Wooshin dodged easily, and she aimed the heavy blade at his vital spots again.</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows, showing mild surprise, but a satisfied smile spread across his lips.</p>
<p>“Even a student should be dutiful. Our Han Seoryeong is quite the filial child.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“It makes my teaching worthwhile.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong gritted her teeth to hide her anxiety. With the burning cover still on him, she ducked to avoid the smoke. She aimed for his wrist again, striking his groin with her elbow, but Lee Wooshin pushed her away with a kick to her shoulder.</p>
<p>She quickly got up and punched at his abdomen. He blocked with his forearm, and they repeated this exchange several times.</p>
<p>She used everything she had learned to continue her assault, but he dodged each strike with growing ease.</p>
<p>As her frustration grew, she extended her leg for a roundhouse kick.</p>
<p>“Still, we should put out the fire together.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Instead, he caught her ankle, and her head hit the cold snow.</p>
<p>The sharp chill snapped her back to attention, and she immediately swung the snare she was holding. Although he dodged quickly, it grazed his lips, leaving a slight cut. Lee Wooshin lightly licked the swelling wound with his tongue.</p>
<p>“When did you say my face was precious, and now you keep roughing me up?”</p>
<p>“You used to say my face was too good to waste, so why are you defiling it now?”</p>
<p><em>“Ugh…!”</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, his rock-hard thigh trapped her right groin, immobilizing her. She tried to twist her body sideways, digging her nails into the snow to escape, but his dominant position didn’t budge.</p>
<p>Flames continued to consume the straw-wrapped cover on his shoulder. Far from being extinguished by the snow, the fire flared up with every gust of wind.</p>
<p>The cover he wore was now burning even more fiercely.</p>
<p>“Come on! What are you doing without taking that off first!” Seoryeong shouted urgently, worried that the sparks might land on her.</p>
<p>“I thought Han Seoryeong was so worried about her instructor that she set the fire herself.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Why waste it, it’s cold, it’s good.”</p>
<p>“Hair, watch your hair!” Seoryeong screamed in alarm. She scooped up handfuls of snow and flung them wildly, aiming for the flames but hitting his head repeatedly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the falling sparks began to land on her winter clothes.</p>
<p>Clicking his tongue, Lee Wooshin finally removed the burning cover and buried it upside down in the snow. Seoryeong watched the flames gradually die out and finally relaxed her tense shoulders.</p>
<p>“So, where did you learn such bad habits?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the man tightened his grip on her leg with his thigh.</p>
<p><em>“Ugh…!”</em></p>
<p>It felt like being bitten by a wild animal. Her lower body was squeezed so tightly that blood couldn’t circulate.</p>
<p>“This instructor never taught you to play with fire using a matchbox.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Where did you pick up such a crude trick?”</p>
<p>Enduring the pain, Seoryeong bit her lip. She felt ridiculous, trapped between his thighs. But resisting further would only destroy her knees.</p>
<p>“Are you not going to answer me, Han Seoryeong?”</p>
<p><em>“Ugh…!”</em></p>
<p>“What kind of filthy bastard taught you this?”</p>
<p>“Alone, damn it. Just alone.”</p>
<p>She whispered through the pain, but Lee Wooshin didn’t believe her. He tightened his grip even more, making it hard for her to breathe.</p>
<p>“If you had the brains to make a fake rescue request, you should have targeted it properly. What are you proud of when you only half-provoked your instructor?”</p>
