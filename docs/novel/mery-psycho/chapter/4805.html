            <p><strong>Chapter 44.1</strong></p>
<p>-They’ll put pressure on you, and since we can’t intervene, you’ll be pushed around by your rank. They might bring the Owl to their trips in Russia.”</p>
<p>St. Petersburg, Russia… He stroked his hardened cheek.</p>
<p>“Do you know what CEO Kang Taegon is doing in Russia?”</p>
<p>“No, there’s only airport records, and the trip details aren’t left on paper.”</p>
<p>“…For now, good work.”</p>
<p>Despite his resolve not to worry further, his mind quickly became complicated again. His already low voice sank even deeper as if soaked in a puddle. Just as he was about to end the communication,</p>
<p>“Excuse me, sir…! But is the owl safe? She hasn’t been hurt during training, has she?”</p>
<p>The worry dripping from the voice made him sweep his mouth several times. Hurt? Safe? Lee Wooshin took a deep breath and then replied calmly.</p>
<p>“She’s unharmed, which is the problem.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect the owl to refuse to give up like this.”</p>
<p>A gloomy voice came through the earpiece.</p>
<p>“The owl’s need for a special security team is undoubtedly because of Kim Hyun, right? The commission fee is expensive, and the special team doesn’t take contracts under $300,000. So, is she trying to do it herself? What does she think she’ll accomplish by joining the agency?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“And really, does the owl not recognize you, sir? Even though she’s mingling right there?”</p>
<p>He pressed down hard on his sudden irritation.</p>
<p>This damn fool. He clenched his eyes shut as if to suppress his anger. Unaware of his superior’s tightly controlled breathing, Wanchang was once again lost in his own thoughts.</p>
<p>-Is it because your face is so different from Kim Hyun’s that I can’t even recognize you? Well, since you’re the one who said that all five senses should be different for the other person! You’ve gained muscle mass this time, haven’t you? And this is just my opinion”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>-Wasn’t it the case that Owl only fell madly in love with types like Kim Hyun?</p>
<p>Hearing that, Lee Wooshin didn’t even bother to reply, but grabbed his in-ear piece and pulled it out.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>“There’s no shame in that.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s voice was barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>Land training or water training, both were grim options, but one thing was for sure. On land, if you’re not feeling well, all you can do is vomit, but in the water…….</p>
<p>“Shit, but I still pooped.” The man said embarassed. He couldn’t look at her in the eye.</p>
<p>“No one saw it.” Han Seoryeong sounded like she was soothing a baby.</p>
<p>“You saw it, you…”</p>
<p>“I see it every day at the nursing home I used to work at.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Everybody does it, they rub it on the walls, it’s nothing special.”</p>
<p>“Please stop.”</p>
<p>An underwater color assessment required them to descend to 7 meters, tie a knot, and climb back up while holding on to a single nozzle.</p>
<p>Many crew members pass out or have blackouts along the way, but today, one of them came up with a little poop in his pants, causing a short wait.</p>
<p>Seoryeong was the first person to witness the moment, and she was also the first paramedic to quickly rush the panicked man into the shower.</p>
<p>“It’s because the pressure suddenly changed.”</p>
<p>It would be a shame if he abandoned the training out of shame because this poor, beaten-to-death man was alternating last place with Seoryeong, and she needed him to be under her to survive.</p>
<p>So, she had to ensure he couldn’t quit. She couldn’t let him leave, or else she’d end up at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>“I’ll gaslight him if I have to…”</p>
<p>“All excretions are valuable.”</p>
<p>“Please just stop…”</p>
<p>“It’s really important for health. And you should be proud of your digestive system. Of course, it would have been best if it was disposed of in the right way. Normally, shit belongs in the toilet…”</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth already!”</p>
<p>“Anyway, why would someone who shits as desperately as you run away?”</p>
<p>The man, almost mashing his face with dry hands, choked up.</p>
<p>“You need to get your objective straight.”</p>
<p>“F*ck.”</p>
<p>“You’re not gonna quit, are you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not quitting!”</p>
<p>Finally, Seoryeong nodded in relief and shut up. Once she heard what she wanted to hear, her face became indifferent, as if she had never acted friendly.</p>
