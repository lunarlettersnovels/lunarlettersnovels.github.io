            <p><strong>Chapter 81.1</strong></p>
<p>The long-awaited first day of work had finally arrived.</p>
<p>Han Seoryeong reached the Blast Agency and, with slightly stiff steps, entered the elevator. It felt like just yesterday when people called her “madam” and “the cleaning lady” as she came and went.</p>
<p>Straightening her clothes, Seoryeong pressed the button for the 15th floor.</p>
<p>From observing him for a few days, she was relieved that Lee Wooshin wasn’t as difficult as she feared. Unlike the training camp where he was constantly yawning, he now woke up early every day for jogging or weight training. He didn’t leave the house in disarray either.</p>
<p>Though being a team leader seemed busier than expected—he left in the morning and often returned late at night—it wasn’t hard to find traces of his presence.</p>
<p>A damp towel, a washed cup turned upside down, the heater turned up. And by coincidence or not, the once-empty fridge was now stocked with fruits she liked, along with more snacks.</p>
<p>Reaching for a bottle of water, Seoryeong paused. A funny thought crossed her mind—it finally felt like a home where people actually lived.</p>
<p>“―!”</p>
<p>Her train of thought broke suddenly.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>The smoothly ascending elevator suddenly jolted and came to a stop. Startled by the stronger-than-expected vibrations, Seoryeong grabbed the handrail inside.</p>
<p>The soft hum of the machinery abruptly ceased, and the interior lights went out completely.</p>
<p>“Wha–!”</p>
<p>Her breath grew heavy with panic. She immediately pressed the emergency call button, but there was no response. Everything felt like it had gone dead.</p>
<p>She pulled out her phone but hesitated. Could she really call 911 in such a high-security military agency without causing a stir? Maybe it was better to wait.</p>
<p>Or maybe call someone.</p>
<p>The only person that came to mind was Instructor Lee Wooshin.</p>
<p>“Sigh!”</p>
<p>Frowning, she paced the small space, only to feel herself lose balance again.</p>
<p>“―!”</p>
<p>The elevator started moving again. However, instead of stopping at the 15th floor, it kept ascending—16, 17, 18, 19. It showed no signs of stopping as it raced upward.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>The speed increased noticeably, causing her face to turn pale. Before she knew it, the elevator had shot past the 30th floor, climbing straight to the top.</p>
<p>Feeling nauseous, she bit her lip and stared at the rapidly changing numbers on the panel.</p>
<p>“Phew!”</p>
<p>There’s no way it’ll break through the ceiling, right? Even with a malfunction, the building still has a set number of floors. It’ll stop somewhere, right? She forced herself to think optimistically, swallowing her nerves.</p>
<p>Finally, the elevator came to a stop. But it wasn’t even on the top floor. It had risen much higher than where the buttons indicated, only for the doors to slowly open.</p>
<p>Through the gap stepped a middle-aged man, impeccably dressed—polished shoes, sharply pressed suit trousers, and a jacket slung over his shoulder. He leaned calmly on a cane as he entered.</p>
<p>“You look well. How have you been?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>It was only then that Seoryeong began to understand. This wasn’t some random malfunction.</p>
<p>She bowed her head slightly in greeting, and CEO Kang Taegon pressed the door-close button. However, the elevator remained completely still. Seoryeong furrowed her brow.</p>
<p>It was clear now—she had been deliberately brought up here during the CEO’s transit time. As if to confirm her suspicion, he checked his wristwatch and muttered, “I’ve only got a minute.”</p>
<p>“You really did join the Special Security Team.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“So, does what you said back then still hold? You wanted to take down a high-ranking official in the National Intelligence Service.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s expressionless face turned toward him. Whatever he read in her eyes made him suddenly burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“In that case, you should see it through, shouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong was too stunned to speak.</p>
<p>“Of course, you can’t act as a member of the Special Security Team, and there can’t be any evidence linking Blast Agency to the incident. If something goes wrong, the company will deny any involvement, but I, Kang Taegon, want to help you personally.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure that’s okay?”</p>
<p>“Well, it will be tricky, of course.”</p>
<p>Kang Taegon rubbed his chin and smiled. The wrinkles around his eyes deepened.</p>
<p>“But I feel like this is something I should do for you. I believe you’ll become a very valuable asset in the future.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong had no such intention, but for now, she kept quiet.</p>
<p>“The National Intelligence Service holds a quantum-resistant cryptography conference every year, and the Blast Agency is in charge of facility security. I don’t know which official you’re after, but the Deputy Director will give the keynote address from the stage.”</p>
<p>Finally, the elevator began its normal descent.</p>
<p>“But you’ll have less than thirty minutes from entry to exit. Can you pull it off?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“No, no way! How can you send Agent Han Seoryeong there alone!”</p>
<p>Jin Hojae, who had been holding dumbbells, slammed them down loudly as he raised his voice.</p>
<p>The Special Security Team office had one wall completely covered with various pieces of information. Photos of locations, buildings, and individuals pinned with tacks, maps, operational boards covered with arrows, and even models replicating geographical features of various countries filled the room.</p>
<p>The conference room was overwhelmed with confidential tasks and strategies, making it visually chaotic.</p>
<p>It had been an arduous journey to get here. Even the simple elevator had given them trouble!</p>
<p>As Seoryeong glanced around in awe, Lee Wooshin slammed his hand on the desk.</p>
<p>His gaze bored into none other than Seoryeong.<a href="https://www.patreon.com/join/lunarise?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2Fposts%2Fcompiled-table-26211714"></a></p>
