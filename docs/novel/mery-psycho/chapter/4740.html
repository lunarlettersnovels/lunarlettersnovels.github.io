            <p><strong>Chapter 77.1</strong></p>
<p>The coat he threw landed precisely on top of the vomit that Seoryeong had left unattended.</p>
<p>She began to wonder whether she should feel insulted by what she just heard or more embarrassed by the mess she had shown.</p>
<p>“When the instructor told you not to resist, you freaked out. But when your husband spouts nonsense, you’re all for it?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin pushed her shoulder lightly as he spoke. The sofa armrest caught her knee, causing her to topple over. The man climbed on top of her like a beast, grabbing her chin.</p>
<p>Their bodies were tightly pressed together, heavy and rigid. Before she could even clench her fist in the disadvantaged position, Lee Wooshin sat heavily on her thighs and pelvis.</p>
<p>His expressionless face was somehow twisted with frustration.</p>
<p>“If you’re so obedient, why not be like that with me?”</p>
<p>The grip on her chin hurt as if it would crush her bones. When she tried to pull away, his fingers suddenly forced their way into her mouth.</p>
<p>Her lips were pried open, and Seoryeong blinked in confusion. His greasy fingers pressed down on her tongue, massaging the roof of her mouth. As the slippery fingers slid over her ridged mucous membranes, Seoryeong involuntarily tilted her head back.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Would his next target be her eye sockets? She remembered an agent being tortured with oil. Seoryeong glared fiercely at the man in front of her, scratching and clawing at his forearms and hands. As if to subdue her further, his hot palm pressed firmly against her stomach.</p>
<p>Sensing danger, she bit down on his fingers as if she would sever them, but the man didn’t budge. He only frowned slightly and then stroked her nape with gentle, almost soothing motions.</p>
<p>He had the expression of someone who had just been playfully bitten by a dog.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>As his fingers continued to probe her soft flesh, her mouth filled with saliva. She tried desperately to hold back a strange sense of gasping, but her lips parted weakly.</p>
<p>A peculiar and tantalizing sensation crept in. With every movement of his thick fingers, pulling her tongue and touching behind her teeth, her breathing grew warmer.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, his gaze distant and aloof, looked down at her mouth and chin, now dirtied by saliva.</p>
<p>Their eyes met, and within his gaze, a whirlwind of emotions raged. For a brief moment, Seoryeong held her breath.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Instructor!”</p>
<p>Just as his fingers probed deeper, touching her uvula, she shook her head, grimacing. It felt like her insides were being stirred, and she was about to retch. Yet, he merely mumbled in a calm voice, “It’s swollen.”</p>
<p>“What were you thinking trying to suck with a mouth like this?”</p>
<p>The man suddenly halted all movement and stared at her swollen gums and raw, injured flesh.</p>
<p>Then, as if regaining his composure, he swiftly rose, donning his instructor’s mantle once again.</p>
<p>“Where’s the first-aid kit?”</p>
<p>She gasped and stared at his back. The forced break in the atmosphere only heightened the heat. Her chest heaved in confusion.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to get entangled in a messy affair with you, Instructor.”</p>
<p>“It’s already too late.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like confusing relationships.”</p>
<p>“Strange reasoning. Do you consider your boss as part of your family tree?”</p>
<p>“No, but you see, I have a family.”</p>
<p>Ah―Lee Wooshin hummed low as if it didn’t matter to him. He stared quietly at his saliva-covered fingers before grabbing a rag to wipe off the vomit. His actions were so fluid as if part of a natural flow.</p>
<p>Watching him kneel and silently clean the floor, she felt her mouth suddenly go dry.</p>
<p>What’s with this man?</p>
<p>The thought that she absolutely could not lose him began to fill her mind.</p>
<p>They have a queer relationship where showing the inside of her mouth wasn’t even embarrassing. She had never been able to do that with her husband, always pretending to be shy.</p>
<p>With that, the pressure that had been weighing down on her pelvis and stomach started to ache, and her heart began to beat shallowly.</p>
<p>Ah! Is this what they call camaraderie? Maybe.</p>
<p>Startled, she quickly shook her head and shrugged her thoughts off.</p>
<p>“You’re turning me into some woman sneaking around behind her husband’s back, and you think wiping the floor is enough to fix it?”</p>
<p>“I believe you were the first one trying to sneak around, Agent Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Do you not remember those promiscuous notes?”</p>
<p>Even as he said this, Lee Wooshin barely glanced at her.</p>
<p>“When oil spills in the kitchen, use paper towels or newspapers first. If it’s still slippery, use dish soap… Ha… Can you even manage this on your own?”</p>
<p>He continued in a nagging tone before sighing midway, rubbing the back of his neck.</p>
<p>“You’re a real handful, Ms. Han. Do you know that?”</p>
