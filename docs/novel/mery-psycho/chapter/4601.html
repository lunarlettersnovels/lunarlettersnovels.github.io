            <p><strong>Chapter 150.1</strong></p>
<p>‘I married an agent? Me? Married to an agent? And I was planning to do it again! Damn bastard agent. They’re all the same!’</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s eyes flashed with fury as she lunged forward, as if leaping out of a coffin. But her still-numb body staggered, sending her crashing into his arms. Lee Wooshin, his face pale, reflexively reached out.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>A now-familiar scent flooded her sensitive nostrils. Ever since he had stopped wearing cologne, Lee Wooshin’s skin always carried the same smell.</p>
<p>But even as her mind reeled, Seoryeong bit down hard on her tongue. If she couldn’t control her emotions now, every resolution she had made until this point would become worthless scraps of paper.</p>
<p>Though Sonya’s freshly awakened memories dominated her thoughts, the betrayal from her husband was just as vivid.</p>
<p>‘Pull yourself together, Sonya. You’ve always beaten agents before. This is just another fight.’</p>
<p>She deftly shifted the topic.</p>
<p>“Joo Seolheon, I saw her, the deputy director! She’s the one who put me here!”</p>
<p>“It’s alright now. It’s me. Breathe slowly.”</p>
<p>“That deputy director…she’s the one who—!”</p>
<p>“Shhh, calm down. You’ve had quite a shock.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin rubbed her back, but her cheek against his felt unnaturally cold.</p>
<p>“As you saw, the NIS is involved now. We should get out of here as soon as—”</p>
<p>He stopped mid-sentence.</p>
<p>“Spit it out.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin frowned, pulling back and holding out his hand.</p>
<p>“Don’t swallow it, spit it out, Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>Had she bitten down too hard? The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth. Unable to swallow the saliva mixed with blood, she held it in her mouth until the man, catching the scent, cupped her chin.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her nose stung. Without realizing it, Seoryeong spat out the blood and squeezed her eyes shut.</p>
<p>“That woman… she’s using my face… my face!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s fingers slipped into her mouth. His sharp eyes narrowed as he examined the bitten spot, still gripping her jaw. Clicking his tongue, he hauled her fully out of the coffin.</p>
<p>“If you can’t walk, get on my back. We need to leave now.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“The situation isn’t normal.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong hurriedly closed the coffin lid, an instinctive move to keep Lee Woo-shin from seeing Rigay’s eye case. He set her down on the floor and spoke urgently.</p>
<p>“Getting tangled with the NIS here won’t do us any good. Didn’t you hear? He Channa’s frantically burning computers. Blast Agency is being raided right now.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Special Security Team is under investigation too, and the NIS has swarmed Daegyo Church. If we get caught, we’ll be stuck in interrogation for days. Then we’ll miss our flight.”</p>
<p>“My earpiece… I don’t have it.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong fumbled at her empty ear with stiff, wooden fingers.</p>
<p>“The Orthodox Church event has been postponed as of now. CEO Kang already gave the order, and the security teams are pulling out. We shouldn’t linger either. We need to head to the airport. Is the antidote helping at all?”</p>
<p>“What about Rigay Viktor?” As he moved to carry her, she blurted out in panic, “The client is in danger.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I told you. Joo Seolheon was wearing my face!”</p>
<p>“…,”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about raids or whatever. But why would Deputy Director Joo Seolheon disguise herself as a bodyguard? To get close to the target, that’s why! Out of all these people, I was assigned to Rigay!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s voice rose with an inexplicable urgency. Truthfully, she barely remembered anything about Rigay, except right before escaping Winter Castle.</p>
<p>But that hollow-eyed, self-mutilated wreck of a man… The broken person who had tried to kill himself over and over, she felt like she needed to see him. Just once.</p>
<p>If Rigay really is that man from back then… what happened to the other children in Sakhalin?</p>
<p>And Kia…</p>
<p>The moment Kia came to mind, her little finger throbbed as if remembering on its own.</p>
<p>‘If we parted ways at ten, he should’ve forgotten the past by now. So why is he still stuck in that Sakhalin monastery? Staying there would only bring back terrible memories.’</p>
<p>An indescribable mix of sorrow and rage welled up in her chest.</p>
<p>Just then, her shoulder hit the wall, and her distracted lips were swallowed.</p>
<p>“Seoryeong, you’re doing it again.”</p>
<p>“Ngh!”</p>
<p>“I call your name, and you don’t answer. You just keep turning things over in that head of yours.”</p>
<p>Even as she turned away from the unwanted kiss, his lips chased hers relentlessly. Forced open, her mouth yielded as his tongue pushed in, dominating all the way to her throat.</p>
<p>His eyes held a dangerous glint. Lee Wooshin licked up every last trace of blood in her mouth, his tongue moving with deliberate force. Then, tilting his head down to her eye level, he murmured coldly:</p>
<p>“You haven’t even looked at me properly since earlier. At this rate, I’ll seem like some shameless bastard forcing himself on a woman who doesn’t want him. You were the one who proposed to me first, you brat.”</p>
