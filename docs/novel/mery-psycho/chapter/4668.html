            <p><strong>Chapter 114.2</strong></p>
<p>“Yes, more, more!”</p>
<p>Her pleading voice ignited revulsion. The rapid thrusts caused her body to sway uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin squeezed his eyes shut from that point on. The veins on his jaw bulged as he clenched his teeth, barely holding it together.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ha, ah!”</p>
<p>The relentless force rattled the creaky old bed. The priest yanked her hips closer, spreading her thighs wider as Seoryeong let out a mix of groans and anguished sighs.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ahh!”</p>
<p>Kia continued to knead her calves, his hand delving into her tender flesh. Each time her intimate depths were invaded, Wooshin’s face crumbled, his teeth grinding. He swore to himself—no, he vowed—that he wouldn’t let her be taken. Not like this.</p>
<p>“Ah, there, yes, ah!”</p>
<p>He etched her gasps into his shattered heart. If it came to this, he thought, he could neither let her go nor let her be taken. The words became an obsessive chant in his mind.</p>
<p>His entire body strained under the effort to endure, blood vessels bursting in his reddened eyes, and the coppery taste of blood filled his mouth. Then, suddenly, he met her pained yet smiling gaze.</p>
<p>“I’ll burn it all. Every trace of you. Until nothing’s left.”</p>
<p>As the head of the intruder’s manhood rammed into her inner walls once again—</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>The scene before him shattered like glass, replaced by darkness.</p>
<p>“Haah!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin bolted awake, dodging instinctively. A knife plunged into his pillow with a dull thud. Breathing heavily, he rolled to the side, only to hear laughter coming from the shadows.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Masukaмаска? Did you have a nightmare?”</p>
<p>It was all a dream.</p>
<p>And the real nightmare was happening to him now.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A chill ran through his mind. Hearing his codename spoken, Wooshin had only one thought: this intruder must die.</p>
<p>No other options existed. He reached for the silenced pistol by his bedside and pulled the trigger without hesitation.</p>
<p>Damn it. Even thinking about the dream made his skin crawl. It was revolting in every conceivable way. Drinking a bowlful of filth couldn’t compare to the sheer disgust he felt.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Wooshin barely managed to shake off the lingering sleep. Damn it, damn it! Profanities spilled from his lips, mingling with his ragged breaths.</p>
<p>An overwhelming surge of emotion gripped him, so intense he wanted to tear his own mind apart.</p>
<p>The silenced shot hissed through the air, but Kia ducked swiftly, lunging with a shoulder tackle that sent the bullet into the ceiling. The lightbulb shattered, shards raining down like jagged stars.</p>
<p>The cold sweat clinging to Wooshin’s spine had to be the aftermath of the nightmare. It felt as if he had glimpsed a moment of his own downfall—his secrets exposed. She had twisted herself into self-destruction, clinging to anyone, no matter who they were.</p>
<p>If he wanted to stop the same nightmare from repeating, he had to deal with the source. It was obvious: he had to kill that bastard.</p>
<p>Neither hesitated as they drew their blades and clashed instantly.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>The scrape of steel meeting steel echoed in the room, a sound as chilling as it was visceral. Locked in a struggle, both men gritted their teeth, muscles straining against one another.</p>
<p>Seoryeong, Wooshin thought amidst the chaos, can we ever live as an ordinary man and woman?</p>
<p>I will make it happen. No matter what.</p>
<p>Despite his blurry vision, he reached for his gun again and took aim. Kia reacted instantly, throwing a pillow to deflect the barrel’s trajectory.</p>
<p>Crash! Bang! The room descended into chaos. Chairs toppled, fists flew, and relentless strikes aimed at vital points rained down.</p>
<p>Neither wasted a second, swinging arms and blades with precision. They struck at jaws, eardrums, and necks without hesitation.</p>
<p>Yet every thrust met resistance, every plunge was dodged, and their bodies slammed into walls with resounding thuds. There wasn’t a single moment to let their guard down as heavy blows came from every blind spot.</p>
<p>In a swift move, the man landed a series of punches to Kia’s jaw, driving him into the desk. Seizing whatever was within reach, he grabbed a power cord and wrapped it tightly around Kia’s neck.</p>
<p>“So you really have gray eyes, young master.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Kiya grinned and licked his lips.</p>
<p>“I wanted to check those eyes. Don’t you remember?”</p>
