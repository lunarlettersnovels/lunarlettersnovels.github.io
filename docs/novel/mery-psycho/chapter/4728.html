            <p><strong>Chapter 83.2</strong></p>
<p>“If some shady guy approaches, just smack him with the baton.”</p>
<p>Ki Taemin handed her the baton and a portable radio with a disinterested expression.</p>
<p>Dressed in a matching pantsuit, durable belt, and a buckle that wouldn’t come loose easily—following the instructions for attire—she was finally ready for her first field assignment.</p>
<p>The venue was the Seoul Hotel’s business center, where a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding rare earth supply between Korea and Mongolia was to be signed.</p>
<p>Unlike the chaotic night when everything had spiraled out of control, Seoryeong’s appearance was perfectly composed, not a hair out of place.</p>
<p>“When you extend the baton, remember to keep your elbow tucked under your arm, then release it.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Keep your palm open, hook your thumb properly through the leather straP But don’t grip it too tightly. Only squeeze hard when you strike, then release immediately.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Let me check your stance. Hold the baton.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong shuddered as an unexpected flash of memory surged through her. Suspicious eyes glanced in her direction.</p>
<p>Since that night, Seoryeong had made sure to lock her bedroom door at night, and Lee Wooshin had been too busy with work to come home often.</p>
<p>She felt relieved but couldn’t shake the uneasiness stirring in her chest, causing her to wake up earlier and more frequently in the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p>“Did you already check the area? If you need to move positions or something happens, report it through your earpiece first.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>She parted ways with Ki Taemin and moved on.</p>
<p>Inside the event venue, bomb detectors were in use, and X-ray machines scanned the bodies of government officials as they entered.</p>
<p>Beyond that, constant surveillance was happening behind the scenes, including video monitoring, vibration detection, and ultrasonic detection. Seoryeong adjusted her stance while awkwardly tapping her earpiece.</p>
<p>Time seemed to pass without any issues. Ki Taemin remained mostly hidden, likely due to his sniper-like tendencies, while Seoryeong quietly observed the movements of the veteran security personnel.</p>
<p>“Thirty minutes, right? The time the deputy director entered and left the venue–”</p>
<p>Seoryeong was mulling over Kang Taegon’s information when an older woman approached her with a troubled expression.</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>The woman’s face showed clear discomfort as she gestured towards the women’s restroom.</p>
<p>“I heard some strange noises coming from the ladies’ room. Could you check it out?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong followed the woman’s pointed finger. While unsure of the specifics, the woman’s uneasy expression was obvious. Pressing the button on her earpiece, Seoryeong started walking.</p>
<p>“Senior, I’ve been told there are strange noises coming from the women’s restroom. I’m going to check it out.”</p>
<p>—”Got it.”</p>
<p>As she pushed open the restroom door, the sound hit her.</p>
<p>“Ah! Haah! Haaa!”</p>
<p>Her face twisted immediately. Seoryeong could only imagine that her expression mirrored the older woman’s.</p>
<p>“Hnng, ahhh!”</p>
<p>She quickly closed the door behind her to muffle the heated moans. Standing before the most suspicious stall, she knocked on the door.</p>
<p>“Excuse me. We’ve received a complaint.”</p>
<p>“Haaa!”</p>
<p>The sounds persisted. Slapping noises of flesh meeting flesh continued relentlessly.</p>
<p>Whoever was inside was clearly overwhelmed, with wet, rhythmic sounds growing more intense as something—likely their groin—was slammed repeatedly.</p>
<p>Yet only one person was making all the noise. The other remained silent, breathing quietly, almost as if they weren’t there. Seoryeong clenched her fist and knocked again.</p>
<p>“Lower the noise, please. And if you can, hurry up and finish.”</p>
<p>“Hng! Hnng!”</p>
<p>“Before you embarrass yourselves, get out quickly.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a rough-looking hand gripped the top of the stall, and the door began shaking violently.</p>
<p>The woman’s body banged against the door, while the man’s hand holding the stall’s support tightened, his knuckles turning white.</p>
<p>Is this guy doing this on purpose now?</p>
<p>Furrowing her brow, Seoryeong checked her watch. The escalating moans reached their peak before dissolving into uneven breaths. Just as she raised her hand to knock again—</p>
<p>Thud! Without warning, the door swung open, and a tall man in a black clerical robe silently walked out.</p>
<p>*<em>A priest?</em>*</p>
<p>Startled by the unexpected sight, Seoryeong took a step back. The tall man paid her no mind and headed straight for the sink.</p>
<p>Inside the stall, a hotel staff woman lay sprawled, half-dressed, flashing a sheepish smile as if embarrassed by the situation.</p>
<p>The man who had just left the restroom calmly washed his hands, entirely unbothered. His clothing was immaculate, with only the small cross behind his neck giving away any signs of disturbance.</p>
<p>What a mess! Swallowing a bitter laugh, Seoryeong closed the stall door.</p>
<p>Her eyes met the man’s through the mirror. No, he was staring directly at her—intensely.</p>
<p>His movements were slow as he washed his hands, but his gaze remained fixed on her with fierce focus.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>His hair was a dark brown, and his black eyes were striking. His hair, thick like a lion’s mane, covered his ears and neck.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the religious garb, or perhaps the way his hair framed his face, but there was something melancholic about him. If not for what had just occurred, Seoryeong might have thought he gave off a rather ascetic impression.</p>
<p>Their eyes locked for a moment in a quiet, searching exchange. Then, with a suddenly blank expression, the man turned without shutting off the water.</p>
<p>One step, two steps… As he approached, a strong, lingering scent surrounded him.</p>
<p>“Sonya?”</p>
<p>The voice sounded like someone who had just seen a ghost. He looked Korean, yet he was speaking a foreign language. Feeling a strange sense of caution, Seoryeong glared at him, and the stranger repeated himself.</p>
<p>“Sonya?”</p>
