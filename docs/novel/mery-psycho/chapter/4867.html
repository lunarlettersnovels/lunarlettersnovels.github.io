            <p><strong>Chapter 9.1</strong></p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>In the end, Seoryeong gritted her teeth and sharply turned the steering wheel again. With a screech, the rear wheels slid, and a sharp noise pierced her eardrums.</p>
<p>Crossing the centerline and turning back to the south, she deliberately stepped on the iron plates embedded in the road. Bang! Bang! The sound of the tires bursting was tearfully welcome.</p>
<p>Only then did a dim light start to approach rapidly. When she collided with the blinding headlights to the point where she couldn’t open her eyes, the tension in her body relaxed.</p>
<p>Soldiers who quickly got out of a jeep began surrounding the SUV, aiming their rifles.</p>
<p>“Pull her out, pull her out!”</p>
<p>“Driver of Gyeonggi 3714, you are under emergency arrest!”</p>
<p>Finally, her palm, soaked with sweat, dropped from the steering wheel. The car with the burst tire could no longer move, and Seoryeong quietly unlocked the doors. As she did, rough hands forcefully pulled her out.</p>
<p>She waited as if she expected it, willingly lying face down on the bonnet as she was being taken away. Even with her arms twisted, she couldn’t help but say these words.</p>
<p>“Why are you so late…?”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Two men in suits entered the interrogation room.</p>
<p>Since regaining her eyesight, she had developed a habit of automatically associating people with Kim Hyun. Comparing height, physique, skin texture, eye shapes, lip shapes, etc., it was a habit born out of both anticipation and suspicion.</p>
<p>The two men who just entered both had sharp facial features and were wearing glasses. Despite the relentless interrogation, Seoryeong coldly scrutinized them with a posture that didn’t crumble.</p>
<p>She was caught by the military, handed over to the police, and during the investigation on charges of violating the National Security Act, a considerable gap preceded their arrival.</p>
<p>They were personnel from the National Intelligence Service.</p>
<p>Instinctively, her back straightened.</p>
<p>“I’m from the National Intelligence Service Counterintelligence Division.”</p>
<p>Her head, which had been heavy, finally seemed to clear up.</p>
<p>“You’ve probably already heard, but Han Seoryeong is charged with violating the National Security Act and damaging military facilities. She rushed to the Unification Bridge, passed through the South Gate without permission, and went near the North Gate. She stormed the military facilities. Is that correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Alright, you’ve admitted that part.”</p>
<p>With a very bureaucratic tone, a thick document quietly changed hands.</p>
<p>“Until the investigation is complete, all nearby facilities will be closed. Soldiers are being dispatched now for search and it’s causing quite a stir. This place is quite a famous tourist attraction, but now all group tours are stopped because of Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>“That’s convenient.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“There was a soldier who collapsed and fainted. Wouldn’t it be better for him to be admitted peacefully rather than dealing with all this fuss?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Squinted eyes sharply turned towards her.</p>
<p>Standing indifferently in a situation where one should feel sorry or embarrassed. It was a persistent issue Seoryeong had experienced since childhood.</p>
<p>Even now, it wasn’t much different from back then. Rather than feeling sorry, it was more of a regret.</p>
<p>“Ms. Han Seoryeong, it would be wise to choose your words carefully. The National Security Act stipulates punishment even for attempts. Every statement you make will have a significant impact on whether charges will be filed.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“What was the motive behind attempting to defect to the North?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong didn’t blink. The NIS agent raised his glasses slightly and pressed his nose.</p>
<p>“Let me change the question. Who is Kim Hyun?”</p>
<p>Her mouth twitched as if she had been waiting for this moment.</p>
<p>“In the police interrogation, she responded only with Kim Hyun like a parrot and then remained silent.”</p>
<p>“He’s my husband.”</p>
<p>“No, according to the documents, Han Seoryeong is single.”</p>
<p>“We lived together in a common-law marriage for two years.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>The two bewildered agents exchanged strange glances. Seoryeong chewed on the inside of her lips, soothing the bitter taste of her mouth.</p>
<p>It was ironically amusing how the time that meant everything to her could become so miserable.</p>
<p>“The man who Han Seoryeong claimed to have disappeared was also Kim Hyun, right? Is this correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Is he the reason behind the motive to defect to the North?”</p>
<p>It was a welcome question. There was no need to remain silent anymore. Seoryeong quickly brought forth the words she had been memorizing in her mind. The bluffing was about to begin.</p>
<p>“He is the Chairman of the National Defense Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People’s Army, the great leader of the people.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>Instantly, the atmosphere froze, and the cold gazes fixated on her.</p>
<p>Seoryeong lowered her rigid upper body and met the eyes of the agents more intensely. The table was scratched briskly with her nails.</p>
<p>“I had a hard time memorizing it too. Originally, I thought about reporting him as a spy, but I don’t know his real name or face. It seems like I set up a household with a spy.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“So, would you consider looking into it yourselves, sir?”</p>
<p>The corners of her mouth stretched eerily as she looked at them in the eye.</p>
<p>She didn’t blink, didn’t breathe, just observed their reactions with an animalistic intensity.</p>
<p>Despite her calm demeanor, the fierce gaze wasn’t concealed. As the ticking of the clock echoed, she once again spoke.</p>
<p>“It’s true that the defector was the missing Kim Hyun. If we let him go like this, it could be a big problem. We don’t know what harm he could cause to the country, so the government should step in and apprehend him.”</p>
<p>At that moment, a phone rang somewhere. The man, who had been quietly listening, suddenly reached into his pocket and answered, saying, “Yes, Director.” Seoryeong never took her eyes off him.</p>
<p><em>Director, Director… If it was the Director, then it meant a rank directly below the head of the National Intelligence Service.</em></p>
<p>He responded with yes repeatedly on the phone, occasionally glancing at Seoryeong.</p>
<p>After finishing the call, the man sighed heavily, rubbed his temples, and then tapped his companion’s shoulder, gesturing towards the door.</p>
<p>Both of them stood up simultaneously. Seoryeong couldn’t comprehend what was happening or how things were unfolding.</p>
<p>“Well, it seems the investigation is done for now.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>Her face twisted into a frown. What was going on? The initiative had clearly shifted in her favor.</p>
