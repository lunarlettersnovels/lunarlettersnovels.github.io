            <p><strong>Chapter 144.2</strong></p>
<p>It was a series of days of white flashes in front of her eyes, and memories flooding back.</p>
<p>‘Haa…. Stop…! I’m hungry….’</p>
<p>Once her brain turned to mush, she could no longer think. She became like a child, only able to say simple words like hungry, sleepy, and needing to use the bathroom.</p>
<p>“Ugh!</p>
<p>He entered her at a desperate pace. ‘Do you want to go?’ Lee Wooshin asked sweetly, not even bothering to stop his wild pistoning. The wet flesh was desperately trying to bind her.</p>
<p>“Do you really want to marry this instructor?”</p>
<p>“What the h*ll, how many times have you asked me! Ugh, huh…!</p>
<p>“Think carefully before you answer. If you marry me, there’s no divorce. There will never be such a thing.”</p>
<p>The heat of the room was overwhelming. She moaned and closed her eyes as the throbbing length filling her slender body to the brim. The oneness with him was almost painful.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh…!</p>
<p>Even when he was pulled out, her entrance refused to close. She was crushed against the bedroom window, her butt*cks laid across the kitchen table, and then back in bed.</p>
<p>“Ha…!</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin cried out as he pulled up one of her thighs and pushed it upward. Her nipples were swollen to the point of raw flesh, and her limbs were flailing weakly.</p>
<p>Still, her folds clenched tightly, the overwhelming pleasure still there. He pounded against the owl as if to mark his territory.</p>
<p>Each time, Seoryeong had other ideas.</p>
<p>‘Where should I go next?’</p>
<p>It was at times like this that she realized she was an orphan with no ties. She heard that the island of Hwaido is famous for its trees and music, so maybe there’s a sanatorium there? Or maybe we should go to a completely remote countryside.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking, Seoryeong?”</p>
<p>“Eh, ugh!”</p>
<p>“Why do you pay less attention to the groom?” He panted at every thrust.</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>“You asked me to marry you first, and I’m trying to answer you.”</p>
<p>He plunged in deeply and came all the way in at once. With each thrust, her head went white. He caressed her body as he did so.</p>
<p>“When do you want the date?</p>
<p>“Just as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Where do you want to honeymoon?</p>
<p>“Mexico, El Salvador, Cuba…”</p>
<p>“Those are all dangerous countries.</p>
<p>“So good, ugh!”</p>
<p>Later, the area between her legs became red and raw, stinging with pain every time she walked. When she could no longer walk properly, he finally reduced his greedy indulgence by half.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Kang’s tap on the armrest snapped her back to the past few days.</p>
<p>“Just what on earth are you two–! I’m asking what this resignation letter is all about?”</p>
<p>Kang Taegon looked at the two of them in disbelief. Seoryeong held out a white envelope, looking leaner than she had in days.</p>
<p>There was no point in staying in this business now that she had actually found Kim Hyun and had him by her side.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Kim. I shouldn’t have come all the way to your office, but my instructor…”</p>
<p>“I’m here because I need authorization too.” Wooshin also took out his resignation letter from his inner pocket. He shrugged, saying that was why he had no choice but to come along.</p>
<p>“Team Leader Lee, what is this…”</p>
<p>“I’ll finish the remaining assignments and then leave.”</p>
<p>Kang Taegon frowned as if he had a headache. He gulped down the steaming tea and set the cup down with a clatter.</p>
<p>“Unless our company is truly cursed, why is the special security team in such disarray?!” Kang Taegon shouted, and glared at Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, I think you owe me a favor.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>She could only bow her head in silence. It was a stigma. A rumor that when Han Seoryeong was sent on a mission, the success rate was almost zero.</p>
<p>The venue for the post-quantum cryptography event, the Sakhalin request, and even the Equatorial Guinea cargo ship incident—all had the same outcome.</p>
<p>On top of that, with all the crew members on this cargo ship going missing and the goods being completely seized, Blast Agency suffered immense losses.</p>
<p>The company employees joked that it felt like a curse, but the rumor twisted into whispers that Han Seoryeong herself might be the source of that “curse.”</p>
<p>Since she had indeed used Blast Agency for her own purposes, Seoryeong had no defense, even if it killed her. Fortunately, Kang Tae-gon didn’t press further. He merely reminded her of their last request.</p>
<p>“I trust you remember what I said last time.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I do.”</p>
<p>Terrorist—that’s what he had called him.</p>
<p>Recalling the VIP client with the unusual background, Seoryeong spoke the name aloud.</p>
<p>“Rigay Viktor.”</p>
<p>Clang.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin accidentally knocked over a teacup with his knee. Hot liquid spilled down, but the sudden chill in his demeanor was far more striking.</p>
<p>He stared at Seoryeong’s lips as if he couldn’t believe she had actually spoken the name.</p>
<p>The tension in his hardened gaze made his shock almost audible.</p>
