            <p><strong>Chapter 128.1</strong></p>
<p>“I want you to handle their protocol and security,” Kang Taegon continued.</p>
<p>“Is this person a woman?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>So, it’s a man. Female bodyguards were usually assigned to women, specific client requests, or cases where a woman’s presence could help de-escalate tension.</p>
<p>But assigning a female bodyguard to a male client… Seoryeong cast him a skeptical look.</p>
<p>“Is there a particular reason why I have to take on this assignment?”</p>
<p>“Because the conditions for accommodating him are extremely specific,” Kang Taegon replied gravely.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the client has significant mental health issues.”</p>
<p>As he continued speaking, Seoryeong’s expression turned strange, as if she’d swallowed something rotten. Something about this felt off. Memories of meeting Kia in Sakhalin loomed large in her mind, and after experiencing a mission that had nearly dismantled her team, she found herself hesitant to blindly accept any task, even one assigned by the company.</p>
<p>Kang Taegon sipped his amber drink, choosing his words carefully, yet he locked eyes with her, his voice dipping as though he were divulging a secret.</p>
<p>“Everyone once believed he would change the world’s power dynamics, but…”</p>
<p>With a hardened expression, he silently turned his glass in his hands.</p>
<p>“His once-brilliant mind was completely destroyed.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If he had wanted, he could’ve had it all—money, power, everything. But he was too fragile. Severe depression led to multiple suicide attempts.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Hearing the mysterious client’s story, Seoryeong felt herself tensing involuntarily.</p>
<p>“His first act of defiance was refusing to eat. If locked in solitary confinement, he would bang his head against the walls. If restrained to a bed, he’d bite his own tongue. His followers did everything they could to save him from his relentless attempts at suicide.”</p>
<p>Kang Taegon’s heavy gaze seemed to reflect the long, arduous history tied to this individual.</p>
<p>“But nothing worked, and eventually, they resorted to electroconvulsive therapy.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s brows furrowed deeply. During her time working in a care facility, she had heard that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) could help patients with severe depression. It was particularly effective for elderly patients who suffered from delirium, anorexia, and repetitive self-harm. However, she also knew the risks—months’ worth of memories could vanish as a side effect if things went wrong.</p>
<p>“The treatment didn’t work.”</p>
<p>Kang Taegon sighed and leaned heavily against the sofa.</p>
<p>“He still wants to die. He’s become a fool who doesn’t even remember his own name.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong stifled a sigh.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the treatment didn’t seem voluntary. Or maybe it was the mention of his “followers.” Whatever the reason, the more she heard about this so-called VIP, the heavier the weight in her chest grew.</p>
<p>The thought of bringing someone described as a “fool” to Korea felt ominous.</p>
<p>Was this really just a simple protection detail, or was there another agenda at play?</p>
<p>“But despite everything, this man… reacts violently to anyone who gets close. He has seizures and throws anything within reach. Strangely, though, he seems to calm down around black-haired women.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know why, but I’ve been told that when he’s with young, strong, black-haired women, he sometimes reveals fragments of his memories—bit by bit.”</p>
<p>A flicker of something unreadable crossed Kang Taegon’s dry gaze.</p>
<p>“Your job would be to prevent unnecessary self-harm and gradually break through his defenses. As he speaks, collect those fragmented stories and relay them to us. Those stories are incredibly valuable—and expensive—for us.”</p>
<p>“Who exactly is this person?”</p>
<p>In response, Kang Taegon drained his glass in one gulp, raising the empty glass in a mock toast.</p>
<p>“A terrorist trapped in his past.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong felt a dull ache pulse through her head. Drug lord protection, a cult leader, and now a brain-damaged terrorist as a client—it seemed her assignments grew more extreme with each passing mission.</p>
<p>The initial shock faded quickly, though. Now that she understood what Kang Taegon wanted, she spoke without hesitation, refusing to fall into yet another trap.</p>
<p>“Aren’t there plenty of female bodyguards besides me?”</p>
<p>But Kang Taegon only smiled faintly without giving any response.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>No matter how many times he called, Han Seoryeong still wouldn’t answer.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin sat leaning against the bed, gripping his nearly dead phone tightly. The sharp smell of alcohol being poured over his injured foot stung his nose.</p>
<p>“―”</p>
<p>Seoryeong had said she was just going to the restroom, but then she disappeared without another word. While he could intellectually understand that she had left out of confusion, the longer he waited without her return, the more it felt like all the blood in his body was draining away.</p>
<p>He knew she needed time, but the anxiety gnawed at him unbearably.</p>
<p>Even a brief gap felt maddeningly unsettling, leaving his mouth dry.</p>
<p>All he could think about was holding her until she couldn’t escape, kissing her endlessly, stripping away every layer of her defenses. These unruly thoughts burned through his entire body.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>He sighed through gritted teeth, causing the nurse changing his sterile gauze to flinch.</p>
<p>“Sir, are you in a lot of pain?”</p>
<p>“This is killing me.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“Tie me up so I can’t take a single step.”</p>
