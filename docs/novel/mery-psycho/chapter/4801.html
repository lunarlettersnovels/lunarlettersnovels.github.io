            <p><strong>Chapter 46.1</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong was quickly punched in the stomach, and as she spun around, a second kick came in. It was as if he’d trained professionally in boxing, and his jab and leg kicks were exquisite.</p>
<p>She immediately raised her elbows and assumed a defensive stance, but his punches came at cunning angles, causing pain. Her forearm stung, and her side ached. If not for the protective gear, it would have been excruciating.</p>
<p>As she helplessly took blow after blow, her gaze suddenly met Lee Wooshin. It was oddly difficult to look at him now, so she reluctantly focused only on Seong Wookchan.</p>
<p>“Ugh…! Your name is Seong Wookchan?”</p>
<p>Then, smack! She was immediately struck in the face. Just a poke and he could open a can. As Seong Wookchan continued to land blows on her face, the room fell silent.</p>
<p>Seoryeong raised her guard, calmly considering her options. Since there were no other conditions for the sparring, it seemed they were expected to engage with their respective skills.</p>
<p>The moment the thought crossed her mind, Seoryeong wasted no time, no patience, and as if she had been waiting, she punched the man in the stomach and quickly climbed up Seong Wookchan’s torso.</p>
<p>“–!”</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, she was up to his shoulders and had a chokehold on his neck. Her elbow tightened around his throat, and with a thud, thud, Seong Wookchan let out a cry of pain.</p>
<p>He threw up his fists in protest, but Seoryeong didn’t budge, only tightening the snake-like grip tighter.</p>
<p>“Wow! That’s jiu-jitsu, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Is that jiu-jitsu?”</p>
<p>“No, I think it’s something like–”</p>
<p>The circle of trainees began to chatter. The instructors, who were watching from the side, also scratched their heads at Seoryeong’s gesture.</p>
<p>Jin Hojae covered his mouth with his hand and asked quietly.</p>
<p>“Team Leader, what is that technique?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, it’s just a baseless dogfight.”</p>
<p>“Alright if that’s what you think it is but Seong Wookchan is stuck on the ground. Why isn’t Han Seoryeong getting beaten up?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin gritted his molars until his jaw was stiff, never taking his eyes off the two in the middle of the fight.</p>
<p>“Thank goodness for the headgear. It’s there to prevent any head injuries. It means they’ll leave their heads alone until they knock each other out. Whether they end up swollen or bleeding, they will come out alive,” said Lee Wooshin.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“But even receiving those harsh blows, Seoryeong never blinked once.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Jin Hojae looked even more surprised himself.</p>
<p>“By chance or good eyesight, she just watched quietly and then seized the opportunity all at once. Though weak, she’s agile and flexible. How does she deal with such an idiotic but strong bastard?” Lee Wooshin sounded like he was almost complaining of Seoryeong’s spectacular performance.</p>
<p>Jin Hojae couldn’t tell if his boss was cursing or praising Han Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“How do I get rid of this fucking madness?” With his head tilted slightly, he muttered to himself in frustration.</p>
<p>At that moment, as if conceding defeat, Seong Wookchan tumbled to the ground but he was far from being over.</p>
<p>At that moment, as if conceding defeat, Seong Wookchan tumbled to the ground, but he was far from finished.</p>
<p>Caught off guard, Seoryeong fell backward, pain radiating from her tailbone as she was immediately subdued under Seong Wookchan’s weight.</p>
<p>Seong Wookchan coughed, clenching his fist, ready to throw a punch that would surely knock out Seoryeong or worse…</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The tense atmosphere was abruptly pierced by a voice that seemed to carry a hint of mischief—Lee Wooshin.</p>
<p>Seong Wookchan paused momentarily, having heard the instructor, but he couldn’t let this moment go without hurting Han Seoryeong. Without hesitation, he raised his hand again to strike. Seoryeong was helpless against his weight, which was twice hers.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a sharp thud―! Seong Wookchan’s head snapped back, and he collapsed.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear the instructor telling you to stop?” Lee Wooshin’s voice cut through the air like a knife.</p>
<p>If a watermelon were to explode, the sound of Lee Wooshin kicking Seong Wookchan’s head would be similar. The instructor had kicked Wookchan’s head like a soccer ball, stepping into the training ground just in time to prevent a serious assault on Seoryeong.</p>
<p>Seong Wookchan, crouched like a shrimp and clutching his head, rose reflexively at the instructor’s gesture, even though he looked as if he’d been stung.</p>
