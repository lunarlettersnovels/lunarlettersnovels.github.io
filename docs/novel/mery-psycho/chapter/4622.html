            <p><strong>Chapter 138.1</strong></p>
<p>Recognizing her voice, Channa fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Then, like a thunderclap, she shouted.</p>
<p>“Unnie, you’re alive?! Blast Agency’s cargo ship is a complete warzone right now!”</p>
<p>“I planted a tracker!”</p>
<p>At her urgent words, the other end of the line fell into stunned silence.</p>
<p>Through the phone, Seoryeong could hear Channa’s breath hitching, the sharp intake of air before her voice turned cold, controlled, and dangerous.</p>
<p>“Wait right there.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong pushed herself to run with everything she had. She had no idea where she was exactly, but she was sure she could catch up somehow. Her stomach twisted from hunger, and the sudden sunlight made her dizzy, but her legs only grew stronger with every step.</p>
<p>“He’s moving! That bastard is on the move!”</p>
<p>“Where? Where is he going?”</p>
<p>“I’ll track his location with this number and compare!”</p>
<p>“Hurry, Channa! He might have changed clothes by now…!”</p>
<p>Her heart pounded so hard it felt like it would burst. Strangely, her legs felt as light as feathers.</p>
<p>Even a moment’s delay could make the blinking red dot on Channa’s monitor disappear without a trace. Gasping for breath, Seoryeong refused to slow down.</p>
<p>“Unni, are you… walking right now?”</p>
<p>“No—huff—I’m running—huff—why?”</p>
<p>“At that speed, you won’t catch that son of a bitch. Find something to ride!”</p>
<p>She spun around, scanning her surroundings. Cars sped by, but there were no taxis, and she had no money. Stealing a car wasn’t an option either.</p>
<p>Frustrated, she raked her fingers through her hair and looked around desperately. Maybe she could grab onto a delivery truck or something. Just as she was about to make a move—</p>
<p>“That’s her! That thief stole my phone!”</p>
<p>A deafening roar of sirens filled the air. The same motorcycle from earlier approached, now flanked by a police car.</p>
<p>A young man clung to the open window of the police vehicle, shouting indignantly.</p>
<p>“Look at her! I told you she was some kind of fugitive—her wrist! The handcuffs!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong glanced at her wrist.</p>
<p>Ah… The agents had removed her cuffs, but in her rush to escape, she had left one still dangling like a bracelet.</p>
<p>Two officers stepped out, their hands brushing over their belts… reaching for their radios? Their batons? Their suspicious eyes locked onto her.</p>
<p>Then, Seoryeong spotted the handcuffs on their vests. They were the same model as the ones on her wrist.</p>
<p>Identical models meant the same key.</p>
<p>She hid her intentions and approached them calmly.</p>
<p>“Unnie, hurry! That bastard is getting farther away! According to the records, he stopped in your area, then went into a redevelopment zone, and now he’s circling back near Blast Agency’s headquarters! He’s on the highway now—if you don’t move fast, we’ll lose him!”</p>
<p>Channa’s urgent voice crackled through the phone. The rising panic made Seoryeong’s pulse race, but she forced herself to stay composed as she inched closer to the police car.</p>
<p>“Miss, can we get your name?”</p>
<p>The officers blocked her retreat, one pulling out a PDA as if ready to check her ID.</p>
<p>Seoryeong hesitated for a second then, without warning, she slammed the back of the officer’s head against the car.</p>
<p>In the confusion, she snatched the handcuff key and turned to run—but a sudden blow landed hard against her back.</p>
<p>“Urgh!”</p>
<p>There was no time to process the pain. She twisted, targeting pressure points, throwing quick punches.</p>
<p>She never wanted to resort to this. But whenever she thought about catching Kim Hyun, she always ended up crossing the line.</p>
<p>Even with her expression frozen like stone, she still bowed her head.</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry. I’ll return the phone. And the car. My name is Han Seoryeong. You can check my identity.”</p>
<p>“You—damn—radio!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for interfering with your work, but I have a situation I can’t explain!”</p>
<p>One of the fallen officers reached for a taser, but Seoryeong leaped into the driver’s seat and slammed the door shut.</p>
<p>The young man on the motorcycle could only gape at her in shock.</p>
<p>She gripped the steering wheel, stomped on the accelerator, and swerved onto the road. Channa’s voice barked directions in her ear—left! Right! Go straight!</p>
<p>Her heartbeat roared like an engine, but she didn’t stop.</p>
<p>VROOOOM—!</p>
<p>Then, in the side mirror, she spotted something familiar.</p>
<p>The motorcycle was back.</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>Her tongue felt dry, her vision blurred at the edges, and exhaustion gnawed at her.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t stop. Not now.</p>
<p>Seoryeong yanked the steering wheel sharply, weaving over the centerline repeatedly to shake off the motorcycle.</p>
<p>Horn blasts pierced the air from every direction. She barely slipped past another lane when Channa shouted through the phone.</p>
<p>“Sehwa Hospital! The destination looks like Sehwa Hospital!”</p>
<p>A cold chill ran through her. That was where the entire Special Security Team was hospitalized.</p>
<p>Was it just a coincidence? Her grip tightened on the wheel as an unsettling feeling washed over her.</p>
