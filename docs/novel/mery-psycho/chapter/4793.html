            <p><strong>Chapter 50.2 (R-rated)</strong></p>
<p>“If you act too emotionally, it doesn’t look like feelings, just insanity.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>His merciless words struck her heart like ice. Seoryeong tried her best not to moan.</p>
<p>“Is it that hard to live normally without going through this?” he asked, his tone disturbingly calm, a stark contrast to the savagery of his actions. His thick fingers stretched her, probing inside, relentlessly stirring her moist vagina. Seoryeong panted, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps as she struggled to suppress her emotions.</p>
<p>The room felt suffocating, the air heavy with the mix of power and resistance. She refused to give him the satisfaction of a reaction, clenching her fists so tightly her knuckles turned white. But her body betrayed her, a shiver running down her spine as his fingers moved with calculated cruelty.</p>
<p>“That’s… what I’m trying to do.” Seoryeong said..</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“My husband was my ‘normal.’ To live normally, I need my husband….”</p>
<p>Wooshin paused, his cheek twitching as if he heard something unexpected.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m enduring this humiliation… because there’s nothing like Kim Hyun in my life… he’s my only sense of normalcy. I just want to live a normal life.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Perhaps because they were so close, she could clearly feel him flinch.</p>
<p>“I never had it from birth, and I couldn’t enjoy it while living but my husband brought it to me, like a gift…”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“So what if blind devotion is like a disease? Is that so bad? Then I’ll live my life as a patient.”</p>
<p>Wooshin slowly blinked, even holding his breath for a moment.</p>
<p>“So, no matter what horrible things the instructor does, you won’t run away.”</p>
<p>“Why would I run away because of you?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You’re nothing like my husband. Instructor Jin Hojae is at least tolerable. So, whatever you do to me is pointless.”</p>
<p>With a detached, almost innocent expression, Seoryeong stated this matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>“Bring that electric baton you threw earlier and shove it in my ear. Let’s see who wins.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin clenched his teeth, his face flushing with rising blood pressure. He spat into his hand, then deliberately spread it over her genitals, a cruel smile playing at the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>“I spared you from spitting directly on your p*ssy.”</p>
<p>She felt disgusted and dirty, but the sensation against her skin made her bite her lower lip quietly.</p>
<p>Wooshin precisely found her sensitive spot and jabbed at it. Ah…! Her vision blurred white, and a wave of heat like an electric current shot through her body.</p>
<p>This was the first time her body had been forcibly opened, and it had been a long time since she had had such s*xual contact, so she couldn’t help but think of her husband.</p>
<p>Trying to ignore the peculiar discomfort and betrayal she felt, she squeezed her eyes shut. Just before Kim Hyun had vanished, he had been this rough with her—</p>
<p>“I told you not to close your eyes in front of me.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>At first, it seemed like he only intended to torment her with brute force, but now he had switched to shallow and rapid movements.</p>
<p>He repeatedly thrust into the spot that made Seoryeong convulse. Her lower abdomen tingled, and her nipples throbbed. The sensations she wanted to deny spread to her toes.</p>
<p>At that moment, she tried to recall Kim Hyun’s voice. He was the only one who had touched her body like this…</p>
<p>Then, like extinguishing a fire inside, wetness started to seep out.</p>
<p>“I know exactly what you’re thinking, so keep your eyes open.”</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>Two fingers in her tight, narrow passage continued to draw out the slick moisture. Her hot flesh gripped his hand tightly, as if it had a mind of its own.</p>
<p>“Comparing me to your husband, who looks like Jin Hojae, makes me feel gross. So keep your eyes open.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>When he applied pressure, causing his palm to rub against her, the hair on her body stood on end. Wooshin noticed this, his breathing becoming progressively rougher.</p>
<p>Despite his apparent discomfort, he continued to move his fingers inside her, scraping the rough inner walls. The sensation made her thighs tremble uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Finally, as if he couldn’t hold back any longer, he bent down and bit her thigh and groin painfully.</p>
