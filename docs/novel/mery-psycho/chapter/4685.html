            <p><strong>Chapter 105.2</strong></p>
<p>As they collapsed, their faces drew close, their foreheads almost touching. But as Seoryeong was just catching her breath…</p>
<p>“What do we do now? The instructor is all ready.”</p>
<p>She wanted to shout, Are you out of your mind? But his lips met hers again, firm and insistent. His tongue slipped in, and she caught it, holding it captive as if in defiance.</p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin swallowed her shaky moans, his lips moving to her neck. Each kiss made her stomach clench tighter, stirring a heat she couldn’t ignore.</p>
<p>Her head felt heavy and clouded. The friction was unrelenting, leaving her mouth dry and her body tense.</p>
<p>Seoryeong shut her eyes tightly. It had been such a long day—too long—and she felt like she was at her limit.</p>
<p>Rip—. The sound of a new condom being opened cut through the silence.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>She must have passed out and fallen asleep. She was lifted into a firm embrace, heard the sound of water pouring, and was submerged in warm water.</p>
<p>The gentle hands massaging her scalp gradually eased her fatigue.</p>
<p>Even then, her chest continued to be kneaded, and every part of her body was caressed.</p>
<p>Only after her n*pples were sucked to the point of pain did she think she was safely back on the bed.</p>
<p>When she came to her senses, she was banging her head against the door of Kim Hyun’s room.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh… ugh!”</p>
<p>Something like a stake was thrust deep into her. The intense pressure caused both of them to let out a moan simultaneously. The door shook as their bodies continued to collide.</p>
<p>Seoryeong gazed at the crazy man, who was still repeating the same motions, with a hazy expression.</p>
<p>“Stop! Just stop!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin was still thrusting into her from behind, in front of Kim Hyun’s room. He lifted one of her legs and inserted himself, their two bodies entwined like one, with her breasts swaying between them.</p>
<p>“What’s with doing it in front of my husband’s room?”</p>
<p>She tried to push him away with her exhausted arms, but he was unmoving. The speed of his thrusts increased, and the sound of their bodies colliding grew louder.</p>
<p>Every time he rammed into her, the locked door creaked.</p>
<p>“Think about your husband watching from over there.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>As soon as she heard those words, her lower body tightened strangely. The man laughed savagely, biting her neck, and the sound of their bodies colliding echoed through the quiet dawn.</p>
<p>She didn’t know how many times they had done it, but he always thrust into her like it was the first time.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he inserted two fingers and twisted them. With his fingers covered in saliva, he rolled her n*pples.</p>
<p>“If Kim Hyun saw this, he would be furious, right? Another guy holding his wife, crying and begging, what a sight. Ha… even if he’s your husband, he wouldn’t be able to bear this face.”</p>
<p>“Ha… ugh…!”</p>
<p>“I wanted to see this face, to see you like this, until the morning, damn it, until the morning.”</p>
<p>“Ah, ha, uh!”</p>
<p>Every time he lifted his hips, a moan burst out.</p>
<p>Seoryeong collapsed onto his shoulder, her body completely drained of energy. She was really out of breath, and her vision was blurry.</p>
<p>“Every time you take out your magnifying glass, I’ll f*ck you without fail―”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“I’ll bring you your magnifying glass again tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong shook her head, overwhelmed by the intense pleasure. His member, which had been pulled out, was again inserted, scraping against her inner walls.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Lee Wooshin kissed her forehead, still thrusting into her without pause. The entwined bodies, already hot, were now burning like a flame.</p>
<p>She couldn’t bear it anymore and collapsed, her body trembling.</p>
<p>“Ha… ah!”</p>
<p>Even after he ejaculated, he rubbed every inch of her vulva and sucked lazily on her earlobe.</p>
<p>She made a vague promise to herself, her mind cloudy.</p>
<p>From now on, even if she fails with her mission, she would try to figure things out on her own.</p>
<p>And she would get rid of the magnifying glass.</p>
