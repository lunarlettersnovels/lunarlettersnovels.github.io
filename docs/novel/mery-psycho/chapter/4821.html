            <p><strong>Chapter 36.1</strong></p>
<p>“You either look down on women, or you’re afraid of them.”</p>
<p>Though Lee Wooshin’s seated position lowered his eye level, his expression of disdain towards the recruits was vividly apparent.</p>
<p>He seemed indifferent, even showing signs of annoyance. Yet the air continued to weigh heavily, as if exerting gravity. No one dared to oppose him openly when he displayed his emotions like this. This was the power he held.</p>
<p>“But judging by the uproar, it seems to be the latter, huh?”</p>
<p>Furrowing his brow, he clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“It’s not about being uncomfortable with Recruit Han Seoryeong; it’s your own primitive instincts that seem to see her solely as a woman, treating her like some coddled monkey. That’s what’s getting under my skin.”</p>
<p>The rebuke hung heavy in the air, leaving Seong Wookchan speechless.</p>
<p>“Naturally, you are intimidated. Confronting your own reflection every day can be daunting. But failing to regard your colleague as just that, a colleague, speaks to your lack of intelligence and cultural understanding.” The instructor paused, his tone maintaining a veneer of politeness.</p>
<p>A suffocating silence gripped the barracks, each recruit too intimidated to even shuffle. Heads bowed, faces flushed crimson under the weight of the reprimand.</p>
<p>“If you comprehend, unpack your things swiftly.” With that, the instructor rose, met with a chorus of “Yes, sir!” and “Yes!” from all corners of the room.</p>
<p>They were all stiff with military discipline, and the frozen air seemed to gradually thaw.</p>
<p>If only Lee Wooshin hadn’t stopped in front of her.</p>
<p>“So, what’s your plan?” Wooshin’s tone grated, but his gaze bore into her with razor precision. Seoryeong clenched and unclenched her fists, feeling the weight of his scrutiny.</p>
<p>“Would giving you a separate room, as suggested, solve everything?” He shifted, hands tucked into his pockets, a nervous energy palpable.</p>
<p>There was a subtle jab in his question, a challenge. “Do you really think that’s the solution?”</p>
<p>Their eyes locked, dark pupils widening like a vast, turbulent sea.</p>
<p>“But since there are no spare rooms, if you’re to have one, it’ll be shared with an instructor.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“And that instructor is the one in front of you right now.”</p>
<p>His cold demeanor, punctuated by the subtle twitch at the corners of his mouth, was an affront to them all. But for some reason, Seoryeong felt a deeper sting, a sense of ill fortune that transcended mere disrespect.</p>
<p>“That’s enough, don’t look at me,” she retorted, her tone firm, though tinged with an edge of defiance.</p>
<p>“How many times a day do you have to watch them get naked?” he pressed on, his voice laced with a mocking tone.</p>
<p>“I don’t care,” she replied tersely, refusing to let his words rattle her resolve.</p>
<p>“So you’re going to change here too?” he probed further, his gaze piercing.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she affirmed, her voice steady. “You said it’s an intelligence problem if you can’t see your coworkers as coworkers.”</p>
<p>There was a fleeting moment of comprehension in Lee Wooshin’s eyes, his lips twisting upward briefly before settling back into their usual cold expression. It was a look that suggested his judgment was clouded by something darker, something twisted.</p>
<p>An unfamiliar spark ignited between them as they locked eyes, a silent battle of wills playing out in the intensity of their gaze.</p>
<p>“Okay. It’s your choice to hold out here,” he muttered with a mocking smirk, though beneath the surface, a sharpness lingered, palpable in the air.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lee Wooshin retrieved something from his pocket and flicked it in Seoryeong’s direction. Reflexively, she reached out and caught the object before it could fall to the ground.</p>
<p>It was a small dagger, its weight familiar in her hand as she gripped it tightly, her fingers instinctively curling around its hilt.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin surveyed the group with a smirk, his voice carrying a hint of dark amusement. “If there is any sexual harassment or abuse by your fellow officers, use this first and then report it.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s breath caught in her throat, a mixture of shock and disbelief washing over her. But before she could gather her thoughts, Lee Wooshin’s voice cut through the silence once more.</p>
<p>“Recruit Han Seoryeong, don’t get your priorities mixed up,” he admonished, his words carrying a weight that lingered in the air long after he had spoken.</p>
<p>His cold face briefly glanced at Seoryeong before turning away.</p>
<p>“If any of you are stabbed, you’re out of here without further ado, Seong Wookchan.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir…!”</p>
