        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 24.1</strong></p>
<p>“Uh.. no.”</p>
<p>Channa reflexively lowered her head at the questioning tone.</p>
<p>“If not, it doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying?”</p>
<p>“There is no way she could have changed in such a short period.” Lee Wooshin mumbled.</p>
<p>“What?” He Channa was puzzled.</p>
<p>“Then, is what she doing now normal?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Channa couldn’t help but feel hot under the collar. Somehow, as someone who had counseled  Han Seoryeong twice on her criminal plan, the first thing that came to her mind was disappointment.</p>
<p><em>Did this man know what her sister’s plans?</em></p>
<p><em>Did he find out about her attempted defection, or about the plans to kidnap the NIS deputy director?</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Channa’s face turned pale.</p>
<p>The new team leader was generally laid-back, but in some ways, he was meticulous and liked to pick on things.</p>
<p>Most of the customers of the Special Security Team were wealthy and corrupt individuals, but Lee Wooshin showed remarkably adept social skills and handling of affairs.</p>
<p>However, when it came to the members, he asked trivial questions like blood type or whether they had a lover, his attempt at knowing them even to the most minute details.</p>
<p>Then, when it was time for training, he would scratch people’s egos with a big smile on his face.</p>
<p>In other words, he was a capricious and selfish leader.</p>
<p>If, by any chance, her unnie Han Seoryeong had caught the eye of such a person… Channa could only grimace in her head.</p>
<p>“Is she sane to serve those bastards a three-soup breakfast every morning?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Luckily, it turned out to be just that. Channa’s stiff shoulders relaxed for a moment.</p>
<p>“Who in the world would serve a Korean meal to those bastards who can’t even remember combat rations properly during a mission? I doubt the company was worried about our meals and sent ladies along all this time.”</p>
<p>“… ”</p>
<p>“Somebody has to claim the corpses as a family when someone dies on our team, so they sent undercovers like Han Seryeong. But seeing you dawdle like this, maybe Han Seoryeong will be useful on this trip after all.”</p>
<p>Channa’s shoulders twitched at the tone of satisfaction.</p>
<p>At that moment, the loading gauge on the laptop screen rapidly filed up. As the security barrier was breached and the system accessed, fingerprint patterns began to appear one by one.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the darkness, lights began to flicker on, as if someone had detected the intrusion. Channa bit her nails and just stared at the monitor. <em>Let’s finish this quickly… hurry…!</em></p>
<p>“Seoryeong’s cognitive function seems noticeably impaired for her age.” Lee Wooshin continued with his musings despite the urgent situation.</p>
<p>“It’s not even alcohol-induced brain damage; she’s just become a fool who needs to try shit or miso to know if it’s shit or miso. I guess the guy who ran off with her all her money wasn’t just a regular scumbag.” Channa said to Seoryeong’s defense.</p>
<p>“… ”</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect a person to become so utterly pathetic.” She continued, disgust laced in her voice directed at someone unknown.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin remained silent, feeling increasingly uneasy as he quietly ground his teeth.</p>
<p>“…It’s clear that she got caught up with the worst of the worst. Because of that bastard, poor unnie ended up like this…”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If I ever meet him in my lifetime, I’m afraid I’ll cut his belly button open and make a skewer out of it. Don’t ask me anything else, just know that…”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin pressed his thumb firmly on the acupuncture points on the nape of his neck.</p>
<p>“So, that’s why I brought unnie into our company.”</p>
<p>“…You did?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin asked, pausing.</p>
<p>“There are many reasons, but the first one is that there are many men in the company, so I insisted that she should have some time with the younger and fitter comrades.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“That’s how recovery works, I suppose, and I’m glad I did.”</p>
<p>The laptop screen changed. The frantically spinning passwords clicked into place, and the files finally began to open in a torrent.</p>
<p>Channa was so busy finishing up that she didn’t notice the silence around her.</p>
<p>“It was you.” Lee Wooshin said in a low voice. His voice was accompanied by a wry smile.</p>
<p>The man patted Channa on the back, saying something unintelligible. ‘Your job is done,’ he said, signaling for her to leave.</p>
<p>Channa pulled her hood up and ran out of the mansion without looking back. The rest of the group would cross the border, but Channa’s work was done.</p>
<p><em>When I get back, I’m going to make some spicy ramen with unnie!</em></p>
<p>Channa disappeared down the unlit alleyway.</p>
