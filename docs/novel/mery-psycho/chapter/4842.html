            <p><strong>Chapter 25.1</strong></p>
<p>“Y-Yes, speak.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s held breath exploded, blurring her vision. She needed to speak quickly, and her breath became excessively rapid, leading to dizziness.</p>
<p>“He’s dead…he’s dead.”</p>
<p>―…</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence from the other end. For Seoryeong, that moment of silence felt eternal.</p>
<p>“-…Han Seoryeong?” he repeated, as if to confirm, as if he didn’t understand why he could hear her.</p>
<p>“Yes… it’s Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>Their mind was in chaos, unable to decide what to say first. Seoryeong took deep breaths, gripping her hair tightly in frustration. She had to pull herself together somehow.</p>
<p>“The staff… the staff is died.”</p>
<p>―… What?</p>
<p>“They’re all dead.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong looked around the chillingly cold room.</p>
<p>“But Channa is missing, not in the room. She’s gone.”</p>
<p>―…</p>
<p>She had been cleaning the employees’ rooms for days, so if there was anything strange, it would surely catch her eye. Seoryeong thoroughly inspected the room for any anomalies.</p>
<p>“There’s no blood, no signs of resistance. Her bed sheets are just rolled up as if she just slipped out, and there’s no other smell. The dead staff’s rooms had a strong scent of perfume…”</p>
<p>As she continued speaking, she paused abruptly.</p>
<p>“The communal kitchen…”</p>
<p><em>Just as I woke up thirsty, maybe Channa, who ate ramen with me, woke up to get a drink of water.</em></p>
<p>The intruder might be looking for Channa by now. As the thought dawned on her, her heart sank. There was no time.</p>
<p>“And… it seems like there’s still an intruder in the inn.” She said in horror.</p>
<p>―Then Channa is highly likely to be killed.</p>
<p>Said Lee Wooshin on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>―…!</p>
<p>“What, now, what…?” Seoryeong, who had been listening with a blank expression, furrowed her brow in disbelief.</p>
<p>―To put it more bluntly, Seoryeong will soon be killed too.</p>
<p>―…!</p>
<p>―Witnesses are not kept alive.</p>
<p>Her heart grew cold. <em>What am I hearing right now…?</em></p>
<p>―You still haven’t grasped the situation? How are you going to evade a trained assassin?</p>
<p>―So listen carefully from now on.</p>
<p>Wooshin’s voice suddenly became menacing, sending a shiver down her spine.</p>
<p>―There’s a gun under my bed. The door is locked, but if you hit the doorknob with a heavy object, it’ll open quickly. However, making a loud noise will reveal your position.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but you have to do it.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s mouth was dry, and her pupils were trembling. Nevertheless, Eusin commanded calmly.</p>
<p>“The first thing you need to do is get the gun. Are you listening?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong nodded quickly, but still couldn’t speak.</p>
<p>“Pull yourself together. We are too far right now. The best we can do is recover your bodies. If you want to survive, then run fast now!”</p>
<p>As he urged her on forcefully, Seoryeong dashed out as if his words were a signal.</p>
<p>Upon seeing his door standing like a wall, she kicked it with her foot. Thud, thud―! With just two kicks, the doorknob broke, and the door swung open.</p>
<p>She reached under the bed and groped around the frame. There, her fingertips touched something solid. It was the cold barrel of a gun.</p>
<p>“I found it…!”</p>
<p>With those words, she rose swiftly and headed towards the communal kitchen.</p>
<p>Before following the instructions.</p>
<p>―Then abandon Channa and get out of there.</p>
<p>The man murmured calmly.</p>
<p>―That’s the only way Seoryeong can survive.</p>
<p>Her attempt to flee the room froze in its tracks. Seoryeong, gripped by terror, wiped all expression from her face for a moment and clenched her fists tightly.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, she completely understood Wooshin’s words. There was a sincere urging to follow the command coldly, and she found herself in agreement.</p>
<p>Perhaps she wouldn’t make it out alive…. It could really happen…. Just seeing the two bodies shook Seoryeong to the core.</p>
<p>―Weak people who stubbornly cling to their principles usually end up dead. I call it dying needlessly.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>―There’s no time for hesitation. Don’t indulge in such luxury in this situation.</p>
<p>His every word guided her. Since everything was his command, simply following it seemed to ease her mind.</p>
<p>―I’m the head of the Special Security Team, and I oversee the operation. So, Seoryeong, you have to follow my orders. I’ll say it one last time. Leave Channa behind and get out of that inn as soon as possible.</p>
