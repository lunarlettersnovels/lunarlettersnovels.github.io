            <p><strong>Chapter 180.2</strong></p>
<p>The person who had been staring blankly out the window for days suddenly shifted, throwing a sharp look.</p>
<p>Beneath the previously calm expression, dark emotions surged violently.</p>
<p>Na Wonchang lowered his head, feeling ashamed, while He Channa sat with her legs crossed, glaring at Lee Woo-shin.</p>
<p>Just the other evening, she had barged in, calling him “Team Leader!” The fact that both the National Intelligence Service team leader and the Blast SA team leader shared the same title had briefly confused her affiliation.</p>
<p>Spitting out a torrent of northern slang, He Channa was undeniably useful.</p>
<p>It was necessary to secure at least one more hostage to provoke Han Seoryeong. Thus, Lee Wooshin tacitly accepted He Channa’s involvement.</p>
<p>“It seems the owl has taken off her wedding ring. The last location was a detention center in Azerbaijan.”</p>
<p>“…Took off the ring?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s eyebrows twitched as he continued to stare out the window.</p>
<p>“She probably didn’t want to see it anymore. What’s so good about that ring for a scammer husband to keep? Ah! Our sister ran off with a new man, so if she’s getting remarried, it would be perfect to melt it down and use it as a gift! But no matter how I look at it, it seems like a pretty worthless ring to melt down, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Husband’s trash, ring’s trash! Even her threats of self-harm are trash!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“So why are you acting like you’ve been blindsided, saying ‘Did she throw away the ring I gave her?’ Even the North Korean People’s Army had better sense than that!”</p>
<p>Na Wonchang stepped on the outbursting Channa’s foot as she crossed her arms. She shot a desperate glare at the weak South Korean man, then quietly closed her mouth.</p>
<p>However, her lower lip, which was jutting out, continued to pout. Na Wonchang, sweating profusely, continued his report.</p>
<p>“B-but, Kia seems to be quite famous in that world. He’s not an SVR (Foreign Intelligence Service) agent, but he engages in activities that benefit the Kremlin. In that sense, it seems the Sakhalin monastery is under protection.”</p>
<p>That makes sense, Lee Wooshin thought, clenching his jaw.</p>
<p>“He’s known as the Boogeyman in the U.S., but recently, he was photographed with a Soviet arms dealer. There are no other traces beyond that.”</p>
<p>“What about the Sakhalin monastery?”</p>
<p>“Since the second patriarchal ceremony fell through, it’s been quiet over there without any movement.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin gulped down water, feeling his throat dry.</p>
<p>“But, Team Leader….”</p>
<p>He glanced at Na Wonchang, who was hesitating while crumpling an empty plastic bottle.</p>
<p>“You really need to catch the owl?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s just–”</p>
<p>“If you have got something to say, just say it plainly.”</p>
<p>Na Wonchang could not withstand the fierce glare and hung his head low. Finally unable to just watch, He Channa pushed past him, tapping his shoulder as if telling him to move aside, and stepped forward.</p>
<p>“You’d better steel yourself for this, Team Leader. I was too scared to say it, but I once gave Interpol a good stir.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“That arms dealer was an old man who frequently operated in North Korea, China, or Syria, so I just focused on digging into those areas.”</p>
<p>Channa smirked.</p>
<p>“And then, just one single photo. It wasn’t clear, but wasn’t there a woman caught at the edge of the frame?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You couldn’t see her face clearly, and it’s just a rumor, but that old man let this slip.”</p>
<p>Channa gave a crooked smile and clapped her hands. Na Wonchang tightly shut his eyes.</p>
<p>“Kia’s woman!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A rough, panting sound filled the air. Seoreong’s body shook faintly, but no change showed on her expressionless face.</p>
<p>Again today, the wet, sloshing friction sound shattered her dawn’s sleep. Her body rocked incessantly from someone’s movements.</p>
<p>“You’re doing it again without asking!”</p>
<p>Kia was kneeling beside the bed, masturbating. He gripped the base of his shaft, kneaded the scrotum beneath it, and vigorously rubbed the glans.</p>
<p>“Haa, ngh!”</p>
<p>His fierce moans continued to echo through the room. She watched the dark red pen!s sliding in and out of his ringed fingers, and finally let out a sigh.</p>
<p>He stroked his without hesitation, gazing at Seoryeong with lust-filled eyes.</p>
<p>“Sonya… Ugh..!”</p>
<p>His fingers, which had been rubbing the glans, occasionally scratched the split end with a fingernail. He mashed his thick tongue against his own rough hand as if kissing it. His red tongue, obscenely licked and wet his hand. Saliva dripped in streams down the back of his hand.</p>
<p>‘Ah, gross…’</p>
<p>“Kia.”</p>
<p>At the low, calm call, he jerked his head up.</p>
<p>“Just how long are you really going to keep this up?”</p>
<p>“Until you… hnght… look at me!”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t even touch that thing with the sole of my slipper. Understand? Even if I wanted to smash it, I wouldn’t use my hand, let alone my foot. So quit it while I’m asking nicely. Because of you, my dreams are violent every single night!”</p>
<p>“No. Haa… Sonya… Just look at me.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen one as big as mine?”</p>
<p>Its terrifying mass already throbbed with a pulse.</p>
