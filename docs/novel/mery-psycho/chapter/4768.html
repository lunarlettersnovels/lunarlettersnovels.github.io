            <p><strong>Chapter 63.1</strong></p>
<p>“Dammit… you!”</p>
<p>Seong Wookchan, who had been lunging at her like a madman, finally hesitated.</p>
<p>However, he still couldn’t believe the situation where a knife had suddenly been thrust into him. He looked alternately at his bleeding thigh and Seoryeong with dazed eyes.</p>
<p>“What did you just do to me?”</p>
<p>“Forgotten? When a colleague commits sexual harassment, what steps should I take?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, damn you! Are you out of your mind?”</p>
<p>“The one who’s really out of their mind is you. But I avoided the vital nerves.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“But this isn’t enough.”</p>
<p>When she abruptly tried to pull out the knife, Seong Wookchan immediately changed his attitude, pleading with a grimace, “Don’t pull it out, don’t pull it out!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong nodded as if she was being generous, but she calmly pulled out the dagger. Then she stabbed it into the other side of his knee.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>Seong Wookchan’s mouth opened wide, but no sound came out. He just grabbed his knee and trembled, veins bulging in his neck. Blood flowed profusely from the torn muscles in his thigh.</p>
<p>“People feel fear in unpredictable and irrational situations. You learned that with me during the recovery training, didn’t you? So, to overturn the situation, I had to make that effort.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You disobeyed the rules, but I did not. I’m going to use you as a prop and win this game.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong picked up a stone that had been holding down a waterproof tarp.</p>
<p>She thought it would be easier to move him if he was unconscious. Just as she hesitated, Seong Wookchan, with a twisted face, lunged at her again, cursing, “You damn bitch!”</p>
<p>But he couldn’t move his legs and could only swing his arms like a whip to pull her towards him. Reflexively, Seoryeong struck his forehead with the stone.</p>
<p>“Da*n you…” Seong Wookchan kept cursing until the last moment before his eyes rolled back.</p>
<p>As she supported his collapsed body, Seoryeong touched the tip of her nose for no reason. Feeling oddly light-hearted, she smeared the blood from his torn forehead all over his face. Then she stepped on his half-erect crotch and stood up.</p>
<p>It was a refreshing morning.</p>
<p>Swish— Swish—</p>
<p>With each step, a red line was drawn across the snow.</p>
<p>She was dragging the bound Seong Wookchan like a sled, diligently moving forward. The weight of an adult man was significant but not unmanageable for her alone.</p>
<p>“Hmm, hmm, hmm.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong hummed softly, readjusted her grip on the rope, and trudged through the deep snow.</p>
<p>In both pockets, she had securely packed wire snares and a matchbox she had personally modified.</p>
<p>She thoroughly repurposed the bag that the instructors had provided as a survival kit into a killing kit.</p>
<p>Didn’t everyone play like that at least once in elementary school? Making small launchers with mechanical pencils and rubber bands, throwing erasers with clothespin catapults, and shooting marbles with coat hanger slingshots. Seoryeong had pranked the older kids at the orphanage like that and fought endlessly.</p>
<p>Eventually, she arrived at a suitable spot, stretched her stiff shoulders, and looked around. The surroundings were silent, with no trace of people.</p>
<p>Seoryeong tied the unconscious man to a tree trunk and gagged him with a bundle of branches she had wrapped in cloth beforehand. By then, the area around the tree was already stained with splotches of blood.</p>
<p>And bang—!</p>
<p>Seoryeong stretched her arm above her head and fired a flare. The sound was identical to that of a gun, causing the birds nearby to flutter and fly away.</p>
<p>The reddish light shot out boldly, but with the snow obscuring the view, it was uncertain how many people would see it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Hey! This asshole got stabbed!”</p>
<p>“Seong Wookchan! Seong Wookchan, wake up! Who did this to you?!”</p>
<p>At the sound of the gunfire, which they should never have heard, three or four team members nearby rushed over quickly.</p>
<p>They were momentarily speechless at the sight of their blood-soaked comrade but quickly began administering first aid.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ, what kind of asshole did this!”</p>
<p>They applied pressure to stop the bleeding and removed the gag from his mouth.</p>
<p>Then, one of the team members, scanning the surroundings with a wary expression, spoke tensely.</p>
<p>“Hey… isn’t there someone else here besides us?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Otherwise, who fired the flare when this guy’s hands and feet are all tied up?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>A silence colder than the chill in the air quickly spread among the team members.</p>
<p>Quick on the uptake. Seoryeong, hiding behind a fallen tree, continued to fidget with her matchbox.</p>
