            <p><strong>Chapter 43.2</strong></p>
<p>“He’s her husband, someone she can’t live without. Despite her youthful appearance, she’s practically a married woman.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“I’ve checked; she married young.”</p>
<p>Wooshin’s lips curled up like a snake’s as he gazed at his bewildered subordinate.</p>
<p>“Why, don’t you believe me?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes…”</p>
<p>“If you doubt me, go ahead and speak ill of her husband.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“And don’t attempt it while she’s holding a pistol. She seems quite obsessed with her husband.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>Jin Hoje blinked blankly, then suddenly jumped up.</p>
<p>“That can’t be right. That look in her eyes was definitely flirtatious! Would I really feel that way about someone who’s taken? I still uphold my military spirit!”</p>
<p>Wooshin softly rubbed the back of his subordinate’s neck and whispered.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. She’s not just pretty in your eyes.”</p>
<p>Jin Hoaje shivered from head to toe, his shoulders tensing up.</p>
<p>“So, cut it out with this nonsense about how this woman seduced you or how captivating her gaze was. She’s nothing special, so don’t let yourself get carried away and embarrass yourself.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“You’re good at following orders.”</p>
<p>With a cold expression, Lee Woohsin patted his subordinate’s head. Jin Hojae turned his head back towards the barracks in disbelief, his mouth agape as he watched the woman still clinging to the top.</p>
<p>“No, wow… She’s not just pretty, but also has an incredible physique and athleticism…!”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>Wooshin slapped Jin’s chin, causing him to look up at him in frustration, his tongue caught between his teeth.</p>
<p>Yet, Wooshin’s gaze remained chilled, a faint furrow forming in his brow. His stare was instinctive and piercing, almost predatory.</p>
<p>Hojae straightened his posture and fell silent under the weight of his commander’s gaze.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>Back in the officers’ quarters, Lee Wooshin locked the door and immediately found his in-ear piece and placed them in his ears. The red dot flickered for a moment, followed by a cheerful greeting as if he had been waiting.</p>
<p>He lifted the window curtains and looked out of habit to see what was going on outside.</p>
<p>“Have you found out about what I asked?”</p>
<p>―Ah…! You mean CEO Kang Taegon? I’ve finished a light investigation.</p>
<p>“Any connections with the Owl?”</p>
<p>―There were no noticeable connections. But it seems that trip to Thailand left an impression on him. Since that day, he’s been opening Owl’s resume frequently.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>-It seems like they did some research and wanted to scout her.</p>
<p>At Blast Agency, Han Seoryeong being scouted was not the news Lee Wooshin wanted to hear. With a scowl deepening on his face, he pressed his furrowed brow.</p>
<p>He tried to kick Han Seoryeong out, but Blast was pulling her in, which made him feel very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>-That was CEO Kang Taegon’s wish, or rather, habit.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?</p>
<p>-The Blast Agency has been working hard to increase the number of female bodyguards. We have a history of bringing in people from here and there and putting them through training. Most of them were third-rate fighters in need of money.</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“…After that, their whereabouts or updates become quite mysterious.”</p>
<p>“Go on.”</p>
<p>“Every time President Kang Taegon went on a business trip to Saint Petersburg, he took female bodyguards with him… but he always returned alone.”</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence between them. Lee Woohsin’s face grew grave as he cleared his throat. Veins stood out sharply on the back of his hand as he gripped the table.</p>
<p>“The stupid owl got the wrong end of the stick.”</p>
<p>―… If CEO Kang Taegon really wanted her, it won’t be easy for the team leader to dismiss the owl. They’ll find a way to bring Blast back somehow.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin quietly bit his inner cheek.</p>
