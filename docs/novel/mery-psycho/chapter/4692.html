            <p><strong>Chapter 102.1</strong></p>
<p class="" data-start="213" data-end="233">“No, don’t do that!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="235" data-end="420">Lee Wooshin lifted her a<em data-start="259" data-end="281">s and pulled her und</em>rwear off in one swift motion. The elastic slapped against her flesh and caught at her ankles, and her legs were draped over his shoulders.</p>
<p class="" data-start="422" data-end="506">He squeezed her fleshy thighs together and began rubbing her with his rough fingers.</p>
<p class="" data-start="508" data-end="517">“Ugh…!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="519" data-end="572">A chill ran down her spine and her hair stood on end.</p>
<p class="" data-start="574" data-end="623">“I only spanked your a*s, so why is it wet here?”</p>
<p class="" data-start="625" data-end="646">“Uh… Sweat, I guess.”</p>
<p class="" data-start="648" data-end="809">Seoryeong could feel two or three fingers spreading her wide. If it was indeed wet, it made a slippery sound as he rubbed it slowly up from her hole to her cl*t.</p>
<p class="" data-start="811" data-end="919">She bit her lip hard to keep from moaning. She tried pulling at his hair, but he only restrained her wrists.</p>
<p class="" data-start="921" data-end="980">Lee Wooshin stared down at her flesh, then buried his head.</p>
<p class="" data-start="982" data-end="988">“Ugh!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="990" data-end="1191">He stuck out his tongue and flicked it from the fleshy part to the reddened hole. He rubbed her p<em data-start="1087" data-end="1189">ssy, swollen from the callous insertion, soothingly with his broad tongue, then slid it up to her cl</em>t.</p>
<p class="" data-start="1193" data-end="1250">She cried out, twisting her hips in a frenzy of pleasure.</p>
<p class="" data-start="1252" data-end="1303">“Don’t, don’t, don’t! We’re like husband and wife!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="1305" data-end="1410">“…That can’t be,” Lee Wooshin paused for a moment, then took her nub into his mouth and sucked on them.</p>
<p class="" data-start="1412" data-end="1418">“Hmm!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="1420" data-end="1586">A sharp jolt of stimulation shot through her body. Unlike her husband, who would stop immediately if she asked him not to, Lee Wooshin ignored her request every time.</p>
<p class="" data-start="1588" data-end="1747">His cheeks hollowed out as he rammed in. Lee Wooshin, sensing the hint like a ghost, stuck his tongue into the hole, even though she wanted to clench her legs.</p>
<p class="" data-start="1749" data-end="1893">Without another word, he spread her legs a little wider and buried his tongue deep inside her and began to move his head as if he were chopping.</p>
<p class="" data-start="1895" data-end="1909">“Ah… ah…!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="1911" data-end="1987">Seoryeong bit her lip to keep from screaming, but the moans came out anyway.</p>
<p class="" data-start="1989" data-end="2131">Even lying still, she was breathing heavily, and her body was pulsing. Her n*pples stood hard inside her top, which she hadn’t even taken off.</p>
<p class="" data-start="2133" data-end="2285">He turned his head, spreading Seoryeong’s crotch even further apart, and as he licked greedily at the winged slit, it made a sucking sound like a treat.</p>
<p class="" data-start="2287" data-end="2365">The soles of her feet burned hot as they were pulled apart. She felt feverish.</p>
<p class="" data-start="2367" data-end="2379">“Hmph, ugh!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="2381" data-end="2531">The tongue that had been licking between her legs dug into the inside. The wet, slippery tongue poked into the crevice, persistently licking the area.</p>
<p class="" data-start="2533" data-end="2664">It was like lighting a fire with a match, as the tongue fiercely licked without stopping. Her lips were dry, and her jaw was tense.</p>
<p class="" data-start="2666" data-end="2673">“Ahhh!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="2675" data-end="2771">A sound she couldn’t hold back escaped. Her muscles contracted, and a burst of fluid gushed out.</p>
<p class="" data-start="2773" data-end="2953">His nose was buried in her p*be, and his tongue was covered in sticky liquid. He continued to lick her, and the excessively vivid sight made her breath quicken and her vision blur.</p>
<p class="" data-start="2955" data-end="3115">Seoryeong only grasped the sheet tightly. Lee Wooshin inserted his fingers into the completely relaxed hole. Unlike the first time, it was a soft, gentle entry.</p>
<p class="" data-start="3117" data-end="3185">He stroked her patiently and watched her every reaction to pleasure.</p>
<p class="" data-start="3187" data-end="3269">His inserted fingers rubbed against her inner wall, stimulating her nerve endings.</p>
<p class="" data-start="3271" data-end="3348">The fluid that had accumulated inside her made a lewd, wet sound that echoed.</p>
<p class="" data-start="3350" data-end="3456">Why couldn’t he do it like before? Why couldn’t he just make it hurt like before? Make her only feel pain.</p>
<p class="" data-start="3458" data-end="3506">Her resentful gaze lingered on him for a moment.</p>
<p class="" data-start="3508" data-end="3657">“Ugh!” Lee Wooshin sucked on her raised thigh, roughly breathing in and out. His fingers were pressing against her inner wall as if to leave a print.</p>
<p class="" data-start="3659" data-end="3719">In response, her folds welcomed his assault, sucking him in.</p>
<p class="" data-start="3721" data-end="3831">Her cl*t flashed red in front of her eyes as he sucked harder and harder, making her close to reaching climax.</p>
<p class="" data-start="3833" data-end="3849">“Ah, ah, uh…!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="3851" data-end="3911">Her lower abdomen felt like it was being turned upside down.</p>
<p class="" data-start="3913" data-end="4017">Seoryeong struggled to endure the overwhelming pleasure, but her body betrayed her, convulsing suddenly.</p>
<p class="" data-start="4019" data-end="4024">“Ah!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="4026" data-end="4178">The intensity was almost unbearable, like her core was twisting in on itself. His firm fingertips pressed against an inner spot, precise and unyielding.</p>
<p class="" data-start="4180" data-end="4264">Seoryeong gasped, her voice faltering. “W-wait, just for a moment, Instructor, ah…!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="4266" data-end="4473">But the unperturbed Lee Wooshin played with the sensitive spot he had discovered, each stroke sending tremors down her spine. He extended his arm to press firmly on her lower abdomen, anchoring her in place.</p>
<p class="" data-start="4475" data-end="4587">The sensation bordered on too much, a searing heat that rendered her immobile, caught between pleasure and pain.</p>
<p class="" data-start="4589" data-end="4599">“Ha… ah…!”</p>
<p class="" data-start="4601" data-end="4772">He pulled out his fingers and thrust them back in, repeating the motion. The thick digits were tearing apart her melted insides, pressing down on the spot again and again.</p>
<p class="" data-start="4774" data-end="4888">As he continued to push her limits, sharp waves of sensation ripped through her, lighting her up from head to toe.</p>
