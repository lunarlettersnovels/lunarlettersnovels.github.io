            <p><strong>Chapter 19.1</strong></p>
<p>“Do you like working here?”</p>
<p>“… Yes.”</p>
<p><em>Seems like we can’t go quietly.</em></p>
<p>“You came in with intelligence team leader’s recommendation. Did you know each other before?”</p>
<p>“Do I have to answer?” Seoryeong seemed a bit agitated by his accusing questions.</p>
<p>The man’s lips smiled but his eyes didn’t.</p>
<p>“Yes, you should. Originally it was one of the ladies that was supposed to join me but I heard she hurt her back.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to fill that spot, so it’ll be best if you could answer in earnest. If you understood, please cooperate.”</p>
<p><em>Then this is… an indirect interview. </em>But the way he asking wasn’t a suggestion and the heavy air was crushing her. She was getting uncomfortable with this closed space.</p>
<p>“I knew him a bit personally.”</p>
<p>“Personally?” Lee Wooshin raised an eyebrow, his expression unreadable.</p>
<p>He tapped his fingers on the armrest, and Seoryeong stared out the window, trying to avoid his gaze. It was clear she didn’t want to talk.</p>
<p>“Is Mr. Jung Pilgyu your father or your husband?” he prodded.</p>
<p>Her heart raced.</p>
<p>When she finally looked at him, she could sense his intent.</p>
<p>“If you answer is short, my thought process also becomes short. Should I even assume more?”</p>
<p>She frowned at his teasing voice.</p>
<p>This man was a far cry from the playful combatant who used to tease her. Dealing with someone so shrewd wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>Seoryeong added quietly, trying to shrink into herself, “I know his sister-in-law more than him.”</p>
<p>“He Channa?”</p>
<p>He frowned while hitting the horn lightly. He kicked his tongue and changed the lane smoothly, avoiding a car that got into lane in a hurry.</p>
<p>Seoryeong opened her clenched shoulder subconsciously. She should be used to it by now but her heart still pounded from sudden noise.</p>
<p>It wasn’t so loud that would freeze her, but it felt like it was a leftover trait from her blind days.</p>
<p>Her mood soured as she couldn’t help but thinking about Kim Hyun.</p>
<p>“… Did you know that she is an excellent hacker?”</p>
<p>Was it because of the traffic? His sudden cold voice cut the air.</p>
<p>Seoryeong nodded while trying to suppress her thoughts about Kim Hyun. She knew Channa was a hacker, but she wasn’t aware that Channa was very good at it.</p>
<p>“In 2016, the central bank of Bangladesh was hacked. Their estimated amount was $100 billion and they failed by a split second. Behind the scene was North Korean government, and the main hacker was a sixteen year old girl.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“And that was He Channa.”</p>
<p>She wanted to look like she didn’t care but she couldn’t. The man continued while steering softly.</p>
<p>“North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but they also have one of the most developed cyber hacking criminal group. They pick out kids who are good at math at young age and train them in a Chinese system. He Channa was the best output from the system.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Well, that was before she escaped North Korea.”</p>
<p>Her head went numb. She wasn’t just an ordinary escapee and yet Seoryeong was trying to rope her into going back to the north…</p>
<p>Jung Pilgyu must have had nightmares if he heard her threat. She had goosebumps thinking this could’ve gone all so wrong.</p>
<p>While she was blanking out, the car stopped at red light.</p>
<p>“So—“</p>
<p>The man put a candy in his mouth.</p>
<p>He spoke like he was mumbling.</p>
<p>“How did you meet? There was no point of contact between the two.”</p>
<p>“Do I have to tell you my personal life?”</p>
<p>“Don’t think too hard and just tell me what you think.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I need to brief the team on even the most brief schedules, so it’s crucial we’re all acquainted. Just a heads up, even a minor case of food poisoning can halve our success rate. If anyone’s feeling uneasy, we shouldn’t proceed with the operation.”</p>
<p>He had tiring personality. Seoryeong kicked her tongue in her head.</p>
<p>“Is it something you can’t say? Why did you illegally ask to dig someone’s personal stuff?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s breath stopped. How did he know?</p>
<p>What he said jokingly actually hit the spot.</p>
<p>As she grabbed her sleeves, his eyes seemed to have caught it.</p>
<p>“Did you actually?”</p>
<p>While she was wondering how much she should reveal, he smiled.</p>
<p>“Seems like someone took your money and ran.”  he commented, popping a candy into his mouth and shrugging, as though such occurrences were commonplace.</p>
<p>She still found the scent of the others unpleasant, and this man, who hadn’t made the best first impression, didn’t sit well with her either. But it was his attitude that baffled her the most.</p>
<p>It was as if he was trying to peer into her soul, yet remained disinterested. His nonchalant demeanor irked her, prompting Seoryeong to put her guard up even higher.</p>
<p>“Remember what I said when you won’t talk?”</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“It’s not hard to blab on, but learning ability is another issue. I saw a lot of people dying while I try to explain the same thing twice.”</p>
<p>His face was shaded by a cap while he stared at her. She didn’t bother responding. There was silence for a moment.</p>
<p>“You’re not cooperating so I’ll just open up.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m the one who makes the list of those coming abroad. So it’s better to not follow the special security team’s travel. Especially those who have weak heart.”</p>
