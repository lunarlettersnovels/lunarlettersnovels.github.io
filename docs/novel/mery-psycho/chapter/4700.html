            <p><strong>Chapter 98.1</strong></p>
<p>“I really need you to do this one.”</p>
<p>About four years ago, at a private detention center in Myanmar, Chief Joo Seolheon arrived holding a file with some additional documents enclosed.</p>
<p>At the time, Lee Wooshin had been undercover within the regime, gathering intel as Myanmar’s military dictatorship began stirring once more.</p>
<p>Usually, he finished his assignments by erasing all traces and disappearing, but this time, he was in the detention center, lying low until he received his next orders.</p>
<p>“Here’s your next target. Temporary codename: Owl.”</p>
<p>It was the first time Chief Joo Seolheon had visited him since recruiting him. Wooshin silently ran his hand over his closely shaven head and got into the car.</p>
<p>As he roughly tore open the envelope, photographs of a woman he had never seen before spilled out. He scanned her brief background details, listed in simple text, with a disinterested look.</p>
<p>An orphan, dropped out of school. Ah, and she was young, too.</p>
<p>Most of her days spent at a nursing home with a blank expression, dressed in a neatly ironed white uniform, her gaze shifting between sorrowful and indifferent depending on the angle.</p>
<p>Despite her youth, she had no vitality. She seemed more suited to crying than smiling. The thought crossed his mind abruptly.</p>
<p>“What exactly do you want me to do with someone like this?”</p>
<p>“Marriage.”</p>
<p>He snorted immediately. He’d carried out numerous missions, but being ordered to marry was unheard of.</p>
<p>When he laughed again, this time in disbelief, Chief Joo’s face twisted in irritation.</p>
<p>“No matter how you live, you still understand what it means to be a husband, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“A guy who demands food every time he sees you?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Joo Seolheon sighed and handed him one more photo.</p>
<p>A man’s face, lined with wrinkles and an unsettling gaze. Instantly, his expression turned cold.</p>
<p>The man in the photo was someone Wooshin could never fail to recognize—once a widely discussed figure, both in Russia and Korea.</p>
<p>“Rigay Viktor has been granted a special pardon in Russia.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The photo crumpled beyond recognition in Wooshin’s hands.</p>
<p>The Solzhenitsyn family’s tragedy.</p>
<p>He still had nightmares, like a child.</p>
<p>That moment when the grand mansion shattered, utterly destroyed. The screams of the guests were swept away in an instant.</p>
<p>Seventy Russian politicians, thirty-eight Solzhenitsyn family relatives, and over forty employees perished in the flames—a horrific scene.</p>
<p>As he clawed his way through the pitch-black ashes, the ground was littered with bodies, limbs torn apart. The deafening explosions had long since destroyed his hearing, and his blood-and-ash-streaked skin was slick as if coated in grease.</p>
<p>Each time he dragged himself across the ground, something soft blocked his path. It was his grandfather’s flesh, his uncles’ heads, and the shoes of cousins his own age.</p>
<p>Yet the boy neither cried nor stopped. Only the fierce pounding of his pulse beneath his throat kept him moving forward.</p>
<p>Relentlessly, he crawled, stepping over bodies, searching the faces of every guest invited to his birthday party. That baby, where was the baby?</p>
<p>The worst bombing attack struck on his fourteenth birthday. The Winter Castle, once the pride of the Solzhenitsyn family, crumbled.</p>
<p>His grandfather, known as the “Brain of Siberia,” and his Korean grandmother—what they’d built together was ultimately reduced to the tragedy that gossipmongers relished.</p>
<p>A noble family, once supporting the Russian crown, has been turned to ashes.</p>
<p>Only one survivor, the Prime Minister’s young grandson, the guest of honor at the party.</p>
<p>“After his release, he’ll likely begin searching for his daughter.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>He hadn’t expected Viktor had a daughter. A pang of unease scraped through him.</p>
<p>After the bombing, the fact that the only heir to the Solzhenitsyn family was underage was as good as a curse. He was left to fend for himself.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s life as a wanderer began then. To escape constant threats, he crawled his way into the hands of South African mercenaries, trading his life for protection and survival.</p>
<p>After leaving Russia, Wooshin’s life became another battlefield of slaughter and survival, yet unresolved grudges continued to pull him back from the brink of death.</p>
<p>“――.”</p>
<p>His icy gaze returned to the woman’s photograph.</p>
<p>The elite terrorist who brought down Winter Castle, resulting in over a hundred casualties—a man currently on death row.</p>
<p>Rigay Viktor, a second-generation Korean and top researcher from Moscow University.</p>
<p>So, this genius monster is looking for his daughter.</p>
