            <p><strong>Chapter 23.2</strong></p>
<p>– Preparation complete, over.</p>
<p>– No issues, over.</p>
<p>– Understood, over.</p>
<p>Through the earpiece, the voices of various operatives came in succession.</p>
<p>Tieng, the VIP client of Blast Agency, was the head of a Thai gang and the largest drug lord in Asia, dealing with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of drugs annually.</p>
<p>They were an organization that produced industrial drugs in Myanmar, smuggled them to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Korea, Japan, and other places, dominating the entire Asian region.</p>
<p>Lee Woo-shin, affiliated with Blast Agency, had a camera attached to his button while carrying out his contractual duties, also fulfilling his mission as an agent of the National Intelligence Service. Every moment was evidence.</p>
<p>Blast Agency must have reaped enormous profits from such large-scale deals. Perhaps they avoided crackdown periods or disrupted smuggling scenes through internal intelligence from the National Intelligence Service.</p>
<p>Smuggling was happening at the border between Myanmar and Thailand early this morning.</p>
<p>The task of the Special Security Team was to protect Tieng, the gang leader. In the event of an unavoidable exposure of the smuggling scene and subsequent attack, they had to prepare an escape route, snipe the opponents, and extract Tieng.</p>
<p>When havung heard of such things, any ordinary people shudder.</p>
<p>Even if they weren’t exceptionally virtuous, it was natural for people to recoil from illegal and dangerous activities. It was the fear of the vile power they possessed, knowing they could easily ruin someone’s life.</p>
<p>The “owl” should have been the same.</p>
<p>But the fact that Seoryeong didn’t even blink an eye upon hearing such atrocities–</p>
<p>She even cleaned up rooms because it was a mess.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin bringing her on a business trip overseas was entirely intentional.</p>
<p>After seeing and experiencing a world where morality doesn’t apply, Lee Wooshin hoped that Seoryeong would voluntarily leave the agency.</p>
<p>Initially, using a business trip as a means to pressure her seemed like a good idea, but he found it harder than expected to get her to open up.</p>
<p>She grew even more cautious of him and was unable to hold a conversation of more than three words, so Lee Wooshin thought that taking her to a dangerous place would make her a little more vulnerable.</p>
<p>During their marriage, she had generally beenoften anxious, fragile and dependent on her husband. Lee Wooshin thought he could manipulate her as easily as before.</p>
<p>However, that misconception shattered with just one conversation. She was only weak and kind to ‘Kim Hyun’.</p>
<p>When he saw her follow a man and effortlessly attract him at the union site, he decided once again to get rid of her.</p>
<p>He put into the shredder their general rule of not interfering old missions with present operations. There was an unspoken warning in his head that he shouldn’t leave her to her own devices anymore.</p>
<p>And he only became more determined as he unveiled her daring side.</p>
<p>It was a deliberate decision to bring her on the business trip to Thailand. Instead of going out on her own, she neither feared nor loathed it. She just carried out her tasks with a blank expression. Her silence was unfamiliar and unsettling.</p>
<p>“Seven minutes tops.”</p>
<p>Then, a young voice broke his concentration. Lee Wooshin looked down at He Channa, who had a flashlight in her mouth and was ripping off the security device.</p>
<p>The special security team had broken into the home of one of Tieng’s longtime subordinates before crossing the border at dawn this morning.</p>
<p>Providing information on internal discord or censorship within the organization was part of the service for long-time customers.</p>
<p>However, nowadays, it was impossible to access information via the internet because they had built their own intranet. The only way was for He Channa to enter the server room in the building and hack it herself.</p>
<p>Eventually, a small metal plate fell off, revealing two ports inside.</p>
<p>“I heard you dug up the identity of the guy who cheated on Han Seoryeong for money.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>He Channa froze before pulling out the laptop from her bag.</p>
<p>“Well… I didn’t do anything bad.”</p>
<p>“The bad thing is what we’re doing right now.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“By any chance, have Han Seoryeong been seriously dependent on alcohol in the past few months?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Channa looked back at him as she connected the black cable to the security device. His white face stood out in the darkness, expressionless and chilling.</p>
