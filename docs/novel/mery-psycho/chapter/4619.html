            <p><strong>Chapter 140.1</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong stood on her tiptoes and clung to him, gripping his back—it felt even firmer than she remembered.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the time apart, but he devoured her like a starving man. Their jaws parted naturally, tongues tangled, lips bitten. She had lost count of how many times they locked together.</p>
<p>“Nngh!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s rough kisses kept pushing her back, but soft, heated moans still escaped her lips. He acted as if he had done nothing but wait for her in this hospital room, relentless and tireless.</p>
<p><em>What an impressive performance.</em></p>
<p>Even as their tongues twisted together, she thought dryly.</p>
<p>They had seen each other just hours ago in the interrogation room, yet he played his role like this was a long-awaited reunion. His calloused hand stroked the back of her neck over and over.</p>
<p>“Haa! Ah!”</p>
<p>His tongue flicked against the roof of her mouth, sending a tremor through her stomach.</p>
<p>For a brief moment, their lips parted. He picked up the discarded sheet and wrapped it around her again before lifting her into his arms.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>Her body suddenly rose, and she instinctively wrapped her arms around his thick, smooth neck.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin locked the door with a limp in his step before carrying her back to the bed. Watching closely, she realized how effortlessly he switched between standing tall and staggering.</p>
<p><em>I once slammed that foot into a chair, but he didn’t even flinch.</em></p>
<p>Recalling that moment made her brows knit together. Only now was she beginning to understand why she had acted so impulsively back then.</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>It must have hurt, yet he endured it?</p>
<p>The more she replayed his unmoving expression in her mind, the more absurd it seemed.</p>
<p><em>Has he always been this ruthless?</em></p>
<p>Well, this was the same Lee Woo-shin who had deceived her—once through marriage, and again through their reunion.</p>
<p>Hadn’t he shamelessly stepped into their marital home, pretending like nothing had happened? Not just anyone could pull off such blatant audacity.</p>
<p>She remembered him walking through the living room, moving through the kitchen like he used to, standing still in front of an empty picture frame…</p>
<p>Seoryeong lowered her gaze to his foot.</p>
<p>“Your foot…”</p>
<p>She had barely spoken when he pressed his lips to her chin and moved again.</p>
<p>His mouth latched onto her skin, sucking hard enough to leave bruises. She stiffened, her tongue suddenly useless.</p>
<p>His lips trailed from her chin, up the bridge of her nose, then to her brow bone and eyelids. Each touch branding her like a silent mark.</p>
<p>Strangely, her eyes stung.</p>
<p>Something swelled inside her, a desperate urge to scream—but she clenched her teeth and swallowed it down.</p>
<p>“Nngh…”</p>
<p>Maybe, in the end, he was still the same instructor she had always known.</p>
<p>Cold on the surface but always standing by her side.</p>
<p>Harsh, yet unfailingly kind.</p>
<p>Even in his battered state, he had sprinted across the rooftop toward her. He had looked so desperate then.</p>
<p>Seoryeong fought to steady her wavering voice.</p>
<p>“I… missed you… all this time…”</p>
<p><em>He can’t know I’ve changed.</em> I have to act like we’re just beginning, like we were always meant to end up together after I dealt with Kim Hyun.</p>
<p>Seoryeong tightened her arms around his neck, hiding her expression. Her reflection stared back at her from the dark window; cold, unfeeling eyes locked onto their own image.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I ever forgot you. Not even for a second,” She said.</p>
<p>“I know you caused trouble in Equatorial Guinea, Agent Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>“Because I couldn’t stop thinking about you… even there.”</p>
<p>“Was it difficult for you?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She had agonized over this for so long. Should she love him more, or should she finish this once and for all?</p>
<p>She had convinced herself she had the answer: sever the past and start over. A clear, definitive resolution.</p>
<p>Yet here she was again, standing at a crossroads, as if escape routes had never existed. Her mind was a mess, her chest still in turmoil, and so, she had to be sure, one last time.</p>
<p>“Mm….”</p>
<p>She clumsily pushed her tongue into his mouth. He hesitated, but she didn’t pull away, licking at his lips without finesse. Even with her one-sided approach, Lee Wooshin parted his lips, catching her tongue and winding his around it.</p>
<p>Their breaths clashed, hot and heavy, saliva mingling as he explored her mouth with unwavering intensity. He didn’t just suck at her tongue, he traced her teeth and gums, claiming every inch with a persistence that sent a shiver down her spine.</p>
<p>By the time her back hit the mattress and their lips finally broke apart, their faces remained mere inches away.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, why are you—”</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed slightly, suspicion flickering in them.</p>
<p>Panic flared in her chest. Before he could say more, she hurriedly shoved her hands under his shirt.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin flinched as if struck by a blade, but he never once looked away from her face.</p>
