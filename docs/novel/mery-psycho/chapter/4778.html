            <p><strong>Chapter 58.1</strong></p>
<p>The sharp voice made everyone stiffen up, and some wiped their damp faces with their sleeves.</p>
<p>Of all times, why did he have to see this? Seoryeong, unable to understand her own emotions, roughly wiped away the tears streaming down her face.</p>
<p>She wondered if frequent dips in the sea made saltwater stick to her. While she was lost in such idle thoughts, Wooshin shook his head.</p>
<p>“Dong Jiwoo, close the infirmary door.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>Realizing this was a cue to leave, Dong Jiwoo quickly escaped without even saying goodbye to Seoryeong, ensuring he wouldn’t get into any trouble.</p>
<p>Left alone, an uncomfortable silence filled the infirmary.</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong, why were you crying?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t crying.”</p>
<p>His eyebrow twitched at her dry tone. Unlike his usual relaxed demeanor, his gaze was serious as he examined her reddened eyes.</p>
<p>She caught a faint scent of shower gel, suggesting he had just washed. The refreshing scent made her think of her own unkempt state—she hadn’t washed for a week, hadn’t brushed her teeth, and might even smell of urine.</p>
<p>The story Dong Jiwoo had told her was also on her mind. <em>Had he truly carried her here?</em></p>
<p>She knew she should thank him, but she hesitated, afraid it would confirm she was half-conscious at the time.</p>
<p>Considering he already disliked female soldiers, Seoryeong clenched her jaw and kept her mouth shut for a moment.</p>
<p>“If you weren’t crying—.” The instructor, who looked immaculate, finally spoke with a smirk. “If you weren’t crying, why are only your eyelashes wet when you didn’t even wash your face?”</p>
<p>He spoke each word with deliberate emphasis.</p>
<p>“Did the guy who just left lick your eyeballs?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Did he at least wipe your eyes with a wet towel?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Don’t let your ego get the best of you in front of your instructors”</p>
<p>His condescending attitude annoyed Seoryeong, making her retort sharply.</p>
<p>“I really wasn’t crying, it was just water. Like there’s cold sweat, I just had cold water coming out.”</p>
<p>Wooshin bit his lower lip and let out a laugh. But he quickly wiped away the expression and asked nonchalantly again.</p>
<p>“So, how are you feeling?”</p>
<p>“Obviously, I’m dirty and in pain. I want to wash up. So, can I go and take a shower now?”</p>
<p>As she became aware of it, the sharp stench that assaulted her nose made her feel unbearable.</p>
<p>She quickly got out of bed and was trying to tidy up her bedding when she saw him grab the metal footboard of the bed.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin bent down, persistently searching for and meeting her eyes, and asked, “Where will you wash?”</p>
<p>“Of course I’ll go to the shower, did you think I’ll go to the sea?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but starting today, Agent Han Seoryeong is banned from using the living quarters shower room.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Her face twisted in disbelief.</p>
<p>Seoryeong had agreed with her fellow soldiers to use the shower alone during the leftover time after they had showered first. It was inconvenient, but she accepted it, and the instructor knew all about it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, changing this arrangement felt quite unnatural.</p>
<p>“I know you share the time with the other soldiers, but don’t do that anymore.”</p>
<p>“Can I ask why?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Wooshin threw a crumpled piece of paper. “It’s the instructor’s fault for thinking Agent Han Seoryeong was the most vulnerable here.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The truth is, it’s quite the opposite.”</p>
<p><em>What is he talking about?</em> Seoryeong mumbled internally and started to unfold the crumpled paper.</p>
<p>She couldn’t tell what it was, but it seemed he crumpled it with all his might. She realized as soon as she opened it that this was the page Wooshin had torn out last week.</p>
<p>“Don’t you understand? You’re the most dangerous person here.”</p>
<p><em>‘Husband candidate?’ ‘Husband candidate!’ SEX, sex, sexual compatibility, one-night stand, candidate list, ‘Check orally?’ ‘Try tying and touching!’ ‘Attack?’ ‘No, start with arousal.’ ‘Eliminate by length first.’ ‘Carry a measuring tape.’ Seduction, dating apps.</em></p>
<p>A parade of hard-to-look-at words and even obscene drawings of curved genitalia. Even as a partygoer, she looked like someone whose head was full of dirty thoughts.</p>
<p><em>I don’t think I should be caught with this. I wrote all this down in my sleep.</em></p>
<p>Facing her subconscious thoughts made her feel embarrassed, and she glanced at the man with a stern expression on the other side.</p>
<p>“So, when a candidate shows up, you’re going to feed and water them and keep them with you for days on end?”</p>
<p>“….?”</p>
<p>“Han Seoreyong asked me what she would do last time to find her husband.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong remained speechless. He continued, “Your eyes sparkled so much then that I wanted to pluck them out.”</p>
<p>Although he spoke with a tender smile, it didn’t sound like a compliment at all. Rather, he stared at her head as if drilling through it, his gaze unrelenting, making her flinch.</p>
