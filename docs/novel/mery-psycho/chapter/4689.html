        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 103.2</strong></p>
<p>His erect p*nis looked heavy, and the way it moved was almost mesmerizing.</p>
<p>From his straight legs to his muscular calves, his body was like a well-defined sculpture. His buttocks, which looked like they could withstand a knife, and his spine, which was etched like a valley, were both clearly visible, but the scars scattered across his body were also unmistakable.</p>
<p>He covered his lower body with a shirt, and his hand was wiping the wet sheet with his fingertips when the bedroom light suddenly turned on.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, who had returned, was approaching her with a magnifying glass in his other hand, his footsteps eerily natural. At times, he moved with a naturalness that surpassed even that of the homeowner.</p>
<p>“There’s no use talking nonsense.”</p>
<p>The man leaned back against the headboard of the bed, spreading his legs widely.</p>
<p>Without any pubic hair, the base of his p*nis and balls were clearly visible.</p>
<p>The red, swollen glans, the twitching shaft, and the tightly packed testicles. Lee Wooshin lazily stroked himself, leaning his head against the wall.</p>
<p>“Did that husband of yours have this little hair too?”</p>
<p>“He did…”</p>
<p>She replied as though sifting through her memories. She could still recall the sensation of their pubic hair brushing and tangling during their past intimacy.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what difference it will make to look at it with a magnifying glass, but—”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin suddenly lifted her by the waist and sat her on his thigh.</p>
<p>Seoryeong placed her hands on his hard abs to steady herself. The muscles twitched and moved under her touch. She flinched and tried to pull her hips back, but Lee Wooshin wrapped one arm around her slender waist.</p>
<p>“You do your thing, I’ll do mine.”</p>
<p>A finger slipped between her spread legs, and she gasped, looking up at him.</p>
<p>“Damn, you’ve gotten so tight.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin gritted his teeth and urged her on.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of not looking?”</p>
<p>“What’s going on now…!”</p>
<p>“You’re a woman who doesn’t care about me at all, what’s so pretty about that? I’ve been patient and done favors for you, but if you just stare at me with those round eyes, should the instructor resent you or not?”</p>
<p>Two fingers began to penetrate her, spreading her inner walls like scissors. Lee Wooshin shook his wrist in that state.</p>
<p>“Ah, ha, ah…!”</p>
<p>The overwhelming pleasure made Seoryeong clench her thighs. He kept scraping at one spot, deliberately, methodically, moving slowly but never relenting. Her hair stood on end, and despite herself, she gripped the magnifying glass in her hand.</p>
<p>Yet, when her gaze finally shifted downward, it wasn’t to his oddly-shaped organ.</p>
<p>Instead, her eyes focused on his wrist pressed against her entrance, the veins bulging with each movement. The sight sent a fresh wave of heat pooling into her eyes.</p>
<p>“Hah… I think… you’re bigger than my husband,” she whispered breathlessly.</p>
<p>“Seems like he was a decent size too,” Wooshin replied with a chuckle, biting at the edge of her still-unremoved shirt.</p>
<p>“But you see, it’s been a while for me. And this time, I didn’t even take a suppressant.”</p>
<p>“A suppressant?”</p>
<p>“…When I do certain things, I have to suppress it sometimes. Excessive sexual desire can ruin things.”</p>
<p>His thick fingers moved quickly, pressing against her bumpy inner walls. The excitement surged, and the magnifying glass fell with a loud clatter.</p>
<p>“Uh…! But, is this size common?”</p>
<p>“Why, if I say it’s everywhere, will you run away again?”</p>
<p>A hot shiver ran through her as his hand caressed her buttocks.</p>
<p>“Why did you get the tattoo?”</p>
<p>“Who knows.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin raised his eyebrows but seemed reluctant to explain. When he gently rubbed her cl*toris, a tingling sensation spread through her blood-filled lower body.</p>
<p>The unexpected gentle touch made Seoryeong’s lower body twitch. As he thrust upwards, a pinkish fluid flowed down his fingers, soaking her pubic hair.</p>
<p>“Move your hips back and forth.”</p>
<p>“No, ah, ah…!”</p>
<p>The tingling sensation stirred her lower abdomen. Seoryeong shook her head and grabbed his throbbing member. Then, she closed her eyes, just like when she couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>He let out a sigh and took a rough, deep breath. His body was scorching hot, and the bulging veins felt like they were pulsing in her palm. When she awkwardly wrapped her fingers around it, the thick shaft twitched like a living creature.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin grasped her spread labia and cl*toris, and flicked the protruding glans.</p>
<p>“Ha…!”</p>
<p>Just touching it made her palm feel numb, as if it was stuck to her hand. Is this really a human thing?</p>
<p>She tried to gauge its size and weight, grasping the long shaft several times.</p>
<p>Each time, he swelled even more, and the man’s thigh muscles bulged, lifting Seoryeong’s hips.</p>
<p>Unintentionally, she applied pressure, and his glans twitched. Lee Wooshin’s eyes contorted, and he held his breath.</p>
<p>“…That’s enough. I don’t want to get too excited, so let’s not touch it anymore.” He muttered, his voice strained. Seoryeong looked up at him with eyes clouded by excitement.</p>
<p>“Could it be possible to fake a p<em>nis? Like, by inserting a prosthetic into the t</em>sticles and then removing it?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin laughed dryly at her growing suspicion.</p>
<p>“So, you think your husband’s might have been fake too?”</p>
<p>“Maybe, considering the size… Honestly, if he was a foreigner, it’s possible.”</p>
<p>Her words trailed off, and she paused for a moment. Foreigner? Despite the pleasure that was making her mind foggy, she tried to connect the dots.</p>
<p>“I thought he was a pure-blooded Korean…”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If Kim Hyun’s skin was fake, he could be a real foreigner!”</p>
<p>“You’re having all sorts of ridiculous thoughts.” At that moment, Lee Wooshin wet his fingers and slapped her vulva.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s glare was cold and stiff with an almost predatory intensity. His fingers, slick with her arousal, worked relentlessly, the obscene sound filling the air.</p>
<p>Without a word, he stretched out his arm and yanked open the bedside table drawer. The sharp angles of his jaw, the taut muscles in his neck, and the curve of his collarbone stood out as he turned.</p>
<p>Moving with urgency, he retrieved a condom, tearing the wrapper open with his teeth. The faint rip echoed in the tension-filled silence. In one swift, practiced motion, he rolled it on.</p>
<p>Before Seoryeong could process what was happening, he gripped her pelvis firmly, lifting it as though she weighed nothing. Then, without hesitation, he thrust her down with raw force.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>The angry glans pierced her entrance in one go.</p>
