            <p><strong>Chapter 130.2</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong spun around without hesitation—but before she could take a step, someone grabbed her backpack and wouldn’t let go.</p>
<p>It was the young man beside her, suddenly interfering.</p>
<p>“―!”</p>
<p>From that moment on, she didn’t think—she just reacted.</p>
<p>Her body moved on instinct, snapping his twig-like arm with ease. She swept his leg out from under him, forcing him to his knees, and immediately locked his pale throat in the crook of her elbow.</p>
<p>She shouted urgently.</p>
<p>“Don’t come any closer. Just talk from there. I don’t have time to argue with you, Instructor. I was just passing through!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s face stiffened as he watched her retreat, dragging along an innocent bystander.</p>
<p>His sharp gaze lingered on the captured man for a moment before his brow furrowed deeply, a curse slipping from his lips.</p>
<p>For the first time in a week, Seoryeong’s phone buzzed again.</p>
<p>Seoryeong widened her strides, pulling the frail man along while pushing the answer button.</p>
<p>It was the first call she had accepted since that reckless kiss and escape.</p>
<p>“I told you not to come this way!”</p>
<p>— “Got it. Now let go of that guy.”</p>
<p>A low, steady voice scraped against her ear.</p>
<p>— “You’re holding onto some random pervert. Don’t just grab people like that.”</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>— “Listen to me. I’m counting down from three. Let go before I finish.”</p>
<p>His chilling warning bled through the speaker.</p>
<p>Three. Two…</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin narrowed his eyes, watching them with clear irritation.</p>
<p>The young man in her grasp flinched at the threat, squirming violently. But the more he struggled, the tighter Seoryeong held on.</p>
<p>Then, as Lee Wooshin took a step forward, both of them flinched at once.</p>
<p>“Don’t move! Instructor, don’t do anything! If you come any closer, I’ll—I’ll…!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong hesitated for a moment before blurting out,</p>
<p>“I’ll do something drastic right here!”</p>
<p>— “What?”</p>
<p>His brow twitched sharply.</p>
<p>The innocent young man was just as startled. His face flushed red, his shoulders trembling violently—not from fear of her, but from sheer mortification.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin silently clenched and unclenched his fist before reaching down to upright his fallen wheelchair.</p>
<p>As the tension seemed to settle for a moment, Seoryeong quickly got to the point.</p>
<p>“I just need to step out for a bit! I’ll be back soon, so just focus on your treatment—”</p>
<p>— “Where?”</p>
<p>Beyond his hospital gown, his chest rose and fell with controlled intensity.</p>
<p>— “You backed away when I asked you to come with me. And now, all of a sudden, you’re leaving?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong could see his lips press together tightly, but she still couldn’t bring herself to say that she was going to find Kim Hyun.</p>
<p>There was a time when they could sit across from each other at the dinner table and talk about anything without hesitation… but now—</p>
<p>Leaving this man behind in the hospital…</p>
<p>She realized it wasn’t as easy for her as she had thought.</p>
<p>“I’m temporarily assigned to the Beta Team.”</p>
<p>— “What?”</p>
<p>“It’s just for a few days.”</p>
<p>— “You call that an explanation?!”</p>
<p>His dark hair, glinting under the harsh sunlight, swayed as he furrowed his brows. Then, as if seeing something unreal, he ran a hand over his eyes.</p>
<p>His lips curled into a hollow smile. A quiet scoff echoed through the receiver.</p>
<p>— “I gave you time to act like a decent guy, and you wasted it all on bullsh*t.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>— “Meanwhile, I was dreaming about you every night, missing you like a fool. And now, after a week, here you are—clinging to some complete stranger.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t—!”</p>
<p>— “Seoryeong really is disgustingly kind, huh?”</p>
<p>Anyone could tell his voice was laced with sarcasm. She stared at him, stunned by his biting tone.</p>
<p>— “But seeing you like this, strangely enough, the things that were eating away at me just disappeared. Even my headaches are gone. It’s funny, isn’t it? Maybe that’s why I can’t let go of this greed. The more I think about it, the more I realize that becoming the bastard who just ruins everything might be exactly who I’m meant to be.”</p>
<p>A bitter chuckle mixed into his self-mocking words.</p>
<p>— “Just once, I want to live like trash, ignoring whatever the hell you want.”</p>
<p>She didn’t hear the rest.</p>
<p>Even as he stood there under the sunlight, Lee Wooshin looked as if he had sunk into a pit, unable to move. Smirking as he spoke—what was he really thinking?</p>
<p>— “They say if you leave something like this alone, it rots away completely. You need to air it out, change the dressing every day…”.</p>
<p>Even in a crowd, he looked lonely.</p>
<p>Yet, all she could think was that at least he wasn’t recklessly charging toward her.</p>
<p>Still… was it even possible to send someone off with such an ominous farewell?</p>
<p>The young man trapped in her hold had stopped resisting, obediently following along.</p>
<p>As the distance between her and Lee Wooshin grew, Seoryeong spoke impulsively.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a promise. Not yet. Just words.</p>
<p>“Then wait a little longer.”</p>
<p>— “…”</p>
<p>“You said I even showed up in your dreams. Some people never come, no matter how much you miss them. Compared to that, I think I’m pretty nice, don’t you? Take care of yourself. And don’t go thinking about your ex-wife just because you’re mad at me.”</p>
<p>— “…!”</p>
<p>“If you absolutely have to, at least give me a name or contact information first.”</p>
<p>See you later.</p>
<p>She forced a bright, awkward smile.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin froze, as if struck by lightning.</p>
<p>He watched her walk away, his lips parting slightly as a whisper slipped through like a breeze.</p>
<p>— “Should I?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>— “Once my legs heal. And if you come back. Then.”</p>
<p>The sunlight pooled over his bowed head, his neck bent as if weighed down.</p>
<p>Seoryeong had no idea what he meant.</p>
<p>But her heart pounded wildly.</p>
<p>This was their farewell.</p>
