            <p><strong>Chapter 82.2</strong></p>
<p>Lee Wooshin captured her fingers again, like holding a crayon, and dragged her nails down the split muscles of his abdomen. The more uncomfortable she became, the broader his smile grew.</p>
<p>Seoryeong bit her lip in frustration. Even if she tried some move here… the soft bed beneath her made it more likely she’d just get flipped over and countered. Her instincts screamed not to provoke him.</p>
<p>“If you can’t see it no matter what you do, just let it disappear.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“That’s a tactic too, and sometimes, it’s the right move.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous.” When she dug her nails down his abdomen, Lee Wooshin clenched his jaw. A low groan escaped from the veins bulging in his neck.</p>
<p>Yet, as she touched him, she couldn’t understand why her back was tingling with an inexplicable chill. No matter how much she thought about it, her reaction felt strange.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, your eyes are flushed right now.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You’re getting aroused, touching someone who doesn’t look like your husband, or even resemble him.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin yanked her closer by the waist. Their lips were so close now that his fierce gaze nearly swallowed her whole. His rock-hard thigh pressed between her legs.</p>
<p>The lower halves of their bodies became intertwined like roots, and that alone made it hard for her to breathe.</p>
<p>“This isn’t what I meant by this.” She resisted.</p>
<p>“So, what do you expect me to do?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I even took my pants off to make you feel guilty.”</p>
<p>At that moment, her hand grasped something thick. Her face flushed a deep red as she felt the penis jutting out from his underwear.</p>
<p>His skin, aside from the tattoos, was pale with a slight pink hue, but the veins protruding from the surface were anything but attractive, despite the smooth color.</p>
<p>No matter how crooked it seemed, she was only planning to check his p*nis for a moment if it resembled her husband’s not intending to do anything more. Seoryeong tried to pull back in shock, but the hand that was holding hers became the problem.</p>
<p>Her hand, pressing against his organ, started moving up and down, now intertwined with his.</p>
<p>“Officer Han Seoryeong, let’s act like we’re in this together.”</p>
<p>“Are you insane?!”</p>
<p>“Or, let’s pretend this is like moving-in treats.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you learn that when someone moves in, they hand out treats?”</p>
<p>The man’s organ swelled even more in her hand, but the friction made it dry, and Wooshin frowned, clicking his tongue in frustration.</p>
<p>How did it get to this point? Her confusion didn’t last long. He began licking the palm of her hand while keeping their fingers tightly interlocked so she couldn’t move.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The intense heat radiated from his gaze. The satisfaction in his eyes was unmistakable.</p>
<p>He let out a deep breath, wetting and sucking her hand thoroughly. After playfully biting down, he curled her slender fingers tightly around his organ, ensuring they fit snugly.</p>
<p>She had already lost her composure long ago, but now her mind went completely blank. Her heated, wet hand gripped the rigid base of his organ, sliding without hesitation to the tip.</p>
<p>That’s my hand, isn’t it?</p>
<p>The round head and the urethra appeared and disappeared before her eyes, over and over.</p>
<p>All of this, with my hand!</p>
<p>Breathing heavily, Wooshin bit down hard on Seoryeong’s neck like a wounded animal. The wet sound of flesh squelching echoed in her ears.</p>
<p>The once dry tip of his organ became soaked in an instant, giving off a strange scent.</p>
<p>Seoryeong shook her head frantically. She couldn’t compare it to anyone, not even Kim Hyun; she was too overwhelmed by the moment.</p>
<p>Everything about this was different—the atmosphere, the humidity, the tension, the heat. Every sensation she felt was entirely unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Just from seeing and touching Wooshin, her mouth went dry, and her eyes brimmed with heat. She desperately wanted to deny this reaction but couldn’t escape it, and it filled her with despair.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>She wished she could faint on the spot. But Wooshin seemed determined not to let that happen, as he rubbed the firmly closed slit of his organ aggressively with her fingers.</p>
<p>Her hand moved roughly, gripping even his scrotum, until a small amount of liquid leaked out, accompanied by that squelching sound again.</p>
<p>“―!”</p>
<p>During their training, she’d thought of her body as just a tool, nothing more. But now, something faint gnawed at her heart, a subtle reluctance.</p>
<p>What if he actually came… in my hand?</p>
<p>And if that happens.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sharp glint appeared in her eyes. Before things escalated further—before she gave him more leverage—she had to act. Mustering all her strength, she kicked him hard in the head.</p>
<p>But Lee Wooshin, though his head snapped sideways from the blow, merely shook it off, continuing his self-pleasure undeterred.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>What have I brought into my house?</p>
