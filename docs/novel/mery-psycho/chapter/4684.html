            <p><strong>Chapter 106.1</strong></p>
<p>Chirp, chirp―. The cheerful sound gradually woke her from her deep sleep. As she opened her eyes, beams of light filtered through her disheveled hair.</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>But as soon as she opened her eyes, a scream escaped her lips. Specifically, an inexplicable pain surged up from below her waist.</p>
<p>Her legs felt as if they had just undergone surgery, unable to move, and her eyes were so swollen that she could barely open them.</p>
<p>When she tried to move her lips, her vocal cords felt as if they had been scraped by a rake.</p>
<p>In short, her body was in complete disarray. It would have been better to endure another round of hell training and run 7 kilometers.</p>
<p>Her body still had a slight fever, and her breaths were hot.</p>
<p>The previous night, Woo-shin had been relentless, holding her and pressing against her. He had ravaged her from her chest, navel and spr3ad her legs wider as he penetrated her.</p>
<p>When he became h*rd again, he would mercilessly ram into her. From then on, his goal wasn’t necessarily to release. It seemed like he wanted to be connected to her, as if he knew her body like the back of his hand.</p>
<p>Seoryeong buried her face in a pillow as memories of yesterday flashed through her mind. It had been a long day.</p>
<p>Clip, clip, clip.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Clip, clip, clip.</p>
<p>Just then, a sound snapped her out of her reverie.</p>
<p>His sun-kissed back was defined… and covered with scars.</p>
<p>Seoryeong momentarily lost her words. Lee Wooshin, shirtless, was sitting at the end of the bed, surrounded by the tangled blankets and trimming her toenails.</p>
<p>“–!”</p>
<p>When she abruptly sat up, a sharp pain shot through her back. The peaceful morning scene suddenly made her feel nauseous.</p>
<p>Seoryeong frowned as if she had bitten into something bitter.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>At the sound of her raspy voice, his strong neck turned to look at her. He smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Seoryeong found his nonchalance annoying and kept her mouth shut.</p>
<p>His disheveled hair fell over his nose, and he wasn’t wearing any underw<em>ar, with glimpses of his butt</em>cks peeking through the blanket.</p>
<p>Yet, as the sunlight hit him, her vision cleared as if awakening from a long blindness.</p>
<p>The feeling of struggling in betrayal seemed like a distant memory. It was a really strange sensation.</p>
<p>Although her limbs ached as if a cold was coming on, she felt much better. Her gaze lingered on Lee Wooshin, who was hunched over.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Instructor?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong subtly tried to pull her ankle away as she asked. Lee Wooshin caught her escaping foot again.</p>
<p>“I’m trimming what isn’t needed.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you hungry?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, because of someone. But more than being hungry, I’m in pain all over.”</p>
<p>The muscles inside her groin felt like they were being torn apart, and her n*pples, which he had been sucking on all night, still ached. Her swollen entrance stung with every breath she took.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t torture training have been better than this? Even as a dry laugh escaped her lips, the steady click, click of trimmed nails echoed through the room.</p>
<p>He pressed down firmly on her neatly clipped nails, trimming any jagged edges again with precision. He meticulously tidied up even the stray bits of skin sticking out.</p>
<p>After making her sit, lie down, and stand while showing no mercy, why was he suddenly acting so gentle? Seoryeong swept her face with her hands as if washing it.</p>
<p>“Instructor…”</p>
<p>Last night, the fleeting thought crossed her mind that Kim Hyun might actually be a foreigner.</p>
<p>But then again, how could a foreigner become an agent at the National Intelligence Service?</p>
<p>Judging by his size alone, the odds of him being local seemed slim, but still no way. She shook her head in resignation.</p>
<p>“What nationality are you?”</p>
<p>When rumors were circulating about the Special Security Team leader, she vaguely recalled hearing that he might have come from abroad. Her question was met with a sudden chuckle that rippled through the air.</p>
<p>“Finally taking an interest in me?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“After spending the night, you’re curious about what kind of blood runs in this face?”</p>
<p>“That’s not the kind of interest I meant―”</p>
<p>“After going wild together, you figured introductions were in order now?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Why are you so cheeky?”</p>
<p>His smug demeanor was downright infuriating. Just as Seoryeong was about to snap, he cut her off with that ever-present smirk.</p>
<p>“My grandfather was Russian.”</p>
