        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 179.2</strong></p>
<p>Na Wonchang gently rubbed his shoulder, which had been lightly tapped. This was the first time they had met in person after only communicating through messages; the last time had been when he secretly watched from a bench.</p>
<p>The CCTV certainly could not capture even a fraction of the expressions and atmosphere he could manipulate so effortlessly.</p>
<p>Especially those glassy irises. Without realizing it, Wonchang quickly lowered his head. Seeing Lee Wooshin’s broad back, he could not help but recall the funeral of Deputy Chief Joo Seolheon.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lee Wooshin furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>“Wait. I can’t boss Na Wonchang around anymore, can I?”</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>Startled by those words, Wonchang rummaged through his bag and pulled out a ring case. It was a small box made of soft velvet, resembling something prepared for a proposal, causing Lee Wooshin’s eyebrows to arch in surprise.</p>
<p>“Let’s not kneel before a married man.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not it! Deputy Chief left this with me!”</p>
<p>At the mention of the Deputy Chief, Lee Wooshin’s already contorted brow tightened further. He took the box and opened it, revealing a small star-shaped badge inside.</p>
<p>A hollow breath escaped him. This was a brooch used to honor and symbolize the black agents of the National Intelligence Service.</p>
<p>As he stared at the badge with a complicated expression, Na Wonchang added, “You can call on me anytime. Anytime. Team Leader, you’re still unofficially part of Team 1.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>It had been ages since he had submitted his resignation, yet here he was, still being haunted. It seemed Deputy Chief Joo had no intention of letting go, even in death. He felt a wave of discomfort wash over him, crumpling his face.</p>
<p>“Deputy Chief…”</p>
<p>He remembered the last moments of Deputy Chief Joo. There were many questions he wanted to ask, many things he didn’t understand, but he lowered his eyes in silence. Perhaps he didn’t want to know.</p>
<p>At that moment, Na Wonchang, who had been fidgeting, couldn’t keep his fingers still and spoke up.</p>
<p>“Actually… someone has been waiting to meet you for a few months now. They have come once a week, and today as well.”</p>
<p>Na Wonchang glanced towards the door, as if gauging the situation.</p>
<p>“I think it’s because of the Deputy Chief. There’s something that must be delivered in person,” Na Wonchang said.</p>
<p>“Where from?”</p>
<p>“From the CIA.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“They said it’s a confidential document left by the Deputy Chief.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s face hardened as he sensed something was off.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, He Channa rushed to the hospital room, finding Na Wonchang crouched by the door.</p>
<p>“Is it true that he’s awake? This scammer really woke up!”</p>
<p>She shouted in frustration and swung the door open, but Na Wonchang quickly pulled her back and covered her mouth.</p>
<p>“Ugh, umm!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’m really sorry, but just for a moment.”</p>
<p>“Mmm…!”</p>
<p>She squirmed, jabbing her elbow into his ribs. Despite the struggle, Na Wonchang held on tightly, repeatedly apologizing.</p>
<p>“Just give the Team Leader some time….”</p>
<p>His voice was strangely subdued. ‘What on earth was going on?’ Channa peeked through the slightly opened door.</p>
<p>The white curtains fluttered in the open window, and the clear summer sunlight poured in, as if celebrating Lee Wooshin’s awakening from a long slumber.</p>
<p>On such a bright day, Channa, who had been writhing, suddenly froze.</p>
<p>His neck was bent at an unnatural angle, like a broken branch. The hospital corridor was filled with various noises, yet this room felt like time had stopped, shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin had buried his face in some documents.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>From his frozen spine to his shoulders and arms, he didn’t move an inch, resembling someone who had succumbed to frostbite. Only his pale fingers occasionally crinkled the old paper.</p>
<p>Despite that, the silence was unsettling, devoid of even a single breath. Occasionally, a faint groan escaped him, as if he were enduring the pain in his side.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin struggled to lift his head, desperately clutching the last page of the documents. The disheveled papers scattered across the floor, occasionally swept away by the breeze.</p>
<p><em>Could he possibly need painkillers?</em> Channa turned her head.</p>
<p>“What’s… going on?”</p>
<p>Na Wonchang shook his head, pulling his hat down low. If one listened closely, the sound of gritted teeth and muffled groans fell like flesh being carved away.</p>
<p>As the once-sturdy shoulders began to tremble violently, Na Wonchang quickly shut the door. The two of them stood frozen in place.</p>
<p>Red veil.</p>
<p>Channa quietly mulled over the front page of the paper that had been blown away by the wind.</p>
<p>A sense of inexplicable sorrow washed over her, leaving her feeling dazed as she turned her back to guard the entrance of the hospital room.</p>
<p>She remained there until the groans of someone in distress finally ceased.</p>
