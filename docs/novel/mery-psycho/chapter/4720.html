            <p><strong>Chapter 87.2</strong></p>
<p>A cold voice abruptly interrupted. All the agents turned their attention to their team leader, who was now looking their way. Lee Wooshin’s eyes were icy as he gave his next order.</p>
<p>“Everyone, except Agent Han Seoryeong, leave.”</p>
<p>His voice was short and firm.</p>
<p>“Close the blinds and lock the door.”</p>
<p>Once the agents had filed out, the office was filled with suffocating silence, leaving only the two of them behind.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin rested a file he had been holding on the desk, picking it up and putting it down again as he stared intently at her.</p>
<p>Leaving someone standing like a statue while suffocating them with silence was its own form of torture. As Seoryeong swallowed nervously, he finally spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>“You said the priest licked your cheek.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“Which side, left or right?”</p>
<p>As he moved closer, Lee Wooshin roughly grabbed her face and pulled it toward him.</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong, I really don’t like things like this.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“So, look me in the eye and give me a straight statement. Exactly where and how did he lick you?”</p>
<p>“Uh!”</p>
<p>But before she could answer, his thick palm began roughly rubbing her face. Ugh! A groan escaped her lips. His hand was so harsh it felt like he was trying to scrub her skin off. Seoryeong struggled against his grip, but he just frowned, maintaining his stern expression. Unable to bear it any longer, she shouted.</p>
<p>“It was on the left! He even pulled my hair out, but why does that matter?!”</p>
<p>Finally, his aggressive rubbing stopped.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“He pulled your hair?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the temperature in the room seemed to drop by several degrees. Even though Lee Wooshin was wearing his usual fixed lenses, his eyes wavered, clearly shaken by something.</p>
<p>A chilling atmosphere settled over them. As Seoryeong met his unfocused gaze up close, she added, almost as if making an excuse.</p>
<p>“I was a bit startled too. I’ve never seen someone in a priest’s robe act like that.”</p>
<p>“The priest…”</p>
<p>He started to say something but abruptly stopped as if his words had been cut off. Lee Wooshin turned his head to the side, closed his eyes, and exhaled a restrained breath. His tense muscles brushed against her arm.</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes again, his face was blank as he asked, “Did you speak with that bastard?”</p>
<p>“Calling him a bastard, though…”</p>
<p>Seoryeong instinctively clamped her mouth shut, knowing better than to mention the kick to the shin.</p>
<p>“I tried to subdue him right away, but he just licked my cheek and left.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“It was kind of anticlimactic.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strong grip tightened on her face. He’s not going to explode, is he?! She frowned and hit his forearm repeatedly, but it seemed like Lee Wooshin wasn’t even aware of how much force he was using.</p>
<p>Then, without warning, he tilted his head and bit down hard on her cheek. He sucked so forcefully that a circular bruise formed.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>She tried to knee him, but he dodged easily. With an embarrassingly loud pop, he released her flesh.</p>
<p>Her cheek stung, red and marked with his teeth. She stared at him, dumbfounded, her mouth hanging open.</p>
<p>“Did you think I was joking?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I told you to only look at what’s in front of you, not at some other bastard.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her eyelashes trembled. Maybe Lee Wooshin had been off since the moment he was staring out the window earlier. The heat radiating from him seemed to spread to her, making her heart drop.</p>
<p>“Why do you keep messing with my head like this?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea how much you chip away at my patience? You get bitten by some bastard, licked by that priest. And when I’m not around, you get beaten until your veins almost burst.”</p>
<p>His eyes lingered on her fading bruises.</p>
<p>“I don’t like it.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I hate just standing there, watching like an outsider.”</p>
<p>What… what is he saying right now? Seoryeong’s face clouded over, struggling to make sense of his words. This can’t be right.</p>
<p>“I should have everything to myself, but here I am, looking like a fool, not even able to speak up.”</p>
<p>His sharp gaze hardened, as if he had made a decision.</p>
<p>He walked back to his desk, opened the bottom drawer, and pulled out a small handgun. Quickly loading a magazine into the empty chamber, he handed the gun to her. The cold weight of the weapon made her body stiffen.</p>
<p>“I can’t just carve up that cheek, now can I?”</p>
<p>He closed the distance between them. The unfamiliar scent of his soap filled her nose. His large hand gripped her cheek, pulling her close enough that their breaths mingled.</p>
<p>“If you hate it, just shoot me.”</p>
<p>He exhaled harshly, and then his lips crashed into hers, his tongue forcing its way into her mouth.</p>
