            <p><strong>Chapter 76.1</strong></p>
<p>―…Who are you?</p>
<p>Kim Hyun’s voice was tense and hard in response to the man’s rough words.</p>
<p>Seoryeong was too stunned to even think about closing her gaping mouth. What is going on? Her mind froze in disbelief, and her eyelids stiffened as if denying the reality before her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lee Wooshin calmly dealt with Kim Hyun.</p>
<p>“This sleazy con artist—where does he get off running his mouth like that?”</p>
<p>―…</p>
<p>“Saying he’s sorry for leaving, that he was sincere about the marriage.”</p>
<p>With a sneer, Lee Wooshin leaned on the dining table, his shoulder twitching from the pressure. The man, who had just tortured someone with cooking oil while wearing a spotless coat, casually wiped his greasy hands.</p>
<p>“Loved her? Sure.”</p>
<p>A dry chuckle slipped through his lips. His head hung low, his breathing noticeably heavier. It seemed as though he was suppressing a wave of nausea.</p>
<p>He pressed down on the phone screen in his hand as if he could choke the life out of it.</p>
<p>“Funny how easy those words come to you.”</p>
<p>―Seoryeong, are you there? Who is this person?</p>
<p>Her husband’s subdued voice snapped Seoryeong out of her daze, and she quickly averted her gaze from Lee Wooshin.</p>
<p>Facing a situation that had completely derailed her plan, her mind struggled to keep up. Despite this, she knew she had to take control of the chaos.</p>
<p>As she cautiously approached the table, a slippery hand suddenly grabbed her wrist with a vice-like grip.</p>
<p>“Yes, your Seoryeong is right here, next to me. So what are you gonna do about it?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>His eyes gleamed with a cold, firm resolve, silently commanding her not to interfere.</p>
<p>But what is this? He barged in, ruining my entire plan, and now he’s the one acting like he’s in charge? How could the situation flip like this?</p>
<p>“Now that you’re here, why don’t you keep going? Say a little more.”</p>
<p>―…</p>
<p>“Still reminiscing about her skin? Where’d you pick up that cheap line from? Did you come up with that yourself, or did someone write it for you? It’s almost laughable. Is gaslighting really the best you can do from your so-called superior position?”</p>
<p>―…Stop interrupting. This is an important conversation.</p>
<p>“What conversation?! You think you can talk when you left her looking like this?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s sudden snarl made Seoryeong flinch.</p>
<p>What was once an affectionate call had spiraled into a shouting match. Her mind blanked out again.</p>
<p>“You can try all you want, but nothing you say will change how beautiful Han Seoryeong is.”</p>
<p>―…</p>
<p>“Fine, stay there and suck your thumb.”</p>
<p>―Excuse me, but could you back off? Who even are you to interfere with a married couple’s business? This is between us.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, who had been firing off retorts without pause, suddenly fell silent. His jaw clenched shut mid-sentence, like a street thug unexpectedly caught off guard. The unnatural silence filled Seoryeong with a sense of dread. She instinctively braced herself, glancing at the empty oil container.</p>
<p>The tension spread into the quiet on the other end of the line, where even Kim Hyun seemed thrown off balance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lee Wooshin tilted his head back, staring at the ceiling as he took deep breaths. The rapid rise and fall of his broad chest were clearly visible to anyone watching.</p>
<p>“You ditched her and ran off, right? What kind of couple do you think you are?”</p>
<p>―Please put Seoryeong on the line. If this continues, I could charge you with obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>“I doubt that’s something you should be saying after breaking into a woman’s home.”</p>
<p>―I’ll say it again—if you’re not involved, please step aside.</p>
<p>“Who says I’m not involved?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Lee Wooshin’s gaze rested on Seoryeong. He tilted his head slightly, as if considering his words, then smirked lightly.</p>
<p>His typical carefree and irresponsible humor came spilling out now, just like popcorn that couldn’t be put back into the bag.</p>
<p>“Can’t you see I’ve filled your empty spot tonight?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A horrified Seoryeong shoved at his arm, nearly clawing at him, but he just chuckled, completely unbothered, standing firm like a deeply rooted post.</p>
<p>“When things get tangled up in affairs, it becomes our problem too, doesn’t it, dear husband?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It was over… This game was already lost. Seoryeong stood there, frozen, too shocked to even breathe.</p>
<p>Her mind was burning, her eyes dry from the intensity of the situation. She touched her forehead, glaring at Lee Wooshin, who had completely wrecked her carefully crafted plan.</p>
<p>When did it all go wrong? Was it when Instructor found the cooking oil? No, maybe it was when Kim Hyun made those irritating remarks. No, actually it might’ve been the moment he rang the doorbell.</p>
