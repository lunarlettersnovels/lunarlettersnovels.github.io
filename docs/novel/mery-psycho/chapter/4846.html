            <p><strong>Chapter 23.1</strong></p>
<p>“Do you know Jeong Pil-gyu, who’s in the special reconnaissance team?”</p>
<p>“Of course…!”</p>
<p>However, contrary to the answer, Channa awkwardly scratched her lips.</p>
<p>“My brother-in-law left the National Intelligence Service and joined this company with me. But, you know, my skills aren’t just average, right? So I insisted on joining the team that pays the most.”</p>
<p>“Do you often go on business trips like this?”</p>
<p>Channa nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Usually, I work remotely from the office, but this time, I had to break through security devices myself, so I had no choice.”</p>
<p>Now the two of them turned into an alley lined with all sorts of souvenirs.</p>
<p>“Channa, I really like this company.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, there are more annoying people than I thought, and they do a lot of bad things.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I find that hopeful.”</p>
<p>Channa looked at her with a displeased expression.</p>
<p>“How much do you think my husband, who used to be a National Intelligence Service agent, would hate this?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“And how much do you think Kim Hyun would tremble?”</p>
<p>When Seoryeong let out a joyful sound as if truly enjoying herself, Channa turned her head in annoyance.</p>
<p>“Unnie, you should smile prettily. If you smile like that, it’s scary,” she muttered with a sound that meant she didn’t understand. Seoryeong shivered, shaking her shoulders. Seoryeong suppressed her laughter and looked away.</p>
<p>Just then, a young child holding an old basket was chasing tourists. The child grinned, pushing bracelets of various colors towards them and engaging in street performances.</p>
<p>He must have been around ten years old. He had clear eyes and wearing worn-out clothes, but the patched parts were neatly sewn, and there wasn’t a single dirty spot.</p>
<p>Seoryeong thought that he was a child who received proper care even in poverty. His parents must be doing the best they could.</p>
<p>“Where did you go for your honeymoon, Unnie?”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s mind returned from drifting off while staring at Channa’s question.</p>
<p>“We went to Jeju Island.”</p>
<p>“…Was it nice?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong let out a fleeting smile in response to the cautiously asked question, as if adjusting her collar.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I’ve never had a bad time, especially when I was with my husband.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I don’t know where he disappears to sometimes, but it feels like he’s always by my side. It sounds absurd, but there are times when it just feels like that…. Am I crazy?”</p>
<p>Laughter burst out as Seoryeong glanced briefly at Channa’s face. It was because she seemed too perplexed.</p>
<p>“Just don’t trust anything blindly, Unnie. Not feelings, not instincts, not affections, not even men…. Keep doubting everything. Doubt contracts, doubt consequences, especially if someone compliments you—”</p>
<p>“Maam, you’re pretty!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Then, amidst Channa’s words, a cheerful voice interjected.</p>
<p>“You’re pretty!”</p>
<p>Though hsi Korean was broken, surprisingly, the pronunciation was clear enough for them to understand. The child, who had momentarily caught their attention, was now right in front of  them.</p>
<p>It was when Seoryeong picked one of the bracelets, admiring the simple patterns carved into it.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Instantly, her expression stiffened. The faces around her quickly scanned her face, becoming notably worried.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Well….”</p>
<p>An inexplicable sense of discomfort enveloped her entire being.</p>
<p><em>How do I explain this?… </em>Seoryeong felt a gaze that cuts through her skin. But the unsettling feeling vanished into the crowd without a trace.</p>
<p>Instead of explaining, she roughly pulled Channa’s arm.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, let’s just… go back.”</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Unnie, your expression looks terrifying. You look pale…”</p>
<p>“It’s just that I have a bad feeling.”</p>
<p>A lie.</p>
<p>Seoryeong was breaking into cold sweat, feeling prickles on her skin for no apparent reason, which only made her more flustered.</p>
<p>Seoryeong tightly held onto Channa and pushed through the crowd to return.</p>
<p>From behind, a voice calling her out, “Pretty maam!” but she couldn’t hear him at all. Overwhelmed by a flood of sensations, her vision became dizzy, and her breath caught in her throat.</p>
<p>The roar of motorcycle engines, incomprehensible foreign languages, and the shouts of vendors intertwined, blocking her ears. Due to the sudden sharp sensations, her stomach churned.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>In the chaotic alleyways she hurried through, occasional figures resembling prostitutes wandered about. With glittering tops held by thin straps and hot pants, Seoryeong stole a gulp of air, her neck damp with sweat.</p>
