            <p><strong>Chapter 40.1</strong></p>
<p>“I typically know everything about my subordinates, including their bank account balances. So, I already know that Han Seoryeong attempted to defect.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You said you wanted to work for me. This is the best time to convince me.” He raised one eyebrow sarcastically.</p>
<p>You despicable bastard!</p>
<p>Seoryeong shouted in her head and coughed.</p>
<p>“You’ve hidden a lot.”</p>
<p>What’s the use of cursing him? I’m so cowardly. When she finally admitted it, he turned on the water a little as if he was being gracious.</p>
<p>Gulp. Seoryeong was so feverish that the veins on her forehead seemed to be popping out. But even the trickle of hot water seemed wasteful and unnecessary, so she forced herself to say more.</p>
<p>“My husband was so sweet and kind, I felt like if I lost my temper, he’d run away. I’ve shot people and never had a nightmare nor remorse, and if he knew I was that kind of woman, he’d run away a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“That’s why I did my best to be the perfect wife for him.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the hot water began to pour down her skin.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin stared at her with an unreadable expression, and she only fluttered her eyelashes rapidly without saying a word.</p>
<p>The words that came out of her mouth were heavier and shabby than she thought. She was embarrassed even after she told him.</p>
<p>Then, Lee Wooshin took a step back and said with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Your husband must have been similar, wouldn’t he?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It was a vague statement, but Seoryeong understood immediately. Perhaps he, too, had deceived her, and the perfect image he presented wasn’t his true self…</p>
<p>But she wasn’t eager to accept it without reservation. Unlike her own pretense for the sake of being loved, Kim Hyun’s acting was likely intended to deceive.</p>
<p>It’s the same act of lying, but somehow the motive is different.</p>
<p>Seoryeong washed her face again, harshly. Surely we were in love. The more time passes, the more she realized that all those beautiful memories were just shells with cheap glitter on them. Her throat tightened painfully.</p>
<p>“Promise me you won’t tell anyone about this.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened, and her lips moved hesitantly.</p>
<p>“I mean, if you ever catch my husband, you’ll have to pretend you don’t know, and you’ll have to lie and describe me as obedient, fearful, and gentle.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong stepped out from under the hot shower and took a step toward him as if to lay a stern hand on him, and Lee Wooshin’s black pupils, which were surely lens, fluttered subtly.</p>
<p>“Don’t mention guns, or knives or this training.”</p>
<p>“Why would I?”</p>
<p>“Because I only confessed this to you, and I want you to be responsible with this information.”</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Didn’t you say you’d get revenge if you caught him?”</p>
<p>He wrinkled his brow like he was looking at a puzzle gone wrong, and she nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, but I’d also have sex and seek revenge.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>At the calmly delivered words, Lee Wooshin’s eyebrow twitched. Seoryeong wiped the water droplets from her head to her chin with the back of her hand and added, “If you’re going to be intimate with a woman, it’s much better if she’s familiar with being the one in control. I’d rather not think of my husband as a rapist.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The man swallowed roughly as if his throat had closed up. Despite the tremble in his brow, Seoryeong remained unfazed.</p>
<p>Even if Kim Hyun were to die, she hoped he would die at her hands. All she wanted was Kim Hyun, in any form. Only by getting him back could she exact her full revenge.</p>
<p>Because she hadn’t given up on Kim Hyun in the slightest, sex and revenge were, in a sense, synonymous. Seoryeong stepped back into the shower, her eyes flashing fiercely.</p>
<p>“So if anything goes wrong, I won’t let you off the hook.”</p>
<p>As he stepped out of the shower, she shot a stream of water at his face.</p>
<p>“–!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, caught off guard, glared at her. Only then did a satisfied smile creep onto Seoryeong’s lips. One of his pupils lacked the lens. As expected, it was a gray iris.</p>
<p>The man blinked through wet lashes and covered the missing lens with his palm. His defenselessness made her laugh at him one more time, unnecessarily.</p>
<p>“See, I’m good at being naughty, too.”</p>
