        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 25.2</strong></p>
<p>Yes, just like that. This moment effortlessly alleviated her guilt if she would leave Channa behind. She was under orders, after all.</p>
<p>But still….</p>
<p>“No, I don’t want to do that.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong tore through the kitchen as if tearing off a bandage. She shook off the terrifying temptation that had ensnared her ankle and ran forward, crushing it underfoot.</p>
<p>Her nature was just her nature, but abandoning Channa and fleeing was a different matter.</p>
<p>―Seoryeong!</p>
<p>Then, a sharp scream echoed through the earpiece.</p>
<p>―Do you really want to die by stubbornly clinging to useless pride?</p>
<p>“No…!”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen plenty of idiots dying while I’ve explained the same thing twice. Stop this bullshit and get out right now!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong breathed heavily, feeling a surge of anger inside her. She couldn’t understand why she was so furious at him for instructing her to easily abandon someone. She didn’t want to o bey his command this time.</p>
<p>“I won’t leave her behind, no matter what!”</p>
<p>Her desperate plea seemed to quiet the voice beyond the door.</p>
<p>In truth, he knew very well how Lee Woo-shin’s cold words had harshly trampled on some subconscious part of her.</p>
<p>It was a sense of victimhood from being easily discarded and abandoned by her beloved husband. She wasn’t so insensitive as to not recognize that.</p>
<p>Perhaps risking her own life and acting foolishly might be true. But she didn’t want to succumb to the pretext Lee Woo-shin had given her.</p>
<p>If using and discarding people was so natural, how could she blame Kim Hyun for leaving her?</p>
<p>If there were reasons heavier and more prioritized than life itself, even for her husband. If there were legitimate reasons to abandon a wife—</p>
<p>Then how could she feel unjustly treated?</p>
<p>She hoped Kim Hyun would surpass all those important things and simply love her. She hoped he wouldn’t let her go, even if it meant being stubbornly resentful, doing foolish things as the world said.</p>
<p>Seoryeong suppressed the emotions welling up inside her.</p>
<p>“I have to tell my husband soon that–!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“–this is my heart and my way.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I can’t let go of anything, so I couldn’t let go of Channa either.”</p>
<p>That’s why he had to prove her way first. She would not abandon first, nor would she let go first. She wanted her husband to recognize her lifelong thirst for life.</p>
<p>“Pathetic, begging while being drunk on such emotions. I’ve seen plenty of fools like you, Seoryeong. They’re all gone now, but I’ve seen them.”</p>
<p>For a moment, the man who had been silent burst into laughter, shaking his head.</p>
<p>Although his tone was rude, it didn’t feel bad. Right now, she was surprisingly relying on his voice, speaking as he pleased.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll be the first.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“The first person to talk that crap and still not die.”</p>
<p>Though he couldn’t be seen, it felt like his expression was vividly in front of her. He must be frowning disapprovingly.</p>
<p>Without looking back or hesitating, Seoryeong ran straight to the communal kitchen. The gun she held was heavy, and her legs trembled, but her mind strangely became calm.</p>
<p>There was no intention to die here. It wasn’t reckless. It was just that she wasn’t afraid of the impending physical pain, and she had the confidence not to give up first.</p>
<p>After a while, she found and pushed against the door she had been most familiar with for days. As she forcefully opened the door, the unsettling smell clung thickly to her nostrils once again.</p>
<p>“―Ah, no, no…”</p>
<p>A faint voice simmered involuntarily in her throat.</p>
<p>Channa, lying lifelessly on the floor, looked vaguely in her direction. Seoryeong hurriedly approached and blocked her throat, where blood was gushing out.</p>
<p><em>No. Not Channa. No.</em> The sound of a faint groan escaped her throat.</p>
<p>Channa, with fading light in her eyes, desperately tried to say something. But only gasping breaths came out as she struggled to speak.</p>
<p>“Es…cape…”</p>
<p>“Pull yourself together, Channa. Just hold on a little longer…!”</p>
<p>“Es…cape…”</p>
<p>It was when Channa, choking back tears, pushed Seoryeong’s arm with all her strength.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Clack… Clack…</p>
<p>Channa’s body jolted at the distinct sound of high heels echoing. The leisurely footsteps were drawing closer.</p>
<p>From that moment, Seoryeong couldn’t think of anything else. She quickly locked the door to the kitchen and acted on instinct.</p>
<p>“I won’t let you die alone.”</p>
