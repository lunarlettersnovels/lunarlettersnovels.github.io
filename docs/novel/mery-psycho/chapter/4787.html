            <p><strong>Chapter 53.2</strong></p>
<p><em> </em>Despite narrowing her eyes and staring intently at his pale face, the instructor remained calm.</p>
<p>“When an extremely weak country meets corruption. And when valuable natural resources are entangled with unpredictable local armed groups, mercenaries thrive.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you happy? I’m talking about you.”</p>
<p>When Lee Wooshin smirked, the members straightened their backs even more.</p>
<p>“You’re rolling around here back and forth to make money, right? As long as the price is right, Blast Agency will always provide strong bodies, and you’ll be at the forefront.”</p>
<p>As he crossed his arms over his form-fitting training uniform, his muscles stood out even more.</p>
<p>“Before you get excited about making money, know this. If you end up in hell for doing bad things, the agency won’t take responsibility.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Abandon your neighbor. In this industry, the first commandment is to leave your neighbor behind. There’s no responsibility or salvation here.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin seemed determined to shake up the members again. He noticed a few members’ tense expressions. Some froze, and others just bit their lips.</p>
<p>Then, Seoryeong, who had been mindlessly doodling, retorted.</p>
<p>“If meeting God requires going through the gates of hell, then it doesn’t seem so bad. If that’s the only place to meet, then you have to go. And if you’re going, you should go righteously, happily, and as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s previously indifferent eyes finally turned toward her. The moment their gazes locked, a shared hostility known only to the two clashed like electric wires sparking.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin stared at her without blinking as if frozen.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p><em>Maybe it is for the best he stayed avoiding her,</em> Seoryeong thought, clicking her tongue in frustration. Facing him felt like being trapped again in that dark, damp, but intense room.</p>
<p>She crossed her legs and adjusted her posture. Something about her body felt oddly uncomfortable and itchy.</p>
<p><em>Why does it feel… itchy down there? What kind of PTSD is this?</em></p>
<p>Each time, her instincts urged her to forget. But the tender and safe sex with her husband and the threat from the instructor were at such extremes. Perhaps because of that stark contrast, it was even harder to forget.</p>
<p>It’s natural to forget an orgasm forced by another man. But the situation was so intense that it kept popping up in her mind. The pain was gone, but the unnecessary memories only deepened.</p>
<p>“God, huh—.”</p>
<p>The stare that neither had broken wavered slightly at Lee Wooshin’s even-toned voice.</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong has a peculiar talent for talking about wanting to die quickly.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“Do you think you can meet him if you sit at the gates of hell?”</p>
<p>She slightly squinted her eyes and felt the deeply hidden blade within his watchful gaze. Seoryeong’s wariness rose in response to his suspicious expression.</p>
<p>“Not knowing his real face, how do you expect to recognize him at a glance?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong only remained silent.</p>
<p>“That’s just the face others have drawn for you.”</p>
<p>The instructor was probably talking about a typical god, but her heart dropped with a thud.</p>
<p>As the man continued the subtle staring contest, he nonchalantly turned around and switched on a PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p>When you think about it, his actions and words always transitioned quickly, and Seoryeong usually realized things a step behind him. It was similar to when she was first cut by him.</p>
<p>Seoryeong gripped her pen tightly. <em>He’s still annoying.</em></p>
<p>Earlier, the instructor’s disregard had made her facial muscles tense up, but now those possibly PTSD-related symptoms seemed to improve drastically. It was a strange feeling.</p>
<p>“Blast Agency has contracts with Asian countries like Taiwan, Nepal, Cambodia, Myanmar―”</p>
<p>He continued his explanation, showing some photos. Though his face remained mostly emotionless, it occasionally frowned without context, but his voice was consistently slow.</p>
<p>As she watched him without moving, her eyelids started to feel heavy at some point. Listening to his uninterestingly monotonous voice, she strangely began to feel drowsy.</p>
<p><em>I’m not really suited for desks… </em>Seoryeong forced her drooping eyelids to stay open.</p>
<p>Listening to him, the world seemed truly bizarre. On the opposite side of the world, in Nigeria, female boarding school students were being kidnapped en masse by a cult, and recently, in Sudan, warlords clashed, deploying tanks and fighter jets against each other.</p>
<p>The list of red-alert fugitives and the material on terrorist groups alone filled over a book. Hearing these stories, Seoryeong felt a bit overwhelmed.</p>
<p><em>They say Black agents are the top aces… So where is Kim Hyun, and what is he doing now?</em></p>
<p>He must still be serving and dedicating himself to the country, even after marrying a woman he didn’t love. If he made her feel sincere love, even briefly, he probably would remain kind and diligent. Her groggy mind continued to wander.</p>
<p>But the outside world he roams is so dangerous…</p>
<p><em>Wouldn’t it be better for Kim Hyun to live with me, even if it means some hardship by my side?</em></p>
<p>At some point, the instructor’s voice faded completely, and her heavy head started to nod off.</p>
<p>Just as Seoryeong’s eyelids fully closed, suddenly—<em>thud!</em> The desk shook.</p>
