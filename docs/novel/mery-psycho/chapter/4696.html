            <p><strong>Chapter 100.1</strong></p>
<p>This morning, there was a commotion at Seoul Grand Hotel’s final hall as guests were evacuated. The police searched the main building for two hours, eventually identifying the tear gas assailant as an unemployed male.</p>
<p><em>Click</em>. He switched off the radio irritably.</p>
<p>On the drive home, Wooshin remained silent, creating a tense, stifling atmosphere in the car. It was hard to even strike up a conversation with him in this prickly mood.</p>
<p>Was he pretending he hadn’t heard her suggestion? Or was he just undecided?</p>
<p>Seoryeong absentmindedly fiddled with the blanket he’d roughly wrapped around her, feeling unsure.</p>
<p>But to her expectation…</p>
<p>Back at home, Lee Wooshin slammed the guest room door shut and didn’t come out.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The firmly closed door felt as impenetrable as a fortress gate. Seoryeong couldn’t understand his refusal. She’d thought he’d smugly shrug off his shirt if she suggested they sleep together.</p>
<p>His reaction had been a complete surprise.</p>
<p>She went straight to the fridge, grabbed a beer can, popped it open, and downed it in one go. She opened a second can without taking a breath.</p>
<p>Beer dripped down her chin and onto her chest, but she didn’t care. If she didn’t do something like this, she didn’t think she’d make it through the night with her sanity intact.</p>
<p>Drinking quickly made the alcohol hit harder. Just as she gulped down the beer like water, a strong grip yanked her wrist away. Beer splashed from her mouth, wetting her chin and shirt.</p>
<p>“Stop drinking.”</p>
<p>She shook off the warmth gripping her wrist. Annoyed at him for stopping her, she opened a third can and glared at him.</p>
<p>Wooshin, looking like he was back in instructor mode, placed his hands on his hips.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>His voice was low, like he was giving a warning. Irritated, she grabbed her coat. Calling a taxi on her phone, she opened the main door, only for a shadow to loom over her.</p>
<p>“Where are you going so late?”</p>
<p>“It’s nighttime, so I’m going out.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>He frowned as he asked. She replied, sounding exasperated.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a drink, and I need company.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Someone less uptight than you, someone rougher.”</p>
<p>His breathing turned heavy, but she ignored it, focusing on putting on her shoes.</p>
<p>Wooshin clenched his fists and pressed a hand to the glass door. He looked burdened, his head lowered with a sigh.</p>
<p>“I know you’re struggling, but maybe you could try pulling yourself together.”</p>
<p>“I’m trying.”</p>
<p>“By doing… this?”</p>
<p>He raised his voice, then pinched his nose and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious you’ve been kept relatively safe inside this cage of yours. You’ve clearly never met anyone truly bad. You keep saying naive things.”</p>
<p>“I have, and that’s why I got burned.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Kim Hyun. Who else has been worse to me than him?”</p>
<p>Her voice, dark and sharp-edged, cut through the air. Her gaze burned with a simmering urge to act on something right now.</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s lashes flickered as she tried to rein in her emotions. Sparring with him here was a waste of time.</p>
<p>As she reached for the door without hesitation, a hand shot out and bolted the latch before she could step out. A firm grip held her shoulder painfully.</p>
<p>“You’re not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>She turned to see his shadowed face, tilted in an almost mocking angle.</p>
<p>“If it’s come to this, why don’t we go a round of Krav Maga?”</p>
<p>Krav Maga—combat training they’d learned for survival.</p>
<p>“You’re only thinking so recklessly because you’ve got too much energy to burn. I, as your instructor, can wear you out till you’re gasping. I can clear that cluttered head of yours completely if that’s what you want.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“So instead of drinking and looking for company, get some common sense.”</p>
<p>“Training doesn’t faze me anymore,” She gave a dry, sarcastic laugh, her face flushed with alcohol.</p>
<p>“I just need something stronger to remember. Crying over my husband’s skin, sleeping with some other bastard—if it’s not at least that intense. This stench of decay won’t go away.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Since I understand your version of rejection, please let go.”</p>
<p>Their unwavering gazes clashed in the air. She indicated the hand gripping her shoulder, but his grip tightened like a vise. With a quiet tone and closed eyes, Wooshin warned her.</p>
<p>“Don’t lower yourself like this. Take your hand off the door.”</p>
<p>“And if I do? Will you give me what I want?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He remained silent, his Adam’s apple moving slowly, but his eyes closed in refusal.</p>
<p>She gave a slight shrug, “Fine. I don’t make a habit of pestering people who say no.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Well, sweet dreams, and rest well.”</p>
