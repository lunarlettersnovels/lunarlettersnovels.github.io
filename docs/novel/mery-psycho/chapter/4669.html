            <p><strong>Chapter 114.1</strong></p>
<p>That single, shattering sentence was enough to bring everything down.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin felt like the ground beneath his feet had vanished, like his blood was draining straight out of him.</p>
<p>He froze, unable to breathe properly, as Seoryeong’s face crumpled. One moment, she looked on the verge of tears, and the next, disgust and contempt flashed across her features. Her voice quivered violently as she continued.</p>
<p>“But that doesn’t make any sense.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“How could you be my husband?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“How could you, of all people? After everything we’ve been through together!”</p>
<p>Her voice cracked, breaking off as if her throat had swollen shut. Finally, she screamed.</p>
<p>“How could Kim Hyun stand before me—!”</p>
<p>Her voice, sharp and metallic, erupted in a warped, pitiful cry.</p>
<p>“Teach me, scold me, comfort me! How is that even possible?!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“How could you hand me Kim Hyun’s corpse and then bare yourself to me like this?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“How could you do this to me!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s expression twisted as if he’d swallowed poison. His worst fear crashed down without warning, merciless and inescapable.</p>
<p>He moved his trembling jaw aimlessly, desperate to process what was happening but unwilling to accept it. The bile rising in his throat made his Adam’s apple bob violently.</p>
<p>This is how it ends? Us, like this? Just like this? His ragged breaths scorched his lungs as if they were filled with volcanic ash.</p>
<p>A crushing pain, like a divine punishment for his sins, gripped him without mercy.</p>
<p>“Wa-wait, wait a second, Seoryeong—”</p>
<p>“Don’t call me that! Don’t even think about touching me!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s eyes burned with fury, as if she was aching to stab someone, and she grabbed Kia with ferocious intent.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Kia tilted his head coyly and willingly parted his lips, their tongues soon entangling in a vulgar, lewd dance. Wet, slurping noises filled the air, and Seoryeong deliberately swallowed Kia’s saliva, her defiance glaringly obvious.</p>
<p>“Ha… Sonya, Sonya more!”</p>
<p>“―!”</p>
<p>Even faced with this grotesque display, Lee Wooshin stood frozen, trapped by Seoryeong’s pointed, gun-like stare. His body refused to move, paralyzed as if turned to stone.</p>
<p>As if paying the price for his deceit, his feet felt nailed to the floor, rendering him utterly useless. His fists clenched so tightly that his knuckles protruded, pale and stark.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, stop—.”</p>
<p>Kia pressed his aroused body against Seoryeong’s lower half, moaning as he hastily shed his clothes and tugged at hers.</p>
<p>“That’s enough! Stop it already. Come here, over here.”</p>
<p>Wooshin’s voice trembled under the weight of his escalating rage, but Seoryeong only sneered at him, as if mocking his exposed lies. Her slender fingers brushed provocatively against a narrow crevice.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>The sound of their gasps and mingling heat made Wooshin’s vision boil red. Another man’s saliva dripped from the corners of Seoryeong’s lips, fueling a storm of self-loathing and helpless wrath within him.</p>
<p>Forcing himself to speak through disjointed thoughts, he muttered, “If you stay there, you’ll only end up covered in his blood.”</p>
<p>Even his cold warning failed to stop her. She crossed her arms, pulling her shirt off, baring her chest. Kia immediately buried his face against her skin, frantically devouring her.</p>
<p>“You son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>Unable to restrain himself any longer, Wooshin grabbed a wooden chair and slammed it against the back of Kia’s head. Again. And again. The limited movement he managed felt like an unbearable strain, but it was all he could muster.</p>
<p>Yet, even as the chair splintered, Kia refused to let go. He clung to her, relentless and animalistic, until her tender skin stretched unnaturally beneath his grip.</p>
<p>Wooshin watched, his wife’s crimson-stained skin crushed under another man’s depraved hunger. Seoryeong squeezed her eyes shut, her face contorting, while Kia reveled in his assault.</p>
<p>That bastard!</p>
<p>Uncontainable rage surged within Wooshin, but his helplessness dragged him down. He fixated on Kia’s pulsing carotid artery, yet his body refused to cooperate.</p>
<p>What the hell kind of drug did they use? If he could, he would stab himself to break free of this paralysis. Even so, the obscene, wet noises continued to assault his ears.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, hit me, break me—!”</p>
<p>“Mmh!”</p>
<p>“Just don’t let me see this, for fuck’s sake! Kill me instead—!”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly what I’m doing, ahh isn’t it?”</p>
<p>At that moment, her body flipped abruptly, and Kia pinned Seoryeong down, climbing on top of her. Without any warning, he thrust into her. “Ah!” A gasp escaped her lips.</p>
<p>His greedy hands groped her chest, seeking her lips once more for a messy kiss. Seoryeong locked eyes with her husband but didn’t stop the lascivious kiss. Their lips glistened with shared saliva. A sinful hue tinted her otherwise expressionless face.</p>
<p>“More. Harder! Ah, ah!”</p>
<p>From her earlobes to her collarbone and nipples, her skin flushed a deep red.</p>
