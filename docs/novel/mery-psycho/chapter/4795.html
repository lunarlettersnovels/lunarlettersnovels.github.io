            <p><strong>Chapter 49.2 (R-rated)</strong></p>
<p>Thud! Seoryeong kicked his chest, using the momentum to climb onto his shoulders and squeezed his neck with her thighs. His face turned red as she tightened with genuine malice.</p>
<p>“Good try, but this won’t work. You know that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>When her eyes met Wooshin’s still-smiling face, Seoryeong instinctively sensed her failure. Rip—close by, she heard the sound of fabric tearing.</p>
<p>“You know what’s going to happen to you, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to stop?!”</p>
<p>“No, the one who should surrender is the prisoner here, not the instructor.”</p>
<p>Her pants were ripped. It was a self-defeating move. The situation reversed in an instant, and now he was pinning her thighs down, preventing her from escaping.</p>
<p>“I said you just need to say one word. Just one word.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Say it. Then I’ll stop.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s eyes shook violently. He intentionally tore the seam of her pants at the hip with a knife and forcefully pulled it apart. The pants, torn on both sides, hung in shreds.</p>
<p>Her pulse pounded with fear and shame. At the same time, she instinctively realized she wouldn’t leave this place unscathed. Whatever damage she endured, she wouldn’t be the same Han Seoryeong as before.</p>
<p>He tore her pants with the cold precision of gutting a pig. Each time he did, his forearms became unnecessarily firm.</p>
<p>The same ruthlessness as when he ordered her to abandon He Channa was reflected in his pupils. Cold sweat trickled down her back.</p>
<p>“You perverted bastard…!”</p>
<p>“If this alone makes me a pervert, then I’m wronged as an instructor.”</p>
<p>“If you want to rape someone so badly, go to another room, you dog!”</p>
<p>“Oh—then what about you? Would you rather be with another bastard here?”</p>
<p>“That would be a hundred times better!”</p>
<p>When she retorted without backing down, Wooshin suddenly paused.</p>
<p>“Who. Jin Hojae?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The guy you followed drooling last time.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“—Ah?”</p>
<p>He mimicked her sigh mockingly and furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>“What, would you feel better if he tore your pants instead? Because he looks like your husband? That rustic guy? Seems being a prisoner has made your taste pretty lousy.”</p>
<p>“What? Rustic?”</p>
<p>“If you like someone big and looking like a rock, there’s something wrong with your eyes.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…! I did have a problem with my eyes, and my husband looked similar to him!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>A bitter silence suddenly fell between them. Both of them frowned as if they were displeased. It was like spitting in their own faces.</p>
<p>Wooshin clenched his jaw silently and quickly pulled the rope to lower Seoryeong. The difference in eye level is the most common way to assert dominance. As she was lowered, her legs, which had been stubbornly strangling his neck, gradually lost strength and fell away.</p>
<p>“Don’t get mesmerized by Jin Hojae’s face.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…! Let me down…!”</p>
<p>“There are instructors you can stare at and ones you can’t. Jin Hojae is fucking the latter.”</p>
<p>Wooshin supported her legs with both arms, draping them over his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>She struggled in disgust, but now she was truly immobilized.</p>
<p>Her arms were already bound above her head, and her legs, exposing her groin, were completely attached to him.</p>
<p>Due to her precarious position in the air, she needed the hard support of Wooshin’s body, but it felt like a posture meant for penetration.</p>
<p>No, the problem was Wooshin gripping her thighs as if he would never let go.</p>
<p>He quietly lowered his gaze to her exposed underwear. Seoryeong screamed in panic.</p>
<p>“Don’t look! Get away from me!”</p>
<p>Her face burned with humiliation. She screamed and twisted her waist, but this only made him grip her thighs tighter. At that moment, Wooshin suddenly pulled down her underwear.</p>
