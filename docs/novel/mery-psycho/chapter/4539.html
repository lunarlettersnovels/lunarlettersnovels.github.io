        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 181.2</strong></p>
<p><em>Thump, thump.</em></p>
<p>She grabbed a pillow and hit him repeatedly over the head with it.</p>
<p>Even though he could have easily dodged, Kia instead thrust his hips upward, meeting her blows with a gasp.</p>
<p>“Ah, f*ck!”</p>
<p>She felt a hot liquid explode and splatter against her. Seoryeong flinched and pulled her foot away, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that her heel was contaminated.</p>
<p>Jet after jet of cum shot out, covering the mattress and the duvet. Kia, with the milky-white liquid still dripping down his groin, didn’t look relieved, he looked sad.</p>
<p>“Why’d you hit me? Was I wrong?”</p>
<p><em>‘No. You’re probably right. Lee Wooshin was an agent, and I was just a target.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘That’s right. That’s exactly why I was so angry. I couldn’t forgive his deceit.’</em></p>
<p>And yet, hearing it from someone else’s mouth, a strange, defiant urge surged within her, making her want to argue.</p>
<p>“What do you know? Do you have any idea what he did to me? A single outcome can’t contain or explain everything.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Seoryeong squeezed her eyes shut. She felt a profound disgust toward herself for unconsciously trying to defend that man, to defend a relationship built on nothing but lies.</p>
<p>Her breath hitched as if she had swallowed shards of glass.</p>
<p>So, even as she looked at his fully exposed s*x, what washed over her wasn’t arousal, but misery and deep discomfort.</p>
<p>Just then, Kia braced himself against the mattress and looked at her with a desperate glint in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Is it still not okay, even if I’m on my knees like this? Is it absolutely never going to happen with me?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If we got married, had two or three kids, and rebuilt the monastery, then we’d become a family that would never, ever part. Sonya, isn’t that the most perfect, dream-like ending possible?”</p>
<p>“But Kia. You’re me.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“We’re the same.”</p>
<p>There is no more accurate way to put it.</p>
<p>‘We crossed life-and-death lines together. We share the same horrific memories. The kind that, the more you dwell on them, the more your heart feels charred black and shattered.’</p>
<p>‘We are survivors who endured that hell together. He and me.’</p>
<p>She stared out at the pitch-black window as she spoke.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in that part of you. I only see your wounds.”</p>
<p>Her dark, sunken gaze drifted over the countless scars covering Kia’s body.</p>
<p>“So if I were to join my body with yours, it would feel like all those wounds were pouring onto me.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t feel like s*x. It would feel like just another kind of training.”</p>
<p>Kia’s pupils shook.</p>
<p>“How could I have children with that in my heart? I can’t do it.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong, who had come down from under the bed, threw open the window. The cool scent of the forest rushed into the room, and the stuffy smell of night-blooming flowers began to dissipate.</p>
<p>It was then that he locked eyes with Kia, who had been sitting there like a corpse. The moonlight reflected off his irises, giving them a strangely glossy appearance. He innocently lifted the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Oh, there was such a person.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“There was someone who gave birth to a child with that kind of heart and sent them to a monastery.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You know this person too, Sonya. Should I tell you?”</p>
<p>What was he talking about? She frowned.</p>
<p>“If you resemble that person, you can do it too!”</p>
<p>His smile, showing his teeth, seemed somewhat unnatural. Seoryeong looked at Kia’s coal-black eyes with an expressionless face.</p>
<p>Touching Kia’s darkness easily left a mark. She shook her head firmly. Although they had grown from the same roots, so much had changed in the meantime.</p>
<p>“Kia, as you live, someone will appear who will pull you out from that place.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Someone who will rescue you from that pit.”</p>
<p>“You speak as if you’ve met such a person.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong pressed her lips tightly together. At that, Kia’s dark eyes suddenly turned fierce.</p>
<p>She wanted to say that it was all fake, that even the meetings were all false, but her weary lips merely twitched like a fish out of water.</p>
<p>Kia clenched her fists, looking miserable and resentful, and shot back.</p>
<p>“Do you really have to get out?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Do you really have to go outside, Sonya?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand. That’s the special hometown we shared together. So why do you speak as if escaping is the only answer? Sakhalin is where we were born and raised!”</p>
<p>A gloomy shadow fell across his face. Nevertheless, Seoryeong shook her head once more.</p>
<p>Even if they spoke a thousand times, they would never fully understand each other. Still, for Kia, who had shared those times with him.</p>
<p>Seoryeong pulled out a single realization.</p>
<p>“There was another place that completed me.”</p>
