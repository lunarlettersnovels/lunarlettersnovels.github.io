            <p><strong>Chapter 57.2</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong’s eyes suddenly flew open, scanning the white ceiling of the infirmary.</p>
<p>Her face quickly turned pale with black horror and despair. She had no memory. None at all, from some point on.</p>
<p>When she turned her head quickly to look out the window, she saw the darkness fading and the sun rising. <em>Wait, sunrise? How long have I been asleep?</em></p>
<p>Her heart pounded relentlessly, like a broken ball, and she did not need to look in the mirror to see that her face was ashen.</p>
<p><em>“Ugh…!”</em></p>
<p>She suppressed the groan that escaped and struggled to sit up. Even just raising her upper body made her break into a cold sweat as if her entire body was battered and not normal.</p>
<p>Just then, the infirmary door creaked open.</p>
<p>“You…!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong glared at the pale Dong Jiwoo. It was obvious from his attire.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The hell week was already over.</p>
<p>The dirt-smelling figure had been cleaned up, and his dirty clothes were now spotless.</p>
<p>As she stared at him silently, she felt like she had been struck on the back of her head, rendering her speechless. <em>Why don’t I remember anything? </em>Her heart pounded ominously.</p>
<p>“Did I…… not wake up after that? Did you get caught?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t help it; her voice trembled. It felt almost like fear.</p>
<p>“I asked if you were caught.” She asked again, enduring the pain that felt like her whole body had been crushed.</p>
<p>Dong Jiwoo, who was about to say something, suddenly froze. Tears were falling from his eyes, which clearly showed he had just woken up.</p>
<p>He only moved his lips, unable to respond. The tears streaming down his face seemed as meaningless as a leaking faucet.</p>
<p>“Who did you get caught by? Was it Instructor Lee Wooshin? Was it?”</p>
<p>“It’s… How are you?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Why is there no blood or water dripping from you!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong frowned, wondering what kind of nonsense this was. She touched her eyes and then casually wiped the moisture away with her palm as if it were bothersome. During this, Dong Jiwoo quickly corrected the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>“You can relax. You finished Hell Week properly, and now you’re lying here.”</p>
<p>“How could I finish the training if I have no memory of it?”</p>
<p>“You must have been half out of your mind…”</p>
<p>Dong Jiwoo looked at her with a disgusted expression for some reason.</p>
<p>“Still, you got up, moved, talked, and did everything.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Anyway, everyone but you was walking around like a sleepwalker. In the end, Sung Wook-chan was even pushing you. He kept trying to get you to leave, but you can buy him a meal later.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Anyway, it went really well. I didn’t get caught, I didn’t get kicked out, and I finished.”</p>
<p><em>We’ll be out of here soon!</em> At that, Seoryeong let out a breath she had been holding and buried her head in her hands.</p>
<p>This time, she really thought she was going to fall apart. Her frozen blood began to flow again.</p>
<p>“But… Instructor Lee Wooshin carried you here right after the training ended.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Dong Jiwoo, scratching the back of his head awkwardly, spoke up.</p>
<p>“He was the first to notice you fainting.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong frowned and made a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>“He said you were walking properly and answering questions, so he didn’t realize anything was wrong. But as soon as the training ended, Instructor Lee picked you up and carried you.”</p>
<p>Unconsciously, she started lightly scratching near her collarbone.</p>
<p><em>I’ve never been carried by anyone except my husband… </em></p>
<p>Absentmindedly scratching her neck, she left long red marks from her fingernails. For some reason, she gazed blankly out the window at the rising morning. Suddenly, her eyes widened as if she remembered something she had forgotten.</p>
<p>Seoryeong urgently looked around the infirmary and asked.</p>
<p>“Has anyone else been here besides you?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, her vision became blurry again. <em>What’s wrong with me</em>…</p>
<p>Seoryeong rubbed her eyes in confusion, but it kept welling up, as if something inside her had broken.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because her body had reached its limit and snapped once. For the first time, Kim Hyun appeared in her dream. Her husband, who never showed even a strand of hair in her dreams, appeared this time.</p>
<p>She turned her hands back and forth as if he were mesmerized by something, observing them intently, and then held them out in front of Dong Jiwoo’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Look, my hands are clean.”</p>
<p>“What?” Dong Jiwoo seemed not to agree, but Seoryeong remembered the warm towel wiping her hands clean.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem like a dream…”</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, you smell terrible right now, but who’s right next to you wiping your hands? Of course, it’s a dream. How many people have been in and out of the infirmary after training, ah-.”</p>
<p>His expression turned subtle as he stopped talking.</p>
<p>At that moment, the infirmary door opened without warning, and a familiar tall figure appeared.</p>
<p>Seeing the shadow stretch long on the floor before the actual person entered made her heart flutter slightly.</p>
<p>Between his wet hair and his cold eyes were visible. The man who entered suddenly scanned Seoryeong and Dong Jiwoo then furrowed his brows deeply.</p>
<p>“Did he do that?”</p>
