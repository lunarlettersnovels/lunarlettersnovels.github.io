            <p><strong>Chapter 144.1</strong></p>
<p>“Did I hear that wrong? You two, what are you saying?”</p>
<p>CEO Kang Taegon alternated his gaze between the two people sitting side by side on the sofa.</p>
<p>Seoryeong, with her hair neatly tied back to reveal her elegant forehead, glanced sideways at something in Wooshin’s stiff suit. She had stopped by Blast to deliver the white envelope that was tucked inside his jacket.</p>
<p>It had already been a week since she proposed to Wooshin. And in that time, a lot had happened.</p>
<p>The newlywed home, which had been the initial point of reunion, was now so blackened and distorted that it was almost unrecognizable, with hardly anything left that could be used.</p>
<p>Wooshin silently surveyed the ruined home, lingering in front of a wall that had an empty frame.</p>
<p>Seoryeong, disliking the sight of his back, stepped on the debris with annoyance.</p>
<p>She wanted to ask him what he had been like back then, whether their married life had truly been nothing but work to the bone, but she simply couldn’t…</p>
<p>At that moment, she wasn’t in the right state of mind to listen to anyone’s story.</p>
<p>She had a secret about her birth, certainly something negative, and the actions of the black agents for the country had never been honorable to begin with.</p>
<p>Therefore, starting a conversation recklessly would only bring her harm.</p>
<p>Forgiveness was undoubtedly her burden, but she didn’t want that. It felt overwhelming, painful, and as if she might choke.</p>
<p>That was why she found solace in the ruins of this house. It seemed to substitute for the anger that felt like it would explode, and seeing the completely melted interior finally eased her breath.</p>
<p>“I need to investigate that woman further!” The policeman had said. The sound of papers being slammed down irritably was soon blocked by a thick iron door.</p>
<p>Although a police investigation was underway regarding Seoryeong, the only resident and suspect of the villa, she had managed to slip away smoothly.</p>
<p>A light laugh escaped her at the thought that the NIS, which had carelessly manipulated her life, was now dealing with such aftermath.</p>
<p>Still, she had even signed a document promising not to cause any more trouble. If Kim Hyun found out, would he tie her up and get angry again? She glanced at Wooshin, and their eyes met.</p>
<p>“Do you also find me suspicious, Instructor?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Do you think I set fire to my house?”</p>
<p>He intertwined his fingers and suddenly squeezed tightly. His hands still trembled slightly, “For a moment, I thought you might be dead.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“But amidst all that chaos, I managed to get a proposal, didn’t I? I doubt anyone else in the world has received such a proposal. Let’s just think of it as a stroke of bad luck. It doesn’t matter if it was really you, Seoryeong, who burned the house down.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because it reads as if you’ve completely dealt with Kim Hyun.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“That means you’ve won.”</p>
<p>After the house was completely burned down overnight, Wooshin quickly secured a new apartment. Everything proceeded smoothly. Like a real engaged couple preparing for their future, the two had to discuss the overflowing tasks ahead.</p>
<p>Wooshin began outpatient treatment at the new house, while Seoryeong decorated every corner to her liking. She carefully selected items that reflected her presence and filled the space to the brim.</p>
<p>But that was where the problems began.</p>
<p>“Ah!!’</p>
<p>They had been like beasts, constantly entwined to each other. With their shoulders and waists pressed tightly together, they kissed and touched. Even though they still carried the lingering scent of smoke, a sound escaped from deep within her as they came together.</p>
<p>Wooshin didn’t want to be apart from her; not even for a moment. He followed her into the bathroom, unable to focus on anything else, not even the pile of boxes waiting to be recycled.</p>
<p>His desire to keep her close was obvious.</p>
<p>Their moments of intimacy became more frequent, he kissed her until her skin tingled, unfastened her bra whenever he could, and held her with a fervent intensity.</p>
<p>What had triggered this change in him? Was it the proposal, the fire, or both?</p>
<p>Whenever they touched, there was a kind of desperation in him; an urgency that made every encounter feel like a plea not to be left behind. He moved restlessly, like a man always searching, day after day, as if trying to recover something he had lost.</p>
<p>She sometimes cried out in frustration; not just from his relentless closeness, but from the whirlwind of emotions neither of them seemed able to escape.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin was like a mad man, clinging tightly to what he feared would disappear.</p>
<p>The frequency of their s*xual encounters also increased. He showered her with kisses until her face felt prickly, unhooked her bra at every opportunity, and thrust himself inside her.</p>
<p>What exactly was the trigger? Was it the proposal, the fire, or perhaps both? He was always desperate and urgent to make love to her. He greedily in and out of her inner walls.</p>
<p>She screamed out in frustration. Lee Wooshin was like an anxious maniac, moving from place to place, day in and day out, scavenging.</p>
<p>Some days, it was the only thing he did after eating. Their lips would touch whenever they made eye contact, even while doing other things. Even when they slept, their bodies are close.</p>
<p>“Hmph…ugh…!</p>
<p>He couldn’t stop ravaging her. Later, he couldn’t be bothered to pick up his clothes one by one and put them on, so he took them off.</p>
