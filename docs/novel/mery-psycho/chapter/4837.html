            <p><strong>Chapter 28.1</strong></p>
<p>“So, you’re saying you pulled the slide with your mouth?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The man looked incredulous as if he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.</p>
<p>With skin that gleamed without a flaw despite roughing it out in the field more than anyone else and lips that swelled and closed repeatedly, her face seemed like it might have been quite tearful.</p>
<p>Seoryeong found herself inadvertently staring at that sensual face as she elaborated.</p>
<p>“At first, I tried pulling it with my teeth, but it was too hard. So, I tried with my lips, but I didn’t have enough strength. That’s when I tried putting it in my mouth. Not the barrel, just like loading a magazine. The situation was urgent, you know. When you’re in a tight spot, you try everything you can.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“And then, I accidentally bit my cheeks, I think.”</p>
<p>“If someone who’s shooting for the first time loads it wrong and it misfires…”</p>
<p>The man’s face flushed with anger, but he quickly pressed his finger deep beneath his chin.</p>
<p>“It could have blown up right here.” With that, he pressed his Adam’s apple firmly and then lowered his head as if unwilling to continue.</p>
<p>“Where did Seoryeong go wrong, exactly?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Does that husband of yours even know about this? Ignorant, stubborn, and now out of her mind.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“A woman who wants to pretend to be righteous and clever.”</p>
<p>“Of course, he doesn’t know.” Seoryeong shrugged lightly, and he burst into a bitter laugh.</p>
<p>“But my husband… just looking at my face is enough for him. He doesn’t need to know about this kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Seoryeong stared blankly at her injured arm before speaking. Her voice was calm, cold, devoid of any emotion.</p>
<p>“But don’t get it twisted. I didn’t rush in to save Channa out of pure pity. It was more about wanting to criticize my husband.”</p>
<p>“There are moments when you feel like you can just discard people. When I was told to leave Channa behind, pathetic as it sounds, it felt like I was being abandoned again. So, I wanted to prove my point. That you were wrong, my husband was wrong, and I had to be right to make things right later.”</p>
<p>Even in her worn hospital gown, Seoryeong raised the corner of her mouth confidently.</p>
<p>“So, this was all calculated, not some act of compassion.”</p>
<p>Did she really apply pressure to Channa’s throat until she passed out? Lee Wooshin suppressed a scoff.</p>
<p>“Well…the facade was probably true.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin remained cautious, responding to her words as if she were a stranger. His expression, tinged with embarrassment, revealed his true feelings.</p>
<p>Then, Seoryeong awkwardly added something she felt she had to say once she woke up.</p>
<p>“And…thank you for helping me.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“If it weren’t for you…I’d probably be dead. I’m grateful for the gun. And for handling things afterward. Honestly, waking up to find the situation resolved was a bit of a relief…”</p>
<p>“Can you just close that mouth of yours for a moment?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your tongue seems to be the culprit here.”</p>
<p>He was smiling, but his expression was firm, even stern. Without realizing it, he had moved closer to Seoryeong and perched himself on the edge of her bed.</p>
<p>The sudden coldness in his gaze and the proximity of his face caught Seoryeong off guard. But faced with his indifferent and almost hostile demeanor, she could do nothing but remain still.</p>
<p>“Seoryeong, let’s talk business. If it’s not urgent for you to make a living, we should quit this company.”</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>“Your body won’t be able to work for a while anyway. You’ll receive compensation and business trip allowances from the company. With that money, you can afford to take half a year off. Just focus on your treatment and recovery, and don’t even think about coming back to Blast.”</p>
<p>The man spoke without even blinking.</p>
<p>With his firm gaze, it was clear. This wasn’t a suggestion, it was a notification.</p>
<p>“I now have a reason to cut ties with you, Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
