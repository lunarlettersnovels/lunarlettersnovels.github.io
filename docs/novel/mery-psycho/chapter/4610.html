            <p><strong>Chapter 145.1</strong></p>
<p>“Review the file here and then leave.”</p>
<p>The two of them said nothing as they turned their eyes to the tablet Kang Taegon had handed over. Aside from the name, the client’s personal information was completely blank.</p>
<p>As they scanned the operation overview and the indoor layout, Wooshin’s gaze kept straying to his knees. He flipped through the pages as if nothing were out of place. His dry eyes moved rapidly, skimming so fast that two or three pages turned at once, making it hard to follow.</p>
<p>Moments like this reminded her, all over again, that he had once been a black agent for the NIS. The alias he’d abandoned, Kim Hyun, rose unbidden in her mind. Her mood darkened.</p>
<p>“The problem is that there’s a high probability the NIS might be paying attention to this event. We’ve deployed our security team to cover the blind spots of the venue, but Team Leader Wooshin will need to sit among the NIS guests and keep an eye on them.”</p>
<p>Kang Taegon gestured towards Wooshin’s crutch as he gave his instructions.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A strange silence lingered between the two as they returned home.</p>
<p>Seoryeong felt anger rising in her stomach at just the smell of the new furniture in the new house, and it took considerable energy to maintain her composure.</p>
<p>Moreover, Wooshin, who wasn’t even using his crutch properly, held her hand tightly enough that it was starting to sweat.</p>
<p>As the front door lock clicked shut, the man finally opened his mouth. But Seoryeong, who had pressed her hand against his chest first, shook her head and preempted him.</p>
<p>“Don’t say that.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“You were going to say something like ‘stay out of it’ or ‘it’s concerning,’ weren’t you?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t said anything yet,” He defended.</p>
<p>“I can tell just by looking at your lips. Do I need to hear that kind of talk from the instructor again?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, who had been letting out a hollow laugh, silently brushed his hair back. A dissatisfied wrinkle formed on his smooth forehead.</p>
<p>“Having a female bodyguard to closely protect a male client and handle all the protocol alone, doesn’t that seem suspicious? Going into a room with only an old man, helping him dress, taking him to the bathroom, feeding him meals. Even from a superior’s perspective, it’s strange, and from a fiancé’s point of view, it’s just fucking ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Common sense dictates, why would an elderly client specifically request a young female bodyguard?”</p>
<p>“They say he’s not in his right mind,” She bluntly relayed the story she had heard from CEO Kang Taegon. At that, Lee Wooshin, twisting his lips into a smile, pulled her closer. His thigh pressed between her legs.</p>
<p>“If he’s not in his right mind, does Han Seoryeong usually pay more attention then?”</p>
<p>“What…”</p>
<p>“If you had told me earlier, I would have been more persistent, Seo-ryeong.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… let go of this.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong shuddered at the firm thigh intentionally rubbing between her legs. Lately, Lee Wooshin had been reacting strongly to even the smallest things, suffocating her like this.</p>
<p>Even though she was the one who suggested marriage first, and despite enduring his relentless advances and his terrible attitude, Lee Wooshin kept pushing. His behavior touched something cold deep in her chest. Seo-ryeong pressed firmly on his solar plexus and continued.</p>
<p>“The client keeps harming himself, they say.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that one? Seeing something like that, doesn’t Han Seoryeong feel a bit of sympathy?”</p>
<p>“What’s the big deal about that?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“It’s completely normal. Of course, if you stab your body, blood comes out.”</p>
<p>“No, what I mean is… sigh… never mind.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong watched the man who suddenly pulled her into a tight embrace and let out a heavy breath, then quietly added,</p>
<p>“Ambiguity is the worst. If you’re going to discard something, do it decisively. If you want to keep it, hold onto it firmly. But when someone acts in a way that’s neither here nor there, there’s definitely another purpose behind it, right?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin swallowed hard and locked eyes with her again. As he stared at her without moving, the motion sensor failed to detect any movement, and the light abruptly turned off.</p>
<p>The two, shrouded in darkness, only searched each other.</p>
<p>“What exactly did CEO Kang Taegon instruct you to do?” He asked with determination.</p>
<p>“Nothing much. He just told me to report every word the client says without missing anything. It seems there’s some issue with the client’s memory. I don’t know what it is, but from the company’s perspective, everything seems to be treated as information.”</p>
<p>Memory… information… Lee Wooshin’s face hardened coldly as he mulled over her words.</p>
<p>“Do you know why there are so few female bodyguards at Blast Agency? Of course, there were some, but most were hired unofficially, and even those were all sent to Russia. Now, their whereabouts are all unknown.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
