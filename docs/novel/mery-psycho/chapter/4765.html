            <p><strong>Chapter 64.2</strong></p>
<p>“You woke me up in the morning, burned my shoulder, scratched my lips, and now you’re going to tuck your tail between your legs. Who’s in captivity now?”</p>
<p>He looked disapprovingly at Seoryeong’s blood-smeared face.</p>
<p>“Being stubborn is fine, but you need to see the situation to make it strategic. Do you want to end up dying for nothing?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If I were a real enemy, I would have grabbed you first. Then you’d be the one burning.”</p>
<p>His voice was cold as he evaluated her performance.</p>
<p>“Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Yes…” Seoryeong felt humiliated but took his words to heart.</p>
<p>“If you can’t finish what you started properly, you’ll only suffer the consequences like this.”</p>
<p>Their eyes met up close. For some reason, he looked unusually complicated, and just then, a sharp, cold pain hit her face.</p>
<p>“<em>Ugh…! </em>What are you doing…?”</p>
<p>“And don’t smear other people’s blood on your face.” Lee Wooshin started rubbing her face with a handful of snow.</p>
<p>It was hard to tell if he was cleaning her or scouring her like a clam; the icy snow scratched her skin painfully.</p>
<p>“If it’s from someone else’s body, why are you putting it on your face?”</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>“I know what you mean, but it’s a weird habit, so don’t do it.” She tried to turn her head away, but his rough hands didn’t relent.</p>
<p>Just as she clenched her fists again, he suddenly frowned. He lowered his head so close that their noses almost touched, staring intently at something.</p>
<p>His voice was unexpectedly low, almost as if he spoke to himself.</p>
<p>“Do you mean this?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin yanked her collar abruptly. Seoryeong shivered as the cold wind penetrated her skin. He rubbed her neck persistently, as if he had found a foreign object.</p>
<p><em>“Agh!” </em>Seoryeong grimaced in pain, letting out an involuntary groan. Wooshin tilted his head, puzzled.</p>
<p>With a tense hand, he scooped up another handful of cold snow and began rubbing it against her neck, not her face this time.</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s body trembled violently from the cold, and she struggled again. The more she fought, the stronger the pressure on her skin became, burning as if it were scalded.</p>
<p>“You’ve been bitten, Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>His voice was monotone but something ominous enough to make her shiver with fear underlay it. He stared at her intently.</p>
<p>“Some bastard bit you really well.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>At that moment, she remembered Sung Wookchan biting her neck. Her eyes involuntarily darted towards a nearby tree trunk.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Wooshin silently smirked.</p>
<p>“Ah, right there.”</p>
<p>His tone was soft as if soothing a frightened child.</p>
<p>“I can tell it wasn’t a deep stab, but were you bitten anywhere else?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>The man, trapping her with his arms, gazed at her.</p>
<p>“There’s always a sequence, even with these bastards. Where else did he bite you before reaching your neck?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Show me where else you got bitten.”</p>
<p>He exhaled sharply as if chewing on something unpleasant.</p>
<p>“Didn’t he pull your clothes, grope your skin, and suck on you with his filthy tongue?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s face flushed with shame.</p>
<p>“You’re so fucking beautiful; with all those bruises and redness, let’s count them together, so the instructor can give you a cold, hard punishment.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong blinked at Wooshin, who smiled generously.</p>
<p>She had an instinctive urge to flee from this situation.</p>
<p>“But what if your husband sees this?” Lee Wooshin said, almost seething, “That runaway jerk of a husband might come back in a rage, right?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong, clutching a snowball, shoved it into his eye. He wore lenses, which made his eyes vulnerable.</p>
<p>He turned his head quickly, but she pressed on his wrist and flipped their positions.</p>
<p>Finally escaping from beneath him, Seoryeong ran without looking back.</p>
<p><em>Why am I running when I’m supposed to capture the instructor?</em> She wondered briefly. But seeing his figure chasing her like a tiger, all thoughts vanished.</p>
<p><em>Yes, it was because of that face. That crazed face!</em></p>
<p>It made her run until her thighs burned.</p>
