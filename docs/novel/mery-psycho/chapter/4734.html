            <p><strong>Chapter 80.2</strong></p>
<p>This wasn’t a matter of trust, was it? As Seoryeong sat speechless in disbelief, Lee Wooshin knelt down and pulled a new door lock from the duffel bag he’d brought.</p>
<p>She had expected the bag was his, but it hadn’t crossed her mind that it would be filled with tools rather than personal items. Her eyes blinked in surprise as she saw the screwdriver set, each with a different head—Phillips, flathead, hex, star, and triangle.</p>
<p>As he removed the remaining screws and drilled new holes into the door, his face remained expressionless. He seemed to have a knack for household tasks and, now, for this kind of work as well.</p>
<p>He’d been like this a few days ago too. He had roughly cleaned up the mess in the house covered in oil and even handed her various ointments for her face before leaving without a word.</p>
<p>There were countless things she needed to confront him about, but there was no reason to pursue a man who walked away with a frighteningly stoic face. And so, a few days passed by in a blur.</p>
<p>Seoryeong glanced over at Lee Wooshin, who was intently working on the installation. His suit pants were stretched tight without a single wrinkle, likely because of the kneeling position he was in. Her gaze momentarily landed on his muscular thighs visible beneath the fabric, and she quickly turned her head, feeling a sudden flush in her chest as if she had been burned.</p>
<p>“There’s something I’d like you to respect, even if we end up living together,” she said.</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows and glanced at her.</p>
<p>“Outside the master bedroom… there’s a study and closet my husband used. I’ve locked the door, but don’t get curious or try to break in like you did today.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s hands, which had been moving skillfully, paused for a moment. The electric drill he held whirred loudly in the silence. He stared at her with an unreadable expression before swallowing once and turning his attention back to the door lock. His movements resumed as smoothly as before.</p>
<p>Then, with a slight frown, he muttered in a low, indifferent voice, “I feel like I’m Bluebeard’s wife.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It’s a fairy tale. There was a nobleman who told his wife she could roam anywhere in the mansion, except for one room. Of course, she couldn’t resist, and when she opened the door, she found the bodies of his previous wives who had gone missing.”</p>
<p>“That’s a fairy tale?”</p>
<p>“Children’s stories were always more gruesome in the old days.”</p>
<p>Though his tone was casual, his fleeting expression was colder than ice.</p>
<p>“It’s similar, I guess,” Seoryeong replied nonchalantly, resting her chin on her hand. “That room holds my memories—both the smells and the appearance of it.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“So don’t mess it up.”</p>
<p>Without saying a word, Lee Wooshin took her hand and placed it on the door lock’s handle. The touch of their hands was sticky and hot.</p>
<p>In a low voice, he explained that the lock now had a vein recognition system embedded in the handle. It would scan the veins in her palm like a barcode. Seoryeong’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>“Where do you even get something like this?”</p>
<p>“It’s a technology that’s used in more places than you’d think.”</p>
<p>His firm, determined jawline made it difficult for her to question him further.</p>
<p>“No one won’t be able to barge in anymore, so let’s avoid getting your face bruised again.”</p>
<p>The pressure on her palm from the handle was intense. Lee Wooshin pressed her hand down several times, likely to register it in the system. The heightened sensitivity of her skin began to pick up every detail about him.</p>
<p>She could feel the rough texture of his winter suit brushing against her wrist, the unfamiliar dark scent of his cologne, a hint of a strange shampoo, and the quiet yet steady rhythm of his breath. It all became overwhelming.</p>
<p>Feeling dizzy, Seoryeong swung the door open suddenly. Lee Wooshin, still holding her hand, was pulled into the foyer as well. She quickly pulled her hand away, scrunching her nose in frustration. After stepping inside, she felt a sense of relief, as if she could finally breathe in the cramped space.</p>
<p>“You can stay in this room from now on,” she said curtly, pointing to a small room. “Channa stayed here for a bit too, but it’s just a guest room.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s face subtly tensed at the mention.</p>
<p>“He Channa lived here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, just for a little while.”</p>
<p>“In this house?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He furrowed his brow and fell silent. Seoryeong, unfazed, continued speaking.</p>
<p>“And just to be clear, this isn’t cohabitation. It’s a purely professional living arrangement, and it’s only until my husband, Kim Hyun, is found.”</p>
<p>Kim Hyun. Lee Wooshin repeated the name quietly, almost as if testing it on his tongue. Kim Hyun, Kim Hyun. Seoryeong felt a sudden tightness in her chest at the sound of that familiar name spoken in his now-familiar voice.</p>
<p>He glanced around the house with an inscrutable expression and then gave a faint smile. Was it anticipation or anxiety? She couldn’t tell, but the tension between the two emotions stirred within her.</p>
<p>“This house was transferred to me by my husband as a wedding anniversary gift. So, having you here isn’t exactly comfortable. But since we’ve agreed on terms, I won’t make it awkward. Stay as long as you need. Just remember, once this is over, you’ll need to leave.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin nodded calmly, almost as if he’d been waiting for that moment. Without hesitation, he walked over to the balcony and pulled up all the blackout blinds.</p>
<p>Light flooded into the room, starting from their feet, inching upward. Before she knew it, the midday sun was pouring over her. Seoryeong squinted and raised her hand to shield her eyes.</p>
<p>The once-dark house brightened in an instant. Spring might still be far off, but for the first time, she could feel winter drawing to a close.</p>
<p>For so long, she had been unaware of how time had passed. Now, for the first time, she truly felt the changing of the seasons. It was a joy, a rare sense of peace she hadn’t experienced even after regaining her sight.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lee Wooshin turned to her and met her gaze.</p>
<p>“This time, let’s see it through to the end with Kim Hyun.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The sunlight striking her face felt welcome, warm. Even in the uncertain transition between seasons, she was grateful to witness it with her own eyes.</p>
<p>Her chest stirred with a strange, restless feeling.</p>
