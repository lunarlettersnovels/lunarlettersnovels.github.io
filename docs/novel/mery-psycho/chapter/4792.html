            <p><strong>Chapter 51.1</strong></p>
<p>“Haaaah!”</p>
<p>The pleasure overtook the pain, causing her hips to lift. He stared intently into Seoryeong’s eyes, biting and sucking her flesh hard.</p>
<p>His movements became rougher. Their bodies slapped together, and in those brief moments, he pressed firmly on her clitor!s.</p>
<p>Her plump flesh quickly swelled. He shook the taut area while continuing to thrust.</p>
<p>“Ha… Huh… Ha.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Lee Wooshin and Seoryeong locked eyes, and both parted their lips simultaneously. Saliva strangely welled up, moistening their tongues.</p>
<p>Their heated breaths filled the room. Seoryeong couldn’t hold back her moans any longer, and as her lips parted, Lee Wooshin leaned his head heavily against her forehead, clenching his jaw.</p>
<p>Yet, even then, their antagonistic gazes never wavered. Finally, Seoryeong’s body convulsed violently in short intervals.</p>
<p>“Did you come again?</p>
<p>“Ha… Ha…”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin smirked but didn’t immediately withdraw his fingers, which were drenched. She took quiet, exhausted breaths.</p>
<p>At that moment, she felt something thick and heavy pressing near her buttocks. Seoryeong frowned slightly but kept glancing at it.</p>
<p>She thought he was neat and composed from start to finish, but his front was now straining as if it would burst.</p>
<p>The response, so contradictory to his cold demeanor, made Seoryeong lower her legs and wrap them around his waist of her own accord.</p>
<p>A sudden idea struck her.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>But Lee Wooshin’s expression hardened instantly. Instead of pushing her away or resisting, his face took on a peculiar look at her pulling him closer.</p>
<p>He seemed as if he’d been hit in the back of the head or covered in something filthy, feeling utterly repulsed.</p>
<p>“What’s next, fingers or that tattooed d!ck?”</p>
<p>“…What did you just say?”</p>
<p>“Bent, that one.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong, still catching her breath, asked bluntly.</p>
<p>“Take it out, let’s see how much it curves.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong continued speaking, whether he stiffened or not.</p>
<p>“This is a long story, but to sum it up, I don’t know much about my husband’s features. But one thing I know for sure is his pen!s. The tip curved slightly upward like a hook, it was unique.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Before, I noticed yours was bent too, Instructor Lee.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“If I close my eyes and touch it, I can compare them quickly.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin looked utterly confused, as if he had no idea what he was hearing.</p>
<p>“Now that I’ve taken the first step with this sexual torture, if I don’t get into the Blast company, I might just go around looking for bent pen!ses. I thought I could only have sex with my husband, but now it seems my body is just a body…”</p>
<p>Seoryeong looked both puzzled and empty.</p>
<p>“Maybe I have you to thank for that, Instructor. Now I’m planning to sleep with other men too. Only with ones that are bent.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“I think I can tell if it’s my husband or not, just by looking at it….”</p>
<p>“…What? You, what? What are you doing?”</p>
<p>His voice, raspy and barely audible, was dangerously low. It took a moment for Lee Wooshin to regain his senses, his brows furrowing deeply as if he just woke up. His already pale face seemed even more ghostly.</p>
<p>“Well, isn’t this convenient? I guess we can make use of this opportunity for interrogation training, using you as a stand-in, sir.” Seoryeong asked, nodding toward his lower half.</p>
<p>“Can I try that… I mean, may I?”</p>
<p>She had been the one subjected to coercive violence just moments ago. Yet Seoryeong’s eyes had never lacked vitality from the start. Instead, they seemed to be brimming with a newfound enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Whoever had opened this Pandora’s box, Lee Wooshin felt like he was about to be strangled.</p>
<p>“…This lunatic.”</p>
<p>He spat out a coarse curse.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, I told you not to look for a husband substitute here.”</p>
<p>“So what?” However, Seoryeong, who had already regained her composure, showed no sign of embarrassment despite her naked machinations being blatantly obvious. It was Lee Wooshin who couldn’t seem to keep his eyes focused.</p>
<p>For some reason, he pressed his temples tightly, the Adam’s apple bobbing up and down. His outstretched fingers resembled claws, which was somewhat intimidating.</p>
<p>Yet Seoryeong couldn’t afford to miss this rare opportunity. The tables are turned.</p>
<p>“Before dinner, how about quickly taking off your pants?”</p>
