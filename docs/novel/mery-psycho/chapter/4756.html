            <p><strong>Chapter 69.1</strong></p>
<p>The rescue was nothing more than throwing down some rock-climbing equipment.</p>
<p>At that moment, Seoryeong didn’t waste the opportunity to raise Lee Wooshin’s bound wrists high like a torch. It was better to declare and be recognized publicly when people were around.</p>
<p>The instructors’ eyes widened at the sight.</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, who had just freed his hands from her grip, grimaced suddenly as he spoke. He stood up and picked up the equipment.</p>
<p>“Don’t act like it’s over just because someone came to help you.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin reverted to his strict demeanour as if they had never shared a moment of intimacy.</p>
<p>“Why do you think life and death are often decided at the very last moment?”</p>
<p>He asked as he connected a climbing rope to Seoryeong’s waist, fitted metal spikes onto her boots, and handed her an ice tool.</p>
<p>Seoryeong looked into the eyes of the instructor, now devoid of his previously fierce emotions.</p>
<p>“Because there’s no strength left to take one more step.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“That’s why we train hard, even accepting others’ money, to learn how to push ourselves one step further even when we feel like we’re going to die. So, what should you do now?”</p>
<p>His gaze lingered on Seoryeong’s lips for a moment before he continued.</p>
<p>“From now on, Han Seoryeong will climb up alone.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You should get used to saving your own life.”</p>
<p>He swiftly untied the wire from his wrist and threw his coat to her. What had seemed like a disaster turned into training.</p>
<p>He started climbing the ice wall, wearing Jin Hojae’s coat which he had forcibly taken.</p>
<p>Jin Hojae, who had crumpled his sunburned forehead, muttered “Obey orders… obey orders…” under his breath, moving quickly like a veteran. He whispered something to Lee Wooshin, but the sound was soon swallowed by the blowing snowstorm.</p>
<p>Left alone, Seoryeong clumsily struck the ice wall with her ice tool. Even in that chaotic moment, she faintly heard a deep voice.</p>
<p>“Make sure you push yourself to the limit. Without me, you shouldn’t die.” Lee Wooshin did not look back once as he climbed to the top of the cliff.</p>
<p>Each time she struck the ice wall, tiny ice fragments flew into her face. Occasionally, Jin Hojae glanced down to check on her progress but did nothing to help, only showing a troubled expression.</p>
<p>He alternated his gaze between Lee Wooshin and her, opening his mouth to speak, but his words were always interrupted by a sneeze.</p>
<p>After hours of strenuous climbing, Seoryeong finally collapsed onto the ground. Her wrists trembled as if her ligaments were stretched, and her body was completely exhausted from dehydration.</p>
<p>Despite her empty stomach, she felt nauseous, and suddenly, a smooth face appeared upside down above her.</p>
<p>She thought she had been abandoned, but…</p>
<p>“Well done.” Lee Wooshin knelt down and looked at her impassively.</p>
<p>Seoryeong had no strength to move a finger but grabbed his wrist immediately. He responded with a smile and flicked her forehead hard.</p>
<p>“One member was stabbed, another fell, so this quarter’s training ends two days early. Out of all the team members, only Han Seoryeong managed to catch an instructor.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations. When you return to the company, you will be formally assigned to the Special Security Team.”</p>
<p>Hearing the confirmation from Lee Wooshin made her chest swell like a balloon. Countless moments of cursing without thinking passed through her mind like a lantern.</p>
<p>Although I often thought I might have been reckless, I never dreamed that the reward would be this sweet.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lee Wooshin, with a meaningful look in his eyes, grabbed and shook her lips, which were still bleeding a bit from his bite.</p>
<p>“What now? Han Soryeong, you’ll have no choice but to obey my every command.”</p>
<p>“What…”</p>
<p>“In the field, my word is law. How do you, a newbie, plan to defy that?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“The moment you defy me, there won’t be a second chance.”</p>
<p>He released her lips with a strong grip and stood up. His piercing gaze at her, still on the ground, was sharp.</p>
<p>“Of course, your actions will be restricted, and you’ll have to keep any cumbersome promises.”</p>
<p>Wait, that… Seoryeong mustered her strength and sat up.</p>
<p>“Why would I take your hand, Instructor, when I don’t know what orders you’ll give next? That feels like a leash, and I don’t like it. I don’t want my actions to be restricted, and having to keep promises feels burdensome.”</p>
<p>Isn’t that what I said in the infirmary?</p>
<p>“Exactly, why would you take mt hand without knowing what orders I’ll give next? But it seems like you got no other choice.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate, Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong watched him walk away, stunned. Her lips throbbed painfully.</p>
<p>Sigh… She ran her hand through her hair, feeling frustrated. Despite passing the test and winning, she couldn’t shake the strange feeling of having entered the jaws of a shark.</p>
<p>And that was the last time she saw him during the training.</p>
