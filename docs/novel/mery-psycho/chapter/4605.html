        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 147.2</strong></p>
<p>Wooshin said nothing in response to her report. There was only a crackling noise, as if there was a temporary communication issue.</p>
<p>Seoryeong continued to move, keeping a suspicious eye on the busy workers around her.</p>
<p>Thus, it was unexpected when she suddenly collided with a small figure that popped out.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The girl, who had bumped her stomach, was wearing a choir robe. Looking at where she had come from, it was the restroom, and she seemed to be part of the event today.</p>
<p>As Seoryeong quickly approached the child, who was struggling to get up, the Blast communication device she had tucked in her other ear turned on.</p>
<p>– This is Alpha. Confirming one choir member has gone missing. Immediate search required.</p>
<p>“Alpha, this is Bravo. I believe I’ve found her.”</p>
<p>– Move quickly to the worship hall, over.</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>However, the child, clutching her stomach and sweating coldly, did not look well at all. Without hesitation, Seoryeong scooped her up onto her back.</p>
<p>“Hang in there, sweetie. Just a little more…”</p>
<p>The feeling of the prosthetic eye she had put in her pocket swayed oddly. It was then that the child, who felt weightless, tightly hugged her neck.</p>
<p>The round, wide sleeves brushed against Seoryeong’s nose and lips, and suddenly her head spun. There was no time to comprehend what was happening before her knees gave way.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong leaned forward, supporting the child’s bottom. She tried to shake her head to clear her mind, but the child clung to her even more, rubbing her clothes. With a cold sensation, her jaw muscles stiffened, and her strength drained away.</p>
<p>Ah… the realization came too late. It seemed to be a paralyzing poison that was absorbed through the skin.</p>
<p>Thud―!</p>
<p>Ultimately, Seoryeong fell over with the child, hitting her forehead directly. Perhaps she had let her guard down because it was a child, the unexpected impact made her senses duller and duller.</p>
<p>“Ugh… ugh!”</p>
<p>Even though she tried to say something, only saliva dribbled out. It seemed that her tongue was the first to stiffen. She wanted to press the in-ear connected to Wooshin, but her arm wouldn’t easily lift.</p>
<p>As her eyelids grew heavy like bricks, familiar shoes slowly approached her.</p>
<p>They were the exact same shoes as hers.</p>
<p>What on earth is that?</p>
<p>At first glance, they appeared to be the same size, the same brand line of formal wear, and the hairstyle had been carefully styled. She locked eyes with a woman who looked exactly like her, down to her facial features and eyebrow shape.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh!”</p>
<p>What on earth is happening? Am I seeing something wrong? Or is this a hallucination?</p>
<p>Seoryeong stared wide-eyed at the ‘Seoryeong’ who had come close to her.</p>
<p>“I’m starting the owl swap.”</p>
<p>It was a familiar voice that reached her ears.</p>
<p>‘Who is it? Whose voice is that?’</p>
<p>Eventually, ‘Seoryeong’ supported her and dragged her into a nearby room.</p>
<p>It seemed there had recently been a funeral mass in this place, as a thick, large coffin was visible. ‘Seoryeong’ removed all the earpiece that were plugged into her ears and placed her inside the coffin.</p>
<p>Then, she casually adjusted her collar while sticking a round film around her neck.</p>
<p>Seoryeong watched the entire process in a daze. She tried to hold onto the coffin and resist, but there was not a shred of strength in her grip.</p>
<p>“Da… dang—”</p>
<p>Seoryeong faced her own chilling reflection.</p>
<p>“Joo… Seolheon… Deputy!”</p>
<p>What on earth, what kind of trick is this?</p>
<p>It felt as if paralysis was creeping into her respiratory system, her breath came out in harsh gasps, and her voice was stuck, unable to escape.</p>
<p>Joo Seolheon, wearing Seoryeong’s face, leaned over the coffin lid and looked down at her deeply.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on your marriage.”</p>
<p>Deputy Joo seemed to want to say something more, but after a moment, she closed the coffin firmly with a bang.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Trapped in the narrow, dark space, Seoryeong’s breath was cut off. She needed to escape before the paralysis spread throughout her body, but for now, all she could do was scratch at the interior of the coffin.</p>
<p>The only thing she could feel was the cold glass container. The prosthetic eye case of Rigay felt vividly tangible.</p>
<p>She even felt convinced that the coldness of the disinfectant was delaying the paralysis.</p>
<p>“Ugh—”</p>
<p>Seoryeong grasped the case with her entire palm, absorbing the chill. Then, little by little, she pulled her arm out to face the light shining from the edge.</p>
<p>This time, she couldn’t avoid the intricate iris and came face to face with it.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>In that moment, as she saw the shape of a shattered sun embedded against a black background like the universe, each detail of the iris pierced into her mind.</p>
<p>Click—.</p>
<p>That couldn’t be real.</p>
<p>And yet, the sound of an old lock clicking open echoed loud in her head.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a flood of darkness surged up and swallowed her whole.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>The memories came.</p>
<p>Vile, unbearable memories, crashing over her like death itself.</p>
