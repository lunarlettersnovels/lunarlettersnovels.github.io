            <p><strong>Chapter 132.1</strong></p>
<p>“We’re nearing our destination. A full search of the ship is expected soon.”</p>
<p>It had been twenty days since she had boarded the cargo vessel.</p>
<p>The Beta Team leader, despite his graying hair, had the imposing build of an active-duty soldier.</p>
<p>He had never commented on the trouble Seoryeong had caused on the first day, nor had he intervened when tensions shattered within the team.</p>
<p>Some would call it hands-off leadership; others would say he just didn’t care.</p>
<p>“The Chinese military might appear to be keeping this area secure, but in reality, they’re just turning a blind eye, for a price. This kind of arrangement is a lucrative side business for them.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“We’ll be following protocol and playing along. So, keep yourselves in check and don’t give them any excuse to make trouble. If things go south, we’re the only ones who stand to lose. Understood?”</p>
<p>The crew, their faces gaunt after two grueling weeks, snapped to attention and answered in unison. Only Seoryeong lowered her head, a small smirk playing at her lips.</p>
<p>Would things really go the way the team leader expected?</p>
<p>She had asked Channa for more than just a tracking device.</p>
<p>This ship needed to be thoroughly searched.</p>
<p>What Seoryeong wanted wasn’t a smooth passage—it was a bloody confrontation with the Chinese military.</p>
<p>What if China got wind of the fact that Equatorial Guinea’s vice president had been smuggling illicit assets via these waters?</p>
<p>China had been pouring in billions to develop infrastructure in Equatorial Guinea, but the country had no means to repay it, offering only mineral rights in return.</p>
<p>China wouldn’t let this opportunity slip away.</p>
<p>This was their perfect chance to tighten their grip on the vice president—seize his weakness and solidify control.</p>
<p>And with Korean mercenaries tangled up in the mess, things would only get more complicated.</p>
<p>If they dug up the *Kim Jong-Il Award that Equatorial Guinea had received, the issue would spiral into a national security concern, linking them to North Korea. If tensions flared with China, it would turn into a full-scale diplomatic crisis. Either way, the National Intelligence Service would have a serious problem on their hands.</p>
<p>*The International Kim Jong Il Prize (Korean: 국제김정일상) is a North Korean award named after the country’s second leader, Kim Jong Il. It was created on December 24, 2012, approximately a year after his death.</p>
<p>They had already gone after a president’s relative.</p>
<p>They had taken down a deputy director of the NIS.</p>
<p>And if they still refused to hand over Kim Hyun, there was no choice but to climb even higher up the chain.</p>
<p>Channa, who had been raised in a Chinese facility, had countless connections.</p>
<p>“Team leader, over there!”</p>
<p>A piercing alarm echoed across the open sea, freezing everyone on deck.</p>
<p>In the distance, a ship bearing the Chinese flag surged forward at high speed.</p>
<p>A floodlight swept across the waves, illuminating the faces of the crew one by one.</p>
<p>“Interpreter, get over here.”</p>
<p>The team leader moved toward the railing with the interpreter.</p>
<p>Against the dark waters, the red flag with yellow stars loomed closer.</p>
<p>The vessel was a high-speed patrol boat, small but swift—perfect for reconnaissance missions.</p>
<p>Had it been dispatched under direct orders from Chinese authorities? Or was something else at play?</p>
<p>Hidden in the shadows of the night, Seoryeong’s gaze sharpened.</p>
<p>As the patrol boat approached, a group of Chinese came out. A small reconnaissance team climbed up the ladder attached to the ship’s hull.</p>
<p>They wore green-blue uniforms with yellow patches, layered with tactical vests. Rifles slung over their shoulders, they exchanged a few words with the interpreter before breaking into snickers.</p>
<p>They rummaged through every package on board, but their movements were sluggish, and the faint scent of alcohol lingered in their wake.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the team leader handed over a black plastic bag that looked as if it were stuffed with bricks. One of the men peeked inside, confirming the thick stacks of dollars. He then scanned the Beta Team members before suddenly asking,</p>
<p>[“Is that smuggled goods too?”]</p>
<p>His gaze settled on Seoryeong with keen interest.</p>
<p>The interpreter, now pale as a sheet, shook his head furiously.</p>
<p>[“No, no! She’s a crew member traveling with us.”]</p>
<p>[“A woman? On board with you?”]</p>
<p>[“Yes, of course…!’]</p>
<p>[“And you expect me to believe that?”]</p>
<p>[“…!”]</p>
<p>[“You didn’t just bring her along for your own pleasure?”]</p>
<p>Watching the interpreter stammer helplessly, Seoryeong felt a wave of disgust. She didn’t need to understand Chinese to catch the meaning. Some things were obvious just from the way his eyes roamed over her body.</p>
<p>[“Then you’ll need to pay extra.”]</p>
<p>The man clicked his tongue against his teeth.</p>
<p>[“She has a price of her own.”]</p>
<p>[“What the hell are you saying?!”] The interpreter’s face contorted in outrage.</p>
<p>[“If you want to keep her, you pay more. What’s so hard to understand?”]</p>
<p>“Shit!” The interpreter let out a frustrated sigh before turning to the team leader.</p>
<p>“Sir! They want more money.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong remained quiet, only checking her vest pockets. A fixed-blade knife, three magazines, bolt cutters, and brass knuckles—everything was in place.</p>
<p>She flexed her wrists.</p>
<p>It was just another moment where she had to prove herself. Nothing new. Nothing worth getting worked up over.</p>
