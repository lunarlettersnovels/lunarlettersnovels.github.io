            <p><strong>Chapter 159.1</strong></p>
<p>An exotic melody flowed from the radio.</p>
<p>Since the Dagestan region under Russian rule used the Azerbaijani language, Seoryeong picked up a few familiar words as she recalled the vicious bear and the children from the western territory.</p>
<p>Endless stretches of rugged rocks and red reflective barrier zones passed by outside the car window, but Wooshin kept driving faster without saying a word since earlier.</p>
<p>The two had spent about seventeen hours at the airport and on the plane before arriving in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Even though Wooshin draped a blanket over her when she closed her eyes in exhaustion during the flight, it only made her nerves fray further.</p>
<p>Blast, the organization she belonged to, seemed on the verge of collapse for some reason. She had even witnessed the murder scene of a high-ranking NIS official with her own eyes, yet no one was chasing them.</p>
<p>And the shooter who fired the gun was…</p>
<p>“Haah…”</p>
<p>Her pair hadn’t changed at all. It gave her a headache and left a bitter taste in her mouth.</p>
<p>She wanted to ask Wooshin what Chief Joo Seolheon had been thinking when he pulled them out as if protecting them, but now wasn’t the right time.</p>
<p>He was hiding his identity as an NIS agent, so she couldn’t act like she knew.</p>
<p>At least not now.</p>
<p>The strange relationship between Chief Joo Seolheon and Rigay, and Kia watching over them. Se’d probably have to ask Kia directly, since she was involved.</p>
<p>These thoughts clogged her mind, but from the moment she boarded the plane and saw the shrinking land below, everything felt insignificant.</p>
<p>Her ears, resisting gravity, felt clogged, and her turbulent emotions gradually settled. All the chaos had already blurred like a dream.</p>
<p>She fiddled with the rosary Rigay had forced onto her. A bracelet with beads as transparent as glass.</p>
<p>Logically, she should’ve taken it off immediately since it belonged to a dead person, but surprisingly, she didn’t feel that urge. Counting each bead one by one somehow put her at ease.</p>
<p>“Instructor.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong rested her chin against the window, gazing at the scenery before suddenly speaking up.</p>
<p>“Don’t we kinda look like fugitives?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Like criminals on the run.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“In movies, bad guys always run away like this. And then they get unlucky and get caught by cops chasing them for running a red light.”</p>
<p>She deliberately turned to look behind them, but no suspicious cars were following.</p>
<p>Disappointed, she shrugged, and Wooshin, who had been lost in thought since the flight, suddenly chuckled.</p>
<p>Her gaze lingered on the slight curve of his eyes. It felt like his first genuine laugh in a long time.</p>
<p>“Anyway, how are we gonna make a living now?”</p>
<p>“Worried about getting your hands dirty?”</p>
<p>“Honestly, we quit without a backup plan! What about the Special Security Team members? They’re not gonna end up in prison or something, right?”</p>
<p>“If they’re unlucky.”</p>
<p>“Haah!”</p>
<p>As she pressed her forehead against the window, his gaze settled firmly on her.</p>
<p>“Tell me, do I look like someone who doesn’t have money?”</p>
<p>“What kind of question is that?”</p>
<p>“When I first came to Korea, I struggled financially, but I never actually thought I had no money.”</p>
<p>“Is this some kind of mental victory?”</p>
<p>When she asked in disbelief, the corner of Wooshin’s mouth curled smoothly. He didn’t seem inclined to explain further, simply turning the steering wheel with ease.</p>
<p>Despite being in an unfamiliar country, he looked completely natural, prompting Seoryeong to watch him curiously.</p>
<p>“Instructor, have you been here before?”</p>
<p>“I have.”</p>
<p>His unexpected answer made her eyes widen.</p>
<p>“This is also a war zone. A long-standing territorial dispute with Armenia escalated from civil war to full-scale war. It’s under a ceasefire now, but sporadic skirmishes still break out.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong nodded silently.</p>
<p>“They’ve violated the ceasefire agreement three times, firing short-range missiles without warning. When you suddenly suggested coming here for a honeymoon, I got a headache just thinking about it.”</p>
