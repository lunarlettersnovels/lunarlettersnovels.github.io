            <p><strong>Chapter 38.1</strong></p>
<p>There was an awkward silence as they faced each other, their faces covered in snot and spittle, but they were relieved to see each other’s faces, each breathing heavily.</p>
<p>At first, she tried to take in the scene that had come into her clear vision all at once. But she didn’t need to look around.</p>
<p>It was all around her. They were in the middle of the ocean, deep in the night. What sick game is he playing?</p>
<p>“You’re awake, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>And there was one person sitting at the end of the boat, resting their chin on their knees and laughing. The darn Lee Wooshin was cheerfully waving his hand.</p>
<p>Seoryeong spat ot the gag with a grunt. The man turned to the stiffened men and spoke softly.</p>
<p>“I told you I wasn’t going to put you to sleep.”</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, suddenly — splash! Seoryeong heard cries from the men.</p>
<p>Aah! Aargh!</p>
<p>Following the successive screams, Lee Wooshin grinned like a demon.</p>
<p>He was stomping on their chests with his foot, sending them crashing into the sea.</p>
<p>All around her, she could see the desperate struggle to stay alive. It was a captive swim; if they didn’t shake themselves up properly, they would sink and drown.</p>
<p>Lee Woo-shin grabbed Seoryeong’s collar, lifting her. Their faces were so close that their noses almost touched, and their eyes met for a moment, sparking.</p>
<p>“Since you have no balls, shall we do something else instead?”</p>
<p>He taunted, giving Seoryeong’s knee a tap.</p>
<p>“Try hitting mine with your knee. Han Seoryeong used to be good at that.”</p>
<p>“Let go of me…”</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t like that? Then how about you slap me instead?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin circled and stuck out one cheek to her.</p>
<p>“… and I will not let go.”</p>
<p>He grabbed her firmly by the collar and situated her dangerously at the boat’s edge. Her bare feet were already touching the water.</p>
<p>What is the temperature of the sea on a winter night? The cold water jolted her awake. Her teeth were already chattering.</p>
<p>“You didn’t even release my hand and you’re telling me to hit you? Can’t I just push you with my head?”</p>
<p>“As you wish.”</p>
<p>“Does spitting count?”</p>
<p>“….” The speechless man smirked, his face contorting inwardly.</p>
<p>Part of her wanted to punch him, but she didn’t want it to be a slap in the face.</p>
<p>In the end, Seoryeong shook her head. He let out a short “Huh…!” as if preparing to drown her in the sea. He looked puzzled.</p>
<p>He couldn’t figure out why he was frowning when he was the bully himself.</p>
<p>He grabbed Seoryeong again.</p>
<p>“Why are you so stubborn? Were you like this before marriage, too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was, ugh…!”</p>
<p>She gasped and stumbled to her feet. The water was so cold she wondered if she was going to have a heart attack.</p>
<p>She turned her head and saw that the bare-chested men were bobbing feverishly, even with their withered lips. Luckily, no one seemed to have drowned, and the other boats seemed to be in a similar situation.</p>
<p>“Your husband probably feels like he’s been stabbed in the back of the head.”</p>
<p>“Seoryeong exhaled into the pounding cold.”</p>
<p>“I only hid my personality, my husband hid more…! Who’s the real mean one? And what’s wrong with a little pretense?”</p>
<p>Shivering in the cold that pierced through her clothes, he tilted his chin with a strange expression as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a fraudulent marriage?” Lee Wooshin asked.</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m saying; in our case, I was the victim.”</p>
<p>He stuttered as his jaw clacked together. Lee Wooshin’s eyes slowly wandered around the room, dazed. Then, as if to dust herself off, she crinkled the bridge of her nose and loosened her grip.</p>
<p>She clenched her molars tightly as if preparing herself for what was to come.</p>
<p>I’m not going to freeze to death!</p>
<p>A look of despair crossed her face, and the arm shoving Seoryeong hard paused for a moment.</p>
<p>His eyes locked with hers in a strange way that seemed to stretch time.</p>
<p>Seoryeong wanted to punch him in the eye, so his contact lenses fell out.</p>
<p>As if in response to these impure thoughts, her slender body suddenly fell mercilessly out of the boat.</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>The moment she hit the cold water, a heart-shattering shock hit her. Her body plunged downward and downward.</p>
<p>She could see the man’s face blurred in the water’s reflection. Seething in anger, she couldn’t take her eyes off him. Her anger boiled up inside her, blowing away the coldness of her situation.</p>
