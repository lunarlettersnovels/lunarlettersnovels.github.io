            <p><strong>Chapter 167.2</strong></p>
<p>Smoke was rising from his grandfather’s cherished silver pistol. His father bared his bloodied teeth and howled like a beast.</p>
<p>He crawled across the floor, using his elbows, reaching out with arms that could not touch his wife. Then, at some point, the writhing movement came to a halt.</p>
<p>It felt like a horrific nightmare. In the face of an unbelievable scene, something inside him twisted and fell apart.</p>
<p>His father had died, having vomited blood until his shirt was completely soaked red.</p>
<p>All he had done was drink a cup of black tea poured by his grandfather… just that…</p>
<p>It was the first moment he realized that the once-proud mansion was merely a vessel for someone’s stomach.</p>
<p>The breath that his parents had given him felt suffocating, his pride crumbled, his affection shattered, and his trust splintered. It was later that he learned it was a purge.</p>
<p>“Yuri, happy birthday.”</p>
<p>His grandfather stood up, wiping his hands and mouth with a napkin.</p>
<p>“Ivan!”</p>
<p>His grandmother, who had been calling out his son’s name, collapsed.</p>
<p>Every night, she would scream like a madwoman until she was sedated and finally fell asleep.</p>
<p>His grandfather faced that hatred without flinching, silently reinforcing the mansion’s security.</p>
<p>At the funeral, an Orthodox archbishop came to pray, and the black suit the boy wore fit him perfectly, like a private school uniform.</p>
<p>Relatives whispered that he didn’t even cry despite his parents’ death, but when he recalled that day, it was his legs that froze before any tears could fall.</p>
<p>“He’s always been an odd one… Ivan went to medical school without consulting the Prime Minister. The house was in such an uproar back then.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t he a bit reckless?”</p>
<p>“He got scammed a lot. Always talking about investments and stocks, and ended up losing all his wealth… And he didn’t even take care of his only son, just wandering abroad.”</p>
<p>“Then who becomes the heir?”</p>
<p>“Shh! Be quiet!”</p>
<p>The Solzhenitsyn family lawyer handed over a box that contained the belongings left by his parents. People showed interest in the heirlooms Ivan had left behind, but then they turned away with a chuckle.</p>
<p>The only things left for Yuri were a wedding photo and a stethoscope.</p>
<p>The stiff suit that constricted his body, the tie, and the shoes all felt suffocating. He couldn’t bear the Winter Castle, nor his grandfather’s two-faced demeanor.</p>
<p>The boy simply wanted to wear his skates and race across the ice until sunset.</p>
<p>If his cheeks froze and his skin cracked… yes, then perhaps he would feel a little freer.</p>
<p>He fled the mansion and ran to the lakeshore.</p>
<p>Gasping for breat, the lake he reached was still blue and transparent. A vast ice surface with no one dancing upon it. The boy grasped the skate blades without realizing he was cutting into his own flesh.</p>
<p>“Hooh….”</p>
<p>At that moment, an unwelcome shadow loomed overhead. A man wearing black leather gloves turned to the boy, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>An intruder, yet someone who could not be unknown to any Russian.</p>
<p>“You must be Maxim’s grandson.”</p>
<p>He was an old friend of Maxim Solzhenitsyn and a ruler of this country. His face was lined with deep wrinkles, yet his eyes shone brightly.</p>
<p>“It would have been better if you learned to hunt instead of skate. Such a waste of a blade attached to your feet.”</p>
<p>The boy knew that this man was a close friend of his grandfather. Countless photos of them together from childhood filled his grandfather’s study. Still, as he opened his eyes cautiously, the man smiled.</p>
<p>“Child, don’t blame your grandfather too much.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A wave of nausea washed over him, recalling the stillness of his grandfather on that day.</p>
<p>“Believe it or not, Maxim is a pitiful man. I once gave him a very difficult assignment.”</p>
<p>Yet, contrary to the notion of pity, the man was laughing joyfully.</p>
<p>“A high position is a chair for those who must make choices. It’s a seat where only the hardest and most dreadful decisions are made. Therefore, one must study a great deal and bear the burdens of others’ worries. Aren’t you paying a hefty tuition to reach that position yourself?”</p>
<p>He moved his tight leather gloves a few times and spoke slowly.</p>
<p>“Little Solzhenitsyn, would you like to try to unravel this?”</p>
<p>He lightly patted Yuri’s cheek.</p>
<p>“Your grandmother funded the Chechen rebels, and your parents embezzled Russia’s wealth.”</p>
<p>The boy’s fingertips turned cold. Even at just eight years old, he was not ignorant of the ongoing wars with Chechnya.</p>
<p>Last year, a terrorist attack led by Chechen rebels had caused the collapse of apartments and theaters in Moscow, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Russian citizens.</p>
<p>Yet, Chechnya continued to demand independence, and ultimately, the Russian government dispatched troops once again, marking the beginning of the second war.</p>
<p>“It’s treason; this is treason. How could the family of a beloved Prime Minister…”</p>
<p>He frowned.</p>
<p>“So, I gave Maxim the choice directly. Who would he make an example of? Executing the entire family would be too cruel for my old friend Maxim.”</p>
<p>He looked around at the mirror-like clear lake and asked, “Child, whose neck would you have brought back?”</p>
