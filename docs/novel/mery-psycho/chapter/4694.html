            <p><strong>Chapter 101.1</strong></p>
<p>“Do you really hate looking at my face that much?”</p>
<p>The firm line of his jaw remained unyielding, stubbornly refusing to look down.</p>
<p>How was she supposed to interpret a man who lost his erection halfway through?</p>
<p>Seoryeong felt her motivation waning, wondering if she should keep going with a man who displayed such discomfort.</p>
<p>She abruptly stopped, feeling like she was doing him wrong. Letting her doubt take over, she immediately pulled away from him.</p>
<p>As she reached down to pick up her coat from the floor, Lee Wooshin remained in the same rigid position, as still as a statue.</p>
<p>She couldn’t read a single thought from his expression.</p>
<p>“Fine, what’s the point if you can’t even get it up?”</p>
<p>Bang! Seoryeong stormed out, wiping her mouth furiously as she descended the stairs.</p>
<p>“Ugh.” She stuck out her tongue to shake off the unpleasant taste and mumbled a few choice words as she stepped outside, where a cold wind whipped across her face, cleansing her mouth.</p>
<p>Seoryeong glanced at her phone’s notification, which displayed “Arriving in 1 minute.” She would go anywhere — anywhere noisy and dirty enough to drown out her thoughts.</p>
<p>The dark neighborhood echoed only with the occasional bark of a distant dog. Just as she took a step forward, spotting the red headlights of the approaching taxi beyond the alley, a voice stopped her.</p>
<p>“I told you, you’re not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her whole body tipped backward. Her legs lifted off the ground, blood rushing to her head as her view spun upside down.</p>
<p>Reflexively, she gripped his solid shoulders, catching the faint scent of his sweat.</p>
<p>She barely glimpsed his bare feet. Like a bag of luggage, Lee Wooshin had hoisted her over his shoulder, unperturbed by her struggle.</p>
<p>The stairwell lights flickered on and off as they ascended.</p>
<p>“No passenger?” the taxi driver muttered, looking around in confusion as he waited for his absent fare.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Let… let go of me!” Seoryeong shouted as she was pulled into the house and thrown onto the sofa. In the dimly lit living room, she glared at Lee Wooshin with incredulity.</p>
<p>His face was flushed from her elbowing him repeatedly on the way up.</p>
<p>“Instructor, what… what is all this?”</p>
<p>“I decided it’s better to become a trash than let you walk away.”</p>
<p>His expression remained unnervingly calm, and the steadiness in his voice made him seem even more intimidating.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he pressed a large hand firmly against her back, twisting her arms behind her as though to restrain her. Her cheek pressed into the couch.</p>
<p>“What are you doing!”</p>
<p>“Stay right there.”</p>
<p>Without warning, he yanked down her pants. Seoryeong’s eyes widened in shock as she squirmed, but her body was held firmly in place.</p>
<p>Her pants slid down just enough to reveal her lower back, and her underwear was pulled down to expose her pale skin.</p>
<p>“If this is what you wanted—”</p>
<p>Slap! His hand struck her right b*tt cheek.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The sting spread across her skin, and she held her breath. Did he just? Her mind went blank. Did he really just hit me?</p>
<p>“At the very least, I’m better than any other bastard out there.”</p>
<p>“Wait!”</p>
<p>“Why? You’ve had a drink, planned on sneaking off to some shady place to get laid, but this isn’t to your taste?” He mocked her.</p>
<p>“I’d rather do it with a stranger!”</p>
<p>As Seoryeong struggled to push herself up, another sharp slap rang out. This time, his harsh hand lingered, moving slowly over her reddened skin.</p>
<p>It was as if he’s giving her both the pain and the cure.</p>
<p>Seoryeong bit her lower lip in defiance, feeling a strange mix of fear despite this pain being close to what she thought she wanted.</p>
<p><em>Am I insane, letting Lee Wooshin do this? Of all people, him! The reality hit harder than her bold words as the sting of each slap settled in.</em></p>
<p>While she fumbled, another slap struck her skin.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The burn seeped into her flesh. Turning her head, she felt his hand press down on her neck, blocking her view.</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me. I don’t want to see your face right now.”</p>
<p>“Ugh! Instructor!”</p>
<p>“You wanted pain, didn’t you? Then you’ve come to the right place.”</p>
<p>His voice was cold, devoid of emotion.</p>
<p>“Instead of getting someone else’s handprint, why not get mine?”</p>
<p>“What are you!”</p>
<p>“Anyone out there more skilled than me?”</p>
<p>“Ugh!” Another slap echoed..</p>
<p>“No one hits harder than I do. Do you understand that?”</p>
<p>Her heart pounded.</p>
<p>“I’m the one who can hurt you the most.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>I thought he liked me, so he wouldn’t refuse my request. But this was a mistake.</em></p>
<p>She felt her skin swelling with each strike. His hand shifted to soothe her flushed skin, running gently over the reddened area. He’s completely lost it.</p>
<p>“Enough. Let me go!”</p>
<p>“If I let you go now, you’ll just find someone else. Do you think a trash like me has that kind of tolerance?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Another slap blazed across her skin, just as hard and unwavering. He ran his nails over the reddened skin, scratching lightly.</p>
<p>“How does it feel to hurt?”</p>
<p>A prickling sensation spread as if needles pierced her skin. With each touch, the sensitive skin seemed to react, even down to the smallest muscles.</p>
<p>A frown of discomfort formed between her brows, a strange feeling rising within her.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t that wake you up?”</p>
<p>His heated hand traced from her earlobe down her neck, along her back, then kneaded her sore flesh.</p>
