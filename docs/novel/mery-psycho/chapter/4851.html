            <p><strong>Chapter 19.2</strong></p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Is it better for you to work here as well, Miss Han Seoryeong?”</p>
<p>As the light turned green, he hit the accelerator.</p>
<p><em>Wait… That means…</em></p>
<p>“So be on my good side even you hate it, unless you want to have some hard time abroad.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong tilted her head oddly.</p>
<p><em>What is he talking about? So, he’s saying it’s worse to travel with them? They do stuff that weak hearted people can’t handle? Is he crazy? That’s what I want…!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, some strong feeling hit her.</p>
<p>“I’m saying that if you just answer me, I’ll exclude you from the list.”</p>
<p><em>No…! You stupid, I want to go. I have to go. Then I just have to act the way he does like?</em></p>
<p>She quickly finished thinking then she sat straight up.</p>
<p>“What are you curious about?”</p>
<p>“He Channa was someone even the NIS failed to bring in, so was she as good as advertised?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you… Think that NIS was just so shit that they missed recruiting her?”</p>
<p>He flinched but soon softly steered the wheel.</p>
<p>“Did you lose all of your life saving to her?” He asked.</p>
<p>“I lost more than that. People can run away with a lot more things. You’re a bit naïve for someone who’s been abroad so much.”</p>
<p>“… So did you catch the culprit?”</p>
<p>“Why? Do you guys lend a help until I do? Like an employee discount or employee benefit?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The man shut his mouth for a moment and fixed his cap. But there was joy in his voice.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“What can we do, it looks like you were considered a toy, Miss Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p>She stared at him, but she could only see his smooth chin. Seoyeong was oddly annoyed so she said something she didn’t have to.</p>
<p>“No, I’m still looking for him. I’m not giving up no matter how long it takes, months or years. So I don’t think I deserve any sympathy yet.”</p>
<p>He chewed on the candy again.</p>
<p>“The fact that you didn’t realize that you’re wasting your time, means that you got a really bad one on you.”</p>
<p>But Seoryeong shook her head confidently.</p>
<p>“No, he’s the one who should watch out for me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Because our paths are bound to cross eventually,” she explained calmly.</p>
<p>The man regarded her with a look that suggested he found her exceptionally peculiar, scrutinizing her from head to toe with a hint of irritation.</p>
<p>The navigation chimed in to announce their arrival, and he pulled into a parking spot.</p>
<p>The atmosphere inside the car grew heavy. Seoryeong unbuckled her seatbelt and reached for the door handle, but it stubbornly refused to budge. She furrowed her brow and glanced back at him, only to find him smiling as he spoke, “We haven’t properly introduced ourselves yet.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Lee Wooshin, the leader of the special security team,” he introduced himself.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seoryeong jumped out of the car and panted. She felt the fresh air was helping her. She was either really car sick, or it was because of that driver.</p>
<p>It was told that humans can determine those who are right fit with them by smells. It wasn’t a logical thinking, but it was due to genetics.</p>
<p>So this must be natural too. The trunk finally opened and Seoryeong naturally took the lunchboxes.</p>
<p>“I saw you have experience in senior homes so why didn’t you go there?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin asked as she slammed the trunk.</p>
<p>“I thought you’d be uncomfortable working for Blast Agency where there are so many men.”</p>
<p>He was leaning but she could tell how tall he was. He was enough to cover her head.</p>
<p>Kim Hyun was also about that tall. The thought hit her head. But no matter how much she was thinking, she never saw her husband before.</p>
<p>Seoryeong added while fixing her grab.</p>
<p>“It’s same everywhere. Those who you meet while you work, be they be old or young, they’re all shit so is there a point putting ranks?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He flinched.</p>
<p><em>Did I say something wrong?</em></p>
<p>His shaking eyes looked around Seoryeong’s lips.</p>
<p>“There was this grandpa once who just whipped off his pants and called me over, asking me to clean his crotch. They have all sorts of obvious ways of asking,” she recounted with a grimace.</p>
<p>“…,” Lee Wooshin remained silent, processing the disturbing anecdote.</p>
<p>“You think it’s gonna be any different here? It’s the same everywhere,” she continued, her tone resigned.</p>
<p>As Seoryeong made her way towards the back door, she glanced back at Lee Wooshin. He was casually scratching at a candy wrapper, but when their eyes met, he flashed her a reflexive smile.</p>
<p>“It’s chaotic and dangerous out there,” he remarked, gesturing vaguely towards the gate where a cacophony of shouts could be heard.</p>
<p>Beyond the gate, people clad in matching vests and red headbands moved about amidst flames, the cold air lending a vivid contrast to the colorful chaos on the ground.</p>
<p>“The Blast Agency employees are in there covertly, aiming to dismantle the union,” he explained.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“It’s quite common for mercenaries to get involved in this, but it’s not normal for the government and the police allow a private corporation to be involved like this. So they won’t hold back.”</p>
<p>“What are you trying to say?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be waiting in the car since it’s dangerous.”</p>
