            <p><strong>Chapter 22</strong></p>
<p>The cleaning, which took about three hours, was finally finished.</p>
<p>Even Seoryeong’s once-white mask became dusty as dust exploded everywhere.</p>
<p>She cleaned from under the bed to the dresser, wardrobe, window and window frame, and even the bathroom. She washed the worn-out mop several times and might have thrown it away, she couldn’t remember.</p>
<p>When she finished cleaning the room, which included the rooms of the team members, she closed the last door, rubbing her sore waist.</p>
<p><em>Thud</em>.</p>
<p>A strong vibration was transmitted to the hands clinging to the stair railing.</p>
<p>As she raised her head outside the railing, men who seemed to have nothing in common were coming up from the bottom floor in a group.</p>
<p>Thump, thump. The iron skeleton shook like a storm as multiple footsteps ascended the spiral stairs.</p>
<p>At that moment, the man leading the group looked directly at Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It felt like an unavoidable encounter, with no way to dodge it.</p>
<p>The reddish glow, like blood, illuminated the worn-down inn, casting an eerie atmosphere. Among them, Lee Wooshin, looking pale, stood out in the dim light.</p>
<p>Approaching slowly, his figure appeared as a dark silhouette against the backdrop. He never took his eyes off Seoryeong as he climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>His gaze sent a chill down her spine. Trying to endure it, Seoryeong involuntarily tightened her grip on the railing.</p>
<p>“Sister, it’s you!”</p>
<p>At that moment, a familiar face emerged, pushing past the men.</p>
<p>“Oh… seeing you outside of North Korea is even more delightful…!”</p>
<p>“Why are you here―”</p>
<p>Her mouth fell open behind the hygiene mask. Seoryeong froze, and Channa approached with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Surprised? I’m here for work too.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Channa, were you part of this?”</p>
<p>Channa avoided eye contact as if feeling awkward.</p>
<p>Just then, the team members came up behind Channa. Even without asking, it was clear they were part of the special security team.</p>
<p>A person with a sharp gaze and a thin body, another with sturdy-looking skin and lips tightly sealed, and a silent-looking person—all caught Seoryeong’s attention at once.</p>
<p>Even though they were wearing ordinary clothes, their physique and gaze exuded an unusual aura. As Channa and the team members entered their rooms without saying a word, only two people were left in the corridor.</p>
<p>With a sharp expression, Lee Wooshin asked, “Did you sign the confidentiality agreement?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then you must have heard the overall job details. Why are you still here?”</p>
<p>The man with a scornful look questioned her with an air of disbelief.</p>
<p>What does he mean? Seoryeong stared at him with a puzzled expression. In response, Lee Wooshin, who had been squeezing his smooth lower lip and furrowing his brow, spoke.</p>
<p>“I just can’t understand, no matter how much I think about it.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You must have heard everything, so why did you end up covered in dust and dirt?”</p>
<p>“The rooms were very dirty.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“The hygiene here was a mess.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin furrowed his brow slightly, then, after taking a deep breath, returned to his expressionless state.</p>
<p>It was truly a peculiar face. He looked as if he had witnessed something terribly wrong or encountered a dilemma. Covering his eyes with his knuckles, he gazed at the ceiling for a while.</p>
<p><em>Wasn’t that what he asked? I thought it was a suitable answer… judging by his reaction, maybe not.</em></p>
<p>After a while, he returned with a friendly expression, smiling wryly.</p>
<p>“About two years ago, the police chief in Thailand demanded a bribe from a drug lord and ended up killing him.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“More precisely, he tortured and killed him. They agreed on a bribe amount, but he thought it was too little. So, he put a plastic bag over the guy’s face and continued to assault him. Eventually, he choked him to death.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong blinked at the context-less story.</p>
<p>“The incident came to light when the video spread, but he hasn’t been caught yet, the police chief.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong is here to help in such a country. Is that all there is to it? Feeding the kids who went in to assemble guns for drug trafficking or provide security at the drug smuggling site.”</p>
<p>The man mocked her with sincere eyes.</p>
<p>“Yet you’re willing to clean up this mess.”</p>
<p>Even though his tone sounded like he was coaxing and consoling a stubborn child, his eyes were endlessly cold.</p>
<p>Seoryeong raised her eyebrows at the one-sided scolding. Is all this talk… about why she hasn’t left yet?</p>
<p>She brushed a stray strand of hair out of her face with the back of her hand.</p>
<p><em>Are you kidding me? You’re the one who put me on the travel list, and you’re talking to me like that?</em></p>
<p>Anger bubbled up inside her, but she didn’t know where to direct it, and after a moment’s pause, he spoke again.</p>
<p>“You should be scared.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>What was his intention in saying something like this?</p>
<p>“Just do as you were doing, and play along as you look.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin still seemed unlucky, and socializing only seemed to get harder with experience.</p>
<p>“I’m already doing that. I am here to do the cleaning and the cooking.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong no longer wanted to distance herself from the special security team. The answer was to respond well from now on.</p>
<p>“Would you like some noodles with cilantro tomorrow morning?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Should I skip the cilantro?”</p>
<p>Judging by his contorted expression, it seemed like she had given the wrong answer again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Every morning, Seoryeong started her day by exploring a few alleys, following the advice to familiarise herself with the surroundings.</p>
<p>She woke up early, visited the market, prepared simple meals, and neatly placed the finished food in front of the team members’ rooms.</p>
<p>Her steps slowed down in the unfamiliar architectural style, but she wandered around as she caught a faint whiff of spices. Led by Channa, she found herself in the city centre of Thailand.</p>
