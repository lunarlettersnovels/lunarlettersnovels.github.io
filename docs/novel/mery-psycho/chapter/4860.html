            <p><strong>Chapter 13.2</strong></p>
<p>After becoming a black agent, he lost his name and face. It’s advantageous to have a common face as an agent. The best agent left a non-memorable impression on others.</p>
<p>However, Lee Wooshin’s body and face were not like those of normal East Asians, which left too much of an impression. It was a weakness to be noticed by others, so he had to erase his face for the past 10 years.</p>
<p><em>But now that I’m quitting, they’re willing to give it back. I don’t know if I should resend them or thank them.</em></p>
<p>He smiled dryly. A bigger shockwave hit him than when he clenched his teeth. The blood that was used for dopamine circulated through his veins fast.</p>
<p>“Without that silicone mask?”</p>
<ul>
<li>Without.</li>
</ul>
<p>“As Lee Wooshin?”</p>
<ul>
<li>As just Lee Wooshin.</li>
</ul>
<p>He felt unfamiliar with his name as if it was someone else’s. But even so, the senior manager conceded. Lee Wooshin squinted and scoffed like he was doubting. But it was an interesting proposition. He smiled.</p>
<p>“You say I shouldn’t be noticeable.”</p>
<p>He leaned back.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s in your area, and we need that mask right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s real mask.</p>
<p>His eyes flashed. It was his last mission so it was doable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you heard about Blast Agency before?</li>
</ul>
<p>***</p>
<p>&lt;Recruiting team leader and trainer&gt;</p>
<p>Those with successful experience in army operations and lead.</p>
<p>Those with experience in training a few groups and divisions. Those who can establish trust with foreign armies.</p>
<p>Those who can be responsible for different types of work such as quick stationing, joint operation, peacekeeping, supplying, and training schedules. Preference will be given to those with experience in Africa.</p>
<p>Seoryeong looked at the notice on Blast Agency with disinterest.</p>
<p>A few days ago, she put in her resume with Jeong Pilgyu’s recommendation, but the only thing Seoryeong needed was a salary and an opportunity.</p>
<p>She needed a tasty hostage and an aid at the same time.</p>
<p>This was a place full of freelancing soldiers who had left the regular army, so they considered money and survival the most important things.</p>
<p>Someone with a dangerous skillset but no morals. Someone who has complained about society. She was looking for that type of person first.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong?”</p>
<p>The door opened, and some middle-aged man walked in. Seoryeong put down her phone.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I got your resume here. It says Mr. Jeong Pilgyu recommended you.”</p>
<p>He sounded surprised.</p>
<p>“This is more of a formality because of the recommendation.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“It says you’ve been a housewife since you married.”</p>
<p>He asked while flicking on the resume.</p>
<p>“Are you good at doing dishes and laundry?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Seoryeong quietly stared at him. But it seemed like her answer wasn’t important, as the interviewer changed the subject and mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>“You started working as a caretaker almost after becoming an adult… Then you should be good with patients.”</p>
<p>“Patients?”</p>
<p>No enthusiasm was sensed from this man.</p>
<p>“You were a housewife, so you’ll be good at cooking too…”</p>
<p>“I’m not too bad.”</p>
<p>That was the only thing she could do, so his careless questions meant nothing.</p>
<p>She came in because of Jeong Pilgyu’s threat, but the rest was up to her.</p>
<p>Plans and preparation were required even for bad intentions. Seoryeong just had to keep quiet, glance around, eavesdrop, and learn to trick her husband out of there.</p>
<p>The moment of opportunity will come, she knows.</p>
<p>“You just have to do laundry, cook, and do dishes. It’ll be the same thing you do at home, except that it’s quite a lot more.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“The appliances will take care of it all anyway. We needed a young person, so welcome.”</p>
<p>Her eyebrows flinched.</p>
<p>The Blast Agency didn’t just hire special mercenaries. Even those who never even shot a gun are working in administration or accounting.</p>
<p>Out of those departments, Seoryeong will be working in the department that was in charge of driving, doing dishes, laundry, etc.</p>
<p>The man closed the file.</p>
<p>“You’ll officially start on Monday. Please take good care of our agents. The training uniforms will smell if you pile them up, so please take care of them in a timely manner. Also, take good care of their meal.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“We finally have a young woman in our agency…! Usually, those in their 20s don’t want to do this kind of work, so it’s usually women in their 50s and 60s that work here.”</p>
<p>He was humming while turning. She quietly asked him.</p>
<p>“I saw that the majority of the employees here are soldiers, so there must be lots of tools here.”</p>
<p>“… Yes, well, the arms department is doing a good job taking care of that. Why? Are you scared?”</p>
<p>The interviewer laughed as he found her cute and fragile.</p>
<p>“No, I just thought you should shut your mouth a little.”</p>
<p>“… Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you scared?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong stared at the man with a cold face. Her sentence didn’t point out what he should be scared of, but he seemed to have read something from her cold face as his face turned red.</p>
<p>Seoryeong, who wanted to become a criminal, started her life as a housewife.</p>
<p>She had a long way to go.</p>
