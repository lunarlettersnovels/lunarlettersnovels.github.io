            <p>Today, her husband, Kim Hyun, seemed strange.</p>
<p>Hot and firm flesh relentlessly penetrated Han Seoryeong. Her legs, mercilessly squeezed between two bodies, involuntarily spread wider.</p>
<p>It was clear that he had lost his mind.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he, who had been indulging in leisure and mundane sex during their marriage, wouldn’t have changed like this.</p>
<p>He was monstrous.</p>
<p>The sound of squelching from the vigorously merging flesh echoed obscenely. He pounded as if he were a completely different person. Her whole body shook with his forceful thrusts.</p>
<p>“Ah, huh…!”</p>
<p>His body trembled, his spine at a difficult angle, as he repeatedly stabbed at Son-ryeon’s pleasure points.</p>
<p>Soryeong felt dizziness seemed to set in.</p>
<p>The sensation rushing in made her mouth dry. Somehow, Kim Hyun sensed it, and a moist tongue came crashing in immediately.</p>
<p>“Huh, uh…!”</p>
<p>Twisting their entwined head, he urgently sucked on her tongue. It was truly an unusual kiss compared to his usual ones. In his eagerness, he shoved his tongue in like he was inserting a knife into someone’s throat.</p>
<p>Wasn’t a kiss supposed to be gentle and pleasant?</p>
<p>Seoryeong shivered at the rough and savage treatment.</p>
<p>Whether it was pleasure or discomfort she was feeling, she couldn’t tell at this point.</p>
<p>It was just really strange. When she tried to resist even a little, her husband aggressively bit into her neck as if to dominate her.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>He pressed down on Seoryeong’s wrists, preventing her from moving. From the beginning of their intimate encounter, he had kept her wrists restrained, and eventually, the area around her wrists felt sore and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Uh… let go of my hands. It hurts…”</p>
<p>However, despite her uncomfortable groans, her husband paid no attention. He continued to nibble on her slightly swollen nipples as if savoring them like a delicacy.</p>
<p>It was an unusually indifferent action for a husband who had never shown such behavior before, always considerate of her, especially considering her impaired vision.</p>
<p>“Ah, uh, uh…!”</p>
<p>He had always been polite and careful towards his wife, like she was made of glass. He was never one to treat her so recklessly.</p>
<p>Yet now, he entered her forcefully. A short scream escaped her lips.</p>
<p>“Hyeon-ssi, haa…! Wait, stop…!”</p>
<p>“No, there’s no time.”</p>
<p>A hoarse voice murmured lowly.</p>
<p>Time? What time?</p>
<p>But she didn’t have time to dwell on this thought.</p>
<p>His pelvis kept colliding with hers. His thick organ continued to thrust inside her , and with each vigorous motion, a pulsating vibration echoed deep within, reaching her deeply to her core.</p>
<p>Having never experienced such rough intimacy, her body trembled involuntarily. The inflamed sensation felt like a blazing turmoil inside her.</p>
<p>“Huh…!”</p>
<p>Her breath caught, and tears welled in her eyes due to the overwhelming sensations she was experiencing.</p>
<p>Today, for the first time, she realized that tears could be involuntarily triggered by extreme pleasure.</p>
<p>His resilient pelvis collided repeatedly, then withdrew. The intense thrusting brought about a sensation of falling that was so overpowering it was impossible to distinguish between ecstasy and pain.</p>
<p>How many times had there been moments where their sweat soaked through so profoundly during sex?</p>
<p>Today, her husband was truly peculiar.</p>
<p>The sounds of colliding and scraping had become indistinct, the duration lost in a haze. The molded skin felt hot.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t do this when I’m not around.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Kim Hyun lowered his posture and licked away her tears with his tongue.</p>
<p>“Spreading your legs like this is not allowed.”</p>
<p>“Huh…! What are you saying now…! Huh…”</p>
<p>“Damn it, haa…” Holding onto her hips, he thrust forcefully from below, swearing like he had never done in his life.</p>
<p>“Haa, uh… It’s strange, Hyeon-ssi, swearing… it’s strange.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, just let me have it tonight, just for tonight.”</p>
<p>He bit down on Seoryeong’s plump lower lip, forcefully pushing his tongue inside. Seoryeong’s nerves eased slightly at the familiar scent of her husband.</p>
<p>“Well, at least… release my hands.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“It hurts.”</p>
<p>“Pain is better if it leaves lasting marks.”</p>
<p>He spoke incoherent words while increasing his movements, as if it were the last time they would be together.</p>
<p>Leaning his forehead on Seoryeong’s shoulder, he sunked his teeth into her soft flesh, she emitted painful moans.</p>
<p>During such moments, she resented she couldn’t see his eyes. She wanted to see his expression and embrace him, but her vision remained blurry.</p>
<p>At best, she could only his movements and his body’s outlines.</p>
<p>The trouble with her retina began on an unfortunate day.</p>
<p>However, since meeting her husband after that, she believed everything in life had both positive and negative meanings.</p>
<p>Although trapped in a misty, prison-like vision, it was a more peaceful and satisfying time than ever before.</p>
<p>She had lived with a gloomy feeling even before her eyesight deteriorated… So, compared to gaining Kim Hyun, this kind of illness was nothing.</p>
<p>Because this man appeared and everything changed.</p>
