            <p><strong>Chapter 110.2</strong></p>
<p>A brief silence fell inside the vehicle. Seoryeong turned sharply toward Jin Hojae, her expression like someone who’d been betrayed.</p>
<p><em>Didn’t you call it a romance?</em> Her look seemed to say.</p>
<p>Embarrassed, Jin Hojae ducked his head, then mumbled hesitantly in a subdued voice, “But still, they overcame borders, class differences, and even an age gap to get married! And they died on the same day. That makes it a pretty beautiful story, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Ki Taemin responded by smacking the back of Jin Hojae’s head. Seoryeong pondered for a moment before asking, “What kind of accident was it?”</p>
<p>“That’s enough,” Lee Wooshin, who had been quiet until now, cut them off. His jaw tightened as he took a sharp turn, causing the team to sway to one side and the seats to creak under the force.</p>
<p>“Two kilometers to arrival. Stay alert.”</p>
<p>After enduring the rough terrain, the brick-red exterior of a monastery finally came into view.</p>
<p>Feeling an unsettling churn in her stomach, Seoryeong bit her lower lip and forced herself to swallow the sour taste rising in her throat.</p>
<p>As the jeep began to slow down to stop, someone suddenly appeared and yanked open the door.</p>
<p>Before Seoryeong could react, a hand grabbed her calf.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>In an instant, she slipped out of the seat, and a firm hand wedged itself under her arms. The attacker moved with the decisiveness of someone pulling a child out of its mother’s womb.</p>
<p>Seoryeong instinctively grabbed the handle, but the worn fixture broke off immediately. She tumbled out of the vehicle, her body hitting the ground in less than a second.</p>
<p>“That bastard—!”</p>
<p><strong><em>Screech! </em></strong>Lee Wooshin slammed on the brakes and shouted furiously.</p>
<p>But it was too late. Seoryeong shifted her mindset, deciding to use the man as a cushion instead, and twisted her body abruptly.</p>
<p>As they tumbled together, the stranger’s scent filled her nose. Dust billowed up as they rolled across the dirt ground.</p>
<p><strong><em>Huff… huff! </em></strong>The man holding her panted heavily, a hint of euphoric laughter mixing with his ragged breaths.</p>
<p>“Sonya… my Sonya… finally!”</p>
<p>Her disoriented gaze settled on his black hair, which shimmered with faint reddish tones under the sunlight.</p>
<p>Their noses almost touched as their eyes met. His dark, piercing eyes left a deep impression—unforgettable, like the sight of someone writhing against a bathroom door in some indecent act.</p>
<p>The priest grinned broadly, baring white teeth.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin shouted as he slammed the car door shut, loud enough to shatter it. From the backseat, three gun barrels were trained precisely on the target.</p>
<p>In that fleeting moment, the priest leaned in close and whispered in her ear, “I invited your husband here too.”</p>
<p>Her body froze.</p>
<p>The next second, a powerful force yanked them apart. Lee Wooshin immediately kicked the priest’s head with his boot and twisted his arm behind his back.</p>
<p>The priest’s face was pressed into the mud, his expression twisted as he gasped for air. Lee Wooshin, unmoved, grabbed the side of his head and repeatedly slammed it against a protruding rock.</p>
<p>“Sonya, Sonya, look at this! See how cruel your husba—ahhh!”</p>
<p>Abruptly, Lee Wooshin dislocated the priest’s shoulder with a harsh twist. A sickening crack echoed, followed by a limp dangling of the priest’s arm.</p>
<p>The priest’s mouth gaped open as he wailed loudly, tears streaming uncontrollably as he begged for mercy. His pitiful cries were painful to hear, yet Lee Wooshin’s cold expression remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Seoryeong finally snapped back to her senses. <em>Was it right to beat the priest like this? </em>His wailing, like that of a distressed child, pulled her back to the present.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just any place—it was a monastery.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Lee Wooshin’s domain, and no matter the reason, mercenaries harassing one of its priests was bound to have serious consequences. She brushed the dirt off her knees and tugged at Lee Wooshin’s arm.</p>
<p>“This man seems to be part of the monastery. If we get caught mishandling this, it’ll be trouble.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>A tense silence followed. His darkened eyes fixed on her, unyielding. <em>Why? </em>her innocent expression seemed to ask. Without a word, Lee Wooshin finally let go of the priest and stood him upright.</p>
<p>The priest bit his lip, his shoulders trembling visibly. His gaunt complexion, sticky with blood and dirt, made him look pitiful.</p>
<p>Stumbling slightly, the priest approached Seoryeong. He extended his hand for a handshake, only to glance at his limp arm with irritation. Without a word, he forcibly popped his shoulder back into place with a loud click, then smiled again and reached out.</p>
<p>“Kia. My name is Kia. I… not good at Korean. Speak informally, okay?”</p>
<p>Tears clung to the corners of his eyes, giving him an odd appearance, as if they were streaks of misplaced paint.</p>
<p>Kia’s gaze locked onto her, unyielding, as if magnetized. His expression, a mix of joy and reverence, seemed to brim with unspoken anticipation.</p>
<p><em>This is exactly the kind of look creeps have. He better not suddenly drop his pants or something.</em></p>
<p>Seoryeong’s brow furrowed. Her stomach, already unsettled from the tumble earlier, seemed to churn harder.</p>
<p>“Ugh—! <strong><em>Cough, cough!</em></strong>”</p>
<p>Before she could stop herself, she threw up—right onto Kia’s outstretched hand.</p>
