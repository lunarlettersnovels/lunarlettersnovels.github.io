            <p><strong>Chapter 71.2</strong></p>
<p>“If you haven’t threatened a priest to blow up a church, down your drink.”</p>
<p>Yoo Dawit was a case of someone who quietly attended seminary before becoming a soldier. After encountering explosives by chance, it felt like his mind was awakening as he waited for his father’s voice. provided, the n</p>
<p>At first, he was pointed at as a traitor, but his stubbornness did not waver.</p>
<p>Eventually, he dropped out of seminary, went through EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), and was deployed overseas with the 5th Airborne Special Forces Brigade, where he had plenty of experiences.</p>
<p>Once again, Seoryeong and the two others drank.</p>
<p>“Only those who have tried it in the water should drink!”</p>
<p>‘What?’ At that moment, Seoryeong hesitated, and the other team members made faces, while Jin Hojae continued to drink.</p>
<p>Ah! Only then did Seoryeong realize it referred to sex. As she was about to break her glass, Lee Wooshin, who had not touched a drop of alcohol until then, grabbed her wrist.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened in surprise as she looked at him. He slowly swallowed his drink, as if holding onto her gaze.</p>
<p>“Whoa—!”</p>
<p>The team members erupted with low, sinister cheers, but even amidst the noise, their tangled gazes remained steady.</p>
<p>His adam’s apple bobbed leisurely up and down. Her wrist, firmly held by him, felt tingly.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>‘I’ve done it in the bathtub with my husband, too…. I remember feeling embarrassed at the time, but I liked how he coaxed and comforted me.’</p>
<p>But now seeing that other people do it, Seoryeong felt relief and belongingness.</p>
<p>Finally, it was her turn to speak, as the three mentors looked at her with various expressions of waiting, anticipation, and encouragement.</p>
<p>After a moment of hesitation, she parted her lips. It would be easy to make them drink with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>“Anyone who hasn’t lived as a blind person, drink.”</p>
<p>Immediately, the three men simultaneously downed their drinks.</p>
<p>“Anyone who hasn’t been in a fraudulent marriage, drink.”</p>
<p>Once again, the three heads tilted back in unison.</p>
<p>“If you haven’t been suspected by the police of attempting to murder your husband, drink.”</p>
<p>Everyone went silent and stared at her.</p>
<p>“If your neighbors have never disappeared all at once, drink.”</p>
<p>“Anyone who hasn’t attempted to defect to the North, drink two shots.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“She’s crazy.” Ki Taemin, who had been downing drinks one after another, exclaimed, “Damn…” in a tone that was both impressed and incredulous. Seoryeong listened to the instructors’ laments, then shifted her gaze to Jin Hojae, who still looked lively.</p>
<p>Even after rolling over several times, he still reminded her of Kim Hyun. The image of her husband, which she had imagined with her blind eyes, looked exactly like that.</p>
<p>A slightly tanned complexion, a thick neck, and shoulders like a swimmer….</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but keep her eyes on him, and when she dropped a piece of meat while using her chopsticks, she heard a tsk from nearby.</p>
<p>“You need to eat the meat with your mouth, who eats at a gathering with their eyes? And this is your third drink.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“If you get caught staring at a man, what do I say will happen? With your poor chopstick skills, what do you think you can accomplish out there?”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“You probably didn’t get to eat a proper meal after the survival training, right? So just bury your face in your plate.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong flinched but nodded silently.</p>
<p>After returning home to soothe her severely hungry stomach, she had to eat only soft foods for several days. True to his words, today was indeed the first time she would eat a proper meal.</p>
<p>Jin Hojae, suddenly remembering something, leaned in. “Oh, right! Team Leader, is your rib okay now?”</p>
<p>Rib? What rib? Seoryeong’s gaze shot straight to him. However, Lee Wooshin remained expressionless, not in the mood for a straightforward answer. She looked at Jin Hojae, hoping for an explanation.</p>
<p>“Oh! You didn’t know? He cracked his ribs a little bit last fall. When they’re cracked, he gets cold sweats every time he raises his arms, and it hurts like hell just to lie down and breathe.”</p>
<p>“Did you injure your rib back then?” Seoryeong asked as she looked at his side.</p>
<p>So, Lee Wooshin sat there with a rib injury, hugged her tightly, and then climbed the ice wall again? She frowned at the memory.</p>
<p>“Let’s not make a big deal out of a minor injury.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>
<p>‘It’s just that working under a tough person like you is a bit much.’ But she didn’t voice that thought.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin tossed a chunk of meat onto her plate as if telling her to stop worrying and just eat.</p>
<p>At that moment, Jin Hojae, who had just swallowed a large piece of meat, suddenly introduced a different topic.</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, I recently saw something interesting on YouTube. There was an interview with a guy named Jonah Mendez, who was the former head of disguise for the CIA. And it turns out that the facial disguise techniques we only see in movies actually exist!”</p>
<p>Curious gazes fixed on Jin Hojae.</p>
<p>“It’s not just that such techniques exist, but they’ve already surpassed our imagination! They say if the bone structure matches, you can change gender and race, and no one would be able to tell. He mentioned that even if a disguised person passes by, you wouldn’t feel any discomfort at all. The CIA called it something like an overhead mask.”</p>
<p>“Hey, but doesn’t that mean that such espionage techniques are outdated now that they’ve been revealed to the public?”</p>
<p>He nodded at Ki Taemin’s point.</p>
<p>“Right? I guess it’s no longer a secret, so they mentioned it. But here’s the thing.”</p>
<p>Jin Hojae looked around at his team members before continuing.</p>
<p>“How would you feel if someone you were close to had a fake face?”</p>
<p>At that, Lee Wooshin, who had been grilling meat, paused, and Seoryeong raised her head from her chopsticks.</p>
