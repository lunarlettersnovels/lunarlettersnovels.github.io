            <p><strong>Chapter 38.2</strong></p>
<p>When her body seemed to have stopped moving, she began kicking her bound legs back and forth with all her might. Her back straightened, her body flexed, and she cut through the water.</p>
<p>As soon as she broke the surface, she opened her mouth wide and sucked in a gulp of air. The first thing she saw was a sleek black boat, and she couldn’t help but shout. “Aren’t you going to save us!”</p>
<p>It was because the crew members Lee Wooshin dropped before her were still struggling in the freezing water, and no help was coming.</p>
<p>“We’re all freezing!” She was the first to protest, and the men struggling to speak nodded in agreement through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin checked the watch on his wrist and settled into a comfortable position on the boat. His fingers were propped up on the back of his head like he was lying on a sunbed, and he stared out at the horizon.</p>
<p>“It’s training, and there are deaths and accidents.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“The sun will be up in ten minutes. We’re all going to stay here and watch the sunrise.”</p>
<p>This bastard. This son of a b*tch!</p>
<p>As she glared at him, their eyes coincidentally met. Even though she was the one who had fallen into the water, Lee Wooshin’s breath hitched in his chest.</p>
<p>As if it were an illusion, he flashed her a languid smile and looked at his watch again.</p>
<p>“Do you feel like slapping me right now?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to slap you, I want to bite you off.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin laughed as he rubbed his cheeks, still red from the winter wind, with the back of his hand.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry you can’t help it.”</p>
<p>What an asshole… Soon, a red line appeared over the horizon.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin pushed the trainees to their limits until the sun rose. Only then, just before hypothermia set in, did he grab them one by one by the back of the head and pull them out.</p>
<p>As we shivered in the cold and struggled to keep our fishlike bodies stretched out, Lee Wooshin spoke about how nice the scenery was and how everyone should see the sunrise.</p>
<p>Darn it…</p>
<p>Seoreyong couldn’t help but curse.</p>
<p>“More, more, c-close, clos-er…!”</p>
<p>At that moment, one crew member pleaded with chapped lips. Nothing seemed more urgent than the faint warmth they provided now.</p>
<p>They all shuffled over on wobbly legs, pressing their shoulders and forearms tightly against each other as they sat. Soon, they shot sympathetic glances even at Seoryeong, who sat at a distance.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yeah, in a situation like this, you need one more person, male or female. Even a sigh felt like their chattering jaw hit a brick wall.</p>
<p>Eventually, Seoryeong found herself squeezed into the exclusive group for the first time. Indeed, pressing and huddling together with others was far more bearable than facing the sea breeze alone.</p>
<p>“If you keep this up, you might end up stripping each other naked.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin chuckled as he sat on the boat’s edge and started the engine. He drove the boat quickly toward shore, taking a sharp curve that threw some men off the boat again.</p>
<p>Crazy bastard….!</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin smirked at Seoryeong’s cursing gaze, pulling his lips back. It was really unnecessary mischief.</p>
<p>As soon as they reached land, the crew members, bound as they were, stumbled and staggered ashore.</p>
<p>Once they entered the living quarters, they could be drenched in hot water from head to toe. However, due to their bound hands and feet, they soon found themselves face down on the sandy shore.</p>
<p>No matter how they ran like madmen, their muscles had stiffened from the prolonged immersion. The soft sand offered little help.</p>
<p>“If you can’t untie yourselves, you can’t enter the living quarters.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, holding a megaphone, announced.</p>
<p>“So if you don’t want to be a frozen fish, begin untying yourselves now.”</p>
<p>The men’s faces showed a hint of despair as they realized that they were chained up with the living quarters just around the corner. And the hands tied behind their backs seemed impossible to untie on their own.</p>
<p>Some determined crew members quickly paired up, supporting each other’s backs and trying to find the knots by feeling each other’s wrists.</p>
<p>Wow… Seoryeong let out an impressed sigh, even with her parched lips. It was a good strategy. The crew members, who had been cursing while lying down, suddenly regained their senses and paired up individually.</p>
<p>But Seoryeong had been facing obstacles from the beginning.</p>
