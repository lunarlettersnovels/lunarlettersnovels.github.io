            <p><em>Note: Chapter 122.2 wasn’t uploaded properly last time, but it’s now available. Some chapters may have been uploaded twice. Sorry for the confusion! Please enjoy the latest update.</em><strong></strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong>Chapter 125.1</strong></p>
<p>What had seemed like nonsense from a cult was now being interpreted this way in the scientific world? Seoryeong, momentarily forgetting the complex emotions she had been feeling, became absorbed in Yoo Dawit’s explanation.</p>
<p>“There was also a verse about receiving a forced mark on the right hand or forehead, right?”</p>
<p>“A mark received in front of all the beasts… whether small or great, rich or poor, free or slave, they all receive a mark on their right hand or forehead, and no one can buy or sell unless they have the mark… Revelation 13:14—”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>She nodded, recalling Kia’s voice.</p>
<p>“The mark on the forehead or hand is likely to be a biometric chip.”</p>
<p>“As far as I know, the VeriChip has already been commercialized.”</p>
<p>Yoo Dawit rubbed his chin and motioned for something from Ki Taemin with a flick of his hand. Ki Taemin, almost instinctively understanding the signal, handed him his phone.</p>
<p>After tapping the screen a few times, Yoo Dawit continued with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“They insert a microchip the size of a grain of rice into the body via surgery or an injection. The FDA approved it in the US as early as 2004. You can buy and sell things, track your location, perform bank transactions, and of course, gather body information.”</p>
<p>Ki Taemin, who had been listening along, showed a keen interest.</p>
<p>“At first, they used it for pets and endangered species management, but now they’re inserting it into humans. With just that chip, you can unlock your house, use credit cards, and even use your ID. In Sweden, they’re even using it for ticketing,” he said, showing an article about the Swedish national railway company.</p>
<p>Yoo Dawit suddenly seemed parched, looking around, and Seoryeong, noticing, discreetly handed him some water.</p>
<p>He cleared his rough voice and spoke again.</p>
<p>“Anyway, the world is changing too quickly, and the Bible warns about such marks. It warned that these things will eventually control and manipulate humanity.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Seoryeong’s expression became nuanced. Had Kia also spoken in such a warning tone? She recalled his troubled face from childhood, but it didn’t seem like it. Rather…</p>
<p>She vividly remembered the voice when he recited the verses he had memorized while holding her hand and enduring his beatings.</p>
<p>It was fast, steady, and solemn, with a tone that sounded somewhat familiar.</p>
<p>Wasn’t that the face of someone waiting with the “mark of the beast” on their forehead? The face of a zealot? Seoryeong froze, unsettled by a strange sense of incongruity.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, humans still can’t shake off the desire for brainwashing, right? During the Cold War, the US and Russia both made great efforts to brainwash prisoners. Those projects all failed, though.”</p>
<p>“Well who knows—”</p>
<p>Yoo Dawit shrugged in an observant manner, wincing as he held his side.</p>
<p>“If someone extraordinary were to completely decipher and control the human brain, it might actually be possible.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the room fell into a quiet silence.</p>
<p>“However, chips implanted in the brain have serious side effects. For example, they could make a person feel intense hatred, push them to suicide, cause insomnia, or make them go days without sleep but still be able to endure…”</p>
<p>“Also, they might lead to inhumane behavior.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s expression grew increasingly serious.</p>
<p>“Some entrepreneur, famous for electric cars, developed the chip further into a ‘brain implant.’ They claim it could solve spinal injuries and restore lost brain functions.”</p>
<p>“Is this your delusion, or is this real?”</p>
<p>Ki Taemin, who had been quietly listening, asked with a skeptical look. Yoo Dawit raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“This is a more sensitive topic for us. They say it’s focused on the motor cortex, so it could even enhance the physical abilities of soldiers.”</p>
<p>“Soldiers?” Seoryeong was in disbelief.</p>
<p>“They could create soldiers.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“And if it’s really possible, well… they say they could cure various diseases humanity hasn’t been able to overcome. For example, dementia, hearing loss, visual impairment, paralysis, depression, insomnia, and so on.”</p>
<p>“That’s all possible if you implant a chip in the brain.”</p>
<p>Ki Taemin grimaced, sneering. Yoo Dawit took another sip of water, gesturing toward the ceiling lights that brightly illuminated the room.</p>
<p>“In particular, if you stimulate the visual cortex with electricity, they claim even the blind could see. Of course, it’s dangerous, so the FDA hasn’t approved it yet, but if it’s perfected, it would be a terrifying technology that could turn someone’s sight on and off.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“And if psychological manipulation is possible, wouldn’t even cults welcome it with open arms?”</p>
<p>He squinted and made a gesture of covering and uncovering the light with his palm, and for some reason, Seoryeong’s heart began to race wildly.</p>
