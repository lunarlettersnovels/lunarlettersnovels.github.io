            <p><strong>Chapter 20</strong></p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>What? She couldn’t say anything. Well, it wasn’t like she was expecting much… but still… As she stared at him in awe, he was just yawning and put another candy in.</p>
<p>He threw the candy wrapper into the bag seoryeong was holding in and waved his hand.</p>
<p>“Hurry up. Food doesn’t taste good when it’s cold.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She really didn’t want to deal with him anymore.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>She was told that someone from the company will be greeting her… Seoryeong didn’t know who to deliver the lunchbox to so she kept on looking around. It was getting louder as she was getting further away from the gate, but thankfully no one seemed to care about her.</p>
<p>Seoryeong was thinking about how she can tag along with the team for travelling abroad.</p>
<p>How can she join the list without being suspicious?</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>Someone in a vest chased after her. He looked at the Blast Agency logo on the bag like he knew about it.</p>
<p><em>Ah… This must be him.</em> Seoryeong also started to walk towards him.</p>
<p>“It’s lunchbox, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You can give it to me. Thank you.”</p>
<p>The young man took the bag from her. It was when he bowed down.</p>
<p>She felt her heart stop.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>There was familiar scent from him.</p>
<p>It wasn’t her intention to move towards him. The young man looked confused as she got close.</p>
<p>She subconsciously examined his height, face and the back of his hand.</p>
<p>His chin was sculpted like a man and looked a bit rough. His big eyes were as naïve a country boy and the way he stepped back seemed familiar for some reason.</p>
<p>His scent was too familiar to her husband’s.</p>
<p>As she stared at him without blinking, the man bowed again and ran away.</p>
<p>Seoryeong followed him. The young man seemed to have noticed as he rubbed his neck and stoopped.</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>“Why… are you following…”</p>
<p>“Can I…”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Can I watch you eat?”</p>
<p>“Here? Why?”</p>
<p>As he coughed and asked, Seoryeong answered after pondering.</p>
<p>“I’m curious how much you eat.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I won’t bother you. I’ll just leave after you finish eating.”</p>
<p>“Uh…” He didn’t know what to say at her weird request.</p>
<p><em>He’s just like Kim Hyun when I first met him…</em> She bit her lips. She knew it was false emotion but she felt something.</p>
<p>That young man bowed that moment.</p>
<p>“S, sorry. Inside is a bit dirty so…”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“If you give me your number… We can have dinner after I finish working…”He glanced at Seoryeong and continued offered instead.</p>
<p>She was staring at his collarbones.She knowiIt wasn’t similar to Kim Hyun if she touches it. Her excitement became cold quickly. She answered.</p>
<p>“Do you use cologne?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Or fabric softener?”</p>
<p>As she stared at him, the man blinked fast.</p>
<p>“Uh, ah… I don’t know. My mom does it…”</p>
<p>Seoryeong nodded unenthusiastically.</p>
<p>“So when are you…” He brought up his invitation to dinner again.</p>
<p>“No, I’m sorry. Have a good meal.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong turned around. “Uh, wait!” The man called her from the back but she was already walking away.</p>
<p>Honestly, she was more shocked that she followed him just because of his scent similar to Kum Hyun’s.</p>
<p>Whenever she realized how much she missed him, she felt even worse every time, and her resentment towards Kim Hyun grew.</p>
<p><em>I want to kill him but I miss him…</em> She clenched her eyes.</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong turned around in surprise.</p>
<p>As she turned right, Lee Wooshin was looking oddly at her while approaching her.</p>
<p>“Did you know him?”</p>
<p>He pointed his chin at the man. Seoryeong answered no and dragged her feet.</p>
<p>Kim Hyun would notice whenever she felt down and helped her. The memory of him really bothered her.</p>
<p>“I thought you were going to wait in the car.”</p>
<p>“I run away when it’s dangerous but I run towards my curiosity. Who were you staring so tastily at?”</p>
<p>His eyes seemed uninterested, but his inside showed joy.</p>
<p>Seoryeong clenched her teeth. This man was just teasing her while she wasn’t feeling her best.</p>
<p><em>Just shut up. Should I punch his jaw or kick him? </em>All kinds of negatives thoughts were filling her up.</p>
<p>From the new working environment to the food waste incident. And the stress that she didn’t know that was accruing inside her seemed to be all growing.</p>
<p>She knew she had to get it out somehow…!</p>
<p>“Yes, I stared at him because I wanted to. So what?”</p>
<p>She shot at him coldly.</p>
<p>“I followed the scent I like. So what?”</p>
<p>“… Scent?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the scent that I’m crazy about.”</p>
<p>“Do you smoke weed?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She was shocked. She thought he just had ways to shut you up so she scoffed.</p>
<p>“Just put me on the list. I’m not going to get on your good side.”</p>
<p>That moment, something that flew towards her hit her arm.</p>
