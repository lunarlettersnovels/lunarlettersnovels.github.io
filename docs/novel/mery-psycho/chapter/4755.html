            <p><strong>Chapter 69.2</strong></p>
<p>Even when she said goodbye to the instructors she had grown fond of, and when she finally left the camp on the bus, Lee Wooshin was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Whenever Seoryeong glanced around, her colleagues would approach and say, “I heard about that bastard Seong Wookchan,” patting her on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“What happened to Seong Wookchan?” they would ask.</p>
<p>No one could give her a clear answer about his punishment or whereabouts, no matter whom she asked.</p>
<p>And so, the grueling ten-week journey came to an end.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Beep, beep, beep.</p>
<p>It felt strange to press the door lock buttons after so long. Seoryeong carefully pressed the last number while adjusting the yellow freesia bouquet in her arms.</p>
<p>“I’m back.”</p>
<p>As she stepped inside, her gaze landed on the wedding photo at the end of the hallway. The frame was so thin and brittle that it should have been thrown away.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, she greeted it cheerfully. Even though it made her chest feel cold every time she saw it, today she was oddly glad the picture wasn’t there.</p>
<p>She was ready to do anything to find Kim Hyun, but the sight of the empty wedding photo frame made her let out a cough.</p>
<p>And then, at the moment she noticed the faint outline of a cliff forming in the hollow void.</p>
<p>Seoryeong furrowed her brow tightly, and the bag slung over her shoulder dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>“What kind of crazy b*tch!”</p>
<p>Just then, a loud clattering sound was heard, and the door burst open. A room that had been tidy two months ago was now filled with dark, glowing computer screens.</p>
<p>A young face, confirming it was Channa, twisted in shock.</p>
<p>“Oh my god, unnie! What happened to you that made you look like that?!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations on your recovery.” Without a hint of surprise, Seoryeong handed over the bouquet. Channa, taken aback, accepted the bright yellow freesia but retained her characteristic tone.</p>
<p>“What’s with the split lip, the scratches all over your face! What kind of thug attacked you, that your cheeks are so hollow, and your eyes so dark! Did they not even feed you there?!”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“And your nose is sun-burnt! Don’t you know how dangerous winter UV rays are? You didn’t even bother with sunscreen!”</p>
<p>All she applied during training was mud and camouflage cream.</p>
<p>“And what’s with these muscles on your arm….”</p>
<p>Channa gaped, running her hands over Seoryeong’s arm. Seoryeong, wanting to tease the younger girl, flexed her muscles whenever Channa’s hands passed over them. Channa’s wide-eyed expression was adorable and amusing.</p>
<p>“This isn’t the kind of skill I imagined.”</p>
<p>Channa’s face turned gloomy.</p>
<p>“You should keep the bouquet. My conscience won’t let me accept it.”</p>
<p>When she tried to return the bouquet, Seoryeong pretended not to notice and slipped into the small room.</p>
<p>After completing grueling training, the agents were given ten days to recover until the company called them back. Humming, Seoryeong looked around the one-room space, which had been transformed into a perfect workspace. It was a plan she had often discussed with Channa over the phone.</p>
<p>“There’s no way you’ll get hurt, Channa. All you need to do is―”</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>Channa sighed as if she still found it absurd, and Seoryeong smiled.</p>
<p>“Just frame me using my home IP.”</p>
<p>“How could I do such a thing to my savior?”</p>
<p>“You said you wanted to be like the grateful magpie who repaid a favor, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“I did…! But why are you turning me into a North Korean spy!”</p>
<p>The hottest news in the society section lately was about former Congressman Park Kwangdu’s son’s severance pay.</p>
<p>“The man in his 30s, Mr. Park, who received a severance pay of 5 billion won, was the nephew-in-law of the current First Lady. This meant that Congressman Park Kwangdu and the President were relatives by marriage.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the National Intelligence Service, the agency Seoryeong was targeting, was under the direct control of the President, so it was obvious whose crotch he would grab if the 5 billion disappeared.</p>
<p>“I’ve waited a long time, but now I have to get caught again.”</p>
<p>So, she had to go after the relatives. Messing with family was the basic strategy of psychological warfare.</p>
