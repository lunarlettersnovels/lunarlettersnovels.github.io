            <p><strong>Chapter 116.1</strong></p>
<p><em>Leave, just like that?</em></p>
<p>Seoryeong froze, scrutinizing him as if to understand his intentions. He didn’t seem to be talking about leaving the monastery for a short vacation.</p>
<p>Her pulse quickened, thumping against her throat. She continued to stare at him silently, and his steady gaze bore right back. Though her answer was clear from the start, the words felt impossibly heavy to say.</p>
<p>“I….”</p>
<p>You know I can’t just leave like this. The thought lodged itself in her chest, refusing to pass her lips. Instead, Seoryeong took a step back.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin inhaled sharply, his brows knitting together as if suppressing frustration. Then, his hand seized hers.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>His grip was firm, his eyes restless as they locked onto hers. That fiery, almost desperate look made her stomach churn uneasily. The warmth of his grip was nearly searing.</p>
<p>But she hadn’t confronted Kim Hyun yet—hadn’t held him accountable for anything. That unresolved burden was an anchor. Swallowing her hesitation, she forced herself to remain unmoved.</p>
<p>Until that matter was settled, Seoryeong knew she couldn’t take even one step forward. She changed the subject deliberately.</p>
<p>“You should apply proper medicine before it gets worse.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin closed his eyes, his expression stoic as though resigning himself to the moment.</p>
<p>Yet the deep crease in his brow betrayed his raw irritation. Even so, he didn’t release her wrist. The throbbing in her trapped arm was undeniable.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The agents loaded the children into a small trailer the monastery had prepared. Alongside the children were a few blankets, extra diapers, water bottles, towels, and other supplies.</p>
<p>Once the trailer was connected to the truck, the agents wordlessly took their seats, evenly distributing themselves.</p>
<p>Seoryeong hesitated momentarily, unsure of where to go. As she stood there, Jin Hojae approached, crunching on dried carrots, and offered her a handful.</p>
<p>“Someone’s gotta ride with the kids, right?”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll go.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong took the offered snack without thinking and replied. Just then, Lee Wooshin appeared, shutting one side of the trailer door. He motioned with a cold glance.</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong, sit next to me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Her expression froze. Without realizing it, she tilted her head back to look at the sky.</p>
<p>Jin Hojae glanced between the two of them, quickly hoisted another child into the trailer, and slipped inside, saying, “I’ll handle this!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong clenched her fists tightly and reluctantly climbed into the passenger seat. Her movements were stiff, and her hand jerked aggressively as she buckled her seatbelt.</p>
<p>“Are you going to keep acting like this?”</p>
<p>She lowered her voice, demanding an explanation. Following orders from a superior—fine, she’d comply. She had to. But an inexplicable annoyance simmered beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Ever since arriving at the monastery, his constant, protective demeanor had been grating on her nerves. Still, she’d held back, unwilling to defy orders based on her feelings. But now!</p>
<p>“Is it exhausting for you?”</p>
<p>“No, Instructor. Thanks to you, I’ve been so busy working, I don’t even feel tired.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong replied bluntly, biting into a piece of carrot. Her tone sharpened noticeably at the end.</p>
<p>When he glanced her way and started the engine,<strong> <em>bang, bang!</em> </strong>Someone banged on the trailer wall. Jin Hojae, signaling them to stop, approached the passenger-side window, awkwardly scratching his forehead.</p>
<p>“Um, Team Leader, one of the girls needs to use the bathroom…”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“Well, once one goes, the others…”</p>
<p>“I’ll handle it,” Seoryeong said, unbuckling her seatbelt and moving as if it were the most natural thing to do.</p>
<p>But before she could act, Lee Wooshin swiftly grabbed the unfastened seatbelt, yanked it back, and clicked it into place with force.</p>
<p>The sudden tug halted her movement, and she stared at him in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong, return to your position.”</p>
<p>His cold, measured breath was audible from this close. Jin Hojae hesitated but eventually stepped back, leaving Seoryeong to bite her lower lip in frustration.</p>
<p><em>Oh! I can’t take this anymore. Is he really going to be this?</em> The irritation that had been building within her felt like it was reaching a breaking point.</p>
<p>“Instructor, I’ll go to the back. I’m perfectly capable of changing diapers without batting an eye. Before I joined Blast Agency, that’s exactly the kind of work I did. I can handle it quickly and efficiently.”</p>
<p>“I said, return to your seat.”</p>
<p>“I’m not as skilled in cover fire or marksmanship as the others, so why am I even here if not to help with small tasks?”</p>
<p>Unable to hold it in, her voice rose. She swept her hand over her forehead, glaring at him, her anger barely contained.</p>
<p>“Was this your plan all along? To tell me not to do anything at all?”</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>“Do you seriously think chauffeuring me around like this counts as treating me like an actual agent?”</p>
<p>“That’s for the team leader to decide.” Lee Wooshin responded flatly.</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand that! That’s why I’ve been trying to follow orders as best as I can!”</p>
<p>Clenching her teeth, she turned her head toward the window, glaring outside. That’s when his low voice murmured, “Face me,” as he forcibly turned her head back toward him.</p>
