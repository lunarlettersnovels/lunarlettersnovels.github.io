            <p><strong>Chapter 108.1</strong></p>
<p>As soon as Wooshin stepped out of the CEO’s office, he jabbed the elevator button with a nervous intensity. The priest’s Russian words still seemed to echo in his ears.</p>
<p><em>Kia.</em> The man had introduced himself as Kia.</p>
<p>“――.”</p>
<p>He was transported back to a bitterly cold winter, snowstorms raging outside. Frost clung to the windowpanes, rattling them whenever the wind howled. During those times, he would sit on his grandfather’s knee, staring at the crackling firewood.</p>
<p>“Child, are you European or Asian?”</p>
<p>His grandfather used to utter such cryptic words. That scene flashed vividly in Wooshin’s mind, as clear as if it had happened yesterday.</p>
<p>Clicking his tongue, he jabbed the elevator button repeatedly.</p>
<p>“You are both European and Asian,” his grandfather murmured as he leaned back in his rocking chair.</p>
<p>Why those words came to mind now, Wooshin couldn’t say, but they made him clench his teeth.</p>
<p>“In that case, isn’t it possible for us to claim both Europe and Asia? Perhaps that would bring some joy to your grandmother.”</p>
<p>His grandfather’s face, caught in the backlight, appeared shadowy and unreadable.</p>
<p><em>Ding</em>—the elevator doors opened. But Wooshin, noticing the CCTV camera mounted in the corner of the ceiling, pulled his hand away from the button without hesitation.</p>
<p>Instead, he shoved open the stairwell door and began descending rapidly.</p>
<p>At night, the oligarchs—then the ruling elite—gathered at <em>Winter Fortress</em>. They indulged in alcohol, revelry, and heated debates about Eurasia that lasted until dawn.</p>
<p>His grandmother, the prime minister’s wife, rarely appeared in public due to the disdainful glances aimed at her as an Asian. During those times, the boy would drift off to sleep listening to melancholy songs.</p>
<p>“――.”</p>
<p>Without breaking stride, Wooshin pulled out his phone and called Deputy Chief Joo Seolheon. The longer the line rang, the more tightly his jaw clenched.</p>
<p>He had barely moved, yet his breathing had already grown labored.</p>
<p>If Russian money was flowing into Asia, their ambitions were obvious.</p>
<p><em>Russia. Damn Russia.</em> Wooshin’s expression momentarily twisted in disgust.</p>
<p>“What kind of backdoor schemes are they pulling now?”</p>
<p>Although he didn’t know exactly how Russia’s ambitions for Eurasia were materializing, he was certain it was tied to the elusive secrets of <em>Winter Fortress</em>.</p>
<p>The realization pierced his mind like a sharp intuition.</p>
<p><em>Winter Fortress, the black-haired children, the creaking rocking horse for kids, Rigay, the bombings…</em> Everything seemed to connect, though the links were maddeningly unclear.</p>
<p>― “You call now after wasting an entire day?”</p>
<p>Finally, a sharp voice answered from the other end.</p>
<p>― “I must be the only superior officer on this earth who’s been kidnapped and tortured by their own subordinate.”</p>
<p>“I’m taking Seoryeong to Sakhalin.”</p>
<p>― “What?”</p>
<p>Knowing full well that Joo hadn’t misheard, Wooshin pressed his forehead hard with his fist. He inhaled deeply, suppressing an overwhelming urge to shout. His face contorted with frustration.</p>
<p>“We’re leaving in exactly three hours. If you don’t confirm now, I can’t do a thing.”</p>
<p>― “…”</p>
<p>“Where is Rigay? And is Seoryeong safe even if we go to Russia?”</p>
<p>― “…”</p>
<p>Joo Seolheon remained silent for a moment. Losing patience quickly, Wooshin raised his voice. “Deputy Chief!”</p>
<p>He had never once defied hierarchy, no matter how much his superiors grated on him, but now his collar felt unbearably loose as he tugged at it meaninglessly.</p>
<p>― “Where in Sakhalin?”</p>
<p>Her question carried an odd, inscrutable tone.</p>
<p>“The monastery. Sakhalin Monastery.”</p>
<p>At that moment, a sharp crashing noise rang out from the other end of the line. As Wooshin moved his phone slightly from his ear, he heard Joo giving curt orders to someone nearby, “Clear it and get out.”</p>
<p>After a brief pause, she resumed speaking.</p>
<p>― “Rigay is still in the secure ward. That area is under constant surveillance, so there’s no issue there, but more importantly…”</p>
<p>Joo hesitated before continuing rapidly.</p>
<p>― “Once you arrive in Sakhalin, I’ll arrange for one of our agents to send psychotropic drugs. You’ll also receive an emergency paralytic injection for Han Seoryeong. If you lose control of the situation, blind her again. Assess and act on-site as necessary.”</p>
<p>Wooshin came to an abrupt stop. A sharp ringing filled his ears, forcing him to steady himself against the wall.</p>
<p>“I’m asking if Seoryeong will be safe, and you’re spouting nonsense about…”</p>
<p>―”Don’t dismiss what I’m saying!”</p>
<p>“What exactly do you mean by ‘take action’?”</p>
<p>― “Exactly what it sounds like. If necessary, break something to keep her from moving around unnecessarily—”</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>A surge of nausea overwhelmed him. No more. He couldn’t listen to another word. Unconsciously, Wooshin pounded his fist against the cement wall—once, twice. His knuckles turned red and raw, the skin peeling back to reveal a fresh wound.</p>
<p>A searing, inexplicable sense of despair burned the back of his neck, and his adam’s apple moved decisively as he swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“I will never obey that kind of order again.”</p>
<p>Wooshin bit down on the inside of his cheek so hard that he tasted blood.</p>
<p>“Never again…! I won’t let Han Seoryeong get hurt.”</p>
<p>― “Wooshin…!”</p>
