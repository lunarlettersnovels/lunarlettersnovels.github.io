            <p><strong>Chapter 169.1</strong></p>
<p>“Hey, Yuri. Can’t you invite us to the Prime Minister’s estate?”</p>
<p>Yuri looked up from the book he was flipping through.</p>
<p>“If I don’t get to go this time, my dad’s seriously going to beat me to death!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, me too! Count me in!”</p>
<p>A small group of scruffy boys quickly gathered around Yuri. Though Yuri Solzhenitsyn carried the stigma of mixed Eastern heritage, his jet-black hair drew admiration rather than mockery.</p>
<p>His skin was clear of the usual teenage acne, his gaze sharp and piercing like that of Prime Minister Maxim.</p>
<p>Broad-shouldered, deep-voiced, and more solidly built than any freshman had a right to be, he stood out wherever he went.</p>
<p>“I heard your house has over a hundred bathrooms!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“How about we explore it together over the break?”</p>
<p>“…Explore?”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah…! I bet you haven’t even seen all the rooms.”</p>
<p>Yuri remained silent, and one classmate’s grin wavered.</p>
<p>“There’s gotta be at least one room you haven’t found yet, right?”</p>
<p>Yuri had the aura of a model student. He was disciplined and withdrawn, but when someone crossed a line, he could turn frighteningly cold without ever raising his voice.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, a kid named Boris had joked about having more body hair than Yuri, even going so far as to poke him in the side.</p>
<p>Without reacting, Yuri spun his pencil on the desk. Somehow, Boris was absent for two days afterward.</p>
<p>Rumors spread. One claimed the pencil had jabbed Boris in the belly button, another that he’d been hospitalized. But Boris never said a word.</p>
<p>Yuri wasn’t just handsome; he was beautiful in an unnerving, almost doll-like way. This inspired lewd jokes among classmates who wanted to provoke a reaction.</p>
<p>But he never rose to the bait. His smile was always faint, polite, and impenetrable.</p>
<p>He never let himself slip, even by accident.</p>
<p>That day, the class’s only entertainment came from recording who’d had wet dreams and gossiping about it. Yet Yuri carried himself as if social norms didn’t apply to him.</p>
<p>Even when he’d wet himself once, he’d somehow managed to stay composed, and disappointingly modest.</p>
<p>Some boys studied the contours of his pants when he stood, searching for something to tease. But Yuri never acted immature, which made him hard to approach.</p>
<p>Despite being bound for the same elite universities, there already seemed to be a wall between him and everyone else.</p>
<p>Just then, another boy swaggered over and leaned on Yuri’s desk.</p>
<p>“Hey, Yuri. You like black hair?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Solzhenitsyn married an Asian woman. So… is taste hereditary?”</p>
<p>‘Man, this guy has no tact,’ the others thought nervously.</p>
<p>“We don’t dream about black hair, so it’d be great if you did and told us. Even if no one says it, everyone’s waiting for you to open up.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t had one yet.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“My d!ck’s too tilted. Gotta wait a bit longer.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Did he just say… d!ck? That word?</p>
<p>Shock rippled through the group. For someone so composed, so proper, to drop such vulgarity, it stunned them all.</p>
<p>“Dream or not, I won’t use it carelessly,” Yuri added with a chuckle, brushing the boy’s hand off his desk. “A beast that’s sired a cub. That would be something.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>For winter break, Yuri had traveled to the remote Winter Castle. One morning, he picked up a long hunting rifle.</p>
<p>He was growing by the day. His knees ached at night so his grandfather had started teaching him to hunt.</p>
<p>“Power shares qualities with God, Yuri. Don’t waste time judging good and evil. Learn to recognize what matters. Today, pick the hardest prey to catch and kill.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandfather.”</p>
<p>Crunching footsteps faded behind him. As his grandfather disappeared into the woods, Yuri’s expression lost its light. His smile vanished like mist.</p>
<p>He wandered the birch forest, eyes glazed with disinterest. A slow, listless yawn escaped him.</p>
<p>He might’ve been good at hunting or marksmanship if he applied himself, but none of it appealed to him. He preferred staying home, reading political theory in silence.</p>
<p>The world was loud. Lies came easy. Effort made him sweat, and he hated that.</p>
<p>How long had he been wandering now, just passing time?</p>
<p>Suddenly, he spotted a trail of tracks in the snow. He dragged his feet forward, barely interested, and peered into a burrow.</p>
<p>Inside, a cluster of newborn rabbits, hairless and slippery, huddled in a trembling pile. A mother rabbit, red-eyed and alert, raised her head and met Yuri’s gaze.</p>
<p>A strange stillness filled the air.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He scanned the mother’s belly, flat and deflated. Too late.</p>
<p>Now what…?</p>
<p>The boy, whose Adam’s apple had just begun to jut from his throat, sighed deeply.</p>
<p>He scratched his forehead, then gently stacked some twigs in front of the burrow, as if to shield it.</p>
<p>Then he turned and trudged back, snow crunching up to his ankles with every step.</p>
<p>“Great. What a disaster.”</p>
