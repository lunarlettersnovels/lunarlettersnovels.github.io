            <p><strong>Chapter 33.2</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong’s eyes scanned the other man’s chest, but there was no name tag, and the man’s face hardened subtly as he nudged her bag with his toe.</p>
<p>“How many times have we… met, and you still haven’t memorized my name? You said you knew it the last time I asked, you said you saw my name tag!”</p>
<p>“That was two months ago.”</p>
<p>“What…!”</p>
<p>“You know how to read, but apparently, I didn’t leave a lasting impression for you to remember.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“So, what’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Damn it…”</p>
<p>“I guess that’s not exactly what you want to call it.” She said sarcastically.</p>
<p>The man bit his lip hard as if his pride had been wounded.</p>
<p>How old is this guy anyway? Seoryeong thought as she observed the recruit who was fully exposing his emotions.</p>
<p>She was no longer an employee who has to be flexible with the truth, but one who can’t be seen as shallow. If the training was to end peacefully, she couldn’t allow her opponent’s disrespect to continue. It was time for her to draw the line.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you save your jokes?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong pulled him close and whispered, with a firm tone and clear intent. Their faces were so close they could almost touch.</p>
<p>“Either throw a punch or let me put one in, but why bother pretending to know everything and acting like we’re buddies when it’s clear you’re itching for a fight?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious you want to make fun of me.”</p>
<p>The man’s face stiffened.</p>
<p>“I can tolerate your immaturity, but if you want to be a savage–”</p>
<p>Seoryeong opened her eyes coldly from the close distance that almost touched.</p>
<p>“I can act just the same.”</p>
<p>At that moment, the elevator door opened with a ding.</p>
<p>At the end of the turned gaze, a man stood.</p>
<p>…Why are those people here?</p>
<p>Filling the elevator were members of the Special Security Team, and at the forefront, Lee Wooshin stretched his neck from side to side with closed eyes.</p>
<p>They swiftly crossed the auditorium with expressionless faces, heading straight to the stage. The gazes of roughly seventy newcomers were immediately drawn to the stage.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lee Wooshin, with one cheek bulging as if he had forgotten to swallow candy, grabbed the microphone.</p>
<p>“Hello, I’m Lee Wooshin, the head of the special security team in charge of the basic training.”</p>
<p>His voice was bland and uninspired, but everyone’s attention was on him nonetheless.</p>
<p>He was over six feet tall, with a torso that extended well past the shoulder line of his suit, making what should have been a well-fitting garment feel uncomfortably tight. The microphone he held looked tiny in comparison.</p>
<p>Any hint of flirting or fumbling was quickly dispelled.</p>
<p>“My team will be doing our part as instructors for your training.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong bit her lower lip unnecessarily.</p>
<p>From what she’d picked up as she wandered around the locker room, Blast’s training was quarterly. Not only basic training, but also winter training, cold weather training, autumn training, special training, and so on…</p>
<p>She often listened to complaints from members about each training session, but why did that person have to be involved in this training all the time?</p>
<p>It was uncomfortable, yet strangely thrilling.</p>
<p>“The basic training program lasts ten weeks at a private camp.”</p>
<p>The sound of his candy rolling echoed blatantly over the microphone, but Lee Wooshin didn’t raise an eyebrow or scratch his head to hide his annoyance.</p>
<p>“Through basic physical fitness, military martial arts, sea survival, and mock battles, we will work diligently to cultivate talent worthy of the Blast Agency…-”</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly in the middle of his speech. At that moment, their eyes met as if by chance.</p>
<p>He blinked his eyelids slowly as if he was seeing things.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The flowing explanation was interrupted, and the newcomers began to murmur.</p>
<p>It’s been almost two months, right? Seoryeong reluctantly made a nod under the piercing gaze. Though he was a man she hadn’t seen in a long time, facing the person who had cut her off felt awkward, so she turned her head away first.</p>
<p>Then, a popping sound erupted through the microphone and spread to everyone.</p>
<p>Seoyeong’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin covered the microphone with his large hand and turned his head toward where the Special Security Team member was seated. His neck was set at a right angle, and his bony frame stood out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>Why is she here? The words lingered faintly in Seoryeong’s ears.</p>
<p>“I asked you to check the list in advance. Is that lady really…”</p>
<p>“…It is, sir!”</p>
<p>The two of them exchanged a few words. Lee Wooshin closed his eyes and caught his breath. His chest could be seen rising and falling.</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
