            <p><strong>Chapter 58.2</strong></p>
<p>“What kind of heinous act are you planning, Agent Han Seoryeong?”</p>
<p>Only then did Seoryeong recall the series of questions she had asked last week.</p>
<p><em>Capturing people out of necessity.</em></p>
<p>But… the subject was completely different. She wanted to kidnap a NIS executive, not someone for sexual purposes.</p>
<p><em>Did my hesitating expression show?</em> Wooshin, misunderstanding something, let out a cold laugh.</p>
<p>With blood vessels bursting in his whites, he kept laughing while staring at her relentlessly, looking quite unhinged.</p>
<p>He began to pace the empty infirmary as if trying to cool off. The large man paced around with an air of danger that made it impossible to speak to him.Breathing heavily, his chest heaving, he finally shouted as if losing his mind.</p>
<p>“If you can find that damn husband of yours, is there anything you wouldn’t do?”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer his provocation. “So, is it your deepest wish to get screwed by other men?”</p>
<p>“Why do you talk like that?” When she glared at him, Lee Wooshin, who had been smirking, suddenly sported a cold expression.</p>
<p>He approached her abruptly and pushed her onto the bed. Seoryeong, who was already struggling to stand, collapsed onto the mattress.</p>
<p>In an instant, the man straddled her.</p>
<p>“Eh!”</p>
<p>She could feel his heated breath close by. Seoryeong held her breath for a moment, overwhelmed by his presence.</p>
<p>Underneath the black lenses, she was certain that his cruel, gray irises glinted like blades.</p>
<p>“What if you end up having sex with me and I turn out to be just like your husband?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>His iron-hard knee wedged between her thighs. His gaze, looking down at her as he braced himself on the mattress, was icy.</p>
<p>“Does that make me a candidate for your husband?”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“Is this what the kind of husband you’re trying to find by rolling over on your back looks like? Open your eyes.”</p>
<p>He forcefully grabbed her chin, making her hardened gaze slowly travel over his face.</p>
<p>A furrowed brow, a sharply sculpted brow bone, a perfectly straight nose, and a sinister yet handsome set of eyes.</p>
<p>Even a cursory glance told her that his face was very different from Kim Hyun’s, whom she often traced with her fingers. Lee Wooshin was a completely different breed, a totally unfamiliar face.</p>
<p>From the beginning, his distinct appearance had never overlapped with her husband’s. Yet, his domineering attitude made Seoryeong feel utterly humiliated.</p>
<p>Their eyes locked in a tangled mess.</p>
<p>“I thought you were just filled with venom, but why do you act so naïve? Do you think sleeping with another man will really make you understand? Do you think you can tell because of love?”</p>
<p>“Get real. There’s nothing easier to fake than sex.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“You know it yourself from sleeping with your husband.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong squirmed, not wanting to hear more.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin had a tendency sometimes to be bitterly cutting, even when he was usually frivolous. She tried to push him away, but her shoulder only got painfully pinned down. Heat radiated inexplicably from his palm.</p>
<p>“With more than seventy sex positions out there, don’t you think a guy can fake a bit of pleasure? Your belief that you can find your husband because of love is so absurd that it makes me furious just looking at you.”</p>
<p>For some reason, their desperate eyes glared at each other intensely. Suddenly, Seoryeong was seized by a strange emotion.</p>
<p>Looking at the man who was acting wickedly with a shaky gaze, a nagging doubt creeps into her mind.</p>
<p><em>Why was he so angry? Could his rage have nothing to do with me?</em></p>
<p>Could it be that he’d lost someone overnight, too? But the instructor had given up on finding them, and she hadn’t, so perhaps he despised her every time he saw her.</p>
<p>Seoryeong ignored the fragments she glimpsed in an instant, blinking her eyelids.</p>
<p>“Even after being treated like that, if you think love is omnipotent, you make wrong choices based on strange confidence. Those things end up blinding your eyes and losing your judgment.”</p>
<p><em>Just like that damn sex list. </em>Lee Wooshin muttered harshly as if his face was burning with anger.</p>
<p>Seoryeong exhaled quietly through her nose and focused on the man in front of her. His occasional outbursts of anger and cynicism touched her heart strangely.</p>
<p>“I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>His glaring eyes suddenly calmed down then.</p>
<p>“I’ll help you find your husband.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened, almost like a lantern.</p>
<p><em>Lee Wooshin… would help me find my husband?</em></p>
<p>It was a completely unexpected statement. Despite his promise to help, he wore a mockingly cynical expression.</p>
<p>Seoryeong couldn’t tell if this was kindness or a threat, so she couldn’t react at all.</p>
<p>“I’ll bring someone who looks exactly like your husband, all of him.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her wet eyelashes soon lost their moisture.</p>
<p>“Whatever I say from now on, don’t resist. That’s my condition.”</p>
