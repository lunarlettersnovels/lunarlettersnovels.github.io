            <p><strong>Chapter 61.1</strong></p>
<p>Bang, bang—! The sound of gunshots hitting the center of the target made the shoulders of those gathered flinch.</p>
<p>Inside the indoor shooting range, the team members who had taken recovery shots were gathered.</p>
<p>Despite wearing bulletproof vests and shooting earmuffs, they shuddered at the vibrations transmitted through the air.</p>
<p>“The Mozambique Drill is a shooting technique where you shoot twice in the body and once in the head.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, who had pierced the target’s head, continued in a calm voice while wearing a pistol holster over a black rash guard.</p>
<p>“If you aim for a headshot and just scratch the face by bad luck, you’re only giving the opponent more time to retaliate. This technique of two shots to the body and one to the head was designed to compensate for that risk.”</p>
<p>Despite holding a loaded gun, he showed no sign of tension.</p>
<p>His natural movements as he tapped his thigh to release the magazine conveyed a sense of boredom. It wasn’t that the gun suited him, but rather that he seemed like the type who would stir someone’s insides with its barrel.</p>
<p>As wood fragments scattered from the pierced board, Lee Wooshin’s eyes met hers.</p>
<p>For some reason, his impassive gaze gradually sharpened as he looked at her meaningfully.</p>
<p>“If you’re skilled, you can neutralize a human target with just three shots. The Mozambique Drill is about stopping your opponent for sure. It aims to freeze them in place, even if it means killing them.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“So even with the fewest rounds, you can critically injure your opponent.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange chuckle at the end of his words made her feel sick to her stomach.</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s brow tightened, and she glared at him warily, but the indoor range was uneventful, as if her intense sixth sense was nothing more than an illusion.</p>
<p>By the end of the training, there were only about twenty new recruits left in the Blast Company.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of instructor Ki-Taemin, they took the time to touch, disassemble, and assemble various firearms. Soon, they learned how to grip the firearms and how to shoot, and they practiced with painted rubber bullets.</p>
<p>And now, they had reached the stage of watching the instructor’s demonstration firsthand—.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin silently loaded bullets into the magazine one by one, then extended his arm. His half-lidded eyes still looked down at Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>At the same time, loud screams erupted from all around. She didn’t know what came first. Seoryeong’s body staggered back, and a heavy pain spread through her side.</p>
<p>Bang—!</p>
<p>The continuous gunshots rang like shattered glass in her eardrums, and metal casings clattered to the ground.</p>
<p>Wait, what is… this?</p>
<p>“Even if the first two shots don’t work, don’t panic and quickly shoot the third bullet in the head. The key to the Mozambique Drill is ‘aiming again’ to ensure you sever the final lifeline.”</p>
<p>With an unflinching face, he reloaded the gun with a click.</p>
<p>Did I just… get shot by that bastard?</p>
<p>Her eyes widened in shock and then quickly twisted in pain. Another bullet pierced her sternum before she could react.</p>
<p>It hit her bulletproof vest, but the pressure felt like a punch crushing her ribs, momentarily making it hard to breathe. Staggering, Seoryeong glared at him as her teammates supported her.</p>
<p>The acrid smell of gunpowder filled her nose, making it undeniable that she had been shot. Looking down, she saw two unmistakable bullets embedded in the thick layers of her bulletproof vest.</p>
<p>As reality set in, anger boiled up to the point of making her scalp tingle.</p>
<p>“Why? Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>Then, the man who casually emptied the chamber glanced at her.</p>
<p>“Still, these are 22 LR bullets, so they’re small and less powerful. I specifically chose something small and light to avoid bruising our dear Agent Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You want to pick up the shell casings?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong irritably took off her bulletproof vest and threw it to the floor. She approached as if she might pounce at any moment, but Lee Wooshin just smiled calmly.</p>
<p>“Instructor, this time you’ve really crossed the line…!”</p>
<p>“What, is this also like workplace bullying?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Still, I think getting hit by a bullet is better for Cadet Han Seoryeong than other things.” Lee Wooshin continued to look at her with an inscrutable smile. Regardless of Seoryeong’s flushed and furious expression, he maintained the same tone as he concluded his explanation.</p>
<p>“Always remember, if the shot aimed at the head misses and only grazes the cheek or ear—”</p>
<p>He flicked Seoryeong’s forehead, cheek, and earlobe in succession, like giving a light tap. Before she could push away his inconsiderate touch, his hard thumb pressed against her collarbone.</p>
<p>“Here, right in the middle of the collarbone. Disable them even if it means severing the cervical spine.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong felt a heat emanating from his hand. Whether it was from his touch or the lingering pain in her side, she couldn’t move for a moment.</p>
<p>As he addressed the other cadets, Lee Wooshin suddenly turned and whispered to her.</p>
<p>“Yeah, someone told me that you’re being a little too daring.”</p>
<p><em>I don’t think he’s talking about the collarbone.</em></p>
<p>Seoryeong could only furrow her eyebrows in a strange premonition.</p>
