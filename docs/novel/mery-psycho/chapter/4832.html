            <p><strong>Chapter 30.2</strong></p>
<p>“Sigh… This really isn’t the time to be lying down like this. Please take a look right away!”</p>
<p>“If you bring more ice from outside.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Only if Jin Hojae does something nice first will I be willing to consider your request.”</p>
<p>“No, Team leader, you shouldn’t ask for favors in exchange for managing our team.”</p>
<p>As he pointed outside with his chin, Jin Hojae’s mouth trembled nervously. “Well then, I’ll just read it out loud for you.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin never showed interest in anything other than the assigned tasks, as if he could switch off like a light. He was remarkable, no, extraordinary, with his mission, and being laser-focused helped.</p>
<p>Eventually, Jin Hojae began reading the newly arrived announcement in a loud voice.</p>
<p>“Asking for participation as a training instructor for the Blast New Recruit Basic Training Program…”</p>
<p>“A training instructor?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, who had been only staring at the clouds, raised his eyebrows subtly.</p>
<p>“Yes, and this has been assigned to our team.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“After returning from Africa, they want to use us to train new recruits…! What’s the point of making us do such trivial tasks when our value is so high?”</p>
<p>“Because He Channa died, our schedule for the next six months got messed up.” Lee Wooshin said flatly.</p>
<p>“Team leader, she’s not dead yet.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Then you’d better get up and go.” Lee Wooshin said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a request; it was an order to act quickly so he could be of use sooner, coming from the mouth of a man who was as languid as a beast in the sun.This unnerved the subordinate Jin Hojae.</p>
<p>At that moment, a man with a pale, sweaty face, as if he had just washed, quickly scanned the device Jin Hojae was carrying. “This… doesn’t seem trivial.”</p>
<p>“Team leader, what would a princess know?”</p>
<p>Jin Hojae, who used to maintain some level of courtesy in front of Lee Wooshin, spoke bluntly.</p>
<p>“It says here that we can directly select and fill the vacancies in our team.”</p>
<p>“Huh…!”</p>
<p>Two members of similar height began playing with wet towels, hitting each other with the long towels like whips, hitting each other’s heads, cheeks, chests, and shoulders, but there was no one to stop them.</p>
<p>The individuals who had just exchanged blows also engaged in casual conversation.</p>
<p>“I wish we have younger ones.”</p>
<p>“We did have younger recruits before, but they quit after a short while, that’s why.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so why do they keep quitting?”</p>
<p>Now, they picked up their towels and began judo. The game favored the one who grabbed the other’s collar first.</p>
<p>“Kitaemin, isn’t it because of you? You keep being stubborn, building walls, being neurotic, and being grumpy, so the newcomers can’t adapt and leave.”</p>
<p>“You crazy bastard, it’s not because of me, it’s because of you. They were here for just one day and you made them drink like a fish, slept in your house’s entrance, and forcefully dragged them into the sauna, that’s why they ran away.”</p>
<p>“You antisocial idiot, that’s called camaraderie.”</p>
<p>“You moron, that’s called abuse.”</p>
<p>They glared at each other’s collars, then simultaneously turned to look at Lee Wooshin.</p>
<p>“What kind of new recruit would you prefer, Team leader?”</p>
<p>A man, half awake amidst the familiar commotion, yawned. Then, after checking the time, he silently rose from his seat like a shadow.</p>
<p>The person who had been lying with his long legs propped up on the table suddenly moved smoothly, sharp as a feline predator. He tightened his untied combat boots and said, “As long as they don’t bother me.”</p>
<p>The ice rolling around in his mouth had already melted away.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ice clinked into a whiskey glass, and the deep amber liquid seeped between the cracks.</p>
<p>In the CEO’s office located on the top floor of the Blast headquarters.</p>
<p>Chief Kang Taegon stood in front of the glass walls, swirling his transparent glass. The man, unmoved by Seoul’s unending night skyline, soon made a call.</p>
<p>Blast had offices not only in Seoul but also in Hong Kong and St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Recently returned from a business trip to the overseas branches, Kang Taegon ran his fingers across his forehead with the glass in hand. Despite treading on the splendor of the city, he drank as if parched.</p>
<p>A composed voice responded through the receiver. Kang Taegon exchanged pleasantries briefly before getting straight to the point.</p>
<p>“We should be able to find female agents on our end.”</p>
