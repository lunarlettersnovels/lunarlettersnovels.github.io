            <p><strong>Chapter 104.1</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong couldn’t breathe—her body shook uncontrollably.</p>
<p>A surge of fire roared through her lower abdomen, leaving her completely numb.</p>
<p>“Don’t think about anything right now,” came a firm, almost grounding voice.</p>
<p>“Ah…!” she gasped, the pain ripping through her like jagged shards of glass.</p>
<p>Her skin felt like it was about to tear. Although she was used to the pain from her numerous training sessions, this feeling of being ripped apart was hard to get used to.</p>
<p>However, Lee Wooshin seemed determined, and he pressed down on her shoulders, making her entrance erswallow his member all the way to its base.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ha…!”</p>
<p>A white light burst in front of her, and her breath caught in her throat.</p>
<p>Unintentionally, she tried to get up, but Lee Wooshin grabbed her and sat her back down. It felt like everything was in place. Her thighs were trembling from the feeling of her internal organs being pushed upwards just from the insertion.</p>
<p>“What about the condom?!”</p>
<p>“The movements of happily married couples are predictable, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“Ha… ha…”</p>
<p>“You should be able to read this much, at least.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s eyes contorted, and he held his breath. The swollen glans touched a very deep spot, and her insides churned. It felt like it’s all the way in…</p>
<p>Yet, he seemed unsatisfied, and he forced the thick shaft in even further.</p>
<p>His balls were pressed tightly against the widely opened entrance.</p>
<p>She felt like she was truly going to die… All she could do was gasp for air, her mouth hanging open as she struggled to breathe.</p>
<p>“Let me come first, just once.”</p>
<p>His voice no longer had any leeway. He quickly lifted her pelvis and grasped her buttocks. His organ was remarkably big that even a slight lift of her buttocks made her internal walls contract at once.</p>
<p>The sound of their hearts beating rapidly, pressed against each other, was indistinguishable.</p>
<p>“Hu… hu…”</p>
<p>Was it this hard to accommodate a p*nis? However, his, which was bent upwards like her husband’s, definitely had a direct pressure tp her lower abdomen. The rounded glans began to crush the inner walls.</p>
<p>Every time their flesh collided, a thud, thud sound echoed.</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s body only moved mechanically, rising and falling, yet her breath growing shallower with each passing moment.</p>
<p>His hands gripped her waist, steadying her as his lower body took over, his movements precise and unyielding. Each thrust sent a sharp, resounding collision between his powerful thighs and her tender skin, leaving her flushed and reddened.</p>
<p>Her energy drained away, and all she could do was let out ragged sighs, her body surrendering to the overwhelming sensation.</p>
<p>“Ah… huh… hnn…”</p>
<p>The sight of the iron rod-like shaft thrusting between her widely spread legs was visually shocking enough. She worried that this memory would linger for a long time…</p>
<p>“Look at you, your eyes are completely glazed over.”</p>
<p>She blinked her dazed eyes and met Lee Wooshin’s deep gaze. It looked like ashes left after a fire, or the mist of a chilly dawn.</p>
<p>Seoryeong unconsciously bit his lips. She opened her mouth and clumsily but greedily sucked on Lee Wooshin’s tongue.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>Then, his p*nis suddenly twitched inside her, releasing something hot.</p>
<p>“D*mn,” Lee Wooshin cursed briefly.</p>
<p>He seemed slightly flustered, biting her shoulder and pressing his forehead against hers.</p>
<p>“Ha, ah, ah…!” At some point, he flipped her over and laid her on the bed. Their legs tangled messily, and their lower abdomens pressed tightly together. The connection between them remained sticky and unbroken.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Their chests rose and fell with heavy breaths, and they stared at each other for a while, as if in a staring contest. Lee Wooshin was the first to devour her lips.</p>
<p>Their tongues intertwined messily.</p>
<p>“Ha… ha…”</p>
<p>The lewd sound of sucking tongues made her body temperature rise uncontrollably. The instructor, who always had a commanding and dull attitude, now had an oddly seductive taste.</p>
<p>The clinging, wet mass was suitably sticky and warm.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t be happening, she shouldn’t be feeling this way. She wanted to be hurt, to be trampled on…</p>
<p>Seoryeong unconsciously wrapped her arms around his neck. A low moan escaped from him. Their tongues, tangled roughly, delved even deeper.</p>
<p>Their tongues brushed lightly at first, then tangled with more urgency as Lee Wooshin pressed his thigh firmly between her legs.</p>
