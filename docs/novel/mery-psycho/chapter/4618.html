            <p><strong>Chapter 140.2</strong></p>
<p>Swallowing hard, Seoryeong ran her hands over the hard ridges of his muscles. His breath hitched against her skin, and in one fluid motion, he yanked his shirt over his head, stripping himself bare.</p>
<p>The sheet followed immediately after, leaving his pale, gleaming skin fully exposed. He stared at her in silence for a moment then, without warning, he latched onto her chest.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>His soft lips wrapped around her n!pple, sucking hard enough to make her gasp. At the same time, his fingers pinched the other, rolling it between them. Heat coiled low in her belly, making her brows knit together.</p>
<p>“Nh! Haa… ha…”</p>
<p>Every small movement sent ripples through the mattress. Her body responded instinctively, breaths spilling from her lips in hot, uneven bursts.</p>
<p>“Haa! Instructor!”</p>
<p>Her own voice, thick with ar0usal, made her stomach twist in revulsion. But her body betrayed her. Her n!pples, already sensitive, hardened further under his relentless attention. He switched sides, taking the other into his mouth, his wide tongue gliding over the peak in slow, deliberate strokes while his hands worked her body with practiced ease.</p>
<p>“Hnngh….”</p>
<p>She looked down at her breasts, glistening with his saliva, and her core clenched in response. Seoryeong bit her lower lip and buried her fingers in his hair. He sucked harder, scraping his teeth over her stiff peaks.</p>
<p>“Nngh… Ah…!”</p>
<p>Her hips twisted each time he pressed down on the sensitive buds. His rough hands mapped the curves of her waist, stomach, and breasts, stroking every inch with heated purpose.</p>
<p>The ache between her legs deepened. Their lower bodies aligned seamlessly, and she felt his ar0usal—thick and rigid—even through his pants.</p>
<p>When his fingers brushed over his belt buckle, she spoke.</p>
<p>“Instructor, be gentle today.”</p>
<p>His hands stilled, the buckle half-undone. He frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“Not like last time. Make it feel real… like love.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I think… it’s okay to try that now.”</p>
<p>His lips curled at her words, amusement flashing in his eyes.</p>
<p>“You’re saying some pretty hurtful things.”</p>
<p>He tilted his head and unz!pped his pants.</p>
<p>“Have you ever pretended to love someone?” She asked.</p>
<p>As soon as the zipper came down, his erect penis was revealed, sticking out above his drawers and pressed against his lower abdomen. Seoryeong’s eyes trembled as she slowly moved her gaze from the base to the tip.</p>
<p>She scrutinized his shaft, as if trying to memorize every detail, and then grasped him with her palm. His furrowed brow deepened with each passing moment.</p>
<p>How could she not have recognized him, despite having his erect pen!s right in front of her? She felt a surge of self-loathing, and her eyelids fluttered with shame.</p>
<p>Was it because he was circumcised? Because he didn’t have any pubic hair? Had she really thought that was enough to rule out the possibility that he was her husband?</p>
<p>What had blinded me, after all? What misguided preconceptions had led me to overlook the man right in front of me, Kim Hyun?</p>
<p>“Hmmph!”</p>
<p>He reached down and grasped her cr0tch, his fingers rubbing against the folds.</p>
<p>The rough sensation of his two fingers spreading her vulva wide and stroking her, touching the red tip, sent shivers down her spine. His hot hands continued to rub between her legs, teasing her sensitive spots.</p>
<p>Seoryeong let out a low moan, covering her eyes with her arm as if she was about to cry.</p>
<p>‘The one who had blinded me was none other than myself. It was my own mind, clouded by my desire to deny the truth, that had obscured my judgment.’</p>
<p><em>‘I had been hoping that it wouldn’t be true, and that had led me to avoid the truth. My own foolishness, which had instinctively sensed the painful truth and tried to escape it, was the problem.’</em></p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>As her body slowly heated up, a slippery liquid began to seep into her, making her feel wet and sticky somewhere.</p>
<p>He completely stripped off his pants and und*rwear, leaving a trail of sticky kisses all over her body. Every time he sucked on her skin, a light current ran through her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I’m a bit in a hurry today too.”</p>
<p>“Hmmph!”</p>
<p>He leaned in between her legs. The sensation of his wet skin rubbing against hers made Seoryeong grip the sheets tightly. His hot breath on her vulva made her cl!toris throb nonstop.</p>
<p>He continued to caress the area between her lab!a, using the tip of his t0ngue to lick her thoroughly and then sweeping his tongue across the entire area.</p>
<p>“Hmmph… Ah…”</p>
<p>Her excitement grew to a fever pitch, with no end in sight.</p>
