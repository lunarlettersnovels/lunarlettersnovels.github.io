            <p><strong>Chapter 142.1</strong></p>
<p>“Aaah, aaah!”</p>
<p>Still, her p**<em>y throbbed from the relentless rhythm, stirred into overdrive by the way he had found her sweet spot—completely, undeniably. He lowered his mouth again, latching onto her n</em>pple with a hungry pull.</p>
<p>Yes, this was it… How did I not know?</p>
<p>How did I go so long without knowing this…?</p>
<p>A storm of emotions surged through her—ecstasy, confusion, pain—all tangled and rushing too fast to grasp.</p>
<p>“Hmph, hmph, ahhh…”</p>
<p>Her chest rose and fell with frustration, her breasts trembling from the force of their movements. Their hips collided, a sharp rhythm building as the friction between them deepened.</p>
<p>Her breath hitched as he drove into her swollen, aching p***y, hitting the exact point where every nerve seemed to converge like sparking wires.</p>
<p>Her inner walls clenched around the steady, punishing thrusts—then suddenly, he pulled out, gasping, brows drawn tight.</p>
<p>“Ha, ha, ha…”</p>
<p>A tremor coursed through his arms, braced on either side of her, his shoulders straining as he held back. Lee Wooshin gritted his teeth, tightening his abdomen to suppress the urge to c*m. He pressed his index finger against the tip of his glans and turned his head side to side, jaw clenched.</p>
<p>“F*ck… whoa.”</p>
<p>Still catching his breath, he slid his hand down and found her c**t again. Seoryeong’s vision went hazy as jolts of pleasure stabbed through her. Her slick coated his fingers, the sensation almost unbearable as he touched her swollen flesh.</p>
<p>“My foot… it’s not serious enough to cause all this worry. The surgery went fine, I’m healing well, and I was only out earlier… to look for you.”</p>
<p>Her eyes blurred. Maybe it was a relief—to let herself drown in sensation, using it to hide everything she couldn’t bring herself to say.</p>
<p>He gathered the wetness pooling at her entrance and rubbed her c**t in fast, deliberate strokes. Her toes curled. Her body felt like it was on fire. A moan spilled out of her lips, raw and unstoppable.</p>
<p>Her stomach tightened—she was close. She flipped over, overwhelmed. Tears streaked silently down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Seoryeong bent her knees and lifted her hips without thinking. A second later, she felt warmth splash across her bare backside.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong… you’re such a b*tch…”</p>
<p>“Actually, my husband and I are completely separated, so—”</p>
<p>The jagged rhythm of his breath against her spine suddenly paused.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to know what it was like to really hold you.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I guess now I do.”</p>
<p>She wiped her eyes on her forearm and stared into the space ahead. It was oddly reassuring not to see his face. But instead of what she’d braced for, he shifted beside her—no longer reaching for her, but resting against her back.</p>
<p>They lay there, facing the same direction. Neither of them spoke. The only sound was his breath, steady and warm against the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>She had no idea what he was thinking. The fluttering in her chest unsettled her. She tried to shake it off.</p>
<p>“…If nothing else,” he murmured, “I really do feel lighter now.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>The moment she turned her head to face Lee Wooshin, her lips curved into a smile.</p>
<p>“Ugh—!”</p>
<p>Their wet bodies collided with greedy urgency, tangled together as heat and cold clashed in their mouths. Tongues pressed and explored—wild, searching, relentless.</p>
<p>At the same time, a strong hand swept up the inside of Seoryeong’s thigh. A hard, erect p***s drove into her again, unyielding.</p>
<p>“Hmph—!”</p>
<p>Her eyes rolled back as the penetration, primal and raw, sent her to the edge. The tingling pleasure bloomed into breathless desperation, and the rhythmic sound of skin slapping against skin echoed in the room.</p>
<p>Large hands gripped her lower belly and hips. Puck, puck—each time her body buckled under the weight of his thrusts, he pulled her back against his waist without effort.</p>
<p>Whether flat against his chest or bent forward in submission, her position shifted at his command.</p>
<p>Seoryeong. Han Seoryeong, he murmured as he thrust deeper. Every time he lifted her waist without pause, it felt like her mind might tear loose from her body.</p>
<p>The heat twisting in her core seemed ruled by his will. And yet, something in her wanted more—faster, rougher.</p>
<p>“Uh… stop, stop!”</p>
<p>“Why? Was I too harsh?”</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>Each time his hand landed on her flesh, a jolt shot through her, like something deep inside was being shaken loose—though she couldn’t name what.</p>
<p>Still, Lee Wooshin didn’t slow down. His hips moved like a wedge driving into her, her skin burning with the contact. Only then did her body begin to tremble under the weight of the pleasure.</p>
<p>Her inner walls, once yielding, began to twitch uncontrollably.</p>
<p>“Instructor, sir!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong cried out, her voice breaking. But she bit her lip hard, swallowing the scream. The sensation that started in her abdomen had raced down her thighs, curling into her toes.</p>
