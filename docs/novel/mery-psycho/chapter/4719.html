            <p><strong>Chapter 88.1</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong gasped in shock, her mouth opening wider. His wet tongue wrapped around hers, moving sensually and aggressively.</p>
<p>Her arms flailed uselessly as Lee Wooshin twisted his head, pressing their bodies even closer together.</p>
<p>His jaw moved with hunger, like he was devouring her, and as his tongue sucked faster, her saliva spilled over.</p>
<p>She was pushed further back, and every time her lips parted, his tongue surged back in, rubbing relentlessly against her tender inner mouth until her cheeks puffed out from the pressure.</p>
<p>This was different.</p>
<p>This was nothing like when they fell off the cliff during the camp. Then, Lee Wooshin had looked panicked, his face openly showing how big of a mistake it was.</p>
<p>Now, the sense of danger was real, and her hands trembled as an uncomfortable tension built inside her.</p>
<p>The two of them, as if by mutual agreement, never mentioned what happened that day again. Their shared mistake was just the right level of bearable. At times, they could sense something smoldering beneath the surface, but ignoring it was easier.</p>
<p>But now…</p>
<p>Seoryeong felt like the contact of their lips would melt her. She staggered back and braced herself on the table. Jin Hojae’s tumbler clattered loudly to the floor after bumping into her hand.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin twisted his head further, as if nothing could stop him now.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>Despite the muffled noise she made, Lee Wooshin didn’t let go. He held her face in place, pressing down with his lips. Her slender neck gave way helplessly to the relentless kiss.</p>
<p>His sharp tongue probed and rubbed against the inner walls of her mouth, as forceful and deep as if he were thrusting with something else. His pointed nose buried itself in her cheek, and the sound of their breath mingling was ravenous.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a kiss anymore. His lips were rough and burning with friction, their wet flesh colliding.</p>
<p>A heat that seemed to melt her from the inside out made her body feel as if it were being controlled. She couldn’t breathe properly, and gasped for air. Their mingled saliva was so thick now it was hard to tell whose was whose.</p>
<p>No! Seoryeong frowned, desperately trying to regain her composure, but when his eager tongue suddenly brushed against the roof of her mouth, she couldn’t hold back the moan that escaped her.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>Her thoughts of Kim Hyun were slipping away, dissolving into nothing. She could barely resist the man’s force, as he pried her mouth open again and again, his hands gripping the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>The moment she let her guard down, his tongue entwined with hers, producing obscene sounds. Her mind grew foggy, and heat filled the corners of her eyes. That sensation terrified her the most.</p>
<p>Especially in the dead-silent office, where every breath and lustful noise echoed in her ears.</p>
<p>The sound of him sucking hard on her lower lip, the wet noise of his tongue swirling inside. The feeling jolted her nerves, tingling in unfamiliar ways. Her breath hitched, and a low, vulgar sound mixed with her exhalation.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Her eyelids fluttered as if in a spasm, and she was running out of breath. What were we talking about before? Her thoughts wouldn’t come together.</p>
<p>But then, the cold, forgotten sensation snapped her back to reality. Seoryeong gripped the gun tightly.</p>
<p>Now, this was really the end of the line. His condescending attitude since their first meeting, the disdainful glances that sometimes pierced through her patience—was this greedy, controlling behavior where it all led?</p>
<p>Still… Don’t come any closer. She thrust the gun’s barrel into his abdomen, pressing it hard.</p>
<p>His heavy breathing paused for a moment.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“.”</p>
<p>Their locked lips broke apart for a split second, and their eyes met. Then, Lee Wooshin scooped her up with one arm, lifting her onto the edge of the table where she had been pressed.</p>
<p>“Wha-!”</p>
<p>As if daring her to go further, he pressed his abs against the gun, positioning her fully on the table.</p>
<p>His large frame hovered over her, and then he grabbed her thighs, pulling them apart. His lips, thirsty again, crashed onto hers, biting her cheek once more before plunging into another kiss.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s eyes showed no fear of the situation. In fact, they almost begged for her to shoot him. The heat radiating from their intertwined lower bodies was more intense than their tangled lips. It felt like an unstoppable torrent.</p>
<p>“Wait!”</p>
<p>Despite her panicked plea, he only pulled her waist closer. It was as if he were saying that only she could end this situation. The barrel of the gun dug deeper into his hard, muscular abdomen. The vividness of that feeling sent chills through her.</p>
