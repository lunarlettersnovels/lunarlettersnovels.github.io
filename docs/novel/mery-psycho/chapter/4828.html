            <p><strong>Chapter 32.2</strong></p>
<p>The woman went white at that. It was almost pitiful to see her gaze waver so wildly.</p>
<p>But whether it was fear, an inferiority complex, or whatever, she looked away as if she didn’t care.</p>
<p>“At that time, I thought it might be fun to be kicked out of the gym. But I was too young. A kid with no parents and no money, if I were to be cast out into society with even the few remaining ties severed…”</p>
<p>She observed the kids training absentmindedly.</p>
<p>“I’ve always lived a boring life, senior.” Around sick, dying people. Silent as an observer, tending to their needs.</p>
<p>A decade later, now a woman, she was much more subdued and refined than she had been as a child, but that deep, hollow quality was still there.</p>
<p>“Until recently.”</p>
<p>The coach couldn’t take her eyes off the side of her face, and she asked brightly as if to dismiss my shameful secret.</p>
<p>“R-really? So, do you have something you like again now?”</p>
<p>At that, the corner of her mouth lifted, ever so slightly. It was enough to bring color to his otherwise blank face.</p>
<p>“Yes, I did. It was the thing I liked most in the world.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“The only thing that ever mattered to me.”</p>
<p>But the smile faded in the blink of an eye, leaving a blank face with nothing left.</p>
<p>She felt like she was fidgeting unnecessarily and blurted out something.</p>
<p>“Would you like to hold an iron bar for a change?”</p>
<p>Then an unexpected laugh burst out in front of her. Seoryeong didn’t hide her beaten lips and showed her casted arm. The coach looked disappointed, but nodded reluctantly.</p>
<p>It was then that Seoryeong’s face stiffened. She stared at the blue mat as if she’d been hit over the head. There was a strange amusement in her intense gaze.</p>
<p>“What, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Her senior asked, still a little stunned, and she stretched up with a smile. Shelooked relieved, like she’d finally solved a problem she’d been stuck on.</p>
<p>“Can I get on the mat for a moment?”</p>
<p>“Of course…!”</p>
<p>With the coach’s permission, she waited patiently to remove her shoes and socks. Then she stepped onto the mat as if she were stepping into the ocean.</p>
<p>The feel of the blue mat against her bare feet was like coming home. At that moment, she understood why she had come all the way up here like a salmon.</p>
<p>She needed a stage to stand on again.</p>
<p>That’s why her heart was beating so hard.</p>
<p>It had been a short time, only an iron, but this was definitely a field of survival. She remember being inexperienced, foolish, and all the more wild and fierce for it.</p>
<p>Then, her memories overlapped with her time in Thailand.</p>
<p>“–.”</p>
<p>Yeah… I’d been in the thick of it once, too.</p>
<p>Seoryeong hadn’t gotten off the mat in quite some time, but when she did, it wasn’t the cheering and yelling of the crowd that she remembered.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The sound of gunshots ricocheting off her eardrums and the voice of a person collapsing in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>She wanted to see it again. Not as a game where I had to memorise and perform moves on the board, balancing on the bars, tumbling on the floor, balancing on the beam, but as a game where everything broke, exploded, and fell apart.</p>
<p>Perhaps her senior’s words were right.</p>
<p>The place she needed to be now was on a whole new mat.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Two months passed quickly while she recovered.</p>
<p>In the last month of the year, she bought a cheap bottle of wine at a convenience store and drained it all by herself.</p>
<p>She was back to square one.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing she’s learned from her time at her alma mater, it’s that you have to pick up the bar yourself.</p>
<p>When you step onto the mat, no one is going to jump or roll for you. Gymnastics is a solo sport, and I had to fill the stage with my own strength.</p>
<p>Did I ever try to borrow someone else’s hand? Maybe I did, secretly.</p>
<p>Someone with a dangerous skill but no conscience. Someone with a bad personality and a lot of dissatisfaction with society.</p>
<p>Was that actually me…?</p>
<p>So it’s back to square one.</p>
<p>No, it’s the beginning.</p>
