            <p><strong>Chapter 175.2</strong></p>
<p>“Those in power are always looking for an excuse to eliminate subordinates who are more capable than themselves. They only think of replacing them with someone less intelligent and less threatening. Do you know how many spies of the Kremlin are here?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“What’s inside the belly of the beast is none other than Solzhenitsyn.”</p>
<p>Yuri’s mind was in disarray. It was a story that didn’t resonate with her. Yet, he felt as if he were endlessly entangled in the repeating food chain.</p>
<p>“Vacation is over now, Yuri.”</p>
<p>Maxim Solzhenitsyn turned his back, as if he had finihed imparting his final lesson.</p>
<p>The smell of decay was pungent in the air.</p>
<p>That night, Yuri wandered around Ivan’s room with a pale face. The horrific fate of the dark-haired child he had seen today lingered in his mind, causing a throbbing headache.</p>
<p>Then, at least one person. He had to gradually get them out of this Winter Castle. Yuri was consumed by that thought all day long.</p>
<p>At just fourteen, he felt miserably inadequate to grasp the full intentions of Maxim Solzhenitsyn, a revered prime minister and prominent political scientist.</p>
<p>However, today, he felt as if he had caught a glimpse of his grandfather’s true thoughts. If he were to abandon the Kremlin now… it was beyond his imagination.</p>
<p>So, when the tiles rattled, Yuri opened his suitcase without hesitation.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, little one. Just bear with it a little longer.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Before the child could react, Yuri pressed down on the suitcase cover with all his might. In the inadequate explanation, the child kicked the bag with a thud, but Yuri clenched his jaw and zipped it shut.</p>
<p>“Let’s go outside the mansion together.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>At those whispered words, the child’s struggles began to subside.</p>
<p>“I’ll take you out soon. You see the mood light inside, right? Don’t be scared, just play for a moment.”</p>
<p>On that quiet night, Yuri resolved to run away.</p>
<p>Creak, creak. The wheels rolled across the garden.</p>
<p>However, those responsible for the mansion’s security were stationed at both the front and back gates in three shifts, and no matter how much of a Solzhenitsyn he was, sneaking out at this hour with a suitcase would look suspicious.</p>
<p>As expected, a sharply defined guard blocked his path.</p>
<p>“Young master, what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“You’ve been working hard.”</p>
<p>Yuri smiled brightly and suddenly shook hands with the guard. The man’s eyes widened at the feel of the bills through his palm. When he frowned in confusion, Yuri calmly said, “I’m just going to the lakeside for a bit.”</p>
<p>“…The lakeside?”</p>
<p>The man’s gaze fell on the skates hanging around Yuri’s neck.</p>
<p>“It’s too late. May I accompany you?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>At that moment, as Yuri’s eyebrows subtly shifted, a sound came from the suitcase. The guard’s narrowed eyes quickly darted down. Yuri lifted the suitcase as if scolding the child inside and set it down again.</p>
<p>“Sir, I know it’s rude, but may I check inside the suitcase?”</p>
<p>“You’ll regret it if you do.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“What do you think is inside?”</p>
<p>“Stop with the nonsense and open the door,” Yuri commanded coldly. The guard bowed his head and obediently opened the main gate, but Yuri’s expression darkened even further.</p>
<p>‘Ah, da*n it, I’ve been caught. The moment I step through this door, there’s a high probability that my grandfather will be informed.’</p>
<p>However, Yuri continued to walk without stopping, even as he bit his lip.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>He didn’t know what state of mind allowed him to run without a break. As soon as he arrived at the lakeside, he immediately opened the suitcase, and as the child tumbled out, his hair was caught.</p>
<p>“Alright, hold onto that tightly.”</p>
<p>The child, who had been sulking, suddenly exclaimed, “Wow…” as Yuri quickly changed into his skates and began to glide across the ice.</p>
<p>The rush of air made the child raise their arms up to their ears, bursting into laughter. The tinkling sound was like precious jewels, and the skate blades wobbled beneath her.</p>
<p>“Hey kid! Stay still!”</p>
<p>It was a cute voice that warmed his heart. He almost hit the brakes, but not knowing when or how his grandfather would come after him, he gritted his teeth and picked up speed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the child clinging tightly to Yuri’s waist wiggled their bottom.</p>
<p>“Don’t move, or you’ll fall!”</p>
<p>At that moment, coincidentally, something fell to the ground with a thud. Yuri’s spine tingled as he turned around, but fortunately, it wasn’t the child that had fallen; it was the mood light he had been holding.</p>
<p>The fall must have pressed the switch, for a music box began to play a monotonous melody as it turned.</p>
<p>The transparent ice, reflecting the night sky, was illuminated.</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>The child’s whisper tickled his ears.</p>
<p>Red, orange, and yellow hues were layered over the entire ice. As he glided across the ice, a carousel spun beneath his feet.</p>
