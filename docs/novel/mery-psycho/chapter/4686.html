            <p><strong>Chapter 105.1</strong></p>
<p>“Do you even know what I thought about every time you were asleep?”</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>“The truth is, I’ve been wanting to do this.”</p>
<p>His thrusts grew more intense, each movement hitting deeper. Suddenly, he grabbed Seoryeong by the waist with both hands and lifted her, her hips rising off the bed and hanging in mid-air.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah…! Instructor, wait… just—!”</p>
<p>Her legs instinctively wrapped around his lower body, holding on for balance. Kneeling now, Lee Wooshin pulled her pelvis toward him, his motions rough.</p>
<p>Her legs fell open, exposing everything, as his length moved with a relentless, almost punishing rhythm. They were completely entwined, no space left between them.</p>
<p>“Ah, not there—please, not there!”</p>
<p>He explored an unfamiliar place. Even with just a slight change in angle, it went in even deeper. Her lower back trembled, and sweat dripped from her forehead. She couldn’t control her lower body, which was lifted and suspended in the air.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin didn’t say a word, just thrusting intensely. Every time he entered her, her mind went blank and fragmented. The sound of their bodies colliding was loud. The tender flesh in the tightly closed union was already bruised.</p>
<p>“Hak, now, wait, ah, ah, ah, ah!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong twisted her waist, experiencing the ultimate pleasure for the first time. He was thrusting into her inner walls, pressing down on her deeply. Finally, a massive clim*x swept her away.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>A clear liquid burst out. Her v*gina pulsated.</p>
<p>Any rational thinking left in her was swept away like a tide, and her body trembled.</p>
<p>For a moment, she couldn’t hear anything, as if her ears were blocked.</p>
<p>At this rate, she might soon pass out and fall asleep. But Lee Wooshin didn’t seem to intend to let that happen as he buried his face in her again.</p>
<p>“Uh…! That’s enough, stop…!”</p>
<p>“Come to your senses, this is something you started yourself.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Let me live a little longer.”</p>
<p>“No… uh!”</p>
<p>“This is what you wanted, to live together.”</p>
<p>He said, spreading her legs apart.</p>
<p>The stimulation of the sensitive area at the tail of the clim*x was extreme torture. She had wanted to feel alive, but not like this, being ravaged by someone.</p>
<p>The rounded, blunt tip began to enter her, spreading her open. It was as if Lee Wooshin had taken over her empty mind.</p>
<p>Seoryeong closed her eyes, muttering curses she had learned at the training center.</p>
<p>“Ah…, shiii–”</p>
<p>The man thrust into her, spreading her inner walls wide. Her body, which was about to evaporate, was being ravaged until it disappeared.</p>
<p>At this point, it was clear why Lee Wooshin hadn’t taken a stimulant but a suppressant instead. He should have taken two or three more doses.</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s eyes fluttered silently. He moved in and out of her at an incredible speed.</p>
<p>Although she couldn’t feel much sensation in her lower body, the friction heat from the open entrance was vivid.</p>
<p>The sound of their bodies colliding grew louder. This was brutal s*x.</p>
<p>“Ha, ha, ha, ha…”</p>
<p>He pulled out his member from her entrance only to thrust in much harder again. Every time he did it, he would intentionally shake his hips or rock Seoryeong’s pelvis.</p>
<p>This would cause her to gasp and take short breaths, her mouth open in a silent scream.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin asked, readjusting his grip on her pelvis. His question was ridiculous, considering the way he was ravaging her with his powerful arms.</p>
<p>Regardless of her confirmation, he pressed his glans against her and thrust his hips down.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>The intense pain caused her inner walls to contract. It was clear that her release was over, but her swollen cl*toris seemed to be throbbing even more. Her vision was already blurry, and she had lost count of how often this had happened.</p>
<p>“Ugh… ugh…!”</p>
<p>He captured her burning buttocks and thrust deep into her sensitive spots. At the moment of deepest penetration, she felt his rod pulsating to its maximum. The hot liquid burst out, and the mattress shook.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin buried his face in her neck, holding his breath. For ten seconds, he tightly grasped Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“――.”</p>
<p>This was his second release. Yet, his hard-on remained lodged inside her, refusing to subside. The man continued to thrust into her, making her clim*x multiple times.</p>
<p>“F*ck…”</p>
<p>A long, relaxed sigh escaped his lips. The c*ndom, now filled with his seed.</p>
