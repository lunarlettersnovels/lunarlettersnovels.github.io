            <p><strong>Chapter 123.2</strong></p>
<p>The sharp intensity he usually carried had drained away, leaving behind a drowsy and unguarded expression.</p>
<p>His gaze, uncharacteristically dull, trailed sluggishly a beat behind her movements.</p>
<p>Was he fully conscious? She skeptically leaned against the bed frame at an angle. That was when Lee Wooshin furrowed his brow and spoke in a languid tone.</p>
<p>“Why do you look so beautiful?”</p>
<p>A faint chuckle escaped his lips. What on earth? Seoryeong frowned.</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to work when you look like that…”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“I’m not going back to the office. Just let them fire me. I’ve got tons of money saved up.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But you… Did you walk out of a photo or something?”</p>
<p>What is he even saying? She blinked in confusion. Watching him slur and ramble incoherently, she suddenly remembered the mention of sedation.</p>
<p>Should she call the medical staff? She hesitated, glancing at the red emergency button, but decided against it. He would likely wake up naturally.</p>
<p>“Instructor, get a grip.”</p>
<p>“Huh…? Who are you then?”</p>
<p>His eyes blinked again, slow and deliberate, like a turtle.</p>
<p>“Your subordinate. Forget it. Just lie down.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Also, keep your mouth shut so you don’t regret anything later. That’ll help you come back to your senses.”</p>
<p>“Whatever. Just bring me my phone.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Maybe I should just knock him out again, she thought. In the quiet room, Lee Wooshin’s rambling—low and firm—sounded clearer than she expected.</p>
<p>“I need to call my wife.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s expression shifted subtly. Uncomfortable and confused, she thought she must have misheard him. But the clarity in his gaze told her otherwise.</p>
<p>So, right now, is he still groggy from the anesthesia, unable to think straight, and calling for his wife? Only then did it hit her—Lee Wooshin had an ex-wife.</p>
<p>She froze, feeling as if someone had smacked the back of her head. A chill surged up her neck at the unexpected revelation.</p>
<p>Her grip tightened on the bed frame. Lowering her gaze to hide her shaken eyes, Seoryeong asked in a steady voice, “What’s your wife’s name?”</p>
<p>“Do you think I’d go around blabbing about my lovely wife to just anyone?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me—!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong frowned in frustration, a bitter laugh escaping her lips.</p>
<p>Who was the one trembling in rage when his wife cheated? The words rose to her throat, but she hesitated. Should she really shock him like this right after he woke up?</p>
<p>What had he said about his wife before? She was young, inexperienced, and someone he had coddled.</p>
<p>Yes, Lee Wooshin had said something like that to her. But she had been unfaithful, they had divorced, and Lee Wooshin had sworn never to dwell on the past again.</p>
<p>But if he was unconsciously calling out for her now, didn’t that reveal his true feelings? One thing was certain—the more she talked to him, the worse her mood became.</p>
<p>“Just keep quiet and avoid saying anything you’ll regret tomorrow,” she said firmly.</p>
<p>“You’re the one being reckless with your words. What’s your department?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong sighed, exasperated. “I’m with the Special Security Team.”</p>
<p>“Your department name sounds pathetic, and you look like someone put you together based on a template.”</p>
<p>His sharp gaze scrutinized her as his furrowed brow deepened. His eyes, which had seemed dull moments ago, began to cool as they scanned her face. The longer he looked, the more his mood seemed to sour.</p>
<p>“When I ask for my phone, I mean bring it to andd you’ll type for me.”</p>
<p>Suppressing another sigh, Seoryeong dragged her nails across her brow in frustration.</p>
<p>“I’m sending a message to my wife, so make sure you type it exactly as I say, without any typos.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong couldn’t help but clutch her hair in disbelief, letting out a sharp breath.</p>
<p>I haven’t slept a wink, haunted by someone’s shadow every time I close my eyes, and the first thing you do when you wake up is look for your ex-wife? Her emotions flared inexplicably.</p>
<p>Seoryeong froze in place, rigid as if struck by lightning. Her brows furrowed as she felt disappointed over him.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Me? No way…</p>
<p>This feeling, spreading like wildfire, was something she couldn’t ignore. It was a defiant, almost destructive emotion that refused to let things slide, even if it meant ruining the moment.</p>
<p>“…Get a grip, sir. Your wife cheated on you, left, and your marriage fell apart ages ago.”</p>
