            <p><strong>Chapter 48.2</strong></p>
<p>“If the client wants, they’ll kill innocent people. They’ll even train criminals in bomb-making. And yet, you still want to come here?”</p>
<p>He sharply criticized the team he belonged to. She had felt it even in Thailand, but he had a clear standard in unexpected areas.</p>
<p>She had always thought of him as someone who enjoyed sitting atop good and evil. Had she been working with such thoughts all this time?</p>
<p>“Don’t get cocky just because you caught a mouse by backpedaling,” he said, glaring at Seoryeong, warning her of her arrogance from a small win which was her saving He Channa’s life in Thailand.</p>
<p>His face, devoid of the smile that had always been a habit, was more grim and chilling than she had thought.</p>
<p>Seoryeong stared at his stern expression without blinking. What lay beneath the pretty façade was not candy but festering wounds.</p>
<p>For the first time, her interest in Wooshin began to grow faintly. Her indifferent gaze slowly sharpened.</p>
<p>“If you get caught doing such things.”</p>
<p>Once again, electricity sparked smoothly from the stick.</p>
<p>“Even if this electric rod is shoved into your mouth, ears, and genitals.”</p>
<p>“No one will come to rescue you.”</p>
<p>“No one will come to save you.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin grabbed her chin and coaxed her like a petulant child.</p>
<p>“Do you understand? That’s exactly what you’re getting into.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Soon, his rough hand gripped her chin with the force to crush her joints.</p>
<p>“It’s easier, more efficient, and more economical to just discard something that’s clearly broken than to try picking it up again. That’s why Blast doesn’t take full responsibility for the safety of its employees.”</p>
<p>Crackling, irregular noises echoed continuously.</p>
<p>“In South Africa, they throw female prisoners naked into cells full of men. They rip their mouths with metal pliers or drive spikes under their fingernails. Do you know what happens when a person is left submerged in filthy sewage for days? Their entire body rots.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong, overwhelmed by the dark, oppressive atmosphere, found it hard to open her mouth.</p>
<p>“This kind of training is never revealed outside the unit, and these tortures are still commonly used on the other side of the world. If you get involved in dirty work at Blast, especially under me, what do you think will happen?”</p>
<p>He glared at Seoryeong and threw an electric baton against the wall.</p>
<p>“Your body will break, Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>Breathing heavily, his broad chest heaving, he spat out his words.</p>
<p>“You’re the type who hesitates to take off your pants in the water, clueless about what’s really going on. That’s why I decided to teach you myself what you’re overlooking.”</p>
<p>With those words, Lee Wooshin grabbed her chest. Seoryeong’s body tensed at his violent touch, but she quickly twisted her waist and glared at him with contempt.</p>
<p>“Let go…!”</p>
<p>“This is the kind of situation your so-called resolve can’t solve.”</p>
<p>When his large hand lifted her lower chest, her breasts were painfully crushed.</p>
<p>“I know you’re trying hard, but this is the reality. Completing the training isn’t the end. If a female agent gets captured overseas—”</p>
<p>“I said, let go.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong hissed through gritted teeth, her eyes fierce.</p>
<p>“There’s a high chance you’ll experience this kind of hell.”</p>
<p>He warned coldly, shoving his hand under her clothes. The heat of his touch on her tender skin was repulsive.</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s body convulsed, but he quickly subdued her waist, lifted her bra, and crushed her sensitive flesh in one move.</p>
<p>“The torture inflicted on female prisoners is especially brutal.”</p>
<p>“You… bastard!”</p>
<p>“Ah, now you’re starting to get it? Why should you let those bastards tear your flesh apart?”</p>
<p>“Let go…!”</p>
<p>“You think you can handle this situation with mere resolve? Darn it, you need more than mental toughness.”</p>
<p>Their eyes, both twisted with anger, clashed head-on.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 49.1 (R-rated)</strong></p>
<p>“How many times do I have to tell you? You’re a hindrance.” His true intentions finally surfaced, echoing the same conversation they’d had at the hospital.</p>
<p>She let out a frustrated sigh, gritting her teeth. “Seoryeong, just get out.”</p>
<p>He spoke harshly, his jaw clenched. “Don’t even look back. Go live a normal life.”</p>
<p>She stared at him, her eyes burning with unshed tears and unspoken words. Why did he always do this? Why couldn’t he just let her stay?</p>
<p>Outside the torture room, outside the training center, outside Blast Agency—Lee Wooshin always seemed intent on pushing her away. It was as if he couldn’t bear her presence, couldn’t tolerate the sight of her. Every conversation circled back to the same point, an endless loop that always ended in the same place.</p>
<p>He grasped her breast from underneath and rubbed her n!pple repeatedly. He scratched it with his nails, drew circles, then painfully twisted the protrusion.</p>
<p>Ugh…! Seoryeong bit her lip hard to hold back her breath. She didn’t want to let out any sound, so she forced down her trembling breath, causing her flat stomach to rise and fall deeply.</p>
<p>His hands were burning hot, but his eyes, watching her every reaction, were chillingly cold.</p>
<p>“Just one word is all it takes.”</p>
<p>At that moment, he released her breast and spoke.</p>
<p>“Say you’re not going to look for your husband anymore.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Just that one word, and the torture training ends immediately.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, something inside her felt cold.</p>
<p>“Is that… what you want to hear, Instructor?”</p>
<p>“The human mouth is fragile, and 48 hours with an instructor is very long.”</p>
<p>Though his answer was subtly evasive, it was clear to anyone that it was a threat. A hint of his cruel intent to force her into submission was evident in his words.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes tightly, suppressing the turmoil inside her.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin withdrew his hand from under her raised shirt and stared at his palm for a moment before clenching his fist tightly.</p>
<p>“Do you really want to find that worthless husband, even while enduring this humiliation?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“This is the last time I’ll speak sensibly.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin gave her a choice. Thus, she found herself at a dead end.</p>
<p>“Stop now, Han Seoryeong. Don’t cross the line any further.” His face, as he spoke, was dark, like the depths of an abyss.</p>
<p>In fact, all of Lee Wooshin’s criticisms were valid, leaving her with no rebuttal.</p>
<p>It was true she had come this far on a foolish impulse, and it was true she hadn’t been aware of the harsh reality. She had been so obsessed with the thought of Kim Hyun that she hadn’t fully considered the implications of becoming a member of Blast Agency.</p>
<p>But—if she had to make a choice…</p>
<p>Instead of answering, she spat at him.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>The light flickered, and an irrevocable silence filled the room.</p>
<p>“If you’re not going to bring my husband back, mind your own business.”</p>
<p>He stood there, as still as an ornament fitting this old, filthy space. Not even his eyelashes moved. Seoryeong instinctively watched him closely, on high alert.</p>
<p>With each flicker of the light, his face seemed to change, shadows falling differently on his brow and nose, making him look somewhat eerie and unsettling. His expression remained unreadable, yet she couldn’t look away for even a moment as his impression constantly shifted.</p>
<p>Eventually, Lee Wooshin nodded slowly.</p>
<p>As if he understood perfectly. At that moment, his eyes, which seemed worn out, slowly began to brighten. He stuck out his bright red tongue and licked Seoryeong’s saliva from his lips.</p>
<p>“The instructor’s words sound like nonsense, right?”</p>
<p>Seeing his face smiling as if it could enchant a ghost made her hair stand on end. She had a bad feeling. Sure enough, a bucket of water was suddenly dumped on Seoryeong’s body.</p>
<p>“Hup…!”</p>
<p>The unexpected cold shock made her jaw tremble. However, the man, acting as if a switch had turned off somewhere, calmly reached for the buckle of her pants.</p>
<p>“What the…! Let go…!”</p>
<p>The touch jolted her awake, and she frantically thrashed her legs and twisted her body. Driven by fear, her feet kicked his hands, chest, shoulders, and stomach relentlessly. Just as Wooshin, with raised eyebrows, was about to subdue her like an enraged bull, she struck back.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
