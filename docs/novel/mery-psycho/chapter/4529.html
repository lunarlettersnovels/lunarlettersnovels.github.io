            <p><strong>Chapter 186.2</strong></p>
<p>“Instructors don’t like to repeat themselves. Get lost before I count to three.”</p>
<p>It was incredibly annoying to see a trainee loitering in front of the instructor’s quarters when they should be eating in the tent. In an already tense situation, everything around him felt like thorns poking at him.</p>
<p>He sensed that he was in a dangerous and unstable state. At times like this, he shouldn’t meet anyone.</p>
<p>“Did you come back from looking for the photo?”</p>
<p>Before she could finish her sentence.</p>
<p>“Cough, cough!”</p>
<p>Asha, grabbed by the collar, pounded on the instructor’s shoulder in surrender. That had been the signal that had been followed like a rule until now.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, it was not a relationship between instructor and trainee; the man’s eyes were fierce as if facing an enemy that needed to be killed.</p>
<p>“Photo? What photo?”</p>
<p>This isn’t it! Asha held her breath, hiding her frustrated expression. Although she had lost the bet, she wanted to quickly confess to the instructor to gain a moral advantage over the other members. If it was selfishness, it was because she wanted to be favored by the instructor.</p>
<p>But the man she saw up close was completely empty. She had mistakenly thought he might be kinder than he seemed because he didn’t discriminate or show favoritism.</p>
<p>Seeing those burned-out eyes up close sent a chill down her spine. It was a complete misjudgment.</p>
<p>“The one you kept in your pocket!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Rali took it!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin forcefully released her collar. Asha, unable to regain her balance, ultimately fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Even as he looked down at her in that vulnerable state, the man showed no expression.</p>
<p>No matter whom he looked at in the unit, they were all compared to Seoryeong. Regardless of gender, it was rare to find a member as fierce, quick-witted, skilled, and with the instinct to compensate for their lack of strength as she was.</p>
<p>She was exceptional even as a new recruit, which made him want to push her out of the unit even more. She shouldn’t be allowed to step foot in a place like this.</p>
<p>Thinking of her naturally brought a pain that felt like his insides were melting away. He staggered under the intense agony that twisted his muscles. As he gasped for breath like someone who had forgotten how to breathe, Asha jumped up and reached out her hand. But with a sharp slap, her hand was brushed away in an instant. It was a tremendous sound, as if she had been slapped.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch me.”</p>
<p>At the piercing glare, she flinched back. The way he allowed no approach from others was reminiscent of a wild beast that was difficult to tame.</p>
<p>‘Rali, I’m sorry…’ Asha bit her lip as she stared blankly at the retreating instructor. ‘You guys, that photo must be intact, absolutely!’</p>
<p>“Rali, you need to put it back right now!”</p>
<p>Murmurs were heard from beyond the tent. Lee Wooshin’s dirty military boots stopped right in front of them. His darkened eyes showed no emotion.</p>
<p>“Damn it, who spilled water here! It’s already wet, and now you’re drying it out!”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know Asha is being sneaky? What if it all blows up!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, look at this photo. The groom’s face is different.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>A strange silence fell among the trainees.</p>
<p>“It definitely can’t be the instructor’s photo. It must just be a family wedding photo or something. Or…”</p>
<p>Rali, shaking his legs nervously, tried to act nonchalant.</p>
<p>“Maybe he still can’t forget about the married woman.”</p>
<p>At that remark, the trainees, who had been staring at the clock, turned their heads back together to look at the photo.</p>
<p>“I think the instructor is much better looking.”</p>
<p>“What’s the point then? He’s indifferent and cold. Women hate guys like that.”</p>
<p>“Do you think the instructor looks like that outside too? It’s like this because we’re at a training camp.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know basic human decency? A man with military habits is directive and autocratic in everything. Do you know how tough life becomes growing up under a military father? You have to fetch water in three seconds. If you even talk back a little, you’re done for that day.”</p>
<p>Rali continued, shaking his shoulders.</p>
<p>“But do you think a guy’s military nature just crumbles because the other person is a woman? Hell no! Those kinds of guys expect their wives to be strict in their support.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Can’t you tell just by looking at the photo left behind? The affection that was left has completely faded, and she’s run off with another man. Just think about how harshly he must have treated her. He kept hurting her and looked down on her…!”</p>
<p>He waved the wet photo around, speaking sharply.</p>
<p>“Be careful not to act all high and mighty later on. A woman who leaves will never come back.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Rali, getting excited, jumped up and said, “Should I try to imitate the instructor?”</p>
<p>“My wife is preparing dinner, cleaning the bathtub, folding clothes, and spreading her legs here! Ack—!”</p>
<p>Rali flew to the end of the tent in an instant. The trainees, looking as pale as corpses, slowly lifted their heads.</p>
<p>That day, the trainees saw that kind of expression on the instructor’s face for the first time.</p>
