            <p><strong>Chapter 29.2</strong></p>
<p><em>So, it’s Lee Wooshin who’s strange.</em></p>
<p>How could he so easily ask her to abandon Channa? Saying that he didn’t feel any particular usefulness from a human like her.</p>
<p>Why did he try to save only her in that moment?</p>
<p>It left an uncomfortable feeling.</p>
<p>“Do you have any orders for me?” Seoryeong asked. “I’ve already signed the confidentiality agreement,” she added.</p>
<p>Her answer made him laugh heartily.</p>
<p>“I won’t disclose what happened in Thailand. That was probably what Chief Kang wanted. It might not be just a thank-you visit, but perhaps to confirm this contract,” he replied.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you understand quickly,”  Chief Kang laughed so much that his cheeks bulged. He seemed pleased to have grasped his intentions immediately.</p>
<p>“Of course, the contract is my belief, but I do love adding a bit more. Human desires are as deep as an illness, you have to manage them for a lifetime.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong remained silent, pondering over his words.</p>
<p>“We have to give you favors occasionally. As a good will,” he said.</p>
<p>Seoryeong might not have known that this was Chief Kang’s way of managing people. Since secrets were weaknesses, luring those who witnessed or inadvertently participated in them with such sweet bait was a cunning tactic.</p>
<p>Giving them what they desired the most.</p>
<p>“So, I’d appreciate it if you straightly answer me this time. Do you have any wishes for me?” he asked openly.</p>
<p>Seoryeong momentarily lost her words at his overt proposal. The reason she had been absent-minded was always the same, even at this moment—because there was only one thing he wanted.</p>
<p><em>Kim Hyun. </em>Rebuilding the direct path to him.</p>
<p>“Do you also abduct people?” she asked.</p>
<p>“…!” He, who had been leisurely smiling, paused for a moment. Then, he blinked as if gauging the truthfulness of what he had heard.</p>
<p>“Depending on the situation. But… is that a request to hire Blast for such a task?” he inquired.</p>
<p>“If possible, to the Special Security Team.”</p>
<p>“May I inquire specifically whom you wish to abduct?” he pressed further.</p>
<p>“The Deputy Director of the National Intelligence Service.”</p>
<p>“…!” Kang’s expression froze for a moment.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s a higher rank, but the lower operatives are off-limits. They must be officers,” she clarified.</p>
<p>“…May I ask why?” he questioned.</p>
<p>The man seemed momentarily stunned as if struck by something.</p>
<p>The reason was that only a few officers knew the identity of the Black agent.</p>
<p>Seoryeong remembered the phone call the other agent received when she’d accused Kim Hyun of espionage. She wanted to meet with a man named “Deputy Chief.”</p>
<p>But she dismissed these secretive reasons with a single word.</p>
<p>“I want to do bad things, too,” she said.</p>
<p>To this, Kang Taegon merely pursed his lips as if pondering something.</p>
<p>“But do you have other requests? In exchange for saving Channa’s life.” he replied.</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s mind was set. She didn’t hesitate to exploit the situation with the unconscious Channa.</p>
<p>Just the thought of how to feed this tantalizing opportunity into her mouth made her eyes sparkle.</p>
<p>At that moment, Kang, who had been quietly observing Seoryeong, asked solemnly.</p>
<p>“…Miss, do you happen to have nightmares? Have you ever experienced symptoms of PTSD?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t,” Seoryeong replied puzzled, as if wondering why he suddenly asked such a dull question.</p>
<p>Kang remained silent for a moment, then stared at her as if seeing through her.</p>
<p>“Yeah, right. Why aren’t your eyes broken yet, considering everything you’ve been through since entering this hospital?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong responded with surprise. Her hand trembled slightly as his fingers brushed past her eyes.</p>
<p>“Am I not broken?”</p>
<p>“It seems not.”</p>
<p>He chuckled, running his hand over his chin. A sly glint flashed in his pupils.</p>
<p>“I don’t need guys who get PTSD. Those humane types don’t fit in this business. But you… it seems like you’ve completely let go of that.”</p>
<p>A satisfied glint lingered in his eyes. The sound of his hearty laughter echoed loudly in the hospital room.</p>
<p>Seoryeong couldn’t help but think of Lee Wooshin. His cold words that had once dismissed her, warning her not to look his way. Now, those assertions seemed to have turned completely around.</p>
<p>Seoryeong couldn’t determine whose words were right, but it was clear that she needed Kang Taegon now more than ever.</p>
