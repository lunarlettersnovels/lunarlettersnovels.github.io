            <p><strong>Chapter 177.2</strong></p>
<p>“It seems the guests don’t meet your approval.”</p>
<p>“No, it just feels like a gathering of your friends.”</p>
<p>“I specifically invited those who couldn’t break away from the Winter Castle.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>What his grandfather was gazing at was the circus roof that spread out like an umbrella.</p>
<p>“Addiction is a terrifying thing. Their eyes will turn red as they search and search for it.”</p>
<p>Yuri looked at his grandfather with a frown, trying to decipher his vague words, and shook his head.</p>
<p>It seemed he needed his grandmother. Even if their relationship was cold, having her by his side might help him regain his composure.</p>
<p>“I’ll go see Grandma. Where is she?”</p>
<p>The moment Yuri took a step, Maxim fiercely grabbed his hand. The grip was tight enough to make it impossible for him to move, and his hand throbbed.</p>
<p>While he had been held by the chin or shoulder before, this was the first time their hands had been clasped.</p>
<p>“They said she’s changing her clothes.”</p>
<p>His voice was as indifferent as usual, but there was a hint of bitterness in it.</p>
<p>“Perhaps… it’s the dress she’s always wanted to wear. Darya must have been waiting for today too. You can’t go.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Yuri, you have your role to play here. You need to greet the guests, exchange pleasantries, and smile kindly.”</p>
<p>The grip on his hand tightened. Perhaps that’s why his grandfather’s hand felt like a shackle.</p>
<p>“This is a moment to clearly show how much you have grown and how much you resemble me, Maxim Solzhenitsyn. So smile happily. As happily as you can.”</p>
<p>As he adjusted his grandson’s disheveled collar, he added, “That way, people will be curious about you.”</p>
<p>Yuri slightly furrowed his brows. The tone felt cold, contrary to the content of his words.</p>
<p>“Attention is power.”</p>
<p>For the first time, he saw a distinct smile bloom on his grandfather’s face. However, the way his handsome features twisted into a grimace made it look oddly like a scarred visage.</p>
<p>“It’s been quite a long time for you to earn your keep.”</p>
<p>The gentle touch that caressed his cheek felt soft, but it stirred no emotions within him. The boy, turning his head defiantly, could only think of one child as he looked at the perfectly set table, floral decorations, and the fountain flowing with alcohol and chocolate.</p>
<p>‘I must save that chocolate fountain. When I meet the child again, I’ll first apologize, check her arms, and then dunk her into this sweet fountain.’</p>
<p>‘I needed time to raise him as my accomplice.’</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The fireworks shooting pollen were hard to hear. Yuri squinted one eye and asked, “What did you say?”</p>
<p>He looked at Maxim, who smiled quietly while Yuri covered his ears in surprise.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sound of string instruments gently filled the air, and all eyes turned to Yuri.</p>
<p>Naked gazes mixed with curiosity and desire. Some pressed the camera shutter, while others whispered behind their hands.</p>
<p>Yuri sighed inwardly and walked up to the stage his grandfather was pointing to. The boy raised the glass in front of him and skillfully delivered his greeting.</p>
<p>“First of all, I’d like to thank everyone for coming to my fourteenth birthday party.”</p>
<p>Maxim looked at his smoothly grown grandson and was the first to clap. The guests began to clap vigorously along with the Prime Minister. Maxim laughed without hesitation.</p>
<p>What could possibly be thicker and more blinding than the smoke of the upcoming horrific accident? Soon, the Solzhenitsyn couple would burn to ashes without leaving a trace.</p>
<p>Five ministers from the president’s direct department and sixteen other ministers. Directors from the Intelligence Agency… The funerals of such prominent figures, the ongoing memorials, and the endless rescue operations…</p>
<p>While the nation’s systems fell into paralysis, Darya’s fate would be recorded as deceased and quietly forgotten.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Isolating the president by wiping out all his close aides and only leaving behind the fake bone powder of the Sakhalin children.</p>
<p>Once the world begins to report on the terrorist “Rigay Viktor,” Russia would be unable to act hastily, even to hide his motives for the crime.</p>
<p>It would take quite a long time to clean up the vacant positions, the regime, and this chaos, and the dismembered dictator would be pushed aside by the rising new forces, with all of Russia’s attention focused on the only heir who survived the tragedy.</p>
<p>That would be the best bait to hide Darya and the rats escaping into the outside world.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, who lived loyally until the end.</p>
<p>To the little Solzhenitsyn he left behind.</p>
<p>Darya, are you leaving far away just as you hoped?</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>There was no answer. But as if that was enough, the man smiled like a seasoned veteran who had seized the upper hand.</p>
<p>There would be a paradise wherever he fled.</p>
<p>The moment he bared his teeth in a bright smile, everything erupted.</p>
<p>The ground beneath him sank, and the dark red smoke began to rise first. The deafening roar that followed came later, unable to keep up with the speed at which the mansion exploded.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The terrifyingly rising smoke reflected in Yuri’s eyes.</p>
<p>He could see the once-mighty Winter Castle slowly collapsing. People were buried under the crumbling outer walls like dominoes, screaming in terror.</p>
<p>As Yuri blankly stared at the tragedy that was about to befall him, his body suddenly sank down. An enormous roar and vibration shook him violently.</p>
<p>As if waiting for it, the stage collapsed somewhere underground, and darkness descended.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Explosions rang out above his head in succession, but his eardrums seemed to have already lost their function, replaced by a persistent ringing.</p>
<p>What… what is happening right now? Yuri cradled his head, recalling the hellish scene.</p>
<p>People were buried and blown apart. Brains were spilled, and shoes were scattered. This was terrorism. It was a terror attack.</p>
<p>Who dared… who in the Winter Castle!</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by unbearable agony, Yuri screamed without realizing it. He had to go up. He needed to get out.</p>
<p>The moment Yuri’s bloodshot eyes flashed.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Team leader! A panicked voice rang in his ears.</p>
