            <p><strong>Chapter 101.2</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeon’s eyes were dry, but how Wooshin’s hand brushed her cheekbone made her shiver.</p>
<p>She swatted his hand away desperately.</p>
<p>“Don’t… Don’t touch me like that. It reminds me of my husband…!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin froze, then let out a dry, bitter laugh. He grabbed her collar, pulling her upright until their eyes met, his gaze blazing with anger.</p>
<p>“So that’s why you vulgarly sucked my dick?”</p>
<p>With his enraged voice, he let out a suppressed breath.</p>
<p>“When you’re harassed or mistreated by your fellow officers, what did I teach you to do?”</p>
<p>“No matter how much I made you kneel, why would you suck on that fishy thing? Why would you put it in your mouth, making me want to die!”</p>
<p>The emotions that had been breaking through his teeth suddenly burst out. Seoryeong flinched at the ear-splitting shout. The man’s furrowed brow became more grotesque with time.</p>
<p>“Do you think I don’t know you’re trying to do the exact opposite of the sex you had with your husband?”</p>
<p>The man spat out cynically and tightened his grip on her chin. In an instant, he grabbed her ankle and spread her legs. His thick fingers dug into the gap between her half-removed underwear.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>It was a chilling sensation. The foreign feeling of raw flesh being pierced was excruciating.</p>
<p>“For someone who self-destructs like this, why can’t you just let go of him? While you tremble at even the thought of Kim Hyun, why can’t you spit on your husband’s memory?”</p>
<p>Her inner walls tightened so much that the shape of his fingers was deeply imprinted. Lee Wooshin began to roughly shake his middle finger, which was buried to the root.</p>
<p>The loveless fingers only stirred her intimate parts a few times. Woo-shin remained expressionless, as if all this was merely preparation to make the opening usable.</p>
<p>“Of course I can’t let go.”</p>
<p>Seo-ryeong retorted, pulling up the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>“The things you hate enough to want to kill, those are the things you can’t really let go of. You might forget what you loved, but the desire to kill… that can’t be abandoned…. That, that never goes away…”</p>
<p>She laughed self-deprecatingly, as if swallowing even a blade into her stomach. The worse this encounter became, the better she would feel.</p>
<p>The worse this sex became, the better she would feel. At that moment, his hardened tip collided with her dry entrance, penetrating her body without warning.</p>
<p>As it penetrated to the root, her vision blurred. It felt like her delicate inner walls were being severely battered.</p>
<p>“Ugh! I’ve never had anything in my life, so I don’t know what it means to let go of anything… I really don’t know…”</p>
<p>Her breath was cut off, and an intense moan escaped her lips.</p>
<p>“It’s just something that has to end with death,” Her dark, serious eyes were genuine. Then, Lee Wooshin muttered an unknown curse. He grasped the sofa with one hand and wiped his face with the other, still thrusting his thick pillar deeper into her.</p>
<p>The sensation of being completely filled was overwhelming. Seoryeong weakly scratched his arm in this unrealistic situation. Their rough breathing synchronized.</p>
<p>And at the moment when the torn opening seemed to rip apart, she let out an involuntary whimper.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“――.”</p>
<p>His waist suddenly stopped moving silently. The pillar-like sensation that had filled her entire body suddenly pulled out and then thrust back in, pushing her body up.</p>
<p>“Ugh!” It felt like her womb was being pierced. The thick, pillar-like penis that had pulled out and thrust back in made her body tremble like she was being punched in the gut.</p>
<p>The man, who had grasped her pelvis with all his might, precisely targeted a spot on her inner wall. The sensation of being penetrated without any consideration was overwhelming.</p>
<p>“Has your husband ever inserted it without any foreplay like this?”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!” His swollen tip repeatedly rammed into the deepest part of her belly. The pain built up due to her dry entrance, and no sound could escape from between her parted lips.</p>
<p>It felt like the hidden nerve endings inside her were being stimulated, but there was no pleasure or thrill. So, she was satisfied.</p>
<p>This was exactly what she had wanted.</p>
<p>“Answer me, is this the kind of s*x you wanted?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s body suddenly froze at her clear and resolute answer. He lifted his head, and a bitter expression spread across his face.</p>
<p>Hugging her waist for a moment, he dropped his head and let out a long sigh that seemed to never end.</p>
<p>“F*ck.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin pulled himself out of her, and scooped her up in his arms. He nibbled the nape of her neck and began to move toward the master bedroom.</p>
<p>She gasped and turned her head to avoid his lips at all costs, but in a sudden and strange turn of events, Lee Wooshin rubbed her back and buttocks nonstop as she broke out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>The mattress squeaked as they climbed onto the bed, and he pulled her pants completely off and spread her legs wide apart.</p>
<p>The moment his breath touched her private parts, she realized what he was about to do, and she jerked upright and cried out.</p>
<p>“No, don’t do that, don’t do that!”</p>
