            <p><strong>Chapter 15.1</strong></p>
<p>The two of them tangled up and began punching each other, the sound of crushing flesh and pounding bone echoing around the room.</p>
<p>“Uh……!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a woman passing by with a stack of plates was sent sprawling by one of their elbows.</p>
<p>Some of the plates rolled across the floor with a shattering crash; others crumpled and fell on top of her.</p>
<p>But despite the noise, the two men, already dazed, continued to pound away.</p>
<p>She clutched her hands to her waist and couldn’t get up for a while. Seoryeong coldly took off her rubber gloves and approached her.</p>
<p>Puck-! Something heavy struck her in the head, knocking her off her shoulder and onto the floor.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>She didn’t even bother to laugh at the sudden blow. Red, sticky, hot, and sour sauce dripped down her face, and kimchi and namul dip dripped from her hair. Her forehead throbbed and tingled where the plate hit.</p>
<p>The men, who hadn’t stopped punching through all the commotion, were now rolling on the floor again, ready to break the utensils. It didn’t seem normal that they couldn’t cut a minute.</p>
<p><em>That’s what you call a patient. A hypertestosterone patient. </em>Seoryeong nodded, remembering what her interviewer told her and helped the fallen woman up.</p>
<p>“I’ll sweep the floor today.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>She moved over and picked up the trash can. The woman, who had gotten fed up, said, “Don’t interrupt me!” But it was too late; she saw Seoryeong pick up a plate of food waste and dump it directly onto the tangled group.</p>
<p>“Lunch break is over.”</p>
<p>All the noise died down and there was silence.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seoryeong, barely having washed up, quickly brushed off the leftovers and got into the elevator.</p>
<p>Because of her dirty white clothes and the smell of food waste, people’s gazes lingered. Especially those who shared the elevator with her wrinkled their noses and turned their heads away.</p>
<p>“Yes, she brawled with the guys…”</p>
<p>Seoryeong received a call and, after a long time, faced her interviewer again. Still, with a grim expression, she muttered with a sigh.</p>
<p>The man said he was from the Logistics Department. Seoryeong hid her unease behind a neutral expression and lowered her head.</p>
<p>Her embarrassment is evident.</p>
<p>The commotion in the restaurant spread like wildfire. The gossip about the young lady who poured food waste over the soldiers who were brawling.</p>
<p>That trivial gossip circulated much lighter on people’s lips than the talk about the vacancy in the Special Security Team.</p>
<p>“Last time I checked, Ms. Han Seoryeong was fearless and unapologetic….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you to make good food? Who told you to mess around there?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong just lowered her head even more. Through long experience, she had learned that avoiding eye contact at times like this would make things end faster than apologizing.</p>
<p>Everyone did. Whenever people saw her indifferent, unswerving gaze, they became even more agitated and heated.</p>
<p>She glanced at the dirty ends of her shoes.</p>
<p>“Well, I mean…. Technically, it was the fault of those who were fighting. Even though the men broke chairs and stepped on plates. I understand Seoryeong’s feelings. But still….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Among the fighting men, there was one with a particularly violent temper. His temperament was generally like that, but he seemed especially irritated by what you’ve done. You put yourself in a difficult situation. He was livid, screaming for us to bring you to him.”</p>
<p><em>Ah, that guy…. S</em>eoryeong’s eyes flickered.</p>
<p>There was one guy who was relatively rough and arrogant. While the two men hit by the food froze, one of them quickly regained his senses and swiftly changed targets, seizing Seoryeong by her collar.</p>
<p>The eyes, flickering with food particles, were ominously sharp. Fortunately, other men passing by rushed in and separated the two, but the last glance of those sharp, piercing eyes directed at Seoryeong was unforgettable.</p>
<p>“Ms. Han Seoryeong went too far.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“No one acts like you in a situation like that. They’re combatants, and Blast is a company that revolves around those combatants, and we’re the people who support them. Don’t you get it?”</p>
<p>… That’s when Seoryeong raised her head, which had been down the entire time.</p>
<p>“Sir, a physician must look at madam’s injured back.”</p>
<p>“Is that your only concern? The cleaning lady?”</p>
<p>“Those guys only have bruises and busted lips, but her back will be a long way from healing.”</p>
<p>“You have no idea what’s important right now…”</p>
<p>His crumpled forehead showed irritation. The chief messed up his already tousled hair even more.</p>
<p>There were many exemplary soldiers here, as well as a few troublemakers who had gotten into trouble and been kicked out.</p>
<p>Perhaps because it was a group of men who had only learned to use their bodies, there was no shortage of fights.</p>
<p>They were people who were naturally docile only in the context of rank and hierarchy, so once they got angry, things got complicated.</p>
<p>“It’s so irritating they hired me to handle trivial matters like this…”</p>
<p>He clicked his tongue and sighed.</p>
<p>“Just make sure you don’t have any contact with him again. Make sure you wear a mask, and–”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I’ll try to talk to Chief Jeong Pil-gyu from the Information Team once I see him. I would’ve buried the incident if it weren’t for that.”</p>
<p>“Sir, madam’s hurt her back-”</p>
<p>“Get out!”</p>
<p>He threw his hands as if he didn’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>She didn’t understand why he was so angry. Shaking her head, she turned around with a question that remained unanswered.</p>
<p>Just then, the irritated voice came back.</p>
<p>“At least take that towel…!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Do something about that mop.”</p>
<p>He angrily crumpled a paper cup and threw it into the trash can, but it hit the edge and bounced back. Geez… A muffled curse was heard.</p>
