            <p><strong>Chapter 187.1</strong></p>
<p>Despite running several laps in the high-altitude area, the instructor’s breathing was labored for the first time.</p>
<p>His calm gaze fell upon the photo that had dropped to the ground. His face, twisted to the point where it was hard to tell if he was angry or sad, suddenly became expressionless.</p>
<p>As he picked up the remaining photo, the wet part tore apart helplessly. The trainees squeezed their eyes shut.</p>
<p>The colors had run, making the face a mess, and the material was damp and sagging. He repeatedly examined the tattered photo with a pale complexion. His throat bobbed up and down roughly.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Under the quiet yet ominous gaze, the trainees felt their legs tremble. The instructor stared blankly into the air with unfocused eyes before carefully placing the half of the photo that featured his wife into his pocket.</p>
<p>Is this how it ends, just with a warning? It was a moment when the trainees exchanged glances. Before Rali could regain his senses, a strong military boot came flying in again.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Rali felt blood burst from beneath his nostrils as he fell backward. The instructor’s expression had been so restrained that even as his head shook from the relentless punches, Rali still wore a dazed look.</p>
<p>With each heavy punch, his cheeks felt like they were on fire. His head hit the ground, and his ears rang. He couldn’t even scream.</p>
<p>Inside the tent, aside from the sound of flesh being crushed, not a single breath could be heard. The trainees could only watch the one-sided violence with frozen eyes.</p>
<p>“Ugh, cough!”</p>
<p>Rali spat out sticky blood, gasping for air. Lee Wooshin flipped him over as he tried to crawl away, raising his fist again. The trainees all turned their heads and trembled as if they had made a silent agreement.</p>
<p>Standing tall, Lee Wooshin slowly unbuckled his military watch. Even after smashing a person’s face to a pulp, the instructor’s cold expression remained unchanged.</p>
<p>“I believe today’s training was hand-to-hand combat.”</p>
<p>He calmly rolled up his sleeves and spoke. His voice was extremely monotone.</p>
<p>“Everyone, attention.”</p>
<p>At the brief command, the trainees quickly stood up and assumed the attention position.</p>
<p>“We will resume training now.”</p>
<p>The eyes of the terrified trainees shook. Rali, who had been lying on the ground, stood up, trembling all over.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin grabbed Rali by the hair again and dragged him forward. Blood trickled down from his temple.</p>
<p>“Stand up.”</p>
<p>Rali raised his fist with a look full of hostility. It was a fight conducted solely with bare hands, without any protective gear or weapons.</p>
<p>The trainees could not move a step and had to watch the scene unfold. Fierce punches were exchanged, but Rali never managed to land a hit on the instructor.</p>
<p>Whenever Rali bent down to avoid a punch, he was hit squarely on the exposed temple, as well as between his left collarbone and shoulder muscles.</p>
<p>No matter how or where he tried to dodge, the instructor found the exposed areas and struck them with precision. When Rali lunged forward with his chest out, he was hit repeatedly in the abdominal aorta.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>We have to do this too? The trainees struggled to move their stiff tongues. Don’t be ridiculous, this is just getting beaten up!</p>
<p>As Rali screamed and reached out, this time his wrist was twisted. Even while staggering, he attempted a kick, but lost his balance and was knocked down by a kick to his planted foot.</p>
<p>“Always study and understand how the body reacts reflexively. No matter how the opponent moves, there are definitely exposed areas. There is always an opening.”</p>
<p>Rali, who had fallen helplessly, could no longer stand up. He simply closed his eyes and lay there, groaning.</p>
<p>“Next trainee.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin gestured coldly.</p>
<p>As the trainees exchanged nervous glances, Lee Wooshin pointed to one person. The selected member, pulled out unexpectedly, raised his fists with a tense expression.</p>
<p>As soon as the trainee lifted his arm, the image burned into Lee Wooshin’s retinas, and his eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>Suddenly, time seemed to slow down two or three times. Beyond the outstretched forearm, the opponent’s face was changing moment by moment. It became Kim Hyun, then Lee Wooshin,</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>and then it turned into the Seoryeong he wanted to see.</p>
