            <p><strong>Chapter 78.1</strong></p>
<p>“What the hell is up with that guy?!”</p>
<p>Inside the NIS communications room, an agent ripped off his headset, his face twisted in frustration. Na Wonchang, seated at his computer, sheepishly avoided eye contact, while Deputy Chief Joo Seolheon tossed her own headset aside, rubbing the back of her neck.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s sudden intrusion had taken everyone by surprise. Even the deputy chief, who had been feeding lines the entire time, found his hands frozen in shock.</p>
<p>Their carefully synchronized efforts, where each member played a different role to form a cohesive trap, began to unravel. In the end, they were forced to issue a blatant warning, even dropping the code name “Owl.”</p>
<p>“What is going on? The mission brief said the target had emotional deficits and would be easier to manipulate gently! But now there’s some random man by her side—!”</p>
<p>“Well, we’ve got the account information, so let’s wrap it up. Good job, everyone.”</p>
<p>“But, Chief! Could this mess today affect my performance review…?”</p>
<p>“Good work, Kang. You’re dismissed.”</p>
<p>With that sharp cut-off, the male agent shook his head and stood up, clearly frustrated. Once he left, the room fell into an oppressive silence.</p>
<p>Joo Seolheon twirling a pencil through her wavy hair, chuckled to herself. She massaged the back of her neck and glanced at the digital clock on the wall.</p>
<p>“Wonchang, do you know when a beast bares its claws?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“When it’s hungry. That’s when.”</p>
<p>Joo Seolheon picked up the coat she had lazily draped over her chair. It was time to tighten up some loose ends.</p>
<p>Na Wonchang remained rigid and breathless, unable to move until she left the room.</p>
<p>He had, after all, secretly contacted Lee Wooshin and given him some information, but he never expected that Lee Wooshin would veer off course and head straight to Owl’s lair.</p>
<p>He remembered how “Kim Hyun” would return from his so-called “newlywed home,” head back to their office, which was disguised as a medical equipment sales company, and mechanically draft his reports. During all that time, his face had remained expressionless and emotionless.</p>
<p>If anyone had grown attached to Owl, it was the person watching from afar—him, but never as much as Lee Wooshin.</p>
<p>But the team leader… had he lost his mind?</p>
<p>Sure, they got the account details, but the method… that was the problem.</p>
<p>“Team leader! What on earth were you thinking, making such a risky move?”</p>
<p>Na Won-chang’s face stiffened with frustration.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Joo Seolheon’s secondary office was located in a dingy, dilapidated neighborhood covered with reconstruction banners.</p>
<p>She passed by discarded mattresses, broken appliances, and piles of garbage and cigarette butts strewn all over the street, entering an old, elevator-less building.</p>
<p>There were no signs or nameplates to be found. She passed through the dimly lit stairwell, pried open a dented metal door, and stepped inside.</p>
<p>As she fumbled for the light switch, the flickering bulb illuminated Lee Wooshin sprawled across a torn leather sofa. She didn’t seem the least bit surprised as she shut the door behind her, letting in a gust of cold wind.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s been a while since I’ve seen your real face.”</p>
<p>He had an ice cream container resting on his flat stomach and was chewing on a pink plastic spoon.</p>
<p>Joo Seolheon shrugged her shoulders and sat down on the creaky, old sofa beside him.</p>
<p>“You’re refusing to share the plan regarding Owl,” he said bluntly.</p>
<p>Joo Seolheon let out a small laugh and crossed her legs.</p>
<p>“Does that matter? You need to quickly find the corruption line in Blast Agency. It seems like the National Intelligence Director is involved, but there’s no solid evidence. If we had that, both you and I could get what we want in no time.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“And if you’re hungry, don’t eat junk food. Eat something proper.”</p>
<p>“Did you know the owl joined as one of my subordinates?” Lee Wooshin informed her.</p>
<p>Joo Seolheon kept a calm expression but, for the first time, rubbed her temple as if she had a headache.</p>
<p>“Seriously, why did you end survival training so early? You could’ve added at least one more person to your team. We sent one of our agents to keep an eye on the owl, but he dropped out in the final stage.”</p>
<p>“..!”</p>
<p>“He wasn’t exactly incompetent. But can you believe it? Of all things, it was because team leader Lee Wooshin fell, cutting the training short. Unbelievable.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin ‘s lips curled into a dark smile.</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>“Like you’d know even if I told you. You probably slacked off as an instructor anyway.”</p>
<p>The disposable spoon cracked between his teeth. Lee Wooshin didn’t take his eyes off her and quietly waited for her to continue.</p>
<p>Even though he appeared calm, his cold and relentless gaze was like the Siberian wilderness. Joo Seolheon had experienced several times before what happened when he spushed back against that look—things blew up in her face.</p>
<p>With no other choice, Joo Seolheon spoke.</p>
<p>“His name is Dong Jiwoo, a rookie from the National Intelligence Service.”</p>
