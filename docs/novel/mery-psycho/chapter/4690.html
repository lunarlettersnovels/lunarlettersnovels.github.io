            <p><strong>Chapter 103.1</strong></p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Taken aback by the sudden tears, Lee Wooshin halted his actions.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time she had seen his, but she had never closely examined the tattoo, which, due to its eeriness, seemed almost like a carved spell.</p>
<p>Now that she saw it clearly, her heart began to race.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin held his throbbing p*nis in one hand with a look of dissatisfaction, biting the inside of his cheek.</p>
<p>“Am I being outdone by your ex-husband right now?” The flushed glans peeked out between his fingers. He rubbed the red, swollen tip with his thumb and stroked the shaft a couple of times.</p>
<p>The slippery pre-ej*culate acted as a lubricant, glistening on his skin.</p>
<p>Seoryeong couldn’t take her eyes off his pillar. The way it curved upward was strange.</p>
<p>Even if she had limited experience and hadn’t seen well before, she believed her husband’s pen*s were unique… until now.</p>
<p>She had thought Lee Wooshin’s was curved from the first time she met him, but she had avoided looking closely because of the tattoo. To think it was actually such an impressive specimen!</p>
<p>“You said before that I could look at it with the light on and a magnifying glass!”</p>
<p>“I know, but for you to actually…!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, veins bulging, suddenly clenched his teeth as if his pride had taken a hit. His chest heaved roughly. Even then, precum dripped from the glans, standing proudly upright.</p>
<p>Seoryeong wasn’t sure if he would back down, leaving her with a sense of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Instead, Lee Wooshin, with a fierce gaze, grasped her breast and pressed it with his thumb. He captured the nipple that had popped out again.</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>A rush of heat overwhelmed her, causing her hips to jerk upward involuntarily. Ignoring her protests once again, he positioned himself between her legs. Spreading her slick, loosened entrance, he looked as though he might plunge in at any moment.</p>
<p>The hard tip of his glans rubbed against her vulva, then pressed deeply into the swollen, sensitive peak.</p>
<p>“Ah, ugh…!”</p>
<p>Her mouth fell open as if she’d been struck by a jolt of electricity.</p>
<p>“In this situation, do you really think I’m the one who should back down?”</p>
<p>The erect shaft dripping fluid, and his ferocious gaze, both mirrored the same untamed intensity.</p>
<p>“You don’t see anyone else here, desperate to fuck you, do you?”</p>
<p>“Ahh…!”</p>
<p>Grabbing his glans, Lee Wooshin spread her labia wide and began to press inside. Sticky, wet sounds echoed as their slippery flesh slid and ground together. Her entrance seemed to flex and twitch, as if yearning for full penetration.</p>
<p>“Do you really think I should parade this throbbing cock all the way back to the living room? Answer me.”</p>
<p>His gaze was alien, like looking into the icy blue eyes of a wild beast standing on a snowy plain. She felt the dizziness of intoxication surge back but quickly shook her head to regain clarity.</p>
<p>“Ugh… I just wanted to look at it closely before you put it in…!”</p>
<p>“You’ve never seen it before, so what difference does it make if you inspect it now with a magnifying glass?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Just let me put it in.”</p>
<p>He continued pressing his hot glans against her mound, applying steady pressure. If he moved even slightly downward, it felt like he’d slip inside effortlessly.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin continued pressing around her swollen, puffed-up labia, smearing her dripping arousal onto the tip of his glans as if spreading it like ointment. The lewd sensation left her breath hitching in her throat.</p>
<p>“You’ll know everything just by watching me shove it in and move, won’t you?”</p>
<p>His hand, which had been caressing her back, slid down to grip the flesh of her buttocks.</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>She had no real argument against his logic, but her heart still raced. It wasn’t rational—it was pure instinct—but she couldn’t shake the thought that she had to confirm it for herself.</p>
<p>At the same time, she knew she was being unreasonable. Seoryeong shut her mouth, realizing she probably couldn’t convince him otherwise.</p>
<p>It was just as Wooshin pushed her buttocks slightly apart and aligned his glans with her entrance.</p>
<p>When Seoryeong squeezed her eyes shut, the world fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>“――.”</p>
<p>He was biting down on her flat stomach, nibbling and gnawing as he exhaled heavily. It sounded less like a sigh and more like a groan of frustration. His back curved as he hunched forward, his eyes glinting upward.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his hand reached out to gently wipe the moisture gathering at the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>“…Fine. Damn it, fine. Sergeant Han Seoryeong, you’ll handle the insertion yourself.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Climb on top of me and put it in yourself.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong blinked, frowning slightly at his unexpected suggestion.</p>
<p>“I… I’ve never done it that way before. Not even once.”</p>
<p>“That’s why,” His words trailing off as he got out of bed.</p>
