            <p><strong>Chapter 77.2</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong replied coldly.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve been in a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea how precious and heavy that one moment you ruined was for me? I had devoted my entire life to create that one chance.” She told him.</p>
<p>His gaze, which had previously avoided her, now locked onto her with sharp intensity.</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to make it up to me, but if you have any conscience at all, don’t fire me from the Special Security Team no matter what I do from now on.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s expression hardened as he sensed something serious in her words.</p>
<p>“If I want to recreate the opportunity I lost today, I’ll have to do something even more dangerous.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Every time I fail, I’ll have to take on something even riskier than before. That’s the cliff I’m hanging from.” Her calm voice carried a trace of desperation.</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to save my life like before. If you have any ounce of sympathy, just don’t stand in the way of what I need to do.”</p>
<p>Only then did Lee Wooshin’s expression change, as if he finally understood. He let out a crooked laugh, then turned serious, alternating between a cold laugh and a stern look as he ran a hand over his face.</p>
<p>“So that’s why you joined Blast Agency.” He muttered to himself as if finally piecing together the puzzle in his mind.</p>
<p>“You endured the military training, clung to the Special Security Team.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“To learn how to commit bad deeds, huh? Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer, only staring back at him.</p>
<p>“And now, just like today, you’re trying to reel in the National Intelligence Service, all because of that black agent husband of yours, who never shows up in front of you. You took on the national intelligence agency with no fear, just to catch him.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“And now you want me to keep my mouth shut and become your accomplice.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin clenched and unclenched his fists, glancing down at the messy kitchen floor as he took a deep breath. Then, through his tightly closed lips, a cold voice escaped.</p>
<p>“But Agent Han Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong stiffened her trembling eyelashes, trying with all her might to keep calm.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I can’t grant that request.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You’re smart enough to know that you’re making an absurd request. If we’re going to do this, the deal has to be split evenly.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Look at the situation properly.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin leaned against the dining table with a stance that made him look every bit the instructor.</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong, as soon as you connected the call, your objective was gone, but the NIS kept poking at your psychological weaknesses to manipulate your actions. The power balance was already decided at that point.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s eyes wavered.</p>
<p>“And from what I’ve heard, we’re talking about offshore accounts. That’s not something you could’ve managed alone. You must have had a skilled technician involved. The likeliest candidates are He Channa or Jeong Pilgyu, the information team leader.”</p>
<p>Unconsciously, she averted her gaze, and Lee Wooshin nodded, as if confirming his suspicions.</p>
<p>“If thugs stormed your house, then you must’ve caused quite a stir. But even after taking the initiative to strike first, why did you only get your husband’s voice? Why did you hold back in the end?”</p>
<p>His words made her flinch. Lee Wooshin’s expression grew colder.</p>
<p>For some reason, Seoryeong felt like she had been transported back to the training camp, her mind becoming hazy. I thought I had control.</p>
<p>“It’s because I couldn’t get in touch with Channa. I was afraid she might’ve been seriously injured, like last time.”</p>
<p>“He Channa didn’t get a scratch.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“On the way here, I got a text saying that the Blast Agency’s communication network was briefly down. Who do you think did that?”</p>
<p>She bit her lower lip. He Channa probably didn’t know what happened to her at all.</p>
<p>“Do you see now? It wasn’t me who messed up this situation. From the very start, you, Agent Han Seoryeong, walked right into it. From psychology to strategy, even down to those cheap tricks, you lost on all fronts.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You should’ve properly abandoned He Channa back then.”</p>
<p>A wave of humiliation hit her, but regret could wait. An overwhelming sense of urgency swept over Seoryeong as she realized she couldn’t convince him. Just as she started biting her lip again, Lee Wooshin lightly tapped her forehead, almost scolding her.</p>
<p>“Fine, I’ll be your accomplice.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I’ll go along with it, but you have to accept my conditions.”</p>
<p>“What? What are they?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin casually glanced around her house as if seeing it for the first time. Nervously, Seoryeong tugged at her clothes and swallowed hard.</p>
<p>For a moment, he seemed to scrutinize every corner of the room, almost like a contractor assessing it for renovation. Finally, his gaze settled on an empty picture frame.</p>
<p>Seoryeong wiped her sweaty palms on her clothes. What would she say if he asked about that?</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin couldn’t seem to take his eyes off that spot. He already thought of her as a fool. If she told him the empty frame used to hold a wedding photo. Would he make her do push-ups right here in the house?</p>
<p>She silently prayed he wouldn’t ask. Thankfully, Lee Wooshin didn’t say anything about it, but instead―</p>
<p>“I’ll have to move into this house.”</p>
<p>Her mind went completely blank.</p>
