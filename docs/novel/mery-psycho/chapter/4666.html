            <p><strong>Chapter 115.2</strong></p>
<p>At Kia’s sneering reply, Lee Wooshin gave a curt nod. He immediately grabbed a pillow, pressed it against Kia’s forearm, and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>“Argh…!”</p>
<p>The pillow burst with a circular bullet hole, releasing tufts of stuffing. At the same time, Kia’s knife slashed across Lee Wooshin’s earlobe.</p>
<p>“Damn it!” Lee Wooshin gritted his teeth, but his cold, focused eyes remained locked on Kia.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>A chilling thought crossed his mind—<em>that tongue had been on Seoryeong.</em></p>
<p>His expression grew even icier. Without hesitation, he smashed his fist into Kia’s jaw as if wielding a hammer, forcing the gun barrel between his teeth.</p>
<p>Blood seeped between Kia’s teeth, staining them red. Seeing the sight, Lee Wooshin’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p>
<p>“Guh, ack…!” Kia coughed violently, and Lee Wooshin loosened the gun just enough for him to breathe.</p>
<p>“Then tear off that bastard’s face! The man who looks like Sonya’s husband!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I’ll consider that payment enough.”</p>
<p>The NIS made Kim Hyun to be inspired by Agent Jin Hojae’s face and body. Kia didn’t like that.</p>
<p>Kia dragged his blood-streaked teeth across his lips, smirking as if savoring jam. Lee Wooshin pressed the priest down harder and reloaded the gun. This time, he aimed at Kia’s abdomen, pushing the pillow against it.</p>
<p>Kia smirked even as he spoke, “Maxim Solzhenitsyn… what the prime minister did with the Sakhalin children, what they used Winter Fortress for—”</p>
<p>The gun barrel trembled ever so slightly.</p>
<p>“If you bring me that agent’s face, I’ll behave.”</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>The next day, the agents began preparing to escort the children.</p>
<p>They secured holsters with pistols tightly at their sides, concealing them under clerical robes. Until it was time to move, they kept a watchful eye on the children, taking turns for meals.</p>
<p>The agents silently paced the basement. There wasn’t much to do—no need for brute force or much action.</p>
<p>Last night, just before falling asleep, Seoryeong had replayed Lee Wooshin’s expression in her mind. <em>Was it after seeing the children? </em>He suddenly looked pale.</p>
<p>After tossing and turning for a while, she’d sought out his room in the early hours but returned empty-handed. Fortunately, she’d slept deeply afterward.</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way, did you hear that last night?”</p>
<p>Jin Hojae broke the silence, speaking in a low tone.</p>
<p>“Last night, it was so noisy that I went to patrol the hallway.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But, after listening closely… ha. It wasn’t anything serious. It was the sound of desks creaking, beds squeaking… What the hell were they doing? The noise moved all around the rooms. I don’t know which floor it was, but these cult bastards—purity, my ass. I bet they’re all sneaking around for secret rendezvous every night, cheating on their partners!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s gaze stopped on Lee Wooshin, slumped in a chair. He wasn’t lying down or sitting upright, just sprawled out in an unbothered position. Whatever unease had flickered across his face in the basement last night had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes, and the wound beneath them became more noticeable. A thin, red gash traced across his skin—a clear sign of someone’s handiwork.</p>
<p>The agents fussed over Lee Wooshin’s injury that morning, but he brushed off their noisy concern with a cold indifference.</p>
<p>It was so close to his eye—just a little higher, and it would’ve been disastrous. Seoryeong felt a chill creep over her face as she approached him. Leaning closer, she whispered into his ear.</p>
<p>“Instructor, who chewed you up like this?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>When she lightly touched the gauze on his ear, he let out a soft laugh.</p>
<p>“If someone did, what would you do about it?”</p>
<p>The way he tapped his foot, almost daring her, left her feeling stifled, annoyed even.</p>
<p>Seoryeong closed her mouth, taking a deep breath to calm herself. His face was scratched—<em>what about the rest of his body? Was he injured elsewhere? </em>Her gaze lingered on him, as if trying to see through his clothes.</p>
<p>“Why are you staring at me like that?”</p>
<p>“I want to take a closer look.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>He ran his fingers over his furrowed brow, blinking slowly.</p>
<p>“The room they said had creaking noises last night… That was your room, wasn’t it, Instructor?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You thought I wouldn’t notice?”</p>
<p>He let out a bitter laugh, muttering to himself, <em>Who does she think she’s accusing?</em></p>
<p>Irritated, he ran a hand through his hair, sighing as he massaged the back of his neck. The movement made his prominent Adam’s apple shift slowly.</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong, I had a nightmare last night. There was a snake—completely straight, not even coiled.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“And then it slithered into a place it shouldn’t have.”</p>
<p>“So, you got bitten?”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t—ugh, never mind.”</p>
<p>His brows furrowed deeply as if he was frustrated with his own thoughts.</p>
<p>“Anyway, once this mission is over… wouldn’t it be nice to go somewhere far away?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Let’s leave this place, together.”</p>
<p>His cold gaze pierced her, devoid of warmth.</p>
