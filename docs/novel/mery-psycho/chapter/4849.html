            <p><strong>Chapter 21.1</strong></p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Without a chance to dodge, second and third eggs flew in. Instinctively, she raised her arms in a cross and lowered her face. Yellow and transparent liquid dripped along with the shattered shells. They were raw eggs.</p>
<p>However, trying to escape the spot, her clothes got soaked as eggs came flying from all directions. Was she considered an executive by the factory headquarters? Vulgar curses accompanied.</p>
<p>“Is it marijuana?” Lee Wooshin asked persistently.</p>
<p>“Is that important right now…!”</p>
<p>Although she shouted, Lee Wooshin clenched his fist, staring quietly at her, whether the eggs were flying or not.</p>
<p>Eggs falling on the floor burst like small bombs.</p>
<p>“It’s important. We can’t put a hallucinator on the business trip list.”</p>
<p>“I don’t use marijuana!”</p>
<p>“But you surely act like it.” He teased amidst the ruckus.</p>
<p>“Let’s get out of here quickly…!”</p>
<p>“If it’s not marijuana, what smell could make people go crazy?”</p>
<p>“Damn it, it’s my husband’s smell! Where are the car keys!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong reluctantly vomited something to the ground.</p>
<p>It seemed she was the only desperate one here.</p>
<p><em>Thunk, thunk</em>, eggs thrown at him weren’t easy either, but Lee Wooshin, with a face that seemed to have been hit by something bigger, stood motionless.</p>
<p>Oh, this guy is something…! Eventually, as if escaping alone, when Seoryeong moved forward, Lee Wooshin grabbed her elbow.</p>
<p>“What…!”</p>
<p>A large hand as if to strike her cheek came down sharply. What…! Though feathers fluttered, Seoryeong stared only at his spine without blinking.</p>
<p><em>If you hit me, I’ll hit you too.</em></p>
<p>In a moment of determination, a soft and solid hand stopped near her abdomen.</p>
<p><em>Squish</em>—something broke. The vivid sound sent shivers from her ears to her throat.</p>
<p>All of this happened in an instant. He caught the egg flying towards Seoryeong’s head and shattered it. Sticky liquid dripped from his fist.</p>
<p>“Strange.”</p>
<p>As she was frozen, Lee Wooshin casually wiped his damp hand on Seoryeong’s clothes, muttering like a monologue. It was a natural attitude with no trace of shame.</p>
<p>“Just because of the smell, is it normal to follow a strange man? Even if you say it’s because of m–of that man.”</p>
<p>He brought his nose close to his finger, where transparent goo clung, and wrinkled it. The distinct foul smell of raw egg wafted over here. He chuckled softly.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it just a cheap, shitty smell?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“How can we entrust our soldiers’ underwear to such a pervert in the future?”</p>
<p>He said with a cold face. Despite the still melodic voice, his gaze was so icy that she couldn’t speak. Seoryeong faced that gaze.</p>
<p>“Not a man, my husband.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Men may be numerous, but my husband is the only one in the world. And he’s not a pervert, not displaying peculiar behavior, nor emitting any unpleasant smell. It doesn’t even affect his work.”</p>
<p>She defended herself, eyeing the opportunity. There was an intention behind her willingness to accompany him on a business trip—no disqualification reasons.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lee Wooshin only wore a forced smile, staring fixedly at Seoryeong. His gaze was complex, annoying, and seemed to convey indifference.</p>
<p>“…My husband.” He snorted, mocking her words.</p>
<p>“Right, it would indeed be better if Han Seoryeong wasn’t here.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. Was that an approval for her to accompany him on business trips?</p>
<p>He irritably scratched the end of his eyebrow and quickly moved towards the back door. Now, his broad back, covered in egg stains, looked messy.</p>
<p>Until he returned to the office, he didn’t utter a word.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Thailand?”</p>
<p>The call from the sub-manager came the next morning.</p>
<p>She widened her eyes as she handed over the needed files. Yes, here… medical, driving, and cooking certificates.</p>
<p>“Ms. Han Seoryeong will be moving together as rear support. Study this properly and get ready. The back pages contain a confidentiality agreement; sign it quickly…”</p>
<p>The sub-manager, scratching behind his ear, seemed somehow unpleasant.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry since you won’t go out to the field… Just support from behind. There will be a medic going, so medications will probably be procured locally. Meet the staff at the airport first before departure. The team members will leave on a different flight.”</p>
<p>“What will those team members do in Thailand?”</p>
<p><em>At this point, she asked the most curious question. What exactly did the Special Security Team do?</em></p>
<p>At that, the sub-manager abruptly turned his chair, seemingly annoyed. He stared only at the computer monitor, typing forcefully on the keyboard.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details. You’ll probably receive a travel allowance, but is your account still the same?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Since there won’t be any separate personnel to guard the employees, you’ll have to take care of yourselves… And even if something happens, just pretend you didn’t see anything. If you spill food waste there, you might get shot if luck isn’t on your side.”</p>
<p>With a sudden click of his tongue, he hastily tidied up his desk. “You’d better just keep your eyes closed, Ms. Han Seoryeong,” he added, brushing off the dust from his hands.</p>
