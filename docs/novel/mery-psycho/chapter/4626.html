            <p><strong>Chapter 135.2</strong></p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment, then moved forward again, as if dragging heavy chains.</p>
<p>“It was my first marriage.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But after we got married, I never once got to say that to you. I was always sorry for no reason, always ashamed, and sometimes embarrassed. I was too busy hiding my real self.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But, you know… every single day, I was happy.”</p>
<p>Her nose tingled, but she spoke with determination.</p>
<p>“You were the first family I ever had.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Our marriage ended like this, but I’m still glad that the first family I had was someone kind and gentle like you. No matter how much time passes, even if I grow old and become a grandmother, I will never forget that.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong forced down the tremble in her lips. She had thought she would pull a gun on him the moment she found him.</p>
<p>But she realized what she truly wanted was to say the goodbye she never got to.</p>
<p>“Thank you for letting me live as an ordinary woman.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>His Adam’s apple bobbed roughly. Seoryeong quickly wiped the corner of her eye and gave him a faint smile.</p>
<p>“I’ve been wanting to say this, but you disappeared without even saying goodbye. Not being able to tell you this haunted me. That’s why I did everything just to see you one last time. I…”</p>
<p>Memories of everything she had done to get here flashed through her mind like a passing lantern. Seoryeong swallowed back the rising emotions once more. It felt as though red waves were swelling behind her eyes.</p>
<p>“I came all the way here for this.”</p>
<p>She tilted her head back, wearing the expression of someone who had finally reached the finish line. The night stretched before her, as black as someone’s long hair. Letting go of the past lifted the weight off her shoulders.</p>
<p>All the emotions she had been holding back surged, swelled, then cooled and burned away in cycles. The shifting weight of it all left Seoryeong feeling drained.</p>
<p>As she staggered, Kim Hyun suddenly strode forward and grabbed her wrist. Hiding the turmoil within her, she asked,</p>
<p>“Was it hard living with me? For you, marriage was just another job, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Without a word, he snapped a handcuff around one of her wrists.</p>
<p>“From this moment on, Han Seoryeong, you will be extradited for interrogation under charges of violating international maritime law and the National Security Act.”</p>
<p>His palm felt colder than the metal pressing against her skin.</p>
<p>“And—”</p>
<p>Kim Hyun firmly rubbed the blood-caked back of her hand.</p>
<p>“Besides your hands.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Are you hurt anywhere else?”</p>
<p>“Are you still acting right now?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong furrowed her brows without realizing it.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to pretend to be my husband. You don’t have to act like you’re on duty.”</p>
<p>For a fleeting moment, his expression looked as though something sharp had pierced through him.</p>
<p>In that brief moment, Seoryeong erased the last speck of lingering emotions. Without hesitation, she snapped the other cuff onto his wrist and lunged.</p>
<p>Locking her legs around his waist, she drew a knife and slashed deep into his cheek.</p>
<p>It happened in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Like a beast, she sank her teeth into his face and refused to let go.</p>
<p>“―!”</p>
<p>He shoved her away, but his strength wasn’t as ruthless as it should have been. That only fueled her even more.</p>
<p>She latched onto him with renewed vigor, shaking her head wildly like a rabid dog that hadn’t eaten in days, determined to tear through his flesh.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s teeth crushed down on something soft yet firm, squishing and distorting it between her jaws. Whether it was real skin or just another mask, she didn’t care. But since he didn’t even let out a groan, it was probably fake after all.</p>
<p>Drooling through clenched teeth, she spat out her words.</p>
<p>“Who the h*ll are you?!”</p>
<p>“Han Seo—! You’re gonna break your teeth. Let go!”</p>
<p>Even as he tried to push her away, his hands still supported her waist.</p>
<p>Seoryeong clung to his head with all her might, pressing her weight down. The moment she finally ripped through the surface—</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>A sharp pain exploded near her veins. A cold liquid seeped into her bloodstream.</p>
<p>Through her blurred vision, she saw him, his face twisted in pain as he plunged a syringe into her neck.</p>
<p>Cursing instinctively, she struggled, but even with a torn cheek, Kim Hyun held her like a child, cradling her gently.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I won’t hurt you. It’s okay.”</p>
<p>That grotesque, wounded face murmured soothing words.</p>
<p>Seoryeong bit down on her tongue. No—she should’ve torn more of him apart…!</p>
<p>“N-no… You’re gonna… leave me again…”</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>“Liar”</p>
<p>“When you wake up, I’ll be right beside you this time.”</p>
<p>Her head slumped against his broad shoulder. The sensation against her fading consciousness felt just like her husband.</p>
<p>Bastard! Even till the end!</p>
<p>But his shoulders, they were even harder than Kim Hyun’s, more solid, more familiar…</p>
<p>Her mind was yanked into darkness.</p>
<p>Desperation set in. She weakly rattled her cuffed wrists.</p>
<p>At least the chain held firm.</p>
<p>Kim Hyun buried his face in the nape of her neck and let out a deep sigh. He held her tightly, as if he would never let go again. Just before she lost consciousness, she vaguely heard his murmured words.</p>
<p>“It was never hard living with you. Not even once.”</p>
<p>The warmth of his hand patting her back almost brought her to tears.</p>
