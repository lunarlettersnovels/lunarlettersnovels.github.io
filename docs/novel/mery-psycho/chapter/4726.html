            <p><strong>Chapter 84.2</strong></p>
<p>“Throw that on the ground,” Seoryeong said, pointing to the hair he was still holding. She then tapped his hand with her baton, but he suddenly closed the distance she’d just created. Bending down, he tilted his head closer.</p>
<p>His red tongue slowly licked up the side of Seoryeong’s cheek.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong immediately struck his neck and landed a hit on his abdomen, but the more she hit him, the more flushed his face became. His once-quiet eyes now gleamed with an inexplicable, shining intensity.</p>
<p>“Я люблю трахаться с такой женщиной, как ты.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>I love screwing women like you.</p>
<p>Seoryeong scowled at the sudden Russian.</p>
<p>Russian was a language she had to learn in high school after their coach announced that only a select few would be sent to Moscow for advanced training. While her classmates struggled with the unfamiliar language, Seoryeong quickly mastered the Cyrillic alphabet and found herself reading with ease.</p>
<p>The man lingered on Seoryeong’s black hair, her sharp, striking eyes, and the shin covered by her pants before finally turning his back.</p>
<p>Once he left, the bathroom fell into silence.</p>
<p>“Hah! Seriously, what a weirdo.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong wasn’t sure if she should chase after him or just let him go, but at that moment, a woman emerged from one of the stalls.</p>
<p>“Besides the MOU, there’s also a fundraising event for a relief organization at the other center. So, the place is crawling with priests.” The woman, fixing her disheveled hair in front of the mirror, continued.</p>
<p>“That guy, in particular, is from the Russian Orthodox Church. It’s probably best not to mess with him. Honestly, he was just some guy slacking off with me. Except for his weird tastes, there was nothing that strange about him.”</p>
<p>Even though he had committed lewd acts in a public space, it wasn’t as though he posed a major threat to the event’s security. Still, something about it left Seoryeong feeling unsettled.</p>
<p>She walked briskly to the sink and splashed water on her face.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a matter of feeling dirty and disgusted. There was something more, something different. Her heart was uneasy, and for some reason, the man’s face, which she had only seen briefly, refused to leave her mind.</p>
<p>“He didn’t take his hand off my shin the entire time we were having sex. He didn’t lick or bite it; he just kept pressing on my shinbone. Doesn’t that seem weird to you?”</p>
<p>The woman in the mirror was a beauty with black hair and dark eyes. Standing beside her at the sink, Seryeong found that the woman’s large eyes oddly resembled her own.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Father, forgive this sinner. As I send his worthless life to You through pain, I ask You to soothe his despair and fear. Let him know Your kindness through me.”</p>
<p>A young priest, dressed in a cassock, murmured in a low voice as he tightly held onto a pair of wrinkled hands. He clutched them so firmly that the skin had turned a bluish-black from lack of circulation.</p>
<p>The man lying in the bed, having taken zolpidem, had already lost consciousness and was sleeping deeply. The priest, with a cold detachment, wiped away a stray tear with his fingertip.</p>
<p>At last, he unclasped the cross hanging from his neck, revealing a sharp needle hidden inside.</p>
<p>“Father! Today I saw another woman who looked like Sonya.”</p>
<p>As he injected an overdose of potassium chloride into the man’s neck, he continued.</p>
<p>“My pair, the one who disappeared. My pair, Father!”</p>
<p>As the syringe emptied quickly, the middle-aged man’s eyes shot open, and he began choking, gasping for breath. The young priest watched the fear fill his eyes and spoke to him sorrowfully.</p>
<p>“She vanished one day without a trace, left me behind, all alone. Disappeared like it was nothing. She was all I had. Sonya was the only one for me.”</p>
<p>As he pressed the plunger deeper, the man’s veins bulged, and the weak choking noises finally faded away. His pupils slowly became fixed, but the priest’s fervent prayer didn’t stop.</p>
<p>“Damn it, Father, I’m going to find her.”</p>
<p>Tears filled the young priest’s eyes as he reattached the cross and kissed it longingly.</p>
<p>“No matter what, I’ll find her, even if I have to search the entire world.”</p>
<p>Reflected in the hotel window, which framed the glittering night view, were the bodies of several security guards who had already been killed.</p>
<p>With his task complete, the priest stood up silently. He lowered his gaze, recalling the strand of hair he had pulled out earlier in the day.</p>
<p><em>Please, this time.</em></p>
<p>It was a night steeped in sin.</p>
