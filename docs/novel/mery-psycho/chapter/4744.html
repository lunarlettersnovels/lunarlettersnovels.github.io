            <p><strong>Chapter 75.1</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong swallowed dryly and glared at the dark screen. The moment the National Intelligence Service agreed to the deal, she had seated the restrained men at the dining table and began waiting for Kim Hyun’s call.</p>
<p>She had already agreed to pass on the account numbers one by one during the call, fearing that revealing the casino account too hastily might cause the conversation to be cut short.</p>
<p>While waiting for the call, she rinsed her mouth and wiped off the blood. She also tried to contact Channa, but couldn’t get through. The same went for Jeong Pilgyu. Anxiety gnawed at her, and she unconsciously bit her fingernails.</p>
<p>She realized that she could no longer put Channa in the forefront. What she needed now was someone who, even if caught by a weakness, would not be a source of concern. Someone who wouldn’t be fazed by physical violence or threats—an expert in these matters.</p>
<p>Yes, someone like the Instructor…</p>
<p>Ring, ring.</p>
<p>At that moment, the old smartphone placed on the dining table began to ring.</p>
<p>『Caller ID restricted』</p>
<p>She flinched, feeling tense despite herself. Her heart pounded wildly in her chest, as if trying to break free.</p>
<p>Her fingers trembled slightly as she picked up the phone.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>The night her husband didn’t return home. That night when everything began, she had clung to the phone just like this. It felt as if the unanswered calls from back then had stretched across those horrific months and led up to this moment.</p>
<p>There were so many things she wanted to ask and say—too many.</p>
<p>―Seoryeong.</p>
<p>Ah! The words of reproach she had prepared stopped in her throat. The familiar husky voice scratched at her eardrums, tinged with a tenderness that made it unmistakably Kim Hyun. It was the voice of her husband.</p>
<p>―It’s been a while.</p>
<p>The moment she heard those three words, her throat tightened.</p>
<p>―Are you hurt anywhere?</p>
<p>She should have responded, but her tongue felt frozen, refusing to move.</p>
<p>After disappearing without a trace, this was all he had to say. This shameless, heartless bastard. Unforgivable anger surged within her.</p>
<p>And yet, she couldn’t bring herself to lash out. She simply closed her eyes tightly. Her throat felt choked with emotion.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes like this, it almost felt like she had gone back in time. Back to when she was absurdly happy.</p>
<p>It seemed like she was the only one who had changed. Kim Hyun’s soft voice and gentle demeanor remained completely intact, exactly as she remembered.</p>
<p>―Seoryeong, why did you do it?</p>
<p>The familiar, gentle voice flowed out again.</p>
<p>―I heard you tried to defect to the North and emptied accounts. What’s going on?</p>
<p>“…Then why did you do it to me, Hyun?”</p>
<p>―….</p>
<p>“In that situation, what else was I supposed to do? You were the one who left me first. You left me behind, left me in this house, and disappeared. I’m still here.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong wiped away her silent tears, her expression dry. She bit her lip as she wrote down the foreign bank account numbers on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Her hand trembled so badly that the numbers twisted like worms. The men stared at the paper intensely, not blinking.</p>
<p>―You already know I’m a black agent for the National Intelligence Service, right?</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>―Then you understand my situation.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>―I can’t meet you again, Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>―Sorry, but we must never meet again. I can’t do that.</p>
<p>His tone was gentle, but the message hit harder than any punch from the intruders. The weight of Kim Hyun’s rejection slammed into her head with more force than her bruised face.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous.” Seoryeong’s lips quivered as she shot back.</p>
<p>“Show up in front of me right now. If you don’t, I don’t know what I’ll do.”</p>
<p>―Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“A simple phone call isn’t going to cut it. I want everything or nothing.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong glared at the agents in front of her, as if searching for someone to take her anger out on.</p>
<p>“Who are you loyal to, anyway? This country? Or your boss? Whatever it is, if you don’t come to me, I’ll destroy it all.”</p>
<p>―…</p>
<p>“Everything you’ve spent years protecting and cherishing, I’ll ruin it.”</p>
<p>She knew she shouldn’t act like this. She wanted to show him only her kind, gentle side. But the words that came out sounded like those of a child throwing a tantrum over something they couldn’t have. She felt small and pathetic, revealing her raw emotions like this.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t help it. She wanted so desperately to reconnect their broken bond. Whether they lived or died, killed or saved each other, she needed to feel that warmth again to fill the gaping hole in her heart.</p>
<p>As her thirst and hatred consumed her, she heard his voice again.</p>
<p>―Then you’ll need to listen to me carefully, Seoryeong.</p>
<p>Kim Hyun sighed as he spoke.</p>
<p>―That’s the only way I can come back to you.</p>
