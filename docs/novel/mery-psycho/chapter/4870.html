            <p><strong>Chapter 7.1</strong></p>
<p>“No, how could you talk so filthy…!”</p>
<p>Even though he couldn’t see it, he knew Lee Wooshin’s red lips stretching out long.</p>
<p>― Take a moment to close your eyes and think. If I were to become a target of another foreign intelligence agency, I would return immediately and kill you and the deputy director first.</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>Wonchang was so surprised that he even jumped up to his feet.</p>
<p>― Are there only two people in the organization who know my face? You and the deputy director. The fewer people who know my information, the better. It’s easier to handle all at once.”</p>
<p>That’s… isn’t that not the right thing to say at this moment? Wonchang swallowed hard.</p>
<p>― So, let’s walk for about ten minutes a day. It’s easier to kill a lively twenty-year-old than a deputy director in his fifties.</p>
<p>“Ugh….”</p>
<p>― Now, shall we check if you understood the main point? I don’t trust superiors or colleagues. But do you still want to work with me? Think about it carefully and make the offer again.</p>
<p>“Uh… Team leader… Then, have a long and comfotrable trip.”</p>
<p>―Sure.</p>
<p>His rich, low laughter filled with a sense of amusement echoed.</p>
<p>―Keep quiet so I won’t come looking for you. Don’t seek me out either.</p>
<p>Despite the light tone, unlike the casual manner, Wonchang felt a chill down his spine.</p>
<p>He was the kind of man who, while pretending to be a kind man, would gently smile at a woman, undress her, and then inject a syringe into her heart like a traitor. The black agents were indeed black agents; upon closer inspection, they were individuals licensed by the country to commit murder.</p>
<p>“Oh, one more thing…!”</p>
<p>―Why is your tongue so long after it’s all over?</p>
<p>Look at this, he quickly sharpened and became edgy.</p>
<p>The pale gray iris under the black lens would be like a blade at times like this.</p>
<p>He had never actually seen those eyes. No, had anyone really seen them?</p>
<p>Wonchang quickly changed the subject, erasing the irrelevant thoughts.</p>
<p>“It seems like the <em>owl </em>really loved the team leader.”</p>
<p>―…</p>
<p>Hearing this code name, Wooshin became speechless.</p>
<p>The code name “owl” referred to Han Seoryeong.</p>
<p>“Actually, there was a commotion here at the police station about a month ago. The owl came back covered in blood and said it was her husband’s blood. When she reported the disappearance, the on-duty Southern police naturally turned everything upside down. So the search was faster than expected. If it had been a little late, traces would have been left. Is this luck or…”</p>
<p>―…Blood?</p>
<p>A rough voice interjected at that moment.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>―What blood?</p>
<p>“I checked, and it was just her own blood. But on the CCTV at the police station, it looked like her face was covered in blood. The police were shocked when they saw that.”</p>
<p>―…….</p>
<p>There was not a single breath heard from him, who was full of nerves. “the owl” was the code name meaning “hanSeoryeong.”</p>
<p>“Actually, a month ago, there was chaos here at the police station. the owl came back covered in blood and said it was her husband’s blood. She filed a missing person report, and the duty officers at the time naturally turned everything upside down. So, the search happened faster than expected. If it had been even a little later, there might have been traces left. Is it luck, or…”</p>
<p>“…Blood?”</p>
<p>A rough voice interjected.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“What blood?”</p>
<p>“When we checked, it turned out to be her own blood. But on the police station CCTV, even her face was covered in blood. The police were shocked when they saw that.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Team leader? Are you listening?”</p>
<p>– Continue.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes…! So, because the missing person report was processed faster than expected, the fake identity was exposed quickly. I thought it would take at least two days. By the way, I was surprised at how the owl came up with such an idea.”</p>
<p>-“…”</p>
<p>“We have the footage; would you like to see it?”</p>
<p>Then, silence followed. As the silence extended, Wonchang instinctively realized that he might have said something inappropriate.</p>
<p>“Te-Team leader?” he called out pitifully, but there was no response. Only a vague rustling sound was heard. Sweating palms began to form.</p>
<p>-Tell me in three seconds why I should watch that video.</p>
<p>In the surprisingly cold voice that made him startled, Wonchang stammered, “Uh… well, you see…” before scratching the back of his head, feeling the weight of facing his now chilly superior. Meanwhile, as he counted backward from three, Wooshin suddenly burst into laughter. The playful tone in his voice was unmistakably there.</p>
<p>– What kind of crazy bastard is looking through all the finished and discarded documents? From the moment the withdrawal order was issued, the owl entered the shredder. Do you know?</p>
<p>“I’m sorry!!”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>“I understand!”</p>
<p>It seemed like he had given himself away. It felt humiliating… Wonchang lowered his head even more.</p>
<p>But as a person who had been observed for a long time, he had learned that it was natural for a target to develop human emotions. He had grasped this well during his training, and it was a boundary he had been aware of.</p>
<p>But now, I’ve fallen into that trap…! A belated realization struck Wonchang. For some reason, his back felt hot.</p>
<p>“Do you think what I did was actually a marriage, Na Wonchang?”</p>
