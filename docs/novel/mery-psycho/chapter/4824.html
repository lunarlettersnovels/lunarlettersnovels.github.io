            <p><strong>Chapter 34.2</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong pursed her lips in silence.</p>
<p>“How are you going to handle the training when even men have a hard time? You’re not strong, you don’t work in this field, and with that body?”</p>
<p>He pointed at the people going on the bus.”</p>
<p>“Not even a quarter of those people stays.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“It’s good that you have passion, but why don’t you realize that passion becomes stupidity</p>
<p>with one step?”</p>
<p>He looked very annoyed.</p>
<p>“I told you let’s not meet again, and that I don’t feel like I need to hire you. Don’t you have any pride? You also make me say things twice, which is more of a reason to cut you.”</p>
<p>“In the end, this is a camp where I get my team.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin was telling her straight up that he’ll cut her out of his own personal reason. But</p>
<p>Seoryeong wasn’t backing down. She wasn’t shaken by his words.</p>
<p>“Yes, do your best to cut me. In the camp, not here.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin looked at her.</p>
<p>“I already know that’ it’ll be tough and I thought about it plenty. But I still came to try. I’ll do whatever can. So why are you the one judging the weight I’ll be carrying?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>|“Even all of that is mine.</p>
<p>It was Wooshin who raised his eyebrows, only to have his brows knit together. He let out an irritated sigh and placed his hands on his waist, his gaze darkening for some reason.</p>
<p>“Why do you have to push yourself so hard to stay in this company?”</p>
<p>They definitely had a similar conversation in Thailand. His question on why she was still there. The way he looked at her like he didn’t understand.</p>
<p>He really didn’t seem like want to see Seoryeong. So even if she tried to talk around it, Lee Wooshin wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>“I need special security team.”</p>
<p>His eyes widened at such unexpected answer.</p>
<p>“Is it perhaps something to do with that person who ran with your money?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m going to catch him. He’s my husband.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin looked at such unexpected confession. Seoryeong also looked that way but</p>
<p>there was nothing there.</p>
<p>“So I don’t care what you say, it’s not reaching me. How are you going to stop me, a woman who’s trying to catch her husband even through all this?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin rubbed his face and stepped back. It wasn’t likely but it looked like he was going to be dizzy.</p>
<p>“So my pride isn’t hurt. It wouldn’t unless it was my husband. So now you realize, please treat me the same as everyone else and then kick me off.”</p>
<p>The man clenched his chin and then asked.</p>
<p>“Is this out of revenge or madness?”</p>
<p>“All of it.”</p>
<p>She could honestly put every emotion in the world. It was regret, resentment, love, and murderous. So she answered instantly.</p>
<p>It was like that if it was about Kim Hyun. It was cheerful and simple. She was the only that took everything from her, good and bad.</p>
<p>“So should I tell you my truth too?” The man told her kindly.</p>
<p>The man who had tugged him back to his feet suddenly spoke in a friendly tone.</p>
<p>“There are some things you learn when you roll in the field. For example-”</p>
<p>A hard muscle bulged over his chiselled jaw, and he stared into Seoryeong’s eyes, his gaze icy cold.</p>
<p>“Or that love is a form of psychological manipulation.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>The arm that held him throbbed unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“It’s not that hard to do: make you feel like you’re not alone, approve of you, and only look at you. Just those three things.”</p>
<p>He folded his fingers in front of him. His eyes were colder than the cold.</p>
<p>“And if you make them feel loved, they’ll easily mistake it for love, even if you’ve only led them to believe it.”</p>
<p>There was a faint hint of a smile on Wooshin’s face as he cruelly overturned someone else’s situation.</p>
<p>At that moment, she felt her stomach turn, a strange knot forming in the pit of it.</p>
<p>“It’s not a special emotion, it’s just a product of manipulation, and that’s what I’ve been taught and conditioned to believe, that it’s just an after-effect, a side effect.”</p>
