            <p><strong>Chapter 31.1</strong></p>
<p>The corners of his mouth curled upward as if he were remembering someone. It was a thing… A hint of greed flickered in his wrinkled eyes.</p>
<p>“I haven’t been able to hire any girls because I haven’t had any good ones, and there’s plenty of use for female labor, even if it’s not necessarily for that job, but I’ve found someone quite amusing.”</p>
<p>Kang Taegon laughed contentedly as he stirred his ice-cold drink.</p>
<p>“Cold and calm… That’s right, she’s hard as ice.”</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed. Even after briefing her, he couldn’t fathom the woman.</p>
<p>He struggled to explain it, but she simply seemed tougher than most.</p>
<p>Despite the beatings she endured in her youth, something she never thought she’d face, she remained unbroken.</p>
<p>There was a toughness in Seoryeong’s eyes, something even seasoned soldiers lacked.</p>
<p>Taegon couldn’t help but laugh at the memory of her ridiculous expression.</p>
<p>It was a puzzle. Was it natural, or was it because she’d been through worse?</p>
<p>Yet, despite her strong personality, Seoryeong’s past was dull. Taegon wondered how she avoided trouble.</p>
<p>“If my judgment is still good, I won’t quit training halfway,” Taegon said, his voice serious.</p>
<p>“He needs a female bodyguard to serve him, not someone else,” the man emphasized, his gaze shifting from the panoramic city view to set his now-empty glass down with a clink on the desk’s surface.</p>
<p>“Anyone capable would do,” he added, nonchalantly patting the statue of an eagle clasping a cross between its beak.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll see you when you come to Korea. I guess we’ll just have to wait for her to come up here,” he concluded, directing his attention to the computer monitor where Han Seoryeong’s mugshot was prominently displayed.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The winter orchid, a gift from Mr. Kang, had blossomed of its own accord, its delicate petals unfurling without the touch of water or the swipe of a cloth to clean its leaves.</p>
<p>She had read the enclosed instructions just once before securely locking them away in a drawer, unsure if the opportunity presented was genuine or a cleverly disguised trap, unwilling to risk handling the pamphlet a second time.</p>
<p>Yet, the title she had highlighted in bold beckoned to her, igniting a flurry of conflicting emotions that set her heart pounding unnecessarily.</p>
<p>“Why is this happening…?” Seoryeong murmured, her fingertips pressing against her temple as if attempting to quell a sudden wave of dizziness.</p>
<p>From that moment onward, she found herself inexplicably drawn to the drawer, her gaze lingering on it for extended periods, lost in contemplation.</p>
<p>“Oh, were you looking at flowers again?” came the voice, interrupting her reverie.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>No, I was looking at the weird notice underneath…</p>
<p>“Why not step outside for a bit and get some fresh air and sunlight? It must be dreary being cooped up in a hospital. Hold on, let me grab you a coat and shawl!” The caring caregiver’s words were a swift tonic to Seoryeong’s mood.</p>
<p>With her arm encased in a cast and secured by a shoulder brace, Seoryeong ventured out. It was the first time she felt truly at ease since the days she strolled the streets of Thailand with Channa.</p>
<p>Yet, Channa remained unconscious, a heavy weight on Seoryeong’s heart. She hoped for a chance to visit her before departing.</p>
<p>The winter breeze nipped at one of her cheeks, but it was a sensation as cold as her aimless wanderings. Seoryeong had nowhere in particular to go; she simply followed the path her feet led her.</p>
<p>Never making trouble and watching days go by while she was working.</p>
<p>That was her routine until she crossed paths with Kim Hyun.</p>
<p>Soon, Seoryeong found herself seated at a bus stop, idly observing passersby. She absentmindedly unlocked her cell phone, greeted by an empty photo album.</p>
<p>Her thumb traced patterns on the blank screen, a futile gesture. In her mind’s eye, she pictured the absent man who should have been by her side…</p>
<p>“So, my brother’s friend replied to me yesterday…”</p>
<p>“Holy shit…”</p>
<p>“That’s not the end of it. Listen to the end. He’s been sending me more texts than ever before, and he’s been mixing them up with a lot of insinuations. You’re interested in me, right?”</p>
<p>Just then, a group of youngsters in school uniforms rushed by, giggling and slapping each other’s shoulders, sometimes seriously, sometimes lightly.</p>
<p>Seoryeong looked at them and stood up.</p>
<p>She knew where she wanted to go.</p>
