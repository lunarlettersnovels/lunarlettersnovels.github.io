        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 60.2</strong></p>
<p>– “Are you out of your mind?”</p>
<p>Beyond the phone, Lee Wooshin could hear the rough rolling of the chair wheels. Wonchang’s voice in his in-ear was extremely shaky.</p>
<p><em>What are you doing? Team leader, what the hell do you want me to do?!</em></p>
<p>“Didn’t you understand?”</p>
<p>– “Team leader!”</p>
<p>The team members, having received their second dose of recovery shots, were busy catching up on lost sleep. They slept for over thirty hours without eating, repeating a routine of attending classes and visiting the infirmary.</p>
<p>After a few days of this, the soldiers put on their military boots again and slowly walked around the barracks to warm up. On the rooftop, Lee Wooshin looked down at the barracks from the cold wind.</p>
<p>At first, they gasped for breath as if they would faint after just two kilometers, but now their form was steady.</p>
<p>By the time they finish the training, they’ll be strong enough to run 10 kilometers at full speed.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin immediately spotted Han Seoryeong among them, running alongside her teammate, chatting, occasionally smiling, and giving him a friendly slap on the shoulder. His eyes turned cold.</p>
<p>“Find a male corpse, 188 cm tall, 80 kg. It would be better if the lower body is unrecognizable due to a fall or something.”</p>
<p>– “…No, no, no, what I want to know is why you’re looking for a corpse and then suddenly looking for a Kim Hyun mask! What the hell are you going to do with the owl? I thought the operation was over?”</p>
<p>“I thought so, too. It’s supposed to be a complete withdrawal.”</p>
<p>– “Huh?”</p>
<p>“We were wrong, Wonchang.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin gently smiled while touching his cheek. His attempt to handle her as he used to was utterly futile. The woman who once blindly trusted his words was no longer there.</p>
<p>“The owl” could be controlled, but Han Seo-ryeong could not. The owl seemed fragile, but Han Seoryeong was a tenacious human who could endure hellish training.</p>
<p>She seemed fragile, but that was his wife, but Han Seoryeong was different. Therefore, the methods that worked on the owl were just futile measures when used on Han Seoryeong.</p>
<p>As a result, Lee Wooshin became a detestable superior who took out his post-divorce frustrations on a female team member, and his brow furrowed irritably every time he recalled that day.</p>
<p>“Instead of disappearing, let us make it look like Kim Hyun has died.”</p>
<p>….!</p>
<p>“If Kim Hyun had died in the first place, she wouldn’t have even thought of looking for him.”</p>
<p>Wonchang was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Then she wouldn’t have gotten into this business, she wouldn’t have struggled to make a living, and she wouldn’t be obsessed with men’s d.icks.”</p>
<p>A sinister voice leaked through the gap, and suddenly, it became quiet beyond the in-ear.</p>
<p>“So, just give me a bastard’s corpse.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, facing Han Soryeong, he wanted to tear at my own cheek. The strange and bizarre illusion that he might still be wearing the mask of ‘Kim Hyun’ made his head spin.</p>
<p>‘Kim Hyun’ was nothing more than an illusion. Yet, sometimes, it felt like the man who had been so devotedly sweet was still clinging to his skin like a blotchy paste.</p>
<p>But what clung to his flesh was no longer the happy moments, just a meaningless, filthy crust.</p>
<p>So, he had to sort it out properly again.</p>
<p>“Those two, Han Seoryeong and her husband, I’m going to tear them apart completely.”</p>
<p>– ”―!”</p>
<p>Not knowing exactly what CEO Kang Taegon’s intentions were, if I couldn’t get rid of her or control her, the method was simple. He just had to strip Han Soryeong of her motivation.</p>
<p><em>Husband? Screw that.</em> Lee Wooshin twitched his frozen cheek, watching her retreating figure with the eyes of a hunter.</p>
<p><em>Do you think you can find Kim Hyun by yourself? How do you plan to find him? I will never let myself be caught by you.</em> He thought determinedly. This chase has to end.</p>
<p>The man, who had been standing there for a while, soon turned around, exhaling cold breath.</p>
<p>“And recompile the owl data and send it to me.”</p>
<p>– “If it’s about the owl, you’ve got everything, team leader.”</p>
<p>“Not that.”</p>
<p>As he moved, he suddenly hit the rooftop alarm with his elbow. The alarm blared loudly through the drill ground.</p>
<p>The soldiers, who had been jogging lightly, were startled and panicked. Lee Wooshin watched the bodies that had been sticking together now spreading out wide and smiled crookedly.</p>
<p>“Not the one the deputy director gave, the one you personally reviewed from the birth report starting today.”</p>
<p>– What? Wait, sir, wait a moment. That’s against NIS regulations!</p>
<p>The panicked voice jumped out urgently. Na Wonchang also strictly adhered to the principle of work separation.</p>
<p>“Kim Hyun won’t pry into her private life, but I need to know her.”</p>
<p>By this point, however, Lee Wooshin had long since abandoned his wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>“I feel like shit every day, Wonchang, because I can’t get inside Han Seoryeong’s head.”</p>
