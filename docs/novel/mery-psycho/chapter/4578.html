            <p><b>Chapter 162.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wooshin hastily loosened his bowtie and yanked down her zipper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seoryeong had driven them to this hunting lodge warehouse in the old Jeep borrowed from the kind lady’s husband.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two clung to each other’s backs and heads, their lips crashing together mindlessly. Hot flesh pressed against tender inner membranes before sweeping up in slow, heated strokes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wooshin pried her parted lips wider, ravaging her mouth without restraint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in the darkness, their hands groped blindly. Frantic kisses collided haphazardly against cheeks, jaws, and the nape of her neck. Wooshin shrugged off his jacket without breaking contact for even a second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He sucked greedily at every inch of her, as if no amount could ever be enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where the h*ll even is this place?” He asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somewhere that’ll become our place for a long, long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But if we have s*x here carelessly, all kinds of mites-“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as Wooshin frowned and glanced around the pitch-black warehouse, Seoryeong struck a match and lit the scented candles she’d prepared in advance. A carefully arranged little space came into view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A soft quilted blanket was spread in a circle, with a cute picnic basket and cushions neatly arranged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He cut himself off mid-sentence and turned to stare at her, his widened eyes clearly surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ve never done it outside before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seoryeong pointed upward, as if to say look at that. Though only the skeletal beams of the roof remained now, the sky beyond stretched open like a spill of stars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Struck silent by the breathtaking sight, Wooshin quietly undid the rest of his shirt buttons. Still, unwilling to lay her directly on the floor, he sat down first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seoryeong tugged her straps down and climbed onto him. The moment she did, his mouth latched onto the soft, exposed swell of her bre*sts, now bare to the night air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His pointed tongue pressed against her n</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">pple. He took a full mouthful of her bre</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">st, sucking hard at the plump are*la until it stiffened into a tight peak, then flattened again under his relentless attention. Seoryeong tangled her fingers in his hair, holding him to her chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn… Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, this isn’t right. Something’s wrong.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frowning, Seoryeong stared at Wooshin’s clear-headed intensity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why is the dr*g not working?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stiffened slightly as she watched her wet n*pple glisten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I definitely used an anesthetic, did I accidentally grab animal pheromones instead? No, that’s impossible…’ Her unease only grew when Wooshin suddenly gripped her bottom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This bastard… is he even human?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since ingesting injectable dr*gs orally usually had little effect, she’d stolen Rompun, a veterinary anesthetic from the hunting lodge, and mixed a heavy dose into his water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d used a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Enough that he should’ve at least fallen into a drowsy stupor. Using animal-grade anesthetics on a human wasn’t just illegal, it was borderline attempted murder. But now, Seoryeong regretted not being even bolder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Turn over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His hand slid past her underwear, fingers reaching the damp seam between her legs. After teasing her clenched entrance, he suddenly flipped her onto her stomach, as if deciding this position wouldn’t do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t touch the ground, just brace against my knees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wooshin yanked her pant*es down to her thighs and buried his face between her legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re the one who wanted to do it here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ngh..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be good. Just look at the stars for a bit. I’ll make it quick.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like a wild dog, he bowed his head and dragged his tongue up her perineum. This—Ngh… No… At the slick, lingering caresses, Seoryeong bit her lower lip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thought of her exposed s*x being fully visible from behind made her face burn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘When the hell is the dr*g supposed to kick in…?!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His broad tongue pressed down and lapped slowly at her tight entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No! I can’t let this happen. As Seoryeong tried to crawl away, he gripped her thighs and sank his teeth into her flushed, clenching folds.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hhng!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lost in frenzy, he buried his face deeper, drenching her swollen flesh until it glistened. Schlick, slurp- the obscene sounds of him greedily sucking up her juices reached her ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The dr*g. I definitely gave him a lot! So why…!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, just wait.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seoryeong thrashed, but Wooshin pinned her down and speared her with the rigid tip of his tongue. When he pushed harder, it slid in smoothly, as if sucked in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah. No, stop!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the wet muscle plunged in and out, Seoryeong gritted her teeth, a moan slipping free. Wooshin spread her thighs wider, twisting his head as if kissing her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time his tongue thrust into her soaked heat, a lewd squelch echoed. He was the one who’d been dr*gged, yet her vision was starting to blur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nngh… Hah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their damp breaths and heated skin rubbed relentlessly. Her s*x pulsed unbearably; her arms trembled. Each time his teeth grazed her tender flesh, her vision flashed white. She felt like she’d collapse face-first any second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Han Seoryeong… Did you put something in me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?! Don’t talk nonsense!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why so defensive? Could have slipped it on your fingers and shoved it right in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Otherwise, this doesn’t make sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ngh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why’re you even wetter? Fuck, the smell’s driving me insane.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His sharp voice suddenly thickened, his words slurring drunkenly. Even his lips, which had been sucking at her slick folds, paused mid-motion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seoryeong, who’d been counting silently in her head, glanced back. Drowsiness was creeping into the corners of his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyone else would have collapsed long ago. She’d dr*gged him right before they got in the Jeep, how the hell had he held out this long?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shame burning through her, Seoryeong pushed free. Wooshin’s teeth scraped her labia one last time, sending heat flaring across her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This fucking bastard… Pleasure surged, her lower belly quaking, but then his hand dropped limply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His unfocused eyes blinked once before his head lolled forward. Seoryeong stared, then brushed back the hair clinging to his forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Goodbye. Sleep well.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The moment you wake up, your hell begins.’</span></p>
