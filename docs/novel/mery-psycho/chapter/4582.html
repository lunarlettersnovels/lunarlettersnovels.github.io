            <p><strong>Chapter 160.1</strong></p>
<p>When she said she would wear a black dress instead of a white one, Wooshin stared at her face for a moment before silently nodding.</p>
<p>Seoryeong hastily borrowed a black dress from the owner of the guesthouse. Upon hearing her situation, the owner clapped her hands and mentioned that she happened to have a vintage little black dress from a luxury brand, over sixty years old, tucked away in an old wardrobe.</p>
<p>It was a sleek sheath dress with an elegant round neckline, sleeveless to reveal the shoulders, hugging tightly at the waist before flowing down to the ankles.</p>
<p>The owner added that the dress had gained even more fame after Audrey Hepburn wore it. “Back in my day, I also…” she trailed off, regretfully patting her now-prominent belly.</p>
<p>After a late lunch, Seoryeong climbed the hill with Wooshin. They had rushed here without rest, so even this brief moment of respite felt surreal.</p>
<p>She kept her eyes on the man who had once been her husband and would become her husband again tomorrow.</p>
<p>Her dry lips twisted slightly. Still gripping Kim Hyun’s unmistakable hand tightly, she pointed toward the sky.</p>
<p>“Instructor, look. The birds are gathering.”</p>
<p>On the hillside, people had gathered to summon the birds that would carry away the dead. They cut open the rib cages of the corpses, pulled out the entrails with their hands, and scattered them.</p>
<p>Then, to ensure the birds could feed sufficiently, they crushed the heads of the deceased with large stones.</p>
<p>Some turned their heads away or wept into handkerchiefs covering their noses and mouths, but Seoryeong tilted her head back and stared only at the descending flock.</p>
<p>‘So you’re drawn to the stench of rotting flesh and blood…’ Wooshin’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Wooshin silently observed the scene before bowing his head as if in silent prayer. She didn’t know who he was praying for, nor did she ask.</p>
<p>There was no need to say it. He surely hadn’t forgotten what kind of scene they had left behind.</p>
<p>She, too, closed her eyes briefly before fixing her gaze on the ravaged corpses.</p>
<p>The funeral wouldn’t end until the flesh was gone and only bones remained. Which meant that while the bodies were being devoured, they would be holding a wedding on the other side.</p>
<p>A fitting spectacle for a pair like them.</p>
<p>Seoryeong closed her eyes again and offered a silent prayer.</p>
<p>Wooshin left with the owner to buy lamb for tomorrow’s feast, leaving her alone in the room. She studied her reflection in the mirror with unfamiliarity.</p>
<p>‘You’ve grown so much, Sonya. You really lived long enough to become an adult.’</p>
<p>She rubbed her cheeks, then touched her features, which still felt awkward to her.</p>
<p>Knock, knock. At the sound, the owner’s wife entered, holding scented candles.</p>
<p>“Did the dress fit well?”</p>
<p>The effortless Russian that slipped out was met with an equally fluent reply.</p>
<p>“Enough to make me mutter to myself not to steal it.”</p>
<p>The owner’s eyes widened before she burst into hearty laughter. Seoryeong pressed a finger to her lips. “It’s a secret from my husband.”</p>
<p>He’d think she dated a Russian man.</p>
<p>Playing along, the owner assured her she could trust her.</p>
<p>“But are you really going to wear a black dress to your one and only wedding? If I’ve spoken out of turn-”</p>
<p>Seoryeong shook her head. Hearing that a funeral was being held here had complicated her thoughts, but that was because of the final moments of someone she had witnessed, not something the owner needed to apologize for.</p>
<p>“By the way, you two must be really in love.”</p>
<p>“Us?”</p>
<p>“That husband of yours couldn’t take his eyes off you!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“He kept rubbing my rough old hands, begging me to call him immediately if anything happened. That sly, charming smile of his… no ordinary man could pull that off. You must’ve had your share of heartache with him.”</p>
<p>“So much.”</p>
<p>The owner laughed warmly, her face crinkling with affection.</p>
<p>“Come outside. I’ll show you around the house.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong followed the owner outside and took in the rustic interior. The owner enthusiastically pointed out the open courtyard where the celebration would begin tomorrow.</p>
<p>It was a space visible from the second and third-floor terraces where guests could look down.</p>
<p>More excited than the bride herself, the owner added, “My husband used to play instruments when he was young.” She explained that he had been polishing a traditional string instrument, the tar, for days now.</p>
<p>Seoryeong simply smiled in response.</p>
<p>“But are you really okay with celebrating for complete strangers like us?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Just remember us briefly’ long enough that you might forget us once you turn away.”</p>
<p>“No family coming?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong thought for a moment before answering.</p>
<p>“Well… maybe one might show up.”</p>
