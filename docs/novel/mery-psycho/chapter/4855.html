            <p><strong>Chapter 17.1</strong></p>
<p><em>What… is that?</em></p>
<p>Seoryeong kept blinking her eyes.</p>
<p>It was as big as a water bottle, but that wasn’t the problem. It wasn’t a problem that it was shaven.</p>
<p>The problem was the tattoo… The black tattoo was in contrast to his white skin.</p>
<p>Letters that were wrapping around his penis like a snake. <em>It looks like a foreign language</em>, she thought as she turned her head while focusing on the letter. She also thought about how there are many strange people in the world.</p>
<p>“There’s no use of you staring like that.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>She looked up in surprise as she heard a low toned voice.</p>
<p>“You can only read it when you look from here.”</p>
<p>He pointed at his bellybutton.</p>
<p>As she realized that she was staring at someone else’s penis, she felt a little shame. Her face was blushing as she realized her mistake as they met eyes again.</p>
<p>The man who seemed calm started to look down at Seoryeong mysteriously.</p>
<p>His eyes were examining her oddly.</p>
<p>His face frowned. Then he turned the shower off.</p>
<p>And it happened suddenly. He suddenly lowered Seoryeong’s mask.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Before she could react, her face was revealed. His eyes widened then he frowned.</p>
<p>“You…–!”</p>
<p>It looked like he wanted to say something before he stopped himself. His eyes looked clearly shooked.</p>
<p>Seoryeong wanted to leave the shower during that chance, but he was in her way.</p>
<p>“…. Just what are you—“</p>
<p>He frowned while letting his breath out.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t know someone was in here. I’ll be leaving…”</p>
<p>Then, there was loud noise by the door.</p>
<p>Before she could be surprised by the noise, he quickly grabbed Seoryeong. Her body was touching hers as they were stuck in a stall.</p>
<p>“Move.”</p>
<p>She tried to push him with her elbow in surprise, but he wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>“Wait… Just wait so I can think.” He said, “What are you…”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s clothes also got wet due to his wet body.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>His accusing eyes examined Seoryeong’s face thoroughly.</p>
<p>He seemed like a weird person. Seoryeong kicked her tongue and got rid of the impressive first impression she had of him.</p>
<p>“Someone said that they left their dog tag in the shower.”</p>
<p>“No, I was curious about what you are doing in this company.”</p>
<p>“I cook and do laundry.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The man brushed his face while frowning. His lips moved like he was about to pour something out but didn’t say anything in the end. He just gulped.</p>
<p>Seoryeong spoke while putting her mask back on.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry but this isn’t necessary. It’s not a big deal for me to face some naked agents. What I do is do their laundry and feed them anyway.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Personally, I find this more disturbing. Step aside.”</p>
<p>“Is it a habit of yours? Staring at people,” he asked, casting a glance down at her smaller frame. A few water droplets from his hair landed on her face.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Since when?”</p>
<p>The man stared tenaciously at Seoryeong. He seemed to be agitated by the fact that she was staring at his face, even though she only did because of his bottom that was touching her.</p>
<p>After she got her sight back, she did acquire a new habit of examining people, but she didn’t have a reason to explain that much to him.</p>
<p>The familiar smell that came with the smell of water. Seoryeong could no longer stand it as she pushed him roughly.</p>
<p>But his shoulder only moved slightly, as his hands hit the wall as if to trap her even further.</p>
<p>Now, she was really annoyed.</p>
<p>Seoryeong kicked at him, but he effortlessly dodged the blow. Frustrated, she twisted the shower knob to the hottest setting, directing scalding water at him as if it were a punishment.</p>
<p>“—!” he exclaimed, but he remained unfazed even as the boiling water hit him. Though his shoulders reddened from the heat, he seemed impervious to pain, unmoving as if unaffected. Meanwhile, Seoryeong found herself getting splashed by the water as well.</p>
<p>Finally, he calmly turned off the water and stepped out, spitting out some of the water. Seoryeong’s eyes widened in shock. It felt as if something heavy were pressing down on her…</p>
<p>The tattoo he mentioned became visible. It was only when the head of his penis reached his belly button that she could fully read the entire message.</p>
<p>Если жизнь тебя обманет</p>
<p><strong>If by life you were deceived.</strong></p>
<p>“I told you not to stare at it.”</p>
<p>He flicked water with his fingers at Seoryeong. She shut her eyes.</p>
<p><em>F*cking pervert.</em></p>
<p>Even though he was the one fully aroused in front of a stranger, he was so full of himself.</p>
<p>She felt nauseated.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As he hastily dressed without properly drying off, parts of his clothes remained damp. Lee Wooshin entered the special force office and promptly locked the door behind him.</p>
<p>He then inserted the wireless in-ear device into his ear. Despite his typically cold demeanor, his face contorted in annoyance.</p>
<p>– Sir…! Did you call, sir?</p>
<p>The cheerful voice that was always on standby greeted him. Lee Wooshin blinked and clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>– ’Sir?’ The voice called out to him several times, but he didn’t respond, focused instead on calming the nauseous feeling churning inside him. Time seemed to stretch on endlessly.</p>
<p>And when he opened his eyes again, even his pupils seemed to have frozen in place. He calmed his emotions and then asked.</p>
<p>“Why is the owl here?”</p>
<p>–…. Pardon?</p>
