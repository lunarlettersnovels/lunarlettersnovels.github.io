            <p><strong>Chapter 141</strong></p>
<p>He opened his mouth wide and sucked in her already swollen nub. Then, he inserted his tongue inside her.</p>
<p>“Hmmph, yeah, hmm…”</p>
<p>Seoyeong’s head tilted back, and her lower abdomen began to heat up.</p>
<p>Seoryeong tried to suppress her voice, but when his lips sucked on her clitor!s again, her jaw dropped involuntarily. At first, only a sharp current flowed, but later, her breath caught in her throat.</p>
<p>“Haaah…”</p>
<p>The strong sucking sensation made her forget everything, and her vision turned white. He sucked on her like he was eating a small pearl. Her pelv!s shook, and her entrance convulsed roughly.</p>
<p>The liquid flowing out of her was being swallowed by someone’s hot tongue. She trembled with her legs and clenched her fists.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Without warning, his finger entered her. It seemed that his words about being in a hurry were not a lie, as he cursed at the tight hole.</p>
<p>He grabbed her breasts and pulled out his finger. Lee Woosin wet his three fingers and inserted them again repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Hmmph!”</p>
<p>Every time he penetrated her delicate flesh, a squelching sound was heard. His fingers moved in and out quickly, revealing his impatience.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I can be gentle today.”</p>
<p>“You’re making me crazy, Seoyeong,” He added.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin scowled, as if admitting defeat, and buried his nose in her vulva. The hot air from his mouth made her hole flutter. Seoryeong was driven mad with desire.</p>
<p>His tongue licked her persistently, and his fingers rubbed her.</p>
<p>“Hmmph, hmmph!”</p>
<p>She was on the verge of losing her mind from the intense excitement. The man, who had tightened his grip on her hips, began to suck her openly, covering it with his lips.</p>
<p>His lips wrapped around her nub, biting it tightly, and then he gritted his teeth. As she felt like she was going to collapse, she hit his shoulder.</p>
<p>She tensed up the moment the thick, hot glans touched her vagina, it was like a hammer.</p>
<p>“Damn it, I don’t have a c0ndom.”</p>
<p>He stopped all movement and contorted his face in a savage expression. Lee Wooshin buried his face in her breasts, letting out a pained moan.</p>
<p>He let out a sigh of frustration and only rubbed his tip against her slippery entrance. Although it seemed like it would enter at any moment, Wooshin took deep breaths and quickly calmed down.</p>
<p>As he tried to pull away, Seoryeong grabbed his arm in a panic.</p>
<p>“Just do it.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter, just put it in, quickly…”</p>
<p>“Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>A sharp voice cut him off.</p>
<p>“Even if you’re crazy, that’s not an excuse.”</p>
<p>His rough thumb gently stroked her reddened eyes. His gaze was unfathomable.</p>
<p>“Don’t make such reckless comments.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You can’t say that anywhere, and especially not to me.”</p>
<p>Wooshin scolded her gently, furrowing his brow as he kissed her face all over. As his affection poured out, she turned her head away, avoiding his gaze.</p>
<p>Just as the man had calmed down and was about to get up, Seoryeong suddenly flipped him over and pinned him down. Then, she grabbed his erect manho0d and sat down on it with a thud.</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>Wooshin’s eyes widened in shock. Seoryeong grasped his stomach, her face pale as she tried to catch her breath. As expected, the thick and heavy shaft pierced her belly, making it hard for her to breathe.</p>
<p>“Seoryeong, you’re not going to get away with this!”</p>
<p>He shouted, pushing her shoulder, but she didn’t budge. Instead, she pushed her hips forward.</p>
<p>“Ugh, you!”</p>
<p>Wooshin’s neck turned bright red, and he gritted his teeth. Seoryeong squeezed him inside. Without a c0ndom, the ridges of his manho0d feel prominent.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to let you get away with this. Does my warning sound like a joke to you?”</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed with anger, and Wooshin’s Adam’s apple bobbed up and down.</p>
<p>“What is this, some kind of outrageous behavior?”</p>
<p>“Explain it to me. Lee Wooshin, do you think I’m easy to push around?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Their gazes met, and the atmosphere, which had been hot and steamy, suddenly froze. Seoryeong glared at him, awkwardly moving her hips.</p>
<p>With each thrust, Wooshin’s face contorted in a mixture of pain and fear, as if he was about to collapse at any moment. Despite this, he weakly grasped Seoryeong’s thighs. His lips were parched and dry.</p>
<p>“Hmmph!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s body trembled, and she broke out in a cold sweat. Just by sitting on him, her insides were being ravaged. She felt like her head was going to explode.</p>
<p>“So, you just went out on your own, despite our promise?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You thought my words were a joke, didn’t you? That I told you to wait?”</p>
<p>“Seoryeong, what’s going on…”</p>
<p>“You should have just stayed here…!”</p>
<p>She punched Lee Wooshin’s abdominal muscles with her fist.</p>
<p>“Don’t ever go out like that again, or you’ll regret it!”</p>
<p>Her words were fragmented and disjointed. Seoryeong grasped Lee Wooshin’s neck with both hands, feeling the warmth of his skin and the rapid beating of his pulse.</p>
<p>“Just stay still… stay still in the hospital room… I told you.”</p>
<p>As she moved her hips, he penetrated her hard. She raised her hips and thrust down, again and again.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin was Kim Hyun, and Kim Hyun was Lee Wooshin. Lee Wooshin was Kim Hyun, and Kim Hyun was Lee Wooshin… Her mind was completely muddled.</p>
<p>She squeezed out every last bit of energy, thrusting wildly.</p>
<p>Seoryeong pressed down on Lee Wooshin’s Adam’s apple, hard. If she applied a bit more pressure like this…</p>
<p>“Ahk…!”</p>
<p>Her insides were clinging to him tightly. Despite the rough s*x, Lee Wooshin’s Adam’s apple moved lazily.</p>
<p>“Hmmph!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s thighs trembled with pain, and she couldn’t bear the throbbing sensation anymore. It was then that Lee Wooshin, who had been somewhat cooperative until now, suddenly sat up and grasped her face.</p>
<p>“That’s enough, let’s stop here.”</p>
<p>He looked down at her with a slightly scrunched-up expression, his eyes narrowed. Seoryeong tried to turn her head away, but Lee Wooshin’s firm grip and long fingers wouldn’t let her go.</p>
<p>“Let’s see how far we can go, shall we?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Seoryeong, are you trying to give me a hard time? Do you think I’m some kind of idiot who can’t tell when I’m being played?”</p>
<p>“W-what…”</p>
<p>“Hey, do you have a mirror? I think I’m the one being raped here, not you. Why are you crying?”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, but you’re not even wet.”</p>
<p>He flipped their positions, his eyes scrunched up in discomfort. Seoryeong’s back fell onto the mattress, and their joined bodies became even more deeply entwined. Hmmph…! He dominated against her unexpectedly with a gentle rhythm.</p>
<p>“Seoryeong, you’re always harder on yourself when things get tough, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Someone who knew her, someone who knew her better than anyone else…</p>
<p>“If you want to do something, do it slowly. I can control myself.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin clenched his jaw, as if gritting his teeth, and slightly adjusted his angle before starting to move his hips.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, Seoryeong, do whatever you want. Just don’t touch my body, okay? If you touch me carelessly, I can hold back my climax.”</p>
<p>Thud, thud, his slow and deliberate movements continued. Although the speed was slow, the force of his thrusts was heavy.</p>
<p>Seoryeong struggled to breathe, gazing blankly at his face. Every time she looked at his smooth face, she felt a surge of heat in her belly.</p>
<p>“Hmmph, hmmph!”</p>
<p>As the rounded tip of his penis thrust into her, her eyes welled up with tears. The force of his thrusts was rough, but it didn’t hurt.</p>
<p>Her insides clung to him tightly, and the slow, gentle thrusts continued. His, which seemed to be made of molten metal, was melting her insides. She could feel the liquid pooling inside her.</p>
<p>It was a gentle, soothing s*x, just as he had promised. It was like a therapy that calmed her down and reassured her. As he slowly penetrated her, Lee Wooshin’s face began to overlap with Kim Hyun’s in her mind.</p>
