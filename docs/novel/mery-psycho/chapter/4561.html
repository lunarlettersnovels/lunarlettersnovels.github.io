            <p><strong>Chapter 170.2</strong></p>
<p>At that moment, a fleeting memory of his father’s touch came to mind. It was a memory from long ago, but the moments of being loved were etched into his body…</p>
<p>Yuri gently patted the child’s thin back without causing pain.</p>
<p>“A snowstorm is coming soon.”</p>
<p>As he rhythmically patted and stroked the child’s back, the thrashing gradually subsided.</p>
<p>He recalled hearing somewhere that pressing a hyperactive opponent tightly could help calm them down. Sometimes, he had seen his grandfather embrace his grandmother from behind while giving her an injection when she was agitated.</p>
<p>“I really don’t understand, but if you’re lost here, I’ll help you find your parents.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Let’s go down together. I’ll take off this mask and give you some food. You must be hungry.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You can’t be out in the forest alone dressed like this.”</p>
<p>Holding the child inside his fur coat, he noticed the little belly protruding, almost as if it were pregnant.</p>
<p>Though he couldn’t catch such a beast, why was he in this position? Yuri relaxed and leaned his head back.</p>
<p>The child seemed fascinated by the soft, fluffy coat, wriggling around inside it. Looking down at the instinctively curled-up child sucking his thumb, he murmured softly.</p>
<p>“But, kid, you were trying to die earlier.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The small body stirred in his arms.</p>
<p>“If that’s not the case, then why were you up in the tree closest to the cliff?”</p>
<p>In an instant, the child shot his head up and glared at Yuri.</p>
<p>‘What? He understands Russian.’</p>
<p>Yuri raised his eyebrows nonchalantly. The child’s bead-like eyes silently poured out deep resentment. Recognizing that vivid emotion, Yuri laughed in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but you can’t act like that in front of me.”</p>
<p>For now, he needed to take this child to Winter Castle. He would remove that grotesque mask, wash him up, and warm some milk for him… and then…</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>At that moment, a clear whistle echoed from afar. It sounded like a bird’s call, continuous and elongated, as if someone were summoning someone else.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the child, who had been lazily sprawled out, sprang to attention.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the little beast darted out of the fur coat, glancing back at Yuri with a hesitant look before taking off down the forest path at an incredible speed.</p>
<p>“Wait!”</p>
<p>Yuri shouted in confusion, but the child didn’t look back.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether he was returning to his original spot or fleeing, but he faded into the snowy landscape, disappearing into the storm.</p>
<p>A cold wind rushed into his empty stomach. It truly felt like he was possessed by a ghost.</p>
<p>‘Am I going crazy?’</p>
<p>If I say I saw a small child running on all fours without a face…</p>
<p>‘Would anyone believe me?’</p>
<p>“You must have seen it wrong.”</p>
<p>His grandfather shook his head firmly.</p>
<p>He could have brushed it off, but he had inadvertently made a slip of the tongue.</p>
<p>He could have simply said he had rolled down, but instead, he had confessed to seeing something strange in the forest.</p>
<p>In truth, he had been dazed since coming down empty-handed. Yuri returned looking thoroughly beaten, having failed at hunting, but today, he found his grandfather’s gaze didn’t bother him at all.</p>
<p>It felt as if he had been starving for a long time. Experiencing this feeling for the first time left Yuri feeling dazed, as if a screw had come loose.</p>
<p>Maxim, who was sharply scrutinizing his grandson’s appearance, finally clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“They say that if your mind is weak, you can easily be haunted by illusions. Yuri, I understand that your body has grown quickly, but take it easy.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Since your body has grown suddenly, there must be many things that seem new… and exciting. However, that awkward vigor can always lead to trouble. Especially for a minor like you, who still lacks self-control. If you abuse it, your mind will become dull, your actions impulsive, and you will lose your dignity.”</p>
<p>What is he talking about? Yuri frowned.</p>
<p>“Daria is worried that you’ve been in the bathroom for too long.”</p>
<p>His grandfather frowned, looking displeased.</p>
<p>“Moderation in m*sturbation, Yuri Solzhenitsyn.”</p>
