            <p><strong>Chapter 88.2</strong></p>
<p>Lee Wooshin was clever. Incredibly so, by handing her the gun, he was shifting all the responsibility onto her in the most devious way.</p>
<p>But what was even more absurd was that, despite her disbelief, she didn’t actually want to pull the trigger. Her grip tightened on the gun, then loosened, and tightened again, only to slip weakly from her grasp as another rough kiss followed.</p>
<p>And then, as his firm tongue expertly twisted around hers, Seoryeong slammed the gun’s barrel into his smooth forehead with all her strength.</p>
<p>“――!”</p>
<p>It’s true I can’t shoot a gun, but no one said I can’t hit someone. As soon as that relentless tongue pulled away, Seoryeong noticed Lee Wooshin’s forehead swelling red from the blow.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin furrowed his brows and spoke in a half-hoarse voice.</p>
<p>“Why hit me now after taking it all in?”</p>
<p>His lips, wet with saliva and bright red, looked provocatively seductive.</p>
<p>“Because I feel like trash.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Looking for my husband while fooling around with another man behind his back?”</p>
<p>“I never told you to do that.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“So you’re not completely oblivious.” He smirked, pressing his tongue to the edge of his lips as if amused.</p>
<p>“Hate your husband as much as you want, but the rest, you can take care of with me.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>He spoke while pressing his lips to her chin. His eyes, burning with desire yet coldly observing her, were disturbingly predatory.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her stomach churned, and cold sweat broke out. There seemed to be no way out.</p>
<p>At the same time, Seoryeong found herself intrigued by how Lee Wooshin expressed his feelings so openly. Even after being married, she had never been able to be that honest, always suppressed by anxiety…</p>
<p>She had longed for unconditional love from her husband but swallowed those words, fearing he’d find her overwhelming.</p>
<p>And the more she experienced life, the more she realized that most people didn’t want to pour their affection into a bottomless pit.</p>
<p>But why was he even after failing like me.</p>
<p>“I even told you to go out and have fun with someone sweet and cute, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>She had said something like that once. At the time, she was genuinely worried that the instructor would develop a distorted view of women.</p>
<p>Her eyes wavered, unsure of how to process the situation.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’re cute, but you’re strong and sexy.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You even showed me your real self, i trained you, and soon I’ll even take down the deputy chief for you. I’m giving you everything you’ve asked for, but don’t you think you’re being a little cold to me?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“How about you tell me directly, then?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong wanted to rewind time. She never imagined that the instructor who had once been so strict with her would now be pushing her to the edge like this, devouring her in such a way.</p>
<p>The way he was crossing her boundaries so boldly terrified her. She had only ever known men like Kim Hyun, who were careful and respectful. She had never encountered someone who forced himself on her like this.</p>
<p>“No, Instructor! No, Team Leader.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Startled, she tried to push his shoulders away, but instead, he only intertwined his fingers around her slender waist. A sigh slipped out of her.</p>
<p>“I… I can’t even trust what I see anymore.”</p>
<p>“But ignoring what’s right in front of you seems foolish too.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I guarantee, there’s no one as big and bent as me.”</p>
<p>He smiled, like a snake whispering tempting words, urging her to taste the forbidden fruit.</p>
<p>“You can turn on the lights and examine it with a magnifying glass if you want.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>It was a tempting offer, but her insides churned. This felt like an unexpected disaster for someone like her, who had only ever focused on her husband.</p>
<p>What if she refused, and it ruined everything they had planned? At a time when she needed to unite their strength! Seoryeong felt as though she was being tested.</p>
<p>“Your husband betrayed you, so why can’t you?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Sleeping with another man, Seoryeong, that’s not the real crime.”</p>
<p>He was like junk food—dangerous enough to shake the foundation of her once-steadfast resolve.</p>
<p>Neither the disappearance of her husband nor the overwhelming might of the NIS could compare to the threat this man posed, even during the most suffocating moments of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Nothing was as unpredictable or dangerous as Lee Wooshin. He was far more troubling than her initial ignorance when she started this whole endeavor.</p>
<p>“What exactly do you see in me, Instructor?”</p>
<p>There was no more of the kind, pretty, fragile persona she once had—none of the qualities people typically found endearing. She hadn’t shown any of that to him. So what on earth did he see?</p>
<p>“Oh—didn’t you know?”</p>
<p>Despite the furrow in his brow, Lee Wooshin reached out and gently tucked her disheveled hair behind her ear.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, you act like a real b*tch.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>She hadn’t expected anything romantic, but it still felt like a blow to the head.</p>
<p>Someone casually chuckling at the part of herself she’d hidden in shame all her life—it left her speechless.</p>
<p>“But that’s exactly what interests me. I want to wedge myself into that gap I don’t quite understand. That’s why I’m doing all this, risking my pride because of Agent Han Seoryeong. You’ve bruised my ego quite a bit.”</p>
<p>Voices echoed down the hallway. The sound of heavy military boots and deep, boisterous chatter quickly passed by.</p>
<p>Yet, in that moment, all sense of reality faded, and only the sharp clarity of his smile remained.</p>
<p>As expected, she couldn’t fire the gun.</p>
