            <p><strong>Chapter 39.1</strong></p>
<p>While some could communicate silently but act immediately, Seoryeong was treated as invisible. Even when desperate glances brushed past her, they naturally overlooked her as if she didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Her body became even colder as the wet clothes stole her heat. The drill became more than just a drill; it became a race against the clock, and some men began to faint.</p>
<p>Waiting instructors carried the fainted party to an emergency bed.</p>
<p>“You’re out.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin tapped the nape of a recruit with the loudspeaker and announced.</p>
<p>“Failed dive, hypothermia, fatigue fracture, internal illness, rupture, panic, all dismissals.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Those who drop out midway are deemed useless. We’re not here to slowly nurture soldiers; we’re selecting those who can be deployed immediately.”</p>
<p>The men glanced at Lee Wooshin briefly, then returned to untying the bindings. No longer the only one, Seoryeong walked over to the struggling men and began to help them.</p>
<p>“Not there, move down two centimeters…!”</p>
<p>The men raised their eyebrows at the sudden interruption, but they were in a hurry and obeyed.</p>
<p>“Between the wrists, pass it down…!”</p>
<p>“Whoa… is it right here, this space?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is. Just pull harder, harder!”</p>
<p>Finally, the soldier untied the knot effortlessly. They freed themselves and quickly moved to help others. Seoryeong breathed a sigh of relief as she watched them.</p>
<p>“You know, with your help, I could have gotten my laces…”</p>
<p>“I’m, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It’s just too cold… I really feel like I’m going to die…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Just go home. You might actually die if you stay here like this.”</p>
<p>They ran to the dormitory with pale, trembling faces. Who said worrying about taking the shortcut was unnecessary…!</p>
<p>I told them to loosen up! Seoryeong watched them fading away with a sense of futility.</p>
<p>Her molars were about to crack, and her red, frozen hands ached like they would tear her flesh, but for a moment, she felt nothing.</p>
<p>She couldn’t tell if it was cold or warm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unshackled men screamed and ran back to the living quarters, leaving only a few of them on the sandy beach.</p>
<p>“First four in line. The rest are out.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin had been watching Seoryeong’s behaviour with amusement from the start. “She’s a sadistic one, a sadist,” he thought. And with the odd number of people, she was the only one left out like a leftover.</p>
<p>Seoryeong glanced momentarily at the pitch-black sky where only stars were visible. Though white breath escaped her lips incessantly, seeing the stars made her feel slightly better.</p>
<p>After all, the reason for enduring all this suffering is ultimately to reach that star.</p>
<p>Seoryeong was neither disappointed nor angry at being left behind. It was a knot she would have to untie on her own.</p>
<p>Seoryeong drew in a deep breath, her muscles tensing as she pulled her arms back with practiced precision. To an outsider, it might have resembled a martial arts stance, but for her, it was a familiar movement from her gymnastics days—a secret ritual that always eased her stress, despite being warned against it.</p>
<p>With a quick check of the knot, she felt a rush of relief as she confirmed the gap was wide enough. Positioning her arms above her head, she stretched her elbows as far apart as possible before reaching a critical point where she had to bend her shoulders.</p>
<p>A sudden gasp broke the tense silence, and Seoryeong glanced over to see someone staring at her with wide-eyed horror.</p>
<p>Her shoulder popped, but thankfully it didn’t dislodge. She had aged, and her muscles and ligaments don’t work as smoothly as they did when she was younger.</p>
<p>Still, she had no trouble turning her arm, which was tied behind her back, 180 degrees and thrusting it forward. Gasps of disbelief and disgust could be heard around her, but she didn’t care.</p>
<p>Now, Seoryeong calmly untied the knot with her teeth. Watching only the other members, who were spoon-fed without any food, made untying seem not so difficult after all.</p>
<p>“Phew….”</p>
<p>Finally freeing her hands and feet, Seoryeong staggered to her feet.</p>
<p>I should have done this sooner, I shouldn’t have been so stupid……!</p>
<p>The wind, which had been like ferocious claws, felt cool for the first time. The feeling of taking a step past everyone was equally exhilarating. Especially when she passed by a pale Lee Wooshin.</p>
<p>“You…….”</p>
<p>Whatever he was about to say, Seoryeong’s trembling body urged her on faster.</p>
