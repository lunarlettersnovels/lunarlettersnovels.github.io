            <p><strong>Chapter 1.2</strong></p>
<p>“Hyeon-ssi…”</p>
<p>She fell helplessly into the first care and love she had ever received. She immersed herself in the fresh flowers he brought every morning, let him put on shoes for her, and sometimes fed her and helped her bathe.</p>
<p>When the sun rose, the pouring bird kiss acted as an alarm, and at night, he immersed her in leisurely and deep ecstasy.</p>
<p>When it clear she couldn’t raise a child with her body, they tried to restrain from penetration as much as possible. He also didn’t trust condoms much. So they had full-blown sex occasionally, focusing solely on her pleasure.</p>
<p>The two years of marriage were far from peaceful.</p>
<p>“Haah… Hngh…! Haah…!”</p>
<p>He tightened his grip around Seoryeong’s neck, simultaneously. In response to the intense aftermath of relentless sex, her body slackened, and his body naturally slumped.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, they embraced their sweat-soaked bodies and exchanged kisses, their breaths mingling.</p>
<p>His still-inserted organ swelled again. The penis, pulsating within her was hard to miss.</p>
<p>Her husband was acting strange. Especially today, he seemed really off…</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Upon opening her eyes, she grunted, feeling pain all over her body as if she had just been in an accident.</p>
<p>The sex that started early in the evening and lasted well into the early morning felt nauseating even in retrospect.</p>
<p>Even after the long and arduous intercourse came to an end, her husband continued to explore her body, leaving traces of blood in various places as he passionately sucked on her flesh.</p>
<p>They needed to have a conversation about what had happened last night, as it felt like they were haunted by some kind of ghost…</p>
<p>First and foremost, her husband had to leave for work.</p>
<p>Seoryeong emerged from the bed without bothering to put on clothes. She could navigate freely around their honeymoon home without a cane, as she had enough sense to gauge the location of objects, despite the dull sensation.</p>
<p>“…Hyeon-ssi.”</p>
<p>The moment her exhausted voice rang out, there was a rustling sound as if he was tying a tie, and the fabrics brushed against each other right in front of her nose.</p>
<p>Receiving a kiss directly on one cheek, Seoryeong casually intercepted his tie.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you wake me up today?”</p>
<p>“I thought Seoryeong-ssi might be tired, so I wanted you to sleep more. You need more rest.”</p>
<p>He kissed her round shoulder one after another. She didn’t mind and perfectly tied her husband’s tie.</p>
<p>After quitting her job as a caregiver due to retinal dysfunction, Seoryeong became a full-time housewife. The main reason was her deteriorating retinal function, but Hyeon also wished her to stay at home. Therefore, she took care of her husband’s morning routine without fail.</p>
<p>Having spent a long time in the orphanage, the reality of waving goodbye to family and waiting for them still felt unreal. Each time felt like flipping through a storybook.</p>
<p>Of course, she hid her obsessive desire to confirm and reconfirm his existence.</p>
<p>After all, that’s what she learned from the teacher.</p>
<p>“So, I didn’t know sex would be so exhausting and painful.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The hand that was wandering around her collarbone abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about it later. You’re going to be late if you keep dawdling, Hyeon-ssi.”</p>
<p>A light sigh escaped from him. When she felt his gaze thorough her bare body, she chuckled.</p>
<p>“I want to see Hyeon-ssi too. Your face and everything.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be sad and just touch me.”</p>
<p>He pulled Seoryeong’s hand to his face. Despite being surprisingly well-built for his height, his body didn’t feel intimidating but rather immature and affectionate.</p>
<p>“Still… even if I touch you every day, I’ll miss you and want to see you for the rest of my life. What if you had come a little earlier to my life? Then I could have seen Hyeon-ssi’s face….”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about that.”</p>
<p>At times like this, the desire to clear the misty and blurred vision became even stronger.</p>
<p>Will you be by my side forever? Give me something more than love.</p>
<p>The sticky words requesting an overwhelming affection rose to her throat.</p>
<p>However, Seoryeong bit her lip and suppressed the struggling emotions. This was the way not to make mistakes, as she learned from the teacher. Do not burden the other person, digest your emotions on your own.</p>
<p>The other person shouldn’t feel scared. She reminded herself.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seoryeong occasionally suppressed her anxious feelings and presented a gentle and kind face. She wanted to live an ordinary life, so she had to become an ordinary woman.</p>
<p>“What time will you finish work today? No company dinner?”</p>
<p>In the meantime, he brought a thin blanket and silently wrapped it around Seoryeong. He lowered his head as if to kiss her but then quietly withdrew.</p>
<p>“You caught a cold. Just in case a delivery person comes, don’t open the door.”</p>
<p>“Always saying that. By the way, I heard someone’s moving out.” Seryeong said.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s a bit messy. Sometimes I hear banging sounds, probably from organizing stuff.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it noisy?” He gently caressed Seoryeong’s ear. It was an affectionate touch, but somehow it quickly subsided, unlike usual.</p>
<p>“Just curious. Since we’re friendly with the neighbors in our villa.”</p>
<p>“It’ll quiet down soon.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I’m leaving now.”</p>
<p>He turned the doorknob as he moved away.</p>
<p>In that moment, Seoryeong reached out, saying, “Sweetheart!” The endearing nickname slipped out with a dry swallow.</p>
<p>However, he only paused briefly, turning to face her. He didn’t respond with a friendly smile, nor did he reciprocate the joyous tone or exchange a kiss.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>An inexplicable silence hung in the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she had a hunch that their eyes had met.</p>
<p>But he wasn’t smiling.</p>
<p>Since they were a married couple, even if she couldn’t see, she could easily sense the unique sound and waves that accompanied his laughter. Because they were a couple who lived and shared their lives intimately.</p>
<p>You’ve been acting strange since last night.</p>
<p>What on earth is going on?</p>
<p>But she was too afraid to ask.</p>
<p>In the end, she lowered her head and dropped her arm. It’s nothing… The only sound that came from my vocal cords, which had been resting from moaning all night, was the sound of the wind.</p>
<p>Click, rattle. Soon, the door was locked. He used to say he’d be back every time. He would bid farewell warmly, but for some reason, she felt uneasy, even though he was as affectionate as usual.</p>
<p>No…! Let’s not worry.</p>
<p>Seoryeong shook her head vigorously. It’s not good to scrutinize and doubt every little thing, as her teacher had warned.</p>
<p>She moved her legs as if to shake off her persistent thoughts.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving… now.”</p>
<p>At that moment, beyond the thick iron door, his leisurely footsteps mingled with his voice.</p>
<p>Did I hear it wrong?</p>
<p>It’s not leaving for work; he’s leaving now?</p>
<p>Seoryeong furrowed her brows, blaming herself again. I probably misheard. She sighed.</p>
