            <p><strong>Chapter 7.2</strong></p>
<p>However, Wooshin was a bit different in this regard. Whether he knew someone for a day or ten years, he never showed affection to anyone.</p>
<p>Even to a woman he had lived intimately with, he wasn’t that cold. Watching him say he would kill even the captain he had known for ten years without hesitation sent a chill down his spine.</p>
<p>“The owl was just a target, and my role was to be her ‘husband,’ that’s all. Why dig into that annoying matter now that the absurd mission is finally over? Don’t look back, don’t bother.”</p>
<p>Wooshin scolded him as if he couldn’t fathom it at all.</p>
<p>“Did you get caught doing some nonsense with civilians? Is that why you’re acting like this, Wonchang?”</p>
<p>“No, no, sir!”</p>
<p>Ah, damn it, my mouth…! Wonchang smacked his own mouth.</p>
<p>“Then tell me why I should watch that video in three seconds.”</p>
<p>In a tone that startled him, Wonchang stammered, “Uh… well, you see…” before scratching the back of his head. He felt much more nervous facing his now cold superior than he had anticipated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as he counted backward from three, Wooshin suddenly burst into laughter. The playful tone in his voice was unmistakable.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me a place that trains agents without sex education? Have them enroll you. Since our Wonchang needs to grow up conscientiously and cleanly, right?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes, sir…!”</p>
<p>Ugh, this mouth…! Wonchang slapped his own mouth.</p>
<p>“Then tell me where they train agents without sex education. Have them enroll you. Since our Wonchang needs to grow up conscientiously and cleanly, right?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes, sir…!”</p>
<p>Ah, my mouth, mouth…! Wonchang smacked his own mouth.</p>
<p>“If you understood, don’t ever bring up the owl’s ‘father’ to me.”</p>
<p>The voice that had been mocking all along suddenly changed its tone.</p>
<p>“N…!”</p>
<p>At that moment, the communication abruptly cut off.</p>
<p>Wooshin must be in a pretty bad mood….</p>
<p><em>Maybe I acted too amateurish….</em></p>
<p>The agent who had carried out the mission didn’t harbor any regrets or attachments after everything was over.</p>
<p>Wonchang sighed deeply, leaning back in his chair after removing the receiver, feeling like blood would burst from his ears.</p>
<p>In the end, after exchanging a quiet farewell with the owl’s smiling face on the monitor, he turned off the monitor.</p>
<p>And so, the mission known as ‘Operation Birdbox,’ which had lasted for about two and a half years, came to an end.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The world seemed upside down.</p>
<p>Aligning the hips and shoulders in a straight line, putting strength at the tips of her toes, Seoryeong clung to the wall, maintaining a plank position while only glaring at the floor.</p>
<p>After vowing to definitely catch her husband, or rather, to be caught by him, Seoryeong’s first step was to recover from her injured body.</p>
<p>She diligently ate her meals, which she had skipped for days, and faithfully received treatment for her eyes. As a result, her vision had improved to the point where it was no longer a burden in everyday life.</p>
<p>“Phew… Phew….”</p>
<p>The evenly distributed weight on her arms felt comforting. It seemed like everything had finally returned to its place, and she could control her body the way she wanted.</p>
<p>“Ugh….!”</p>
<p>However, whenever the happiness of her marriage, which turned out to be just a set and someone’s cunning scheme, came to mind, her vision turned white again.</p>
<p>Collapsing into a slump, Seoryeong huddled on the floor. To her, that marriage was more real and unique than anything else.</p>
<p>“Kim Hyun… Kim Hyun…”</p>
<p>A groan-like sound escaped her lips.</p>
<p>Yet, every time she felt this pain, she clenched her teeth, stood up, and faced the wedding photo.</p>
<p>The photo she had proudly displayed, prepared for the wedding, and walked down the aisle with as if boasting—was now just an empty frame.</p>
<p>It was an empty frame because she had recovered her eyesight and noticed the traces of deception, especially with this large frame. It was just a frame with nothing inside, a pitiful prop.</p>
<p><em>What kind of expression did Kim Hyun have when he saw me happily receiving the frame without knowing anything?</em></p>
<p><em>Really… it’s not funny.</em></p>
<p>“Kim Hyun, you jerk.”</p>
<p>No matter how much she searched through her phone, the empty gallery was useless.</p>
<p>Even if she couldn’t see, she should have occasionally taken some pictures with her phone….</p>
<p>A wife who doesn’t know her husband’s face.</p>
<p>Yet, she’s determined to find him even without knowing his face.</p>
<p>Seoryeong felt overwhelmed by the frustration, but she didn’t want to give up here.</p>
<p>So, she began planning for the future.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Wanting counseling for a crime… What on earth does that mean?”</p>
<p>Channa’s sharp eyes, like an hawk, shook here and there as if encountering a typhoon. It was an afternoon on a day with exceptionally good weather, the sky was blue.</p>
<p>“I have no connections in this field at all.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong, who had no other choice, contacted Channa from the agency but first refused to help her.</p>
<p>Initially flustered when receiving the call, Channa soon asked how she was doing. Since Seo-ryeong’s case has caught her eye, she readily agreed meeting her. And…</p>
<p>“I went to survey around Paju Unification Bridge South Gate and Imjin River. I wanted advice on whether just bringing ramen, corn, and a raincoat would be enough. I found out that stealing a raft is a good idea. I’m also considering the area near Ganghwa-gun in Incheon.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…Yes?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to defect.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong stated with utmost dryness.</p>
<p>“Well, wait…! Are you saying you want to defect right now?”</p>
<p>“Yes. To North Korea”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Not downward, but upward. I mean going up. Ms. Channa. Through the bridge.”</p>
<p>Channa, who lost her words, pointed to the sky with a blank face. Her long pupils were dilated as if they couldn’t get any larger.</p>
<p>“Up, up? That way, up?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“…I knew it. You’re insane!”</p>
