            <p><strong>Chapter 37.1</strong></p>
<p>“What glory do I see in riding on the backs of limp-d*cked losers!</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Even if I have to crawl, I’ll just go on my feet.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin could suddenly feel a few sharp glances here and there, but he only smirked as he rested his elbows on the vehicle’s body.</p>
<p>His hair, blowing aimlessly in the cold wind, brushed against the bridge of his high nose.</p>
<p>“So, do you want to ride on the backs of those who couldn’t erect?”</p>
<p>“Is there such a thing here?”</p>
<p>Of course, why wouldn’t there be? Just look at how you all are acting!”</p>
<p>He kept on hurling taunts at the recruits who were struggling profusely.</p>
<p>“You keep that up, and you’ll lose it.”</p>
<p>“As long as you haven’t run ten miles away yet, you’re fine.”</p>
<p>Despite feeling like a lead weight, Seoryeong knew she would have to eat dinner last if she didn’t pick up her pace. Having already eaten lunch last, she reluctantly put more force on her knees that were about to give out.</p>
<p>By the time she ate last, most of the main side dishes had already disappeared, leaving only rice and kimchi.</p>
<p>But her teammates were already ahead of her, and Seoryeong was lagging. She thought the difference in stamina and physical condition would make up for it, but frustration churned in her stomach whenever she was left alone like this.</p>
<p>Barely making it back to the barracks, she collapsed against the soccer goal, breathing heavily. Gripping the pole tightly to steady herself as her legs shook violently, a surge of bile rose in her throat. No wonder curses were on the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p>Just then, an unwelcome shadow fell overhead, accompanied by slow, lazy footsteps.</p>
<p>“How many more times must you finish last before the bell rings, Han Seoryeong?”</p>
<p>“The training… has barely begun,” she muttered between labored breaths.</p>
<p>Seoryeong cleared her throat and straightened her back. She didn’t want to show any signs of weakness in front of this man. She held her head up steadfastly even though was almost a sweaty mess.</p>
<p>The track was set up with hurdles, but the first bell hadn’t rung yet.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a secret anymore that she hoped Seoryeong would voluntarily drop out before that starting signal. Every time that happened, she just chuckled.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin scolded the others for their attitudes and even publicly reprimanded them, but he also looked down on and belittled her more than anyone else.</p>
<p>As if to signal that he would only hit her if he had to, he would sneer at Seoryeong and then interrupt, saying that he would soon die of annoyance.</p>
<p>She was beginning to wonder why he hated her so much.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, do you have any faith in yourself?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Or do you just think that if you hold on stubbornly enough, things will somehow work out?”</p>
<p>“Well, um… it’s mostly determination,” she admitted, scratching her cheek. These were the very traits that made Wooshin suspicious of her.</p>
<p>“It’s not like your husband will come home because you’re struggling. So, are you trying to create a good excuse for self-pity in advance? I guess that would be useful, too.”</p>
<p>See, this guy is surprisingly on point… This guy sees right through her, even more than her husband, who was all meek and mushy.</p>
<p>I think that’s exactly what makes him so uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“But it’s easier than finding a husband without a plan.”</p>
<p>Enduring this was easy. Maybe it was one of the things Seoryeong could do best.</p>
<p>Maybe because they had exchanged harsh words before, now in front of Lee Wooshin, talk of her husband flowed effortlessly. It was quite convenient not to have to pretend every time.</p>
<p>After a brief moment of silence, she walked away. It was only one step; a groan escaped her lips as if flames had erupted beneath her feet.</p>
<p>Just hold out for two more months, just two months.</p>
<p>Seoryeong chewed on her lip.</p>
<p>If she wanted to reach the ears of Black Agent Kim Hyun, who could be anywhere right now, she’d have to be a difficult, elusive target for the NIS. To do that, she needs a special security team.</p>
<p>She wanted to be discovered while protecting an internationally renowned drug dealer, do the bad assignments alone, and make Kim Hyun chase after her.</p>
<p>Naturally, CEO Kang Taegon came to mind.</p>
<p>Just complete the training somehow. Yes… there was a look in his eyes that said he would take care of the rest somehow.</p>
<p>Seoryeong resolved herself.</p>
