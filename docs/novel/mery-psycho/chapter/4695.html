            <p><strong>Chapter 100.2</strong></p>
<p>She undid the latch and tossed him a bored goodnight. His eyelids twitched. He let out a frustrated breath, then suddenly removed the single contact lens he still wore.</p>
<p>With each blink, his bare gray eyes flashed, making her pause with an eerie sense of unease. His dark, suppressed voice filled the silence.</p>
<p>“I, more than anyone, wish you could forget today. If possible, I’d shamelessly hope it gets replaced with a decent memory instead of something as horrible as this.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“But… not like this.”</p>
<p>His voice grew heavier with emotion, “How could I, on a day like today, do that with you? How much more of a lowlife would you make me?”</p>
<p>Seeing his usually composed face contort painfully affected her more than she expected.</p>
<p>Maybe because she’d exposed her worst self to him today? She wasn’t sure if the turmoil on his face was pity or something else.</p>
<p>She suppressed a flicker of shame and spoke, “A decent person isn’t what I need right now.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Who’s asking for gentle s*x? I want you to hurt me.”</p>
<p>She didn’t need kindness or softness. What she needed was pain.</p>
<p>Pain strong enough to counterbalance today’s shock, some brutal act to stamp out the part of herself that still clung to Kim Hyun’s skin.</p>
<p>Reading something fierce in her unyielding eyes, Wooshin dragged a rough hand down his face, frustration twisting his features.</p>
<p>“You really don’t know anything.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>It happened at the same time Lee Woo-shin kicked. Seoryeong’s legs buckled, and she suddenly knelt. Looking up, she saw Lee Wooshin smiling down at her.</p>
<p>“S*x is supposed to hurt.” He kindly corrected Seoryeong’s misunderstanding. Her lips moved in confusion, but no words came out due to the strange pressure. He spoke slowly, one syllable at a time, with a twisted smile.</p>
<p>“There’s no tenderness or anything. It’s originally about tearing into raw flesh.”</p>
<p>Lee Woo-shin grabbed her hand and started unbuckling his pants.</p>
<p>When Seoryeong instinctively recoiled her fingers and flailed, a sharp sting spread across the back of her hand with a slap. She was stunned.</p>
<p>“Stop talking nonsense and pull yourself together.”</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>“I guess your husband was half-hearted even when role-playing.”</p>
<p>He suddenly grabbed the back of her head and buried her face between his thighs. The still-unfastened buckle and the metallic zipper scratched her tender lips.</p>
<p>Her nose was rubbed and scraped against the stiff fabric that had been repeatedly soaked and dried. When he pulled down his black briefs, a blunt piece of flesh sprang out.</p>
<p>“Tell me, is this what you wanted?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>His voice growled ominously, and the fishy smell of flesh grew stronger. The smooth, hairless skin was slick, but the tattoos etched into it were menacing in a different way, making her squeeze her eyes shut.</p>
<p>She had no time to examine it closely. Even though she had somewhat prepared herself, her mind went blank when it actually happened.</p>
<p>“Open your mouth wider.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>She struggled, but the grip on her head didn’t loosen. She opened her mouth as wide as she could, and the strong smell of flesh invaded her lungs. The salty male scent made her feel nauseous.</p>
<p>But perhaps this uncomfortable and disgusting thing was exactly what she wanted.</p>
<p>“Swallow it all. Before I f*ck you.”</p>
<p>The swollen glans rubbed against the roof of her mouth. The root of her tongue flinched in surprise at the touch of hot, hard flesh. Even though it was only half erect, she could feel the ghastly veins on the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth wider, as if enduring a penance.</p>
<p>As she clumsily ran her tongue over the heavy flesh, a thick column of flesh burrowed into her throat at once. A muskly odor filled her mouth.</p>
<p>“…What a mess.”</p>
<p>His voice was sharp, annoyed—though it wasn’t clear who it was aimed at.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the tension broke. The pressure eased, and Seoryeong flicked her gaze upward, unsure. Was it her fault?</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin shielded his eyes with one arm and tilted his head back. His curled fist was white with bone.</p>
<p>He looked strangely devastated.</p>
