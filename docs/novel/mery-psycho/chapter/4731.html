        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 82.1</strong></p>
<p>The man casually sucked the blood from his fingertips and, without a second thought, dumped sugar and vinegar into the boiling soup.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?!”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to feed you my way, why?”</p>
<p>“Please leave me out of it. I have a refined and picky palate!”</p>
<p>“That’s because your fancy husband spoiled you, Han Seoryeong. How can a person always eat delicious food? From now on, you’re going to be eating combat rations with me on the streets. Consider this practice and just swallow it.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong, whose chin was held firmly, shook her head desperately. Lee Wooshin, holding a ladle, laughed and teased her.</p>
<p>“This is a problem. If you dislike everything that involves your mouth, what will you do?”</p>
<p>“–!</p>
<p>Suddenly, her body convulsed, and she spat out the food. The last thing she remembered was sitting on the sofa for a moment after eating that awful dinner.</p>
<p>The sound of clattering dishes seemed like her last memory, but now it was pitch dark.</p>
<p>When did she get to the bedroom? Just as she was about to get up, her half-open eyes still blurry with sleep, it happened.</p>
<p>“Sleep a bit more.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A heavy arm pulled her around the waist. The hand gripping her stomach was so hot it felt like it was searing her.</p>
<p>Who? Startled, she struggled, and in response, a low, groggy voice, much clearer than she expected, muttered in a half-asleep tone.</p>
<p>“Seoryeong, stop it.”</p>
<p>A chill ran through her ears.</p>
<p>What is this? Lee Wooshin’s voice, still thick with sleep, sounded deeper and rougher than usual as if it came from the depths of his throat.</p>
<p>And it sounded… quite similar to Kim Hyun’s.</p>
<p>Her heart began to race, and her spine tingled. Frozen, Seoryeong turned her head stiffly to examine Lee Wooshin’s face.</p>
<p>Even though she knew they were completely different people, her trembling hand instinctively reached toward the waistband of his pants. The moment her palm touched the front of his trousers—</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>With a fierce grip, he grabbed her hand as if to crush it. Though Lee Wooshin’s eyes remained closed, the heat and strength pulsing from his hand were intense.</p>
<p>In her panic, she tried to pull her hand back, but instead, her palm was pressed more firmly against the front of his pants. It felt as though something hot and rigid was about to pierce through her hand.</p>
<p>She couldn’t breathe for a moment. As she stood there dazed, a sharp voice sliced through the tension like cold water.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to figure out by waking someone up?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Want to compare it with your husband’s?”</p>
<p>In the darkness, she met his clear gaze. His gray irises were as sharp as ever, a color she hadn’t seen in a long time.</p>
<p>“Then you might as well.”</p>
<p>His voice was emotionless. The huskiness she had heard just moments ago seemed like a figment of her imagination, as Lee Wooshin quickly reverted to his usual self.</p>
<p>The bulge trapped in his pants was now straining as if it were about to burst. He casually undid his belt and pulled down the zipper.</p>
<p>The harsh sound made her shoulders flinch. She didn’t have the courage to look him in the eye.</p>
<p>“How far does being an accomplice go?” He asked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“How far does guilt bind two people together?”</p>
<p>It was impossible to tell if the look in his eyes was pure lust or something else, but ravenous greed lay coiled beneath his emotionless exterior like a hidden serpent.</p>
<p>“How bad do you want to be with me?”</p>
<p>He painfully gripped her hand, pulling it inside his shirt. It was Lee Wooshin’s strength at work. He pressed Seoryeong’s wrist against his collarbone. His solid collarbone stretched long and straight, connecting to the clavicle.</p>
<p>After forcing her to trace that bone, his hand guided hers down to his chest. His firm, taut chest muscles seemed to cling to her palm like a magnet.</p>
<p>Thump, thump—the forceful beating of his heart brushed against her fingertips, and she felt a raised, stiffened peak beneath her hand. When she instinctively recoiled her fingers, his grip on her wrist only tightened, as if scolding her. Her skin throbbed with pain.</p>
<p>“Does it bother you, having a strange man walking around in your house? I’ve noticed you sometimes look at me like you’re trying to figure something out. Do you think of your husband at those times?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“When I’m loitering around your home, do I remind you of him?”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin smirked at her frozen reaction. He continued to toy with her hand, rubbing it in circles over his chest and nipples, before deliberately pressing her nails into his skin.</p>
<p>“When I move, your eyes follow me, like they’re starving. You don’t need to know what expression you’re making, but if you show that face somewhere else.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Her wrist hurt, but Lee Wooshin merely blinked slowly, unfazed.</p>
<p>“If you make a mistake, you’ll get your ass handed to you, Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“So just touch me here all you want and realize it quickly.”</p>
<p>His hand dragged hers even lower. He forcefully pressed her delicate palm against his rough abs, moving it over the hard, uneven ridges. Her fingertips, as hot as match heads, slid over his firm muscles.</p>
