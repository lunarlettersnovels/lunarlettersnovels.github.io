            <p><strong>Chapter 36.2</strong></p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s eyes swept over the stony faces of each of his men, but he didn’t give the slightest glance to Seong Wookchan, who had been called upon so bluntly.</p>
<p>“If there’s anything happens that should happen with you and Han Seoryeong, it’s a stabbing, nothing else.”</p>
<p>It was a clear indication that he permits Han Seoryeong to defend herself from the men.</p>
<p>Seoryeong looked at his broad back and secretly bit her lip.</p>
<p>One moment, he’s rudely intruding, and the next, he’s clearing out the impure, chaotic atmosphere in the living quarters with the same skill.</p>
<p>Every aspect of that man was irritating. Particularly his ability to manipulate people so effortlessly.</p>
<p>His clear voice echoed through the room.</p>
<p>“Blast Agency traditionally divides its work between land and maritime security, so I want you to make sure you’re working on your basic skills and physical fitness during this training.”</p>
<p>He sounded like he was about to wave them off. Lee Wooshin stood at the door with a casual step, as if his business here was done.</p>
<p>He grabbed the doorknob and turned it.</p>
<p>“Harassment, as some may know…”</p>
<p>A few of the men flinched at the words and immediately reacted. Upon closer inspection, their faces were rapidly turning ashen.</p>
<p>The two soldiers next to him were talking quietly, “Special Forces’ harassment training…” Seoryeong read their mouths.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin smiled as sweetly as ever and confessed.</p>
<p>“Just keep that in mind. The more valuable the member, the less I let them off easily.”</p>
<p>His eyes, folded in half, looked deeply into Seoryeong’s.</p>
<p>At that moment, she realized it as an implicit warning of what would happen if she faltered.</p>
<p>“If you ever want to quit, just ring the bell in the sergeant’s office and leave.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s gaze remained steadfast.</p>
<p>“You’re not some conscripted recruit or a runaway to be put in a detention cell if you flee. For the remarkable ones who have come this far, even I can’t stop them by force, can I?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong swallowed the subtle mockery directed at her, while inwardly sharpening her resolve.</p>
<p>Even if there came a moment she truly couldn’t bear it, she had to endure while facing that guy. She would never, ever let things go the way Lee Wooshin wanted.</p>
<p>Seoryeong clenched her teeth once more.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Darn it,” Seoryeong muttered countless curses silently.</p>
<p>Day one of Blast Agency training.</p>
<p><em>“Huff… huff…”</em></p>
<p>It was a three-kilometre run. As she gasped for air, she tasted blood in her throat.</p>
<p>The unfamiliar military boots she wore already made her heels sore, and her lungs felt as if they were being crushed.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin sat on top of the vehicle leading the recruits,without any safety gear, resting his chin on his hand as if bored.</p>
<p>He spewed a stream of verbally abusive words at the men, who were on the verge of gasping for breath.</p>
<p>“What did we do to deserve a boiled pig already?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“How many kilometres did you run at most?”</p>
<p>He sneered at the recruits, drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to be stumbling around like this, you should be doing ballet at the local academy, not running!”</p>
<p>He yelled in a low voice, slamming his fist against the body of the car.</p>
<p>As the actual training began, Lee Wooshin dropped his usual courteous demeanour. He deliberately undermined the recruits’ confidence, attacked their self-esteem, and didn’t hesitate to launch personal attacks.</p>
<p>“From now on, follow the instructor’s lead. I am an inadequate waste!”</p>
<p>Indeed… What was more unbearable than the physical strain was his disdainful gaze and his insults.</p>
<p><strong>“I am a waste!”</strong></p>
<p>“Put more strength into it, and shout louder.” Lee Wooshin ordered.</p>
<p><strong>“I am a waste!”</strong></p>
<p>“Are all the limp-d*cked losers gathered here? Why are there so many brainless idiots…!”</p>
<p><strong>“I’m just a shivering, useless piece of garbage!”</strong></p>
<p>As the recruits cursed vehemently, Lee Wooshin grinned broadly. “That’s right, you’ll never forget that self-introduction.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin deliberately undermined their sense of efficacy, stroked their egos, and made personal attacks.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he would crush their mental strength first with his fierce insults, and then turn the tables, and some of them would fall before him.</p>
<p>“What the hell did their parents do? Weren’t they criticized before?” Seoryeong wondered. “They all act like their Achilles’ heel has been cut off.”</p>
<p>From Seoryeong’s perspective, it was utterly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin’s gaze flickered to Seoryeong, who was dragging her army boots and barely keeping up with the procession. Lee Wooshin’s gaunt face was obscured by the bright red loudspeaker.</p>
<p>“Han Seoryeong, are your boots are too big?”</p>
<p>“No…!”<br>
“If you’re tired, stop. There’s no shortage of men here to carry you.”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s temples tightened. At first listen, it might sound affectionate, but it was nothing short of humiliating.</p>
<p>Flushed with frustration, she squeezed out a dry response while her throat felt like it was being wrung dry. Her unfamiliar military boots were already causing blisters on her heels, and her lungs felt like they were about to burst.</p>
