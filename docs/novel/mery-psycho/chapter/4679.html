            <p><strong>Chapter 109.1</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong idly squeezed and released the grip strengthener in her office. Each time the closed door creaked open, she glanced up, only to lock eyes with whoever entered.</p>
<p>Though familiar, none of the faces were the one she was waiting for, and she scratched the back of her neck in mild frustration.</p>
<p>Whenever she awkwardly dipped her head in greeting, she was invariably met with teasing remarks about her appearance.</p>
<p>“You look like you haven’t slept at all,” Ki Taemin muttered as he passed, biting into an apple.</p>
<p>The red, splotchy marks scattered across her body suddenly itched unbearably.</p>
<p>This morning, she had arrived at work alongside Lee Wooshin, her hair still damp from not drying it properly.</p>
<p>He had handed her a fresh towel from the back seat, and she had turned on the heater. The effortless synchronization between them felt so natural she didn’t even question it.</p>
<p>Wooshin had suggested she take sick leave, but lying around didn’t seem like it would help her sore muscles.</p>
<p>Besides, admitting defeat over something as trivial as s*x didn’t sit well with her pride as a field agent.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s emotional collapse had been humiliating enough. She preferred to keep moving forward and focus on what lay ahead.</p>
<p>Seoryeong’s hand trembled as she tightly clenched the grip strengthener. Just thinking about Deputy Chief Joo Seolheon made her teeth grind, fueling her desire to throw herself into work.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Agent Han Seoryeong…”</p>
<p>Jin Hojae approached with a serious expression, glancing around before speaking.</p>
<p>“I overheard something strange on my way up here.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“It didn’t quite make sense.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong paused her exercise and looked at him. Hojae tilted his head, his expression peculiar.</p>
<p>“Someone claimed to have seen you at the Grand Hotel.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I told them not to spread nonsense about our special ops team, but they swore up and down, practically foaming at the mouth, that it was true.”</p>
<p>From the couch, Ki Taemin muttered, “That guy must be crazy.”</p>
<p>“No one could easily mistake Agent Han Seoryeong’s face. Do you know anything about this?” Hojae asked, curious.</p>
<p>Feigning innocence, Seoryeong widened her eyes and shook her head. Hojae, leaning in closer, swallowed hard as if to say something, but the office door suddenly swung open, and Lee Wooshin entered.</p>
<p>The team, scattered around the room, instinctively gathered. Seoryeong quickly set the grip strengthener aside and straightened her posture.</p>
<p>Wooshin strode in, his face stony, glancing briefly at Seoryeong and Hojae before moving past them. His hand bore bruises, with several knuckles scraped raw, suggesting he had been in a fight.</p>
<p>Sensing the tension in his demeanor, the team exchanged uneasy looks.</p>
<p>“Team Leader, what happened?” someone asked cautiously.</p>
<p>Without addressing the question, Wooshin checked his watch and gave orders in a detached tone.</p>
<p>“You have one hour. Pack your gear.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Seoryeong glanced around in surprise, but the others quickly shifted into action as though this were routine.</p>
<p>“A high-priority mission has come in. I’ll explain the details en route. Agent Yoo Dawit, handle the equipment prep. Agent Ki Taemin, arrange firearms on-site and confirm supplier routes. Agent Jin Hojae, wake up He Channa and establish GPS and communication links for the Sakhalin monastery. Help the rookie pack—no, I’ll handle that myself. Everyone, gather in one hour.”</p>
<p>As Wooshin rattled off instructions, his gaze briefly lingered on Seoryeong, cold and unreadable, before he turned away.</p>
<p>The team abandoned what they were doing and moved with precision, quickly leaving the room.</p>
<p>The moment they were gone, Seoryeong felt her wrist seized and her body yanked forward. In an instant, her temple collided with a broad, firm chest.</p>
<p>Wooshin pulled her into a tight embrace, burying his face against her neck.</p>
<p>“Team Leader, what are you—”</p>
<p>“Promise me you won’t leave my side.” Hot breaths brushed against her skin as he let out a long sigh, as though finally able to breathe again.</p>
<p>Seoryeong, unsure of what was happening, lightly patted his back with little effort. A faint chuckle escaped him, landing against her collarbone.</p>
<p>“Agent Han Seoryeong, this is essentially your first real mission, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You won’t perform even a quarter as well as you did in training. The chances of making mistakes are high, and the risk of injury even higher. That’s why, for this mission, I’ve decided to personally guide you. If you have any objections, speak up now.”</p>
<p>“No, I understand. Thank you for your consideration,” she replied, nodding as she tapped his arm, signaling for him to let go.</p>
<p>Instead, he ignored her entirely, burying his head deeper against her. His strong arms wrapped around her waist like roots, tightening so much she thought her ribs might crack.</p>
<p>“I wish you hadn’t seen anything, though I think I understand why,” he murmured, almost to himself.</p>
<p>“What?” she asked, confused by his fragmented words, but he didn’t respond.</p>
<p>Instead, he pressed his sharp nose insistently against the curve of her shoulder.</p>
