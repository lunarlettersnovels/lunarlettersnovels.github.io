            <p><strong>Chapter 27.2</strong></p>
<p>For a moment, the ceiling looked too white to be real. So, for a brief moment, she almost mistakenly thought this was heaven.</p>
<p>Feeling drained just from the disordered flow of thoughts, she found herself staring blankly at the ceiling when suddenly, the door to the hospital room opened.</p>
<p>A man in a suit entered as if he owned the place, and then his eyes met Seoryeong’s, who was wide awake.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>As she looked at Lee Wooshin’s sharply defined nose, Seoryeong remembered everything she had forgotten.</p>
<p>She tried to sit up abruptly, but a pain like an electric shock pierced through her right arm.</p>
<p>It felt like being pricked and stung all over, as if a heavy cargo truck had passed over her arm. Her face involuntarily scrunched up from the inexplicable pain.</p>
<p>“Ugh….”</p>
<p>“Oh, seems like it hurts a lot.”</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin smirked, putting both hands deep in his trouser pockets.</p>
<p>“Nice. I’ve been waiting to see that expression on your face. I wanted to enjoy the sight of you squirming in pain.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong looked at him with a bewildered expression, wondering whether to take his words as honesty or start an argument right then and there.</p>
<p>“What kind of talk is that?”</p>
<p>“Then, since my right arm is useless but I’m not dead, can I at least get some praise for that?”</p>
<p>Even if she didn’t know, it was evident that the man’s judgment was severely twisted at the moment.</p>
<p>His smirk while assessing her with a mocking tone, leaning on his thin legs, made the situation even more twisted.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, who had been eyeing her for a moment, slumped into a nearby chair and loosened his tie. Fatigue dripped from his face.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you have a lot of questions. Where do you want to start?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong immediately thought of the short-haired girl’s face, but she couldn’t bring herself to speak. The warmth and stickiness she had felt on her fingertips were still there.</p>
<p>Though it was hard to gauge his expression, Lee Wooshinturned his head and briefly licked his lips.</p>
<p>“Han Channa is in the ICU right now.”</p>
<p>“….Is she alive?”</p>
<p>She clenched the sheet in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Yes, she’s alive, but she’s still unconscious.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“We performed emergency surgery right at the scene in Thailand. But the bleeding was worse than we expected, and she went through some critical moments. Her heart even stopped once.”</p>
<p>“You also underwent surgery on that arm. She kept waking up and falling asleep due to anesthesia and painkillers. As soon as the surgery was finished, they transferred her to Korea, and it’s already been a week.”</p>
<p>He explained briefly in a monotone voice. Seoryeong nodded stiffly.</p>
<p>Lee Wooshin, who had sprawled across the chair, pressed his nose firmly and covered one eye with his hand. Ignoring Seoryeong’s unseen reaction, he continued.</p>
<p>“Due to the recoil, your wrist ligament tore, and your fingers swelled, so they had to bandage them for a while.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“It’ll probably be quite uncomfortable for her in her daily life until it heals.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Is there anyone who will take care of her at home?”</p>
<p>Seoryeong couldn’t answer immediately due to the surging pain, and Lee Wooshin silently observed her.</p>
<p>“Are you certain you have a husband?”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“He’s not on your family registry, not listed as an emergency contact, and he hasn’t even come to see his injured wife. I wonder if he’s really your husband.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong remained silent. She didn’t feel the need to indulge the reasons why her husband seemed imaginary.</p>
<p>Frustrated at her silence, Lee Wooshin tugged at his tie and continued,</p>
<p>“The doctor said you even got bruised gums, and recommended you stick to soft foods for a while. He said you might feel like crying every time you chew. It’s not your lips are torn or her jaw is injured, so what on earth did you stuff in your mouth to get those bruises?”</p>
<p>“Ah… that.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong ran her tongue along her gums and felt a tingling sensation.</p>
<p>“What was that called? Slide-something, or, anyway, it was hard to pull the trigger with one hand. So…”</p>
<p>While Seoryeong spoke nonchalantly, he nervously adjusted his sleeve. He straightened his posture from its lax position, sharply focusing on her as if puzzled or astounded, his furrowed brow twitching strangely.</p>
