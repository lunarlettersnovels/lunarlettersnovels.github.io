            <p><strong>Chapter 52.1</strong></p>
<p>“I’m really feeling better.”</p>
<p>Seoryeong steadied her legs, which seemed to be trembling at any moment, and casually expressed her emotions.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Was it a bathhouse you went to instead of a torture chamber?”</p>
<p>“I think she finally lost it.” Now, they looked at Seoryeong as if she were some strange creature.</p>
<p>“You didn’t wake up to torture…”</p>
<p>“I woke up, but not from torture.”</p>
<p>She secretly lifted and lowered the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>Forcibly, as her body loosened, what she unexpectedly discovered was a completely new path.</p>
<p>Why hadn’t I thought of this before? Trapped in the shackles of married womanhood, I’d been clinging to a stereotype.</p>
<p>If there was one sure factor to identify her husband, it was his unique genitalia!</p>
<p>She was certain of Kim Hyun’s voice, height, skin texture, and the rough facial features she touched with her fingertips.</p>
<p>Add to that the rare genital shape. Perhaps a person narrowed down to Kim Hyun might appear.</p>
<p>Her heart began to race after a long time.</p>
<p>Although she had prepared herself to be caught since there was no way to find him, it seemed like a good idea to make a list of potential husband candidates.</p>
<p>If going all the way was too difficult, just being able to touch would be enough…</p>
<p>While her mind was filled with thoughts of Kim Hyun’s genitalia, they suddenly arrived at the cafeteria.</p>
<p>It was always bustling like a zoo at meal times, but when they actually arrived, the indoor space was empty due to the missing recruits before and after the training.</p>
<p>Recruits, holding their trays, sat down at their seats and lifted their utensils energetically. Except for a few spoonfuls, they didn’t do much else. Instead, they began to talk about their experiences.</p>
<p>“I was hanging upside down and my face was submerged in the water…. Oh, my… my nose still hurts….”</p>
<p>“How the hell am I going to kick that asshole instructor’s ass, I’ve been thinking about this the whole time?”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to do this training again, are you?”</p>
<p>At that moment, the guy who had been absentmindedly touching the edge of the table suddenly spoke up.</p>
<p>“My training was weird. Lee Wooshin was suddenly replaced by a new instructor.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s gazes were drawn to the sullen tone of his voice.</p>
<p>“…I was just being interrogated normally by this new instructor. Suddenly, while talking about my family, they said if I didn’t give them the coordinates, someone else would get hurt instead of me. They even showed pictures of my little sister.”</p>
<p>…!”</p>
<p>He nervously chewed on his nails, his voice tinged with unease.</p>
<p>“T–the door suddenly burst open like it was going to break!”</p>
<p>He swallowed hard, his dazed eyes trembling.</p>
<p>“Instructor Lee Wooshin walked in.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing his name, Han Seoryeong paid her full attention to the trainee speaking.</p>
<p>The table fell silent. Seoryeong’s gaze shifted to the man who had been silently picking at his cutlery, shuddering at the thought of his experience.</p>
<p>The men swallowed hard and asked questions.</p>
<p>“So, did you get hit?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was hit, but it wasn’t me who got–”</p>
<p>“But considering it was from Instructor Lee Woo-shin, the size of your bruise is small.”</p>
<p>“Th-this bruise? I just fell backward by myself and hit the floor! Honestly, I still don’t really understand. What happened and how it happened!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he gasped for breath and grabbed his clothes nervously.</p>
<p>“Why did he act like that? What’s wrong with him!”</p>
<p>As the impatient ones got irritated, a dam burst and the words that had been held back poured out from the trainee.</p>
<p>“Instructor Lee Wooshin came in smiling kindly and said we had to conduct intense interrogation, asked why we were staring at each other, and suddenly beat the instructor I was in charge of like crazy! He said if I had to reveal information and then if I talked too quickly in real torture situations, it would be the responsibility of this instructor who couldn’t train me properly.”</p>
<p>“–he kept laughing and stepping on the new instructor as if he was crazy, and even when the sound of bones breaking like wood splitting could be heard, he didn’t even blink an eye, hitting him with a chair!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Wh- when I looked at that, I felt like crying and shouted that I would say everything, but our instructor told me not to speak and to endure more! B-because I didn’t speak. I should have just revealed the coordinates but I couldn’t judge whether to speak or not!”</p>
<p>“What should Ihave done? Has the instructor lost his mind?” someone muttered quietly.</p>
