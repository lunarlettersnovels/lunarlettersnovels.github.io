            <p><strong>Chapter 154.1</strong></p>
<p>From that day on, her indigestion worsened, and she lived off antacids. She desperately wanted to ask Damon, What’s the name of the child I gave birth to? Is that child also being dragged into those horrific performances? But the hypocrisy of that thought made her laugh sharply at herself.</p>
<p>It wasn’t her child. Just another part of the mission. No different from assembling a wiretap and planting it in enemy territory… She repeated it to herself every night, eyes shut tight.</p>
<p>Her husband worried about her constant indigestion, but Joo Seol-heon couldn’t bring herself to complain. Whenever she remembered the bear-like soles of those children’s feet, no words of weakness escaped her lips.</p>
<p>Clutching her stomach, she forced herself to focus only on the glorious position she would soon claim.</p>
<p>I’ve secured every promise from the CIA…</p>
<p>‘That’s something only a ruthless agent. No, only I can do.’</p>
<p>Her temples throbbed as cold sweat dripped down her forehead.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>Still for the first time, she wanted to call out to God.<br>
If I follow Your traces, will I really find the right answer?</p>
<p>Entering her husband’s room, she flipped open Rigay’s worn Bible. The echoes of jeers and applause seemed to rise from its pages.</p>
<p>Gritting her teeth, she tore out the pages one by one before suddenly hurling the book onto the desk.<br>
CRASH!<br>
The sound of shattering objects split the dawn.</p>
<p>‘What kind of God is He to allow someone like me to still breathe.</p>
<p>You’re a fake.<br>
Your very existence is an illusion.’</p>
<p>She glared at her own reflection in the cross.</p>
<p>“Rigay Victor has finally succeeded, it seems.”</p>
<p>Over the years, she had grown drastically thinner. Even Agent Damon frowned every time he saw the sharp angles of her cheeks.</p>
<p>And that absurd thesis, did he actually complete it?<br>
The fact that he had developed injections to stimulate the amygdala was shocking enough, but he had gone even further. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>If true, the world would change entirely. People would soon divide into those with brain chips and those without. The day humanity could be fully controlled wasn’t far off.</p>
<p>And with that, the Russian military would hold the lives of third-generation Koreans scattered across Asia at the flick of a switch. He was the one accelerating this terrifying future.</p>
<p>“Rigay’s research will flow straight to Russia. No matter how much he loves his wife, it seems even he couldn’t defeat God. Cults are truly frightening, aren’t they, Zoya?”</p>
<p>Damon held out an envelope containing something hard. The moment her fingertips touched it, she knew a Glock 17 pistol.</p>
<p>Only one thought crossed her mind: It’s here.<br>
‘I want to leave Russia.<br>
I want to end everything.’<br>
Joo Seolheon nodded expressionlessly.</p>
<p>The house was now densely packed with the small, delicate plants she had begun collecting, filling the balcony and living room.</p>
<p>Seolheon stared blankly at them before yanking them out by the roots and stuffing them into a trash bag.</p>
<p>She cleaned the house as usual, then cooked her husband’s favorite meal.</p>
<p>When Rigay returned, they sat across from each other at the table, exchanging mundane small talk. As he set down his chopsticks, having complimented the food and even taken a second helping, she reached for the gun taped beneath the table and loaded it.</p>
<p>Click!<br>
A single, ordinary evening.</p>
<p>“Zoya?”</p>
<p>One shot. Just one is enough.<br>
Her grip tightened. Rigay’s pupils trembled, lost, staring down the barrel.</p>
<p>A man who had taken her entire youth yet remained pitifully naive. No farewell was necessary. Her throat constricted, but an old, buried euphoria surged, she could finally return to Korea.</p>
<p>‘So one shot is enough.’</p>
<p>“I gave birth. Ten years ago.”</p>
<p>Seolheon’s eyes burned red as she adjusted her grip.</p>
<p>“Not a dead child. In truth, it cried loudly.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know the name. I don’t even know the face.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“All I know is that it was a girl.”</p>
<p>She hated how her lips trembled pathetically, so she forced them still. All she had to do was put a clean bullet right between her husband’s brows, but her mouth moved on its own.</p>
<p>Like a broken machine, she spilled her shame.</p>
<p>“Tell me. How… how do I find that child in Sakhalin?”</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Rigay, frozen in shock, dropped his glass. He staggered back, his trembling hand slipping on the table, sending a bowl crashing to the floor.</p>
<p>“I thought she’d grow up smart, just like you…”</p>
<p>“Zoya. What the hell is this?”</p>
<p>“I… I must have misjudged things.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“The child I gave birth to back then is in Sakhalin.”</p>
<p>Joo Seolheon squeezed her eyes shut and vomited out the rotten secret. Rigay turned deathly pale, as if he had just eaten human flesh.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand… You told me our child died, Zoya. So how, how can you say that child is in Sakhalin?”</p>
<p>When she didn’t answer, Rigay’s face hardened into something cold, something she had never seen before, and he shouted.</p>
<p>“Zoya, answer me properly!”</p>
