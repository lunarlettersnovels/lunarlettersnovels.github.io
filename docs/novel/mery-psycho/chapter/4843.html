            <p><strong>Chapter 24.2</strong></p>
<p>Seoryeong awoke in the dead of night.</p>
<p>It was the first time she had jolted awake so suddenly, without any prior indication. Even after rousing from her slumber, she found herself gazing at the ceiling, lost in thought.</p>
<p><em>Had I indulged in ramen too close to bedtime…? Could it be that snacking late and retiring past midnight rendered it excessively salty?</em></p>
<p>Her throat felt parched, her mouth dry.</p>
<p>Rising from her bed and glancing at the clock, she realized it was time for the team members who had ventured to the border to return.</p>
<p>In truth, despite labeling it a business trip, her life hardly deviated from her routine at headquarters.</p>
<p>Cleaning, cooking, and more cleaning – her days passed in a tedious cycle, and now the day to return to Korea loomed ahead, nearly upon her. With a sigh, she swung her legs over the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Then, for a moment, she sensed something strange.</p>
<p>What… was that?</p>
<p>Once again, she felt an inexplicable sense of unease.</p>
<p>Even though the walls of this old and shabby inn were thin, at night all sorts of noises could be heard.</p>
<p>Conversations in foreign languages, the sound of someone using the bathroom and flushing, the thumping of footsteps, and even the subtle sound of placing a cup on a table. All these various noises existed like one big atmosphere.</p>
<p><em>Why… can’t I hear any sound at all?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, by now, the employee in the next room should have been coughing and the noise from the classic movie should have been loud. It should have been like that.</p>
<p>But all the noise was completely gone.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Seoryeong absentmindedly rubbed her forearm and opened the door.</p>
<p><strong>Creak</strong>― The stiff latch sank coolly into the corridor. It was strangely quiet night.</p>
<p>Seoryeong wandered around, taking slow steps down the dimly lit corridor. Her gaze instinctively gravitated towards the driver’s room, which was slightly ajar.</p>
<p>Strangely, her mouth felt dry, and her heart pounded. As she reached out her arm to push the door, Seoryeong froze as if she had been doused in icy water.</p>
<p>“Uh… uh…”</p>
<p>Unconsciously, she pressed her lips tightly together, fearing that a scream might escape.</p>
<p>The once pristine white sheets she had laundered were now all soaked with a sickening red hue.</p>
<p>His  neck and forehead had been cut so deeply that only the handle of the dagger was visible. Blood was still trickling out.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>She forced her unmoving legs to shift and tentatively reached out her fingers to the employee’s nose.</p>
<p><em>What in the world… What in the world happened…</em></p>
<p>He was dead. The driver lay lifeless, soaked in blood, his eyes closed in eternal slumber.</p>
<p>Seoryeong, her face turning pale, stood motionless for a moment before exiting the room and retracing her steps towards the adjacent room she had casually passed by.</p>
<p>Her weakened steps gradually quickened. Without hesitation, she grabbed the latch of the neighboring room.</p>
<p>Her hand trembled slightly, but she clenched her teeth and pushed the door open. As she did, a putrid and horrifying stench assaulted her nostrils.</p>
<p>“No…!”</p>
<p><em>What is this, what in the world, no…!</em></p>
<p>The orderly, whose hair had lightened, lay dead on his stomach, a knife embedded in his back.</p>
<p>Blood gushed out uncontrollably, staining his lips and the floor red. There was so much blood that one wouldn’t know where to begin stopping it.</p>
<p>How could nobody have known anything while two people were dying?</p>
<p>Seoryeong wiped her moist hands over her face. She regulated her erratic breathing and scanned the room.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>There was no trace of a struggle in the room.</p>
<p>So they died without a scream. They died instantly, with a fatal stab that didn’t allow them to even make a sound.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>At this critical moment, who made them let their guard down?</p>
<p>Her gaze suddenly fixed on one side of the wall.</p>
<p>Just a moment… then next… the next room…</p>
<p>“Channa…!”</p>
<p>A hot surge of something rose within her.</p>
<p>It was none other than Channa’s room.</p>
<p>As Seoryeong collapsed to her knees and rose back up, the sight of the dead orderly’s ear caught her eye.</p>
<p>There, in his ear, was a black wireless earpiece. The device, no bigger than a thumbnail, was soaked in blood, as if he had tried to do something with it until the end.</p>
<p>Seoryeong took it from the dead man and inserted it into her own ear. But she had no idea how to make it work.</p>
<p>She tried tapping and pressing it as best as she could and then dashed straight to Channa’s room. Please… please…!</p>
<p>As she flung open Channa’s door, she heard a slow and familiar voice.</p>
