            <p><strong>Chapter 161.1</strong></p>
<p>Finally, today, she was marrying Kim Hyun, her ex-husband, for the second time.</p>
<p>From the morning, Seoryeong finished bathing in the warm tub and sat in the powder room to begin getting ready.</p>
<p>Wearing only a figure-hugging slip, her face was cool and expressionless as she brushed her long hair. She concealed her razor-sharp thoughts and mechanically ran the brush through her hair.</p>
<p>Thud, thud. At the sound of polished dress shoes, she glanced into the mirror and saw Wooshin standing there in a tuxedo, holding a white peony. Without a word, he approached, handed her the flower, and took the brush from her.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“The bouquet I mentioned. I told you I would pick it up from the airport.”</p>
<p>“It hasn’t wilted?”</p>
<p>She looked at the lush flower in surprise. She had only vaguely heard that snow-white peonies were the most preferred bridal bouquet, but seeing it now, it really was beautiful.</p>
<p>She didn’t know who had prepared it, but it crossed her mind that Wooshin had been surprisingly meticulous. Most men who were always out and about tended to neglect domestic matters, but he was oddly attentive in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Seoryeong pressed her nose to the peony and inhaled its scent. Then, warm lips touched the top of her head.</p>
<p>“Can I help you into your dress?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“To me, a wedding is that kind of ceremony. Standing before everyone and swearing that I’ll only sleep with this woman for the rest of my life. Declaring that I’m the only one allowed to touch the hem of Han Seoryeong’s skirt from now on.”</p>
<p>“What, ”</p>
<p>“So, before I take it off, I should be the one to put it on you. Hold onto my shoulders.”</p>
<p>He bent down so she could easily step into the dress. Seoryeong, caught off guard, lifted her leg and followed his lead without resistance.</p>
<p>The zipper went up, and his lips touched the back of her head once more. It was just the two of them at this wedding anyway, far too late for formalities now.</p>
<p>Wooshin gathered her long hair over one shoulder and swept his hand down her exposed nape.</p>
<p>Seoryeong flinched but didn’t pull away. Soon, the dress, falling gracefully to her ankles, wrapped perfectly around her body. Her reflection in the mirror looked elegant and lovely.</p>
<p>“Seoryeong.”</p>
<p>A large hand interlaced with hers at her waist.</p>
<p>“When are we going to have a pretty baby that looks like you?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her neck stiffened. She needed to control her expression, she was supposed to look like the happiest, most bashful bride in the world, but her eyelids trembled at his unexpected words.</p>
<p>Wooshin stared straight at her through the mirror. She couldn’t read him at all.</p>
<p>“…A baby?”</p>
<p>“Well, if you don’t want to, I’ll carry it.”</p>
<p>“What, ”</p>
<p>The absurdity made her face relax for a moment. But then she met his deadly serious eyes, and her chest grew cold.</p>
<p>“When you’re constantly moving through war zones, you stop wanting a family. ‘Better dead than alive’, I’ve seen countless husbands and fathers scream that, thinking of the wives and children they left behind. I got sick of it. So I never wanted a family. Never needed one.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But then you, Han Seoryeong…”</p>
<p>He stared at their perfect bride-and-groom reflections before bowing his head. His burning forehead pressed firmly against her shoulder, his grip on her waist almost painfully tight.</p>
<p>“You make me want to stake my life on something again.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“You make me want to protect you, even if it costs me everything.”</p>
<p>Thick veins bulged in his stubbornly clasped hands.</p>
<p>“So now I even want to bring a child who looks like you into this world.”</p>
<p>His quiet voice wavered slightly.</p>
<p>“Just the fact that it’s yours would make this goddamn world seem a little better. I’d want to show that child your face, your smile, your scent. Maybe I just want to brag, ‘This was the world I got to live in.’”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“No hardship, no suffering, I’ll protect our little family.”</p>
<p>He furrowed his reddened nose and hid his face again. But it was too late, his crumbling expression had already been exposed. The scorching breath against the nape of her neck burned like molten metal.</p>
<p>She needed to lull him into carelessness. She couldn’t ruin this moment. Yet her lips moved on their own.</p>
<p>“What if it doesn’t happen, no matter how hard we try?”</p>
<p>I might just be the type who can’t get pregnant, Seoryeong thought. A body that had endured nothing but abuse, no healthy sprout could grow in such soil. Infertility, or worse…</p>
<p>She didn’t need a test to know. She had barely eaten properly as a child, and her first period had come embarrassingly late.</p>
<p>But even having this worry felt ridiculous. Soon, she had to leave this man’s side for good.</p>
<p>“Then you’ll just live as my baby forever,” Wooshin replied with a smirk, his tone teasing. “I’m fine with that.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
