            <p><strong>Chapter 173</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p><em>The ambition building up deep within my heart felt like they were crumbling all at once. </em>Anne fell to the ground. There was another downpour. Through the rain, Anne’s cries could be heard, but nobody was there to listen.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Even after three days, the rain was still pouring.</p>
<p>Water was a necessity for humans, but if they had more of it than necessary, it would be disastrous. The Lake of God overflowed. After filling up to the brim, it flowed along the rivers and caused a flood in the village.</p>
<p>“The villagers went to higher ground to take refuge.”</p>
<p>“What is the damage?”</p>
<p>“Although all the people took refuge, all of the livestock died, and all of the houses are flooded. Since the farmers will be rebuilding their farms, it looks as though there will be no more harvest.”</p>
<p>The Arpen Empire and the royalty in charge of the finances were deeply troubled. Not only did they lose their houses and livestock to the flood, but this disaster also dealt a huge amount of damage to the farmers rebuilding their farms.</p>
<p>“…It’s a relief that nobody died. Unlock the treasury to provide the supplies.”</p>
<p>“Yes, will do.”</p>
<p>As soon as the management left, Ivan started talking. “Very unfortunate rumours have been making rounds.”</p>
<p>“…Is it about the empress once again?”</p>
<p>“Yes, since the rumours are spiraling out of control, there are more and more people saying things that should be left unsaid.”</p>
<p>Ivan was becoming concerned. It was a matter of time before the whole continent found out that Viola was God’s Companion. Once the secret leaked, they started spreading to all the wrong people, and eventually, some of the subjects came out to pin the blame on her. All the efforts that she had put in to unite the Slovenia continent and lead them to peace were melting away like snow.</p>
<p>“While it is true that it is only human nature to ask for more the more they’re given things, this is going too far.”</p>
<p>“It is truly natural that humans would gladly swallow whatever is sweet while they spit out whatever is bitter. Particularly, unlike royalty, a disaster such as a flood to a peasant who struggles to make ends meet every day would be….”</p>
<p>He bit his tongue before speaking any further. Lustian looked deep in thought as he rested his chin on his hand.</p>
<p>God tossed the whole continent into complete chaos. After the kingdoms united, He continuously sent the Orcs over to prevent the allied armies from coming together, and due to the downpour over the course of four days, there was a flood in the Arpen Empire.</p>
<p>Lustian was troubled. Even if he could fight them off with a sword himself, he could not prevent a natural disaster.</p>
<p>“Even so, we have to participate soon. All we have to do is pray that nothing else happens in a week.”</p>
<p>“It’s too slow.”</p>
<p>Lustian furrowed his eyebrows. <em>If only the rain stopped at the very least…</em> He sighed watching the rain pour all night long.</p>
<p>“Princess Guinev is praying. I don’t know if He’ll listen to a chambermaid’s prayers, but I believe that it won’t be entirely ineffectual. After all, it isn’t only the God of Judith who exists in the New World.”</p>
<p>“…Could the empress have also been in the temple?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s no use to try to stop her.”</p>
<p>Lustian had numerous worries about Viola. She wasn’t even naked but he was burning up inside. He couldn’t even sleep the previous night, but he couldn’t stand to think that he was brought to the point of prayer. He took that road that led to the temple.</p>
<p>He met Paul in the hallway of the temple. There was darkness on the knight’s face. Seeing how he was looking around, it was apparent that Viola had also heard of the flood. Lustian clenched his fists.</p>
<p>Near the altar, of course, there was Viola next to Guinev reading the report. Lustian quickly went up to her and took the report from her.</p>
<p>“Please give it to me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t look at it.”</p>
<p>“Lune…. I also must know.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“This is a huge disaster that has befallen the subjects of the Arpen Empire. I must see and hear it for myself.”</p>
<p>Viola at once took the report from Lustian’s hands. Then, she read the rest of it and folded the parchment. She nibbled her lip.</p>
<p>“I’ll go.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I want to deliver the supplies and take care of the subjects that lost their homes.”</p>
<p>“Viola, you are not invulnerable. There are still all these rumours going around, so what do you intend to do when there’s a riot?”</p>
<p>“The disaster is all my fault, so I don’t think I could take it if I just relaxed even while knowing about this.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t your fault. This is because of the negotiations made with the previous Emperor.”</p>
<p>Lustian held a guilt-ridden Viola in his arms. He told her over and over that it wasn’t her fault. He could feel her whole body quaking. He felt the anger burning inside of him.</p>
<p>Just then, Guinev got up after finishing her prayer.</p>
<p>“I shall go with you.”</p>
<p>“…Guinev?”</p>
<p>“I am a chambermaid. Through the imperial family, I can help anyone who’s become a chambermaid to get closer to the gods. I shall continue to pray next to you. Then, I will present to the other gods the disasters that resulted from the God of Judith failing to keep the promises…”</p>
<p>Guinev fumbled around until she grabbed Viola’s hand. Looking at her, Viola smiled wryly. Even if she was cursed with blindness after coming to the empire, she was grateful to her for trying her best for the sake of the empire.</p>
<p>“You will be of immense help. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“No. I have a long way to go before I can repay you.”</p>
<p>“Lune… Give me permission.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Even though Viola and Guinev’s minds were already set, Lustian would not give them permission. Even if they were inside the same castle, he was hesitant to let them outside of the palace.</p>
<p>“I beg of you. I appreciate your concern for me, but I must unload at least a bit of all this baggage.”</p>
<p>“…Must you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Lustian sighed. “I ask that you take Paul, Kyle, and the royal knightage.”</p>
<p>“Yes! We will.”</p>
<p>“You will only serve during the day. When the sun goes down, you must return to the palace straight away.”</p>
<p>“I will make sure of that.”</p>
<p>At last, Viola received Lustian’s permission.</p>
