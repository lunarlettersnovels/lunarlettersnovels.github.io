            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 56 – Wanton Desire (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Lune attacked and precisely penetrated the sweet spots on her body. His huge m3mb3r was inserted all the way to the hilt and stirring around to his heart’s content. She was at her limits. She had white sparks dancing in front of her eyes and her body was being wrung out by the overwhelming ple@sur3.</p>
<p>“Good, right? Huh? Tell me, Viola…” he whispered into her ear, not sparing her even a moment’s breath.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah! Lune—”</p>
<p>“You’re my wife. Whatever I may have done, you… my wife… shouldn’t think about anything else….”</p>
<p>He shifted her position and put one of her feet on his shoulder letting his r0d p3n3trat3 deeper inside her. Liquid trickled out from where they were connected. The deep ins3rt!on made her stomach hot and wobbly.</p>
<p>She felt like she was going to die from the heat. The excitement made her mind go blank making her shake her head. Lune’s eyes shone even more intensely.</p>
<p>“Haaaa… Ahhhhh—”</p>
<p>Viola panted, unable to breathe properly. Lune ecstatically looked at her face that was distorted from the pleasure, then licked his lips.</p>
<p>Her vision was horribly shaky. She bit his shoulder trying to endure the pleasure, and yet deep within, she began to crave for the pleasure he gave her. She panted as she tilted her head slightly back. She was making l3wd noises on his shoulders with her legs spread wide open. The flaring hole in her body tightened as if it was trying to eat up his large engorged m@nh00d. He let out a satisfied laugh.</p>
<p>Her body flu!ds dripped down her throbbing thighs as she felt his hot s3m3n spout into her vigorously, spreading inside her body. She didn’t know how many times he had spurted the slimy substance inside her.</p>
<p>“Haa, ha….”</p>
<p>She felt a sweet and soft kiss fall on her lips, it was as sweet as melting sugar. He swallowed up her lips without rest. Before she knew it, her body grew languid; her mind, hazy.</p>
<p>Viola hugged his wide back, both their hearts racing. She was still suspicious of him but she felt a sense of stability from his body. She found it strange that she felt so moved and felt such strong joy spreading inside her heart.</p>
<p><em>No! No…! </em>She shook her head, struggled to open her eyes, and stared directly at Lune’s face. His expressions, lips to every single one of his actions pained and bothered her.</p>
<p>Why? Why did her heart hurt so much… She couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, Lune left the bedroom of the imperial villa and stood at the wall that connected to the crown prince’s palace. He chanted a short spell to connect it to his room and walked into his bedroom. However, he found an unexpected guest waiting there.</p>
<p>“Why are you here…?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting for you, brother. It seems like she really got my brother’s heart, seeing how I can smell the sweet scent of newlyweds off of you from all the way here.”</p>
<p>“You’re mistaken.”</p>
<p>“Mistaken? I can smell a lot of your l0vem@k!ng from you?” Ivan teased him mischievously. “By the way, isn’t it about time for Mother to start noticing? How long are you going to lie to her? The rumors have already begun to circulate.”</p>
<p>“She’ll find out soon enough.”</p>
<p>Lustian’s good mood was ruined. The empress had come looking for him when he had stopped by the stables. He couldn’t, no matter how hard he tried, hide the rumors that were circulating from one mouth to the other. Viola would eventually find out that he was the crown prince and she would be disappointed and hate him for lying to her… It seemed like she had already realized something was off seeing how she brought up the Blood Army earlier. She would eventually come closer and closer to the truth no matter how many times he blocked off the imperial villa.</p>
<p>Lustian ruffled his hair and sat on the sofa. Ivan came up to him with a grin on his face.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you a way out,” Ivan said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you make her a concubine if you can’t make her a crown princess?”</p>
<p>“You think I’ll send Viola to the h@rem with my own hands?” Lustian trembled at the thought. He could never send her to the h@rem to become a slave to the imperial family. He would cut off the hands and pull out the eyeballs of anyone who laid their hands on her.</p>
<p>“I’ll protect her so the others of the imperial family don’t touch her. Well, if she puts on makeup I’m sure none of the people in the imperial family would touch her anyway.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t let her catch Mother’s eyes. I believe you know better than anyone else what consequences that would bring.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>Lustian thought of his mother. He remembered the words that she constantly said and imprinted onto him since childhood.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Lustian, finish God’s duty with a single stroke. Don’t pay attention to concubines. Don’t have c0ncub!nes. Love only one person, make her the crown princess, and live happily ever after with her. Make sure to… you have to. You have to do that.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The Crown Princess…</em></p>
<p>He wanted to make Viola the crown princess. He didn’t want to let her go. He didn’t know since when, but he wanted to pour all his emotions into her.</p>
<p>However, she couldn’t be the crown princess. There were countless obstacles, right from the emperor and empress, down to the priests and nobles. If the most influential of them, the empress, opposed them, she would have no choice but to be a concubine. Lustian had to worry about Viola finding out his real identity but he had to worry about things after that as well.</p>
<p>Whether or not he knew Lustian’s troubles, Ivan kept persistently trying to persuade him from the side.</p>
<p>“The harem belongs to me anyway, as long as I control the place, the other imperial family members cannot touch the concubines without my permission.”</p>
<p>“Ivan—”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Get it right. The h@rem belongs to the crown prince, not to you.”</p>
<p>Lustian jumped up from his seat then stood in front of the magic wall towards the imperial Villa. He looked back at Ivan before he finished chanting the spell. A cryptic smile graced his lips before disappearing in a flash.</p>
