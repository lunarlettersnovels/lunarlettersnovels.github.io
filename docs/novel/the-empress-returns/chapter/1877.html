            <p><strong>Chapter 150</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>A few days passed since and the Empress of Arpen announced that she would be visiting each kingdom. The princesses that left to each kingdom send an official invitation and Viola accepted.</p>
<p>Viola got ready to get on the carriage. She was sad that she couldn’t bring Wendy, but the safest place for her daughter was by Lustian’s side. She hugged the little one before she left.</p>
<p>“Are you coming back soon?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. The day when the moon is round, I will be back. So listen to His Majesty well.”</p>
<p>“Ok!”</p>
<p>Wendy smiled widely and held the emperor’s hand. Lustian made the decision, but he frowned as he didn’t seem to like it.</p>
<p>“I’m going to you when it’s night, or else I wouldn’t have let you go.”</p>
<p>“Yes, ok. We can meet at night. Mhm….”</p>
<p>Viola was the one who could stop Lustian’s pain, that’s why she used magic so she could spend time with him at night. Using the power of the moon and magic, Lustian’s body could be transported riding the ring’s coordinate at night. Then, when the sun was up, he would return to the palace.</p>
<p>On Viola’s journey, there was another party that would be with her instead of Lustian and Wendy. Paul was coming as her bodyguard. And then there was Anne with her pout. She had thrown herself in the silver carriage behind the golden one.</p>
<p>“She seemed like she wanted to see the princesses too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that would be more relieving to me too.”</p>
<p>It seemed like she wasn’t the only one one an alert against Anne. She saw it in Lustian’s smile too. Viola also preferred that Anne wouldn’t be in the palace. The duchess complained as she didn’t like it, but someone who could take all the complaints from her also joined in on this journey- Ivan.</p>
<p>“Ivan will help you. Don’t worry about the palace and have safe travel.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll see you at night.”</p>
<p>Lustian kissed her lips for a long time. Many were watching but there was no embarrassment. When their lips parted, there was a thin silver line connecting them. Viola let go of his hands that didn’t want to let go and got on the carriage.</p>
<p>The carriage moved onward, strong, with its long tail trailing. As the castle gates opened and they entered the capital, people gathered and showered flowers as if they were wishing the empress’s first diplomatic event to be successful, there were more flowers than when Viola had returned to the Arpen Empire</p>
<p><em>‘…. You can do it. Viola, you are now the representative of the Emperor, not the Empress…’</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The first place they arrived at was the Kingdom of Ramond. All of the princesses were thankful to Viola, but it was Princess Ramond that didn’t want to say goodbye until the end. She showed her gratitude through her brother and the King of the Ramond also sent his own gratitude.</p>
<p>The moment her carriage arrived, she saw a familiar face. When she got off the carriage, the princess ran and grabbed Viola’s hands vigorously.</p>
<p>“Viola! No, Empress, welcome! I missed you so much!”</p>
<p>“I’ve missed you too.”</p>
<p>The princess was teary. Viola observed her clothes. Unlike the fancy dress before, she was wearing a rather plain dress, but it suited her complexion well making her seem pure.</p>
<p>“I want to speak with you alone. Please dismiss everyone.”</p>
<p>“Yes, ok.”</p>
<p>Anne looked over, but Viola wanted totalk with just the two of them around. She recounted the conversation she had with the crown prince and gave the princess a secret message given to her by the crown prince. The princess nodded and agreed to Viola’s proposition. She was happy that they were able to become Arpen Empire’s ally and that there would be no more war.</p>
<p>As the two of them came out, a knight of the royal family approached them.</p>
<p>“The king is waiting. This way.”</p>
<p>“Ok.”</p>
<p>Before attending the ball, she agreed to meet with the king and queen of Ramond. They didn’t come to greet them at the entrance, but when a large door opened, they seemed to be waiting for Viola’s party with many of the royals. They royals stood on either side like water being split. Then they bowed following the palace courtesy.</p>
<p>A nervous Viola gulped at the sight. Though they didn’t show hostility to her, their expressions weren’t exactly bright. Someone’s loved ones had been probably sacrificed in the war… someone perhaps lost their child, some other their father… Being trampled by the Army of Blood…..</p>
<p><em>You knew it wouldn’t be easy. Don’t be nervous.</em></p>
<p>It was hard to be allies with each other as this was a separate matter of being in favour of the princess of the Kingdom of Ramond. Especially, for the vassal state that had to send their princesses for an arranged marriage for the past two centuries.</p>
