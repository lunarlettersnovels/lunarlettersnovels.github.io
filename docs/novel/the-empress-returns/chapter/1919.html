            <p><strong>Chapter 45 – Bewitched | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Namita Suberi, Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Viola’s head arched towards the sky as she grasped Lune’s hair between her ch3st. The tips of her toes were tingling, her whole body was filled with heat. She could feel the moans threatening to escape her mouth, so she bit her lips. His fingers entered her, and she gasped. “I need to prepare you to receive me, love,” he said.</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed. She couldn’t help but tighten around his fingers. His fingers thrust in and out, and it took all her effort not to scream in pleasure. She unconsciously clenched her th!ghs, but he pried them open and spread her legs gently. He then entered her slowly, making her gasp more.</p>
<p>“It will be easier this time,” he said soothingly, “It won’t hurt as much.”</p>
<p>He was right. It was easier this time, and sweeter. Instead of the searing pain that she had felt the first time, this time she was engulfed in pleasure. She could feel herself stretching around his engorged m@nhood almost beyond her limit.</p>
<p>“I will be gentle,” he assured her.</p>
<p>She was still resisting. But his kiss changed everything. It made her melt from within and she surrendered to his caresses.</p>
<p>“You don’t want the Crown Prince to notice, do you?” he asked huskily, “he thinks we are in love. We have to keep him convinced of it, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes…,” she whispered, barely able to form coherent words.</p>
<p>He kissed her passionately. His hot breath ran through her lips and her heart swelled up in ple@sure. They were covered in sweat, entwined with each other. He pulled her close so her legs were completely wrapped around his waist. He gently thrust inside her and she grabbed the sheets, withholding her m0@ns, which were threatening to burst out of her.</p>
<p>“Viola…,” he uttered her name as though it was the last remaining thing in this world.</p>
<p>He couldn’t hold back anymore. His thrusts became frantic, and he panted like an animal. She felt it to be most 0bsc3ne that they were making love in the middle of the day. But all her thoughts scattered as his thrusts became wild. Viola clenched her teeth, straining as he came with a m0@n.</p>
<p>The sheets were wet with their body fluids that flowed out of them without restraint. She had been biting her lips bloody to hold back her m0@ns. Lune offered her his forearm, which she bit with all her might. Their hot breaths filled the room. Still, he wasn’t done. He turned her over and held her tight to him by the waist. He kept pounding as he grabbed her peaks from the front. A m0@n escaped her lips, unable to hold it any longer. His thrust became hurried as they both came yet again. Her mind was a mess, the only thought that existed there was of Lune.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Lustian returned to the Crown Prince’s Palace after he was done with the sweet time he spent with Viola. Kyle saw him approach his room and clicked his tongue in annoyance as he saw his forearm. He brought some medicinal paste to spread it on his arm.</p>
<p>“Please have some restraint,” he said, “Why is it the same every time?”</p>
<p>Lustian grinned. “It is what it is.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness… this isn’t like you,” said Kyle, “I am relieved that you didn’t seek to avoid the last hurdle but you are always wounded.”</p>
<p>“Oh, stop worrying, will you?” said Lustian, smiling.</p>
<p>He had just left the Royal Villa, but now he wanted to run there again. She had bewitched him completely. He couldn’t keep her away from his mind at all. All throughout the day, she was all he could think about. He missed her so much the moment he was away from her. He wished he could win her heart. <em>You will come to love me, Viola, </em>he thought, unsure.</p>
<p>The concubines fell in love with Lustian in no time. Their hearts were his, given willingly out of love. The concubines in the harem would wait for him every time he stepped there, ready to give themselves to him. It had been the same during the time of the previous Emperor. He was never fond of this type of lifestyle. Even when the Crown Princess candidates were chosen, he was expected to spend the first night with them. He didn’t much like doing this, so he switched places with Ivan in the darkness and returned before morning. He had deceived the Emperor’s eyes in this manner and evaded the duties that he abhorred.</p>
<p>Lustian wished he could win Viola’s heart and she would fall hopelessly in love with him too. If she came to love him, she wouldn’t plead for a divorce to leave him when she found out that he was the Crown Prince.</p>
<p>He had lied to her. He didn’t know if she would forgive him.</p>
<p>“I have information from the border,” said Kyle, interrupting his thoughts, “They report that the number of Orcs has dropped significantly.”</p>
<p>“Since when?” asked Lustian.</p>
<p>“Supposedly since Princess Viola entered the Palace,” he said.</p>
<p>“Is it a trick by God?” asked Lustian.</p>
<p>“I think he is observing things at the moment,” said Kyle, “Either way, the punitive force can take a break for the next five months.”</p>
<p>God had always threatened Lustian by constantly sending Orcs to the border to force him to fulfil his duties. He would only stop when a new Crown Princess candidate entered the Royal Villa.</p>
