            <p><strong>Chapter 184</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Viola wrapped her arms around his shoulders. Just then, he laid her down on the long sofa.</p>
<p>He nibbled on her earlobes and put his tongue inside her ear and swirled it around. Her thighs shook on their own. His period of celibacy had been long, but Viola was also nervous because it had been a while since he’d penetrated her.</p>
<p>“Hah… Judith….”</p>
<p>“I hate that name.”</p>
<p>“…Yes… Lune… Lune….”</p>
<p>Lustian took off his clothes. As soon as she sensed that he had undressed, she could feel the heat rising.</p>
<p>Her gaze kept finding his chest and upper body. His toned muscles and abs were distinct. His wide chest, wide shoulders, enormous height, that beautiful face that could steal any human’s heart… He was shimmering as if there were flowers surrounding him.</p>
<p>Looking at his neck, Viola gulped. She imagined a light grey light shining on him through the cool, misty air. The voluptuousness spreading out along with the fragrance of the flowers turned into a lust that was too much to bear.</p>
<p>“I am also in a hurry. I can’t possibly bear it when you look at me like that? Huhu.”</p>
<p>“Are we not going too fast?”</p>
<p>“It’s only because we haven’t done this in a long time. I will loosen you up. Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>He moved his tongue from her neck to her collarbones and sucked on them. The strength of the sucking made her thighs jolt up. It was hot. Her whole body felt as though it was burning. She felt a rush at every touch. A fluid came dripping out.</p>
<p>“Hah… Look at this. The ere*tion. Please touch it….”</p>
<p>He breathed roughly and brought her hand to his p*nis. It was so erect, it looked like it was going to burst. As soon as she started touching it a little, he made the sweetest noises.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh….”</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh….”</p>
<p>He sucked on her n*pples, the strength comparable to a baby getting breastfed. Viola jerked her neck around and moaned. Her body became hotter.</p>
<p>“Ahhh… Ahhhhh, Lune….”</p>
<p>She was caught up in the desire to put her lust towards him to rest. The electrifying sensations shot all through her body. His rod in her hand seeped pre-cum, in other words, it was begging to enter a narrow cave. He thrust lightly. And to show that he couldn’t take it any longer, he put his it to her face.</p>
<p>“Please suck it….”</p>
<p>“Yes….”</p>
<p>Viola put the shaft in her mouth. His thighs shook. She rolled her tongue along the erect pillar. When even the root of his manhood was in her mouth, she licked it meticulously. Her cave was so wet, there was no need for lubrication. He touched it with his hands, she recoiled when a finger went inside.</p>
<p>“Ack… Ahhhhh….”</p>
<p>“It’s soaked. I think it can stop.”</p>
<p>“Not yet….”</p>
<p>“Liar. Your whines are adorable.”</p>
<p>“Eek-!”</p>
<p>He put another finger inside. Right away, his finger was swallowed by her nectar. With a playful laugh, he put his face in between her thighs. Her exposed flower hole touched his nose. At the same time, a hot piece of flesh entered it.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh… Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>He lifted his tongue to poke her cave. She trembled as a viscous liquid came dripping down. Along with each movement of the tongue, her hole shook. Every time his tongue was about to come out, she squeezed her entrance tightly.</p>
<p>“Hah, hah, hah.”</p>
<p>Immersed in the pleasure, she was losing focus. The breathing and moaning stimulated her mind. She was gushing and thrusting involuntarily. She couldn’t be more satisfied than this. She needed something bigger and firmer.</p>
<p>“You can… stop. Please Lune.…”</p>
<p>“I am also about to lose my mind. I will put it in.”</p>
<p>Viola nodded fiercely in assent. He came on top of her and put her leg over his shoulder. Suddenly a thick member touched the entrance of her cave. As he tried to enter bit by bit, she felt the pain rushing in.</p>
<p>“Ah… Are you sure it hasn’t grown?”</p>
<p>“Has it? I don’t know. Do you think it’s bigger than before?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and by a lot, at that… Ung….”</p>
<p>She felt a very rough texture. It was already big, to begin with, but felt like it somehow got bigger. He was a god. Even if He was still in a human body, it seemed as though the divine power made His body stronger. Along with a short yelp, her hips shook violently.</p>
<p>The sounds of the bodies clashing were very er*tic.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Khhhh, it’s tight… Ah, it feels so hot!”</p>
<p>Lustian held her chin and went for her lips. His tongue movements were hasty. Rather than just the roof of her mouth, his tongue moved all throughout the inside of her mouth. He sucked on the root of her tongue strongly. Entangling her tongue, he thrust into her wildly. Their breaths were hot. From between their mouths, fluids came trickling down. He swallowed them all. Her thighs shook violently.</p>
<p>“Urk, uhhh, oooh…”</p>
<p>It was electrifying. Every time his shaft rammed her, her body shook crazily. Their bodies were intertwined with each other.</p>
