<p><strong>Chapter 174</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>The supplies for the subjects that took the brunt of the damage were quickly prepared. They set up freshly cooked soup and bread, dry blankets, and tents that would serve as temporary barracks. After the supplies were sent off in the morning, Viola also prepared the food and blankets herself. While the valets prepared the bread, the empress rolled up her sleeves and helped out. The large cart was filled with the supplies.</p>
<p>The subjects living at lower elevations were at the highest priority since they received the most damage. Even if the kingdom faced any sort of disaster, royalty wouldn’t starve, but it was obvious that the peasants would.</p>
<p>The carriage marched on with might. Apart from the fact that all of the shops leading up to the central region were closed, there wasn’t much damage, but when they got to a lower elevation, there were lots of people begging. The children that recognized that Viola’s carriage was of royalty reached out to her. Viola’s heart was aching. Right away, her eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>“Do not falter. This is all part of God’s plan.”</p>
<p>“…Guinev….”</p>
<p>Even if Guinev couldn’t see anything, it was obvious that she could feel Viola’s emotions. Unlike Viola who was becoming more and more emotional, she spoke in a soft voice to help her hold herself together.</p>
<p>Viola nodded and held onto her shaky heart. “Distribute the bread to children. Quickly!”</p>
<p>As soon as the carriage stopped, the carriage that was holding the bread also stopped. When Viola got off the carriage, Guinev followed suit. The knights pitched a tent because of the rain and then also set up tables everywhere. Then, as if they were waiting for the right time, the subjects came up to them. The people who saw the royal insignia recognized that these were supplies provided for rescue purposes.</p>
<p>Just then, Viola opened her eyes as soon as she heard the cries of a baby. When she turned around, she found a lady in the rain holding her baby in the middle of a crowd.</p>
<p>“Your Highness!”</p>
<p>Viola ran up to her. Then, she took her hand and led her into a tent. When she put the warm soup on a table right in front of the lady, her eyes went wide.</p>
<p>“Y-Your Highness… To think that you would look after such worthless….”</p>
<p>“What do you mean “worthless”. Don’t say such things. You are all equally important to me.”</p>
<p>Viola took the baby from her arms and hugged her. She felt sorry that a just born had to line up for the rationing.</p>
<p>“Sir Kyle, we must ration the bread to every home with a child.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Kyle took note of all the other women who were with child. Finally, Viola was relieved.</p>
<p>She rolled up her sleeves along with the valets to distribute the bread. When any area seemed short-handed, she ran over there to help them without hesitation. The subjects were awestruck by the sight and bowed to her.</p>
<p>Just then, she heard a rumbling noise coming from elsewhere. When she looked over in the direction, she saw a man staring at her.</p>
<p>“Who is the one that brought the empire to this point! Did you want to come to watch it all fall apart? Ghhhk-! Yes, how does it feel to see it for yourself? Tell me! Ghhhk….”</p>
<p>He reeked strongly of alcohol. Since he was so riled up, he wasn’t aware that he was yelling at somebody. The distribution house fell into chaos as they started talking about what he said. The knights went up to him. When they told him that he would be punished for defiling royalty, he laughed maniacally.</p>
<p>“We’ll all be dead anyhow! We’ll all die! You’ll see! The disaster has only just begun. Gahahaha! Die!”</p>
<p>The knights covered his mouth. Kyle took out his knife. The knife reached his neck, but he didn’t stop talking.</p>
<p>“Let me rip your mouth apart,” Kyle said gravely.</p>
<p>“Do you think you can do that? Huh? These children are all going to die because of these diseases! Our children will die!!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Kyle was the Grand Master of the Imperial House. He would take anything if it meant protecting Lustian. When the man pointed his knife to him, Viola lifted her hands.</p>
<p>“Stop it, Sir Kyle.”</p>
<p>“He defiled the imperial family. Not even putting his life on the line can make up for it.”</p>
<p>“Stop! Wait!”</p>
<p>Viola went up to him carefully. When she bent over and made eye contact with the man, he flinched. Shocked, the man stared at Viola.</p>
<p>“Tell me again. Did you say the children were ill?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes… That is so….”</p>
<p>“Since when?”</p>
<p>“E-Ever since the rain, the children started falling ill one by one.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the downpour stopped. In a shock, Viola stared up at the sky. The pitch-black fog cleared and she was shocked at how brightly the sun shone as if there was no rain.</p>
<p>Viola suddenly turned her head. Just then, she could see Guinev stumbling from a distance. Although she grabbed her body, she looked exhausted. Guinev was the one who kept praying ever since they arrived.</p>
<p><em>What if the gods saw what was happening through her eyes? Was this not going according to the God of Judith’s plan? Not all hope was lost, but it seemed that another disaster awaited them.</em></p>
<p>“I must go to where this man lives. And bring Princess Guinev to the palace.”</p>
