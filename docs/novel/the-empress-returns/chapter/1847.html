            <p><strong>Chapter 180</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Viola’s eyes widened when he went up to her. And just in case, she held a dagger. He smirked to show he thought it was ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Do you think you can hurt me with a human weapon?”</p>
<p>“No, even if I can’t hurt you, I can cause a wound. I will not bend to your will.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha. How ridiculous. You are definitely no ordinary woman. Of course, if you didn’t have that, you wouldn’t have fallen in love with a god, knowing they were indeed a god.”</p>
<p>“I am the companion of the God of Judith. Look at the evidence for yourself.”</p>
<p>Viola did not back down. In fact, she held her head up high and glared at him.</p>
<p>He twisted his lips, looked at her lower belly. He would have to succumb, seeing that she proved it by becoming pregnant. This was beyond his expectations. The fact that a child came from them…</p>
<p>“That’s correct, this did not go according to plan. But even so, nothing has changed. You may be God’s Companion, but you will not see him again until death.”</p>
<p>Viola shook her head furiously. “No! You are wrong. We have been punished enough, and the pain of not finding each other for 200 years was immense. If he comes to find me, you will have to admit it.”</p>
<p>His lips quivered.</p>
<p>Viola trusted Lustian. No, she trusted Judith for 200 years. He only became a human to find her. He reincarnated to re-align their fates.</p>
<p>“You will not be able to dodge your punishment….”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Lustian led the most elite army to war. They fought and fought for three days without rest. As a result of the war, there were many casualties, and the other side lost a lot of their war power as well.</p>
<p>Lustian grabbed onto the hilt of his word and wrapped a cloth around it. “What are the casualties?”</p>
<p>“200 people. Thankfully, barely any of them have died.”</p>
<p>“Bring the deceased to their mother countries in the most respectful manner possible, and bring the wounded to the healing stone to treat them. From now on, all wounded soldiers will be drawn out of this plan.”</p>
<p>“What do you intend to do? Until now, the soldiers you sent back exceed 60% of everyone we have.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, this is a battle between me and God. I must pass through the final gateway.”</p>
<p>“No! I shall not send you off alone.” Kyle yelled out in a stern voice.</p>
<p>Lustian looked over all the people who did not look to be in the best shape. Even if they weren’t severely injured, there were a lot of visible scars. He continued to address the group of people gathered together out of loyalty. “This is an order. Kyle…. This final gateway will severely endanger their lives, so I trust you to take care of them for me.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness….” Kyle looked at the Emperor with a stern expression as if he wasn’t about to back down.</p>
<p>“If this is your last time here, I will make sure that the road you take isn’t lonely for you. I am sure that Paul and Grand Duke Ivan would also feel the same way.”</p>
<p>The others also nodded their heads. As Lustian looked off into the sky, a bittersweet smile formed across his lips.</p>
<p>“The stubbornness… Alright, let us gather our strength. By tomorrow, I will meet the Empress. I can feel it… her presence… I miss her… I miss her insanely….”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Viola couldn’t ascertain the time, but it felt like it had been about two hours. After wandering for a long time, she peeked out of the small window in the narrow tower. Since God was preoccupied with His battle with Lustian, He did not have the luxury to focus on her. That was a relief. It was time for her to put her plan into motion.</p>
<p>“I think we must leave.”</p>
<p>“This is the New World. Even if we are lucky enough to leave, we cannot go to the human world,” Edward said.</p>
<p>“I know. Even so, I know the way to the human world.”</p>
<p>Edward was surprised.</p>
<p>“The map drawn in my head is the proof.”</p>
<p>“You remember that complicated map?”</p>
<p>Viola nodded. Just in case, she’d learned the ways of the map and intended to go to the New World. So before passing over to the New World, she’d spent days and nights learning the topography of the map.</p>
<p>Edward looked perplexed. “There are many eyes watching you. It’s obvious that the pawns will be surrounding the tower.”</p>
<p>“Please lend your power to me. And… will there not be a god that will help me?”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Edward’s eyes went wide. Viola grabbed his hand with an air of confidence.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that so? There should be another god that is watching over His ugly behaviour, correct? Please get me to meet Him.”</p>
<p>“…I don’t know if He will help you. In fact, He may already know that you’re trying to escape.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not true.”</p>
<p>“How can you be so sure?”</p>
<p>“The God that listened to Guinev’s prayers… should be here. I am sure….”</p>
<p>Viola implored Edward again.</p>
<p>“…If you say so….”</p>
<p>Edward looked out the window and saw that a man was floating up in the sky. He was surprised. As if he’d overheard their conversation, he came inside. Then, Viola had a mysterious smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Of course, you are no ordinary woman. Not only do you try to finish the negotiations by coming to the New World, but now you try to escape….”</p>
<p>“So it’s You? The God that listened to Guinev’s prayers….”</p>
<p>“Well, if it is, it is.” He shrugged.</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>“My mother is the Goddess of Love.”</p>
<p>“Go- Goddess of Love? Then You are the one who split the God of Judith’s heart and gave us another chance….”</p>
<p>“I had no choice but to intervene since he twisted the fate of my mother. Power lies in the New World. A god that is easily jealous especially cannot stand to see someone better than I am.”</p>
<p>She felt that He was no enemy after all. Viola asked Him a straightforward question.</p>
