            <p><strong>Chapter 156</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>With Ivan and Paul in the lead, the empress and her entourage fought off the endless wave of Orcs.</p>
<p>Viola also helped them out. She took out an arrow and shot the Orcs in the head whenever they tried approaching the trees.</p>
<p><em><strong>Squash!</strong></em></p>
<p>The arrows hit them directly in the heads, promptly ending their lives. Just then, as soon as a crowd of them gathered around the tree to axe it, Paul took out his sword and beheaded them.</p>
<p>It was tremendous. Them being enemies was enough, but the skills of those two men were so shocking that her mouth was hanging open at the sight. The battle continued until the westward sky turned red.</p>
<p>“My empress!”</p>
<p>“Leave it to me. Paul!”</p>
<p>Viola aimed her target at the Orcs trying to climb up the tree. As they fell off, they tumbled on top of the others. It was thrilling every time she pulled the bow. Then, she took a dagger out from below her dress. Rosha was shaking, worried for her as she would officially begin the fight.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. I am also a swordsman.”</p>
<p>Viola slashed at the Orc that was coming from behind Anne within an earshot. There was a crackling noise as she slashed the dagger across its neck and watched it fall from the tree.</p>
<p>In a moment of peril, they were working well together. When the lights started turning on, one by one from a far distance, some reinforcements appeared. Then, just when the Blood Army waved their flag, it happened. Viola’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p><em>‘What must we do? It isn’t even nighttime yet. And how did so much of the army move here?!’</em></p>
<p>As the crimson atmosphere disappeared completely from the black sky, she watched Lustian fighting beneath the sky. As soon as the emperor appeared, he became the target of the Orcs. Hundreds of Orcs surrounded him. However, he wasn’t intending to attack them. He was standing on his horse as he held his sword with both hands and focused. It must already have been so difficult to be standing on a horse that was moving at such high speed, and yet he was not shaken and gathered energy to his sword.</p>
<p>An aura was emanating from his body. When a tremendous light engulfed him, a huge explosion happened all at once. There was an incredible tornado with winds. Just as it seemed that the large sandstorm was about to swallow the forest whole, the cries of the Orcs could be heard.</p>
<p>‘…Ah! Grand… Master?! This must be the power of the Grand Master…!’</p>
<p>Viola couldn’t believe her own eyes. The energy he gathered to bring out that amount of power did not seem human. Her heart thumped.</p>
<p>When the sandstorm cleared, there was not a trace of the Orcs left. There was only the beautiful man standing atop the horse, smiling at Viola.</p>
<p>Viola came down from the tree and frantically ran to him. Likewise, Lustian went running to her. She threw herself into his arms. Just then, he grabbed onto her waist and spun around.</p>
<p>He was dependable. As long as the world had even one Grand Master… they didn’t need to be afraid of the war they would wage against God.</p>
<p>“Lune… Lune… How did you come all this way?”</p>
<p>“I could not even think of you getting injured. I decided to put the spell on hold.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh… Lune…”</p>
<p>“It’s a relief that I wasn’t late. Hoo….”</p>
<p>Their lips met. They engaged in a deep, passionate kiss. The kiss that the beautiful imperial couple shared made everyone envious.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The Sanctuary of The New World</p>
<p>God watching over Lustian and Viola and ended up with a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>“How incredible! They should at least know the limits to their own delusions. This doesn’t make any sense. A Grand Master? A human used his own body to… become a Grand Master? Lustian! Lustian! It’s clear that your ability to irritate me knows no end. Even so! You will always be just a human. If you think your human body stands a chance against me, a God, you are gravely mistaken! You shall see! I will most certainly steal God’s Companion away for myself.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>After a day, the magician connected the transportation portal. In front of the open portal stood Lustian stood holding Viola’s hand.</p>
<p>“You really don’t intend to come?”</p>
<p>“I must go to the Kingdom of Koronis.”</p>
<p>“Tsk….” Lustian let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>“Even if Sir Kyle may be a brilliant knight, Wendy will only be safe with Your Highness at her side.”</p>
<p>“I know this. She is more precious to us than anything else.”</p>
<p>“I promise. After confirming the entreaty with just the Kingdom of Koronis, I shall leave the remaining matters of the kingdom to Grand Duke Ivan.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>After sneaking a glance at Lustian, Ivan’s shoulders went up. The sudden attack of the Orcs was surprising, but since the reinforcements had arrived just in time, nobody was hurt. During Viola’s journey, she was safe to the extent of which troops of the highest caliber made it over to protect her, and since the Kingdom of Luanna also sent troops after hearing the news, she could rest easy.</p>
<p>“They will come back in the night. If you change your mind, we can go back.”</p>
<p>“Yes, see you in a day.”</p>
<p>“Kiss me.”</p>
<p>Lustian gave Viola a light peck on the lips. As soon as their lips parted, he completely disappeared.</p>
<p>As soon as Viola tried to get on the carriage, she could hear the voice of an ashamed Anne.</p>
<p>“How could he… without a trace….”</p>
<p>“This is just as important as concealing the fact that the emperor comes to my bed every night. You saw Anne yesterday, didn’t you? She doesn’t know how dangerous it is to be away from the Arpen Empire.”</p>
<p>“There are enemies everywhere. I don’t know why she chooses to make such reckless journeys, even while knowing this. They can gather as many troops as they want in facing God, but the outcome will always be painfully obvious.”</p>
<p>The mocking tone in their voice irritated Viola.</p>
<p>“What outcome? Ah, the fact that a human alone cannot fight off God? Why do you think so? You cannot guarantee that when the battle hasn’t even started yet.”</p>
<p>“I’m just thinking… Is it really worth it to bring other people into it when he could simply just sacrifice himself?”</p>
<p>“You don’t say….”</p>
<p>Viola stopped in her tracks. She went up to Anne who was glaring at her silently. Anne’s expression changed dramatically from the carefree smile she had earlier. Without even realizing it, Viola got caught up in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>“If you knew what I had been through for the last eight years, you wouldn’t be saying this. Every day I had to curse myself for my own fate. I could not tell a single loved one that I loved them, and I had to aim a blade at his heart because of the hatred I couldn’t help but carry in me. Truly a horrible feeling. I wasted eight years of my life just running away. Perhaps if I had treated him with honesty eight years ago, things would be different. Perhaps the peace of Slovenia would have come sooner.”</p>
