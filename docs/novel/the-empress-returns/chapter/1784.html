            <p><strong>Chapter 122</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Let us leave this dance and drink together.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>Viola went up to the platform. There, they drank and watched the aristocrats dance. It may have been that Wendy and the crown prince were tired because they went up to the platform, only for Wendy to get scolded. The platform was only meant for the imperial family. When her friend the crown prince was separated from her, Wendy slouched. This left a bitter taste in Viola’s mouth, but she couldn’t let Wendy sit there as she pleased.</p>
<p>What was surprising was Lustian’s actions. When he stretched out his hands, Wendy hopped over and sat on his lap right away. Then, she put her arms around his shoulders and started chattering.</p>
<p>Viola’s heart fluttered. To think that others would see them together made her heart flutter a lot.</p>
<p><em>No… Stay away immediately.</em></p>
<p>Viola’s heart wouldn’t calm down. The eyes of the imperial family were on the platform. Wendy was so lovable that she wanted to nibble on her. Several members of the family whispered to each other with fans over their mouths.</p>
<p><em>…This won’t do…</em></p>
<p>Viola got up from her seat and took Wendy away from Lustian.</p>
<p>“Wendy, let us go for a stroll.”</p>
<p>“Yes! My empress.”</p>
<p>Since Wendy happened to want to get some air, she did what Viola said. She looked behind to see Lustian’s gaze was following them, but Viola was anxious. When she saw that Rosha and the nanny were following them, she sent Wendy off to the nanny. She sighed out of relief once they were separated.</p>
<p>“Hoo….”</p>
<p>“I was also shocked. It was plain just how much His Highness cares for Princess Wendy…..”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think he would do such a thing at the party.”</p>
<p>She knew that Lustian especially cared for Wendy, but she didn’t expect him to call her from the platform.</p>
<p>Viola looked around. She called for several valets. She ordered the one to send food for the people at the workhouse. She was worried for Paul who would be going through hardships.</p>
<p>“How is Paul?”</p>
<p>“He’s still doing fine.”</p>
<p>“Labor… It must be hard….”</p>
<p>The members of the royal family that came as hostages avoided labor, but everyone else was sent to the workhouse. There, they had to stack stones on their shoulders and build tall walls without rest.</p>
<p>“Sir Paul told me to tell you to not worry about him but to worry more about the comfort of the empress.”</p>
<p>Just then, there was a crumpling noise. Viola instinctively sensed somebody’s presence. It was Lustian.</p>
<p>“I am upset to think that you left me to think of another man. On top of that, today is your birthday.”</p>
<p>“Ah… Lune….”</p>
<p>“Tell me about another present.”</p>
<p>“No. This present is enough for me.”</p>
<p>Lustian lifted his eyebrows. All she wanted was her own present, but it looked like he was not pleased.</p>
<p><em>What should I do? I really don’t need anything…</em></p>
<p>Seeing that Viola was only twitching her lips without saying anything, Rosha felt she had to say something.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, if you wear this dress sent across oceans from a faraway continent, you would look extremely beautiful.”</p>
<p><em>Huh? Rosha?</em></p>
<p>When Viola looked at Rosha, she signaled her with her eyes. Finally, she knew that Lustian would want this. She realized that he wanted to give her a material gift. When she turned her neck and made eye contact with him, his eyes became soft.</p>
<p>“It would look amazing. I shall give you the dress as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Days later, Viola received his present. A bunch of gifts arrived, containing jewels, objects they would use in that kingdom, and a dress she didn’t know how to wear. Now, Lustian finally seemed to be pleased.</p>
<p>“Wear them one by one. It’ll look unbearably amazing if you were able to please me below.”</p>
<p>She knew what he meant. Her cheeks flushed a bright red. When she came out to the garden after she dressed up in the clothes he gave her, she saw Wendy. Lustian had given her the same dress.</p>
<p>“Somehow, I wanted to give it to her. It feels weird….”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>It was hard to know how he felt about Wendy.</p>
<p>When Lustian heard that Viola’s present had arrived, he headed to the empress’s palace. When he got closer, he could hear Wendy’s laughter. His mouth, without realizing it, curled into a smile. Strangely, even just looking at Wendy made him happy. It was a different kind of feeling he felt from his love for Viola.</p>
<p><em>How can she make me feel happy just from looking at her….</em></p>
<p>He was not used to these emotions he felt for the first time, so he wanted to show her the appearance of a firm monarch, but every time it collapsed at Wendy’s bright smile.</p>
<p><em>What on earth… is this emotion?</em></p>
<p>Lustian tilted his head.</p>
<p>Leaving these troubles behind, he could see Wendy wearing the clothes he had given her. These clothes that the aristocrats from across the ocean liked to wear were made of layered silk. It looked much more comfortable than the tight imperial corsets.</p>
<p>Viola was also wearing the clothes he had given her. As if she was bewildered at the cloth, she lifted up her long sleeves and fiddled with her coat string. Erotic thoughts filled Lustian’s mind right away. It would be very easy to take her clothes off just by untying the tie on her chest.</p>
<p>In the midst of his fantasies, there was a woman that was an eyesore. The woman that was being assisted by a maid was Guinev.</p>
<p><em>Guinev….</em></p>
<p>Lustian gave Guinev a cold glare. She was the reason he had to part with Viola for eight years. Guinev and the emperor’s schemes caused a misunderstanding and made Viola run away. Thinking of those times, he was grinding his teeth.</p>
<p>Eight years ago that night, he had received a command from the previous emperor.</p>
<p>“We’re having a ceremony to send God’s Companion over to the God of Judith. It will be you, Lustian, who will send the companion over.”</p>
<p>That was the day he was to send the companion to the God of Judith. As God’s Companion, it would be the God of Judith that she would marry instead of him. He had no choice but to meet her. His duties ended there, so once he sent her to God, it was over.</p>
