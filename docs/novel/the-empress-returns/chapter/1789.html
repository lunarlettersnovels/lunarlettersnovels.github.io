            <p><strong>Chapter 117</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“That’s true. It will be so overwhelming that a few days won’t compensate for it.”</p>
<p>“Where should we go?”</p>
<p>“We don’t know if many people will have their eye on us, so I’ll be your guide.”</p>
<p>When Kyle grew further away for a bit, Viola wanted to have lots of conversations with Ivan. More than anything, she wanted to set right relationship of the two brothers, since it’s fraught thanks to her. But…</p>
<p>“Don’t you regret it? Helping me, I mean,” Viola said.</p>
<p>Ivan replied simply, “No.”</p>
<p>“On that day… Did you send her over there knowing that His Highness would go looking for Guinev?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She didn’t blame Ivan even for the fact that she had to witness that scene.</p>
<p>“You were going to leave anyway, weren’t you?” he asked in return.</p>
<p>“That’s true. I did have a concrete goal.”</p>
<p>Dumbfounded, Viola laughed. To think that letting go of her ambitions to be King would bring her so much peace… Under the pretext of Edward’s death, she regretted the days she went through so much pain, trapping herself in a prison unable to feel true happiness.</p>
<p>“Now I want to ask the questions. If we could go back in time, what choices would you make?”</p>
<p>The wind swept past the two of them. Viola ruffled her disheveled hair and looked at Ivan.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have left. I would’ve stayed here and found a way to help him.”</p>
<p>Ivan’s eyes went wide. Even while looking at the sliver of disappointment that showed in his eyes, Viola couldn’t console him.</p>
<p>Ever since she had reunited with Lustian, she had finally made up her mind to accept her own fate. Even if it would become the most painful moment of her life… she wanted to protect him.</p>
<p>“If Guinev wasn’t God’s Companion, what good am I for, as someone who passed through His barrier? If that’s the place that only the chosen ones can enter, what does that make me?”</p>
<p>Ivan’s eyes trembled. “I don’t know that. Who you are…. or what you’ll be used for….”</p>
<p>She couldn’t hear another word from Ivan. She didn’t know that he wouldn’t know that. It didn’t matter. There was a lot of time and she had the heart to do everything for him.</p>
<p>“Where is Guinev? Guide me to her.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>She followed Ivan. The place he went to was the temple near the Lake of God. At the time, they thought that nobody would live in such an old and worn-out temple, but that was not the case. Many officials wandered about. When they passed by that place and went deeper inside, they came across another path that led to another temple.</p>
<p>“This is the imperial tomb,” Ivan said.</p>
<p>“In that case….”</p>
<p>“Yes, Father is buried here.”</p>
<p>“Did he pass away due to illness?”</p>
<p>“No. He passed away because they sent out a fake partner.”</p>
<p>“…!!!”</p>
<p>“Father was no longer useful to God. It’s because a new person showed up that would carry out His duties….”</p>
<p>The person newly appointed by God was Lustian, and the duty to look for God’s Companion was passed on to him. Because of this, the previous emperor was no longer useful. Viola was so shocked that the ends of her hair stood. He was a cruel god. To think that He would cost the emperor his life just because they sent out a fake bride…</p>
<p>Viola was worried for Guinev. After arriving at the palace, she tried exploring many facets of the situation but still could not find her on her own. <em>What has… become of her?</em></p>
<p>Just then, Ivan hid behind the pillar. “The empress is also here, so be careful. There is no good in seeing her again.”</p>
<p>She gulped. Even if there were no knights wielding swords, the security gave off a grave atmosphere. Amongst the officials, a woman carefully stepped forward. Something seemed amiss about her gait. The way she stretched her hands and faltered as she walked made it seem like she was preparing herself in case she bumped into something and fell. A lot of strength went into her hands as she gripped onto something to lean on. It was obvious that she couldn’t see.  Eventually, she went up to the altar.</p>
<p>With the help of the officials, she grabbed a dried-up petal and threw it inside the aromatic platform. The strong aroma spread out across the entirety of the temple.</p>
<p>“Rest in peace, Your Highness. I wish you happiness as you sit beside the merciful God.”</p>
<p>The woman started bowing at the altar. As she bowed, not once but several times, and lifted herself up, there were beads of sweat on her forehead. As she finished her prayer and turned around, her face could be seen.</p>
<p>She was Guinev…</p>
<p>As punishment for being the wrong companion, her sight was taken away from her. Her memory was also wiped away.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Viola’s heart hurt even after returning to the temple because of Guinev’s pitiful sight.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘If you don’t handle the situation with care after being chosen as God’s Companion, both of you will be punished. We’ve only just come to terms with that. And the person most closely resembling God’s Companion so far was Guinev…’</strong></em></p>
<p>Ivan had said that he couldn’t help. On top of not being able to see, Guinev didn’t even know who she was since she’d lost her memory. She definitely didn’t know her own name or identity, and she even forgot about loving Lustian. She became a bridesmaid. It was the law of the Arpen Empire that anyone who came into contact with God would become a bridesmaid or an official, so it was so.</p>
<p>Upon listening to the story, Rosha had a shadow cast over her face. “My empress, you aren’t obligated to do anything. Although it is true that Princess Guinev is pitiable, perhaps this is her destiny.”</p>
<p>“Prepare an official letter,” Viola said.</p>
<p>“Beg your pardon? Who do you intend to send it to?” the shocked maid asked.</p>
<p>“We must tell the Queen of Farus that she’s alive.”</p>
<p>“M-my empress… That is….”</p>
<p>Viola felt that they needed to relieve the Kingdom of Farus’ hostility. Unlike the other princesses, Guinev could not be sent back to her kingdom, but she wanted to cure her illness.</p>
<p>“Tell them I will look after Guinev. This will be my promise to them as the Empress of the Arpen.</p>
<p>I will look far and wide across the Continent of Slovenia and look for what she lost. I shall find the best therapist.”</p>
