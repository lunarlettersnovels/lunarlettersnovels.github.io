            <p><strong>Chapter 134</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p><em><strong>‘No, you absolutely do not. God’s Companion fits the description of the highest status. If Your Highness was truly God’s Companion, we would not have greeted you as the empress.’</strong></em></p>
<p>The denial was strong. However, such a strong denial only served to confuse her.</p>
<p><em>As expected, could it just be my own delusions? Is it only the imperial family that has the legitimacy to be considered to have been born into the most valuable status?</em></p>
<p>From the beginning, it was purported that she didn’t match the conditions. She was disqualified from the most important test. Viola took a deep breath.</p>
<p>‘Is there a way out of this? I can help.’ ‘I cannot disclose that.’</p>
<p>Kyle kept his mouth closed as if he couldn’t speak further. She had started the conversation knowing well she wouldn’t be able to get anything from him. Even after passing through the barrier, she felt unsettled about the fact that those who passed through the barrier are merely considered a remedy.</p>
<p>Viola could not follow him after he turned around. <em>Then, how can I possibly find him…</em></p>
<p>Soon after, guests showed up. For the past few days, Anne could be seen often in the empress’s palace.</p>
<p>The people drinking tea together used to arrive as candidates for the crown princess, but now they were all princesses that lived their separate lives. One of them became the empress, another the grand duchess, and another lived a long and fruitful life as a bridesmaid.</p>
<p>The one who set up such an occasion was Anne, but Viola was happy to see her to an extent. This was the opportunity to relieve awkward tensions in their relationship. They wanted to speak among just the three of them, thankfully the knights kept a far distance from the crowd.</p>
<p>When they were available in the afternoon, they drank tea and had a simple snack. Since Guinev was nowhere in sight, Rosha tended to her.</p>
<p>“Do you really not remember anything?” Anne said.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Guinev looked down at the ground. She had lost her memory and couldn’t even remember that she was a princess.</p>
<p>Anne clicked her tongue lightly.</p>
<p>“I also didn’t know you wouldn’t be able to remember. We were quite close after all.”</p>
<p>“Was that the case?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Did you make sure to keep the fact that I left the castle at night a secret? Ho ho ho.”</p>
<p>There was a clear difference between how Anne dealt with Guinev and how she dealt with Viola. It may have been that they spent time together in the secondary palace for months because it seemed like the amount of time they spent reflected their closeness. It was only that one of them couldn’t remember it at all…</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I have no memory of it.”</p>
<p>“That’s alright. I’m sure the memories will come back slowly. Ah, but was that true? Does Her Highness also know? I’m talking about the fact that we were actually the candidates for God’s Companion.”</p>
<p>She was about to bring the teacup to her mouth and stopped. Viola stared at Anne with a shocked face. Her whole body shook as soon as she heard those unexpected words from her lips.</p>
<p>“Until when will you keep this a secret? I am also from the imperial family. The Grand Duke kept this concealed, but as I kept going to the temple to pray, I happened to hear about it.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>Just then, Guinev opened her mouth to speak. “It’s because of me.”</p>
<p>“Guinev….”</p>
<p>Viola looked at Guinev with sympathy. She said herself she couldn’t remember, but she knew the one reason why she prayed for the previous emperor’s soul every day. She knew that the tragedy that befell him was because she was not God’s Companion.</p>
<p>The business of the imperial palace moved faster than these words. She at least hoped that word wouldn’t get out to the imperial palace.</p>
<p>“Since the Grand Duchess is also a part of the imperial family, you must watch your words.”</p>
<p>“Do not worry. Do you really think that I would disclose the secrets of the imperial family?”</p>
<p>“I shall put my trust in you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but we have each other….”</p>
<p>Rosha, who was tending to Anne, sent a message with her eyes. Though she said she trusted her, she spotted a slight smile forming on Anne’s lips. She didn’t want to be hostile but something about it irritated her.</p>
<p>Viola watched every one of Anne’s expressions.</p>
<p>“There seem to be many secrets in this empire. After all, she did pretend to be the candidate for the crown princess, claiming to be looking for God’s Companion. But if someone found out about these secrets, who would want to stay in the palace? To leave your loved one behind to marry God….”</p>
<p>Suddenly, every time there was any talk of God’s Companion, she would subconsciously glance at Guinev. Her hair that she tucked behind her ears neatly was a bit disheveled.</p>
<p>“Ah, this is another story I heard but there was talk of how the expected Empress ran away from the previous emperor. They said that ever since then, the concubine was trapped in the abandoned tower and could never leave. Do you know why the concubine ran off at the time?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Viola stared at Anne.</p>
<p>“Because she was pregnant. They said she was suspected to be God’s Companion.”</p>
<p>Her heart sank with a thud. Viola’s eyes went wide. Her heart thumped. She looked at Anne who smiled.</p>
<p>“The child born at the time was my husband. His mother was trapped in the abandoned tower.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>When the guests went away, her mind went blank. She thought back to Ivan gazing at the castle in the forest of God with a pitiful look on his face. She could not stop thinking of his visage that looked like he was longing for somebody.</p>
<p>It was very shocking.</p>
<p>‘To think that Ivan’s mother is the one trapped in that castle. Could that place be the territory of God? Then, does that mean perhaps… that his mother is also becoming God’s Companion?’</p>
<p>Just then, Lustian entered the castle. Considering he was covered in dust, it seemed like he came on a horse in a rush. It seemed that the news of the morning reached him. Upon</p>
<p>approaching Viola, he hugged her to the point where it was like she would be crushed. His behavior erred on the side of caution.</p>
<p>“It is not right to disclose the secrets of your birth. Ivan’s mother has nothing to do with God’s Companion. Father hid her in the abandoned tower so as to save her. When Ivan’s identity is revealed, both of their lives will be at stake. After all, the one who sent them to the territory to protect both their lives was Father himself. All he did was hide them there because it was the safest location.”</p>
