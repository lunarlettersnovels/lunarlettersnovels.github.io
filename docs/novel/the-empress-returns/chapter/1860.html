            <p><strong>Chapter 167</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Hah… Mmmm… Viola….”</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>Lustian put her entire ear into his mouth and sucked on it. He licked her outer ear with his thick tongue and then thoroughly from the inside. The pleasure made her shoulders quake. Wanting to experience the exhilarating pleasure further, she pressed her body even closer to his.</p>
<p>Soon enough, he grabbed her waist and lifted her up. Then, he took off her lace underwear and she wrapped her two legs around his waist. In between that, Lustian’s <em>length</em> entered. Her eyes twitched and trembled.</p>
<p>“Ahhh… Ahhhhh…!”</p>
<p>He entered the hole. With a big thrust, he entered her deeply at once. Viola’s chin was facing the sky. He started thrusting deeply once again. It felt like his whole body was burning up. She was so tight that his thick shaft didn’t have the room to move. But just then, he thrust hard from below.</p>
<p>Wet noises were emerged from beneath him.</p>
<p>“Ghhhh… Agh…!”</p>
<p>“Ahhh…!”</p>
<p>A new type of fluid came out from deep within her. At the same time, the pre-c*m oozing from his rod acted as a lubricant. It was erotic how her honeypot kept on swallowing and spitting out his member. With his movements in the tub, the water kept splashing without rest.</p>
<p>As soon as the s*x began, he was moving like a beast. His length moved aggressively amid her fluids. Her mounds pressed hard on his sturdy chest.</p>
<p>“Viola! Mmmm… I love you…!”</p>
<p>“I love you… Lune… Lune…!”</p>
<p>He bent his neck forward and kissed her. There were noises of them sucking on each other’s lips. Wrapping his arms around her waist, he got Viola to get up immediately. The constant kissing was breathtaking. As their tongues were tangling up, they sucked on each other’s lips.</p>
<p>“Mmmmm-”</p>
<p>Lustian got her to sit on his thighs. Then, as their chins collided, he kissed Viola’s lips. Bit by bit, his tongue that was sliding across her face reached her collarbones. An indescribable sensation caused her to heat up.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah! Aaaah!”</p>
<p>She was becoming wet from deep inside. As if she were his property, he left traces on her body. It was clear that he intended to show it to someone else. He wanted to show it to the God of Judith. He acted as if Viola’s heart was only for him.</p>
<p>“Ah-! Mmmm-”</p>
<p>His manhood that filled her body took her breath away. She felt electrified, and soon enough when his pen!s hit her spot, her eyes rolled to the back of her head. She arched her neck and moaned. It was frantic.</p>
<p>“Ah- Ahhh!”</p>
<p>“Hah, hah…. Urk. Ghhhh!”</p>
<p>His swollen rod moved through her hole. She felt as if her head would explode. Her throbbing wet vag*na couldn’t be more erotic. Twisting her neck, she bit her lip so as to ignore the pleasure. But her body moved upwards involuntarily.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh! Ahhh!”</p>
<p>She continued moaning uncontrollably. The steam rising from the tub entwined with her haggard breaths. The breaths they exchanged were hotter than the water coming from the small waterfall.</p>
<p>As they collided, there was a squelching sound. Their sensitive spots throbbed while they rubbed against each other. Lustian’s eyes were burning. His bloodshot eyes looked like they would explode any moment. It was very seductive.</p>
<p>He breathed heavily. Viola’s body and mind were so out of sorts that she could no longer melt any more than she already had. Everytime his huge shaft thrust into her, she felt immense pleasure. The powerful orgasm rendered her unable to control herself. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Ahhh-! Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>“Hah… Hah… Mmmmm…!”</p>
<p>His breathing became rougher. With all the rough movements, his nether region was tightening up so much that it felt like it would snap in half. His seductive eyes were about to swallow her up a whole. It was titillating, his face looked very sexy. The thrusting stimulated her sensitive spot. She soaked herself in the pleasure that was driving her insane.</p>
<p>She opened up her legs again, then hung them over his shoulders. Her visible cave was tantalizing. Up in the air, her core was throbbing. Embarrassingly enough, her clam shell twitched, unable to close. His lips opened just slightly. Once again, his length entered. The area where they were connected had white foam forming around it as their fluids mixed together. It was very erotic.</p>
<p>Lustian kissed her again. Viola’s lips opened bit by bit. Now every time they kissed, their lips opened naturally. Fluids spread across both their lips.</p>
<p>“Mmmm—”</p>
<p>“Mmmmm—!”</p>
<p>Their breathing was a mess. His beast-like breathing was driving her insane.</p>
<p>He grabbed the back of her head gently. Just then, her hand found its way to his back. As their lips met, a tongue came through. When they let go, a long silver strand of saliva formed between their lips. He swallowed the strand.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Come morning, she opened her eyes slightly. When she turned her head, she saw Lustian soundly asleep.</p>
<p><em>What do we do? Could Rosha and Paul have arrived?</em></p>
<p>The two hurried to the transportation portal, but they needed to get on the carriage and come back to the palace. They would’ve arrived by now. They needed to be there for the empress to move around freely.</p>
<p>Viola estimated the time that passed between when she got to God’s territory and the current time.</p>
<p><em>What’s an hour to God’s territory is half a day over here…</em></p>
<p>Until they found the map, they needed to buy time for a day. At the very least, Lustian had to be apart from her for a day… Even if that wasn’t possible, she needed to catch his attention.</p>
