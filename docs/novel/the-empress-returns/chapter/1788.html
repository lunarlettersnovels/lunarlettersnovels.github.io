            <p><strong>Chapter 118 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Two days had passed. Since he said that it would take days, she assumed that it would take three to four days, but Lustian came back to the imperial palace earlier than expected. Hearing that he was back, Viola’s heart started pounding. It had only been two days, but she wanted to run over to where he was.</p>
<p>However, she decided to contain herself to prepare a bath for him after returning from the war. A while later, Lustian entered the bathroom. Viola flinched seeing him covered in the blood of the Orcs, but she walked over to him bit by bit. After he lifted his hands to get everyone to leave, only the two of them were left in the wide tub.</p>
<p>“To be waited on by the empress would be more magnificent than anything.” A subtle heat was showing in his eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m so relieved that you came back unharmed.”</p>
<p>“Were you worried?”</p>
<p>“No. You are strong, after all.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. It would be unfair if I died in vain after finally finding you.”</p>
<p>He grabbed Viola’s chin and kissed her. As soon as she opened her mouth, a tongue slipped in and wandered around in her mouth without rest. As he twisted her back and sucked on her tongue, her lower area gradually became wet.</p>
<p>“Mmmm….”</p>
<p>His breath grew more ragged.</p>
<p><em>An even deeper place than the root of my tongue… My throat was burning. His love for me hasn’t changed, but that might change when he finds God’s Companion.</em></p>
<p>At this moment, Viola hoped that he would never find God’s Companion. It was selfish. The fact that this ambition was inside her felt ridiculous even to her.</p>
<p>With a buzzing sound, his lips left her mouth and a long silver line of saliva formed. As if Lustian didn’t even want to waste that, he licked it with his tongue.</p>
<p>“First I want to wash this dirty blood off me.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Viola undressed Lustian. With that, he also took her dress off. As if they promised this to each other, they both became naked. As he went inside the tub, his head leaned back and he closed his eyes.</p>
<p><em>‘…I think he’s becoming more beautiful.’</em> He definitely became more and more beautiful. His shoulders and chest were wider than before and his jawline accentuated his masculine beauty. His beauty made her dizzy.</p>
<p>“Let’s start with the scalp.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Viola used the warm water to wash the crimson blood off his hair and pressed her fingers firmly on his scalp to relieve the fatigue. It felt good. Warm water spread out from the fingertips touching his hair. Light breathing escaped his mouth.</p>
<p>As his hair was washed until the water grew transparent, his body became clean. Right then, he stretched his hands backwards, and Viola went on top of his body.</p>
<p>“I wanted to hug you so badly I was going mad. I’m sure the same applies to you, correct?”</p>
<p>Viola’s face turned red. It was the truth, but she was embarrassed to say it herself. Lustian could only chuckle as if he knew how she felt. He bit on her nipples. As soon as he squeezed on both her mounds, her back twisted.</p>
<p>“Ahhh….”</p>
<p>As Lustian’s passed by her belly button more and more to start gently licking below her vag*na, her hips spasmed. He went for it as if he had been waiting. As soon as he squeezed through the thick flesh below her cave, she gasped. There was the sound of sloshing liquid.</p>
<p>“Ahhh….”</p>
<p>Viola grabbed onto his hair and twisted it around. She could feel the hot lump of flesh filling her up in the lower area and through her l*bia maj*ra. Her back arched like an arrow and fluids came dripping down her stiff lower area. Her body twisted around on its own giving way to light breathing.</p>
<p>“The fluids flowing from here are more delicious than any kind of honey.”</p>
<p>“Hhhh… Mmmm….”</p>
<p>Lustian spread her thighs far apart and ceaselessly licked her cl*t. His tongue was sharply erect, as he repeatedly put it in and out of her as if they were having s*x. Viola swallowed her breath with the rising lust. Her lower area was throbbing. As soon as he bit and licked her sensitive spot, she squeezed the man’s face with her two thighs.</p>
<p>“Don’t beg for it. I’m the one who wants to put it in right away.”</p>
<p>“Mmmm….”</p>
<p>As he said that, he stuck his nose in her hair and licked like mad. The ridge of his nose frantically moved around from side to side. As soon as he moved his neck to push his tongue between her folds, she opened up her thighs even wider. He licked it just like a beast. She could hear embarrassing noises without reserve.</p>
<p>“Mmmm… Hurry, hurry. Please….”</p>
<p>It became harder for her to bear. Her lower area was tingling. A subtle lust was hidden deep within her womb… It was not the kind of lust that could be relieved by just a tongue. Something bigger and thicker had to hit the spot. She pressured him. A body tamed by his body, a body that knew what it meant to be pleasured only waited for that.</p>
<p>Lustian lifted himself up, laughing. Then, he inserted a large lump of flesh in between her thighs.</p>
<p>“Aghhh….”</p>
<p>His waist started moving with a lot of strength. As he moved, her core started twitching. A loud smacking noise could be heard. The noise coming from her moist area created a lewd mood. It felt like her abdomen was about to rip apart. Her head felt so hot that it felt like it would burst. The tingling pleasure echoing in her brain caused her to open her mouth and utter a coquettish voice.</p>
<p>“Hah!! Ahhhh-! Ah-! That’s good! Ah! Ahhhh!!”</p>
<p>“Hah! Hah, khhh… Khhh… Uhhhh….”</p>
<p>A light flashed before Viola’s eyes, and shortly after, she jumped again at the exploding fireworks. It felt like her body was splitting apart. The heaviness of his manhood that pierced her hole and made her throb caused her to exclaim. But to get out of there, she had to grab his member as her core contracted.</p>
