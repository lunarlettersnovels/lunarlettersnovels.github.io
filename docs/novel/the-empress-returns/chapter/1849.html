            <p><strong>Chapter 178</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p><em>Once I enter the land, do I die?</em></p>
<p>That’s what came to mind.</p>
<p>Viola clutched her lower belly gently. Since she was not just venturing alone but also with her child, she was not lonely. She stretched her hand as she looked at the world that was growing further from her.</p>
<p><em>Lune… Wendy… Just wait… I will not lose… And Lune, remember who you are… Remember why you reincarnated as a human…</em></p>
<p>Viola smiled slightly.</p>
<p><em>Judith, my love… Judith… Lune… Lune… Our love is painful, but at the end of that pain, there will be happiness, so… don’t be sad.</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The lake that took his beloved became a calm lake once again. It was as if the strong gusts didn’t even happen. There was not a word from anyone. No one could even breathe. Everyone looked hopeless. He wept, looking at the final trace of her.</p>
<p>With the same thought, everyone looked at Lustian who had to send off his beloved. The beautiful emperor was frozen in place like a statue….</p>
<p>After a short, heavy silence, he came walking out of the lake. His heavy voice caused the knights to tense up. Soon after, there was a grave tone in his voice as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Be prepared. We will go after them.”</p>
<p>When her body sank into the territory, the memories came flooding back to her. Her consciousness returned to the time from before she had to part ways with her beloved. Before she would become a flower, the last time she met him…</p>
<p>Judith was so beautiful that the other gods would be jealous. There were many entities that displayed an adoration for Him. Goddesses, great fairies, and humans were a must, and it even reached a point where the demons fell for him. However, even after living a perfect life for thousands of years, He never once had true love. He just let His boring days pass by.</p>
<p>However, one day, He met a woman by chance. The sight of her not losing hope, despite the hardships she went through, captivated Him. If He simply was trying to sneak a glance at the human world, their fates would’ve ended there. However, he snuck down to the human world specifically to meet her. It was not enough to steal her heart. It was because the virgin broke the vow to love him…</p>
<p>The two made love. A day turned to two, and three became a month until it eventually became a year… God abandoned His duties to pour out His passions for her.</p>
<p><em><strong>“I have to go up. I will be back, so wait for me.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Judith….”</strong></em></p>
<p>He had to go back to the New World for a moment. Three days before their own small wedding, suddenly celestials approached him.</p>
<p><em><strong>“He will be here soon. His Highness is greatly angered.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“I am alright. Please leave.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Since the virgin knew that He would come for her, He was sent over. She trusted Him since she believed He would not abandon her right before their wedding. He looked at the virgin for a while with an expression that looked like He was deep in thought. Just then, He took something out.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Hide it in a place that only you know.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“What is this?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“The map that leads to God’s territory. It’s a very important map and you might need it for later, so keep it hidden.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“What do you need something like this for? You said you would come to me?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“I will. I will make sure that I will do whatever it takes. I am most afraid of the idea of me not being able to remember you.”</strong></em></p>
<p>He hugged the virgin tightly. She didn’t understand what He was trying to say. It was because it seemed like He was hugging someone He wouldn’t get to see for a long time even though He was only leaving for a few days. She wrapped her arms around His waist.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Do not worry. Even if you forget about me, I will remember you….”</strong></em></p>
<p>He went up to the New World and never came back to the human world. She waited for Him in the forest that He made. Every day felt like a year. Though she waited so long, He did not return.</p>
<p>Time passed until she was in a withered state as she continued to wait by the river.</p>
<p><em><strong>“I believe… in the vow.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Her life ended like that. Then, she was reincarnated in the form of a flower.</p>
<p>She could see him right in front of her as a flower. As soon as she saw Him, she was taken aback. It was because there was not a single part of His body that was not injured. His clothes were ripped apart, His forehead was bleeding, and He walked with a limp. He looked tired and weary like someone who had been in war for a long time. He kissed the flower bud and wept.</p>
<p><em><strong>“…Viola, I’m so sorry… that I was too late. I’m sorry…. Viola…. Viola….”</strong></em></p>
<p>He called out her name. It felt like his heart was ripping apart.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Viola… Viola….”</strong></em></p>
<p>No matter how far He stretched out his hand, Viola could not be touched since she was just a flower, and He wept.</p>
<p><em><strong>“It is me. I can hear everything. And I know. I know that you have been punished… so I forgive you. If we… meet in a different world, let us not forget one another.”</strong></em></p>
<p>It was desperate and sad. The tears formed rivers and would not cease until they formed a lake.</p>
<p>The Goddess of Love who was watching over such a tragic love appeared in front of Him.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Do not mourn any longer, my son! I will give you one more chance. I will split your heart in half. The other half will be sent to the human world, and the day you find that half is the day you will love again.”</strong></em></p>
