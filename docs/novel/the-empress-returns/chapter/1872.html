            <p><strong>Chapter 155</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“You there, Paul, step away from the empress.” Ivan’s face scrunched up as he went right up to Viola’s side.</p>
<p>As soon as Ivan came over, Paul sat up straight. “Do not look at me as if I’m your equal. I am not like you, Grand Duke.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I do trust her. However, I only say such things because it still looks as though you have something else on mind.”</p>
<p>The two of them were not so amicable with one another. Even if it was Viola that became the Empress of the Arpen Empire, Paul still viewed the imperial family as a pain. Furthermore, since Ivan was next in line to inherit the throne from Lustian, he was on guard.</p>
<p>“Paul, we need to trust in each other as like-minded people.”</p>
<p>“I apologize but the one who will stay by the empress’s side is I, not you, Grand Duke.”</p>
<p>It was actually Paul that gave Ivan an uncomfortable stare. Just then, Ivan looked as if he was being treated unfairly.</p>
<p>“Do I look like the kind of man who would be in an affair? It is obvious that the grand duchess is right here. Do you think I would betray her in such a way?”</p>
<p>“When has Grand Duke ever snuck around to pleasure himself with secret meetings?”</p>
<p>“Ha… Dash it all. I admit that I am quite the flirtatious one, but not to that extent. Hmm? You there.”</p>
<p>As soon as the two men started raising their voices, there was a ringing in Viola’s ears. She moved, wanting to get away from that space as soon as possible. She felt so faint, it was as if the ground was shaking.</p>
<p><em>I ought to rest…</em></p>
<p>Just as she was about to come out of the bushes, she felt that something was amiss. Trusting her instincts, she flinched. She stopped in her tracks and turned around suddenly as if she was dodging something.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thwack!</strong></em></p>
<p>As she missed the object by an earshot, it hit the tree instead.</p>
<p>“Empress!”</p>
<p>Viola was shocked. It was an arrow that went past her hair and hit the tree. After dodging it by a small margin, bead-like sweat came dripping down her forehead as her legs gave out.</p>
<p>“My empress! Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Guard her! At once!”</p>
<p>Ivan and Paul aimed their weapons at each other, wary of their surroundings. The knights that heard the commotion surrounded Viola and stood guard.</p>
<p>Ivan pulled the arrow out of the tree. His face scrunched up as he examined the arrowhead.</p>
<p>“We shall return to the Arpen Empire.”</p>
<p>“Yes… That is….”</p>
<p>“It is poison.”</p>
<p>“Poison! Poison?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just any kind of arrow but a poison arrow. It was obvious that there was an intention to assassinate Viola. Ivan took a parchment out of his clothes. Right there, he ripped it apart. Soon after, smoke came billowing through the slits of the parchment. Through the translucent smoke above the parchment, she could see Lustian.</p>
<p>– Ivan! What is the meaning of this?</p>
<p>“A poison arrow came flying. There is someone going after the empress.”</p>
<p>– Come back at once.</p>
<p>Lustian’s face turned blue. He ordered them to reverse the route of the carriage to return to the Arpen Empire at once. However, all that happened was that an alliance was formed with just one kingdom, and Viola wasn’t in a position where she could return.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I am alright. I may not know much, but I do know that I must go to the empire myself.”</p>
<p>– Viola… No. Come back.</p>
<p>With a stern look, Lustian shook his head. When it seemed like he was about to grab her hand, he was merely a formless projection of magic, meaning they could not hold hands physically.</p>
<p>Viola rapidly looked around. There was still more time until the moon was to rise. If there was a magician around, he would cast a transportation spell, but unfortunately, there was none around.</p>
<p>Lustian cursed under his breath.</p>
<p>– Dammit… There is still time until the magician completes the spell.</p>
<p>Since it took a complicated sort of magic to cast a transportation spell, even a Grand Magician had to put in all their power to complete the spell. Twenty-four hours needed to pass until they could perform the next spell, so they would have to wait until nightfall. The question was whether or not they had the time to do so.</p>
<p><em><strong>Du du du du!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Du du du du!</strong></em></p>
<p>Just then, there was vibrating noise. The ground shook. Just then, darkness fell over Ivan’s face.</p>
<p>“Am I the only one who feels this? The ground is very unstable.”</p>
<p>“…Draw your swords!”</p>
<p>“Dammit! When did all these bastards come all this way?” Shocked, Ivan lifted his sword up high.</p>
<p>“I will have to warm up. Big brother, see you later tonight.”</p>
<p>“Ivan! Viola!!”</p>
<p>Just then, the smoke disappeared. Viola gulped. As the sounds drew closer bit by bit, after a while, a crowd of dark Orcs appeared over the hills.</p>
<p>“Those who are able to have weapons should fight, while the rest should climb up the trees! Immediately!”</p>
<p>The people were in a frenzy. Having to encounter the Orcs in a country other than the Arpen Empire took them aback.</p>
<p>The maids screamed and climbed up the highest trees. Though Viola also had to fight them off with a sword in hand, she was even more concerned for the people shaking in fear. Since even Rosha and Anne were up the trees shaking like a leaf, she climbed up with the arrows on her back and the sword still in hand.</p>
<p>She gulped looking at the army of Orcs. Then, she heard their cries.</p>
<p><em><strong>Squeeeee! Squeee!</strong></em></p>
