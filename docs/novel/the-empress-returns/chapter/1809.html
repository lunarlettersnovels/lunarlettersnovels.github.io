            <h3><strong>Chapter 97 – Aftermath (1) | 19</strong></h3>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Viola didn’t want the seat of the empress. Just because Lustian had left that spot behind, it didn’t mean his duties would simply disappear. If Guinev wasn’t God’s Companion, he would have to meet another potential candidate and then she would be sure to suffer once more…</p>
<p>The pit of her stomach ached because of the memories. She did not want to go back there. Even if she would miss him while hiding her whole life, she refused to go back to the castle. But fate was cruel. With his appearance, she was thrust back to reality—along with the desires she had fought so long to suppress….</p>
<p>“Mmmm….”</p>
<p>Even after eight years, the haggard breathing hadn’t changed. Their lips wouldn’t leave each other once they interlocked. He gripped the back of Viola’s head and kissed her madly and sucked on her lips. The gasps gave the impression that he was desperately frustrated. <em>I am resentful. I didn’t even get to take care of the knights’ bodies, but the desires that he plants into me with his body…</em></p>
<p>“Release me.”</p>
<p>“What I want is you. Look at this, isn’t it throbbing?”</p>
<p>He used his hands to cut through her thick forest and reach for her wet womanhood. Her whole cave was throbbing like it had become a heart. Her body was saying something different from her words, so she no longer had an excuse.</p>
<p>As soon as she was laid on the bed, he started making out with her. She could feel his shaft twitching from below. Viola was taken aback. She knew what it meant when a rod was standing upright, it made her tense.</p>
<p>“Ha… Ha… You have no idea… how much I wanted to s*ck on these lips….”</p>
<p>“Mmmm….”</p>
<p>Bit by bit, his lips traversed along her earlobes and went down her nape. Viola bit on her own lip slightly and tried to force down her moans. As his kisses travelled further and further, his lips stopped at her belly button. Her taut muscles shook in a flash. While his tongue lapped at her navel, Viola tightened her jaw.</p>
<p>As he spread her thighs apart with one of his hands, her cherry bloomed, the nectar he so desired dribbled down. When he used his tongue to pass through her dense forest, she clenched her thighs.</p>
<h3><strong>10.1</strong></h3>
<p>“That’s proof that you want me.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>His tongue licked her petals in a frenzy, and as soon as his nose rubbed against the bush, the thrill doubled. As soon as he used his fingers to spread the lab!a apart with all his might, she was awash with shame and bashfulness, thinking of all her sensitive spots being licked so meticulously. As her love juices flushed out, he sucked on her cl!t with even more effort. It was driving her crazy, she arched her back like a bow. It was so potent that the strength she put into her thighs ended up constricting his face. She swallowed her own spit.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thirsting for you. So madly….”</p>
<p>“Ah… L-like that… Ack….”</p>
<p>As he nibbled on her petals, her chin shook. Her whole body convulsed.</p>
<p>“Was the bastard lusting after you?” He mumbled in a low voice.</p>
<p>“—No.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, that must’ve been the case. Your body is only meant to open up for me. You were made to be that way.”</p>
<p>What he said was the truth. She never mixed fluids with another man for eight years. She was spilling herself out like a fountain for him, while she dried up in front of all other men. Wasn’t that why her s*xual desires were non-existent for a while?</p>
<p>But then, as her lips met with his again, her desires burst forth from below. <em>To think that even in the face of the deaths of the knights that protected me, I’ve been reduced to this…. </em>She felt like a l*stful woman. At the same time, she hated him for not even giving her the time to grieve their deaths.</p>
<p>His face rose up, he nibbled on her swollen, erect b*ds.</p>
<p>“Ack—”</p>
<p>Her breathing was rough and sonorous. He greedily gathered the two n!pples together, plastering them against one another. And without so much as a pause, his lips, in turn, licked, suckled, and nibbled on. Each time he did so, she could feel the chills running through her whole body. Her heart was beating furiously, her blood seething rapidly. She was salivating and breathless. She became excessively sensitive to the touch as every part of her body that was touched by his tongue heated up like a pillar of fire.</p>
<p>“I like the sound of that. Mo*n more for me.”</p>
<p>“Ugh….”</p>
<p>No matter how much she tried to restrain herself, she could not stop herself from mo*ning. As if her body had found its rightful owner, she could not contain the excitement. Her back shook as if to instigate his movements, evoking in him a light laugh in response.</p>
<p>He used his tongue to twist her are*las, her breasts bouncing as they shook. Viola spread her thighs wide and just then, Lustian entered her.</p>
<p>“I’m the one who wants to tremble.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t hold herself together as they made out. <em>The man who is now vengeful towards me would likely not listen to my circumstances. </em>Although it was true that she saw him as a terrible man and felt vexed by him, Viola brought all of it upon herself. This was the price to pay for betraying his trust.</p>
<p>His eyes were burning red. They were so red, they looked like they were going to burst from the heat. <em>I can feel his frustration. It’s true that he needs my body more than anything to put out the fire.</em></p>
<p>“Please let me hold a funeral for the knights.”</p>
<p>“Even throwing them to a pack of wolves wouldn’t suffice for challenging me,” he muttered intimidatingly.</p>
<p>Viola implored yet again. “Edward also sent for them. I won’t let their honor be tainted after they followed him so loyally!” She  shoved him, glaring daggers at him.</p>
<p>Just then, Lustian stopped for a moment. Small scars revealed themselves, implying that he may have also been sliced by a lick of the blade during the final battle. However, he lived, while the knights died. She wanted to pay her respects on their final way out.</p>
<p><em>If he won’t let me hold a funeral, he’ll regret it for the rest of his life.</em></p>
<p>“All right. Then hang on… If you do that, I’ll let you have your funeral.”</p>
<p>Lustian bent over and licked the back of her ear gingerly. After he had painted over her ear flaps with the tip of his tongue, he bit on it gently.</p>
<p>She knew that he wouldn’t accept her request so easily. Nonetheless, she nodded her head and spread her thighs without shame. If this was all she had to do, she could give him permission again and again.</p>
<p><em>But was he not satisfied?</em> Lustian ruffled his own hair into a tangled mess.</p>
<p>“Don’t make that face. It’s driving me crazy. There is no condition. That’s right, those bastards paid the price with their lives, so I’ll make sure to bring honor to them.”</p>
<p>“Thank… you—”</p>
<p>She was thankful for even just that. Viola reached her hand out to him. Just then, his lips met her ear. His haggard breath seeped into her consistently pale skin.</p>
<p>Viola bit her bottom lip, her breathing also formidable.</p>
<p>“U-ugh.”</p>
<p>It was hectic. She was unmistakably captivated by his touch. Her whole body was roiling in bliss. She was so drunk on this feeling that she was dizzy. Since he had been sucking and nibbling for so long, Lustian’s face became much more laid-back. However, his lower region was expressing something contrary. His back was sticking up sturdily as his hard member touched her stomach, she trembled with surprise.</p>
