            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 75 – Aphrodisiac (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>The kiss lasted for a long while before he broke off to speak.</p>
<p>“Don’t betray my trust. At least for the duration of the contract, let’s truly love each other.”</p>
<p>Let’s truly love each other… Didn’t they covet each other in the first place because of the attraction of the body, not of the mind? What he had wanted was her body, and what he had chosen as a transaction item was also her body.</p>
<p>But unlike how he had acted before, he spoke as if he now wanted something else too.</p>
<p>“Weren’t you the one that said this is a test from the gods?” Viola asked.</p>
<p>“Right, a test. But the test results are already out now,” he said.</p>
<p>“What, that’s—”</p>
<p>“Well, what do you think I mean by that? Think about it.”</p>
<p>Lustian smiled and kissed her lips again. Little by little, a heat came over her. Every time he kissed her, a thrilling emotion rose from below. Her hips automatically hitched. It was difficult to breathe because the kiss was getting deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, the effects of the alcohol and aphrodisiac had long disappeared from her body, however, the heat at the end seemed to have remained. He climbed onto her body and kissed her in earnest.</p>
<p>The angle of her head changed countless times, and the sound of wet kisses from between their lips could be constantly heard.</p>
<p>Her body melted. As his body heated up, so did hers. He unfastened her shoulder strap. She was somewhat impressed to see he still had his underwear on, apparently not having unleashed the beast last night. He had waited for her.</p>
<p>“Viola—”</p>
<p>“Ah… mmph~”</p>
<p>“Since there might still be some aphrodisiac left over. It would be good to get rid of it completely, right?”</p>
<p>“The-there’s none left.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m sure there’s some left.”</p>
<p>His lips trailed down the nape of her neck and to her chest. She trembled, her body feeling more sensitive than usual.</p>
<p><em>Had she not fully recovered after all?</em></p>
<p>Now that she thought about it, there was no way she could be fine after her drinking contest with a prince, no less. It was even amazing that she didn’t wake up with a headache.</p>
<p>As a wave of s*xual desire passed over her, her breathing became shallow without her realizing it. As his lips gradually turned to her secret place, she grabbed his hair.</p>
<p>“Nngh… it’s strange—”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. You can moan if you want to.”</p>
<p>“Ah….” Viola covered her mouth with her hand. It was definitely strange.</p>
<p>His body was more sensitive than before, and the places where his lips touched seemed to melt like spring snow. His touch was soft. Her chin lifted up and trembled. Her whole body quivered as if convulsing, his hands paused. Then he came back up and put his lips on hers again.</p>
<p>“If it’s too difficult, I’ll do it a little later.”</p>
<p>“No… Just do it.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay if you don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“No. If it’s to get rid of this heat, please do it quickly.”</p>
<p>Suddenly he smiled widely. Why he was smiling, she couldn’t tell… but he really seemed very happy about something.</p>
<p>“It sounds like you want me. Good. Hold on to me, then.”</p>
<p>He put her hand on his shoulder then grabbed her chin and stuck their lips together hard. With hot breaths, he parted her lips with his tongue. The tongue, squeezing through as if it had been waiting, explored the inside of her mouth.</p>
<p>“Hnng… mm, ahh….”</p>
<p>As their lips touched, her trembling body wrapped itself around him as if welcoming him. She pulled away for a moment as the deep kiss made it difficult to breathe, but then he immediately grabbed her tongue again and sucked it deeply. Viola struggled with the kiss that stimulated her so deeply that her shoulders flinched. The more she angled her head, the denser the kiss became.</p>
<p>Her tightly held waist twisted and trembled. His lips turned to her ear, sucked her earlobe, then inserted his tongue into her ear and licked it. Her mind seemed to melt with his hot breaths.</p>
<p>“Ahh~”</p>
<p>His breaths made her squirm. His tongue wandering in her ear made her breaths come so heavily that she had to swallow them forcibly. His irresistible body made her spread her legs wide in front of him. Then the stiffened thing firmly penetrated inside of her.</p>
<p>“So tight… Your tight, hot flesh makes me crazy….”</p>
<p>He bit and sucked on her flesh around her neck. Her shoulders strained from the pain of his teeth on her collarbone, but he continued without stopping.</p>
<p>Caught in the midst of pleasure and rationality, she tried to hold in her moans, but when Lustian touched a certain area, a thrill quickly washed over her body.</p>
<p>“Nggh—”</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve seen you moan like this,” he spoke between his gasps.</p>
<p>“It’s not, aahh—”</p>
<p>She tried to shake her head to say that she wasn’t moaning, but at that moment he forced her to make eye contact. The eyes of a beast caught in lust came into view. Her moans caused his manhood to swell even more inside of her.</p>
<p>“Ah, aahhh-! Ahh… nng~”</p>
<p>Her repressed voice burst out of her with a moan. At his thrusts, she saw white flashes in her vision. She was helplessly dragged along with his movements. The sounds of flesh hitting flesh filled the room. She was overcome with embarrassment, but he smiled and kissed her several times in a row.</p>
<p>He drove his shaft roughly into her. As if his earlier hesitation had been a lie, he was going at it with enthusiasm now. She felt like she might pass out from his animalistic force that was quaking her whole body. As he thrust violently in and out of her core, his eyes looked like he might have slightly gone mad. She screamed with pleasure from his heavy flesh inside of her. Her body and mouth were being forced to react honestly by the residual aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>“Nngh-!”</p>
<p>Just when she thought it must be over, his hand would grab her again. The more he pulled his hips back, the faster his hand would move, and their two bodies would be more deeply connected. He moved his hips, gently rotating his rod inside of her. Viola, who had run out of patience, scratched his back with her fingernails as he kissed her.</p>
