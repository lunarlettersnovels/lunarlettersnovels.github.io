            <p><strong>Chapter 151</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>But Viola tried to persuade them with her strong resolution.</p>
<p>After a while, the king and queen could be seen standing on the rostrum. They had left the golden chair empty. The person who was to grace it wasn’t the master of the kingdom but the Empress of the Arpen Empire, Viola. It was accepted that the status of the king of a kingdom was lower than the imperial family of the suzerain, but Viola didn’t sit there.</p>
<p>“Why….”</p>
<p>“The reason I came here is to have a treaty with the Kingdom of Ramond as an equal, so that chair isn’t my chair.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>The king tilted his head. The other royals were looking at each other. Their faces became dark. It seems like they thought this was another way of threatening.</p>
<p>“Ok. Then let’s do this. King, come up with me.”</p>
<p>As Viola winked at the princess the latter quickly realized and grabbed the king’s arm. Then the knights brought two gold chairs and put them on the same level. It wasn’t hard to notice the meaning of this. The royals opened their eyes wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Viola got on the rostrum and sat beside the King of Ramond. As the empress who was representing the emperor sat on the same level, it was reassuring that they were on equal footing. The place noisy as they couldn’t believe their eyes.</p>
<p>When Viola nodded to Ivan, he sat on the rostrum and stood beside her. Then Paul brought a huge parchment. Ivan read what was written on the parchment loudly.</p>
<p>“Lustian Carl Ellaime, Emperor of the Arpen Empire, requests an alliance with the Kingdom of Ramond. As the symbol of an alliance, the tax that was levied would be gone and I announce that the Kingdom of Ramond is an independent kingdom. As an allied country, there will be freedom of economic and cultural exchange, and lastly when either of the kingdoms is in danger, the other will support with 20,000 soldiers. I send my empress as the representative to the Kingdom of Ramond, hoping that both countries will become friends by signing this peace treaty.”</p>
<p>The palace became suddenly rowdy due to such an outrageous peace treaty. The kingdom was gaining quite a bit through the peace treaty, but the Arpen Empire wasn’t losing anything either. It was because of Lustian’s final request.</p>
<p>It was up to the king whether they would believe or not believe. The King of Ramond’s expression was a lot more comfortable than when Viola first arrived. When the princess whispered into his ears, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll ask you one thing. Does this mean that you won’t hold the crown prince as a hostage?”</p>
<p>“Of course. But it will take some time for them to return to the kingdom.”</p>
<p>“What… Do you mean—”</p>
<p>Viola couldn’t tell him about the impending war between God and humans. Of course, she wanted to release the crown princes, but it was they who refused.</p>
<p>“We will need someone to lead the soldiers sent by the Kingdom of Ramond. I can’t tell you in explicit details but soon there will be a huge storm.”</p>
<p>“By storm, you mean—”</p>
<p>Their faces turned white. In their expression, Viola remembered the conversation she had with the crown princes.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Perhaps…. The reason you need an army is because of God’s Companion? To…. Save you?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“How… how did you know?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“…. Eight years ago, that was the reason why we went against the Arpen Empire.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“So, my father did know!”</strong></em></p>
<p>She found out that the secret of God’s Companion was a public secret after meeting with the princes. Viola understood why the King of Koronis told her to hide well.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, every country allied to kill Lustian. They had one goal- everlasting peace and ridding themselves of suffering.</p>
<p><em><strong>“I also felt the same as you princes. I sacrificed my beloved blood and flesh. I had to spend eight years to forgive him. It was hard to forgive the empire. I understand. But don’t we have a common goal? Peace, a peace that can be kept for generations to come.”</strong></em></p>
<p>The princes quietly listened to Viola. She wasn’t representing anyone but talked about the princesses that were sacrificed after coming here as the candidate of God’s Companion.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘The many princesses that were sent to the Arpen Empire… It’s time to show that their sacrifice wasn’t in vain. It’s time to have a peace treaty. It is now.”</strong></em></p>
<p>The princes nodded vigorously. And they promised to help with all their might if a war started.</p>
<p>The king of Ramond grabbed Lustian’s offer. And gladly accepted the alliance. As they became a formal ally, he officialized it and threw a party. Whoaaaa! They could hear the roar.</p>
<p>As the Arpen Empire and the Kingdom of Ramond signed a peace treaty for the first time, it was smooth sailing thereon. When Lustian’s peace treaty was confirmed as true, the next kingdom sent a messenger asking her to come quickly.</p>
<p>Viola’s flourish didn’t end there. She became sisters with the Kingdom of Ramond’s princess to show that their friendship was as strong as blood-related. The princess brought her to the farm she personally grew and showed her humble side. Viola was proud of her changed personality.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>As the moon came up, Lustian was teleported to Viola’s room. The place he came to after following the coordinates on Viola’s ring was the guest room in the Kingdom of Ramond. Nobody knew that the Emperor of Arpen was teleported here.</p>
<p>“Viola—”</p>
<p>“Welcome! We signed our first treaty.”</p>
<p>“I heard. It was so loud that I could hear the roar from our palace.”</p>
<p>Viola giggled in his arms. She knew it was a lie, but she didn’t want to bother telling him.</p>
<p>“People will be surprised if they knew you’re here… But I’m a little curious, why didn’t you come personally to sign the treaty? You can move at night?”</p>
<p>“Are you asking because you really don’t know?”</p>
