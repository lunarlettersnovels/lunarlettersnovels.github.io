            <p><strong>Chapter 165</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Yo-Your Majesty! How can you say such a thing…?!”</p>
<p>“The fact that the annexes who are meant to pray for the protection of this land will not serve their master is contradictory. If you want to serve your God, I will not stop you, but I cannot accept the fact that I will have to serve Him too. So if you don’t want my wrath, you will have to leave.”</p>
<p>His unfeeling voice echoed throughout the temple. In case Wendy would be frightened by Lustian raising his voice, he covered her ears and spoke softly. In a low and stern voice, he gave them an ultimatum.</p>
<p>“I intend to break the vow myself. I do not intend to challenge God, but I am simply taking control of my destiny. Even if something awaits me at the end, I will not back down. You must remember that it is your duty to pray for the victory of the emperor, not God.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>The annexes were at a loss for words. Lustian said nothing wrong. It was indeed their duty to serve the Emperor of the Arpen Empire. To avoid eye contact with him, most of them lay flat on the ground to create a path for the Emperor. However, the head of the annexes would not stop glaring at him.</p>
<p>“Even if you promote God’s Companion, nothing will change….”</p>
<p>The head of the annexes tried to maintain composure so that the others couldn’t see through him. However, the aura emanating from his body very clearly showed his hostility. It was subtle, but Viola could feel it.</p>
<p><em>I was never doubtful of the fact that now that Lustian has become the Grand Master he likely senses their disrespect.</em></p>
<p>Even after he stopped looking at the head, it seemed that they were pouting.</p>
<p>“Since it’s Emperor’s orders… of course, I shall follow suit, but no matter how much you try to shut us up, the truth can’t be concealed. In moments of trouble, the one who will be struggling will be you, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Now that we are one, we can get through any trial. Is that not so, Empress?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>To calm her weak and heavy heart, she held her head high to hold herself together. Then, the emperor stood right next to her as a display of determination.</p>
<p>“It will not go your way. God won’t just sit back and do nothing about this.”</p>
<p>“I am the one who will be waiting. I am always ready to accept a challenge. I should stop meeting the previous Empress. You must pray for her recovery.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>The annexes escaped from the hole. As soon as they went away, Viola exhaled heavily. It was undeniable that she was nervous. If it weren’t for Lustian, she would not know how to face them…</p>
<p>Lustian held Wendy in his arms as he grabbed Viola’s hand. As a tightly knit family, there was nothing they couldn’t get through.</p>
<p>After catching her breath outside of the previous Empress’s room, the room opened wide. Her heart was thumping. Slipping into the room, she saw the empress lying in the bed. Even knowing the imperial couple would be paying her a visit, she would not come out of her room. All that could be seen was her shadow.</p>
<p>Lustian couldn’t say anything. She intended to wait until she looked after both of them. However, the one to approach her first was Wendy. Before Viola could grab her, she was already walking to the bed.</p>
<p>“We-Wendy!”</p>
<p>Just as Wendy would always approach her parents, she jumped up on the bed and hugged her. Viola was so shocked that her heart sank. Lustian seemed nervous as he opened and closed his fists.</p>
<p>“Wh-Who do you think you are?”</p>
<p>“Grandmother, I’m Wendy.”</p>
<p>“We-Wendy?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Today is a happy day, for I found my mother and father. But Father told me that I have a grandmother.”</p>
<p>The previous empress sat up. She turned her body to the little girl. It appeared that she was holding Wendy’s second embroidery in her hand. Flinching, she looked at her. As soon as she got the present, she could hear the little girl’s laughter.</p>
<p>Without even noticing, her hand went to touch her. Her hands slithered across all of the child’s contours. She made a small noise.</p>
<p>“Ah… there is a resemblance here. You look like the previous empress! You….”</p>
<p>Thinking that perhaps she was opening up, Wendy hugged her again and called her grandmother. She seemed taken aback, but soon enough, her hands were wrapped around Wendy’s small shoulders.</p>
<p>She was about to weep. No matter how much she tried to hide it, Viola was tearing. <em>What if I had admitted it sooner… What if I had approached her sooner…. Why didn’t I think of it?!</em></p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“What Mother needs right now is Wendy, not us. Let them have time to themselves.”</p>
<p>“Should we?”</p>
<p>“Trust me.”</p>
<p>Viola and Lustian left the room quietly. But since they were still worried, Wendy was still wandering about the halls. Then, the maids saw that the previous empress busily rushing inside. They were holding a huge, silver plate, and from it was the delicious smell of snacks. Finally, it seemed that Viola’s shoulders weren’t as tense.</p>
<p>“She must want to have a snack with Wendy. I told her before that grandmother cannot have meals.”</p>
<p>“Our Wendy is such a smart and wise child. The Kingdom of Koronis can be left in her hands.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm… Then do all of our children become King?”</p>
<p>“I could just be greedy.”</p>
