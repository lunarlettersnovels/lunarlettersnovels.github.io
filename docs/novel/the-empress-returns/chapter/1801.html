            <p><strong>Chapter 105</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Ivan’s eyes folded gently. Viola held in a scream, grinding her teeth.</p>
<p>“Now I can’t ever reverse what’s been done, but it’s still unfortunate. After all, if I were the crown prince, you would’ve been my wife.”</p>
<p>“What are you….”</p>
<p>“I was the one who wanted to be the crown prince. However, God chose him and He gave him the sign to look for His companion.”</p>
<p>“——” Viola looked at Ivan intently. Ivan had a softer look than before.</p>
<p>“Finally it seems like I can tell you the truth. The truth is, I was the one who served the final gateway of the crown prince training.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me? Wh-what do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>Viola was frightened out of her wits. Her heart was trembling, as she wondered what the other was trying to say. Her eyelids fluttered quickly, cold sweat trickled down her back. Without realizing it, she was pressing on her palms with her fingernails. Then she involuntarily rubbed her arm.</p>
<p>Ivan looked at Viola with gentle eyes. “Deceiving the eyes of Father and the Pope, I switched roles with him in the bedroom.”</p>
<p>Viola covered her mouth with her hand. She let out a soft moan.</p>
<p><em>‘Swapping places unbeknownst to the emperor?’</em></p>
<p><em>Then, in that case… you mean tell me that all of the candidates that entered thus far were all Ivan’s women… I have too much to worry about.</em></p>
<p>“Ah, except one person. Although Guinev is a special case….”</p>
<p><em>Guinev?</em></p>
<p>According to Anne, Guinev escaped before the final gateway. However, unbeknownst to her, Guinev spent the first night together with Lustian.</p>
<p><em>‘She’d always leave at nightfall as if she had somewhere to be….’</em></p>
<p>She thought of what Anne said. She had to pass through the magic barrier if she went out of the palace in secret, so she might’ve met up with Lustian.</p>
<p><em>‘Yes, it had to be that… Just like me… As if it was fate, I met him before I fulfilled the six month period.’</em></p>
<p>She felt somewhat deflated, but she didn’t want to take it to heart. Even if he did spend his first night with Guinev, it was better to think that he was just fulfilling his duties as the crown prince. After meeting her, he was a man who was only in love with himself.</p>
<p><em>‘I don’t care about it. I wasn’t aiming to ask about the past anyway. And as for the day that Guinev waited for him in that wedding dress….’</em></p>
<p>Viola bit her lip hard, then shook her head side to side to get rid of the image of the way he had looked at her.</p>
<p>Just then, she felt something stir. When she turned around, Lustian towered over her. He was looking at Ivan with a frightening chill that shot down from above.</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth. Would you like it if I made sure you’re unable to open that mouth again?”</p>
<p>“Lu-Lun….”</p>
<p>“Come here, Viola.”</p>
<p>When he stretched his hand out, she went to him. Lustian grabbed her hand and promptly hid her behind his body. Covered by his wide shoulders, she couldn’t see Ivan’s face, but she could feel the cold tension in the air.</p>
<p><em>Has there been a rift in their brotherhood these past eight years? Why? What on earth could’ve happened….</em></p>
<p>She could feel his hand shaking slightly while she was grabbing it.</p>
<p><em>‘Why… what’s wrong? What are you so afraid of?’</em></p>
<p>The questions were endless, but they had ended up being unasked. The reason being Lustian grabbed her hand and led her into the imperial palace.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>They didn’t engage in any sexual acts. They merely held each other while they slept through the night. There were so many questions she wanted to ask but she couldn’t.</p>
<p><em>‘Why? Why didn’t you tell me? The fact that this isn’t your imperial palace….’</em></p>
<p>She was wondering, but she chose to believe that he had his reasons. Her heart fluttered. It felt like a dream to be in his arms.</p>
<p>When Lustian left, several maids were preparing for Viola’s grooming. When she left it up to them, she turned into the one and only beautiful Empress. As soon as they were done, Kyle came in as if he had been waiting.</p>
<p>“Which palace did Rosha, Wendy, and Paul go to?”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Kyle pursed his lips.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask you again. I am asking as the Empress. Knight Kyle, where are my people trapped?”</p>
<p>“Princess Wendy and Rosha were ordered to stay in the crown prince’s palace. Paul was sent to the workhouse.”</p>
<p>“The wor-workhouse?”</p>
<p>“Yes, all those who commit a crime will receive the same punishment. It is no different for royalty. The old castle will be refurbished to be used as manpower.”</p>
<p>“He can’t even exert himself yet.”</p>
<p>“He has recovered from the wounds. The emperor himself gave him the healing stone.”</p>
<p>“Oh….”</p>
<p>What happened to Paul was unfortunate, but the healing stone should’ve helped him recover. It was a bit surprising that such an expensive piece of jewelry was given to her loyal knight.</p>
<p>“Very well. Now, what is to become of me? Will I always be trapped in the Empress’s Palace, unable to go outside?”</p>
<p>“You, my empress, are not a prisoner. You can go anywhere and do as you wish.”</p>
<p>“I-is that so? Was I not meant to be trapped?”</p>
<p>“No. However, the workhouse over in the Western region is the place where the prisoners are gathered, so you cannot go there.”</p>
<p>The gloom lacing Viola’s face disappeared. ‘<em>Freedom! I thought it would be all over for me once I’m back here, but that isn’t the case now.’</em></p>
