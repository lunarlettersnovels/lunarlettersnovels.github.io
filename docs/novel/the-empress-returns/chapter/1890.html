            <p><strong>Chapter 137</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>As Lustian grew further away from her side, Viola’s fever went up as if it had been waiting for the right time. Rosha and the nanny had been busy since the morning. Viola was preoccupied with trying to deal with her aches and looking after Wendy. Looking at the both of them* made her smile without noticing it herself. Although they were aunt and niece, they looked uncannily similar. It made sense to leave her to the nanny instead of to any other maid.</p>
<p>[*Nanny and Rosha… they are aunt n niece]</p>
<p>Viola looked at the nanny as she accepted the spoonful of soup that she fed her. “Nanny, I have to ask. Do you by any chance remember the nobleman that came to see us when we used to live in the forest?”</p>
<p>“Nobleman? Who? There was not a single person that came looking for you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it was a dream… He was a very tall man. He found me and Edward when we were playing in the woods and left after leaving some very ominous words behind.”</p>
<p>As the nanny was tying a ribbon around Wendy’s hair, her face suddenly turned white. “Why are you talking about this now? Did someone truly come to find you two?”</p>
<p>“At the time, I assumed that he was sent by the palace to keep an eye on us both. Last night I dreamt of that time.”</p>
<p>“What… did he say? The nobleman, I mean.”</p>
<p>“That we were very valuable people, that we have royal blood running through us.”</p>
<p>The nanny’s eyes went wide. However, she acted as if it held no significance.</p>
<p>“It is true that you have valuable blood. After all, you are both royalty. He was simply stating a fact, so pay it no mind.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose so.”</p>
<p>While the nanny went back to touching up Wendy’s hair, Viola felt something about her actions seemed odd. It was odd that she, who didn’t lose her composure even in front of Lustian, reacted so strongly to what was said. The nanny’s hands quivered. She was about to call out to her but then stopped herself. It looked like she didn’t want to be reminded of something specific.</p>
<p>Viola closed her eyes again. She could not fall asleep. Her dreams were strangely vivid. As Wendy got on the bed, she could hear the nanny scolding her. She insisted that she would catch a cold, but her voice was soft as she was saying it.</p>
<p>“Please don’t fall ill… Your Highness. Hnnn….”</p>
<p>“Wendy….”</p>
<p>She touched her small, adorable cheeks. Wendy was still the princess of the Kingdom of Koronis, and she was Viola’s sister. She and Lustian had decided to keep it a secret for a while for her safety. She felt it was pitiful that the little girl could not call them mommy and daddy even though they were right there.</p>
<p>“Let me hold you for a moment.” She held the tiny body. As she parted her ebony hair, she could feel her nose well up.</p>
<p>Lustian came back to the empress’s palace. It seemed that he found out that she was sick given that he came over with a doctor. He held Wendy and comforted her. “The empress needs her rest. Let me play with you.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>After sleeping for half a day, she finally felt well. Viola called Paul over.</p>
<p>“Paul. Yesterday, I dreamt of Edward.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Through the dream, he told me to not be afraid.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Paul was just as much of a brilliant and trustworthy knight as Edward was to her. He had served Viola as if she were his king. Only her could carry out her plans.</p>
<p>The previous night, Viola seemed to be deep in thought, unlike Lustian who was asleep. She could vividly remember the text on the parchment. She intended to not neglect the fact that his duties would soon become hers. For that reason, she needed much more information. She intended to interact with more people of the imperial family.</p>
<p>“I must go meet Her Majesty. It may be too late, but I haven’t greeted her once ever since I became Empress. Be ready.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>At the same time, a letter of correspondence arrived at the Kingdom of Koronis. It was about the fact that Lustian found out about Wendy’s identity. Simultaneously, there was also news of how it was certain that Viola was indeed God’s Companion.</p>
<p>The King of Koronis’ face scrunched up. Just then, the naked woman lying next to him started laughing.</p>
<p>“How could they think they wouldn’t get caught? So then what becomes of us? If this is the case, doesn’t the Arpen Empire have to continue receiving God’s blessing?”</p>
<p>“That won’t be the case. If the worse comes to worst, I am also thinking of extorting Viola.”</p>
<p>“Ho ho ho. Your Highness, do you really think that’s possible? Do not underestimate Viola. Did you not fail multiple times?”</p>
<p>“I cannot give up on this golden opportunity. We have a chance to swallow the Arpen Empire whole. Hu hu… If it doesn’t collapse on its own, we’ll have to make sure it does.”</p>
<p>The naked woman rubbed her bre*sts against his gr*in. Soon though, there was a lustful glint in the king’s eyes. He thrust his swollen manhood into the woman’s hole.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, ah… As expected, the king I have chosen is certainly special. I expected the children to be special, but they turned out to be fools. Ahhhh! Your Highness… Aghhhh….”</p>
<p>Both of their m*ans echoed through the den.</p>
<p>There was a person who could hear their mo*ns. From the middle of the wide hall, the woman staring at them intensely was the Queen of Koronis. Her face was beet red. It was because of erotic moans coming from the den.</p>
<p>“He’s a cruel man. You will be cursed. It’s appalling and disgusting. It’s as disgusting as that bloodline.”</p>
