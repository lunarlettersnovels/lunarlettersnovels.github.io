            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 3 – Bitter Beginnings</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Condition? Did you just say condition?” The queen’s face turned venomous. “Ha, how insolent!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola’s gaze never wavered. “The only person that can command me is the king. I only listen to Father’s commands.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wh-what? You, right now, just … I tolerated sending a mere half-royal-blooded princess as our kingdom’s princess and you—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola’s spite, which she had never had until after losing Edward, flared up. If anyone had been behind his death, the queen was definitely not uninvolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edward, who was born a prince but could not be a crown prince, died on the battlefield as a nameless knight. Viola had been the only one to mourn the loss of a beloved one that day, and she felt indescribable sadness at his unjust death. At the same time, together with the honor they lost …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola pulled out the dagger given to her by the king and held it out, making the queen tremble in shock.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as I have this dagger, I am second only to the king in the Kingdom of Koronis. So, the only person who can command me is the king.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The queen glared at Viola whose lips curled in ridicule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The queen’s family and the Kingdom of Koronis were not particularly close allies. She didn’t know why, but the king was very uncomfortable talking about the queen’s family. Knowing that, Viola raised her chin confidently in front of her</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I want is nothing difficult to fulfill. Please move Edward’s grave to the Royal Cemetery as soon as you receive the news.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♛</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola absentmindedly stared at her reflection in the mirror. Looking back at her was a beautiful face at the peak of her womanhood.  Her hidden charm unmasked as she grew from a girl to a woman. Her clear, unblemished skin, blue eyes like a still lake, shimmering locks, and mature body could not be hidden.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Viola, although we are only half-royal, we are still royalty of this kingdom. Always remember that your name is Viola Meriandis Lapon. Don’t forget that you can also be crowned …’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her heart throbbed. Those were Edward’s last words to her before he died. The more she thought of him, the more her heart ached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was then that Viola’s nanny burst into the room. She had been away at her parents’ home before the king’s visit but came running as soon as she heard the news. The older woman hugged Viola in her arms and sobbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah … Princess … Do you know how I raised you, Princess? What do you mean you have to go to the enemy as a hostage?! What kind of news is this out of the blue?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nanny—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I can’t let you go. I can’t let you! No … I will make a formal plea to the king. I will stop this even if it costs me my head.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nanny had raised the two of them on behalf of their late mother. Viola understood her feelings. The day her mother died and they were cast out to the frightening woods flashed across her mind …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been very cold that day. She had shuddered at the biting frost that gnawed at her skin as they walked through the white, snow-covered fields. Kicking them out of the palace was essentially the same as sentencing them to death. The two children were told to trek deep into the forest where it would have been hard for even a carriage to reach; however, their nanny had clenched her teeth and held the two children in her arms, using her own body temperature to warm up their frozen bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They walked like that until they arrived at a place that resembled a dark and gloomy castle. It was an abandoned palace without any stores of firewood, so they had to burn the chairs for warmth. Once that ran out, they tore apart the wooden flooring and set that on fire as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola assured the older woman in a soothing voice, “It’s alright. Nanny, I will surely make Edward’s dream come true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess—” The nanny’s voice trailed off, knowing how resolute the woman before her could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have no intention of becoming the enemy’s concubine, so I will make sure to be ordered to depart after the training period is over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you really … okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola had a pretty smile on her face as she looked at her nanny’s tear-stained face, “Who am I? I am the sister of Prince Edward, whose abilities were on par with the masters’. I have at least enough power to protect my body with the swordsmanship he taught me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I won’t crumble. I won’t hesitate or waver. I will restore my lost identity and claim the throne.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola stood with her back erect and chest forward as she looked at her nanny. The nanny nodded with pride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have something I prepared for you, Princess.” She turned to the door and called out. “Rosha.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The door opened and a girl clad in shabby clothes entered. With a timid look on her face, she greeted Viola according to court etiquette. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was she nervous? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of lightly grabbing the hem of her skirt, she grabbed the inner skirt as she bowed, clearly showing her ankles.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This child is—”  Viola began, trying to remember the familiar face of the girl before her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you remember? Princess, she visited you once when you were young.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah … that little kid is this big now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosha was a girl who looked about sixteen. If Viola remembered correctly, she had come to the abandoned castle to find her aunt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an honor to see you again, Princess.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her smiling face oozed with kindness, looking naive as if unstained by the world. The aura Viola felt radiating from her reminded her of the warmth of the spring season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see you are still that child with that same vibrant energy. It’s nice to see you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola reached her hand out to Rosha, and the latter, blushing and laughing with a bright smile, grabbed hers in return. They lightly shook hands, and soon a smile bloomed on both their faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You won’t be lonely going there by yourself. This child will be a friend who will stay by your side, Princess. She is the child of a fallen noble, but please don’t let that bother you. Her hands are fast and agile, so she will be able to help you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I promise that when I return home, I will restore the status you lost because of the two of us, Nanny.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would be happy with you just coming back safely,” the nanny said as she nodded her head. “I have no other wish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosha then took out something and put it on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m trying to undermine your appearance. This child will apply makeup for you in the future, Princess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My appearance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I paid for some information. I heard that the Arpen royalty have a weakness for blondes. Your full, bright, beautiful hair will attract too much attention, so let’s first start by dyeing it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosha began quite dexterously applying color to her hair. Her skills with makeup were also astounding. The pretty face that Viola had seen in the mirror just a moment ago disappeared in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♛♛♛</span></p>
