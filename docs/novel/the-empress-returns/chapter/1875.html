            <p><strong>Chapter 152</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>He lifted her chin softly and kissed her on the lips. Her eyes melted.</p>
<p>“Can I brag? You don’t seem trustworthy.”</p>
<p>“Pfft. Yes, you can brag all you want. It’s true.”</p>
<p>Their lips met and mixed lewdly. She was happy that they could meet even just once a day like this. Tonight, there was a party that was going late, but she came back early to her room to meet him.</p>
<p>They’d only gathered 20,000 soldiers, and there were many kingdoms left. The only kingdom that didn’t agree with her plan was the Kingdom of Luanna. There were eyes that were watching so Anne went to persuade the king herself, but she wasn’t expecting much. If many kingdoms gathered their soldiers, they could probably gather around 200,000 soldiers.</p>
<p>Could they really fight against an army led by God? They were worried, but they could also fill in more soldiers. Out of all the kingdoms, the Kingodm of Koronis had the largest army. The only reason they were able to withstand 200 years of war with the Arpen Empire was that they had a strong army to stand against the Blood Army. It was up to Viola to persuade her father. She wasn’t sure he would allow his army to go, but she picked her homeland as the last destination.</p>
<p>Lustian bit her earlobes as she was in her thoughts. Then he tempted her by breathing hot into her ear. His hands were groping her br*asts.</p>
<p>“My empress is smart and wise. If you talk to the crowd with that beautiful tongue, everyone will fall for you.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The news of the two kingdoms signing a peace treaty spread rapidly. The entire continent was talking within a day. The King of Koronis was enraged at the news. Crash, the spear broke. The accessories the king threw scattered across the floor.</p>
<p>“How stupid! You can swallow the Arpen Empire without doing anything, and they’re just kicking away their chances!”</p>
<p>The King of Koronis was furious. He was angry that one by one, all the kingdoms that were his allies were trying to become allies with the Arpen Empire. He couldn’t sit and kept pacing about.</p>
<p>“If you got rid of her in the first place, this wouldn’t have happened. What glory did you expect that you let her live? You wouldn’t have to worry if you got rid of her like Edward.” The woman scoffed. She was the woman that was enjoying a secret affair with the King of Koronis.</p>
<p>He rested his chin on his hand while frowning. “I let her live because she was a girl. If Viola was a boy, I would’ve gotten rid of her. Anyways she will come to Koronis too… What should I do? What happened to him? How did someone who was about to die live?”</p>
<p>“Fu, who knows… You’re so cruel. She’s still your blood-related daughter, no?”</p>
<p>“She’s a shame as a daughter of a slave. If it weren’t for me, that woman would’ve been sold to a brothel or spread her legs to smelly old men.” He twisted his mouth meanly.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it because of her wealth that the Kingdom of Koronis Kingdom was able to grow like this? Even though her root is in a small country, but she was from the oldest royal bloodline in Slovenia.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the Arpen Empire that went on conquests. There was a small kingdom by the northern outskirt of Koronis. Koronis took over that kingdom two decades ago. After they took over, the entire royal family was executed, and some became slaves. Some of the princesses, as sex slaves, became concubines of the Koronis nobles or were sold to brothels.</p>
<p>Viola’s mother was one of them. She was the only heir of the royal family, so if the kingdom didn’t collapse, she would’ve become the queen.</p>
<p>“Instead of thanking, she drove me nuts. Each time she saw me, she had a horrible face. Like she was looking at a monster… I don’t even want to think about it. She was spiteful.”</p>
<p>The eing recalled the woman who killed herself by setting her palace on fire while refusing him until the end. Rage surged within him. He treasured her the most, but she betrayed him. She was caught trying to rule over the leftover nobles from her erstwhile kingdom. He still didn’t want to kill her, but she killed herself to stop him from publicizing it.</p>
<p>“… I remember. She was very beautiful. Enough to make the queen jealous.”</p>
<p>“She was as cold as beautiful. Had she listened to me, I would’ve made Edward the crown prince… Tsk  tsk….”</p>
<p><em><strong>“My children…. Restore their status. To have them live in the Kingdom of Koronis as royals….”</strong></em></p>
<p>She asked for an absurd request even though she knew that the children from slave mothers couldn’t be royals. She was worried about her children until her death. The day her white hand was completely burned, the king’s heart was also incinerated. The rage that was coming within him watching the dead woman couldn’t be handled. He kicked out the children from the castle as if he was expressing resentment to the woman who died without saying she loved him.</p>
<p>“But aren’t they still your flesh and blood?”</p>
<p>“If their blood is more like mine, then they should be more like me. All my children who are a threat to me are basically tying themselves to my neck.”</p>
