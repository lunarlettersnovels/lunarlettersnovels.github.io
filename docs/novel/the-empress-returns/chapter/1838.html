<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 68 – Surrender (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Seeing his pleasure, she felt more confident and put his prong in her mouth again. It was too large to fit entirely in her mouth — she could only fit about a third of it. Then she sucked with all her might.</p>
<p>“Nghh… Viola….”</p>
<p>His fingers gently caressed her head. His voice, filled with l*st and pleasure, was shockingly attractive. His hand passed down below her shoulder and grasped one of her pe*ks.</p>
<p><em>Mmm…</em></p>
<p>A m*an escaped from her lips. This was not easy. His sh*ft became wet with his pr*cum and her s*liva.</p>
<p>“Mmm, nngh~”</p>
<p>Viola pushed his rod into her mouth as far as it would go, to the back of her throat. At this, his thighs thrust forward.</p>
<p>“Augh, mm… that’s good. Viola… nngh~”</p>
<p>His trembling hips were so s*xu*l. It seemed he was truly enjoying her crude attempts to suck his c*ck. His heavy breathing and body movements became rougher. She momentarily felt a pang of nerves as his p*nis thrust almost deep enough to choke her, but she just sucked even harder. She was impressed by his movements that seemed to pull back at just the right time before choking her with his sha*t.</p>
<p>“Nngh… I know it’s your first time… How can you be so good?”</p>
<p>He was complimenting her imperfect attempt at sucking him. Of course, there was no way she could be perfect at something she had never done before. If he was satisfied with her work, then she would only have to let him enter her one time tonight. The more pleasure he seemed to feel, the more excitement she felt.</p>
<p>His hands came down and fondled her m*unds once more. When he gently twisted her hardened n*pples, the area between her thighs dampened. Her core tingled. He didn’t seem to care at all about the fact that there were servants right outside the door. Seeing this, she knew that he was just another of those royals who would regularly enjoy org*es with his concubines.</p>
<p>As she sucked on his meat, Viola glanced up at him. He was raking his hair, wet with sweat, away from his face. Watching him wipe his mouth with a sweaty hand invoked in her a feeling of catharsis. His sturdy and handsome muscles moved rhythmically. His m*ans, unmuffled, seemed to fill her ears with his l*st. He grabbed the back of her head and thrust his hips forward again and again, gradually gaining speed quickly.</p>
<p>Viola gave it all she had, and sucked hard on his*m*nhood. Suddenly, his movements stopped. Then, all at once, his come flooded the inside of her mouth. The force of his org*sm splattered all over her throat, the roof of her mouth, everywhere. And though she didn’t want to, it forced her to swallow it all.</p>
<p>She coughed but was interrupted by her chin being lifted up. Their eyes met. Lustian had the eyes of a predator locked in on his prey.</p>
<p>“Did I keep you waiting? Now it’s my turn.”</p>
<p>Then suddenly, their positions were switched. His sh*ft had already become stiff once more and searched for her warm inner flesh. He licked his lips, filled with excitement. He was not one to be satisfied with a simple, imperfect act of oral s*x. He spoke as he rubbed his hardened rod against the wet lips of her cave, his fluid dripped between the folds of her dainty femininity.</p>
<p>“Nnngh… aaah~”</p>
<p>“M*an. No one will hear you. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, her hips were turned around, and he penetrated her strongly from behind. In powerful bursts, he thrust forward several times. She could hear the sound of flesh hitting flesh inside of her. The pleasure that she felt was strong and uncontainable. His huge p*nis perfectly hit her pleasure points with every thrust.</p>
<p>Her consciousness nearly wavered. A wave of red heat rode quickly up her spine and crashed against her brain. Her whole body shook and was pushed forward with each plunge. His skin rubbed against her bottom and he continually moved his hips. He kissed her all along the neck and sucked at her flesh. Like an animal in heat, he rubbed his body against hers without stopping. She couldn’t even think.</p>
<p>“Mmn, nnngh—”</p>
<p>“Unngh – nnnh-”</p>
<p>As she peaked to the strongest org*sm she had ever felt, she felt a wave of haziness fall over her. Lustian’s strong thrusts that seemed to exercise complete control of her own body had nearly driven her insane. The lower half of her body was taut. Every time his shaft rhythmically pushed into her, her body involuntarily twitched with pleasure. She felt dizzy. Even when she was about to barely return to her senses, he did not stop. He licked her lips and thrust his tongue into her mouth, pressing his kisses into her ceaselessly.</p>
<p>“Aaah!”</p>
<p>“Nnngh… mmmm~”</p>
<p>Her body was flipped once more. He wrapped his legs around her hips, then dove mercilessly into her. He shoved his tongue deep into her mouth and sucked hard on her lips. His thick tongue swept the inside of her mouth, twisted around her tongue, and sucked. Their breaths came in gasps.</p>
<p>As he plunged into her, she had no place for her hands to hold, she could only desperately cling to his back.</p>
<p><em>So strong.</em></p>
<p>His unbelievably strong movements gave her goosebumps. Every time he would thrust his h*ps forward so forcefully, she felt a wave of pleasure travel from the top of her head to the tips of her toes. At the intensity of everything that she was feeling, tears sprang to her eyes. He licked up even her tears as if he was dying of thirst.</p>
<p>“Ahh.. nnngh~”</p>
<p>The intensity and depth of his thrusts made Viola gasp for breath. She had no time to catch her breath. As she looked up at him through the ceaseless movements of their bodies, even as her vision trembled, the one thing she could see was the corners of his mouth twisted down into a frown.</p>
<p>.<em>..Is it not good for you? Aren’t you enjoying yourself enough?</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>This man, now that he wasn’t concealing his identity, seemed to simply act without thinking.</p>
<p>He had kept his promise of only doing the deed once last night, but he had followed her to her bedchambers and slept next to her. When she opened her eyes and saw his firm chest, she was shocked awake.</p>
<p>Looking at the angle of the sunlight filtering into the room, she could tell it was late morning. She had slept in. It was Lustian’s body that was holding her down in bed, but it was Viola who had slept without realizing the time.</p>
<p>She pushed his body away from her slightly. At first it seemed like he was easily getting pushed, but then suddenly his arm reached out and grabbed her waist, pulling her close to him again. Her nose was pressed against his muscled chest. “I know you’re awake, so let me go.”</p>
<p>“Get some more sleep,” he merely mumbled back.</p>
<p>“I’m late.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me.” She did not call his name. Whether his real name or fake name, she didn’t feel like saying either one of them.</p>
<p>Viola tried to push his chest away with a little more force, but this time his thighs wrapped around her body like a vice grip.</p>
<p><em>Did he train his leg muscles separately somehow?</em> This was the thought she had as she felt nearly suffocated by the force of his steel-like thigh muscles.</p></div>
