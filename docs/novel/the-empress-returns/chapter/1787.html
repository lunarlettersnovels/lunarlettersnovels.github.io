            <p><strong>Chapter 119 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p><em>Agh, agh.</em> Moans came flowing out of Lustian’s mouth as well.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!! Mmmmm!!”</p>
<p>Coquettish voices slipped out of both their mouths and resonated in the bathroom. It was hectic. An inexplicable electrifying feeling overcame Viola, her fingernails dug into his skin. Every time the other’s back raised aggressively and filled her up inside, she gasped.</p>
<p>“Mmmm, mmmm….”</p>
<p>Lustian’s tongue sought her mouth. Their entangled tongues rubbed against each other frantically. Her whole body twisted around, her heart was pounding. At the same time, his hard member squeezed through her hole. From the end of his gl*ns, a slippery mucus burst forth, filling up the dry area.</p>
<p>Viola’s back shivered. The eyes of the man breathing heavily were soft, but at times they were also sharp. The strong pleasure that spread through every inch of her body made it hard for her to breathe.</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Half-asleep, she tried feeling for her side but noticed that Lustian wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Right then, Viola heard a strange noise. It sounded like a repressed moan. Surprised, she got up and looked for the source of the sound. She focused on the sound more and more. As she did, she realized it was coming from the office that was connected all the way to the bedroom.</p>
<p><em>Lune…</em></p>
<p>To see what he was doing, she went inside but stopped herself. He was drinking something. He was hastily gulping from the black bottle he took out. The sight shocked Viola. Seeing that he was holding onto his chest in pain, she tried going up to him, but Kyle emerged from the shadows. She hid and watched them.</p>
<p>“Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Quiet. The empress might stir. Think of what to tell her as I’ll have to go to the Lake of God.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t the empress by your side? Go to Her Highness….”</p>
<p>“No, I can’t.”</p>
<p>Viola couldn’t breathe. Her heart was breaking seeing the amount of pain he was in. This was the second time she had witnessed his chronic illness with her own eyes, but it seemed that the condition of his disease had deteriorated since she last saw it 8 years ago.</p>
<p>Right then, something unexpected came out of Kyle’s mouth.</p>
<p>“She is the only one who can put Your Highness’s pain to rest. Please do seek help from the empress.”</p>
<p>Viola swallowed her breath.</p>
<p><em>The one who can put his pain to rest… Is that me?</em></p>
<p>Viola covered her mouth with her hands and watched over the two people. Soon after, Lustian’s pain came to an end, but he wouldn’t come back to the bedroom. At the spot where the two people left, she held the bottle he drank from and smelled it. It was reminiscent of the fragrance of the Judith flower. That was then that she finally realized how she could be of use.</p>
<p><em>Am I… someone who can stop his pain…?</em></p>
<p>Viola gripped tightly onto the potion. She was resentful towards the God that put their fates to the test.</p>
<p><em>God, is this the duty you have bestowed upon me?</em></p>
<p>Viola strained her eyes to stare at the sky. Then, she awkwardly craned her neck upwards.</p>
<p><em>If it means that I can put a stop to his pain, I will prove myself useful over and over.</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Lustian returned to the bedroom but this time his body was cold. Perhaps it was because he threw himself in the Judith River so early in the morning.</p>
<p>It was striking that he was hiding something from her. Since she knew how he felt, Viola decided to pretend to turn a blind eye to her purpose. However, her demeanor was different. If she could be the antidote, she would fulfill that purpose over and over if it meant that Lustian’s pain could disappear through their physical intercourse.</p>
<p>Viola buried herself in Lustian’s embrace. With that, he tightly hugged her body and kissed her on the top of the head. As soon as she fumbled for his wide chest, she felt a light vibration.</p>
<p>“Are you up?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>Viola called him by his pet name. When she lifted up her head, she could see a gentle smile on his face. She kissed him on the lips. But his eyes went wide as if he didn’t expect that. When she ambitiously climbed on his back, he looked at her with a fire in his eyes.</p>
<p>“—If you keep seducing me like this, I won’t be able to take it. Where did you learn this?”</p>
<p>“From you. Is that why you don’t like it?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. My empress is always welcome to seduce me.”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a tongue came pushing in. Then, he aggressively took the root of the tongue and sucked on it like mad. Viola was just as ambitious while she also sucked on his tongue. Between colliding lips, there were wet kissing noises without rest. The sounds they made as their fluids mixed with each other seemed very erotic, but more than anything, it was enchanting. In actuality, it felt like several butterflies were flying above their heads.</p>
