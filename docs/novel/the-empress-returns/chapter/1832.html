            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 74 – Welcome Party (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Immediately he slashed Paul across his back. Every time the huge whip lifted up in the air, there was another big whip mark on the kneeling man’s back. Viola tried to stop him but she couldn’t actually move forward. Anne had grabbed her wrist. It was a warning that if she provoked the imperial family any further, he would just be beaten even more.</p>
<p><em><strong>Crack! Crack!</strong></em></p>
<p>Every time he violently struck the whip, a large mark appeared and blood formed. Even if Paul was a strong knight, it seemed overwhelming to be whipped over twenty times. Even though he was wearing clothes, they were torn by the lashes, leaving clear whip marks. Blood dripped from his back. As if mirroring the emperor’s cruel nature, they punished him continuously without hesitation.</p>
<p>Fire flashed in Viola’s eyes. The fact that through all this, Paul was holding back from emitting even a single groan so that he might prevent some of her pain, made tears well up in her eyes. She felt helpless. Seeing one’s servant being struck so harshly, even for she who had such a strong spirit, was pained.</p>
<p><em>This is the true nature of the Arpen royal family…</em></p>
<p>Compared to the cruelty they were showing, she realized that the way Lustian had treated her had been very sweet. As their evil deeds increased, her hatred towards the Arpen Empire became fuller.</p>
<p>The man put his whip down on the floor, looked down at Paul,who had not moved a single inch during the length of his punishment, and clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen a guy like you. How did you not even pass out? Go back. You’ve received all your punishment.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Imperial Highness….”</p>
<p>As Paul staggered to his feet, Viola moved forward to try and steady him, but Rosha was faster. After giving her a look that warned her not to make any more trouble, the little maid left the party with the bloodied man. If Rosha would treat him… Her mind would be relieved, but she would not be able to leave this party herself. Next would be Rosha’s turn…</p>
<p>Viola glared at the prince who had just put the whip down. He smiled and handed her a glass.</p>
<p>“There is no aphrodisiac in this one. Drink. I want to see that strong face get drunk.”</p>
<p>A fire broke out inside of her, but Viola drank the alcohol he offered at once. He offered again, and again she drank it all. She wasn’t without experience drinking alcohol. When she lived in the forest, their nanny often picked the fruits that were in season and made alcohol. Instead of grape wine, other fruit wines were made and Edward, Viola, and their nanny used to party together like that.</p>
<p>Although she had never had a drinking contest with other people, Viola drank all the alcohol he gave her. After drinking one or two, it was impossible to determine who was drinking more. Before long, the first person to get drunk was her opponent.</p>
<p>Once the man who had whipped Paul was all but dissolved away in alcohol, the prince sitting across from him broke out into laughter.</p>
<p>“Hahaha. What fun this is! Was it for this kind of fun? The reason His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince wanted you.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>Viola didn’t say a single word. <em>Try me, why don’t you. Are you the opponent this time?</em> Her vision started to fog over. She started to see double. The princesses looked at her anxiously.</p>
<p>“Cute. She has a strange charm.”</p>
<p>“Fi—”</p>
<p>She started to say “fight me” but bit her tongue in the end. She didn’t know what else she might say if she stayed here.</p>
<p>People’s voices buzzed in her ears. At the same time, her head was dizzy, and an unknown heat rose from below. Her body was drunk with aphrodisiac and alcohol. Even a very small amount of aphrodisiac, if mixed with alcohol, had double the effect.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, the prince in front of Viola grabbed her wrist. She forcefully pulled her hand away. But her hand was grabbed again.</p>
<p>“Get your hand, off me!”</p>
<p>She wanted to pull her hand away, but her whole body was sapped of its strength. It seemed like even the other person could tell that she was having a difficult time fighting the effects of the alcohol.</p>
<p>She could tell that the other person was aroused because he started taking off his clothes. Her eyes widened and she looked around to see that the other men were also starting to make love to their women.</p>
<p>“If you were chased out to the harem, that means you’re just a concubine abandoned by His Highness… Which means you’ve become the spoils of the imperials.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… Let go of me!”</p>
<p>“From now on, I’ve decided you’ll be mine. Princess….”</p>
<p>“Let go, let me go…!”</p>
<p>No matter how much she twisted and pulled away from him, it was futile. Viola’s body began to collapse helplessly against his strength. He was about to get on top of her when suddenly—</p>
<p><em><strong>WHAM!</strong></em></p>
<p>There was a loud sound, and the man who had been on top of Viola was thrown back onto the dining table. At the same time, the sound of a scream filled the air.</p>
<p><em>Was that the sound of breaking bones, or was she just hearing things?</em></p>
<p>Accompanying the sound was a man’s screams. The screams didn’t stop.</p>
<p><em><strong>Whack, whack!</strong></em></p>
<p>The sound of punching and the party began descending into chaos. The screams of the princesses and the princes sounded almost like a composition of music. A familiar scent was delivered to the tip of Viola’s nose… And finally, she felt relieved.</p>
<p>“Lune—”</p>
<p>With that, Viola closed her eyes. His love for her engulfed her heart like fire.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>It was early morning when she came to. When she opened her eyes, a pair of familiar arms were holding her. The wide and cozy chest gave the illusion that Edward was holding her. Without even realizing it, Viola grasped more tightly into the embrace.</p>
<p>Lustian gently hugged her back and kissed her hair. “They won’t be able to ever touch you again.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>“Though you’re here for now, you are still the crown princess. As long as you are under contract with me, you must not forget that you are my crown princess.”</p>
<p>Viola nodded slightly. Even if she was not acknowledged by the emperor or empress as a true crown princess, she trusted that since Lustian had warned those royals to show her deference, she at least wouldn’t be treated like a hostage any longer.</p>
<p>Though she knew that it was the safest shield to use his position, she still felt frustrated.</p>
<p>Because she could not be with him forever… because they had different paths…</p>
<p><em>You and I, we’re fated to become the Emperor of Arpen and the Queen of Koronis…</em></p>
<p>A deep sigh slipped Viola’s lips. He lifted up her chin and kissed her. Their tongues entangled and sweetly wound around each other. Into this sweet kiss, Viola felt herself being pulled in.</p>
