<p><strong>Chapter 48 – Not What They Seem (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Namita Suberi, Larkspur</em></p>
<p>She saw Edward as she dreamed. He was in the vanguard in a war, under the King’s orders. Edward was practically glowing with joy, and he twirled her around and hugged her. He smiled brightly. “I have finally gained recognition, Viola. Look!” he said, showing her the scroll with the King’s seal on it, “I am in the vanguard.”</p>
<p>“Really?” said Viola, smiling. He finally had the opportunity to showcase his skill and bravery that he had honed carefully and ardently over the years. However, Viola’s heart was heavy. She didn’t want him to go to battle. Nobody returned alive after a war with the Blood Army.</p>
<p>“If I win this battle,” said Edward, “Father promised that he will restore our status as Royals. I will become the Crown Prince.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it too dangerous?” asked Viola with a bad feeling, “The Blood Army is brutal.”</p>
<p>“I am a Master in my skill, Viola. Have faith,” he said, assuring her, “There are only a few who can match me in the entire continent.”</p>
<p>Viola had a feeling of inevitable doom. Could they really trust the King’s word? Doubtful. She held out her hand to receive something that Edward was handing out to her…</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Viola awoke with a start. She was surprised to find that her cheeks were wet. The dream had been different from the reality that she remembered. The King had never given Edward any scroll with the Royal seal. Viola wiped her tears away and looked at Lune, who was sound asleep next to her. <em>Can I really trust him? </em>She thought.</p>
<p>He had saved her from the Crown Prince. Did he do it solely because he lusted after her body? She stared at him sleeping now and was confused beyond words. He opened his eyes and tilted his sleep-tainted eyes to look at her. He reached out a hand and caressed her cheek.</p>
<p>“Is it that painful to sleep next to me?” he asked with a forced smile, stroking her tear stained cheeks.</p>
<p>“Imagine yourself in my place,” she said bitterly, “then perhaps you will have your answer.”</p>
<p>“Unwanted marriages are a part of the royal lifestyle,” he said, “Even nobles have to live with it.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” she said, “But I had decided to live on my own terms.”</p>
<p>“I know,” he said fondly, “you set the terms for a divorce after two years of this contract marriage. Maybe you will come to love me.”</p>
<p>“Love?” she scoffed, “That won’t happen for as long as I live.” She was determined that she would love no enemy spawn.</p>
<p>He sighed. “Well, I deserved that, I guess,” he said helplessly, “It is me, though, who has fallen in love with you.”</p>
<p>She hated such a passionate confession. She didn’t intend to ever give him any affection. He might have her body, but she never would provide him the satisfaction of her heart. It belonged only to her. But then why was her heart beating so fast?</p>
<p>He propped himself up on the pillow and held her chin and turned her towards him, looking into her eyes.</p>
<p>“Please don’t,” she said resentfully.</p>
<p>“Just a kiss, Viola,” he said tenderly.</p>
<p>Viola had millions of questions running around in her mind. Would a kiss hurt? She didn’t push him away as he came close. She was aware that they were both in a thin night shift, which revealed much of their skin. He kissed her tenderly. Viola’s heart was beating incessantly. But she grabbed him by the wrist to stop him when his hands reached to pry off her night shift. He paused. He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her one last time and let go before the sun rose.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Ivan awoke in the concubine’s chamber like any other day. But today he didn’t feel his usual self. He was full of doubts, wondering about Lustian’s recent change in behaviour. He refused to go hunting that he so loved. He would dedicate whatever free time he had looking for Viola in the Royal Villa. It was strange. Lustian had always abhorred spending the night with any new candidate before, even when it was tradition to do so. Ivan was curious how Lustian had changed so much.</p>
<p>Viola… He wondered about her. How had she managed to ensnare Lustian in this manner? He had only seen her ocean-blue eyes through the veil when he was acting as the Crown Prince on Lustian’s request. He couldn’t understand why Lustian took on the disguise of Lune whenever he wanted to meet her. If he loved her so much, why not just declare her the Crown Princess? <em>I must go and see this Viola, </em>he resolved.</p>
<p>He got up and dressed. He headed to the stables for a horse and galloped away to the Royal Villa. Ivan’s visit surprised the Head Maid in charge of the household. She was just setting out two sets of plates and utensils on the table when she jumped back on seeing him.</p>
<p>“He slept here yesterday, didn’t he?” he asked the maid, “Is he still here?”</p>
<p>“Your Highness,” said the maid with difficulty, “Please forgive me but nobody is allowed here.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright,” he assured her and headed up the stairs to the bedroom where the two of them should be.</p>
<p>The Head Maid was out of her mind. She didn’t know what she could say to stop him. She didn’t know if she should since he was the highest authority in the realm. He hid behind a pillar when he saw a silhouette of another maid in the hallway. He followed her to a room, thinking this must be the grand bedroom. Alas, he was mistaken; the room was empty. He jumped out the window to the terrace and walked to the exterior of the grandest room. He risked a peek through the window. He saw a beautiful woman seated in front of a mirror. <em>So, this is Viola, </em>he thought as his eyes widened. <em>What the hell… she is far from ugly!</em></p>
