            <p><strong>Chapter 143</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>That moment, a man’s voice could be heard.</p>
<p>&lt;Forgive me…&gt;</p>
<p>The moment the voice was heard, she felt her heart was tightening and it hurt. It was the first time she heard the voice, but she knew that He was the God that loved the virgin. The sad feeling that was coming from the bottom of her heart exploded all at once. The tears flowed without her intending.</p>
<p>As she became a flower already as she died waiting for him, no matter how much the virgin shouted He couldn’t hear her.</p>
<p>&lt;I’m, right here! I’m this flower. Look at me…. Please…&gt;</p>
<p>The virgin that became a flower kept calling out to Him, but all He did was cry and didn’t look at the flower. If anything, He took off the flower that kept grabbing onto him, threw it on the ground and screamed while looking up towards the sky. God kneeled and punched the ground with His fists. He was blaming His foolish self and inflicting self-harm.</p>
<p>The flower that was watching him felt her heart collapse. Her heart was burning from watching the ground that became a lake with his tears.</p>
<p>&lt;Don’t do it. Please… I’ll forgive you… So don’t be so hurt….&gt;</p>
<p>At some point, Viola was looking at what the virgin that became a flower was looking at. It was that moment… Suddenly, a huge light descended from the sky.</p>
<p>A man that appeared at the place where the light disappeared grabbed the mourning God’s neck. Then in a split moment, he ripped His chest and took out His heart. Red blood shot up in the sky, He tried to protest with His entire body in vain.</p>
<p>“How dare you to take my partner’s heart…. Shameless…!”</p>
<p>The man split God’s heart, which was spewing blood, in half. Then he threw the severed half into the river.</p>
<p>The flower was surprised. She was trembling, then lowered her head.</p>
<p><em>‘Who… who…. Would do this to my love…’</em></p>
<p>The flower was short so she couldn’t see the man’s face closely as he was basically a giant. As she was just a small flower, she couldn’t see the face of the one she loved. But the voice of her beloved could be heard clearly.</p>
<p>&lt;The day I meet you again… I will look like…&gt;</p>
<p>Then His voice could no longer be heard. All the flower could do was cry while looking at His dormant fingers. She couldn’t do anything. His heart was plucked out, blood spurted like a fountain, and was split in half, but she couldn’t even scream with all her might. His body was thrown into the river with a splash. She saw him floating on the river.</p>
<p><em>‘I want to see his face. His face…’</em></p>
<p>But unfortunately, the flower couldn’t see his face.</p>
<p>At the lake, it was only the virgin that became a flower and the man who punished God. The flower’s body trembled uncontrollably. As the flower turned her head, she could see the huge foot. As she thought now it was her turn to be stepped on, she was scared.</p>
<p>But strangely, her fear didn’t materialize. He actually looked like he was careful not to step on her. She saw him flinch and move his foot as the tip of his foot touched her. The man that she saw just a moment ago and the man she’s seeing now didn’t match.</p>
<p><em>‘Who is this man?’</em></p>
<p>The flower plucked her courage to lift her head. Then, she saw the man’s face albeit blurred. The man’s hair that was covered with the blood of her loved one was silver. The man lowered his head. As their eyes met, the flower’s eyes opened wide. It was handsome with a soft touch. You… are God of Judith?</p>
<p>“… Come back to your place. Then I’ll forgive him.”</p>
<p>The man spoke in a God’s language. The flower shook her head vigorously. She shook her body to pry her feet from the ground that she was planted in, but it was of no use.</p>
<p><em>No. It wasn’t that face! Who is it? Who’s the God of Judith? I can’t remember! At all…</em></p>
<p>The flower refused the man. Her mind was in confusion after the man appeared. In her eyes, she could see his body slowly sinking to the bottom.</p>
<p>“It’s not you my heart wants! I want to go to him. I want to reach him….”</p>
<p>“That’s fake. Virgin, what you see is the real me.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe him. Like the legend, she saw him take out his heart and split it into two, but he’s saying he’s the real God of Judith. The man was deceiving her. She glared at the man. He had a soft face, but she knew he was a different being.</p>
<p>The man suddenly started laughing. But then unlike when he was trying not to step on her a moment ago, he plucked out the flower.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>It was painful. As she was pulled out from the ground, she felt the same pain as that of her legs being torn off.</p>
<p>The man brought the flower’s face close to his. Then with his long tongue, lightly licked her. Her body became hot.</p>
<p>“If you really want to go to him, look with your eyes. The final moment of your man—”</p>
<p>The man threw the flower into the lake. The flower that was thrown afar somehow landed on his body that was heartless. She crawled up with all her might. Even though it felt like her entire body was being ripped apart, she wanted to see his face. After a while, she crawled up to his neck and felt exhausted. As her root was torn off, she didn’t have any strength.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, a hand could be felt wrapping around the flower’s shoulder. The flower slowly lifted her head. Then she met his eyes.</p>
<p>The faint smile…!!!</p>
<p><em>‘Lune…!!!’</em></p>
