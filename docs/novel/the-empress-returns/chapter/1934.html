            <p><strong>Chapter 29 – Cards On the Table</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Livyuna</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p><em>Proofreader: Livyuna</em></p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes grew big, Viola stared at him with her voice heightened due to her ragged breathing.</p>
<p>“I will give you the body you desire so much… In exchange, stop the crown prince from choosing me,” she said.</p>
<p>“Is it so terrible to marry the Crown Prince?” A complicated feeling flitted past his eyes, albeit momentarily.</p>
<p>“Yes! My goal is to fail the training and get back to my home.” In the end, she revealed her plans.</p>
<p>“It’s not good to ask for a divorce before you even get married.”</p>
<p>Lune laughed. His laughter sounded like a sneer, but Viola did not care as long as they both got what they wanted. She had been looking for a way to avoid a marriage with the terrible imperial family, and her last resort was marrying someone outside of the imperial family no matter who it was.</p>
<p>“You won’t lose anything either way. If you marry me, you’ll be the prince of the Kingdom of Koronis. Isn’t it an honor for a noble to marry royalty? Now, the choice is yours. However, if you refuse my offer, I’ll tell the maid that you kissed me.”</p>
<p>“Even the way you threaten is cute.”</p>
<p>“You’re guilty too!” She retorted.</p>
<p>“Yes, true … It’s high treason to touch you without the prince’s permission.” He laughed again, but like a madman this time.</p>
<p>She gazed at the man immersed in delirious laughter, clenching the sides of her dress, prepared to endure whatever was to come. She was at an impasse, one side was the deep blue sea and the other the devil. She had to take a plunge, no matter what for the road behind had long been burnt to cinders.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he stopped laughing and took her hand. Before she could realize what was happening, he had put the ring on his finger into hers. Then, he gently pecked her hand.</p>
<p>It was a respectful kiss like a man would do to the girl he was about to marry. However, his eyes were a contrast to this gentlemanly act … seething hot with desire.</p>
<p>“I concur. I’ll take the deal,” he said. “ The period is two years. You’ll have to live with me for two years to get a divorce.”</p>
<p>Before she could react, she grabbed her by the waist, and once again their lips met. As the sucking sounds of their flesh engulfed the air, a scorching ball of fire went through his chest to hers … her legs went limp, losing all strength.</p>
<p><em>‘Please, please, endure just a bit longer ….’ </em>Viola desperately implored herself. However, despite her steely resolve not to get carried away, her body was harping on another tune entirely.</p>
<p>She felt something pour down below. She soon realized that it was her body reacting. Struggling to forcefully escape from pleasure … it was too hard. She swallowed her breath, trying to clear her mind and tame her body.</p>
<p>He stopped kissing her for a moment, she took that opportunity to breathe.</p>
<p>“Before that … Viola,” he suddenly spoke. “You’ll have to meet the crown prince once. Put on your makeup again. So that you will get rejected by him.”</p>
<p>“I want that too,” she agreed. It was best to get that side sorted out before entangling herself with Lune. This way, things would be more under her control.</p>
<p>“Good, because I don’t want you to go into the harem either. I want you to become mine for the taking.”</p>
<p>With that declaration, he swooped down to capture her lips.</p>
<p>“Mhmm—!”</p>
<p>It was fortunate enough that she didn’t faint right here and now from the dizzying stimulus capturing her senses. His hands kept creeping towards her breasts, she grabbed them tightly in defiance. She knew that if her dress came off, they would end up doing the act. It wasn’t time for that yet, she needed to string him along a bit more.</p>
<p>Viola opened her eyes fiercely. Lune’s eyes met hers and her eyes flashed.</p>
<p>“I like it. As long as the venom in your eyes isn’t directed at me.”</p>
<p>He smirked and held her back firmly. His hands clasped her shoulders, and her head went blank. The feeling of their tongues entangling was so odd. Her heart was pounding. His softly wrapped lips were so smooth and sweet. Unknowingly, she turned her head to accept his kiss.</p>
<p>Then, something popped up from down below. It didn’t take long before she realized it was lust and soon after her face turned tearful.</p>
<p><em><strong>Boom, boom, boom …  </strong></em>Drums went off. The sound resonated in her head, the heart was driving her crazy.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>She ran into a servant on the way out but no one suspected her. Then again, the way Lune hugged her so affectionately left no room for doubts. After climbing onto the back of Lune’s horse, they left the crown prince’s palace and quickly went towards the imperial villa.</p>
<p>She buried her face into his back. Their second kiss was intense just like the first. Her head had gone blank. It did not lead to her dress coming off and having sex, but it exhausted her, nonetheless, as if she had undergone a strenuous exercise.</p>
<p>Arriving at the imperial villa, she could see the knights running around. She couldn’t figure out how they had found out when she had snuck out without even a rat or bird knowing.</p>
<p>“Get back.”</p>
<p>The knights who saw Lune fell flat onto the ground. Viola covered her face as much as she could with her robe. She could see the maids running over through the corner of her eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t breathe a word about it,” Lune’s authoritative voice boomed through the air. “I’m the one who took her with me.”</p>
<p>“Ah … Yes … Lu … Lord Lune.” Those few hurriedly acknowledged.</p>
<p>Just then Viola saw Rosha. She went straight to her to make sure she was all right. She could see the servants holding ropes, ready to tie her up. Lune glared at them and the servants rapidly retreated.</p>
<p>“Headmaid,” he bellowed.</p>
<p>A meek voice answered, “My lord.”</p>
<p>“Get rid of all the servants and maids of the imperial palace.”</p>
<p>“What?!” The head maid was visibly shocked. Mouth agape, she looked at her master trying to discern if she were mistaken.</p>
