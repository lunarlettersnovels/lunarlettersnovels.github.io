<p><strong>Chapter 144</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“…. AH!”</p>
<p>As her breathing came back, water entered her mouth. Viola quickly grabbed her sanity that was slipping away and opened her eyes. The fantasy that was in front of her disappeared and now she was in cold water.</p>
<p>Through the waterweed, black hair could be seen waving. It was Lustian. He used a dagger to cut the waterweed that was wrapped around her feet. He quickly cut them off, grabbed her waist, and went up.</p>
<p>She looked down. Then she saw the man with his hair cut off looking at Viola regretfully.</p>
<p>&lt;My bride…&gt;</p>
<p>Viola closed her eyes. Then she hugged Lustian’s neck and put her head into his embrace.</p>
<p>&lt;My bride…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;You are mine….&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;My bride….&gt;</p>
<p><em>Stop it!</em></p>
<p><em>I have no intention of being your bride!</em></p>
<p><em>My love is only for one person. Doesn’t matter what my relationship in the past was with you, I’m rejecting you!</em></p>
<p><em>The only person I love is Lune!</em></p>
<p><em>If you need your lost heart then wait! I’ll give it back! The life of a human is just about 80 years. So stop bothering me!</em></p>
<p>She felt her body shooting up and Viola’s eyes closed. Even with her consciousness going away, she could feel Lustian putting his lips on hers and putting pressure on her chest. Wendy who was bawling and Rosha, nanny…..</p>
<p>And… His crying all mixed together was giving her a headache.</p>
<p>He put his breath into her mouth. She was taking in his breath, but she couldn’t take it all, as it looked like his breath was less than hers. Unlike her who was just in the water, he had to cut through the waterweed and had to move more so his breathing was rougher.</p>
<p>“You can stop… We are both safe.”</p>
<p>‘Viola! Viola!’</p>
<p>The voice that was echoing loudly felt like the cry of God of Judith, which was weird. Viola thought that as she lost her consciousness.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The palace of the empress flipped. The priestesses and priests summoned by the emperor all came to the palace and put in their divine power. Viola went to the gates of the death but thankfully came back. But she didn’t wake for the next few days. As a result, the emperor’s mood was very sharp.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thump!</strong></em></p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes were aggressive as he slammed on the table.</p>
<p>“Is there any way to get rid of Judith River?”</p>
<p>“You…Your Majesty…. How could you say such….”</p>
<p>“That a*sh*le tried to take my wife without my permission! He didn’t even go through the ritual and tried to come to the human world!”</p>
<p>Lustian’s rage was off the roof. How angry did he have to be to get rid of Judith River, which was like his life? Kyle felt uneasy looking at him from the side.</p>
<p>“There is no way to fill a large river like that.”</p>
<p>“Even if Viola is God’s Companion for sure, this is against the rule. He had to wait until I personally opened the way.”</p>
<p>“I think God has waited long enough. You also know that there is no time left.”</p>
<p>That moment, Ivan, who was listening by the side, opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“It is you who also violated the rule. God probably knows that even though you know that the empress is God’s Companion, you’re not sending her.”</p>
<p>“Even then, to open the door between the world of Gods and humans is my job. That’s the contract.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re trying to do. Isn’t there a limit to trying to hold? Now He might really not try to hold back. It’s not going to stop with the curse being bestowed upon the entire imperial family….”</p>
<p>“Do I look like someone who’d just sit back?”</p>
<p>Ivan shook his head. “No, you probably have a plan….”</p>
<p>“Of course. I just haven’t said it out loud.”</p>
<p>Lustian was gathering mercenaries. Also, he lowered the standards of joining the Blood Army, so that even if one was not a noble, one has a chance to join. Anyone could join as long as they had skills. The number of mercenaries coming from across the continent was enormous. It was ten times the elite force of Blood Army that they put in few years of budget.</p>
<p>“War against God… So reckless.”</p>
<p>“If I don’t want to send God’s Companion and defy that covenant, then I will not stand down no matter what.”</p>
<p>Lustian prepared for war. He, of course, volunteered to be at the helm for the war against God.</p>
<p>“Really, that’s possible? If you win a war against God, you can destroy the covenant?”</p>
<p>“Do you want to witness it with your own eyes?”</p>
<p>Ivan nodded and then Lustian brought a huge parchment from his study. As he said an incantation in God’s language, the parchment that was rolled up spread out and dropped to the floor. Ivan read the letters on the parchment.</p>
<p>“But… Why is it empty in the middle?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s not recorded every time.”</p>
<p>“It’s weird that the past events aren’t recorded?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking events in God’s world were left out. Even if it was for a moment, Viola was in God’s world. That moment, I don’t know what happened.”</p>
<p>Ivan looked at Lustian who was deliberating. Then he leaned his head. It was a little weird that the event of Viola almost going over to God’s world wasn’t recorded. If it was a small personal event, then it was understandable that it wasn’t recorded. But it was such a huge event…</p>
<p>“You made sure word didn’t get out? Are there any priests that were being suspicious?”</p>
<p>“Thankfully, no one. They just think that the empress drowned in the water. Princess Guinev’s prayer helped quite a bit. Since we got over the hump, we won’t have to worry.”</p>
<p>“Wendy seemed very surprised.”</p>
<p>Lustian rolled his hands into a fist. He felt annoyed that he couldn’t worry about Wendy in the open. The moment the little girl’s existence was noticed by Grand Priest, Viola would immediately become God’s Companion.</p>
<p>“There’s the nanny….”</p>
<p>“Anyways, last time how did you get over the moment the empress almost found out that she’s God’s Companion? I was so surprised. I didn’t even imagine that Anne knew the story of God’s Companion.”</p>
