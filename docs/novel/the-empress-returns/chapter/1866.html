<p><strong>Chapter 161</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Even so, unfortunately, half of my bloodline belongs to this kingdom. I believe that the throne that took my strength away from me is bound to crumble. I have faith that this can be achieved through true peace and unity. Father’s ambitions will prevent him from setting his power aside, but there will be a time when he too will feel it.”</p>
<p>Viola could not forgive her father for invading her mother’s kingdom. How could she forgive him for driving Edward to his death? Her heart was set on getting him to lose something that was most precious to him.</p>
<p><em>The crown that you so wish to protect will be passed down to my bloodline.</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Lustian’s actions spoke louder than words. Wielding even more power and strength than Viola, he pressed down on him with a warning. He got him to feel how pathetic it was that he wanted to protect the crown so badly. Those were the days that he got him to realize once again how powerful the fiery breath of the Arpen Empire was.</p>
<p>Viola too understood how great that power was.</p>
<p>The negotiation between the Arpen Empire and the Kingdom of Koronis was not the only negotiation that existed. As the only member of the royal family from the Kingdom of Camelon left standing, Viola laid out detailed instructions so that the King of Koronis would not be able to intimidate the citizens of Camelon. There were three places in the document that needed a signature. The three of them formed a coalition so that within the confines of the negotiation, the King of Koronis would be under their thumb.</p>
<p>“Then, I shall wait here for the new king. I shall cultivate a talent who will serve him and train them to be a brilliant knight.”</p>
<p>“Please,” said Ken.</p>
<p>Viola was relieved. She went in the carriage that was on its way back to the Arpen Empire. Her carriage and the carriage that Ivan was in traveled in the opposite direction from the border region. As Lustian promised, she was going to return to the Kingdom of Koronis after forming a pact with them, and the rest of the kingdom’s negotiations were in Ivan’s hands.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to be going according to plan.</p>
<p>Until…</p>
<p><em>Since God did not protest even while observing my every move, I feel it wouldn’t be entirely impossible to face him.</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Time passed. When night came, Lustian appeared in front of Viola. For some reason, he didn’t seem so happy lately, so she was more than just concerned.</p>
<p>“Lune… There isn’t anything wrong, is there?”</p>
<p>“No, there isn’t.”</p>
<p>“But you look sick. It can’t be that you’re in more pain than you were before, are you?”</p>
<p>Concerned over his pale complexion, she examined his body but couldn’t find any areas of pain. She was anxious. Perhaps something was wrong with the Imperial Palace…. Or maybe God was creating a larger army to face the humans? She thought of all kinds of scenarios.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow night, the Great Magician will come with me. They’re creating a portal to move right to the forest coming from the Imperial Palace after crossing the border.”</p>
<p>“…I would also like to go back immediately but….”</p>
<p>It was obvious that he was in a rush. The border was close enough so that they’d reach there in 4 days if they travelled as fast as they could, so they didn’t necessarily need magic, but he was still in a rush.</p>
<p>“…You’ll simply know when they get here.”</p>
<p>Viola became concerned for her daughter. “Wendy! You can’t mean that something is the matter with her, is there?”</p>
<p>“——.”</p>
<p>“Lune! Tell me. Is Wendy ill?”</p>
<p>Lustian avoided eye contact. She suddenly thought of the curse. <em>It can’t be! </em>She had chills thinking of the story that the last royal family fell ill with an unknown disease and died.</p>
<p>She screamed, grabbing onto Lustian’s arms. Her eyes rolled to the back of her head. <em>I couldn’t even tell Wendy that I am her mother… </em>Her heart was torn apart at the thought of the little princess being cursed. For the first time, she was terrified. The fear of losing one’s child was greater than the burden of having to face God.</p>
<p>“Calm down, Viola….”</p>
<p>“Tell me! What is happening to Wendy~”</p>
<p>“At first… she was slightly ill, but now she’s settled down. I’m observing the effects of the medicine that I gave her.”</p>
<p>“When did this started?”</p>
<p>“Well….”</p>
<p>Lustian avoided answering. It was certain that Wendy was not ill on the day she knitted. In that case, after that…</p>
<p>“It must’ve been from the day the negotiation was first made!”</p>
<p>“…….!”</p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p>“God must’ve been sending a warning, correct? How could a small child….”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. Her fever has gone down. Since the Judith flower is effective, she was able to recover thanks to the medicine. She can hold out.”</p>
<p>“Urk….”</p>
<p>“V-Viola?”</p>
<p>“Urk… Urk….”</p>
<p>Viola’s insides turned upside down. Though Lustian grabbed her, she ran into the bathroom in a frenzy. Her stomach was twisted in knots.</p>
<p><em>What did he do that deserved being lashed out at…</em></p>
<p><em>What was so horrible about your past self falling in love with God…</em></p>
<p><em>Why am I the only one who had to be punished for breaking the law….</em></p>
<p><em>Isn’t the God of Judith arguably the worst man?!</em></p>
<p>Viola was getting violently emotional.</p>
<p>No matter how much she emptied her insides, she did not feel refreshed. It seemed that Lustian was calling out to Rosha in a hurry.</p>
<p>A shocked Rosha rushed into the bathtub and checked on her mistress. “Empress! Wh-What is happening? Are you not feeling well?”</p>
<p>“Rosha…. Sob… It seems as though Wendy has also been cursed. What… shall I do?”</p>
<p>“Empress….”</p>
<p>“I cannot hold on. Poor Wendy….”</p>
