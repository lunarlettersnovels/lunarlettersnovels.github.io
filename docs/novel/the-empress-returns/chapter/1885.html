            <p><strong>Chapter 142</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Viola’s training continued after. From time to time, Lustian came to the training ground and became her partner. But in his absence, Paul was the partner. When the swordsmanship training was over, she immediately grabbed a bow.</p>
<p>She pulled the bowstring towards the target between the trees. Her hands became rough and many a calluses bloomed on her fingers due to concentrated training, even so, she spent most of her day training. Of course, that looked weird to others.</p>
<p>“Why are you training so much all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“You know how I am. Sometimes, I go hunting in the forest and get my own game.” Viola smiled and spun her tightened shoulder.</p>
<p>“You have many things to do as an empress. The Grand Empress’s work is also being delayed….”</p>
<p>“I finished them all in the morning.”</p>
<p>Lustian leaned against a tree and quietly observed Viola’s action.</p>
<p>His gaze took some of her attention, but she focused on pulling the bowstring and hitting the target.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thump!</strong></em></p>
<p>As she hit the target with one shot, the people who were staring were impressed. Her skill had certainly improved. She brushed her hair which was wet with her sweat and looked up towards the sky.</p>
<p>“It’s hot.”</p>
<p>“Quite. Today’s the hottest day. Do you want to go for a swim?”</p>
<p>“Swim? Sure.”</p>
<p>“Wendy will go too. I told her to get ready already.”</p>
<p>It was the first time in a while for the three to be relaxing. Lustian got on a horse and stretched his hand, but Viola brought another and hopped onto it. He laughed.</p>
<p>“So stubborn.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be off first. Ha!”</p>
<p>Viola kicked the side of the horse hard and rdashed towards the forest.</p>
<p>As the two horses ran like they were competing, a carriage followed from afar. As she glanced back, it was the Empress Carriage. It was carrying Wendy and following as hard as it could.</p>
<p>The place they arrived at was the Lake of God. Only people with permission could enter, but Wendy was a special guest that had permission from the Emperor. Rosha and the nanny’s eyes opened wide as they saw the Lake of God for the first time. It was the second time the beautiful Judith flower bloomed on the ground, and the surface that was shining from afar looked like a jewel.</p>
<p>“It… it’s beautiful! Right? Aunt?”</p>
<p>“Rosha, be careful not to step on Judith flower.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Yes! I’ll be careful.”</p>
<p>Some maids made a resting ground by the Judith flowers. They took out a table and put lace cloth on top of it, placed gold plates, and then dismissed themselves. The rest was finished by the nanny and Rosha. Kyle and Paul were in charge of guarding the imperial family.</p>
<p>Three people jumped into the lake. As they were wearing thin inside clothes, the knights turned their backs. It was cool. There was nothing better than swimming on a hot day.</p>
<p>“Are you ok? It’s not scary right?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Wendy was good at swimming. She splashed around and swam in a shallow place. Lustian and Viola didn’t go far from the little girl and cooled off.</p>
<p>“If you rest your body in the lake, the thirst disappears.”</p>
<p>“Is that how you got rid of your thirst when I wasn’t there?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If I hadn’t met you then I’d be living in that pain forever.”</p>
<p>As Lustian was topless, each time he moved his strong chest muscles moved. She really liked the shoulders and chest that got wider. He pulled her hand and kissed on her forehand.</p>
<p>It was that moment that Rosha’s sudden scream was heard. As they quickly turned their heads, Wendy was wailing.</p>
<p>It was a place where it was low enough for a child’s foot to reach so did she just slip? Thankfully, Wendy was where Lustian could grab her just by reaching out so he was able to hug the little girl immediately. As the child was coughing out water, he patted her back.</p>
<p>It was then that a stunned Rosha went in, took Wendy and brought her out from the water. This time, Viola felt her feet sinking. Underneath her feet was swirling sand and lots of bush. Shocked, she couldn’t even scream. As all of Lustian’s attention was towards Wendy, she was pulled in. A huge typhoon was swirling underneath the feet.</p>
<p><em><strong>Mmmmmmm!</strong></em></p>
<p>Viola was struggling while grabbing her throat.</p>
<p>&lt;The Companion of the God of Judith…. You are my bride…&gt;</p>
<p>Viola opened her eyes as she heard the voice coming from somewhere. As she came to her senses and looked down, tens of hundreds of waterweed grabbed her legs and pulled her towards the bottom. As they were pulling with force, her feet felt like they were going to be cut off. She flailed her hands crazily, desperately calling for Lustian.</p>
<p>That moment, with a splash, a huge water pillar was rammed into the bottom of the lake. Even in her dizzy mind, she could see his face. Lustian glared. His eyes that could be seen in the water showed resentment to God that was taking his companion without his permission. Viola reached out her hands towards him. But no matter how much she reached out, she couldn’t reach him. She could see his face.</p>
<p><em><strong>…. Bang!!!!</strong></em></p>
<p>There was the sound of an explosion. Viola closed her eyes.</p>
<p>The bottom of the lake was like thick darkness. Underneath were waving waterweed mixed with darkness, creating a dreamy scenery. The length and width were so close that they looked like voluptuously long hair. No matter where you looked it was the same colour, and they moved the same way.</p>
<p>&lt;Come to me… To your place…&gt;</p>
<p>The weeds wrapped around Viola’s feet changed its colour. Soon it looked like silver hair and kept pulling her body down. As her body went down, she was out of breath and her heart pumped without rest. Even while she couldn’t breathe, her mind was clear.</p>
<p>She knew what was down there.</p>
<p>That moment, it was [The Land of God] that popped up in Viola’s head.</p>
<p>&lt;God of Judith, where you are…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;I love you. I’ll be waiting for you as a flower…. Come find me. Judith…. Don’t forget.&gt;</p>
<p>The sound of a dearly crying virgin’s voice echoed in her ears endlessly. God abandoned the virgin that grew old, but her longing and love towards him didn’t change.</p>
