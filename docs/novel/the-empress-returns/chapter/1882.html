<p><strong>Chapter 145</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Ivan sighed.</p>
<p>That moment, Lustian’s eyes shook terribly. The emperor looked agitated like he knew how Anne is like. But tried hard to calmly answer Ivan.</p>
<p>“It was dangerous. It was a huge relief that I could only show what I wanted on the parchment… If I was a little late then Viola would’ve doubted me.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment, the record on the parchment shown to Viola only contained the information that Lustian wanted to show her. Other than the information she knew, he didn’t show anything else. He didn’t have any intention of deceiving her, but he hated it even more for her to find out what he was preparing.</p>
<p>Ivan voiced another concern. “Wendy… It’s probably not possible to keep hiding her? Wendy and you, when the two of you are standing next to each other, you guys look so alike… like you’re related.”</p>
<p>“How would anyone know how I feel that I have to hide my child? It boils my blood but there are still too many enemies around me… Perhaps, Anne hasn’t noticed Wendy’s existence?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. She’s trying all her best to have a child. Taking so many medicines… It’s not like a child will be borne like that.”</p>
<p>Ivan lightly shook his head. Lustian agreed to leave Anne up to Ivan. Her greed was to have a son as soon as possible so hopefully, her interest didn’t reach Viola.</p>
<p>“She’s your wife so you keep her busy.”</p>
<p>“Ok.”</p>
<p>Lustian took a few short breaths then rubbed his neck out with a nervous face. He was told that he shouldn’t interrupt a priestess who was praying, so he was waiting in his office, but he wanted to go to the Empress’s palace any moment. He felt like even if he prayed to the god that tried to take his wife He wouldn’t listen anyway. He put his hands together and rubbed them.</p>
<p>At this moment, Rosha came into the office hurriedly. She seemed like all her worries were gone. Lustian immediately stood up and then ran to the empress’s palace with all his might.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Her senses sharpened because of the noise around her. A headache came upon her, but her consciousness became clear. As Viola woke up, many voices reached her. As she turned her eyes she saw those precious to her. She looked at them one by one and then stopped at Lustian.</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>She bit her lips and then let go. She was scared. When she was drowning, she was reminded of Lune’s death in the fantasy created by the god. Him being thrown into River Judith with his heart split…</p>
<p>“Viola!” Lustian hugged her. His heart was pounding like crazy.</p>
<p>Slowly she became calm in his embrace. She dug her nose into him and took into his scent. “What a relief. That you’re ok….”</p>
<p>“Back at you. You don’t know how surprised I was….”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for making you worry,” said she.</p>
<p>“It’s ok… Now that you’re awake….”</p>
<p>He kissed her forehead. The state of his heart was clear. She probably woke up when his heart basically became ashes from worrying.</p>
<p>He kissed her lips multiple times. Viola turned her gaze while feeling the warmth of his lips. Wendy looked very scared and had teary eyes.</p>
<p>“Wendy….”</p>
<p>“Wah! Empress! Don’t be hurt!”</p>
<p>“I’m ok… I’m not hurt anymore.”</p>
<p>Viola hugged Wendy and patted her shoulders. Then Lustian enveloped them both into his embrace. A sad sigh sounded throughout. It was only the people that knew their situation so the couple didn’t bother hiding their love for Wendy.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Wendy. For making you sorry… Shh… Don’t cry, baby.”</p>
<p>“Sob… Sob….”</p>
<p>As Wendy’s crying didn’t stop, she was worried a little. But surprisingly it was Lustian that stopped the little girl’s tears.</p>
<p>He told Rosha to bring something and she quickly brought it. It was a doll. A big stuffed doll that was in a shape of a person wearing the traditional clothing of the Arpen Empire like a princess. As Wendy hugged the doll, she stopped crying.</p>
<p>“It’s a gift. It’s yours.”</p>
<p>“So pretty…!”</p>
<p>Wendy’s face became bright. Lustian softly brushed her hair and looked at her with a loving gaze.</p>
<p>“Wait just a little more, Wendy, until we restore your status….”</p>
<p>Wendy didn’t understand, but Viola knew what he meant by that. He put his forehead lightly against the little princess’s forehead and quietly whispered. Then the little girl hugged him and giggled very cutely.</p>
<p>Lustian dismissed everyone. As they were left alone, he hugged Viola and trapped her in his embrace.</p>
<p>“What did you see in the water?”</p>
<p>“…. Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, just silver water weed that was pulling down my feet.”</p>
<p>“Silver water weed….”</p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes shook. He tried not to show it, but his eyes were anxious. She could feel his agitation within. How could she not know his anxiety about her almost being taken by God?</p>
<p>“Hug me. Whenever we’re hugging like this, there are no worries.”</p>
<p>“…Viola.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going anywhere. Remember I promised?”</p>
<p>Viola thought of the worst scenario. The situation when if they lose the war against God instead of winning. Then Lustian’s fate would be like <em><strong>that</strong></em> fate. God basically was warning her.</p>
<p><em><strong>“If you want to protect your love then come yourself. To your place…”</strong></em></p>
