<p><strong>Chapter 103 – A Confession (1)</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p><em>‘Though this land is the mother country of my empress, and you are the artisan, I do not want to treat you as such. I am well aware of the humiliation that the empress experienced here in the meantime. But at the least, I situated the Blood Army in the suburbs of the capital, as a means of upholding the imperial etiquette. In exchange, I will have to hand over the royalty on account of the surrender. Where would I have to look? Ah, that child will do.’ </em>Lustian had told him.</p>
<p>And surprisingly, he chose Wendy. Out of the entire class of nobility, this little girl stood out significantly because of her outstanding beauty that was attributed to the genetics inherited evenly from her parents.</p>
<p><em>What a relief… </em>The king’s lips twisted into a malicious curl.</p>
<p>“Such a cruel man actually tries to play god. Lustian, you wait and see… The things that God Himself will do to your empress….”</p>
<p>♛♛♛</p>
<p>Lustian drank the potion that the Great Magician handed to him. The liquid running down his throat brought forth a searing pain that made him feel as if he was drinking a bitter-tasting hard liquor. It was the sort of pain that made him feel like his throat was burning up, but he could withstand something like that however much he had to.</p>
<p>The water from the Judith flowers and the Lake of God mixed together to form a potion that at least somewhat diluted the aches he would experience. Since he had this potion, he could withstand it for eight years even if there wasn’t a lake nearby.</p>
<p>“I did everything you told me.”</p>
<p>The Great Magician handed him a ring. The ring was the one that Viola left on the table before she left the castle.</p>
<p>“I trust in your strengths, but isn’t there still a chance that trouble awaits me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, wherever you are, you will be able to locate her.”</p>
<p>He was the Great Magician who stayed by the previous emperor’s side. Ever since the emperor had changed, now the Great Magician took on that role.</p>
<p>“Here, this is the emperor’s ring.”</p>
<p>The rings came in pairs. As Lustian wore the ring and rubbed on the jewel, he imagined the position of the ring that would soon be on another hand. The position was precise in his mind.</p>
<p>He liked it. He put a spell on the ring that made it so that once the ring was on Viola’s finger, she could never take it off. Even if she wasn’t held for ransom, he could find her anywhere.</p>
<p>“I love it. You did well.”</p>
<p>“Then, do we just need to prepare to receive the remains of the previous emperor as soon as we arrive at the palace?” asked the wizard.</p>
<p>“Not yet. Wait.”</p>
<p>The Great Magician’s eyes were trembling. “I understand, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>As he opened the barracks and went through, he saw something flicker past him. Without even realizing it himself, his body recoiled backward.</p>
<p>“Ah…. I- I apologize. Your Highness….”</p>
<p>The person that nearly bumped into him was but a small fellow. Rosha bent her head forward in shock.</p>
<p>Beside Rosha was a child staring at Lustian with eyes wide open. It was the first time they were staring at each other so directly. After taking a close look, she seemed to resemble Viola a lot. Of course, it wasn’t so strange as they’re of the same blood.</p>
<p>Her black hair was long, wavy, and smooth as silk, her face round. Her large pupils were sparkling, akin to Viola’s blue eyes. The child smiled brightly as she looked at Lustian. Even her smiling face resembled hers.</p>
<p>“Are you not afraid of me?”</p>
<p>“No! Such a pretty person. Rosha- Pretty, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>The child didn’t fear him. He didn’t know if it was because she was a child. Even though she’s a hostage, she had no qualms talking like that to the emperor of the enemy state.</p>
<p><em>Was her name Wendy? </em>Somehow, he felt strange.</p>
<p>“Ah, Princess… Please. This is the Emperor.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Emperor? So, does that make him the king?”</p>
<p>“Yes… O-Of course.”</p>
<p>He was matching Wendy’s gaze without realizing it. The people around were horrified watching as they saw him get on one knee and level with the little girl. His hand voluntarily went out to touch the child’s face. His heart throbbed. He thought,<em> should I hug her?… </em>but hesitated right away.</p>
<p>As he turned around, he knew many were staring at him. Lustian came to his senses at the sight of the gaping faces around him.</p>
<p>“Teach her well.”</p>
<p>“Understood. Princess… Hurry, let us move along.” Rosha turned around, holding Wendy as they walked away.</p>
<p>But the child looked back at him and gave me a gentle wave. With that, Lustian’s lips curled into a small smile.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Lustian rode in the coach that Viola was in. Right away, he took her glove off her hand. He found relief as he took the ring out of his pocket and put it on her finger. <em>Now, I can find you at any time even if you sneak out…</em></p>
<p>After he had found her, he could not fall asleep for two days, worried that she would run away. He was tired. As soon as his head rested gently on Viola’s shoulder, his eyes closed.</p>
<p>Viola said nothing. She just took in his warmth as she interlocked fingers with him. A warm feeling in her chest spread all the way through her. The moist tears that streamed out were not out of pain but of happiness.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… for hurting you… You’re also one of the people I wish to protect. No matter the words of malice that pour out of you, I am alright. I will hold on for the amount of time you already held on.”</p>
<p>Lustian did not answer. As Viola looked at him, already deep in sleep, she was resentful at their misaligned fates. Her heart was crying out to god.</p>
<p><em>My God! What do you want from me? Why do you put us both in so much pain!</em></p>
<p>Viola glared at the sky and cursed at the fate of having to conceal their feelings for each other.</p>
<p><em>I will no longer run away! I will protect the people I love… from my destiny.</em></p>
<p>She bit her lip, facing her destiny head-on.</p>
