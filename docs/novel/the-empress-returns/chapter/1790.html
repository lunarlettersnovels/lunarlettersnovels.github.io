            <p><strong>Chapter 116</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Ahhh….”</p>
<p>“Pant… Pant….”</p>
<p>At every touch, Lustian brought her to her joyous climax. Everytime his body moved up and down, her whole body was aching from the electrocution.</p>
<p>Just then, she made contact with his lustful eyes. He was smiling. The words that came out of his lips may not have been so sweet, but his gaze and actions made it clear that he felt a desperation for the ones he loved.</p>
<p><em>This man… I looked at him in that way even back then…. But I rejected him.</em></p>
<p>She could see an intermittent sense of anxiety in him. Even while he was shaking like a beast, he had to check if the person moaning beneath him was her. He squeezed his way into her mouth, inserted his member into her, and led her to delight. The way he conveyed his feelings was touching.</p>
<p><em>What can I do for him?</em></p>
<p><em>What do I do for the Arpen Empire, now that it’s no longer the enemy state but my home?</em></p>
<p><em>Should I find God’s Companion myself?</em></p>
<p>Though there were so many secrets to unravel, first, she had to immediately comfort the anxious man in front of her.</p>
<p>“I’m not going anywhere. I will not leave your side.” Viola whispered into his ear.</p>
<p>Just then, Lustian stopped what he was doing and stared at her in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Say it again… Again….”</p>
<p>“I will always stay by your side… Ugh!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he fiercely grabbed onto the back of her head. Viola couldn’t even close her eyes since they kissed while she was talking. After her waist was gripped strongly, the other’s tongue entered her mouth. She was shocked at how their tongues were entangled like snakes and the hot lump of flesh. She was shaking so much she felt like she would jump up. It was such an exhilarating feeling that she felt dizzy. He grabbed onto her back so hard it was about to break. Their tongues were caught up in each other. The hot breaths went in and out of each other’s lips.</p>
<p>“Viola….”</p>
<p>Lustian hugged her waist so tight, it was almost crumbling. Viola also buried her face in his chest and breathed in his scent.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>After Lustian left for his early morning campaign, Viola headed to the gymnasium. It was because she had to meet a person who did sword training every day in the gymnasium. Since it was so early in the morning, there was no one else. She didn’t bother hiding her tracks as she went up to the man. He turned around.</p>
<p>“We have much to discuss, don’t we?”</p>
