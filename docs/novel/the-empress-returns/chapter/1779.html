            <p><strong>Chapter 127</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p><em>Agh…</em></p>
<p>She shuddered at the maddening pleasure. Her core was becoming moist with excitement and a translucent honey liquid oozed out. Her body became wet on its own in preparation for accepting the man’s penetration. Her body was preparing for his m*nh*od.</p>
<p>“Haa, Viola… Viola….”</p>
<p>“Uhhh… Uhhhh….”</p>
<p>His flaming red rod was begging to open the sealed secret room. His shaft rubbing against her abdomen and the pre-c*m flowing from his tip was overwhelming. A gooey liquid trickled out of his dull gl*ns. When she was ready, he inserted. A screeching moan came out of Viola.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh….”</p>
<p>Along with the burning pain, her sensitive lower area was heating up. She was aching. But the smile would not leave her lips due to the overwhelming pleasure.</p>
<p>Lustian nibbled on her whole body. Even though he looked at ease, his member became impatient. His bulging rod continued moving up and down, pressing on her sensitive spot. There were punching noises.</p>
<p>“Uck… Agh….”</p>
<p>They breathed heavily, still trying to control their breaths. It was so good. The s*x they had after honestly confessing their feelings to each other was the best. Viola let out haggard moans. From the bottom, endless sloshing noises could be heard. White foam soaked the thin sheets.</p>
<p>They couldn’t possibly speak from all the embarrassment, so they turned their heads away. Just then, before she knew it, her chin was grabbed and her tongue was being sucked on lightly. The hands that were moving her shoulders flicked at her n*pples. And as he arched his back, he pressed on the spot. Her thighs spasmed. As soon as the pleasure washed over her, she was moaning without realizing it.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh….”</p>
<p>It felt like her face was about to explode. Due to the searing heat and his pheromones hitting her at once, she was panting crazily. Unable to keep it together due to the waves of electrifying pleasure, she made screeching moans.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh… Ahhhh! Ah….”</p>
<p>A light of fire flashed before her eyes, it led to a powerful kiss. As her head went back, her lips were deeply sucked on. Each time, he put strength into his behind and tightened his own member. It was hot. They exchanged sweet breaths between their lips, which brought on the pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ahhht-!”</p>
<p>Each time he thrust, the pleasure going through her inner walls became more powerful and rough. It felt like all the hair on her body was standing on end.</p>
<p>A sloshing sound of liquid could be heard from below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slosh, slosh, slosh!</strong></em></p>
<p>These were sounds produced by the copious amounts of come and fluids mixing together. The erotic sounds stimulating their hearing caused their faces to turn a bright red. Bending his body, he scratched against her on the inside by thrusting in and out. Her folds were stretching out due to the rod that was rubbing her gratifyingly.</p>
<p>As he licked her mounds, he caressed the nape of her neck with his tongue. His sucking was so intense that it felt like her skin was going to come off, causing her hips to shake. His shaft tenaciously stimulated all of the spots. It felt like he was reaching all the way inside. Fireworks were going off in her brain. His weighty member ceaselessly cracked her open on the inside and then went out without a moment of hesitation. The member piercing her deep inside made her feel like she was losing breath. The pleasure seated deep in her brain caused her body to spasm on its own.</p>
<p>“Ahh, ahh… Uhhh, haaaa….”</p>
<p>“I’m going mad… Viola… Ugh….”</p>
<p>Lustian kissed her frantically while massaging her br*asts. Viola took in a sharp, sudden breath and frantically wrapped her arms around his shoulders. His sturdy arms grabbed onto her thin waist, she was shaking. The aching pain and pleasure going through her body stimulated her brain. She tightened her inner walls.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slap, slap, slap….</strong></em></p>
<p>He slammed himself against her waist with the widened hole. The fricative sounds between two bodies, and the wet noise… There was nothing unsatisfactory about his manhood rubbing against her. She was happy. Amidst the aggressive movements, they smiled every time they came face-to-face. Putting their worries and anxieties aside, they were living in the moment. They were not afraid even if there were a pile of things to take care of.</p>
<p>Their fingers were intertwined. Viola, as his wife and the empress of the state, wanted to lend even a little bit of her power to bring peace over the Slovenia Continent. That was the path to protecting Wendy…</p>
<p>And lastly, she would find God’s Companion.</p>
<p>Viola pulled on his shoulders. Then, after they kissed each other on the lips, they prayed to God.</p>
<p><em>Please let us love each other forever…</em></p>
