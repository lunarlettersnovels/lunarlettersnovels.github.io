            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 80 – Meetings (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>After riding the horse for a while, Viola felt refreshed. The place where they arrived was near the top of the mountain. In here, some attendants had already prepared enough food for the two of them. There was a wide table with nobody else around, and there was a lot of delicious food. When she looked closely, there were traces of a fire as if cooking was done here.</p>
<p>“Let’s eat.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>The two of them sat across from each other and ate. They had already eaten breakfast together, and now lunch … At this rate, were they going to have dinner together as well?</p>
<p>If she stayed with him all day, she wouldn’t be able to complete her own mission.</p>
<p>Viola hardly touched her food and made frequent eye contact with Lustian during the meal. After the meal, a maid appeared and poured wine for the two of them. It was as if they were on a picnic. The weather was neither too hot nor too cold.</p>
<p>She followed him again, and this time there was a shelter in a large area from where the imperial palace could be seen at a glance. It almost looked like a dream, the canopy with white lace sitting on a hill where wildflowers were blooming. Lustian sat on the sofa and tugged Viola’s wrist towards him. The two sat side by side and looked at the wide palace.</p>
<p>“That’s where His Majesty the Emperor lives. He’s traveling now, but you’ll meet him later. That there is the empress’s palace, and that place over there is where you were… .”</p>
<p>As he explained each location, she drew them out in her mind. Viola moved her eyes quickly. As she did, something caught her gaze – it was the old castle she had seen last time.</p>
<p>“Who lives there?”</p>
<p>“No one. It’s an abandoned castle.”</p>
<p>“Since it’s near the Lake of the God, maybe some greatly important person lived there?”</p>
<p>“Well… Maybe so. It is said in legends that it’s the place where gods lived.”</p>
<p>If so, it might be where the God of Judith lived. Seeing that the shrine was also near the lake, it was definitely a castle related to the gods somehow. For some reason, she kept thinking about it. She had felt it before too, and now that she saw it again, she kept wanting to go there.</p>
<p><em><strong>This chapter was brought to you by Lunar Letters. Please read at the original site.</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>《The place where He made love to a virgin… God of Judith secretly met a virgin there…》</p>
<p><em>Huh?!</em></p>
<p><em>Wait, what! What was that?! What was she thinking just now? How did she know that information?</em></p>
<p>Viola was so shocked, she swallowed a gasp.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lustian’s hand pulled and hugged her waist. It wasn’t nightfall and she didn’t want to be in his arms right now, but he seemed to think differently. He turned her chin to catch his gaze and whispered quietly…</p>
<p>“Look at me. Don’t think about anything else.”</p>
<p>“Shall we leave now?” she asked, in order to dissipate the ambiguous mood.</p>
<p>“I tried to create a good atmosphere, but I guess you don’t like it?” he complained.</p>
<p>“I don’t like this kind of atmosphere,” she said.</p>
<p>“Then what about going straight to the bedroom like this?”</p>
<p>Viola shot an icy glare at the man. He laughed and touched her cheek. Every place that his hands touched became warm.</p>
<p>“Make that expression more fiercely. It doesn’t matter when you’re in front of me, but you have no idea what other guys might want to do to you.”</p>
<p>As he tried to kiss her, Viola turned her head away. She didn’t want to make these kinds of memories. Since they were a contracted couple, they should stick to the contract – she really didn’t want to do this sort of thing.</p>
<p>“If you want to go to the bedroom, then let’s go. I don’t care. Don’t act so tenderly.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The sun had set now, and the surroundings had become dark. In the darkness, one woman got up and lit a lamp. A small light soon lit up in the dark forest. The woman walked through the forest quite quickly even with such a small light.</p>
<p>The place the woman arrived was the Judith River that ran deep in the mountains. The woman soaked her feet in the river and sang. When she sang 《Song of the River Judith》, a man appeared from underneath the water’s surface. It was a wonder how a person could appear from there. However, the person that had appeared was so beautiful as if he were not from this world.</p>
<p>The woman knelt in front of him. The man looked at the woman with a gentle expression.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll wait for him here.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Carriages were arriving one by one at the abandoned mansion on the border of Koronis. Each black wagon had no family insignia drawn as if it didn’t want to reveal its identity. Only the creaking sound of the wagon wheels rang aloud, the black wagons themselves were dead quiet.</p>
<p>From inside the wagons, strong men stepped down. They didn’t want to reveal their identities, so they wore black robes and looked around quickly before entering the mansion.</p>
<p>The old coachman, having waited for the last guest to arrive led him to a more intimate place. The smell of burning torches filled the air, but a dark shadow still hid the man’s face.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’m late.”</p>
<p>The man bowed his head towards those who had already arrived. When he lifted his head and removed his robes, his beautiful golden hair came down to his shoulders.</p>
<p>“The Farus Kingdom has arrived late, I see. Please sit down.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>The man was the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Farus. He was also the younger brother of Princess Guinev who had disappeared. Those who were gathered in front of him were also royalty. It was the first time that the royal families from all over the land had gathered together. Since this was his first time in this sort of position, the crown prince looked towards the most elderly-looking man in the room as if relying upon him.</p>
<p>He was the king of the Kingdom of Koronis. The only kingdom without a crown prince to succeed the throne…</p>
<p>“I’ve finally unlocked the key.”</p>
<p>“Is that true?”</p>
<p>“It was very difficult. If it weren’t for the wizard who studied the history of the origins of Arpen for 50 years, it would have been near impossible.”</p>
<p>“So, are the rumors true?”</p>
<p>A light of hope shone on the faces of the gathered royalty. If things went well, it would truly be a relief to no longer have to obey the Arpen Empire.</p>
