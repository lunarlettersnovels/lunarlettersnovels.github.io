            <p><strong>Chapter 124</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>He didn’t intend to tell her about his anxieties. Lustian wished that he and Viola would never have to leave each other. And in our lives, an additional person would…</p>
<p>She kept coming into view. Wendy was so adorable, beautiful, and lovable.</p>
<p>Aren’t they way too similar-looking… to be sisters? I… wouldn’t be surprised if she was her daughter…!!!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lustian stopped in his tracks. He felt like someone abruptly hit him across the head.</p>
<p>Wendy is… seven years old?!</p>
<p>Wendy ran right up to Viola, grabbed her hand, and spun around.</p>
<p>Lustian’s mouth dried up. He felt a lump in his throat. He traced his memories back to everything that happened previously. He recalled the conversation between Viola and the nanny.</p>
<p>“She looks just like when you were a princess. When you were young, you used to always pretend to swordfight.”</p>
<p>His head was spinning. He opened his eyes wide and watched Viola’s actions.</p>
<p>When Wendy stepped on the long dress and fell, she was shocked and lifted her up to wipe the dirt off her clothes. After she wiped the dirt off her own hands, she gave her a kiss on her tiny hand.</p>
<p>His heart was beat madly at the sight before him, echoing in his ears.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>He needed to check right away. Did she really belong to the bloodline of the King of Koronis? He couldn’t handle not finding out whose daughter Wendy was. Lustian summoned the handmaiden over.</p>
<p>“Did Viola also have the medicine that the princesses had?”</p>
<p>“Yes, all of the candidates followed national law and had the medicine.”</p>
<p>“Are the effects of the medicine palpable?”</p>
<p>“Of course. This is a specialized medicine that prevents pregnancy, so they must have it.”</p>
<p>Lustian licked the inside of his own mouth. Since the princesses were on the pill while staying here, there was not a single person that was pregnant for ten years. That pill was surely meant for birth control. However, he was curious as to what ingredients they used to make the pill.</p>
<p>“It can’t just stop at birth control. There must be more than meets the eye, correct?”</p>
<p>Lustian was suspicious of that pill because Ivan’s mother also went to God’s Companion. Of course, his mother may have not taken the pill on purpose, but he was curious because it could’ve been the opposite.</p>
<p>I thought she was God’s Companion….</p>
<p>He thought back to of the previous emperor’s words. Now that he thought of it, he had begun to think that he said those words with regards to Ivan’s mother instead of Guinev.</p>
<p>The handmaiden seemed to be worried. Lustian looked at her for a while. Now she was spending her life as the handmaiden, but she was also the bridesmaid that once received a divine message. She was the woman that became the eyes and ears of the previous emperor, so she would have been sharing a lot of information. Of course, it was definite that she also knew a lot about the pill.</p>
<p>“Handmaiden.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“What sort of person are you?”</p>
<p>The handmaiden lifted up her head. She stood by the emperor’s mother’s side as soon as the previous emperor passed away, but her loyalty for the previous emperor ran deep.</p>
<p>“I rightfully belong to Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Even if Ivan ended up being the emperor instead of me, you would still be on his side, correct?”</p>
<p>“Our household was destined to have a gift in serving every Emperor. Thus, since you are the current Emperor, I shall remain loyal to you, Lustian.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll depend on your loyalty. What is the birth control pill that the princesses have to take made of? It isn’t just a birth control pill, is it?”</p>
<p>The handmaiden hesitated. She flinched and leaned back. “That is correct. The pill is also made out of the Judith flower, not just for the purposes of birth control.”</p>
<p>“…!!!”</p>
<p>Lustian clenched his fist. “Tell me more of what you know. Is it also true that Ivan’s mother was pregnant with Ivan even though she had the pill?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is correct.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes trembled. Suddenly, his body went rigid.</p>
<p>Of course, the emperor wasn’t referring to Guinev, but instead Ivan’s mother!</p>
<p>“If you become pregnant after taking the pill, you are qualified to be God’s Companion. Even if you don’t meet the requirements, just that single qualification is enough.”</p>
<p>His heart sank.</p>
<p>Viola is God’s Companion!</p>
<p>Even if she didn’t satisfy the other conditions, she became pregnant despite taking the pill from the Judith flower. For that reason, the imperial members that had to follow God’s duties slept with the princesses. If they couldn’t pass through the barrier, the easiest way to be God’s Companion was through pregnancy so…</p>
<p>I couldn’t protect my love, but it might be different with you.</p>
<p>That was the last thing that the previous emperor told Lustian before he took his last breath. As soon as Ivan was born, his mother was locked up in an abandoned tower in God’s territory. And there were records that she died there. Since she wasn’t God’s Companion, it was likely that she went blind and lost her memories as Guinev did and died alone. Even if she looked at the man she loved, he wouldn’t be aware of that love…</p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes were bloodshot. His eyes were full of resentment towards the previous emperor.</p>
<p>What is the reason for these ridiculous pledges? Why on earth! Why!</p>
<p>As soon as he clenched his fist, the blue veins on the back of his hand protruded. He opened his mouth, but couldn’t say anything. His chest was burning.</p>
<p>Wendy… Wendy… To think she is my child….</p>
<p>My… child….</p>
<p>“Bring me Kyle! Now!”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Lustian pretended to have a calm demeanor. But deep inside, he was burning with anxiety.</p>
<p>We need to check on them before they come up with a plan.</p>
