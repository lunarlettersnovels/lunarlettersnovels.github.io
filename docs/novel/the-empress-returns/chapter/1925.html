            <p><strong>Chapter 38 – Pretenses (1)</strong></p>
<p>The commander of the imperial knights may not have fixed working hours, but she guessed that he would return when the prince went to sleep. This meant that he would usually come back at night when the moon was high up in the sky.</p>
<p>Viola looked in the direction of the moon. Naturally, from living in a forest all her life, she had learned how to measure time by the path of the moon. She kept walking and soon she saw the magic wall. She threw herself with all her might against the towering stone, her body was sucked in through to the other side.</p>
<p>Viola felt a presence nearby. She hurriedly plucked flowers at random and held it in her arms. She turned a corner in the labyrinth-like winding path and found a man standing in front of the central fountain.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her heart pounded. She saw his broad back and remembered the shoulders would have her teeth marks on them. “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>He didn’t turn around, and instead just moved his hands towards some flowers. His hands swept over the ones with violet petals. The fireflies flying between the flowers shined brightly around him, making him look dazzling. It was breathtaking.</p>
<p>“I’ve been very busy today,” he said, “it seems you were, too.”</p>
<p>He plucked the flower and turned around. Viola gulped. <em>Does he know?</em></p>
<p>“I tried to sleep all day but couldn’t,” she said.</p>
<p>“Well, it was very taxing for you all night yesterday,” he said smiling.</p>
<p>The wind blew on his well-cut black hair, and his black eyes looked even darker. He looked at the flowers Viola was holding. She had picked them in a rush, so they were crooked. Some petals had fallen off. He laughed when he saw them. Suddenly, she felt a prick in her palms. It felt like she had been stabbed by a thorn. Lune pulled the pile of flowers out of Viola’s hand and threw them aside. Then he gave her the flower he had just picked.</p>
<p>“This suits you better… The mixture of your fragrance and the scent of the flower sets my heart ablaze,” he said. He seized her by the waist and pulled her close. He held her chin and tried to kiss her, but Viola turned her head away. He looked at her inquisitively.</p>
<p>“The imperial villa is too stuffy. Can I at least take a walk once a day?” she asked, hoping he would oblige.</p>
<p>“This place is big, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“If I leave the palace as your wife, it will be difficult for me to peacefully take a stroll,” she insisted.</p>
<p>“Why?” he looked at her questioningly.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be involved in social circles for a while. I want to look around the palace though, it just looks wonderful,” she said, looking at him, “I would rather do it with you. Will you show me around?”</p>
<p>“Well … Is it necessary?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Do you need permission from the Crown Prince?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m allowed anywhere in the imperial palace, even the private areas.”</p>
<p>“Then show me around,” Viola said to him affectionately.</p>
<p>She felt a hesitation in her heart, but she needed to do this, even if it meant taking advantage of somebody who was in love with her. After all, her priority was to somehow get into the Imperial Archives. Viola decided to put up a fool’s persona for now, as what she would see and hear in the imperial palace would be of great strategic help in the future when she became the Queen of Koronis. Although it made her sick to the stomach, she endured and plastered a false smile.</p>
<p>“That smile … it’s the only thing I want. To see you happy.” He gently stroked her cheek and kissed her, making her heart pound. He kissed her deeply, her mind melted at lips that became frantic. She was weak with pleasure. She felt her vision blur. With an effort, she pulled her lips away.</p>
<p>“I have been wanting to kiss you all day,” he said, “your lips have haunted me.” He pulled her in and kissed her passionately till both of them were gasping for breath. An uncontrollable heat took hold of her body as his tongue explored hers. When they broke apart, Viola’s cheeks were as red as a rose, which he stroked lovingly.</p>
<p>“If you want to take a tour, it would be better at night. Less people, and less stuffy,” he said brushing her cheeks tenderly, “Also, don’t go out all alone. What if you get in trouble?”</p>
<p>“—Okay,” she replied.</p>
<p>“Okay then, I’ll trust you.”</p>
<p>Viola nodded and holding hands they went towards the imperial villa. She couldn’t refuse to kiss him, when he said he wouldn’t stay the night.</p>
