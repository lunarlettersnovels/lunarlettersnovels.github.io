<p><strong>Chapter 121 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Following the line of her neck, he kissed Viola as he repeatedly sucked on her lips. Lustian rubbed her body like a beast in heat. Just then, the best org*sm overcame her. His muscles twitched. She felt hazy. She felt like her eyes were rolling back because of how he thrust into her and did however he pleased with her body.</p>
<p>“Ah, ahhh….”</p>
<p>Her lower area was so swollen it felt like it would rip apart. His manhood, which was more akin to a club, was so hot made the inside of her cave moist. Every single one of his movements and hand motions brought her to her climax. His face was more beautiful than anyone else’s in the world. He licked her lips incessantly, inserted his tongue as he kissed her while his waist shook like mad.</p>
<p>He put his lips to her nape and strongly sucked on it. She was shocked at how the strong sucking made her feel like the piece of her skin was going to come off. The thick tongue coming up her throat swept across the inside of her mouth and tickled the roof of her tongue. Viola frantically put her arms around Lustian’s back. Then with a slamming sound, he made large strides. The chilling adrenaline made her body ache.</p>
<p>It was so good… It felt so good that tears flowed out naturally.</p>
<p>“Soon it’ll be your birthday, correct? If you want anything, keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“Before that, I have a request.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Lustian tilted his head.</p>
<p>“There is a bridesmaid that I hope lives in the empress’s palace. I am telling you this because this requires the permission of Your Highness.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Along with a luxurious feast came a line of the fancy spread of wines, and the chess-shaped floor, specially made for the ball, was shimmering. The royal husbands dressed in party suits and the royal wives in fancy dresses looked very joyful. Since it was only a few times a year that there was a party that had the imperial family and aristocrats gathered in one place, all the aristocrats in the region were in attendance.</p>
<p>Today was Viola’s birthday. Since the star was Viola, she invited whoever she wanted to her party. While greeting her guests, she discovered completely unexpected people inside the hall. They looked at each other’s faces as if they also weren’t expecting her.</p>
<p>“It has been a long time.”</p>
<p>“…I heard that you have become the empress.”</p>
<p>He was the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Farus. Though Lustian didn’t look pleased, he didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>What Viola wanted as a present was to invite everyone in the royal family who came as hostages. Viola tried to open up a path to unity. It was because Slovenia’s peace was just as important as finding God’s Companion.</p>
<p>“Thank you for delivering the news of Guinev. Her mother now can rest easy, but now I don’t know how to repay you.”</p>
<p>“Of course through the things you have to do.”</p>
<p>Just then, the other members of the family greeted Viola. They looked very cheerful. It seemed that deep inside their intention to make the princesses’ sacrifices for an arranged marriage tugged at their conscience. It was a relief since they didn’t seem to harbor any hostility against Viola, she was hopeful that they could untie the knot.</p>
<p>Just as she started laughing and talking to them, Lustian suddenly came up to them and split them apart.</p>
<p>“Dance with me. The little one is also dancing now.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Just then, when she turned around, Wendy and the crown prince were dancing. Since they were at a similar age, they suited each other. People looked at the two proudly. It was adorable. Viola smiled from ear to ear.</p>
<p>When the royal couple started dancing, the aristocrats formed around them a big circle. But then the song changed. This time, since it was the kind of the song where you switched partners, they repeated the same movements, and when they spun around, they would switch to another partner.</p>
<p>Viola’s partner turned out to be Ivan.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the reason why you would call her out to the empress’ palace. Wouldn’t she be jealous as a woman?”</p>
<p>“It’s in case any lustful officials do anything shameful to the bridesmaid.”</p>
<p>Besides the time Viola prayed in the morning, she was ordered to spend the rest of her time staying at the palace. She wanted to stand by her side, taking care of her like she was her kin.</p>
<p>“Even if she did become a bridesmaid, doesn’t the fact that she’s part of the royal family mean that… they wouldn’t do anything shameful to her without her permission?”</p>
<p>“Given the things I’ve seen, we can’t be sure of that. I’ve witnessed them reveling after drinking a love potion so… just because they’re officials, it doesn’t mean we can trust them.”</p>
<p>“They won’t do that anymore.”</p>
<p>“Make Anne happy. The most important person to you, Grand Duke, is you after all.”</p>
<p>From the distance, Anne was staring at Viola. When the time finally came to switch partners, she danced with one of the people who arrived as hostages. He whispered softly in Viola’s ear. He was the brother of the princess who made a final promise to Viola before he left.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, if you need any help, please tell me anytime. Our kingdom stands by you.”</p>
<p>“What? What do you… mean…”</p>
<p>“The princess has changed a lot. The adults of the royal household were shocked at how she sold her precious jewels and shared bread with young children. They even said that it was a miracle that the princess whose only devotion were parties and bodily pleasures was no more. It was for that reason that I found out about the empress. The king told me that he would put in the effort to help you if you needed it.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Even just hearing that made her happy. She knew that what she did was nothing, but she felt proud seeing that it came back to her in the form of luck.</p>
<p>He kissed her on the back of her hand. Just then, Lustian, ignoring the next switch, grabbed Viola’s waist.</p></div>
