            <p><strong>Chapter 169</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Viola and Paul rode their horses to God’s Forest. The forest was calm, without a gust of wind blowing. She gulped as she stood amid the trees connected to the realm of God. Her mind was filled with the idea of finding the map.</p>
<p><em>I must find it. No matter what…</em></p>
<p>Viola stretched on over into the forest and her body moved as if it was being sucked in. She quickly looked around with a pounding heart. Holding her breath, she headed to the castle cautiously.</p>
<p><em>[Careful. You must be careful. God will be keeping an eye on you.]</em></p>
<p>Right then, small butterflies started circling around her, whispering. She felt those butterflies were spirits from the moment they started speaking to her.</p>
<p><em>[We will help you…  Go, go on…]</em></p>
<p>She escaped the wind with the help of spirits. She could see the spirits riding the wind to stop her scent from spreading. In the meantime, she quickly reached the palace.</p>
<p>As soon as she descended the stairs connected to the basement, damp darkness swallowed her body. As if it were alive, it felt like the darkness was touching her.</p>
<p><em>Calm down. And remember.</em></p>
<p>Stepping on the last step, she recalled the stride she counted from her dream. <em>50 steps from here… 40… 48… </em>One by one it all jogged back to her. Even if the darkness concealed her vision, it was enough to find the place. Walking forward, while feeling around the walls, she suddenly stopped.</p>
<p><em><strong>“God is testing our love. Please… Judith… don’t be blinded.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em>What is this memory?</em></p>
<p>Viola swallowed a scream amid her dizzying memory. Her eyelids started burning.</p>
<p><em>I haven’t abandoned you. I… I…’</em></p>
<p>Right then, she heard another voice. The voice belonged to Lune from the illusion she saw in the realm of God last time. Maiden’s memories were rushing in like waves. Just when she tried to trace the memory, the spirit grabbed the hem of her clothes.</p>
<p><em>[Over here! We don’t have time. That memory isn’t important. Come… come! Your love won this battle, too. Quickly…]</em></p>
<p>Viola shivered. As she concentrated on the memories, she lost her determination of finding the map. She hurried to the room she’d seen in her dream. Stepping inside, she saw an empty room, without a desk or a chair.</p>
<p><em>Where is it? Where did they hide it? Remember! Viola!</em></p>
<p>She harked back to her past memories. If she had to hide it, she wouldn’t have hidden it simply. Right then, she saw bumpy bricks sticking out.  Fumbling, she approached them one by one. She focused and moved as if she was trying to read the memories carved on the old stones. Of course, she saw something in the memory. The place that’s clearly spread out!</p>
<p>Opening her eyes wide, she pushed one of the bricks with force. At once the door opened with a rattle and thick smoke.</p>
<p>“Cough… cough…”</p>
<p>Covered in dust, as soon as she stepped inside she saw a table. On it sat an old parchment.</p>
<p>“This is it!”</p>
<p>Viola grabbed the parchment and looked inside. It was the map.</p>
<p><em>Of course, I found it!</em></p>
<p>She rolled up the map, slid it into the container she had brought in advance, and tied it tightly behind her back. Now she had to hurry out. She went back upstairs, her pace impatient.</p>
<p>It was when Viola worriedly bit her lips and came out safely, the spirit let out a shriek. And just as the spirit did, she also felt the danger.</p>
<p><em>[Judith! God!]</em></p>
<p>There was no time to escape. At that moment, an old barn came into her sight. She dashed towards it as if she could fly. As soon as she hid, a wave formed in the river, and God rose out of it.</p>
<p>Through the woods, Viola looked at God’s figure. He had a tall frame and short hair, He looked around as if He had noticed something strange. Her heart thumped loudly.</p>
<p><em>[All we can do is catch your smell. Don’t get caught.]</em></p>
<p>The spirits were trembling. She bit her lips hard and stopped breathing.</p>
<p>She heard God’s voice from out there. He seemed to be in rage that Lustian won once again. His voice rang loudly throughout the forest.  Her heart felt like it would explode. If she were caught here, she would inevitably have to become His companion. It was clear that He would take her with Him by force</p>
<p><em>My baby… please… protect me…</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, someone who seemed to be His servant appeared from the wave. She observed their actions all the while holding her breath. As if having a meeting with several Gods, He gave directions. Viola couldn’t hear, but it was clear that He was scheming something new.</p>
<p>Sweat ran down her forehead from tension. It fell from her forehead onto the ground. The spirit let out a scream once again.</p>
<p><em>[Your body fluid can’t touch the ground! What should we do? He’ll think this is strange!]</em></p>
<p><em>Oh!</em></p>
<p>Viola’s heart dropped. To her surprise, God looked at where she was hiding. She could see Him tilt His head and walk in her direction. She turned pale.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s over! Lune! Lune!’</em></p>
<p>She shut her eyes. And right at that moment, someone stopped God in his footsteps. She heard His enraged voice. He yelled wildly and cursed at someone. Viola snapped back into reality. Looking at God among the woods, she saw someone unimaginable standing into his side.</p>
