            <p><strong>Chapter 25 – A Sickening Truth (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Livyuna</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p><em>Proofreader: Livyuna</em></p>
<p>“Ahh! Ahhh!”</p>
<p>“This is great. Tighten it. Tighter!”</p>
<p>The man twisted his waist and thrust into the woman.</p>
<p>“Ahh … ahhh …. Grand duke—”</p>
<p>“Ugh … uhh … good, right? How is it? I’m better than Lustian aren’t I?” His hoarse voice sounded.</p>
<p>“It feels good … Ugh—” The woman’s moans were a testament to her feelings.</p>
<p>Another man put a finger in a woman’s vag*na and shook it as he sucked on her br*asts making her pant. It was simply carnal sex between the crown prince’s concubine and a member of the imperial family.</p>
<p>Viola felt rage burst forth from within her. It made her sick to the stomach. She couldn’t fathom where the rumor that the concubines loved the crown prince stemmed from.</p>
<p>Then, a man stuck out to her eye. She didn’t know why but he looked like he was the crown prince. Black hair, black eyes, and a sturdy build … <em>No way … there was no way the crown prince was crazy enough to have sex with his sex slaves while with his own brothers.</em> That man stuck his face in a woman’s dark p*bic hair under her flipped over dress, grabbed her breasts, and crazily licked her vag*na.</p>
<p>“Ahhh. Please do it more … Ugh—” She called out in a shrill voice.</p>
<p>“I’ll put it in, to your heart’s content,” he smiled lewdly and replied.</p>
<p>The woman grabbed her br*ast and shook her waist at him. He smiled and buried his huge flesh into her core. Immediately a loud moan rang out, simultaneously with a wet smacking noise. The man was still clothed as he penetrated her. The woman moaned and hugged the man’s waist. This was sex … down to its crudest form, like the beasts in the wild … without a sense of propriety or shame. Here was the harshest truth of a human desire in its naked form and quite literally too.</p>
<p><em>‘This is the crown prince’s concubines’ palace! This means that women here must be the crown prince’s concubines … No way, was this a secret affair? Were the concubines having other men without the crown prince’s knowledge?’</em></p>
<p>Viola’s hands shook. She had entered the empire under the same conditions, but the women in front of her were too crude and debaucherous. The concubines were skilled, meaning this wasn’t the first time they had this kind of party. Their eyes were unfocused and all they did was look at the men with lustful orbs moaning at the pleasure they gave them.</p>
<p><em>How could something like this …</em></p>
<p>Who would have thought that there would be a swingers party deep inside the crown prince’s palace? And with princesses from various countries no less … It was a tremendous shock that they were having secret orgies.</p>
<p><em>‘You will become a plaything of the imperial family, and even if you are thrown away you will still be a sex slave. Ho, ho, ho!’</em></p>
<p>Viola was in shock. She turned her head to look elsewhere when her eyes were drawn to a certain woman who stuck out- amongst all the naked bodies she was the only one sitting shyly.</p>
<p><em>‘Which kingdom’s princess is she? Could she perhaps know something about Guinev?’</em></p>
<p>Viola pretended to clean up but kept her attention on the woman. When she saw her get up and leave, she followed closely. The woman’s pale complexion returned to normal as soon as she left the party. Viola took a good look at her when she stopped walking. She looked sad and lonely; anxiously kept biting her lips and sighing.</p>
<p>Viola grasped the disposition of the woman by her actions and facial expressions. She was at least not one of those obscene princesses. She couldn’t be 100 percent sure but from the way she detached herself from the others she was clearly different from the others.</p>
<p>She approached her as if she had been waiting for her there, as the woman sighed heavily and looked up at the sky. Feeling her presence, she cast her eyes on Viola.</p>
<p>“Who … are you a new maid?” said she.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you for the first time. I’m Viola of the Kingdom of Koronis, I recently came to the imperial villa to receive the Crown Princess Candidate training.”</p>
<p>The woman’s eyes widened. It was a big gamble for Viola to reveal her identity like this.</p>
<p>“— To think that I am already seeing the next candidate after me … It’s shocking!” She recomposed and introduced herself. “My name is Anne from the Kingdom of Luana. It’s nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>The two met for the first time, but there was no animosity between them. She was a new candidate, but they would both end up in the same position of being part of the harem.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I was shocked. What I saw earlier was—” Viola was the first to breach the subject.</p>
<p>“Yes, this isn’t the concubine’s palace. That’s the imperial family’s harem, anyone with imperial blood can have their way with the princesses.” Anne revealed the dastardly truth.</p>
<p>“I had no idea.” Viola sighed. What she had seen, was something no one back in Koronis knew, how could she be privy to them?</p>
<p>“It’s natural not to know. Who would speak of such baseness in their kingdom? It wasn’t enough that we were taken as hostages, but that we have become no better than sex slaves—” Her eyes involuntarily turned moist.</p>
<p>“Does the Crown Prince know about this?” Viola queried.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if he knows. He doesn’t care about what happens to the princesses who in the first place came in as hostages. He abandoned us, all forgotten after the first night.”</p>
<p>Her loneliness hung in the air, helplessness loomed casting its bitterest shadow. Viola felt pity for her and at the same time anger towards the imperial family. How could they treat women as such …</p>
<p>“But the irony of it all is that it is all consensual sex. I don’t know what’s the point of consent when it’s after we are high on drugs but still. Isn’t it funny?” Her eyes were full of mockery. Abandoned by family and people, thrown to wolves, and subjected to a life worse than death … was there anything more miserable?</p>
