<p><strong>Chapter 125</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>It was important to check on it right away. Lustian explicitly told Kyle that any physical piece of DNA from Wendy’s body would suffice, and to bring it to him.</p>
<p>It had only been three hours since the order was given out before the commander of the knights brought it over.</p>
<p>“She had a fall today and was bleeding in the knee. I brought over the handkerchief that I used to wipe it off.”</p>
<p>“Kyle, I must become a father.”</p>
<p>Lustian took out a small dagger and gripped it with his hand.</p>
<p>“Pardon? What do you… Huh? Y-Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>Right away, he cut the palm of his hand. Shocked, Kyle got up right away and took out the handkerchief with Wendy’s blood on it. Lustian brought it over to stop the bleeding on his palm. Finally, Kyle’s eyes went wide as he came to terms with something.</p>
<p>“What is going on?!”</p>
<p>“I need to confirm whether Wendy is my daughter.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>Kyle was scared out of his wits, but then it seemed as though he understood Lustian’s intentions. It tends to be the people surrounding them that are keener to the natural affinity that one would have towards the people of their bloodline. Given that Kyle knew Lustian better than anyone else, he would’ve also been suspicious.</p>
<p>“I was wondering if that was the case but… Since she was on the pill, I did not expect it at all.”</p>
<p>“The pill was meant to determine who was God’s Companion. She didn’t become pregnant as a result of another man’s sperm, but it’s a special kind of pill that makes it so that if anyone out of the people who took the pill resembled God’s Companion closely, they would become pregnant.”</p>
<p>“——” Kyle face displayed agony.</p>
<p>“Take this and go to the Southern Temple. There will be an official who performs odd experiments. He may seem mad, but he’s very competent. Go to him and find out about it.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“The blood on the handkerchief is yours to keep. Remember that.”</p>
<p>“Even if my head was severed, I will keep it a secret,” Kyle declared solemnly.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Right away, Kyle headed to the Southern Temple.</p>
<p>The official that used his own eccentric hobbies for his studies was very skillful. He made a cure for sterility, and he received clients who wanted to determine if the children they gave birth to were their own. Dealing with high-level nobility in exchange for back money, the pay-off was enormous. Though he wasn’t mindful of his position as an official and was making deals based on back money, he was a valuable asset for the nobles that would get wrapped up in bothersome issues from time to time. The imperial family would usually request discreet meetings with him if a child came from the government or if somebody came forward claiming ownership of a child.</p>
<p>“I was surprised… to see that you Sir Kyle would come over by yourself.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been wrapped up in a bothersome issue.” Kyle looked distraught over Lustian’s command.</p>
<p>Just then, the official grinned as if he noticed something. “That’s understandable. Everybody makes mistakes. Let’s have a look.”</p>
<p>Showing his yellow teeth, the official took the handkerchief that Kyle handed over to him. He put the handkerchief on a wide silver plate. Then, after going inside a room that had many potions stacked up on top of each other, he brought over a bottle. He went on to pour out the solution to the point that the handkerchief was thoroughly soaked.</p>
<p>“Now we just have to wait. It’ll only be a little while until you can find out.”</p>
<p>“You’ll have to keep this a secret.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Do you think I would dare to disclose a secret from the Grand Master of the Imperial House? Hu hu….”</p>
<p>Eventually, the handkerchief was bubbling. Surprised, the official closed the round tray.</p>
<p>“Is it usually like this?”</p>
<p>“Ha… Yes. This is a very unusual case, but it’s because that child’s blood runs thick.”</p>
<p>“By thick, do you mean….”</p>
<p>“It’s not just the mixture of the blood of two people, but beyond that. It’s the fact that her father’s lineage is so valuable. It also means that the child’s father’s lineage is so valuable that it comes close to the imperial family.”</p>
<p>“So!! Does the child belong to me?” Kyle shouted.</p>
<p>Just then, the official looked at him and chuckled. “Congratulations. If the duke hears this from me, he’ll be very pleased.”</p>
<p>“I’ll pay you double for keeping your mouth shut.”</p>
<p>Kyle took two leather pockets from his cloak and lifted them up with a flourish. As he did, the official’s mouth spread wide apart.</p>
<p>“Yes… O-of course! I shall keep my lips sealed. Do not fret.”</p>
<p>With an anxious look on his face, Kyle hurried out of the temple, causing him to almost bump into the person walking in.</p>
<p>“Kyle? What are you….”</p>
<p>“Ah, I had something to take care of briefly.”</p>
<p>It was Ivan. When he looked behind him, he could also see Anne entering the temple together. Since the biggest worry in the imperial family was sterility, many members of the family would often visit the official, so it seemed that the Grand Duke couple had the same worry.</p>
<p>It was quite awkward to see each other in the same place, but Kyle walked past them acting like it wasn’t a big deal.</p>
<p>Ivan tilted his head seeing the other rushing off.</p>
<p><em>What is a man who has never had a relationship in his life doing here?</em></p>
<p>Just then, Anne opened her mouth quietly. “I shall go back.”</p>
<p>“Were you not the one who wanted the medicine from the temple? Why have you changed your mind now?”</p>
<p>“It was just an impulse. It doesn’t concern me, so you Grand Duke must take it.”</p>
<p>“Are you… saying that I’m the reason for our infertility?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Anne spat those words with a chilling tone and turned her back on him.</p>
<p>Ivan, who stared at Anne’s back, looked down at his own lower body.</p>
<p>“This is not something that’ll be solved by a pill. The priority should be to find God’s Companion and undo the curse of the Imperial House.”</p>
<p>He thought that since he had come all that way… He went inside thinking that he should meet the official. The official was not there. Hearing a commotion coming from upstairs, it seemed that he was going through the warehouse again in search of something.</p>
