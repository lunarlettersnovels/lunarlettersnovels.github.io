            <p><strong>Chapter 44 – No Rest (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>A smile hung on his lips, his heart joyful that at least her body was excited by him. Then he touched her c0re making her bend back like a bow.</p>
<p>“Just… Do it”</p>
<p>“You have to touch it a bit before putting it in.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t need any of that. So… just—”</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to get hurt so I’ll lick it.”</p>
<p>When he looked down, he was stunned. Her forest was a different colour, unlike her stiff brown hair.</p>
<p><em>Dark blonde? Her hair should be the same color as her pub!c hair, right?</em></p>
<p>As the thought suddenly rushed through his mind, his hands reflexively grabbed her hair. Her hair roots were a different color.</p>
<p>“You, did you … Did you dye your hair? Were you blonde?” he asked, his heart thumping as he did.</p>
<p>“I heard that the imperial family loves blondes, so of course I had to hide that too.”</p>
<p>“Haaa…. true, the imperial family loves blondes. Of course, there are some who don’t.”</p>
<p>“… What? Ugh….”</p>
<p>He buried his face into her golden bush. She let out a quiet exclamation as soon his tongue plung3ed into her core.</p>
<p>“M0@n … Viola.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… no….”</p>
<p>Viola’s waist writhed side to side. It was evident that she felt exhilarated but was holding back her m0@n. She clenched her lips and grabbed the sheets. The longer this went on, the more Lustian wanted to bring out her m0@ns. It bothered him how she held it in even though she felt good. She could just enjoy it; it shouldn’t hurt one’s pride.</p>
<p>He licked up her l0ve ju!ces as soon as they streamed down. He liked its taste and the feeling of it going down his throat. Although her nectar shouldn’t have a taste, it somehow felt sweet and smelled like Judith flowers to him. In fact, her cave looked like a closed flower bud which was very pretty. He suddenly regretted not seeing it when it was still pure.</p>
<p>Lustian frowned but a bright smile soon replaced it.</p>
<p>Unrelentingly his tongue coursed her core. A blue vein rose on the back of Viola’s hand and she grabbed Lustian’s shoulder. Her th!ghs were twitching with impatience.</p>
<p>Lustian wanted to completely dominate her. He wanted to tame her body so that she couldn’t live without him.</p>
<p>“Ha… Heuk….”</p>
<p>His tongue went in and out her little flower. He pried open the flower bud and put his tongue in and out. He tasted both her nectar and hot inner walls at the same time. Her body constantly dripped nectar. His m@nh00d got so hard and big that it seemed like it would explode at any moment.</p>
<p>“Ack…!”</p>
<p>“Haa… haa…. . It’s sweet as honey.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t think straight due to his rampaging tongue. She couldn’t keep up with the pace of his ministrations, so all she could do was pant. She was suffocating and in the end, let out a low m0@n from the thrilling sensation stimulating her cl!t.</p>
<p>That sight ar0used Lustian even more. He stuck his h2rdness atop of her soaked core. Viola’s eyes trembled.</p>
<p>“I’m going to start now. I don’t know if you can endure when it’s on a bed. Bite my shoulder if you have to.”</p>
<p>Viola clenched her bottom. Her body was burning with excitement. Her opened eyes were now filled with resolve, but her blue irises drunk on ple@sure just became another tempt@tion for him. His heart beat harder and faster. He thrust down hard as his fiery eyes looked into her blue ones.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>He was a scary man, he would go at it again as soon as he finished. Her whole body was sweaty and sticky, core was full of their body fluids.</p>
<p>“I need a break.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be harder for you if we rest. I’ll just do it one more time.”</p>
<p>“Ack…!”</p>
<p>S*x consumed a lot of stamina, but it was her mind that was more tired than her body. His caress made her lose her senses. There was an enchanting fragrance that lingered around him.</p>
<p>His lips crept down little by little from her neck to her n!pple and bit it. He then licked her pink peaks frantically with his tongue. He tried to relax her tense body by gently lapping a circle around her stiffness.</p>
<p>It worked. Viola’s entire body started to relax and her mind started going hazy. Her core responded, ready to accept him back in. The er0t!c atmosphere continued to linger on.</p>
<p>Had she always been such a l3wd woman? It hadn’t been long since they had finished just a moment ago and she was this wet again?</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>“Nobody sucked on this part of your body before right, this place right here… I like that a lot.”</p>
<p>Her body shook a little. His touch became a little stronger. He sucked on her erect n!pples like a baby as he gathered her peaks together. He licked them even as he panted roughly. A faint m0@n flowed from her lips.</p>
<p>“Haa… haa… I’m the first one here, and I’m the first down there.”</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
