            <p><strong>Chapter 92 – The Loser (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Lustian rolled his tongue and licked Viola’s finger.  All the places where his tongue touched burned hot.</p>
<p>“Ahhh—”</p>
<p>They did it three times in a row. Her lower part was completely drenched as his s*men mixed with her fluids. She did not even have the strength to lift a finger. The s*x that had started at sunset went on until the moon rose and didn’t stop until the sun showed up.</p>
<p><em>Is it what it feels like to having s*x all night long?</em></p>
<p>He had released a lot of his seed that she was worried she would get pregnant despite the supplements she was taking. The amount of the semen collected inside was significant to the extent it was overflowing from her core.</p>
<p>Viola gasped and trembled as he thrust his finger in. Her whole body drooped and sank as if in a swamp, but the moment his finger came in, she got wet again.</p>
<p>“It seems you got hurt.”</p>
<p>“It’s f..fine—”</p>
<p>As caressing underneath with his finger was not enough, he opened her thighs wide and examined the va*ina carefully.</p>
<p><em>Did he worry about lacerations or tears caused by s*x? No, right… I think he is more concerned about not being able to accept him for a while rather than my well-being.</em></p>
<p>She turned her exhausted body around. Immediately his solid arms pulled her by the waist. His warm  breath against her back was overwhelming. The afterglow lingered and her inner muscle had yet to calm down. As Viola turned her head and stared into his eyes, she clenched harder.</p>
<p>She also considered herself obscene. The more they were indulging in s*x, the more pleasure she felt as her body kept on wanting him. It could not be helped. Unlike her mind, the fact that her body opened to him was just resentful.</p>
<p>A drowsy feeling washed over her. Beyond the lingering consciousness, a bright smile that she’d once seen on his face had disappeared.</p>
<p>“The one who falls in love first will lose… Right…Even this time, you won again. Viola…!”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>When Viola came to her senses, she was already in her chambers at the Concubines’ Palace.  <em>How did I get here? </em>Viola jumped to her feet while wondering.</p>
<p>“Rosha!” She called out.</p>
<p>The little maid came in through the door.</p>
<p>“How is Paul? The Blood Army didn’t find him, right?”</p>
<p>“I am here.” Paul entered gingerly.</p>
<p>Viola looked at him, ascertaining his well-being first. She carefully examined his arms and legs, including his face. It was fortunate that there was no injury. She heaved a sigh.</p>
<p>“What a relief. I thought we were gonna get caught.”</p>
<p>Viola’s body stumbled as her legs became weak. Fortunately, Paul grabbed her by the arm swiftly otherwise she would have collapsed on the floor.</p>
<p>“When I was about to leave the palace under the princess’s order, I enquired about why the stable had suddenly become so busy. They said it’s because the crown prince had summoned the Blood Army. I came back to the Concubines’ Palace but because Princess was not there, I couldn’t deliver the message. By the way, I think there was another spy beside me.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear so?” Viola asked.</p>
<p>“It seems they came undercover… Two of them have been caught as servants in disguise.” Paul explained.</p>
<p>“Which kingdom did they come from?”</p>
<p>The ever loyal knight shook his head in response as he did not know the answer.</p>
<p>Although it was a relief that Paul was safe, the possibility of something big befalling them couldn’t be ruled out. No matter which kingdom they belong to, they would never be safe. The laws of the Arpen Empire were ruthless. It was obvious they were going to be tortured and killed.</p>
<p>Viola realized that she needed to move more carefully. Lustian’s warning had engraved deeply into her bones.</p>
<p>“Don’t go outside the palace for a while. Wait until he’s not suspicious anymore.” She cautioned her subordinate.</p>
<p>“Yes, Princess.”</p>
<p>After Paul saluted and went out, her anxious heart had settled somewhat. Rosha came with a warm tea.</p>
<p>“Did you met Princess Guinev?” the little maid asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“That’s a relief. Shall I send a message separately?” Rosha queried.</p>
<p>“You are also at risk. Wait a while.”</p>
<p><em><strong>“How are you doing? You must be eager to get out after being stuck here…..Trapped for six months… You must be lonely, what are we going to do?” Viola said.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“I am not lonely at all. I am rather happy.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Before leaving the forest, Viola had asked Guinev for the last time. If she wanted to get out, she would come up with a way for her… But in the end, Guinev had refused her help. She said it was the safest place until her lover came to get her.</p>
<p><em>‘Does she not know? There is no one to protect her anymore….’</em></p>
<p>The knight who guarded Guinev had been beheaded, his severed head sent to the Kingdom of Farus. Also, there was a rumour in the Concubines’ Palace that she had fallen in love and eloped with the knight who was guarding her. After listening to her words, Viola thought the rumour was true.</p>
<p>Viola believed he had promised to go and save her… She didn’t know how to tell Guinev… Furthermore, Guinev didn’t know that she was God’s Companion.</p>
<p><em>‘How should I tell her? What will change if she becomes God’s Companion?’</em></p>
<p>Nobody knew what would change if Guinev became God’s companion. Viola had surmised that if God’s companion was found, there would not be another poor princess sharing the pathetic plight. Since the time she had entered the palace, no other candidate had.</p>
<p>Time flew. It seemed only like yesterday she had come in as a candidate, but four months had passed hence. In the next two months, she would bid Lustian goodbye forever.</p>
<p>Viola was waiting for the security to loosen. In the meantime, she did not push or even exchange words with the King of Koronis. Also, she wasn’t even aware of the happenings outside of the palace.</p>
