            <p><strong>Chapter 110</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>More than anything, since the world had become so unstable, she had to be hidden as much as possible. Viola felt regretful looking at her child right in front of her knowing that she couldn’t truly be her parent. She got rid of the tension in her body and leaned slightly into his chest. She couldn’t tell if he was aware of her feelings, but his hands that were grabbing her waist seemed to have gained strength.</p>
<p><em>Please wait a bit longer… Until we find God’s Companion.</em></p>
<p>The place they stopped at was where the two of them had had a picnic. This place hadn’t changed either. It was a wide forest with many flowers, butterflies and beautiful scenery. The attendants had already prepared for their teatime. There were three chairs in total. It was a happy place.</p>
<p>Viola’s lips curled into a smile. She glanced at Lustian sitting in front to see that he was also smiling. However, his expression changed as soon as he met her eyes. His sulky face seemed just like that of a child. In this moment and place, there was no emperor that made an entire continent tremble in fear. He was just an ordinary… A very ordinary husband.</p>
<p>Lustian stretched out his hand. Then, one of his legs was spread outwards. This gesture was telling her to come and sit. Though Viola was mindful of Wendy, she saw that Kyle took the child’s hand and took her down to the riverside. She couldn’t help but get up and sit on his thigh. His sturdy thighs were as hard as stone. At the same time, the area just below her behind that she brushed up against was… Gasp! It was his bound-up core!</p>
<p><em>Why… are you turned on at this moment? I didn’t even do anything…</em></p>
<p>However, this situation wasn’t of much importance to him. Their lips collided. His tongue immediately snaked into her mouth that parted without shame. He squeezed her breasts and a rough kiss ensued. Viola’s body heated up.</p>
<p><em>“</em>Mmmm… Hah….”</p>
<p>In the heat, her mind grew dim. Their tongues were entangled in a dizzy whirl. She couldn’t hold herself together as Lustian’s kiss sucked on her tongue until its root was burning. It was so potent she couldn’t breathe. As the wet noises echoed in the wide forest, her face turned red. Her breath was stifled as the desperate lust spread from the end of her tongue.</p>
<p>His erect lower area was being rubbed in between two thighs. It was shameful. His body was red hot as it burned up. Viola bit her lip, desperately trying to hold in her moans. However, each time Lustian would shower her with rough kisses, it was hard to breathe. His kiss was full of passion.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>It felt as though her heart would melt at this rate. Knowing that they were in such an expansive place, and Wendy could arrive at any second, she was nervous. However, her body was as sensitive as it could get. Just from a kiss, a lot of her sensitive spots were damp.</p>
<p>At Lustian’s touch, her body was already far from a normal state. Even at the slightest touch, her body was hot as if she was being burned. How much must they have sucked on each other’s lips? While they were licking each other’s lips in a frenzy, they felt someone looking at her.</p>
<p>In a shock, they both pulled their lips away from each other. It was because they could see Wendy in front, looking at them with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“Wen-Wendy.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The innocent and unknowingly happy little lady, even in front of the emperor, followed him into the bedroom. Lustian was perched in the bedroom as he looked at the unwanted guest with a dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>“She could’ve been sent to the crown prince’s palace….”</p>
<p>“She’s asleep now. It is only today, so please let this sweet child off.”</p>
<p>“She isn’t so sweet at all.”</p>
<p>Viola held Wendy in her arms as she patted her butt and sang her a lullaby. Lustian closed his eyes gently as he looked at Viola.</p>
<p>“Are you sisters? You look so alike,” he suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Is that so? How are we most alike?”</p>
<p>“Your blue eyes that shine like the lake resemble River Judith. I see those eyes in this child too.”</p>
<p>“Is that true?” Viola’s smile would not leave her lips. She held Wendy’s small hands and planted kisses on the back of her hands. Then, she gently ran her hands through the child’s hair. Her eyes were not just eager but full of love.</p>
<p>“To come from two halves…. Do you still value her just because she’s your sister?”</p>
<p>“It’s because she’s the youngest. To be so young and… have to leave her mother is just so pitiful.”</p>
<p>“But were you not also taken out of that abandoned castle at that age?”</p>
<p>He had been investigating her from the moment she entered the castle. Everyone knew why Viola was taken out of the abandoned castle. After losing her mother in a sudden fire, Edward and Viola were banished from a castle that was crumbling down. Unable to properly enjoy dressing up or having meals, they lived in a Royal Family that was torn in half.</p>
<p>“You investigated me.”</p>
<p>“Because you were the person I had to care for from the beginning.”</p>
<p>He had known all along how Viola had lived. He had also refrained from guessing the reason why she could never wholly accept him. She could never love someone who was on the side that let her family die… It left a bitter taste in his mouth.</p>
<p>“I expected this. I knew that as soon as you were suspicious of me you would dig up my past.”</p>
<p>“Would you believe me if I told you that I know more about you than you think?”</p>
<p>“Then….” Viola’s eyes trembled.</p>
<p>Lustian had to clench his fists before he brought it up.</p>
<p>“I am doing this as a means of mourning your older brother’s dishonorable death.”</p>
<p>“Oh….”</p>
<p>Shocked, Viola got up quickly. Wendy stirred, but the small child burrowed deeper into her arms looking for warmth. It was clear that Wendy was tearing up. Looking at the moistness in her eyes, it seemed that all the resentment that was in her heart for eight years old was being relieved.</p>
<p><em>Those countless nights… There were so many times I wanted to get my revenge on her and yet….</em></p>
<p>Flowers were blooming inside his frozen heart that melted like the spring snow. His love and hatred for her vanished into thin air and now he was asking for forgiveness in a different way.</p>
