            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 54 – Complications (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>“You got wet so quick.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>He put his hand under the dress and fumbled about with her cave making it drip with body fluid. Lune licked his lips as he watched the ar0us3d Viola spit out curses in her mind at the n@k3d desire in his eyes.</p>
<p>She struggled to keep her reason as her head went hazy. Her body was tingling, it felt like tens of thousands of insects were crawling all over her then all of them went right to her core. It was driving her crazy.</p>
<p>She jolted up as his head slowly crept inside her dress. <em>No, this was too stimulating!</em></p>
<p>The harder she tried to close her legs the harder he pried them open with his hands then gr0p3d and licked her pr!v@tes. All she could do was struggle helplessly. It felt her heart was swelling up just like her n!ppl3s. She felt a jolt of pl3@sure as his hands brushed against them.</p>
<p>“Ah… ah….”</p>
<p>She was breathless, but despite her struggling to breathe he only looked on l3wdly let alone help. Her whole body was covered in sweat looking as if it were raining as she tried to keep her legs that were shaking 0bsc3nely still.</p>
<p>However, succumbed to the thrill, her body was quivering instinctively. She shook in the direction he wriggled his tongue. Her body was acting so wantonly that she could even feel her lips pucker up down there.</p>
<p><em>This, This is obscene…</em></p>
<p>The thought that she was twisting around so lasciviously inside a carriage made her breathless. The tight corset around her chest felt suffocating. It felt like someone was strangling her.</p>
<p>Viola’s breathing became rougher and she felt dizzy from the sensation of her whole body tingling. Her bottom was all sticky with her body fluids and his s@l!va. Just when she thought that she had emptied it all, she felt her body spasm a second time. She wanted to cry.</p>
<p>His head finally came up. Lune’s eyes were bursting with d3s!re. The pain in her stomach was constantly rising up.</p>
<p>“You have to open up more for me to fit it in.”</p>
<p>“…Ah…”</p>
<p>She used all her strength to close her legs. He clicked his tongue but his eyes were full of joy.</p>
<p>“I have something to ask you,” she said amidst her pants.</p>
<p>“Ask,” he said as he pecked her on the lips.</p>
<p>“Are the Blood Army and the imperial knights related?”</p>
<p>For a moment, Lune paused then stared right at viola and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Why do you ask?” he said.</p>
<p>“Because I was wondering if my husband had any relations with the notorious Blood Army.”</p>
<p>She wanted to tell him that Blood Army was the one that killed Edward but as soon as she did she would be suspected as a spy. She had to hold her tongue, for she could trust no one here in this enemy territory … not even her so-called husband.</p>
<p>Lune wouldn’t just stay still and watch. He wouldn’t just let a princess, who held a grudge against the imperial family and was sharpening her sword of revenge, go. They were still enemies even if he made her body tremble with pleasure like this. A contract marriage could be annulled at any moment so she had to be careful.</p>
<p>“— Well, it’s difficult to answer that,” he said in the end.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean that my wife doesn’t have to know. It may be notorious in other countries, but in the Arpen Empire it is the best army. No one will condemn me even if I am involved with them.”</p>
<p>“Wait… Ack….”</p>
<p>Something thick had come into her v@g!n@. A strange pleasure flamed inside her. The dizzying thrill and joyful pleasure were more than enough to crush her doubts. The look in his eyes added to the ar0us@l. The deep passion on Lune’s beautiful face fueled Viola’s l!b!d0 even more.</p>
<p>“When the time comes, you’ll find out naturally. We won’t even have enough time to enjoy our new marriage.”</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>He swiftly moved his body. He thrust so hard it made her clench her bottom, a m0@n soon escaped her lips. Before she realized she had given him a s3duct!ve look making his black eyes tremble.</p>
<p>“Tell me you want me… Hurry….” he whispered, in a charismatic voice.</p>
<p>Her body clamored as his breath fell on her ear.</p>
<p>“Heuk…”</p>
<p>“Viola… say that you want me.”</p>
<p>He looked at her impatiently then slowly hovered his nose around her ears. He wanted an answer but she shook her head vigorously, unlike her receptive body her mind stayed firm.</p>
<p>“It isn’t fun if it’s easy. Good. That’s what I love about you.”</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>“Keuk… but this side says different”</p>
<p>“Ah! Ahh!”</p>
<p><em>Slurp-slurp-</em></p>
<p>The spot where they were connected made a wet noise. The feeling of ple@sure soared up from her stomach to her head. Viola’s eyes gradually lost focus. Her body shook along with her rough breathing. Lune’s l*stf*l eyes glistened.</p>
<p>“Viola….”</p>
<p>“Ahh…Lune….”</p>
<p>Lune stroked Viola’s face affectionately. His hands caused flames to rise rapidly inside her body and her eyes turned white. She felt itchier and her body yearned for something more intense.</p>
<p>He rubbed her lips with his finger. Her tearful eyes turned l*stf*l as his thick fingers stirred inside her mouth. Everywhere his finger touched turned hot.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh…”</p>
<p>“Dammit, you’re so s3duct!ve but….”</p>
<p>Lune grabbed Viola’s chin and kissed her hard. Viola’s eyes opened wide. Her lips opened up as if it had been waiting for his lips. His tongue squeezed in and went wild inside her mouth.</p>
<p>The d3s!re that she had barely suppressed burst out all at once. Her body shook and wrapped around him as if welcoming him as they shared wet kisses. She could feel his tongue sucking on her tongue so hard it felt like it was trying to swallow it by pulling it from its root. His kiss felt urgent making it obvious that he had been waiting for long.</p>
<p>“Mhmmm!”</p>
<p>“Heup-!”</p>
<p>His tongue moved incessantly leaving her no time to breathe. His tongue danced inside her mouth. Her tongue was exhausted, but his tongue unforgivingly grabbed hers and sucked it deeply, coiling around hers craftily and s3duc!ng it like a snake.</p>
<p>He licked her teeth, the roof of her mouth, and pulled on her tongue. Viola was so lost in the s3nsu@l kiss that her body was flailing. The more she tried to turn away the harder he kissed. Her tightly grabbed waist twisted and trembled.</p>
<p>“Ack…”</p>
