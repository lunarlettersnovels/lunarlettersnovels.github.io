            <p><strong>Chapter 46 – Brutal Parents</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Namita Suberi, Larkspur</em></p>
<p>“Do you think God’s companion will reveal themselves?” asked Kyle.</p>
<p>“Maybe…,” pondered Lustian.</p>
<p>“Oh, I found news about Princess Guinev.”</p>
<p>“Really?” asked Lustian, “Do you know where she is?”</p>
<p>Kyle wore an unpleasant expression on his face. “She seems to have gone through the wall,” he said, “I can’t help but think that the Emperor has something to do with it.”</p>
<p>Lustian had wondered how Viola went past the wall. He had thought, at first, that she might have gone through the waterway. However, it would be tough even for the strongest swimmers to go against the current. It meant that she passed through the wall, like Princess Guinev did eight months ago….</p>
<p>It was said that the breath of God resides in the wall. So far there hadn’t been a record of anyone passing through the wall, but now there were two.</p>
<p>“Does the wall stay open if it has been opened once before?” asked Kyle.</p>
<p>“I am unsure,” said Lustian, “But I am certain that potential candidates for God’s companion have narrowed considerably. In fact, we might already have found her.” If she had already crossed the wall which held the God’s breath, then the most likely candidate was Princess Guinev. But Viola…</p>
<p>The woman of the most noble Lineage became the Companion of God. Princess Guinev had a very noble lineage. But Viola’s mother was a slave, so she wasn’t qualified. If Princess Guinev fit the picture, then there was no reason for them to keep accepting candidates. So why then were they still accepting more candidates?</p>
<p><em>What the hell does the Emperor want? </em>Pondered Lustian.</p>
<p>“But, is there a reason for him to hide her though?” asked Lustian, “Did His Majesty take her on a trip somewhere?”</p>
<p>“I think it is strange too,” replied Kyle, “I have looked everywhere. She has disappeared without a trace.”</p>
<p>“Find out the Emperor’s whereabouts,” said Lustian, “And report to me.” Lustian stood up and looked at the time, frowning. He always had dinner with his mother whenever he was in the castle. He needed to head out soon.</p>
<p>There was a black horse waiting for him in the stable. Lustian got onto the horse and took the reins. The horse galloped away, blowing back his black hair. His mind was a mess. If they didn’t find God’s Companion… He couldn’t bear to think what it would mean for Viola. <em>She surely isn’t going to be God’s Companion, </em>he thought, and tried to reassure himself.</p>
<p>Lustian spurred his horse on. He soon came upon the Empress’s Palace. His heart was heavy as he approached the entrance and his nerves were on ends. When he reached, a nurse ran to him. He heard a dull sound and an accompanying scream. Lustian’s face stiffened.</p>
<p>“I was coming to look for you, Your Majesty,” the woman said frantically, “Please help us, or an innocent might die.”</p>
<p>He followed her inside the palace. As he walked through the hallway, the sound grew louder. It was the sound of a whip on skin. There was blood in the white corridor. The blood became trails, like somebody had been dragged through the path. He followed them and came upon a hall where the maid had fainted. She was stripped naked and beaten bloody. The whip had seared every inch of her skin. Facing the maid, holding the whip, stood Lustian’s mother.</p>
<p>The Empress of the Arpen Empire was a cruel woman, as brutal as the Blood Emperor. The Empress hadn’t always been this ruthless. Lustian, when he was a child, remembered her as an extremely kind and gentle woman.</p>
<p>“Mother,” he said as he approached her.</p>
<p>“Oh, Lustian. You’re here!” said the Empress, “I am going to kill this bitch. She was caught sneaking into the Emperor’s room. I am going to show her where she belongs.”</p>
<p>“Father is not in his Palace,” Lustian said, “He left quite a while ago. It is impossible for the maid to be involved with him.”</p>
<p>“He is not here?” the Empress spat vehemently, “Where is he then? Having an affair with some other bitch again?”</p>
<p>She was not well. She often whipped and lashed her servants for atrocities that they had never committed. Her maids and servants stood around her, shivering with fear. Their eyes seemed to plead with him to calm the cruel Empress lest she killed them one by one. His heart ached for them, and for his mother. His hatred and anger towards the Emperor and God grew by the second.</p>
<p>“Give me the whip, mother,” said Lustian, reaching out his hand, “I will do it.”</p>
<p>She might be a cruel and mad Empress to many, but he was still her precious darling son. She obliged when he smiled and gently retrieved the whip from her hand. He wiped the blood from her hands with his cloak. She leaned on him, suddenly exhausted.</p>
<p>“Lustian, my darling boy,” said the Empress, “Will you stay by my side till I fall asleep?”</p>
<p>“Of course, mother,” he said, holding her.</p>
<p>“I need to take my medicine,” she said weakly.</p>
<p>“Yes, mother.”</p>
<p>Lustian indicated to the nurse to get the medicine. He took her to her room and laid her down on her bed, gently. The nurse gave her the medicine. She quickly fell asleep.</p>
<p>Lustian stayed by her side as she slept. She called his name quietly in her sleep. His anger flared at the sight of his miserable mother and the helpless servants, but he reigned in his rage with great effort. He turned away towards the direction of the Royal Villa, thinking of Viola to calm himself.</p>
