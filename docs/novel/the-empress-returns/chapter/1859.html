<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Before the sun rose, Kyle arrived at the temple in a hurry. Upon receiving his report, the emperor summoned the Blood Army right away. With a worried look on Viola’s face, she examined him.</p>
<p>“Is it the Orcs again?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It’ll be over after a day, so don’t worry.” He reassured her.</p>
<p>When Lustian started to wear his armor, she became anxious. It was undeniable that even when he displayed the unwavering disposition of a Grand Master, she was still worried.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame because I also wanted to go.”</p>
<p>Since she wasn’t naked, it was difficult to participate in the battle herself. Even if she wanted to be his right hand, she needed to think about the baby in her stomach.</p>
<p>He hugged Viola by the waist and made eye contact. His bright, confident face made her sigh out of relief, but she wished that he didn’t rely on just his own strength. It wasn’t difficult to face the Orcs but the difference between the power of a human and the power of God was too great…</p>
<p>“Trust me. God cannot kill me. He also depends on the negotiation.”</p>
<p>“Even so… always be cautious. You must return before nightfall.”</p>
<p>“I will return unscathed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you must win.”</p>
<p>Viola escorted him with a bright smile. She waved at him as he stepped onto the portal. As soon as he disappeared from before her, she looked for Paul. She needed to see him after hearing that he returned to the palace by dawn. But first Rosha came to greet her.</p>
<p>“Empress, I am back.”</p>
<p>“Rosha, you must be exhausted. You should’ve rested,” Viola said.</p>
<p>“I slept on the carriage.”</p>
<p>“Did Paul stay up the whole night?”</p>
<p>“No… He also slept… on the carriage.”</p>
<p>Rosha’s face turned red. It seemed that they both were on the same carriage. It seemed that this was the opportunity for them to deepen their relationship, but a saint like Paul didn’t seem to be one to make a move.</p>
<p>“I still confessed to him.”</p>
<p>“I-is that true?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He didn’t give me an answer, but I told him I would wait.”</p>
<p>“…Rosha.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay. It wasn’t a rejection.”</p>
<p>Rosha was smiling in front of Viola, but there was sadness behind the smile.</p>
<p>“More than anything, today I was surprised. Is it true that Princess Wendy slept beside the previous empress? My heart is still thumping from the shock. I had to pinch the back of my hand several times in case it was all a dream.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that was what happened. Thankfully, she loves Wendy.”</p>
<p>The previous night, she heard that after talking for a long time, Wendy fell asleep in her arms. In the morning, they had a nice meal and the previous empress took the little herself to the crown prince’s palace and got her to change into a dress.</p>
<p>“She’s an adorable princess. It’s impossible to not love her. It’s a blessing that Wendy melted her hardened heart.”</p>
<p>“I also think so.”</p>
<p>“Ah, here comes Sir Paul.”</p>
<p>They saw Paul from afar. After changing his clothes, he came and kissed Viola on the back of her hand.</p>
<p>“I have returned.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming back safely. I have something to say to the both of you.”</p>
<p>Viola talked about the map that she saw in her dreams. The duo’s eyes went wide and they gasped in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Is that so? If that dream comes true, can we not use that to prepare for this war?”</p>
<p>“I think so. In the past, I… I mean, if the virgin prepared the future for us, I think that we ought to follow suit.”</p>
<p>“That is so surprising. To think that she foretold this 200 years ago….”</p>
<p>“I don’t think she’s an ordinary human.”</p>
<p>“…If she can see God herself, she is either a bridesmaid or a person with a special kind of eyes.”</p>
<p>“In any case, before His Majesty returns, I will go back to God’s territory to find the object in the palace.”</p>
<p>“I- It’s dangerous to go alone.”</p>
<p>Rosha’s face was pale. She looked at Paul. After listening carefully, he resolutely revealed his intentions.</p>
<p>“I shall escort her.”</p>
<p>“No. I must go alone. Only the chosen can enter that place. No other human can enter.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“What shall we do? Wouldn’t it be wise to go with Her Majesty yourself?” Rosha spoke in a weary voice.</p>
<p>“I have a kind of power that can protect me.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>Viola touched her lower belly with a soft smile on her face. The one that protected her from God’s eyes was the baby in her stomach. She was not doubtful of the idea that her baby had the same powers that Wendy did.</p>
<p>“Ah… You don’t mean that your baby is—”</p>
<p>“Now is the chance. We must use the fact that Lune’s Blood Army is fighting off the army sent by God to our advantage. In case I am late, report back to Lune.”</p>
<p>“My empress….”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. Please trust me, both of you. I am not one to be hesitant. I am strong in my faith, so follow my lead.”</p>
<p>It was obvious that Paul was clenching his fists hard. He got up and moved aside as if to escort Viola.</p>
<p>“I shall be your guard. I will protect the outskirts of the territory.”</p></div>
