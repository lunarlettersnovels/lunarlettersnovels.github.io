            <p><strong>Chapter 140</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>With the benign look of a king, she stared at Paul. “I am no longer a child. I will begin training right away tomorrow. Of course, I gain greater satisfaction from wielding a sword than wearing a dress. You will help me, no?”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“Paul.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I shall. If these are the wishes of my king….”</p>
<p>Paul kissed her on the back of her hand as a display of awe. Finally, Viola was relieved. She intended to not make it so apparent that she knew that she was God’s Companion lest she makes Lustian worry…</p>
<p><em>Let us work together. I will be of great help to you.</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The next day, she started her official training. The knights were shocked seeing the empress take off her dress to change into her uniform and step into the military exercise hall. All she told Lustian was that she was using this as an outlet for her frustrations. Lustian, knowing her personality, was not suspicious.</p>
<p>She was to receive training from Paul, but it was unexpected that Lustian would also join them in the training. As he took off his uniform and stepped into the training center, he looked stunning to her. The wind blew through his hair as his thin shirt flew around, revealing his pecs.</p>
<p>“Paul is quite skillful, but I am also aware of the sword fighting methods of the empress.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness.” Viola hesitated.</p>
<p>“Let us battle for old time’s sake,” Lustian said with a bright smile.</p>
<p>As they started to battle with the wooden swords, the knights watched them.</p>
<p>“I did not neglect my sword practice for the past eight years.”</p>
<p>“It seems like it.”</p>
<p>“That’s good.”</p>
<p>Viola got into her ready position and swished her wooden sword around.</p>
<p>Even if she had hidden in the forest for those eight years, she didn’t just hide. She became a female swordmaster in case someone was after her. Not only did she learn sword fighting, but also archery and how to sense someone’s presence. Viola’s mentor was Paul. With a skillful mentor comes a skillful student, and likewise, she became skillful enough to catch up with her master.</p>
<p>“Oho, you are doing well. You have a good stance. You improved a lot.”</p>
<p>“I will not spare you.”</p>
<p>Lustian looked at her as if she were a fledgling. It was obvious that he was belittling her. This stoked her. Even though they did make love to each other, it was only natural that a swordmaster’s instinct was to view the other as their competitor, no matter who they were.</p>
<p>Viola brandished her sword. Just then, though he backed off, he was able to block her with ease.</p>
<p>“The sight of you like this is an adorable one… Pfft.”</p>
<p>Viola ground her teeth. As he laughed, she became more determined. Viola swished her sword again. From a third-person perspective, it was a brilliant scene, but it was different for the people actually battling. Unable to control her strength, her whole body spun around as she tried to swish the sword. Lustian took this opportunity to hold her from behind. His breath tickled her ear.</p>
<p>“You’re so adorable that it makes me want to go to bed with you.”</p>
<p>“Huh, to say that—”</p>
<p>Her face turned beet red. To think that he could be so shameless. Although, it was his tenacious side that she fell for in the beginning.</p>
<p>Viola used her elbow to hit him in the abdomen and escaped. Then, she got back into her position. The second battle commenced. A joyous applause erupted from the audience.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Perhaps it was inevitable. She was no match for him anyhow. He won the second round as well, and suddenly their lips were touching.</p>
<p>“Wait… Y-Your Highness….”</p>
<p>“Kiss me. Since I won, do I not deserve an award?”</p>
<p>“Ah… If we do this—”</p>
<p>He kissed her frantically. She found it embarrassing that they were kissing so openly in the hall. Expecting that she would be embarrassed, the loyal subjects ordered all of the knights to leave. As soon as they were out of sight, Viola put her hand on Lustian’s nape. His glorious tongue moved frantically through the inside of her mouth.</p>
<p>“Mmmm—”</p>
<p>From his lips came a very warm breath. Since they trained under the hot afternoon sun, the two were covered in sweat. His body temperature was higher than usual. More than anything, something hot was pressing on her stomach. She looked down at his manhood which was showing through his clothes.</p>
<p>“I want to do it. Of course, I suppose that my empress also wants the same.”</p>
<p>His rod was so erect that it looked like it would burst, despite only not having s*x for a day. That was not important, however. This was a hall, which meant that anyone could hide there and watch them in secret. Wary of the location they were in, Lustian grabbed her hand and took her somewhere. Limping, he walked over to a small storage room below the platform.</p>
<p>When they opened the door and walked, there were armor, swords, and flags stacked onto each other.</p>
<p>“No one will see us here.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh, Lune…!”</p>
<p>Lustian grabbed onto her thin clothes and took them off revealing her shoulders and chest. He started by sucking on her dainty, long neck. Viola’s body twitched. His busy hands started touching her sensitive spots, and at the same time, her pants and underwear came down at once.</p>
<p>As soon as his large hands grabbed onto her brēasts, her mind went blank. His lips slid down and nibbled on the n*pples right away. As soon as he bit on the round, erect buds, she m*aned.</p>
<p>“Uhhh…. Ahhh…..”</p>
<p>“I might be hasty. You were much too beautiful with the way you were sword fighting. There were other bastards who had eyes for you, but it is definitely fascinating that even that is such an attractive trait.”</p>
