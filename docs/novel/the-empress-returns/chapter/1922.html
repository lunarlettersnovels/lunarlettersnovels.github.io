            <p><strong>Chapter 42 – Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>The Viola without makeup was stunningly beautiful, enough to make artists the world over herald her beauty. It could be said, out of all the crown princess candidates thus far, she was the most beautiful. She could have gained a lot of things just based on appearance alone, so Lustian failed to understand why she came here as a hostage to be a spy.</p>
<p><em>What is she doing this for? Why does she need that book? And … what is she going to do after reading it?</em></p>
<p>Questions a many, answer but one.</p>
<p>Once their contractual marriage had drawn to a close, she would outright divorce him. Head held high, she would return to her motherland and join the race to the throne. And why not? There were no laws governing their land that objected to the reign of a queen especially when they were a country without a prince …</p>
<p><em>Did she want to be queen? And point a sword at his empire that slayed her brother?</em></p>
<p><em>… But </em><em><strong>that</strong></em><em> is </em><em><strong>not</strong></em><em> going to happen … because, Viola, I have </em><em><strong>no</strong></em><em> intention of ever letting you go!</em></p>
<p>As for her role of a spy … Well, no matter how much information she relayed to her kingdom or the missions they assigned her, it would all end in vain. This had nothing to do with her capabilities but everything to do with the place itself.</p>
<p>To an onlooker, this was just an empire with its fair share of strengths and weaknesses. Breaching through its Achilles heel would bring it down to its knee. Although there was no flaw in the logic, what the onlooker didn’t know was this was no ordinary empire. Arpen was a realm of inexplicable occurrences. What the others couldn’t even begin to fathom, was all a matter in a day here. What weakness? What ‘bring about its ruin? No one could attack let alone conquer this land that was decreed to bask in glory by God Himself.</p>
<p>Few knew of the pact between the Arpen Imperial Clan and God. And among those that knew, they would mostly brush it away as hearsay. It wasn’t that they were lacking in faith, but the covenant was such. Until the time they found God’s companion, no man or beast, kingdom or calamity could lay a finger on this empire. And since two centuries, God had kept His word gracing them with victory battle after battle.</p>
<p><em>The rule of war is perish or prevail. Regardless of one’s status, every person in arms is precious to somebody. If you think it’s unfair because he is your family, the royal family, that is what the arrogance of royals really is.</em></p>
<p>A pensive Lustian disapprovingly patted Viola on the cheek, her body wriggled in response. She could feel the presence beside her, and clearly the touch. However, in spite of it all, she didn’t open her eyes. Her bosom rhythmically moved up and down, her breathing calm as she was peacefully asleep. He could see her hot pulse on her white and delicate neck seemingly inviting him. He dipped his head and moved his lips down to her fine neck.</p>
<p>As soon as his lips touched the silky, slender skin, his body trembled with uncontrollable excitement. His lower body felt heavy, a surge of carnal desire swelled inside his lower belly bringing along an unbearable thirst. His throat was burning and all the saliva dried up inside his mouth, so he kissed her who he knew could cool his body down. He licked her lips gently with the tip of his tongue.</p>
<p>And with that, her eyes opened. She instantly pushed him away and then wiped her lips with her hand, looking at him puzzled.</p>
<p>“What are you doing all of the sudden?” She demanded.</p>
<p>“I’m just doing what couples do. Is there something wrong?” he replied cheekily.</p>
<p>“Wel-well it’s … Uhhh … I’m asking why are you doing this in the middle of the day?”</p>
<p>“Because I couldn’t do it last night.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>Her blue eyes widened in astonishment. This man with a voracious appetite had only restrained himself for a day. Allowed her a day to recover since it was her first time. In his defense, he had even held back quite a lot on their first night. Be it in strength, intensity, or vigour, he had taken her and only her into account. Although it may have been too much for her to handle, in the end, it hadn’t even satiated half his coital desire. The beast in him was roaring for more.</p>
<p>“Still, I need to get ready. I’ll call the maid now.”</p>
<p>His beautiful forehead scrunched up. It was clear that even though they were now married she was trying to avoid having sex with him. But would the beast in him give in? Lustian lightly grabbed Viola’s wrist and levelled his gaze at her, displaying in full view his dissatisfaction. He then pulled her hand towards his excited member.</p>
