<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 66 – Irrevocable (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Viola stood up and slammed her hands down on the table. The table shook violently, the tea splashed on his clothes, but he did not waver and only looked squarely at the incensed girl before him.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of becoming Crown Princess of this empire. So I’ll follow tradition and go to the Concubines’ Palace.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying you want to go there despite knowing what kind of place that is?”</p>
<p>The more he frowned, the more a slight smile began to creep across her face. As much as she hated to become the laughingstock of the royal family, she hated, even more, the thought of officially becoming Crown Princess.</p>
<p>She remembered Princess Anne’s words- <em><strong>The princesses here are secretly meeting with the princes of their own volition. If your willpower is strong, then it can be avoided.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>And not only that, but I have another shield I can use… You.</em></p>
<p>At the thought of being shielded by the crown prince’s special affection for her, she knew that it was the perfect place for her to go. There were five months left, he could put the contract period as two years, but Viola was going to leave the villa after five months.</p>
<p>“The decision is mine to make. I was the one to suggest it, and now that the terms have changed, I should be the one to approve of changes to the contract. The time left is five months after which we can divorce – no, since we never married we won’t even call it a divorce. I will be leaving the villa at that time.”</p>
<p>For her, to wait two years was equivalent to two years of shame. Her biggest goal was to get away from him as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As Viola confidently said all this, Lustian simply looked at her for a long time. With a stoic mien, he stared wordlessly into her eyes as if he meant to burn a hole in her face. She swallowed nervously.</p>
<p><em>What will you do? Now, it’s your turn to make a decision.</em></p>
<p>Viola stared back at him coldly. Suddenly, Lustian stood up from his seat and grabbed her chin, she could feel the heat from his fingertips. He brought his lips close to hers and spoke-</p>
<p>“Five months… Okay, that’s fine. If you want it so bad, I’ll change it for you. But in return, you won’t be able to push away my intense d*s*re for you.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>She swallowed again.</p>
<p>“Every single day, I’ll bite and suck on you. Your lips, your bre*sts, even the flesh of your s*x….”</p>
<p>With his finger, he traced a line down from her lips, between her m*unds, and all the way down to her sensitive area. Her hand began to tremble again. She clenched it into a fist. In her mind, she saw a series of flashbacks to the three weeks that they had lived in contractual marriage.</p>
<p>“Fine — mmph!”</p>
<p>At that moment, their lips connected, his warm tongue pushed into her mouth. As his tongue sought every corner of her mouth, her body froze. Their tongues entangled together, in shock, she opened her eyes wide and looked at the man who was kissing her senselessly. His dark eyebrows crashed together, contorted with d*s*re. The hand that was grabbing her body was nearly crushing her in desperation and did not let go even for a moment.</p>
<p>They both heard the sound of teacups falling to the floor and shattering, but that was not important. She breathed heavily. As she watched him devour her like a beast, she knew too well the pleasure that would come.</p>
<p>“Aah—”</p>
<p>“Haah—”</p>
<p>The heat of their breath mingled in the air, her body started to dampen from the overwhelming kisses that barely let her breathe. His tongue roved inside her mouth as he sucked and licked at her.</p>
<p><em>Mm, mmph –</em></p>
<p>… his animalistic kisses showed his uncontrollable d*s*re for her as his tongue wrapped around hers. His kisses were so strong that she started to lose strength in her legs, its impact such that she was unable to fully swallow his s*l*va as he pushed his tongue into her mouth letting it trickle down the corners of her lips. At the same time, an unstoppable wave of heat was coming over her body.</p>
<p>“Wait—”</p>
<p>“Open your mouth. Wider.”</p>
<p>Their lips locked once more. Unsatisfied with one kiss, his tongue came between her lips once more. He pressed against her with such force that he was like an animal, Viola was thrown off her guard.</p>
<p>“Mmmn—”</p>
<p>“More… haah… Viola—”</p>
<p>He whispered with longing in his voice; its sound interspersed with their kisses was dripping with s*x*al des*re.</p>
<p>His tongue explored every sensitive area inside of her mouth over and over again without pause. He grabbed her waist with one hand as he kissed her with such force that her whole body shook. Each time her body shook, Lustian’s strong arm wrapped even more strongly around her and he pressed his tongue deeper into her mouth.</p>
<p>“Mmph-”</p>
<p>Her heart raced, at the same time, she was burning. As his tongue moved in her mouth, a wave of heat came over her from down below. She could feel the soaking wetness in her p*nties as the nectar dripped forth freely. She couldn’t shake off her own l*stful d*s*re. She had not even imagined that her underwear could get so wet just from one kiss.</p>
<p><em>Wha-what am I doing?! This man is the crown prince that leads the Blood Army of this empire! Edward’s sworn enemy!</em></p>
<p>But her body was saying something else entirely. Her lips felt like they were on fire. She saw stars before her eyes, and her body was aflame. As their kiss became deeper and more prolonged, Lustian’s hardened sh*ft pressed against her lower body. Feeling his stiffness, she was momentarily startled.</p>
<p>“Can you feel my eagerness? Look, I’m hard as a rock.”</p>
<p>Viola was gasping for air, having trouble even breathing. His hands started to quickly undr*ss her. He buried his face between her bare m*unds and started to lick and suckle at them.</p>
<p>“Aah—”</p>
<p>He sucked at her bud with such force that she felt it might fall off. Grabbing the peaks in both hands, he alternated between them, sucking and kissing at her sensitive flesh without a pause. She could barely move, her brain cells seemed to be shocked by each consecutive movement of his mouth. More fluid dribbled down into her already drenched und*rw*ar.</p>
<p>Well aware of this, Lustian quickly pulled up the bottom of her dress and turned his attention to her core. She jumped as her und*rw*ar came down around her ankles, and he moved towards her filled with l*st. His tongue explored between her thighs moving all the way to the petals. Viola’s body flinched in surprise. Her dress appeared bulky with him between her legs.</p>
<p>Who would know that Lustian would be in there?</p>
