            <p><strong>Chapter 149</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“The promise princesses have made, I’m using that promise. Those who want to help me, please follow me.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The knight who was in charge of the labour camp hurriedly visited the emperor’s office. Lustian freaked out as he heard Viola went to the northern labour camp and met the princes. That was a dangerous place. There were many people who saw the Arpen Imperial family as an enemy. Some of the workers in here included the knights and servants that came as hostages and could harm Viola.</p>
<p>“So, the empress?!”</p>
<p>“They had a conversation for about ten minutes. Then she immediately went back to the palace.”</p>
<p>“What did they talk about?”</p>
<p>“The promises made by princesses, that she will be using that promise.”</p>
<p>“Promises?”</p>
<p>Lustian closed the document. He was about to depart to the palace when the door opened and in came Viola.</p>
<p>“Viola?”</p>
<p>Lustian tilted his head as he saw her in the empress attire. She usually didn’t like the red dress which was the symbol of the empress. She wore it on a special day, but today was a normal day. It was weird to see her wearing it when there wasn’t an official occasion.</p>
<p>“I have something to say.”</p>
<p>“— Now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s very important. I would like to speak to you alone.”</p>
<p>“Everyone’s dismissed.”</p>
<p>Now that it was just the two of them in the room, Lustian went to Viola, tugged her wrist, and hugged her. As he their bodies touched, his mind was at peace.</p>
<p>“Lune…. Can you hear me through without being angry?” Viola’s voice was heavy unlike usual.</p>
<p>That moment, Lustian’s mouth dried. His throat hurt like it was choking. He felt uneasy. “You’re scaring me.”</p>
<p>He tried to keep his tone to normal but his voice trembled. He was afraid of what was about to come from her. He wasn’t ready for anything she was about to say. His heart shut close for he didn’t want to hear anything. He hugged her like he didn’t want to let her go.</p>
<p>“I know… that I’m God’s Companion….”</p>
<p>“…!!!”</p>
<p><em><strong>Thump!</strong></em></p>
<p>His heart dropped. His body trembled and hardened as he heard the words he didn’t want to hear from her mouth. The hands that were holding onto her shoulders clenched.</p>
<p><em>Even if I couldn’t deceive her until the end… Letting her know… like this…</em></p>
<p>His head sank onto her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Just like you want to protect me, I also want to protect you. I don’t want to say goodbye to our family.”</p>
<p>“…Vi-Viola….” His lips trembled.<em> Does she know that… I can never let her go no matter the cost?</em></p>
<p>“So give me some time.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying?” He lifted his head, peeled himself from her and looked into her eyes.</p>
<p>“So that I can help you. No, so that I can protect myself, give me some time. I don’t need that much. One month, no before the full moon, I’ll come back to the palace.”</p>
<p>“Viola! Are you leaving the palace?”</p>
<p>“For a very short period of time. The time to unknot is very precious to us.”</p>
<p>Lustian flinched and leaned back. He couldn’t be away even for a day. He couldn’t breathe if he was separated from her. But unlike him, she came with a strong resolution.</p>
<p>“I’ve received the princes’ secret message. To make sure that they don’t believe that the secret message is fake, I have to go to their kingdoms and meet the kings myself.</p>
<p>“…. No… Viola! You…!” His eyes widened.</p>
<p>“I know we need soldiers to fight against God. Those soldiers, I’ll fill them in. I will fill those soldiers in and be beside you at the front of the army when you are fighting.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her solemn stance displayed her determination.</p>
<p>Lustian was shocked beyond limit. She was basically saying that she is going to the enemy kingdom as Empress of Arpen Empire. Their royals were in his palace as hostages, so Viola could become the same.</p>
<p>“No! Never! You can’t! Viola, you are my biggest weakness. To go there knowing that is basically saying you’re going there to become a hostage!”</p>
<p>“They can’t treat me like that. Your Majesty… The princes are here? You also have something to decide for them sending an army for this war… Let’s compromise.”</p>
<p>“What are you—”</p>
<p>“Peace in Slovenia, to have a peace treaty so that the humans won’t be at war with each other anymore—”</p>
<p>“Peace treaty….”</p>
<p>The word peace felt very unfamiliar to Lustian. Viola softly caressed his cheek. His beautiful eyes still contained uneasiness, but they had to draw the big picture believing in each other. Wendy’s safety and Arpen’s stability, and furthermore to have peace in the continent was a beautiful result.</p>
<p>Viola knew he felt uneasy, but she picked a way for everyone to live peacefully.</p>
<p>“The Arpen Empire I dream of is not the one that bullies the small countries as a strong country but one that lives peacefully and happily with everyone in the continent. To make it so that no one loses their loved ones in wars—”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of being God’s Companion. I’m going to be by your and Wendy’s side… and for our children that will be born after the war… I’m going to be courageous. I will unite the continent.”</p>
<p>“Viola!”</p>
<p>He hugged her again. His heart was thumping. She hugged his shoulders that were trembling slightly. He was the strongest man in the world, but he became ever so small in front of love, like all humans.</p>
<p>She kissed his lips. As she did, his deep kiss came on her. Their lips opened and the tongues entwined without hesitation. There wasn’t much that gave him comfort. She just had to let him know her will to not leave his side.</p>
<p>She was overwhelmed with emotions. She felt very weird that she was the one who would go down in human history. As the kisses intensified, she felt proud.</p>
