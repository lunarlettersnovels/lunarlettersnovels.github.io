            <p><strong>Chapter 39 – Pretenses (2)</strong></p>
<p>A day passed. Lune entered not through a secret passage but through the main gate. Viola didn’t wear any makeup, just her robe. It was the same one she had worn when she’d disguised herself as Lune’s lover. The head maid must have been notified as she was nowhere to be seen at the moment.</p>
<p>She greeted him with a smile when she saw Lune waiting for her on a horse by the main gate. This smile wasn’t because she was excited to meet him, but because she was excited to finally get going on with the king’s mission.</p>
<p>He stretched out his hand and she jumped up onto the horse. The black horse blew its nose and galloped.</p>
<p>“Where do you want to go?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Anywhere. I want to see everything in the palace.”</p>
<p>“Well then, why don’t we go to the Drill Hall. You would like to see that, won’t you? Being well-versed in the art of the sword.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I would love to.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Hold on tight because it’s a little farther.”</p>
<p><em>How far could it be?</em></p>
<p>Come to think of it, she had never left the palace grounds, so she didn’t know how big it was. She knew where the crown prince’s palace, the imperial villa, and the Concubines’ Palace were but not where the emperor and empress lived.</p>
<p>Viola opened her eyes wide and looked around. She made a mental map of the imperial grounds. It would be useful when planting a spy later. The horse galloped for a long time. It finally came to a stop, right when she could feel her bottom going sore.</p>
<p>“That’s the Drill Hall over there. It is usually filled with burly knights during the day,” he said, pointing to the place.</p>
<p>There were different flags hung all over the hall. Viola searched for a red flag among the many flags, but she couldn’t find the flag of the Blood Army. There were only gold and white, and other patterned flags. <em>Does the Blood Army train somewhere else?</em></p>
<p>The crown prince’s face flashed through Viola’s mind. The Blood Army was an elite force that joined in the event of a war, so it was strange that not even a trace could be found in the imperial palace.</p>
<p>“The imperial grounds are vast. It will be hard to see everything in a day,” he said, breaking her out from her reverie.</p>
<p>“I’d like to see your office, and could I borrow a book?” she replied.</p>
<p>Lune looked at her curiously. “A book? What kind of book would you like to read?”</p>
<p>“A history book about the country, and one more about the Slovenian continent. There was a history book I read before; I would like to read it” again.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t history boring?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, rather it’s fun.”</p>
<p>“Then again, you’re a princess learned in the art of the sword. So, it’s understandable that you would be interested more in politics than dancing.”</p>
<p>“In the end, I am just a princess. There will never be a place for me in politics dominated by men.” Although she had sounded indifferent, it still saddened her that this was the state of every kingdom. No matter how capable one proved oneself, a woman was allowed no position or office in the affairs of the kingdom. They had only one duty: to form an alliance through marriage and produce heirs.</p>
<p>However, the Kingdom of Koronis had no prince now, so the oldest daughter was the first in line for the throne. Viola was the oldest now, and the first in line for the throne. But the queen was still young. If she produced a male heir, Viola would be pushed all the way back. Her fate would be sealed in existing as a wife to a soldier in an enemy country.</p>
<p><em>I can’t let that happen, I can’t let Edward’s death go in vain. I will choose my own fate. </em>Her thoughts were interrupted as the horse stopped in front of a big building. It was ten times larger than the temple by the Lake of God.</p>
<p>“My, it looks bigger than the crown prince’s palace!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“It has records dating back to the beginning when the first residents of the Arpen Empire were still nomads.” He seemed very well informed on the history of the imperial family. She decided to voice her thoughts out loud.</p>
<p>He shrugged in reply. “I am always by the crown prince’s side. Of course, I have to keep myself well-versed in everything related to the empire.”</p>
<p>The staff at the Imperial Archives were noticeably nervous when they saw Lune. They tried to greet him, but he raised his hand up to stop them. She noticed that he always did this when people tried to formally greet him as if annoyed by it all. It was a bit strange, but she brushed it off.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s go in,” he offered her his hand, “It’s been a while since I have been here.”</p>
