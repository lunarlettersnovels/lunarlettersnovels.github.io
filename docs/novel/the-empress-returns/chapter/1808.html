            <h3><strong>Chapter 98 – Aftermath (2) | 19</strong></h3>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Her pink n*pples, moist from his saliva, started sticking out. As his m@nhood swimmingly went for her core, he used the tip to press on the cl!t. As his pre-c*m started to drip, Lustian’s eyes turned glossy. After correctly positioning the tip of his rod, he penetrated her right away.</p>
<p>“Ah!!”</p>
<p>“Ghh…. It’s tight.”</p>
<p>His chin was shaking. It hurt like it was the first time. Both of them stuck to each other perfectly. Their lower bodies interlocked without a gap felt achingly good. His round, erect m@nhood was heating up like it would explode any minute.</p>
<p>Right then, he abruptly lifted her and sat down. Soon after, a one eyed monster, extremely large in size, was strutting before her. As soon as it saw Viola, it bowed to her as if it had found its master. A low sigh escaped her lips. As sticky pre-c*m oozed out of the tip, it trickled down along his throbbing member. <em>Gulp</em>, she swallowed her spit.</p>
<p>“S*ck on it.”</p>
<p>He wanted fellat*o. She gulped as she stared at a massively erect rod. She took a deep breath and grabbed it. The large shaft was as hot as a pillar of fire. It had been a while since she performed a bl*wj*b, but it still wasn’t difficult. Even if it was so large that she couldn’t even fit half of it into her mouth, she had learned enough about it in order to be able to suck on it.</p>
<p>Viola gazed at the man’s face for a little bit, noticing the teeming l*st. Then, she used the tip of tongue to lick the tip slightly. The rod shot up with seemingly no limit. A strange m*an came gushing from above.</p>
<p>“Ugh, that’s good. Viola… ah—”</p>
<p>He touched her earlobes softly. Viola opened her mouth as wide as she could to s*ck on the shaft. As soon as she s*cked on it hard, his back twitched lightly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his member slammed upwards with all its might. The pain from how it hit her uvula teared her up. It was harder than she thought since her mouth was quite small. Her chin was aching. She stuck out her tongue as she licked the shaft and sucked on the tip. The pre-c*m gushing out from his body rode along her lips and dripped all the way down her chin.</p>
<p>“More! S*ck on it even harder. Ugh….”</p>
<p>“Mmm, ugh…..”</p>
<p>She did as she was bid. And in the next moment, his back shook gently as his hips thrust back and forth. The most surprising part was that even as he moved, his rod did not touch her uvula again. She did not feel like she needed to hurl even while she was taking in his m@nhood that filled up the inside of her mouth in its entirety.</p>
<p>“Mmmm… ha….”</p>
<p>It was that moment when his dark body hair touched the tip of her nose, he panted like a beast as he repeatedly touched Viola’s face and m0unds. When his member and Viola’s body became wet enough, he aimed its tip at her hole once again. Then, he hoisted himself up with all his might.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“I thought we might need some lubricant, but… this is just right.”</p>
<p>They were completely soaked.</p>
<p>Using his fingers as tweezers, he gently nipped her n*pples. The electrifying pleasure struck right through her mind. She was swamped with so much heat that she felt like her eyes would pop out. She was drenched from the come. She wanted to quell his heat because he was so turned on.</p>
<p>He started thrusting in full swing. <em>Slam, slam, slam!</em> The sounds of flesh slapping against each other rang through the air</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>She gasped like she was vomiting as he penetrated right to the hilt like he was piercing her belly. This was the first time she had had s*x in eight years, but Viola felt as awkward as it would’ve been during the very first time.</p>
<p>As the co*tus started, he stopped talking. All he was focused on was the carnal pleasure. The awkward silence was filled only by their haggard breathing. It was a l*stful feast that lacked any emotion but bodily pleasure. There were times they made eye contact. In contrast to his eyes filled with desire, the corners of his lips were twisted in a melancholic expression.</p>
<p>A part of her heart stung. She felt empty and desolate. The more she tried fulfilling her yearnful desires, the more a part of her heart was being emptied. In any case, their relationship was one that couldn’t be fulfilled.</p>
<p><em>‘This was a man that wanted me so much but… I couldn’t help but leave him. Because I… wanted to make Edward’s dreams come true.’</em></p>
<p>Now that dream is long gone, though. No, she had already given up on that dream eight years ago. Without realizing, Viola’s hands were caressing Lustian’s face.</p>
<p><em>‘If the God found his companion, your chronic illness would also disappear, wouldn’t it?”</em></p>
<p>She gently touched his beautiful face. Such a sweet expression in his eyes, yet he lacked the smile he had long ago.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…. Ugh….”</p>
<p>The area that interlocked with his body was splashing about from the inside. The place that was soaked in each other’s come was stuck together even more closely. Her back almost shattered, Viola uttered a coquettish noise.</p>
<p>Just then, something abruptly surged from down below. The hot fluids rode along her vessels and spread across her mind at an alarming rate. She was suddenly rendered breathless. Her heart fluttering and thumping.</p>
<p>Lustian grabbed her arms and changed positions. It seemed like her legs went up and then rolled up in a ball. Her legs were placed on his wide shoulders, he moved to fill his desires. With the amount of powerful movements, the creaking of the bed echoed. It was so noisy, it sounded like it was going to collapse anytime.</p>
<p>Every touch sent Viola into raptures as she was climbing to her climax while drowning in the intense pleasure. Then, she blacked out. Beastly moans escaped their lips.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>So much time had passed that the sun was about to set, but it didn’t seem like Lustian intended to spend the night in the forest.</p>
<p>There was a lot of commotion coming from outside of the campsite. <em>Could the coach make its way through the dense forest? </em>They were doubtful, but the use of magic could make it possible…</p>
<p>When they went outside, it seemed like there were even more people than before. Given that they could also hear the sound of a woman’s voice, they thought that a maid had arrived.</p>
<p>Viola’s eyes forcibly flew open. The amount of wailing she did… It was very embarrassing. Her whole body was stiff. She had to immediately check if the others were all right, but Lustian would not let her go. If she moved even a little, he would grab her waist and pull her into his arms.</p>
<p>His chin touched the top of her head and it felt sharper than before. Viola’s eyes were to his chest. Perhaps because his shoulders were wider than before that his face was relatively slender, but overall he had definitely lost a lot of weight. It must’ve been because he had travelled far and wide throughout the Slovenia Continent to find her.</p>
<p>“If I calmly come along with you, will you stop bringing harm to my people?”</p>
<p>“Do you finally admit that you engaged in espionage?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>The one who snuck into his imperial harem and siphoned off the information hidden in the castle was Viola. Fueled by the desire to avenge Edward and become King, she had betrayed his trust.</p>
<p>However, Viola didn’t use the information she was privy to for the war. All she did was run away from the war because she could not point a sword at his chin.</p>
