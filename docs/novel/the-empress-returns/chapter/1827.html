            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 79 – Meetings (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>“Trust me, as much as I trust you. And wait… Until I become the emperor of this empire,” Lustian said.</p>
<p>“The emperor is still alive and you say that… You’re a bad son!” VIola remarked.</p>
<p>“He knows that I’m not a loyal son. In fact, perhaps I’m a son that doesn’t even deserve the title of Crown Prince. Haha…!!”</p>
<p>She couldn’t figure out what he meant by that. Viola turned her head slightly and looked at his face. His beautiful eyes stayed on her face for just a moment and fell.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you everything when the time comes,” Lustian said.</p>
<p>“When will that be?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Well… Five months at least, or maybe more.”</p>
<p>“What happened to the news of Guinev?”</p>
<p>When she brought up Guinev, Lustian’s feet stopped. But he soon started walking again. Viola also walked to match his stride.</p>
<p>“She’s alive. Isn’t that enough for you to know?” he said flatly.</p>
<p>“I have to see her.” Viola insisted.</p>
<p>“It’s a place you can’t go see.”</p>
<p>“Where is that place?”</p>
<p>There was no place in the world that could not be seen. She had to see her, as she could only move Edward’s tomb on the condition that she finds Guinev and confirms whether she is alive or dead. But Lustian hadn’t told Viola her location.</p>
<p>“A Realm of the Gods. It’s a faraway place that humans cannot reach.”</p>
<p><em>Realm of the Gods? So was there another realm of God in the Arpen Empire besides the Lake of God? Was Guinev locked away in such a distant place?</em> Viola only had more questions.</p>
<p>Before long, the imperial palace stood before them. Walking like this, she found that his residence was very close to the Concubines’ Palace.</p>
<p>As the two walked tenderly holding hands, the eyes of everyone around widened. Lustian moved his hand to block their gazes around him, and Kyle moved his attendants away. As they walked into his office together, Kyle’s gaze drilled into Viola.</p>
<p>He was No. 2 on Viola’s watchlist. The No. 1 most important person to watch out for was Ivan, and No. 3 was the crown prince. Ironically, No.3 on the watchlist and the head of the Blood Army himself was the most reliable man as of right now.</p>
<p>“You can read whatever you like,” Lustian said.</p>
<p>“That’s nice.”</p>
<p>Lustian busied himself with work. It seemed there was much work to be done in a hurry as he kept conversing quietly with Kyle. His office was spacious, so her movement was not constrained. Viola walked into the room connected to his office. Her eyes widened at the huge bookshelf that filled the room.</p>
<p><em><strong>This chapter was brought to you by Lunar Letters. Please read at the original site.</strong></em></p>
<p>In his office, there was an extensive shelf full of books on Slovenian history. She looked from between the bookshelves at Lustian. She could see him through the slits between the books, but he wasn’t paying attention to her at all.</p>
<p>Viola’s eyes moved quickly about the room. <em>Are there any clues here?</em> She thought to herself as she looked around.Then, a certain book grabbed her attention.</p>
<p><em>…《The Love of the God of Judith》… ?</em></p>
<p>It was a divine love song that was passed down between girls.</p>
<p>She opened the old parchment book, and sure enough, the 《Song of Love》was written there. She’d heard this song since she was young, so she couldn’t say it was anything special. However, interestingly enough, there was an additional verse at the end.</p>
<p><em>Oh? That wasn’t the end of the song?!</em></p>
<p>It was quite surprising. Viola was amazed. She’d had no idea that there was another verse after 《Song of the Foolish God》.</p>
<p><strong>♪ Do not be sorrowful any longer, my son! I shall give you a chance. I will split your heart in half.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The other half shall be sent to the human world, and the day you find it, you will love again. ♪</strong></p>
<p><em>Finding the other half? God’s Companion?</em></p>
<p>Viola turned over the last page of the book, after the end of the song. She noticed a knife cut between the cover of the book. A cold sweat broke out on her forehead. She gently opened the cover of the book that had been cut with a knife. A little piece of cloth fell out. The cloth looked like a map.</p>
<p>“What are you reading?”</p>
<p>She suddenly heard Lustian’s voice behind her. Viola gave a start and quickly slipped the cloth into her sleeve. Then she turned around as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of books here. There is even a book about the foolish God of Judith,” she said in a bid to conceal her movements just then.</p>
<p>“Why is that book here?” He was puzzled.</p>
<p>“Is this a book that wasn’t here before?” Viola queried.</p>
<p>“It’s a book I don’t want to see, so I meant to put it in the Imperial Library.”</p>
<p>Viola pulled out a Slovanian history book from the bookshelf. But Lustian slipped the book out of Viola’s hand and reinserted it.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t you like to ride a horse rather than read a book?” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes. I would.”</p>
<p>“I was just feeling a need for some fresh air too. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>She followed Lustian again, out to the stables this time. There were already two horses prepared. Viola wondered for a moment what to do about her dress, but today she was not riding alone. Lustian got on the black horse and took her hand.</p>
<p>“This fellow is quite strong, and he can easily take two passengers.”</p>
<p>Viola simply stared at him with a blank expression, so he pulled her up by the hand. He had such strength that she was easily lifted up and onto the horse.</p>
<p>“Hold on tight. We’re going to go fast.” He cautioned.</p>
<p><em>Neigh-</em></p>
<p>As the horse lifted its front hooves high, her body nearly slid backwards off the horse. Viola was forced to hold tightly onto Lustian’s waist. She heard the sound of his chuckle. He struck the horse with his heels and the beast sprinted across the vast land, carrying the two of them. It ran vigorously around the Lake of God, its usual course with him.</p>
<p>She hadn’t realized it when she was riding alone but the speed was incredible. It felt like she would fall off even if she loosened her grip just a little. She didn’t want to end her life by falling off a horse, so she grabbed his waist even more tightly. Her chest was against his broad back. It was an unavoidable situation, but for some reason, she felt strange. Her heart raced. At the same time, an inexplicable feeling surged from below.</p>
<p>“When the time comes, I’ll let you go, so don’t think about running away on your own. If you disappear, I might go mad.” Lustian’s voice sounded amidst the wind’s whistle in her ears.</p>
