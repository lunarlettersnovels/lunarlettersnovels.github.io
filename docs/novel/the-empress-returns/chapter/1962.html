            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 1 – The King’s Illegitimate Daughter</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every human being harbors certain dark desires within the heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola was no different. She dreamt about recovering her status and being recognized as a princess of the kingdom once more; however, instead of the pen, she had to wield the sword. Instead of basking in the sun gracefully sipping tea, she had to ride horses and train in swordsmanship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was this the case?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precisely because Viola was only half a royal daughter. Her very existence was a disgrace to the kingdom as half the blood in her veins was considered dirty. Yet the king, who had never accepted her as a royal daughter before, visited Viola himself one day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you wish to avenge Edward?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola’s ears perked at the king’s words. Edward, her elder brother by two years, was slain on the battlefield. … slaughtered by the Blood Army of the Arpen Empire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She still remembered the last time she had seen him. His body lay under a tree, pierced by a sharp spear extending from his bottom right to his mouth. It was a terrible, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gruesome </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sight and way to cross the underworld. From the moment she had glimpsed his desecrated body, the Arpen Empire became her enemy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal the king was offering was too sweet a temptation. He was giving her the chance to avenge Edward who had been unjustly killed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’m the sole prince of the Kingdom of Koronis, and I am going to be king.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What once had been Edward’s dream was now Viola’s. Since the kingdom had no other prince, it only meant that one of the princesses would become queen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes held fierce determination, she wanted to be that one princess. “What do you want me to do, Father?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Go to the Arpen Empire as a potential crown princess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?!” Viola was stunned. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did he mean by potential crown princess —?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Go to the Arpen Empire as a Crown Princess Candidate. I’ll give you your mission then. You can get your revenge once you finish your tasks. If you seize this chance, I shall bestow you the same opportunities as the other princesses. I will restore your status so that you can once again inherit the throne. Decide, Viola.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola bit her lips and nodded to show that she understood. “I understand. I will take the deal. But, Father, please give me reliable proof of your promise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Proof? Did you just say proof?” The king was visibly shocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.” Undeterred she affirmed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had lived in an abandoned castle for thirteen years without ever receiving any proper care. Although supplies would arrive once a month, they were much too little to feed three mouths. While her nanny foraged for fruits and mushrooms all year round, Edward hunted in the woods and cut down trees for firewood. She had lived a particularly difficult life, never even owning a proper dress, all because her mother had been a slave …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king looked at the girl before him, who was looking back at him, and laughed as if he were astonished. Other women would have been frightened out of their wits, but not her. To Viola, the king was just a father who had abandoned them. She couldn’t believe his words no matter what he promised without something to vouch for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king was locked in thought for a moment, then finally, as if he had made up his mind, he withdrew something from his sleeves and held it out for Viola. Her eyes popped wide open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he brought out was none other than the dagger that was traditionally handed down, generation to generation, to crown princes of the Kingdom of Koronis. Crafted from gold and adorned with the most precious jewels, the dagger made for a dazzling sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This should be enough to serve as a voucher for my promise, no? My daughter.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♛</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess Viola enters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was her first time wearing a formal dress. In her inexperience, the long lace and wide hem kept getting caught in her feet. She had tripped and almost fallen down a couple of times but fortunately managed to avoid such embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viola had to undergo some training before she could enter the Arpen Empire as a Crown Princess Candidate. A stern-looking teacher stood in front of her, greeting her with a bow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The future empress should at least know the history of the empire.” She spoke without a preamble. “It might be difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all right.” Viola simply replied.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was a quick learner, her life full of ordeals had taught her survival. No one knew better than her, the fastest route to living was through gaining knowledge and quickly. The more one was aware of one’s surroundings, the better the chances of longevity. As such, her senses were always open to learning. Sitting at her desk, she listened to the teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two hundred years ago today, marked the beginning of the Arpen Empire that originated from the wilderness. The once barren territory was only able to become this dominant due to the River Judith. The saying, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘the Arpen Empire quickly rose to power once the tide of the RiverJudith changed’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is accurate. I don’t know if they receive God’s blessing, but … One day, the course of the river suddenly changed. No, the continent splintered, and as it did the water gathered into the Arpen Empire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know that. The abundance of water heralded the influx of prosperity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t know the detailed history but remembered what she had read from Edward’s books. He had quite a lot of books, so Viola had naturally ended up reading some. She continued reciting as far as memory served her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks to this, the Arpen Empire was able to accumulate wealth and raise its forces, unlike other countries where their people would farm all year round yet still starve. Of course, through this, they came to possess the strongest troops on the continent and turned themselves into a robust and powerful country. They started to conquer all the smaller countries surrounding them using their superior military might. The war was so terrible that it was rumored that the River Judith was dyed with blood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The astonished teacher looked at Viola, while the latter simply looked straight ahead and continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, so to avoid war, the smaller countries had to broker peace with them. They agreed to send one of the members of their royal family as a hostage to the Arpen to form an alliance. And this practice, that started a hundred years ago, remains till date … Koronis is no different. Now, we must do the same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, because our kingdom ended up sending a hostage too.” The teacher sighed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Koronis was once a strong country, albeit not as strong as the Arpen Empire. Nonetheless, it still wielded great power. However, after they lost the last war, their boundaries collapsed. In accordance with the empire’s demands, the kingdom was now required to send over a princess as a hostage. Of course, they weren’t sending a real princess, just a half-blooded princess, but …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teacher had a pained look on his face. He seemed to hate having to send a princess, even a half-princess, as a hostage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The next lesson will be given by the top elder of the royal family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, a woman entered as if she had been waiting for her cue. Viola vividly remembered those splendid features wrapped in brilliant jewels from Edward’s funeral. She was the Queen of the Kingdom of Koronis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♛♛♛</span></p>
