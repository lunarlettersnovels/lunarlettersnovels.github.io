            <p><strong>Chapter 163</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>There was a deep warmth that spread across. The things that Ivan’s mother wanted to say to me and what she planned during her past life occurred to me vividly.</p>
<p><em>‘I want to protect my love. My love…. If I had the chance again… I would make sure… that I don’t miss it.’</em></p>
<p>The virgin was not a feeble woman. The deeper the love that formed with the God of Judith was, the more she knew that her sins would accumulate.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>She opened her eyes. The vivid dream caused Viola’s heart to flutter, it flustered her. Just then, Lustian came into the room in a hurry. He did not look well.</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>“We will have to go back at once. You and me. Us both….”</p>
<p>“…The issue with Father’s body….”</p>
<p>“How did you know about that?” Lustian’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p>“I had a dream a little while ago. A dream of Grand Duke Ivan’s mother going up to heaven to be with Father….”</p>
<p>“…Yes, he disappeared in front of her. It may have been a work of God. But considering how he wouldn’t let his descendents look at the corpses….”</p>
<p>He couldn’t finish his words. Looking at his mouth twisting into a frown hurt her heart. She went up to him and held his hand.</p>
<p>“He’s in a good place. Grand Duke Ivan’s mother went with him on amicable terms.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I saw it myself. She gave her last goodbyes to me.”</p>
<p>“She must’ve been very shaken. I heard that she fainted.”</p>
<p>“She will dust herself off. It must be agonizing to not be able to let him go despite it being eight years since his passing. Since she has to continue living, is it not her children’s duty to keep her preoccupied with other things that make her happy?”</p>
<p>“She only looked at him her whole life. A pain that runs so deep will prevent her from paying attention to anything else.”</p>
<p>Lustian shook his head.</p>
<p>“We… haven’t seen Wendy even once, have we?”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Wendy?”</p>
<p>“She is a lovely child. Mother would’ve loved her.”</p>
<p>“I can’t be so sure. Would she accept the child?”</p>
<p>“When we return, we should give her an official greeting.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we shall.”</p>
<p>Lustian held Viola tight and ceaselessly rubbed her back. She melted into his arms and held his waist.</p>
<p>The return was quick. Since they had prepared a transportation spell in advance, the emperor and empress stepped into the portal while holding hands. In the midst of her return, Grand Duke Ivan was in the middle of making negotiations with another kingdom. Viola’s return ended here.</p>
<p>She thought of the castle in God’s forest that she saw in her dreams.</p>
<p><em>I must go there and find the map…</em></p>
<p>However, that was in God’s territory. He might catch her stepping foot in the territory. Could she look for the map unbeknownst to Him? Her mind traced back to eight years ago.</p>
<p><em>How did I deceive Him?</em></p>
<p>If she had known that she was God’s Companion, she would’ve been trapped there like Guinev… It was strange that she stepped into God’s territory while avoiding being caught by Him.</p>
<p><em>How did this happen?</em></p>
<p>Just then, her eyes darted to her own lower belly.</p>
<p><em>It can’t be! Surely the baby in my stomach isn’t covering their eyes, is it?</em></p>
<p>She knew about this after she had run from Lustian, but she was pregnant at the time. She was shocked. <em>After having the baby, could it be that she could cover God’s eyes? Was that it?</em></p>
<p>Her heart fluttered. No matter how much God tried to intervene, it was clear that their love was destined to happen. She was aching. She touched her own lower belly and felt her heart swell.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, my child… Your mother will not falter. We will escape from these negotiations and live happily as a family.</em></p>
<p>With firm determination, she bit her lower lip.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>When Viola got to the Imperial Palace, she went to the crown prince’s palace. After the nanny got the message, she was grooming Wendy.</p>
<p>“Wendy!”</p>
<p>“Empress!”</p>
<p>Viola hugged and rubbed her face against the child’s cheek. She put her hand to her forehead to check for a fever, and carefully examined her for other symptoms. Thankfully, it appeared that the Judith flower was working because her light fever had disappeared.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Nanny. You have worked hard.”</p>
<p>“I did nothing. I am simply relieved that we managed to find a medicine that broke her fever.”</p>
<p>While she was saying that, the nanny looked visibly exhausted. She must have been tending to Wendy for days. Viola ordered her to take a breather. After forcing her to rest while she temporarily tended to the little girl, grabbed her hand and set out.</p>
<p>“Wendy, I have something important to tell you.”</p>
<p>“…Yes?”</p>
<p>Wendy’s eyes were round. It was time that she knew the secrets. Though she was young, she had a strong heart, but it was still uncertain as to how the little princess would come to terms with this….</p>
<p>Lustian was quicker on his feet. He took the little one in his arms and walked out. They arrived at the hallway of the emperor’s palace which was full of portraits of the imperial family.</p>
<p>“This person was the emperor from the beginning, and this one from the generation after that, and then this one is….”</p>
