<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Viola bit her lip hard. Even if he didn’t talk like that, there was absolutely no way to run away. She gently twisted her wrist out of his hand.</p>
<p>“Yes, there will be no second time. I will not avoid you any longer.”</p>
<p>“I like that. I’m guessing that one of the things that hasn’t changed these past eight years is your definite goal, correct?”</p>
<p>“You speak as if you’re aware of what my goal was.”</p>
<p>“I know it all too well. Do you really think there’s anything I don’t know about you?” Lustian chuckled and grabbed her wrist once again and brought it close to his lips.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you tell me then?”</p>
<p>“You’re a woman whose mind is absolutely full of the ambition to become King. Even at this very moment, you’re likely thinking about how you could become King. Am I wrong? And do you know that it was severely unlawful of you to use your past royal identity as a means of spying on me?”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p><em>It was a predictable response. Since it is true that I wanted to be King…. I cannot deny it.</em></p>
<p>“It’s true. I did spy. Based on the national law, I would have to be guillotined for the crime I committed.”</p>
<p>“If it were another princess, she would’ve been handed over to the court as soon as she arrived at the palace, beheaded and sent back to her kingdom. It would provide as a justification to wipe out the kingdom. Would you believe me if I told you that I once had those thoughts? If that were the case, your dreams would be in vain if the Kingdom of Koronis disappeared off the map of Slovenia. After all, there would also be no need for a king if the kingdom was gone. Isn’t that right?” He laughed.</p>
<p>He was no longer just Viola’s loved one… He was now someone who held the whole of the Kingdom of Koronis in his hands as he threatened her. It was a very unfamiliar sight.</p>
<p><em>Are these his true colors? Did he use Lune’s gentle disposition simply as a ruse to mislead me…?</em></p>
<p>“I’m telling you this in case you’re mistaken, but if you think I’m still dwelling on you, you’ve miscalculated. My feelings of love ended the day you left me. All you’re good for is relieving me because I otherwise don’t have a speck of feelings for you.”</p>
<p>“……..!”</p>
<p>Those words penetrated her. Viola’s heart hurt. <em>I thought that the way he sucked on and bit me all night was a physical reaction to his desires for me… I was sure that his hardened heart was beating.</em></p>
<p><em>You’re not… lying, are you? If that is true, why does your heart beat?</em></p>
<p>Although those words reached the tip of her tongue, she couldn’t bear to bring them out. As of now, no matter what she said, she wouldn’t be able to mend a broken heart.</p>
<p>Then it happened. After it seemed like Lustian’s face was scrunching up, his countenance changed. Although God’s Companion was found, it seemed his chronic disease remained. But then, soon enough his expression became calmer.</p>
<p>As soon as he passed through the barracks, the maids entered. Viola still looked no different from yesterday, beautifully spruced up, looking every bit an empress. After finishing her grooming, she stood up straight and went out of the barracks. A countless number of people bowed to her. She could also see the aristocrats of the Kingdom of Farus.</p>
<p>She received a greeting from each of them as she walked, and then encountered the Blood Army. She choked up inside as she received their greetings.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>After Viola had a meal, she headed towards the coach that the hostages were trapped in. She caught a glimpse of the knight that was following her- Kyle. Since Lustian ordered him to escort Viola, for a while he would serve her. Of course, it was an observer’s job to protect her, not his, but she didn’t mind if he was following her. There was nothing that could trick her, and she didn’t even want to be tricked in the first place.</p>
<p>Given that he didn’t restrain her from approaching the coach, it seemed that Lustian had given her permission to meet them.</p>
<p>“Rosha, how is Paul doing?”</p>
<p>“My Empress!”</p>
<p>Rosha went right up to her in a voice that indicated haste. Viola suddenly felt an intense heat emanating from beyond the window. She could at once sense that this heat was coming from Paul.</p>
<p>“Is he running a fever?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we need medicine and water. His whole body is burning up!”</p>
<p>“Just wait.”</p>
<p>Viola looked at Kyle in desperation.</p>
<p>“We need water and medicine.”</p>
<p>“Tell that to His Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Kyle….”</p>
<p><em>Although I know that he does not approve of me, he’s the only one I can ask.</em> Viola nibbled on the end of her lip.</p>
<p>“Though given that this command is coming from the empress, going against it would be civil disobedience.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Viola was surprised. <em>Empress? Yes, that is my identity as of now!</em></p>
<p>Kyle’s lips twitched. It seemed like he was resentful at himself for uttering those words.</p>
<p>“Bring me some medicine, water, and also food. The food should be as soft as possible and to Princess Wendy’s liking.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Right away, Kyle called out to the nearest valet. It wasn’t very long until the valet fetched everything that she requested. As soon as the command was given out to treat Paul, multiple valets administered the medication and disinfected the wounds. Then, they wrapped up his wounds with a clean cloth and moved him to the luggage compartment where he was laid down in a bed.</p>
<p>Rosha and Wendy were able to step outside for a short while. Wendy, pleased to be out after a day, bounced around the coach. Viola looked at the little girl satisfyingly.</p>
<p>“She’s grown up so well, hasn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Viola closed her eyes gently. Her eyes were full of love as she stared at Wendy.</p>
<p>“What do we do now? There will be limits to hiding her.” Rosha whispered to Viola, being mindful of her surroundings as much as possible.</p>
<p><em>That is true. There will be limits to hiding Wendy’s identity.</em></p>
<p>Viola’s eyes wouldn’t leave Wendy. It was very clear that her nanny brought up Wendy with a lot of nurturing care. Like all the other princesses… Wendy grew up to be a happy princess. How heartbreaking must it have been to have been separated from that child until she went into the forest… There was no end to how worried she was that any danger that befell the little girl would’ve been Viola’s own fault.</p>
<p>“I think my nanny brought her up as she did me.”</p>
<p>“It looks that way to me too.”</p>
<p>Both of them smiled lightly.</p>
<p>Wendy was not the daughter of the King of Koronis. It was because she was Viola’s daughter… The child’s father was Lustian.</p></div>
