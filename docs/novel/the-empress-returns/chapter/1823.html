            <p><strong>Chapter 83 – What of Love (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>The only way to keep this woman, who wanted to be king, was to make her his Crown Prince Consort so that she could become Empress. Before the five-month period ended, he would have to make her his Crown Princess. He had already made up his mind that he was going to formally raise her up as his Crown Princess and keep her around forever- until death do us part.</p>
<p>There was a limit to his fake laughter, hiding his inner thoughts. A joyful smile hung on Lustian’s lips now. The thought of crowning her as his princess instead of divorcing her as she expected made his heart swell with joy.</p>
<p><em>But you can never know…</em></p>
<p>Currently, amongst the nobles of the Arpen Empire, Viola was the most interesting subject of gossip.</p>
<p>The ugly princess who was receiving direct attention from the crown prince, who sought after her daily like a madman… A scandal unprecedented in the history of the entire empire- was what people were calling it.</p>
<p>In addition, there was another rumor spread in secret – that the crown prince would soon make Viola his crown princess. This rumor was the deliberate mechanition of Lustian’s people. Until the fact that Viola would eventually become Crown Princess was well-known by all the royal family and all the nobles, he would love only her.</p>
<p>Not just in body, but in his heart as well.</p>
<p><em>…Oh Gods… You have won…</em></p>
<p>For the first time, Lustian admitted defeat to the Gods. Unlike how he had been at first, he no longer cared whether Viola was a test sent by the Gods or not. He didn’t want to lose her to anyone.</p>
<p><em>I’ll never lose her to anyone. No one can take her from me.</em></p>
<p>Little by little, Lustian’s black eyes began to turn red. He couldn’t control his excitement, and bit by bit, started removing her clothes. Viola’s face had also unmistakably reddened. Small moans escaped from between her lips.</p>
<p>“Aah… mm—”</p>
<p>“Viola… love me.”</p>
<p>“Nngh… ahh—”</p>
<p>He felt that if he ever heard her say that she loved him, nothing could make him happier. If she were to say those words with her beautiful lips, his feelings for her would deepen enough to want to give her the emperor’s crown, and not just the crown princess’s.</p>
<p>But she didn’t say it.</p>
<p>Because he was the head of the Blood Army… Because he was responsible for her brother’s death…</p>
<p>He had already known that even if her body did not reject him now, her heart would still not be moved. His heart hurt as if it was being squeezed. Like someone was thrusting a sword into his crushed heart… It was another kind of pain, different from the seizures.</p>
<p><em>Still… It’s okay… Even if your heart is not mine if you just stay by my side… Even if only your empty shell were to remain, I would still love you.</em></p>
<p>A bitter smile caught on Lustian’s lips. But that lonely smile immediately turned into a brighter one.</p>
<p><em>May not be now, but someday… someday you will love me. Because I’m going to show you all of me… Even the military power of this Arpen Empire, all of my big and small tasks, I’ll show you intimately… You can see and hear whatever you want to know. I will trust in your promise not to leave me….</em></p>
<p>Even though he couldn’t win her heart right away, he looked forward to the day, someday, when she would love him. Lustian thrust his erection into her wet cavern. He watched as her nape trembled. As he lightly bit down on it with his teeth, she trembled slightly again.</p>
<p>“Aahh—”</p>
<p>“Hahh… hngh—”</p>
<p>Once he thrust into her, he didn’t stop. He laid her down on his office desk and rammed into her ruthlessly. Her body trembled violently.</p>
<p>“Mmm… Viola—”</p>
<p>Viola held back her pleasure by biting her lip hard. He hated seeing her hold back. He wanted to hear her groan, so he thrust into her even harder. At this, her head tilted back and her eyes lost their focus. A small moan broke out of her lips, a strange smile spread across his face. He felt a sense of lust wash over him. He squeezed his swollen rod closer into her core.</p>
<p>The wet sound of flesh hitting against flesh filled the room. Every time he pierced into her, she grabbed his shoulders to support herself. He sucked harder on her nape as her inner walls tightened around him. He nibbled at her ears as well. Heat rose throughout her entire body. He groped her twin peaks, her womanhood seeping with nectar, was wet and sticky.</p>
<p>“Augh, aahh.. hnngh… nngh, ahh—”</p>
<p>Two large hands grabbed her bottom as he thrust into her. Each time he did, she buried her face in his shoulder and groaned. She moved her body in rhythm with his thrusting.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>He had suddenly appeared to be in pain and then just as suddenly he’d looked okay again. He had kissed her and started removing her clothes before she had even recovered from her surprise. He had thrust himself into her before she could even ask him why. And now, Viola could hardly think about anything other than the pleasure he was giving her.</p>
<p>“Why—”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>A low voice broke through the hot air between them and spread to her ears. His voice soon led to her climax. Seeing that he was still unsatisfied despite having already come twice in a row, she felt that he was like a beast. She was sticky down there, the white fluid around it was courtesy of the man.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rattle, rattle!</strong></em></p>
<p>The desk underneath her shook in rhythm with her shaking body.</p>
