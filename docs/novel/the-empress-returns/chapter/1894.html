            <p><strong>Chapter 133</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p><em>But even so, it must be different from how it was eight years ago, right? After all, my master has reached the position of the only Grand Master in the entire continent…</em></p>
<p>Such was the case. The emperor had experienced growth after growth for the past eight years. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he could take on all the Orcs on his own.</p>
<p>Rather than absorbing the aura of a master’s sword to increase the sword’s power to the maximum, the Grand Master wields the optimal technique to use the magical power in the sword freely. Even if a crowd of masters swooped in on the Grand Master, they could never defeat him.</p>
<p>Not one Grand Master was in sight ever since the empire opened up, so it was uncertain as to how much power he had exactly. But there were ancient records that indicated that the elementals could also wield that power. This was the sort of technique that could reach the point of divinity, so it was expected that he could face God.</p>
<p><em>Her Highness believes in your strength. She intends to protect you…</em></p>
<p>Kyle glanced over at Viola. Just then, his face went rigid. He could sense that something about her was off. Because of the aura emanating from her, he could feel she was wary of him.</p>
<p>He had been suspicious of her from the beginning because of that aura of hers. He had assumed she was a spy that intended to harm his master. A princess that used a sword… She was also formidable. Even if she became God’s Companion and married the God of Judith, he had no idea that it wasn’t so easy to take her body away.</p>
<p><em>Would God expect this? That a woman who is about to become his bride is already deeply infatuated with a human… Why on earth was this fated to happen… </em>He could not understand it.</p>
<p>Viola removed the teacup from her lips and eyed Kyle.</p>
<p>“What are the conditions to be God’s Companion?” she asked bluntly.</p>
<p>Kyle raised his eyebrows.“Do you still not trust me?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“The fact that no child was born in the imperial family in addition to His Highness’ illness… These are all reasons why we couldn’t find God’s Companion. Please tell me. I would like to know what I can do from now on.”</p>
<p>Kyle couldn’t answer straightaway and could only smile sheepishly instead. The unexpected question greatly flustered him.</p>
<p>“What you can do is never leave His Highness’s side.”</p>
<p>“…I don’t wish to hear such sacramental words. I want the truth. I’m aware that until now, all those that arrived as candidates for the crown princess were also the candidates for God’s Companion. And I must be one of them.”</p>
<p>Viola rubbed her temples. It was obvious that her head was full of thoughts about God’s Companion.</p>
<p>“That may have been the case in the past, but now that is not so.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean I don’t meet the conditions? After all, legends have said that one of the conditions was to be born a virgin with the highest status.”</p>
<p>“No, you absolutely do not. God’s Companion fits the description of the highest status. If Your Highness was truly God’s Companion, we would not have greeted you as the empress.”</p>
<p>Kyle continued to talk to her with a rigid attitude. Just then, she carefully examined his face.</p>
<p>She thought that he knew mostly everything regarding the truth about her and was just trying to feel her out. He had to be on high alert in order to not get involved with her.</p>
<p>“What do you think is the reason I passed through the barrier and stepped inside God’s territory?</p>
<p>“I trust that you, Your Highness, know full well the reason.”</p>
<p>At first, it seemed as though the fact that he remained aloof to the issues about God’s Companion meant he was trying to brush off the emperor’s anxieties, but she started to become suspicious of that. Kyle scrunched up his face and looked very troubled.</p>
<p>“I appreciate the honesty. It is true. I am useful for relieving His Highness’ disease. However, recently I felt that something was amiss.”</p>
<p>“What exactly?”</p>
<p>“Does my usefulness really amount to little other than just alleviating his illness? That is what I am questioning.”</p>
<p>Kyle continued to look at Viola without wavering even the slightest. She asked again, “Is there no other meaning?”</p>
<p>“There is none.”</p>
<p>He was straight to the point. Even with his calm and collected answer, her suspicions would not fade.</p>
<p>“Please tell me how to find God’s Companion. What is the method? I can help.”</p>
<p>“I cannot disclose that. I understand Your Highness’s concerns, but this is all up to the emperor himself. No one must meddle with the pledge given by God to the emperor. All you, Your Highness, must do is lend a shoulder to lean on whenever the emperor is weary. If you must, give him a kiss when he is in pain and can no longer stand to watch his suffering.”</p>
<p>He could no longer have a conversation with her. If he continued, it felt like the truth would come out. After bidding him farewell, she turned around. Just then, the guests were standing inside the central hall of the garden.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Viola brought up the conversation she had with Kyle about God’s Companion. <em>Who is the one person concerned for Lustian’s well-being? </em>she thought, and then saw Kyle. He was a naively honest knight. Not only was he far from greedy for power but was also full of loyalty for Lustian only.</p>
<p><em>‘He’s the type to throw himself in the fire if he thought that Lune was in danger….</em></p>
<p>Although Lustian was a man sent over to protect her, that only applied when she was the empress. It would’ve been a different story if she were an obstacle to him instead of the empress.</p>
<p><em>Could Viola be…</em> <em>Since I passed through the barrier imbued with the breath of God, perhaps I am related in some way to God’s Companion?</em></p>
<p>Of course, if you combined all the circumstances, she was meant to be a treatment for the curse, but unless she went in and out of God’s body, there was no way of confirming God’s will.</p>
