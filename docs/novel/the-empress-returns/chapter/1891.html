            <p><strong>Chapter 136</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>“I love you….”</p>
<p>A faint source of light quivered in the dimly lit library. In the library, his rising warmth subtly pushed her closer to the edge. The lust burning up from deep inside her seduced her in ways that could not be described.</p>
<p>Soon enough, they interlocked from below. As if they had been waiting for it, their moans echoed throughout the room. They acted upon their instincts only. His body pierced her deep within.</p>
<p>“Ahhh….”</p>
<p>The afterimage in the darkness displayed his beautiful movements. At the same time, she squirmed intensely as a result of the intoxicated pleasure. One of her legs was hanging over his arm. The thickness of his member going in and out of her lace underwear left her mouth agape.</p>
<p>His haggard breaths drenched her ears, his noises were tinged with anxiety. Even if they wouldn’t say this to each other, she could feel it. That he shared the same sentiments with her…. Even while she spent every day in a dreamlike state, she also felt that there was a huge amount of pressure weighing down on her chest.</p>
<p><strong>(If you aren’t God’s Companion, help us find them! That is your purpose!)</strong></p>
<p>It was like someone was shouting this in her ear repeatedly. That the duties weighing on him weren’t just his to bear…</p>
<p>Viola closed her eyes. Just then, she pictured the parchment in her head. On the parchment hovering over her head, it seemed that a flashy and complex emblem started forming, but the meaning of it was ambiguous. Viola thought she was seeing things and her eyes went wide at the thought.</p>
<p>Suddenly she was in a state of shock. It showed up briefly and then disappeared, but she was sure she saw it. When she opened her eyes wide, a bunch of letters in clear print were shown on the parchment. Viola then felt like she was struck by lightning.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Viola had a dream. It was the forest that she grew up in during her youth. It was full of the fragrance of flowers, and adorable animals were frolicking in the field of flowers. Even while grieving the loss of her mother, the siblings, who only had each other, did not despair and instead had hope. <em>One day, when they escaped the forest, only good things would happen.</em></p>
<p>Just then, a man approached the siblings. Since it was so long ago, she couldn’t remember it, but it seemed like he had appeared not long after they were trapped in the forest. They surmised that he came to find them when he finally regained his spirits.</p>
<p>“You are highly valuable individuals. The time will come when the world will recognize your worth. Edward… Viola… You belong to the bloodline of the esteemed royal family.”</p>
<p>Wearing a benign smile, the man soon left the forest. The two children looked straight at each other’s faces and tilted their heads. The one who first spoke was Edward. He patted young Viola’s head with a bright smile.</p>
<p>“Mother said the same thing, that we are valuable individuals. Viola… We must never be discouraged no matter the number of fingers that are pointed at us. We have royal blood running through our veins, and someday Father will come to recognize us as his own children.”</p>
<p>Viola nodded and stretched her arms out to her brother. His embrace was as warm as her mother’s. That was when it happened. Edward suddenly grew up to be an adult and held her tight.</p>
<p>She teared up. “Edward!”</p>
<p>It was the first time that she saw Edward, not in a bloody state but just smiling instead. It was also the first time she saw him in a tail-coat instead of being buried under a bloody flag.</p>
<p>He held her so tight to the point where it was as if he would crush him. Then, he whispered softly in her ear.</p>
<p>“My younger sister… Viola. Do not fear the test that God has given you. Do not be afraid. Viola… Viola… Remember that I am always by your side, Viola….”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Suddenly, she opened her eyes. Such a vivid dream left Viola in a daze.</p>
<p><em>Who was that? Who was that man?</em></p>
<p>After hearing such strange words from a man that she didn’t even remember, he had never showed up again. Though she tried to recall his face, his back was facing the sun, so she couldn’t even see his face in the dream.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cough, cough…</strong></em></p>
<p>Suddenly, she was coughing and felt shivery. She thought that the s*x they had in the library the previous night had taken a toll on her. It seemed that she caught a cold after riding a horse while she was sweating. The coughing caused Lustian to also stir from his slumber.</p>
<p>“What’s happened? Are you coughing?”</p>
<p>“No, I am alright. <em>Cough</em>….”</p>
<p>“This won’t do. Wait. I will call for somebody.”</p>
<p>“That’s alright. After a good sleep, I will be alright.”</p>
<p>Viola chose to go back to sleep rather than taking medicine. Lustian looked at me worryingly and then put his hand to her head.</p>
<p>“You don’t have a fever, but… Come here. I will hold you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hold me.”</p>
<p>He enveloped her in his arms and rubbed her back. She was happy. She was so happy that she wouldn’t care if she dropped dead at that moment. To ensure their happiness, she had to make a decision. Soon after, she remembered the letters on the parchment she saw the previous night.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, her body was shivering. Lustian pulled her into a deeper embrace. While in his warm embrace, she made a decision.</p>
<p><em>Edward… Watch over us…</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The next day, Lustian called for the nanny and asked her for a favour with regard to Viola. Although it seemed that his relationship with the nanny was fraught, now that Wendy’s identity had been revealed, the nanny also no longer thought of him as the enemy.</p>
<p>“I knew you would end up with cold chills at least once, considering you’ve been aching night after night….”</p>
<p>“I am alright. <em>Cough, cough</em>.”</p>
