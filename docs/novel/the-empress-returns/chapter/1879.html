            <p><strong>Chapter 148</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Paul had been busy the entire time Viola was unconscious. Even when his master was going through life and death, he was observing while moving quietly around the palace. The palace that was ice cold calmed down as the empress regained her consciousness, but his stern face was still the same.</p>
<p>“So his method of opposing a god is… going to war? Then how big of an army do we need?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But I heard that he hired the mercenaries through the entire Slovenia Continent and is training them at the border.”</p>
<p>“God probably knows that Lustian is preparing for a war. So that’s why he warned me.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps… that day—” Paul’s eyes trembled.</p>
<p>“I saw. His cruel fate….”</p>
<p>Viola brushed her face with two hands. The test was the same even after the family was able to finally spend a happy time together after being away from each other for eight years.</p>
<p>Paul’s heart was also heavy.<em> Is God truly trying to punish Viola? </em>He thought. <em>It seems that the sin of performing a taboo is this big…</em></p>
<p>“The God of Judith is cruel… He split the heart I gave to His Majesty in front of my eyes.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“What will you do? Looking at things, Duchess Anne’s movement isn’t exactly the best either. As Rosha saw, the duchess is a very greedy person. It might have been her plan to slip the story of God’s Companion to the empress.”</p>
<p>He had also planted someone around the duke. But they could confirm the duchess’s movement, but they couldn’t figure out what she was planning. The reason he couldn’t eavesdrop was because of the power of magic was blocking Paul’s eyes and ears.</p>
<p>“I will not stand down. I have somewhere to be quick, so I’ll get ready.”</p>
<p>“You’re not 100 percent… Where are you going?”</p>
<p>Paul looked at Viola with a concern. She smiled warmly like she was trying to comfort him.</p>
<p>“If he needs soldiers, then I’ll have to get some.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Paul looked confused.</p>
<p>SHe called Rosha and started to dress up. She especially cared about the dressing-up part. She wore a red dress with golden lace and jewels, a diamond tiara, and put on makeup. She dressed up beautifully and stood in front of a mirror. She clenched her fists and saw herself in the mirror.</p>
<p>“I am the empress of this nation. I don’t lose to anyone. No matter who is it….”</p>
<p>Viola turned around after a hard resolution. Paul followed her. A few knights followed too but she put up her hand, dismissed them, and only took Paul and walked hurriedly.</p>
<p>Beautiful Viola was the aloof royal family itself. She didn’t want to shrink in front of any adversity so she spread out her shoulders and faced her fate head-on like the bold empress she was. The palace people who were watching her bowed down and greeted her. There was a brighter light than the sunshine emanating from her body so it was enough to catch people’s eyes.</p>
<p>The place Viola headed was labour camp at the north.</p>
<p>“Empress… this place is—”</p>
<p><strong>EP 15 As Empress</strong></p>
<p>“The people I want to meet are here.”</p>
<p>Paul was surprised.</p>
<p>This was the first time Viola knew that the northern castle wall was this high. She was impressed as it looked like it would reach the end of the sky.</p>
<p>“Perhaps, it would be best for His Majesty to be prepared for the worst. When you go over this well and ride the horse for a few days, you’ll arrive at the forest where orcs are. The day of the fight, the soldiers will go over this wall and join the army that has assembled at the border.”</p>
<p>“They build it so high to protect the palace.”</p>
<p>“Yes, there are other walls that are built between 10kms of each other as well. The defense barrier is not just one but dozens.”</p>
<p>Viola softly brushed the wall while smiling bitterly.</p>
<p>“It probably means that they prepared the wall for eight years… He did… he didn’t want to lose me.”</p>
<p>“He used renovation as a reason for putting up such high walls, but no one would guess that this is for the final fight.”</p>
<p>Viola’s nose tingled cause of Lustian’s love. He was such a lovely man. How tough must it have been for him as he was preparing for this war by himself? She bit her lips.</p>
<p>“He prepared this much for me, so I can’t just sit there. I will become a good knight by him.”</p>
<p>“… I follow the decision of my king. Give me an order.” Paul’s voice was powerful. He felt reliable.</p>
<p>She rolled the hem of her dress with her hands and went into the cleanest place in the labour camp. The knights that were guarding were surprised to see her.</p>
<p>“You-Your Majesty the Empress, what are you doing…?”</p>
<p>“Open the door.”</p>
<p>“We can’t. This is a place where hostages are held.”</p>
<p>“I’m am the empress of this nation. Open the door. I will bear the responsibility.”</p>
<p>The knight looked troubled, but in the end, opened the door.</p>
<p>As the door opened, she saw the princes that were gathered in a group. They were playing chess in a large hall. When they saw an unexpected guest, they zoned out.</p>
<p>Viola walked towards them and introduced herself as per the palace etiquette.</p>
