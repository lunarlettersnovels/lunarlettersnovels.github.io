            <p><strong>Chapter 132</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>He kissed her lips. Even if he acted like it was nothing, Viola’s heart was heavy.</p>
<p><em>Is he really turning down his duty to find God’s Companion?</em></p>
<p>They said that if he kept turning it down, the empire would collapse on itself, so she couldn’t go about her day laughing without a care in the world.</p>
<p>Lustian placed his tongue on the nape of her neck and sucked on it. To him, making eye contact and love to each other was the most enjoyable time spent. He didn’t want to spoil a time of happiness, but it was important that he took care of his duties passed down from the Arpen Imperial Family.</p>
<p>“I think that your illness passed down by the curse of the Imperial House was a sign from God to find God’s Companion.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lustian’s body flinched.</p>
<p>“How do you… know about God’s Companion?”</p>
<p>He stared at Viola with astonishment. It seemed that he didn’t expect at all that Viola would know about this. It was expected that he would be so shocked. Viola wouldn’t have known this since she built a wall between her and the world for eight years. On top of that, this information was a secret only exchanged verbally amongst the emperors. Even if she was the empress, it was very shocking that she kept spewing out information that she wouldn’t have known.</p>
<p>If they couldn’t find God’s Companion, his illness and this empire would not heal. It would continue to plague him. She had set her mind straight. No matter how big the lump inside him was, she had to make a decision to protect her loved one.</p>
<p>“I know that not a single candidate has arrived ever since I came along. What is the reason, why you won’t take in concubines? Does this mean you’ll stop looking for God’s Companion? Please tell me.”</p>
<p>Lustian’s face went rigid.</p>
<p>“How surprising! You probably wouldn’t answer me even if I asked you how long you’ve known about this, correct?”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“Very well, if opening your mouth means someone would die, you don’t have to.”</p>
<p>Light curses came spewing out of this mouth. The scowl on his face wouldn’t disappear.</p>
<p>“Is it just my own misunderstanding that using the portal from the first night is the only way to determine who God’s Companion is?”</p>
<p>“That sounds like you intend to greet the concubine yourself.”</p>
<p>“…That’s….”</p>
<p>She hated the thought of another woman in his arms to death, but she thought that if this was his destiny, she may just have to accept this. <em>If the only way to determine God’s Companion is the first night… </em>Viola bit her lip hard.</p>
<p>Just then, Lustian started laughing heartily again. “How amusing! The fact that you are thinking about that. However, Viola, you missed the mark. We are not out of solutions. Even if we were out of options, I don’t have the heart to hold any woman in my arms other than you.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know. It’s a secret plan.”</p>
<p>He lightly nibbled on the muzzle of her nose. She swept her hand across her chest. She sighed slightly out of relief, but could she trust his words?</p>
<p>“I understand you are worried for me, but this is a matter for me to resolve. Trust me, Viola.”</p>
<p>He grabbed her chin and kissed her. When he lifted her jaw, her lips parted, and his tongue slipped in. Their tongues intertwined sweetly. The deep kiss was enough to quell her worries.</p>
<p>Her crazily beating heart was echoing like a drum. As the dense kiss began, their tongues were messily tangled up. Along with their tongues rubbing against each other, they exchanged hot breaths. His haggard breath mixed in with hers.</p>
<p>“Ahhh… Lune….”</p>
<p>“Don’t think of anything else. Do you understand? You just need to be by my side.”</p>
<p>His kiss drew out a hidden lust in her, following which her body shook. She became intoxicated by this atmosphere and it overwhelmed her. For a while, his kiss made her wanton, but it was exemplified today.</p>
<p>He grabbed onto her waist and laid her down on the wide couch. From below, she became overwhelmed by a hard member. She was again showered with kisses. She let out shallow breaths and gripped onto his hair.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Lustian summoned Kyle who intended to protect Viola. As soon as he heard about the empress, he was so shocked. He clenched onto the parchment on top of the desk. Scarily enough, they opened their eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Viola is not the type to stay put after finding out a secret. Keep a close watch on her. Watch her every move. And if you notice anything out of the ordinary, make sure you report it to me.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The maids took out a new table from the central hall. They spread a small piece of fabric across the top of the table, and atop it placed a silver plate. After seeing them use the gloves on their hands to carefully handle it without getting it stained, Viola got up and picked a bloomed rose. Then, she put the flower decoration on the bottle and waited for guests.</p>
<p>Her guests at the time were the princesses who had arrived as the divine candidates. They were Guinev and Anne.</p>
<p>“Ah, Kyle. Have a cup of tea with me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>When Viola, who offered him a drink, actually ended up sitting face-to-face with him, he couldn’t say anything. Watching her so deep in thought caused him to think even more about the command given to him.</p>
<p>Kyle was thinking that regardless of the results, both of their futures wouldn’t be so bright. Just like Viola sitting in front of him drinking tea, it would also be a challenge to help the emperor who intended to protect her.<em> I won’t be able to prevent the huge storm.</em></p>
