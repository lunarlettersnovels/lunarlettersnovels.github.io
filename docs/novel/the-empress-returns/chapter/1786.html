<p><strong>Chapter 120 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Haaaa… Ah, Viola….”</p>
<p>He licked his own lips. His shimmering eyes were threatening, but at the same time, they were filled with the sort of lust that no one else could see. He grabbed onto the back of her head and kissed her. Their entangled tongues were so potent and hot that her body loosened up. He gently rubbed against the mucus inside her mouth with his tongue and played with it frantically. During the powerful kiss, the fluids inside her mouth couldn’t go down her throat and instead flowed out of her lips. Lustian pulled her in aggressively and inserted his tongue even deeper inside.</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>“Haaa, haaaa….”</p>
<p>The deeper it got, the more breaths that came out. As the tongue was pushed in deeper, her chest constricted and her breathing became overwhelming. Due to the pleasure, she pressed her nails on his arm. He grabbed her waist, lifted her to bring her on top. Then, he positioned himself in her cave and went down on her quickly. As he did, a gasping moan burst out of her.</p>
<p>“Ahhh….”</p>
<p>“Move… Viola… Urk…!”</p>
<p>It was hot. The fluids that came pouring out already moistened his thighs, so Viola couldn’t hide being turned on. In the secret bush, there was a slurping noise. As she moved, Lustian also aggressively thrust.</p>
<p>Viola bluntly let out a moan. Just then, his tongue entered her mouth and messily wandered inside of it.</p>
<p>“Uhhhh… Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>A smile of satisfaction spread on his face. Clear fluids came dripping out of her core that responded directly to her movements. As if his swollen, erect member was about to explode any minute, he drove himself into her.</p>
<p>She couldn’t keep herself together because of the rough thrusting. Even though she couldn’t catch her breath, she let out a low moan because of the electrifying stimulation in her cl*toris. She was ashamed of the lewd noise she could hear from below, but she could fully feel the pleasure he was giving her.</p>
<p>She sucked on his tongue. Moving ambitiously, their tongues intertwined with each other. Just then, he pushed himself more strongly as he became even more excited by her actions. Her hole spread apart as if it was going to burst. It felt like his shaft grow to twice its size.</p>
<p>She put strength into her bottom, her body was burning up with excitement, her heartbeat grew more erratic. She wanted to get rid of his illness. Viola moved her hips like mad. She was showing him a more erotic side to her than usual. With her whole body, she wanted to lift the curse that was tormenting him.</p>
<p><em>Did he sense that something was amiss? </em>Lustian’s hand touched Viola’s cheek. Finally, she noticed that tears were forming in her own eyes.</p>
<p>“These are natural tears. It’s because it feels so good.”</p>
<p>“—Are you sure there’s nothing wrong?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Viola smiled wide, Lustian embraced her tightly. The way his hands wrapped tightly around her back made him seem trustworthy.</p>
<p>“You being by my side is enough. You don’t have to do anything. Don’t even listen. Even just being by my side is enough to give me strength.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>She bit her lip. She was the one who wanted to be by his side forever. But she couldn’t fully feel happiness after finding out about the previous emperor’s death and the tragedy that befell Guinev.</p>
<p>Viola buried her nose in Lustian’s chest and smelled his fragrance. It was too late, much too late but the time had come to confess to him. She prayed for Edward in her heart…</p>
<p><em>Edward, I’m sorry… I love this man. I love you…. Now I shall let go of everyone in my heart. All of the people dear to me…. My family is what’s most valuable to me….</em></p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>“…!!!”</p>
<p>Viola’s sudden confession shocked Lustian out of his wits. He held her cheeks and looked at her intently. Seeing the tears forming in his eyes made her heart ache.</p>
<p>“I… didn’t mishear that, did I?”</p>
<p>“I love you. Lune… I love you. For a long time, for a very long time, I have loved you.”</p>
<p>“…Ah….”</p>
<p>“Is this another form of torturing me with false hope?”</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t.”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s enough. Stop this!”</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>As if there was a better time for a confession, he couldn’t trust Viola’s words. His hands were trembling slightly.</p>
<p><em>Did I not do enough to earn his trust? Yes, that has to be it…</em></p>
<p>“Even if this was a lie, it’s not so bad. Viola… Kiss me. I need kisses rather than words.”</p>
<p>Her lips met his. She grabbed Lustian’s face and gave him fine kisses. She spent a while being the only one giving kisses. And when she opened her eyes, she was face to face with his eyes that were burning up. The shimmer in his dark pupils seemed to contain a mixture of many emotions. Doubt, delight, happiness, mirth… And one more emotion… It seemed to be hidden in many places.</p>
<p>“The things you said would have driven me crazy if I had heard it 8 years ago.”</p>
<p>“Agh-!!”</p>
<p>His rod poking her from below her butt became even more erect and seemed to grow. As he suddenly grabbed her waist, something shot up from below. He poked the same place three times in a row. The pleasure was so strong it was electrifying. His large manhood aimed precisely for her sweet spot. There was a flash before her eyes. A red hot source of heat struck her brain with a flicker at high speed. His chest was rubbing against her breasts and his hips kept moving.</p>
<p>“Hah… Viola…!”</p>
