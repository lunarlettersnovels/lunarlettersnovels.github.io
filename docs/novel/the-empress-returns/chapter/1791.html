            <p><strong>Chapter 115</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Yes….”</p>
<p>Viola grabbed and pulled firmly on Lustian’s shoulders. Then, their lips collided naturally. In the space between open lips, his tongue quickly slipped inside. As the lips that brushed lightly against each other collided even more closely, he grabbed and pulled strongly on her waist. They were wrapped up in the heat that burned up their whole bodies, and his tongue encroached her mouth so densely, that it was shocking. He licked her teeth and the roof of her tongue and sucked on her saliva.</p>
<p>The rapturous kiss was gradually making her hazy. As usual, her body was surely falling deeper into his kiss. Just then, something thick squeezed through her hole.</p>
<p>“The second time is usually easier.”</p>
<p>“Uhhh… Ahhhhh.”</p>
<p>Just when it seemed like his back turned away, he pierced her lower area at once. There was a slamming sound. Along with the sounds of flesh against flesh, there was an incredible bulky feeling. At the same time, Viola was shaking, unable to scream, as a feeling of delight that overcame her was so intense, her eyes rolled back.</p>
<p>Lustian kissed her lips. He stopped moving for a while as if to help her relax. Her body was full of sweat, showing how weary she was. As she sneakily opened her eyes, she saw his face drenched in lust.</p>
<p>“You should move. Like last time.”</p>
<p>“Mmmm…”</p>
<p>Viola thought of how he rode on her back earlier. Her face was burning red at the thought of how he grabbed onto her sloshing bre*sts and straddled her back madly. To tell her to do it again… She didn’t think she could do it a second time.</p>
<p>As Lustian smirked, he shook her back lightly. The intense adrenaline that hit her inner walls made it feel like her spine was melting. He began to move his body. Viola was panting, struggling to breathe.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter who moves.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Ahhhh.”</p>
<p>“Khh… Ugh…. Haaaa, it feels good.”</p>
<p>“Ahhhh….”</p>
<p>As his thick member tightly interlocked with her and started twisting around as if it was going to break off, he moaned. His eyes were burning with intense s*xual desire. The heat coming from him made her feel like she was going to wobble. The way that his hair drenched in sweat was stuck to his cheeks was sexy. Nothing could be as erotic as his lips twisted in a long curl.</p>
<p>“L-Lustian….”</p>
<p>“Call me Lune.”</p>
<p>Viola tilted her head. <em>Lune…. Is that name not an alias?</em></p>
<p>“Lune was a nickname that my mother called me as a child. Lune was used to shorten my name.”</p>
<p>“I-Is that true?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She was surprised.<em> That name wasn’t fake?</em></p>
<p>“The name isn’t important. Whether I’m Lune or Lustian, I’m the same person.”</p>
<p>As his deep voice was filled with heat, Viola was also overcome with intense heat. He grabbed her hand and brought it to his lips to kiss it. She felt a warmth spread across her chest. Showing her a warm smile, he stopped moving for a moment.</p>
<p>She held out her hand and touched his cheeks. “That’s right. You are the same person.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, she laughed foolishly. It seemed ludicrous that they spent all that time misunderstanding and hating each other. As Viola laughed, Lustian’s eyes trembled.</p>
<p>“When you laugh like that, I can’t take it.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Ahhh! Lune, Lune…. Ahhhh….”</p>
<p>The fluids that flowed out of their bodies were so moist they were like sesame oil. He shook her waist lightly, and immediately there was an explosion of moans.</p>
<p>They were burning up. Her hole swallowed his delicious p*nis that sloshed around inside. At the same time, she felt it flare up and was surprised at how lascivious he was. She was aching because of the immense tightness that made it so that not even a thread could make it inside.</p>
<p>“Ahhh… Ahhhh….”</p>
<p>Lustian re-positioned both thighs and stuck himself in all the way to the root. As he put both of his legs over her shoulders, he inserted himself deeper. His gl*ns poked at a covert place.</p>
<p>“Ahhh….”</p>
<p>Her vision was enveloped in light when she looked at his aggressive thrusting. It was driving her mad, how Lustian held onto her thighs and pounding into her so quickly without rest. He wiped away the tears on her face with his tongue, and he wouldn’t stop pumping into her.</p>
<p>“Haaa- Ah-”</p>
<p>The widely spread-out creases got her excited, and she was attracted to this sensation like a magnet. Static started to fill her brain.</p>
<p>Through the gap between her lips, a hot lump of flesh entered. It frantically sloshed around everywhere and sucked on her tongue.</p>
<p><em>Mmmm, mmmm-</em></p>
<p>The sudden kiss rendered her breathless. Lustian’s tongue revealed his ambitions so transparently as he wrapped his tongue with hers. The tongue entangling hers was so powerful and hot that she lost the sensation in her legs. He frantically touched the mucus in her mouth and rubbed it gently with his tongue.</p>
<p>“Ahhh… Ahhhhh….”</p>
<p>She couldn’t swallow Lustian’s fluids that were surrounding the tip of her tongue, and instead, they flowed out of her mouth. Every time her body shook, he used his sturdy arms to grab onto her waist and inserted his tongue even deeper. As the weight of the tongue that pushed inside became heavier, her chest became constricted, and breathing laboured. The sensation caused her to bite on her lip hard, and she stretched out her hand and propped her fingernails on his arms.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slam-</strong></em></p>
<p>There were the fricative sounds of flesh against flesh. Along with the immense bulkiness, he touched that particular spot. Suddenly, Viola’s body jumped up into the sky.</p>
