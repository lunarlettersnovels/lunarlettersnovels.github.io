            <p><strong>Chapter 154</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Look over here. If you look at the ears as if they’re wings instead, it looks like a bird.”</p>
<p>“It does not look like a bird at all, but if my adorable empress says so, I suppose I will have to go along with it.”</p>
<p>“Hold on. We don’t have any time.”</p>
<p>“I think we have a bit more time left.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness… Mmmm….”</p>
<p>Lustian put his finger in between her thighs and messed around with her plentiful bush. Just then, nectar seeped out, lubricating her cave. Starting from her earlobe, his tongue coursed along the nape of her neck and went down to her honeypot. Gripping onto her tender mounds, he put her tiny erect buds in between his teeth and nibbled on. Viola moaned.</p>
<p>“Ah, I thought there was no one here. If I moan, they might think I’m having an affair.”</p>
<p>“Who would dare to pleasure themselves with a secret meeting with the Empress of the Arpen Empire? You would probably need several necks.”</p>
<p>His teasing started to get out of hand. Inserting his manhood into her core, he started pulsing. They didn’t have time for s*x, but this was not disappointing. Every time some juice oozed out of his shaft, Viola’s face would turn red. Looking at her like that, Lustian smiled and started rubbing his rod against her even harder.</p>
<p>“Mmmm… Lune….”</p>
<p>She arched her back. His even more lewd-sounding breathing drove her to even intense lust. Annoyed at his teasing, she glared at him, but since even her rebellion was attractive to him, it captivated the man all the more.</p>
<p>“Haaa… Viola, I am enamoured by you. Even just by looking at you, my heart flutters… Can you hear it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I hear it so clearly.”</p>
<p><em>His heartbeat is louder than mine. </em>Her heart was beating only for him. Every now and then, she would think of the face of God that she saw in The New World. He was a cruel man with gentle features and long silver hair that came down to his feet and was so lustrous that it covered his whole body. In comparison, while Lustian had a cold exterior, he was warm on the inside.</p>
<p>“Viola… Viola…!”</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>She knew that the time for their departure was nearing when she saw that his hand was slowly fading away. This happened every time it was dawn, but she truly felt sorry for him. Even while knowing it was magic, she was afraid that he would disappear from her sight forever.</p>
<p>Lustian looked at her with the brightest smile he could muster. With his slowly fading hand, he grabbed her hand and kissed her on its back. His warmth was thinning out. As soon as the sun came shining through the windows, his whole body started fading away. Wanting to touch him for at least a little longer, she reached out for him. But then, her hand stopped midair when she reached for his cheek.</p>
<p>Viola sat alone in the empty bedroom. In the space where he was no longer present, she lowered her hand.</p>
<p>“Lune… See you at night.”</p>
<p>Just then, there was a knock.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>“It didn’t seem like you’d be to sleep so I came in.” The maid walked in.</p>
<p>“Indeed, Rosha.”</p>
<p>“Should I groom myself in advance?”</p>
<p>“No, drink some tea and get some air.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my empress. I shall have it ready.”</p>
<p>Viola put on her indoor gown and went out onto the terrace. It was early morning, so not a soul was awake. There was a chill in the air. The country without Lustian in it was dreary and lonely. She hoped that she would finish her duties and go back to the Arpen Empire.</p>
<p><em>…Wait a moment.</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Passing by the longing princess, Viola crossed the border. On this road, Anne and Ivan were inside the empress’s golden carriage. Since the next destination was Anne’s home country, it seemed as though it would only be polite to give her the best treatment possible, so she let her in the golden carriage.</p>
<p>“Our kingdom is lacking in finances. Though I am the Grand Duchess of the empire, I don’t have the luxury to distribute my wealth to the soldiers.”</p>
<p>“That’s alright. This entreaty is not meant to put any sort of pressure on you. Since we are stopping by at the road that goes through the Kingdom of Koronis, think of this as a visit to your relatives.”</p>
<p>There was no need to invest all that money to send the allied troops over. They were requesting assistance from other kingdoms, but each country was given the choice to comply. However, the Kingdom of Luanna had been thrown in different circumstances from the others. Due to Ivan and Anne’s arranged marriage, an alliance was formed with the Arpen Empire, but even before that, they weren’t already enemies. Of course, the same applied to the Kingdom of Koronis.</p>
<p><em>But would Father send the military over to the Arpen Empire? </em>This was what worried her. He was not the type to send troops so easily.</p>
<p>All she could think of was gathering up the troops. Just then, she felt as though she was being watched and turned to find that Ivan was staring at her.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you leave those worries to the emperor?”</p>
<p>“Ah, have my distractions prevented me from participating in this conversation?”</p>
<p>“We were not even saying anything. Were you that deep in thoughts?”</p>
<p>Viola smiled slightly. Just then, she turned around to look at Anne. Anne’s nose twitched as she was biting her lip. She was wondering if she made a mistake, but all she did was turn her head and not say a word.</p>
<p>She felt uncomfortable. Viola had to stop the carriage because her stomach felt bloated. As soon as she opened the carriage door, she and Rosha quickly walked to the bushes ahead. She felt nauseous.</p>
<p>“You look pale. Is something the matter?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. I just feel queasy.”</p>
<p>“How much?”</p>
<p>“…Urk…!”</p>
<p>It may have been that she had breakfast in a hurry or chose the wrong road. In any case, she could feel herself close to vomiting. Nothing was coming out but she was heaving anyway.</p>
<p>“Could it be nerve-related? A lot has been going on, hasn’t it? I am so worried for you, my empress….”</p>
<p>“Lune is just as tired out as I am. He may even be worrying more for me than I am for myself. I should eat something cold. Please prepare it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but even so~”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. I have Paul.”</p>
<p>Paul, following her like a shadow, came out of the trees. Rosha, relieved to see him, ran over to the carriage.</p>
<p>“Let me take a look.”</p>
<p>“I already told you I’m alright.”</p>
<p>“I am not alright with this, however.”</p>
<p>Paul knelt in front of Viola and examined her face. Just as he was about to examine her pupils, he heard Ivan’s voice.</p>
