            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 61 – Trapped (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Viola didn’t get a response but the slightly shaken aura around her suddenly disappeared completely. She sat on the sofa and waited for him as usual. She soon felt mana coming off from the magic wall.</p>
<p><em>The Magic Wall is about to open.</em></p>
<p>She gulped and in the blink of an eye Lune popped out of the wall. Viola got up and approached him. She stopped midway and waited for him to approach her. She wanted him to come closer so that they were in the line of sight of the closet.</p>
<p>But he seemed oddly hesitant today. His beautiful face looked dark.</p>
<p><em>Come closer, so that Paul can see you. </em>Her back broke out in nervous sweat.</p>
<p>“Viola….”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>“I… I….”</p>
<p>He bit his lip a bit. There seemed to be something he wanted to say, but his hesitation was frustrating. Eventually, Viola had no choice but to approach and stand in front of him. His dark eyes glistened like jewels and his beautiful white face was focused solely on her lips.</p>
<p>“If you want to kiss me you can just do it.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Viola let out a slight smile, making his eyes flash. He then, contrary to his previous hesitating self, grabbed the back of her head and kissed her. He frantically kissed her as he bent back her waist. His kiss got deeper as her head reclined back. His tongue constantly stirred inside her mouth. Her hate multiplied as his kiss deepened.</p>
<p><em>Nothing, no matter what… even if this kiss is really real, if you’re a royal you will never have my heart…</em></p>
<p>“Haa… haa…Yo-you are mine. Our deal is valid…,” he said while gasping. Her head bent back and her lips were sucked into his mouth. The sound of their wet kiss spread throughout the living room.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>It was her who didn’t want to break the contract. Whether he was a noble or a royal she had to divorce him. She also wouldn’t stay obediently still if he were to break his promise. She would divorce him by all means possible.</p>
<p>Viola slowly edged her steps back, he closed the distance with her each retreating step.</p>
<p><em>A little more.</em></p>
<p>She led him to the closet Paul was hiding in. She panted and tilted her head to match his kisses. When they arrived at the closet she put her hand on his shoulder. <em>Did it turn him on?</em> His black pupils shone.</p>
<p>“Mhmm~”</p>
<p>“Eup-”</p>
<p>His kisses were hasty. She had to raise her head quite high to match his height that her chin was pointing up. Her lips were covered in his s@liva and she started getting wet down there. Her body, which had been overlapped with his for nearly three weeks, heated up as soon as he touched it.</p>
<p>“Heup~”</p>
<p>“Haaaa, haaaaa…Viola… Viola… .”</p>
<p>He kept calling out her name. It was natural for a husband to say his wife’s name, but she hated it coming out of his mouth.</p>
<p><em>Who are you? Are you really a part of the imperial family? Then… then… what relations do you have with the Blood Army? Maybe, no… please, please, don’t say you are the crown prince… anything but that…</em></p>
<p>A wry dagger flashed in Viola’s heart. Everything that was strange would make sense if he were the crown prince.</p>
<p><em>The ring being taken away suddenly by the empress… the sudden change of rooms… the abrupt shift in the head maid’s attitude… the blocking of the spying gazes of the other maids… and… and…</em></p>
<p><em>Ugh…</em> her heart ached. This ache was hatred for herself … who had her resolve shaken by him.</p>
<p><em>Edward… I’m sorry. I’m going to make a final confirmation, then I’ll take revenge… I’ll avenge… Wait for it!</em></p>
<p>Viola popped open her eyes. She must have accidentally revealed her hostility as Lune who was kissing her in a frenzy stopped. The tension hung between long lines of s@liva between them. She avoided his eyes but Lune lightly held her by the chin and stared at her piercingly.</p>
<p>“God is testing us both.”</p>
<p>“……?”</p>
<p>Viola doubted her ears for a moment. <em>What is he talking about? God is testing us? Why is he blaming God for her fib about his identity?</em> She glared at him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“You’re the first woman to captivate me. The person who makes my heart race, my eyes blind, and makes me want to kiss only one person is… .”</p>
<p>He lightly laughed and gently stroked her lips. He looked so pitiful that she almost mistook it as him loving her.</p>
<p><em>Love…. Ridiculous!</em></p>
<p>For Viola, who didn’t believe in love in the first place it was no different from the fluttering wind.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if it’s God’s test or not. Just tell me the promise you made with me hasn’t changed.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“The. Promise!! You must keep at least that! Lune!” Viola’s tone had a hint of anxiety.</p>
<p>“I’ll divorce you since that’s what you want. When this test is over…,” he said.</p>
<p>“Mhmm- “</p>
<p>He kissed her again. This time it didn’t end with just a kiss, he tightly grabbed her by the waist and pulled her to his chest. Again his lips overlapped hers. It was a thick dress, but she could still feel his excitement from down there. His hard er*ct!on was so fierce it felt as if it would pierce through the clothes.</p>
<p>This should have given plenty of time for Paul to check his face. Now, they had to head out of the living room into the bedroom, when he suddenly untied the ribbon to her dress trying to take it off.</p>
<p><em>She couldn’t have s*x in front of Paul!</em> She had to get out of his hands! She had to get out from here and into the bedroom at all costs! … So she touched his lower abdomen, something she would never have done usually.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the bedchamber. I don’t want to do it in the living room.”</p>
<p>Lune laughed, shocked and pleased. He then took Viola by the waist and strode into the bedroom… soon noises leaked out into the living room.</p>
