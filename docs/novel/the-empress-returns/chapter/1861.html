<p><strong>Chapter 166</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Even if he teased her for being a greedy Empress, she didn’t have much of a rebuttal. The King of Koronis would have to step down from the throne that he so wished to protect. Then the princess will be the one to lift the kingdom. Even if there was no way of knowing whether he would give it up so easily, she wanted to make it happen.</p>
<p>If Edward or Viola couldn’t be the one, it would have to be Wendy. For the unity of the people of Camelon, it had to be done.</p>
<p>“But she’s too precious to be sent off to marry a man. Since I am to become the King of Koronis as well as your wife, she must be sent off to that kingdom.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“That is what I should be saying.”</p>
<p>Lustian grabbed her waist and kissed her. Swallowing each other’s breaths, his eyes were burning with passion. he seductively whispered in her ear as he touched her lower belly,</p>
<p>“What do I do now? I have been reduced to this state once again….”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>The bulge was obvious. He was always one to get aroused from a kiss, but to see him in such a state in a place outside of the bedroom was embarrassing. Viola looked around. Thankfully, the temple was quiet. Their fingertips met each other and then he touched the nape of her neck gently.</p>
<p>“I want to swallow your body. The only one who can quench this thirst is my empress.”</p>
<p>“By any chance, does your chest ache?”</p>
<p>“No, it doesn’t. Come to think of it, the intervals between my seizures have lengthened. Since you are by my side, I think there is no longer any pain.”</p>
<p>He brought her hand to his chest. She smiled as she felt his thumping heart.</p>
<p>“Could it be that… your heart is half its normal size.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Never mind. It was just a thought that occurred to me.”</p>
<p>“Do not even dream of it. I can’t possibly become God of that bastard.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. You weren’t chosen.”</p>
<p>He grabbed her chin and lifted it up. “Do you see Him?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“When? You don’t mean to tell me that he comes by to aggravate you….”</p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes trembled. He was grinding his teeth. His possessiveness was adorable and sweet. How could such a man be compared to such a cruel God?</p>
<p>Although, at times these cruel fantasies overlapped with the beautiful reality. When Viola went to God’s territory last time, the vision that God created for her was much too vivid.</p>
<p><em>Lune threw himself upon the lake made of my tears….</em></p>
<p>Whether it was simply concocted by God, or whether it was a truth about the past was unclear.</p>
<p>She remembered the map that Ivan’s mother gave to her the previous night. They needed to find the map. They urgently needed to find the map left behind for the virgin from the past and her own future self.</p>
<p><em>What should I do? I’m sure Lune wouldn’t let me…</em></p>
<p>Viola intended to go inside God’s territory unbeknownst to Lustian. He would not give her permission if she told him the truth, after all… Even if he gave her permission, it wasn’t clear as to whether she could go there. God’s territory was only permissible to the chosen ones, so she couldn’t help but wonder if she still was one of them.</p>
<p>“Viola… I love you.”</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>She pulled him by the wrist. They went on the path that continued from the old temple. Taking the hint, he held her arms in his.</p>
<p>“Please tell me first if the baby is alright.”</p>
<p>“The midwife said he would be alright. He will be as strong as you, so I don’t think you’ll need to worry.”</p>
<p>Lustian’s lips widened, he put them onto hers. Still clothed, they stepped into the hot tub that was connected to the old temple.</p>
<p>They engaged in a hasty, deep kiss as his lips were moving through the inside of her mouth. Grabbing the back of her head, the angle at which they titled their heads kept changing. Between the lips, his haggard breath could be felt.</p>
<p>“Viola….”</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>She took off his shirt. It was wet, she struggled to take it off, but with his help, it came off with ease. Soon enough, she could see his wide and sturdy chest, which made her gape. The muscles were as hard as a rock even when she pressed on it with her fingers. After becoming the Grand Master, Lustian had developed an even more impressive build. Since his head was small, his chest seemed relatively wider, but it was twice the size of Viola’s.</p>
<p>As she felt his skin with the palm of her hand, he breathed shallowly. As his husky voice reached her ear, he put her ear in his mouth and sucked on it.</p>
<p>“Touch me more. I would love it if you went to my lower area.”</p>
<p>“Mmmm… Here….”</p>
<p>“Lower than that… Hah….”</p>
<p>Viola boldly reached for his lower area. As soon as she touched his erect*on, he mo*ned. Pre-c*m flowed through his already soaked pants. His pen*s was so erect it looked like it would explode.</p>
<p>“Put your hand in my pants, grab onto my pen*s, and shake it.”</p>
<p>He led her hand to the inside of his pants. As soon as her hand was inside, she moved down his hips and grabbed onto his erect m*nhood. She rubbed it though it was so large that it was difficult to fit in one hand. It was swollen. His thick veins were throbbing. Seeing him so ar*used led her to also reach a similar point where fluids were gushing out of her nether region.</p>
