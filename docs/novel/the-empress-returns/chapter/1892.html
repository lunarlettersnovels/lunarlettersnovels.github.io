            <p><strong>Chapter 135</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Is that true? Isn’t God’s territory only permissible to the chosen ones?” Viola asked.</p>
<p>“That permission can only be granted by God and the emperor.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Even if God doesn’t grant that permission, as long as the emperor allows it, the person will be able to enter,” Lustian explained.</p>
<p>Viola couldn’t tell whether he just said that to quell her confusion or if it was genuinely true.</p>
<p>“It isn’t right to trust the Grand Duchess’s words. Do not depend on her words. In the past, when Guinev escaped, she was the one who ratted her out.”</p>
<p>Viola’s eyes went wide. Lustian scrunched his face up.</p>
<p>“You don’t mean….”</p>
<p>“It’s the truth. She told Father instead of me, and then she was caught right away and thrown into the abandoned forest.”</p>
<p>“In that case, what did the previous emperor see in Ivan’s mother to be so certain that she was God’s Companion?”</p>
<p>She said something that couldn’t be taken back. She gently pushed Lustian as it seemed that he kept changing the subject. Even seeing his soft eyes, it just seemed like all he wanted to do was to protect her from the truth. He was briefly deep in thought.</p>
<p>“You don’t trust me?”</p>
<p>“I am no fool. How can you be so sure that I won’t be God’s Companion even though I passed through the barrier, entered the barrier, and even became pregnant?”</p>
<p>That was true. For a moment, Viola doubted her own identity.<em> Perhaps everyone around me is trying to deceive me…</em> was the suspicion she started to hold.</p>
<p><em>If I could pass through the barrier, step into the territory, and even become pregnant… In that case, I was the closest thing to God’s Companion aside from Guinev.</em></p>
<p><em>‘Hah… How could he be so dense? Has he not suspected this? Did he only think that all I was useful for was to alleviate his disease?’</em></p>
<p>Viola was stumbling until she suddenly regained her senses. <em>If… I am God’s Companion?</em></p>
<p><em>It would mean that only by leaving behind my loved ones and going to God would this continent achieve peace!</em></p>
<p>She bit down hard on her lip. <em>No! That cannot be. Even if I am God’s Companion, I cannot leave my whole family behind!</em></p>
<p>“If that is the case, I cannot help it. I have something to show you, so let us go.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Lustian grabbed her hand and got up. She followed behind and moved over to the royal library.</p>
<p>It wasn’t so different from when she went there with Lustian a long time ago, but Viola knew that there was yet another library within the library. They stepped into the secret library.</p>
<p>Soon after, there was a long piece of parchment in front of their eyes. Since the parchment was very long, it meandered from the ceiling all the way to the floor like a snake. When given a closer look, two-thirds of the parchment was full of letters but the rest was empty.</p>
<p>“What is… this?”</p>
<p>“The history of the Arpen Empire. The history that already happened and will soon happen.”</p>
<p>Viola’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p>“Now, let us look here, shall we? We have a long way to go.”</p>
<p>An unknown language flowed out of Lustian’s mouth. Along with the language she never heard of before, the parchment reacted like a living creature and opened up in front of both of them.</p>
<p>“This parchment was not written by the hand of a human, so there is no sneaking past it. Read here.”</p>
<p>The records that Viola was reading were about the secrets of Ivan’s birth. It was a very detailed record of how Ivan’s mother entered the castle and how she became pregnant. It was also written that it wasn’t that she went inside the abandoned tower because she was suspected to be God’s Companion, but that she went in herself in order to protect her child. After that, there were no records detailing any sort of connection with God’s Companion.</p>
<p>“…It really is true… Could I just be mistaken?”</p>
<p>“There already are records regarding your purpose as well.”</p>
<p>Lustian did the incantation again. This time, the records regarding Viola’s history were floating above her.</p>
<p>[Those who pass through the barrier but do not meet the conditions to be God’s Companion will be used as an antidote.]</p>
<p>It was definitely written as such. Viola sighed out of relief. Lustian was telling the truth.</p>
<p>“This parchment has been passed down from generation to generation. This parchment is depended on as if it’s God’s word.”</p>
<p>“May I ask if… it was also known that there would be war within the continent eight years ago?”</p>
<p>“At the time, the emperor knew about it. They were able to win the war because he was aware of it in advance.”</p>
<p>Viola sighed deeply. The parchment indicated that the Arpen Empire received a blessing from God. To have this parchment practically meant having foresight.</p>
<p>“Is every single omen recorded when they occur?”</p>
<p>“No, it is not so. All they do is indicate the approximate direction in which our destiny is headed, it is merely up to the emperor to unravel the truth.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been curious about this… Did the parchment lead you to me?”</p>
<p>“It did give me the clue to follow the old hawk.”</p>
<p>Lustian gently nibbled on Viola’s ear. His deep dark eyes were gentle and beautiful. Thinking of him filled her with sadness. It was because she thought of the time when she had run away on her own.</p>
<p>Although he used to be one to never mince words, his harshness faded and now he always had a soft smile on his face. It was so stunning that she could gasp, especially knowing that this beautiful man only had eyes for her. While listening to his gentle voice, she grabbed onto his shoulders with shaky hands. He planted moist kisses on her.</p>
<p>“Lune… Here….”</p>
<p>“That’s okay. It’s merely a book, is it not?”</p>
<p>“Mmmm…”</p>
<p>Viola’s feet started moving backward until she eventually backed up into the bookshelf. At first, she was shocked when the books came tumbling down, but she quickly became disarmed by how Lustian grabbed onto her br*asts.</p>
<p>“Viola….”</p>
<p>When his eyes shone, her heart thumped. They kissed each other on the lips briefly. The way their lips met, just ever so slightly, was stimulating. Knowing that the passion could go further than just the kisses led her to open her mouth on her own and insert her tongue into his mouth. Such a daring move, Lustian’s eyes fluttered shut beautifully. After firmly grasping his neck, she pulled his body in even further.</p>
