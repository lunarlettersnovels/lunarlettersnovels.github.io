            <p><strong>Chapter 160</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Lustian grabbed Viola’s hand. <strong> </strong>“If the people who betrayed the kingdom sincerely want to repent for their sins, send in as many troops as you like. However, this is what we will do to protect the empress. And later, leave the rest to me. We won’t be punished for helping the empress.”</p>
<p>“Lune…. What do you intend to do?”</p>
<p>“I’ll need to meet him.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“I’ll need to meet the King of Koronis, your father, myself.”</p>
<p>As Lustian nodded his head, Paul started talking. Lustian mounted the horse and held Viola’s hand. She gestured at him with a worried expression on her face. He may as well be walking right into the hands of the enemy all by himself.</p>
<p>“Who do you think I am? I am the Emperor of the Arpen Empire. We may be asking for assistance from the smaller countries, but this amounts to little other than creating a justification to free them. Even if nobody helps us, I can fight. I have confidence even if I have to face God by myself.”</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p><em><strong>Whoosh!</strong></em></p>
<p>As the wind blew, his black hair became tangled over his white cheeks. He was so charming and beautiful that she couldn’t help but exclaim. Viola bit her lower lip and grabbed his hand. As soon as they got on the horse, it ran faster than how it came.</p>
<p><em><strong>Whoosh!</strong></em></p>
<p>The wind blew again. She wrapped her arms around his waist and buried her face in his back.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>After drinking heavily the previous day until late into the night, she woke up in the middle of the night. Though they found the sleeping woman next to the King of Koronis, there was nobody there. That was when something felt amiss. The moment he opened his eyes and lifted himself up, the tip of a knife flew at him.</p>
<p>‘…Gasp!’</p>
<p>In the pitch-black darkness, red eyes were staring at him. Those eyes looked like Viola’s mother’s before she passed away sending chills down his spine. Before he could open his dried lips, the darkness cleared, revealing the person in front of him.</p>
<p>The first thing he saw was long black hair and a beautiful face, and the second thing was the sword in his hand. He could surmise the sort of knife he was using.</p>
<p>“Y-You are….”</p>
<p>He was shaking intensely. <em>How did the Emperor of Arpen end up in my bedroom…. Someone please explain this to me at once! </em>But his throat was closing up and he couldn’t get the words out.</p>
<p>“Even with the warning, you still would dare to point a sword at me. Was the crown really so important to you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t need your army. I don’t intend to accept you, so don’t expect any more compromises. So you will have to prepare. When this war is over, I will take your crown and give it to my empress.”</p>
<p>“Wh-What did you say! Have you lost your mind? This is the mother country of the empress!”</p>
<p>“I do not intend to harm the empress’s subjects. I just need to punish one person.”</p>
<p>The king stared at the emperor with a pale face. Lustian pointed the knife at the King of Koronis. Lustian’s pupils were quivering. The king looked so scared, it was as if he would wet himself. Since it was the first time in his life that he was ever intimidated to this degree, he was extremely taken aback.</p>
<p>“King of Koronis, someone like you is no different from a regent that rules the kingdom instead of the empress. You must act like one. If you cross any lines, you’re as good as dead. I hope you’re looking forward to the gift that awaits you.”</p>
<p>Three days later, the King of Koronis ordered the 50,000 soldiers to be dispatched to the Arpen Empire. While signing the agreement to hand over the army, he didn’t look very pleased. The 50,000 troops were mostly soldiers from Koronis. Viola was relieved that no blood was shed from the soldiers of her mother.</p>
<p>“I will be loyal to the empress. There, let me die as a knight of Camelon on behalf of the empress.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate the sentiment, but I wish for you to stay.”</p>
<p>With a soft expression on her face, Viola looked at Ken kneeling in allegiance before her. He had a lot to do in this place. After the war, he wanted to achieve everything that her mother wished. Since the kingdom was already wiped out from history, she intended to continue its legacy through the Kingdom of Koronis.</p>
<p>“If you wanted to unite Koronis with the previous Kingdom of Camelon, the members of the royal family who have the bloodline of both kingdoms running through their veins shall inherit the throne.”</p>
<p>“Then….”</p>
<p>Ken’s eyes went wide. Viola nodded her head slightly.</p>
<p>The unification of the two kingdoms. Viola thought that the next heir would be Wendy. When the time would come for her to get married, she would have to have an arranged marriage like the other princesses. In this continent, numerous princesses had to marry in such a way to ensure the alliance, and her daughter was no exception.</p>
<p>Viola didn’t want her little one to live the life of the princesses of that generation. She had a bigger plan in mind. She wanted to raise her to be a brilliant leader. She wanted to hoist her as the next king of the Kingdom of Koronis. Until then, she would be a charming and confident princess.</p>
<p>“If Wendy becomes the heir, Mother will rest easy. She will no longer have to feel wronged, and there will be true unity. There will no longer be any war on this land.”</p>
<p>“…This will be a peaceful way to tie things together. However, I wonder if the sly… I apologize. He’s still my father and yet I have nothing nice to say about him.”</p>
