<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 73 – Welcome Party (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>As if it had already been prepared, the party started in a flash. It wasn’t in a spacious hall with lots of open space like last time but was pretty much outdoors. Viola was nervous. It was her first time at a socialite party, so she didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>At that moment, the men started to appear one by one. Meanwhile, Viola was looking for Ivan. But for some reason, the second prince was not there. All these members of the imperial family were unfamiliar to her. Every man’s gaze turned towards her. Despite being clothed, she felt naked before them. Behind their smiling faces, they were allwondering about the same thing: <em>How did she have sex with the crown prince with that ugly face…</em></p>
<p>One of the men poured Viola a drink, whilst looking her up and down. Because everyone around her filled their glasses and drank to welcome her, she emptied hers in one go. After a while, a small heat rose inside and her body became hot. Then the imperial clansman laughed, revealing his teeth.</p>
<p>“I can see you’re starting to feel it already, so shall we see? What kind of charm allowed you to seduce His Imperial HIghness the Crown Prince—”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The welcoming party inside that splendid prison, no different from an imperial harem, was not the kind of party that Viola had expected. Each imperial family member had a princess next to him and smoked with a long bamboo stick. It didn’t take long to realize they were smoking an aphrodisiac. In addition, she could feel that the liquor she just drank was also mixed with that same drug.</p>
<p>Viola bit her lips and glared at the imperial family. Even though she was boiling hot inside, she struggled not to succumb to the aphrodisiac. She had to control the energy flowing through her body in order not to react to the drug, so she slowly channeled her hidden energy.</p>
<p>The imperial clansmen were amazed at her willpower. The warrior energy channeled by the swordsmen flowed from Viola’s body, but of course, they would never even imagine that it was truly that same energy. Because princesses didn’t practice martial arts… They simply recognized that she was a woman with a strong mind.</p>
<p>“Ho, a hostage with such strong mental power? Hahaha. Look at that. Isn’t that amazing?” asked one.</p>
<p>“Hmm… that’s interesting. Strange. With those bloodshot blue eyes, it’s kinda sexy too,” said another.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, they didn’t suspect anything. The imperial family simply scoured Viola’s entire body with their lecherous eyes and blatantly licked their lips. Curiosity and enthusiasm overflowed in their eyes. They seemed very excited that a new plaything had arrived.</p>
<p>“Is this what the welcome ceremony of the imperial family is like?” Viola sneered.</p>
<p>“Everyone was welcomed this way. What, did you not expect it? Pfft.”</p>
<p>The men laughed as if there was nothing wrong with what they did. Looking at them, Viola also opened her eyes wide and chewed on their words.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame that the crown prince’s brothers are so unaware of their own shame while conducting these secret deeds with the concubines.</p>
<p>“What? What’d you just say?!”</p>
<p>“Even if I’m a concubine that’s pretty much being held hostage, your acts to try to trample my pride won’t work on me.” Viola spoke undeterred.</p>
<p>“What… what the hell is this ugly girl even saying? Loo-look, do you see how shocked I am?”</p>
<p>One of the imperial members stuttered over his words in shock at Viola’s boldness. It was not unexpected that he would be so shocked. Until now, not a single person would have said they didn’t like this type of party. But this girl seemed to think differently. She couldn’t speak for the other princesses, but she wasn’t like them.</p>
<p>“Just like the rumors said, she’s a fearless princess.”</p>
<p>A royalty laughed. Viola raised her head stiffly and shot a defiant glare at him. The other’s shoulders slightly sagged as the royal light flowed through her tightly closed lips.</p>
<p>Viola squared her shoulders, raised her chin high, and this time looked at the princesses. Her eyes were cold.</p>
<p>“How is it? Are you having fun?”</p>
<p>Viola looked condescendingly at the princess who had given the idea for the party. She shrugged her shoulders as if to say it wasn’t really that big of a deal, and rather thought Viola was the one acting strangely. The other princesses also tilted their heads and acted as if they didn’t know what was wrong.</p>
<p>“Viola, why don’t you just enjoy yourself, instead of overreacting so much? You act like it’s your first time at a socialite party… You’re embarrassing me!”</p>
<p>As the princess buried her face in the chest of one of the men to try to hide her embarrassment, the man who was holding her stared at Viola.</p>
<p>“This is a rule set by the imperial family. Being seated and present, whether you like to party or not. Look at Anne over there. She’s sitting pretty without getting all bothered like you. If you have the heart to not be shaken by any temptation, you can just pretend to enjoy the party in moderation and then leave.”</p>
<p>“I refuse. Whatever the rules are here, I won’t move according to them, so don’t force them upon me in the future.”</p>
<p>“But then you’ll be missing out on all the fun.”</p>
<p>“It’s not fun at all.” Viola made her disdain clear.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then where will you find your fun and pleasure?”</p>
<p>“I’ll find my own pleasure. If forced to come out to these parties, I’ll only feel offended and upset each time.”</p>
<p>Viola retorted without holding back a single word. Rather, it was the princesses who were nervously trying to calm her down. They were afraid that something horrible could happen to her who was disturbing the feelings of the imperial family.</p>
<p>Having lost in the argument, the man looked as if his anger had not been quelled, and he called over Viola’s overseer who had been watching from afar. Viola’s eyes widened. When Paul had been brought and knelt in front of him, he ordered for someone to bring him a whip.</p>
<p>“This is what a welcoming ceremony is. Watch closely. With your own eyes.”</p></div>
