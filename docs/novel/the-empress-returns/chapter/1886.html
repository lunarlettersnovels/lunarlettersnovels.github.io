            <p><strong>Chapter 141</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Lustian playfully bit on the n*pple. Viola’s back arched thanks to hurtful pleasure. As his finger carefully came to her honeypot, there was some noise.</p>
<p>The cave that became wet the moment they started kissing didn’t have any trouble accepting his finger.</p>
<p>Her shoulders shrank as she felt something wet.</p>
<p>“Mhm—”</p>
<p>His lips came on top, his tongue licked the earlobe and then entered.</p>
<p>“I’m going to put it in. I think it’s gotten bigger, but you don’t dislike it right?”</p>
<p>“No… I like it.”</p>
<p>Viola’s body was waiting for him. Lustian returned with the brightest smile at her truthful answer. He put her legs on his arms, aimed his manhood to her hole before penetrating with force. Her chin reflexively went up. There was a sound of a smack, but it brought pleasure than shame. The inside was tightening, and each time he moved his waist, she let out a m*an.</p>
<p>“Mmm….”</p>
<p>“Ugh, Viola, hut!”</p>
<p>Lustian groaned from the intence pleasure. He seemed to have momentarily lost his breath as his shaft rubbed the cl*toris. His entire body seemed to be on fire. Each time he shoved the sensitive part and drew a circle, the point was hit and the hips shook. The juice that seemed to be coming out like a waterfall wet his rod and he thrust hard each time.</p>
<p>As his lips approached, she quickly opened her mouth. As he started to thrust into her core, she let out a high-pitched scream. Her toes curled up and her bottom tingled, she couldn’t resist the pleasure.</p>
<p>To match the tall man, she had to tip-toe. When he noticed that it was getting hard for her, he lifted her legs and wrapped them around his waist. He had such amazing strength. He was moving his waist in the air, but it was no different than when they were lying down.</p>
<p>“Ha—”</p>
<p>“Ah! Ut, hmph!”</p>
<p>He let out a rough breath and held tightly onto her waist so she wouldn’t fall. The hard member hit the deep part of her covert place. He kept hammering without a moment of rest. It was hot as if their entire body was on fire.</p>
<p>“Hmph! So tight. Ah!”</p>
<p>“…. Ha, hmph!”</p>
<p>His hot breaths brushed her ears. The air that was spreading in the small storage room got hot. His excited rod kept secreting juices and made a lewd sound at the hitting point.</p>
<p><em><strong>Squish, squish!</strong></em></p>
<p>The friction got bigger as he moved more aggressively and the sound also seemed to bring pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah!”</p>
<p>He grabbed the back of Viola’s head and put his tongue in. The soft tongue grabbed onto his tongue and didn’t let go. He entangled his tongue with hers. He shook his waist very aggressively as he glided over her tidy teeth.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>He then brought his lips to the rigid n*pple and sucked on it. The bud that already had red marks all over it was tinglied with pleasure even at the slightest touch. The lewd sound of test*cles hitting the pub*c part echoed deep in the storage room.</p>
<p>She felt like she was losing her mind with the sensation that was climbing through her spine and spreading in her body.</p>
<p>At this moment, Viola felt her rationale was about to be paralyzed because of the pleasure. No, when the s*x starts, her rationale disappears, and she only seeks pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ha… ha!”</p>
<p>“Ah! Hmm. Mm!”</p>
<p>It seemed like he got more excited as his member went inside her core. The blackish red meat that was perfectly bitten was swirling in the sensitive vag*na. His movement started to become faster and he kept going.</p>
<p>“Ah… Ah, ah….”</p>
<p>The sensitive skin of the vag*na went in and out with his meat and kept repeating the process. Whenever she couldn’t balance properly because of his strength, he would grab and straighten her waist all along vigorously rammering into her.</p>
<p>“Ha, ha…. Hmph, ha…..”</p>
<p>He smiled when he looked at her mo*ning because of the pleasure he was giving her. Her breasts moved up and down along his movement. Even the sweat that was rolling off each other’s skin was alluring. The wet body that was rubbing on the skin was quite lewd. He kept on licking her cheek and lips.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah.”</p>
<p>From between the legs that were completely spread, poured down the endless stream of nectar. Each time he went in and out it felt like her stomach became hotter.</p>
<p>“Hmph….”</p>
<p>He slowly wandered into her body. It felt good. The pleasure his body was feeling was ecstatic beyond words. Her eyes teared up at such pleasure. Then he stuck out his tongue and licked the tears off. A large hand came and grabbed her chin to meet their eyes.</p>
<p>The black eyes only looked into hers. He softly caressed her lips. They were sweating buckets. As the beautiful black hair stuck on the cheek, she was mesmerized by him.</p>
<p>“I love you, Viola.”</p>
<p>He swallowed her lips with a happy smile. Viola also laughed in bliss.</p>
<p>As if he was planning on drinking the sweat that was falling off her forehead, he washed it away with his tongue.</p>
<p>“I love you too… Lune….”</p>
