            <p><strong>Chapter 114</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Anne was aggravated. If it weren’t for Viola, the seat of the empress would belong to her. She even made up her mind to use her romancing skills to seduce Lustian and steal his heart. However, one day, Lustian had his heart stolen by Viola, who arrived suddenly as a candidate and was given the seat of Empress.</p>
<p>She had to give up, as she wasn’t even given the chance. However, her dream to be Empress would not end there. If the emperor that was cursed by God passed away, Ivan would inherit the throne. A crown prince did exist, but any child without a drop of royal blood could be cast out at any time. If she gave birth within that time to a son, that boy could become the crown prince. Anne had to become this country’s Empress even if it was just for the sake of the kingdom. She wanted to make her child the emperor.</p>
<p>Just then, as the door opened, a familiar face showed up. It was the person sent from the kingdom. Anne’s face lit up.</p>
<p>“I will have you take the medicine every day. There hasn’t been a single person that took my medicine and didn’t get pregnant.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>As soon as it was nighttime, Lustian’s Empress went into the bedroom. Night, was the most intimate time shared between the imperial couple that made love every night. His face was obviously tenser than usual. It was concerning.</p>
<p>“I plan to leave the palace for a few days,” he said.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“You see, the orcs are wreaking havoc at the border.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Though it hadn’t even been long since the war was over, he was yet again going back to the battlefield. At once, she wanted to follow him with a sword in hand, but she was the one who had to protect the palace while the emperor was away.</p>
<p>Lustian kissed her lips.</p>
<p><em><strong>Smooch, smooch.</strong></em></p>
<p>As they kissed slowly, the kiss grew deeper. Viola wrapped her arms around his shoulders and made eye contact with him. He seemed much more relaxed than just before.</p>
<p>“You must be careful,” she said.</p>
<p>“I have never once made a mistake. Not one person can scathe me. If you really are that worried, give me a kiss of victory.”</p>
<p>“With pleasure. May I also give you more than just a kiss…”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Is this something to look forward to?” He smirked.</p>
<p>It was embarrassing, but after colliding against each other so many times, she naturally climbed on his back. As her thin night-wear slid down, her white naked body was revealed. Lustian’s eyes were burning with lust.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it for you… however much you want.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Lustian took a sip out of the drink on the side table. He let it flow between both lips. It was a fragrant liquor with a sweet taste. The liquor helped their tired bodies relax after s*x. After getting properly buzzed, their bodies melted like sweet honey.</p>
<p>“Would you like to drink more?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Open your mouth.”</p>
<p>Viola closed her eyes gently and opened her mouth. Once again, he let the liquor stay in his mouth before allowing it to flow out.</p>
<p><em>To think that the liquor is being passed from mouth to mouth…</em></p>
<p>It was so erotic that she herself couldn’t believe she was doing this. At the same time, it felt exhilarating. In the end, he made sure to lick the inside of her mouth with a kiss. Viola licked off the remaining liquor left inside her mouth and swallowed it. She left her body up to his kiss.</p>
<p>“Uhhh-”</p>
<p>He used the tip of his tongue to tap on her lips, waiting for them to open up, and squeezed his way in between the gap and wrapped his tongue around hers. As their tongues tangled up, they became rougher than when they started. Lustian grabbed onto her slender waist and lightly gripped onto her shoulders. Then, when she opened her mouth, he made himself at home as he whipped his tongue around the inside.</p>
<p>“Mmmm… Mmmm.”</p>
<p>They were breathless. They became more aggressive everytime he changed the angle at which his tongue was smoothly moving in and out of her mouth. Both tongues touched one another in a dance. Her lower region, already wet with s*men, became even wetter. She didn’t want it to be noticed, but no matter how much she tried twisting her hips, he was bound to catch onto it.</p>
<p>“We’re a couple. There is no need for shame.” His raspy voice sounded between kisses.</p>
<p>“But still….”</p>
<p>“I’ve been wondering, how have you held it in? I mean, during the eight years I was gone.”</p>
<p>“It just- The thought never occurred to me.”</p>
<p>“Liar!”</p>
<p>“From time to time… it would only sometimes come to mind, but that was all.”</p>
<p>There were days she would think of him and her body would heat up, but she would simply cool herself down. She didn’t think of sleeping with other men. Her body would only open up for Lustian, and even if she happened to accidentally come into physical contact with another man, her body would freeze up.</p>
<p>“Is that true? If any rat bastard lusted after you, I wouldn’t just let him off easily, you know….”</p>
<p>Perhaps he was suspicious of Paul.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He quickly snatched Viola away as she turned away, surprised at his jealousy. Then, he erotically sucked on the tip of her tongue and pulled on it strongly. He was sucking on it so much that the root of her tongue was aching. The hot breaths coming out of each of their mouths could not be swallowed. Viola couldn’t hold herself together.</p>
<p>“Haaa-”</p>
<p>“Haaa-”</p>
<p>Her heart was fluttering with joy. And the feelings that followed… She came to terms with them when her body shook from the exhilaration.</p>
<p>“You’re mine. You must never forget about this fact. Your body, blood, and even soul are mine.”</p>
<p>“Uhhh….”</p>
<p>Lustian’s lips rode along her breasts and softly travelled to her lower area. Finally, he went for her belly button. He licked it softly with his tongue. After a while, his nose was stuck in between her golden hairs. Without realizing it, her waist was twisting around and a light moan escaped.</p>
<p>“Uhhh….”</p>
<p>His tongue fumbled around with her core. He licked it with the tip of his tongue, and as he pressed on her clitor*s, her hips shook. She was ashamed at how soaked her womanhood was. Her pink n*pples were sticking up to the sky. As she arched her back, it looked like her breasts were swelling.</p>
<p>The sounds he made as he licked her were er*tic. As her thighs tightened up from the embarrassment, Lustian used his two hands to spread them apart wide.</p>
<p>“I will do it again.”</p>
