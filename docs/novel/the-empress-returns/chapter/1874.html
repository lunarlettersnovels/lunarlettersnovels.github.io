            <p><strong>Chapter 153</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“If you don’t need offspring, what does the crown mean to you?” asked she.</p>
<p>“Since I finally have my hands on the crown, now I can’t let anyone else have it,” replied the King of Koronis.</p>
<p>As the son of the concubine, he became the crown prince and swallowed Viola’s mother’s kingdom whole. In exchange, he was able to obtain the crown. He was the object of ridicule as the child of the concubine, but even so, he proudly sat on the throne of the Kingdom of Koronis.</p>
<p>Upon marrying Viola’s mother, he broke all of the royal conventions and confiscated her entire fortune. Then, he murdered everybody privy to his secret. With a slash of his sword, he beheaded them all.</p>
<p>“I’d also have to kill him. To this day, I regret keeping him alive. Have you not found him yet?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>Ever since he became king, the members of the royal household were framed and wiped out with the bam of the guillotine. However, one man was left standing.</p>
<p><em>I never have thought that a man who once would’ve given me his gallbladder turned out to be so two-faced….</em></p>
<p>[The tragedy following the Emperor of Blood.]</p>
<p>After the two-decade-long bloody history had passed, all traces of it were erased from the historical records. The members of the nobility and the subjects of Koronis were not aware of the stories of the wrongful deaths of the royal family from the small country. They only assumed that a great crown prince united the country.</p>
<p>“So did she return your feelings?”</p>
<p>“No, she refused my advances until the end.” The king’s lips twitched.</p>
<p>“If Empress Viola knew about this, she would surely resent you, wouldn’t she? All this time, she thought that half of my cultural roots came from slaves,” she pointed out.</p>
<p>“What can we do about it even if she does find out? No matter how much she may resent me, it all traces back to my father.”</p>
<p>“But at the very least, it seems as though the nanny is keeping it under wraps. Deep down, I was concerned about the fact that she was from<em> that</em> particular kingdom.”</p>
<p>“I gave her a chance. She knows all too well what would become of her if she reveals the secrets.”</p>
<p>He had threatened that if she disclosed the secrets, he would murder all her blood relations. Even if the nanny wasn’t married, she had a lot of people to protect.</p>
<p>A peal of vile laughter burst forth the king.</p>
<p>“Then from the start, Viola fulfilled the qualifications to become God’s Companion, correct? And as a result, this caused her to develop a vengeance harbored against the king that had already expected this, correct?”</p>
<p>“She has a large amount of love for Edward, after all.”</p>
<p>“In that case! Was the reason why you purposely put him at the frontlines also because~”</p>
<p>“Do you truly need further explanation?”</p>
<p>The king lifted his chin up high. Even by putting his own son at the frontlines and causing his death, he didn’t even feel a trace of sadness. He was the sort of king that felt threatened by his own son. He was the sort of unfeeling father that was much too power-hungry to care.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I wonder if you truly are the devil. Ho, ho, ho. Of course, it’s that aspect of you that renders me enamoured.”</p>
<p>The woman shoved her voluptuous br*asts in the king’s central area. His eyes immediately shone with a lustful glint. As soon as he untied the strings of her thin dress, her naked body was revealed. The king squeezed her mounds, from her mouth came a moan.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>It was dawn. Since the happiest time of the day was night, Viola kept her own eyes open for when he had to go back. Though it was lovely melting in the warmth of his embrace, she had to suppress her feelings of longing, knowing he would return the next night.</p>
<p>“Soon the blue moon will rise.”</p>
<p>“The next kingdom is on the line….”</p>
<p>“Since it’s the Grand Duchess’ mother country, she deserves all the strength she needs.”</p>
<p>“It’s best to not put your faith in the Kingdom of Luanna.”</p>
<p>“Even so, we’ve come all this way, so I think it would be an honor to witness the Grand Duchess’ strength firsthand.”</p>
<p>“My empress is much too kind.”</p>
<p>“I am not kind.”</p>
<p>He grinned and kissed her forehead. She nuzzled into his arms and buried her face in his wide chest.</p>
<p>“Ah, I almost forgot. I had something that Wendy gave me.”</p>
<p>Lustian took something out of the clothes that he thrown below the bed and handed it to Viola. Looking at what he handed to her, it was a handkerchief spun with gold. The shape of it was so indefinite that she had to stare at it for a while until she realized it resembled a rabbit.</p>
<p>“Wendy has been learning to knit for a while and this was her first try. She tried telling me it’s a bird, but no matter how much I looked at it, it seemed like a rabbit to me. I can’t help but feel as though sword-fighting is more her strong suit.”</p>
<p>“Pffft. It’s a bird? Let me see…. Hmmm….”</p>
<p>Viola looked at the embroidery on the thin lace. It looked like a rabbit, but depending on the angle, it also looked a bit like the wings of a bird. She traced her fingers across the embroidery. She was touched by the fact that Wendy sent her the first handkerchief that she had knitted. She also missed the little girl very much. There were only ten days left, but how could she wait any longer?</p>
<p>“No. Look carefully. It <em>is </em>a bird.”</p>
<p>“In what way is it a bird to you?”</p>
<p>Lustian playfully nibbled on her earlobe. Just then, he put it in his mouth and chewed on it. Right away, her back arched on its own and her whole body heated up. She could slowly feel his erection. He was seducing her, knowing full well he didn’t have time for <em>that</em>.</p>
