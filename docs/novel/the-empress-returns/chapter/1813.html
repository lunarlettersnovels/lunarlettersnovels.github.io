            <p><strong>Chapter 93 – Betrayal (1)</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“What could you be in such deep thought over?”</p>
<p>The hand stretching out gently embraced her from behind. He pecked Viola on the nape. His fragrant scent filled her nostrils. When she turned her head, she could see a man, more beautiful than a flower, smiling.</p>
<p>As Lustian closed his eyes gently, she felt the impulse to touch his eyes. Her hand reaching out without hesitation ended up caressing his cheeks instead. His eyes closed softly as he held her hand, putting strength into his palms. Just then, he turned his head and kissed her palm. She could feel her own palm heating up.</p>
<p>Seeing him so happy, she thought, ‘<em>Can he live without me?’ </em>Right then, she pulled herself together, surprised at herself. <em>‘Have I gone mad? I’m about to get a divorce with this man…’</em></p>
<p>Then it happened. From afar, she could see Anne keeping an eye on them. Against her own will, Viola became subjected to the jealousy of many princesses, so she was followed by their gazes wherever she went.</p>
<p>“Release the Grand Duke Ivan from custody at once,” Viola said.</p>
<p>“I’m in the middle of fixing up his act. I do feel like I’ve been letting him out too often as well.” Lustian replied.</p>
<p>“It’s my own fault. I am the one begging for his release, after all.”</p>
<p>Rather than personally wanting to rescue Ivan, she asked Lustian to let him go for the sake of Anne who missed him dearly. Anne was in love with Ivan. After about a month of not seeing him, she was wasting away to the point of losing a significant amount of weight.</p>
<p>“While I do adore the fellow, I will not stand for the fact that he would challenge me.”</p>
<p>“A challenge, you say? While you’re an heir to the throne, all he is is an imperial prince. There is also no younger brother of yours who would challenge you.” She replied.</p>
<p>“He is not related to me by birth.”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>Viola’s eyes went wide. To think that he wasn’t his brother by birth… You mean to say he wasn’t born into royalty?! She was bewildered</p>
<p>“There is someone else who gave birth to him.”</p>
<p>“Well—”</p>
<p>“Hush, tread lightly. This is a matter so discreet that disclosing this secret is enough to mistake you for a traitor to the imperial family.” Lustian flashed a shimmering smile as he gently placed a finger on her lips.</p>
<p>Seeing as he just revealed a secret of Ivan’s birth, she started to think that the punishment for sneaking her out wouldn’t stop at imprisoning him. She was about to inquire further but stopped since the power struggle between the two princes had nothing to do with her. They were both the same to her — enemy — regardless of who became the emperor. However, since he had brought the matter up, she had to at least pretend like she was interested.</p>
<p>“So is the investigation still going on?”</p>
<p>“It’s all over. I was considering releasing him from custody, but you see, celibacy is the worst punishment for a man who can’t live without women.”</p>
<p>Viola nodded quietly to Anne standing afar. Anne, flushing abruptly, hid her face. She would probably be grooming herself to look her absolute best for tonight.</p>
<p>“I will be late so don’t bother waiting. I have a very important drill to attend. The border is rather uproarious lately.”</p>
<p>Viola on the contrary was satisfied that he wouldn’t be at the castle. Lately, he had been spending much more time at training sessions with the Blood Army. She didn’t know what was going on outdoors, but it looked like he was lining up the forces as if in preparation for war. Not to mention how the borders were apparently uproarious…</p>
<p>She sighed softly as she watched Lustian growing further away from her. She opened her mouth after checking her surroundings for a sound.</p>
<p>“Paul.”</p>
<p>Paul popped out from somewhere.</p>
<p>“Find out about the news from the town.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Princess.” As Paul hid from sight after receiving the command, Viola decided it was time to start moving.</p>
<p>She was shocked though. She thought that perhaps the command for Ivan’s release had already been initiated as she saw him walking inside the Concubines’ Palace. With a stoic face, he went up to Viola in large strides. He looked angry but not quite at her.</p>
<p>“To think it’s been a month. Would you have assumed I was dead?” he said.</p>
<p>“I also couldn’t help… Ah! H- hey!”</p>
<p>Ivan bent forward and grabbed Viola’s hand. Then, he kissed the back of her hand. She flinched. In high society, it would seem obvious to kiss the lady’s hand, but she was flustered as she was not in the least bit used to being kissed by a stranger.</p>
<p>As Ivan lifted his head, he stared at Viola with black eyes resembling Lustian’s. “I missed you. I almost went mad.”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>She went blank somewhere in her mind. She immediately tried drawing her hand away, but it only narrowed the space between them. Viola aggressively slapped his hand away from her. Ivan’s face crumpled up.</p>
<p>“There is someone else waiting for you, Grand Duke. Go to her.”</p>
<p>Anne didn’t like being an object of fondness for a man she loved. Even if only half of their blood was mixed, it didn’t change the fact that they were siblings.</p>
<p>After giving him a cold look, Viola turned her back on him. She could hear him laughing behind her.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you one thing. The divorce you desire will not happen.”</p>
<p>Shocked, Viola turned around. There, she could see Ivan’s depressingly twisted form looking at Viola pitifully.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“You weren’t aware of how my older brother is creating a justification to get you up to the spot as crown princess, were you?”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Viola’s eyes went wide with astonishment. What was the meaning of this? She had been waiting so long for that day to come…</p>
<p>“What do you mean there is no divorce? And a crown princess?”</p>
<p>Viola felt her lower abdomen twisting into knots. All this time, she had been waiting patiently, trusting in his words. She never expected that he would try making her Crown Princess behind her back.</p>
<p>“You will become Crown Princess. Then, you’ll become Empress of the Arpen Empire. You’ll also never be able to escape him.”</p>
<p>Her heart sank. To think that she would become Empress of the enemy state! Her ambition to run away surged dramatically.</p>
<p>“He is—”</p>
<p>“He has always been that sort of man. He only has never had any sort of ambition up until now, but he is the kind of man who will never let go of what he wants once he gets it, be it women, power, or love—”</p>
<p><em>Love?</em></p>
<p>She never believed in love, nor did she ever want to pursue it. She believed that she would never experience feelings of love in her lifetime. Nevertheless, the strong emotions spreading across her chest confused her once again.</p>
<p>How much does he love me to want to violate the law of the empire himself as heir to the throne, and go to all those lengths to make me Crown Princess?</p>
<p><em>‘Ah, but this isn’t it. I… have something to do. Viola, pull yourself together! You need to go back to the Kingdom of Koronis and fulfill Edward’s dreams on his behalf.’ </em>Viola tried to calm her capricious mind as she bit her lip harshly. Then, she started thinking of the worst circumstances.</p>
<p><em>‘I do not want to live in that awful imperial palace. If… If… what Ivan says is true, I will run away. Forever away from him…’</em></p>
<p>Viola bit her lip harshly yet again.</p>
<p>“…Tonight, go back to finding Guinev. A surprise will be waiting for you there.”</p>
