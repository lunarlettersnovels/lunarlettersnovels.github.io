            <p><strong>Chapter 175</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Viola moved to the area where the man lived. She led some of the knights to an area with a lower elevation. When the rain stopped, the people went out in the sunlight and sat where they pleased. They all laid down on the dirty mud and looked at the sky.</p>
<p>“What is this smell?”</p>
<p>There indeed was a stench. The whole town was covered in a stench that could paralyze one’s nose. In the midst of that, a man coming out of his drunken stupor sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s the smell coming from the sick. They’ll smell worse the closer you get to them.”</p>
<p>“How unpleasant.”</p>
<p>Kyle was grinding his teeth. It was not just one or two children that were lying sick on the ground. Families were taking their sick children out into the sunlight. There were shallow breaths as if to signal their deaths. It was awful.</p>
<p>Viola’s whole body was shivering. Sparks flashed from her eyes.</p>
<p>“Your Highness! You mustn’t approach them.” Kyle tried to stop her, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>As soon as the empress suddenly showed up, they laid flat on the ground and started to tremble in shock. Viola bit her lip and held a child’s hand. When she looked at the child’s arms, legs, and belly, she screamed. There were black spots all over their body.</p>
<p>“What is the meaning of this? Tell me.”</p>
<p>“Em-Empress… Ho-How….”</p>
<p>“It isn’t just one child, is it? They are all having the same symptoms, correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is so.”</p>
<p>“Why only the children….”</p>
<p>“Ah… Beneath the playground is the river. Ever since the river flooded, I tried to stop them from going there, and yet they still did anyway… All the children that went there fell ill.”</p>
<p>“The children that went in the water….”</p>
<p>Viola stared at the river from afar. The river was a stream of water coming from the Lake of God. All the subjects used that water to eat, drink, and wash, so it was suspicious that only the children were getting sick.</p>
<p>“Are the adults all safe?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is only the children that are ill.”</p>
<p>“…The children….”</p>
<p>The women holding the children spoke to Viola with a pleading look on their faces.</p>
<p>“My empress, please do save our children!”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, they haven’t been able to have even a sip of water. Please save us!”</p>
<p>The women grabbed Viola’s dress and sobbed. Her heart was aching. She empathized as someone with a child herself.</p>
<p>Just then, a knight came running to Kyle to deliver a report. He had been ordered to investigate what was happening in more detail, and now it seemed like the job was done.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, apparently it is only the children between 1-7yrs that are ill.”</p>
<p>“…Ah…!”</p>
<p>“The children older than 8 that swam in the river are not getting sick.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Just then, Viola realized that this was a part of the scheme of the God of Judith.</p>
<p><em>If that is the case, then… what about Wendy?</em></p>
<p>Viola frantically got up. The water being used back at the palace was also from Lake of God. Wendy also used that water for bathing and drinking. Her face turned gloomy.</p>
<p>Just then, Rosha and Paul rushed to her from the palace. Rosha was pacing around, at a loss of what to do as she stood next to Viola. With a searing heart, Viola looked at her and then the children.</p>
<p>“Is Wendy also ill? Like these children…?”</p>
<p>Viola stumbled. Her sight went black and she couldn’t hear anything. She could only faintly hear Rosha’s screaming and the haste in Paul’s voice.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>That night, Viola had a dream. God returned to her in the dream.</p>
<p>When she got a hold of herself, she realized it was a dream and that she was being crushed underneath him. She couldn’t move her body. Even if she tried to refuse him, he held onto her and would not let go. She could not utter a word. He used his hands to grab her two arms. Lustian’s blood went to his head thinking about the idea of another man touching her. He twisted his lips.</p>
<p>“You can’t do anything. The more you try to hold on, your loved ones will be the ones to suffer… If you go back to your place, I will have everything return to normal.”</p>
<p>[No! I told you to wait!]</p>
<p>He understood the words that came from her heart. He caressed Viola’s face and touched her lips slightly.</p>
<p>“Do you want to test how deep that love is? I wonder if he’ll want you even when you’re gone. The most that love between humans will last is several years. Will he still love you even when your beautiful face grows old? No. Love is meant to shrivel up.”</p>
<p>[He waited for me for eight years without forgetting about me! He will wait for me even after eighty years.]</p>
<p>Viola flashed him a scary look. Just then, his eyes got bigger.</p>
<p>“Then, do you want to make a bet with me? If you win, you might change my mind.”</p>
<p>His lips touched her ear. He was only whispering, but it made her feel like bugs were crawling all over her body.</p>
<p>“I do not have the heart to forgive you two. Especially that bastard….”</p>
<p>[Who… are you?]</p>
<p>Viola suddenly stopped and listened to him with a vacant face. Her pupils trembled without focus.</p>
<p>“I thought you already knew. Are you pretending to not know? Hu hu….”</p>
<p>Then, the God that was pressing on Viola’s body vanished with the fog without a trace. She opened her eyes, feeling her pounding heart. Before she knew it, Lustian was there.</p>
<p>“Viola… It’s me, Lune….”</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was a dream. You can forget about it now.”</p>
