            <p><strong>Chapter 185 (End)</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Uhhhh, uhhhh, uhhh-! Urghhh-”</p>
<p>The clear sounds emerging from below served as a testimony to the wetness. From the tips of her toes, the pleasure rushed across her posterior without rest. Viola was not the only one feeling so. Lustian too looked caught up in the pleasure. His eyes were burning red with lust.</p>
<p>“Hah…. Urk…. Viola… Ack, I love you… I love you!”</p>
<p>“Lune… I love you…!”</p>
<p>Lustian moved his thighs rapidly and vigorously. He ravenously licked and nibbled every inch of her face. Their minds were enraptured by pleasure. The electrifying chills shot through their bodies as they joined as one. It was difficult to discern whose sweaty body was whose.</p>
<p>A tangled mess, Viola spread her legs and wrapped them around Lustian’s waist. His manhood went in and out of her hole. She screamed as her itch was scratched. Even her shadow cast in the flickering lights seemed attractive. A deluge of pleasure washed over them. Each time that happened, her back was twisted.</p>
<p>Their lips searched for each other in a frenzy. Anytime their lips left each other, they would crash into each other right after. The haggard breathing filled the garden.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>At the castle of the New World, as Lustian expected, Anne was with Arhil.</p>
<p>Anne tiredly lifted herself up. It was disastrous that she felt the kind of bodily pleasure she felt despite being in a forceful relationship with this man. She looked into the lake in despair.</p>
<p>Her greediness not only led to her losing her life but also ending up with a man she doesn’t want…</p>
<p>Tears of regret came streaming down her eyes. Just then the Goddess of Love came to her. She looked at Anne with pity, knowing that she had ended up as God’s Companion as she tried to change her fate.</p>
<p>“Though your actions are unforgivable, there is someone out there who wishes you happiness, so her prayers will be heard.”</p>
<p>The goddess cast a spell. Then surprisingly, all her memories of the human world disappeared.</p>
<p>Anne’s eyes went wide as she got up out of bed.</p>
<p>“You will fall in love with the first man you lay eyes on. Anne….”</p>
<p>That’s when it happened. Fresh out of the bath, Arhil entre Anne’s room only to be greeted with her glittering eyes. He was taken aback further when she ran straight into his embrace.</p>
<p>His lips twisted as he turned his head abruptly to the window. His face scrunched up as he could faintly feel the traces of the Goddess of Love. Even while he ruffled his own hair, he wasn’t averse to Anne’s affections.</p>
<p><em>You should love each other. That way, the world will look a bit more beautiful…</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Viola and Lustian weren’t the only ones to receive God’s blessings.</p>
<p>Guinev’s curse was lifted, and she finally regained her sight and memories. Her love for Lustian was included in those memories, but she genuinely wished them happiness.</p>
<p>That morning, Viola received another letter. It was from Guinev.</p>
<p><em>It seems more appropriate that I serve God rather than get married. Hence, I will go to the temple. For the Kingdom of Farus and Arpen Empire, I will pray my hardest.</em></p>
<p><em>I wish you happiness. I will write to you again.</em></p>
<p>She respected her decision to become a nun. If she was able to find her own happiness, in her own way, she was satisfied.</p>
<p>Viola looked up at the bright sky. Lustian came to her and hugged her from behind. He buried his face in her shoulder and asked her in a sweet voice, “Are you happy?”</p>
<p>“Of course I am.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about anyone else, and instead just look to us.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I intend to.”</p>
<p>Viola turned around and met his eyes. He was gazing at her lovingly, smiling brightly. The smile brought a smile to her face as well. <em>I intend to look at my marvelous man, my husband, this man who loves me with his soul.</em></p>
<p>“When our mortal souls are done with their journey, will I really earn the right to eternal life?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm… It’s hard to believe that I won’t age.”</p>
<p>“Appearances don’t matter. 200 years ago, your soul would’ve been pure no matter how old you were. My love would not have changed.”</p>
<p>“Liar.”</p>
<p>“Do you doubt my love?”</p>
<p>Lustian playfully blew on Viola’s neck, she laughed loudly.</p>
<p>“Ack, it’s tickling me.”</p>
<p>“Tell me. If you doubt my love, I can confirm it right now.”</p>
<p>“Ohhhh! Hold on. Lune! Ack!”</p>
<p>As he lifted her up and took her to the bedroom, an astonished Viola slapped his back. In the process of fooling around, it seemed that he had now taken this opportunity to seduce her once again.</p>
<p>They had just gotten out of bed after having 2 days of s*x, yet his lust was back again. As she was laid down on the bed, he climbed her body. His eyes made the lust painfully obvious, the heat was picking up.</p>
<p>“I give in! I surrender! I don’t doubt you!”</p>
<p>Viola screeched. Even so, he caught her tongue.</p>
<p>“…Mmmmm….”</p>
<p>The tangling of tongues was so powerful and hot that she lost all the strength in her body. He lightly touched the inside of her mouth with his tongue. The breathtaking kiss that spread all through her body was electrifying. Every time her body twisted around, Lustian gripped her waist with his sturdy arms and pushed his tongue deeper.</p>
<p>“Mmmm!”</p>
<p>“Hah, hah….”</p>
<p>The kissing wouldn’t stop. It just became deeper, and Viola could barely manage a breath out. As the tongue furrowed, her breathing was even more ragged. Her fingernails dug into his arms, as pleasure assailed her senses.</p>
<p>With one arm, he grabbed her two arms and spread them above her head. He frantically took off her clothes even as he kissed her fiercely. Viola lifted up her back to help him undress her. Without stopping, he continued to move his tongue and there was no hesitation as he took off her clothes.</p>
<p>It was hot. She couldn’t possibly hide that her honeypot was already soaked. As soon as her undergarments came off, love juices came squirting out. As his fingers went inside after wading through the golden bushes, she moaned softly. Ahhhh….</p>
<p>– I shall express my love for you through my body…</p>
<p>– Ahhh… Lune….</p>
<p>– I love you….</p>
