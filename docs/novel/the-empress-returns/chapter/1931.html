            <p><strong>Chapter 32 – The Crown Prince</strong></p>
<p>Nightfall.</p>
<p>Whether it was practice or the pressure of living under the enemy’s roof, Rosha’s makeup skills got better and better by the day. There could never have been an uglier woman in the world than the one in the mirror with blue eyes. She couldn’t help but admire the deft hands of her little maid and her nanny’s foresight for setting things up.</p>
<p>As Viola gazed at her ugliest ever, she let out a soft chuckle. The dreary dress draping her right now seemed even uglier than her face, thoroughly amusing her.</p>
<p>Soon, it was time to depart. Veiled, she walked out of her chambers and towards the waiting carriage. The final act was here. She spent the entire ride looking at the night sky lost deep in thoughts. There was only one thing filling her mind now- Crown Prince Lustian.</p>
<p><em>The enemy who killed her beloved brother Edward …</em></p>
<p>Her hatred for this crown prince ran deeper than her bones. As ruthless as the Arpen Imperial Clan was, this man seemed to be at the helm of it all. The master of the Blood Army, the wretched beasts that mercilessly slain her brother. As her thoughts surged within, her hands trembled. Not out of fear for Lustian, but because she was afraid that she would put a knife through his chest and stab him in the neck as soon as she saw him.</p>
<p><em>Don’t waver. Ever! … The moment you take his life, there will be another war. The village that Edward protected ‘til the end will be devastated. His death would be in vain. Please, Viola … Keep your hostility buried deep. Don’t forget that the Arpen Empire can become an enemy at any moment.</em></p>
<p>Viola bit her lip, closed her eyes fiercely shut to suppress the quivering rage within. As the rhythmic churning of wheels made its way to her ears, she willed herself to lull her tumultuous emotions. She was nearing the crown prince’s palace now, or that was what she thought …</p>
<p>Slowly, she opened her eyes and glimpsed the calm river cruising by. She was surprised. She had not been here for long but knew this river was situated right behind the crown prince’s palace. She knew not why they were bringing her here instead of the residence, but before she could ponder further the Lake of God came into view.</p>
<p>After a while, the carriage stopped and a servant opened the door.</p>
<p>“From here you must go alone. You see that over there?” The servant pointed yonder. “Prince Lustian is waiting for you there.”</p>
<p>Dark was the night, darker was the forest. Silence shrouded it all, even the sounds of the heartbeats were deemed a din. The moon reflecting on the surface of the river provided the lone light there was, accompanying the lonely Viola into the dense thicket of unknown.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, she gripped the sides of her dress and trudged forward in the direction the servant gestured. Not long after, a small mansion revealed itself. It seemed to have been abandoned, the towering weeds and gloomy facade standing in testimony. As she drew closer, the huge old bronze statue of God of Judith became clearer and clearer.</p>
<p><em>Was this the temple of the God of Judith?</em></p>
<p>As soon as Viola stepped forward, the lights turned on. She was stunned for a moment. Before she could get her bearings straight a long, red shadow came from within the mansion. It was only now that she noticed the two men standing in front of the mansion.</p>
<p>A long streak of light shone on Lune’s face before it disappeared, only leaving the ominously deep darkness behind … His beautiful face stood out even more than usual in the dark because he was dressed black today.</p>
<p>Then something stood up behind him and Lune opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Your Royal Highness, Prince Lustian.”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Viola hurriedly folded up her dress and bowed to greet him. She gulped.</p>
<p>A peal of laughter breached the silence.</p>
<p>As she heard the crown prince’s unbridled laughter, that seemed to shake the entire mansion, her hands clenched further and further. She was afraid she wouldn’t be able to endure any longer, that she would aim her knife at him right this instance. She bit the inside of her mouth and waited for his command.</p>
<p>“So you are the one Lune said that he fell in love with at first sight? Hahaha, he really has bad eyes.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>“Seems like I’ve just wasted my time. There’s no way I’d be happy to meet a crown princesses candidate without an ounce of appeal.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p><em>Success!</em></p>
<p>Seemingly, he could tell that she was ugly even with the veil on. Well, she did tighten her breasts to make them even flatter and inserted cotton into her dress to make her frame as large as a man, so it was understandable.</p>
<p>Viola wanted to dance in joy just as much as he laughed at her appearance. His ridicule was music to her ears. Turned out, she had been worried sick over nothing. But that thought was only in hindsight.</p>
<p>He trudged towards her. Viola was so surprised she forgot all etiquette and looked up. She was appalled the moment their eyes met.</p>
<p><em>This man … he is the one I saw at the concubine’s palace! He’s the crown prince? Did Anne lie to me?</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, his hands reached out, grabbed the veil, and threw it back. Instantly, Lune gripped the crown prince’s wrist as Viola’s blue eyes shook in shock. For a moment the air stilled, a deathly silence loomed. And then a shrill screech like something sharp grazed something, breached the stillness.</p>
<p>It came from the direction of the knights.</p>
