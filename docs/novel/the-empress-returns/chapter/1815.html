<p><strong>Chapter 91 – The Loser (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>“So, did you meet?” Lustian said.</p>
<p>“No.” Viola lied without batting an eye.</p>
<p>“I guess so. Even though she was there, she cannot go against God’s will.</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“Let me find some news from Guinev, wait a moment.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing. But is it necessary to summon the Blood Army just because a concubine is sneaking out?”</p>
<p>“There could be a problem, you know.”</p>
<p>As he gently revealed his teeth, a chill ran through her. Lustian snapped his finger at Kyle after he took a glimpse of Viola. Then, Kyle deployed the Blood Army to spread all over the place.</p>
<p>Viola’s palms were damp with sweat. Even though she tried to keep her composure, it was hard to get away from the murderous feeling while standing in front of the Blood Army.  Every time she faced the army with spears and swords that killed Edward, she wanted them to have the same fate as he.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, Viola looked at them with a murderousness in her eyes. “What is the problem… Even the army—”</p>
<p>“It seems there’s a rat in the imperial place. They’re looking for the spy.” Lustian camply replied.</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p><em><strong>Ba-dump!</strong></em></p>
<p>Viola’s heart fell. <em>Don’t tell me… Did he get caught? Did Paul attract suspicions?</em> She felt like her throat was burning. She tried to calm herself by exhaling little by little through her clenched teeth.</p>
<p>Lustian snuck up on her and picked a lock of her hair, bringing it to his nose. Even the small gestures made her thrilling body more resentful. When Lustian, sniffing her hair, opened his eyes, a pair of black eyes stared at Viola intently.</p>
<p>“All of this time, I think I’ve been loosening up because I was drunk on this scent. I have fallen for you to the point where rumours have spread that the emperor is not in the palace. Until the point that there are disobedient people right under my nose.”</p>
<p>“Huk—”</p>
<p>He grabbed her by the waist. His hand travelled down from the back of her waist to the thighs. Viola became extremely nervous. His hands settled on the clothes on her inner thighs. There was a dagger strapped on her thigh where he touched.</p>
<p>“If I catch a rat, I don’t let it go. I am a very possessive man, you know. I won’t let anyone who wants mine be alive.”</p>
<p>“Cruel temper like an emperor. Was everything that I saw in Lune all of this time a lie?” Viola said.</p>
<p>“Well…I also don’t know. Even I… I just realized for the first time that I can be such a considerate man.”</p>
<p>“If it is so, please keep being a man like Lune,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“What will you give me if I do that?”</p>
<p>His lips brushed onto her earlobe. When he stuck out his tongue and licked a small part of her skin, her whole body trembled as shiver ran down her spine.</p>
<p>“Please keep in mind that I can be Lune or Lustian depending on how you behave.” Warm breath touched her ear as his tongue swept deeper. Her shoulders shrank.</p>
<p>Viola was utterly worried over Paul. <em>What if the Blood Army catched him? I don’t even know what to do.</em> Thinking back to how Edward was killed with a bamboo spear struck into him, she was really scared for Paul.</p>
<p>Although it was actually not hard to tame a possessive crown prince… Sweet words, gentle gestures, if it could quell the burning desire of possessiveness…</p>
<p>Viola faintly bit her lips and raised her hands to touch Lustian’s cheeks. His eyelids trembled from her touch.</p>
<p>“I like Lune better than the Crown Prince of the Blood Army. Please remain as Lune whenever you are with me.” Blood boiled within her but Paul’s safety was more important than her pride being destroyed. Strangely enough, Viola always thought nice words would never come out of her even if she died, however, it came out more easily than she had thought.</p>
<p>“I want you. Here, right now—”</p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes widened. Surprised, both eyes trembling incessantly, he pulled her into an embrace. Then, he put her on his horse and rode to the Lake of God.</p>
<p>The two people arrived at the temple at Lake of God. The closest place to have s*x was the temple anyway. He covered her lips with a kiss and began to take off his clothes like a mad man.</p>
<p>Viola began to spread her legs.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>“Ahh… Hmm…!”</p>
<p>He bounced on his waist – the pleasure growing more intense as he dug deeper into her inner wall. The hair on the back of her neck began to stand on end. She could even hear the wetness below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Smack, smack, smack…</strong></em></p>
<p>That place where they were joined was drenched in their bodily fluids. Stimulated by the obscene sounds, her face changed, dying into deep shades of red by the moment.</p>
<p>“Aah..”</p>
<p>“Ughh… ughh—”</p>
<p>He was on a rampage, thrusting in and out deeply. His manhood scratched her tight hole intensely. He licked her peaks and caressed her neck with his tongue. Viola was clenching so hard on him, her waist trembling, as he stroked his length inside of her tenaciously stimulating her sweet spot. She could feel it go very deep into her inner wall. A white flame burst inside her mind. The thick stick poked its way countless times without hesitation. She felt like she was running out of breath with his thick muscles piercing deeply. Nevertheless, she convulsed as the height of pleasure engulfed her.</p>
<p>“A…a…ahhh… Uh, Ha ah—”</p>
<p>Lustian kissed roughly while squishing her bre*st. With unbearable pleasure, Viola breathed sharply and hastily wrapped her arms around his shoulders. His solid arms grabbed her thin waist, she trembled. Both soreness and pleasure that penetrated the body took over one after another. She tightened.</p>
<p><em><strong>Smack, smack, smack…</strong></em></p>
<p>He pushed his waist hard through the wide-open hole. As the flesh slapped flesh, the wet noises filled the air… There wasn’t just one thing that wasn’t stimulating; even the slight rubbing of skin against p*bic hair was enough to electrify her senses.</p></div>
