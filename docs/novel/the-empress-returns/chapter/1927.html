            <p><strong>Chapter 36 – A Different Pleasure (2)</strong></p>
<p>The night burned. She couldn’t tell how long they had done it; she had lost track. However, they were still connected, and he was still moving. The s*x was taxing, but his body and the foreign pleasure he incited within her was enticing.</p>
<p>Viola cried out, this time in rapture that was commingled with pain. Everything seemed hazy before her, his charm even more bewitching. He looked at her tenderly, a stark contrast to his rough, desperate thrusts. The mo*ns of ecstasy escaping them was accompanied by a wet noise of their bodies entwined together. Their body fluids mingled, she felt suffocated from the erotic aroma. Her back arched every time he pounded down hard, joining their bodies into two and grinding against her sensitive nub. His mouth didn’t even spare her, taking her mounds captive in his hot tongue.</p>
<p>As he completely engulfed her senses, she was reduced to a mess of frenzied pleasure when she climaxed.</p>
<p>“Uhh-!! Ugh!”</p>
<p>He kissed her. Viola reflexively pulled back to breathe, but his tongue followed and caught hers. He tugged and lightly gnawed at her tongue. His passionate eyes and frenzied kiss filled her with fear rather than arousal.</p>
<p><em>He has an extremely strong Qi, he might not be an ordinary swordsman. Is he a Master?</em></p>
<p>There were only a few masters in the entire continent, they had the ability to handle a sword as well as their own limb. They could also hide their fighting power and throw their opponents into confusion. Edward had also excelled in swordsmanship and reached the master level, giving off a queer aura. She sensed the same aura from Lune. He didn’t realise he was leaking out his true <em>Qi</em> as he was lost in the pleasure of the moment.</p>
<p><em>Of course, his skills must be extraordinary, being the Commander of the Imperial Knights. But I have never seen a Qi like this before.</em></p>
<p>Viola was confused and stunned as the flowing <em>Qi </em>touched her skin. Her body stiffened. He stopped for a moment and gently swept back her wet hair and kissed her again. Her tense muscles melted away and relaxed as their tongues met.</p>
<p>“Mhmmm—” She mo@ned in pleasure.</p>
<p>His tongue slipped out for a moment, but as she tried to catch her breath, he kissed her again. His shoulder was puckered with several marks already. The bath water splashed out as they moved. The red petals were strewn on the floor. They continued, entwined, wrapped in a carnal desire in each other’s embrace, as she gasped for breath. It seemed there was no end to this night.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The next day she woke up inside the imperial villa. She had no recollection of how she got here from the temple. She remembered Lune carrying her in his arms, but she was too exhausted to recall anything properly. Her whole body ached. It had never hurt this bad, even during the days when she practiced swordsmanship. She let out a groan as she realised that everything hurt when she moved even a little.</p>
<p>“Rosha,” she called.</p>
<p>Rosha hurriedly approached her, tears of worry suffused her eyes. “How are you? I was so worried!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“How did I get here?” Viola asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. You just popped out of the living room wall.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Rosha pointed towards a wall. No matter how she looked at it, it seemed like an ordinary wall. <em>How did she come out of there?</em></p>
<p>“I think this is a special room. It’s weird that it stays so clean without anyone cleaning it,” Rosha remarked.</p>
<p>“Really?” Viola was even more confused now.</p>
<p>“Yes, I haven’t seen a maid coming in to clean. I was at the door waiting all morning for you, Princess. I don’t know how you got in. I looked everywhere for emergency exits and there were none,” Rosha said.</p>
<p>“It’s magic!” Viola declared.</p>
<p>“What?! Magic?!” Rosha couldn’t believe her ears.</p>
<p>“Yes. Since there are secret passages in the imperial villa already, magic must be plausible as well.” She couldn’t think of anything right now. She abandoned all thoughts and flopped back down onto the bed.</p>
<p>“Take some medicine. She told me to give you medicine when you woke up,” Rosha said.</p>
<p>“Muscular pain gets better off with rest,” Viola said.</p>
<p>“But … you look too ….” Rosha’s face turned red.</p>
<p>Looking at her reaction, an addled Viola asked Rosha for a mirror. She was surprised by the reflection.</p>
<p>“What … what is all this?” she exclaimed, embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Lord Lune must be very good. He must be really in love with you, Princess … to have caressed you like this.”</p>
<p>Her lips were swollen from all his sucking. A red mark bloomed below her neck like a flower trail. It was reminiscent of the Judith Flower Garden near the Lake of God.</p>
<p>Viola clicked her tongue. She didn’t remember him leaving that mark. “Ah … How am I going to go train looking like this?”</p>
<p>“The head maid told you to rest for a while. She said the teacher won’t come any more.”</p>
<p>“—huh?”</p>
<p>“She said that you don’t need training anymore—” Rosha specified.</p>
<p>She sighed. She supposed that the news about her getting rejected by the crown prince had long traversed through the empire. Nothing could be done now. Besides, she became Lune’s wife yesterday. It couldn’t stay hidden like she had hoped.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath. She had a lot of time on her hands now since she didn’t have to take the Crown Princess Candidate Training anymore. She would use the time wisely to secretly investigate the fate of Guinev.</p>
<p>Rosha looked around and whispered in Viola’s ear: “Princess, I heard news that Lord Paul has entered the Arpen Empire.</p>
