            <p><strong>Chapter 100 – A  Trust Broken (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Viola got to ride the golden coach that Lustian was in.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t a hostage situation be enough to finish this?”</p>
<p>“Do you really think you could take on the role of a hostage? You should already know that the King of Koronis wouldn’t dwell on your life. In order to make sure he doesn’t challenge us, that child needs to be held hostage.”</p>
<p>“But even so….”</p>
<p>Lustian sat Viola beside himself and embraced her from behind her back.</p>
<p>“Keep in mind that just because you’re now the empress doesn’t mean that the Kingdom of Koronis is to be forgiven. You’ve become completely separated from the kingdom you once lived in. Don’t worry about your kingdom any longer.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t say anything else. Suddenly, a tongue was shoved in her mouth. Then, he fastened onto the root of the tongue and started sucking on it like mad. He edged his way through Viola’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Mmmm… Ugh!”</p>
<p>Because of the rigorous manner in which he was shoving his way through her mouth, Viola did not have the chance to push his chest. It was clear that she was out of her mind. She was boiling so much she almost felt like her brain was melting, and she came undone. Between colliding lips were the continuous sounds of wet kisses. <em>To kiss as soon as we got on the coach….</em></p>
<p>Viola twisted her lips. But right then, her chin was caught right away and their lips overlapped.</p>
<p>Without a chance to catch air, her breathing became rougher while their tongues intertwined. As they kissed, she couldn’t breathe. It was hot. Her body couldn’t escape the heat, and shortly her mind was filled with ecstasy.</p>
<p>“Mmmm….”</p>
<p>Unable to think straight because of the kiss, suddenly there was a light that enveloped the entirety of the coach. It didn’t take long to realize that the coach was being lifted up on the magic square. There was no telling the amount of magicians that were rallying to achieve the feat, but at the place where the coach stopped, there were several exhausted magicians.</p>
<p>The magic square that they teleported to was located in the Kingdom of Farus, which was near the Arpen Empire. Even if it was magic, it was said that the magic square was drawn all the way to the Kingdom of Farus because they couldn’t transport all of those people at once.</p>
<p>Around the magic square, several barracks were built in preparation for the arrival of the imperial couple. Considering the number of flags of Farus that were stuck in the ground from place to place, it was apparent that the kingdom prepared something special to welcome the emperor</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Viola looked at the completely nude Lustian. She knew that his desires would not be filled from just one time. He unbuttoned her dress in a rush, his hands were moving hastily.</p>
<p>“I’ll take it off.”</p>
<p>“Leave it be. I want to do it.”</p>
<p>In no time, Viola was stark-naked in front of him. Soon after, her back touched a soft bed. As soon as his lips met hers, she opened her mouth and took his tongue in. He must’ve been turned on for quite some time now because his rod was hard and upright. She took in a sharp breath as a warm piece of flesh entered her wet core.</p>
<p>As the second time is always easier, his member, drenched in c*m, went in and out with all its might. Sweet moans escaped her lips. As his hips started moving roughly, a coquettish noise rushed out.</p>
<p>“Ahhh! Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>The quivering flames rode along her spine, and blood rapidly flowed to her lower area.</p>
<p>Lustian buried his nose in her nape and breathed in sharply. Digging deep into her back as he thrust, a much too fast peak was on the way. During the entire act, he showered her with sparse kisses every time he saw her face.</p>
<p>Viola was caught up in a deeply satisfying feeling that was beyond words. She gripped onto his hair with both hands. Her body shook frantically with intense pleasure.</p>
<p>After Lustian indulged in her lips, he pushed his tongue through the small gap. Their breaths blended between interlocked lips. With the heated and rough breathing, his movements grew more intense. His body was moving aggressively like an angry beast.</p>
<p>“The night is long. Hold on tight.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>For a while, she had always woken up with a headache due to a lack of deep sleep. But today, she felt refreshed. Unlike the other nights where she woke up at the slightest noise, she slept soundly this time.</p>
<p><em>Is it because we’re now free from the anxiousness of being caught at any time? If not that, is it because we admitted that there’s nowhere to run?</em></p>
<p><em>‘Was everyone safe at night?’</em></p>
<p>She was worried sick about Paul’s wounds, Rosha, and young Wendy. She wanted to check up on their condition immediately, but it was important that she was wary of Lustian’s mood.</p>
<p>Viola looked at Lustian softly. The blissful fluttery feeling was echoing heavily from below. His heart was beating as one with hers. Dizziness aside, a part of her was happy about her reunion with him.</p>
<p><em>That’s right. He is the man I missed dearly….</em></p>
<p>Viola felt it was cruel that she could neither reveal her true feelings eight years ago nor now.</p>
<p>He must’ve sensed that she woke up because he also opened his eyes slightly. His face looked tired and ragged.</p>
<p><em>Could I be… mistaken that for some reason it looks like he didn’t get a wink of sleep?</em></p>
<p>“I should get up now.”</p>
<p>As he tried to get up, he spun around and got on top of her body. She was taken aback. There was a bitter glare in his eyes. His hands clasped together were faintly shaking. At the same time, she could hear gloom from his voice.</p>
<p>“It seems like I can’t trust you ever since I’ve been betrayed. Do not move unless I tell you to.” “You say that even while knowing I can’t escape.”</p>
<p>“You’re well aware. If you repeat what you did… If you betray my trust, it will be very painful for you. I will find out everything you hold dear and destroy them right in front of your eyes.”</p>
