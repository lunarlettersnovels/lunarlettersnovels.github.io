            <p><strong>Chapter 35 – A Different Pleasure (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p>“Ah—”</p>
<p>He placed his lips on her peaks while fingering her n*pples. His gentle f0ndling made her giddy, she shivered. He kissed her suppleness and s*cked on them gently while stroking the other one with his hands. It felt like she was going to lose herself. She tried to back away from his arms, but he held her close, pressed to him. She shook her head violently but her face turned crimson, heat filled her body.</p>
<p>“Viola … Viola—” He called her name raggedly.</p>
<p>Hearing her name from his lips drove her crazy. His deep, hoarse voice seemed to suck away her soul along with her thinking capabilities. Nevertheless, she stilled her mind and looked at him coldly. He had a bitter smile on his lips.</p>
<p>“You will come to love me, Viola,” he said.</p>
<p>“Don’t make me laugh. The day I love you will be the day I die, maybe not even then.” She proclaimed resolutely.</p>
<p>Although she had given her body to the enemy knight, she would never allow her heart to go with it. There was no way in seven hells she would love him when his sword, his empire’s sword was tainted with Edward’s blood.</p>
<p>Viola’s body stiffened, she dug her nails on his forearms. She was completely n@ked, str!pped by his deft touch. Her whole body seemed to accept his touch, even give in to his caresses. Sweat poured down her skin and heat bloomed inside her. Her skin shivered and her eyes reddened. She couldn’t form a coherent thought as he parted her legs and touched her between her th!ghs. She gasped and her vision darkened. The place between her th!ghs seemed to have been waiting for this moment and as soon as he opened her tightly closed clams with his fingers, she let out a harsh breath.</p>
<p>“Ahhh—”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. I’ll be gentle.”</p>
<p><em>Lies, you can’t be gentle even if you tried.</em></p>
<p>His voice sounded like a beast’s cry. A cry so raw that it came unbidden from the back of his throat. He was gasping for breath and looking at her with eyes full of crude l*st. “You are all wet for me. I think it is time,” he said hoarsely.</p>
<p>She tried to steady herself by taking deep breaths but she still felt out of breath. He rubbed her on her most int!m@te part and got ready to enter her. She felt that her heart would burst with the sheer pounding of it. She felt something big at her opening, seeking entry.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh,” she cried.</p>
<p>Her body was not hers, anymore. It filled with heat and wetness every time he touched her. Lune tilted her chin upwards and placed a light kiss on her lips. “I am going to enter.”</p>
<p>He lifted her up and placed her between his thighs. Viola was startled. “It will be easier for you here in the bath,” he said, “besides, I might go crazy if I take you to bed.”</p>
<p>“Crazy? What do you … ahhhh-ahhhhh—” She had barely gotten the words out when a hot rod penetrated her. A searing pain accompanied it, like her skin was being torn apart. The pain was so jarring she wriggled, Lune stopped.</p>
<p>“Relax. Breathe. It will hurt a bit. Leave it to me,” he said.</p>
<p>His beautiful face looked at hers, hair drenched with sweat. He penetrated her again. Her body convulsed with spasms, he pushed in harder.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!” She screamed, pain blinding her to everything. She gasped for air. She felt something strange that accompanied the pain. He was so full within her that she thought she would burst. “It … it hurts,” she cried.</p>
<p>“Huff … tighten your legs. It will feel good, I promise,” he said.</p>
<p>Viola huffed. Her thighs were so stiff. She felt like a red-hot rod had split her body in two. “It hurts … Could you take it out?” she pleaded.</p>
<p>“Hold onto my shoulder. Bite it if you have to. It won’t last long,” he reassured her.</p>
<p>Before she could protest, he pumped his waist and pounded into her. Her back arched in reply, eyeballs flipping up to the ceiling. He was panting now, as he kept a steady pace within her. With every thr*st inside her, she could feel him slightly tremble, stilling inside her, before the hot mass slithered back out. Inside, out. Viola was so overwhelmed with pain that she thought her eyes would pop out of her head. Even so, Lune never stopped. He grabbed her h!ps and pulled her closer to him as he kept going. Something tore below and Viola sobbed in pain.</p>
<p>“Ahhh! It hurts….”</p>
<p>Viola couldn’t think of anything beyond the pain. She didn’t know how people enjoyed this. It made no sense.</p>
<p>Lune, mistaking her silence for acceptance, began explaining: “The first time, it always hurts. It will get better … hahh … huff.”</p>
<p>But she, being inexperienced, could only scream. So, all he heard was her pain, but he kept moving. Patiently, slowly. He kept thrusting until a while later, he hit a spot and earned a gasp of pleasure from the woman below her.</p>
<p>Viola couldn’t believe the sound had come from her. Her face reddened, and she blushed. Meanwhile, Lune’s gaze had turned bright, a languid smile was on his mouth.</p>
<p>“Did you like that?” His low voice sounded pleasant in her ears. She made no reply to his query. The truth was stark as day — it was a pleasure Viola had never known before. She tried to look away, but Lune held her chin firmly, and turned her to face him.</p>
<p>“Look only at me. Don’t think about anything else.”</p>
