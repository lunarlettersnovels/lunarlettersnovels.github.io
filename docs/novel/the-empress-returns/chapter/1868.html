<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p><em>Kingdom of Camelon, why would he use that name all of a sudden?</em> Viola tried to think of the man she met on that day.</p>
<p><em>Who was that? Who was he to do such a thing? Why would he send me this message? I suppose I’ll find out… Yes…</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The sky was dark when she woke up. Viola and Paul moved discreetly. She had put on a disguise in case her father sent someone after her.</p>
<p>Paul hurdled over the terrace, climbed down the tree, and mounted the horse that he prepared in advance. Viola was headed for the forest where she gave birth to Wendy who spent her childhood there eight years ago.</p>
<p>Thinking further back, she remembered the hill where she met the man. She pulled on the harness. Soon after, she saw a man waiting on top of the hill. Before she got off the horse, the man knelt in front of her and looked at her.</p>
<p>“It feels like a dream to see you again. I apologize for the late greeting. I am Sir Ken from the ancient Kingdom of Camelon .”</p>
<p>“Ken… Why have you sent for me?”</p>
<p>“If your mother hadn’t passed away like that, she would’ve become queen of our kingdom. The Kingdom of Camelon runs in your blood. The reason why she passed was because she attempted to revive the kingdom and failed.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was silence. Viola felt like her body went rigid.</p>
<p><em>‘Kingdom of Camelon? That kingdom was Mother’s?’</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t believe it. All this time, she thought that her identity was tied to slavery, but it turned out that she actually had a precious lineage.</p>
<p><em><strong>The virgin will be reincarnated in the form of a woman with the most precious lineage in the world.</strong></em></p>
<p>In that case…</p>
<p><em>As legends have foretold, I was born as God’s Companion from the beginning. </em>Viola was so shocked that she wrapped her own arms around herself.</p>
<p><em>Just as she was about to revive the extinct kingdom, she was caught by Father and… the horse of fire…!</em></p>
<p>Veins were showing through the corners of her eyes. Tears came streaming down her eyes. The fate of a woman who was forcibly sold to a man she didn’t want and had to bear a child was much too pitiful.</p>
<p>“I lost faith in the King of Koronis. Married to the princess who was the only heir, he swallowed the Kingdom of Camelon whole and acted like the two kingdoms were unified. In actuality, he garnished their wealth, turned the princess into a slave, and took away half of the identity of her children.”</p>
<p>“…Ah….”</p>
<p>It seemed like tears of blood gushed out of Ken’s eyes. He cried out in agony.</p>
<p>“Even so, I assumed that someday Prince Edward would be the heir, but that was also a lie. To make matters worse, that man was the one who forced Prince Edward into the battlefield.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Father… How could he… do that to his own son…!”</p>
<p>“His own children are of no importance to that bastard. He only cares about preserving his throne.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Viola bit her lip hard. She could not handle the fact that all of this started from her father’s schemes. <em>No matter how he feels about his children, how could he do that to his own bloodline?</em></p>
<p>“Though I was a living witness for when the agreement was signed at the time, I could only achieve freedom when I pledged allegiance to the King of Koronis. Fifteen years ago, I was caught trying to meet the two of them. That was when I died. Although the terrible torture killed me, I am now able to stand in front of you, alive.”</p>
<p>“…To think that the real threat was in front of us all this time.”</p>
<p>“He is a conniving bastard. Not only did he manipulate his own child, but he is the kind of emperor that plans to swallow the entire continent whole. Even now, he is coming after me, knowing that I came back to life.”</p>
<p>“I could gather that from how he’s waiting for the Arpen Empire to collapse in on itself. To think that such a person is my father….”</p>
<p>There was an endless stream of tears.</p>
<p>“After betraying the kingdom 20 years ago, the noblemen that surrendered lived their whole lives with a heavy burden on their chest. The royal family of the kingdom was constantly irritated by the fact that the tragedy was glossed over. Just then, as soon as you became Empress, we gained courage. We decided that we’d step forward and fight whenever you needed us. Until now, we’ve wanted to lay down our burden by returning the wealth we’ve accumulated from the Kingdom of Koronis to the previous royal family.”</p>
<p>“In that case….”</p>
<p>“We know full well the reason why you’ve come all this way. If you say the word, we will bring out our soldiers.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Even amidst the breakdown of the first compromise, there was surely an unexpected righteous person that arrived. However, the reason why she was hesitant to accept his words right away was because if they helped her, it would seem like she was committing treason against her father. Viola took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, she noticed that the moon was above her head. Viola turned around quickly. Out of the darkness came a man. The beautiful man wearing the crown and livery of an emperor had a twisted expression. He had a sharp aura that made it seem like he would go out to war at any moment.</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if he’s your father. I cannot forgive him, Viola. For your mother, Edward, and your sake, I would never….”</p>
<p>Lustian made a crunching sound. The sound of him grinding his teeth echoed throughout the forest.</p>
<p>“Calm down. You are interfering.”</p>
<p>“You have no idea how much I have been brooding over this. How much guilt and agony I had over the fact that my army stomped all over his dignity….”</p>
<p>“…Lune….”</p>
