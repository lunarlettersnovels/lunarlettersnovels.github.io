            <p><strong>Chapter 95 – Runaway (1)</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Viola wiped away her sweat, put her shoes back on, and went deeper into the forest. After a while, she saw a stream ahead of her. Taking off her shoes, she dipped her feet in the water. A song started to flow out of her lips.</p>
<p>It was a love song from [The God of Judith] that was passed down from generation to generation.</p>
<p><em>♫A god and a beautiful woman, by chance, met by the River Judith —</em></p>
<p><em>They fell in love with each other like it were a tryst of fate-</em></p>
<p><em>Breaking all taboos, they showered their love on one another.</em></p>
<p><em>But the time humans have is limited, their life measured …</em></p>
<p><em>The woman’s youthful body turned ill and grew old.</em></p>
<p><em>The soft, silken hair started to wither away, the supple skin laced with wrinkles.</em></p>
<p><em>The god abandoned the once young beauty as she grew old and frail.</em></p>
<p><em>All her youth was devoted to the god,</em></p>
<p><em>Alas, all that she was returned was betrayal and the blame for violating taboos.</em></p>
<p><em>Pitiful woman!</em></p>
<p><em>Foolish woman!</em></p>
<p><em>To love a god, was your first mistake!</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, but the woman awaited the god unto her last breath.</em></p>
<p><em>She waited at the place they met … ‘til she turned into a flower.</em></p>
<p><em>After a long time, the god finally came to realize</em></p>
<p><em>She was the only one that he ever loved…♫</em></p>
<p>Her lips paused, unable to finish the song. She shook her head harshly as all of those useless emotions came surging forth. They were but a distant dream. The steamy nights and even the kisses they shared every morning were but a mere dream.</p>
<p>Viola’s heart became heavy, feeling as though the memories of that night were, if anything, even vivider than just the day before.</p>
<p><em>A feeling I never felt before. There was never a time I yearned for someone, thought of someone so constantly… </em>The memories shared with him were too salient. Even at this moment, Lustian’s gentle voice was circling in her mind.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘You will love me. Love me. Viola… I want you…’</strong></em></p>
<p>Not a single day went by without Lustian’s voice echoing inside her mind. No matter how much she covered her ears, she was in agony over his voice.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘I will find you. I will make sure to find you and have you pay the price for betraying my love! I will!’</strong></em></p>
<p>The night before, she saw him in her dreams. Lustian was covered with blood. It was horrifying.</p>
<p>Viola was watching his blood-stained body in desperation. Underneath his feet were hundreds and thousands of dead bodies. The templar flag was burning up in between the bodies. The sight of him stepping up on top of the dead bodies as he was holding the ashen flag… was no different from the devil. But even so, she could not take her eyes off of his beauty…. It caused pain in her chest.</p>
<p>It was the year that Viola left him. The Slovenia Continent was wrapped in a war. The side that started the war was a federation formed from a military confederacy. Small kingdoms swooped in on the Arpen Empire after forming an alliance. This was the catalyst for a massive war.</p>
<p>“This is all I can do.”</p>
<p><em><strong>‘Viola! You must stand at the forefront! Where do you think you’re going! Viola! Viola!’</strong></em></p>
<p>The King of Koronis, intending to assassinate Lustian for treason, told Viola to lead the way. He told her to compete, shoulder to shoulder, with the Crown Prince of Farus who stood at the forefront of his own army. However, Viola rejected the king’s suggestion. As a result, she was unseated from the throne. More accurately, Viola was the one to practically renounce it.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to point swords at him and fight. She didn’t want to become the enemy.</p>
<p>From then on, Lustian turned into a tyrant. As soon as he became Emperor, he started a bloodbath by putting his Blood Army to the fore. Not wanting to look at the disastrous sight, she had fled recklessly. Running from her motherland and crossing foreign land, she hid deep inside a forest.</p>
<p>She drew a deep sigh. The more she did everything to stop thinking of him, the more deeply he was nailed to her mind.</p>
<p>After looking far into the sky, Viola touched her own cheek in a sweeping motion.</p>
<p>Then, she focused on the sounds of nature. The sounds of the wind sweeping across the grass and the crying of the grass bugs calmed her agitated mind. As she stared blankly at the flowing water under her feet, her mind was more at peace.</p>
<p>Right then, she heard a commotion.</p>
<p>“Princess, you’re here.” Paul glanced at the surroundings. “You’re here  again?”</p>
