            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 76 – Aphrodisiac (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>He grabbed her feet and placed them on his shoulders, changing her position. His member was inserted deeper than normal. S*xual fluid flowed out of her. The sensation that was transmitted through the deep insertion made her insides heat up. She was drowning in pleasure.</p>
<p>“Does it feel good? Say it feels good.”</p>
<p>“Agh… aah….”</p>
<p>Viola’s mind was emptied by the level of stimulating sensations she was feeling, and her head automatically nodded.</p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes narrowed in satisfaction. His beautiful black hair was sweaty and sensual.</p>
<p>Her vision shook once more. Viola gasped and leaned her head back. Her throbbing cave squeezed as if trying to swallow his huge manhood. Then, his lips gently settled upon hers.</p>
<p>At her lower-half, he thrust his hips roughly into her and poured out a honey-sweet kiss onto her lips above. Their two hearts beat quickly in tandem with one another.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>A maid walked in carefully into the empress’s bedroom. The Empress’s expression twisted into a frown. Her head didn’t hurt this morning, so she had felt fine, but when she saw her maid, her bad mood returned. This maid was a spy of sorts that she had planted at the Concubines’ Palace, so she usually didn’t come in person unless she had something special to report. It annoyed the empress.</p>
<p>“Yesterday, His Highness the Crown Prince ruined the imperials’ party.”</p>
<p>“Ruined? Why?”</p>
<p>The empress was full of resentment towards foreign royalty. This was why she allowed the secret parties of the imperial family. She even allowed them to pick up and reuse the women Lustian had used once and discarded. No, in truth she had absolutely no interest in how they chose to play with the imperial hostages. Rather, the more they obsessed over pleasure, the better she felt. But the fact that the crown prince ruined their party…</p>
<p>“Did that ugly girl cause a problem?”</p>
<p>“Unexpectedly, His Highness the Crown Prince crashed the party and broke the third prince’s fingers.”</p>
<p>“What? Break his fingers? Why?”</p>
<p>The empress was startled. Though the crown prince fought more valiantly than anyone else when confronting his enemy with a sword, he was not easily angered. And he was on good enough terms with his brothers that he would give his own concubines away to them freely. They weren’t competing for the crown, so he usually let it slide even if they acted out.</p>
<p>It was unusual for him to lay a hand on his own family. It was a huge surprise.</p>
<p>The maid haltingly spoke, “Well, it… It was because he touched Princess Viola’s face—”</p>
<p>The empress picked up a trinket next to her and threw it at the wall.</p>
<p><em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em></p>
<p>Her hands trembled.</p>
<p>“He’s doing things he wouldn’t normally do… Is it really just out of simple curiosity? Watch them closely. Report back to me about how the crown prince treats the girl… Don’t leave out anything.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">♛</p>
<p>Once Lustian had left the Concubines’ Palace, Viola found Rosha. The little maid looked haggard.</p>
<p>“Take me to Paul.”</p>
<p>“But, that’s not somewhere you should be going.”</p>
<p>“Paul was hurt because of me. I have to see him.”</p>
<p>“No. I’ll go. You wait here.” Rosha stopped Viola from going to the servants’ quarters and went to the knight herself.</p>
<p>As she waited for Paul to come, Viola prepared the medicines. It was the medicine the king had given her just in case. She didn’t have an expensive healing stone, but fortunately, she had medicine made from powder.</p>
<p>Before long, Rosha and Paul entered her room.</p>
<p>“Draw all the curtains,” Viola instructed.</p>
<p>Rosha lowered all the curtains in the room. It was dark, but it wasn’t difficult to see the wounds because there was a small lamp.</p>
<p>“Take off your shirt. I’m going to apply medicine.”</p>
<p>“Princess!”</p>
<p>“If you get hurt, it’s the same as Edward getting hurt. If you want me to have peace of mind, take off your shirt and show me your back.”</p>
<p>“All right.” Paul acquiesced.</p>
<p>Rosha quickly stepped out of the room. She would guard the door so that no one would enter. Paul took off his shirt and showed his back to Viola.</p>
<p>Tears filled her eyes when she saw his back completely wrapped in cloth bandages. Her vision blurred, but she stubbornly held them back. She pulled off the bandages only to encounter an even worse sight. His wide back was very bloody.</p>
<p>Viola soaked a clean cloth in water, squeezed it, and wiped his back with it. His shoulders twitched.</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t for you being a knight, you wouldn’t have been able to stand up for days.” Viola broke the silence.</p>
<p>“This kind of wound is nothing. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“<em>I. Am.</em> Not fine. If it hurts, say it hurts.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>When she had finished washing his back and started applying the medicine, his back flinched. It was clear that he was in pain but holding it in.</p>
<p>“The medicine will have an effect soon. Since it wasn’t a blade, no scars will remain, at least.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>Viola carefully spread the medicine on his wounds. Then, after wrapping on new cloth bandages, she had him put his shirt back on. It seemed that the medicine was already taking effect, as Paul rotated his shoulders once, then laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>“I received word that the king’s secret orders will be arriving soon. This afternoon, I’ve arranged to meet with the deliverer at the inn.”</p>
<p>“I wonder what orders my father is going to give now….”</p>
<p>“My apologies Princess, but I’ve reported this situation to the king.”</p>
<p>“What?! Paul, you went against my orders?!”</p>
<p>“Your Highness….”</p>
<p>Paul grabbed Viola’s hand and made eye contact. His sad eyes were moist with tears.</p>
<p>“I am completely loyal to you, Princess, but my loyalty is aimed at your well-being and your path to becoming King. Since I was not able to protect Prince Edward at his side, protecting you so that you can achieve your goals is also my goal in life. If you wish for me to be able to shake off even just a little bit of my guilt for not protecting the prince by his side, please understand that it is not disloyalty to stop a judgment call from you that was made in error.”</p>
<p>Paul’s loyalty to Edward had been passed on to Viola. She couldn’t blame him for breaking her orders and letting the king know about this.</p>
<p><em>It was going to be revealed eventually, anyhow. It doesn’t matter now.</em></p>
