            <p><strong>Chapter 130</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>When he nibbled on her ear, she burst out laughing.</p>
<p>The two of them were young at the time. Viola was 17 when she had her coming-of-age ceremony and he was only 22. Since neither of them had any experience being in love with someone, they had difficulty expressing how they felt. However, this was no longer the case. At an age in their lives when they were at the height of passion, they did not hesitate.</p>
<p>“Wait… Let’s talk about something else.”</p>
<p>“About what….”</p>
<p>As his lips traced further down the nape of her neck, a sweet breath burst out of her lips. When his hands slipped inside her dress, her body writhed slightly.</p>
<p>“How did you do it? It must not have been easy to persuade Paul.”</p>
<p>“Simply put, I told him he would be getting a lot of money and an official title if he came under my command.”</p>
<p>“Paul is not the kind of knight after money or power, so saying such a thing wouldn’t be doing him justice.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mind other men. You just need to have eyes for me. And from now on, we just need to make a plan for how we would rule over the Arpen Empire.”</p>
<p>“Before that, there is too much work to be done.”</p>
<p>They wanted everlasting peace for the Slovenia Continent. Viola’s goal was a land without wars and a path that would create everyone’s happiness. Furthermore, she would actively participate in helping him find God’s Companion. She was only good for alleviating his illness.</p>
<p>Then it happened. Amidst the commotion outside, Kyle came rushing inside.</p>
<p>“Your Highness. My apologies, but I had to come see you because of an emergency.”</p>
<p>Viola looked like she felt it was a shame, but she had to let him go.</p>
<p>“You should go. Sir Kyle, how urgent does it have to be for you to come like this?”</p>
<p>“I’ll only be a minute, so just wait. Ah, Wendy will also be sleeping with you, so bring her here.”</p>
<p>“Yes, understood.”</p>
<p>Despite the additional words, it was clear he didn’t want to leave, so she kissed him on the lips. As she did that, Lustian’s lips curved in the direction of the sky. He promptly left for the office room. The commotion outside continued.</p>
<p><em>What is this all about?</em></p>
<p>It was worrying, but the government affairs couldn’t be determined by the empress’s identity.</p>
<p>That day, Lustian didn’t return to the bed chambers. He sent a simple letter through the valet saying he would be late.</p>
<p><em>How urgent must it be…</em></p>
<p>Viola woke up early the next morning. She opened her eyes due to the rising dawn, but there was also a familiar shadow showing in the darkness. She could feel that his tall body, wide shoulders, and scent belonged to Lustian. However, it seemed as though he wouldn’t get close to her and sighed in a place far from her.</p>
<p>She tossed and turned, pretending to sleep. Just then, he carefully went up to her, kissed her forehead, and did the same to Wendy. Suddenly, there was a sharp smell of blood. Unable to stand it, she jumped up, scaring Lustian.</p>
<p>“…You weren’t asleep?”</p>
<p>“Blood… What is going on, Lune!”</p>
<p>“Hush, keep quiet. You’ll wake Wendy.”</p>
<p>Viola bit down on her lower lip and climbed down from the bed. Then, she looked at Lustian who had his back to the moonlight. Even if it seemed like he changed into clean clothes and washed himself up, he could not conceal the smell of blood. She could not tell if the blood belonged to a beast or a human, but it was obvious he was battling the other night. She was scared to death.</p>
<p>For a while, he petted Wendy’s hair and her back until he got up. Viola tenaciously followed Lustian from behind and grabbed his hand as he walked further away from the bedroom.</p>
<p>“I’ll need to see it.”</p>
<p>“Vi-Viola?”</p>
<p>She needed to check if the blood was his or not at once. As she tried to take his clothes off, she was flustered. He grabbed her wrist, refusing to have his clothes be taken off. His actions made her more suspicious.</p>
<p>“I at least know that even if you use the healing stone, it would take a day for your scars to completely recover.”</p>
<p>“Wa-wait. Viola.”</p>
<p>Viola glared at him. She was going mad thinking of someone wounding him. She was willing to take her dress off right this instant and participate in the battle, wielding a sword.</p>
<p>Her tenacity made Lustian give up. When he relaxed, it became easier to take his clothes off. All of the clothes on his upper body came off. Then, a long scar extending from his chest to his lower belly came into view. She understood that it was quite a huge scar after seeing the fingernail marks of a beast. Since they used the healing stone for the emergency procedure, it had stopped the bleeding, but it seemed as though a scar would remain. There was a searing pain in her chest.</p>
<p>“How….”</p>
<p>“I was surrounded by the enemies.”</p>
<p>“But you’re not one to go down at the hands of the Orcs. Not you….”</p>
<p>“Perhaps I wasn’t on guard.” He grabbed Viola’s hand and kissed it.</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“I tried coming back a day later, but I couldn’t take it. At that moment, I wanted to see you and Wendy.”</p>
<p>“I hate seeing you wounded. I really… hate it.”</p>
<p>Viola swallowed her tears. Picturing him thinking of her and Wendy even while being surrounded by the Orcs made her blood rise to her head. Even after the war, Lustian had to always live in a state of anxiety.</p>
<p><em>Could this be… a part of the curse that God bestowed Lustian? </em>She couldn’t help but think of that.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to solve this on your own. Discuss it with me.”</p>
<p>She looked at him longingly. However, aside from his simple sweet smile, he didn’t say much else. He fiddled with her lips and smiled brightly.</p>
<p><em>The most beautiful man in the world loves me and only me. He can smile knowing that he would carry the world on his shoulders.</em></p>
<p>“Hasn’t it been hard for you from the moment you were born? You can’t even relax in my arms and have all the happiness you deserve.”</p>
