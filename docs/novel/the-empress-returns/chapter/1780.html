<p><strong>Chapter 126</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Ivan plopped into a chair. Just then, he could see traces of a paternity test on the table. Ivan suddenly remembered how flustered Kyle looked. He opened the lid of the tray. Inside, the bubbling from earlier had subsided and he could see the blood that turned to a gold color. Ivan was mortified.</p>
<p>“Th-this is… the blood of the imperial family!”</p>
<p>Ivan’s jaw dropped from the immense shock. He could hear the sound of the official coming down from upstairs. Ivan dropped the tray on the floor right away. As he did so, the golden water seeping through the surface of the carpet soaked in. It was an action done on impulse, but he thought that it was the only way to protect a loved one.</p>
<p><em>…Who is that? Could this child be… my older brother’s…</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Lustian anxiously waited for the results. Deep inside, he repeatedly made himself think rationally instead of impulsively.</p>
<p><em>Could this… mix with my blood? If Wendy really is my daughter…</em></p>
<p>His chest was puffing up. It would be proof that Viola was God’s Companion, but despite that, he felt overwhelming happiness to the point where his chest ached.</p>
<p><em>I can protect Viola as well… It’s all right. Wendy…. If I find out that Wendy is my daughter…</em></p>
<p>His heart raced. The emotions that spread across his whole body were a result of his love for Wendy. Lustian was pacing around, unable to sit still. Unlike how he usually was, he awaited the news from Kyle with a very anxious look on his face.</p>
<p>The time had come. As soon as he saw Kyle rushing on the horse with dust flying everywhere, Lustian ran up to him.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>“What were the results?”</p>
<p>Kyle simply nodded.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lustian lost strength in his legs. Without realizing it, he was all smiles and couldn’t control the overwhelming emotion. He followed the path to the crown prince’s palace. He had to find Wendy. The child…</p>
<p>He ran to where he could hear the child’s laughter. Soon he found two people sitting on their stomachs in the wide drawing-room, looking at a picture book. They were Wendy and Viola. He felt like he would burst out crying. He didn’t know how he would put these overflowing emotions into words…</p>
<p>Viola tilted her head looking at Lustian who rushed in. He ran up to them in haste. Then, he lifted Wendy into his arms and hugged her with all of his might.</p>
<p>“~Wendy….”</p>
<p>While Wendy was being held, her arms were shaking. It seemed as though she was shocked at the sudden physical contact, but she calmly stayed in his arms. His heart became very sensitive as if it had been hit by a hammer. It felt like his whole world became brighter as soon as he found out that the irresistibly adorable child was his own.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty….”</p>
<p>Viola must’ve felt that something was amiss when she told everybody in the drawing-room to leave. There were only the three of them left now. Feeling a warm touch wrapping around his elbows, he grabbed her hand. The three of them were pulled into a deep hug.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Viola held the sleeping Wendy in her arms and laid her down on the bed. Then, Lustian cautiously went up to them. As if he was waiting, he grabbed Viola’s waist and started kissing her as soon as she came.</p>
<p>“~Mmmm….”</p>
<p>When his beautiful face went up to Viola’s lips, he carefully licked her lips that were parting.</p>
<p>“Mmmm….”</p>
<p>Her lips parted on her own and his tongue slipped inside. They sucked on each other’s entangled tongues and caressed each other without rest.</p>
<p>Viola thought of Lustian holding Wendy just a while ago. <em>I tried so hard to keep it a secret… But it seemed as though I couldn’t fool him. Even if I didn’t talk about Wendy’s identity, he could sense it. It was because of a strong sense of paternal love showing in his sad expression.</em></p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. It must’ve also been difficult for you….”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Viola nibbled on her lips. She smelled his fragrance in the arms of the man she loved.</p>
<p>“That was the best decision you could’ve made in that situation. I am so glad I am not the person I was eight years ago. If that were the case, I would’ve definitely hurt you again.”</p>
<p>“I am so sorry. Truly….”</p>
<p>Lustian peppered her with light kisses, put his tongue into her ear, and licked her earflaps. Every place he touched was heating up. When he took a deep breath and took his lips off her lips, he opened his eyes slightly. The long silver thread made of their saliva connected the two of them together.</p>
<p>“There was no revenge from the beginning. My resentment for you at the time is nothing compared to how much I love you.”</p>
<p>“Lune!”</p>
<p>Viola leapt into his arms. Endless tears streamed down her cheeks. <em>He has no idea how much… I’ve been waiting for those words.</em></p>
<p>Lustian held her cheeks and made eye contact. Just then, she saw his moist pupils. He was the one who wanted to cry. However, he was a strong man, and since he had to protect many people, he didn’t want to show signs of weakness.</p>
<p>“From now on, our family’s happiness is my top priority. You have my word. The three of us will never part under any circumstance.”</p>
<p>“Yes! The same goes for me! We… must never part!”</p>
<p>She nuzzled into him once again. As she did, Lustian held her to the point where it seemed like her body would crumble.</p>
<p>“I love you… Viola.”</p>
<p>“I love you… I love you too. Lune, Lune….”</p>
<p>A satisfied smile subtly spread across his face. He gently grabbed hold of Viola’s wet hair and kissed her. With the tip of his tongue, he thoroughly licked her teeth and all the way to the root of her tongue. The sounds of sucking on her lips and tongue were cathartic, and the saliva trickling across their lips erotic.</p>
<p>“Mmmm…. Mmm….”</p>
<p>The tongue that went inside of her mouth repeatedly went back and forth between going around in circles and then letting go. The texture felt deep. They took off each other’s clothes and kept caressing each other’s bodies.</p>
<p>“Ahhh….”</p>
<p>Lustian went through her core with his fingers. His long fingers poked her sensitive spot precisely. As he did, she arched her back. At the same time, her n*pples were erect. He used one hand to squeeze her mounds while sucking on her lips.</p>
