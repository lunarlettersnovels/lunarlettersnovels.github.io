            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 67 – Surrender (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>“Ngh…. No…,”</p>
<p>This was the waiting room. It was unlikely that anyone would walk in, but surely there were maids waiting right outside the doors, waiting for the next command.</p>
<p>One of them holding tea, one holding water, and one holding a tray of biscuits perhaps….</p>
<p>Viola had to hold in her pleasure as much as possible.</p>
<p>“Aah… this is….”</p>
<p>Viola tried to push his head away, but instead he grasped her bottom even tighter and thrust his tongue even deeper inside of her. As he rubbed his nose on her petals, her breath caught in her throat. She felt she was going berserk. The more his tongue slid back and forth between her sensitive areas and his mouth suckled her core, the more the room became filled with her small, muffled sounds of pleasure.</p>
<p>Even if they were surrounded by walls, those walls were made of wood. She was certain these sounds would easily travel through those thin walls and be heard from outside the room. She bit down hard on her lower lip.</p>
<p><em>This… I can’t resist him… No… I shouldn’t. This man is the leader of the Blood Army which caused Edward’s death… But, the one who is doing this to me now is Lune… Lune.</em></p>
<p>Her thoughts were muddled.</p>
<p>The Blood Army which had led Edward to his death… and the leader of that army, Lustian- Though he and Lune were the same person, while he was s*xu*lly serving her like this, she couldn’t help but think of him as Lune.</p>
<p>His hand reached up through her dress and grabbed her peak. His fingers pinched and rubbed her b*d, her hips thrust forward. She felt such pleasure that she nearly fainted. As his tongue pushed deeper into her c*ital cavern, her eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Ahhh~”</p>
<p>Viola covered her mouth with her own hand. With this level of pleasure, she couldn’t hold in her mo*ns by just biting her lip. Her pulse was racing, her heart beating out of her chest. Her body had become so sensitive that it didn’t feel like her own anymore. His lips moved to kiss her freely open th*ghs. She felt a jolt of pleasure that was different from when he licked her cave. He started to suckle her inner th*gh, and she nearly jumped in shock.</p>
<p>“Aah, Lune— ”</p>
<p>His false name slipped from her lips. She was determined to never let his true name come out of her mouth, no matter how much pleasure she felt.</p>
<p>Even though Lustian and Lune were the same person who was pleasuring her now, she felt that thinking of them as two different people would lessen her guilt towards Edward. However, unlike her determined mind, her body was melting in his hands like putty. Her head was thrown back and she felt her own wetness trickling down between her legs. Her own small m*ans rang in her ears, and she clutched his hair in an attempt to contain herself. At this, he finally removed his head from under her dress to look at her. His face was glistening with sweat. At the same time, his expression was full of deep l*st.</p>
<p>“Should I take it off for you?”</p>
<p>“— I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Viola tried to take off her dress on her own, but her hands trembled so much that she couldn’t reach the ribbon. It was true that she needed his help. He reached his hand behind her back and pulled the ribbon loose, her dress fell down freely around her feet. As her beautiful n*ked body came into view, he swallowed hard. Then he quickly got rid of his own clothing.</p>
<p>In a sweeping motion, he lifted her off of her feet and placed her down on the sofa that was on one side of the room. She screwed her eyes shut, her body tense. She had expected his m*nh*od to penetrate her next, but he didn’t do so immediately.</p>
<p>She felt something touch her lips, and the smell of flesh filled her senses. When she opened her eyes, Lustian had placed the tip of his sh*ft at the edge of her mouth.</p>
<p>“You’ll s*ck me too, won’t you? It’s only fair that we both enjoy it together.”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p><em>Asking me to s*ck him?</em> She was utterly shocked at the enormous size of his er*ctn*ss.</p>
<p>“Your goal is divorce, and mine is to spend the next five months without a moment wasted. If you don’t like it, it’s not too late to change the contract back to two years.”</p>
<p>“Of course I’ll do it.”</p>
<p><em>After all, it’s not that difficult!</em></p>
<p>She was determined that she could do it. She grasped his sh*ft firmly in her hand. Perhaps she had grabbed it too tightly, for he groaned slightly, but he was still smiling to himself in enjoyment.</p>
<p><em>Bastard… If you’re trying to show dominance in this way, it won’t work.</em></p>
<p>Viola opened her mouth wide. The tip of his huge rod began to leak with pr*cum. She gazed at his gigantic organ in front of her eyes and swallowed hard. But it was not easy to just put it in her mouth. She couldn’t believe that something so huge had entered her own core before, and just stared at it.</p>
<p>“Is it too difficult? It won’t be very easy to do. Right?”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>Holding his sh*ft in her hand, she glanced up at his face. His eyes were burning, almost exploding with desire. He took her chin in his hand and eased it downwards, seemingly impatient for her to start.</p>
<p>“If you make me come with your mouth, I’ll give you a reward. I’ll only enter you once today.”</p>
<p>“Fine!”</p>
<p>She put her nose against his rod and tried licking it gently. At this, Lustian’s thighs trembled and shook. Finally, she placed her mouth around the end of his huge b*ner. His eyes closed.</p>
<p>“Ah… that’s good. I feel like I could come even if you suck me just once… Mm….”</p>
<p>Viola grabbed the base of his rod and licked it in one long motion from bottom to top. His fluid, thick as honey, wet her palm. His pr*cum dripped down and touched her tongue. The taste was surprisingly not unpleasant. In fact, it gave her a strange feeling of power. That she could suck on a man’s meat. She was surprised at herself.</p>
<p>The Lustian now was unbelievably s*xy.</p>
<p>The look of a man enjoying s*xual pleasure…</p>
