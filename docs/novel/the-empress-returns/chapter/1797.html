            <p><strong>Chapter 109</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Many coaches arrived at the secondary palace. Today, the princesses that entered the imperial palace that day would be stepping into the outside world after 10 years of not being able to. They would each live new lives returning to their home country that they longed for.</p>
<p>Viola came to the secondary palace early to see them off. Anne, who unlike them could not leave the Arpen Empire, looked at them with envious eyes.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I shall never forget this favor. I wish you happiness.”</p>
<p>“Naturally, this is what I must do.”</p>
<p>The princesses expressed their gratitude to Viola while shedding tears. For no special reason, Viola felt bashful. She wouldn’t forget how they told her one-by-one that they would repay her as they got on the coach.</p>
<p>The last princess that was getting on the coach would not let go of Viola’s hand.</p>
<p>“Truly, you must tell us if you need help from our kingdom. I will do everything I can to convince my father to help you.”</p>
<p>“Just from those words, I feel like I can depend on you.”</p>
<p>“These aren’t just empty words. Viola, my empress….”</p>
<p>There were multiple times that she would mention that she needed to ask for help. Viola felt as though the coach wouldn’t move until sundown if she didn’t make a pledge, so she nodded her head.</p>
<p>Eventually, the coach moved. Altogether, the princesses stuck their heads out of the windows of the coach and waved at her. Likewise, Viola waved her hand until the coach disappeared from her sight. As the people left all at once, all that was left in the secondary palace was the chill air, even so Viola felt proud.</p>
<p>“It seems that their dreams were not in vain. You, my empress, are such an incredible person….” Anne sounded displeased. When she turned around, she was biting her own lip and looking at Viola awkwardly.</p>
<p>“You must have found happiness yourself if you’re married to the Grand Duke Ivan, isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>“Happiness? No, it isn’t happiness, it’s misfortune. If I could go back in time, I wouldn’t agree to this marriage. This relationship isn’t from the heart but only physical… The feeling of being a sex slave still won’t leave.”</p>
<p>“Anne, that’s….”</p>
<p>“May I be even more frank? His Highness is in love with the empress of this country.”</p>
<p>“I say! Anne!”</p>
<p>Anne turned around and ran off with a horrible look on her face. Viola felt dreary. She didn’t want anyone else to be hurt because of her, but she couldn’t do anything about it.</p>
<p>Rosha came up to Viola. “Princess Anne was jealous of Your Highness from the beginning. Even if the Grand Duke Ivan didn’t feel that way about Your Highness, the outcome would be the same.”</p>
<p>“Surely you don’t mean—</p>
<p>“Personally, I sensed greed in her.”</p>
<p>“By greed, do you mean—”</p>
<p>“It would be a l*st for power. The ability to enjoy the power of being this country’s Empress.”</p>
<p>“Rosha!” Viola was shocked.</p>
<p>“From what I’ve heard, the dowry that Princess Anne had as a result of marrying the Grand Duke Ivan was enormous. Of course, the money was distributed to the imperial family, but because of these events, Princess Anne’s home country, the Kingdom of Luanna, exceeded the one-year financial budget. Oh, and here’s something else I heard. Well, the first kingdom that experienced prosperity following the war was the Kingdom of Luanna.”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>VIola didn’t know where she had heard this news from, but Rosha was very knowledgeable. There was a sparkle in the maid’s eyes.</p>
<p>“The one whose position changes constantly according to their own circumstances is the person to be most wary of.”</p>
<p>“That is true. But even if Anne was doing that, I don’t want to go so far as to be on an alert with Grand Duke Ivan.”</p>
<p>“No. Please stay away from them. You will only end up enabling His Highness’s jealousy,” the maid urged.</p>
<p>“Rosha, you seem to have changed a lot.”</p>
<p>Rosha grabbed her hand hard and looked in the direction Anne disappeared. “I was there during those days Your Highness was yearning for the emperor, and I cannot stand to see your happiness fall apart now.”</p>
<p>“You are quite dependable.”</p>
<p>Such a little girl grew up to be a lady in no time and became a loyal subject. As long as Viola remained the Empress of the Arpen Empire, Rosha also had to stay behind. She couldn’t even get married yet… Rosha would be 25 years old this year, so it’s already too late for that.</p>
<p><em>I would have to look for a chance to find a man who would make Rosha happy.</em></p>
<p>Just then, after a horse arrived, Wendy came down from it. Surprisingly, it was Lustian’s black steed, and the person who came down with Wendy was the man himself.</p>
<p>“If you sent everyone away, they should stop coming back. Did you wish for my return?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I told them to leave. Agh!”</p>
<p>Lustian grabbed Viola’s hand and mounted her on the horse. Viola looked at Rosha, flustered.</p>
<p>As soon as Viola sat in Wendy’s spot, Wendy stretched out her hand. As if he was bothered, Lustian’s face scrunched, but he grabbed onto the reins after he commanded Kyle to let Wendy ride. Soon after, they could hear the whinnying duo of horses as they ran along the course of River Judith.</p>
<p>Viola’s heart was so full it felt as though it would burst. She couldn’t be happier looking at those sturdy forearms grabbing onto her waist as Wendy rode on the horse next to hers.</p>
<p><em>I’m so happy…. Your Highness, do you know? This child is your daughter.</em></p>
<p>Viola was confused as to whether she should disclose Wendy’s identity.</p>
<p>Wendy, being the only one to inherit the blood of the emperor, was the most precious being in existence, but she also lived a dangerous existence at the same time. The imperial family’s only line of descent could become the enemy’s target.</p>
<p><em>Father.. should do well to keep this secret until the end…</em></p>
<p>Truth be told, Rosha, Paul, and the King of Koronis were the only ones who knew that Wendy was Lustian’s child. As soon as Viola was pregnant, she went to the abandoned castle that she used to live in and gave birth to the child there. When the Slovenia Continent was swept away by the snowstorm of warfare… Viola made a deal with the king.</p>
<p><em><strong>“This is your child. It will not just be me who has to conceal this child’s identity, but also you. Viola…”</strong></em></p>
