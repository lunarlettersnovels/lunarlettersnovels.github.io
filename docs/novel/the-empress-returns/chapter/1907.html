            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 57 – The Empress (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>“This is a test from God and the one who needs to solve it is me not you. So, you just need to stay in your place and listen to my orders. Now go play. As much as you want… because that’s where you belong.”</p>
<p>With that, Lustian disappeared into the magical wall. Ivan’s expression changed completely once the man had vanished.</p>
<p>“Lustian… it seems like we have the same goal. Hahaha….!”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Viola was sitting before the mirror finishing up her makeup. She had preferred to keep the ugly facade inside the imperial palace even though she was Lune’s wife now. This was the face she had arrived with, so until she left this palace she needed to wear this mask.</p>
<p>“Princess, Lord Lune sent you a gift.”</p>
<p>“Gift?”</p>
<p>Rosha came inside making a fuss as several servants lowered some things onto the floor. There were several large boxes. The little maid opened a gold coloured box revealing a dazzlingly beautiful dress. That wasn’t the end of it. There were many more gifts, including jewels, gold coins, and even ornaments made of gold. The little girl screeched in awe.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! So many… He must be really wealthy!”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Viola was equally shocked. This was the first time in her life that she had received so many presents. Her eyes popped wide open. Rosha took out a necklace with a large sapphire hanging on it. The dress was also fancily decorated with jewels.</p>
<p>“I don’t need jewelry,” Viola said, still trying to take in the suddenness of the things.</p>
<p>“Still, you should wear this dress today.” Rosha urged.</p>
<p>“No. I don’t like things like this.”</p>
<p>“Who’s going to blame you if you dress up for just a day?!” It seemed like the little maid was hell bent on her having her way,</p>
<p>A fancy dress on an ugly face was nothing but pearls around a pig’s neck, but Rosha forced her mistress to try on the dress.</p>
<p>Viola stood in front of the mirror in the red dress.</p>
<p>“—uh? Wow…!”</p>
<p>“What is this? Are clothes really wings?”</p>
<p>“One really does look pretty in a beautiful dress.”</p>
<p>The dress’s luster made her look pretty but soon her face that didn’t match with the dress revealed itself. The beauty lasted but a moment. There was no way her current face would ever look beautiful. Viola and Rosha burst out laughing. The disguise they had created was quite funny.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the head maid came looking for Viola urgently. Before the latter even turned around, a woman stormed inside kicking the door open. Viola bristled at the stifling hostility.</p>
<p>In came a woman with a beautiful appearance…</p>
<p>“Her Majesty.”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Viola was startled. <em>Why was Prince Lustian’s Mother here?!</em> She soon realized why.</p>
<p>Viola was Lune’s wife unofficially, so he visited her during the training period under the guise of the crown prince. It seemed like the empress misunderstood that it was Prince Lustian visiting her.</p>
<p>Viola had to treat her as a crown princess candidate would. She bowed deeply, holding on to the hem of her dress according to proper etiquette. The empress then stared at Viola.</p>
<p>“Raise your head.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Viola raised her and made eye contact with her.  The empress carefully scanned the girl from head to toe.  Wherever her gaze went it tingled as if a cold dagger had stabbed her there. Her glaring made it clear that she had misunderstood.</p>
<p>She looked at the girl’s fingers and then reached out her hand. Viola tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>“That’s not a ring you can have. Give it to me.”</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>“The ring, I said that it doesn’t belong to you.”</p>
<p>She was asking for the ring that Lune had given to her some time ago. She didn’t know why she wanted this ring but Viola felt like she shouldn’t disobey her. She just somehow felt like she shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Viola felt that the woman before her was someone that one shouldn’t ever make enemies with…</p>
<p>Nobody could disobey an order from the empress, someone who was more influential than the crown prince in the imperial palace when the emperor wasn’t around.</p>
<p>Viola took off the ring and handed it over to her. She tightly grasped onto the ring and laughed at the girl.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen such an ugly princess before. That’s right. Where did these crazy rumors… Lustian’s standards are so high, so how would he ever fall for a princess like this!”</p>
<p>She was mistaking Lune for Lustian. It was natural she would, so Viola didn’t correct her. She felt humiliated, however, being appraised by the other like an object. Her throat was prickling. It was her who made herself like this but still, it didn’t feel good.</p>
<p>Viola gulped and tried her best to act as a weak hostage in front of her. <em>The empress had come in suspicious but were her suspicions relieved after seeing her face? </em>She coldly turned her head and walked back out the way she came from.</p>
<p>“Princess, are you all right?”</p>
<p>“Haaa….”</p>
<p>Only then did Viola breathe. Her legs were trembling. She couldn’t help but feel nervous no matter how hard she trained and honed her will for revenge. Rosha looked at her anxiously, but Viola pulled herself together, steadied, and stood straight.</p>
<p>She then headed for the dining area. She started eating as if nothing happened as the more this happened the more she needed to eat well and train harder. She could feel glances directed at her. The head maid and Rosha quietly watched as she ate. She ate slower than usual, by the time she finished the dessert, the sun was above the dining room.</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard a loud ruckus outside and saw Lune’s figure. She stared at him as he walked towards her. Without a preamble, he grabbed her hand and put a ring on her finger. Viola’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p><em>How had he gotten the ring the empress had taken</em>… that was the question on her mind.</p>
