            <p><strong>Chapter 139</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>The cold air wrapped around the previous empress’s body. The altar had a more unsettling atmosphere than usual.</p>
<p>“Last night, I saw some text on the parchment from the library. I was so shocked….”</p>
<p>“What… was it?” Her face turned pale.</p>
<p>“No matter how much he’ll hold you and whisper proclamations of love in your ear, you shall never be washed off your sins….” A melancholic smile spread across Viola’s face. This was more depressing than the idea of becoming God’s Companion.</p>
<p>“Pardon me? What did you just say?” Her lips were quivering.</p>
<p>“If you think just for a while of how the new world has many gods with strict rules that they follow amongst themselves, you will find the answer. There will always be a king there. Thus, I will be the one facing punishment. I love not the God of Judith, but instead another man, and so His intention is to make me God’s Companion so that I live with half a heart, longing for the man that I truly love, until death.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>She herself did not know what she was saying. However, Viola could see it clearly. The text that appeared on the parchment and then faded away. At first, she was confused as to what the text was referring to, but now that she had become God’s Companion, she understood.</p>
<p>She was God’s Companion.</p>
<p>And not only did the emperor know about this, but also the previous empress. Perhaps more people knew about this… Of course, everyone fooled her. Except for one person… Paul.</p>
<p><em><strong>“What are you saying? Do you mean that I should tell the emperor?”</strong></em></p>
<p>Paul was bouncing around. The one who said that she’d meet the previous empress was Viola. From the start, she didn’t trust in the condition that Lustian told her about in order to get Paul to be on her side. Paul, being as obedient as he was, wasn’t one to be swayed by money or power, so wouldn’t there be another reason? She was suspicious.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Lately, His Highness has been training Sir Paul himself.”</strong></em></p>
<p>She heard about this from Rosha. At the time he was sparring every day, and Paul was always by his side. There could only be one reason why the knight stood by his side, despite serving her as if she was his king. He was in danger. There was no other reason why he’d be shaken.</p>
<p>Viola figured out that Lustian was using Paul to hide something. She was daring enough to resist him, but she couldn’t let this slide any longer.</p>
<p>“So… what do you intend to do? Do you still want to become God’s Companion and go to Him?”</p>
<p>“No, never.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I will fight. I will face God and battle him. We will not part again. Even those eight years of waiting were agonizing, so there is no way that I will spend my whole life apart from him.”</p>
<p>“M-My empress! This is extremely dangerous. Do you think that’s possible?”</p>
<p>She knew it wasn’t easy, but Viola could not give up. Lustian was risking his life to fight, so she couldn’t rest comfortably.</p>
<p>“When I arrived as Empress, I made a promise to Edward, a knight who was protecting me. I would never succumb to my destiny, and instead, I would protect my loved ones.”</p>
<p>She looked at Viola with a bewildered expression. Since Viola was on top of the stairs, it was like she was looking up to a higher being, but it did not faze her. In fact, she was mesmerized as if she was looking at an otherworldly person.</p>
<p>Viola climbed down the stairs and greeted her respectfully. As her daughter-in-law and Empress of the empire, she decided to treat her with respect since she was her predecessor.</p>
<p>“I know that you don’t approve of me. But please wait. Watch me as I overcome this obstacle. And the day you accept me as Empress, I wish that you invite our family to the temple and join us for a lovely dinner.”</p>
<p>Viola held her head high and turned around. The previous empress stood in one place for a while, looking at the departing figure, and laughed. She wrapped her black dress and went up the stairs in a frenzy. She looked at the slumbering Emperor as if she was pleading.</p>
<p>“As expected… the empress is on a different level. You were right, Your Highness. Then, should I just watch over her idly? That will not be an easy feat, Your Highness….”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>After Viola came out of the temple, her legs shook. She tried to pay it no mind but the shock was immense. As soon as her legs gave out and she tried to sit, Paul tried to grab her arm. However, she waved him away.</p>
<p>“I am fine.”</p>
<p>“My empress, I shall tell you what is torturing me. My allegiance to you is what led me to the answers that are now putting you in such danger—”</p>
<p>Paul’s body started trembling, he was unable to finish his words. She did know why he was so afraid. She tried to put on a dignified look as she continued.</p>
<p>“Paul, I am thankful that you serve me as if I’m your king. I intend to repay you. However… what do you think it means to be a true knight? It is important to protect your king from danger, but I also think it is your duty as a knight to never go against your king’s wishes and help them.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness—” His eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>“I am not one to be protected by anyone. I am someone who should protect my family. Lune… if he allows me to help carry his burden, wouldn’t he feel more courageous? All it takes is for him to make up his mind.”</p>
<p>“The battlefield isn’t what you’re picturing, Your Highness. For the eyes that have only seen beautiful things… being shown such cruelty and carnage is—” He still spoke with concern in his voice, but it seemed that he had become less stubborn.</p>
