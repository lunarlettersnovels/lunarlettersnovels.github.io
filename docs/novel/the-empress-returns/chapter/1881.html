            <p><strong>Chapter 146</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Just like that, He warned her to come back.</p>
<p>The fate was decided like that and it was only natural to return the half heart to him. But then that was giving up on everything. It wasn’t in her personality to give up on anything without even trying a little. She was determined not to collapse under any circumstances.</p>
<p><em>I’m not going anywhere. The place I have to be is beside Lune… You wait. It’s not too late to have your heart back when my life ends…</em></p>
<p>Viola whispered to God in her heart then kissed Lustian’s lips as if telling him to watch. As she passionately kissed him with her tongue, she saw the relief spreading his face.</p>
<p>“I love you, Lune… Hmm!”</p>
<p>Viola roughly squeezed her tongue and then sucked on his hot tongue. At the same time, she licked his teeth, rolled his tongue, and tied her own with his. His hands that were hugging her tightly were busy.</p>
<p>She bit his lips and passionately explored them. Their lips burned even hotter. As she actively entangled their tongues, Lustian’s eyes were full of heat.</p>
<p>“Was there this side of you? For me, it’s more ecstatic.”</p>
<p>“I’m no longer trying to hide it.”</p>
<p>She lightly climbed onto his hips and rolled her lips. He stared at her ecstatically. She slid her hands under his clothes. She felt tingled as she touched the hard skin. He closed his eyes and felt her touch.</p>
<p>“… Ha….”</p>
<p>Their lips overlapped again. They roughly sucked on each other’s tongues. As she wrapped around the root of the tongue like he did, pleasure came. As she looked down, she could see his long eyelashes shaking.</p>
<p>“You are always more of an amazing woman than I thought.”</p>
<p>As he softly touched her cheek, she kissed his giant palm. Then she moaned a little as she rubbed against his palm.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that why you fell for me?” She smiled as she bit his chin a little.</p>
<p>“Of course. Not just falling for you, but love you to the point where I want to take out my entire heart and give it to you.”</p>
<p>He was smile was blindingly bright, so beautiful. Her heart raced. She used her finger to climb from his lips to his neck to this heart. The heart that was beating was ferocious. It was so hot that it felt like it was going to explode soon. The thing that touched underneath her thigh was also pulsating.</p>
<p>“Leave this heart here. I’ll give you my heart… Mm!”</p>
<p>The lips collided before she finished. She melted at his skin that was coming in through her lips. He bit her ear and nibbled her face. She couldn’t handle his touch that was full of lust.</p>
<p>They flipped and now Lustian was on top of Viola. Then, like he was crazy about kissing, he suck and licked her lips. The erect thing touched her lower part. As the two g*nitals rubbed each other, she shook in pleasure. He looked more joyous.</p>
<p>“It’ll be fun to love so passionately and to screw the same God together. Haha…!”</p>
<p>His lips touched her neck. Her bre@sts were already flattened by his hard, sculpted chest. His breathing was rough. As he sucked on the skin under her neck, there was a sound. Her cave was already so wet that she could feel the nectar oozing down.</p>
<p>“Ah ut…!”</p>
<p>He licked her ear canal, her shoulders shuddered as the sharp tongue entered her ear. The twin peaks that were held by giant hands shook like no tomorrow. At the same time, she felt the rod that was touching the inside of her thigh. When did he take it off… He was naked. The manh*od that entered through lace p*nties was very lewd.</p>
<p>“Viola… Ha…!”</p>
<p>“Ah… Uh ut, ah ut!”</p>
<p>His shaft went in all at once. As the thing that stabbed quickly reached deep, she didn’t feel the pain that she’d feel whenever it entered. She shook in pleasure as it immediately touched <em><strong>the</strong></em> spot.</p>
<p>Their juices mixed where it was already wet. Her mouth opened at such bulkiness. His lips again touched hers… entangled, they sucked on each other’s lips.</p>
<p>“Uh ut… ah! Lustian…!”</p>
<p>“So good, ut ut! Viola…!”</p>
<p>Viola raised her nails. The pleasure that could not be described made her insides even wetter. Lustian, as if she were his object, peppered her with marks on her lips and various places on her neck. She, too, left marks on his body. They left marks on each other like beasts. It looked more reverent than lewd.</p>
<p>He grabbed the back of her hands and sprung his hip.</p>
<p><em><strong>Squish, squish…</strong></em></p>
<p>The wet rubbing sound felt great. When they’re indulged in c*ital pleasure, Lustian became a totally different person. He was never relaxed. Viola threw her head to the back and swallowed her m*ans.</p>
<p>“Ah ah! Ah ah…!”</p>
<p>“Ha, ha ut…!”</p>
<p>Her core was melting due to the tingling sensation. The pillar that was in her cave and his touch made her breathless. He gathered her mounds, took out his tongue, and licked on it crazily. Then, panting by her ears, moved his hips like an animal. She was going crazy.</p>
<p>“Ah… ah…!”</p>
<p>“Ugh, ha, ha…!”</p>
<p>His movements became aggressive. At the same time, the gasping m*ans also became more aggressive. She felt like her face was going to explode. The rough back and forth movement made her spine chill.</p>
