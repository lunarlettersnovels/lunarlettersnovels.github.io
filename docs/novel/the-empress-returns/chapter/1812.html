<p><strong>Chapter 94 – Betrayal (2)</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>After Ivan left, Paul returned in the afternoon. As Viola checked the king’s private instructions, her stomach tied in knots. She covered her mouth as she retched. The private instructions contained an inconceivable order.</p>
<p><strong>I will be sending over a colorless and odorless poison, so use that to kill the heir. Avenge Edward and escape. From then on, I will be on the move.</strong></p>
<p>As Viola continued retching, an incessant stream of tears naturally trickled down. Her hands were shaking. To think that she would murder Lustian with her own hands…</p>
<p><em>‘How will I kill him with my own hands? How can I!’ </em>Viola felt as though she was standing in front of the most adversarial turning point of her life. <em>‘Murdering him… How can I murder him…’</em></p>
<p>With a shaky breath, her body was trembling as if she was convulsing. Her eyes were bloodshot. <em>‘What do I do? If I disobey the king’s orders, would I never be the successor to the throne?’</em> It was too much of a cruel command to compromise his life for the throne.</p>
<p><em>‘…Think! Viola… What is the best way…’</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Night fell. She sent for Paul and Rosha, facing her final decision. As the little maid handed the map she found to the knight, he prepared the coach. Seeing as the heir left the castle today, today was the ideal day to slip out discreetly.</p>
<p>Ivan was helping Viola from the shadows. He had handed out the token of royalty so that his coach could pass through the gates of the castle.</p>
<p>“I am also wondering how your decision will affect my fate. Pay me what you owe me the day we meet again.”</p>
<p>Viola nodded her head and immediately headed to the Forest of Gods. If Guinev wanted it, the plan was to take her out of the Forest of Gods. She felt that she would regret it if she did not even try to free Guinev even if she could not cross the divine territory.</p>
<p>Viola’s body was sucked into the territory again. This was the second time she had entered, but it felt different from the last time. It felt strange.</p>
<p>By the river, Viola held in her breath and ducked down as low as she could. Just then, Guinev came walking out of the castle. But… she was wearing a dress that looked appropriate for a wedding.</p>
<p>“Guinev? Who is with—”</p>
<p>Guinev seemed to be walking with a cheerful expression on her face as she headed to the riverside. Viola’s eyes opened wide as she stared in that direction. Eventually, Lustian emerged out of what seemed to be a whirlpool forming in the river. Guinev, as happy as she could be, ran into his arms.</p>
<p>“Finally… you’ve arrived. I waited here, never wandering off anywhere else. I love you, Lustian, Your Imperial Highness….”</p>
<p>Thump, thump. Viola’s heart was beating wildly. Her heart was hurting so much it felt like it would split apart. She felt as if the whole world was spinning. Through her vision, blurry from the tears, she saw the two hold each other in an embrace.</p>
<p>Viola covered her mouth. She wanted to escape the sadness. Watching this was excruciating. Tears were streaming down from her eyes nonstop. She started hyperventilating as she denied this moment. In her heart, she was crying out in extreme sadness.</p>
<p>Despair and resignation came as she felt that all the days he loved her were shattering to pieces. With a hazy vision from the moistness of her tears, she looked at him one last time.</p>
<p>The person Guinev was waiting for was none other than Lustian.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>In broad daylight, there was a deep forest. In the forest where no man set foot, there was no path. All you could see were the layered mountaintops that were a testament to how deep the forest was. It was deathly silent. The sounds of birds chirping and the wind was all that could be heard.</p>
<p>Rustle, rustle. There was the sound of a dry twig being stepped on. In response, the birds stirred from their sleepy daze and fluttered up the trees.</p>
<p>Eventually, there was a lady in sight. The lady’s dress looked extremely miserable. The dress, with no identifiable original color, appeared to have many spots sewn together. The dull dress, lacking even a ribbon to adorn it, was so old that not even a peasant would wear it.</p>
<p>However, if you looked at it carefully, you could infer that it was originally of exquisite material. In addition, you could guess that a dress with various spots that were sewn together with thread originally had decorative material. This dress made of high-class material likely grew haggard over time because it was dragged all around the backwoods.</p>
<p>The blazing sunlight was shining over the lady’s head. As if to make a display of her own presence, she showed her beautiful face.</p>
<p>“…Has it been 8 years as of today?”</p>
<p>The lady’s name was Viola.</p>
<p>Viola looked back at the path that she already journeyed through. In order to not leave tracks, she wore special shoes that ended up making her ankles sore. She sat on the edge of a rock to take off the shoes and massage her feet. Then, she looked at the wooden shoes that seemed to be made to resemble the footprint of a beast. This was of Paul’s own creation. The top was made to look like a shoe and the bottom was shaped like the footprint of a beast. So every time she came out of the mountain cabin she would always wear these shoes.</p>
