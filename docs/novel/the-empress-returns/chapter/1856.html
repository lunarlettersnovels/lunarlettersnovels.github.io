            <p><strong>Chapter 171</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“It’s his natural instinct. Seeing that you act surprised at that despite knowing that so well shows me that you, Your Highness, don’t give up so easily.”</p>
<p>“You’re just a human… Just a human….”</p>
<p>God mumbled under His breath as if He had lost his mind. Since He was in such a shock, He could not even rebuke her mockery.</p>
<p>“I feel like my internal organs are being twisted. Your possessiveness makes me want to vomit.”</p>
<p>“I suppose that is what love does.”</p>
<p>“Love? Do not mess with me. You’ve seen how useless love is with your own eyes, and yet you’re still on about that?”</p>
<p>“I think that love between humans runs deeper.”</p>
<p>“Haha. Never in my 10,000 years of living have I heard something so foolish. Have you not witnessed how worthless the love of humans is?”</p>
<p>“Not everyone will have the same experience. Especially not a special human being such as Lune.”</p>
<p>God took a few breaths through His gritted teeth. It could not be forgiven. The temple was burning up due to the mockery directed at Him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why you provoke me like this.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t he also know you are?”</p>
<p>“…Do not talk such nonsense! Do you seriously think there aren’t any limits to what he can do with that feeble mortal body of his?” God raised his voice. “You’ll see. Lune… The broken vow will not end here….”</p>
<p>God was filled with the desire to take something away from another human. At first, He intended to punish the two of them for breaking the vow, but all of a sudden, He was after what Lustian had. To look at Viola, God stretched His hand over the river and did a divine incantation. But somehow, she did not show up.</p>
<p>“…What is the meaning of this? This is- It can’t be! Has she become pregnant?”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>A week later, after Ivan and Anne were done with negotiations, they returned to the palace. Since it had been quite long since they rode on the carriage, they felt like they were developing blisters on their behind, but they decided to be patient. Upon returning to the palace, they found that there was a festive mood all around. It was also odd to see that the usually gloomy place was lit up.</p>
<p>When Anne went inside, she called the chambermaid to come over. “What has been happening over in the palace?”</p>
<p>“The empress is pregnant.”</p>
<p>“What? Wha… What? Pre-pregnant?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and now Princess Wendy has become the princess. It has been officially announced that she is their child and her identity has been restored.”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>She was very shocked. To think that Viola was pregnant again… On top of that, Wendy’s identity was revealed and she was officially a princess.</p>
<p>Anne fell to the floor. Her body shook uncontrollably. She was full of jealousy. She was so devastated that she could hardly see straight.</p>
<p>“I could never very easily bear a child… No matter how much I tried… But such a thing can happened to Viola so easily?”</p>
<p>She went through much hardship for eight years since she couldn’t bear a child. She would always be taking every possible medication and folk remedy that would help with her sterility. Even so, she could not bear a child. It was a result of the curse placed upon the imperial family…</p>
<p><em>Why! Why! Why is it that Viola gets to avoid the curse?</em></p>
<p>Her eyes were bloodshot. She was very angry and sick to her stomach. She hated Viola. She hated her so much she wanted to kill her. Just then, she could feel that somebody was whispering to her in her head.</p>
<p><em>&lt; I can grant you any wish, so will you make a deal with me? &gt;</em></p>
<p><em>Gasp!</em></p>
<p>“Who… Who are you? Who is talking to me?”</p>
<p><em>&lt; Come into God’s forest. The answer is there. &gt;</em></p>
<p>Anne was shaken. <em>God’s forest… Wasn’t that the place where Ivan’s mother and Guinev were locked up? </em>She got up to seek the source of the voice, but she could no longer hear it. She bit her nails, her face wreathed with nervousness.</p>
<p><em>Did they not have to borrow the power from the high priest? If God wants to see me Himself… and He is giving me this opportunity, there is no sense in not trying.</em></p>
<p>Anne called the chambermaid over. With all the jewelry she had, she adorned her dress beautifully. And she hurried to God’s forest. While Ivan wasn’t around, she hurriedly crossed over to the forest. Only the permitted were allowed in, and since she got God’s approval, she was able to enter.</p>
<p>There, God, in silver hair and white clothing, was waiting for her. He went up to her and lightly lifted her chin. Anne was being seduced by His vile smile. His lips met hers.</p>
<p>“When you’re ready, I shall make a deal. However, for you to attain what you want, you must put something on the line.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do whatever you ask. I’ll even put my life on the line.”</p>
<p>“I do not need your life. You’ll have to give me something even more valuable. Your face is quite beautiful… If you think about how you’ll have to pay your dues, you won’t think it’s so unfair but… these passing fates amount to nothing more than a stone caught in the foot.”</p>
<p>“What… do you mean?”</p>
<p>Anne’s eyes went wide. She could not figure out what he was trying to say.</p>
<p>God blatantly took a look at her face and body. It felt as though she was being undressed in front of Him. Anne was afraid.</p>
<p>“Humans start from the dirt that is their bodies. I do not intend to attain a body that will eventually end up back in the dirt. All I want is one thing. I intend to fight against you to see how long you’ll hold out.</p>
<p>He licked His lips. Anne nodded enthusiastically. She looked soulless. He grinned with a satisfied look on His face.</p>
