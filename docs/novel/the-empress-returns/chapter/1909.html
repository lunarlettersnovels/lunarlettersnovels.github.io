            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 55 – Wanton Desire (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Lune sniffed Viola’s skin and took off her cumbersome dress. The two n@ked bodies then tangled together. He vehemently nipped and sucked every visible part of her body as if marking his territory. His breathing was rough and his hands fumbled around her hastily.</p>
<p>“Ack… Ahh… Ahhh!”</p>
<p>“Viola… Viola… haa, haah….”</p>
<p>He kept saying her name. He also repeatedly kissed and fondled her body as if trying to swallow it whole. She got wetter every time he moved inside her and despite herself, looked at him with anticipation. The changes in her own body made her want to cry but at the same time, it felt ecstatic. The feeling of ecst@sy was quickly followed by embarrassment. She tightly shut her eyes.</p>
<p>“Ack… .”</p>
<p>Lune twisted her stiff n!pples with his teeth inflicting a dizzying sensation, her back bent. She clutched at his soft ebony hair. She had grabbed it roughly but he seemed to like that. His thrusts quickened. She couldn’t resist him whenever they were connected. Her resolve broke and her legs spread wide open.</p>
<p>He nibbled on her peaks. She writhed her shoulders at the torturous pain but he ignored her. He pulled back and then stabbed inside her fiercely.</p>
<p>“Ack… Ahhh.”</p>
<p>The pleasure almost made her burst out into a mo@n, but she stopped herself due to the carriage driver. It made her feel like a p*rvert doing something so l*wd inside, not a bedroom but a carriage. She bit her lips to suppress herself.</p>
<p>He clicked his tongue seeing that. “Don’t bite your lips. If you can’t stand it bite me… or do it inside my mouth.” Lune whispered when he saw her distorted face. Her whole body shuddered when he plunged deep inside her.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>“Relax a bit. Hurry!”</p>
<p>His thick pillar was on the verge of being crushed. Her body that had been exhausted from his caresses had reflexively stiffened. He made her wrap her arms around his shoulders and sit on top of him with her legs apart.</p>
<p>He then started thrusting in earnest. He did quicker than before making her pent-up mo@ns spring out, then as if it had been waiting for his thrusts her eyes flashed white. He then, unhesitatingly, thrust deep inside her.</p>
<p>“Ack… Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>“You feel so… nice.”</p>
<p>She was helplessly sucked in by his p!ston!ng.</p>
<p>The sound of their flesh slapping against each other was loud enough that it could be vividly heard not only inside the carriage but to the driver outside. The sound made her feel embarrassed and ashamed, but all Lune did was kiss her and rather made it worse by adding the wet sounds of their kisses into the mix. Her eyes welled up with tears from all the pleasure.</p>
<p>He pulled out and quickly thrust in. They were stuck so close together that there wasn’t room for even a hair between them. Her skin rubbed against his hot stomach. Her full bre@sts bounced up and down with his thrusts. He grabbed her by the waist and sucked on her large m*unds.</p>
<p>“Ugh… Viola….”</p>
<p>He was like a beast in heat in her eyes. He licked the tears trickling down her eyes. She could hear his panting and then felt his soft lips cover hers. She was engrossed in the sweet kiss when suddenly he plunged in.</p>
<p>“Keu-! Ack! Ah! Ah! Ah!”</p>
<p>He was in a frenzy. Her head touched the roof of the carriage every time he made a strong thrust inside of her, their bodies loudly smacking in the process. His thick and large shaft repeatedly pulled in and out of her.</p>
<p>It was so chaotic that she couldn’t even find the time to bite his shoulder, nor was she able to bite his shoulder. Her whole body was extremely sensitive, engulfed in the desire to be with him.</p>
<p><em>‘This is l*st. It’s just an impulse reaction from the l*st…’</em></p>
<p>She had vowed to rush forward and not cower from any difficulties. However, all that had completely left her mind right now. It was as if it had succumbed to immorality: she just enjoyed the physical satisfaction just like him and did not think deeper into it.</p>
<p>A chill of pleasure and goosebumps spread all over her skin. Her brea$t$ were flopping around due to her shaking body. She buried his face into her chest, a wave of dizziness encompassing her senses. Her face was burning red-hot; her pr!v@tes felt like they were gently melting.</p>
<p>“Ah! No more… No—”</p>
<p>“More, more… Ack! F!ck! Just a bit more—”</p>
<p>Lune, who was close to the edge, clenched his teeth. It looked like he was probably desperately trying to hold in. It was clear he wanted to feel the 0rg@sm even just a bit longer. He could feel her body was trembling, spasming underneath him. He too was shaking, his face soaked with rapture. He looked genuinely happy, she had never seen such joy in his face..</p>
<p>Soon, the long 0rga$m concluded. He gripped her shoulder firmly and shook.</p>
<p>“Haaa….”</p>
<p>Their bodies were covered with sweat and bodily fluids. He had already come but she didn’t know if he would stop.</p>
<p>“Stop… we’ve arrived,” he said.</p>
<p>“Lune—”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. Stay still”</p>
<p>He still had her sitting on his thighs. It looked awfully 0bscene… their n@ked bodies and bare pr!v@tes twisted amongst each other. She quickly grabbed her scattered dress and covered her pr!v@tes but could still vividly feel something sloshing around inside her. The carriage had arrived, but she couldn’t get out in this state so she waited for a bit.</p>
<p>However, when she felt his r0d slowly getting hard she knew he wasn’t done. She drew a sharp breath. His rock hard sh@ft was hot.</p>
<p>“—Lune—”</p>
<p>“Hold on tight.”</p>
<p>Viola let in a big breath as he started shaking his body like an animal. He penetrated her chaotically and intensely. She felt like she’d faint just from the force of his movements.</p>
<p>Her legs opened wider even though his movements made her whole body tired. Her body heartlessly kept reacting to the stimulus given by his massive m@nh00d. In the end, she couldn’t stand the pleasure any longer and mo@ned.</p>
<p>“Euk! Ah! Ack! Ahhh!”</p>
<p>“A little more, a little…!”</p>
<p>Her endurance had run out. She scratched his back with her nails; panting heavily she hung tightly onto his shoulder under the unbearable pleasure.</p>
