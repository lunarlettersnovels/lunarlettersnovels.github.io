            <p><strong>Chapter 177</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“Lune… Let me finish. If I go to God, this curse will end. Do you remember the negotiations made with the ancestral emperor? Once the virgin is sent to God, the oath is fulfilled.”</p>
<p>“——” He licked his lips.</p>
<p>She calmly continued talking to him. “The fate beyond that is not certain. We will make that destiny. Just like how the parchment predicted that the negotiation will end, the curse will also no longer pass on to our children.”</p>
<p>His eyes trembled without focus. Soon after, his shoulders slumped. His eyes were also watery. Viola held back a scream as she forced a smile.</p>
<p>“Can I not see it? The wound in my heart? I may lose you forever and my aching heart is…. Khhh….”</p>
<p>He spilled out those words, putting his hand on my chest. His chin trembled and he vomited those words in a pained voice. In a frenzy, he shook his head and convulsed in agony.</p>
<p>“I am also in pain. It is agonizing. But even so, the people who ultimately must make the decision to protect our country and subjects are the emperor and empress, isn’t that so?”</p>
<p>“Viola….”</p>
<p>“Do not show that you’re weak. You said it yourself, didn’t you? That you have the power to face God… So finish the negotiations and come find me. Once the negotiations are finished, we’ll still have a chance.”</p>
<p>He hesitated. His cries died down little by little. She could feel that he was giving in to her. He used his fist to press down on his lips. It was as if he knew what Viola was about to say.</p>
<p>“If he tries to kiss you….”</p>
<p>A deep sigh came out.</p>
<p>“He cannot touch me. I have a very powerful army to protect me.”</p>
<p>Viola grabbed Lustian’s hand and brought it to her lower belly. He flinched before closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. Before he knew it, the hasty tone in his voice was gone and he started speaking gently.</p>
<p>“…My son….”</p>
<p>“He is the one who will hide me from God. This child will protect me. Even with His divine powers, it cannot be helped that I have this advantage. And if it turns out that the child’s powers aren’t enough, I will chop his head off.” Viola chuckled. “I do not intend to joke around at a time like this… Edward is in God’s territory.”</p>
<p>He was surprised. “Ed-Edward? How… did he end up there?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He isn’t alone, so do not worry and please reconsider.”</p>
<p>“…I shall think about it.”</p>
<p>His voice was powerless, but it was as if he had half-given up. Viola kissed his lips. <em>Smooch.</em> The soft kiss conveyed desperation to bring out his determination…</p>
<p>“Make a decision before the night ends.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Two days passed. Lustian could not counteract Viola. Crying tears of blood, he decided to take a time of separation from her. In the end, he followed her ways by preparing the ceremony.</p>
<p>To send the rightful companion to God’s territory, they had to decorate the altar surrounding the lake. After Viola revealed her intentions to go directly to God herself, the rain completely stopped. The skies cleared and it was nothing but sunlight for two days straight.</p>
<p>Just then, Viola came down from the carriage after finishing. The dress she wore was not white but instead red, befitting an empress. Though she was going to God, she intended to show Him who she truly was.</p>
<p>Lustian held her hand and stepped into God’s lake. Before he connected with the territory, he put the ring on her finger. He’d put a special power in the ring.</p>
<p>“I gathered the powers of the magicians. The ring has strong defensive power, so it will be of great help.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I will not take it off my finger.”</p>
<p>“Viola… Will you not take this moment to change your mind?”</p>
<p>Though Lustian tried to make an excursion once again as he put the ring on Viola’s finger, she shook her hand. Then, she gently caressed his cheek.</p>
<p>“I will wait.”</p>
<p>“It won’t be long. Just wait Viola. Even if it takes years and years, I will come find you.”</p>
<p>“Yes… I also don’t want to turn into a flower.”</p>
<p>Their eyes were misty, but they did not cry.</p>
<p>“Viola… Viola… I love you….”</p>
<p>“I love you too. Lune… Mmmm….”</p>
<p>Their lips locked into a kiss. The way they hugged so passionately, not wanting to let go, caused their eyes to well up.</p>
<p>Their final kiss was more powerful than any other kiss. It was full of a desperate sense of hope as their haggard breaths became deeper and deeper. Their tongues were tangling up as they embraced each other more intensely. They sucked on each other’s lips crazily. Whenever their lips parted, they collided once again for more.</p>
<p>They were desperate. At the same time, there was a sublime beauty to it. Even the sight of their parting was stunning. After the short kiss, Lustian fumbled with Viola’s lips. Then, after an oath of love, they let go of each other’s hands.</p>
<p>Then, as soon as he connected with the territory, the lake swayed. There were strong gusts of wind. In the direction that the wind blew, the flowers also swayed faintly. He turned around as if he couldn’t bear to look at the final glimpse he would have of her.</p>
<p>Viola looked at Lustian and slowly moved backwards. Every time she moved her feet, she could feel someone pulling her from under. When the water reached her neck, she screamed with all of her might.</p>
<p>“Lune! You are a special person. You must feel it too, don’t you? Pray to God. He would listen to your prayers.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Splash!</strong></em></p>
<p>Along with that sound, Viola was swallowed whole. Her body was pulled all the way down to the bottom of the lake. She could not handle her breath coming up to her chin.</p>
