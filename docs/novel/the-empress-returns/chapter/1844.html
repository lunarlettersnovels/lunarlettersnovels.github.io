            <p><strong>Chapter 183</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>The present she sent was a sculpture of a beautiful bird. Along with the multi-colored ribbon and round white eyes, the orange feathers extended from its chin to the side of its neck while a distinct red and white adorned its chest.</p>
<p>The sculpture was shaped like a mandarin duck. If a mandarin duck’s partner dies, it will starve itself to death instead of eating the carcass of the other bird. And for this reason, the ancestors regard this as the ultimate display of love.</p>
<p><em>Whenever I looked at this bird, I would think of them both. For the continent, they set an example for a love permitted by the gods. I wish you happiness. You will be receiving another letter.</em></p>
<p>Viola held the letter in her arms. She acted as though it was her own happiness. Just then, she heard the mighty cry of a baby. She got up and walked to the other room.</p>
<p>By now, the baby had stopped crying and the wet nurse was suckling him. Since her milk had run dry 3 months after giving birth, the baby looked to the wet nurse. The baby was sucking on hard. Even just the sight was enough to put a smile on Viola’s face.</p>
<p>He was so cute that she wanted to bite him. His black hair and eyes and concave chin directly resembled Lustian. When the baby stuck his tongue out to express his hunger, Viola stretched out her hand.</p>
<p>“Were you hungry? Yes… My baby… Mommy will hold you.”</p>
<p>Whenever the little one was full, Viola would help him to digest it. When she put him over her shoulders and lightly patted his back, he burped. She patted him for a while and he fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>Just then, Lustian and Wendy came into the room. Judging by their outfits, it looked as though they were sword-training again. Wendy ran up to the crib her little brother was sleeping in and lightly shook it. Viola brushed her hair softly, her loving gaze obvious.</p>
<p>“Mother, I think he’s bigger than he was yesterday! It’s astounding.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Babies grow by the day.”</p>
<p>“He’s so beautiful. Wendy is so happy to have a little brother who’s so beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Edward is beautiful but Wendy is also precious and beautiful.”</p>
<p>Wendy held Viola who held her in her arms and kissed her on the top of her head.</p>
<p>The baby’s name was Edward. It was Lustian’s idea to name him so. Though their last names were different, Edward would go down in history as the greatest emperor of the Arpen Empire. Viola and Lustian intended to raise their children as heirs who would be respected by everyone.</p>
<p>“I should change.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will go.”</p>
<p>Viola looked at Lustian who hadn’t changed yet. Since he was bathing Wendy first, there was a lot of dust on his clothes. It was hilarious seeing him stay away from the baby in case the dust would harm him. Ivan joked that he was a fool when it came to his children, but it really was true.</p>
<p>Viola and Lustian held hands as they walked through the palace. They were happy. It was a dream come true. They could feel each other’s heat even when they made eye contact.</p>
<p>“But have we still not found Anne?” Viola asked.</p>
<p>“That is what they say,” Lustian replied.</p>
<p>“Where could they have gone? It’s so hard to believe that she vanished like the wind.”</p>
<p>The day the negotiation came to fruition, she realized Anne was missing. Many people were shocked at her swift disappearance. When the war was over, word got out that Anne had secretly put something inside the lake. They knew that it was an order from God, but they could not find her.</p>
<p>“If the contract with God is destroyed, what happens to her?” Viola asked.</p>
<p>“Well, it could go either way,” Lustian replied.</p>
<p>“What do you mean….”</p>
<p>Saying that he would change clothes, Lustian led Viola into the garden inside. Then, he locked the door. They were surrounded by walls, and the dome structure of the garden served as the perfect screen. Since it was their own special garden, nobody could come in. He held her by the waist and kissed her on the lips.</p>
<p>His erection was already poking through.</p>
<p>“Viola…!”</p>
<p>“Hah… Wait. Talk to me some more. What happened to Anne?”</p>
<p>“Are you wondering about her?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve heard from everybody but her, which feels strange.”</p>
<p>“As a princess, she did something she never should’ve done. The results of her greediness may be more severe than we are imagining. Ah, or maybe not? Maybe this will be better for her.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“If we can’t find her even after looking everywhere, it meaans she probably went to Arhil.”</p>
<p><em>Is Arhil not the bailiff in charge of the rules of the New World? </em>Viola was astonished.</p>
<p>“They’ll probably be fine living in the New World. They may even be engaging in erotic activity at night… Though that would be a grave punishment for her since she still has feelings for Ivan.”</p>
<p>“… For some reason, I feel like I can’t just say this has nothing to do with me. I feel as though our fates have switched.”</p>
<p>This was true. If the plan had failed, she would’ve become like Anne, missing Lustian for the rest of her life. Thanks to their regulations, God could no longer interfere with the human world. Even so, Viola grew more and more worried.</p>
<p>Lustian kissed her hand.</p>
<p>“I am God. Judith… They will never put my land in danger as long as I am in control. And once we’re done with our mortal lives, we will go up to the New World.”</p>
<p>“Is that alright? Is it right to be happy like…?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“I suppose Grand Duke Ivan will be alone now. Tch….”</p>
<p>“He will find another love. He was blind to true love.”</p>
<p>“Yes! That is true.”</p>
