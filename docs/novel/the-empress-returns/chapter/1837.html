<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 69 – Changes (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>When she would scrunch her face in discomfort, he would loosen his grip, but if she tried to escape at that moment, he would tighten it again quickly. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t win against him in terms of strength. Finally, she decided she would have to wait until he let her go.</p>
<p>With her eyes wide open, Viola watched Lustian, who still had his eyes closed.</p>
<p><em>Why am I facing him?</em> She sought to turn away from him but noticed that his lower body seemed to be moving slightly. This worried her, that he might try to initiate s*x as soon as her back was turned to him. As such, without a recourse she remained in the same position. The best she could do was to prevent her b*s*ms from touching him by placing her hands between their chests…</p>
<p><em>…Why is he acting like this? If he’s finished with his business, shouldn’t he get the hell out of here?</em></p>
<p>She stared daggers at him for a moment. Then her gaze travelled to his cheek.</p>
<p><em>Has it really completely healed?</em></p>
<p>That moment, her mind was not in her control to say the least about her emotions. Upon making the mistake of drawing her blade against him in a desperate attempt at vengeance, she had regretted not being able to rein in her own emotions. Now, in hindsight, she was certain that if she were to trace back to that moment somehow, she would refrain from committing the same mistake again. However, since he had reappeared without so much as a scratch, she felt a weight lift off her shoulders. But that didn’t mean her anger and hate had disappeared. This man was the leader of the Blood Army instrumental in Edward’s death…</p>
<p>Viola bit her lip and squeezed her eyes shut. But moments later, without realizing it, she had already opened her eyes again to look at his face. As his black hair was tousled by the breeze coming in from somewhere, his sharp features came into view.</p>
<p>Black hair, dark eyebrows, a perfect nose. The tightly closed lips under were cold and intimidating, but he was beautiful. <em>How many women had seen this face and fallen for him? The saying that princesses loved him was likely the truth. Since they would have all had that first night with him…</em></p>
<p>She thought of Princess Anne and the other princesses who had participated in the o*gy with the imperial family.</p>
<p><em>He’s probably slept with all of them, right?</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt as if hot coals were in her stomach. This abrupt feeling of disconcert that threatened to overwhelm her was so foreign that she knew not what to do.</p>
<p><em>What is this emotion…?</em></p>
<p>She didn’t love this man in the first place, so it didn’t matter what kinds of women he slept with.</p>
<p><em>This man is just choosing a crown princess. No, he’s using that as an excuse to treat princesses like his toys… </em>She felt sure that the only reason he had noticed her, the only reason he sought after her and not one of his concubines, was simply in pursuit of s*xu*l satisfaction.</p>
<p>Suddenly she felt repulsed by the sight of him, she tilted her head down and away. In doing so, she discovered some teeth marks on his shoulder.</p>
<p><em>…Oh my. I-is that from me?</em></p>
<p>Last night, as he was entering her, she had bitten him to try to hold in her m*ans. She had done that every time but she’d never noticed any marks like this. <em>Was it because she felt more self-conscious in the waiting room and tried harder to stay silent?</em> No, she couldn’t remember whether she’d m*aned, screamed or not.</p>
<p>All she had been able to do was take in the pleasure he delivered to her, immersing her whole body to a quaking peak. This memory kept tickling her heart every time it flitted past her mind. At the same time, her cheeks reddened and scenes that she didn’t want to remember kept revisiting her. She shook her head back and forth to try to clear them away.</p>
<p>Right then, a large hand took her chin and tilted it upwards. Her eyes met with his own that were dancing with l*st. His lower body was already getting into position against her.</p>
<p>“One… one time has already passed.” Her voice was lower than she had intended.</p>
<p>“That’s yesterday.” He looked deep into her eyes. “Today is a new day.”</p>
<p>“What?” She was taken aback.</p>
<p>“You want it too, don’t you?” A sly glint flashed through those dark eyes.</p>
<p>“What are you, saying… Ah! H-hey!”</p>
<p>Without a preamble, his hands swiftly slid between her thighs. Viola flinched in surprise.</p>
<p><em>When… did my body change so much like this?!</em></p>
<p>He gently caressed the wet petals with his fingers, then put those fingers in his own mouth. Then he smiled, showing his white teeth. His smile was so beautiful that Viola found herself stunned; a hammering in her chest was prevalent. She forced the corners of her mouth downwards. He kissed her slightly trembling cheek. At the same time, his hand grabbed one of her legs and wrapped it around his waist.</p>
<p>“You know, we can do it lying down sideways too. I’ll teach you one step at a time, so get excited.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>In her anger, she stuffed bread into her mouth and swallowed it without any sense of etiquette, then huffingly sliced the lamb meat on her plate into tiny, tiny pieces. She cut it into so many small pieces that the piece of meat was no longer recognizable. The maid who had been watching her was shocked, such was the ferocity of Viola’s mood.</p>
<p>Rosha took away her plate of mangled meat and replaced it with a new plate of food. No sooner than the new plate was placed before her, she dove in with the same intention but then suddenly froze mid-way.</p>
<p>“Have you been well?”</p>
<p>“Y-you—”</p>
<p>A completely unexpected person entered the dining room and sat in the seat next to hers. Viola shot him a sharp look.</p>
<p>“Woah, calm down! If you make a ruckus here, it’s only to your disadvantage.” The visitor warned with a genteel smile.</p>
<p>“Who are you, who has been pretending to be the crown prince this whole time?” Viola bore daggers at him with her gaze.</p>
<p>“Ah, has my introduction come too late?”</p>
<p>The man stood from his seat and came up next to her, taking her hand and kissing the back of it. This was simply a courteous gesture but the place where his lips had touched her felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“The Second Prince of the Arpen Empire, Grand Duke Ivan Carl Ellaime. And by the way, I only followed my brother’s orders. I’m the one that’s been used here.”</p></div>
