            <p><strong>Chapter 147</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>Lustian bit her lower lips. It was such a lewd kiss that her eyes were popping out. His touch that was storming without rest made the inside of her core shake uncontrollably. The point where they joined was wet with juices making sounds at every thurst. Viola was too busy to even breathe in. He took her hands and had them wrap around the back of his neck.</p>
<p>Both their hips twisted and m*ans emerged.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>As they were passionately making love, in God’s realm, there was a god with silver hair that was cut off here and there.</p>
<p>His eyes were aggressive. The eyes that were staring at them was so dangerous that it would make one’s skin tremble. He let out a cold smile while sending them a heartless stare. He cracked His knuckles.</p>
<p>Another man appeared in the space he was at. He was a god wearing the same white clothing and had long silver hair too. He crossed his arms, looked at the back of the other god, and scoffed. Then the god that had his hair cut turned around.</p>
<p>“Is this funny? Even though I miss my partner in front of my eyes?”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be so jealous. Those two are couples made by the God of fate… Tsk….”</p>
<p>Another god, who was standing with a stern expression, tapped him lightly. Then around Him came out rainbow aura. He ground His teeth.</p>
<p>“How dare… To challenge me as a human… I cannot forgive! The Arpen Empire will disappear forever. Lustian…!!!”</p>
<p>“God can only allow interfering with a human’s history up to this point. You should no longer be involved, I’m sure Your Majesty knows too well….”</p>
<p>“That face that’s just making fun of me, I will rip that one day.”</p>
<p>“Hm, I wonder if you could? Beautiful Lune who could even steal the heart of a god? Hahaha. No, if you do there will be a consequence. Even though he’s a human, he is an important person.”</p>
<p>The god that had his hair cut turned around annoyed. When he did, there were two gods on top of the hill looking over painfully. He was observing the god just in case he was thinking something else.</p>
<p>“This had to be some sort of fate too. Or else there was no way Edward could be in the realm of gods.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>A noble lady that came into the temple in the dark could be seen. She was covering herself with a dark robe, but the sound of clothing being dragged on the floor echoed in the quiet temple. The place she went so busily was waited upon by a Grand Priest and Grand Wizard.</p>
<p>Annoyed, Anne took off her robe.</p>
<p>“We’ve failed. His Majesty didn’t open the door the realm of gods so the power of God didn’t reach of the realm of humans.”</p>
<p>“…. I’m not someone to give up just because of this.”</p>
<p>They were responsible for this. They had a plan to have the god come to the realm of humans through the river as Lustian was distracted by Wendy. But he saved Viola in a short amount of time and God missed His timing.</p>
<p>“It was a hard made opportunity… but it’s no use. His Majesty would never send the empress near the lake anymore.”</p>
<p>“Then, what happens? We have to wait for the destruction of the Arpen Empire?”</p>
<p>“…We can’t let that happen. I’ll suggest to the two of them.”</p>
<p>Anne stood up as if she couldn’t take this anymore.</p>
<p>“Let me meet God.”</p>
<p>“…. Pardon?! Duchess! That’s….”</p>
<p>“I have to meet Him personally, and ask to end this once and for all.”</p>
<p>The Grand Priest and the Grand Wizard turned white as they looked at each other. For a human to meet a god was as dangerous as putting their lives on the line. A human could only meet God at the brink of death. But Anne had already started a dangerous gamble. Even if her life was in danger, she had no intention of stopping.</p>
<p>“Everything has a cost. You know that well right?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” Anne lifted her head.</p>
<p>The the Grand Priest nodded. “The emperor of this empire must be changed. The moment the emperor ignored the obligation from God, he lost his right as an emperor. I must become the empress of this empire. What will you do? Since you two are already deep into my plan, I’m sure you know your life isn’t safe?”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>To ignore the emperor’s order was treason. Even if it was to listen to the will of the late emperor, the dead emperor’s order cannot be a priority over the current one.</p>
<p>Time passed silently. As the answer was already decided, Anne had a big smile on her face. Since she had enough evidence to hold onto their lives, if they happened to betray her, she was ready to die with them.</p>
<p>“Ok. We will do our best to help you become the empress. At the same time, I agree to put Duke Ivan as the emperor. I will publicize information regarding God’s Companion. Every noble, peasant, and the entire Slovenia Continent will hear the rumour. If we pressure him, His Majesty will no longer be able to keep God’s Companion.”</p>
<p>Anne had a faint smile on her lip as the Grand Priest gave a satisfying answer. She looked at the Grand Wizard. “I want to hear your answer, Grand Wizard. Will you listen to the late emperor’s will?”</p>
<p>“The late emperor’s will is… To send the lady that was pointed out as God’s Companion to God. If that is the only way… Then I agree. But, I disagree with crowning a new emperor.”</p>
<p>Anne scoffed.</p>
<p>“It would be a different story if His Majesty Lustian took the crown off himself? Hohoho. Fine. I just need your will to be there. No one would want the Arpen Empire to become bloody by fighting against a god.”</p>
<p>The Grand Priest took Anne’s side for certain. The Grand Priest that followed God’s words than the emperor’s thought it was more important to keep the promise made with God. As Anne was able to bring the Grand Wizard to her side unexpectedly, she felt like she just got a huge army. A face was full of smiles, she was readying to meet God as she waited for the next time.</p>
<p>“Contact me when we’re ready to meet the God of Judith. I will put my life on the line without hesitation.”</p>
