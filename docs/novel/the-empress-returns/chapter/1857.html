            <p><strong>Chapter 170</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p><em>‘Ed… Edward! Brother!’</em></p>
<p><em>How…</em></p>
<p>When Edward said something to God, He became angry and disappeared by stirring up a wave. The wave enveloped her brother’s body. He looked at her and smiled warmly.</p>
<p><em>[Go on. To your place…]</em></p>
<p><em>Edward! Thank you! Really… thank you so much!</em></p>
<p>All Viola wanted was to run into his arms at once, but she didn’t have any time. Spirits were rushing her. She ran like crazy. Her nervous feet staggered, but she ran and ran without care. Goosebumps laced the back of her neck and her clasped hands were freezing. It felt like time was passing too slowly. She became extremely sensitive, but still ran on full alert. Cold sweat trickled down her back. Without even realizing it, tears flowed out of her eyes.</p>
<p><em>‘A little more… more…’</em></p>
<p>Tears blocked her view. <em>If only I run a bit more, I will connect with my world.</em></p>
<p><em>[Stretch your hand! Viola! You can’t be trapped here!]</em></p>
<p>When she saw the forest in front of her, gritting her teeth, she threw herself towards it. She shut her eyes. Momentarily, she felt a warm embrace from there. She breathed unevenly. Then, a familiar touch stroked her back, and let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“You came back. You’re alright… Viola, everything’s okay… now that you’re here…”</p>
<p>“Lune…”</p>
<p>“Reckless as always. No one can stop my empress.”</p>
<p>When Viola raised her head covered with sweat and tears, Lustian was smiling at her. Before she knew it, her surroundings plunged into darkness. The high moon was shining down on the waiting couple. She was crying like a child. At that, he took her into his arms and comforted her like a child.</p>
<p>“I heard about your dream from Paul. Now you can stop worrying.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if I worried you… But it was clear as day that you would be against this… So I made a decision on my own.</p>
<p>“Whatever you do is right. But, except that.”</p>
<p>“Lune!”</p>
<p>He hugged her shoulders as if crushing her. He said it was alright, but how worried he must have been…</p>
<p>“But how did I overcome the crisis? Suddenly God was angry and it felt like He was ascending to His world.”</p>
<p>“I think I’ve caused some trouble.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the wind carried the smell of something burning. Viola’s body was terrified because of black smoke rising into the western sky. It was the old temple.</p>
<p>“I destroyed his statue and set fire to the old temple. He must have fled with fear.”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>A light shiver grazed her body. Lustian’s action of destroying the statue and setting fire to the temple to challenge God scared her. She didn’t know the reason He was infuriating God so much. Of course, he was not someone to recklessly pursue things without taking measures, but Viola felt dizzy.</p>
<p>“So, did you bring the map?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! This is the map.” She held out the map for him.</p>
<p>His eyes widened looking at it.</p>
<p>“This is not a map of Slovenia Continent, can you see it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can. It’s not just a map but also a breakthrough strategy.”</p>
<p>“Strategy? But there’s not a word written here.”</p>
<p>When Viola looked at it, there were only drawings on the map, with no strategy written on it. She was surprised when a blue flame flashed through Lustian’s eyes.</p>
<p><em>By any chance, is it the magic… that’s used here? How could I be seeing letters, that’s not visible to others?</em></p>
<p>Lustian’s lips blossomed into a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t think this is only communicating with God’s Companion. The owner of this map is God, not the Maiden.”</p>
<p>“God? We’re at war with God, so I don’t understand why He would write a strategy on this map.”</p>
<p>That was an apt question. All eyes now faced Lustian. He held the map in his hands and uttered unknown words to people looking at him strangely.</p>
<p>“We’ll find out when the time comes. The reason why this map came into my hands will be clear then.”</p>
<p>“Can we trust you?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Busy times are coming. If we want to implement this plan, we’ll need a lot of wizards.”</p>
<p>“There is a possibility for us to succeed, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Lustian planted a kiss on Viola’s forehead and told her to relax over and over again. Gently stroking her underbelly, he whispered affectionately, “You protected your mother! I’m so proud of you, my son.”</p>
<p>“Lune…”</p>
<p>He crouched and brought his ear to Viola’s stomach. It was an act of losing face for an Emperor, but no one frowned upon it. Everyone enjoyed the view of the sweet couple with hopeful faces. When Viola caressed his beautiful black hair, he smiled glancing up.</p>
<p>“We should go. You must be tired. Let’s ride my horse.”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>He helped her onto his horse and mounted behind her himself. He glanced at Kyle. “Kyle, gather all the heads of knights at noon tomorrow. We must hold a strategic meeting. Oh, and, bring Crown Princes from other countries gathered at the Star Palace. We can’t plan this strategy alone.”</p>
<p>Lustian pulled the reins to the empress’s palace. The sound of the horseshoe from the black horse kicking vigorously rang through the quiet forest.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>At that time, God of the Divine World looked angrily as he saw his statue broken into pieces and the temple with only the frame left. His burning red face was seconds away from bursting. His face muscles clumped and distorted.</p>
<p>“Is he crazy? Surely that bastard must have gone crazy.”</p>
