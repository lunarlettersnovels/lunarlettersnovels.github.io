            <p><strong>Chapter 179</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>He took that road to head to God’s territory. He wrapped a robe around himself and took the lonely road. The path was treacherous with the rough sandstorms that hit him. In every town he passed by, he gathered up groups of girls to sing with him.</p>
<p>[The Lament of the Virgin]…</p>
<p>Since the virgin had become a flower, he could not recognize her, but thanks to the help of the Fairy of Wind, she was always by his side.</p>
<p><em>‘It is me. I am right here. I rode along with the winds. My love… My love… Do you not see me?</em>’</p>
<p>Her heart ached to see him unable to hear her no matter how loud her screams were. As soon as the fairy caused strong gusts of wind, she could ride along with his hair and reach his lips. The flower reached his cold lips. A heart as cold as a sheet of ice… The man who waited for reincarnation after throwing half of my heart in the river…</p>
<p><em>‘Though I may not remember you… you will, won’t you? Should I reincarnate despite my fears? Once I look into your eyes, I’ll be able to dive for you, won’t I? No matter how much of our memories are gone and how much our appearances will have changed… our hearts will burn together like fire. Is that not true? I shall… go now. Judith… I shall be reborn as someone of the greatest value and become your partner. Until then, let us endure this pain.’</em></p>
<p>The flower that stayed with him was taken away by the wind.</p>
<p>He got up again and walked and walked on the desert. Just then, he met the Emperor of the Arpen Empire who was wandering aimlessly. Judith made a negotiation with him.</p>
<p><em>‘…The virgin shall be born as a woman of the greatest value. She shall pass through God’s barrier, enter the territory, and be a woman who will be able to bear my child. Finding that woman is how one must determine God’s Companion.’</em></p>
<p>After making the negotiation, he disappeared. With the help from the Goddess of Love, he had the chance to meet the virgin again, but someone who would alter their fates would appear.</p>
<p>He was the bailiff who determined the rules of the New World. He changed the negotiation made with Judith.</p>
<p><em>‘The New World’s rules are strict… and those who break them must never be forgiven. This includes the gods who made love with humans or humans who made the gods while being aware of their identities. They will all pay. Once you find the virgin, this is your final duty as you’re sent to the territory.’</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>She had an old dream.</p>
<p>Viola felt somebody touching her forehead. The warmth and familiar scent seeped into her nostrils. She smiled. Since it was the warmth she longed for, she felt as though she would burst into tears.</p>
<p><em>‘Older brother… Edward…</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Viola opened her eyes. It really was Edward that she ran into. He tapped on her cheeks lightly and smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“Sleepyhead, are you finally awake?”</p>
<p>“Older brother! It was… a dream? Is it really you?”</p>
<p>Viola hugged Edward tight. Just then, he’d patted her back and smiled. It was like a dream. She couldn’t believe that she was talking to him face-to-face. She felt the happiness of the temporary reunion.</p>
<p>“More than anything, I’d like to know how long I’ve been asleep.”</p>
<p>“A day.”</p>
<p>“How long is that in the human world?”</p>
<p>“I think it has been a week.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Wendy! Is Wendy alright? Is this where the negotiation with God ends?”</p>
<p>“Wendy is alright. She is awake. As soon as the negotiations made between the empire and the imperial family were over, the curse also disappeared.”</p>
<p>Viola’s heart was so overwhelmed that it was aching. Considering Wendy and her subjects were safe and sound, could she be any happier?</p>
<p>“That is such a relief. Truly….”</p>
<p>She suddenly thought of Lustian. Since it had been a week, he must’ve been intending to carry out his plan with the help of God’s map. <em>Could there be a setback to his plan?</em> Viola looked around.</p>
<p>“Where is this place?”</p>
<p>“His castle.”</p>
<p>“By Him, do you mean….”</p>
<p>“It’s Judith’s sanctuary. It lost its owner, but it indeed is God’s castle.”</p>
<p>“Ah, then. It must’ve been… Judith who was reincarnated in the form… of Lune? Is that what happened?”</p>
<p>Edward nodded his head. Viola got up and looked out the window. They saw the Lake of God below.  Lake of God! <em>It’s the same land.</em></p>
<p>“It isn’t the same land. It’s just a projection of the same image, but once you’re here, you cannot escape through your own means.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so.”</p>
<p>“Is he alright?”</p>
<p>“He’s fighting the best he can. It’s already been four years.”</p>
<p>Viola was stuck in the tower. Since it was the highest tower, she couldn’t move an inch.</p>
<p>Then it happened. As if her awakening was felt, the door opened. A short man with silver hair went up to her. As soon as Viola saw him, she felt hostile. In case he would reach his hand to her body, she was on guard.</p>
<p>“The negotiation is over. Now please accept our love.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think only 200 years suffice as punishment? The punishment for breaking the vow starts now.”</p>
<p>“The God of Judith chose to give up His path and become a human instead. What more is needed? Are you only satisfied if you tear us apart?”</p>
<p>“This is the rule. He reincarnated as a human while being aware of this fact.”</p>
