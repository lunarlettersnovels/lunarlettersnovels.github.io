            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 62 – Trapped (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Inside the closet, Paul kept doubting his own eyes.</p>
<p>The one who had kissed Viola… <em>it had been Prince Lustian. The one who kissed the Viola… It was Prince Lustian!</em></p>
<p>Paul, for a moment, had almost revealed himself and ran out to him from his hiding spot. He wanted to use the opportunity as he was kissing her to slice his throat. His anger seethed within him. The person with the contract marriage with Viola was the crown prince…</p>
<p><em>Why! Why? Why did he lie to Viola about his identity and make a false deal with her…?</em></p>
<p>Harking back to everything Viola had said, he arrived at the conclusion that the crown prince could be aware of Edward’s death and that he was Viola’s brother. Lustian, the commander of the Blood Army… <em>If he had fallen for Viola from the beginning, he wasn’t one to reveal his weakness.</em></p>
<p><em>This… If this is what happened… What’s going on?</em></p>
<p><em>This meant that through his trickery Viola had entered a contract marriage with a partner she hated… who killed her own flesh and blood.</em></p>
<p>Had he revealed his identity as the crown prince, it would have ended with their first night and with her being locked up in the Concubines’ Palace… But this way they could be int*m*te continuously allowing the innocent Viola to come to know him.</p>
<p>Paul’s body twitched. He glared fiercely at Lustian, who was at the top of this elaborate ruse.</p>
<p><em>Is this really your motive? You want to make her body’s affection into her heart’s, but you are mistaken… The princess’s love for Prince Edward’s is bigger than you think!</em></p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>Deep into the night, Viola pulled herself out of bed and left the bedroom. She could see Paul’s shadow as the living room was lit by the long silver moonlight permeating through the room.</p>
<p>The most loyal knight of Koronis quietly whispered in Viola’s ear, her face turned pale… her lips trembled. In that semblance of rationality, she ordered Paul to quickly get out of there. Then, she walked towards the table and took out the dagger she had hidden beneath it.</p>
<p>The dagger etched with a dragon on it was the voucher given to her by the king. She unsheathed and held it to the moonlight. The edge of the knife was sharp- sharp enough to easily cut with the slightest force.</p>
<p>Viola staggered into the bedroom. The air reeked of their co*tal affairs. The bed was filled with traces of their intense s*x. She stared at the soundly slumbering Lune and put the knife on his neck. That was when he suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“You found out?… That I’m the crown prince….”</p>
<p>Her hand moved before he could reveal he was the crown prince with his own mouth. She heard the blade cut through the air, he had quickly dodged the knife.</p>
<p>“Lustian!”</p>
<p>Viola wasn’t in her right mind. She could clearly see Edward’s death whenever she laid eyes on him and she wanted revenge.</p>
<p>It hurt so much!</p>
<p>It was he that was cut by the sharp dagger but it felt like she was the one hurt. She didn’t hesitate. She had hated and resented the Blood Army to the bone, so it felt only natural for her to point her weapon at him. However, she couldn’t reach his heart, his movements were so agile that they were imperceptible to her.</p>
<p>He rushed towards her as soon as Viola fell back. It was a thousand times faster than her mind could react. His movements were swift like a beast.</p>
<p>“Let go! Let go of me!”</p>
<p>She tried to wrest free as she felt the fluffy bed touch and wrap around her body. He tightly grabbed her wrists and coldly glared at her.</p>
<p>His black hair was stuck to his cheek, the eyes under his hair flashing. She discovered blood trickling down his cheek. She suddenly started laughing like a madwoman. She couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>“There, have you been compensated by wounding my face for deceiving you?”</p>
<p>“No! That’s not good enough!”</p>
<p>Red blood dripped onto Viola’s face. She laughed even harder. She felt relieved, seeing the sharp cuts on his beautiful face. It was that face that had shaken her and captivated her eyes. She felt a fire burning up from inside her.</p>
<p><em>The princesses were captivated by that face and fell in love with him. And behind him was the world’s most powerful… The one who led the Blood Army that intimidated the small kingdoms… was none other than him.</em></p>
<p>“The son of the Emperor of Blood, Prince Lustian… You are just like the present emperor, cruel!”</p>
<p>“Even so, you’re my wife… Crown Princess.”</p>
