            <p><strong>Chapter 28 – Risky Bravado</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Livyuna</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p><em>Proofreader: Livyuna</em></p>
<p>Lune’s hawkish eyes seemed to be piercing her. His longing gaze made her feel n@ked even though she was fully dressed; she was nervous under his sweeping gaze that blatantly traversed her entire body.</p>
<p>Viola cleared her throat and gulped.</p>
<p>“To think you hid this face …. If the crown prince were to see it, he would never have let go,” his raspy voice broke the silence.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“If you had blond hair, you would perfectly match the prince’s tastes,” he added.</p>
<p>Particularly because his burning gaze seemed to say they couldn’t keep themselves off her, she held her tongue about her blond hair.</p>
<p>The thing that she most wanted to do right now was to indulge in the ridiculous fancy of asking <em>‘If you are interested in me, would you marry me? Please, make me a secondary wife.’ </em>She was also humouring the thought of him using his power to execute the mission she received from the king.</p>
<p>Lune trudged towards her and hugged Viola by the waist and looked into her eyes. She saw his fiery burning eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to give you to the crown prince.”</p>
<p>Viola’s eyes widened in surprise. “What are you saying? You’re making dangerous comments—”</p>
<p>He pressed his lips down, invading her mouth with his tongue and completely sealing her words. He then grabbed her head with both hands and began a long and hard kiss. It was hasty and wild, as if he had been enduring the urge for a long time now.</p>
<p>She was shocked. At this moment … the man that was kissing her was …</p>
<p>“… Wait a minute…. You—”</p>
<p>Her lips were locked with his again. She couldn’t speak, he wouldn’t let her. Viola was overwhelmed and at a loss. She couldn’t believe she would get kissed a second time. His actions were too abrupt that she didn’t have enough time to take out the dagger hidden on her thigh.</p>
<p>Their tongues entangled with each other. It was hot. Everywhere his lips touched seemed to sizzle. He kissed her as if he wanted to burn her soul and body to the ground. The burning heat seemed to constantly permeate through her body. Her shoulders curved back.</p>
<p>He changed angles frantically and grabbed Viola’s thin waist with his large hand and sucked on her lips. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that he ate her lips whole. He pulled on the root of her tongue and sweetly wrapped her tongue with his. Viola, as she was being ambushed with a kiss for a second time, again thought of foolish things.</p>
<p>‘<em>Seeing that this guy keeps kissing me, isn’t he for sure interested in me?</em> <em>Should I ask him to make a deal? If you don’t want the crown prince to have me, can you propose to me first?’</em></p>
<p>Her head was so hot it felt like her brain was melting. He swept across the roof of her mouth, passed through her teeth, and sweetly s*cked on her pink tongue. Lustian would hug her even tighter every time she tried to sit down because her body had no strength.</p>
<p>She turned her head, she couldn’t breathe because his thick tongue filled her mouth. It seemed he would give her no respite, as he grabbed her chin and took her lips into his again. Viola pulled her hips back when his warm hands wandered towards her peaks. But Lustian merely narrowed the gap and stuck his lower body to hers, his hard m*mber rubbed on her belly button, almost scalding her as if it were molten honey.</p>
<p>Her vision flashed. <em>L*st!</em></p>
<p>It was certainly that. It looked like her body could certainly be used to make a deal seeing how his own got excited for hers.</p>
<p>‘<em>What do I do? What should I do? Think! Viola! Just think of one single idea. You don’t want to live horribly like the princesses earlier, do you?</em>’</p>
<p>She wanted to avoid being a plaything of the imperial family by any means. Viola snapped open her eyes and gently grasped his shoulders with her hands that were wandering in the air.</p>
<p><em>If I have to let a man do it once anyway, let’s use it on this man that is willing to help me …</em></p>
<p>Lune’s touch made her short of breath. He grasped her thin waist with one hand and touched her peaks over her dress with the other. Viola jumped up abruptly.  No matter how much she wrapped it with bandages, she could clearly feel his touch. She swallowed her breath.</p>
<p>“Ha—”</p>
<p>He grabbed her hair., kissed and sucked on her tongue so intensely the root of her tongue tingled. His long eyelashes that were slightly up, shook precariously.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute—” she tried to speak.</p>
<p>“After a kiss,” he cut her off.</p>
<p>He poked through into her mouth and even licked the saliva stuck in it. He sucked hard as if he did not want to leave a single drop behind. Her chest swelled up. Her body, unlike her head, was gradually getting aroused.</p>
<p>She had long past her coming of age ceremony. Could she give her first-time to a man she liked a little bit? <em>S3x drive … What an illogical thing …</em></p>
<p>He not only was dazzlingly beautiful, but also had a strong body. She had thought so the first time she saw his naked body but everywhere she touched was firm. His thing below that was even harder made her even dizzier …</p>
<p>Viola let out a silent scream and came to her senses. ‘<em>Don’t think of anything else. Viola, talk to him. Use him!</em>‘</p>
<p>Viola squeezed out all her remaining strength and pushed him away, breathing  raggedly. He looked at her as if he hadn’t expected that.</p>
<p>“How much of what you said was serious?” she demanded.</p>
<p>“All of it.”</p>
<p>She leveled her limpid eyes on him. “Well then, I need to also hear why you kissed me.”</p>
<p>“I feel clear when I kiss you. I feel like the heat inside me disappears. Look at my body, this is the proof.”</p>
<p>“L*st …  you mean you were l*sting after an ugly face?”</p>
<p>“I don’t look at the outside. I’m someone who looks at the inside.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Viola decided to be brave.  The man looked at her as if he would die if he didn’t cool off the heat inside him immediately. It was a reckless thing to do, but left with no other choice, she had to settle with the only option. “All right, I’ll trust you and be honest. I have no intention of becoming a crown princess,” she blurted the truth.</p>
<p>“I guessed so.” He really didn’t seem at all surprised.</p>
<p>“If I make an offer, will you accept the offer?”</p>
<p>“No matter what.”</p>
<p>She was still skeptical over his readiness. “Make a deal with me.”</p>
