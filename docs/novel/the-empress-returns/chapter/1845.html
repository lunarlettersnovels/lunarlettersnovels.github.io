            <p><strong>Chapter 182</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>The bailiff glared at Lustian coldly. “As I said, you are merely a human. If you thought you had divine strength, you were severely mistaken.”</p>
<p>There was a sound of grinding teeth. In a flash, Arhil dashed up to Lustian with His hands wrapped around his neck.</p>
<p>“I am merely enforcing the law. Do not think that 200 years were enough to pay off your debt.”</p>
<p>“…No more nonsense. I have another chance with the help of the Goddess of Love, and I found my love. Since the negotiation is over, I am no longer guilty.”</p>
<p>“I do not intend to let you off. The grudges I hold are too strong.”</p>
<p>“Will the other gods have the same thought?”</p>
<p>Arhil’s eyebrows twitched. Lustian twisted His wrist strongly. The blood flowed nonstop down his chin and dripped to the floor.</p>
<p>Lustian took that opportunity to stab His abdomen with the knife. Just then, Arhil looked at His own body with a pained expression.</p>
<p>“The divine power is coming back. Very quickly, at that….”</p>
<p>“Khhh… Urk… How could someone… who’s been stripped of his identity…?”</p>
<p>Though he tried to take the knife out of His stomach, it would not come out. It was as if it was inside a rock. With a piercing scream, He used all of His strength to pull it out. He was panting and wiping the sweat off of Him. Lustian looked at Him and laughed.</p>
<p>“I was more powerful than you. My memory doesn’t fail me.”</p>
<p>“Judith!!”</p>
<p>He called out Lustian’s name. His mouth was wide open as the power gathered. There were blue flames coming out of His body, while red flames emerged out of Lustian’s body.</p>
<p><em><strong>Du du du…</strong></em> the whole earth shook.</p>
<p>Lustian built a shield for the next attack. That was when it happened. Arhil’s eyes shot open as the injured knights rose up to the sky. Lustian was shocked. That was when their bodies inflated like balloons.</p>
<p>“Face me! No more of your cowardly behavior!”</p>
<p>“They have not seen the last of me. I will turn the woman you love into what I reduced them to…!”</p>
<p>Aside from Paul, Kyle, and Ivan, there were several knights in the Blood Army. Due to the immense pressure, blood gushed out of their mouths and their eyes rolled to the back of their heads. Though Lustian gathered all the strength he had to release them from the attacks, it did not work. Just as He said, it was hard to use his human form to awaken his divine power.</p>
<p>“Arhil!” Lustian yelled, red in the face.</p>
<p>Just then, Arhil went pale. He lost the strength in His body while the knights were released. He looked at His body with a confused expression. It seemed that the arrow that went flying to Him pierced His heart. An arrow as thick as an adult’s arm was stuck in His body. Lustian was visibly surprised. Both of them looked in the direction that the arrow came from.</p>
<p>There stood Viola in a red dress holding the bow.</p>
<p>She was glowing as she stood there with a firm face. Even in the thick sand, her standing tall was nothing short of a mighty king. Even with the ripped dress, the beauty inside of her could not be concealed.</p>
<p>“Do not interfere with our love,” Viola told Arhil in a low voice.</p>
<p>Just then, a gust of wind blew. As it blew through her blonde hair, fairies came trickling down from the sky. They covered her entire body and gathered to sing.</p>
<p>♪ Ahhh! O Maiden! A true love has come true.</p>
<p>The virgin’s love was recognized by God Himself-</p>
<p>Ahhh! Let us sing.</p>
<p>All of us- Let us sing a song for the beautiful God of Judith and the brave virgin-</p>
<p>Let every tongue convey the love they share.</p>
<p>Bless the sublime love that is unchanging even in the face of death- ♪</p>
<p>All over the Slovenia continent, the fanfare celebrating Lustian’s victory would not cease. The Empress was praised for achieving true peace in the continent, and thus, a gift was sent to her.</p>
<p>The ball that celebrated the victory of the Arpen Empire continued for a week. Some very familiar faces arrived at the ball as the people danced joyously. The imperial couple arrived as the valets sent forth a message.</p>
<p>“The great empire’s Emperor Lustian and Empress Viola shall feast!”</p>
<p>As the shimmering couple arrived at the middle of the ballroom, there were exclamations of joy. Everybody gathered to bless their love.</p>
<p>Adhering to the ballroom etiquette, Lustian went up to Viola and kissed her on the hand. Everyone cheered. The two of them held hands and danced to the music. The small petals flew in and danced in a circle as if to pray for a blissful future.</p>
<p>Lustian kissed Viola’s lips. Everyone who watched the deep kiss were overwhelmed with joy.</p>
<p>“Viola….”</p>
<p>“Lune….”</p>
<p>Both of their lips flowed over with happiness. He gave her lips another gentle kiss.</p>
<p><em>– Be with me. Forever. My companion… My bride…</em></p>
