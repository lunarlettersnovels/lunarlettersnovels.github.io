            <p><strong>Chapter 88 – Puzzle Pieces (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Paul sat down on the ground and removed his shirt. The wounds were almost healed, but there were several places where it kept bleeding. Viola took the medicine from her sleeve and spread it onto his back. She could ask Rosha to apply it if she wanted to, but she wanted to do it herself.</p>
<p>Every time she touched the wound, his back flinched slightly. Looking at his broad back and shoulders, various thoughts intricately entwined in her mind. Edward’s and Lustian’s faces alternately flashed through her mind.</p>
<p>She let out a low sigh. He turned his face to look at her. When their eyes met, his face was full of worry. She smiled as she looked at him, her smile full of sadness.</p>
<p>It was then that Paul took Viola’s hand. He kissed the back of her hand, but for some reason, it seemed to convey a meaning other than that of serving King. As his gaze met Viola’s, his eyes were trembling.</p>
<p>“Until the day my life runs out, I will serve you, Princess. And only you, I will—”</p>
<p>“Stop it!”</p>
<p>“Your Highness—”</p>
<p>“Don’t say anymore. You’re like family to me.”</p>
<p>Paul sighed deeply. It wasn’t that she didn’t know his feelings for her. Even Edward would constantly offer him the position of his brother-in-law. During his lifetime, the prince would always pair them together, only half-jokingly. Even though he was a commoner, since he had been knighted, it would not be difficult for him to marry a half-royal. And he was a good man. Even the daughter of the Queen of Koronis was in love with him…</p>
<p>Viola suddenly felt burdened by it all.</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand. Because what Prince Edward asked me to do was to bring you happiness… I won’t cross the line. But my feelings won’t change either.”</p>
<p>“You’ll meet a wonderful woman. A woman much better than the likes of me.”</p>
<p>“To me, you are–”</p>
<p>“Stop. This is too sudden. Are you acting like this because you don’t see how much work we still have to do?”</p>
<p>She covered her ears with her own two hands. She didn’t want to hear a confession from a man that she considered to be her family. But he was showing his feelings to her as if today would be his last day. As her voice rose a little, Paul stopped speaking. He only showed his back to her, bowing his head.</p>
<p>Viola continued reapplying the medicine.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>At that time, Ming, who had been monitoring the surroundings from atop the high roof, perked his ears. His fur stood on end and he tried to make a sound, but instead, he tucked his tail and flattened his small body onto the ground. His whole body trembling, his eyes followed the person that was approaching in his direction.</p>
<p>It was Lustian. His expression as he looked at Paul was quite scary. Overwhelming energy flowed from his body. At the same time, his cold eyes had a look that was near madness, and he glared at the knight. Meanwhile, another person appeared from behind him.</p>
<p>“Oh dear, another rival—”</p>
<p>“Be quiet,” Lustian commanded.</p>
<p>“Are you just going to watch this happen? He looks pretty desperate.”</p>
<p>“Ivan… shut the hell up!”</p>
<p>Lustian’s eyes burned fiercely. His gaze was dark enough to kill someone, but he was holding himself back.</p>
<p>“You’ve definitely changed. For sure… Is it because you love that woman so much?” Ivan remarked.</p>
<p>Lustian turned around and disappeared. Now all alone, Ivan continued to watch the two for a while.</p>
<p>“Well, this is fun. How should I play my hand? I’m wondering—”</p>
<p>As Lustian disappeared, the cat looked at Ivan and tilted his head. Viola’s cat seemed to be unable to make out whether he was an enemy or a friend. Ivan smiled brightly at the cat and stroked his fur.</p>
<p>“I am someone who will help your master. So you don’t need to be nervous.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>After Paul left, Viola hurried to get back to her room. She had snuck out after Lustian had fallen asleep, so she had to return quickly. She had to enter through the window of the tallest tower. She climbed up a tall tree and just barely made it in, lithely crossed the terrace, and went down the wooden stairs.</p>
<p>At that moment, an arm suddenly appeared out of nowhere and grabbed her waist. Her heart jumped into her throat. In the midst of the breathtaking tension, Viola looked up at the man who was holding her waist.</p>
<p>“Did you want to go for a night stroll?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Ah… Lu-Lustian—”</p>
<p>Ming had followed Viola down the stairs and was now standing next to her. Lustian’s gaze alternated between Ming and Viola, then settled to stare at her.</p>
<p>“I purposely only did it one time because I was worried for you, but it seems you had plenty of strength left?”</p>
<p>“Wh-what do you mean?” Viola was genuinely perplexed.</p>
<p>“Since it seems you had enough energy to play with that cat on the roof—”</p>
<p>“Ah! Wa-wait!”</p>
<p>In a flash, Lustian lifted her in his arms. He slung her over his shoulder and started walking in long strides. Viola punched his back with her fists and demanded to be put down, but he didn’t budge.</p>
<p>He opened the first room he came across and threw her onto the bed. Then, loosening his belt and collar, he climbed on top of her. The bed rocked, and Viola swallowed. She couldn’t hide her trembling hands as his beautiful face approached her lips.</p>
<p>The sound of a cat’s meow ringing through the hallway was like a song depicting the beautiful lovemaking between two happy lovers.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>She had nearly died. Really, she had been pushed to the point of thinking that it really was possible to die while having s*x. The bedroom was rife with the smell of s*men. She felt like she had become a lewd woman.</p>
<p>Viola was barely able to open her stiff eyes. She had fallen ill, unable to keep up with Lustian’s beastly energy.</p>
<p>“Take some medicine.”</p>
<p>“Okay—” a wan Viola said.</p>
<p>“He’s so beastly. Even though he doesn’t seem that way—”</p>
<p>Viola’s face reddened at Rosha’s comment. Her own body, which had to keep up with his beastly strength, had gone through a lot as well.</p>
<p>She drank the medicine that Rosha handed her. This was medicine to prevent her from becoming pregnant, so she had to take it every single day. After that, the little maid presented her with a plate of brown biscuits. When she felt exhausted, these treats were extremely effective, so she placed two in her mouth at once and melted them slowly.</p>
<p>“Once I feel better, I think I’ll need to go out for a while. Get ready.”</p>
