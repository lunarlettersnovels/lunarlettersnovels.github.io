            <p><strong>Chapter 113</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“I came here with the two of you in mind. I wish that Princess Wendy lives in the Kingdom of Koronis where they uphold traditional values, instead of the imperial family of the Arpen Empire. I think it would be best if the princess at least went back to the kingdom for succession to the throne,” the nanny said.</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“According to the national royal law, this condition would be allowed. She’s still young, but perhaps after a decade, she would become almost as much of a splendid Lady as the empress.”</p>
<p>“That is likely. Furthermore, she would be intelligent and brave… resembling him…,” Viola remarked.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t be good if Princess Wendy’s identity is revealed.”</p>
<p>“I know. It would actually be dangerous.”</p>
<p>“From what I’ve heard, they kept sending over a spy to assassinate the emperor even during the war. Of course, each time that happened, the spy met his own demise… If word gets out that Princess Wendy is the only line of descent, the one who will be in the most danger is the princess herself.”</p>
<p>Unlike Viola who left the kingdom, the nanny had a lot of information. Viola looked at the nanny intently.</p>
<p>“If you cannot find God’s Companion, this empire will destroy itself. If this country goes under, you and Princess Wendy will have to return to your home country,” the nanny stated the brutal truth.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>As Lustian was going further away from the empress’s palace, he found it difficult to catch his breath. His heart was fluttering and he felt a slight amount of pain. He was worried he would have a seizure in front of Viola, but finally, he was outside.</p>
<p>“Emperor….”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. I just need to rest a bit. Fetch me some medicine.”</p>
<p>Kyle took out some medicine from his clothes. He gulped down the bitter medicine that went down and spread through his throat. He tried his best to manage a relaxed smile as he licked off the residue from the corner of his lips.</p>
<p>“What has become of the borderland?”</p>
<p>“Though we subjugated all of the orcs in sight, we’re in a situation where we don’t know when they’ll strike again. What has become of us… The number of orcs that swooped in on the village multiplied from the number that was subjugated.”</p>
<p>“What is the damage?”</p>
<p>“There was no damage. Aside from the military, an evacuation notice was given out to the villagers, but there are many people trembling in fear. We cannot remain lax even if we won the war.”</p>
<p>“Send over the Blood Army. After ordering them to protect the borderland in person, I will join them.”</p>
<p>“In the state you are in, you intend to go back to the battleground?”</p>
<p>He had become sensitive to the extreme. He was thirsty. An unstoppable desire came over him. He wanted to hold Viola right that instant, but he had to restrain himself.</p>
<p>Since the Great Magician of the Temple was watching over him, he had to be careful. He trusted in God’s oracle. The Arpen Empire was also a nation that served God. Even if the centre of authority was within the scepter, the power of the Temple wasn’t to be belittled.</p>
<p><em>They suspect that Viola helps dilute my curse, but I can’t hold her every time I have a seizure.</em></p>
<p><em>I must hold her…. only when I’m not having a seizure…</em></p>
<p>Viola carried the token of God’s Companion around with her. This satisfied two conditions. She passed through God’s wall and could enter God’s territory. This fact was obtained through interrogating Ivan.</p>
<p>If one more condition was fulfilled… She would be taken away by God.</p>
<p>“Being hostile to God is overdoing it.” Kyle couldn’t help but remind her.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like it isn’t a solution.”</p>
<p>“I’m wondering if that’s possible. There is no man who can forsake such a pledge and challenge God.”</p>
<p>“There is!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t like there wasn’t a solution. Even while Lustian was at war for eight years, he did not neglect his sword practice. He ended up obtaining a power that was second only to that of a master. Even if it was a small mortal power, it wasn’t to be belittled.</p>
<p>“I will emerge victorious in the final battle. Even if Viola is God’s Companion, I can never let her go.” He ground his teeth. “I will never give up. We will never have to part again because of a cruel fate.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p><em><strong>Clink-</strong></em></p>
<p>There was a sound of a plate shattering on the ground. A maid, wary of her surroundings, rushed out of the room. The Grand Duke’s dwelling place never had a day without noise. It was because the Grand Duke’s wife grew more agitated as the days went by.</p>
<p>“How long are you going to wait for?” Anne’s voice was booming. Ivan was sitting in front of her.</p>
<p>“I’m looking for an opportunity. No, maybe there wasn’t a need to look for an opportunity. In any case, only time will heal, so there was no need for bloodshed.”</p>
<p>“Do not lie. Aren’t you just hesitating? What is the reason for this hesitation despite the opportunity to become Emperor?”</p>
<p>Lustian refused to look for God’s Companion. It’s already been eight years of refusing to concede to God’s commands. Due to this, the pontiffs including the high-ranking magicians had endless complaints. Even though God’s blessings hadn’t disappeared yet, the Imperial House grew impatient since they continued sending warnings.</p>
<p>“Can’t you tell from the fact that we haven’t had a child? This is a punishment that the entire imperial family is receiving because the emperor refused to do his duties.”</p>
<p>“…Maybe he has something else in mind.”</p>
<p>“How could you be so easy-going? Could it be that… the reason why you stopped wanting to be Emperor is because of Viola?”</p>
<p>Anne felt heavy-hearted looking at Ivan disinterestedly turning his head away. If one looked at the facts, she was the one who helped him, and yet all she got in return was the cold shoulder. Since she loved him so much, she wanted him to only have eyes for her. However, his unchanging attitude caused their feelings for each other to go cold. Aside from the standard duties that a married couple had to carry out, there was no affection whatsoever.</p>
<p>“I am the Grand Duke’s wife. I am also the one who will become Empress.” Anne glared daggers at the man.</p>
<p>Ivan went up to her, grabbed her chin, and looked her in the eye. “Before I become Emperor, you must change yourself first. Learn from the virtues of a charitable empress. The way you are is so similar to the previous empress, and it brings me discomfort seeing that.”</p>
<p>Then he walked past her, as fast as the wind. Now, there was no concubine to hold him, but even without looking, it was clear that a flirt like him had another lover.</p>
