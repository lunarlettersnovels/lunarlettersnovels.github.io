            <p><strong>Chapter 172</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>A month went by since then. Lustian prepared for the final showdown, and he waited for the soldiers being sent down from each kingdom. His problems started after that.</p>
<p>Kyle hurried frantically into the conference room. He hung his head low. After figuring out what that meant, the emperor’s lips quivered.</p>
<p>“Now it’s the Kingdom of Ramond. We requested the king’s pardon in writing. It seems as though we will not have any soldiers sent to us from that kingdom. We are not in any sort of position to demand negotiations from them, since they’re also at risk of getting stomped on by the Orcs.”</p>
<p>“Is it only the Kingdom of Koronis that is left?”</p>
<p>“Yes….”</p>
<p>All of the deals were at risk of crumbling. As if all of those kingdoms were waiting, God’s Orc armies invaded them, and they would not easily give away their own armies that were meant to protect them. Even if they didn’t send over a diplomat, they could surmise that they weren’t any different from the other kingdoms.</p>
<p>The crown princes who were in the conference with Lustian also seemed visibly troubled. The hardships that the Arpen Empire was going through could endanger all of the kingdoms in Slovenia, so they could not hold their home countries accountable.</p>
<p>The Crown Prince of Ramond started to talk.</p>
<p>“I shall still help. Leading the knightage that I possess, I shall keep the promise I made with Empress Viola.”</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke, all the other crown princes expressed the same sentiment.</p>
<p>“As shall I.”</p>
<p>“I have amassed a lot of enlisted persons. It does not fill the promised quota, but we can gather 5,000 soldiers.”</p>
<p>Lustian could sense their sincerity. They were dependable. Despite having once been enemies, they’d developed a camaraderie.</p>
<p>“Alright. Even if you don’t fill the quota, the pact will remain valid.”</p>
<p>“Th-Thank you!”</p>
<p>Finally, the darkness on their faces faded away. Lustian accepted their gratitude and told them they would never point swords at each other again. When the crown princes got up from their seats and walked out, Kyle opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Is that really alright? After all, it is being reduced to a 1/20th of the amount we initially planned….”</p>
<p>“At any rate, we planned to have only our own army deployed in the worst-case scenario. Since they have several sword masters, they will be the finest soldiers.”</p>
<p>To win this war, they needed the strength of their leaders rather than their soldiers. They would be able to face hundreds of Orcs. They did not take this lightly. At this rate, they would have to amass the most elite army unit and wage battle in God’s territory…</p>
<p>“Now, it is time to surprise the empress… Instead of the plan, I am more concerned for Viola.”</p>
<p>Of course, Viola rushed into the meeting room. Seeing how she was catching her breath, it was obvious that she came after hearing the news. She looked pale, but Lustian’s confidence did not waver as he calmed her down.</p>
<p>“Usually, it is more effective if the top army unit is deployed. During a war, the strength of each individual is more important than the number of soldiers.”</p>
<p>“Even so….”</p>
<p>Lustian grabbed the end of her dress with one hand and looked her in the eyes. “Trust me. I have the strength to face God.”</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The whole palace was covered in a thick fog. Then, there was a downpour that made the day look dark. It didn’t look much different at night. Since even the moon hid its face, you would not be able to see anybody moving in the far distance. Just then, she saw something zip past her.</p>
<p>Anne held a calabash close to her chest and walked to the Lake of God. In the dark, she could barely see anything, but since she knew exactly where she was going, she went straight to the lake. She could feel herself stepping on the Judith flower. However, as if she didn’t care that she was stepping on a flower, she walked forward.</p>
<p>Like she was hypnotized, she walked into the lake. Then, she took out the calabash. She gulped as she looked at it.</p>
<p><em>I can do it! Yes…</em></p>
<p>Without a moment of consideration, she opened the calabash and dropped it into the water. It seemed that the amount of water that came out of it was larger than the size of the small calabash. She held it for so long that her arm was aching. When the last drop fell, she threw the calabash into the lake.</p>
<p><em>Now… I can wait. Viola, let’s see how long you can last.</em></p>
<p>There was a smile of satisfaction on Anne’s face. Her eyes were burning with lust and ambition at once.</p>
<p>Just when she was about to hurry out of the lake, Ivan popped out of the thick darkness. Her face turned blue. He wasn’t even properly dressed. His eyes were shining. Since she had put him to sleep through medication, she didn’t expect him to be awake so soon.</p>
<p>After coming out of the lake, Anne tried to walk past him, but then he grabbed her wrist aggressively.</p>
<p>“What have you done!”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>Ivan’s eyes were cold. It was the same orbs that he had when she seduced him so that she could use him. <em>No matter what he thinks of me… all I need is to achieve my own means.</em></p>
<p>“I cannot stand to look at you. I have my limits. Since we married, I have given it my best but….”</p>
<p>Suddenly, there were chills running up her back. Anne turned to Ivan.</p>
<p>“What will you do if you can’t stand it?”</p>
<p>“I want a divorce.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm? What… What did you say?”</p>
<p>“We will divorce.”</p>
<p>In an unfeeling voice, Ivan said those words and turned around. He disappeared without even turning back.</p>
<p>Left alone, Anne suddenly felt as though she was hit in the head with a blunt object.</p>
