            <p><strong>Chapter 181</strong></p>
<p>Translator: Lunarise</p>
<p>Editor: Larkspur</p>
<p>“I will figure everything else out on my own terms, so there is no need for You to keep an eye on me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so do you intend to jump off such a high tower?”</p>
<p>“I can do it on my own so long as You lay out a path for me.”</p>
<p>“Alright. I do owe you one, and you will absolutely have to do this to escape.”</p>
<p>He sprinkled something over Viola’s head. The shimmering light enveloped her body, and soon her presence was faint.</p>
<p>“Now no one will be able to see you. However, once my power grows further apart from the New World, there will be certain entities that will come after you, so be prepared for that.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Adhering to the regulations of the palace, Viola did a curtsy. As soon as He hid, she opened the window and looked around. It was a terrifying height, but since there were a lot of windows, she could use them as an anchorage to get down. She rolled up the bottom of her dress to turn it into pants. It did look ridiculous, but her own appearance was the least of her concerns.</p>
<p>Edward started by peeking out of the window and stepping on the anchorage. Then he reached his hand out to his sister.</p>
<p>“I will help you. I trust that you are aware of my usefulness.”</p>
<p>“Older brother….”</p>
<p>Edward gently twisted his lips. “I have limits to how much I can help you, but I will escort you as much as I can.”</p>
<p>“Yes! I agree.”</p>
<p>Viola nodded her head and grabbed Edward’s hand. The siblings jumped from window frame to window frame. Edward was in the lead, with Viola following from behind.</p>
<p>The god looking at them from afar had a satisfied smile on his face.</p>
<p>♛</p>
<p>The knights were flying off like autumn leaves. The tornado on the wide sandy hill blew everything away in an instant. The flag covered in blood disappeared in the wind and the cloth was ripped apart.</p>
<p>In the storm, the only man who was facing God was Lustian. His black hair was flowing; between the soft strands, there was a visible thirst for blood. The people looking at him were dumbfounded. Paul, who held onto him due to his broken arm, and Kyle, who was unable to keep his balance due to his huge leg injury, stood there gaping at Lustian’s awakening power.</p>
<p>Black clouds were forming in the sky. As Lustian grabbed onto the sword with both hands, he started speaking in an unknown language.</p>
<p><em><strong>Phhhhht-!</strong></em></p>
<p>Along with a blinding light, two tornadoes merged with one another. The piercing noise caused the knights to cover their ears. A glaring light plunged to the ground.</p>
<p><em><strong>Phhht- Phhht-</strong></em></p>
<p>As soon as the light hit the rock, it shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>It was nothing short of wondrous. It was the final showdown between God and the Grand Master.</p>
<p>“I remembered who I am! I am… I am!”</p>
<p>Lustian’s voice spread across all of New World. Crimson veins were sticking out of his forehead and his body was shaking intermittently.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter who you were in the past. You are still in a human body. You are merely a human that lost their divine power! Judith!”</p>
<p>Out of the opponent’s hand came a small, dark sphere that was thrown at him. He managed to dodge it although it came at him at such high speed. But it must’ve grazed his skin because there was a new wound on his left cheek. Blood dripped from it. God looked at Lustian and laughed.</p>
<p>“I will turn that beautiful face into a rag!”</p>
<p>“Arhil! You were the one who trapped me in a sheet of ice!”</p>
<p>As soon as Lustian set foot on the New World, his memories also came back. Who he was and why he had to part with his loved one…</p>
<p>Right before the wedding, he went up to the New World before he found himself caught in a lasso. He was stuck in a cold sheet of ice for several years. He couldn’t move until the virgin shriveled up and died due to old age. When he finally broke the ice and escaped, he found that she had already become a flower. He found that that flower was his bride.</p>
<p>Lustian’s anger was boundless. As soon as he remembered who he was, it was as if all his lost power returned to him. His eyes went wide. When he concentrated his power into his sword, suddenly there was a giant ball of fire. There was a terrifying sound of the air burning. The heat was so intense, it felt as though it would burn up the entrance to the New World. It reached a point where there was a pit dug into the place where the both of them collided.</p>
<p>Just then, a large pillar of ice appeared in front of them; hit by Lustian’s attack, it shattered everywhere. A shard of the ice swallowed his body and it made him feel like he was being whipped.</p>
<p>“Urk…!”</p>
<p>When he looked down at his arms, he saw that there were deep scars on both of them. At the place where the pillar disappeared, there was a large cloud of steam.</p>
