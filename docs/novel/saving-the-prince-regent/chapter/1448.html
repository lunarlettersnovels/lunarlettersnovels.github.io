            <p><strong>Chapter 30 – A Fugitive’s Secrets</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Proofreader: Livyuna</em></p>
<p>From the first time Zhao Xi saw him, she knew that he was not a commoner; he was most definitely one of the rich or noble. She had assumed that perhaps he was the young master of some rich family, but who knew that his background was this illustrious! Troops everywhere were searching for him in secret, probably in fear of someone harming him, or, if his position was truly that of a noble, in fear of leaking his identity.</p>
<p>If she hadn’t happened upon the arrest of a woman selling men’s apparel today, maybe she wouldn’t have realized that the investigation she thought was in place to find some object, wasn’t actually there to find something, but to find someone. And that someone was the silent, proud man standing before her, who would let her do whatever she wanted to him.</p>
<p>“It has nothing to do with me,” Shen Fei was reading as he replied, not even raising his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhao Xi couldn’t even finish some of these medical books, yet he read them with gusto, finishing all of the texts she left collecting dust. She didn’t want him to be bored. Her medical consultations were free, and her patients would sometimes use books, especially old or medical texts, as payment. If she found the tomes suitable, she might even pay extra change for them. Occasionally, some people would solely bring books to her and trade for money.</p>
<p>As such, her collection of books grew in number, filling up her bookshelf. She didn’t have the time to read, so they were all read by Shen Fei. She instinctively knew what he was looking for: a method that could cure his legs. For the very purpose he was perusing these texts was because he would <em>experiment</em> those methods on himself; practicing what was written when Zhao Xi wasn’t around.</p>
<p>It was useful, yes. However, Shen Fei hadn’t just gone lame. He had also broken three of his ribs. Any exercise, may it be for the purpose of healing his legs, was not beneficial to his recovery.</p>
<p>Still, she found his decision venerable. As she couldn’t monitor him constantly, she could do nothing to prevent his training anyway, provided, he always did them behind her back. She could only build him a tripod so he could have something for support and prevent him from bruising himself.</p>
<p>“Are you really not the person they’re searching for?” she asked him testily. She had a gut feeling, perhaps what they call “woman’s instincts” or maybe that of a beast, that he was the missing person involved. He seemed to be the only one <em>worthy</em>of such an effort, with numerous people on the chase for the estimable fugitive. After half a month, the investigations had only heightened in severity.</p>
<p>They refused to retreat until found him; they would leave no pebble unturned.</p>
<p>Only Zhao Xi knew that he was in this hidden valley. Even if they searched, they wouldn’t be able to find the entrance, as it was hidden too deep and covered with twining green vines. Unless they were to probe every corner of Phoenix Mountain, the entry would remain hidden, safely within the confines of the earth.</p>
<p>They were on the western side of the mountain, near a treacherous cliff. It was a barren land with nothing but weeds, with no area for settlement. No one would search here carefully—the chances of finding him were almost zero. For this very reason, the search outside was still in continuation, ever causing a commotion with the denizens…</p>
<p>With the scale of their search, Zhao Xi couldn’t think of a place other than this valley that could still hide someone from them for so long, and so securely.</p>
<p>But if they were really looking for him, then why wouldn’t he admit it?</p>
<p>Was it because of his legs? Or did he choose to stay because only she could heal his palsy?</p>
<p>Shen Fei finally put down his book, raising his head to look at her, “Why do you think that it’s me?”</p>
<p><em>‘Because you’re the only one hidden in a valley and hasn’t been found.’</em></p>
<p>Zhao Xi wanted to say this, but decided not to after a moment’s silence, “Perhaps I’m supposing.”</p>
<p>What good would it do her if Shen Fei admitted that he was who the troops are after? Then, they would just take him away, and they would never see each other again.</p>
<p>After living together for almost a month, she found a predilection to having someone wait for her every day, even if he could only lay in bed and look at her so. It filled her with a strange, saccharine happiness when he asked her, “You’re back?”</p>
<p>Just that one question was able to fill Zhao Xi’s heart with warmth, and her exhaustion from the day’s work would melt away. She could make dinner, boil medicine, wipe his body, and help him to bed with relish, without feeling a hint of complain.</p>
<p>“The medicinal herbs are prepared… we’ll find the Brittle Snake tomorrow,” she announced. Zhao Xi then moved the wheelchair and the person on it into the room.</p>
<p>Her hunting partner was her pet bear. Even when Ping An was just a baby, it weighed in at one or hundred catties (around 130-260 pounds). Ping An was also rather clingy; wherever she went, it would follow. It was alright when they were going out, but it troubled her on the way back, as it would refuse to walk. She couldn’t leave him behind, so she could only half-drag, half-carry the enormous bear.</p>
<p>After so much experience, plus her love for exercise and martial arts, she had grown muscle on her arms and abs. Carrying Shen Fei now was no difficult feat. She could do it easily, even trekking a route up and alight the mountain. After all, as heavy as a grown man could be, he still couldn’t beat a bear.</p>
<p>Zhao Xi helped him onto the bed, placed the cloth on the table, organized the medicines into her carrying case, and finished her tasks by turning over the blanket and squeezing onto the bed next to him. Meanwhile, Shen Fei had been lying here for an entire day, leaving only the mattress for a while after she had returned. His body warmth still lingered in the soft sheets. With only a slight stretch of her hands or feet, she could also touch his warm body, wrapped in just a thin layer of fabric.</p>
<p>“Brittle Snakes are rare, and hard to find. Your legs might have to wait a couple more days.” Shen Fei couldn’t feel anything below his waist. She could sneakily touch him, and he wouldn’t know. But Zhao Xi didn’t like clandestine acts; she wanted to do things openly.</p>
