<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 18 – Only a Hug (2)</strong></p>
<p>She recalled that two years ago she had found a ginseng. At that time, the ginseng was around 17 years of age and a little small, so she decided not to pick it. Instead, she used a red string to tie around it, and grew a few plants that naturally deterred the animals around. Therefore, she was able to prevent any predators from eating it.</p>
<p>The red string had two reasons: first, it was to inform others that she had found the ginseng first and that it belonged to her; second, it was to tie down the ginseng. Myth has it that ginseng is able to run, and whether this was real or not, Zhao Xi decided to learn from the older folks and tied it down with the red string. Now two years has passed, she wondered if the ginseng was still in the selfsame spot…</p>
<p>Herbs that grew in the wild are often more effective, and usually can sell for a better price. Those considered of sublime quality might fetch for exorbitant prices. Perhaps she could use it to buy a better set of clothing for Shen Fei.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After feeding Shen Fei and Ping An, Zhao Xi adroitly started the hike in search for the ginseng. As luck would have it, it sat nicely hidden in its corner, neither was it stolen or eaten by animal;  it was as still: waiting for her to pick it up.</p>
<p>Harvesting a ginseng is an adverse work requiring delicate patience. As none of the roots can be broken, it took her almost four hours to pick it up. For the time it took her to traverse the mountains and gather the ginseng, it was evening by the time Zhao Xi returned.</p>
<p>After a simple meal, she dutifully washed Shen Fei and started taking measurements. Having done this act in routine, Shen Fei no longer struggled against her in ignominy. Instead, he allowed her to turn him over and even clean his private regions, all the while his demeanour self-effacing.</p>
<p>Mindless as ever to his private miseries, Zhao Xi’s attention was held by the bruises on his body. The skin, in purple and blue blooms, were not small either; both his knees were bruised, and the skin on one of them was even lacerated. Despite the injury, Shen Fei did not show any signs of pain or discomfort on his face.</p>
<p>She lightly stroked his injured knees and pondered silently. There were only three of them on the mountain; other than her, there was only Shen Fei and Ping An. Since Ping An now trusted him, it was impossible for it to have hurt him. That means only one possibility was left.</p>
<p>This injury was caused by Shen Fei himself.</p>
<p><em>Under what situation would he hurt himself to this extent?</em> She carefully mulled over the scenarios, of which at the moment looked like a case of physical abuse. Zhao Xi felt suspicious and untrusting of herself; was she sleepwalking at night and beating him up before putting him back to bed? It was absurd; she was really turning to a dastard!</p>
<p>Whenever Zhao Xi had nothing to do, she would clean his body. Therefore, she was knowledgeable regarding the condition of his body, even clearer than Shen Fei himself owing to her medicinal knowledge. There were no injuries on him yesterday when she had cleaned him, so it meant the injuries were caused after she left them earlier in the day. How it happened then was unknown.</p>
<p>Zhao Xi thought to herself that she should investigate when the opportunity arises. For now, she pretended not to notice, and vacuously applied some medication on his bruises. She helped him wear his sleepwear, lay him down in the middle of the bed. She had no intentions to share the bed with him, lest she hurt him in her sleep when she was tossing and turning.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, Zhao Xi woke up to use the toilet. Once again, she noticed that his body was situated at the edge. To her, the sight of such a large figure huddling in the corner of the bed looked pitiful.</p>
<p>Zhao Xi contemplated for a moment, thinking prudently, before going to the bed, lightly kneeling on the soft sheets. As to not rouse him, she carefully placed her hands under the blanket. The moment her hands brushed against Shen Fei’s skin, she could feel a slight tremble against her fingers.</p>
<p>He was not asleep yet; even though his eyes were closed, his breathing was uneven. The rise and fall of his chest was regular, almost serene, whenever he slept.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’m not going to do anything.” Zhao Xi said softly, “It’s only a short hug.”</p>
<p>After she said this, Zhao Xi took him into her arms and carried him back to the middle of the bed. She ensured that the blankets were covering Shen Fei properly. With a yawn, she returned to her own bench to sleep.</p>
<p>Just as the night’s disturbance ended, the man on the bed opened his eyes and gazed at Zhao Xi.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, there was a lady laying on her side on the bench, her hand supporting the side of her face. She looked blissful in her sleep, unawares of the worries in the world…</p>
