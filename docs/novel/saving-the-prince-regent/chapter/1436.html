            <p><strong>Chapter 42 – The Hunt for the Brittle Snake (3)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Livyuna</em></p>
<p><em>Proofreader: Livyuna</em></p>
<p>She had come by the swamps once before, and the route was considered quite simple to find. All she had to do was to keep walking towards the darkest and most humid areas. As she climbed the trees, her sharp eyes looked around, careful to avoid stepping on any withered branches. She also avoided the other snakes. In general, she shouldn’t encounter any dangerous situations.</p>
<p>However, afraid that it wouldn’t be enough, she used a dagger to make a small cut on the tip of her finger. The blood slowly trickled down onto the ground, becoming a small puddle. She then stayed down without changing her location, waiting for the brittle snake to appear.</p>
<p>Before long, instead of the brittle snake, she encountered other venomous animals. Her hands were suddenly full of a few bamboo sticks which had a string strung though a hole at the ends. The string had a layer of poison applied, and the moment anyone or any living thing was caught by it, there would be no chance of survival. She would only need to pull the strong lightly to contain the situation.</p>
<p>Zhao Xi was careful not to let any animal escape. Animals share a mutual understanding; if one escapes, it would inform the others that there was a trap ahead.</p>
<p>Sadly, there were just too many venomous animals in the area, and Zhao Xi was unable to catch every single one of them. Only after the rope was pulled up and tightened, did she then realize that one of them had escaped.</p>
<p>There was no more purpose to waiting here anymore, she should change her waiting position.</p>
<p>Zhao Xi found another spot that was just as damp as earlier. She used her blood as a bait, while she sat on the tree and started waiting.</p>
<p>As she waited, dawn broke. Realizing the sky was about to lighten up, she quickly prepared her bags to return. Perhaps due to squatting for too long, she was unable to sleep peacefully at night for a long time. As she stood up, her body started swaying front and back, before losing consciousness and falling onto the ground with a thud.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The forest was very quiet and peaceful. Without Zhao Xi’s disruption, Shen Fei had a good sleep. At the start, he was quite worried about Zhao Xi and would suffer from insomnia. However, after a few days, he realized that Zhao Xi’s toughness was way beyond his imagination, and gradually, he was able to be less worried, and focus more on doing his own things.</p>
<p>Every day, he would persevere on standing up and walking a little, for no longer than a minute. Now that he has more experience, he knows that right before he falls, he can use his crutch to support his body. As such, even while exercising and moving around the house, he would be able to avoid causing injuries all over his body.</p>
<p>Shen Fei’s day can be considered to be relatively structured. After practicing walking, he would return to his wheelchair and wheel himself to the small cabin to shower, before starting to cook.</p>
<p>As he had never done it before, his culinary skills were only decent enough to make simple dishes. Zhao Xi’s vegetable garden did not have much food, nor have many different types. Instead, Shen Fei reached out to pluck both cucumbers from the side porch and wondered what could be made from them.</p>
<p>The roads in the vegetable garden were narrow, and wheelchair users would not be able to venture along the path, and could only pluck the fruits from the sides. Yesterday, Shen Fei had plucked the tomatoes as the rest were much further in and beyond his reach. Today, there were not much available for him to pluck from the sides, and all that he could do was to pluck some green pepper and tomatoes again.</p>
<p>In the egg kitchen, there was a small pot that could be used to fry vegetables. Shen Fei has seen Zhao Xi used them before, but they were kept at a higher spot, and Shen Fei was unable to take it himself.</p>
<p>Shen Fei took a look at the bamboo basket. He decided that he would continue steaming his vegetables as he enjoys the light bland taste. He washed the tomatoes and green pepper, diced them, added some chicken stock and mixed them around, before leaving them in the bamboo basket to be steamed.</p>
<p>Egg whites are easy to steam; it only requires a flipping every now and then, and the end result still appears similar to it being fried. If it is still pasty, or diluted, one just has to steam it longer.</p>
<p>At three in the afternoon, the food was ready. However, Zhao Xi was not back yet. Shen Fei was very patient and went to close the window, before laying down on the bed to read his book while waiting.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was a disturbance at the door. Shen Fei looked up and saw that it was not Zhao Xi, but a yellow ferret, which was attracted here by the smell of the food. The yellow ferret looked at Shen Fei, before starting to move towards the kitchen with no fear.</p>
<p>Just as it was about to take a step, it was stopped by a hand that had grabbed the back of its neck, and lifted it up entirely.</p>
<p>She turned the yellow ferret around and faced it.</p>
<p>The yellow ferret, which is also known as the weasel, has a very powerful weapon…</p>
