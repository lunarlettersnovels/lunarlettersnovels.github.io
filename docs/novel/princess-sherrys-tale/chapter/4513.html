<p>Ah, this was it. Since last night, the aura that had constantly tormented him while also making him thirsty had struck him again. He enjoyed the sensation for a short time before moving his lips again. Her body quivered. And as the man licked up his outer lips, Sherri grabbed and pressed down on the man’s head.</p>
<p>“Hagh, ah, ahh! S, stop…”</p>
<p>He slowly licked off the clear liquid on the outside and added a little strength to the tip of his tongue to tease the inside. He spread her legs wider to reveal her pink inner layer. He used his lips to open her p*ssy and placed his tongue on her sensitive spot with a bit of force. Her hand that held on to his hood started to shake more intensely.</p>
<p>He could hear her sweet moans every time his tongue touched it. He moved his tongue down a little and covered his mouth over the spot that squirted the sweet honey. He then started to suck on it, which made Sherri arch her back. It tasted sweet, but the slightly sour taste made it more addicting.</p>
<p>The pitch of Sherri’s moans reached its climax as his tongue licked her p*ssy clean. Such sounds from her mouth made it impossible for the man to resist.</p>
<p>The man quickly opened his fly and pulled out his tool, which had wet his underwear a bit. The big, swollen thing, on which the veins were so clearly defined, was squirming, clearly showing how much it had been holding back. He pulled down his drawers and pants at once and threw them to the floor. He breathed heavily as he spread her thighs and positioned himself.</p>
<p>He thought he had sucked all the juice out of her, but he could see the spot was drenched again. He licked off the liquid on his lips and placed his g*nital on Sherri’s hole. Ah, the slippery feeling made it hard to keep control. He breathed in and pushed his exceptionally thick head inside her.</p>
<p>“Ah, aaggh…”</p>
<p>“Ughh…”</p>
<p>It wasn’t even halfway in, but the tightness was as great as last time. He felt that if he loosened up, he would slip out. So, he clenched his teeth and pushed his hips entirely forward.</p>
<p>As he entered the deepest part of her, he tilted his head to the back and gasped. The soft insides of Sherri’s p*ssy were wriggling and sucking on his p*nis. He feared that she would swallow his entire invention. So, he pulled back, and, as he did, a great deal of pleasure hit him.</p>
<p>Drops of sweat ran down the man’s brow as her insides clenched around his thing. Sherri kept moving her waist. So, the man had to grab it to finally move in and out smoothly.</p>
<p>“Ahh, ah, haanngh, nngh, oh…”</p>
<p>His hips gradually moved faster and faster, but he could not slow down. She became louder and louder, but his head had gone blank, so he could only hear her faintly.</p>
<p>As he vigorously thrust his hips back and forth like last time, her body shook harshly to match the tempo. Her inner walls tightened their grip on his thing. Soon his sweat ran down and dripped from his jawline.</p>
<p>Maybe because she had already reached climax from the extended foreplay, her moans began to sound like screams as the man thrust on her like a wild beast. Although it had been intense from the start, her sensitive body still surprised him.</p>
<p>As she squeezed her p*ssy so tightly that anyone could go crazy, he could not process his thoughts any further. He could tell she had climaxed as she squeezed for a while and quickly released.</p>
<p>“Hagh, hah.”</p>
<p>He had gained some experience in the past, so he knew to pause for a while to keep himself from coming. He could barely keep it in, so he began to move his hips again at the same pace, but more softly. As he did, her body flinched and quivered. And her still highly aroused moans further provoked him. Since her climax, her insides had been filling with honey, and her inner walls were softening. He felt like his thing was about to melt inside her.</p>
<p>Sherri’s nails were digging into the man’s arms as she couldn’t bear the org*sm. So, the man paused and pulled his thing out of her. The man appeared concerned as Sherri’s area flinched as if dismayed that his thing had left.</p>
<p>But the man continued to change his position. He forced Sherri, who was as* rubbing on the sofa, to sit on his lap. He then stuck his heated and drenched object right into her.</p>
<p>“Ahh…!”</p>
