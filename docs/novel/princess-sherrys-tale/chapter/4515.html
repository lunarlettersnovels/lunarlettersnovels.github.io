        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“Ahh, Are we, doing it, hah, here?!</p>
<p>“Hmm, can’t we?”</p>
<p>Her chest felt exposed and when she looked down, she saw that he had already taken off her robe and pulled her dress down to right below her bre*sts. <em>This man is so skilled, he’s unnoticeable. Who is this man?</em> His hand was grabbing her voluptuous bre*sts, which could not be concealed by the light green slip undergarment over them. Then, in the blink of an eye, he was now completely on top of her.</p>
<p>Although they were on the sofa, it was soft like a bed and big enough to have their way on. The man had his hood covered down to the tip of his nose which made him breathe heavily. While lightly grabbing Sherri’s bre*sts, he brought his face close to her.</p>
<p>“My hood, are you not going to take it off?”</p>
<p>She did consider taking it off at first. But Sherri had a feeling that seeing the man’s face at this point would be pointless. Having seen the lower part of his face, she figured he would be quite charming, but his actions made her think that he had a few screws loose.</p>
<p>The virgin male theory was becoming more and more of a reality. She suppressed such thoughts from creeping into her head again. She thought she would be better off not knowing. Sherri kept on reminding herself that after this night, he would be involved with her life no more. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Forget it. We’ve already come this far without seeing it.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you say.”</p>
<p>The man, having been lightly massaging Sherri’s bre*st during the conversation, lowered his head again and buried her lips with his. She frowned as her lips were slightly sensitive because they were already wet and a bit swollen from the kissing earlier.</p>
<p>The man slowly added more pressure in squeezing her bre*sts. But when he tried to slide his hand to her back to take off her slip, Sherri snapped back and pushed his chest lightly away from herself.</p>
<p>“W, Wait! a, are we really doing it here?”</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>Displaying confusion, the man let out his breath, which was now hotter than before, onto her face. No matter how spacious it was, it was still a sofa, and most important of all, there was Tolcher sleeping on the bed right behind it.</p>
<p>As Sherri chinned toward the back, the man raised his upper body. He looked like he was thinking for a moment, then looked towards Tolcher over the backrest.</p>
<p>“The knight, how much did he drink?”</p>
<p>“We nearly emptied a bottle of Trocona but I only had a glass, so the rest…”</p>
<p>“Then we’re good. Five glasses of Trocona puts you to sleep for at least a few of hours.”</p>
<p>He then went back to fondling Sherri’s bre*sts covered by the slip and, at last, pulled from her and threw it off the sofa. As Sherri, with a stunned face, covered her bre*sts using her hands, the man grabbed her thin white arms and asked with a slightly hurried voice.</p>
<p>“Is there another problem?”</p>
<p>“Even so, how could we be in a room with another person? Let’s move to another room.”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait till then.”</p>
<p>After saying so, the man snatched her arms away from her and revealed her bre*sts out in the open. As she shrieked, he grinned as if he found it cute, and grabbed her bre*sts from the bottom and swept them to the top.</p>
<p>“ You’re very shy, which is quite a surprise. I told you, he won’t awake till morning.”</p>
<p>“S,Still…”</p>
<p>As if he really enjoyed the feeling of her bre*sts, unable to fully grasp even with his big hands, he continued to massage them several times. While doing so, the man, with his face all red, started to lightly bite Sherri’s earflap. Sherri, who had turned her face to the side, couldn’t suppress her moan due to his unexpected actions.</p>
<p>“Do you know how much I’ve been waiting for this…?”</p>
<p>“Nnngh, s, stop.”</p>
<p>Blatantly squeezing her bre*sts and placing his teeth lightly on her ear caused a fervent moan to burst out of Sherri’s mouth. The man then slowly groped the outline of the ear and, at last, started to suck and pull on her earlobe.</p>
<p>“Aaaah! nnnghh, n, no. stop.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been dying for this.”</p>
<p>Sherri’s head shook somewhat erratically as he pinched and shook the tip of her erotically swollen bre*sts. Looking at her act in such a way stiffened the man’s mouth, fading the dimple and locking the jaw harder. All this was happening because he was aroused by Sherri’s bre*sts shaking seductively along with her head.</p>
<p>“Ah, agh, e, enough. Hah!”</p>
<p>“I can’t.”</p>
<p>He paused his hand movement for a moment to support her back. He then carefully undressed her from the dress entirely. Although the dress wrinkled a bit because he sat on top of it, he figured it would go away with a few beatings. He then placed the dress on the floor as carefully as possible. However, he was too heated up that it was challenging his patience.</p>
