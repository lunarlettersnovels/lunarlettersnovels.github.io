        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging from that man’s strangely embarrassed attitude, it seemed right that Sherri had started it first. If so, she had nothing to say. Still, since they had enjoyed each other, she thought she didn’t need to say sorry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was shocked to hear that he was going to take responsibility, so she’d cut him off, but he didn’t seem to be a lousy man. She had thought he would be a feeble man because he had been seduced by a woman he met for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sherri was intrigued by the way he was restlessly looking at her all the time, and being awkward with s*xual contact even though they had already done everything together. Aside from his appearance, she didn’t really think of him as her type, and she was working hard on Tol, so she must be the type to like innocent men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, the man was still wearing his hood and not showing his face. Isn’t it funny that she doesn’t even know his face even though they have done it all together? There was no reason to refuse to do so if his face was desirable enough for her seductive attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she tried to put her hand on his hood, the man flinched in surprise and grabbed her hand. “Wh-what’s wrong?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You aren’t going to show me your face?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re the one who can’t remember, no?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he seemed to be upset and slightly sarcastic about Sherri’s drunkenness, she shook her wrist with a pained expression. Sherri was actually hurt after having been grabbed by Tol twice today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S-sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the man, embarrassed, was trying to let go of her hand, Sherri pulled his collar vigorously and kissed his lips once again. The cool, aqua scent that spread out faintly due to being closer than earlier also changed her feeling from familiarity to conviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man was unexpectedly calm while she was trying to take off his hood, and the touch of his lips felt okay, so Sherri put her hands behind his neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she pressed the man’s lips and opened her mouth to lick his lips, she thought a shallow moan was coming out of his mouth, and he hugged her waist tightly. Then the man’s hot tongue squeezed in between his lips as if impatient.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ugh, I didn’t mean to go this far already here.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Sherri’s body was about to heat up due to his tongue poking around the mucous membrane on her inner cheek. He was a pretty good kisser; the delicate type.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the usual men she led, when his tongue twisted around, she only moved her lips to respond and let him do what he did. This wasn’t bad sometimes. This precious kiss on her mouth was somehow itchy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two closely connected mouths heated up, making each other’s breath a little hoarse. The man took off one of his hands from Sherri’s waist, carefully lifted her, and brought her closer to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahhhhh. Mmmm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that the heated member rising from the center of the man’s body became stuck to Sherri’s body. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already? Don’t tell me I’m his first one… And a guy who can kiss like this already has an erection? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man’s body seemed to be heated up because his breath became hoarser and the movement of his tongue gradually became urgent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sherri had come onto him this time too, but the way the man pounced on her, she didn’t think the last time was much different from this. She thought it was quite surprising that he hadn’t refused a night with a woman he saw for the first time due to her polite attitude and voice, but come to think of it now, he must be the type to get excited easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it wasn’t like there weren’t many men who often lost control easily. In one situation or another, the thought had passed by that he would be a man with little sympathy or experience, but she tried not to consider those possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, meanwhile he had… got bigger. She thought he had reached his limit now, but  was still growing.</span></p>
