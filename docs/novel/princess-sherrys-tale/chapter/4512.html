<p>Changing the position caused her to squeeze again, allowing the two to feel a different soft sensation, making them moan. He hugged her from the back and thrust her up. Sherri’s head tilted back as he did.</p>
<p>She wasn’t even able to open her eyes from the intense or*gasm. The man lifted her finger and pulled her ring out with his mouth. Then her red hair, which he could faintly picture from his dreams, spread out.</p>
<p>As he pounded his hips onto her, he kissed her ever-pale and smooth cheeks. He grabbed her arms and locked them behind her back. Sherri gasped with her face buried in the man’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Nnghm ugh, ungh, aah, hagh.”</p>
<p>“Hagh, a, are you enjoying it?”</p>
<p>Sherri could only whimper as his movement became so rough that it made it impossible for her to speak. Then Tolcher, who was clearly sleeping on the bed, appeared in her bleary eyes. She was able to see him as she sat on the man’s lap and put her face behind him.</p>
<p><em>My Tolcher, you kept rejecting me, now look what happened…</em></p>
<p>“Aaah, hag, ah, ah ahh.”</p>
<p>“What, are you looking at?”</p>
<p>Sherri’s head tilted back again because the man’s movement became harsher as if he noticed that she was looking at Tolcher. The man glanced back at Tolcher and then brought Sherri’s face down to kiss her. His tongue wrapped around her tongue and sucked on it.</p>
<p>“Mmm, nngh, mm! Hnngh.”</p>
<p>“Please, focus, on, me, ugh, right now.”</p>
<p>His words nearly made her jump up and bite her tongue as the man’s hips banged fiercely against her body. She could not open her mouth, so she just nodded her head.</p>
<p>She didn’t have the strength to withstand his large and thick thing rushing into her. Since her climax, she had lost control of her mind and body, and she couldn’t tell if the s*x they were having now was reality or a dream.</p>
<p>The moans and heavy breathing, and the constant hip movement between them, roused their movement to become rougher. As the man got closer to his peak, his thrusts got faster and shook Sherri’s body more.</p>
<p>“Ahh, nngh, ah, ah, ahhngh.”</p>
<p>“Hagh, hagh, My Lady, may I come, hah, inside?”</p>
<p>“Y, yes… It’s okay… Agh, nngh, hagh.”</p>
<p>He carefully supported the back of her head and placed her down on the sofa again. He then gripped her waist tightly and thrust as quickly as he could. Feeling her waist arch up and seeing her frown made it difficult to hold back. His back stiffened.</p>
<p>His thick object infiltrated the deepest part of her p*ssy. For a moment, his entire body stiffened. But soon it moved back and forth slowly as he squeezed out every last drop. He gradually stopped his movement and fell on top of Sherri’s quivering body. He breathed heavily on top of her and kissed her on the cheeks and lips.</p>
<p>“That was… amazing.”</p>
<p>The man looked at Sherri, who was shaking like she was having a seizure, with loving eyes. He slowly raised his body and tried to pull out his p3nis. Her flinching pu$$y, on the other hand, did not let go and squeezed his thing even tighter. The man furrowed his brow and let out a moan.</p>
<p>The man stood still for a moment and tidied the strands of hair that stuck to her sweat-covered face. She looked beautiful. Looking at her post-climax face filled the man with pride.</p>
<p>Then, the man’s half-pulled-out p*nis was starting to grow again.</p>
<p>“Ah shoot.”</p>
<p>“Hngh.”</p>
<p>It continued to enlarge inside of her. For whatever reason, her scent, fluids, and soft inner walls were paralyzing him. Although his feelings of arousal had been fading, her body continued to grab onto him tightly.</p>
<p>He figured her petite body could not take any more of him, so he gently shook her shoulders to wake her up. However, Sherri did not seem to get up as she was exhausted from climaxing two times in a row.</p>
<p><em>What to do…?</em></p>
<p>While the man pondered, her insides pressed closer to him. His thing swelled up again. The man’s breath roughened again as his senses were becoming dominated by the “feeling” that rushed through his veins.</p>
