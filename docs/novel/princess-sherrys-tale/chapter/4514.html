            <p>Seeing her arching her back and her white face glowing with hints of red just from slight touches to the n*pple made the man feel like he was about to lose his mind. He felt this way towards her before, but oh how she was able to make him let go of his senses to such an extent!</p>
<p>She seemed like she was quite worried about the knight as she would seldom look towards the backrest with her rolled eyes. <em>Oh, so this is why she’s so aroused, </em>thought the man with his dimple indenting more than before.</p>
<p>He had thought that it must not be her first time but it seemed she lacked experience as she was the daughter of a noble family. She probably just had fun a few times in bed with a man as young as her.</p>
<p>Though Sherri had way more experience with men, especially older men, unlike the man’s assumption, he still got one thing right.</p>
<p>Who would dare hug and touch her regardless of location? It was true that she only had one-on-one uninterrupted private intercourse on top-quality bed sheets with men that Hans carefully selected. Although she had a fair amount of men to play around with, it has not been long since she started to do so which limited a variety of experiences.</p>
<p>Even though she currently had an average face and cliché brown hair due to the magic ring, the last time he had seen her was so engraved in his mind that he felt as if he could see her rosy, red hair.</p>
<p>As his fondling slowed down, so did her silent heavy breathing. The man could see Sherri’s pink-tinted n*pple and without hesitation pasted his lips on top of it. He sucked on it lightly until he could no longer take her body scent causing him to bite the tiny bulge.</p>
<p>This made Sherri’s body jump up. The man was stunned at how such a slim hip can move like that but her reaction satisfied the man, leaving a stronger grin on his face.</p>
<p>“Aaang, hagh, ah, ahm, aghh!”</p>
<p>As he varied his technique between licking lightly, sucking hard, and pushing down with his tongue, Sherri could not control her body from moving. The man looked up at Sherri and saw that not only were her cheeks blushing, but her entire face had turned pink, and her eyes were losing focus.</p>
<p>Feeling that he had done enough with her bre*sts, the man moved his hand down to the place which he had been restraining himself from. Without a doubt, the area was soaking wet, incomparable to before. The man was further stunned as her entire pantie was soaked that even the lightest touch made her quiver.</p>
<p>It was like she took a bag of aphrodisiacs. She was so aroused that it made the man wonder if she was unable to control herself around him like how he was unable to control himself from her skin and juice. Such scholar-like curiosity arose in him while reason and instinct were playing tug-of-war.</p>
<p>It was either that or she was gifted to be sensitive, enough for her to react despite his awkward touch.</p>
<p>After he threw her wet underw3ar to the side of the sofa, he could now see Sherri’s completely nak3d body in the full picture. Seeing her slightly open eyes and subtle flinches made him want to put it in right away. However, he could not pass the sweet honey-like smell rising from below.</p>
<p>Her pale white body and few strands of pubic hair made her swollen red lips between her thighs look more erotic to the man’s eyes.</p>
<p>Seeing the transparent fluid spilling out from her inside made the man lick his lips. The man carefully swept his hand over the area. The liquid stuck to his hand as if it was waiting for it and a heated moan burst out of Sherri’s mouth</p>
<p>“Agh…”</p>
<p>“Incredible… Is it because earlier you drank a bit, or because of the presence of the knight over there?”</p>
<p>Sherri’s chin was already trembling from his soft touch on her split. Around a week of suppressed desire due to Tolcher made her hair spike even at such a light stimulus. However, the man seemed to be intentionally teasing her with his slow and calm touch to her womanly part which irritated Sherri. So, she lightly shook her hips.</p>
<p>“Hnngh, nnngh, ahh, stop.”</p>
<p>“Still telling me to stop when you’re wet like this. Hah.” As his hand movement became a bit faster, Sherri’s moan became louder.</p>
<p>Seeing Sherri’s bre*sts shake along the tempo of his hand movement aroused the man even more. He paused and lightly licked his wet finger.</p>
<p>“Hah, it’s sweet and sour.”</p>
<p>“Mmnph, ahhh.”</p>
<p>Sherri’s adorable reaction cut the last string of restraint within the man. He gripped her luscious thighs and buried his face between her legs. First, he covered the juicy insides with his lips and sucked in Sherri’s secret aroma mixed with her body scent.</p>
