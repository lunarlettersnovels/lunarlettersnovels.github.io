            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the man in the robe took Tol to the bedroom and laid him on the bed, the bartender, who’d followed behind him, left after putting a jug of ice water and a cup on the nightstand. The man in the robe took off the shoes and outerwear of Tol, who groaned faintly perhaps because he was lying on a soft bed. Sherri, naturally thinking the man was a staff member with the way he tended to Tol, stood watching with her arms crossed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before long, the man in the robe, who laid Tol down comfortably in only a thin shirt and pants, turned to Sherri.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The room next door is empty as well. Should I get it ready for you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. That’s all. I’ll be staying in this room, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No matter how much of an escort he is, a man and a woman in the same room is…,” uttered the man in an embarrassing voice, watching Tol who was in a deep sleep. Then, Sherri couldn’t hold back her laughter. Obviously, the man in the robe was worried Tol would attack him, but no way would that happen. On top of that, hadn’t her plan to seduce Tol, whose reasoning was loosened from the alcohol, gone completely wrong?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he was drunk, he had to have some degree of awareness. A man who couldn’t even open his eyes, in a drunken mess, couldn’t be seduced. On top of that, his thing wouldn’t get hard in his condition, so what now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man looking strangely at Sherri, who suddenly burst into laughter under drunkenness and despondency that began to rise slightly, strode over to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By chance, are you drunk too, young woman?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. It’s just this is all too funny. That man is so naive that he wouldn’t lay a finger on me even if I were lying naked next to him. So please feel free to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it was because her plan had gone to waste or because she was so shocked, Sherri couldn’t stop her giggling from turning into a burst of laughter. But the man calmly wrapped his hands around her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your face is flushed, and your breathing is hoarse. I think you’re a bit drunk. Take a rest and— oomph.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When his hands touched her face, Sherri erased the smile from her face and pulled the man’s arms. After that, his lips met her lips. Then, the shocked man pushed her away and backed away slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wh-what the…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know me, right?” asked Sherri.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You remember me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t tell exactly through only a brief lip kiss, but Sherri’s gut feeling was telling her that the man in the robe was the man named Master whom she’d spent the night with last time. More than anything, from the beginning, his voice had been strangely familiar. She shook her head quietly to the man who asked a little excitedly what she had said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I was pretty drunk on that day. But your voice somehow seemed familiar.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was so rude on that day, madam. Didn’t you get hurt or something?” said the man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…how can you say that when you threw yourself at a drunken woman?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sherri frowned slightly because of the ridiculous way he asked if she was okay. It’s not that simple of a problem. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think he is rude per se, but the Master of the shop throws himself at a drunk customer? A VVIP?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man stood idly without a word for a moment and then opened his mouth again with a troubled voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I apologize for that, madam. But it was because you came on to me first. I was careful in my own way, but if a situation arises that I have to take responsibility for…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sherri interrupted him, “That’s enough. Don’t worry, there is no need for that. And you think I came on to you first?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His mouth appearing at the bottom of the hood twisted, and the man soon nodded. Sherri didn’t want to believe it, but she was a bit— no, she was very convinced. And at that time she had a lot of sexual desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, it had happened only once, but it was because while sleeping at another inn one time she had pulled a young worker who’d come to wake her up into her bed. Still, at that time, she hadn’t gotten drunk enough, so she hadn’t been able to go to the end. Even now, when she thought about how hard it was to get rid of the young worker whose eyes had turned red from only kissing, she still felt distant.</span></p>
