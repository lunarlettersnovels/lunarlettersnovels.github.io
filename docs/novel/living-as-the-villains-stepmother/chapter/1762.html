            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 16 – Adorable as a Puppy (2)</strong></p>
<p>“The water is clean.” Whispered Jane showing her the competence of the room.</p>
<p>She pointed to the jug of water on the table while picking it up and pouring it into a transparent cup. Clear water came out, water that looked suitable for a human being to drink, unlike the water previously.</p>
<p>“The air is also clean.”</p>
<p>Lila trusted this claim, as when she came in she could feel the fresh air circulating the room from all the open windows present. It was like she was standing outside.</p>
<p>Lila remembered that the towel on his head needed a replacement so she took it and quietly walked out to moisten and bring a new one.</p>
<p>“Ma’am please let me do it!”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, I want to do it. You don’t have to worry about it, Jane.”</p>
<p>When she returned with the replacement and lightly lay it on his forehead. A sudden idea sprang up to her mind.</p>
<p>“Jane, could you show me where the oven is please?”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>It wasn’t something mentioned very often in the original story, but Hir loved sweets.</p>
<p>Rose, was one of the maids in charge of cooking and was also the heroine of the story. Whenever she was busy she would give Hir a sweet as a gift. One of the only lights in his day.</p>
<p>“Surely … You are not saying that you will co-cook right?”</p>
<p>Jane, who followed Lila into the kitchen, stuttered from shock.</p>
<p>“That’s exactly what I’m saying”</p>
<p>“Ahh! I don’t think you should do that ma’am! Please, let me do it.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“My lady you can’t, can’t, can’t-”</p>
<p>“I can’t?”</p>
<p>Jane looked up slowly trying to see Lila’s expression. It seemed like she was trying to check if Lila was angry or offended in any way.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Jane. I understand what you mean, My baking skills aren’t that bad.” <em>I mean baking was quite literally the last thing I did before I died.</em></p>
<p>Laughing uncomfortably inside, Lila began to look for what she could make for Hir.</p>
<p>When she finally found ingredients that satisfied her, she began mixing the ingredients In hand. About five minutes later a mouth-watering aroma filled the kitchen, Jane looked very surprised, covering her mouth with both hands.</p>
<p>“It smells delicious?”</p>
<p>“I told you. My skills aren’t that bad.”</p>
<p>Since there was almond flour, Lila decided to make macaroons. It was personally one of her favorite desserts.</p>
<p>“Do you remember the day my lady made soup for the Viscount before you two got married?” said Jane quickly. Acting like she was focusing on the sweet aroma.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember well.”</p>
<p>“You burned the entire kitchen! So I thought you couldn’t cook at all. But now it seems that you were clearly hiding some potential.”</p>
<p>Lila was wondering why all the furniture looked relatively new.</p>
<p>“Huh are you sure I did that?”</p>
<p>“Yes! So everyone took refuge and was in a riot. Don’t you remember?”</p>
<p>“I mean it wasn’t too long ago.” Jane muttered.</p>
<p>It was an incident that was not in the original story that she read. So Lila made up a lame excuse to try and cover up.</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s right. I remember now. At that time, I was very tired so I forgot to turn off the heat.”</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness! But it could have been really dangerous!”</p>
<p>“Ah, suddenly thinking about it is making my head dizzy. I inhaled a lot of smoke that day and I didn’t feel well afterwards, so let’s not talk about this please,” said Lila, putting her hand over her forehead trying to add to her facade.</p>
<p>Lila slowly directed her eyes at Jane’s face, just to find features stained with worry. Lila seemed content with this outcome. <em>Good, it looks like she believed me, now back to my macarons.</em></p>
<p>The coque seemed to come out nicely, and the filling was delicious without tasting too buttery. Laughing satisfactorily, Lila put the oval-shaped coque into the oven.</p>
<p><em>Nice, it seems the hardest part is over.</em></p>
<p>All that was left was to spread the sweet chocolate cream over the chewy coque as a soft topping. Lila felt relieved since only the easier steps remained. She sat back on a chair and began waiting.</p>
<p>Lila didn’t wait for long. A loud banging noise made itself clear from the entrance of the mansion. Lila couldn’t believe her luck. It was as if certain elements of her previous life were following her to this one. She got up with a flustered look and stomped towards the front door. Jane trailed behind her hurriedly.</p>
<p>“Who’s causing all this banging?” Demanded Lila</p>
<p>“My lady! That is- !”</p>
<p>Jane was clearly astonished. It was almost like she knew exactly who this person would be.<br>
<em>But who would cause Jane to be in so much shock?</em></p>
<p>Lila lifted her head and looked out the window. A tall middle aged woman, who looked like she was quite stable financially appeared on the other side. She couldn’t recognize her from her first glance.</p>
<p>“Umm who is it?”</p>
<p>The woman began shouting but Lila couldn’t make out exactly what she was saying.</p>
<p>Lila felt the scared maid tugging at her dress “Ma-ma’am Fasha is making a surprise visit.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing her name, Lila remembered who she was immediately. <em>The Countess Fasha Marshmell, I should have guessed That Mrs Marshmell’s mother-in-law would come to visit</em>.</p>
<p>“You cannot come so unannounced, Countess!”</p>
<p>Now that she was paying attention Lila could make out what she was shouting about“I’m coming to visit my son’s mansion and you dare block my path?!”</p>
<p>“You, you need to make an appointment in advance-”</p>
<p>“What is this rubbish?! As if I need an appointment, open these doors at once!”</p>
<p>All of the mansion employees appeared at the front door with sweat heavily dripping down their foreheads. There was only one person who seemed completely calm in the current situation, Lila.</p>
