            <p><strong>Chapter 101 – Sharing More than a Gift (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>There’s definitely something weird about this.</em></p>
<p>Lila couldn’t wrap her head around why they should both share the same bedroom. If they were to actually fall in love with each other it would be a huge disaster. Lila flushed at where her train of thought led.</p>
<p><em>What if I ended up wanting to sleep with Lacias first?</em> She shooed away the thought as quickly as possible, she couldn’t have such thoughts when she was very busy. She would have a whole day of paperwork to go through anyways and at night she would be too exhausted to do anything. Not to mention how busy Lacias was.</p>
<p>It was actually unlikely that they would see each other too often. According to the original work; Lacias spent most of his time in the office rather than his bedroom, and he was always preoccupied with business. She wanted to believe that these were facts. But with his current unpredictable actions, she wasn’t very sure of herself.</p>
<p>Lila slowly glanced at Lacias and found a pair of eyes looking right back at her as if he were waiting for her to look at him. The moment she noticed his eyes, she felt an awkward sensation.</p>
<p><em>How is he so clean and rejuvenated?</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, her skin was getting dull from tiredness. Through the mirror, her reflection displayed a very exhausted and restless version of herself. Maybe this is why Jane was always worried about her. If it was so noticeable even in her own eyes, how could Lacias be so enthusiastic about her?</p>
<p><em>Was I the only one struggling to get the mines back, or was he relying on his servants and slacking off? </em>Lila squinted with suspicion.</p>
<p>“Lacias.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” He answered immediately.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you are busy these days?”</p>
<p>“Why?” He asked back without replying. Lila firmly closed her lips and frowned. Lacias noticed this, let out a brief shiver, and answered.</p>
<p>“I am a bit preoccupied these days. If I were not, I would’ve been following you around more often. What a bummer.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t follow me around even if you’re not busy.”</p>
<p>“Why? Are you sick of me … ?” Lacias’ blue eyes shook heavily, causing Lila to gasp.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t it obviously inappropriate to follow people around? What do mean why? How am I supposed to answer that question?</em></p>
<p>Having trouble finding an appropriate answer, Lila habitually tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Oh”</p>
<p>Her neatly tied-up hair loosened. Lila annoyingly held her hair from falling and caught all the falling pins. They may have broken off after the tiring day. Lila felt a little embarrassed at not knowing to tie her hair back since it was mostly done by a servant. She had very long thick hair, so it was quite arduous to tidy it. If she had a rubber band, she would have just tied it back. Lila had no other choice but to hold onto the pins and put her hair down. But just as she did she caught a pair of eyes peering intently to her hair.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me like that?” Lacias was staring at Lila as she was tidying up her hair. The slightly dilated pupils revealed a deeper blue.</p>
<p>“Just because.” Lacias calmly wondered for a while. Then, his eyes curled and smiled. He appeared as if he was not going to obediently reply.</p>
<p>“What did you ask again?”</p>
<p>“I asked If you were busy?” Mentioned Lila, with a little irritation in her voice.</p>
<p>“Right.” He still sounded like he was focused elsewhere. But Lila continued anyway.</p>
<p>“Because you didn’t look busy.”</p>
<p>“Oh really? I wonder why.”Lacias put his fist under his chin and pondered.</p>
<p>“You look so charming right now and you don’t seem tired at all.” She answered indifferently.</p>
<p>Lacias staggered for a second, then went on with his beaming personality. “Am I charming?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Don’t you look in the mirror?” How can one ask such a question with a face like that?</p>
<p>“Is it good to be charming?”</p>
<p>“Well … why not. Nobody would mind being charming.” Lila could no longer understand Lacias’s random questions.</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. ”Like a person who was satisfied after getting the answer he wanted, Lacias was smiling joyously. It was the grin that made him look even more charming than before.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Unlike the carriage that Lila and Lacias rode, the black carriage that followed them did not have the Wipere Family’s seal. On the contrary, the carriage seemed to want to hide its identity.</p>
<p>“Argh! I’m so angry!” The inside of the black carriage was noisy.  Roxana was tearing out her red hair with a grim contortion on her face. Lugar sat far away from her to avoid her sudden burst of anger, and Hizette just looked down quietly.</p>
<p>“Can’t believe we weren’t able to catch the hole again! It doesn’t make any sense? How didn’t we catch any? Argh!”</p>
<p>With every line, Roxana threw out a punch at the wall of the carriage, along with every kind of swear word Lugar could think of.</p>
<p>“At that rate, the carriage will break.” Squeaked Lugar trying to calm the ravaging beast. But that only added fuel to the flame, so Lugar had to come up with something to get her thinking twice.</p>
<p>“You’re going to break the carriage. Do you even know how much it costs? It’s probably more than all of our salaries combined. If you make even the slightest break I’m sure the duke is going to make you pay every penny.”</p>
<p>Lugar’s words certainly got to her, because at that she stopped punching the carriage walls and began punching the air instead “Argh!”</p>
