            <p><strong>Chapter 118 – Would It Make You Happy?</strong></p>
<p>“I’ll try.” She filled her head with thoughts of Lacias. When her mind tried to wander on how the party was proceeding, she focused on his face.</p>
<p>She heard from Roxanna, the day after they visited the training grounds, that Hizette had been chosen as Hir’s fencing instructor. She hadn’t been privy to the actual conversation, as she had been busy keeping track of Hir.</p>
<p>She felt relieved. <em>It’s just like the original story</em>, she thought</p>
<p>Lila asked casually. “Is it true that Hizette is Hir’s instructor?”</p>
<p>“That is whom Hir strongly favoured, so I couldn’t choose anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Really? Hir wanted him?”</p>
<p>Lacias nodded. <em>What did he mean?</em> Lila wondered. <em>Did Hir personally ask Lacias to make Hizette his instructor?</em> That didn’t seem right. Hir wasn’t the type to do that. She was about to put her questions into words when Lacias offered her the answer.</p>
<p>“All I did was look at Hir’s eyes.”</p>
<p>“Eyes?”</p>
<p>“Yes. They told me whom Hir wanted. I find it’s the most effective when you train from somebody you admire.”</p>
<p>“I see.” She nodded, amazed that Hir chose Hizette. She hadn’t noticed Hir’s admiration, even standing right next to him. It all came back to the original story. Was she able to change the outcome? Or, no matter how hard she tried, was the plot fixed?</p>
<p>“Not again.” Lacias drew her out of her internal questioning.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You’re lost in thought again.” He didn’t sound annoyed. He simply wanted to keep Lila focused.</p>
<p>Lacias raised his hands and covered Lila’s cheeks. His grip wasn’t firm, but she felt like her cheeks were puffy. She grimaced at the thought that her face might look like a balloon, or perhaps an octopus.</p>
<p>Lacias chuckled. “What is bothering you that you make such a face? Sometimes I wish I could know what you are thinking. Honestly, I wish I could read your thoughts.” He gazed into her violet eyes.</p>
<p>Lila couldn’t tell him that she wished the same thing. She just stared back into his eyes.</p>
<p>“Maybe then I could impress you,” he said, sheepishly.</p>
<p>“You’re good enough as you are. Please don’t worry about such things,” Lila responded.</p>
<p>The carriage suddenly seemed to be warmer than it had been moments ago. <em>When are we going to arrive? </em>she wondered, feeling suddenly uncomfortable. They had not traveled a great distance, and yet this ride seemed longer than usual for some reason.</p>
<p>“Please hold my hand,” Lacias said, as he stepped down from the carriage and held out his large hand to Lila. It was then that she first noticed the cut across his palm. Based on how much it faded, it must have been a scar from a long time ago. There was no mention about an injury in the original story, so when was he hurt?</p>
<p>Lacias awkwardly smiled, when he noticed Lila gazing at the old wound, and gave her the opposite hand instead. He seemed embarrassed and reluctant to explain. He must have always offered his unmarked hand in the past. Why else had she not noticed it? And why was he trying to hide it from her? Lila wanted to ask, but he appeared to want to stay silent on the matter.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Lila said as she stepped down from the carriage. She usually didn’t accept someone’s help while getting off, always jumping out of the carriage on her own.</p>
<p>“You are very welcome,” Lacias replied. They were going to pretend like nothing happened. Lacias kept hold of her hand and hummed as he swung their clenched palms between them.</p>
<p>“It would be best to enter like this,” he informed her.</p>
<p>“How would this help?” Lila asked, knowing full well that gossip would spread about their intimate relationship. Even though it would be advantageous to Lila, she was not fond of rumours.</p>
<p>“My feelings?”</p>
<p>“Pardon me?”</p>
<p>“I said it would help my feelings.” He blurted out.</p>
<p>Lila burst out laughing at the unexpected response. Lacias blushed in shyness.</p>
<p>They could hear music when they approached the entrance to the party. The subtle melody soothed their minds. This must have been Edith’s decision. The gentle music was a polar opposite to Senior’s impatient personality. It was vital for her to present herself as gentle and subtle to the dukes.</p>
<p>As Lila and Lacias entered the party hall, Lugar, who had arrived in the next carriage, greeted them with courtesy. “I’ll be covering you nearby.” <em>Was he aware of all the people around? He was acting exceptionally stiff and restrained, always the soldier.</em></p>
<p>Lacias impatiently nodded and waved his hand and shooed him away. “I won’t summon you, so go have fun.”</p>
<p>“No, thank you. I shall guard you with vigilance,” Lugar insisted.</p>
<p>“You’re dismissed.” Lacias was getting annoyed.</p>
<p>“Yes sir, if you need anything…”</p>
<p>“Go.”</p>
<p>“Okay!” Lugar bowed deeply and left. Roxanna, who had exited a carriage, tried to approach. Lugar whispered something to her, to which she nodded and remained in place.</p>
<p>The security guard, at the home, recognized their faces and, without additional confirmation, opened the door wide. The music grew with intensity</p>
<p>Lacias turned to Lila and whispered in a low voice, “Put your hand on my arm.”</p>
<p>“Hold hands and lock arms?” Lila asked</p>
<p>“Yes. Why not do both?”</p>
<p>“Would it make you happy?”</p>
<p>“Is that a rhetorical question? Of course, I’ll be closer to you.” He said with a wink.</p>
