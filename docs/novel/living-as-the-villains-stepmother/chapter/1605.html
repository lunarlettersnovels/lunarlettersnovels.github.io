            <p><strong>Chapter 187 – In the Same Bed</strong></p>
<p>“I’m okay.”</p>
<p>“Are you dizzy?” Lacias usual emotionless voice was filled with concern for once. “Was today’s schedule too burdensome? I’m worried for you.”</p>
<p>“I’m okay, really. I just needed some time alone.”</p>
<p>Lacias couldn’t leave his wife alone after hearing that she turned down all the maids from entering, he knew something was wrong.</p>
<p>“Time alone? That means you’re very tired. You need to relax your tense muscles a little to relieve your fatigue, Lila.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you a massage,” he offered with a straight face.</p>
<p>“You?!” Lila was stunned.</p>
<p><em>Lacias serving someone?</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t help but smile at the combination of words, they seemed very polar. It was hard to imagine Lacias ‘serving’ anyone because he would never have to do such a thing growing up to be the Duke. However, from his tone, he seemed quite eager to do a servant’s job.</p>
<p><em>Then should I say yes?</em></p>
<p>A part of her wanted to reject Lacias’ offer, saying she would just ask her maid to do it for her, but today was a little different. She wanted Lacias to look after her, perhaps because she felt exhausted after confronting Doug Blake.</p>
<p><em>Am I feeling anxious right now? How will he react if he finds out who I really am? Will he express disgust when he learns that I came from a different world? What if he treats me like a mentally ill person?</em></p>
<p>It felt like she wanted to reconfirm his love because of her uneasy feelings, but Lila decided that she would focus on what she wanted at the moment.</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you. Please do it for me.”</p>
<p>He seemed happy at her acceptance. “Trust me. I did it many times when I was training. I’m pretty good at it.”</p>
<p>Before she could change her mind, Lacias tucked his arms behind her waist until she could feel the muscular stiffness of his forearms.</p>
<p>Just then, Lacias lifted her like a feather, and a sound that wasn’t quite a scream left her mouth. Of course, Lila knew that he was strong enough to carry her around anywhere, but she was just startled by the sudden lift from the couch.</p>
<p>“Did I surprise you? I’m sorry. But I’ve been holding back my urge to hug you from a while ago.”</p>
<p>“No. I was just a little startled, but It’s fine.”</p>
<p>Lacias’s eyes locked onto hers while he tightly held her in his arms. He liked the way she embraced him tightly around the neck. Now, they are finally a picture of a real couple.</p>
<p>Trying to keep his balance, Lacias took a deep breath as he buried his face into Lila’s nape. “I almost went crazy. You’ll never know how much I wanted to hold you like this and smell your scent.”</p>
<p>For some reason, he was showing her more affection than usual. But she didn’t feel uncomfortable at all; rather, she felt mixed feelings of happiness and relief.</p>
<p>“I feel a sense of security,” he said.</p>
<p>At the word ‘security’, her heart couldn’t help but melt. It was proof that she gave him a feeling that Lacias from the original novel would never have received.</p>
<p><em>Things that only I can do…</em></p>
<p>Ever since Lila had entered this world, she was busy trying to prove her value using the advantage of knowing how the story goes, forming relationships, and acting as if she had a forward-looking insight. But for the first time, she felt like she was being helpful.</p>
<p>Lila slowly opened her mouth. “Lacias.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” He answered in a sweet voice.</p>
<p>“Do you like me?”</p>
<p>Lacias retracted his face from her nape as answer. Eyes that were cold enough to scare people off were replaced by a set of wide confused pupils.</p>
<p><em>So cute….</em></p>
<p>It had always been Lila who had to look up because of their considerable height difference. But this time, it was Lacias who had his waist bent, looking up at Lila like a confused child.</p>
<p><em>Every time he makes that face, it reminds me of Hir.</em></p>
<p>The saying that ‘the apple never falls far from the tree’ came to her mind. Of course, they weren’t related, but in her mind they were.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking such an obvious question?” He finally asked.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing in this world that’s obvious.”</p>
<p>“True, but there is one thing that is. I guess you don’t know how much I want you.” He appeared incredulous.</p>
<p>“Did I really sound silly?”</p>
<p>“A little.” Lacias grinned as he carried Lila to the bed. His smile was unwavering as he did so.</p>
<p><em>If I hadn’t come here, he would have lived his life not knowing how to smile, not knowing what love and happiness are.</em></p>
<p>Seeing the man living a completely different life from the novel, Lila realized the reason for her existence. Unpleasant thoughts that swayed her began to fade away. She felt like she was sharing the same feeling with Lacias–peace.</p>
<p>“Careful.” Lacias carefully put her down on the bed as if he was carrying the most precious thing in the world. It wasn’t necessary though as the bed was of the highest quality in the empire. Even if she were tossed onto it, she wouldn’t feel even a trace of pain or discomfort.</p>
<p>Lacias laid her in the most comfortable position then dragged a chair next to the bed. He took a seat.</p>
<p>As gentle as possible, he held Lila’s arm and began to massage it. When she turned her gaze from her arm to his face, she was met with the sweetest pair of eyes she had ever seen. Lila had no means of explaining it but she could feel the affection dripping from his orbs.</p>
<p>“Why is your wrist still so thin? You should eat more and have more snacks.”</p>
<p>“I’m much healthier than before.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t see any difference.”</p>
<p>“Then you’re an unobservant.”</p>
<p>Lacias laughed as he shook his head. It was certainly not appropriate to say that to an army general.</p>
<p>He massaged her forearm a little harder. “How about this? Is it okay?”</p>
<p>Lila shook her head nimbly, “It doesn’t hurt at all. See? I’m healthier and stronger than you think. It’s fine if you do it harder.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’ll break your arm if I put more strength into it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know better than me that human bones don’t break that easily?”</p>
<p>“How can I not worry? You’re Lila. I consider every possible situation.” Even though he was talking big, Lacias was putting very little strength into his hand. He was just holding her arm a little tighter than usual and being very dramatic about it.</p>
