            <p><b>Chapter 158</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lila was calm and collected as she prepared the gift. However, when it’s time to go to Lacias’ office to hand it to him, she grew increasingly nervous that her cheeks flushed red and she couldn’t keep herself still. She paced back and forth while holding onto a box she elegantly wrapped in blacks and whites. It was already getting dark by the minute, and Lila didn’t have much time left. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wedding was set for tomorrow, and it would be difficult to talk to Lacias then; personal conversations won’t be possible until the official event is over. With that said, Lila wasn’t even sure if she would have the time to deliver the gift herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, she doesn’t want to give it to him out of nowhere since that wouldn’t be romantic in the slightest. This was not just a simple gift after all; she had put so much thought in having it made. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulling herself together, Lila took a deep breath and urged herself to go there right now. She stood from where she was seated beside the window and paused. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“… Five minutes. I’ll go in five minutes.” She sat back down and drummed her fingers on her lap, wondering if she ever felt this shy before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that she thought about it, it’s actually the first time she felt this nervous seeing Lacias. Maybe it’s because they are getting married tomorrow, but the simple act of going there and visiting Lacias was something she found hard doing. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see him everyday, get a grip of yourself!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the days went by, the more it was hard for Lila to look at him. Whenever they made accidental eye contact, Lila immediately tore her eyes off him and looked at nothing in particular. But there were also times when she would slyly glance at him when he wasn’t looking.   </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wew. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took a series of deep breaths to even out her breathing. Feeling less nervous, she realized she barely had any time left and she had no choice but to go and get it over with, or else she wouldn’t be able to give him her gift. Holding the elegantly-wrapped box in her hand, she turned around and strode out of the room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s not here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took her a lot of willpower to come visit him in his office, but Lacias wasn’t there. Where was he at this hour? It’s already so late at night. She asked the servant if he had any idea where Lacias was but he only shook his head in response. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lila decided that maybe she should just go back to her room, then, a random thought popped into her head. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could it be he’s lounging at Hir’s swing in the garden?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He once told her he regularly goes there whenever he needs to clear his head, so it’s entirely possible he’s at the garden at this time of night. She won’t find Lacias in her room anyway, so might as well go there and check. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lila walked to the direction leading to the garden, noticing her surroundings were quiet and peaceful since the knights’ daily training was over. No one was outside anymore save for a few guards stationed everywhere in the mansion. As Lila followed the stone path, she passed by a few guards who were surprised at her sudden appearance. But before Lila could notice, they quickly schooled their features back to its neutral expression and avoided her eyes. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope he’s here.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she didn’t get to see him tonight, then Lila would have to wait outside his bedroom or visit him before the wedding started. She hoped to see him in the garden, though, so she could finally hand him her gift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lacias?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stepping into the garden, she saw a figure underneath the tree, sitting on the swing set. She couldn’t see his face clearly because of the dimness, “Lacias? Is that you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No answer. Lila’s eyebrows knitted in confusion as she took several steps closer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh. It really was Lacias. His eyes were closed under the shade, and Lila thought he’s probably asleep.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Lacias was sensitive to even the most minute of sounds. If it were under normal circumstances, his eyes would surely fly open at the sound of Lila’s footsteps that she wouldn’t need to call for him. Lila waved her hand in front of his face, seeing his lips move slightly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re playing with me, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I saw your lips move, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacias chuckled and said, “You really have sharp eyes, huh?” He teased like a child would, his eyes half-open. “Did you come here to see me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. I went to see you in your office but you weren’t there. So I decided to go here just in case. And it looks like I was right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lila sat next to the large tree Lacias was leaning on. Twigs and branches faintly cracked under her weight and sitting there felt uncomfortable. She glanced down and shifted until she’s seated comfortably and Lacias, without missing a beat, took his coat off.</span></p>
