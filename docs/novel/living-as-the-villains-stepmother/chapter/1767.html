            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 11 – Into the Lion’s Den (1)</strong></p>
<p>Lila was startled from hearing this. She was so lost in her thoughts that she hadn’t even noticed that the carriage was moving, let alone notice that the carriage had reached its destination. Nevertheless she got off the carriage on hearing that and the horseman, who was waiting to help her step down, was caught off guard, and Lila just continued walking proudly not taking notice of him.</p>
<p>She didn’t get very far, because ahead of her a looming structure caught her eye. Even though the book had described the estate with much detail, it was still very different seeing it in person. The structure looked like an independent castle, with several mansions surrounding it, which would overwhelm the rich as well as the poor.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” As Lila was still trying to grasp the scene in front of her, a guard came rushing towards her.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ve come to see the Duke of Weifel.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, but did you make an appointment?” The guard wasn’t doubtful. It was because he had confirmed on his way to work that there were no visitors to the Weifel mansion today.</p>
<p>“Yes. Go tell Lacias. Lila’s here.”</p>
<p>Of course, it was a lie and the guard knew that. But Lila’s confidence and beauty made the guard doubt his own information. Her face seemed to come with an angelic aura that he couldn’t bear to send back. Besides, she’d talked to him in such a friendly manner. So he was certain that she wouldn’t lie.</p>
<p>“I’ll report to the Duke first and then open the door. Would you please wait a moment?”</p>
<p>Lila was a little surprised that he accepted her request without any bargain, not knowing that she had just pulled the strings of the guard, she continued.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Lila’s face showed no change in expression, but she had  already given up.</p>
<p><em>Surely Lacias wouldn’t open the door</em></p>
<p>The guard had been gone for quite some time now and Lila was beginning to doubt if he would ever return, just when she started feeling tired of waiting it became worse.</p>
<p><em><strong>Drip drip. Drip drip drip drip</strong></em></p>
<p>Lila’s shoulders were getting wet as rain began pouring down from the grey skies, it was light at first but it was getting heavier over time.</p>
<p><em>This is just … Perfect.</em> Thought Lila to herself sarcastically</p>
<p>She would get cold  soon, and she hadn’t even brought with her an umbrella. The truth was that she hadn’t expected it to rain, as the clouds were showing no signs of rain earlier. But Lila was again reminded that nature can be unpredictable. Lila sighed heavily and was thinking about her chances of getting cold that day, when she was interrupted by a familiar face.</p>
<p>“Lady Lila?”</p>
<p>“Have you informed the Duke?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He probably instantly refused to meet her. However, no matter what he would say Lila was determined. Even if he told her to go back, she would stubbornly stay in the heavy rain until a deal was met. Even if it took the entire day standing in the rain.</p>
<p><em>I don’t care what cold I get! I’m staying here unti-</em></p>
<p>“Come inside. I’ll show you the way.”</p>
<p>“Uhh … what?”</p>
<p>Lila was definitely not expecting for him to accept her on her tenth try, mine as well accept her on her first try. She was completely astounded by this discovery.</p>
<p>“He’s ready to meet me? … now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, now.”</p>
<p><em>What’s going on? Was the Duke really ready to meet her? This is uncharacteristic of him, where was the hesitation from his side?</em></p>
<p>She was very surprised that Lacias accepted her already but deep down she was glad that no time had to be wasted, and she was now one step closer to helping Hir. The guard led her inside the giant mansion, down a long hall with a giant wooden door at the end that was locked shut. Near the door was a smaller, more formal door. Lila was considering how lucky she was with this occurrence and vowing to herself that she wouldn’t be held back by anything, no matter how horrible her luck may become.</p>
<p><em><strong>KNOCK, KNOCK!</strong></em></p>
<p>“Duke, I brought the Lady.”</p>
<p>She thought she’d be led to the drawing room to wait in. Unexpectedly, it seemed to be Lacias’ private working spot. As she spotted a large work table with bookshelves on the side, but she couldn’t see the entire room, due to it being covered by a shade.</p>
<p>“You may enter.”</p>
<p>The guard opened the door, bowed his head to Lila, then backed away. Lila stepped inside without hesitation.</p>
<p><em>It would be pathetic to visit the lion’s den, but hesitate while entering it.</em></p>
<p>“Oh, you’re here?”</p>
<p>Lila was a little surprised to see Lacias standing at the door. Wondering how she hadn’t noticed him as she looked in. And now that she saw him in-person, she realised that the description of a cold-blooded man didn’t seem to suit his demeanor. Not with a smile that bright at least.</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting for you, wondering when you’d come to see me. I guess I made a good assumption, right?</p>
<p>Something wasn’t right, She thought he was a lion. But the description that suited him more was a pretty cat rather than a lion. She had to get to the bottom of this. <em>For the greater good!</em></p>
