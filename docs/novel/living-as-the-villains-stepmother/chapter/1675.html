            <p><strong>Chapter 117 – When You’re With Me</strong></p>
<p>Because Roxana showed respect to Hir and treated him like a young master, the other knights also accepted Hir as an equal. Age was not relevant when it came to authority. It helped strengthen the bond between student and teacher when training began at a younger age.</p>
<p><em>This is strange,</em> Lila thought. Hir’s treatment was completely different than in the original story. In what she read, Hir had been mistreated by the knights even after Lacias adopted him. It remained the simple fact of Hir being introduced now, already a lord and worthy of respect.</p>
<p>“Should I recommend a couple of good individuals?” Roxana suggested, when she noticed Lacias examining the knights.</p>
<p>Lacias shook his head. “No need. Already decided.”</p>
<p>Lila’s ears perked up. “What? Who is it?”</p>
<p>In the original story, no one in the knights templar wanted to be involved with Hir. They saw training a child as bothersome, so nobody volunteered to be Hir’s coach. At that point, Hizette offered to help Hir, and thanks to him, Hir became the heir of Wipere.</p>
<p><em>It would be perfect if Hizette was the one Lacias picked to be Hir’s fencing coach,</em> Lila thought. Hizette has proven his skill. Hir would show remarkable progress if he receives training from Hizette. She glanced at the knight. Unlike the other knights who were desperate to be chosen, Hizette apathetically swiped the blade of his sword with his fingertips.</p>
<p><em>Everything’s different, </em>Lila mused. It appeared Hizette would not become Hir’s fencing coach. It didn’t matter, as long as Hir could develop his skills. She was curious who it would be.</p>
<p>Lila turned her head to look at Lacias, who must have been watching her this whole time, as she locked eyes with him. Lacias grinned slowly.</p>
<p>“It’s Hir’s decision to learn fencing. It would be best if he’s taught by someone who he favours,” he announced.</p>
<p>“And who does the young master favour?” Roxana asked.</p>
<p>To answer that question, Lacias motioned to someone with the tip of his chin.</p>
<p>Roxanna followed the direction of Lacias’ chin. The person Lacias was pointing at was none other than Hir.</p>
<p>“It’s so obvious that I can’t ignore it at this point,” Lacias said.</p>
<p>“Obvious?” Roxanna looked at Hir, wondering what he meant, but she didn’t notice anything other than the boy’s round, shiny eyes. She turned back to Lacias with a puzzled face.</p>
<p>Lacias clicked his tongue. “How did you become the leader of the knights without being observant?”</p>
<p>“You named me the leader,” Roxana replied.</p>
<p>“You were the best among the others, which isn’t saying much.” Roxanna looked stunned at this revelation. “Unfortunately, there’s no one else suitable to be leader. What was I thinking?”</p>
<p>“I apologize sir. I’ll try harder.” Roxanna’s face flushed with frustration. Why was she being reprimanded for nothing? She glanced as Lacias pointed at Hir again. This time she saw who Hir was looking at. The knight with the red eyes and smooth silver hair. The knight who didn’t look anything like a fencer.</p>
<p>“Hizette? Why does the young master favour Hizette?” she asked.</p>
<p>Hir, who was standing beside Lila, could not stop staring at Hizette. The boy’s eyes reflected pure admiration, which was unexpected. Young children tended to admire men who were stronger, more muscular. Hizette was the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Hizette used to loathe himself for his pretty looks that did not match the stereotype of a knight. However, Hizette had changed. He had improved his strength and mental state. He exuded an entirely different aura, and that made Hir admire him.</p>
<p>“Make sure to tell Hizette to teach Hir how to control a sword.” Lacias instructed, then turned away.</p>
<p>“I will make sure, master.” Roxanna responded as he walked away. She then headed back to the training.</p>
<p>“I think we’re done here. Shall we leave now?” Lacias smiled sweetly at Lila and Hir, who looked up when he heard the voice.</p>
<p>Lacias blue eyes glistened like the ocean, captivating Lila for a moment before she nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A party hosted by Senior was being held. Dawson Hiln was jealous, but he had no right to cancel it. Of course, if Dawson insisted, the party could have been canceled. Dawson looked down on Senior, who he found annoying, but not a threat. Because of that he allowed the party to continue.</p>
<p>As the party was to prove Senior’s power among the Hilns, Edith meticulously examined all the dishes, furniture placement, and even the colours of the flowers.</p>
<p>The main colour should have been orange, which was the official colour of Hiln. It surprised Lila that they decided to change the main colour theme.</p>
<p><em>It’s Edith. She’ll do well on her own</em>, Lila thought. Besides, it wasn’t a bad idea to use a different colour to emphasize Senior’s existence. Orange might remind everyone of Dawson Hiln. Edith was reliable and could handle this.</p>
<p>As Lila stared blankly at the sky through the window, she felt a tickle on her cheek. Lacias, who sat beside her, lightly caressed her face. The finger had been so gentle that it gave her goosebumps. She flustered at the nonchalant, physical contact. Why was she so embarrassed?</p>
<p>Lila tilted her head to hide the reddening of her cheeks, as she asked, “Why did you poke me?”</p>
<p>“What are you thinking so hard about?” Lacias enquired.</p>
<p>“About today’s party.”</p>
<p>“Worried?”</p>
<p>Lila shook her head. She didn’t know how to put her current feelings into words. She wasn’t exactly worried. Lacias could see her struggling and chuckled.</p>
<p>“Why are you always zoned out in the carriage? It disappoints me.”</p>
<p>“Was I?”</p>
<p>“From what I saw.” Lacias tapped on the window. “You always look out the window, and never at me.”</p>
<p>She hadn’t realized she did that. “I think too much. That’s the reason”</p>
<p>“Try not to overthink things when you’re with me. I’m always busy admiring you when we’re together.”</p>
