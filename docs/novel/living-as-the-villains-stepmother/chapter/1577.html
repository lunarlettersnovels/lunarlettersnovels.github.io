            <p><strong>Chapter 215</strong></p>
<p>Lila handed him the document given to her by Hizette and he pretended to reread it.</p>
<p>“Aha. I see… But is this urgent? Does it need to be done now? Right now?”</p>
<p>Before Lila could even respond Lacias began talking again. “Anyways, I have something more urgent, it needs to be done now, right now.”</p>
<p>“Hm. What is it?”</p>
<p>“Do you have time for a bit? Like… 2 hours?”</p>
<p>Lila started thinking about her schedule. “2 hours? Yes, I think would be ok.”</p>
<p>At first, Lila was a bit surprised that he wanted 2 hours of her time, but she knew that Lacias wouldn’t normally ask her like this, so she accepted. Not to mention that she didn’t have much time left with him.</p>
<p>When Lila’s permission came, Lacias’s blue eyes shot to Hizette, signaling him to get lost. Normally a person would feel humiliated, but the knight got up and left the office without a word as if he was used to it.</p>
<p>“So, what is going on?” she finally asked.</p>
<p>“Lila, there’s something we must do. Right now.”</p>
<p>Lila couldn’t hide her excitement. “Right now? So what is it?”</p>
<p>Lacias stood straight and cleared his throat as if he were about to give a prepared speech. “A nap. We have to take a nap.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?” Lila replayed what she just heard in her mind, <em>I must have heard him wrong </em>she thought. <em>Or Lacias was being weird again. </em>“A… nap?”</p>
<p>The whole situation was a little off-putting, she didn’t even think she would hear the words ‘a nap’ come out of Lacias’s mouth. She felt like it didn’t suit him at all. “Are you for real?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Of course.”</p>
<p>“A nap? You?”</p>
<p>“To be precise with <em>you</em>, Lila.”</p>
<p>Lila really couldn’t understand where he got the idea. But she didn’t mind it. Whatever it was she was doing with him, she would be happy as long as they were together. In fact, she was happy to share some love with him as her last memory instead of work.</p>
<p>Lila chuckled a little before answering. “Ok. A nap. That’s good. How long has it been since I last took one?”</p>
<p>“I heard that if you take a nap, your work efficiency goes up.” Lacias purposefully didn’t mention that he heard that from himself.</p>
<p>“It feels like it’s a little late for a nap but sure.”</p>
<p>“Does that matter?” he asked confidently.</p>
<p>Lacias buried his face into Lila’s embrace. The flower scent and unknown sweetness seemed to stimulate the cells in his body one by one. His hands instinctively rose to Lila’s hair, and he began to stroke her neck.</p>
<p>Lila lifted her brow despite enjoying the feeling. “I thought you came for a nap?”</p>
<p>“You’re right. Look at my bloodshot eyes. I can’t hold back since I’m so tired.”</p>
<p>“But why does it look like you have no intention of sleeping?”</p>
<p>“I do, I want to sleep with you.”</p>
<p>Lacias took his face off Lila and smiled at her. It looked like a mischievous boy’s face. She patted Lacias’s black hair. It felt like patting Hir’s hair.</p>
<p>Although it was Lacias who came wanting to sleep, Lila felt like she was going to fall asleep first as she felt her eyelids getting the best of her as she continued brushing Lacia’s hair.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“What a shame.”</p>
<p>“Then how about thinking it over again now?” Hizette tried to hide the sorrow in his eyes when asking the question.</p>
<p>Lila stared at him and shook her head. “How can I think it over when we’ve come this far. Wouldn’t the plan you made have gone to waste?”</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>Lila was impressed by his confidence. “Well, I feel like it would have.”</p>
<p>Her dark blue robe waved in the wind adding a dramatic effect to her departure from the looming mansion. It felt like she was kicked out of the place she was living in comfortably, with all her favorite people living with her.</p>
<p><em>Just today I made so many lovely memories.</em></p>
<p>After their nap together, Lacias would keep returning to spend some more time together, but she was forced to refuse him. Time was running and Hizette was waiting for her. She even refused Hir’s offer to bake some cookies with him. It was time to leave.</p>
<p>“Are you ok?” Hizette asked as Lila’s eyes looked sad.</p>
<p>“I’m ok. I have to be.” She didn’t have room to regret her decision. Lila had to hypnotize herself into remembering that this was the right move to make for everyone to be happy.</p>
<p>“Then you’re leaving?”</p>
<p>“Mhm. Let’s leave.”</p>
<p>If Hizette didn’t say it first, she would’ve kept staring at the mansion and had all kinds of memories disrupt her thoughts. But thankfully, Hizette woke her senses up. If she was caught leaving it would cause all sorts of trouble.</p>
