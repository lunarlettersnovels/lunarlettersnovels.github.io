            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 95 – Rendezvous (2)</strong></p>
<p>At this point, Lila didn’t know what else to think. It felt like she was backed into a dead end, unable to grasp what’s being presented to her. Lila forced herself to relax and threw on a stiff smile.</p>
<p>Now was not the time to dwell on that. Lila placed her elbows atop the table and regarded Edith with a piercing look.  “So is there a reason why you resorted to such an unusual way to contact me? I don’t suppose you’re expecting something in return, for having given me a gift?</p>
<p>Edith visibly jumped at Lila’s words. Her eyes grew wide as she hastily shook her hands in defense. “Absolutely not! Why would I do such a thing? I gave those gifts out of good intentions!”</p>
<p>Wait, did she just say ‘gifts’? It seemed like Edith had sent her various gifts, and the single pair of earrings was one of them.</p>
<p>Lila straightened her back. “Miss Edith, do you remember how many times you’ve sent me cards?”</p>
<p>Edith nodded. “Yes. Twenty three times to be exact.”</p>
<p>“And how many of those came with gifts?” Lila prodded.</p>
<p>“Eight of them came with gifts.” Edith answered her questions without fail, not seeming to sense anything strange about Lila’s questions.</p>
<p>But it didn’t make any sense. From what she remembered, Mrs. Marshmell had only kept eight cards. Perhaps she only kept those that didn’t come with any gifts. But what reasons did Mrs. Marshmell have? Lila was having a difficult time figuring out Mrs. Marshmell’s intentions, and she was only broken out of her introspections when Edith continued on.</p>
<p>“So… did you know it was me?” She asked.</p>
<p>Lila smiled stiffly. “I had no idea it was you all along. I was completely unaware until today.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Edith laughed, pleased by how everything turned out. “I guessed as much. You’re surprised, right?” She brushed her hair behind her back and went on chatting with Lila like they were the best of friends, and Lila could feel how ecstatic Edith was.</p>
<p>She studied Edith carefully, noting the excitement in Edith’s voice as she went on and on. “Miss Edith.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“So is there a reason why you’ve been sending me cards and gifts? I came here because I was so curious about it.”</p>
<p>Edith shrugged. “I initially sent you gifts simply because I like you. But now… I want to give you my utmost support.”</p>
<p>Lila quirked a brow. “Support? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“A supporter is a supporter. That’s all there is.” Edith replied casually, not bothering to explain further.</p>
<p>But why does she want to help her? What exactly would she gain from this?</p>
<p>Edith didn’t share any particular connections with Mrs. Marshmell, which was why her offering Lila a helping hand was all the more surprising.</p>
<p>Edith smiled at Lila’s apparent confusion. “You’ve been hanging out with Senior Hiln a lot lately, haven’t you? I just think that something is going on between the two of you and curiosity is getting the best of me. But even with that said, I didn’t dig anything up. I shut my mouth, and opted to ask you directly.”</p>
<p>Lila only stared at her. Realizing the extent of Edith’s abilities of finding out information as fast as she could. Having Edith around seemed a smart idea, smarter than paying experts a hefty amount of price to get information with her own hands.</p>
<p>A supporter of hers…</p>
<p>Lila did spend a lot of money to get information. It also dawned on her that she had to wait for quite some time before finding out what was going on inside the Hiln family. Both time and money would be saved if Edith was right beside her, helping her the best way she knew how.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be so suspicious of me, you know. There’s nothing I want from you anyway. You can just throw this idea out if you’re skeptical about it.” Edith spoke with honesty in her voice, and a small smile played on her lips.</p>
<p>Lila leaned back on her chair as she tapped the table with her fingers. She fixed her eyes on Edith while thoughts of using her to her advantage reeled in her head.</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>“… Really?” Edith abruptly stood up from her seat in sheer excitement, making the chair screech audibly against the floor. Her hands flew to her mouth as she stammered, “Did I hear you right?”</p>
<p>Lila gave her a brief nod. “You did. Sit down, please.”</p>
<p>Edith sat back down, gathering her composure as she fanned her flushed face with her hands, smiling warmly. Lila scanned her face to see if there’s any semblance of malice, a motive behind her intentions, but so far Edith appeared to be sincere. Unless she’s great at deceiving people, that is, then this does not seem like a bad idea. Edith clearly had a liking towards Lila the same way Lila had for Hir, and she would surely use this to her advantage.</p>
<p>“Let’s put it into writing, shall we? A contract, perhaps?” Lila said.</p>
<p>Edith’s eyebrows raised in confusion. “A contract?”</p>
<p>Lila hummed. “Yes. Words are wind, as we all know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s necessary.” Edith responded with a wave of her hand.</p>
<p>“I require it.” Lila spoke with resolution. Edith acquiesced to Lila’s wishes and nodded hastily.</p>
<p>“I will see to it then.”</p>
<p>Lila threw her a soft smile. Edith flushed for the second time, thrilled of being at the receiving end of Lila’s grace. It seemed like practicing schooling her expressions in front of the mirror was a good idea after all, Lila thought to herself. Pleased with how everything turned out, Lila leaned back on the chair and glanced at the window beside her, tipped her head once and immediately a man that had a friendly smile on his face appeared and waved.</p>
<p>“Who is this? Oh, it’s Sir Lugar Ecarte!” Edith exclaimed.</p>
