            <p><strong>Chapter 219</strong></p>
<p>Hizette hadn’t even spared the candlestick a second glance, but he knew of Lila’s tendency to want gold more. She stared at the candlestick a little longer, and he could tell she wanted it. She placed it in the shopping basket. He glanced at it and saw that there were already quite a few items inside it.</p>
<p>“When did you put so much on?” he asked. Then, a second later, he offered, “I’ll hold it.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay,” she replied quickly. “I set it on the floor when I’m looking around, anyways. You should go take a look around, too, Hizette. If I have to pick something, I’ll call you again.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “If you insist.”</p>
<p>He had no idea what to look for in here, but shopping with Lila was somewhat enjoyable. Feeling a flutter of excitement, he glanced around the store until something caught his eye.</p>
<p>“I…I see the resemblance,” he muttered.</p>
<p>It was a small, scented candle shaped like a fairy. The scent reminded Hizette vaguely of a garden, which he thought fit Lila very much. Not to mention the fairy’s face was oddly similar to hers. He quietly packed the candle. It would be a fitting present for Lila.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“It’s going to take a while to organize all this.”</p>
<p>Hizette’s hands were full of items. Lila had really picked to her heart’s content. It was almost as though she was spending on herself for the first time, since she hadn’t had the opportunity to enjoy herself before.</p>
<p>Lila began unpacking the items she’d bought for herself for the first time ever.</p>
<p>“They said it’ll take three to five days to install the fireplace,” Hizette told her.</p>
<p>“That’s okay. I can wait. It’s not that cold anyway.”</p>
<p>“Eat warm food until the fireplace comes.”</p>
<p>“You worry too much. Stop nagging and help me.” She set a tablecloth over the clean wooden table, then proceeded to decorate the golden candlestick, setting down a fruit basket and an oval shaped plate with bread on it. The decorating continued into the living room and then to the bedroom. Soon, the rooms started to seem a bit more livable. Lila looked at the newly decorated house and let out a satisfied sigh.</p>
<p>In her previous life, she’d never once thought of any place as her home, even when she was paying rent. She’d thought of Lacias’s mansion as a place she was simply brushing by.</p>
<p>But for the first time, it felt like she’d finally gotten her own home.</p>
<p>Keeping his gaze on her, Hizette quietly set his gift down on the table. It would take a bit of time for her to notice it, since it wasn’t something big. He wanted to let her know how much he’d like her to light up her new chapter in life, but he knew he wasn’t good at talking. So he decided to simply leave the gift.</p>
<p>“It’s time for me to go back, Lila.”</p>
<p>“Already?” The corners of her mouth turned downward. “Darn…I didn’t even get to treat you.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t want that, anyway, so it’s okay.”</p>
<p>“Still…I should have served you some food, or at least some tea.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll be back soon, anyway.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll treat you nicely then.” She smiled like an unworried child. “With a nice fireplace as well.”</p>
<p>Hizette felt a flutter of relief.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lacias searched about for Lila like he did every day.</p>
<p>It was nothing like a foreign scene. Lacias searched for Lila like a duckling chasing after its mother. But something seemed different today. It didn’t look like he was peacefully looking for Lila. Lacias seemed like he was in a rush, which was unlike himself.</p>
<p>Even Lugar could tell.</p>
<p><em>Why is he in such a rush?</em> Lugar, unable to wait, called him loudly. Lacias’s aggressive blue eyes landed on him, and Lugar felt himself grow flustered. He quickly suppressed it.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” he asked. “It’s breakfast soon.”</p>
<p>“To Lila.”</p>
<p><em>What? That’s it? </em>Lugar shook his head. How pathetic it was, that the first thing Lacias did after opening his eyes was look for Lila.</p>
<p>Lugar was about to walk past him but reached out and grabbed him.</p>
<p>“By the way, My Lord,” he said, “can I ask you something?”</p>
<p>“Speak quickly. I’m busy.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Have you seen Roxana anywhere?”</p>
<p>“How should I know where she is? I’m busy. Don’t ask me about stuff like that.”</p>
<p>They were two peas in a pod. Lacias heading for Lila’s room the second he woke up wasn’t particularly special. The second he opened his eyes, he’d felt something. Something ominous. For the first time, he’d slept deeply without Lila in bed with him. But he’d woken up feeling dirty instead of refreshed and only Lila could make him feel this way.</p>
<p>“Where’s Lila?” he asked the first person he came across.</p>
<p>“I—I haven’t seen her today!” he replied. “I’m sorry!”</p>
<p>Lacias continued scouring the castle.</p>
<p><em>I need a moment to calm down.</em></p>
<p>He stopped on the stairs. <em>What does Lila do in the morning?</em></p>
<p>Usually, she headed down to the office the moment she got out of bed. Or she had teatime with Hir Wipere. The teatime Lacias was never invited to.</p>
<p>He had to admit, he found it a bit irking. But that wasn’t the priority.</p>
<p>Every servant and maid he ran into said they hadn’t seen Lila. Which meant one of two things: either she hadn’t gone anywhere or she’d moved only a short distance.</p>
<p>“Then she won’t be at teatime,” he muttered to himself. “Probably in the office or in the bedroom.”</p>
<p>But Lila wouldn’t be in that bedroom resting even at this time. She was basically a workaholic. With lifted spirits, he headed for Lila’s office.</p>
