            <p><strong>Chapter 110 – Wedding Plans</strong></p>
<p>“Therefore, we are planning to hold a party under Senior’s name as soon as possible. The closer we get your mines back the better.”</p>
<p>Lacias nodded casually, he did not care less about the details, what mattered to him was that Lila was going to be present at the party. “Yes yes, anyways, I’m going too.”</p>
<p>Lila was confused. “Going where?”</p>
<p>Lacias pushed his hand closer to hers. “To the party of course. Only I can be your partner. I will not tolerate anybody else.”</p>
<p>“Sure, go ahead.” She acted casually about it, but inside she felt glad about not having to ask him, even though she expected him to come without her request.</p>
<p>Lacias smiled widely at Lila’s approval and asked brightly, “By the way, how is our wedding preparation going?”</p>
<p>“Oh … about the wedding ….” She had been so preoccupied with Edith that she forgot about planning the wedding altogether. “Uhm … Any updates on your side?”</p>
<p>“We decided on a date.” He seemed okay about her negligence.</p>
<p>“When is it?”</p>
<p>He looked her directly in the eyes. “Three weeks.”</p>
<p>“That’s very soon.” Lila could not believe how quickly time had passed, especially since the wedding was not her priority.</p>
<p>Lacias looked away, this time he tried to make his emotions so obvious. “Now I’m sad. How could you be so indifferent about our own wedding? You’re the only bride in this world who doesn’t know the date of her wedding. Meanwhile, I think about our wedding every single day.”</p>
<p>Unlike his words, Lacias seemed quite glad. Lila, who was trying to figure out what he was thinking, stopped and stroked his hair instead. <em>Dramatic effect.</em></p>
<p>Lacias turned silent at her touch. He looked down with only his blushing ears showing.</p>
<p>“I’m also … looking forward to it,” said Lila apologetically.</p>
<p>“Are you really?” He looked up at her like a whining puppy, despite him being almost double her height.</p>
<p>“Yes. Somewhat.” It wasn’t a lie. She expected to gather more accurate information with the help of the guests at the wedding. Also, if she gained authority as the wife of the duke, wouldn’t she have more freedom? Moreover, she couldn’t wait to help Hir’s dream come true.</p>
<p>“I told them to hasten the pace, but they still settled on three weeks. I wish it were tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“I think three weeks later is absolutely perfect timing-wise.” Lila’s line of thought was far from wishing the wedding to be tomorrow.</p>
<p>When Lila replied sternly, Lacias laughed out loud and shook his body. “I know, I was jesting. But I do wish it could have been tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“How about we leave that as a wish.”</p>
<p>“Where should we go for our honeymoon?” He asked, changing the subject quickly.</p>
<p><em>… Why is he suddenly talking about our honeymoon? </em>Lila stared at Lacias with bewilderment apparent in her eyes. <em>Wait? Was he being serious? An entire honeymoon for a year-long contract marriage? I’m too busy to go on a vacation.</em></p>
<p>Lacias read her expression and tried to fix the situation. “Well, I would like to go on a honeymoon with you in the future … someday.”</p>
<p>“In the future … ?” <em>By future, did he mean the time in which their contract comes to an end? </em>Lila’s heart softened, his persuasion was getting to her. <em>Maybe I’d be able to move on without regrets if I could build great memories with Lacias and Hir</em>. <em>But that would still be very selfish.</em></p>
<p>Oblivious to what was going on in her head, Lacias kept going. “Do you like the cold or the warmth? Do you like the ocean? Somewhere crowded? What do you prefer?”</p>
<p>Lila hastily ended the conversation. “We’ll think about that later.”</p>
<p>“Sure, I’m happy wherever, as long as I’m with you.” Lacias blushed as he pictured the future. A hint of hyped emotions could be heard from his voice. “Ah, Lila, did you know?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The bride and the groom promise to live happily ever after in front of all the guests.”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess so.” A wedding scene flashed through Lila’s mind. She never attended a wedding before, except in the form of dramas and movies.</p>
<p>Lacias inched closer to her. “Do you know how to make vows?”</p>
<p>“No … Not really?” Nothing particular came to mind. <em>We have to look pretty and link arms. What else?</em></p>
<p>Noticing Lila’s puzzled expression, Lacias smirked mischievously and replied. “The bride and the groom need to kiss.”</p>
<p>Lila tilted her head as she replied. “Probably better to skip it.”</p>
<p>Lacias shook his head adamantly. “Oh, definitely not. How could we skip the part in which we kiss to tie the knot? It’s the most vital part of the wedding.”</p>
<p>“You’re …  kidding, right?”</p>
<p>He laughed to himself calmly. “Well, I guess we’ll see about that.”</p>
