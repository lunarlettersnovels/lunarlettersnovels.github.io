            <p><strong>Chapter 205</strong></p>
<p>Lila was perplexed. “How come we still can’t find any of them…?” she asked. “Could it be that Lugar… made them invisible? Or is it just that we are bad at this game?”</p>
<p>“But you said Lugar is someone who likes to play fair.” Reminded Hir.</p>
<p>“True. Let’s keep searching then.”</p>
<p>Lila, who lost her composure, tried to remain calm in front of Hir. If not for him, she would have already flopped down on the ground.</p>
<p><em>I was so full of confidence when I told Hir not to use his ring and that I would use mine to find the hiding rings but—</em></p>
<p>She felt embarrassed to admit to him that her ring was clearly not winning them the game but Lila had no choice.</p>
<p>“Hir. At this rate, we will lose.”</p>
<p>“What?” Hir looked a little surprised, but he quickly tried to hide it with a more serious tone. “That, that doesn’t matter! What’s important is that I can play with my mother.”</p>
<p>“Hir… You’re so sweet.” Lila held him up and rubbed her cheek against his face. His soft and warm cheek melted her heart.</p>
<p><em>He’s much heavier than before.</em></p>
<p>Hir was growing by leaps and bounds, and Lila knew that soon she wouldn’t be able to carry him at all. One thing that didn’t change though was his smile. It stayed as bright and vibrant as ever.</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t it be better if we were to win?” she asked her after placing him back down.</p>
<p>“Of course….”</p>
<p>“Since I failed, why don’t you take the lead this time?”</p>
<p>“Me…? I’m not sure if I can….” Hir seemed to lack confidence in himself. Every time Hir underestimated his potential, Lila encouraged him to be less hesitant about showing his talent.</p>
<p>“Of course. I’m sure you can do it. And I’ll be with you anyway, so what are you worried about?”</p>
<p>“You’re coming with me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. We’ll do this together.”</p>
<p>Hir smiled at the word ‘together’. It brought reassurance to his natural nervousness.</p>
<p>Lila could have encouraged him by saying. ‘it’s okay if you can’t find the rings’, But she wanted him to feel one hundred percent certain about using his ring.</p>
<p>“you can do it!” She cheered with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Lila knew he needed a confidence boost more than anything at that moment, she didn’t want him worrying about the possibility of losing.</p>
<p><em>When you believe in yourself, you get the power to turn that belief into reality. Worrying about things that haven’t even happened yet will only increase your anxiety.</em></p>
<p>“Hir, why don’t you try summoning your ring?”</p>
<p>“Okay!” Summoning a ring was a piece of cake for Hir who had the innate talent for rings.</p>
<p>Within moments his ring appeared before them floating in mid-air. Lila nodded her head and placed a supportive hand on Hir’s shoulder. “Okay, now, close your eyes and try to control your ring.”</p>
<p>“Control…?” The idea of maneuvering a ring was new to him.</p>
<p>“Yes. Try moving it left and right, back and forth.”</p>
<p>“Ah! I think I know what you mean!” Hir clenched his cute little fist and closed his eyes. He was trying his hardest to focus on what she said.</p>
<p>Lila couldn’t hide her excitement as she watched her son proudly.</p>
<p>“Mmm. Am I doing right?” he asked after not hearing anything from her.</p>
<p>“Try sending your ring far away from where you are.”</p>
<p>“Far away…? How far did it go? Is it moving the right way?” Hir had his eyes closed, so he seemed a little anxious since he couldn’t physically see where the ring was going.</p>
<p>“Yes, you’re doing really well.” Lila tried her hardest to uplift Hir’s spirit. Although she was a little tired, she showed no sign of fatigue. “I think the ring has gone far enough now. Hir, can you feel the energy of someone else’s ring?”</p>
<p>“It’s difficult….”</p>
<p>“It won’t be.” Reassured Lila. “It’s just that Lugar’s rings are hidden in places difficult to find.”</p>
<p>Lila pulled out her gun from her pocket and aimed it in the direction of Hir’s ring. “I’ll send my ring near yours. Try to sense it.”</p>
<p>“Wi- will I be able to do it?” he asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>Lila patted Hir on the shoulder. “Take your time,” she said in her calmest tone. “There’s no need to hurry. If you fail once, you can try again. There aren’t many people who get it right from the start. Of course, it’s great if you can make it on your first try, but even if you can’t, it’s totally okay.”</p>
<p>This made Hir clench his fists even tighter. “You’re right, mom! I’ll try my best!”</p>
<p>“Yes, you can do it, Hir.” When Lila grabbed her gun and unleashed her ring, she felt something floating up to her barrel.</p>
<p><em>It’s been a while.</em></p>
<p>When the ring reached the muzzle tip, she pulled the trigger confidently.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh-!</em></p>
<p>The ring whizzed by Hir’s ear leaving a slight trail behind it. It was perfectly aimed at Hir’s still ring. As the ring came in close contact with Hir’s he instinctively steered his ring out of the way leaving an empty target.</p>
<p>“Hir!” Lila exclaimed. “That was amazing!”</p>
