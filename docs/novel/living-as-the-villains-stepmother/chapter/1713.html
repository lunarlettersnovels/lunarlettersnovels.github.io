<p>“Do you remember that man?”</p>
<p>“Um?” He turned her head towards the direction she was looking at. Lacias saw an old and fat man and had to think for a moment before remembering who it was. “He annoys me. Isn’t that Baron Blake from the Hilns’ party?”</p>
<p>“Yes, have you met him before?” Lila looked up at him.</p>
<p>“Him? Never.” He said, in a condescending tone.</p>
<p>Lila wanted to ask Lacias what Blake’s connection was to the Hilns if he knew him, but she guessed as much.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking me that? Who is he to you?” Lacias asked her in a strange voice, and she realized where his thought process was going again.</p>
<p>“Don’t be crude. You’re saying nonsense.”</p>
<p>“You can’t say such things to me when you know that he’s the only man you look at so persistently.”</p>
<p>“…” Lila couldn’t disagree with that as it was suspicious, however, she wasn’t staring at him with the intention that he thought she was.</p>
<p>But it was too late, Lacias wouldn’t let the topic go. “I’m curious why you stare at him like that, you never stare at me the same way.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to be, as you’re completely off the mark.”</p>
<p>“That helps, but I would still feel more comfortable if you didn’t look at him that way.”</p>
<p>Lacias covered Lila’s eyes with his large palm so she couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>“I’m a jealous man.”</p>
<p>Lila lowered his hand with a laugh. “Fine, I’ll explain later. Are we good now?”</p>
<p>Lacias calmed down like a well-trained hunting dog as she consoled him.</p>
<p>“But before that..”</p>
<p>“What?” Lacias asked.</p>
<p>“We need to follow Baron Blake first.” Lila pointed at the man who was growing farther and farther away from them in each passing second. “He’s getting out of our sight. I’ll explain later why I’m following him, okay?” She told Lacias after seeing his brows rise in confusion.</p>
<p>While Lacias was not thrilled about having to wait until later, he nodded just the same. “I guess you have your reasons, right?”</p>
<p>Lila nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s settled then.” Lacias mumbled as he looked down defeatedly. Lila cupped his cheek and caressed it lightly with her thumb for a second before pulling it away. Lacias peered up to stare directly into her eyes. “You know, never in my life have I experienced being used like this, but if it’s you..” His words stopped, and Lila was patiently waiting for him to go on but Lacias only threw her a smile.</p>
<p>He beckoned her to link her arm with his. Lila immediately followed suit. “Then let’s go follow him, shall we?” Lacias said, seemingly enjoying himself.</p>
<p>“Please be quiet. I don’t want us to be seen.” Lila warned.</p>
<p>“All right.” Lacias responded. His eyes trailed Doug Blake waddling up the street. Lacias scoffed in annoyance at the latter’s presence, who didn’t even know that he was being followed. While he lets his mother disturb his precious time with Lila from time to time, someone like Doug Blake was just unforgivable.</p>
<p>“He’s going that way.” Lila said as she turned to look at Lacias.</p>
<p>“Are you going to follow him inside? That’s quite a big risk.” He said evenly. His tone was calm as ever.</p>
<p>“It is.” Now that she thought about it, it really was risky since she was not familiar with the building Baron just entered in, and there was a high chance of being seen should she wander too far. But even with these thoughts in mind, it still didn’t stop her from wanting to know more.</p>
<p>She had no idea what would happen next, so she decided to do a quick search around the building’s perimeters to see if there’s anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Lila dismissed the thought of entering the building altogether. She pointed at the back of the building and addressed Lacias. “We should split up. I’ll search here while you go to the back. Doing so would save us some time.”</p>
<p>It was a sensible decision, but Lacias sternly shook his head. “No.” Leaving Lila alone in an unfamiliar place was out of the question.</p>
<p>“We will search the premises together.” Lacias said firmly. “What if the Baron noticed he was being followed, and assigned people around to guard the place?”</p>
<p>He had a point. “You’re right.” Lila said.</p>
<p>If Lacias was somehow cornered by the Baron’s people, he could easily fend for himself since he was strong enough to fight them off. Lila, however, would not stand a chance against several men. Lila agreed that they should move together. She carefully studied the building in front of them, noticing how outdated it looked.</p>
<p>“It’s an old building that seems out of place.” She muttered.</p>
<p>“I agree. It appears like the Baron was keenly hiding his whereabouts since he did not even bother using a carriage.”</p>
