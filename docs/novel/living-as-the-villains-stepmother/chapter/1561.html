            <p><strong>Chapter 231</strong></p>
<p>Was she wrong?</p>
<p>“‘Mother, please don’t abandon me.’ That’s what he keeps saying. You may have gotten thin, but so has he, and he gets thinner by the day. He won’t eat.”</p>
<p>Was it really right for her to leave Hir?</p>
<p>She thought she’d done horrible things as a stepmother. Before she came into this body, when she was reading the book, she’d thought about how horrible Mrs. Marshmell was. Lila was also a victim of domestic abuse. She knew so well that she thought it was the right choice to leave Hir.</p>
<p><em>He’s…having nightmares again because of me? And he’s not eating?</em></p>
<p>That meant that the reason for Lila to leave was long gone. Confusion settled over her. Lacias quietly stared into her violet eyes and brushed her hand.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>His true intention of telling her not to be confused was touching. Even though his eyes were aggressive, his hands were warm.</p>
<p>“Come back to me.”</p>
<p>He took out a white gun from his pocket. It was Lila’s.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Someone who wouldn’t give anyone else a chance was giving her a saving grace. She glanced at Lacias’s soft hand and the gun that was waiting for its owner.</p>
<p>“What are you worrying about? Lila, you want it.”</p>
<p><em>I…want it?</em></p>
<p>“You look like you’re dying to come back. Do you need a hand?”</p>
<p>His blues eyes speared her. Lila couldn’t avoid his gaze. She felt like she was being read like a book.</p>
<p><em>I want to, but…</em></p>
<p>Was it because she was sorry? She couldn’t decide what the right decision was. It would be great if someone would just tell her.</p>
<p>“Ha, you’re just.”</p>
<p>Lacias brushed his hair back. She expected to see a frown on his face, but what she found was the complete opposite.</p>
<p><em>Why do you look so uneasy?</em></p>
<p>He looked like he was worried Lila wouldn’t come back. He was basically asking her to grab his leash again. Lila could see all of that.</p>
<p>“You really just…” The tremor in his voice really didn’t fit him. But it was enough to shake Lila’s heart. “Make me crazy. You make me crazy when you’re not in my sights…and when you are. I just don’t know what to do. Especially now.”</p>
<p>Lacias took a few steps toward her.</p>
<p>“Please come back.” He took her hand carefully, like he could break it if he held it too tightly. He turned her palm up and placed her gun in it.</p>
<p>“I beg you. I can’t live without you. It came to that in the end.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t his cheesy self. Lacias was <em>begging</em>. He spoke without emotion, but there was a plea in his words that she couldn’t ignore.</p>
<p>“Lacias… Lacias, look at me.”</p>
<p>He stared down, all confidence lost. Lila brought a hand to cup his cheek, gently caressing it.</p>
<p>“What does this mean?” Lacias still looked worried. Because of her.</p>
<p>She grabbed her gun without a word. “I’m sorry.” His muscle trembled in that moment. She could feel it in her hand.</p>
<p>“I’m saying sorry for leaving you without saying anything,” she added, before he collapsed in agony.</p>
<p>“Then…”</p>
<p>“As asking for forgiveness, I promise you. I make promises like this.”</p>
<p>Lila locked her pinky with Lacias’. “I promise never to leave you again.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Crybaby.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t make fun of me for that.”</p>
<p>“But you <em>are</em> a crybaby.” She let out a laugh, unable to handle how cute he looked when he pouted. She just wanted to squish that cute face and kiss it.</p>
<p>“I said no. I told you to stop. I’m already embarrassed enough.”</p>
<p>“You want me to stop?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Lacias looked like he might refute, but he kept looking away as though he was really embarrassed.</p>
<p>They talked for a long time on the sofa.</p>
<p>“So…what did you say you felt when you saw my message?”</p>
<p>“Ah, honestly?” He frowned, like he didn’t want to think about it again. “I suffocated.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“And…can I say it honestly?”</p>
<p>Lila nodded, smiling like it was funny. Lacias pondered for a moment.</p>
<p>“When I see you again.”</p>
<p>“Mmhm. When you see me?”</p>
<p>Lacias’s lips turned upward, his gaze thickening like he was thinking of something naughty. “I was going to lock you up in the room and tie you up—”</p>
<p>“Stop—no! I don’t want to hear it anymore!”</p>
<p>Lila blushed and tried to shut Lacias’ mouth so not a sound would come out, but her efforts were to no avail. “I was going to make it so that you wouldn’t talk to anyone else…and then I wouldn’t let you out of sight and then every night—“</p>
<p>“Please stop! Stop there!”</p>
<p>He laughed. “You want me to stop here?”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>“Then you’re going to stop making fun of me?”</p>
<p>“Mhm, promise!” Lila quickly answered. “I promise you.”</p>
<p>“Then we have a peace treaty.”</p>
<p>Lacias smiled. “By the way, this really was what I thought. It was only the tip of the iceberg.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t ask.”</p>
<p>“I told you because I thought you might be wondering.”</p>
<p>“How can you bully someone for making fun of you that little?”</p>
<p>Lila crossed her arms and glared at Lacias. He continued smiling, as though even that was too lovely.</p>
<p>“Can I touch once?”</p>
<p>“T-touch what?” Lila appeared to be defensive of his misunderstood advances.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to pet your head.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” Her cheeks flared up again. She felt embarrassed for looking at him like he was a pervert.</p>
<p>“Come here. You promised you wouldn’t get far away from me.”</p>
<p>“Mm…”</p>
<p>Lila went to the corner of the sofa, still thinking about what he’d said earlier, but she was too embarrassed to move. Lacias seemed unhappy about that, so he folded his legs and went to sit next to her.</p>
<p>“H-how close are you getting?”</p>
<p>“You should’ve come when I gave you the chance.”</p>
<p>Lacias put himself on top of her. He leaned his hand toward Lila’s side and climbed on top of her, trapping her like she was prey.</p>
<p>Lila was flustered at his sudden action.</p>
<p>“What…what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean…”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Lacias’s blue eyes were busy scanning Lila’s face. She flinched.</p>
<p><em>What am I doing? Feel so stupid.</em></p>
<p>She hated that her body wouldn’t control itself. Lila wanted to slap her own face to wake herself up, but she was completely frozen.</p>
<p>“You look…scared that I’m going to have you.”</p>
<p>Lacias was right. Her body was riddled with nervousness, but a part of her also didn’t mind. Her thoughts seemed to pound in her mind like they might burst.</p>
<p>Lila looked away from him and turned her head.</p>
<p>“You’re…you’re too close.”</p>
<p>So close his breath might brush her. Lila’s voice trembled.</p>
<p>“You know I did this on purpose. Adorable.”</p>
<p>Lacias tickled Lila’s cheek. She really didn’t know why her body kept flinching. Lacias spoke, watching her close her eyes and tremble.</p>
<p>“Lila, I don’t know if you’ll remember what I asked before….”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Lacias scoffed like he was reminiscing. “You rejected me pretty brutally.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Can you do it this time?”</p>
<p>Was it just her, or had the atmosphere suddenly turned serious? Lila nodded in spite of herself. Lacias carefully stared at her. And then his lips parted.</p>
<p>“You agreed.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but there’s no taking it back.”</p>
<p>They were so close their breaths touched. Lacias’s was getting rougher.</p>
<p>“Kiss me, Lila,” he rather commanded. And before she could give her permission, she felt his warmth on her lips.</p>
