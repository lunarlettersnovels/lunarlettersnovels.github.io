            <p><strong>Chapter 131 – I’m Right Here</strong></p>
<p>“Does that mean you’ve found traces of the Shadow?” Lila finally found the chance to discuss her findings.</p>
<p>“Yes. So perhaps the boy of your mention could’ve been one of their kind as well. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to elude our pursuit,” said Roxana as she gave her reports on the findings from the search. More so, she had also told Lila that although the remains of the Hole were found while a search was carried out based on the little information they’ve got from Lila, the executant was still at large.</p>
<p>Lila rubbed her chin and nodded her head. “Clearly ….I think you have a point.”</p>
<p>However, even if the boy was a Shadow who could handle a Hole, why would Dawson Hiln want to ruin Senior’s party, using the boy’s power?</p>
<p>Lila buried herself in such thoughts as she mused over the situation in depth.</p>
<p><em>Let’s take things one at a time. What would I do if I were Dawson?</em></p>
<p>First things first, he tried to ruin the party using The Hole. It made sense as the use of a Hole would have been most ideal to turn the party upside down without leaving a trace.</p>
<p>Secondly, he made an appearance with haste as soon as he heard the news of Lacias’s presence at the party. Could that insinuate that he had found Lacias’s presence as a threat when he planned to ruin the party using The Hole?</p>
<p><em>It all makes sense, but….</em></p>
<p>She remembered how confident Dawson sounded when he had told her that the party would never be a success, even though he had full awareness of Lacias’s presence during their conversation.</p>
<p><em>He seemed so certain about it when he said that. Was it because he had full confidence in what the boy was capable of?</em></p>
<p>That didn’t seem right as every plan must have two strings in one bow in case it falls through. However, he was surprisingly brimming with confidence.</p>
<p><em>Then what if … he didn’t mind at all for everyone finding out about him being the mastermind of the plan after all.</em></p>
<p>Lila’s eyes widened as it suddenly dawned on her that Dawson was whispering something to Count Hiln from afar before she confronted him. It appeared to her as if Dawson was trying to persuade Count Hiln into something.</p>
<p>What if he’d already come clean on his plan to his father and had also drawn up a plan to avoid being criticized by people if his identity were to be revealed.</p>
<p>“I think we better head back to the party hall.”</p>
<p>“I agree with you,” said Lacias after coming to the same conclusion as Lila’s as if he had read her mind like an open book.</p>
<p>They looked at each other and nodded in sync.</p>
<p>“Lila”!</p>
<p>After the synchronizing moment, Edith’s bright voice was heard.</p>
<p>“When did you get all the way here? I’ve been looking for you all over, you know!” Exclaimed Edith with her lips pouting as she was upset with Lila for not keeping her promise. However, Edith’s countenance was softened again in no time and she even twisted her body around in a bashful way as Lila showered her with kindness just like she would to Hir.</p>
<p>“Should we all get back to the party hall then?” Asked Lila again, as she curled her lips sneakily at the thought of beating Dawson at his own game.</p>
<p>Lila’s gently downturned eyes were now resembling the eyes of an eagle. She then abruptly turned her head around toward the party hall, which was a little distance away from the Maze garden.</p>
<p>She had a sudden feeling of distraught when she re-entered the hall, the thought of being too late crossed her mind which made a chill run down her spine.</p>
<p><em>What’s this horrible feeling?</em></p>
<p>Bewildered by the unfamiliar sensation, she took a glance around her surroundings and found that everyone except for Edith had serious looks on their face with their mouths closed into a tight line as they stared deeper into the party hall.</p>
<p>Those who could handle a Ring had well-developed extrasensory perceptions in addition to their acute five senses. Which meant that they could instinctively detect abnormal phenomenons with their sensory organs without having to look with their eyes or listen with their ears.</p>
<p>“… Damn it.” Lacias, who was the first to notice the abnormality, muttered a curse word under his breath as he clicked his tongue. All of the sudden, A loud explosion was heard from the inner-party-hall.</p>
<p><em>How did it happen so quickly?! </em>Lila was so agitated that she didn’t realize her legs moved on their own towards the root of the explosion.</p>
<p>It had not been long since the suspicious boy was lost from her sight. So Lila was baffled at how he could act so quickly.</p>
<p>“Lila, it’s dangerous!”, said Lucias as he quickly grabbed onto Lila who’d darted out frantically before him. It was a silly move for her to rush toward the scene without knowing what was taking place in the party hall.</p>
<p>“But, all the people I’ve invited are still in….” She couldn’t bear to finish her sentence at the thought of everyone likely to have been trapped in the hall. Not to mention that she’s the one who invited every single one of them.</p>
<p>She anxiously shifted her eyes initially from Lacias to the party hall, then to the knights of the Wipere, and back to Lacias.</p>
<p>“Ah…” Lila immediately felt at peace when her eyes met Lacias’s, it was like staring into a vast, calm ocean.</p>
<p>“Sh … It’s all going to be alright,” he said, quietly soothing her.</p>
<p>She felt the storm in her heart dying down slowly as he calmed her down with just a pat on her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m right here with you.”</p>
<p>For just a moment, she forgot about all her problems and felt at ease, his calming methods were surprisingly very effective.</p>
