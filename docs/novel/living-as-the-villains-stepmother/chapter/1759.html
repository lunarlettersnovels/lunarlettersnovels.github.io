            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 19 – This Is Mine (2)</strong></p>
<p>“All, all men are like that. How do you not understand things like this?” Farsha defended.</p>
<p>“Hmm, so you’re saying that every single man has this behavior?”</p>
<p>Fasha’s anger seemed to have no limits “This is what I get for accepting such a low-born into the family! Talking back to me like this. Okay! Yes for men it’s an instinct and it’s in their nature to do such things! You’re the one at fault for not knowing such basic things.”</p>
<p>“Instinct and nature. I see.”</p>
<p>Fasha immediately noticed that Lila actually acknowledged her explanation. Unlike from the beginning when she would usually strike back at her. It took time but it seems she was finally beginning to convince her, Fasha didn’t want to ruin the opportunity so she proceeded without thinking any further.</p>
<p>“Finally the uneducated low-born seems to understand after explaining it so many times.” Little did Fasha know that Lila’s attacks had just begun.</p>
<p>“So what you’re saying is that your son was a beast that was faithful to his instincts without knowing any shame, right?”</p>
<p>“Wha-what! How dare you!? Are you comparing my son to an animal now!” Fasha couldn’t believe her own anger, she couldn’t believe that such a low-born would bring her to a state such as this, she placed her palm on her own neck from how much she was shouting. But Lila gave one last remark before she could calm herself.</p>
<p>“So, if all men are like that … Then that means your own husband is also a … Oh my goodness. How dirty.” Lila’s lips turned into a slight smirk, bringing Fasha’s reddened expression way past it’s limits.</p>
<p>“Do you dare curse the Count right now?!”</p>
<p>“To curse the Count …. No I wouldn’t do so. I was just repeating what you said just now. I just added a little interpretation.” Fasha lost control of her temper and stopped caring about her neck, or anything in the world.</p>
<p>“You are nothing but a low born! Who are you to insult the Count like this!”</p>
<p>“You said for men, that it’s their nature? You just said that.” Lila’s calm attitude just seemed to make it worse.</p>
<p>“Are you not going to shut up?!”</p>
<p>Fasha sighed loudly, she really could not continue like this so she eventually had to change the topic.</p>
<p>“And what the hell do you mean that you’ve got acquainted with another man?”</p>
<p>Lila remained quiet deciding that silence was the best response. But Fasha continued anyway.</p>
<p>“You are deliberately trying to raise my blood pressure to unhealthy levels. So you made up a lie of being acquainted. You are trying to bring me down as well.” Rather, Lila knew that if she told her she was planning to get remarried soon, Fasha would faint on the spot. But Lila let her live with her own conclusions. So she tried to change the subject once again.</p>
<p>“What was the reason for your visit?”</p>
<p>“Because for some reason you’re not being as stupid anymore.”</p>
<p>Lila sighed inwardly, she just wanted to finish baking the macaroons for Hir, but Fasha was making her life harder. Just thinking about Hir eating macaroons with a smile on his face brought joy to her heart. <em>He would look so cute eating macaroons. </em>Even after becoming a tyrant with a dreadful face it was specified in the novel that he accepted all sweet food graciously.<em> So how lovely would he look eating my sweet macaroons with his current adorable face! </em>Thought Lila dreamingly. But Fasha quickly pulled her back to reality with her irritating voice.</p>
<p>“The reason I came here is related to my son’s inheritance.”</p>
<p>“Ah, inheritance. That’s finally a good topic.”</p>
<p>Fasha chose to ignore this remark. “My son died, so you didn’t think you could continue living in a luxurious mansion like this, did you?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. I was not planning to live in this house any longer,” said Lila with a light smile forming on her face. She was planning to live in Lacias’ mansion with Hir. In a mansion that was no different than the palace. Better even if you had to choose. However, Hir was the priority not her own comfort.</p>
<p>Fasha finally gave a satisfied smile, it was her brightest expression yet. “Wow! Now we are finally talking in some sense. Empty your belongings from my mansion quickly. I don’t care about how you do it just do it now. I will leave you with a little money in consideration of the old ties, so be satisfied with that.”</p>
<p>Fasha got up expecting Lila to do the same and hurry about the house collecting her belongings. However, she did quite the contrary. She stayed sitting and actually crossed her legs to sit in a better position.</p>
<p>“I said I won’t live in this mansion, but I didn’t say that the mansion wasn’t mine.”</p>
<p>“I’m … Sorry?”</p>
<p>Lila’s light smile faded away into a cold lifeless expression “This mansion is mine. Ma’am.”</p>
