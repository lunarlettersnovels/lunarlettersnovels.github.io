            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 9 – Luring the Beast (1)</strong></p>
<p>Although the maid knew how fatal it was for a maid to have this rumor go around about her, she couldn’t disobey her master “Yes, madam. I’ll spread the rumor.”</p>
<p>“Good. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Jane looked puzzled as if she was trying to piece together why Lila would falsely accuse her personal maid of stealing her earrings. Noticing this, Lila reminded herself that the choice was right and had to be done. She knew that this would permanently stop the maid in her abusive tracks, because even if she had an explanation to why the claim was false it would not be accepted. There was no aristocrat willing to hire a maid who was caught up in any sort of related rumor, mine as well a rumor for stealing.</p>
<p>There’s no smoke without a fire. Or at least that’s what most people thought. Most don’t care much about the truth. They just aren’t ready to take a risk with someone, no matter if it is false or not. Especially since there were plenty of women with clear slates willing to work as a maid. Lila’s decision was as sharp as a sword, one stroke could bring someone down for good.</p>
<p>“Oh, and there’s more to be done.”</p>
<p>“Please go ahead. We are here for serving you Mrs. Marshmell.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to change Hir’s room.”</p>
<p>“Master Hir ’s room … again?”</p>
<p>Jane was bewildered, the corners of her lips began turning down. She thought Lila would order them to move the boy’s room to somewhere even more wretched than where he was staying now, the child’s lifespan would surely be numbered to days then. But the words that came out from Lila’s mouth were completely beyond Jane’s expectations.</p>
<p>“Yes. Give Hir the best room in this mansion.”</p>
<p>“What?! The best … Are you talking about a good room, madam?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Best room in the mansion. A room filled with sunshine and well-ventilated. A room where Hir can run freely and fulfill his dreams.”</p>
<p>“Oh, ye-yes right away madam.”</p>
<p>Jane couldn’t believe the order being given to her right now. Mrs Marshmell who began treating the boy with standards lower than that of an animal after her husband’s death and has been treating him so, ever since, was now asking her to give him the best room? After giving him a room which wasn’t even fit for storage. It really did not make sense to the confused maid.</p>
<p>After all she’d been working with Mrs Marshmell for a long time, so It was natural for her to feel anxious rather than relieved. As if she could read Jane’s mind, Lila firmly said. “If anyone bullies or neglects Hir in the future, let’s just say spreading rumors isn’t all I can do. Inform this to everyone who works in the mansion.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam. I’ll get the room ready right away!”</p>
<p>Jane’s mind swelled with anticipation from Lila’s words.</p>
<p><em>Did she just now come to her senses and realize how cruel she was?</em></p>
<p>Jane thought she might have returned back to being Madam Marshmell, the angel figure whom everyone trusted and looked up to for being so pleasant. Was it possible that she had gotten rid of whatever began troubling her after the Viscount’s death? This could have been the case.</p>
<p>Lila couldn’t hold her laugh at Jane’s high pitched voice. To Jane this sounded like the chime of a melodic bell, she was truely relieved that Lila had come to her senses. As Jane was one of the few people in the Marshmell household that really cared about Hir.</p>
<p>“Hir is sleeping in my room at the moment, so you can just tidy and change his room in the evening.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Leave it to me, madam!”</p>
<p>Just the image of her giving Hir a better life was making Jane’s face light up, she couldn’t wait so she went to work straight away. But Lila stopped her with a soft tone and a final request.  “And lastly, would you please prepare a carriage?”</p>
<p>This was Lila’s main purpose for visiting the maid’s home. She needed a carriage for getting him to meet Duke Lacias Weifel, Hir’s original godfather. The torture that Mrs Marshmell had made Hir endure was taking a toll on him psychologically not to mention physically. Staying in the Marshmell household would surely not be healthy for his mental state.</p>
<p><em>If only I took Mrs Marshmell’s place before the abuse started, I would have been able to make his life a lot happier. </em>Thought Lila feeling a sting of sadness in her heart. Knowing that it was already too late for Hir to see Lila differently. This spread sorrow throughout her mind, but she knew that it had to be done. She knew that she had to get him to live with Lacias as soon as possible. She knew that she had to be away from him in order to preserve his health.</p>
<p><em>It’s all for the greater good.</em></p>
<p>“Carriage? Are you planning to go out? Tell me your destination and I will let the carriage driver know.”</p>
<p>“The carriage is to be headed to the Weifel family estate. I’m going to the mansion of the Duke of Lacias.”</p>
