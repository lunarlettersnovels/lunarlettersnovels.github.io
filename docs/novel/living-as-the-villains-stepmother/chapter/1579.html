            <p><strong>Chapter 213</strong></p>
<p>Yet something stopped him from passing on the information. He’s been doing it for years, but a small portion of his mind was stopping him.</p>
<p>Hizette felt a headache brewing up, it was the first time he had to question his loyalty. He lived his entire life believing in himself, but right now everything seemed to be being shaken from the root.</p>
<p>“I… So….”</p>
<p>Lila picked up on his hesitation and felt a trace of regret. “I’m sorry to burden you. I do apologize.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“But do keep this just between us. You cannot report this to anyone. You can do that for me, right?” She wasn’t too worried about his confusion, her hunch of him keeping a secret was taking over her mind. “I’ll trust that you can least do that much.”</p>
<p>With that said, Lila turned her back to the knight and started walking back to the mansion. She tried her best to mask the faint feelings of regret and seem confident about her decision.</p>
<p>Just as she took a few steps forward she heard an indistinct callout.</p>
<p>“…Lila.” Hizette bit his lip out of disbelief, but he eventually gave in “How can I help you?”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The plan wasn’t grand. It didn’t need to be. And to others, it would seem</p>
<p>Only one person noticed the difference.</p>
<p>“Lila, is there something going on nowadays?” asked Lacias with his brightest face?</p>
<p>“Something going on? Why would there be?”</p>
<p>Lacias was carefully massaging her shoulders before going to bed, his uneasy smile was giving away his worry.</p>
<p>“No nothing like that but.”</p>
<p>“Mm, hmm….”</p>
<p>He tried focusing more on massaging her shoulders as he remembered how she kept trying to stretch them during dinner. As he felt a hard spot at the tip of his fingers and massaged it, Lila let a moan slip out of her mouth.</p>
<p>“Do you feel better?”</p>
<p>Lila quickly covered her mouth out of embarrassment. “It hurts… but it does feel better.”</p>
<p>“We have to loosen you up so it won’t hurt tomorrow. You looked uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>Lila smiled. “How did you know?” She felt that Lacias was always watching out for her. He will never know that she was trying to hold back from smiling as brightly as she could.</p>
<p>“You’re not worried about anything right?” His worry was more noticeable now.</p>
<p>Lila looked at Lacias with a weird expression. “No I’m fine, why do you keep asking?”</p>
<p>“Just because,” he answered with no further explanation.</p>
<p>Although the rest of the week continued with nothing suspicious occurring, Lacias couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was off.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“I don’t recommend you this region. I believe you’ll get caught right away. You might want to go a bit further….”</p>
<p>Hizette was surprisingly giving genuine advice on helping her escape. Lila wasn’t expecting him to be on board so quickly.</p>
<p>“I can’t go to the countryside. I like port cities where I can receive news easily.”</p>
<p>“If more people are moving around, then more people will spot you and naturally you’ll get revealed.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like I don’t know that.”</p>
<p>Lila was deciding on a place to stay after leaving the Wipere’s territory. Because she didn’t know the country too well, Hizette’s advice was becoming very important. However, they were in conflict because Hizette wanted her to move to the country while she wanted to move to a port town. Her reasoning was simple.</p>
<p><em>If the place doesn’t get news quickly then I won’t be able to get news about Lacias and Hir quickly.</em></p>
<p>Lila preferred a port city where foreign items come in quickly, but HIzette’s claim was also correct, she could get spotted easily by someone who knew her.</p>
<p>If she wanted to hide, she had to move to an area with a low population. But considering this all, Lila’s benchmark was clear.</p>
<p>Hizette noticed that Lila wouldn’t back down, so he gave in a little.</p>
<p>“Then how about another country? Is there a reason you want to move to somewhere in the Nixon Kingdom only?”</p>
<p>Lila was dreading this question, she didn’t have a professional reason to explain it to him so she decided to speak the truth, “Just because… it snows.”</p>
<p>Hizette frowned like he didn’t understand. “It snows?”</p>
<p>“It’s just my personal preference.” She mumbled.</p>
<p>Lila decided not to elaborate on her choice. She didn’t want to share the promise of the future she shared with Lacias. And suitably, Hizette didn’t press on the topic.</p>
<p>“The Nixon Kingdom and a port city. I’ll look around for a place like that.”</p>
<p>“Ok, thanks.”</p>
<p>“How are you going to pick the date?” asked the knight.</p>
<p>“Date….”</p>
<p>Every plan had a time frame to go underway, she just had to share when it was taking place with Hizette. However, Lila just stood silently, she was barely able to form a proper sentence.</p>
<p>“…Sometime this month… The last d-day would be good.”</p>
<p>Hizette raised an eyebrow. “It’s already the middle of the month, isn’t that too early?”</p>
<p>“The earlier the better.”</p>
<p>It was too soon. He was going to explain how even if they hired someone from outside to assist them, they wouldn’t accept no matter what amount of money she gave them, but Hizette decided to leave it for another time.</p>
<p>“Ok then, I’ll finish the plan as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I believe in you.”</p>
<p>“…” His teeth clenched, his eyes widened, and came back. His body was too nervous from the surprise.</p>
<p>“Believe? In me?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that why I shared my plan with you? If I doubted you or didn’t believe in you then I would’ve found someone else.”</p>
<p>“It’s just… this is the first time I heard that line. It feels weird.”</p>
<p>The moment Lila’s gaze met the young knight’s, he immediately looked downwards. Although he was trying to hide it, his bright red ears were a dead give-away to his embarrassed face. Lila let out a muffled laugh before returning to her daily routine</p>
