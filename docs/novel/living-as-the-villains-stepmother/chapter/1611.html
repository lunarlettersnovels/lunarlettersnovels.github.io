            <p><strong>Chapter 181 –  An Untold Secret</strong></p>
<p>“It’s surprising that we actually knew each other.” Blake muttered to himself as he glanced at Lila trying to see her reaction.</p>
<p><em>We? </em>Lila asked herself.</p>
<p><em>What does he mean by ‘we’?</em></p>
<p>The word ‘we’ was definitely not a good word to describe the relationship between Blake and Lila.</p>
<p>“Hm…” Lila had no way of knowing what he meant. Her relationship with Enrique was already giving her a headache, and she did not want to add another burden. But she couldn’t throw off the sudden confusion of it.</p>
<p><em>There’s definitely something strange about his words.</em></p>
<p>Enrique had spoken more confidently about their relationship, while Blake spoke as if he didn’t know it himself and just found out they knew each other.</p>
<p><em>This is getting annoying.</em></p>
<p>Lila was offended by the fact that she was somehow entangled with people she didn’t even know. She found it unfair that she was the one responsible for cleaning the mess left by the former Madame Marshmell.</p>
<p><em>What the hell did this woman do?</em></p>
<p>She felt a touch of regret after discrediting her, even though Mrs. Marshmell was horrible to Hir.</p>
<p><em>Well, Lila was a woman who had nothing to do with the authorities, but still made it into a noble family. She must have worked hard behind the scenes.</em></p>
<p>“Hey, Baron,” said Lila, regaining his attention.</p>
<p>“Yes, do you remember?”</p>
<p>“No. I have no idea what you are talking about. And I don’t understand why you’re telling me this.”</p>
<p><em>In this case, it’s always best to pretend like I don’t know anything.</em></p>
<p>Lila thought it would be better to avoid answering him rather than to talk about a past that she didn’t even know about and let him take advantage of her weak point. That way, she would be able to gather more information from Blake’s reaction and find a way through the problem.</p>
<p>“Huh? Are you pretending like you don’t know or do you really not know?”</p>
<p>Lila’s unchanging face spoke sentences but she felt the need to add a little something. “You’re crossing the line, Baron.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m sorry. I’m not used to this kind of situation.”</p>
<p><em>Does he even know what he’s talking about?</em></p>
<p>As a member of the Blake Family, there was no way that Baron Blake had no experience or knowledge of how to behave in an aristocratic society.</p>
<p><em>Why is he showing such an impudent attitude in front of me?</em></p>
<p>If he’s attending her wedding day, he had to be aware that Lila had a much higher status than himself.</p>
<p>Doug Blake’s audacity and arrogance kept irritating Lila, making her feel increasingly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Oh no, what an innocent face you have. I guess the Duchess doesn’t know something I already know?”</p>
<p>“Watch your words.” Hissed Lila.</p>
<p>“If you listen to what I am going to tell you, you will know who the rude person is.”</p>
<p>Lila was lost for words. She could hardly believe what she had just heard.</p>
<p>“Don’t you really know who I am?” He continued.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember the first time we met? You acted like a stranger coming from a different world. You also seemed very uncomfortable with me and even did a little digging to find out who I am, right?”</p>
<p><em>I thought I hid it well, but it seems like he’s been on to me from the start… but wait, a stranger who came from a different world…</em>? To Lila that was certainly not something, Baron Blake would say out of the blue.</p>
<p>“Isn’t the title ‘Stranger’ more appropriate for me than Baron Blake?”</p>
<p>“Stranger?” Lila felt unnaturally bothered by the word, but it seemed to excite the baron on the other hand.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. A stranger.” Blake grinned. “This world is still unfamiliar to me, but I’ve gotten used to it a lot and I receive less suspicion than in the past. Everything was very difficult at first.”</p>
<p><em>Wait, what?</em></p>
<p>“It’s strange how the Duchess behaves as if she knows this world so well. Could it be that you used the evil feelings you had towards me to perform magic on me to drag me into this imaginary world created by you?”</p>
<p><em>How… How does Dough Blake know that?</em></p>
<p>What came out from Blake’s mouth were secrets that Lila had never spoken of since she came into the novel.</p>
<p><em>And what? Did I drag him into my imaginary world?</em></p>
<p>Her hands began to tremble as the tension between them grew. Lila tried to hide her nervousness by covering her face.</p>
<p>“Baron Blake, why do you keep saying things I don’t understand? You better stop if you don’t want to regret it.”</p>
<p>She knew not to be swayed by his confident tone, but his piercing laughter was getting to her head.</p>
<p><em>“</em>Hahaha…”</p>
<p>She closed her mouth tightly and gritted her teeth, trying to hold back the urge to spit out curses.</p>
<p>“I thought you knew already, didn’t you?” He asked with the widest smirk on his face. “Are you sure you still don’t know who I am?”</p>
<p>He approached, revealing his yellow teeth.</p>
