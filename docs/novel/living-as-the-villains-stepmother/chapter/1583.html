            <p><strong>Chapter 209</strong></p>
<p>A contract was formed between the two families stating that the Wiperes will never go against the royal authority. To make sure that the contract was followed, the royal family created this pillar to restrict their full potential.</p>
<p>The purpose of the tool was to curse the entire Wipere family bloodline if they were to take over the royal family’s authority. As long as the person attempting to take over had a ring inside the pillar.</p>
<p>But through the generations, no one from the Wipere family has gone against the contract so the curse is widely unknown.</p>
<p>This was all explained to Lila thoroughly and calmly, although she was shocked by the truth, she was happy that he was willing to explain it to her.</p>
<p><em>So Hir was not cursed in the original works because he’s not a Wipere by blood.</em></p>
<p>But the more shocking truth was yet to come out.</p>
<p>“However, my master didn’t put his ring inside the prisoner. There were many against it, but he shut them all up with overwhelming power.”</p>
<p>That didn’t add up in Lila’s mind because Lacias’s ring was floating in the tool before her.</p>
<p>Hizette explained her question before she could ask. “He personally put his ring into the prisoner to be legally married to you.”</p>
<p>“…What?” So, Lacias did it for her.</p>
<p><em>But why?</em></p>
<p>“The royal family wasn’t too pleased with my master for not continuing the tradition. But he soon gave in when a powerful weakness came along.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying… that weakness is me?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I’m only relaying a fact.”</p>
<p>He was right. This wasn’t something Hizette thought personally, it was the truth that everyone could see.</p>
<p>“There was a proof that you had past relations with the emperor so master made a deal to have his ring placed in the prisoner to legally have you as the Duchess of Wipere and erase your past with him.”</p>
<p>Lila felt proud to be on the side of all the characters she liked from the original novel, despite being a supposed villainess. However, once she was reminded of the fact that Lacias put himself on a leash because of her, the pride subsided. Lacias was being held back because of the relationship between the original Mrs. Marshmell and the emperor.</p>
<p>Lila’s hands shook in anger.</p>
<p><em>Why do we have to go through this because of that crazy woman! Why Lacias! Why us!</em></p>
<p><em>Then what Enrique said he’ll give me in ‘that’ in the past, did he mean the prisoner?</em></p>
<p>Hizette shut his lips after noticing Lila’s increasing irritation. He marked that as the end of his explanation.</p>
<p>A long silence followed but Lila was too deep in thought to notice. She was organizing the entire situation in her head, so Hizette decided to break it and calm her. “Since the ring seemed to react to you right now, it seems like my master’s ring hasn’t settled yet. We can still take it out. Of course, it would have to be soon, but the master seemed to have no such intention.”</p>
<p><em>Hasn’t settled yet</em></p>
<p>This line quickly made its way to Lila’s mind. It meant there was still a chance for him to take off his leash. She was going to leave anyway, so it wouldn’t hurt if she left a little earlier.</p>
<p><em>The fact that I can’t see Hir. And that I can’t be with Lacias. I haven’t had the chance to get ready.</em></p>
<p>The reality of the situation began to sink in and sadness overcame her, but Lila shoved it away, she couldn’t let such feelings tie her down. She had to disappear as soon as possible and not just for Hir, but Lacias as well.</p>
<p>“I have to leave this place… quickly,” mumbled Lila accidentally.</p>
<p>Hizette was immediately more alert and he raised his head to meet her gaze. “What did you just say?”</p>
<p>There was no way that Hizette, who was sensitive to sound, didn’t hear Lila. It wasn’t the best situation.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,” said Lila, quickly trying to hide the subject</p>
<p>Her heart sank after letting her thoughts slip through her mouth. The feelings that she thought were her strength quickly turned against her as she tried adjusting her shaken mentality.</p>
<p>“I definitely heard something,” said Hizette, not wanting to let her go so easily. “Didn’t you say? ‘I have to leave here quickly’?”</p>
<p>As usual, his listening was spot on which only made Lila even more nervous. She pretended to not hear his question and started walking away and fixing her hair instead.</p>
<p>“What is this rude gesture?” he asked suspiciously as he stepped in her way.</p>
<p>Lila’s eye sharpened, to step in the way of his mistress. He should be held accountable. She was about to mention this to him but his words came out first.</p>
<p>“I must protect you. That’s the duty I received from my master. But for you to say such a thing and brush it off as nothing. If I let you go like this, that means that I have failed to perform my duty.”</p>
<p>“Listen Hizette. I’m quite tired from the information overload.”</p>
<p>“I know it would be easier for us both to let it go. But my role as your protector takes priority, so please tell me what you meant.”</p>
<p>Lila knew he wasn’t going to back down easily from the moment he questioned her, but she couldn’t think of a proper solution, she felt like there was no way to escape the situation.</p>
<p>Lila always wondered why people gave up so quickly but today she sort of understood it. It was the feeling of defeat, the feeling that there was no way out except to give up.</p>
<p>“Even if I were to tell you, this is the wrong place for it.”</p>
