            <p><strong>Chapter 222</strong></p>
<p>There must have been a spy helping Lila within. Otherwise, her going missing didn’t make any sense. They’d searched everywhere in the Empire, but not a single soul had spotted her. She had no horse to go around, and there had been no traces of her walking. No boats to take to another kingdom. If not a spy, then a ghost must have helped her.</p>
<p>Lacias tapped the desk. Roxana flinched each time his finger rapped against the wood.</p>
<p>The fact that there was a spy within left the Grand Master responsible. It meant she hadn’t done a good job of taking care of the knights.</p>
<p>It was a young, clear voice that broke the cold silence.</p>
<p>“Wh-why did Mother l-leave?”</p>
<p>It was Hir. The child’s stammering had been improving, but it was getting bad again.</p>
<p>Lacias called him into the office, hoping to get some information on Lila’s whereabouts. He was the one she’d talked to the most. Hopefully, she had slipped up and said something.</p>
<p>“M-maybe Mother is a-angry with me again? D-did I do something wrong?” Hir was sobbing, his eyes already full of tears.</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault, young master. I don’t know why Lila’s left, but it’s not because of you. So, please, don’t cry.”</p>
<p>But Hir only cried louder.</p>
<p>“Y-young Master!” Roxana rushed to calm him down.</p>
<p>Lacias lip curled. “Snow.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Lugar asked. “I didn’t hear you.”</p>
<p>But Lucias hadn’t been speaking to him. He was mumbling to himself.</p>
<p>“Snow, snow.”</p>
<p>The fractures of his memory were returning. Why hadn’t he thought of it before? Lacias was annoyed at his incompetence. He rose to his feet.</p>
<p>“Nixon.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to the Nixon Kingdom. Right now.”</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>“Just what is going on?”</p>
<p>“You think I’d know. Also, use honorifics around people.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, Grand Master, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“You think that’s honorific?”</p>
<p>“Ouch.” Lugar winced as Senior hit his head. Not the first time it had happened. He touched his hair gingerly. “Don’t ruin my hairstyle in front of the kids.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to destroy your style in front of them?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I just can’t talk to you.” Lugar shook his head. Then he seemed to remember something all of a sudden. “Where is Hizette? I haven’t seen him since yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Don’t know,” Roxana replied. “I heard he’s on vacation.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Lugar scoffed. “He’s never used a vacation before, though. Hizette, that bastard. I can still picture it like yesterday—asking why vacations exist and who would even use them.”</p>
<p>“I know. He doesn’t seem well lately, either. Maybe something’s going on.” Roxana said.</p>
<p>“How nice of you to worry about him.”</p>
<p>“What?” She was shocked of his voice laced with anger.</p>
<p>“Huh? I didn’t say anything.” He shrugged.</p>
<p>Roxana gave his shoulder a light shove, but he stumbled several feet backward. His eyes widened.</p>
<p>“How are you so strong?” he asked in amazement. “As if everything that should be going to your brain went to your muscles.”</p>
<p>“I can hear you,” Roxana growled. He flashed her a pretty smile and shook his head. He wouldn’t be able to handle Roxana’s full power.</p>
<p>“Anyways, is it possible to get a vacation at this hour of emergency?”</p>
<p>“I heard Master allowed it. That should be enough.”</p>
<p>“He did? He allowed Hizette to go on vacation while using everyone else to search the entire Empire?”</p>
<p>“I also found it a little weird. Whatever. Also, you stopped using honorifics again.”</p>
<p>“I think we can keep a little informality between us.”</p>
<p>Lila going missing—more like leaving, though people didn’t know that—was being handled with more seriousness than the warring state. But to let Hizette, one of the most important people in the Order, go on vacation during all this? He couldn’t believe it. But Lacias had allowed it…</p>
<p>“So weird. Maybe he didn’t go on vacation? Maybe he was terminated instead?”</p>
<p>“Not impossible.”</p>
<p>Considering how Hizette had been lately, it wasn’t out of question. Hizette wasn’t himself these days. His mind seemed to be elsewhere most of the time.</p>
<p>“Maybe he was beaten up and locked up, so that he could be more like himself again?” Lugar said, shrinking even as he spoke.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>While Roxana and Lugar were contemplating Hizette’s whereabouts, Hizette was enjoying his vacation.</p>
<p>“Why did you bring so much?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It seemed like you needed a lot of things. This place is still empty, and it doesn’t suit you.”</p>
<p>“But don’t you think it looks warm with the fireplace? I like it.”</p>
<p><em>Is that why he brought so much? </em>Lila started unpacking what Hizette brought. <em>Winter coat, gloves, scarf—it’s all for winter?</em></p>
<p>Lila laughed inside. She hadn’t thought Hizette would bring these.</p>
<p>“Hizette, were you worried I’d get sick?’</p>
<p>“Worried? No, but that shouldn’t happen.” He lowered his head, looking embarrassed as he spoke.</p>
