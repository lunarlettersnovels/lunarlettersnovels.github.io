            <p><strong>Chapter 214</strong></p>
<p>Lacias unintentionally frowned as his eye hurt. It seemed like he could see something a bit bloody through his squinting eye.</p>
<p>“Whew….”</p>
<p>He let out a dry sigh before turning the other way. His condition was getting worse, and he could feel his fatigue piling up. And he knew the reason.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation without a known cause.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure why, but his sleep deprivation was worse than ever. Lacias was still able to sleep comfortably with Lila, but when he slept alone nowadays it was a disaster. Not to mention he wasn’t spending many nights with his wife recently.</p>
<p>This made Lacias’s complaining happen more often. “I want to sleep.”</p>
<p>Lugar turned his head thinking he didn’t hear his master properly. “Pardon?”</p>
<p>“I said I want to sleep.”</p>
<p>The knight was left speechless, he felt like he wasn’t ready to respond to such a sentence from the duke.</p>
<p><em>Does he want to sleep?!</em> In all his time serving Lacias, Lugar has never heard him utter that sentence. However, he knew if he said nothing, things would be even worse for him.</p>
<p>“My Lord. How about… We call a doctor….” Lugar spoke slowly. He was pondering how he was able to carefully let him know about this worry he was having.</p>
<p>“With Lila.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>“I want to sleep with Lila,” repeated Lacias monotonously.</p>
<p>His worry disappeared instantly and was replaced with an understanding expression. His tense body that thought his master had a medical condition relaxed and his face frowned like someone who stepped on horse crap.</p>
<p>“You should go. You can go have a nap.”</p>
<p>Of course, since it wasn’t concerning his health, he was relieved but his response came out a bit rudely. He sounded a bit jealous but didn’t mean it that way.</p>
<p>Lacias shook his head for a moment. “A nap?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Something Hir does.”</p>
<p>Lugar mentioned Hir on purpose, to imply that napping was for children.</p>
<p>“Good idea.”</p>
<p>Lugar was completely taken aback. The sarcasm completely flew over his master’s head. Not only that, but he seemed to be complimenting him for his mockery.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t I think of something like that? A nap.”</p>
<p>“Pardon…?”</p>
<p>Lugar’s mind was in shambles, why was his master acting like this? Is this the same master with a heart of ice? Is this truly the duke of Wipere? All these questions were looming in his head.</p>
<p>“If I take a nap, my concentration at work will improve and my efficiency will also improve. It’s a very good and effective method. Good, very good.”</p>
<p>“Pardon…?” Lugar was just stuck repeating himself like a winding toy.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Where are you going…?”</p>
<p>With that, Lugar was left standing alone, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Lacias on the other hand had no care in the world, his steps were as merry as ever and he had one objective in mind. For the first time in a while, he felt his joyful self return on his way to Lila. He felt ecstatic.</p>
<p>With Lacias’s quick stride and long legs, he was outside Lila’s office in no time.</p>
<p>As quickly as his happy thoughts came, they vanished. Before opening the door Lacias immediately felt something was off. He sensed two people beyond the entrance, two people he knew very well. One was his lovely Lila and the other was Hizette.</p>
<p><em>Why is Hizette here?</em></p>
<p>Normally, Lacias would work out the reason in his head logically, but not a single man in this world would think straight in this situation.</p>
<p>Before wasting any more time, Lacias swung the door open and spotted Lila sitting at her desk with Hizette standing to the right of her. The knight quickly bowed to his master without having eye contact with him, while Lila began to wonder why he didn’t knock.</p>
<p>“Lacias? Why are you here?” It was a bit of a rash question, but Lila meant to word it better. After all, her husband was acting differently from usual.</p>
<p>Lacias’s gaze went from Lila to Hizette, then eventually landed on a document on the table between the two. His eyes easily scanned the contents of it from his position and he smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“I came because I missed you. But am I interrupting something?”</p>
<p>Lila couldn’t help but grin slightly. “No, you aren’t interrupting anything. It’s a good thing you came here first.”</p>
<p>Lacias went beside Lila and sat down like a loyal, big dog. “What were you doing?”</p>
<p>He sat unusually close to Lila, making Hizette shift a little out of uncomfortableness. Even though he already read the document he wanted to hear it come out of Lila’s mouth. Innocently, Lila didn’t notice and told her part.</p>
<p>“I was talking to Hizette about Hir’s education. I was getting a report of his ring activation status as well. From now on I have to go into the succession class with him to see how the classes will be held per quarter, and all of that. I was also wondering what you would think about this so it’s a good thing that you’re here now.”</p>
