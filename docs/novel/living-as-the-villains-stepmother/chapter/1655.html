            <p><strong>Chapter 137 – A Possible Accomplice (2)</strong></p>
<p>With that said, Senior’s pupils almost seemed to have changed shape into hearts.</p>
<p>“Oh Lila you’re …!” She locked her arms with Lila to express her gratitude. “I love you so much!” Since Lila was shorter than Senior was, her body fitted right into Senior’s arms.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing?” A low warning voice was heard on the other side. Having felt the chills creeping all over her body, enough to make her hair rise, Senior quickly freed Lila from her arms.</p>
<p>“It- it was just out of gratitude. I apologize for my imprudence … So please don’t glare at me.”</p>
<p>Lila rolled her eyes at the drama ensued by Lacias. “You’re making her upset.”</p>
<p>As he got told off by Lila, Lacias’s invisible ear seemed to have sagged, to the extent that Senior nudged Lila on the waist, implying that she wasn’t upset in the least bit.</p>
<p>“As it seems like Roxanna has guided the nobles back to their places, I think we better go back to the mansion as well,” he said, in a hurry to change the subject.</p>
<p>Lila gave a nod in Lacias’s suggestion and uttered to Senior. “People will want to know about what really happened. Although we know that the fault is on Dawson, we still have to conduct an investigation into the cause of the commotion and give our sincerest apology as the nobles got involved in the incident.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will see to that.” Agreed Senior</p>
<p>“Prevention is important but how you deal with the situation after the accident is one of the important virtues as well.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your advice.”</p>
<p>Lila patted on Senior’s shoulder as a means to give her encouragement. Although she appeared fine, it was the undeniable truth her first hosting party was a failure.</p>
<p>“Alright, then we’ll head back first….” Just as she spoke Lila stopped herself.</p>
<p><em>Wait, wasn’t there something which I haven’t yet figured out? </em>She almost let her exhausted body take over when there was still something nagging her in Lila’s head.</p>
<p><em>Doug Blake!</em></p>
<p>The commotion from the party earlier made her forget about him, otherwise, she wouldn’t have forgotten about his presence.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Even though he had now come to her mind, it wasn’t like she had a way to find him anyways.</p>
<p><em>Did he even attend the party today?</em></p>
<p>It was true that her mind was distracted by the mysterious boy. However, there was no use in wasting time regretting losing him when there were more important matters to think of.</p>
<p>Lila turned to the party host who was waving goodbyes. “Senior, do you remember greeting Baron Dough Blake today at the party?”</p>
<p>“Baron Dough Blake….” She placed a finger on her lowered chin as she tried to recall. But just by the look on her face, Lila could tell what the answer would be.</p>
<p><em>Why didn’t Baron Blake attend today’s party?</em></p>
<p>“I don’t think I did.” Senior’s answer was just as she expected.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t he come to the party?” Asked Lila. “I’m pretty sure I received his reply to the invitation. Unless he did come to the party.”</p>
<p><em>He surely did come. </em>Thought Lila, reassuring herself.<em> There wasn’t a reason for him not to.</em></p>
<p>Doug Blake, who was supposedly connected to Dawson Hiln in some way, was staying low the whole time without even greeting the host of the party.</p>
<p><em>Doug Blake must have something to do with today’s commotion for sure!</em></p>
<p>With that, she remembered the abandoned property that was located in the Wipere Estate, which she had found to be suspicious. At once, she pictured a plan to destroy Doug’s base in her mind.</p>
<p>“Dawson and Doug seem to have shared a closer relationship than I expected. There’s a need to drag Doug down in order to bring Dawson down as well. For that sake, I’ll need you to put on a disguise, Senior.”</p>
<p>“Put on a disguise? What do you mean by … disguise?</p>
<p>With that, the corners of Lila’s lips drew into an almost comical grin. “Let me explain”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Are you sure you want to go back?”</p>
<p>“Yes, there’s nothing left for me to do there.”</p>
<p>Throughout the ride on their carriage back to the Wipere Estate, Lacias had his eyes fixed on Lila’s face. It seemed to him that Lila was disappointed for not getting what she wanted from the party. He carefully studied every change that occurred in her expression, like the changes in the level of her eyes, stiffness of her cheeks, and the movement of her lips.</p>
<p>“I feel really bad about how your party turned out, you hardly got enough sleep during the whole preparation.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t for the party’s sake that sleep was cut down. Lila’s real intention was to regain the mine; the commotion at the party was just a minor setback in her eyes.</p>
<p><em>I wouldn’t have been able to prevent it anyway. There is no need for me to blame myself.</em></p>
<p>The whole ordeal happened very quickly. It started by distracting the Wipere Knights with the boy then ended with the commotion. Just from that, she was able to see how much time and effort they invested into the plan.</p>
<p><em>I’ll make them pay double for what they did today.</em></p>
<p>However, it wasn’t the commotion that was troubling her. She was worried about Hir as he could have been poisoned by a Hole. And if he was, what is going to happen?</p>
<p>As there was no mention of those who were poisoned with the Hole in the original book, so she had no idea if there was a cure.</p>
<p><em>I really hope he isn’t. </em>Thought Lila desperately.</p>
<p>Although the possibility seemed high, Lila still prayed with all her heart.</p>
<p><em>May there be no obstacles in Hir’s future. And even if he encounters one, please give him the strength to overcome it.</em></p>
<p>With the progress of the carriage to the estate, the rays of the setting sun filled the interior.</p>
<p><em>The sun is setting down so soon.</em></p>
<p>Another quick day slipping away from her grasp. Unlike her boring life in the past, she could literally feel the time passing by in a blink in this world. Finding something to do in order to kill time was almost turture in her past life. Therefore, she didn’t have any complaints about her current life as she rather enjoyed a busy life compared to an idle one.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as Lila’s weary head tilted to the carriage wall, a hand came in between to act as a soft landing.</p>
<p>Despite having his hand reduced to her headrest, Lacias was wearing a contented smile on his face. Resting her head on Lacias’s soft hand instead of the hard wall, Lila’s eyes drifted away.</p>
