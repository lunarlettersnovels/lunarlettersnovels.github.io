            <p><strong>Chapter 202</strong></p>
<p>After having a friendly conversation for a short period, they drifted off to sleep one by one. Even Lila, who was stuck in the middle, fell asleep without being disturbed by worries. Unfortunately, even with the protection of Lacias and Hir sleeping peacefully beside her, she still woke up around midnight.</p>
<p>Looking at her family surrounding her made her heart swell. She certainly did love them. She needed to get up, but was stuck between their sleeping forms. <em>This bed is too small for three people</em>, she thought. <em>Why did we choose to sleep in my bed when it is so small?</em></p>
<p>Lila couldn’t understand this silliness. She was beginning to feel cramped. She needed to get out.</p>
<p>“Lacias?” she whispered. He was draped over her like a weighted blanket. “Are you asleep?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he mumbled in that state of semi-consciousness between dreams and reality.</p>
<p>Lila turned her head to the other side. Hir was definitely asleep. Lila could hear his breathing, untroubled and regular. After confirming that Hir was in a state of deep sleep, Lila turned back to Lacias.</p>
<p>“Lacias, it’s a bit uncomfortable.” She whispered in a slightly louder voice. There was no reaction. “I know you’re not sleeping. Why aren’t you answering me?”</p>
<p>He was either fully asleep or pretending not to hear anything. “Can you move to the side a little bit?” she asked, giving him a slight nudge.</p>
<p>He moaned slightly, but hardly shifted. Maybe he really was asleep. Lila was confused. Lacias never slept deeply. He would wake up at the slightest movement or sound.</p>
<p>“Lacias?” she whispered one more time. He still didn’t answer. She wiggled closer, putting her face a few inches from his. She studied his sleeping face. Even though his eyes were closed, she could still sense the piercing jewels that lay beneath his closed lids. She wanted to touch his face, but she was worried that she would really wake him. Instead, she just took in the shadows of his handsome features.</p>
<p>Lacias shifted slightly and buried his face into Lila’s arms, like a child looking for his mom in a dream. If Lila had been asleep, she would have hugged him back, mistaking the person in her arms to be Hir. Lila couldn’t resist the urge and began gently stroking his hair.</p>
<p>She thought about her past life. Then, the only joy she had came from when she was making something with her own hands. She liked to bake breads and cookies. It was what made her happy in her trivial life. But now she experienced a new sensation that she never imagined she would feel. Now she had people who were meaningful to her. People who she loved and wanted to protect.</p>
<p>Lila stroked Lacias’ hair as if she was petting a sleeping dog, something she wouldn’t have even dared to do if he was awake. She still couldn’t believe that he hadn’t opened his eyes. He always sensed her touch. He had to be pretending that he was sleeping.</p>
<p>“Lacias. You seem to be enjoying my touch.” Lacias moaned in contentment. “You were awake the whole time, right?” It was only then that Lacias opened his eyes. “If you were awake, why didn’t you open your eyes? Why were you pretending to be asleep?”</p>
<p>“Because you were saying things that you wouldn’t have said if I was awake,” Lacias smiled.</p>
<p>Lila remembered herself muttering about how handsome Lacias was. She could feel her face blush, but Lacias wouldn’t be able to notice it in the darkness.</p>
<p>“I was really happy. I want to pretend to be asleep again,” Lacias joked.</p>
<p>“Well, I can’t really remember what I said,” Lila fibbed.</p>
<p>“I do. Do you want me to tell you?”</p>
<p>“No, thank you.” Lila was too embarrassed to be reminded.</p>
<p>“I heard you are having trouble sleeping lately,” Lacias said. “I thought you were sleeping soundly, when I checked earlier. Did you wake up in the middle of your sleep?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I always seem to wake up around this time.”</p>
<p>“I’ll call you a doctor tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think taking medicine will solve my sleeping problem,” Lila admitted.</p>
<p>“Then why didn’t you tell me earlier? I would have come every day and made sure you had a good night’s sleep. I would have rubbed your back and stroked your hair until you fell asleep. When I did that earlier, it certainly worked.”</p>
<p>“It did?” <em>So, it was thanks to Lacias that I was able to fall asleep more easily than usual,</em> Lila thought.</p>
<p>“But from now on, I can do that for you every night.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>“Our bedroom is almost ready. We’ll be able to use it soon.” Lacias’ eyes twinkled like someone who had been waiting all day to reveal a big surprise. “It was designed completely differently from the bedroom of the former duke and duchess. Lila, you’ll never know how much effort I put into making the room so it perfectly matches your tastes.”</p>
<p>“Sounds exciting. I can’t wait to see it.”</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t for the damn traditions, we would have started using the same bedroom earlier,” Lacias said, frustrated.</p>
<p>“Traditions are meant to be preserved,” Lila informed him.</p>
<p>“I just thought it would be okay to let go of the old, outdated traditions.”</p>
