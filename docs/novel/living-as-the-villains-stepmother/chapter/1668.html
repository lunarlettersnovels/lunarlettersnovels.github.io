            <p><strong>Chapter 124 – Loose Ends</strong></p>
<p>“Can you mark your words?” She asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Of course. My sister is not going to achieve the purpose of this party.”</p>
<p>Lila narrowed her eyes. <em>The purpose of the party?</em></p>
<p>“You will find out just how big of a mistake you’ve made, ma’am. And you’ll regret taking the wrong side instead of holding my hand.”</p>
<p>Lila shook her head in response. “Haha, me?”</p>
<p>Dawson’s facial expression made it obvious that he was annoyed. The naive, gullible woman that he saw when he first came had completely vanished. Witnessing Lila’s mocking attitude made Dawson realize how wrong his predictions were. She was not an easy prey that would fall easily onto his bait. Not to mention that his line to try and trigger her seemed to have no effect. His head was dominated by confusion.</p>
<p>Lila took advantage of his confused state by making little of his words. “Obviously, I won’t regret something so small like that. Your thinking process interests me.”</p>
<p><em>Actually, it’s almost funny.</em> Lila murmured.</p>
<p>Dawson frowned instantly but still had no response.</p>
<p>“There’s a crucial point you seem to have missed, Dawson Hiln.”</p>
<p>“What….”</p>
<p>“Would you like me to explain it again?” asked Lila, almost mockingly.</p>
<p>Dawson closed his lips. He waited for Lila to speak up as if it would have hurt his pride to answer right away.</p>
<p>Lila grinned and courteously educated the dumb soul. “There’s nothing to lose.”</p>
<p>“…?” Dawson, who did not understand the meaning of her words, instinctively tilted his head.</p>
<p>Lila moved closer to his ear. She opened up her lips, which were plump like a ripe peach. “No matter who becomes the owner of the Hilns … I have nothing to lose, Dawson. I think you got the wrong idea. I myself am not the one to fight the battle.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I am to control my soldier, and even if that soldier ends up losing….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“This is solely for my entertainment.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Lila patted herself on the back mentally, not only was he not able to call out her bluff but she was also able to overwhelm Dawson Hiln with her confidence. Lila had no intention of entertaining herself by such means, it was all intended to overwhelm her opponent.</p>
<p><em>Then there would have been no struggling. I would have just winged it lightheartedly.</em></p>
<p>To fulfill her contract with Lacias, Lila had to choose between The Hiln Siblings and ultimately retrieve the diamond mines.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why she chose Senior over Dawson was that she knew Senior had more of a naive side than sly Dawson. However, she now truly believed that Senior was the more suitable one as the head of the Hilns.</p>
<p>Was it not unfair that Dawson, just because he was born first as a male, was to be the head without even thinking about evaluating Senior’s potential? If Senior was really a useless idiot, Lila definitely would not have had her partake in the first place. But Senior never had the opportunity to show off her abilities, even though she was as adept.</p>
<p>Lila studied Dawson’s face intently, trying to maintain a courageous attitude. <em>Did it work?</em></p>
<p>Dawson clenched his fist so tightly that it turned white, His hands were damp from sweat. He suppressed the nasty words under his tongue and mumbled. <em>Why? Why does this tiny woman feel like such a burden?</em></p>
<p>Dawson channeled his anger into a different energy, he had predicted his sister revolting against him and already had precautionary measures in place. It seemed that today was the day where those measures would come in handy.</p>
<p>He planned to gather his supporters and ruin Senior’s party. It was true that Dawson was not expecting the Duke of Wipere to come, but he didn’t seem to be too big of a hurdle to overcome. His plan was already forming and by now it would be on its way, and yet, just staring at the woman before him gave Dawson an uneasy feeling.</p>
<p><em>Why was she so confident?</em> He thought.</p>
<p>As Dawson caught eyes with Lila again, his unease turned to discomfort and this discomfort turned to rabid thoughts about his plan going wrong. He just wanted to leave already, Dawson wasn’t used to feeling this way. He also wanted to see how his supporters were doing out in the hall.</p>
<p>Lila’s perceptive eyes noticed his anxiety and said, “From your expression just now, I assume you understood what I meant.”</p>
<p>Dawson shrugged his shoulders. It was a habit that showed itself when he was anxious. He didn’t even realize it. “Yes. I understood” He sighed under his breath. “Negotiations with me are over, anyways I should go. I have many matters to attend to.” He tried to stay calm, but the urgency in his voice was obvious.</p>
<p>Dawson turned his back on Lila before she could reply and left, forgetting his manners as a noble. She was baffled.</p>
<p><em>What? Why is he acting like this?</em> Lila stared at Dawson with a puzzled look as he rushed to get away.</p>
<p><em>Is he trying to look strong?</em></p>
<p>Contrary to him stating he was busy, he simply fled to the party hall and poured himself a drink, disappearing into the crowd. Lila, who watched Dawson gradually leave, let out a dry sigh.</p>
<p>His confident personality was completely blown which was why he fled. Lila relaxed her own stiffened body as she caught her final glimpse of him and stood there thinking to herself.</p>
<p>She felt partially proud of making Dawson realize she wasn’t an easy match. <em>But there’s still something bothering me.</em></p>
<p>Among the many words that came out of Dawson’s mouth, one sentence caught her attention. He mentioned his sister not being able to accomplish her goals in today’s party and it didn’t seem like he was trying to scare her, it was a little too specific like many points in his sentences. <em>Is he planning to ruin Senior’s party?</em></p>
<p>If he did really plan to ruin it, she doubted his plan would take effect perfectly, but she had to get rid of all nuisances even if it meant wasting time. She thought of telling Senior before getting to work, but she quickly rethought her courses of action.</p>
<p>Senior was almost certainly still unaware of his plans, and letting her know now would make the situation any better. If Senior was to find out that Dawson was trying to keep her in check she would most likely feel proud and brag about it out loud, and Edith would figure it out with her big ears, then laugh it off to other people.</p>
<p><em>I don’t need to tell anyone.</em></p>
