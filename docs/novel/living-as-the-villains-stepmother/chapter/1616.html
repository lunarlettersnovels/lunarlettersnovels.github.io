            <p><strong>Chapter 176 – Motherly Advice (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Then can it be that he’s bored…?” muttered Lila, still thinking about Hir.</p>
<p>She was also bored herself. If it wasn’t for her own wedding, Lila would have already left the hall. It was unpleasant to have formal conversations with strangers, and besides, she was sick of the attitudes of those who were trying to win the new duchess’s favor with honeyed words.</p>
<p>“After today, we’ll take a break for a while.” Mentions Lacias, watching her face carefully.</p>
<p>“A break?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We’ll go for a picnic. And a little later, we’ll go on vacation.”</p>
<p>“Sounds great.” Anything sounded better than her current situation.</p>
<p>“Where would you like to go for a vacation?”</p>
<p><em>A place I want to go to….</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t an easy question to answer because she thought anywhere would be fine as long as she could be with Lacias.</p>
<p>When Lila hesitated to answer, Lacias smiled as if he had read her thoughts.</p>
<p>“I think anywhere will be fine….” She finally answers.</p>
<p>“So do I. But I want to take you to a place that perfectly suits your taste, so please let me know.”</p>
<p>Even in her previous life, Lila couldn’t afford to go on holiday, so she didn’t have such a strong preference.</p>
<p><em>But if I were to think of one place….</em></p>
<p>“I think it will be nice if it’s a place where it snows.”</p>
<p>“Snow….” He says slowly while rubbing his chin.</p>
<p>They would have to leave the Ahibalt Empire and travel quite the distance if they were to go to a place with snow. And Lila was aware of that.</p>
<p><em>So I doubt we’ll be able to go.</em></p>
<p>But things that were hard to fulfill were always what you wished for the most. She wanted to see Hir and Lacias standing on a snowfield in thick fur coats with their pale skin covered by a bright shade of pink from the cold. She wanted to capture every moment of the possibility with her eyes.</p>
<p>“Awesome. I also love snow.”</p>
<p>“Aw… really?” She knew it was a lie from a fact in the original story stating that Lacias disliked the cold. He was trying to please her and Lila couldn’t help but chuckle at that.</p>
<p><em>He’s cute.</em></p>
<p>“Snow….”</p>
<p>Lacias seemed to be lost in thought, trying to think of the perfect spot to go to in the middle of a snowfall. Lila did not mind going anywhere as long as it was with him, but Lacias seemed to want to take her someplace personal.</p>
<p>After a bit, Lila shrugged it off.<em> I guess I’ll just leave him to do what he wants.</em></p>
<p>People often felt happy just by the thought of taking their loved ones someplace beautiful.</p>
<p>A moment of thinking later, Lacias tapped her shoulder to regain her attention. “The only place that comes to my mind right now is the Nixon Kingdom. It’s quite far from here, but I’m sure you’ll like it.”</p>
<p>“The Nixon Kingdom….” Shortly after arriving in this world, she checked the global map to try and familiarize herself with some of the major countries. She didn’t want to be caught not knowing something as important as that.</p>
<p>The Nixon Kingdom, which was located on the Northern continent, was one of the most popular in the world. It was said to be winter every day there.</p>
<p><em>If I could go there, I’d be able to see as much snow as I want.</em></p>
<p><em>But what if Hir finds the place too cold? </em>All sorts of arguments began forming in her busy head.</p>
<p>There was no snow in the Ahibalt Empire. Besides, winter in Ahibalt wasn’t cold for Lila, who used to live in a country that had a freezing winter.</p>
<p>“The Nixon Kingdom is in winter the whole year, but that doesn’t mean there’s snow every day,” says Lacias. “We’ll have to wait until the weather gets a little colder there.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not a big deal since we have a lot of time, right?”</p>
<p>“…” Lila just smiled without a word So Lacias had to take her response as a yes.</p>
<p>“Just the thought of it makes me happy,” says Lila, as if she had to justify her joy.</p>
<p>“The place will be much more wonderful than you could imagine. We’ll have to pack a lot of warm clothes.”</p>
<p>Lacias was already thinking about what things to bring for the trip. He was really looking forward to this occasion, even Lila couldn’t avoid his infectious excitement.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Despite the wedding reaching its end, there was still a huge crowd in the party hall. Rather than returning to their homes, most guests chose to stay as a way of somehow pleasing the Wipere family on their day of wonder.</p>
<p>Looking around the hall, two groups of people caught Lila’s eyes. The first group, which had Edith leading the conversation, seemed quite entertained.</p>
<p><em>She’s doing great.</em></p>
<p>Edith was very clever, and seeing her help without giving orders impressed Lila even more. Lila could tell from first glance that Edith was close to perfect in every area.</p>
<p>The second group where Camerline was, had a polar opposite aura. She wasn’t engaged in any conversation and people were just standing gracefully, giving off an elegant atmosphere. Some guests tried striking a chat with her, but she just responded with one-word answers</p>
<p><em>They must be trying to impress her as they did with me. </em>Thought Lila, understanding her situation.</p>
<p><em>Or could it be that they’re trying to persuade her to invest in their businesses?</em></p>
