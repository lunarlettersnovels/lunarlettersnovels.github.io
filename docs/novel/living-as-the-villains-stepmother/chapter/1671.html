            <p><strong>Chapter 121 – Eyes of a Snake</strong></p>
<p>Around the end of the original story, there was an episode in which Lugar became aware of his feelings towards Roxanna. Of course, it was a story set in the distant future. Nonetheless, in Lila’s eyes, Lugar was already fond of Roxanna, despite him not recognizing his own emotions. She would never have recognized this if she hadn’t known the story. Meanwhile, Lacias wasn’t aware of anything.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. Let’s go,” Lila assured him.</p>
<p>“Okay?” Lacias tilted his head in puzzlement, and shut his lips firmly as Lila pulled on his arm.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“I didn’t notice anything suspicious,” Lugar stated.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Is there a chance that you encountered a man with brown hair, brown eyes, and no other distinct features except that he had a lot of freckles?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>“That description is vague. Do you remember his attire?”</p>
<p>Lila traced her memory, but didn’t remember what the man was wearing. She had been too distracted by the hostility of the man that she didn’t have time to examine his clothing. She only remembered his face. She shook her head in response and Lugar groaned, turning silent.</p>
<p>“I could have imagined it, so there’s no need to invest too much time in investigating. Lacias also didn’t see him, so it must have been my mistake,” Lila said.</p>
<p>The man had looked noticeably foreign in the party hall, but apparently no one else noticed anything out of the ordinary. These nobles were highly experienced and more vigilant individuals then she was. If they hadn’t noticed anything odd, then it was valid that Lila had been mistaken.</p>
<p>“I’ll still take another look. It’s safer to be sure. It’s no trouble,” Roxanna replied, looking at them with a stern face.</p>
<p>Lacias nodded in agreement. “Go investigate with Lugar. Don’t be obvious and stay low.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir.” Lugar and Roxanna silently disappeared in order to not impact the party.</p>
<p><em>I wish I was imagining things</em>, Lila thought. She didn’t want any incidents during Senior’s first party. She had no time to be distracted. She was on a tight schedule. She had to meet not only Doug Blake, as quietly as possible, but also Dawson Hiln.</p>
<p>“Shall we go back to the party hall? The music seems pleasant. May I ask you to dance with me?” Lacias asked.</p>
<p>“Dance?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Will you dance?”</p>
<p>Lila was silent for a moment. She remembered having no idea how to dance. When she entered this world, she became Lila. Memorizing the names and complicated courtesies had been a breeze. What actually gave her a hard time was learning the dance moves. She had developed them, but was not skillful. Every step and move challenged her. Fortunately, she rarely had to dance, since she did not attend parties often.</p>
<p>“I’m not a talented dancer,” she admitted.</p>
<p>“Who cares? I’ll lead. Trust me.”</p>
<p>Lila didn’t want to appear to the other guests as if she was struggling. Lacias chuckled at Lila’s apparent discomfort.</p>
<p>“You can say no if you are not interested. Please don’t wear that expression,” Lacias assured her.</p>
<p>“What expression?”</p>
<p>“That cute pout.”</p>
<p>Lila cringed. <em>How could a duck-like pout be cute?</em> she thought.</p>
<p>Lacias continued grinning his mischievous smile and added, “It’s true.”</p>
<p>Lila turned and walked into the party hall, away from Lacias’ apparent mockery. She could hear him giggle from behind.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“What are you upset about?” Lacias insisted on following her.</p>
<p>“I’m not upset.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you when you pout.”</p>
<p>“I’m not pouting.” She noticed Lacias’ lips twitch, suppressing another laugh. She wasn’t mad, only embarrassed. She couldn’t shake the notion that Lacias was intentionally making fun of her. He was clearly entertained by her reaction.</p>
<p><em>Where the heck are Edith and Senior?</em> she thought, desperately searching for them. Perhaps, if she started a conversation with them, she could detach herself from Lacias.</p>
<p>“Do you have a moment? The people over there are desperate to say hello to you.” She couldn’t think of any other plan to rid herself of her followers.</p>
<p>“My priority is to always stay by your side. I’m not that acquainted with those guests.”</p>
<p>Lacias wouldn’t benefit from idle socializing. She needed to release herself from his clinginess. If Lacias kept lingering beside her, it would be challenging to meet with Dawson Hiln. Dawson Hiln would be informed of her affiliation with Lacias, but there was clearly a difference between encountering him by herself and having Lacias right beside her. Lila planned to shun him away, but that would prove to be difficult.</p>
<p>“Lacias, about our wedding…” She deliberately mentioned a topic that would grasp Lacias’ attention.</p>
<p>“What about the wedding?” As expected, Lacias immediately responded.</p>
<p>“Have we chosen the flowers and the music for the wedding? This party seems to be going so smoothly with a prominent theme. It’s a clever idea. The music also…” Lila continued to babble on about any random idea she could think of, as she looked around the hall. Searching for a way out, her eyes desperately sought someone familiar. She barely heard Lacias as she continued to spit out words, her gaze scanning the room.</p>
<p>“Lila.”</p>
<p>“The wedding would look great with a black and white concept…”</p>
<p>“Mother has told us twice that she already has everything planned. What are you going on about?”</p>
<p>Her plan had failed. She couldn’t look him in the eyes. With a relief, she spotted Roxanna entering the party hall.</p>
<p>“Roxanna must be done investigating,” she said, with a great sigh.</p>
<p>Roxanna noticed Lila and Lacias from across the room, and walked towards the couple.</p>
<p>“You’ve arrived at a very bad time,” Lacias mentioned, half joking. Lila, on the other hand, was beaming at her arrival. To her, Roxanna looked like an angel of mercy.</p>
<p>“Lugar and I searched around the party hall, but we didn’t find the man in question. We apologize.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing to apologize about,” Lila assured her. “I must have imagined him. I’ll admit I’ve been quite tired lately.”</p>
<p>“Are you feeling well?” Lacias showed immediate concern. “I told you to take it easy. There’s absolutely no need to rush into anything.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing major. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t hurt to be careful. I think you’re overworking yourself.” Lila could have said the same about Lacias.</p>
<p>“Well, we want to be absolutely sure, so Lugar and I will search both the exterior and the interior once more. Ms. Lila noticed him inside, so there’s a probability that he’s hiding. I’ll come back with Lugar, to give you an update, when we’re finished.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Roxanna.” She took Roxanna’s hand in gratitude. As the woman turned to leave, Lila spotted one of the men she had been waiting for. Red hair, with a salty disposition. Dawson Hiln’s pupils were constricted and slit, like the eyes of a snake. They made him appear sinister.</p>
