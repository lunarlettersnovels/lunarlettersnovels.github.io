            <p><strong>Chapter 227</strong></p>
<p>Even in this situation, Lila was most curious about Hir. She was curious about Lacias as well, but he she could guess about. Not Hir.</p>
<p><em>Maybe he was now at peace to see his stepmom gone? Maybe that’s the best. The traumas inflicted on him would never be healed otherwise.</em></p>
<p>He couldn’t forget the time she’d abused him. It had caused the child nightmares.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no one who’d want to be forgotten by their loved ones. But Lila had truly hoped Hir would forget about her. At least then his trauma could disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>And if Hir got a ‘real mom’ that treated him with love, then… <em>I’ll be satisfied. That’s enough for me—if Hir can be happy.</em></p>
<p>Hir’s life was more important than Lila’s second life. She smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“Young Master Hir is—” Hizette began, but she held up a hand to stop him, despite herself.</p>
<p>“Wait. I’ll hear it later, when I’m more ready.”</p>
<p>Hizette sighed. “When do you think you’ll be ready?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“In my perspective, becoming ready isn’t easy.”</p>
<p>“Yes…” Lila felt a twinge of sadness. “You’re right. I may never be ready.”</p>
<p>“You won’t, if you avoid it out of fear.”</p>
<p>“But I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>Lila really hoped that Hir would find a better mother, but she wasn’t ready to accept the truth. Probably because she’d given too much of her heart to Hir and Lacias.</p>
<p>“Miss Lila.”</p>
<p>“Mmhm?”</p>
<p>“I know this might be out of line, but I think you need to hear it.”</p>
<p>Hizette didn’t want to say it. He thought she would blame herself. But if she didn’t hear about Hir’s condition, she might never ask again, and she might feel even guiltier if she found out about it later.</p>
<p>“Did something happen to Hir?” Lila asked, her hands trembling. There was some ominousness in Hizette’s words.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you exactly what happened,” he said. “Just that he keeps crying and having nightmares, and he doesn’t look too well. He barely eats, so he’s so much thinner now—like he was when you first showed up at the Duke Castle.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what?”</p>
<p>When she’d first come to the castle, Hir had been abused so badly by his stepmother that he’d had little more than skin on his bones.</p>
<p><em>I left delicious food and sweet dessert. </em>Lila buried her face in her hands. <em>What is going on?</em></p>
<p>She’d left her happiness for her loved ones, but now no one was happy. Lacias was scouring the Empire for her, and the knight order had remained the same. The fact that even Hir had stopped eating altogether left her feeling skeptical. Had she really made the right choice?</p>
<p>“Hizette?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Lila?”</p>
<p>“In your perspective, do you think I made the right choice?”</p>
<p>“I…don’t know why you made the decision, Miss Lila,” he said. He hesitated for a moment, then went on. “But I know that when you make a happy choice, everyone around you is happy.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p><em>But I can’t forgive myself for making Lacias a prisoner.</em></p>
<p>If it hadn’t been for Lila, Lacias would have been freer and happier with his right. But he’d put a leash on himself. Lila simply couldn’t accept it.</p>
<p>She wasn’t a god. She didn’t know what the right choice was. She sat staring blankly at the table and thought about it, determined to arrive at the most ideal conclusion.</p>
<p>“Miss Lila,” Hizette said, “I’ll be going back now.”</p>
<p>“Ah, okay. Thank you for coming and helping.”</p>
<p>“I’ll get the gun repaired using that Baron Parret Iris’s name. I’ll use the same delivery address and get someone to bring it.”</p>
<p>“Perfect! How long will it take?”</p>
<p>“You should get it within a week.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Lila said. She felt a bit more stable, thanks to Hizette. If he hadn’t helped her, Lila was certain her situation would have been a lot worse.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I heard my item was delivered to this place, as I put the wrong address. Can I get it?”</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“P-Pirot—no, Baron Parret Iris.”</p>
<p>Lacias had just received an unknown package. He stared at the man who had come to pick it up. The man was thin, and he looked so anxious his eyes seemed to roll in their sockets. Definitely suspicious.</p>
<p>“Do you know what’s in the box?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Lacias snapped.</p>
<p>“I…it’s a gun.”</p>
<p>Lacias couldn’t help wondering why this Baron seemed so nervous coming to pick up his item. It hadn’t dawned on him that a man as large as himself could make other people anxious.</p>
<p>“A gun?”</p>
