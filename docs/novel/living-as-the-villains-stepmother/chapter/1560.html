            <p><strong>Chapter 232</strong></p>
<p>Lila’s round, violet eyes widened, and a shiver raced through her body.</p>
<p>All because of this man before her. Lacias’s lips were soft and warm, and as he kissed her, she felt the warmth fill her.</p>
<p>She shut her eyes. What she was feeling was very real. Feeling short of breath, Lila gave Lacias’s chest a slight push, but he didn’t budge.</p>
<p>“Shh—stay still,” he said, his fingers curling around her wrists.</p>
<p>Lila still couldn’t breathe properly. Her heart was pounding wildly in her chest. This was her first kiss.</p>
<p><strong>T/L: Previous chapters indicated that Lacias and Lila spent their wedding night doing the deed. The team will review the specific chapter concerning this and make appropriate corrections.</strong></p>
<p><em>I can’t believe it.</em></p>
<p>She could still remember the past, not too long ago. Only about a year earlier, when Lacias begged to kiss her and she rejected.</p>
<p><em>Did I think it would end up like this back then?</em></p>
<p>She could answer that with certainty. The answer was <em>never</em>. Lila remembered the first meeting with Lacias, through all the things they’d been through. It had become a memory, but she could feel it as though it was happening right now.</p>
<p>“I think I lived for this day,” Lacias was saying. “To meet you, to hug you and…to be with you, Lila.”</p>
<p>His voice sounded awestruck, like this was his first kiss as well.</p>
<p><em>Wait, it’s really his first kiss? Thinking about Lacias in the original novel…</em></p>
<p>It was quite believable. And seeing him act like a little boy after their kiss seemed to prove it.</p>
<p>“I really can’t believe it,” he continued. “That I can feel your warmth and kiss you.”</p>
<p>Lacias slowly rubbed Lila’s hand on his cheek, looking just as amazed as she was. She still couldn’t believe what was happening.</p>
<p>“I…” she said. “I’m also thinking the same.”</p>
<p>“I’m so happy I might die, Lila. I’m your responsibility now.”</p>
<p>“A-alright.”</p>
<p>“Forever.”</p>
<p>“Mhm. Forever.”</p>
<p>“Whatever the cause.”</p>
<p>“Yes, whatever the cause.”</p>
<p>Lacias wrapped his arms around her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Oh my. I think I’m shaking.” Lila confided in the man behind her.</p>
<p>“Why are you shaking? You’re coming back to your place.”</p>
<p>A huge and familiar castle revealed itself through the dust. The clearer it became in her vision, the more nervous Lila got. The horse was moving so quickly, she could hardly calm herself.</p>
<p>The home she missed seemed to draw nearer.</p>
<p><em>Thump, thump</em>. The heartbeat she would rather not hear was drumming in her ears.</p>
<p>“I’m nervous because Hir is there.”</p>
<p>“Are you confidentially saying that your heart is beating because of another man in my presence?”</p>
<p>“What?” She almost turned to look at him. “You’re calling Hir a man?”</p>
<p>“He’s not a daughter.”</p>
<p>Lila was riding the same horse Lacias, seated in front of him so she was wrapped in his embrace. She had to turn her head just to see his smiling face.</p>
<p>“How funny.”</p>
<p>“Hm, already busted. But it’s true. No one but Hir.”</p>
<p>“Won’t happen, anyway.”</p>
<p><em>How laughable,</em> she thought. It was like a complaint, but there’d been some playfulness in her voice as well.</p>
<p>They arrived at the castle after series of banter. The soldier guarding the gate took one look at Lacias’s face and opened the doors in surprise, letting them through.</p>
<p>“Hir must be resenting me,” Lila said. “He must think I’m a bad stepmom. I’ll be sad.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” he told her. “I’ll educate him.”</p>
<p>“Educate?” Lila glanced at him doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Brainwashing him to think what kind of situation his mother was in?”</p>
<p>“Haha. What is that?”</p>
<p>Lacias continued to joke around, trying to make her less nervous, for which she was quite thankful. She could feel herself growing calmer.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I think I’m ready.”</p>
<p>“I honestly don’t want to lose you today. But…I should concede, right?”</p>
<p>“You’re an adult.”</p>
<p>“In times like this, I’d rather be a child.”</p>
<p>The bright, pretty smile on his face really fit him. Lila made a silent promise to herself: she would not see any concern on his face from now on.</p>
<p><em>No matter who this body was in the past, I’m going to do my best for the ones I love.</em></p>
<p>She might have jumped the gun and run away, but there was nothing better than being with the ones you loved. With Lacias, she was truly courageous.</p>
<p>Lila clenched her fists.</p>
<p>“You won’t have to be that scared.”</p>
<p>“But it’s true that I hurt Hir. Well, you as well…”</p>
<p>“I’m just happy you came back. You don’t have to worry.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said. “For taking some of the guilt off my shoulders.”</p>
<p>His being so considerate left her feeling a little lighter. She had no idea what she would say when she saw Hir but felt confident that he wouldn’t hate and reject her.</p>
<p><em>That is enough for me.</em></p>
<p>As long as Hir didn’t shut himself from her.</p>
<p>Lila could be patient and wait. As much as she’d hurt the child, she was ready for it.</p>
<p>“Hurry and come back.”</p>
<p>“With Hir?”</p>
<p>“Mm, that might be out of the question. Come back alone.”</p>
<p>Lacias smiled and let her off the horse.</p>
<p>“Am I not heavy?”</p>
<p>He looked so calm even though he’d had to lift her from underneath. At her question, Lacias laughed.</p>
<p>“How is a feather heavy?”</p>
<p>“Psh…” Lila tapped Lacias’s shoulder, smiling. Her nervousness was truly gone.</p>
