            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 81 – A Year Left (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Hir?”</p>
<p>“Mother, you’re here.” Hir welcomed Lila as soon as she set foot back in the manor. Standing behind Hir was Jane, who was bearing the same smile plastered on Hir’s face.</p>
<p>“The young master kept on asking me when you’d be back since he wanted to greet you like this, isn’t he just wonderful?”</p>
<p>Lila nodded at Jane’s words. She thought that she was used to her stepson’s adorable antics by now. But one glance at Hir instantly threw that thought out of the window as she looked at him endearingly, smitten from the way he was looking up at her with his round, googly eyes that was nothing but warm and kind.</p>
<p>She was grateful for having had the chance in being Hir’s stepmother, even if it was just for a short while. If she did not become Madame Marshmell, she would have died not knowing that such overwhelming happiness existed, and for that she was thankful.</p>
<p>“Hir, thank you for welcoming me back so warmly.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I read that children should greet their parents when they get home from work.” Hir explained.</p>
<p>“You did?” It was not surprising that Hir was able to understand things quickly. A child’s mind was like a sponge after all. With this, Lila wondered for a brief second if there’s anything else he would do, but she brushed the thought off. Hir welcoming her like this was enough. Lila bent her knees and opened her arms wide to invite him for a hug.</p>
<p>“Oh..” Hir’s cheeks flushed in understanding. He fidgeted on his spot before walking towards her slowly like he wasn’t sure of what he’s doing. He bit his lips with eyes cast downwards and immediately jumped into her embrace.</p>
<p>Lila wrapped her arms around him, her chin softly propped on top of his head. “Thank you, Hir. You gave me such a thoughtful gift.”</p>
<p>Hir shook his head slightly as he muttered. “It’s really not that much..”</p>
<p>“Remember the time you gave me flowers? I’m always grateful for your gifts.”</p>
<p>“Well.. You give me sweets every day!” Hir exclaimed.</p>
<p>Lila chuckled as she ruffled his black hair. Before, he used to freeze up like a caught deer whenever Lila touched him. But now he was welcoming her affectionate touches, finally easing himself to her like he really was with his mother.</p>
<p>Lila quickly dismissed the idea. Such thoughts would not do her any good. She settled with the notion that Hir just wanted to feel warmth that felt like home. Any child would want the same.</p>
<p>It was just like the time when Hir first met Rosie in the original work. While Lacias had been a great help in being a stepfather, he really wasn’t an affectionate one that would shower Hir with constant love and attention. Rosie then filled the gaps that lacked greatly in Hir’s life by doting him with her gentle personality.</p>
<p>“Hir, did you eat well?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t eaten yet.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Lila asked. It was already past his dinnertime.</p>
<p>Hir grew even more flustered. “I… I just thought it would be nice to eat together, if you didn’t have dinner yet..”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Lila already had a rather simple meal with Lacias after they returned from searching the building. She wanted to spend more time with Hir, though, seeing how he patiently waited for her arrival just so they could have dinner together. A white lie wouldn’t hurt, right?</p>
<p>“I haven’t eaten yet, what a coincidence! Let’s go eat together, shall we?” Lila beamed.</p>
<p>“Really?” Hir’s eyes widened in surprise. Lila turned to look at Jane, prompting the latter to explain what got him so excited. “The young master had been wanting to share a meal with you the whole day.” The maid said sheepishly.</p>
<p>If Lila had only known that Hir was waiting for her all this time, she would have come back as fast as she could. Lila pulled Hir as she hugged his head in wordless apology. “Let’s go eat something delicious then since you waited for so long.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Hir cheered happily.</p>
<p>“Do prepare Hir’s favorites tonight, okay?” Lila addressed Jane.</p>
<p>“Of course!” Jane smiled before turning around to head to the kitchen.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The meals were sparse despite Lila’s instructions. The table was filled with Hir’s favorite meals, but only in small portions since having a huge meal before sleeping was unhealthy.</p>
<p>“This is not enough, but I’ll make sure that we’ll have a big feast tomorrow, okay?” Lila said, hoping that she’d be able to make up to him.</p>
<p>“I’m happy with this, actually.”</p>
<p>“You are?” Lila glanced at Hir, noting the honesty in his words. It seemed like he really was not greedy, not even caring much about the wealth he’s been born with just like in the original work. Even though he had been in a rough patch after going through a series of hardships, Hir only wanted to punish those who wronged him with Rosie right beside him.</p>
<p>Lila wished that Hir would let himself be the kid that he was. She wanted him to act his age shamelessly, to retain the sweet innocence his childhood provided and she would do whatever it takes to prevent him from being hurt just like in the original work.</p>
<p>“If you could have one more dish on the table, what would that be?”</p>
<p>“Hmm..” Hir thought his answer carefully, holding his fork in one hand. She could basically see the gears in his head turn while Lila looked at him fondly.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Hir shook his fork like an excited puppy. “There’s one thing I’d like!”</p>
