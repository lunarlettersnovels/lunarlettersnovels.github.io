            <p><strong>Chapter 223</strong></p>
<p>In all honesty, she hadn’t had much of an opportunity to speak with him. He was quiet and always busy. The Hizette she was dealing with felt a little different from the one she’d originally known. Just as Lacias was a different person.</p>
<p>“By the way, is it okay for you to come like this?”</p>
<p>“Did you see it?”</p>
<p>“Mhm.”</p>
<p>The fact that Lacias was looking for Lila.</p>
<p><em>Of course she knows.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t like he’d thought she wouldn’t know. It had been expected, right from the moment she left. But it was a lot earlier than he thought.</p>
<p>“There’s already a ‘Wanted’ poster where I live. I went out to get a coat but came back because of it.”</p>
<p>“I…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Why are you sorry? I’m just glad you brought me a coat.”</p>
<p>“It would’ve been better if I told you first.”</p>
<p>“Mhm, but that wasn’t possible. Also, it’s not good to blame yourself on something that already happened.” She considered tapping his shoulders but decided against it. “I’m just happy to see you here.”</p>
<p>Hizette looked away looking embarrassed.</p>
<p>“It’s quite lonely to be alone,” she said.</p>
<p>He said nothing, but simply stared at her.</p>
<p>“I thought I’d gotten used to it, but I really feel alone now that I’m away from everyone. It’s hard to handle.”</p>
<p>“If you want to go back—”</p>
<p>“It’s not that.” She was serious. As if she had no place to go back to. Lila was already acting like a stranger. She suddenly began admiring the chestnut color coat. “Oh, your style is decent.”</p>
<p>“Thought it would suit you well.”</p>
<p>“I like your senses. You’ll make a happy wife.”</p>
<p>“A wife…”</p>
<p>His face took on an awkward expression, as though he’d never considered marriage. Lila enjoyed making fun of Hizette.</p>
<p>“So…when are you going to answer my question?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What question?”</p>
<p>“I asked if it’s okay for you to come like this. Lacias seems to be on a mission to find me, so isn’t the Knight Order really busy? Especially Hizette.”</p>
<p>“Smart, as usual.”</p>
<p>Even though she hadn’t seen it personally, she knew the Knight Order inside-out. Was it because she had the ability to pick the right answer and understand the flow? Hizette was curious for a moment.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think I’d be able to come, either. But I asked for a vacation, thinking I should come here soon, and he allowed it. Maybe it was because I’ve never taken a vacation before.”</p>
<p>“Not once?”</p>
<p>“I never had a reason to. It’s not like I have people to see outside the duke’s castle.”</p>
<p>“I see.” <em>What a lonely guy, </em>Lila thought, looking at Hizette in pity. He was gazing fixedly, almost determinedly, at the candle on the table.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Ah, so cold,” Lugar whispered.</p>
<p>He hadn’t expected Lacias to hear it, but Lacias’s hearing was keener than he’d thought.</p>
<p>“You’re cold?”</p>
<p>“N-no.”</p>
<p>“If you’re cold, I can kick you out right away. Do you want that?”</p>
<p>“It’s not cold at all!” Lugar said quickly. “I misspoke!”</p>
<p>Lugar heard Roxana tsk-tsk but said nothing.</p>
<p>The Elites of the Wipere Knights had already arrived in the Nixon Kingdom. It had been only a few hours since Lacias announced that they would be going to Nixon. They rode on their horses without rest. The Nixon Kingdom was cold, unlike the Ahibalt Empire. Everyone was shivering, but they were too afraid of their master to show it.</p>
<p>“Group A to the North, Group B to the South,” Lacias ordered. “And the Grand Master and Deputy Master is going to the plaza in the town.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir!”</p>
<p>The group quickly split up, which made the scouting easier. Lacias himself was going to scout the town by the harbor.</p>
<p><em>She always said she wanted to see snow, </em>he thought. It had been in his mind since he promised himself he would show Lila snow. That was why he’d planned to come to the Nixon Kingdom. But circumstances had changed his reasons.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Lacias, Roxana and Lugar began searching around the plaza in the harbor town. There was a ‘Wanted’ poster of Lila there as well. Lacias stopped for a bit as he stepped into the town.</p>
<p>“Where will you go first?” Roxana asked.</p>
<p>Lacias said nothing. She didn’t ask again. After a few minutes, he replied, slowly:</p>
<p>“The furniture shop, first.”</p>
<p>“Furniture?”</p>
<p>“If she settled, then she would’ve gotten furniture first.”</p>
<p>Roxana was amazed by her master’s insight. She began looking around all the furniture shops, asking the owners about Lila. None seemed to have any useful information.</p>
<p>Until she reached the last shop.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes—I remember!” said the owner, a bespectacled old man.</p>
<p>“What?” Roxana asked, a gleam in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Aren’t they newlyweds?”</p>
<p><em>Wait, what? Newlyweds?</em></p>
<p>Roxana and Lugar turned to Lacias. He stood still, so cold that ice seemed to be falling from him.</p>
