            <p><strong>Chapter 224</strong></p>
<p><em>Hey, what should we do?</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t know…</em></p>
<p>Roxana and Lugar shared an alarmed look before they returned their gazes to their fuming master, Lacias.</p>
<p>He said nothing, merely stood there, but his expression wasn’t stern at all. Not nearly. Instead, he looked shocked. The air around him turned colder, as though it was a representation of himself.</p>
<p>Roxana gulped. “W-were they real newlyweds?”</p>
<p>It seemed unbelievable. Lila remarrying so quickly after disappearing? It wasn’t like her.</p>
<p>Lacias continued gazing wordlessly at the storeowner. The man looked flustered. All three newcomers were staring hard at him. He had better answer their questions and tell them what he’d seen that day.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if they were married, but the furniture they were purchasing was the sort of thing newlyweds buy. Also, they both seemed quite affectionate. Especially when they were picking out furniture. The man kept looking at her longingly, even while they were standing away from each other. It was such an affectionate look.”</p>
<p>Lacias’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
<p>“Ah!” the shopkeeper went on. “And it seemed he was buying an anniversary gift for the lady. He had it secretly wrapped. I figured they must be newlyweds—oh! You’ll break it if you grasp it too hard!” The man quickly remarked after seeing Lacias’ grip around a glass candle.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Lacias’s hand tightened around the candle that the mysterious man had gifted Lila. He’d only meant to look at it but had clenched it in spite of himself. A loud crack filled the air.</p>
<p>“It broke.”</p>
<p>He could feel it cracking in his grip, but his anger was so powerful he could not let go. The glass shattered in his hand, the pieces scraping his palm as they fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“Master! Are you okay?” Lacias’s injury was only superficial, but Roxana was more concerned about his feelings. “You know better than anyone that Lil—I mean, the Mistress, wouldn’t do such a thing.”</p>
<p>Lacias knew that. Then again…</p>
<p><em>I also didn’t know she would leave me quietly.</em></p>
<p><em>Even though she wouldn’t, she did. She left me.</em></p>
<p>Lila was unpredictable. She came into his life without warning and left in the same manner. He wore a calm countenance then lightly, he said, “There must have been some heavy furniture they couldn’t carry with them.”</p>
<p>The shopkeeper’s eyebrows rose slowly. “Ah, yes! You’re right. I did deliver some of them.”</p>
<p>Was it because he had experience? Even though Lacias hadn’t asked precisely, the owner seemed to know what to say.</p>
<p>Lacias nodded slowly. “Tell me?”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>“The address. Tell me.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lacias was feeling rather agitated. So much that he kept clicking his nails without realizing it. So much that he hadn’t noticed Roxana and Lugar observing his every movement in fear.</p>
<p>The address the storeowner had given him was quite far from the store. At the edge of town, to be precise. The perfect location for a runaway.</p>
<p><em>Was she really planning on leaving me?</em></p>
<p><em>Why, though? What did I do wrong?</em></p>
<p>Nothing had changed from the start. Lacias loved Lila with all his heart, and he tried to look his best for her. He’d given her everything he had.</p>
<p>But if Lila had left even after all that…</p>
<p>Wouldn’t that mean her mind had changed?</p>
<p><em>Or that she got sick of me…</em></p>
<p>His fingers shook just thinking about it. In fact, his entire body trembled like a canine that had been abandoned by its owner.</p>
<p>The carriage ride to her place was taking too long. He wished he could grab hold of Lila, right this second, and demand to know why she’d left him. He wanted answers.</p>
<p>His mind flashed back to the day before her disappearance.</p>
<p><em>Did something happen?</em></p>
<p>Lila, who was always beautiful, had shone that day, her purple eyes filled with an infinite amount of love.</p>
<p><em>She didn’t abandon me.</em></p>
<p><em>No, no… I’m sure that’s not it.</em></p>
<p>He wanted to be sure, but it was becoming increasingly difficult. He had to stop thinking. It suddenly occurred to him, for the very first time, that he thought and worried too much, as he had no more fears or dangers to face in battles.</p>
<p>“How long?” he asked.</p>
<p>Thinking objectively, it was probably better to ask Lila herself why she’d left rather than to keep wondering about it himself. He must find her the soonest or else he’s afraid he would lose his mind for good.</p>
<p>“I think we’re close.” Lugar pointed outside. “That house might be it.”</p>
<p>It was a small, wooden house—so small he couldn’t help but wonder how anyone could live there. It might be big enough for a peasant, but that was it.</p>
<p>Lacias got out of the carriage, heading straight for the house. Ordinarily, he would have circled the building, scouting its surroundings, but he hadn’t the mind to do that right now. He banged on the door repeatedly.  A sound came from inside, but the door remained shut. With a scoff, he continued banging on it.</p>
<p>“Open the door. I know you’re in there,” he said. Another bang. “I’ll break it down if you don’t open it. I’m out of patience.”</p>
<p>Still no response. Lacias growled.</p>
<p>“You really—”</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe she wouldn’t open the door even at his threat. Roxana glanced sideways at him. In response, he gave a jerk of his head.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll break it,” Roxana told him, determined to please her master.</p>
<p>“Carefully, so she doesn’t get hurt.”</p>
<p>“Ok.” Even now, despite all that had happened, he was concerned about Lila’s wellbeing. The reason Lacias hadn’t elected to break down the door himself was that he was worried he might use too much force and hurt Lila.</p>
<p>Roxana summoned her ring instead of breaking the door down with her fist, so she wouldn’t hurt anyone. Lila, for instance. A ring of energy materialized in the air and soon split the door in half, revealing a couple of people.</p>
