            <p><strong>Chapter 226</strong></p>
<p>“By the way, I need something.”</p>
<p>“What is it? I’ll order it.”</p>
<p>“It’s this. You don’t have to order it.” Lila showed Hizette a gun she’d carrying the whole time.</p>
<p>“I’ve been carrying it around, but I need it fixed. I was going to do it while I was at the mansion, but I didn’t have the time…”</p>
<p>It was a gun that fired rings. And had been a while since its last use. The trigger felt heavy, like it needed some oiling.</p>
<p><em>Finally getting it fixed.</em></p>
<p>There had been many knights on guard when she lived in the duke’s Mansion, but now that she lived alone, she needed to learn to defend herself. She had no idea what could happen. The gun was a necessity.</p>
<p>“It’s an odd-looking gun,” she said. “So, I was hoping you could take care of it. Make sure to use a fake address, like the last time.”</p>
<p>“Should I use the same address as the last time? It’ll be easier since you bribed him.” Lugar raised a point.</p>
<p>“There’s higher risk, though, since it’s been exposed already.”</p>
<p>“There’s also some risk in trying to find another address,” he pointed out. “There’s already a bounty on you. They might find it suspicious if you’l be bribing many people.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, too. So I’m pondering.” Lila understood his suggestion. It was risky trying to find a new fake address. Now she needed to find a way not to fix the gun right now.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about making a fake person.”</p>
<p>He frowned. “A fake person?”</p>
<p>“The point is to create a fake identity. Since I won’t be able to go out in public, a fake person can act for me. I’ll buy an identity and use it for everything.”</p>
<p>His eyebrows rose slowly. “Aha…”</p>
<p>“I can request a repair for the gun using a fake name. I think a common name should work best. For example, Baron Parrot Iris. If we mix up another step, it’ll be harder to trace me. That means that even if I’m found, I’ll have time to run.”</p>
<p>“You’re really brilliant, Miss Lila,” Hizette remarked, gazing at her in awe. He’d considered the risks of the fake address, but he hadn’t thought this far ahead.</p>
<p>“I also found a route for money laundering,” she went on. “The money I brought is all Empire currency. Of course, it can be used in the Nixon Kingdom, but it’s noticeable.”</p>
<p>“That means—”</p>
<p>“It’ll be easy to trace,” she said, nodding. Her eyes sparkled, like someone who’d discovered her talent.</p>
<p>“Miss Lila,” Hizette said.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you resting at home?”</p>
<p>“I was. I was hanging out at home all day.”</p>
<p>Hizette looked around the house. Then he finally saw something that he hadn’t before: the Nixon Kingdom’s geography, its mountains and mines, the politics between nobles, and more. It was almost as if she’d lived on the dark side before.</p>
<p>He frowned. “Just how did you manage to get your hands on all of this?”</p>
<p>“Hm? I used a fake identity to visit a bank. It was only a one-time thing, though, so I can’t use it again.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you worried about your face being revealed?”</p>
<p>“I invented a fake person. I was treated like a VIP when I dressed up as a noble and used an agency. It didn’t take long for me to get these things.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p><em>Maybe Lila’s talent really is something else?</em> Hizette pondered for a moment whether it was right to keep her in the Nixon Kingdom, which was basically a suburb compared to the Empire. It felt like someone who should be working in politics was being exiled.</p>
<p>“How’s is it going in the Empire?”</p>
<p>“Not too well.”</p>
<p>She lifted an eyebrow. “That was a quick response.”</p>
<p>“It really isn’t good. And the Duke Wipere family is at the center of it.”</p>
<p>She understood what he meant. If the atmosphere in the Wipere family was troubled, so was the entire empire. It was amazing how much influence the family had.</p>
<p>“Master is especially the worst of them all.”</p>
<p>She inhaled softly. “Lacias…”</p>
<p>“He even took all the knights from the palace to find you. It’s never been done before.”</p>
<p>“He must be furious,” she commented and stared at the floor.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s none of my business anymore. I am doing this for his own good.” There was bitterness in her eyes as she spoke.</p>
<p><em>I was busy with other things anyway. I have been deluding myself with adjusting to Nixion Kingdom and getting supplies.</em></p>
<p>But the made up distractions could only do so little. Lila still yearned for Lacias, however, there was something else that she was truly curious about.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“How…how’s…Hir?”</p>
