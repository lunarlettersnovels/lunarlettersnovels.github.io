            <p><strong>Chapter 180 – Counseling</strong></p>
<p>Lila glanced at Lacias’ face, but he was still smiling without a word, it was difficult to read his thoughts. Lila rushed towards Camerline in embarrassment.</p>
<p>It was only when Lila walked out of his sight that he hardened his face again.</p>
<p>“Let’s continue with our conversation.” It seemed like he had become a completely different person from when he was with Lila.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“What happened?” asked Camreline with a hint of worry to her tone.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. I think there was a little misunderstanding between the two. Lacias was just giving him some life advice.”</p>
<p>“Huh? life advice?”</p>
<p>“I mean, do you believe him? I guess you still have no idea of what’s going on between them.”</p>
<p>Lila also found Lacias’ behavior somewhat strange considering his personality. Still, she chose not to go further nor question him. Camerline clicked her tongue and added.</p>
<p>“He’s acting like a fox in front of you. I wonder whose personality he took after.”</p>
<p><em>Fox….</em></p>
<p>Lila partly agreed with her words. In her eyes, Lacias <em>was</em> acting like a fox.</p>
<p><em>And the thing is, he gets better at it day by day.</em></p>
<p>Seeing Lila lost in thought, Camerline waved her champagne glass in front of her.</p>
<p>“If there was nothing between them, why did they disappear?”</p>
<p>“Wait, what?”</p>
<p>Lila instantly turned to where the two were and grew increasingly confused. Lacias, who had been standing there with the man just a second ago, was no longer there. And the nobles were busy murmuring something.</p>
<p><em>What’s going on?</em></p>
<p><em>I should have asked him more. I thought it wasn’t something serious, but now that I think of it, I shouldn’t have left them like that.</em></p>
<p>Lacias, who she thought would come back soon, disappeared without a word, and his whereabouts were unknown. What was even more frustrating was that there was no way to find out where he went.</p>
<p>“Where do you think he went?” she asked, turning back to Camerline.</p>
<p>“He’s probably torturing him at best since <em>I assume</em> he would not want to kill someone on his wedding day.”</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Camerline had no idea why Lila was so surprised.</p>
<p><em>This place is definitely different from where I used to live.</em></p>
<p><em>Torturing</em>. Lila knew that it was a normal thing in the novel. It was also something that Hir had experienced when he got kicked out of the Marshmell mansion, but it was still sudden to her.</p>
<p>“I’ll go find him.”</p>
<p>“Lacias will take care of it,” said Camerline, brushing it off.  “I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to follow him. What if you happen to see bloody things?”</p>
<p>“I know that he’ll take care of it, but still.”</p>
<p>Camerline slightly narrowed her eyes and asked. “Is it because you don’t want to stay apart from him even for a minute?”</p>
<p>“….Yes, you’re right.” Lila had to lie so that she could go and find him, she didn’t want to leave abruptly.</p>
<p>“Then I have no choice but to let you go.” Camerline smiled proudly and waved her hand. Fortunately, Lila could leave the main hall without exciting suspicion.</p>
<p><em>Either Lugar or Roxana would have accompanied him.</em></p>
<p>Both Lugar and Roxana always gave off an aura that caught people’s eyes, so she thought there would be at least one or two people who had seen them. But the problem was that there was no one around there who she could ask about their whereabouts.</p>
<p><em>…How Will I be able to find Lacias in this huge mansion?</em></p>
<p>Lila found Lacias by luck last time, but she wasn’t sure that such a miracle would happen again.</p>
<p><em>It’s okay, I have the necklace…. </em>She reassured herself.</p>
<p><em>This necklace will help me since the ring inside always trembles whenever I get close to him.</em></p>
<p>However, she would have to walk around every corner of the mansion to see if the ring would respond. Besides, Lacias might have taken the man to a secret place where one cannot easily find.</p>
<p>“No, I can do this.”</p>
<p>Lila decided to walk around the inside first. She went down the stairs to the floor a little far away from the main hall.</p>
<p>Just then, Lila saw a man standing on the staircase.</p>
<p><em>Who is that? </em>Lila walked up to the man, thinking he might know her husband’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>The man, who sensed Lila approaching, turned around. Even before She could open her mouth, the man spoke with a cheesy smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Hello. It’s been a while, Duchess Wipere.”</p>
<p>“…Baron Blake?”</p>
<p><em>What bad timing. </em>Facing Doug Blake, Lila felt an unpleasant chill.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen each other quite a few times through papers, so it feels like meeting an old friend, haha.”</p>
<p>He was giving off a completely different vibe from when she saw him before. She wasn’t sure since when, but Baron Blake began to act like an old man in his 50s who is as sly as a snake and an expert at buttering people up.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Well, I don’t think that’s the case for me.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you chase me diligently? Whenever I tried to do something, you got in the way. Did I misunderstand your intention?”</p>
<p>“Since there are many suspicious cases and rumors surrounding you, I had to.” She responded firmly.</p>
<p><em>It would have been better if someone was with me. </em>Lila clenched and unclenched her fists repeatedly to relieve the tension of her stiffened body.</p>
<p>“So, did you find out a lot about me?”</p>
<p>“If my answer is no, are you going to tell me about yourself without me having to investigate?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I can do that if you want.” Doug Blake grinned at her. His eye tooth, which had turned yellowish and slightly black, appeared.</p>
<p>“Did you know that we used to know each other very well before?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p><em>Madame Marshmell was not just close with Enrique but also Baron Doug Blake?</em></p>
<p>“We were, but a lot earlier than you might think.”</p>
