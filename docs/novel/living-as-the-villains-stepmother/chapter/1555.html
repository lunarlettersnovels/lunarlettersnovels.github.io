            <p><strong>Chapter 237</strong></p>
<p>“I feel like it’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“Since we don’t attend these events much.”</p>
<p>Lacias seemed to be in a good mood as he waited to be announced. He looked like a child waiting for his gift. Lila locked her arms with his and glanced at him. Then she met his eyes. She’d been caught red-handed.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me like that, my lovely wife?” Lacias asked, coming to stand before her and covering her cheeks with his hands so that her small face was covered. When he spoke, his voice was filled with awe. “Oh, you. You’re like a snowflake.”</p>
<p>Lila’s cheeks burned. “Eh? Let go now.”</p>
<p>“I can’t—you’re too adorable.”</p>
<p>Lila, who had been filled with anticipation from his prolonged staring, pushed his hands away, feeling cheated, but the more she did, the more Lacis latched onto her.</p>
<p>“I’m happy,” he said.</p>
<p>She blinked. “Are you? Why?”</p>
<p>Was he happy because he felt like he was out on a picnic?</p>
<p>Lacias’s response was entirely different.</p>
<p>“It feels like I’m announcing to everyone that you’re my lady. I’m very happy.”</p>
<p>She could feel the pressure on her face from his hands as he spoke. He wasn’t just saying how he felt. She could feel what he was feeling.</p>
<p>With a smile, Lila placed her hand on his. Lacias’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>Then they melted.</p>
<p><em>If I could see that smile forever…</em></p>
<p><em>I feel like I could do anything, to make my loved ones smile.</em></p>
<p>“The Duke Wipere family is entering!” The door opened at the knight’s announcement, and they entered at <em>the welcoming sound of drums.</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s the Duke Wipere family.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s the Duchess Wipere who was missing. Just what happened? We heard nothing of what happened!”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s Duke Lacias Wipere! We never see him because he never shows up, but he’s handso—”</em></p>
<p>The attendees threw flower petals at the Duke Wipere couple. The white petals danced down. <em>So pretty. </em>Lila caught a petal before it fell, marveling at its beauty.</p>
<p>“It’s magnolia.”</p>
<p>“It is?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Its flower meaning is noble so it’s perfect to sprinkle it when nobles enter. It also suits you.”</p>
<p>She heard him mumble, wondering whether he should put the flowers in their bedroom. Just because Lila had said it was pretty, Lacias was thinking about all kinds of magnolia.</p>
<p>The long road ended, and many nobles approached them, their eyes gleaming with curiosity. But they couldn’t speak to them. Only Enrique strode toward the Wipere family. It was a rule that only the highest-rank noble greeted first, and there was no one higher than Enrique at this party.</p>
<p>“Such high nobles, arriving later than me,” Enrique said curtly, his features contorting slightly.</p>
<p>“The carriage was delayed,” Lacias replied with a scoff. “We’re still newlywed.”</p>
<p>At the word “newlywed”, Enrique ground his teeth. Then he faced Lila.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the response to my letter, Duchess…Wipere.”</p>
<p>It felt like he was emphasizing each syllable.</p>
<p>“I was just trying to respond to your kindness,” Lila replied with a smile.</p>
<p>“Both of you just…” He trailed off, but they realized what he’d been about to say. Lila’s grin brightened. It was best to show him that she couldn’t be swayed in this situation.</p>
<p>“Yes, I received your very thoughtful response. I have something to discuss with you regarding that.”</p>
<p>“Say it.”</p>
<p>“It’s not something to be said in public—isn’t that so?”</p>
<p>The nobles around them had overheard and were now talking amongst themselves.</p>
<p><em>“Is there something between the Emperor and Duchess Wipere?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Did they meet in secret?’</em></p>
<p><em>“Is that why she went missing for a bit? Because of what she did with the Emperor?”</em></p>
<p>Enrique shrugged his shoulders. His face said it all. Everyone looked at Lila and Enrique questioningly.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t we talk about it alone?”</p>
<p>Enrique’s creepy voice brought a frown to Lacias’s face.</p>
<p>“If you have something to talk about, you can talk with me. I’m the husband.”</p>
<p>“Just because you’re her husband doesn’t mean you know everything. Doesn’t her opinion matter the most?”</p>
<p>He looked pretty confident, as though he’d won.</p>
<p><em>Does he have something up his sleeves?</em> Lila wondered, studying Enrique’s face. <em>It’s obvious what he’s going to say. Probably something about Mrs. Marshmell’s past that I don’t know about.</em></p>
<p>It was something she had to solve at the same time. Would he really believe her if she told him the truth, that it really was something she didn’t know about, that she was not pretending?</p>
<p>Lila glanced at Lacias.</p>
<p><em>Even Lacias…could he believe that I’m another soul that became a part of this body?</em></p>
<p>It sounded absurd, even to her, to claim that it was in the past or come out and say who she really was.</p>
<p>Lila continued to ponder, but Enrique shrugged his shoulders, as though he took it as a yes.</p>
<p>“She seems to want to talk alone.”</p>
<p>Lacias stared wordlessly at Lila. But she couldn’t deny it. She did want to speak to Enrique. More specifically, she wanted to find out what exactly he was planning.</p>
<p>When Lila didn’t say anything, Lacias leaned over and whispered in her ear. “It might be dangerous,” he said. “I don’t want to allow it.”</p>
<p>“Lacias.”</p>
<p>“Even if you call me sweetly like that, I’m not changing my mind. But…” Lacias drew a short breath. When he spoke again, he sounded like he would rather have said nothing, but was merely doing otherwise because he had to. “If you still insist, then I’ll yield. You have always been wise and intelligent.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for trusting me.” She smiled at him.</p>
<p>“But…” Lacias added suddenly.</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>“On one condition.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Lila asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Lacias had a grim expression on his face, but he looked so funny, she felt like she could accept just about anything.</p>
<p>“I’m going to kiss you when you come back,” Lacias told her.</p>
<p>“Hup!”</p>
<p>It was impossible to hold back her laughter, and Lila’s face soon turned bright red. Lacias tilted his head, looking somewhat confused.</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing?” he wanted to know. “I’m serious.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m laughing!”</p>
<p>“You can’t take this as a joke.” Lacias still looked serious, even though Lila was struggling to hold her laughter. Clearly, he didn’t understand the cause of her amusement.</p>
<p>“I’m not laughing because it’s funny…”</p>
<p>“Anyways I told you. I’m going to kiss you even if there are people around.”</p>
<p>She laughed again.</p>
<p>“If you can handle it,” Lacias said, smiling slyly, “then go.”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay.”</p>
<p>“You can’t take it back.”</p>
<p>“Okay, really,” she promised, but he still looked upset. He looked like a child, like Hir.</p>
<p><em>How can Lacias not be Hir’s birth father?</em></p>
<p>She’d never seen Count Marshmell’s son, who was the father of Hir, but she suspected he must look different from Hir. Hir had the looks of an angel. It had to be the face of Lacias…</p>
<p>“Madam, let’s go. Not much time.”</p>
<p>The cute face of Hir face was erased from her mind as Enrique burst in.</p>
<p>“Brace yourself.”</p>
<p>Lila clutched her necklace as she followed Enrique, feeling Lacias’s gaze on her.</p>
<p><em>Lacias is here anyway,</em> she thought.<em> If something happens, he’ll save me.</em></p>
<p>That was enough to give her courage.</p>
