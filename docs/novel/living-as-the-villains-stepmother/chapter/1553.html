            <p><strong>Chapter 239</strong></p>
<p>“This is all you had after being so confident?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I thought you prepared something grand.” She regretted thinking so much. She’d been worried about what kind of card the Emperor had up his sleeve. <em>This</em> was it?</p>
<p><em>I don’t care if everyone knows that I’m a foreigner. Maybe Lacias.</em></p>
<p>But Lila trusted him.</p>
<p>Even if Lila wasn’t just a foreigner but also possessed, Lacias wouldn’t change. Of course, she wasn’t a hundred percent certain, but the trust they had built up until now filled her with some confidence.</p>
<p>“You thought I would be scared if you threatened to tell everyone, but you’re sadly mistaken.”</p>
<p>“Why are you so confident?”</p>
<p>“If it’s revealed, I’m just a very wondrous person. If I use my power, I could probably become a Saintess who receives orders from God.”</p>
<p>“D-Duke Wipere wouldn’t forgive you.”</p>
<p>“Reveal it if you think so. Ah, but there’s one more thing to be revealed.” As she spoke, Lila opened the door.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Senior and Edith stood waiting outside the door. Lila’s ever-trusted people.</p>
<p>This was why she’d been able to come here without Lacias. Lila had planned for Senior and Edith to intervene to reduce the danger.</p>
<p><em>Even though my plan to scream loudly was ruined by the soundproof wall.</em></p>
<p>Senior and Edith looked a little flustered as the door swung open, but only for a moment.</p>
<p>“It’s the report on the investigation of the Emperor’s corruption, Ma’am.” Senior bowed politely and handed her the report.</p>
<p>Enrique frowned. It was only right to greet the Emperor first, due to ranking, but Senior and Edith acted like he wasn’t even there.</p>
<p>“You’ve done well,” Lila said. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“You gave us all the key points,” Senior replied. “I merely investigated.”</p>
<p>Edith stepped between them as they grinned at each other. “Ah, is it my turn, then, sis?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Edith. You can do it, right?”</p>
<p>“I’m best at making anyone the worst person in the world!” Edith basically knew everyone in every social group. And she had the ability to spread rumors secretly. Enrique knew this. His face paled instantly.</p>
<p>He might be the Emperor, but everyone knew that the Empire was being maintained due to the agreement with the Wipere family. If the Wipere family broke the agreement, if the prisoner was destroyed, then Enrique wouldn’t be able to stay as the Emperor. And that was what Edith was gunning for.</p>
<p>“Enrique,” Lila said, “You’re going to be the first Emperor to have all your people turn against you.”</p>
<p>Enrique stared at her, unable to form words.</p>
<p>“I’m going to make it that way,” she told him.</p>
<p>And Edith shouted, from behind Lila, “My sis always keeps her word!”</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><em>Crack!</em></p>
<p>Lila instinctively glanced up at the deafening sound. Rings were exploding like fireworks in the night.</p>
<p>She’d left Enrique with Senior and Edith and returned to the party, and at the sight of the scene, her jaw dropped.</p>
<p><em>So beautiful…</em></p>
<p>Even Lila, who had had frequent interactions with Rings, was trembling in awe, so other nobles’ reaction was expected.</p>
<p>“Wow! What is that?”</p>
<p>“That’s the Ring that Wipere family is so proud of!”</p>
<p>“Such beauty, with such destructive power. It’s unbelievable!”</p>
<p>Lila slowly made her way through the maze of nobles, still glancing up at the sky.</p>
<p>The Rings followed their owners’ traits. The Rings all had different colors, which meant that multiple people were shooting at the same time. The Wipere knights. Roxana’s Ring, Lugar’s Ring, Hizette’s Ring. Many Rings colored the sky. It was like watching the Milky Way.</p>
<p>The cold night air touched Lila’s cheek, but she was too distracted to pay it any notice.</p>
<p>This was a sight that she might never again see. She wanted to remember every second of it. Everyone else probably thought the same.</p>
<p>“That blue light is particularly pretty.”</p>
<p>“I know. It’s outstanding.”</p>
<p>There was an overwhelming amount of Rings in the sky, and many hands pointed.</p>
<p><em>Only Lacias would be able to make such a powerful Ring. Who could…?</em></p>
<p>Her thoughts froze. Who could make that blue Ring, if not Lacias?</p>
<p><em>Mother!</em> The words floated in her memory all of a sudden.<em> My Ring is blue.</em></p>
<p>There was only one answer.</p>
<p>“Who is it? That person is controlling it perfectly.”</p>
<p>“I heard it’s Hir Wipere. He’s very talented.”</p>
<p>“Ah! I heard his swordsmanship is outstanding as well. Controlling the Ring so expertly…he is indeed the heir to the Wipere family.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to go out of my way and say I predict he’s going to be winning every tournament.”</p>
<p>Hir. When had Hir’s skill improved so much? It felt like only yesterday that she’d been sparring with him.</p>
<p><em>Was it while I was gone?</em></p>
<p>She’d figured that she wasn’t among his happiest moments.</p>
<p><em>I promised myself that I would protect all of Hir’s happiness.</em></p>
<p>“He is indeed the Duke Wipere’s heir.”</p>
<p>It felt like her dream had finally come true. Hir’s happiness and other people’s acknowledgement. And, the promise she’d made to make him happy.</p>
<p>She walked around until she spotted Hir. He was smiling brightly amongst the knights. He’d become a completely different person from what the novel had depicted him as. The setting of Hir growing up with all the evil was gone.</p>
<p>All thanks to Lila’s effort and love.</p>
<p>She nearly teared up at the sight of Hir smiling happily alongside great people.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t she be smiling at the sight?</p>
<p>Lila rubbed her eyes. She was tearing up with happiness.</p>
<p><em>Lacias made Hir’s debut stage. </em>Only Lacias could control the knights. He had made it happen because Lila wanted it.</p>
<p>Hir would have his debutant when he came of age, so Lacias hadn’t had to do this. But Lila had wanted it. For that reason alone.</p>
