<p>“You’re right.” They assessed the situation quickly. Lacias used his rings to see if there’s anyone nearby the establishment while Lila observed the building for any sign of movement. It wasn’t even a minute when Lacias’ rings came back.</p>
<p>“No one seems to be around.” Lacias stated.</p>
<p>“That’s strange. The way I see it, there might be a secret meeting being held inside at this very moment.” Lila responded.</p>
<p>Lacias regarded Lila. “A secret meeting?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He’s connected with the Hilns.”</p>
<p>“Oh.. The Hilns?” Lacias stroked his chin in contemplation as he took in Lila’s words. It was the first time he heard of this.</p>
<p>“There are no windows on the lower stories.” Lila then pointed at the upper part of the building and continued, “Windows are only placed there where pedestrians couldn’t see them.”</p>
<p>Lacias nodded. He understood where Lila was getting at. “Something is definitely going on.”</p>
<p>“Yes. And I wonder what that is.” Lila’s eyes sharpened, her assumption of Doug Blake being suspicious growing more valid by the second. How quickly the tides have changed when she didn’t even pay him much attention during the Hiln’s party.</p>
<p>And now here she was, wary of everything that concerned Doug Blake.</p>
<p>There’s something she wasn’t able to read from the original work, and Lila needed to figure out what it was since it may pose as a threat to Hir, and it may also serve as a crucial part in carrying out her contract with Lacias.</p>
<p>And why was the building even located at the Wipere lands? If she were in his place, she would have chosen a place that was far from the Wiperes as much as possible.</p>
<p>“We would be able to figure out what this building is, right?” Lila asked as she scanned the building for the last time.</p>
<p>Lacias nodded. “There should be a record of it since it’s located here within our lands. I’ll look into it when I return.”</p>
<p>Lila smiled at the assurance. “Thank you. Do let me know if you find something out.”</p>
<p>The sun was already setting, but the Baron had yet to come out. It seemed like he was going to stay there the whole night.</p>
<p>Lila decided to call it a day. At least she had been fortunate enough to come across the Baron, she thought. Just as she turned around to tell Lacias they should leave, he spoke. “There’s a better way to end this day.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Lila’s eyebrow rose in curiosity.</p>
<p>“How about going to my manor instead of waiting here?” He suggested.</p>
<p>Did she hear him right? She must’ve misheard him. “Are you really suggesting that I go to your manor before we even got married? That was a sure way of stirring up a scandal, so no.” Lila replied adamantly.</p>
<p>“I don’t really care.” Lacias shrugged.</p>
<p>Lila only smiled at his nonchalance. “But I do.” Lacias slyly avoided her eyes to prevent himself from blushing. “I care about what people say about me.” Lila added.</p>
<p>Hearing her words, he immediately glanced back at her. “I don’t believe that.”</p>
<p>Lila went on as if she didn’t hear him. “You’re quick to understand, so you know full well that I won’t agree to it.”</p>
<p>He knew Lila enough to understand that once she made up her mind, it would be hard to convince her otherwise, even though his words were nothing but sincere.</p>
<p>“By the way..” Lila said.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Lila looked up at the sky. “You said that we had to go somewhere, but it’s nighttime already.”</p>
<p>“Right. I didn’t notice.” Lacias said, his eyes panning to the dimness of their surroundings.</p>
<p>“Should we just head back? We can talk more about the Baron inside the carriage. I really am curious about where we’re going, though.”</p>
<p>“We can go next time.” Lacias stated.</p>
<p>“Well that’s disappointing.” Lila sighed.</p>
<p>“We have a long way ahead of us, so it doesn’t really matter.” Lacias smiled reassuringly.</p>
<p>Lacias took her by the hand and placed it on his arm. She grew silent as she repeated his words over and over. They had agreed that they would be married for a year, but the way he spoke made it seem like they have years worth of marriage, like it was something he was looking forward to all this time.</p>
<p>Having a marriage ceremony when it’s not necessary was also strange, was it not?</p>
<p>As much as she wanted to make things clear about where they stood, she couldn’t find it in herself to ask him right now, especially when she asked him to follow Doug Blake. Instead of pestering him, she decided to keep it to herself for the time being. “Yes, we have a lot of time ahead of us.”</p>
<p>A year was still a year, anyway. It was still quite a long time.</p>
<p>Lila walked, several steps ahead of Lacias who stopped in his tracks to take in Lila’s form in front of him. Lila noticed that she could only hear her own footsteps, void of Lacias’ own. She turned around to ask him why and saw him staring at her so fondly. He would remember the sight of her so vividly— like a clear, brightened day despite the looming darkness surrounding them.</p>
