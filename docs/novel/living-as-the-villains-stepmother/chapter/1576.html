            <p><strong>Chapter 216</strong></p>
<p>Hizette helped Lila onto the carriage and went to the driver’s seat. They had no designated horseman, so he had to lead it. They were dressed in shabby clothing so no one would suspect them coming from royalty.</p>
<p>“When… do you think they’ll find out?” asked Lila with some hesitation.</p>
<p>“Who knows. It’ll depend on the master’s decision. If he’s the one looking for you then probably immediately, if not then we might have some more time.”</p>
<p>“Depends on Lacias. So, you’re saying we have no chances of knowing then.”</p>
<p>“That isn’t something we can predict,” he answered frankly.</p>
<p>Lila shifted in her seat. “I’m a little bit worried.”</p>
<p>The fact that they couldn’t predict when they’d find out meant they could be on their tails right now.</p>
<p><em>No, stop worrying too much.</em></p>
<p>Lila shooed away her concerning thoughts and changed her question.</p>
<p>“What did you tell them when you left?”</p>
<p>For Lila, it wouldn’t be too bad even if she was caught, but Hizette was different. Helping someone as important as the duchess escape would be considered treason of the highest order for him. Not to mention the lewd rumors that could be spread about him.</p>
<p><em>Why is he helping me?</em></p>
<p>No matter what she thought, there was no benefit for Hizette. The only reason was that Lila asked him. Even though he was betraying Lacias, who he was loyal to his entire life, he was still here, helping her. Lila was about to ask him when he decided to answer her previous question.</p>
<p>“…I was supposed to be out for work today.”</p>
<p>“Out for work?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>So that’s what he told them….</em></p>
<p>His schedule showed that he was out for work, so Hizette’s alibi wouldn’t be suspicious. Unless someone with great wit doubted him.</p>
<p>“That’s why you chose today.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was a good time and everything seemed to fall in place.”</p>
<p>And then silence. Hizette’s face showed that he was deep in thought. It felt like he was rethinking his actions, perhaps even regretting them. She thought for a moment about this, but it didn’t seem to make sense, There was water under the bridge now so turning back was not an option.</p>
<p>Lila also didn’t add anything and closed her eyes. It was hard to speak with Hizette whose mind was full of thoughts and guiding the horses.</p>
<p>The sound of hooves filled up the surrounding. Dust and wind seemed like it was shaping Lila’s future.</p>
<p>She thought she only slept for a moment, but it seemed like she slept deeper than she thought. As she looked around, a whole different scenery from Duke Wipere’s territory appeared. It was the first time she was completely out of Duke Wipere’s territory. Awkwardness and fear came in unison as she took in the unfamiliar surroundings. The reality of her situation began settling in.</p>
<p>As she checked the driver’s seat, Hizette looked exactly the same as they left. If he was tired the knight was good at hiding it.</p>
<p>She couldn’t guess exactly how many hours they’d traveled, but according to her waist and butt that hurt, it seemed like it’s been quite a while.</p>
<p>Lila stared at the trees and occasional cottages speeding past them before turning back to the driver with the inevitable question.</p>
<p>“Hizette, how far did we go?”</p>
<p>“Quite far. The sun is already high up in the sky. I’m also not too familiar with the surroundings but judging by the map, I think we’ll be arriving soon. I got you a small house.”</p>
<p>“Then we’re already in the kingdom?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I see….”</p>
<p>She could feel that she wasn’t in the empire. Unlike the fanciness she passed through before, the atmosphere felt a little mundane and quiet compared to the bustling crowds and markets of the empire. It felt like going to the countryside from the capital. “It’s not as bad as I thought.”</p>
<p>Lila knew she would be unhappy and uncomfortable after leaving Lacias and Hir’s sides but now that she began accepting her circumstances, she felt a little calmer.</p>
<p><em>Maybe it hasn’t settled in yet? Would I really feel awful once it settles in that I’m away from their embrace?</em></p>
<p>“Are you ok?” asked Hizette.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. You’re the one who worked hard.”</p>
<p>“I’m used to it. I’ll stop the carriage here.”</p>
<p>Hizette stopped the horses slowly after tugging on their reins. After landing lightly on the ground from the driver’s seat, Hizette patted the horses as a form of encouragement and opened the carriage door to let Lila out.</p>
<p>“You can leave the carriage now.” Hizette kneeled on one knee and flattened his thigh. It was so that Lila can step on it. Lila stared at his thigh for a bit and then just jumped off to its left.</p>
<p>“Lila…! It’s dangerous!”</p>
<p>This wasn’t unlike Lila, as she usually hopped off the carriage on her own. But Hizette made a big deal out of it as if it was the first time happening.</p>
<p>“It’s not even that high,” said Lila reassuringly.</p>
<p>“But isn’t it safer to just get off stepping on me?”</p>
<p>Lila sighed, having to explain this to all the knights. “Hizette, your leg isn’t a stair or object so why would I step on it. It’s heavy and it hurts.”</p>
<p>Hizette had a grumpy look on his face. “…I Don’t think I would even feel your weight.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think you were one for speaking back.” Lila jested. “…Next time just step down. I think my heart dropped a bit and hurt more than your heel stepping on me.”</p>
<p>Lila chuckled as she walked past him, she wasn’t used to having long conversations with Hizette.</p>
<p>The knight hurriedly caught up to her and matched her speed. The two walked slowly as a small wooden house could be seen on the horizon.</p>
<p>It seemed to have caught her eyes even though she wasn’t looking around. Lila stared at the house for a while and asked Hizette.</p>
<p>“Is this the place?” She recognized her new home right away.</p>
