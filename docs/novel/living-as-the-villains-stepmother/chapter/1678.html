            <p><b>Chapter 114 – I’m Not a Baby</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimicking her own thoughts, Lila nodded her head. “I don’t mind. I want Hir to have the best education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacias beamed with excitement at her response. “Then I should officially introduce Lugar to Hir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like an interview?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sort of.” Lila chuckled. Lacias’ words often entertained her, even if they were ordinary. She turned to meet eyes with the silent boy staring at them from afar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hir, what do you think? Do you also think it’s best to switch teachers?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um….” He was taken off guard with her sudden interest in him again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s really up to you. It’s also crucial that your teacher gets along with you well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really… ?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. It’s a basic right of yours.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a sweet child. How is he ever going to be strong enough to live on his own?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lila patted Hir’s shoulders. She could almost feel his concern for his old teacher getting fired. It was no wonder why he suppressed his fear the entire time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And I won’t tell the teacher about our conversation. It’s nothing to be sorry about, but just in case you might feel uncomfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay … ! Tha-that sounds good!” He nodded his head eagerly. He seemed to brighten up a bit at the fact that he would not have to see his teacher again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacias went out for a moment to figure out Lugar’s location, then found himself back in the room a few minutes later. “Lugar is in the gymnasium. How about we take this chance to introduce Lugar to Hir?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No problem.What about you, Hir?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He made sure to meet her eyes before answering. “Uhm….” The moment their eyes met, Hir had a sudden burst of confidence. “Sure!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lila affectionately stroked the bright boy’s head. He closed his eyes like a little puppy in response. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s so cute.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to when he stiffened at even the slightest touch, this was a drastic improvement. Lila could not believe how much Hir and her relationship had developed, she couldn’t even express how happy she was, more that she didn’t want to show it at that moment.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would love to hug him. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lila came up with a good idea while glimpsing at Hir. “Do you want a hug?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?!” Hir’s eyes and mouth expanded. He looked more surprised than she expected him to be.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I say something that incredible? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Lacias looked envious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After noticing his jealous glare at the corner of her eyes she sighed to herself quietly. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t cuddle with a giant puppy like him. Why does he look jealous?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lila ignored the covetous glare and fixed her eyes on Hir. “You were startled, weren’t you dear? Let me hug you before we go meet Lugar.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, umm… !” Hir’s blue ocean eyes trembled in bewilderment. His pink lips were also trembling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lila intentionally acted as if she was disappointed, and asked Hir with a low voice. “You don’t want it…? You don’t want my hug anymore?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh!” He seemed to react immediately. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I that talented at acting?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lila’s whining was enough to make His legs tremble while he found the right words. “Of course I’m glad, but!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But … ?” She didn’t want to be too querulous, yet she was still interested in what was going on in his adorable mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I- I don’t want to be seen as a baby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…” Lila kept her head down. It was to conceal her wide grin. Her shoulders began to shake a little from the laughing. She tried concealing her giggles with a serious face. Although he seemed to have noticed. “You don’t want to be seen as a baby?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No … I get really happy when you hug me, mother, but what if it’s too childish to be hugged, so….” Hir’s face turned scarlet red, and he put his head down just like Lila did moments ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about you give a hug to someone that wants it?” A booming voice suddenly approached Lila, yet she didn’t even bother turning to it from how transfixed she was with her lovely son. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hir please tell me how you can be so cute!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walking to the gymnasium while hugging Hir had been a failure. Instead, Lila remained content with holding the child’s hand. Their clothing bore the same colors, which made them appear even more like a mother and a son. Meanwhile, Lacias, who walked one step behind them, did not appear to be as content. He glared at the two figures holding hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacias narrowed his eyes and made up his mind. With a determined face he strode forward and blocked Lila’s way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me? What’s this?” he asked. Both Lila and Hir puzzled at Lacias’ spontaneous behaviour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lacias?” Lila questioned. Lacias, without saying a word, held up his hand to Lila. Keeping his palm outstretched, he stared at the hands clasped by mother and son. Lila understood what Lacias’ intentions were. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s acting more childish than Hir,</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">she thought. Lila couldn’t help but laugh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacias’ eyes rose to Lila’s face from the held hands he coveted. “Why are you laughing?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because it’s funny of course. You’re nagging to hold my hand like a child.”</span></p>
