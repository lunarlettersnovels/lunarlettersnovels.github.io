            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 15 – Adorable as a Puppy (1)</strong></p>
<p>Lila reached out her hand. Aiming for a handshake. But Lacias answered by holding her hand tightly.</p>
<p>“A partner you say, that’s a word I don’t really like.”</p>
<p>“Then how do you like to express it?”</p>
<p>“We are going to be married now, but it doesn’t feel like a real marriage from how cold and heartless it sounds.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Lila had a visible look of pure confusion on her face, she was beginning to wonder if he was even joking anymore. <em>What happened to his wolf personality that he had when I first entered? Now he’s acting like a gentle sheep. It’s getting hard to adapt to.</em></p>
<p>Lila didn’t know how to react because there was no situation similar to this one in the novel. She never knew that Lacias had a flimsy personality inside. Nonetheless he seemed easy to read at his current state. So easy in fact it was almost as if an imaginary tail was wagging behind him.</p>
<p>She laughed lightly at this thought.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Lacias’s smile was joined by a raised eyebrow “Why are you laughing?”</p>
<p>“Oh, excuse me.”</p>
<p>“Apologies are not needed. I was just wondering why you laughed.”</p>
<p>It seemed that he had no intention of backing down until she told him, so she was forced to respond truthfully.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. When I looked at your Highness, I remembered a puppy I had raised in the past.”</p>
<p>“A puppy?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What was its name?”</p>
<p>“Its name was Ruby.”</p>
<p>“If it’s Ruby … it was a female?”</p>
<p>Lila nodded.</p>
<p>“While you were looking at me, you thought of a female dog. What should I think of this?”</p>
<p>Lacias was beginning to worry about his own appearance in turn revealing a comical face. Lila almost chuckled again before holding herself, not wanting to start another problem.</p>
<p>“Am I lacking masculinity? I’ve never heard of that before.”</p>
<p>Lila knew that he meant ‘Are you saying I’m not attractive enough for you’. His face along with his remark had Lila not being able to hold her laugh anymore.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t saying that … You were just … like a dog.” she said vaguely, trying to contain her laughter</p>
<p>“Dog … Like a dog?”</p>
<p>“No, my mistake. You looked Like a puppy. Basically I meant that you looked… cute.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Upon returning to the mansion, the first thing Lila did was examine Hir’s room.</p>
<p>“I chose the room with the most windows.” She remembered Jane telling her as she arrived. She trusted Jane’s choice especially since she seemed to be happy to report this to her but she still wanted to make sure that the room was perfect for him.</p>
<p>The room was spacious with enough room for it to be decorated with whatever he wished and the sunlight seemed to be pouring in from every corner. Such a room was common in the Marshmell household, yet he was given a terrible room previously.</p>
<p>“How long has Hirah been sleeping?”</p>
<p>“After taking the medicine, he has been sleeping the entire time. It looks like the medicine is working well.”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness. I was worried that he would get seriously sick.”</p>
<p>“When he wakes up, I’ll prepare some chicken soup thoroughly and serve it to him. I’ll also get some hot peppermint tea ready for him to help with his fever.”</p>
<p>Lila nodded in agreement. She was glad that there was another person willing to help Hir and at the same time she felt intense relief that his fever had not gotten worse. She returned to the room where Hir lay comfortably for the first time in a long time. She stopped outside the room gazing at his unconscious smile. <em>He must be dreaming. I shouldn’t do anything to wake him up.</em></p>
<p>“You should go closer and see if the young master is okay.” Suggested Jane breaking her thought process</p>
<p>“Are … you sure I should do that?”</p>
<p>Jane smiled sweetly, she started to trust that Mrs Marshmell was no longer the person she used to be “Haha, of course you can! Now what are you waiting for, go ahead. You are his mother after all.”</p>
<p><em>Mother … me? </em>Lila couldn’t understand her own emotions. She felt that she wanted to see the child up close and give him all the care in the world, but at the same time she knew that her character did not deserve such a luxury. However, She decided to follow her powerful desire to see him upclose.</p>
<p>Lila carefully approached the sleeping boy trying hard to suppress her footsteps. She reached the bed and gently on the edge of the bed, it caused the bed to shake a little bit, luckily, it wasn’t enough to wake Hir up. After a long period of pondering over his adorable appearance she couldn’t resist stroking his wool-like hair.</p>
<p><em>So cute. His hair gets softer every time</em></p>
<p>Looking at him from that point of view Lila noticed that he resembled Lacias in a way.</p>
<p>Lacias’s eyes were a lot fiercer compared to Hir, but with Hir’s eyes closed they bore similar features. <em>How did such an enchanting child be born from the father of someone like Viscount Marshmell?</em></p>
<p>She realised that Hir’s features were very well described in the novel, as he looked exactly like she would have imagined. <em>To think that such a sweet child would later become a fearful tyrant. </em>His lovely gentle would turn into cold, heartless ones. Bringing misfortune to whoever happened to to receive them. It was most definitely not a pleasing change for her, yet her plan to make this child grow in a straight path did not change.</p>
<p>Lila pledged once again that she would never let Hir turn into a tyrant, nor let him become the excuse for misfortune. She wouldn’t be able to live with herself otherwise.</p>
