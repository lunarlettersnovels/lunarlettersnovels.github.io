            <p><strong>Chapter 104 – Like a Sister (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Mother! Ta-da … Uh, what do you think?” Back at the Marshmell Mansion, Hir was holding a surprise fashion show for Lila.</p>
<p>Jane looked proudly at her work as she helped him with his final touches. “Madam, look at him. Isn’t he so cute?”</p>
<p>Lila didn’t even know what to say. She was unbelievably happy to see Hir at all, mine as well seeing him testing on the adorable clothes Lacias sent him for their wedding day.</p>
<p><em>How can one boy be so cute?</em></p>
<p>He started by wearing a white jacket with a pink bowtie, Lila personally did not like the set when she first saw it at the store, but now that Hir was wearing it, she changed her mind instantly.</p>
<p><em>There’s nothing in this world that doesn’t suit Hir</em>.</p>
<p>“Does … it suit me?” The boy asked, backed by a little hesitation.</p>
<p>The silent response made Hir think of a reason to why she wasn’t responding. After concluding that it might have been his hair that wasn’t combed after taking a nap, he gave his mother one of his sweetest smiles.</p>
<p>“You need to brush your hair. It’s a mess.”</p>
<p><em>Argh! I knew it.</em></p>
<p>Jane quickly brought in a mirror and put it in front of him revealing a little nest of hair covering his entire forehead. He promptly covered his head with his petite hands trying desperately to cover it up. It was worse than he thought.</p>
<p>“Why … why … di- didn’t you tell me….”</p>
<p>Lila rushed to reassure him. “You still look cute, though.”</p>
<p>“But I’m still ashamed.” At those words she pulled him close and brushed his hair with her own hands. the mangled hair became more calmed down after a number of strokes.</p>
<p>She bent down to see how he looked from a similar perspective. “You look really cool now, but you still looked cute before.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Really, I was so astonished by how cute you looked, that I didn’t know what to say.”</p>
<p>His pout was instantly replaced by a deep red blush. He avoided eye contact before turning around and covering his cheeks.</p>
<p>Lila laughed quietly to herself at the cute reactions, when the sound of laughter reached Hir, His entire face resembled a ripe tomato. She held her laughter for a moment and touched him on the head again. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>A shy response came in soon after. “I’m embarrassed.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you’re covering your face?”</p>
<p>“Yes….”</p>
<p>She got back up and turned to Jane who was also grinning at Hir’s cute demeanor. She glanced back at the humiliated little boy who was turning back around, and remembered the reason for his presence after seeing the bowtie.</p>
<p>“Hir, do you like your clothes?”</p>
<p>His eyes lit up again. “Yes!”</p>
<p>“Are you comfortable?”</p>
<p>“Yes! It fits me very well. Thank you, mother.”</p>
<p>Lila shook her head. “It’s not me, it’s from Lacias.”</p>
<p>“Um … fa- … father … did?”</p>
<p>“What did you just say?”</p>
<p>“Oh, um fa … fa-” She cut him off by pulling him close once more and stroking his hair. The word father was still awkward for him to say, as Hir was only able to see him a few times.</p>
<p><em>If he comes to the Wipere mansion soon, he’ll become comfortable with the word.</em></p>
<p>“Yes, your father gave it to you. Please thank him for the gift when you see him later. He will appreciate it.”</p>
<p>“Yes! I will, of course, I will.” He stated confidently.</p>
<p>Lila hugged him tightly from how lovely she found him. “Aw, how nice and adorable you are.” After letting go, Hir quietly leaned his head against her knee with a relaxed look on his face. She couldn’t believe the moment even though she was living through it.</p>
<p>A seeking voice rapidly came and stole the moment. “Sorry to bother you two. But Hir must take his clothes off before it gets stained. Especially since it’s white”</p>
<p>Lila felt slightly irritated, but found her voice of reason. “Oh, yes, Hir, please change into comfortable clothes.”</p>
<p>Hir retracted from his mother and quickly ran to the appreciative maid. “Yes, I will.”</p>
<p>Watching her take off his white jacket, Lila silently turned and left the room.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Oh, my goodness, ma’am. What brings you here?” Jane was perplexed at the presence of</p>
<p>her master in the maid’s room</p>
<p>Lila seemed to be in a hurry. “Sorry, but I have something to give you, Jane.”</p>
<p>“To me?” Jane looked puzzled. Lila, who dragged Jane out of the maid’s room and into the parlor, sat in front of a table and gestured her to do the same</p>
<p>Jane felt a little reluctant. “Uh, I’ll bring out some tea.”</p>
<p>Lila looked grateful. “Oh, you will? thank you.”</p>
<p>Jane nodded her head and left for the kitchen. She came back shortly after with a cup of warm tea and a glass of honey water. Of course, the honey water was for Lila.</p>
<p>“I made it a bit sweeter than usual for you madam.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Jane. You are the only one who knows my taste.” While it was warm, the sweet honey scent was mixed with a pleasant scent.</p>
<p>After a sip of the sweet drink, Lila calmly placed a card on the table and pushed it to the opposite end.</p>
<p>Jane took her seat and looked closer at the envelope. “What’s this?”</p>
<p>“An invitation, open it.”</p>
