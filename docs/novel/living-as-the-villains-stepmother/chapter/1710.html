            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 82 – A Year Left (2)</strong></p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Lila scooted closer to Hir as she waited for his answer. She had always been curious about what his favorite food was and she would finally know what it is. Anticipation was churning within her when Hir opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“The cookies you make me…” Hir’s voice was soft and his ears reddened instantly like he was embarrassed. His forehead creased, thinking that he may be asking for too much.</p>
<p>Lila could see the furrow appear between his brows and she knew for a fact that Hir was beating himself up for having said such a request. “I will bake cookies for you tomorrow then.” Lila said, snapping Hir out of his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Really? Thank you!” Hir exclaimed. He placed his fork down and clapped happily in sheer excitement. He resembled a little chick that was fluttering its small wings. If the boy had been born filled with an encompassing love from his parents, he would surely welcome the idea without a second thought. However, Hir’s first reaction was of guilt, thinking that he may be troubling Lila with his request.</p>
<p>Should Hir come running up to her asking for cookies, Lila would undoubtedly bake some for him. It’s perfectly natural for a child to act like that anyway. Suddenly, the anger that she had for Viscount Marshmell and to those who had neglected him all these times simmered in her gut once again. She willed herself to calm down, facing Hir as she spoke in a calm voice.</p>
<p>“Hir, you can ask me for cookies anytime you want. I can make them for you when I’m not busy.”</p>
<p>Hir titled his head in her direction. “Really?” He was studying her face to see if she really meant it, but he shook his head sternly, not wanting to take so much of her time. “No no. You’re too busy. It’s too much.”</p>
<p>His words didn’t waver in the slightest. Lila’s mood dropped at the realization that she may not be able to convince Hir no matter how hard she tried, and she could only blame the ones who taught him to stay quiet and out of everyone’s way. Such words should not be imposed on any child and it was nothing but cruel and unnecessary. Despite knowing that his stepmother had already changed for the better, he couldn’t find it in himself to break out of the habit he was accustomed with.</p>
<p>Lila wondered if she would still be able to help him since she had so much to do in a year’s time, and it would all be over before she knew it. She wanted to pave a clear path befitting Hir as much as she could.</p>
<p>Her eyes drifted to Hir, who was waiting for her patiently before he even took a bite. She flashed him a smile, taking a spoonful of soup and placed it on her lips.</p>
<p>Hir picked his fork up and dashed right through the pile. Lila took bite after bite with her head bent down, not wanting Hir to see the sadness she felt gnawing inside her. Hir not breaking out of his shell was a thought she didn’t want to entertain, as the idea pained her too greatly.</p>
<p>Raising a child was a difficult task, and anyone who had a child of his own could attest to it. She pulled herself together, realizing that such discouraging thoughts would only pull her into a depressive state. She’d rather focus on what she could do instead of mulling over things she couldn’t control. Being optimistic in all these was easier said than done, but she needed to at least try.</p>
<p>It’s not like Hir was going astray anyway. And maybe that’s enough.</p>
<p>She planted the thought into her head in the hopes of convincing herself, even though a big part of her wanted Hir to be unapologetically himself. To act the way he wanted to without a second thought.</p>
<p>Lila and Hir went to the playroom with a steaming cup of hot chocolate in one hand. It was the room Lila had instructed to be made for Hir. It was not filled with toys like a typical playroom, but it had a wide and plush carpet stretched on the floor with a burning fireplace placed on a wall. It was Lila’s first time to see the place since it was only finished quite recently.</p>
<p>Hir smiled from ear to ear. Lila saw how visibly excited he was to show her the room.  “Hir, do you like this room?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s amazing!” Hir replied in a singsong voice.</p>
<p>“Really?” Lila’s mood brightened instantly, influenced by Hir’s sheer enthusiasm. The sullenness she felt earlier disappeared as a pleased smile bloomed on her face.</p>
<p>“I’ve only gone inside once, and the space is huge and it has a lot of books!” Hir chirped happily.</p>
<p>Lila had Jane promise to line the bookshelf with numerous books and volumes, and she’s glad that Jane had kept her word.</p>
<p>She was reminded of Hir’s words earlier, that he welcomed her back upon learning it from a book. Hir’s adorable face as he waited for her was etched into her memory, and from then on she wanted to do anything and everything for him. Good thing the playroom was near her own quarters so she could go in and out the place easily.</p>
<p><em>There’s not much time left, however.</em></p>
