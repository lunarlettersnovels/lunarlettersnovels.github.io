            <p><strong>Chapter 175 – Time Together</strong></p>
<p>Soon after the newlyweds left the lounge and were heading back to the hall. Lila couldn’t remember exactly how long they stayed after Lacias’s return, a mix of emotions always caused her to lose track of time when she was with him.</p>
<p>When she saw something beautiful, ate something delicious, no matter what she was doing, Lacias came to her mind. Every time she thought about him, she felt the time passing faster, it was almost like a cheat to life.</p>
<p>“Thanks for bringing me to the lounge. I definitely feel a lot more refreshed now.” Mentioned Lila gratefully.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. I’m thankful that you came with me.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know I was tired, but I guess I needed a break.”</p>
<p>Lacias flashed her a slightly victorious smile. “See? I told you. I can tell what you need just by looking at your face, Lila.”</p>
<p>Like a big puppy waiting for praise, his eyes started twinkling. Lila, who noticed right away, smiled and tried to stroke his hair.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She stretched her arm as far as she could, but Lila was still a head shorter than her goal. He was way too tall for her.</p>
<p>“You’re too tall,” says Lila in a matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p>“Oh no. Wait.” Lacias hurriedly lowers his head and seemingly bows to her. Lacias was much taller than the average height of a man, so this was the only way for her to reach his head.</p>
<p>“Haha.” How Lacias hurriedly bent over his body for her touch appeared funny and cute in Lila’s eyes.</p>
<p><em>I want to tease him, should I?</em></p>
<p>Lila finally understood why some naughty boys would play pranks on girls they liked when they were young. For some reason, she wanted to get the same reaction out of Lacias.</p>
<p>“……Lila?”</p>
<p>Lila returns from her mind and just finds Lacias still waiting for her stroke obediently.</p>
<p>The way he looked up at her with his innocent eyes was somehow irresistibly attractive. She even felt like she was slowly being captivated by him.</p>
<p><em>Wait, people might think we’re weird if they see us.</em></p>
<p>Lila was suddenly worried that if anyone happened to see Lacias bowing in front of Lila, strange rumors would circulate among the nobles.</p>
<p>She hurriedly looked around and felt relieved to find only a few servants roaming around the hallway near the lounge not noticing them.</p>
<p><em>If I keep acting incautiously like this, I will not be in a position to discipline anyone. This lounge is not just for the two of us. In public places, I have to be more careful about everything I do.</em></p>
<p><em>But since there’s no one around here for now… Sometimes, I have to live my life doing what I want to do.</em></p>
<p>With that, Lila smiled and stroked Lacias’ patient head. His hair was soft and pleasant to touch.</p>
<p>“I like it.”</p>
<p>“You do?” She felt a sense of distance between Lacias in the original novel and the Lacias in front of her.</p>
<p><em>I mean, he always acted like a loving dog waving his tail to win my favor. He was a completely different person from then on.</em></p>
<p>And it was the same with Hir. The fact that her intervention brought a positive effect on them lifted her mood.</p>
<p>She was indescribably happy that the two people she loved the most were changing because of her.</p>
<p>Just as she started getting lost in happy thoughts, a young boy came running to her from the end of the hallway.</p>
<p>“Mother!”</p>
<p>“Hir!” Shouts Lila enthusiastically, instantly retracting her head from Lacias.</p>
<p>He looked much brighter from when he left to play on the swing with Hizette.</p>
<p><em>He must have gotten exhausted from being stuck in the same place for too long. I’m glad that the swing made him feel better.</em></p>
<p>Seeing Hir’s excited demeanor, Lila’s face also brightened. Her smile was wider than any other smile throughout the day.</p>
<p>“I still have a long way to go,” noted Lacias, who was silently studying the two being reunited after what seemed like ages. He was particularly watching Lila’s smile which made her retract it a little bit from embarrassment.</p>
<p>While asking Hir about his time at the swing something caught Lila’s attention out of the blue.</p>
<p><em>I think I heard a voice.</em></p>
<p>She turned around and asked Lacias if he heard something, but he just smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Let’s return to the hall now,” says Lila with a bit of suspicion.</p>
<p>They ended up staying in the lounge much longer than they thought. Since the party was already in full swing. There must have been quite a few people looking for the Duke and his bride.</p>
<p>“I’m worried that Hir is tired,” whispered Lila while glancing at Hir, who was following them with Hizette from behind. Lacias, who studied Hir’s face for a while, put on a sweet smile again.</p>
<p>“From what I’ve heard, Hir is in pretty good shape. I don’t think he’s tired yet.”</p>
<p>She still didn’t know the real reason why he went to play on the swing, but she couldn’t ask him about it now.</p>
<p>Lacias had the urge to brush through her long, fine hair, just as Lila did to him. It was clear from how he clenched and unclenched his fists repeatedly.</p>
<p>Growing up, Lacias always thought that controlling his impulse was one of his easiest traits. He thought he could simply suppress his urge by just getting rid of the thoughts that bothered him. But when it came to Lila, it was different. His sight, hearing, smell, touch, everything stimulated him.</p>
<p>But he had to hold back. And make his smile even brighter.</p>
