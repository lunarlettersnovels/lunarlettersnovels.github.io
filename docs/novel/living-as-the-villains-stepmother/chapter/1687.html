            <p><strong>Chapter 105 – Like a Sister (2)</strong></p>
<p>Jane’s eyes widened exponentially as she slowly pulled out the card. At the very end she covered her gasp with shaking hands.</p>
<p>“Why do you want me to-”</p>
<p>“Because I want to invite you.” Lila seemed to expect the reaction.</p>
<p>“But I-I’m-” Words failed to form in her mouth at the sight of the card before her. It was an invitation to Lila’s own wedding, which meant that she would be invited as a formal guest rather than a maid.</p>
<p>Tears were apparent at the edge of Jane’s eyes as she took another deep breath. “How could I go to such a place? I’ll only take your heart with thanks.”</p>
<p>“No, I really want you to come. You made me feel like your sister recently. I think it’s normal for a sister to come to her sister’s wedding, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Jane wiped her face with a nearby handkerchief as a tear trickled down her face. “But how dare I…,” she said, with a muffled voice.</p>
<p>Lila knew Jane would keep trying to reject her offer, but she already had an offer ready for this situation.</p>
<p>“Jane, you are the only one who can take care of Hir on the wedding day.”</p>
<p>“Hmm….” Lila could hear some interest in her faint voice</p>
<p>“You’re the perfect person for him. Besides, I need you too. Oh and of course you know I’m not talking about my wedding dress, we have the maids in Wipere for that.”</p>
<p>Jane, who hesitated for a while with tear marks all over her face, eventually nodded.</p>
<p><em>Thank goodness.</em></p>
<p>If Jane kept refusing, there was no other way for Lila to bring her. Fortunately she was not bad at persuasion.</p>
<p>Lila looked the other way, preparing for her next topic with the maid. Naturally, on the day she moved to the Lacias’ mansion, most of the Marshmell Mansion employees terminated their contract, leaving for another source of income. Lila wrote every one of them a letter of recommendation with a generous severance pay to help them find a job again. She encouraged all of them to find new jobs, except for Jane.</p>
<p><em>I thought Jane would ask first.</em></p>
<p>There was no need to bring a new maid to the Wipere mansion, but Lila really wanted to take Jane with her. In the original story, Jane was the only person Hir had a connection to in the Marshmell Mansion, Lila simply wanted to repay her for helping Hir. Not to mention her being a genuinely great person to have around.</p>
<p>Lila only trusted Jane out of the entire staff to take care of Hir and she wanted to keep it that way. She pulled out another piece of paper, but this time it was a contract.</p>
<p>She was still wiping away her tears when she noticed another paper on the table. “What’s this, ma’am?”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you separated from the original maids? Do you miss them?”</p>
<p>“Well, you meet new people by saying farewells … But what is it?” Jane asked, incredulous.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? It’s a contract.”</p>
<p>She momentarily stopped cleaning her face. “For … me?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” Lila exclaimed before grinning and taking another sip of her honey water.</p>
<p>This time the trembling was clear in Jane’s hands as she read the contract. Lila could almost feel the table shaking.</p>
<p>“Oh, and I don’t want you to refuse this one.” She added.</p>
<p>“…Madam.” Her face was still covered by the paper in hand.</p>
<p>“I’ll treat you like the best in the industry, so come with me, Jane.”</p>
<p>Lila knew better than to offer her an exclusive maid contract to the Wipere Family, she would certainly have been harassed, not to mention how difficult it was to get a promotion.</p>
<p><em>I can’t bring Jane as an ordinary maid. It wouldn’t be fair.</em></p>
<p>In Lila’s new contract, Jane was requested to be Lila’s personal assistant as well as Hir’s nanny. Compared to how her career was now, it would be the greatest upgrade in her entire life. It even included a clause that the terms of the contract could be negotiated every year, and that the salary would be measured at the highest level. It was a very unfavorable contract for Lila, but she didn’t mind.</p>
<p><em>Hir will continue the contract even in my absence, I’m sure.</em></p>
<p>Lila could tell from Hir’s eyes how much he cared about Jane. He only gave that look to a few people in his life. Jane was a necessity for Hir. And that means she was essential to herself as well, such an important person could never be left behind.</p>
<p>“Tell me if there’s a clause you don’t like. I’ll fix it here and now. Everything in your favor, of course.” Lila held out the pen that she brought with her. The feathers at the end of the pen shook gently.</p>
<p>She finally held the contract down and her eyes were bursting with tears. “I … I can’t be treated like this … The salary I got as a maid was enough! I’m sure there’s less work to do at the mansion.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care if there’s less work to do. I appreciate your ability and I will set your salary upon that.”</p>
<p>“Really … madam … you are … just-” Jane glanced at the contract with trembling eyes. A contract that was way too good to be true. She glanced back and caught Lila’s eyes gazing affectionately at her, and only one thought was apparent at that moment.</p>
<p><em>How could one woman turn out to be so generous?</em></p>
