            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 13 – A Prosperous Proposal (1)</strong></p>
<p>This response came to Lila as a sign that she was on a good path, it was the first she got a positive reply from him. Not sure where to stop, she pushed her luck a little further.</p>
<p>“And one more thing. The diamond mine that was handed over to Dawson Hiln, I can get it back for you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, and how do you plan on doing that?” Said Lacias widening his charming smile even further while continuing his reply “I hate gambling. It’s what a pathetic bunch of guys who want to bet on something they’re not sure about, do. It’s not my style to walk on luck.”</p>
<p>His tone was one of determination. Lila realized that if she didn’t disclose her cards now, the deal wouldn’t be made.</p>
<p>“Actually, I already know who the spy is. If you know for sure where the rat goes, it’s clear where to put the trap.”</p>
<p>“Ha, go on.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you rat traps as well as the rat poison. So no rat will ever bother you again.”</p>
<p>Lila’s confident manner intrigued Lacias. He had an amused look on his handsome face. For the first time he began to see a woman in a new light. She resembled a tiger dressed in a gentle and lovely coat.</p>
<p>“When you completely shut down the information leakage, the spy will have to burn the evidence. He’ll be in a hurry and that would be his downfall. Because then he’ll be easier to spot.” Naturally, a spy, whose identity was known, would be rendered devoid of life.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with the diamond mine?”</p>
<p>After hearing this question, Lila confidently brought up the items she was holding and laid them on the table. With a satisfying sigh she opened all the documents which were placed for Lacias to. The luxurious table lost it’s vivid color from the amount of paper on it. Though the importance of the papers were clear, they seemed to have the hard-work and handwriting of a smart mind, Lila. Even though the content looked clear Lacias asked anyways with a slight raise in his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“What is all this?”</p>
<p>“The identity of the spy, the people he interacted with, the information he passed on, the information that will soon be passed on, the weakness of the Hiln family, the information that will bring back the mine. I wrote it all down here.”</p>
<p>“Wow!” A reaction was necessary after all this information. But nevertheless he couldn’t help being surprised. He wasn’t a man that was surprised very easily, but he couldn’t get himself to know how she got all this information. The data was recent too, since the ink still looked fresh and had still not dried up. <em>Hmm must have been written today. </em>He thought with an intriguing smile.</p>
<p>“Sinior Hiln. She’ll be our player.”</p>
<p>“Sinior, eh.”</p>
<p>She was second in the Hiln family and full of ambition, enough to become the next successor, but she kept losing to the first, Dawson.</p>
<p>“The Marquis of Hiln will die in a year.”</p>
<p>“What?” Lacias’ eyebrows raised even higher. Her remarks were supposed to be thrown into an iron cage in contempt at any moment and he could have easily sent her the same way. Instead he just laughed it off.</p>
<p>“That’s quite the big statement.”</p>
<p>However, what she said wasn’t far from the truth. The Marquis of Hiln was not appearing in any noble ceremonies, with a preposterous excuse every time. Lacias, too, knew that the Marquis’ days were numbered.</p>
<p>“In a year, Hiln’s successor will be decided. Dawson is a strong candidate, but he can’t do business with us.”</p>
<p>There was nothing to be desired from a deal made with him.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of making a deal with Sinior and getting the mine back. You already know that their relationship is bad, right?”</p>
<p>Lacias nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“What she wants is to beat Dawson and become the successor.” She continued.</p>
<p>“Yes, so what’s the way to persuade Sinior?”</p>
<p>“Hiln recently began trading with the Colossus of the Nixon Kingdom. But they’re having trouble with the path because it’s uncomfortable. The food they export will soon rot from the scorching heat of the sun. But what if they cut through with a sea line that leads directly to the harbor?”</p>
<p>Lila raised one corner of her mouth to give a wry smile.</p>
<p>“There will be a surge in supply, of course.” She knew that she had him here.</p>
<p>“That’s a good idea. Their Mana Stone will also be available for distribution.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. Sinior will solidify her position in Hiln. I’m sure she’ll take this deal for sure.”</p>
<p>It was a plan that did not have Sinior involved directly, it was the perfect plan when written on paper. Almost too perfect. Lacias began to doubt her honesty. How could she have all this high-end information, she even had the drama between the family members. Even elite spies couldn’t obtain information this deep. With all this in mind, Lacias knew that he most certainly wanted this person to be in his hierarchy.</p>
<p>“Is that all?”</p>
<p>“Yes. For now.”</p>
<p>Lacias laughed close to hysterically, as he put down the plans. As the head of Weifel, who was at the peak of his power, he was someone that put pressure on others. Not the other way around.</p>
<p>“You think I’m going to accept your offer … so you came clean with your plans do you think I’m obliged to do what you want now?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I think you’re too naive.”</p>
