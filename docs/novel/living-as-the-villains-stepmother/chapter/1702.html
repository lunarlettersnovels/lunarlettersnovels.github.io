            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 90 – Romantic Man (2)</strong></p>
<p>Lila pointed at Hir’s swing. He was surprised but found himself nodding just the same. How could he not when Lila suggested it so sincerely? They walked over to where the swing was and he knew from one glance alone that he would not fit. The swing was intended for the likes of Hir. He touched the swing’s support and gently shook it to see if it’s secured properly and turned to Lila. “What if it breaks?”</p>
<p>“It won’t.” Lila said in a confident tone.</p>
<p>Lacias chuckled. “I think it will, actually.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll make another one.” Lila adamantly replied. It seemed like she was determined in seeing Lacias perched on the swing.</p>
<p>“Well, if you say so…” Lila’s insistence finally paid off, but he was still doubtful whether the swing could hold him or not. He threw Lila another glance, prompting her to tap her fist against her chest as if to say he should trust her.</p>
<p>“You have to catch me if it breaks, okay.” Lacias mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>“I’ll pull you by the back when you fall.”</p>
<p>Lacias smiled at how comfortable they were with each other. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt this content, and Lila unknowingly soothed his troubled mind just by her mere presence. He did not want to let this feeling slip away. He tore his gaze from hers to prevent her from seeing how at ease he felt being with her, and obediently sat on the swing.</p>
<p>The ropes that supported the swing went taut under Lacias’ weight, but it did not break the way he expected it to. Lila on the other hand was certain that the swing would be alright, since it had been really stable when Hir sat on it in the original work. Having it reinforced by herself also gave her an assurance of its durability and strength.</p>
<p>“I’ll push you.” Lila said and situated herself behind him.</p>
<p>Lacias looked over his shoulder. “Would you be able to?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>However, the thought of Lila being the one to do the pushing didn’t sit well with him. “How about I push you instead?”</p>
<p>Lila shook her head firmly. “No.”</p>
<p>Seeing that he couldn’t convince her otherwise, Lacias relented to her wishes. “All right.”</p>
<p>“Stay still.” Lila placed her palms against his back. She began pushing him when the sight of Lacias’ back made her think of Hir. He, too, would have the same build just like Lacias’ once he grew up.</p>
<p>“Lila, this won’t work.” Lacias said.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“My legs are too long, see?” Lacias stretched his feet to prove his point. It was directly stamped on the ground with no space for his legs to swing freely. It was the main reason why Lila felt some resistance when she pushed him. She looked at the ground in disappointment, urging Lacias to stand up and he gently pushed her down to sit on the swing.</p>
<p>“The swing fits you perfectly, see?” He assuaged, but Lila remained unresponsive.</p>
<p>“And this is where I should be.” Lacias took his place behind her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lila could feel how fast her heart was beating, making her close her lips as she tried to stop her hands from trembling, tightly holding onto the swing ropes either side of her. “Well, push me as hard you can.” She said shakily.</p>
<p>The fear she felt dwindled for a fraction. Lacias’ eyes swept to Lila’s slim form, and it appeared like it would break at a mere touch. This thought settled on the front of his mind as Lila’s hair was blown swiftly by the wind. He had never felt such a magnitude of emotions stir inside him that he remained unmoving on his spot.</p>
<p>“Lacias.”</p>
<p>Lacias blinked, as if coming back to his senses. “Yes?”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>He was too deep in his thoughts that he didn’t realize that he was still as a statue.</p>
<p>“I won’t be hurt, don’t worry.” Lila said, sensing his worries even though he was standing behind her.</p>
<p>“Sorry.” Lacias pushed her with barely enough force, the swing going back and forth at a low height. Lila felt happy as the soft breeze caressed her cheeks, reminding her of the time when used to ride swings back when she was a young child.</p>
<p>“Are you enjoying yourself?” Lacias asked.</p>
<p>Lila nodded. “It’s a nice feeling.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear.”</p>
<p>“Can you push me a lot harder?” Lila spoke over the gush of wind.</p>
<p>“No. It’s too dangerous.” His tone was firm, intensely overprotective that was so unlike him in the original work. Despite Lila’s pleading, he remained unfaltering in his decision and only shook his head in response.</p>
<p>Realizing that he wouldn’t give in to her request, she decided to bask in the feeling as the swing went up and down slowly. She didn’t think she would be able to ride one ever again.</p>
<p>Lacias stopped pushing altogether as the swing ceased to a halt. He wrapped his arms behind her and rested his chin on her shoulder. “I can’t push you hard like you wanted me to, especially when I can see how scared you were.”</p>
<p>“Was it that obvious?”</p>
<p>“It is.” Lacias ran his fingers through her hair. “How scared were you being on the swing?”</p>
<p>“I’m not really scared…” Lila responded unconvincingly, and Lacias remembered how much her hands shook when it was clenching on the ropes.</p>
<p>“Why are you scared of swings?” He asked again, this time in a soft voice.</p>
<p>“Uh…” Lila muttered and closed her eyes, remembering the events that transpired during her childhood. Her past life’s memories onslaughting her. Being in Lacias’ warm embrace comforted her greatly.</p>
<p>“My father was not a good man.” Lila started, feeling Lacias stiffen at her words. He looked at the side of her face and waited for her to go on. “I remembered that when I was young, I was playing with some friends at a playground when he came looking for me. When he saw me, he dragged me away by pulling me by the hair. I’m not really afraid of swings. It feels really nice.”</p>
<p>Lacias rubbed her back soothingly. She thought she could say this much, since the rest of Madame Marshmell’s family had died due to causes unknown to her. Lacias’ face was stern as a rock, but his hands were nothing short of gentle and warm. He had a cold expression on his face as his mind reeled on how he would handle her father.</p>
