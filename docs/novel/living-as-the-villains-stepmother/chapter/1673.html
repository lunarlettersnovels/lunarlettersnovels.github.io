            <p><strong>Chapter 119 – Uninvited Guest (1)</strong></p>
<p>Lila could get used to Lacias’ flattering words. She placed her hand on his arm. Thankfully, her face did not flush easily or else her embarrassment would have been difficult to conceal. The arm she clung to was hard and muscular.</p>
<p>When Lila and Lacias entered the hall with locked arms, everyone noticed the couple. Lila could not get used to the stares. The glares of judgement and hostile evaluation, directed towards her, gave her chills. They were not respecting her as another human being. For Lacias, it differed. The people stared at him in awe. The discrimination between the two of them was rampant, even though the two affectionately entered together. If it hadn’t been for her, Lacias would not have even come to the party.</p>
<p>Wipere’s presence altered the atmosphere of the event. Many of the patrons were shocked to learn that Senior Hiln was acquainted with the Wipere family.</p>
<p>Senior grinned proudly, as if she also read the public’s mind. “Your Highness, I did not expect to greet you at such a party.”</p>
<p>The first person to approach Lacias was Count Hiln, the father of Dawson and Senior. Lacias could not believe that the man was physically present at his daughter’s party.</p>
<p>Lila let go of Lacias’ arm and whispered in his ear. “I’ll go to Senior, and you can greet Count Hiln.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go together?” Lacias wore a sullen face, clearly not fond of Lila’s idea.</p>
<p>Lila decided to command rather than suggest. “I’ll be waiting. Take your time.”</p>
<p>When Lila ignored his complaints, Lacias murmured to himself and gave up. After briefly greeting Count Hiln, Lila approached the party’s honoured guest. “Hello, Senior,” she greeted.</p>
<p>“Lila! Did you see? You did, didn’t you? How everyone was looking at me! It was nerve-wracking. My face was trembling.”</p>
<p>“You did well. Good thing you practiced,” Lila assured the girl.</p>
<p>“Definitely. I thought about Dawson every night. I almost vomited several times.”</p>
<p>Even though they were talking about Dawson Hiln, Senior looked more comfortable than before. She had a long way to go, but she was improving dramatically.</p>
<p><em>Senior is definitely a better choice than the Hiln’s estate falling into Dawson’s control</em>, Lila thought. Not just because of the mines, but it would also be beneficial for Senior when the Wiperes made deals with the Hilns in the future. Hir would face a better future, as well.</p>
<p>Senior’s eyes glistened. A few people nearby were eager to talk to her. They were longing for Lila to walk away so they could approach Senior.</p>
<p>“Once the Duke of Wipere shares greetings with Hiln, he will approach you next,” Lila informed the girl.</p>
<p>“Really?” Senior was shocked.</p>
<p>“Of course. It’s your party, Senior.”</p>
<p>Senior’s face brightened. If the Duke of Wipere was to support her… “Dawson must be extremely annoyed. To be honest, I’m so elated I could jump up and down right this moment.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear. I’m glad you feel like you’re being compensated for the hardships you went through.” Lila smiled.</p>
<p>“I can definitely do this. Especially if I can see Dawson cringing!”</p>
<p>“Is Dawson not here?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>Lila looked around. Dawson Hiln was nowhere to be seen. <em>If I were him, I would have definitely come to spy</em>, she thought.</p>
<p>“He will be here soon,” Senior informed her.</p>
<p><em>In that case, I must try speaking to Dawson</em>, Lila thought to herself. She had never shared a conversation with Dawson. She needed to get to know him better. She had to understand and analyze her enemy, to increase her chance of winning a fight.</p>
<p>“By the way, it’s so crowded here.” Senior looked around, still wide-eyed at the spectacle.</p>
<p>“Still getting used to the party?” Lila chuckled.</p>
<p>“Yes. But thanks to Miss Nepeli, everything has been proceeding smoothly. I should thank her.”</p>
<p>“It looks like Edith is busy right now,” Lila pointed. Being a well-mannered and quick-witted extrovert, Edith had been surrounded by individuals of authority, who were desperate to share a conversation. From time to time, she chuckled and smiled, as if she was secretly up to something. The woman impressed Lila.</p>
<p>“Now, shall we join the battlefield?” Lila asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“There are too many guests looking for you to be saying that, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Guests for me?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>“The Duke has arrived,” Senior whispered. Lila elevated her eyebrows in disbelief and turned around. Just as Senior stated, behind her stood Lacias.</p>
<p><em>Why is he back from speaking to the Count already? </em>She was positive that Lacias had left the meeting in anger. Count Hiln would not have dismissed Lacias so early otherwise. Lila could vividly imagine the scene in her head: Lacias ending the conversation suddenly and storming back to the party. She almost shook her head in frustration, but suppressed the action in front of Senior. <em>Will he ever be obedient?</em> she wondered. Not the most appropriate thing to say to a grown man, but it was all she could think of.</p>
<p>Lila smiled at Lacias, who looked startled as if he expected a different reaction.</p>
<p>“You’re early,” she stated. Unlike her facial expression, her voice was cold.</p>
<p>“I told you I’d be coming back soon.” Lacias looked more discouraged than usual.</p>
<p>“But this is too soon. You didn’t just say hello and leave, did you?”</p>
<p>“In fact, I did. There was nothing to talk about. I only enjoy talking to <em>you</em>.” Lila was embarrassed to see Senior, who silently listened to their exchange, cringe at what Lacias said.</p>
<p>She hastily changed the topic. “Why don’t you say hello to our special lady?”</p>
<p>Lila took a step backward to encourage Lacias to greet Senior. Senior smiled, anticipating a hello, but Lacias continued to stare at Lila.</p>
