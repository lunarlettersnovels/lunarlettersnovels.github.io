            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 17 – Another Man</strong></p>
<p>The tension seemed to be growing at an alarming rate, Lila sat calmly opposite of her mother-in-law, regretting that she let her in. She sat in silence pouring tea into her guest’s cup. seeing that she was in the lead Fasha let out a quick remark.</p>
<p>“Your face looks so smooth, it seems like you’ve been doing well lately?” She said alternating between looking at the mansion and Lila.</p>
<p>The deep hatred emitting from her wrinkled eyes were easily readable. She didn’t even bother to hide her disgust. She arrogantly lifted the teacup offered to her while locking eyes with Lila.</p>
<p>“I should have brought a small bucket.”</p>
<p>Lila knew that this was her way of Indirectly saying: ‘Seeing your face makes me want to vomit.’</p>
<p>“Would you like me to bring you one?” Lila replied calmly.</p>
<p>“Tsk, how could someone with low birth standards such as you understand what I want?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t need it, then never mind.” Lila tapped her tea-filled cup with the tip of her fingernails and noticed the glimmer in the eagle eyes watching her as she did so. Fasha immediately sent out her sharp words with satisfaction, as if she’d finally caught Lila in a trap.</p>
<p>“It looks like you still can’t even hide your vulgar form from me. You’ve been in this magnificent house for so long now and yet you haven’t even learned your etiquettes properly. I shouldn’t have accepted such a low born in the first place.”</p>
<p>Lila very much expected Fasha to just rant on about her view of imperfection. Since this was exactly how it played out in her mind Lila took in the sharp words unwaverdly.</p>
<p>“A widow should be wearing a black dress, did something exciting happen? What are you wearing?”</p>
<p>Lila didn’t want to bother explaining to her how she had just returned from visiting Lacias’s mansion so she wore a colored dress. But Fasha seemed to pick up to a certain extent.</p>
<p>“My son hasn’t even been dead for that long, did you already go and find yourself another man?”</p>
<p>Lila sat up straight and pushed her teacup towards the side of the table. Trying to patiently listen to Fasha’s ramble.</p>
<p>“That’s why I didn’t want to accept a low-born who lived in a corner.”</p>
<p>Lila was taken a little off guard by her last few words. <em>What? Lived in a corner? Haven’t those words been used to describe her before? Was she referring to herself?</em></p>
<p>Fasha Marshmell was not actually in the arrogant position that she portrayed. The phrase that she labelled her daughter-in-law with was once used against her before she was married to an aristocrat. It made her grow very sensitive to being called a commoner or low-born, so she tried to find courage in being classy herself and marking others with the low-born mark. Being that careful of class for so long, she desired none other than the same level of class for her son’s wife.</p>
<p>Naturally when her son brought a commoner as a new wife she was completely against it. However, with his constant insistence she eventually came to terms with her son to make her a woman of true class and allowed him to get married.</p>
<p>“Promiscuous. Why must the lowly ones always be so promiscuous. You really should know your place better.”</p>
<p>Lila returned back to her cautious state and once again took no notice of Fasha’s wounding words. She came to the conclusion that Fasha was not referring to herself but the past Mrs. Marshmell. Lila was only able to take her words because The lines that came out of her were no different from the phrases she was called by her parents back in the childhood of her previous life.</p>
<p>“And how do you know that I am going to have a relationship with another man?” Asked picking only what she was interested in.</p>
<p>She was trying to think of ways on how the story of her getting married to Lacias had reached the ears of others so quickly when she realized that she had made a grave mistake.</p>
<p>“What … how? What are you saying now?” Fasha’s reaction was one of hearing sizable news for the first time. Like she heard something that she wasn’t meant to hear.</p>
<p>“So … you are saying that you really do have a relationship with another man? Right after my son’s death?!”</p>
