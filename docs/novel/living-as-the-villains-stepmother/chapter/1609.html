            <p><strong>Chapter 183 – Wedding Day Torture (2)</strong></p>
<p>“So tell me. How loyal are you to your master? Isn’t it a relationship formed by a few pennies?” Lacias was asking a little faster than usual.</p>
<p>As a person who worked with Lacias for a very long time, Lugar instantly noticed the difference in his tone and was slightly surprised.</p>
<p>At the same time, the temperature inside the dark basement turned freezing. Even though there was no room for cold wind to enter from, they could feel the drastic drop in warmth.</p>
<p>The man began to tremble, even more, it looked like he was on the verge of getting frostbite. Lacias concluded that it would be much easier to get things done quickly rather than letting the time pass.</p>
<p>He lifted his body, leaning against the cold wall. Under his ceremonial attire, he was wearing a hard piece of protective gear over his shoulder just in case of an attack.</p>
<p>The hard protective gear collided with the stone wall, causing an unpleasant noise. The man instinctively cowered in fear.</p>
<p>“I- I… would, never….”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I want to hear.” Lacias stepped in. “Don’t you know that?”</p>
<p>Lugar backed off for his master, as much as he wanted to continue, he couldn’t get in the way of a man getting married.</p>
<p>“It’s funny how you’re trembling but refuse to answer my question.”</p>
<p>“…Ee, eee.”</p>
<p>Lacias raised the corners of his mouth, but his eyes looked sharper than glaciers. The man’s blood ran cold. “After all, we can’t solve a problem with words alone.”</p>
<p>“I guess I was acting a little different from who I actually am,” said Lacias in a determined tone, he seems to have made up his mind about something.</p>
<p>As soon as he finished his words, rings began appearing out of thin air, the dark blue glow, boosting their presence.</p>
<p>“I thought of creating just one, but I’m worried about the person waiting for me so I added one. I tried to be merciful at first. All I asked of you was to answer my question, but you blew the chance yourself. You’ll have to pay the price for making me overturn that decision, so I’ll add one more.”</p>
<p>Three rings emitting a dark blue light circled Lacias. It was a color that seemed to have been created by pure darkness rather than a flash of brilliance.</p>
<p><em>He’s angry. </em>Thought Lugar.</p>
<p>Lugar knew that a single ring would be enough to induce a confession from the man. He thought Lacias would know that better than anyone but Lugar trusted his judgment.</p>
<p><em>It looks like he really wants to bring this to get this over with.</em></p>
<p>When a ring is sent into a person’s body it gets absorbed and damages the victim’s internal organs. A single ring is enough to cause unimaginable pain that an ordinary human could never handle.</p>
<p><em>But he summoned three… Of course, my three and master’s three are completely different.</em></p>
<p>The number of rings that could be summoned differed depending on the user’s ability. So Lugar always avoided summoning many rings to save them in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>Unlike Lugar, Lacias was able to pull out an almost limitless number of rings. For this reason, creating three rings was no sweat for Lacias.</p>
<p>“Take it easy, master…  he might pass out.” Despite knowing that his master was aware of this, Lugar decided to remind him just in case. But as expected, Lacias ignored him.</p>
<p>His rings were getting darker and darker as if they were not absorbing a single spoonful of light. The black ring turned towards the man crawling on the floor.</p>
<p><em><strong>Whoosh!</strong></em></p>
<p>The rings flew through the air at high speeds, splitting the wind in their wake. The dim, ominous rings penetrated the man’s skin in an instant, and he began frantically feeling their points of entry to check for wounds.</p>
<p>For a moment, the room was quiet, nothing happened and the man laid on the ground without a peep, but the moment was cut short by a blood-curdling shriek from him.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaahh!”</p>
<p>“I wonder if the soundproofing is good,” said Lugar, as if this was the usual afternoon for him.</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>Even when the man was struggling in pain before their eyes, Lacias and Lugar remained very calm. While they were having a short chat, the man collapsed.</p>
<p>Lugar looked down at the slumped figure. “Looks like he passed out….”</p>
<p>Lacias lifted the man’s chin with his shoes and checked his condition. “For sure.”</p>
<p>The man could not overcome the pain and eventually lost consciousness. When Lacias once again put a ring through the man’s body, he opened his eyes and groaned.</p>
<p>Since it was a ring with a lower intensity, the man didn’t faint this time but only convulsed.</p>
<p>“Are you ready to speak now?”</p>
<p>He responded with a faint groan before Lacias prepared another ring.</p>
<p>“I guess you’re not.”</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Lacias aimed the ring at the man’s head making him curl into a fetal position and blurt out his secret.</p>
<p>“B- Bl- Blake! It’s the Blake family who employed me. Please, let me go. Please! I’ll confess everything! I won’t leave a single thing out!” The man put his hands together and begged for mercy.</p>
<p>Lacias said as he looked down at the man the way one would look at a pile of trash. “You should’ve said that sooner. You wasted my time.”</p>
