            <p><strong>Chapter 154 – Too Much</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps because it was a design that he had already made once before, the craftsman finished Hir’s necklace in a small amount of time. She knew that the two necklaces looked similar in their lines, for that’s what she asked for.</p>
<p>Lila had the same feeling she had when she received it as a gift from Lacias because her white ring started waving inside. She also thought it was cool that her ring had a different color from that of Lacias, as it created a different mood.</p>
<p>“I hope Hir likes it.”</p>
<p>“Of course, he will! Who can dislike such a beautiful gift?” Jane stared at the necklace that had Lila’s ring floating inside with curious eyes.</p>
<p>The one that Lila wore all the time was also pretty, but this one appeared like a snowstorm which was also very unique in its own way. She thought it was even more special since it didn’t snow anywhere in the empire.</p>
<p>“When are you going to give it to him?”</p>
<p>“I’m planning to give it to him right away. I will visit Hir as soon as he finishes his swordsmanship practice.”</p>
<p>Jane couldn’t hold back her smile. “I think that’s a very good idea.”</p>
<p>As Lila expected, Hir was currently training for ring control and swordsmanship. However, she also expected him to manifest his ring by now, which she still didn’t hear news of. But it was true that he took time to manifest it in the original novel so she couldn’t be impatient about it.</p>
<p>“I think it’s about to end.” Jane’s voice sounded through her mind, stopping Lila’s train of thought. “Shouldn’t you be heading there now?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, it’s already time.”</p>
<p>She seemed to have been too caught up thinking about Hir, as she still had a mountain of invitation cards left to write. Lila had to handwrite the cards herself with her signature to show respect to the upper-class noble etiquette. The Duchess Camerline was also going through a very busy time with Lila.</p>
<p><em>Should I give a present to her since she helped me a lot?</em></p>
<p>Lila was planning to get a necklace for Lacias, but she forgot about Camerline. She would have to give Camerlin a gift to show her gratitude for the wedding, yet she never thought about it because Camerline told her to always receive from her and not give.</p>
<p>She eventually decided to get Camerline a gift as well, after all, she had to show appreciation to everyone while she still can, or else she might regret it in the future</p>
<p>“I think I should go to Hir now.”</p>
<p>Jane nodded in agreement. “Yes. He’s probably waiting for you already.”</p>
<p>“He is?”</p>
<p>“Because I’ve told him a few times… that you miss him a lot and that you want to see him. Ever since then, he started looking forward to seeing me more.”</p>
<p>Lila felt even more sympathetic towards her stepson. “Oh no, so Hir’s been waiting for me.”</p>
<p>Before the necklace was finished, Lila paid Hir a short visit to spend time with him. They shared a friendly conversation and had a great time together but still, it’s not enough and it’s like he wanted Lila to come and visit him every day just like before.</p>
<p>Lila was just elated seeing him, finding him so adorable that she wanted to give him everything he wanted.</p>
<p>Living with Hir, Lila finally understood why parents are head over heels for their kids. The mere sight of seeing him eat was enough to make her feel full and every time she saw him, she felt like she was looking at a small, precious being who was different from herself.</p>
<p><em>I can finally see Hir!</em></p>
<p>She made a mental note of asking him about how his ring manifestation practice is going. The thought of seeing him again instantly lifted her spirits up, proving that seeing Hir was all she needed.</p>
<p>“We have chocolate chip cookies for dessert. Do you want to take these with you?”</p>
<p>“How wonderful!” Lila beamed.</p>
<p>“Please hold on for a sec.” Jane brought out the chocolate chip cookies and placed them on a beautiful plate. There weren’t a lot, but it was enough for a young child who had just finished his swordsmanship training.</p>
<p>“You should eat some too, Madam Lila. I don’t advise giving all the cookies to the young master.”</p>
<p>“… But, I don’t think it’s enough.” Lila said worriedly. She thought that the plate of cookies was just enough for her son, which prompted Jane to look at her in horror.</p>
<p>“No! Eating too much of these is not good for him. Please don’t let the young master have too many sweets. Have him take only half. Okay? Promise me.”</p>
<p>“Oh… Okay.” Lila had no choice but to agree, especially when Jane was looking at her expectantly. She nodded while keeping her gaze on the cookies.</p>
<p>But if Hir tells her he wants to eat more, she will be glad to give him her share. She wouldn’t be able to say no to his puppy dog eyes anyway. But of course, she didn’t tell Jane that in fear of her wrath.</p>
<p>“I’ll go drop by later! I’m sure the young master will get easily caught up with his own strings of questions.”</p>
<p>“Oh, alright.”</p>
<p>Jane reminded Lila once again to not let Hir eat all the cookies, urging her to have some for herself. “I used a lot of chocolate for this. You would like it since you, too, seem to be fond of sweets.”</p>
<p>“I think so too.” Yes, Lila was fond of chocolate chip cookies, but not as much as Hir.</p>
<p>Lila took the plate in her hands and proceeded to go out of the kitchen, telling Jane she didn’t have to come with her as she went up to Hir’s room.</p>
<p>When she got there, the first thing she noticed was Hir’s door that was replaced with an antique-looking one, unlike the strange door found in the old Marshmell mansion. She balanced the plate on one hand and knocked.</p>
