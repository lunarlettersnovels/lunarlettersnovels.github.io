            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 7 – Banishment (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Ye- … yes? No, I’m not! I’ll get it!”</p>
<p>The maid could not understand why Mrs. Marshmell had suddenly become a completely new person.</p>
<p><em>Check his health? Bring him food? And now medicine?! </em>She thought. <em>Why is she suddenly changing, I don’t understand. Why was she interrupting the fun?</em></p>
<p>The irritated maid’s eyes grew wide, as if something had come to mind.</p>
<p><em>Ah! This must be some kind of new game! After giving hope to the little wretch, she will try to trample on all the hopes of salvation so that he can never get back up ever again! Anyway, soon she’ll go back to being normal again!</em></p>
<p>On her way to follow Lila’s order the maid let loose a short snicker. After the maid disappeared behind the wall Lila clicked her tongue out loud.</p>
<p><em>Her eyes show everything. She’s too obvious.</em></p>
<p>Lila knew the maid very well. She didn’t take too much notice of her in the beginning because she had to take in the reincarnation. But when she came to her senses, she slowly started to remember the contents of the novel. There was always one maid that stuck close to Mrs. Marshmell. How could she have forgotten? The maid was also a woman who found pleasure in bullying Hir in the original book. She would often be the cause for harassment to Hir when Mrs Marshmell wasn’t present, as if the poor boy hadn’t already had enough</p>
<p>The reason for her existence was to abuse Hir. Her level of abuse was even higher than Mrs. Marshmell. Whenever Mrs. Marshmell would be done with Hir the maid would be right behind her for some more severe follow up.</p>
<p>She would make sure that his meals never got to him, she would get hold of and sell anything that belonged to him that had a fraction of a value. and she would physically abuse him when no one was around. under the pretext of Mrs. Marshmell’s orders.</p>
<p>The worst part was that she never really hated Hir for any particular reason, she just found thrill in abusing someone with a higher status than herself. Lila could only dig up one feeling from these actions, disgust.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Mo-mother.”</p>
<p>The sudden apology caught Lila off guard, causing her face to crack.</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Marshmell clicking her tongue usually would probably give the poor boy a heart attack, I should really pay attention to what I do around him.</em></p>
<p>She also hadn’t noticed that she was slowly stiffening her face and putting on a light frown at the same time. “Oh no, I am sorry. That wasn’t because of you, don’t worry,” she said, while slowly fixing her expression to a straight face.</p>
<p>“I-is that … so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you don’t have to pay attention to it. Just drink your soup, take the medicine that the maid will bring you, put the towel on your head, then go to sleep.”</p>
<p>“Uh … al-alright”</p>
<p>“Come on then, get to it.”</p>
<p>Hir nodded his head with slight hesitation, still trying to figure out the reason behind the sudden change in his step mother’s attitude. Even with his extreme hunger he still drank the soup with caution.</p>
<p><em>Thank god he’s eating. </em>Thought Lila</p>
<p>The soup gradually reached the end of the bowl until the bowl was empty. The maid came when the last drop in the bowl was being consumed.</p>
<p>“Uhm, Madam! I have split the adult medicine in half!”</p>
<p>“Yes thank you. Give it to me.”</p>
<p>“Here you go.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. The water’s finished. Could you bring some more water for him to drink with the medicine?”</p>
<p>“Uh … right away!”</p>
<p>Lila smiled wryly in her heart. It was because the maid’s expression was so obvious. <em>Dumb.</em> She thought to herself. <em>The maid doesn’t even know how to hide her plotting, it was written all over her.</em> Lila continued to command her even after the maid brought the water.</p>
<p>“Wet the towel.”</p>
<p>“There’s too much water, squeeze it a little and bring it back.”</p>
<p>“It’s warm. Dip it in cool water.”</p>
<p>More sweat trailed down the maid’s cheeks. She was becoming more and more anxious. Lila noticed that the situation seemed to have turned around, so she considered more options.</p>
<p>“Hey, the plate I just threw out the window, go out and clean up the glass.”</p>
<p>“Oh … yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>She was still trying to catch her breath from going up and down the stairs over and over again. Despite being breathless, The maid still smiled and nodded to the task given to her.</p>
<p>“And … You can leave the mansion straightaway after that.” Added Lila coolly as if to ridicule her.</p>
<p>“Oh, alright … Wait, w-what?”</p>
<p>“I clearly said, clean the pieces of the broken plate and leave this mansion.”</p>
<p>Lila’s face seemed so calm, even though she had just given the maid enormous news out of the blue for the maid. It was as if this was a normal matter for her. To the maid this meant: ‘You’ve worked a lot, now go rest’ which was impossible to come out of Mrs. Marshmell’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Marshmell! What do you mean?! I’ve always been in full service of you!”</p>
<p><em>The woman you’ve devoted yourself to has already left the world. </em>Replied Lila to the screams inwardly. Lila smiled bitterly at the maid, who was shouting like a schoolgirl at an unfair dismissal. One by one, she was going to sort out the sources of threats to Hir.</p>
<p>“This is ridiculous! I am not leaving!”</p>
<p>“So you don’t want to go?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do but it’s too sudden, this is unfair!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think I haven’t thought this through well enough. Hmm.”</p>
<p>Lila smiled softly and gestured to the maid to come closer. The maid acknowledged the gesture and  approached slowly, apprehensive of Lila, who had suddenly changed.</p>
<p>“Take this.”</p>
<p>Lila, took something off of the edge of her ear and placed it in the hands of the maid. She opened her palm only to see a beautiful earring lying there. The maid’s eyes grew so wide that Lila didn’t know if it was from fear or from disbelief. Inside a golden encasement, lay a dazzling lime precious stone. Just like the sun, it glistened and shone from different angles. It was truly a beauty to look at. The maid remembered Mrs. Marshmell mentioned that she received it as a gift</p>
