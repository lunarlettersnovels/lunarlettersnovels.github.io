            <p><strong>Chapter 157</strong></p>
<p>It was so frustrating that Lila herself wanted to take part in the investigation.</p>
<p>She felt anxious with the continuous setbacks that prevented Hir from developing his ring. <em>Tock, tock</em>. The sound of knocking on the door faintly echoed in the room.</p>
<p>If there’s still no progress after the wedding, Lila decided she would have to step forward.</p>
<p>There’s this thing called intuition. And Lila was confident of her own since she remembered feeling a strange sensation when she first met Doug Blake, who served as an obstacle in her future.</p>
<p>Lila took a deep breath. A high pile of documents was laid in front of her and it took so much of her time. Her main goal was to bring Dawson Hiln to his downfall, so she thought of various ways in taking him down. Living in such an aristocratic society where status is of importance, defaming a person was equivalent to an execution. She spent quite a lot of time coming up with a method that would hurt him the most, but of course, she didn’t want to do much damage to the rest of the Hiln family. After her wedding, she was planning on implementing all her plans once she became the Duchess of Wipere. The diamond mine and the contract she made with Lacias, would soon be in her hands.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Hello! I’m sorry I wasn’t able to come much earlier. I knew that Madam would be waiting for me, but I kept on working on the piece since I know you value quality more than anything else.”</p>
<p>“Well done. So, where is it? I want to see it now.”</p>
<p>Tea wasn’t even served yet and yet Lila hurried the craftsman. The craftsman, who noticed Lila’s impatience, smiled at her as he placed what he had prepared on the table.</p>
<p>“It was my first time making something like this. So it took me quite a while as compared to making jewelry. Since it’s my first time doing this, I was determined in providing a good outcome. I revised this multiple times.” The craftsman explained.</p>
<p>Lila didn’t say anything, only staring at the item in front of her.</p>
<p>“So… Do you like it?”</p>
<p>No response still.</p>
<p>The silence went on for a while as the craftsman grew increasingly anxious. “Madam?” Lila didn’t move on her spot nor did she give any particular reaction.</p>
<p>“Madam?” He repeated. At this point the craftsman recalled the efforts he made making this piece. From the time he spent trying to frame it, fixing and refining it numerous times that he lost count, to being able to see the finished work that prompted his heart to pound loudly against his chest.</p>
<p>Lila was still looking at it intently.</p>
<p>“Don’t you like it…?” The craftsman said in a worried, trembling voice, and it was only then when Lila snapped out of her thoughts.</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry. What did you say?” Lila was sporting a blank face like she was put under a spell.</p>
<p>“I-I asked if you don’t like it.” The craftsman repeated.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that. I like it so much that I couldn’t stop looking at it. I apologize for worrying you.”</p>
<p>With that the craftsman’s face brightened. “Is that so?” He chuckled, “I can’t tell you how impressed I was when I saw the finished product. I especially like this part right here, since it looks like a beautiful piece of artwork.”</p>
<p>Lila smiled, “I like this part as well.”</p>
<p>“Try holding it, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Should I?” Lila reached towards the velvet box and took the gun out of its compartment. She loved how the texture felt on her hand.</p>
<p>She had commissioned the craftsman to make a gun for her, and it was a special gun since it was different from the ones sold in markets.</p>
<p>“I like how it fits in my hand. And it looks even prettier because of the light.” Along the gun’s shaft was where Lila’s white rings were embedded, glittering brightly like a wave of jewels. The craftsman, too, was dazed at the sight as Lila titled the gun.</p>
<p>“It looks beautiful! Duke Wipere will surely like it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s for sure. You brought me a piece that was beyond the price I paid you. I will never forget this.”</p>
<p>“…Does that mean…” The craftsman trailed off.</p>
<p>Lila nodded, “I will make regular orders, and I will help promote your business.”</p>
<p>“Thank you!” The craftsman said gratefully. He squeezed his hands together and prevented them from shaking. He was proud of himself for being able to produce it after hours and hours of hard work.</p>
<p>“I brought the tea… Oh my god.” Jane said while holding a tray in her hands. Her eyes widened at the sight of the gun Lila was holding. “Is this the present for the Duke you told me about? It’s beautiful.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad that you find it beautiful as well.”</p>
<p>Jane nodded approvingly, “Even those who know nothing about guns would surely appreciate it.”</p>
<p>Duke Wipere was a simple man who would still be happy being given a toy gun, but this gun was beautiful beyond words, and it contained the ring of his beloved woman.</p>
<p>“It’s so romantic.” Jane dreamily said.</p>
<p>“This is all thanks to the craftsman.”</p>
<p>“It’s because of the Duchess’s idea.” The craftsman said smilingly, and Lila smiled in return.</p>
