            <p><strong>Chapter 171 – A Sneaky Guest (2)</strong></p>
<p>She was curious about why Enrique, who sent a rejection reply saying that he would not be able to attend the wedding due to work, sneaked in here like a mouse. When Lila was about to nod her head in acceptance, Lacias stepped in once more.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t think that’s possible. My wife was just about to take a break because she is very tired from the events that have been ongoing since earlier.”</p>
<p>Lacias wrapped his arms around Lila’s shoulders and hugged her tightly as if he didn’t want to let her go. Lila could feel the strength in his arms.</p>
<p><em>If Lacias doesn’t want me to go, I’m not going.</em></p>
<p>She looked back at the Emperor signaling to him that she won’t be going with him, but Enrique didn’t seem to want to take that as an answer.</p>
<p>“…Duke. It won’t take long. I’m not going to eat your wife or something. Why are you so defensive?”</p>
<p>“I’m not being defensive.” He instantly answered. “Have you not thought that your Majesty is interrupting our time?”</p>
<p>Lila could see Enrique scrunching his eyebrows, but Lacias showed no sign of stepping back. Enrique, who realized that, waved his hands showing that he’s giving up.</p>
<p>“You came all the way here to congratulate me,” said Lacias. “So I hope you enjoy your time here and return safely.”</p>
<p>His words sounded like a threat. When Enrique started walking away, Lacias’s bright smile shone ever so victoriously.</p>
<p>While leaving the two, Enrique passed straight by Lila and stopped for a moment next to her ear before walking away from her. “I guess you’re still trying to pretend you don’t know me. Also, this is something that even Duke Wipere knows.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><em>Should I follow him?</em></p>
<p>The emperor spoke only a few words, but those few were enough to make Lila’s heart sink.</p>
<p><em>Something that even Duke Wipere knows…?</em></p>
<p>When Lacias’ title was mentioned, she suddenly felt dizzy as though the space around her was spinning. <em>What is this ‘thing’ that Lacias already knows about? but I myself don’t know about it?</em></p>
<p>Her eyes unconsciously followed Enrique’s steps captivated by their destination.</p>
<p>“Lila?” Noticing Lila’s face becoming slightly stiff, Lacias tilted his head and brought his face closer to her cheek. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Ah…. It’s nothing. As you said, I think I’m just tired.” She lied. She couldn’t stop thinking about Enrique’s last remark and the direction in which he disappeared. <em>Perhaps, he’s still waiting for me or he might have secretly left a note. </em>The possibilities seemed endless.</p>
<p>“Hmm, is that so?” His sea-colored eyes were filled with doubt. But instead he played it off with a smile. “If you’re tired then you should rest. You should take care of your body.”</p>
<p>He gently brushed his hand across her shoulder and she could feel the strength draining out of her with every second.</p>
<p>“There’s a rest area over there,” he said in almost a whisper.</p>
<p>“I know. You’ve been talking about that… since earlier.” She tried her hardest to not sound as tired as she actually was.</p>
<p>“I mentioned it multiple times, but you didn’t seem to hear it.” Unlike his soft voice, his face was hard to read.</p>
<p><em>He’s a quick-witted man, so he might have read what I was thinking right away.</em></p>
<p>It seemed like he was keeping an eye on her as if he was worried that she would go to Enrique. It was funny how he looked at her as if watching a cheating wife.</p>
<p>“…I’ll go.” She finally conceded.</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you tell me to take a break?”</p>
<p>“Aha?” His eyes, which had become sharp for a moment, were filled with wonder this time. Lacias slightly raised his brow as if he didn’t understand what she was talking about. “I never said you should rest alone.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“I’m tired as well. So why don’t we go and rest together?”</p>
<p><em>Ah… now I get it.</em></p>
<p>The lounge sofa was the most comfortable piece of furniture Lila ever laid her back on, at least for that day. She didn’t feel like she slept for long, but the fatigue that had accumulated in her body melted away.</p>
<p>“Did you have a good sleep?” A sudden deep voice broke in.</p>
<p>“Were you watching me the whole time?” She responded in a hoarse voice. Lila felt like she had a frog in her throat, so she tried clearing it by coughing.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Admit Lacias. “Time just flew while watching you.”</p>
<p>Lila didn’t feel like reprimanding him again, so she just got straight to the point. “How long did I sleep for?”</p>
<p>“Not so long. I think you could still rest some more.”</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t leave the hall for too long,” said Lila as she sat up straight.</p>
<p>“Everyone must be busy enjoying the celebration.” He contested. “They probably didn’t even realize we left the hall.”</p>
<p>Lacias insisted on staying in the lounge. But he wasn’t unaware that people started looking for them from the moment they left the hall.</p>
<p><em>Still, he couldn’t take a rest at all. </em>Lacias stayed awake the entire time in case his bride fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>Lila got up from the sofa she had been sitting on and straightened her dress. “Are you going now?”</p>
<p>Lacias pouted his lips like a duck without answering.</p>
<p><em>He’s so cute. </em>He reminded her of Hir in the way the two pouted their lips when they were unhappy.</p>
<p>Perhaps they looked alike because of how the characters were set up in the original novel. From the perspective of someone who actually came into the novel, the two were spitting images of each other. Besides, how Lacias only revealed his cute face to her made Lila’s heart tickle.</p>
<p>“Actually… I’m not going anywhere. I’m trying to take a good rest!” Exclaimed Lila, changing her mind.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Puzzled, Lacias slightly raised his eyebrows and Lila silently stared at his face for a moment while smiling.</p>
<p>“This lounge is amazing. They even prepared desserts in this unoccupied room,” added Lila. “It seems like they really put some effort into this event.”</p>
<p>“Hm, desserts?” Lacias said, still confused, but he clearly enjoyed her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“I should thank the maids for their hard work once I return home.” Mentioned Lila being reminded of Jane’s effort.</p>
<p>“I’ll give them a bonus or vacation if you want.” Offered Lacias.</p>
<p>“That’s a good idea. Rewards will strengthen their loyalty. And especially Jane, she needs to be rewarded.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t even imagine how hard it must have been for Jane to work for Lila and Hir in the past and current times.</p>
<p>Lila wasn’t there for her recently when she had to work in unfamiliar places from how busy Lila got. Besides, she also had her distanced from Hir while working even though Jane was the number one contributor to ending the estrangement between herself and Hir. Jane deserved compensation.</p>
<p><em>Wheat cookies and chocolate cookies topped with marshmallows. </em>Those were the desserts present in the room.</p>
<p>Lila thought about the amount of effort they put into the desserts considering how they prepared unsweetened wheat cookies for Lacias, who doesn’t enjoy sweets. The maids also prepared Lila’s favorite dessert almost perfectly (the chocolate cookies topped with marshmallows)  which couldn’t have been a coincidence.</p>
<p><em>They must have been led by a sensible maid… </em> <em>Could it be that Jane instructed them?</em></p>
<p>There were even little cute cookies for Hir. Only someone who knew his taste well had to have made them, and the only person Lila could think of was Jane.</p>
<p>“It would have been nice if Hir was here too. We missed the chance to enjoy desserts together as a family.” Mentioned Lacias, who came closer behind her. He seemed to have read her thoughts as Lila’s gaze rested on the little cookies for kids.</p>
<p>Lacias wrapped one arm around her waist from behind making her body stiffen from the sudden touch. “Hir must have felt a mix of emotions since we officially became a family today.”</p>
