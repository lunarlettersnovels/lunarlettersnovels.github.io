            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 77 – A Short Tale</strong></p>
<p>“You will be the most beautiful lady in the empire on that day.” Carmeline lightly stroked Lila’s hair, and her hand was warm. Lila closed her eyes at the touch, she could never get used to it. They had entered her heart already, and it saddened her to know that she had to leave them behind. How long would Lila need to forget Lacias’ sweet gaze and Carmeline’s warm touch?</p>
<p>Lila’s mood turned dark as she came to her senses only when Camerline’s hand left her.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mother.” She quickly tried to defend her statement. “It’s the first time I used it, I thought the title was cute.”</p>
<p>Camerline shot a quick glance at Lacias before replying to her precious daughter-to-be with flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s cute.”</p>
<p>Lacias ignored the sarcasm towards him as he was basking in Lila’s embarrassed smile.</p>
<p>Lila did not understand them at all, she could not believe how they would find an adult like her cute. They treated her like Lila treated Hir.</p>
<p><em>Hir is a child, even though he will be cute when he grows up.</em></p>
<p>Lila had thought Hir cute even after he grew up in the original novel, especially when he met his love interest. She wished she could see them together, but it was too far in the future. She may be able to see them from afar.</p>
<p><em>Humans are greedy.</em></p>
<p>Lila thought it would be enough to see Hir happy, but now she wanted to be by his side when he grew up.</p>
<p><em>Come together, Lila Marshmell. </em>She got herself to return to her senses by repeating her name and being reminded that she, Lila Marshmell, was the evil protagonist and as such needed to exit after fixing all of her mistakes.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Where are we going?”</p>
<p>Lila went to Lacias’ carriage after sending her own to the Marshmell manor. The coachman would tell Jane where she had gone. Lacias smiled as he shrugged at Lila’s question.</p>
<p>“It’s a secret.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to tell me?”</p>
<p>“I will if you ask me, but I want it to be a secret.”</p>
<p>“You’re making me curious.” She said bluntly, falling back into her seat.</p>
<p>“You’ll know when we arrive.”</p>
<p>Lila decided to enjoy the surprise and went back to looking out the window. She saw a clear sky with bright sunlight shining onto a nearby mountain. Children were playing, and people were singing in the open, it seemed marvelous.</p>
<p>The central plaza of the Wipere lands was filled with people, they all bowed when they saw the carriage marked with Wipere’s crest. Lila also bowed to them in surprise.</p>
<p>Lacias held her hand in the carriage. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, it was instinct.” Lacias laughed lightly, and Lila smiled awkwardly. He seemed to be enjoying himself. “I thought about something that would make you happy.”</p>
<p>It was about their destination, and Lila thought things over before answering.</p>
<p>“Are we going to a chocolate store?”</p>
<p>“Uh … Do you want to?”</p>
<p>It seemed to be the wrong answer, as Lila thought they were going to a sweetshop or a chocolatier. Lacias spoke with a serious voice.</p>
<p>“Do you want the carriage to turn around? We can just go to the chocolate shops around here.”</p>
<p>He looked adorable, speaking about such topics with a serious expression, she felt glad that he was ready to give her whatever she wanted, but Lila couldn’t resist the urge to tease him.</p>
<p>“Do you know this story?”</p>
<p>“Which story?”</p>
<p>“About a king who loved chocolate too much.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that one.” answered Lacias.</p>
<p>Lila took a deep breath before starting relaying the story. “A king had built a castle out of chocolate because he loved chocolate too much.”</p>
<p>“Do you want that?” She chuckled to herself lightly, Lacias only beamed in response. “Listen to the end. The king was happy to see the castle built, and I admit that I would love to see one.” Lila did want to go to such a place if there was one.</p>
<p>“However, the sun melted the chocolate, and the king drowned and died buried by it.” Lila continued with his narration. “Well, there goes that story.” She smiled as Lacias seemed like he had already expected that to be the issue. He remained quiet in his seat as he listened to her every word.</p>
<p>“While people criticized the king for being stupid and greedy, I did understand him on a level.” said Lila,  “If I could be with something I so love, I wound’t mind getting out of that castle. Swimming there for the rest of my life would make me happy.”</p>
<p>She felt her heart skip a beat as she finished that sentence, she realized that she had known her feelings towards Lacias for a long time now but just chose not to acknowledge it. She did love him.</p>
