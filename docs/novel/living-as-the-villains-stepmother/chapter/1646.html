            <p><strong>Chapter 146 – Less Time, More Training (1)</strong></p>
<p>Lila wasn’t surprised to find Hir sleeping adorably around his duvet. Even if she expected it, she couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>She slowly left the brooch on his bed desk trying to make no sound out of it. As she began leaving the room, she turned one last time to get a good look at her sleeping son. As soon as she looked his way, the boy fumbled around in bed, still asleep, but not comfortably.</p>
<p>Lila tilted her head as she heard a small groan coming from the bed. <em>Is he having a bad dream?</em></p>
<p>The look on His face seemed almost cramped. His eyes were slightly frowned and the tip of his nose was wrinkled. Lila, contemplating whether or not to wake him up, chose to just walk out cautiously. She didn’t want to risk waking him up just because she thought he was having a nightmare</p>
<p>“Hir, good night. I hope you have a beautiful dream.” Whispered Lila. When leaving the room, she heard the sound a lot clearer than last time.</p>
<p>“I’m… I’m sorry….”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“F- Forgive me… mo- mother….”</p>
<p>Lila was shocked by his sleeping remarks. She was right about Hir having a nightmare but was not expecting herself to be the reason.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Lila never wanted to know the feeling of watching a loved one suffer because of her. Yet here she was.</p>
<p><em>What was I thinking of up until a little while ago?</em></p>
<p>She almost forgot about how terrible their past was just because of her desire to be by his side. Lila knew that she couldn’t erase the past by wanting to stay together. The tower in her heart, which had been cluttered with greed and a little anticipation, collapsed.</p>
<p>She had a hallucination of black contaminated water flowing backward inside her. Lila clasped her mouth with her hand.</p>
<p><em>I feel like throwing up.</em> Lila couldn’t handle it anymore, she had to escape as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At once, Lila ran out of the room, shutting the door behind her while completely forgetting about keeping silent. She ran through the entire hallway to the window and opened it wide.</p>
<p><em><strong>Phew</strong></em></p>
<p>Lila exhaled deeply as she filled her lungs with fresh air, it felt like she could finally breathe again. Suddenly, it hit her.</p>
<p><em>What if Hir woke up?</em></p>
<p>She vaguely remembered knocking down a chair while running out of the room as well as slamming the door shut. Even while gasping for breath, she was still worried about Hir waking up. She still felt nauseous all around, but she still had one thing in mind.</p>
<p><em>I’m not going to be greedy anymore.</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t judge him from his outside appearance anymore. Hir was just repressing himself. She thought. He must have thought that if he only pretends to be okay, he would avoid consequences.</p>
<p><em>Would it have been right for me to act coldly instead of showing affection from the beginning? </em>Although Lila thought this, she knew deep down that she didn’t have the heart to treat him with anything other than love.</p>
<p><em>What’s done is done … All I have to do is to let go of my greed.</em></p>
<p>Lila couldn’t forget what Mrs. Marshmell did before she took over this body, to Hir, she was still the same person.</p>
<p>The window frame was ice cold. Thanks to her freezing fingers, her nausea wore off. She was thankful for the moon looming over the horizon as if watching over her. If it wasn’t for its silent companionship she would have felt cold inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Ha-Hya! Hai!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Ha-ap! Hoa! Ha!”</p>
<p>Lacias’ lips twitched unnoticeably. He knew that Hizette was the perfect instructor for Hir but he wanted to see it with his own eyes.</p>
<p>Although he expected it, he couldn’t help but smile at the scene before him. His only regret was that Lila wasn’t here to see it beside him. She would have smiled brightly. He thought. Lacias was absolutely correct, she would have loved watching a boy, the size of a peanut, swinging a sword around with all his heart</p>
<p><em><strong>Yaaa-p!</strong></em></p>
<p>Lacias breathed out in satisfaction, he was impressed by how the boy was cutting through the air, it was proof of real improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Pu-k!</strong> Hir made an even louder sound from hitting the wooden mannequin. It seemed like he had quite a bit of power in his small body.</p>
<p>“Ha! Hizette! Didn’t I do well just now?” He asked while breathing heavily.</p>
<p>Hizette nodded in agreement. “Yes. The last hit was really good.”</p>
<p>“I want to show this to my mom!”</p>
<p>“I think you’ll be able to show her if you struck the same hit one hundred more times.”</p>
<p>Hir’s eyes that were full of anticipation lowered in an instant. He couldn’t wait to show off his newfound skills to Lila but one hundred more strikes seemed to be a long way.</p>
<p>He obediently began striking the wooden figure again with a more upset face.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tat, Tak!</strong></em></p>
<p>The previous hits sounded completely different, perhaps due to an intervention of luck. Lacias, who was looking at Hir with his arms crossed and an oblique position, walked forward. Hizette quickly bowed to him and quietly took a step back.</p>
<p>“Uhm….” Hir’s upset reaction turned into a more baffled one, he still didn’t know how to react to Lacias approaching him. “Uh, ah, hello…”</p>
