            <p><strong>Chapter 225</strong></p>
<p>“Li…”</p>
<p><em>La? Since when did you bulk up? </em>Roxana could barely suppress her shock.</p>
<p>“Where’s Lila?” Lacias demanded.</p>
<p>The person standing in fear wasn’t Lila. It was a huge man with a beard.</p>
<p>“Wh-who are you?” the man demanded. “Who are you to break down someone’s door! Who gave you the right?”</p>
<p>Considering three fully armed knights were facing him, the fear in his eyes wasn’t unusual.</p>
<p>But Lacias didn’t really care. He walked towards the man, whose eyes widened in fear. He stared him in the eye.</p>
<p>“Answer. My. Question.” Under Lacias’s gaze, the man’s facial muscles trembled.</p>
<p>“Answer,” Lacias said. “You saw what happened to your door. I can make the rest of your body like that.”</p>
<p>“I—I don’t know what you’re talking about—”</p>
<p>“You don’t?” <em>Then I shall make you.</em> Lacias took off his gauntlet. If the man was hit by it, he would surely die.</p>
<p>The man continued trembling. Roxana’s eyes narrowed. He didn’t look like he knew who Lila was.</p>
<p>But if she stopped Lacias from striking him, she could get into trouble. She had no choice. Roxana took a step forward.</p>
<p>“My Lord—” she began, but he cut her off immediately.</p>
<p>“Get lost,” he snapped.</p>
<p>“My Lord, I don’t think he knows who Lila is. Perhaps I could question him?”</p>
<p>“I told you to get lost.”</p>
<p>She could feel his aggression shifting toward her, becoming more difficult for her to handle as it multiplied.</p>
<p>“Ah,” she said. “Well, honestly…”</p>
<p>Lugar shot her a glare and shoved a ‘Wanted’ poster in the man’s face. “You really don’t know this person?”</p>
<p>The man’s eyes widened with recognition. “Ah—that woman! I remember. The fireplace! The white blonde with purple eyes! Pretty face!”</p>
<p>“Lila?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes! I’ve seen her before. I have!”</p>
<p>Lacias’s face suddenly looked a little calmer.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>“Her whereabouts?”</p>
<p>“I—I’m not sure…” The man scratched his head. He didn’t seem like he was lying. Especially judging by the way he’d acted until now.</p>
<p>“Ah…” Lacias suppressed his anger. “Then tell me what you remember.”</p>
<p>“What I remember…” The frowned, trying hard to remember. Carefully, though he couldn’t remember much, he began talking.</p>
<p>“So it was the day the fireplace arrived at my place. I was wondering what IT was. I checked the address, but it was mine, so I didn’t know what to do. But then that lady in the picture—and a man—came to my house.</p>
<p>One woman and one man. Lacias frowned.</p>
<p>“…then they apologized to me for writing the wrong address—and then gave me money,” the man continued. “That’s all. That’s all!”</p>
<p>Everyone could tell he wasn’t lying. They’d tortured people before. But Lacias realized there was nothing else to be heard. He lowered his gaze.</p>
<p>“Were they…newlyweds?” Lacias asked.</p>
<p>“It…seemed liked it.”</p>
<p>Lacias frowned.</p>
<p>“The—the lady seemed too good for him,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>The man answered any questions asked. Other than his opinion on how the man looked so much older that she could’ve been his second wife.</p>
<p>It might’ve been the most important information for Lacias, but the man didn’t know that.</p>
<p>“My Lord, what would you like to do?” Roxana asked quietly.</p>
<p>Lila’s trace ended here. There was nothing to go on. Roxana felt like giving up. Nixon Kingdom was too vast, and Lila could have been out of the kingdom by now.</p>
<p>Lacias also seemed to realize that he couldn’t trace her anymore. He was quiet for a moment, crumbling the address in his hand. Unlike Roxana, his hope didn’t waver one bit.</p>
<p>“I’m annoyed,” he said, brushing his fingers through his hair. “There’s nothing that pleases me around here.”</p>
<p>Then he added, “Sell this house.”</p>
<p>The man blinked. “I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>“Sell it.”</p>
<p>“B-but how? Where am I supposed to stay? It’s unfair for you to ask me to sell the—”</p>
<p>Lacias removed a broach from his chest. It was expensive enough to buy a house and more.</p>
<p>“—house,” the man continued, his eyes widening, “but I guess it could work. I think it’s something very urgent! I’ll give it to you right away. Yes, yes.”</p>
<p>The man bowed as he received the broach, unable to hide his smile.</p>
<p>He sold even his furniture. Lacias and his companions sat depressingly in a house much smaller than the Duke’s Mansion.</p>
<p>“Why did you buy this house?” Roxana wanted to know.</p>
<p>For Lacias, this house was a pocket change. It didn’t even cost as much as one broach on his cape. But what could have made him buy it?”</p>
<p>Lacias figured, he would play fire with fire.</p>
<p>“Lila will use this house as a fake address again,” Lacias explained. “And she bribed the owner with money.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“That means that if she got something to be delivered, she’ll use this house again. Since she bribed him once, it’ll be easier to explain, and the house owner will also understand right away.”</p>
<p>Roxana nodded, amazed at his logic.</p>
<p>“That makes sense, since she wouldn’t want to reveal her actual address. I’d do that, too. There will be necessary items for basic living, and she’ll use this address for delivery.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“But we can’t just wait here, can we? We have no idea when Miss Lila will buy new items or small items. She might decide to go and grab them herself.”</p>
<p>“No.” There was something confident about his tone. This time, he was sure Lila would fall to his trap.</p>
<p>“Lila will come again. And it will be soon.”</p>
<p>His confidence was confusing—how could he be so sure? But he was their master. They just had to trust him.</p>
