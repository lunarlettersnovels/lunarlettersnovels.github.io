            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 87 – You Are Beautiful</strong></p>
<p>A written response from the other side should have arrived by now, but what Lila received instead was the sight of Lacias strolling towards her.</p>
<p>“Lila, what a dream it is to see you again after yesterday.” Lacias said and stopped in front of Lila. He was smiling so much it reached his eyes.</p>
<p>Lila was surprised at Lacias’ unexpected visit. “What brings you here unannounced?” She turned to look at Jane, realizing that Lacias must’ve informed her regarding his arrival.</p>
<p>Hir and Lacias sat in the dining room when the meals were served. They waited for Lila to come sit with them before stuffing their plates. Realizing that she was the only one left standing, Lila let out a sigh and sat across Lacias.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” Lila repeated.</p>
<p>“Do I need to have a reason?” Lacias flashed a smile in her direction. “I just want to see you and my son.”</p>
<p>While everyone would find the statement sweet and endearing, the only thing that Lila hoped for was for Lacias to treat Hir well on her absence.</p>
<p>Lila shook the thoughts off her head, not giving Lacias’ words a second thought and responded with, “Shall we start eating?”</p>
<p>“All right.” Lacias lightly chuckled at Lila’s subtle diversion.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Hir said quietly. He seemed to be uncomfortable on his spot, and Lila thought it must have something to do with Lacias’ presence. Hir ate timidly and contrary to what Jane had said earlier, he seemed to be uninterested in the lamb at all.</p>
<p>Which could only mean one thing: Jane prepared the dish specifically for Lacias.</p>
<p>Aside from the chocolate cookie, Lila doesn’t know anything else that Lacias liked, Lila thought bitterly. Watching them eat with these thoughts in mind made her feel like she was undeserving of their company.</p>
<p>“You should eat more, Hir.” Lacias spoke suddenly, making Hir look up from his plate. “The food is delicious.”</p>
<p>Lacias took a slice of lamb from the serving and placed it on Hir’s plate. Hir’s cheeks flushed from the gesture and muttered, “Thank you…”</p>
<p>“No worries.” Lacias smiled as he looked at the boy chewing on the lamb. It seemed like it was the first time he ever tasted it, but he appeared to find the meat delicious as he took bite after bite.</p>
<p>Lila thought that their taste in food was similar to each other, and they made a pretty picture of how a family would look like. The corners of Lila’s mouth curled into a small, pleased smile.</p>
<p>Lacias saw that Hir had his favorite desserts waiting for him, which was sweeter than what Lila makes. Hir happily placed the sweets in front of him like an excited puppy and dived right in.</p>
<p>After they had finished their meals, the maids swept in and took the empty plates onto trays before placing a scented candle in the middle. The aroma it exuded was warm and sweet, with a faint scent of citrusy lemon. Lacias blew his steaming cup of tea before sipping in small amounts, while both Lila and Hir had warm milk with drizzled honey.</p>
<p>“Lacias, do you remember the time when you taught me how to use a ring? Lila said, cupping her warm milk with both hands.</p>
<p>Lacias nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Would it be alright if I ask you to do it again, this time for someone else?” Lila asked expectantly, and Lacias glanced at Hir who he presumed Lila was referring to.</p>
<p>“I’m not good at it, though.” Lacias clasped his hands together.</p>
<p>Lila leaned an inch closer, wanting Lacias to understand where she’s coming from. “I just want someone to teach him. If he’s able to use a ring..” Her words drifted from her seeing that Hir was listening closely, his warm milk lay forgotten beside him. Fortunately, Lacias understood what her intentions were and nodded.</p>
<p>“I think Hir knows how to use rings.” Lila continued.</p>
<p>Lacias’ eyebrows quirked upwards in surprise. “He does?” He regarded Hir for a brief second. “How? Did he make one?”</p>
<p>Lila shifted on her seat. It’s not like she could tell him that she read it in a book. “No, it’s not that..” Lila paused before coming up with an excuse. “It’s just that I could see a potential in him.”</p>
<p>“Is that so..” Lacias had no idea what she was talking about, but he let her continue anyway.</p>
<p>“Could you show him your ring? He took interest in mine.” She prodded.</p>
<p>Lacias tilted his head to the side as he gazed fondly at Lila’s face “Well, who could blame him?”</p>
<p>Lila wasn’t able to catch on, however. Slightly confused, she asked what he meant by that, prompting Lacias to reach for her hand that was splayed on the table.</p>
<p>“Because you are beautiful.” Lacias said, and with a sheepish smile he added, “Your ring, I mean.”</p>
