            <p><strong>Chapter 109 – Hide Your Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Lila did not find the need to answer her question. “What’s the point of asking something you know already?”</p>
<p>“Um … for clarity?” Edith looked at her sheepishly.</p>
<p>“What clarity? Obviously, The Wipere Family will be taking Senior’s side. There’s no need for an explanation on that.” Lila failed to realize that her tone was not as respectful as it should have been, yet Edith seemed to not care at all.</p>
<p>“Then there is absolutely no reason not to sign here, Lila. Of course, The Wipere’s choice is the best. They always know how to make money. You should have told me sooner, haha!” Lila was glad to see that Edith was so upfront and honest. She felt comfortable, compared to how she felt when Edith acted ambiguously in the past.</p>
<p>Edith brushed through her hair and leaned close to her. “Just saying as a disclaimer, I’m supporting you because I truly like you, Lila! I would have never expected something so spectacular, but trusting your choice is certainly the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Lila leaned away, she did not sound very convinced.</p>
<p>“For real! I mean it!” Edith was back to acting like a whiny child, but Lila felt relieved to confirm her true personality.</p>
<p>“But Senior Hiln….” Edith leaned even closer, so close that she was whispering into Lila’s ears. “I’m not sure about her.”</p>
<p>Lila realized that Edith whispered to her on purpose so that Senior wouldn’t hear them. Once she was done both of them turned to her just to find a frowning Senior staring right back at them. “Excuse me? I feel offended.”</p>
<p><em>She heard. </em>They both thought simultaneously.</p>
<p>Edith covered her mouth with her palm trying to act apologetic. “Oh my, sorry!”</p>
<p>“Huh … ? You call that an apology?” The hustled apology only ignited Senior’s fury.</p>
<p>Edith felt a little defensive at her claim. “I’m soon to be partners with Ms. Hiln, doesn’t that give me the right to say that much? Based on what I’ve observed, it would be quite challenging for you to beat Dawson Hiln. Thus, I do have the right to assure myself.”</p>
<p>“Wh … What did you just say?!” Senior’s nose shot back.</p>
<p>“Hehe, Ms. Hiln seems to approve that she herself is incompetent.”</p>
<p>Lila watched in pain as the two went back and forward with each other. “Please don’t provoke Senior, Edith.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry!” She immediately sat back down, ashamed of herself as if she was a schoolgirl being punished by her teacher.</p>
<p>“And Senior, how many times do I need to tell you? It’s not a good habit to be so obvious with your emotions. It’s a serious weakness you need to get rid of.”</p>
<p>She looked away trying to hide her angered face. “Alright … I’ll practice at home.”</p>
<p>Her hot-blooded temper would be arduous to fix. Lila brainstormed for a good idea,  she quickly found a solution and grasped attention by tapping on the table.</p>
<p>“How about we meet Dawson Hiln?”</p>
<p>Senior looked utterly perplexed. “Pardon?”</p>
<p>“You’ll get the gist of it once you need to deal with a person like Dawson.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. I won’t be surprised if I end up punching his face the moment I see him-”</p>
<p>“And I’m here to stop you from doing so,” said Lila, cutting her off.</p>
<p>Senior had a long way to go. Lila was dubious whether Senior could become a worthy head of the family, but she was willing to try her best. She decided that she wasn’t ready to meet Dawson, so she came up with a different solution. “How about you meet Lacias, Senior?”</p>
<p>“Ah … Huh? That’s a little….” Even Senior hesitated to meet the duke face-to-face.</p>
<p>“We’re going to throw a party, so it would help if you got to know more people. And Edith will help us to gather them with her charismatic personality. I will also be attending and I’m sure Lacias would attend if I asked him.”</p>
<p>At this point, it appeared as if Lila was begging to go, but she acted so to be considerate of Lacias’s pride.</p>
<p>“The Duke Wipere is quite intimidating….” Senior muttered, loud enough for Lila to hear.</p>
<p>“And you need to learn how to overcome that fear. Are you going to avoid everything that intimidates you even as the head?”</p>
<p>“That…!” Senior clenched his teeth. Lila’s last line got to her head, just as she expected. “That’s not true! That’s not what I meant.”</p>
<p>“I told you. There’s no need to fear Lacias. You’ve already met him at Hiln’s party,” said Lila diligently</p>
<p>“Well, I wasn’t scared at all, of course. He was very different from what I have heard about him, but I was aware that it wasn’t his real personality. I- I’ll try my best.” Senior replied as she fiercely nodded. She seemed to have made a decision.</p>
<p>“Alright then. Then we shall see each other soon at Senior’s party.” Lila was about to get up when Edith tugged at her once more.</p>
<p>“Lila, I’ll spread the word. I’ll tell everyone that the Wipere couple will be attending Ms. Senior’s party. You two will be enough of an attraction for all the counts to come to the party.”</p>
<p>“I see. But it’s not necessary to bring a whole crowd, so please try to carefully select the ones who will be on Senior’s side. ”</p>
<p>Edith flipped through her hair confidently. “No worries. That is my profession.”</p>
<p>“Then see you at the party. You’ll do well, right Senior?”</p>
<p>“Without a doubt.”</p>
<p>“Dawson Hin will be attending also.” Lila mentioned, a little reluctantly.</p>
<p>“You’re … inviting Dawon Hiln?”</p>
<p>“I know he’ll come whether we invite him or not. How could he not come when Lacias and Nepeli are present at Senior’s party? So make sure to practice your poker face. Be sure to hide your emotions.”</p>
