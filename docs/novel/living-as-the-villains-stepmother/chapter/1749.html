            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 29 – Lethal Weapon (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Alas. How could I allow someone else to stand beside you?” His smile was beautiful, but Lila felt like she was being tied up against her will, like she couldn’t go anywhere without him.</p>
<p>“Okay you can be my partner then, if you really wish so.”</p>
<p>Lacias’s smile reappeared in all its glory “Good, good.”</p>
<p>Lila blurted out what she had in her mind at that moment. “I couldn’t help but notice that you were holding something tightly from when I mentioned going with another partner.”</p>
<p>“Oh, this?”</p>
<p>Lila watched closely as he revealed a black object from the belt of his waist. She immediately recognised it.</p>
<p>“Is that … a gun?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Lila kept her cool nonetheless “May I see it?”</p>
<p>He handed it over without having her ask twice. Lila stroked the black barrel along with the Wipere family’s crest which was embedded in sapphires along it’s straight darkened body.</p>
<p><em>So this was the gun that appeared in the original story, it feels strange seeing it up close.</em></p>
<p>She knew the pistol was abnormal because it was mentioned in the novel that Hir took eight years to master it after being adopted by Lacias.</p>
<p>Lila noticed Lacias walking towards her from the corner of her eye as she was studying the pistol. “You seem to be giving that gun more attention than you have ever given me, It’s making me regret giving it to you.”</p>
<p>Lacias saw his opportunity and quickly wrapped his arms around Lila’s waist while she was focusing hard on the gun. He pulled her close and placed his head on her shoulders revealing a big smile on his face. It was like he was claiming ownership of her.</p>
<p>He quickly spoke up before Lila could comment on his actions. “Are you interested in shooting a few rounds?”</p>
<p>Lila looked at the little puppy on her shoulder sitting with a tilted head.</p>
<p>“May I?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” he said confidently while flipping the pistol to it’s handle and giving it to her.</p>
<p>Lila held the pistol and aimed at the window without any hesitation. After seeing no reaction from Lacias she knew her suspicions were right but she wanted to test it out anyways. A loud gunshot rang, yet no bullet shot out. Lila’s thoughts were proven correct. She knew there would be no ammunition in the pistol.</p>
<p>“It has a lovely feel and look to it, your- I mean Lacias.”</p>
<p>“You have good posture, even though you do not have a ‘ring’ to hold you. If a bullet shot out, you would have broken the window.”</p>
<p>Lila didn’t acknowledge his blatant compliments. She was still busy thinking about how bizarre it was to hold something out of a fictional book. Not to mention that her ears were still ringing from the blank shot.</p>
<p>A ‘ring’ was a special ability that only existed within the realm of the novel, it is a donut-shaped form of energy that had a will as well as destructive powers. If it’s user sprung a bullet through it the bullet would return to its user like a boomerang. It could be used in various ways according to the user’s abilities.</p>
<p>The original work had almost always mentioned it paired with a gun, so Lila did not know how the ability could be used. However, the ability was said to have infinite potential, and the powerful were desperate to possess it.</p>
<p>Lacias brought her out of her mind by asking her a question right next to her ear. “Where did you learn to hold a gun?”</p>
<p>She answered him without looking away from the pistol she still held in her hands. “From when I was young.”</p>
<p>Saying that made Lila remember the days of her buying a pistol and training with it fervently just in case she needed to shoot her father someday. She never knew it would come in handy now though.</p>
<p>Lacias hummed to himself after seeing Lila’s expression, he decided that he would not ask more about that topic and gently took the pistol out of her hands to play some tricks with it in his.</p>
<p>“I shoot this after covering the ring on the barrel. Even if I do not put the bullets in-”</p>
<p>A round frame appeared from Lacias’s wrist as he held the gun, it’s colors being black and blue suited his outfit.</p>
<p>“The ring is shot instead of a bullet, which makes everything much cleaner. Unlike the bullet, a ring would disappear after piercing through it’s target.”</p>
<p>He stared at Lila for a second then continued. “Then it returns to the user without leaving any traces. It’s the perfect murdering tool really.”</p>
<p>Lila knew that it was the power of this ‘ring’ that would make Hir a powerful emperor. He had worked sleepless nights trying to create his own ring and it had clearly paid off. At least for that version of Hir.</p>
<p>Lila never liked remembering the details of that part of the story nor did she like reading through it. It involved much training and bloodshed. However she knew that the number of rings created differed from person to person and creating more rings meant your accuracy and destruction would spread evenly between them. So having one ring meant more accuracy but less fire-rate.</p>
<p>After spending eight years ripping through his palms in the novel version, Hir had managed to create three separate rings. Yet still retained a ton of power and accuracy, meaning that he was almost unstoppable by the general public. She had to make sure he wouldn’t end up the same way again.</p>
<p>Lila looked at all the black and blue rings which appeared in the room. “Do you like them, Lila? They give off such an elegant glare right?”</p>
<p>Lila couldn’t believe what she was seeing, she shuddered to herself before digesting the thought. There was no end to the amount of rings being made before her.</p>
