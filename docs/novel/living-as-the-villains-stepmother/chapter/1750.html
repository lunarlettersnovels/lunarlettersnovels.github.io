            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 28 – Lethal Weapon (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Are you feeling tired?” Lacias asked as he got up from his chair to check on his fiance. “Thanks for keeping up with my mother, she can be very intense sometimes,” he continued while looking towards his mother.</p>
<p>Camerline got up from listing all of the jewelry as if feeling the look that her son was giving her, looking back at them from a distance.</p>
<p>Lila relaxed her eyes and gazed back at him. “No it’s fine. I’m glad she’s treating me like her own daughter already.”</p>
<p>This was the first time in her current and her previous life that she was treated this nicely. She never even knew that such kindness existed. She was very glad that she had the chance to experience it though.</p>
<p>Suddenly she remembered one of the main reasons why she was there. “Oh, I forgot something.”</p>
<p>“Yes? What is it?”</p>
<p>“Do you have time?”</p>
<p>His smile widened so far that it looked like his face was melting. “I have all the time in the world for you.” Lila took little notice of his dramatic line and continued by taking a small card out of her pocket. It was a tool she meant to use to meet Hiln Senior.</p>
<p>Lacias looked a little disappointed after realizing that she didn’t falter from his intimidating line but he noticed the serious expression on her face and decided to go on with it. “What’s that card for?”</p>
<p>“It’s an invitation from the Hilns. They’re going to host a dinner party, didn’t Your Grace get a card as well?”</p>
<p>Lacias stared at Lila with an annoyed expression purposefully ignoring her question.</p>
<p>“Why are you staring at me like that?” still no response.  “Lacias?”</p>
<p>“Yes <em>that </em>is my name.” he said emphasising on the ‘that’.</p>
<p>Lila was confused “I am aware of that.”</p>
<p>“Then why do you act like you’re not aware of it?”</p>
<p>Lila finally understood the situation, he was angry that she called him ‘Your Grace’ and not ‘Lacias’.</p>
<p>He went on before Lila could come up with an apology. “Since you continue to call me by my title, I was beginning to think that my <em>wife-to-be</em> forgot my name.”</p>
<p>Lila did not know why he was obsessed with his name, but Lila decided she would follow his request since it was not that difficult. “Yes, <em>Lacias</em>. You got the invitation too, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes I have,” He said with his trademark satisfied puppy face. “However I threw it away.”</p>
<p>Lila was surprised. “You did? Why, don’t you keep invitations?”</p>
<p>The Marshmell Mansion was always filled with invitations and visiting cards. Those that had come from high-class aristocrats were dried and stored carefully since they were connections and could be boasted about to others. Lacias tilted his head, acting oblivious to Lila’s question.</p>
<p>“Why should I store trash?”</p>
<p>Lila’s eyes widened trying to keep her voice at a steady tone in front of him. “Trash?”</p>
<p>“I do store <em>your </em>cards in my safe.”</p>
<p>Since he said that he dried cards, it seemed that Lacias was aware of the aristocratic traditions. However, what cards? “I’ve never sent you a card.”</p>
<p>Lacias smirked to himself. “What about the one you sent to me today?”</p>
<p>“You mean the memo I tied to your pigeon?”</p>
<p>That was trash for Lila, but Lacias nodded with a shy smile. Lila failed to see through the situation. <em>Why would he do that?</em></p>
<p>“I know that Your Grace does not attend social parties.”</p>
<p>He sighed to himself, not feeling like repeating what he said before “Lacias.”</p>
<p>“Uh yes … Lacias, I know that you do not attend social parties, but I wanted to know just in case.”</p>
<p>He smiled again when he heard his name come out of her lips once more.</p>
<p>“I was going to ask whether you could be my partner if you attended this party, but if you threw away your invitation, I guess that means you won’t go.” Lila gave up, she did not want to drag a person who did not want to go with her so she thought about the idea of asking around for an appropriate person to be her partner.</p>
<p>“Oh well in that case, I’ll go.”</p>
<p>Lila did not expect him to say that at all. “But you said that you threw away the invitation.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but I’ll still go.”</p>
<p>Lila thought Lacias was exerting himself on her behalf, so she slowly shook her head before speaking “No, no, it’s all right. I can take anyone, I know you’re busy and don’t want to go.”</p>
<p>Lacias’s smile faded and was replaced with darker eyes and stiffened lips. “Huh? … Anyone?” He paused a bit before continuing. “Who will you choose as your partner if I don’t go?”</p>
<p>“Well, I haven’t decided on someone yet-”</p>
<p>She stopped abruptly when she noticed his darkened eyes filled with bright rage. <em>Is he … angry?</em></p>
<p>His atmosphere had been fierce, but Lacias’s eyes turned soft the moment they met Lila’s. Lila let the moment pass since she couldn’t understand why he would be angry. <em>Hmm I must have just been imagining it.</em></p>
<p>“It’s really alright if you don’t want to come.”</p>
<p>He tilted his head as he stared at Lila, making his sharp features more apparent. “No it’s fine, I’ve changed my mind.” Lila couldn’t help but feel an eerie shudder.</p>
