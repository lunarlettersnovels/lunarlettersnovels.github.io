            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 88 – Aversion</strong></p>
<p>Lila sat frozen at the words spewed out of Lacias’ lips. She usually didn’t mind how sappy he could get, but Hir was right next to them, attentively listening that Lila immediately pulled her hand from Lacias’ grasp in embarrassment. “Stop talking nonsense and show us your ring.” She said meekly.</p>
<p>She could feel her ears turn red and thankfully her tresses hid it from view. Lacias chuckled at how flustered she had gotten over such simple words, making Lila flush even more as a light shade of pink dusted her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Hir, what do you think of Lila’s ring?” Lacias addressed the boy with a smile on his lips.</p>
<p>“It was shiny and bright, and it is beautiful just like Mother!” Hir exclaimed, his eyes darted towards Lila.</p>
<p>Lacias glanced at Lila sweetly. “Yes. You and I know very well that your mother is indeed beautiful, and I couldn’t agree more.”</p>
<p>“Yes! She really is!” The sincerity and admiration in their voices was evident from the way they were looking at her with so much warmth that Lila was rendered mute on her seat. She did not anticipate the conversation would go off track, didn’t think that Lacias was the type to get distracted. She then decided she would ask Hizette for help instead.</p>
<p>Lila slightly squirmed under their fond gazes and responded, “Stop talking about me and…” Her voice trailed off as she nodded at Lacias, hoping he would get the message.</p>
<p>Lacias then lifted his arm and made rings effortlessly, producing blue and black rings that were just as beautiful as Lila’s golden ones. While Lila’s was that of a sun, Lacias’ contrasted hers like the midnight sky.</p>
<p>Lila and Hir stared at the rings, but a sudden emotion stirred within Hir that he drew a long breath, startled at the sensation that was blooming deep inside him. It was not like the time when he saw Lila’s ring; this was the complete opposite… A dark, gloomy feeling gripped his senses that he fisted his hands and wrapped his arms around himself. He was shaking and a wave of nausea hit him like a tide that he barely had the time to cover his mouth as he began vomiting.</p>
<p>Upon noticing Hir, Lila’s eyes widened in distress as she frantically scrambled towards him. Lacias’ rings faded as he slowly stood up from his seat, his blue eyes glaring at Hir for a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“I-it’s just that I felt my head spin for a minute..” Hir explained quietly.</p>
<p>Lila sighed, recalling how she felt a little cold when she saw Lacias’ rings. But it seemed like Hir had a more violent reaction seeing it up close. She swept his bangs off his forehead with a gentle hand.</p>
<p>“I should’ve made only one ring, and informed you beforehand.” Lacias said and placed his hand on Lila’s shoulder in apology.</p>
<p>“Lacias.” Lila said firmly, upset at the implication of Lacias’ words. She could see how bad he felt on the inside. “It’s not your fault. I should be the one to apologize, since I urged you to show us your ring.”</p>
<p>“Still.” Lacias responded with a sigh. He turned to look at Hir and asked, “Are you all right, Hir?</p>
<p>“Yes, I am. It was so sudden… I’m so sorry.” Hir replied, bowing his head as he played with his fingers.</p>
<p>Lacias scooted closer to Hir. He stretched his arm and patted the boy’s hair in consolation. “No. There’s no need to apologize. We’re happy as long as you’re alright.”</p>
<p>“You’re still unwell, Hir. I should feed you better.” Lila said, concern seeping into her voice. Hir looked up at her and shook his head.</p>
<p>“I’m eating enough.” He replied adamantly and caressed his plump cheek to prove his point. He should cut down on sweets just like what Jane had told him. He let out a drawn breath before fussing with his fingers again. “I’m sorry.” He repeated, still feeling bad for having ruined such a warm moment between them.</p>
<p>“Stop saying that.” Lila clasped his hands with hers and told him reassuringly. “We promised you won’t say that anymore. You were just dizzy, that’s all.”</p>
<p>She was rubbing comforting circles on the top of his hands, so warm and gentle that Hir nodded and flashed her a small smile. “Okay.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“The garden is quite small.” Lila stated as she and Lacias strolled through the back garden of the Marshmell’s manor. It was comparatively smaller than the one Lacias had back in the Wipere manor, but Lacias liked it all the same. He could see the familiar outline of a swing several feet away from them, smiling at the thought of Lila being the one who made it.</p>
<p>“It’s nice, actually.” Lacias said, taking in his surroundings with the soft wind blowing on his face. “Is that the swing you told me about last time, the one you wanted to bring with you?”</p>
<p>“Oh. Yes, that’s the one. It’s Hir’s favorite.” Lila responded.</p>
<p>“I see. I do hope it will be brought to our house soon.” Lacias’ eyes drifted to the swing before turning to face Lila with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Lila tilted her head to the side. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Lacias stepped an inch closer to her. “What I meant was I want us to be married as soon as possible.” Lila took a step back and proceeded to stroll while Lacias followed close behind her, like an attached puppy following its master. Lila smiled at how adorable Lacias was being that she reached out, stood on her toes, and stroked his head affectionately.</p>
