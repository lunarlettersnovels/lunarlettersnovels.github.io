            <p><strong>Chapter 212</strong></p>
<p>From the looks of it, he wasn’t trying to learn about Lila’s destination nor report to Lacias. So far he was just trying to be protective.</p>
<p>“Have you heard what kind of lifestyle I had before coming into the Wipere family?” asked Lila confidently.</p>
<p>Hizette thought for a moment before returning the question. “About your past? Not much. I think I know the information available to the public, but not much about your personal life.”</p>
<p>“Seems like you haven’t been snooping around,” said Lila with a wide grin.</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> is not my duty.”</p>
<p>Lila expected him to not have done a background check, so she had her explanation ready. “Then I’ll let you in on a deep part about my past.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I abused my only son, Hir, in the past. I physically abused him and rarely fed him.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>From his facial expression, Lila could tell that the knight didn’t believe her. He probably thought she was fabricating a background story to be let out.</p>
<p>She tried making a stern face to question his suspicious expression. “You think I’m lying to you? Hir still has nightmares because of me. I hear him at night apologizing in his sleep.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I can’t imagine that. No one cares for the child more than you. But… You’re saying that you did that?”</p>
<p>“It seemed like I was possessed as I was doing horrible things to him. Horrible wouldn’t even begin to describe it.”</p>
<p>Even though she rehearsed this in her mind Lila couldn’t bear to say it out loud. Each time she heard herself it felt like her heart was being stabbed.</p>
<p>“So that’s when I made this resolution. I did something to Hir that could not be forgiven so I’ll live the rest of my days asking for forgiveness. After putting Hir in a position he’s satisfied with I’m going to disappear, since I have no right to be by his side anymore.”</p>
<p>Hizette nodded slightly. “So that’s why you wanted to have him be adopted into the Wipere family and that’s why you came to the duke’s family, to begin with?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I had a contract marriage with Lacias. I made a deal where I’ll bring him his mine back and he’ll put my child in his family tree, and that contract duration is almost done.”</p>
<p>It was painful to explain but Lila maintained her stern face. “And when I saw that tool you showed me, I realized that I was being a burden to not one person, but two.”</p>
<p>Hizette sighed and tried reasoning with her. “Lila, you’re not a burden. It was solely master’s choice to put his ring into it.”</p>
<p>“If I wasn’t there, he wouldn’t have made that choice. I don’t want to be a burden to my loved one.”</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“No… I got attached as we spent time together, but after seeing that pillar, I knew that I had to leave as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Hizette just stood in silence, Lila wasn’t someone who would change her opinion. She was going through a lot, and he could do nothing but think about how cold she felt after her shawl fell to the ground.</p>
<p><em>Very cold</em> he thought.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Hizette.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” He turned while heading back to the mansion.</p>
<p>“You’re smart so I believe you understand why I gave you a drawn-out explanation.”</p>
<p>Lila felt that he understood but she wanted to confirm.</p>
<p>The gaze that was facing Lila looked away all of the sudden, he was avoiding eye contact so Lila guessed she was right.</p>
<p>She tried explaining to him most of her plan on purpose in hopes that he would try to help her escape the mansion. With a seasoned knight by her side, she would easily be able to get passed Lacias. The question was, would he betray the master he served his entire life?</p>
<p>“I’m not sure.” He refused politely “But I did expect it.”</p>
<p>Lila’s face turned pale instantly. “…I see.”</p>
<p>It seemed like she was nervous about what comes after his refusal but Lila’s anxiousness stemmed from the entire situation itself. It seemed like her body automatically reacted to hardship.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hizette’s eyes shook with Lila’s reaction, so she decided to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>“In the end, this will be beneficial for Lacias, Hir, and the entire Wipere family. So Hizette, I guess it was my mistake for me to come here and tell you everything.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I was a fool.” She continued.</p>
<p>“So… you’re not having a change of heart?” asked Hizette out of confusion.</p>
<p>“A change? What change?” This threw her off a little.</p>
<p>“Something along the line of maybe not leaving this place and continuing to stay here.”</p>
<p>Lila shook her head after understanding why he would come to that conclusion. “Ha, no way. Have you been listening at all? I don’t want to be harmful to anyone I love.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying you’ll leave by any means?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Her response was as confident as ever, she seems to have made up her mind about leaving and nothing was going to change that.</p>
<p>Hizette couldn’t bring himself to speak. He couldn’t come up with a reason to convince her. His best option naturally fell on reporting the situation to his master and receiving an order. His master was bound to persuade Lila to stay.</p>
