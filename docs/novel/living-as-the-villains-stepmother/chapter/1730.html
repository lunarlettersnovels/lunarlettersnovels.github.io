            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 48 – Father and Son (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Therefore, I chose to marry again. And he will be a much better parent for you, Hir. Lacias is a sweet person.”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Hir looked cute even while sniffling, and looking at him Lila organized her thoughts as she spoke.</p>
<p>“If you do not want a new father, please tell me. Also if you need time to think.”</p>
<p>Hir rubbed his reddened eyes with small fists and he shook his head. “No. I’m fine with it, since he must be an angel like you! Anyways, Father had never been interested in me, so I don’t know.” He shrugged lightly.</p>
<p>Lila felt sad realizing that Hir had known that his father was not a good person. Viscount Marshmell had hurt Hir with his indifference, but Lila had not known what Hir had been going through mentally. Hir’s father had been barely mentioned in the original novel.</p>
<p>“Unlike the Viscount, Lacias will care for you and work for your happiness.”</p>
<p>Hir nodded and Lila looked on with compassion. She only hoped that Hir would become Lacias’ successor and live happily with Rose. Lila would only watch over him from behind and hoped that her decision would remove all obstacles from Hir’s future.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Don’t you feel nervous?”</p>
<p>“I’m all right! I’m not nervous at all!”</p>
<p>“You really aren’t?”</p>
<p>“Me?” He spluttered and waved his hands around as if the question was stupid. “No! Of course not.”</p>
<p>Lila stifled her laughter and looked over Hir’s condition as they sat in the carriage. His feet, which had bright yellow shoes on them, were shaking in the air. She knew he was extremely nervous.</p>
<p>“I understand Hir. You’re so brave, but I’m a bit nervous.”</p>
<p>“You’re also nervous?” Hir spoke in a loud voice with wide eyes at Lila’s smiling response.</p>
<p>“Also? So you’re nervous?”</p>
<p>“Oh…” His cheeks flushed as he realized his mistake.</p>
<p>Lila had to formally introduce Hir to the Wipere family before the marriage ceremony, and while she had told Hir that he didn’t need to be so tense, things seemed to be different on the day. Lila smiled inwardly at Hir’s firm expression.</p>
<p>“We’ve arrived.”</p>
<p>Lila spoke as she pointed to Lacias’ manor outside the window, which was much bigger than the Marshmell manor. The place must have looked like a palace to the young Hir.</p>
<p>“Wow!” Hir peered outside the window with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“It’s huge!”</p>
<p>Lila hoped that Hir would find happiness here and would be able to leave behind his bad memories at the Marshmell manor. Lila’s calm eyes observed him and noticed when his face grew a bit somber.</p>
<p>“Oh- but…” Hir’s face darkened as he stared at the impressive manor. “The swing you made me, is it gone?” His blue eyes became misty.</p>
<p>“Hir, you don’t have to worry about that. I will bring the swing here, and Lacias will allow it.”</p>
<p>Hir wiped his teary eyes at Lila’s answer and brightened up again.</p>
<p>“It’s lovely!”</p>
<p>Lila climbed down from the carriage as it rolled to a stop and turned back to see Hir laugh nervously.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit high.”</p>
<p>Lila had not noticed when riding it alone but having Hir with her made everything seem dangerous, and the Wipere carriage did in fact look a bit high for him.</p>
<p>“Hir, can you jump? I’ll catch you”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Despite his answer, Hir hesitated, clutching the sides of the carriage while Lila stood with open arms at the bottom.</p>
<p>“How about a hug?”</p>
<p>“Uh…” His eyebrows furrowed as he thought about it.</p>
<p>“I mean if you want to, I can wait. However, I thought it may be easier if I held you as you came out.”</p>
<p>He understood what she meant and let go of the sides, extending his arms out towards her.</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>“There you go.”</p>
<p>Hir’s cheeks flushed pink again, and Lila placed him down on the ground with a smile.</p>
<p>“You’re kind to your son to the extent that even I’m jealous. How about being kinder to me?”</p>
<p>Hir looked back in surprise at the voice right behind his back. A tall man was standing behind him and looked at his mother like she was the only person who existed in this world. While Hir was closer to him, the man did not even glance at him. My stepfather really liked Mother, but was he a gentleman? Hir looked at them while hiding his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Have you been waiting here?” Lila asked, surprised at his unexpected presence.</p>
<p>“Yes, I could not wait for you to come back.”</p>
<p>“I did not designate the time of my return.”</p>
<p>“Waiting here was better than staring out the window.”</p>
<p>Lacias’ smile reached his eyes. He placed himself next to Lila and held her hand.</p>
<p>“I missed you a lot.”</p>
<p>He kissed Lila’s hand, and she felt warmth spread up to her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you miss me?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Lacias just kissed Lila’s shoulder in reply.</p>
<p>“Give me a hug, Lila.”</p>
<p>She heard his low voice in her ear. Lila met Hir’s eyes and spoke while pushing Lacias away in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep ourselves in check since Hir is watching.”</p>
<p>“That’s a shame.”</p>
<p>It was then Lacias gave Hir a simple glance, and that was their first meeting.</p>
