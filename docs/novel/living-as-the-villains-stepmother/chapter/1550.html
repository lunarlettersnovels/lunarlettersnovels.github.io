            <p><strong>Chapter 242</strong></p>
<p><strong>-10 years after-</strong></p>
<p>“Mother, are you there?”</p>
<p>She heard the knock on her office door as she worked. It was a light knock, followed by that deep, heavy voice.</p>
<p>“Mhm, come in.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“I’m working.”</p>
<p>It was Hir, who looked nothing like he had years ago. He was now a man. The soft body had now become strong. His big and rounded eyes were now sharp and smart. He brushed his hair back to reveal his sharp forehead and nose. He looked exactly like Lacias when she’d fallen in love with him.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you be resting now?”</p>
<p>“I’m a bit tired lately. Ah, don’t tell Lacias.”</p>
<p>Hir laughed. “I’m not happy about it, either, but why are you only concerned about Father?”</p>
<p>“Lacias nags too much. Sit.”</p>
<p>Lila pointed toward the sofa. Her neck hurt from having to look up at the big Hir.</p>
<p>“Do you want some tea?”</p>
<p>“Yes—something that isn’t sweet.”</p>
<p>“Psh…” Lila pouted, glaring playfully at Hir. He smiled. He knew better than anyone why Lila was acting like that. “You were better when you were little.”</p>
<p>“Hm…”</p>
<p>“It feels like yesterday when we both last enjoyed something sweet together.”</p>
<p>“Mm…”</p>
<p>“Why are you becoming more like your father all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Hir scratched his chin. Even in his memory, he was exactly how Lila had described him. But at some point, the sweets had hurt his tongue and he’d slowly avoided dessert. Lila had been sad since then, but since Lacias had dessert with her, Hir was spared.</p>
<p>“Are you tired? Have you seen a doctor?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that bad. I know my body best.”</p>
<p>“How about resting for a bit? Let’s go to the Nixon cottage.”</p>
<p>Lila glanced up, raising an eyebrow at him as though asking if he was being serious.</p>
<p>“I’m busy because of your coronation, you know.”</p>
<p>A few days ago, Ahibalt had completely collapsed.  Enrique’s descendent had become the new Emperor. But he was exactly like Enrique. He couldn’t be any worse of a tyrant. Soon, Wipere had staged a coup. It <em>was</em> a coup, but all the people in the Empire had agreed to the change of the throne.</p>
<p>People were all for the Wiperes. The prisoner’s covenant no longer worked. Hir wasn’t a pure blood.</p>
<p><em>Even if that wasn’t the case, Lacias would’ve broken it.</em></p>
<p>The Wipere family had grabbed the throne with all the support. Just like in the original novel, Hir had become the Emperor.</p>
<p>“But what? Vacation? <em>Vacation</em>?”</p>
<p>Hir shouldn’t have said anything. He glanced away, sipping his tea. As he gazed into the void, Lila drank her cocoa.</p>
<p>“Still, see a doctor. I’ll bring one in.”</p>
<p>“I’m too lazy. And busy.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>No parent could defeat their child. Lila gave a slow nod.</p>
<p>“You were so cute when you were little.”</p>
<p>“Everyone is.”</p>
<p>“I miss those days.”</p>
<p>She said it jokingly, but there was a teaspoon of honesty in it. The little child who had followed her around all the time was no longer here. It was only natural that they grow up, but she couldn’t help missing the old days.</p>
<p>“I…wouldn’t be jealous if you had a second child.”</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>Lila choked on her cocoa in surprise. He patted her back gently, a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t be bad to have a little sibling.”</p>
<p>“Stop that.”</p>
<p>“Father would love it.”</p>
<p>Lila had a flashback. It wasn’t like that they hadn’t tried. They just hadn’t had any luck.</p>
<p>They’d gone to the doctors, but even they had been clueless as to what the problem was. Lila had figured she was the reason.</p>
<p><em>I’m not from here.</em></p>
<p>Now, she felt like her past self was more foreign than Lila. Still, she was aware that the owner of this body was someone else. Perhaps that was why her body wasn’t working properly.</p>
<p>It had all been ten years ago, so she talked casually about it, but at the time it had been really hard for her. Lacias had calmly said, “I don’t need a kid. I only need you,” and she’d cried her eyes out.</p>
<p>Lila shook her head, smiling.</p>
<p>“I like the present. I need only you as my child.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>She knew Hir was proactive, but she hadn’t figured it would be this quick. Lila shot Lacias an embarrassed look.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>She laughed nervously. “Well, Hir…”</p>
<p>“Hir?”</p>
<p>She tried to mumble her way out, but Lacias wasn’t having any of it.</p>
<p>“I just told him I was tired and he brought a doctor. He worried just like you.”</p>
<p>The doctor had paid a visit while they had dessert. He’d quickly come as Hir called him. Lila scratched her cheek, feeling her embarrassment grow.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t want you to worry.”</p>
<p>Lacias didn’t look well. It really wasn’t a big deal—that was why she hadn’t told him. But looking at the expression on his face, she felt terrible.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’ll let you know next time.”</p>
<p>“For sure.”</p>
<p>“Mhm, for sure.”</p>
<p>They pinky-promised, and Lacias’s face lit up. Thank goodness that was over.</p>
<p>Lila sat on the chair. The doctor arrived, ran some tests, and asked about her status here and there.</p>
<p>“Are you tired lately?”</p>
<p>“I do feel tired, even after sleeping a lot.”</p>
<p>“Do you have any other problem?”</p>
<p>“Hm…” Lila thought for a moment before answering. “My stomach also feels a bit bad.”</p>
<p>“In what sense?”</p>
<p>“I feel like I have indigestion, and I feel nauseated.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>As she listed out her symptoms, the doctor’s expression changed. A thought seemed to have struck him as he questioned her.</p>
<p>“Have you gagged?”</p>
<p>“Well…” Lila trailed off.</p>
<p>Lacias answered for her. “She did,” he said. “She gagged while drinking water. She said she just choked on it.”</p>
<p>Lila had hidden her state, as Lacias was so worried about her. He always did tend to overthink when it came to her symptoms.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not 100 percent, so I don’t know if I should say this…” The doctor looked hesitantly from her to Lacias and back. Lila’s palms turned clammy. Was it something <em>that</em> serious? Maybe she shouldn’t have hidden the truth about her state. Multiple thoughts were filling her head.</p>
<p>“I think you’re pregnant,” the doctor said finally.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>What was going on? Hir’s joke had become a reality.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>It’s still early so you need to be careful.</em></p>
<p>Great. Lacias’s protectiveness had become overprotectiveness now, thanks to the doctor.</p>
<p>“So…Mother?”</p>
<p>She blinked. “Mhm?”</p>
<p>“Congratulations.” Hir laughed.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Lila glanced around. Lacias had disappeared with the doctor, a serious look on his face.</p>
<p>“It seems Father is worried about you.”</p>
<p>“Worried?”</p>
<p>“He’s checking to see whether your pregnancy won’t be too much of a burden on you over and over again.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” It was just the sort of thing Lacias would do. Even amid all this chaos, Lila’s health was paramount to Lacias.</p>
<p>Lacias soon returned. “Lila!”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I…I don’t know what to say.”</p>
<p>Lacias looked down. Lila wasn’t used to that, so she brushed his hair. And then she threw him a question.</p>
<p>“Are you happy?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s all that matters.”</p>
<p>Lila smiled. She was happy that Lacias was happy. She still couldn’t believe that she was pregnant, but the thought that Lacias would be with her stripped her of all her worry.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on becoming a dad again,” she said.</p>
<p>They had been waiting for a gift like this. And she was looking forward to the future with Lacias.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming to me, Lila.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, too.”</p>
<p>“You make me happy.”</p>
<p>Lacias had learned a lot, thanks to Lila. His cold-blooded body felt warm. Lila’s warmth had filled him up.</p>
<p>“I love you, Lila.”</p>
<p>“I love you, too, Lacias.”</p>
<p>Her violet eyes curved beautifully, and she smiled. Her smile alone filled his world with color.</p>
<p>He didn’t care about anything else in the world as long as he had Lila. Lacias felt a surge of determination.</p>
<p>He would protect this family forever.</p>
