            <p><strong>Chapter 195 – Defeated</strong></p>
<p>“What are you saying?” Dawson looked at Lila as if he didn’t understand. He tried to smile, but his lip was trembling. “Sorry, did you make a mistake? Senior? Not me?”</p>
<p>“Are you stupid?” Lila couldn’t stay polite any longer. “Do you think I have a reason to betray Senior all of a sudden? Why would I pick you over Senior, who has been helping me make sure my situation doesn’t become any worse? Are you living in a dream?”</p>
<p>“Then why did you come to me? Especially without letting Senior Hiln know first!” Dawson was livid.</p>
<p>“Because, I have something to say to you in advance.”</p>
<p>“Something you can’t say with Senior?!” Dawson was starting to get aggressive, which was no surprise considering this was his status in society they were talking about. Lila shook her head, frustrated that Dawson couldn’t see the big picture.</p>
<p>The first time she had met Senior, Lila could tell that Senior had a lot of maturing to do. But Lila could also see that she had much more potential than Dawson Hiln. Dawson didn’t want to admit that Senior was better qualified to head the family, but Lila knew it to be the truth.</p>
<p>“Of course, I can say whatever with Senior. But my discussion with her will take much more time. I’m here to make a deal with you.”</p>
<p>Dawson took a deep breath and calmed himself down. He was desperate and if there was a way that he could still get something out of this decision, he was going to take it. He didn’t have many cards left to him and he would need to hold on to some status with whatever means necessary.</p>
<p>“Do you remember the mine you stole?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, I do. A diamond mine. And I didn’t steal it.” Dawson was admant about that last fact.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think it is about time to return it to its owner?”</p>
<p>“Its owner? Why? Do you think it belongs to the Wipere family? I obtained it fair and square.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t wrong. It was Wipere’s fault that they didn’t realize their informant was compromised. But she couldn’t admit it. Lila laughed at him instead.</p>
<p>“Fair and square? You couldn’t fight us, so you hid a spy amongst our ranks and now you say ‘fair’. I would never dream you would be so naive. This must be a joke.”</p>
<p>“Do you have evidence?” Dawson was suspicious.</p>
<p>“Do you think I can be this confident without evidence? You still think too lightly of me. Even after I put your status in the gutter.”</p>
<p>Dawson rolled his eyes. He was wondering why Lila wouldn’t show him the evidence, yet for some reason he was convinced that she did have it. “That’s where you’re wrong. You’re so dull that you don’t even notice who holds the real power. I have nothing to lose.”</p>
<p>Lila needed to act quickly in order to get the mine back. If she made Senior Hiln the master of the family the mine would come along with it, but Lila needed to shorten the time. She needed to get this deal completed so she could go back to her work in secret.</p>
<p>“The diamond mine? Fine. It’s a shame, but it’s not something I can’t give up.” Dawson buried his face in his hands. He remembered the moment he took the diamond mine from the Wipere family. There was joy, pride, and euphoria. All of the same emotions that were now disappearing now, in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>“If I give you the diamond mine, what can you do for me?” he asked.</p>
<p>Lila smiled to herself. This was perfect. He just needed to think that the diamond mine was being given to her for a reason, not because of a threat from her.</p>
<p>“There is nothing I need to do for you.” Lila said, stubbornly.</p>
<p>Dawson looked up, confused. “Then are you saying you’re taking the mine away from me with force?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not. Can we not look at this in a more positive manner? You are giving me the diamond mine as a gift. And quite a wedding gift it is.” Lila smiled.</p>
<p>Despite everything that was happening, Dawson still found himself mesmerized by her beauty. She was a devil that was trying to steal his soul. An alluring devil that made you nod your head and grovel at her feet, even though you could see she was destroying everything about you. Dawson began to laugh.</p>
<p>“At least you can still laugh,” Lila pointed out.</p>
<p>“You came here just to toy with me.” Dawson realized Lila’s intention clearly. But he also realized that no matter what decision he made, Lila would get her hands on that diamond mine.</p>
<p>“Listen to me. It is inevitable that Senior will become the next master, since I’ll always be by her side. When that happens, the diamond mine will become mine. You took the mine when it was the property of the Hiln family, not only yours, Dawson. Since the mine is already my property and will become so again, why should I give you something in return? Do you understand now?”</p>
<p>Dawson was at a loss for words. He realized now that he had no legal hold on the diamond mine and would have to give it up regardless.</p>
<p>“Dawson, I’m giving you a chance.” Lila smiled. Before her she could see that Dawson had lost his spirit to fight.</p>
