            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 26 – The Mother She Never Had (1)</strong></p>
<p>“How could you decide on such an important event without informing me?”</p>
<p>Lila tensed at Camerline’s cold voice. Camerline had been a sharp woman who had been nicknamed the Ice Duchess, and had been known for her quick and sharp senses.</p>
<p>Lila could not let what she had achieved so far come to ruins and firmly set her lips. <em>I have to be careful.</em></p>
<p>The Duchess turned towards Lila and stared at her with a glare colder than ice itself. “Oh? Are you the woman who my son intends to marry?”</p>
<p>“I have not signed yet, but yes, I am the woman. I apologize for not informing you-”</p>
<p>Camerline cut Lila off before she could continue “Ah worry not, you don’t need to talk for much longer.”</p>
<p>“Enter.” She said snapping her fingers.</p>
<p>Several tough men who had been waiting outside the door came in at Camerline’s signal, and they were all holding something heavy in their hands.</p>
<p>“Please put them down here.”</p>
<p>The men placed heavy boxes under Lila’s feet, and Camerline’s voice, which sounded strangely excited, rang the office.</p>
<p>“Hey! Do you like shoes and heels? How about jewels? I hope our tastes match.”</p>
<p>“….” Lila was completely taken off guard. She had nothing that she could think of to say.</p>
<p>“This is a prized necklace in my collection, which would suit you. Let’s put it on you now shall we?”</p>
<p>A mountain of luxurious goods piled in front of Lila.</p>
<p>Lila looked down at the jewelry in astonishment. “What … is this?” This was the most surprising outcome that could have ever happened to her.</p>
<p>The duchess just continued talking during Lila’s astonishment “To think that you would accept this nuisance of a son who had been tormenting me for years by refusing all my suggestions for marriage and living completely on his own terms!”</p>
<p>Camerline took out a handkerchief and tapped at her moist eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you! I am so grateful. Oh- I think I might just cry.”</p>
<p>Lila was still at a loss for words. Her mind was still processing what had just happened. She was called the Ice Duchess in the original, but cold was definitely not something she would describe her with now. Lila touched her forehead inwardly from how different this world was from this point of view.</p>
<p>The splendid luxuries did not catch Lila’s eye, as they were unnecessary, and no goodwill came without a price. There was a possibility that Lila would not be able to refuse Camerline’s unreasonable requests if she accepted them.</p>
<p>“I have already received a sufficient amount of gifts from His Grace. However, I do thank you deeply,” Lila tried to refuse politely by indirect speech.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you too rigid to someone who will be your husband? Call him by his name!”</p>
<p>Lila was hoping to not get an answer such as that one and now the subject had changed entirely. Even Lacias was responding favorably by saying yes. Lila continued trying to sneak past Camerline’s remark.</p>
<p>“Therefore, I cannot accept these gifts without reason from the duchess.”</p>
<p>Camerline frowned at Lila in an apologetic way. “Why are you calling me duchess? Please call me Mom.”</p>
<p>Lila was stunned. Even Lacias, her own son, did not call Camerline Mom. Lila could not hide her surprise. She gave up on her plan of indirect speech and changed her tactic.</p>
<p>“I have plenty of money so it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have more.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Lila didn’t know what to say. She couldn’t really say anything else anyways because it was true. A look of defeat began to spread over her features over her repeated failures as she realized that she would have to accept these burdens.</p>
<p>“I hear your head whirling from all the way over here, sweetie.” Said the duchess breaking into her thoughts.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>“Why are you stressing on yourself so much? I’m giving these because you’re pretty.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“And I’m not expecting anything back.” She said while pouting.</p>
<p>Lila was most certainly not used to this kind treatment. Not once in her previous life had she received something nice without some kind of price or consequence. Just to have a meal at the dinner table she had to listen to her father reminding her how useless she was.</p>
<p>The duchess noticed Lila’s defeated demeanour and she spread a smile on her face while tilting her head “Well. I heard you have a son.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes I do Madam.”</p>
<p>“Do you think about getting something back from him when you give him a gift? And I said call me Mom.”</p>
<p>Lila answered with some heat. “No, I don’t … Mom.”</p>
<p>“See?” Camerline looked at Lila with gentle and sympathetic eyes. Lila lowered her gaze as she could not bear the awkwardness of someone watching her with a gaze as warm as the sun itself. She didn’t understand the possibility of someone else being nice to her.</p>
<p>Camerline looked at the poor girl standing ahead of her and approached her quietly “I’m not going to act on these petty things, so stop rolling your wheels.”</p>
<p><em>My … Wheels</em></p>
<p>“Just as you don’t expect anything from your son I don’t expect anything back from you.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I thought you would be as stubborn as a rock. But it turns out you know how to accept things.”</p>
<p>Lila lowered her head and pretended to touch the necklace in front of her trying her hardest to avoid Camerline’s gaze. But she felt a pair of love-filled hands wrap around her as she picked at the jewelry. She looked up and saw the woman who was standing on the other side of the room just a few moments ago was now hugging her.</p>
<p><em>How did I not notice!</em></p>
<p>“It’ll be fine dear, now how about we try these on.”</p>
<p>Lila was on the verge of bursting into tears. “Y-yes M-mother.”</p>
