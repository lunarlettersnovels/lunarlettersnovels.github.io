            <p><strong>Chapter 160</strong></p>
<p>Lila shared the same sentiment as Lacias. The surname Marshmell was the family name that brought Hir so much misery that she simply hated being associated with it. It didn’t help that she always used it, too, and she couldn’t wait to have it changed to Wipere.</p>
<p>Even though she’ll only be using the name for quite a short time.</p>
<p>She won’t be using the name anymore once she leaves him. But until then, she would relish the remaining time being Lila Wipere by writing it over and over again, a hundred times more using her favorite ink pen.</p>
<p>“I think we should head back.”</p>
<p>Lacias answered, “I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you need to go back to your office?”</p>
<p>“No one would dare get in the way of a man who’s getting married tomorrow.” Lacias remarked.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true. But still, I think we should go back since you have a lot of things on your plate.”</p>
<p>Lacias only responded by burying his face on her shoulder, shaking his head like a disobedient child. Under the faint glow of the moonlight, their bodies casted one, fused shadow on the ground.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to act like a child, but I just can’t help it when I’m with you.” Lacias said, his blue eyes resembling the sea.</p>
<p>Lila found him adorable. As she basked in the warmth from being hugged behind, she suddenly remembered what she came here for, “Wait, I almost forgot something.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you come here to see me?” Lacias asked behind her.</p>
<p>“Yes, but I also came because there’s something I want to give you.”</p>
<p>“For me?” His eyes twinkled in curiosity. The way he reacted was exactly the way Hir does whenever sweet desserts were placed in front of him. Lila smiled at their similarities. She took out the box she tried to keep hidden and it was quite big in size, so it was surprising that Lacias didn’t see it right away. Lacias’ eyes widened at the package, “What’s this?”</p>
<p>“My gift. Go open it.” Lila urged, placing the box on Lacias’ lap.</p>
<p>Lacias looked down at the gift Lila had prepared for him, staring at it without saying anything.</p>
<p>“Why are you not opening it?”</p>
<p>But still, Lacias remained unmoving, only staring at it as if he didn’t hear her. Growing impatient, Lila stretched her hands to open the box for him when Lacias spoke,</p>
<p>“Ah… Wait.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to open it?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>“Wait… Ahh… I’m so nervous.” Lacias chuckled.</p>
<p>Lila looked at him confusedly. How could a gift make him so nervous? Lacias’ posture stiffened, and Lila realized he was not joking.</p>
<p>“I’m nervous because you’re the one who gave it to me. I don’t think I could open it easily.” Lacias skimmed the box delicately as if he was afraid of breaking it.</p>
<p>“But I want you to open it right now. I want to see your reaction.” Lila nudged him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Lacias finally made up his mind and reached for the ribbon, pulling its end and tugging it loose. He carefully opened the lid and his eyes widened at what he saw.</p>
<p>“Lila… this is…”</p>
<p>“It’s a gun. This is inspired by the gift you gave me. My ring is embedded in the barrel’s shaft, but it wouldn’t be a hindrance at all in regards to its functionality.”</p>
<p>Lacias didn’t say anything as he turned the gun over, angling it to see its beauty at all sides.</p>
<p>“Is this why you called the craftsman?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. Do you like it?”</p>
<p>“How can I not?”</p>
<p>Lila smiled at his appreciation, “You seem really happy with my gift.”</p>
<p>He was just like a child who had received a pile of presents on Children’s Day, and he couldn’t stop looking at it as he focused on Lila’s white ring through the barrel.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you like it, Lacias.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much.” The sincerity in his words was music to Lila’s ears.</p>
<p>“You also gave ma special gift, remember? I wanted to give this to you before the wedding, and I gave Hir something, too. You could go see it for yourself when you still have the time.”</p>
<p>“I guess I’ll be busy after the wedding.” He playfully said.</p>
<p><em>Wedding. Marriage. </em>Both of them chanted the words internally, the weight of the words dawning on them.</p>
<p><em>Tomorrow is the day. It’s finally come.</em></p>
<p>Lila recalled the first time she met Lacias. She remembered how nervous she was then because of what she read in the original novel. She never imagined for things to turn out like this.</p>
<p>A relationship bound by contract. They didn’t say it out loud, but both of them were aware and sure of each other’s feelings.</p>
<p>And even though Lila would have to end the relationship herself, she still wants to enjoy the present while she still can.</p>
<p>The more her love grew, the more greedy she had become. She began to long for things she shouldn’t be longing for in the first place, and she couldn’t bring herself to stop. Lila was tempted to turn around and pull Lacias into a hug.</p>
<p>“Hm…” Lacias studied the gun as he held onto it tightly and leaned closer to Lila.</p>
<p>Lila stiffened at the touch, finding herself tensed especially when she had been thinking of hugging him a few moments ago.</p>
<p>Lila slightly shook her head, making the hair curled on the back of her neck fall in waves. Lacias tilted his head and glanced at her hair. He raised his hand and smoothened her tresses.</p>
<p>“… What are you doing?” Lila asked while Lacias absently stroked her head. He twirled a lock of hair with his fingers, finding it soft to the touch.</p>
<p>“It tickles.” She said when Lacias continued with his ministrations. Lila twisted her body to avoid his touch, “Lacias?”</p>
<p>She thought he would stop doing it, but he was still playing with her locks with his fingers. <em>What was he doing?</em></p>
<p>Lila was about to turn around when Lacias gently placed a soft kiss on the hair he’s been twirling. It was an action that showed reverence and respect.</p>
<p>A small gasp escaped Lila’s lips. Lacias shifted and fixed his gaze on her face, kissing her locks once again. For some reason, Lacias’ blue eyes turned a shade darker, making Lila’s heart pound fast.</p>
<p><em>It feels strange. </em>Her heart was beating too loudly. Then, she felt a tickling sensation climbing to her waist.</p>
<p>“Lila.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Lila Wipere.” Lacias said reverently.</p>
<p>She hummed.</p>
<p>“My Lila…” Lacias chanted her name over and over again, not minding Lila’s lack of response.</p>
<p>“Lila.” They locked eyes with each other. Lacias wanted to see himself reflected back in her beautiful, transparent eyes. Even though she will bear his surname starting tomorrow, he felt impatient still, wanting to possess her fully.</p>
<p><em>Just a little bit more.</em></p>
<p>Unable to hold her gaze any longer, Lacias burrowed his face into her shoulder, Lila’s scent invading his senses. While she used the bath essentials provided by the Wipere family, her sweet, fruity scent still triumphs over it, and no shampoo nor gel would rid of her scent completely.</p>
<p>“I really love your scent…” Lacias said. He felt something inside him brewing; something unfamiliar, so intense that he found it almost unbearable.</p>
