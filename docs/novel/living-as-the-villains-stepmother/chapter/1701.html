            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 91 – A Dead Man’s Possession (1)</strong></p>
<p>A beat of silence passed between them. Lila glanced at Lacias and saw the sharpness in his eyes as he stared at nothing in particular, knowing for a fact that his mind was whirring with thoughts after what she had told him. She immediately reached out for him and patted his back in a reassuring manner. “You don’t have to worry since I will never see him again.”</p>
<p>His eyes refocused upon hearing Lila’s words. He turned to look at her and asked, “Why?”</p>
<p>“Uhm…” Lila hesitated for a brief moment, gathering her thoughts together before responding. “Because he’s dead.”</p>
<p>Of course he’s dead. She died with him in a fire accident, afterwards, she woke up as Madame Marshmell. The last time she had seen him, he was sprawled on the ground, getting caught in the middle of an explosion. He would most likely be dead, just like her body was.</p>
<p>Lila stressed, “Yes. He’s dead.”</p>
<p>Father, Mrs. Marshmell’s family, everyone around her was dead anyway.</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear.” Lacias buried his face into Lila’s shoulder. His lips glided on her skin affectionately and with no restraint. Lila felt how soft his lips were as it was pressed firmly on her shoulder, slightly shivering at the contact that she subtly tried to shrug him off of her but to no avail, Lacias only pressing even more closer. “That man sure is lucky.” He mumbled against her skin.</p>
<p>Lila didn’t hear him clearly. “ Huh? What did you just say?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>Lila was sure it wasn’t nothing. She definitely heard him say something but it came out muffled. She prodded him but Lacias remained unspeaking, like he himself was convinced that he didn’t utter a single word. Realizing he wouldn’t budge, Lila decided to just let it go. “Let’s go now. It’s about time we head inside.”</p>
<p>“But…” Lacias said agonizingly. Body hunched as he slowly got up like it was a painstaking effort. Even a tortoise wasn’t that sluggish compared to how he was acting. A small pout formed on his lips and Lila impatiently pushed him from the waist.</p>
<p>“Wait, Lila. Wait for a bit, will you? Hey. Stop.” The words stumbled out of him. Lila used all the strength she could muster to steer him out of the garden but Lacias was rock solid on his spot, unmoving and firmly planted like an age old tree.</p>
<p>“Why are you being stubborn?” Lila huffed, slightly out of breath.</p>
<p>Lacias chuckled at the disheveled-looking Lila. “I was surprised…”</p>
<p>“Let go now.” Lila said strictly.</p>
<p>This time, Lacias wasn’t able to rein his laughter in as he sniggered heartily. “Let go of what?” He had his hands wrapped around hers, tightly holding onto her that Lila couldn’t shake him off.</p>
<p>“What do you mean what? My hand of course. Let go right this second.” Lila admonished, but Lacias only shook his head, completely unfazed.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to. Hug me just a bit more.”</p>
<p>Lila almost rolled her eyes. “I thought you wanted me to stop? You change your mind too quickly.”</p>
<p>He burrowed his face into her nape. “Only for you, Madame.” He whispered directly to her ear. He went on as if he didn’t hear her and proceeded to hug her in a tight grip, rubbing his cheeks on her shoulder like a puppy cuddling with its owner. The only difference between the two was Lacias was way too tall to be considered a puppy.</p>
<p>Lila sighed, no longer struggling in Lacias’ grip as it was a waste of her effort. Lacias took in a much comfortable position by further burying himself into her embrace, and breathed in satisfaction.</p>
<p>“How long are you going to stay in this position?” Lila asked in a flat voice.</p>
<p>“Until sunset.” Lacias replied without a second thought.</p>
<p>Lila scoffed. “Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>“How coldhearted.” After a few passing minutes, Lacias finally let go of Lila. He knew it would be too troublesome to walk with a full-grown man latched on her waist.</p>
<p>Her waist ached after sitting on the swing for quite a while. She twisted her body left and right to ease the soreness, and Lacias took notice right away. “Are you okay?” He asked worriedly.</p>
<p>Lila was at a loss for words. Was he really asking her if she was okay, after ignoring her pleas of protests? She snorted and paid him no attention as they headed straight to Lila’s bedroom.</p>
<p>“Go get some rest if you’re not feeling well.” Lacias said when they reached the bedroom.</p>
<p>“I didn’t come here to rest.” Lila walked towards the small bedside table where the document was placed. She came here specifically to show Lacias the document, having no plans to lie in bed so early in the afternoon.</p>
<p>She knew that Lacias would only express his disapproval once she began talking about work, but as much as he wanted to put it off, it was something that couldn’t be helped since they were tied to work after all.</p>
<p>Lila went over their schedule in her head as she read the document, but Lacias’ attention was elsewhere. He tipped his head towards the bed and said, “You have violet blankets.”</p>
<p>Lila blinked, caught off guard at the randomness of the statement. She briefly glanced at her blanket and saw that it was indeed, violet. “It is.”</p>
<p>“It looks pretty just like your eyes, Lila. I like it. Maybe I should change my blanket too.” Lacias concluded. Did he really like it that much? It was just an ordinary purple blanket, nothing special— at least to Lila anyway.</p>
<p>Lacias carefully brushed the blanket, smoothing the creases until it flattened under his palm. “Or should we take this one instead?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Lila’s eyebrow raised in confusion. If he took this one, what else would she sleep under?</p>
<p>Lacias saw the puzzlement in her expression and let out a soft laugh. “I’m not forcing you to decide right now.” He assured before continuing, “How about we use it together once you move into my mansion?”</p>
