            <p><strong>Chapter 206</strong></p>
<p>Before Lila could continue the praise Hir’s ring turned back and enveloped her ring. Even with his eyes shut he could steel feel the movements of Lila’s ring as if it were in front of him.</p>
<p>She patted Hir on the head as he opened his eyes. “I knew you could do it Hir! Did you realize how you caught my ring just now?”</p>
<p>“Um… Uhh…?” He still seemed a little confused about how exactly he caught Lila’s ring but from just seeing Lila’s broad smile he knew something incredible just happened.</p>
<p>“I think I get it now! I think I now understand how I should sense the ring!” He finally exclaimed.</p>
<p>Lila bent down and hugged her son proudly. “My Hir must be a genius.”</p>
<p>“N- no… That’s too much…,” he said with a blushing face.</p>
<p>Lila got back up and looked him directly in the eye. “You deserve praise for what you did, Hir. You did a great job! It was your first try too!”</p>
<p>“I do…?”</p>
<p>“Creating a ring itself is difficult in itself but look at you! I am so very proud of you, Hir.”</p>
<p>“Hehe….”</p>
<p>His already red cheeks turned even redder.</p>
<p>“Hir, you managed to detect my ring and catch it at once. Remember that feeling and try to read Lugar’s energy as you move your ring around.”</p>
<p>“Will I be able to figure out whose ring it is later on?” asked Hir.</p>
<p>“Of course, you will. I personally think you’ll learn to do that very soon, or even today.”</p>
<p>“Wow, hehe.”</p>
<p>“Should we start searching again?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Hir’s confidence seemed to have reached its peak, and he was no longer hesitant or anxious as he was earlier. He was focusing on his senses to read Lugar’s energy, and this time, he sent his ring in many different directions.</p>
<p>And indeed, in a short period of time, he found one of them.</p>
<p>Lugar’s ring, well hidden in the green leaves of a tall tree, would have been difficult for the average person to find. But to Hir, it was no problem.</p>
<p>“Mo- mother! I found one!”</p>
<p>Lila smiled mischievously, she knew it was only a matter of time. “Destroy it.”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p><em>Pop</em>! The ring was gone.</p>
<p>Lila wasn’t sure how many of Lugar’s rings Hizette found so far, but there was no way he found less than them, which was one. After some thinking, Lila came up with an idea. “Hir, why don’t we split up and meet again here?”</p>
<p>“But what if we come back at different times?”</p>
<p>“We have our ring. When we want to meet up, we can shoot the ring high into the sky. That will be our sign, okay?” She wanted them to communicate using their rings as flares.</p>
<p>“Oh, I see… Okay!”</p>
<p>As the game continued, Lila’s desire to win gradually became bigger. Besides, the fact that she had not yet found a single ring bothered her.</p>
<p><em>I have to move fast, or Hizette will find all of them.</em></p>
<p>Lila waved at Hir who waved back.</p>
<p>“Mother, let’s do this!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Hir!” The competitive spirit was brewing in both of them. However, Lila didn’t want to forget the real reason she was there. “Even if you end up with no rings don’t be discouraged. We can find them together.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“And don’t go anywhere that looks dangerous.” reminded Lila. “Always call me first.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry!”</p>
<p>After parting ways, Lila immediately sprung into action. She was almost running as she already had a place in mind.</p>
<p><em>Lugar might have hidden his ring there again. I should go and check.</em></p>
<p>It was like an underground warehouse where very dark and unpleasant energy was creeping up.</p>
<p>For some reason, Lila had a feeling that Lugar had hidden his ring in the same place twice.</p>
<h3><strong>***</strong></h3>
<p>The underground warehouse had a much gloomier and more malodorous atmosphere than Lila remembered.</p>
<p>The unpleasant smell that hit her nose made her reluctant to step inside.</p>
<p>“Judging from the outside I don’t think anything has changed since then,” said Lila to herself. “But what’s that smell?”</p>
<p><em>Something has changed, for sure.</em></p>
<p>Lila frowned a little and looked around the entrance, hesitating whether to go inside.</p>
<p><em>But I don’t see anything particular that’s different from last time. </em>The warehouse looked the same to her, but she couldn’t shake off the unpleasant feeling. Questioning her random fear, Lila slowly went inside.</p>
<p>Lila wandered under the stairs for a long time but didn’t seem to find anything. “Hmm. Last time, Lugar hid it here somewhere.”</p>
<p>Eventually, she reached a room with an unpainted door. This made Lila reconsider.</p>
<p><em>I shouldn’t go in more.</em></p>
<p>Lacias once told her about a family heirloom stored in that room and she remembered the door being tightly shut the last time she was there.</p>
<p>“Lugar wouldn’t have hidden his ring inside the room where the heirloom is kept.”</p>
<p><em>But come to think of it, Lugar isn’t stupid enough to hide his room in the same place.</em></p>
<p>Just when Lila was about to turn and leave the warehouse something caught her eye.</p>
<p>The door, which had been firmly closed, was left slightly open, that’s what changed from last time. She thought if she was to bring her face close to the door, she would be able to see inside through the gap.</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>Lila could feel right away that the mysterious, gloomy air that filled the room was coming out of the door. This only made her more curious.</p>
<p>“So the heirloom is there, but I’m not sure if I can go inside.”</p>
<p><em>Lacias talked as if the heirloom was a trivial thing, so won’t it be okay to take a quick look at it? But if it were really a trivial thing, wouldn’t Lacias have shown it to me in the first place?</em></p>
<p>Lila’s mind was split apart.</p>
<p><em>No, my position now is different from before. I was just a fiancee back then, but now I’m the duchess of the Wipere. And If it was something really important, they wouldn’t have put it in an underground warehouse with no security system. And the door wouldn’t have been left open.</em></p>
<p>Lila nodded as she organized her thoughts. She concluded that checking the heirloom as the duchess won’t be a problem.</p>
