            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 72 – Diamonds and Frills (1)</strong></p>
<p>Lila caught a pair of petite eyes staring at her in her peripheral vision. She glanced back to be met with Hir’s marvelous black eyes and a cute smile.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Hir?”</p>
<p>“I am worried.” He replied reluctantly.</p>
<p>Lila had tried to change the subject at first but said honest words. Hir shrunk visibly at Lila’s presence.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I did not mean for you to worry.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. You let me in.” Lila drank one of the two mugs and the sweetness of the milk made her forget all her worries for just a moment. She held the other cup to the boy next to her. “It’s milk with honey, which is sweet and delicious. It will clear your head.”</p>
<p>He grabbed the cup tightly and felt a comforting warmth coming through it. He felt at rest with Lila thinking about him in the same room. <em>Things really have changed.</em></p>
<p>Hir was calm while Lila sat in front of him without speaking, which made her want to adjust to the current situation. Hir’s memory loss helped Lila think of things, and his lips opened when Lila sipped her milk.</p>
<p>“When we went to the lake … ?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” She replied after hurriedly drinking the milk in her mouth.</p>
<p>“Did really nothing happen that day … ?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember anything after almost falling in the lake. It’s strange, right?”</p>
<p>Hir seemed confused, but Lila could not explain the situation honestly, as the doctor had advised that Hir not know it until he became healthier. She had to lie to Hir, and her eyes wavered at the fact. It reminded her of how Lacias would have answered without even blinking. She wished he were here so she could avoid Hir’s innocent gaze.</p>
<p>“That’s because you were too surprised, and you should focus on getting healthier rather than thinking too much.”</p>
<p>There was clear uncertainty in Lila’s voice, but Hir seemed unsuspicious nonetheless. However, his lips were pouting. Lila couldn’t help but ask again.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s too strange.”  Hir lowered his head steadily. “I feel weird after that day.”</p>
<p>Lila had faintly heard Hir’s murmur. “What did you say, Hir?” She asked wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>Lila felt a little confused by his response and although she still felt surprised by his behaviour she concluded that it would be best if she didn’t overreact and press on him further.</p>
<p>“I heard that sweets would make you happier, so why don’t you try some?” She offered, trying to distract him.</p>
<p>She didn’t have the faith to continue lying to him so Lila tried her best to change the subject once again. Luckily, Hir took the bait and turned his gaze towards the marshmallows and melted chocolate.</p>
<p>“You made them?”</p>
<p>Lila finally felt relieved. “Of course, do you like them?”</p>
<p>“Yes! I knew you were the one who made them at first glance.”</p>
<p>Their tastes in sweets were very similar so they both knew what the other liked or made very well.</p>
<p>“Thank you, I melted milk chocolate and added some marshmallows on top to go with it. It’s very sweet if you’d like to have some. However, you cannot have too much, alright?”</p>
<p>“But it sounds so delicious, why can’t I?” He pleaded.</p>
<p>Lila lowered her voice to tease Hir with a smile.</p>
<p>“It’s because.”</p>
<p>“Because?” Hir gulped as he waited.</p>
<p>“If you put on weight with marshmallows, you won’t lose it even after running around the Wipere manor a hundred times.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“You will be rolling on the floor.” Her eyes were full of mischief, a small smile settling on her lips.</p>
<p>“I don’t want that!”</p>
<p>“Then, let’s have only some.”</p>
<p>“Yes, all right.” Hir looked back at the marshmallows like a demon’s meal.</p>
<p>Lila noticed his glare and felt a little uneasy. <em>I have to say these things because Jane nags me for feeding Hir too many desserts.</em></p>
<p>The feeling was quickly replaced with happiness as she watched Hir adorably picking up a marshmallow and plopping it whole into his mouth. He must have loved it.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Lila looked at the now familiar Viscount manor, which she would now own. While Lila Marshmell owned this house, she would pass ownership to Hir before leaving. When the time came, Hir would be completely separated from the Marshmell family.</p>
<p><em>This will be an empty house for a while. Is there any way to prevent that?</em></p>
<p>The manor was well preserved now, but it would begin to deteriorate after a year. She wished she could rent houses, it would be perfect because the house would not go to waste and Hir would be able to receive some money from her. The problem was however, those rich enough to live in such a house would not want to rent as they would not want rumors to spread about not being able to purchase a house of their own.</p>
<p>She thought about renting the house to a rich merchant, but she was reminded by the fact that no merchant would want to live in it for less than a year. Lila would need to ask Hir later about what he wanted to do with the old house, and she would follow his decision. Lila thought about the day with some sadness and got onto the carriage after checking the manor.</p>
<p>Lila soon after arrived at a salon at the centre of the city, her eyes widened at the extravagant scenery before her. The road was filled with beautifully designed high-quality shops. She couldn’t believe that she was able to see this with her own eyes. She headed straight towards the boutique shop soon after taking in the moment.</p>
<p><em>Camerline hasn’t arrived yet, right?</em></p>
