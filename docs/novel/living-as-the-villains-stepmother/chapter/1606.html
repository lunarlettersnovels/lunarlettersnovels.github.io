            <p><strong>Chapter 186 – Of the Past (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Haha! I love the look on your face!” Doug Blake couldn’t stop laughing at the thought that Lila had finally figured out who he was. But after a few more chuckles he started with his typical condescending tone from his previous life.</p>
<p>“At first, I resented you for bringing me to this world. But as I got used to it, my thoughts changed. I didn’t resent you anymore, my daughter. Although you’ve always been unhelpful, you gave me a new life. Who would have thought you would give me such a splendid life!”</p>
<p>Doug Blake smiled. He looked very happy.</p>
<p>Lila’s flinty eyes scanned the man’s face.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing in this world that you can’t do with your status. I have overflowing money, and people look at me and bow their heads! You, too, seem to be having a good time, so let’s work together and go up even higher. You should help me a little more.”</p>
<p>“Help? You?” She couldn’t believe what she was hearing from him.</p>
<p>“Yes! Now I feel like being a baron isn’t enough. You’re the Duchess of the Empire while your father is just a baron. There are a few nobles who interact with me. It makes me so mad every time they try to suppress me with their status. But my daughter has a higher status than most people in this empire! How could I just live as Baron Blake when I’m your father?”</p>
<p>Doug Blake didn’t notice Lila’s cold tone of voice. He seemed very convinced that Lila would agree to work together with him.</p>
<p>This time it was Lila’s turn to let out a snicker. “Hey, Baron. I don’t think you belong here at my wedding hall. Instead, I suggest you go see a doctor, because what you’re saying is absolute nonsense.”</p>
<p>“…What?” He wasn’t ready for his daughter to go against him so quickly.</p>
<p>“You’re paranoid, and it looks like you have no idea what you’re talking about. Today’s a good day, and you should know that I’ve put up with your rudeness only because you’re mentally ill, Baron.”</p>
<p>“Daughter. Are you out of your mind? I’m your father!”</p>
<p>She couldn’t handle listening to the delusional man any longer so she pulled out her trusty weapon from a hidden pocket within her dress. It was the milky-white gun she had held a thousand times to practice her ring.</p>
<p>“I won’t tolerate any further disrespect.”</p>
<p>The baron flinched a little at her sudden draw but he still stood his ground meagerly.</p>
<p>“You seem to have lost your mind after losing your daughter, but you shouldn’t be looking for her here. I won’t put up with your madness any longer.” said Lila, as she put away her gun. She didn’t feel comfortable using it on her wedding day,</p>
<p>Lila noticed his lips slightly trembling before they parted ways to spout whatever nonsense they had left.</p>
<p>“Right, duchess. When you were in school, you joined a shooting club. The skills you learned back then, ar- are those still there?” Realizing that things were not going the way he wanted, Doug Blake started using honorifics again. Lila became a little less nervous.</p>
<p><em>You’re doing great. I have to keep pretending like I don’t know anything.</em></p>
<p>Just then, Lila felt a weak wave in her necklace.</p>
<p><em>Lacias is coming. He must have realized by now that I disappeared.</em></p>
<p>Now that she knew Lacias was on his way all Lila wanted to do was stall until he appeared, and so far she was doing surprisingly well.</p>
<p>“Baron. Your tone suddenly changed. I hope you’re convinced that I’m not your daughter.”</p>
<p>“It’s….” His confidence was fading with every word.</p>
<p>“It’s what? Are there rumors circulating that I became the Duchess of the Empire by chance? Aren’t you trying to convince me to believe that I’m your daughter because of your greed for a high status?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s-!”</p>
<p>“I could have concluded that being a daughter of Baron Blake would be better than listening to others gossiping about my humble status. But I’m not dissatisfied with my birth, and I do not care about what other people talk about me because they have nothing to do with me. You made a mistake, Baron Blake. And you were very rude about it.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I would have at least listened to you if you offered me a deal openly.” She put up the act the best possible way she could.</p>
<p>Doug Blake looked confused. It seemed like he wasn’t sure whether she was acting or not.</p>
<p>Just on cue, Lila felt the aura in her necklace move faster than ever.</p>
<p><em>It’s him.</em></p>
<p>She could hear the sound of a person climbing down the stairs and that person could only have been Lacias. No one would run up the stairs of the wedding hall with such loud steps, especially at the wedding of the Duke of Wipere.</p>
<p>Even though his footsteps were quite loud, Doug Blake didn’t seem to catch them. Perhaps he was too entangled in his thinking that nothing came into his ear.</p>
<p>Lila reminded herself not to share her conversation with the baron for the sake of not amassing any confusion.</p>
<p>Just then, a gentle voice was heard. “Lila, it’s okay. Come over here.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><em>I still can’t believe Doug Blake is my father in my previous life. The person I wanted to take my revenge on, the person I hated so much.</em></p>
<p>Lying down on the bed and staring into space, Lila felt a mix of emotions.</p>
<p><em>What do I want to do?</em></p>
<p>Doug Blake threatened her on her wedding day, and he also tried to frame the Duke of Wipere through various tricks. He was soon going to be put on a noble trial.</p>
<p><em>Am I satisfied with that?</em></p>
<p>Thinking of how she lived in her previous life, she didn’t want to let her father go like that.</p>
<p><em>But that’s when I had nothing to lose, and now I have too many people who I love. But… How could I forgive him?</em></p>
<p>The memory of being abused as a child still remained vivid in her mind. No amount of love and care could erase them. This was how she could relate to Hir. The things Mrs. Marshmell did to him couldn’t be erased either. It was also the reason why she tried to leave Hir’s side.</p>
<p><em><strong>Knock. Knock.</strong></em></p>
<p>A series of steady door knocks halted her train of thought.</p>
<p>“Lila, it’s me. I heard you made all the maids leave early. Are you okay? Can I come in?” It was Lacias. Even though a lot had happened today, he was still only concerned about his wife’s well-being.</p>
