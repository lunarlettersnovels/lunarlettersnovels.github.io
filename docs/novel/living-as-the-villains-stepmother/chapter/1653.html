            <p><strong>Chapter 139 – Newfound Feelings (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>How can he still look so calm after saying that?</em></p>
<p>Lila hated how it was only her that blushed when he said such things. She could almost feel her heart in her throat as it was jumping madly inside her. There was nothing she could do but to hope that he wouldn’t take notice or even hear the pounding of her heart.</p>
<p><em>Or can he hear me? Is that why he’s smiling right now? </em>It was hard to tell from his face as he was only smiling amicably.</p>
<p>Lila blamed her heart for being only conspicuous at times like this as she hardly felt its presence most of the time. Even worse, every one of her organs was now practically refusing to obey her brain’s command.</p>
<p><em>Cheeks, stop the blush. Heart stop bouncing. And eyes, try to remain calm. Everyone, just keep your cool and pretend like nothing happened!</em></p>
<p>But despite all her commands, her cheeks only got redder, the beating of her heart only got louder, and her eyes wandered aimlessly as she could no longer look straight into Lacias’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I wonder when my beloved wife will finally give her reply to my confession.” Said Lacias aimlessly.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea how long I’ve been waiting?”</p>
<p>Lila suddenly noticed his hand reaching out to her cheek.</p>
<p><em>I must dodge. </em>She was worried that her heart might explode if his hands actually stroked her cheeks. But regardless of her thoughts, Lila’s head remained still as her cheeks refused to listen.</p>
<p>Despite her alertness, Lacias continued questioning. “What am I supposed to do? Please tell me.”</p>
<p>“Tell you about what….” She never felt such extreme emotions in her past life so it was completely new to her. Although rage had always filled her mind whenever she was abused by her father, she later had become too used to it and she somehow taught herself how to bottle up the feelings inside her.</p>
<p>“You really don’t know?” He stopped when his hand was only an inch away from touching her cheeks.</p>
<p>With his hand hung in the air, he moved it as if he really was stroking at her cheek. And as his gaze fell onto her face, Lila felt her cheeks heating up to the point where she couldn’t tell if he was touching her or not.</p>
<p>“About how to win your affection of course. Shall I be asking Hir about it instead?”</p>
<p>Lila couldn’t seem to part her lips to make any sound, it was like he glued them shut. <em>I think my whole body’s gone numb, I can’t seem to move at all…. </em>Her eyes seemed to flutter against her will.</p>
<p>“Umm, but the kind of affection I desire is completely different from the kind you give to Hir,” added Lacias, proving that Hir’s answer wouldn’t be much help to him in the end.</p>
<p><em>Was I always this bad with words? </em>Looking absolutely dazed, the ends of her hands continued to tense up and relax repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you just give me your answer?”</p>
<p><em>I can’t because I have no idea! Besides, my lips just won’t part! </em>She wished that her mind could speak for her, but her lips stayed shut.</p>
<p>“I guess you want me to figure it out by myself then. Well, that’s fine too actually. It’s not like I’m not confident anyway.”</p>
<p><em>But my heart is already….</em></p>
<p>“In fact, it will be considered cheating to ask you directly about it. Although I don’t see any harm in cheating in this case.”</p>
<p>Lacias stepped away from her as he spoke. It was a swift change in his attitude considering that they were so close to hearing each other’s breath just a moment ago.</p>
<p>“Where should we go on our next excursion? I’m fine anywhere. What about you, Lila? Do you want someplace specific? Somewhere with a clear blue lake or somewhere full of fresh greens?</p>
<p>“…I’m fine with either.” The glue finally seemed to wear off as he distanced himself from her.</p>
<p>“Lila, I’m asking for <em>your</em> preference.”</p>
<p>Although she really meant what she just said, Lacias didn’t seem to be satisfied with her answer.</p>
<p>“I want to know more about you.” He continued. “So I really wish you would tell me what you like and hate.”</p>
<p>“Umm….” Lila took her time in musing. Since she’d never particularly thought about her preferences before, she found it hard to pick just one place.</p>
<p><em>What do I like? </em>She thought to herself. <em>Where do I want to go? To the lakeside? Or a greenfield?</em></p>
<p>“I really like them all…” She responded after a long moment. “But … I think I liked to watch it snow more than anything else.”</p>
<p>She remembered how much she liked snowy days in comparison to sunny ones and the sight of snowflakes piling up into a white field always fascinated her greatly.</p>
<p>Lila thought about just how marvelous it was for the snow crystals to fall from the sky, just to melt away helplessly from the warmth of a touch.</p>
<p>“Snow, I see.” Lacias tersely clicked his tongue along with a wistful sigh.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” she asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“There’s no winter here in the Ahibalt Empire.”</p>
<p>“Ah….” Lila was well aware of that fact as well. However, the thought didn’t come across her mind as the image of snow had unwittingly occurred in her mind all of sudden. “You’re right. It’s a shame that there’s no winter here in the empire.”</p>
<p>“You must have seen it snow before.” He asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Umm, yes. In the remote past.”</p>
<p>Lacias then tilted his head to the side again and leaned his upper body towards her. “Really? When and where?”</p>
<p>“Where was it….” How would Lacias respond if she told him that she’d seen it snow in a place he will never know about?</p>
<p>“Have you ever been to the Nixon kingdom before?”</p>
<p>“Nixon?” <em>Where did I hear that before? </em>Pondered Lila. <em>Ah, now I remember. </em>She had once received a travel pass from Countess Fasha before, and that place was the Nixon Kingdom.</p>
