            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 54 – A Special Acquaintance (2)</strong></p>
<p>The emperor laughed awkwardly trying to keep his strong personality in place. But Lila’s speech made it very hard.</p>
<p>“I am hurt and discomforted at your certainty that I am your pet.” Her dry and quiet voice made Enrique rumple his hair. He couldn’t stand not having complete control.</p>
<p>“I’ll admit, you’re sharper than my lost cat.”</p>
<p>“I find your expressions also discomforting. Please apologize.”</p>
<p>“Right, right. I am sorry. Are you satisfied?” He said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Lila’s mouth hardened at the emperor’s insincere words. However, she was satisfied with her victory. “I have to go now, as my servants would have not calmed down yet at your unexpected visit.”</p>
<p>“Well.” Enrique’s eyes shone murkily as he mumbled something in an irritated manner. “You cannot return yet.”</p>
<p>Lila almost asked him why, but instead, bit down a sigh. She could see the look of desire in his eyes. He only brought her here for one thing and one thing alone.</p>
<p><em>He wants my ring since the ring Madame Marshmell had purified has been already contaminated.</em></p>
<p>She estimated that Enrique and Madame Marshmell had known each other long before she was married to the Viscount, as she was not in a position to commit adultery. Enrique would have not tried to meet her until his ring was contaminated again, which meant that he would not have had access to a purified ring in a long time.</p>
<p><em>So, he must have been desperate enough to come to me at this time.</em></p>
<p>Since Lila had not yet claimed her Duchess title this was the perfect time for him to abduct her. She had to think of something quick.</p>
<p>“I hope that the misunderstanding has been solved.”</p>
<p>“What misunderstanding?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty had mentioned that you were looking for your cat.”</p>
<p>“That is right.” He sounded impatient waiting for her to get to the point.</p>
<p>“However, I am not your cat, and this is the first time in my life that I have seen Your Grace.”</p>
<p>The emperor snickered to himself. “Regardless I need you now and have no intention of letting you go-.”</p>
<p>Before he could continue his sentence Lila cut him off and spoke with a dry voice. “And?”</p>
<p>“What?” He was still processing how the woman before him had just stopped him mid-speech.</p>
<p>“Regardless of your intentions, I am not your bird in a cage. As you can see, I have two functioning legs.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t hide his look of surprise anymore, he decided to stay silent to make sure his emotions don’t slip any more than that.</p>
<p>“I will walk out, and please forgive me for standing up first.”</p>
<p>“Wait.” Lila swiftly dodged his attempt in grabbing her. “Since I have forgiven your acts, please do not cross the line again.” She said, slowly turning around and bowing politely.</p>
<p>Enrique looked back at her with a vacant expression, his ring was so close yet so far. His eyes shone with the desire to possess, so he stood up for his final attempt. He got up and ran in front of Lila’s path. He lost all of his shame.</p>
<p>“All right, I lose.”</p>
<p>“?”</p>
<p>What did he mean by that? Lila watched Enrique closely as he continued to stand in front of her.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it to you.”</p>
<p>“What are you giving me?”</p>
<p>Enrique narrowed and rubbed his face. “I’ll give you what you always wanted.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“I will give you what you have always wanted from me, so stop sulking.” Enrique smiled while whispering it so close to her ear. She felt uncomfortable but she had to stay strong.</p>
<p><em>What is he talking about? And how am I sulking?</em></p>
<p>Lila slowly stepped back.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I do not know what you’re talking about, and I have no wish to have anything from you.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Enrique laughed at Lila’s refusal, he couldn’t believe that she didn’t want something from him. The man who could have everything.</p>
<p>“Ha”</p>
<p>Enrique’s eyes deepened in a possessive desire darkened, he silently asked Lila a question.</p>
<p>“How would you feel … if your cat followed another owner?”</p>
<p>Lila thought it over and answered like it had been a trivial question.</p>
<p>“If I took care of the cat properly she would have never left in the first place. If she were to leave I would respect her decision and admit to being a bad owner.”</p>
<p>The emperor was surprised by the sharp answer. <em>She has gained some wit over the time of her leav</em>e. He thought to himself.</p>
<p>“If you want to do things like this-”</p>
<p>A scream rang out from behind the room door. “You cannot go in without approval! Duke Wipere!”</p>
<p>Both Enrique and Lila both turned towards the source at the same time as it continued.</p>
<p>“Your Highness! You can’t!”</p>
