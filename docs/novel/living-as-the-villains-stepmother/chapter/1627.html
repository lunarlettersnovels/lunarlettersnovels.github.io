            <p><strong>Chapter 165</strong></p>
<p>The heavy, layered dress felt very uncomfortable. But Lila was not in the position to complain since the wedding and the dress itself served as the symbols of the Duke of Wipere’s prestige. Just thinking about the gossip it would cause within the aristocratic society should she wear a simple dress was enough to give her a headache. Expensive jewelry was all over her, and it sparkled under the bright lights whenever Lila moved. The gemstones were sewn into intricate patterns, so dazzling that anyone who ever saw the dress would know it was done meticulously.</p>
<p>“Are you okay? Your hands are cold.”</p>
<p>“I’m okay.” Lila muttered.</p>
<p>“I’m worried.”</p>
<p>Lacias studied the worried eyes before him while holding Lila’s hands tightly in gloves. Her slightly cold hands prompted him to look down at them, although it was an almost negligible change he was sensitive to it.</p>
<p>“No need to be nervous.” He reassured, “I’ll be with you throughout the whole ceremony.”</p>
<p>“Right, I’m not nervous. Hir visited me earlier and he probably came to see me because he was worried about me.”</p>
<p>“How thoughtful of him.”</p>
<p>Despite Lacias being there when Hir went to check on her, he responded as if it was new information. He knew very well that it wouldn’t be a good idea to tell her that he was there as well, it would not be considered ‘cute’ like if a child checked on her.</p>
<p>“I thought he was shy.” Continued Lacias, “but he actually has a pretty manly side. He should have been with Hizette, but he must have convinced the knight to leave.”</p>
<p>Lila laughed at the thought of Hir convincing someone. “I guess he somehow persuaded him. He must have a strategist personality”</p>
<p>“Haha. If that’s what you think, I should bring him to the Duke’s Budgeting Meeting next time.”</p>
<p>“Early education is not bad,” said Lila. “It would definitely be a great experience. Of course, on the premise that Hir wants it.”</p>
<p>“Aha. I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“I mean… There’s nothing a kid can do at that meeting, but its the experience that counts.”</p>
<p>“I agree. I also think that we should always follow your opinion without questioning.”</p>
<p>“Haha, really?”</p>
<p>During the short conversation Lacias held Lila’s hand a little tighter, her cold hand slowly returned to a normal temperature. Noticing that, Lacias’s smile grew slightly wider, but he didn’t tell Lila about it since she could get nervous again.</p>
<p>Lila stood still before the hall entrance. “It feels strange … that this day really came.”</p>
<p>She could hear the faint discussions of the guests on the other side of the hall, with the comforting sounds Lila’s surroundings suddenly became more vivid. Many people had come to bless their marriage and she was thankful for them.</p>
<p>“I also feel the same,” said Lacias, bringing her back to reality. “Thanks to you, a lot has changed, and I’ve experienced various things in my life.”</p>
<p>“Umm….”</p>
<p>Lila watched their clasped hands for a while before answering. Lacias also turned his gaze to where her eyes led, bringing them to His great hand, which were sharp after long years of swordsmanship training, and her soft, pale hand that contrasted each other but ironically looked good together.</p>
<p>Lacias called Lila’s name as he held up her hand and gently pressed his lips against her tightly woven lace gloves like a knight pledging allegiance to his master.</p>
<p>She found Lacias so cute that she couldn’t help but smile. Until just a while ago, Lacias was standing straight and being as masculine as possible, but now he was like a child longing for her affection.</p>
<p>“Did you know you’re really cute sometimes?” Lila asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Noting his lack of response, she held out her free hand and delicately brushed them against his cheek. Just like a chemical reaction, his face instantly changed to a shade of bright red as they were touched by her smooth skin. His boldness to kiss her on the hand was no longer there, and Lacias became as stiff as a stone. It was only his trembling eyes that told her he was still breathing.</p>
<p>Seeing how embarrassed he was, Lila caressed his cheek even more and couldn’t help but giggle at how deep his blush could become.</p>
<p><em>This is actually pretty fun!</em></p>
<p>With an innocent expression, he just stood there like a lost schoolboy. His face flinched at each touch with his confidence down the drain. Not wanting to show her mischievous side to the crowd, Lila quickly fixed her face.</p>
<p>“Lila… Can you stop….” He urged in a childish tone not fitting his form.</p>
<p>With his change in voice Lila held her hands away immediately. “Stop? You didn’t like it?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that I didn’t like it, ah….” Lacias thought of a way to avoid the question without hurting his wife-to-be. “I didn’t mean that I didn’t like it…”</p>
<p>“I know. I could tell by your face.”</p>
<p>“Ah….” Lacias blushed once again at her response. Although his face wasn’t that red, she could tell the difference from his usual color tone. <em>Is it because we’ve been together for a long time? It feels like I can read his thoughts.</em></p>
<p>“When this door opens, I can finally announce to the world that I am yours.” He finally said, regaining his confidence.</p>
<p>While speaking, Lacias looked straight at the front door without turning to her. His face looked tense, not because of the guests outside the door but because he and Lila would soon be an official couple.</p>
<p><em>Mine?</em></p>
<p>Lila smiled fondly because his thoughts were a little funny. Ask anyone sitting outside, and they would say Lila Marshmell was lucky to belong to Lacias Wipere because possession belongs to the one who holds power. However, Lacias is saying that he now belongs to her.</p>
