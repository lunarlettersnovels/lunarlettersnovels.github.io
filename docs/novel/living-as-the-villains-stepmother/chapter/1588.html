            <p><strong>Chapter 204</strong></p>
<p>Lila couldn’t hide her excitement at the thought of being able to see Hir’s ring in action. It was a rare opportunity to watch Hir’s skills while standing right next to him. From what she remembered from the original novel, Hir showed impressive skills. He later became even more powerful than his adoptive father, Lacias. However, that was a distant future. She didn’t expect Hir to already be skilled in controlling his ring when he had only figured out how to create it. She would be able to judge the accuracy in his moves, speed, and destructive power he had yet to develop.</p>
<p>Lila’s eyes met with Hizette, who had been watching her smile. Hizette quickly looked away as if he realized he had been watching Lila the whole time. Lila thought the reason why Hizette was looking at her was that he wanted to join the game.</p>
<p>“Hizette, do you want to join? Are you free right now?”</p>
<p>“I got a mountain of things I have to do, madam.” Hizette was trying to be polite.</p>
<p>“I thought you usually escort Hir around during this time.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. I will follow the young master throughout the game, to make sure that nothing happens to him.”</p>
<p>Lugar interrupted, signaling a large X with his arms. “That’s not fair. What if Hizette secretly gives instructions to our young master?”</p>
<p>“Why would I do that?” Hizette asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know? Anyway, that’s not going to happen. There’s no way I am going to lose, but even if I do lose, I won’t be able to stop thinking that you secretly helped the young master. That will ruin our young master’s first-ever ring match.” Lila could see that Lugar was trying to make Hizette join the game, but Hizette didn’t seem to realize that.</p>
<p>Hizette frowned. ”Do you really think I would do such a thing?”</p>
<p>Lila had a feeling that if she added a few words to what Lugar said, Hizette would definitely take part in the match. Lila didn’t want to miss out on a chance to add more fun to the game.</p>
<p>“I agree with Lugar. Who knows if Hizette would give a hint to Hir about where Lugar’s rings are?” As she intended, Hizette fell into their perfect trap. He agreed to join, making it a two versus one versus one game.</p>
<p>“By the way, what is the prize for the winner of this game?” Lugar was so competitive. He didn’t do anything unless there was a prize involved.</p>
<p>While Lila thought about it, Hir piped up with a clever answer. “Let’s grant the winner’s wish!”</p>
<p>“All right.” Lila nodded. “As long as they don’t ask for something unrealistic.”</p>
<p>Everyone agreed.</p>
<p>“The individual who finds the greatest number of Lugar’s rings wins. But if the three of us fail to find all of them, Lugar wins.” Lila announced</p>
<p>“Agreed.” The others accepted.</p>
<p>“I can already see a mischievous gleam in your eyes,” Lugar said to Hizette.</p>
<p>“You have to be evil to win a game,” Hizette snickered.</p>
<p>“That’s not what knights do.”</p>
<p>“Then tell me, oh wise one, what is it like to act like a knight?”</p>
<p>“It goes against our spirit…” The fight had begun even before they could start the game. Lila cut off their words to end the argument.</p>
<p>“Enough then, let’s start.”</p>
<p>“I’m so excited,” Hir announced.</p>
<p>Lugar decided to hide a total of five rings. The number of rings had to be odd so they could determine a winner. Slowly searching the surroundings, Hir walked with Lila. Lila wasn’t really interested in winning, she just wanted to make sure Hir enjoyed himself. Besides, she didn’t have anything to wish for, for herself. If she had been on a different team, she might have wished something for Hir. She would just leave it up to him if they won.</p>
<p>“Where do you think Lugar hid his rings?” Hir asked. “Do you think he hid them somewhere very difficult to find?”</p>
<p>“He said he would, but Lugar is someone who likes the game to be fair.”</p>
<p>“Let’s keep looking!” Hir seemed much more excited than Lila. Hir was busy searching for the rings with only his eyes. It seemed like he wasn’t sure how to use his rings yet. Lila decided to give him some advice.</p>
<p>“Hir, you have your ring and you can use it as your second eye to help you find Lugar’s rings.”</p>
<p>Hir’s eyes widened, as if he heard something he hadn’t even thought of. Lila could tell that what Hir worked on so far was how to create a ring, not how to handle it.</p>
<p>“My mother is a genius!” Hir shouted.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that I’m smart. I just know that’s how Lacias uses his rings.”</p>
<p>“He’s amazing! It’s something I wouldn’t have even thought of.” It was actually something all of the knights knew about, but she didn’t let Hir know that in case it discouraged him.</p>
<p><em>One day, he will learn all of the tactics</em>, Lila thought. <em>Once Hir starts taking the successive class, he will get to learn directly from Lacias. It’s sad I won’t get to see their rings filling the space together with beautiful colors.</em></p>
<p>“Once you learn, you will become even more amazing,” Lila told the boy.</p>
<p>“Do you really think so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I believe in you. What makes you special is inside of you. There’s nothing else you need.”</p>
<p>Hir’s face blushed and he smiled at her sweet words.</p>
<p>“Now, are you ready to find Lugar’s rings?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Hir cried.</p>
