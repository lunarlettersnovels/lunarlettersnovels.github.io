            <p><strong>Chapter 167</strong></p>
<p>“So who’s the knight who checked Madam Lila’s carriage? Are you sure he belongs to the Knights?” Worry was clear in the captain’s voice as Roxanne asked Lugar the specifics.</p>
<p>“Yes. He’s a new knight who came in when we did the recruitment recently. I can verify his identity.” Lugar tried to keep his tone as serious and as steady as possible.</p>
<p>“A new knight… I don’t know why but I have a bad feeling about this guy. Where is he now?”</p>
<p>“He’s on patrol outside the castle. He’s been positioned at the front entrance where the carriages come in.”</p>
<p>“Is Hizette with the young master today?” Asked Roxana.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>I should have sent Hizette since he’s trustworthy but…. </em>Roxana scanned the hall for her trusted knight and found some other knights hiding with Hizette sitting next to Hir in a tailcoat.</p>
<p>“I think we should send at least one of the knights to be prepared for any unforeseen situations.” Concluded Roxana after some thought. “And to be able to make a clear report to the master once the schedule is over.”</p>
<p>“Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>With Roxana’s permission, Lugar stepped into the shadow and disappeared into it.</p>
<p>After Lugar left his assigned position, Lacias flashed Roxana a glance from halfway across the hall. His slightly scrunched eyebrows seemed to be asking Roxana about what was going on. She shook her head and mouthed <em>‘Nothing’</em>.</p>
<p>Taking his knight’s word for it he turned his eyes back to his bride. Fortunately, it seemed like Lila didn’t notice anything yet.</p>
<p><em>It’s going to be okay. </em>Roxana tried reassuring herself but to no avail.</p>
<p><em>No … I shouldn’t be taking this lightly. There’s no way this happened by chance. I trained the Knights countless times to ensure a smooth wedding ceremony. I hope this is just a minor issue….</em></p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>Roxana clicked her tongue. She had a feeling it wouldn’t be minor.</p>
<h3><strong>*</strong></h3>
<p>As if by magic, the anxiety Lila had before entering the hall disappeared when the wedding started. <em>Is it because Lacias is holding my hand tightly?</em></p>
<p>When the cumbersome ceremony got closer to an end, Lila started to show signs of tiredness. It was only when the ceremony ended and the dinner party began that she could finally rest.</p>
<p>“You must be tired,” said Lacias, reading her mind as usual.</p>
<p>“Not at all. I’m okay.” She responded.</p>
<p>When Lacias suddenly came closer to her and whispered into her ear, Lila’s heart began to race.  “You look tired.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m really okay.”</p>
<p>“If you’re tired, there’s a place near here where you can rest.” He suggested reading through her lies like an open book.</p>
<p>“But I don’t need it because I’m not tired…?”</p>
<p>Lacias understood her position as the bride and let her have her way. “Okay … Tell me when you’re tired.”</p>
<p>“… Okay.”</p>
<p>Lacias began to mumble to himself about things she couldn’t understand.</p>
<p><em>Can it be that he’s the one that’s tired?</em></p>
<p>She wondered why someone with much better stamina than her was already exhausted.</p>
<p><em>But since this is a completely different event from his usual schedule, he may get tired quickly.</em></p>
<p>Lila held the thought and turned back to her groom. “If you’re tired, you can go there and take a rest. In the meantime, I’ll talk with the guests. Oh and I think I just saw Senior.”</p>
<p>“…It’s okay. I’m also not tired.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p><em>Then why does he keep asking whether I’m tired or not?</em> Lila tilted her head with a puzzled look, but she soon forgot about it when Senior strolled to her with a big smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Senior!”</p>
<p>“Lila!” Cheered Senior with the same energy. “You look very beautiful today! I know, you probably heard that countless times today but still!”</p>
<p>“But it feels different to hear that from you, Senior.”</p>
<p>“Haha, is that so?” She was still as easily flattered as ever.</p>
<p>Lila nodded her head. After having a short talk, Senior got to the point.</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting with Lady Nepeli. Things are going very smoothly.”</p>
<p>“It comes as no surprise. I believed that everything would turn out perfectly from the start.”</p>
<p>Back during the commotion at Senior’s local party. Lila secretly entrusted her and Edith to formulate a fake witness and use Edith’s network to shape public opinion. The fact that Lila heard of the news before it was reported to her means that the rumors were traveling fast.</p>
<p>“So you heard the news already?” queried Senior.</p>
<p>“Well, a little.”</p>
<p>Senior smiled slightly as if she understood what she meant. “But shouldn’t the bride be busy planning?”</p>
<p>“Lacias will be here,” she said casually, turning back to him. His face seemed annoyed as if he was dissatisfied by something. He seemed to want something from her.</p>
<p>“Oh, should I leave you guys for a moment?” Asked Senior reading between the lines.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I hope you understand.” Lacias complained a little, but he didn’t want to stop his bride from doing what she wanted on her wedding day. “I mean, I don’t have the right to stop my wife so you guys can go ahead.”</p>
<p>“…!” Lila widened her eyes like a rabbit as the reality of the ceremony hit her.</p>
<p><em>Wife…?</em></p>
<p>Lila felt a bit awkward to be called ‘wife’, but it wasn’t a lie that from now on, Lacias was officially her husband. However, her body instantly stiffened when she heard the name and it made her heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>“It’s something you’ll hear a lot from now on, so you have to get used to it. You can’t just blink like that whenever I call you.” As he smiled softly, Lacias touched Lila’s light blond hair causing the tips of her ears to turn slightly pink.</p>
<p>Senior coughed lightly to remind them of her presence. “Hm, hm. Please don’t forget about me. You two are not the only ones here.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes We should go now,” said Lila, bringing her mind back to the situation at hand. “Lady Edith must be waiting for us.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll be here greeting the guests.” Waved Lacias. “When you come back, let’s go see Hir.”</p>
<p>“Sure!”</p>
<p>Lila hurriedly took Senior’s arm and headed to the meeting place. Although Lila tried to act serious on the outside, she still appeared very cute to Lacias.</p>
