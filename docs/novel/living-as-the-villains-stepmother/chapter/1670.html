            <p><strong>Chapter 122 – Lost Puppy</strong></p>
<p>The first thing Lila noticed when she met Dawson Hiln was that he was nothing like Senior Hiln. She wondered how the two were siblings. Both had sharp features, but Dawson Hiln always had an unpleasant air about him, where Senior was always happy. His significantly constricted pupils naturally intimidated others. It was certainly true that you could tell a lot about a person by the impression they gave.</p>
<p>Dawson did not seem relaxed. He appeared more like a snake ready to strike. His anxiety was obvious. Even though he showed up late, he would have had a spy taking note of everything occurring at the party. Lila assumed that Dawson had received notice that Duke Wipere had arrived. Searching the floor, Dawson spotted Count Hiln and quickly made his way over to the man. Painting on a false smile, his eyes grew even colder.</p>
<p>“What are you staring at? How could you, when I’m standing right beside you?” Lacias waved his giant hand in front of Lila’s eyes to distract her from Dawson Hiln.</p>
<p><em>Now is the perfect time, </em>Lila thought. Dawson was mentally vulnerable. If she talked to him right now, she’d be able to control him without any difficulty. Breaking her thoughts, she returned focus to Lacias.</p>
<p>“Sorry. I’m a little preoccupied today.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?” Lacias asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to take back the diamond mines?”</p>
<p>Lacias didn’t react to her question. <em>Why is he being indifferent? Doesn’t he want to take back the mines? Isn’t that the reason he’s marrying me?</em> Lila was confused, frowning at the situation.</p>
<p>“That’s true, of course,” Lacias finally answered.</p>
<p>“Then just stay still. Shouldn’t I discuss it with the one who stole it?” Lila discreetly pointed to the direction Dawson was standing. “Dawson Hiln attended the party. I’m going to say hello to him for the first time.”</p>
<p>“We can go together.” Lacias insisted. Lila winced.</p>
<p>“Dawson Hiln won’t open up if we go together. Not even after he hurried to the party when he heard you were here.”</p>
<p>Roxanna, who had noticed Lila’s reaction to the arrival of Dawson and remained by their sides, nodded in accord. She quickly looked away when Lacias gave her a hostile glare.</p>
<p>“Still.” Lacias was incorrigible.</p>
<p>“What do you mean: still? I need to go before Dawson Hiln leaves the party hall. I’ll be back.”</p>
<p>Lacias flushed in frustration, but he shut his lips, having no further cause to argue. His blue eyes showed a combination of hurt and confusion.</p>
<p>“Please don’t glare or make yourself obvious.”</p>
<p>“These are my eyes; I can do with them what I want.” He acted so childishly when he was upset. Even Hir would not speak such immature nonsense.</p>
<p>“Everyone will notice. We are dealing with an important man, Dawson Hiln.” Lila reasoned out.</p>
<p>“If I can’t watch from a distance, then what the heck should I be doing?”</p>
<p>Lila froze in bewilderment. Lacias should know better. Did he not realize the embarrassment it would cause, staring after her pathetically? If he was going to act like a child, then she needed to treat him like one.</p>
<p>“If you continue like this, I’m going to take Dawson to a dark corner to speak with him alone. Imagine the scandal that would cause.” Dawson Hiln would never approve being alone with her, but the words were enough to trigger Lacias. He rubbed his ears and cringed in disbelief, looking like an upset kitten.</p>
<p>“I need to get going! I should have left sooner!” Roxanna, who had still been listening to their conversation, left in a hurry as her face turned pale.</p>
<p>“What in the world are you talking about?” Lacias couldn’t believe what he was hearing.</p>
<p>“You don’t think he was targeting you, when he took the diamond mines?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll watch discreetly. What if Dawson Hiln actually hits on you?”</p>
<p>“What? That’s nonsense. Why would he ever do such a thing?” Lila was shocked that Lacias was more concerned about her dignity than the diamond mines.</p>
<p>“Lacias, listen carefully. There is no way Dawson Hiln would even consider making an advance towards me. And, even if he did, do you think I would actually be flattered? Why don’t you trust me?”</p>
<p>“I do trust you. That’s not wha-what I meant.” Lila was bewildered at Lacias’ reaction. He even stuttered! Lacias continued trying to explain. “I just get upset at the thought that someone else might have affections for you.”</p>
<p>“With that logic, I shouldn’t even be able to leave the house.” To think that their marriage would be that constrictive. She was willing to enter into this union for Hir. She wanted him to live a peaceful life, but she couldn’t let her feelings for him cloud her judgement. The last thing she wanted to do was traumatize him in any way.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. This is all my fault. I won’t be obvious; I just want to gauge his reactions. That’s all.”</p>
<p><em>How can he not be obvious? He’s noticed everywhere he goes. </em>Already, there were guests glancing over at them. Lacias had a huge presence. It was impossible not to attract the attention of others. But there was no way he was going to be dissuaded.</p>
<p>Lila sighed, then nodded. “But, if you make it obvious, I’m going to glance over at you. If I look at you, that means you need to stop staring. Understand?”</p>
<p>“Perfectly.” Lacias reluctantly nodded. What other choice did he have? If he used his ring to conceal his presence, nobody would notice.</p>
<p>“Alright. Then I’ll be back.” Lila gave him a smile.</p>
<p>“Please be quick. It’s not good to leave me alone.”</p>
<p>“Why? Are you my lost puppy?”</p>
<p>“I’m willing to become one, as long as you don’t leave me alone.”</p>
<p>Lila could not help but smile. Lacias stepped to the side and allowed Lila to leave.</p>
<p>Dawson Hiln was still talking with Count Hiln. Count Hiln appeared nonchalant, but Dawson’s face darkened, as if they were discussing something serious. It was not until she came close that Dawson Hiln noticed her presence. His vigilant eyes focused on Lila.</p>
<p>Lila smiled and introduced herself, extending her hand for the proper greeting.</p>
<p>“Duchess Wipere! It disappointed me when I thought you had left already!” Count Hiln laughed at his attempts to be witty.</p>
<p>Duchess Wipere. The formal address set a sparkle to Dawson Hiln’s eyes.</p>
