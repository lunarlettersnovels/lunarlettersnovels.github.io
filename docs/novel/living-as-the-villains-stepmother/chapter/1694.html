            <p><strong>Chapter 98 – The Dispirited Knight (2)</strong></p>
<p>Lila knew Roxana would not have the two exchange places, unless he did something that caused him his temporary exclusion. Come to think of it, he did appear a little downcast. Lila reached out behind him and rubbed his shoulder in comfort. “Don’t worry too much. I know exactly how you feel.”</p>
<p>He immediately tensed at Lila’s touch, eyes fleeting nervously as he took a silent gulp. Lila noticed how he was still uncomfortable in her presence as if she was a stranger. This is the first time they had talked to each other at length. Not wanting to make him feel more uneasy, she pulled her hand away and he visibly loosened up. The silence stretched on, only disturbed by the sound of wheels rolling on the rough pavement.</p>
<p>They remained unspeaking for some time. Then Lila asked, “Have you heard from Lacias?”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“That after the marriage ceremony, you would teach my son how to use rings.”</p>
<p>Hizette did not answer, looking like it was the first time he heard of this. Lila understood the reason for his lack of response; he was simply covering for Lacias.</p>
<p>So Lacias did not tell him. <em>But why?</em> She found it strange that he would not let Hizette get close to her, and decided to ask him herself. “I know Lacias will say this soon, but I’ll go ahead and tell it to you myself. I want Hir to learn how to use rings because he seems to have the talent for it, and I know he could be of help to the Wiperes.”</p>
<p>Hizette nodded as if it was natural. “Yes. If you are finished speaking with the lord, I will do that.”</p>
<p>Lila responded with a grin and turned around to face the window. A while later the carriage shook and made a racket while passing a bumpy road. The silence was broken and Lila couldn’t help but feel a meticulous stare focused on her cheeks. She quickly turned and was relieved to know that it was just Hizette</p>
<p>Lila caught a flush of bright red on his face before he hid it by hastily looking down “Oh! sorry.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but chuckle to herself. <em>I don’t mind you gazing at me. </em>Lila soon lost interest and went back to looking out the window.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The surrounding sound was dismantled by a booming yet cheery voice.  “Lila!”</p>
<p>“Hi.” She said sheepishly, not nearly as enthusiastic as the other party.</p>
<p>“It has been so long. It’s so difficult to see you these days without my order … I understand that you are preoccupied, but this is still making me extremely disappointed.”</p>
<p>“I was about to visit you, but you were faster at inviting me.” Seeing Camerline was not a part of the plan, but Lila beamed as she spoke the lies. There was no good to get on Camerline’s nerves.</p>
<p>“I’ll be waiting at the door then.” Hizette cut in, trying to catch them at a suitable point</p>
<p>“Okay, got it,” Lila remarked, as he quickly nodded to Camerline and left the room.</p>
<p>Lila turned back to Camerline and instantly tried to find something to talk about. “The aura is so bright and cozy.”</p>
<p>“Yes, just the way I like it.”</p>
<p>“Suits you very well.” Lila tried to hide the irony in her voice.</p>
<p>The mansion dedicated solely to Camerline exuded a calm atmosphere contrary to what Lila expected. The colors of the furniture were very warm and welcoming, while Lila was expecting the latter of the two she was certainly not expecting the former. There may have been more to Lacias’s mother than meets the eye.</p>
<p>“The preparation for the wedding is coming to an end.”</p>
<p>“It’s ready so soon?”</p>
<p>Camerline couldn’t even hide her excitement anymore. “Of course! Now I think I only need to check the details. I have also decided on a date, does that work for you? I have to hand out the cards to the nobles so I had to decide quickly.”</p>
<p>Lila was astonished, not only were the preparations done but the cards were already made, the effort camerline was putting into her wedding was more than anyone had ever put into her entire previous life. Although Camerline was in charge of the wedding preparations Lila still felt that the date was too early, she felt a little overwhelmed. On the other hand, the earlier she held the wedding the better so it was for the best.</p>
<p>“Good, I approve.”</p>
<p>“Great. You’ll finally be a part of our family.”</p>
<p>After scrutinizing the cards made to invite the nobles, Camerline stood up and brought something to Lila. It was a hard jewelry box the size of a palm. Its design was fancy and elegant, clearly storing something very valuable.</p>
<p>The value of all the things she received from Camerline was already immeasurable. But then a present again? Lila felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“It’s a gift! From me of course.” Just as expected. Camerline beamed as if she was ecstatic to hand the present.</p>
<p>“Oh…-”</p>
<p>Lila looked down at the jewelry box with an ambivalent expression. She knew she had no other choice but to accept it.</p>
<p>“This is a congratulating gift for the two of you.”</p>
<p>“The two of us?” That was new, but Lila was glad that someone else was sharing it with her.</p>
<p>“Yes. You and my son are becoming husband and wife. This gift is a blessing for your eternity, so open it up.”</p>
<p>A blessing for eternity … Was it appropriate for her to open the gift? She felt a tinge of guilt. It was only going to be a 1-year contract marriage, she started feeling bad for Camerline since she treated her like a permanent daughter from when they first met.</p>
<p>She considered telling Camerline the truth as it would be heartbreaking if she were shocked when the contract ended and the two divorced. But she was quickly cut off before she had time to think about it.</p>
<p>“Come on, open it!”Camerline, unaware of Lila’s concern, started to rush her by waving her hands in the air.</p>
<p>Lila bit on her lips. She reluctantly placed her hand on the jewelry box, Its texture of the material proved that it was a high-quality product.</p>
<p><em>I should have Lacias hold onto it. </em>Of course, she never had the means to keep anything she received. However, this present had a different meaning.</p>
<p>Intending to immediately pass the box to Lacias to keep for her, she opened the jewelry box.</p>
<p>“What … is it?”</p>
<p>“See yourself.”</p>
