            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 18 – This Is Mine (1)</strong></p>
<p>Lila mumbled to herself quietly at the realization that she fell perfectly in her trap. “I guess … she didn’t know.”</p>
<p>She spoke lightly yet Fasha’s sharp ears caught every vibration of sound. Now that she had confirmed this she couldn’t let anything in anymore.</p>
<p>“How? … After all i’ve done, after accepting such a lowly born thing. You throw away everything I gave you like it was nothing?! My son hasn’t even been dead for so long and you’re already looking- no … <em>having</em> an affair with another man?!”</p>
<p>Lila had the most tranquil look on her face, it almost took the form of a smile. Some say that your enemy’s enemy was your ally, so in this case, Fasha’s hatred for the previous Mrs. Marshmell was mutual.</p>
<p>“You demon! I knew I shouldn’t have accepted you in the first place! You reeked of misfortune from the very beginning!”</p>
<p>Lila agreed with her even when she turned to swearing to Lila’s face. <em>Hir’s life was more difficult because you accepted Mrs Marshmell, or rather me. </em>Was the only thought that kept revolving around Lila’s head. However, a new thought had introduced itself when a word escaped Fasha’s lips. <em>Wait a minute, demon? How?</em></p>
<p>“What do you mean demon?” Asked Lila finally.</p>
<p>“Are you asking because you honestly don’t know? Not long after you entered the house, no, as soon as you entered, my son died!”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“You sucked out my son’s energy! You are the devil who ate my son!”</p>
<p>“Puhaha!” Lila couldn’t hold her laughter in any longer. “What is this nonsense?” She couldn’t help but feel like she was in the episode of one of those funny dramas she used to watch in her previous life.</p>
<p>“What is this now? … you’re adding an impolite attitude to your terrible hospitality?” Asking this, Fasha’s face was as stern as steel.</p>
<p>Lila was taken a little by surprise from the seriousness of her attitude. “Ah yes sorry. I suppose that is what happened.”</p>
<p>Fasha’s face had hardened beyond what Lila thought was possible, Lila’s attitude was proving to be unbearable for her.  With an expression that made her look like she had been in the desert for days Fasha thought more about the situation.</p>
<p>She knew that the Viscount died from an STD and as much as she hated her daughter-in-law, Fasha knew that Lila was not at fault for his death at all. It was well known knowledge in the family that Mrs. Marshmell avoided all bed temptations with the Viscount so it was not possible for the disease to come from her. <em>However, she would have only avoided the temptations due to her knowledge of his disease, so how did she know that my son had an STD?</em></p>
<p>Fasha considered the option of a background check on the Viscount but it seemed too far-fetched. No commoner in the general public had the finance to perform a decent background investigation. It seemed a little off to her on how Lila got this information. <em>Was there a mastermind behind all this? Hmm it’s also easy to get out of the grip of the lord.</em></p>
<p><em>Was there a mastermind behind all this? It was also easy to get out of the grip of the lord. </em>Fasha noticed that she had been thinking for too long so she directed her attention to Lila who seemed like she was about to give another response.</p>
<p>“He died while playing around with his lower body with another, but the logic of why I</p>
<p>became a demon was so funny that I laughed.”</p>
<p>“What! You better watch what you’re saying young woman!”</p>
<p>Lila let loose a quick chuckle. “Call me just one of the two, ‘low born’ or ‘young woman’. It gets confusing, but I appreciate the compliment.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me I did not compliment you.”</p>
<p>“Madam if that’s what you wanted you should have just asked, I heard rumors of a passerby who sells creams that hide wrinkles. If you were jealous of my young age you could have just said so.”</p>
<p>The words seemed to be a blind discomplement but Lila chose her words very carefully. She remembered from the original story that Fasha was extremely sensitive to her youth to the point of obsession. Seeing that Fasha’s face was as red as a rose in the summer she realised the book was spot on.</p>
<p>Fasha’s furious tone had clear insecurity behind it. “You’re try-trying to change the topic with bullshit.”</p>
<p>“Then, shall we go back to the original topic? About how your son died because he was playing around with other women, right?”</p>
