            <p><strong>Chapter 123 – Conflicting Hilns</strong></p>
<p>Lila found the opposing gaze strangely funny, his eyes gleaming like those of a hungry snake that found prey. He seemed to almost be drooling at his newfound food. However, what was oblivious to him was that this target was no food. Lila liked to think of herself as the eagle preying on the predator.</p>
<p>It was almost pathetic to watch Dawson Hiln constrict his pupils and glisten his eyes. Seeing that made Lila’s anxiousness fly out the window. <em>He really is blood-related to Senior.</em></p>
<p>Just like Senior, his emotions were open for all to read like a public newspaper. He was different from Senior, yet portrayed numerous similarities. That would mean Count Hiln is only capable of doing so much. Unlike his belief, Dawson was awkward in Lila’s perspective.</p>
<p>After reading the exact contents of his mind, Lila quickly thought of much easier ways to deal with him. <em>Haha, he’s nowhere near as challenging to read as Lacias or Edith. </em>Lila eased her heart and let her guard down for a moment but swiftly changed her mind to not let herself judge a book by its cover.</p>
<p>Lila put on a kind smile. Her inherently amiable-looking face helped her appear even less harmless. It seemed like Hiln fell for the trap. He already associated Lila with gullible prey Dawson, without knowing Lila’s intentions. let out his hand and offered a handshake.</p>
<p>“I am Dawson Hiln. You are stunningly beautiful just as I had heard. Not even the sun can be compared to you….”</p>
<p>She extended her hand in response and acted flattered by his comments. “Thank you, I am Lila.”</p>
<p>Lila shook his hand hurriedly, worried that Lacias might get upset over the physical contact, but he seemed to have completely understood Lila’s intention and did not seem disturbed in any way.</p>
<p><em>That’s good. If he did look upset, I was going to glare at him nastily.</em></p>
<p>She was expecting him to unprofessionally whine about it, but it was reassuring to see that he was not as immature as she thought. Strangely, Lila could not feel Lacias’ existence. <em>He must be concealing himself, he’s so skillful at magic.</em></p>
<p>“Haha! Dawson is the oldest son of our family. I heard you are great acquaintances with my daughter, but my son is the one whom I trust the most. It would be great for the two of you to share some words. Hahaha!” Count Hiln appeared extremely content. He tapped Dawson’s shoulder as a signal of some sort.</p>
<p>“This old man should go now. Enjoy your talk, madam.” Even though the wedding was not yet held, Lila was already identified as the wife of Wipere. It was understandable since nobody would expect the wedding to be canceled in any way.</p>
<p>The Count silently murmured a few lines into Dawson’s ears before leaving to greet the others.</p>
<p>The moment he left, Dawson looked more eager than ever. He barged closer to Lila but still kept a  safe distance grinning at her. He understood Lila’s smile as an approval to speak.</p>
<p>“I always dreamed of meeting you one day, but I never imagined meeting you on such an occasion. It’s an honor to run into you. What about you ma’am?.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, same here,” She answered roughly.</p>
<p><em>First of all, you didn’t ‘run into me, and did you really mean it when you said it’s an ‘honor?’</em></p>
<p>“I’m so happy to hear that….” Dawson’s thin lips elongated horizontally. He rolled his eyes sideways. This emphasized how especially small his pupils were. Lila stared at the snake-like eyes and raised an eyebrow, but she did so for only a second.</p>
<p>He enthusiastically looked right and left and said, “How about we go somewhere quiet to share a deeper and more intimate conversation?”</p>
<p>Dawson pointed in a direction with his eyes, which were leading to a private drawing-room near the party hall.</p>
<p><em>Is that a private room reserved for the Hilns?</em> Wondered Lila. <em>It was most likely made to allow secret affairs to be made during parties and events.</em></p>
<p>It was a perfect location. Free from people’s sight and free from noise. They had nothing to be bothered by. But Lila felt a bit suspicious. She vigilantly looked around just like Dawson did a moment ago. She assumed that if she and he entered the drawing-room, Lacias might pop out of nowhere.</p>
<p><em>That’s right. Now is not the time for that. It would be even better to make them feel more desperate.</em></p>
<p>Lila stopped looking around. The amethyst-like eyes captured Dawson. Her eyes folded angelically. “I don’t think our relationship is close enough yet. You’re going too far ahead,” she said.</p>
<p>“What?” Dawson was so confused. He suddenly couldn’t read her anymore.</p>
<p>“Did you not get that? You’re too far ahead.”</p>
<p>She was trying to predict what kind of dialogue would take place once they went into the drawing-room. Her most likely thought was for him to try and convince her to try and join him and betray Senior, and He would do so by seducing her with useless rewards. He had the cunning tongue of a snake, she almost expected it to stick out from time to time.</p>
<p>Dawson was shocked at Lila’s adamant reply. “What did you just say … ?”</p>
<p>“I think I repeated myself twice already. Are you ready to understand this time?”</p>
<p>“Ha … haha ….” Dawson rubbed his face with his hands and chuckled absurdly. “You don’t seem to be good at analyzing people, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Lila almost rolled her eyes at his statement. “Look who’s talking? Did you not approach me thinking I was an easy target to influence?”</p>
<p>She took his silence as a small victory and chuckled a little herself. “So, Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>After today’s conversation, she concluded that Senior was the right choice with Dawson being the wrong one. She couldn’t see herself working with Dawson, especially with those ugly eyes that resembled those of the Count. <em>The original story never revealed who becomes the head of the Hilns, but I think I can guess.</em></p>
<p>She could only see the Hiln family ending in disaster if Dawson was to be the head. It was only natural that Senior was to become the Head.</p>
<p>Dawson concealed his bewilderment with a sad attempt at a poker face by moistening his thin lips. “I see you’re trying to mess with my sister, but it won’t be easy.”</p>
