            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 47 – Sorry For Being Late (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Oh! What is all this?” The little boy was amazed at the cake in front of him.</p>
<p>“I made it.”</p>
<p>Hir’s eyes widened because it was a large chocolate cake with a sugar decoration of a boy riding a swing on the top. It would’ve taken a lot of effort.</p>
<p>“Is this- Is this me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I tried my best, but it’s not even similar, is it?” She said with a sad pout.</p>
<p>“No! It’s cute!” He quickly assured her, “I mean that I’m not c-cute…but this doll is!”</p>
<p>“This doll is you.”</p>
<p>“What I mean is that…” Hir’s cheeks turned pink in embarrassment, and Lila tapped the seat next to her with adoring eyes.</p>
<p>“Come here please.”</p>
<p>He sat next to her, where she had gestured. She had fed him well, and since the weight loss had come from short-term abuse, he had gained enough weight back to look well. His cheeks were round again, and he looked exceptionally adorable.</p>
<p>“I c-can I eat it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, as much as you want.”</p>
<p>Lila cut a slice of the chocolate cake and put it in front of Hir to eat comfortably. The boy raised his fork and took a big bite of the cake.</p>
<p>“It’s delicious!” Hir chewed the cake with wide round eyes. Lila looked on with a smile and handed a cup of warm milk.</p>
<p>“Eat slowly, it isn’t going anywhere.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you.”</p>
<p>“You got some on your cheek.”</p>
<p>Hir had gotten some chocolate cream on his cheek in his rush to eat the cake, and Lila stopped mid-air after trying to wipe it away. Lila remembered Hir flinched whenever she touched him.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I won’t touch you. You have some here. I’ll give you a handkerchief.”</p>
<p>Lila touched her own cheek to let Hir know and then gave Hir the handkerchief.</p>
<p>“Um…”</p>
<p>Hir looked at the cloth silently. There was a character on the top of the cloth embroidered in a corner, and he read the words under the character.</p>
<p>[Let Hir lead a happy life]</p>
<p>Hir knew that the crooked letters were definitely not done by a maid, it was his mother who was not talented in embroidery. He thought as he looked at his name on the handkerchief. He did not know why he felt such weight in his chest. Father had not been interested in him and had scolded him for being passive and stuttering in front of people due to his shyness. So, Hir had been happy when he met his new mother. She was beautiful as an angel and had a sweet personality. Hir had thought his stepmother had come from the heavens.</p>
<p>However, his mother had changed after his father’s death. Hir had thought every night for a month what he had done wrong. Was it because he stuttered? Was it because he was shy? Was it because he was passive?</p>
<p>There had to be a reason, something that he had done wrong. But his stepmother had changed again before he managed to find an answer, with love that exceeded anything he had seen before. Hir could see the love in her eyes clearly, even at his age. Then why had she acted like that all this time?</p>
<p>Hir’s eyes filled with tears and his nose grew red.</p>
<p>“Hir?” Lila instantly noticed the change in his mood.</p>
<p>“Why- can’t you…” Hir sobbed and spoke in a small voice, “do it for me…”</p>
<p>“Hir…”</p>
<p>Hir did not know why he felt like this, but Lila realized what was going on. Hir’s suppressed emotions had exploded at this moment. Lila raised the handkerchief to wipe Hir’s cheek, and while the chocolate cream had disappeared with Hir’s tears, Lila still caressed Hir’s cheeks like he was a precious treasure.</p>
<p>“Hir…my precious child.”</p>
<p>Lila carefully folded the handkerchief that had become wet with his tears and hugged Hir’s small body. Lila then said to him what he had wanted to hear from his parents for so long now.</p>
<p>“Lovely Hir, beautiful Hir, you are the most precious thing in this world. I’m sorry for everything…”</p>
<p><em>I am sorry for being late, and apologizing is the only thing I can do.</em> Lila pushed back those words as Hir buried his face in Lila’s shoulder and wept.</p>
