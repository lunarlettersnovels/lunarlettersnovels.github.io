            <p><strong>Chapter 163</strong></p>
<p>“Waaaah!” Hir screeched, jumping up and down in excitement. Dressed in a cute tuxedo set, Hir looked adorable as he fixed his wide-eyed gaze on Lila.</p>
<p>“Are you surprised?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes! Of course! I thought I was looking at an angel straight from the book I was reading!”</p>
<p>Hir couldn’t keep his excitement from seeing his mother that Hizette had no choice but to bring him to Lila’s waiting room. Hir peered through the small gap in the slightly opened door and whined, “Why can’t I go in? Why am I not allowed to see her?” His lips were formed into a pout. Hearing the disappointment in Hir’s voice, Hizette responded,</p>
<p>“Men aren’t allowed to see the bride before the wedding ceremony.”</p>
<p>Hir looked up at him, “Why?”</p>
<p>“That’s just how it is.” Hizette said with a shrug, hoping Hir would drop it altogether but it only made the boy even more curious.</p>
<p>“What do you mean that’s just how it is?”</p>
<p>Hizette stared back at him, “There’s no explanation for it. Like the color of the sky, it’s blue for no particular reason.”</p>
<p>But Hir remained adamant, however, “I can’t remember it clearly, but I read in my books that there’s an explanation as to why the sky is blue.”</p>
<p>For a brief second, Hizette was lost for words. He wondered when Hir became so smart that Hizette himself was caught off guard.</p>
<p>“…. It’s like a rule passed down for generations. And people follow it without question. For example, remember how we always clean the sword after training at the hall? It’s the same thing and you could think of it as a common rule that everyone was expected to follow. It’s as simple as that.”</p>
<p>“Then you should’ve told me that earlier! I wouldn’t have asked you to bring me here if that was the case.” Hir’s shoulders dropped.</p>
<p>“Well, I didn’t think I could talk you out of it since you seemed persistent.” Hizette said lightheartedly.</p>
<p>Hir didn’t say anything. Then after a short pause he muttered, “But… I’m still glad that I got to see her. Though she looks really busy.”</p>
<p>Lila had just finished her makeup but she was already skimming through papers laid on her lap. It didn’t matter she was in her wedding dress, she remained dedicated to her duties as ever.</p>
<p>“That’s Madam Lila for you.” Hizette remarked.</p>
<p>Hir nodded. The two of them watched the commotion in the room through the small opening, and some of the attendees inside occasionally cast curious glances towards them. Hizette felt uncomfortable being seen lingering outside the room, prompting him to straighten his back and touch Hir’s shoulder,</p>
<p>“I think we should head back now. Too many eyes are watching us.”</p>
<p>“But I know all of them!” Hir replied.</p>
<p>“Still, rumors might spread if people found out we’re peeking inside the madam’s waiting room.”</p>
<p>“I’m her son, though.”</p>
<p>Hizette shook his head, “But I’m not. I don’t want anybody to misinterpret.”</p>
<p>Not wanting to take his eyes off Lila, Hir fidgeted on his spot, ignoring Hizette completely. Hizette was about to tell the boy they should leave when Lila turned on her seat, her eyes growing wide.</p>
<p>“…. Hir?”</p>
<p>The eyes that had the same color as blooming purple hyacinths were staring back at them. Before she could say anything else, the maids scrambled towards the door with panicked expressions on their faces,</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness! Young master, you aren’t supposed to be here!” They seemed like they didn’t know what to do now that Hir had seen Lila in her dress. Lila calmly stood up from her seat and walked towards them, bent her knees as she crouched down in front of Hir. One of the maids gasped, saying that it will wrinkle her dress but Lila paid her no mind.</p>
<p>“How did you get here? You must be staying somewhere else.”</p>
<p>“H-hizette told me you’re here… I was told to stay in my room but I begged him to bring me here. I’m sorry.” Hir’s voice came out small.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to apologize. I missed you actually, so I’m really glad to see you right now.” Lila smiled at him.</p>
<p>Hir was reminded of his own words earlier when he said he wouldn’t have insisted on going here if he wasn’t supposed to, and he felt the need to change his words since he was worried that Hizette might be held responsible for his actions. It was clear that Hir exhibited the same thoughtfulness as Lila. Standing beside them, Hizette took a few steps back to give them privacy.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you tired? I’m sure you got up early to come all the way here.” Lila asked, concern lacing her voice.</p>
<p>Hir shook his head, “I’m not tired at all. I was feeling excited, actually. It feels like I’m on a picnic.”</p>
<p>“How about we go to a real picnic next time? How’s that sound?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>Hizette, who was quietly listening to their conversation, lifted his head suddenly. He felt something odd, like a random chill that went through him. He was pretty sensitive to his surroundings so he always sensed when people were approaching. But he wasn’t sure what he sensed this time. He subtly looked around to check if there’s anything amiss.</p>
<p>“Hir, I heard you’re going to give me a bouquet.”</p>
<p>“H-how did you know that?” Hir asked, his eyes growing wide.</p>
<p>“I saw it in the wedding sequence. Was it supposed to be a secret?” Lila tilted her head to look at him.</p>
<p>“No, I’m just surprised that you knew all about it already.”</p>
<p>“I remember it well, I mean, how could I not? It’s the part I’m looking forward to the most.” Lila flashed him a smile that spoke of kindness.</p>
<p>Hizette left while the two were in the middle of their conversation. He wanted to check the premises to see if there’s anything he should be concerned about especially when he had a nudge earlier. Hizette headed to the room hidden in the shadows at the far corner beside Lila’s room.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to round the corner, someone lurking in the darkness grabbed him and covered his mouth tightly.</p>
