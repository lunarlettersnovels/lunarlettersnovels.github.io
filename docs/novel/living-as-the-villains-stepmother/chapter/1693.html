            <p><strong>Chapter 99 – A Gift for Two</strong></p>
<p>Inside the box was a transparent rectangular dome. Inside it were models that resembled three people that she knew very well. Herself, Lacias, and Hir.  This took Lila back to a while ago when she made Hir a model of sugar, but that held no value compared to models made of precious gems. And inside the dome were vanilla-colored petals scattering.</p>
<p><em>Is this … a ring?</em></p>
<p>It resembled what was in the necklace she received as a gift from Lacias. It appeared as if she put rings inside to make it flutter like petals.</p>
<p><em>My face is on it. </em>Lila swept her fingers through the clear dome. She felt a little strange about it.</p>
<p>“So, do you like the wedding gift?”</p>
<p>Regardless of how she felt Lila couldn’t deny one fact. “It’s extremely gorgeous.”</p>
<p>“Place it at your bedside. It will guard you from danger. Not that I expect any danger to happen.” She said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Lila raised her eyebrows at Camerline’s response. <em>Guard me from danger? </em>Then it meant that the ring wandering around inside the dome belonged to … Camerline.</p>
<p><em>How could she have gotten so many rings? </em>She had so many rings inside it at once, the level of rings was almost on par with Lacias.</p>
<p>There was a limit to how many rings one could produce at once. For Lugar, the limit was three. For herself, it was one. Obtaining this many rings must have been strenuous and exhausting. Lila felt guilty with all her heart.</p>
<p><em>I should get rid of the model that resembles my face. Wouldn’t it help Camerline feel less betrayed?</em></p>
<p>“Thank you. I am so touched that I can’t find the best words to express my feeling.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to. It’s enough that you like the gift.” Camerline smiled so sweetly and Lila felt even more blameworthy. Thus she felt the need to express her gratitude as much as possible. Lila looked her in the eye and tried to return the same warm smile.</p>
<p>When the pair of amethyst eyes landed on Camerline with a smile, she couldn’t help but feel touched. Camerline quickly turned away trying to hide her embarrassment.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Did you enjoy the conversation?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so.” She answered half-heartedly while exiting the room with the jewelry box in her hands. Her mind was clearly elsewhere.</p>
<p>Hizette received the jewelry in the original workbox from her with a neat face.  “Ah, thank you.” She responded having almost forgotten about him.</p>
<p>“My pleasure. Let me escort you back home.”</p>
<p>Camerline wished to say goodbye, but Lila refused. Ultimately, Lila was the winner. The corridor of Camerline’s mansion was contrary to Marshmell and Weifel’s mansions.</p>
<p>Marshmell’s mansion looked luxurious while Weifel’s mansion appeared cold and stiff. Nevertheless, Camerline’s mansion resembled Camerline’s gorgeous but not extravagant warmth and softness.</p>
<p>Lila turned to the knight suddenly on their walk back to the carriage. “Hizette.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m listening.”</p>
<p>“Have you been to this mansion before?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have.” He replied blankly.</p>
<p>“Was the mansion always like this?”</p>
<p>“Pardon me. I did not understand your question.”</p>
<p>Lila breathed in for a second to try and rephrase her words. “I mean, was the mansion always this cozy and bright?”</p>
<p>“Yes. There is no big difference from when Duchess Camerline first bought the mansion.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Lila always believed that Furniture resembles a person’s personality. Knowing that the furniture was generally the same it implied that Camerline had the same personality from the beginning. That was proof that the original story did not go very deep into analyzing the characters.</p>
<p>In the original work, Camerline was also called the Duchess of Ice, but the Camerline she experienced was very far from such a title. Today she had confirmed that.</p>
<p>Hizette was puzzled about Lila’s question but did not ask back. He knew his boundaries as a knight well.</p>
<p>The two got out of the enormous mansion and when they reached the front of the carriage, Hizette noticed a presence.</p>
<p>“There’s an intruder in the carriage.” Hizette’s words were cut off. He widened his eyes and tilted his head. Then he opened his mouth again.</p>
<p>“The lord is in the carriage.”</p>
<p>“Lacias?”</p>
<p>Hizette looked around. In the distance, Lugar and Roxana were waving their hands. Understanding the situation, Hizette calmed down and bowed to Lila.</p>
<p>“The lord seems to have come to pick you up. I will follow you in a different way.”</p>
<p>Lila breathed out a sigh of relief. “Alright.” She also noticed Roxana and Lugar. casually,  she waved her hand back at them and went inside the carriage.</p>
<p>“What brings you here?” Lila asked without greeting him.</p>
<p>Lacias smiled brightly. “I don’t need a reason to pick you up.”</p>
<p>“Sure, but I thought you were busy.”</p>
<p>“I finished my work early to see you.” Inside the carriage lay Lacias comfortably as if he was on a sofa. But his attention was elsewhere. “Ah. You put your hair up today.” He continued.</p>
<p>“Yes, I did.” She sounded almost satisfied that he noticed.</p>
<p>She had her hair up neatly since she didn’t know what kind of a person she was going to meet today. She stroked her hair, pleased at the effort she put into it.</p>
<p>“Absolutely beautiful.” Lacias’ slightly messy hair created a laid-back aura. Lila felt her cheeks getting hot and turned her gaze somewhere else.</p>
<p>“I ran to you as soon as I was done with work.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” She couldn’t find much else to say.</p>
<p>“Yes. Did I do well? Please compliment me.” Lacias smirked and bowed down towards Lila.</p>
<p>“Would you like me to stroke your hair?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please. You promised to compliment me.” Obviously, Lacias was here because he missed Lila and she was very much aware of it.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing to compliment, also it seems like an act of self-satisfaction.”</p>
<p>“Darn it. Busted.” Lacias drooped his lips and frowned. It would typically be a pretty heinous expression, but it appeared to be cute when he did it. Lila only blamed herself for falling for him too hard.</p>
<p>Lacias lifted his head back up and placed his body closer to Lila’s. “So, what did you talk about with my mother?”</p>
<p>“About the wedding … oh, and we received a gift from her by the way-” Lila then remembered that she left it with Hizette and did not have it with her. She shook her head in shame.</p>
<p><em>Regardless, Hizette might hand it to Lacias later. It’s not a big deal.</em></p>
<p>She then briefly explained to him that the gift was not with her and asked him to take care of it. However, just at that moment, somebody sluggishly tapped on the carriage door.</p>
