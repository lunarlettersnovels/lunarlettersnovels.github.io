            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 44 – The Future Duchess (1)</strong></p>
<p>Lila was a little surprised at the different looks that Hizette had. Unlike the others, he had bright silvery hair which accentuated the paleness of his skin. She could see from his features that he was younger than the entry age for most knights and she remembered that fact is stated in the original story, she also remembered that he used to be a commoner whose prowess was recognized by the Wipere family. It was said that his ring was only a little weaker than Lacias’s.</p>
<p>Hizette was the one who ended up teaching Hir how to wield his ring. He raised him like an older brother and despite his sharp personality towards adults, Lila knew he was a lovable character.</p>
<p>He shot a glance at Lugar with his ring ready. “I asked you a question, Lugar.” The tone was normal but with an abnormal amount of coldness behind it.</p>
<p>Lugar took a step forward in front of Lila. “Hizette, trust me, you’re gonna want to treat her nicely. Or else you’ll face some … unfortunate situations from the duke … Like me just a few hours ago.”</p>
<p>He shivered to himself, remembering the torture that he went through from Lacias, to the point where Lila had to step in and stop it.</p>
<p>Lila came ahead from behind Lugar and waved innocently at the young man who was now sitting up-right. “Hello, Hizette. Do you know me?” He was most certainly more handsome than the novel descriptions, especially with his alluring red eyes. However, she didn’t let that intimidate her.</p>
<p>Hizette sighed deeply and relaxed his shoulders. “I know you better than you think.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know you.”</p>
<p>“Of course, you don’t. Do we really need to both know each other?” He answered sharply.</p>
<p>Lila knew that Hizette got the wrong idea from the situation before him. She turned her head and awkwardly put out her hand before stating the truth.</p>
<p>“Hizette of the Wipere Knights, I’m Lila, who will marry your master soon.”</p>
<p>She saw the look of surprise cover her face for just a moment and that moment was enough for her to know she had won. She tried to cover her victorious smile with a gesture but it failed.</p>
<p>Hizette on the other hand now knew the reason why he was called back from his mission earlier than usual. “You-”</p>
<p>Lugar intervened quickly before any more mistakes were made. “Hizette! That’s not how we should address the mistress of the Wiperes! Your head will be off with the duke’s next order!”</p>
<p>Hizette for once in his life, considered what Lugar had said and acknowledged that he had a good point with a simple nod.</p>
<p>“What should I call her then?”</p>
<p>Lugar scratched his head for a moment. “Umm, Mistress?” He suggested, as if he hadn’t just said it a few moments ago.</p>
<p>Hizette’s eyes grew cold, he couldn’t get himself to do it. “You call her that.”</p>
<p>“Then how about master?”</p>
<p>He covered his face with his palm regretting ever listening to what Lugar had to say. “I think you should just shut up.” He turned towards the woman who was laughing silently at their pointless banter.</p>
<p>Lila noticed the seriousness in his eyes and she quickly stopped and cleared her throat. “You can call me whatever you want, especially since I’m not married yet.”</p>
<p>“Then I will call you Madame.”</p>
<p>Hizette bent his head in a greeting but immediately turned his head to ask Lugar a question.</p>
<p>“Has the Master returned?”</p>
<p>“No, he’s gone out to search for a contaminated ring that he found out about during the party.”</p>
<p>“Did he go by himself?”</p>
<p>“Roxana is with him.”</p>
<p>“Hm I see.” He felt more comfortable with their leader accompanying him. However, he couldn’t shake off the feeling of running out at that very moment and joining them.</p>
<p>Lacias had an eye for suitable knights. All his ring knights were prepared to die for him at any moment. He chose his companions very carefully.</p>
<p>After a short period of silence Hizette spoke what was on his mind. “Is there enough manpower?”</p>
<p>“Are you underestimating Roxana? If she heard that, your bones would have been crushed that very instant.”</p>
<p>Hizette lowered his head with clenched teeth. “I did not mean that.” He felt useless sitting on his bed with no task at hand. Suddenly Lugar came with a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>“You have another mission assigned to you, Hizette.”</p>
<p>“For me?” Hizette’s rigid face turned to a bright expression.</p>
<p>“Yes, your mission is–” Lugar smiled brightly at seeing that he caught Hizette’s full attention. “To take a walk with Madame Lila!”</p>
<p>Lugar noticed the hatred at the eyes looking directly at him and quickly tried to save himself by talking more. “Thank you for your help.”</p>
<p>“Who gave this order?”</p>
<p>“Me, the sub-leader of the Wipere Knights!”</p>
<p>“Damn, I should have chased you out earlier.” Despite hating Lugar with all his guts at that moment, he knew that he couldn’t defy him.</p>
<p>Hizette got up and rumpled his hair while making sure that the laughing Lugar got the extent of his hatred.</p>
<p>“Madame, please wait for a moment while I dress.”</p>
<p>“Yes, take your time.”</p>
