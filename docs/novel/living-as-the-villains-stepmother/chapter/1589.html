            <p><strong>Chapter 203</strong></p>
<p>Lila shook her head as a sign telling him to say no more. Lila knew that Lacias wanted to share a bedroom with her before their wedding. But by chance, Lila had found out about an old tradition that Lacias did his best to hide. The old tradition stated that a couple could only share a bedroom after marriage. When Lila had pointed this out, there had been a lot of complaints from Lacias about how outdated the tradition was. Lila insisted on following it and Lacias would never go against her will.</p>
<p>“How did the construction already get completed? It’s only been a few days since the wedding. Actually, I guess it’s not that surprising.” It was obvious that Lacias had put pressure on the workers to have the construction completed in the shortest time possible.</p>
<p>“Still, there is a bit of time left before the completion. I’m very excited about it,” Lacias said. “I hope you are too?”</p>
<p>“I am, of course.” She wanted to express her true feelings but had to hold back her words. She felt like getting any closer to him would only make it difficult for her to leave his side in the future.</p>
<p>“It’s late. Why don’t you try to go back to sleep?” Lacias laid a hand on her head and stroked her hair. Every touch was full of affection.</p>
<p>As she closed her eyes, she heard a soft moan from behind her. Hir had rolled over and partially awoken from the sound of their conversation.</p>
<p>“Mommy?” Lila’s eyes widened. Hir had just called her ‘Mommy’! Her heart swelled as the boy drifted back into slumber. Feeling the warmth of Hir’s body snuggling into her and Lacias’ hand caressing her hair, she drifted off into the void herself.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“It’s been a while. I won’t let you win this time!” Lugar smiled. Lila had come to the training hall and had challenged him to a ring match.</p>
<p>“Lugar, you lost fair and square,” Lila laughed.</p>
<p>“Madam. At that time, I…”</p>
<p>“Yes, I remember you saying that you had been fighting with all your might. It was amazing.”</p>
<p>As they faced off, Hizette entered wearing a training uniform.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” he asked. “Good day, Madam Lila.”</p>
<p>“Mother!” Hir came running in after his teacher</p>
<p>“Hir! How did the training go?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>“Good! Are you here to see me train?” Hir was beaming with joy.</p>
<p>“Of course, I came to see you. You look amazing in your training uniform, Hir.”</p>
<p>Hir blushed and scratched his head. He had on a miniature version of the training uniform of the Knights of Wipere. It looked good on him, especially since he had grown so much. The training had begun earlier than expected, because his ring had manifested at a young age.</p>
<p>“Madam, I have an idea,” Lugar spoke up. “Since our young master can now handle his ring, why not let him join us in the match!?”</p>
<p>“What?” Lila almost burst out laughing. Hir may have manifested his ring, but he still had a lot of training to complete before he could control its power.</p>
<p>Hir, however, seemed interested in what Lugar said. “How do you do that?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Do you want to try, Hir?” Lila asked with a smile. She thought Lugar’s idea was absurd, but only until she saw the twinkle in Hir’s eyes. “If you want to do it, you certainly can try.”</p>
<p>“But madam, that’s not what you just said to me,” Lugar protested. “Why did you change your mind so quickly?” Lila completely ignored Lugar and continued speaking to her son.</p>
<p>“Hir, would you like me to explain the rules?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Hir said, very excited.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t interfere in the family business,” Hizette said to Lugar, who looked upset that no one was listening to him.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that has anything to do with the situation right now, Hizette. Does it?”</p>
<p>“Regardless.” Lugar burst out laughing at the absurdity of Hizette’s answer. “The General would have said the same thing.”</p>
<p>“I know, you bastard.”</p>
<p>“Do you understand the rules now?” Lila had just finished explaining how duels work to Hir, but he still looked confused. “Even if you don’t, no worries. I will help you throughout the game.”</p>
<p>“It sounds fun!” Hir’s eyes were glowing with excitement.</p>
<p>The rules were simple. It was just like hide-and-seek, which Hir knew well. Except the hider, in this case Lugar, would continue to move and change hiding positions. They needed to locate Lugar’s ring and blow it up.</p>
<p>“Shoot and kill Lugar!” Hir shouted.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>Lugar, who had been quietly listening to Lila explain the rules of the game, widened his eyes. “Wait, what did you say? Shoot and kill?” But once again, Lila and Hir were laughing so hard, they didn’t hear his nervousness.</p>
<p>“Since Hir is playing this game for the first time, can I be on the same team as him?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>“Not a bad idea,” Lugar agreed.</p>
<p>“Then it will be a two versus one game where Hir and I have to defeat Lugar,” Lila announced</p>
<p>“Why do you keep talking as if I’m a villain?” Lugar asked.</p>
