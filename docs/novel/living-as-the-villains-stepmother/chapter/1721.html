            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 71 – Too Strange</strong></p>
<p>Lila came back to the Marshmell manor after her meeting with Senior. She planned to spend the day organizing her plans after their discussion about who Doug Blake was. It was just unfortunate that Senior found him unfamiliar and Lila hoped that she would figure this all out soon.</p>
<p>Her contract with Lacias would only last a year, but she wanted everything to end as soon as possible so Hir would be under Lacias’ care. Deep in her thoughts, she did not notice Jane approaching her until her footsteps were close enough. “Lady, you came.”</p>
<p>Lila looked up. “Jane.” She was a bit surprised at the latter’s presence. “Is Hir all right?”</p>
<p>“He’s in his room.” Jane responded flatly, and she was slightly fidgeting at Lila’s question.</p>
<p>Lila did not fail to notice how troubled Jane looked. “Did something happen?”</p>
<p>Jane didn’t answer her at first. The hesitation didn’t go amiss with Lila as she wondered if something had happened to Hir.</p>
<p>Lila was still looking at Jane and the intensity of her stare prompted her to voice her concerns. “It’s not a big deal, but the young master is in his room and he doesn’t want to eat.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“He’s not answering the door.”</p>
<p>Even though Hir had gotten his memories back, the first few days were still a blank to him and he had been really curious about the lost memories.</p>
<p>“Did you offer to give him dessert?” Lila asked.</p>
<p>Jane shook her head no.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll go bring him one.” Lila bunched her sleeves up and thought of a dessert that Hir would like. Something sweet that melts on the tongue may help him with his bad mood. Lila had to make a dessert that was easy to put together, one that wouldn’t require so much time since she wanted to see Hir as soon as possible.</p>
<p>She was thinking of bringing him a bowl of marshmallows with a chocolate dipping on the side before asking him what’s wrong.</p>
<p>Lila turned the burner on and waited for the water to boil. She broke a chocolate bar to pieces and placed them in a bowl before hovering it above the steam. She ripped open a bag of marshmallows and started to place them delicately on nice-looking dishes when she stopped moving altogether. She looked at what she prepared for him, pondering if she was going overboard with all these preparations.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, the image of Hir being scared when he lost his memories come flashing back, coming as a reminder that she was not going to stay with him forever.</p>
<p>She feared that she might have been delving in too much, causing her hand to shake nervously. It was unfair that Madame Marshmell’s infamous past of neglecting Hir forced her to move so far away.</p>
<p>Even with how desperate Lila was, she was not going to tell Hir that she was a different person, since doing so might make him see her as a liar, one who was trying to avoid the blame, and no one would believe her anyway.</p>
<p>Nothing will change, this was all she could do at this point and she felt like she’s been backed into a wall. She sighed and decided to brush the dejected thoughts away. Her eyes panned to the colorful marshmallows and melted milk chocolate, and placed them on a tray. She also grabbed a glass of warm honey milk and hoped this would suffice. She lifted the tray up when Jane offered to carry it for her.</p>
<p>“Let me take it, Lady.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. I can manage.” Lila beamed her a small smile.</p>
<p>Jane shook her head. “You’re pale as a ghost and I’m worried that you might faint. What if you drop these?”</p>
<p>“I am?” Lila lightly patted her cheeks in the hopes of regaining some color back to her face.</p>
<p>Jane took the tray off her hands and went out of the kitchen. Lila guessed that the thoughts of leaving Hir might have taken a toll on her. She realized that she really loves him, since he lived for him every single day ever since she woke up in Madame Marshmell’s body, and she would still continue doing so in the future.</p>
<p>Lila trailed right after Jane.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Hir, are you there?” Lila softly knocked on Hir’s door and a small voice immediately answered her.</p>
<p>“I am..” She could barely make out the words, Hir sounded sad and gloomy just like what Jane said. Lila gathered her thoughts for a few seconds before addressing him once again.</p>
<p>“May I go in? I brought you some marshmallows, would you like to share them together?”</p>
<p>No answer came from the opposite side of the door. Lila didn’t know what to do since this was the first time something like this happened.</p>
<p>What was it that’s bothering him? It was so unlike Hir to not open the door, especially when she brought desserts for him. He usually accepts it with a smile plastered on his face regardless of his mood. Lila softly asked him again.</p>
<p>“Hir, do you want some?”</p>
<p>“Um..” Lila heard the hesitation in Hir’s voice. Maybe the boy wanted to be left alone for the time being and as much as Lila wanted to know what happened, she’s still going to respect his privacy. Lila sighed and faced Jane.</p>
<p>“We should go back.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but..!” Jane’s eyes drifted to the spread Lila prepared for Hir. “You worked so hard on these. It would be a shame if it goes to waste.”</p>
<p>“It could still be eaten later.” Lila responded.</p>
<p>“But the chocolate would harden, and the milk will grow cold—“</p>
<p>“I don’t want to bother Hir when he clearly wants to be alone. It’s all right..” Lila’s words stopped when she heard the sound of the door creaking open. She turned her head and saw Hir peeking between the gap, looking at the dessert tray Jane was holding onto.</p>
<p>He must’ve heard them talking and how could he not? They were talking right outside his door.</p>
<p>“Hir, I’m sorry. Do come out when you feel like it, okay? You should go rest.” Lila said.</p>
<p>“No..” He opened the door further and took the tray from Jane. “Come in.”</p>
<p>Lila was surprised. “Don’t you want to be left alone?”</p>
<p>“I changed my mind. I want to eat these with you.” Hir said.</p>
