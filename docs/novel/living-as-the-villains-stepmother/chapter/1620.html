            <p><strong>Chapter 172 – Taking a Break</strong></p>
<p>“But I always thought of us as a family,” said Lila, knowing what he said was true.</p>
<p>“Yes, but it might have been different for Hir. I’m also glad that a person you love has become part of my family.”</p>
<p>For Lila, his words were sweeter than chocolate cookies topped with marshmallows. They were sweet enough to make her heart pound fast. “Thank you for saying that… And thank you for accepting my absurd contract.”</p>
<p>“Let’s not use the word ‘contract’ anymore because we really are a married couple now.”</p>
<p>“…Okay.” Lila was aware of her feelings towards him, and she also knew it wasn’t a light crush. She already lost her whole heart to Lacias, but she would eventually have to leave his side because the body she came into was to lead a life of expiation.</p>
<p>She hesitated a little before answering, but Lacias didn’t seem to notice. He must have thought that she was so touched by his words that she went speechless for a moment.</p>
<p><em><strong>Knock. Knock.</strong></em></p>
<p>The moment the knock sounded, the arm that was warped around her waist slid away. Lila coughed in embarrassment for feeling disappointed when he took his hand off her.</p>
<p>“Looks like someone’s at the door.” She finally said.</p>
<p>“It’s Roxana.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>Lacias immediately noticed who was knocking on the door just by the sound of knocking and footsteps. But he only glanced at the door with an apathetic look on his face.</p>
<p>“Master!” Knocking on the door again, Roxana expressed how urgent the matter was. Even Lila could see how urgent the situation was at the sound of her strong, impatient knock. Still, Lacias remained calm.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you answering her?” asked Lila, listening to Roxana’s desperate voice. “I think she’s going to run out of breath soon.”</p>
<p>She felt sorry for Roxana while Lacias, who was the cause of this situation, didn’t seem to mind at all.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious that she’s trying to take away my precious time. Why would I respond?”</p>
<p><em>I mean, that’s not wrong, but- </em>Lila was almost persuaded by his calm voice, but she quickly shook her head.</p>
<p>“How could you act so carefree when you don’t even know what’s going on? Come on, open the door.” She pressed.</p>
<p>“If it was really an urgent matter, she would have already kicked down the door.”</p>
<p>“It’s probably not <em>that</em> urgent, but I’m sure it’s dire enough for your attention.” Lila, who passed the carefree Lacias, opened the lounge door, and in front of her stood the commander with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>“…Roxana?”</p>
<p>“Ah, Madam Lil-, wait no! I should call you the Duchess from now on!” She was a little startled by her voice but for some reason her eyes were still closed.</p>
<p>“I think it would be better for you to just call me Madame Lila as you used to.”</p>
<p>“Right, Madam Lila!”</p>
<p>“But… Why are you standing there with your eyes closed?” She had her eyes closed so tight as if she was trying not to look ahead.</p>
<p>“…Can I open my eyes now?”</p>
<p>“I mean, it’s really up to you.” Offered Lila with a puzzled look on her face.</p>
<p>Hearing that, Roxana opened her eyes very slowly and took in the expression of the confused duchess standing before her. “Whew.”</p>
<p>“Why were your eyes closed?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s because….” Roxana answered hesitantly, with her face quickly turning red.</p>
<p>“….I didn’t hear any response from both of you, so I was afraid I might see something I shouldn’t see….”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Lila’s face also began to redden. “What, what are you talking about!”</p>
<p>“Well… you two are newlyweds from today, so….”</p>
<p>“Roxana, stop!” Thinking that Lacias was standing behind her and listening to their conversation, she couldn’t hide her embarrassment. Lila covered her blushing face with her hair, turned around, sprinting back to the sofa.</p>
<p>Lacias smiled while watching Lila, who was flustered enough to become a chicken. Then he turned to Roxana and asked. “So, what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I need to report something to you.”</p>
<p>“Is it urgent?” He asked, turning back to his embarrassed wife.</p>
<p>“In my opinion, I think you should listen to it now.”</p>
<p>“How long do you think it will take?”</p>
<p>“It will be over in about twenty minutes,” said Roxana, hoping he was willing to listen to her.</p>
<p>“Ha….” Her hopes seemed quite bleak at this point.</p>
<p><em>That’s a bit long. </em>He thought.</p>
<p>Lacias frowned hard with a cold face. He no longer had to hide his face since Lila was behind him. Facing her master, Roxana couldn’t help but lower her head.</p>
<p><em>If Roxana had to call me out, it must be an important report.</em></p>
<p>Lacias was unhappy that his time with Lila had been interrupted, but he had no choice. It wasn’t something he could take his anger out on Roxana.</p>
<p>Lacias changed his face again. This time, it was one that evoked sympathy. “Lila, I think I’ll need to leave for a little.”</p>
<p>“Okay. See you later.” But his cool wife didn’t really seem to mind. As if she didn’t care whether he was leaving or not, she was busy putting chocolate cookies on her plate.</p>
<p>“Please wait. I’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>“Okay. In the meantime, I’ll eat these cookies.” She said casually.</p>
<p>Lacias left with Roxana, but Lila wasn’t bothered because she knew that he was a man of his word and he would indeed be back soon. She thought to herself that by the time she was finished eating the chocolate cookies, Lacias would be back.</p>
<p>While she was enjoying her cookies on a comfy chair, she heard a knock outside the lounge door.</p>
<p><em>How come he’s back so quick. I mean, no one can stop Lacias. Did he even listen to the report carefully?</em></p>
<p>Lila opened the door with a bright smile on her face. But it was immediately replaced with shock.</p>
<p>“Lila.” said the smirking blond man.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>It was the emperor who was standing at the door.</p>
