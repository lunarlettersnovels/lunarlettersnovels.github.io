            <p><strong>Chapter 107 – The Serpent’s Nest (1)</strong></p>
<p>“By the way, isn’t it strange?” Senior got on the carriage and asked with her eyes widened. “Will the Nepelis truly want me to become the head of the Hiln family? I believe not. The Nepelis have been acquainted with Dawson for quite a long time.”</p>
<p>Lila sat back while looking at Senior with a surprised expression. “Really? Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Well … Yes, A while back, Nepeli used to privately visit our mansion all the time, although not so much these days.” Now that they would be acquaintances, Senior started imagining a plethora of horrid situations in her head. “So why is Nepeli’s daughter willing to sign a contract that supports me?”</p>
<p>Lila rubbed her chin passively. <em>This situation could get tricky.</em></p>
<p>To get the facts straight, Edith only asked Lila if she ‘made a deal with Hiln Senior,’ but nothing about trying to make Senior the head of the Hilns.</p>
<p><em>What if Edith is unaware. What if the person the Nepelis are supporting as the head is not the person I’m supporting? What would happen to the contract? What if she ends up leaking the information that I’m trying to make Senior the head of the Hilns without gaining anything in return? Also, that would imply that the Wiperes are on Senior’s side, which would immediately alarm Dawon Hiln.</em></p>
<p>The possibilities were endless. even Lila’s mind was brimming with situations beyond her control, to the point where her migraine intensified. She should have figured out about the Nepelis being acquainted with Dawson sooner. It all could end up being a mess now. Getting updated sooner than everyone else was what Lila always prioritized, but there was a limit to her ability.</p>
<p><em>Should we have asked for Lacias’ help? </em>If so, she would have been able to think specifically about other countermeasures. She wanted to solve everything by herself, but she began to doubt herself.</p>
<p>Edith was already waiting for her, and she and Senior were already in the carriage on the way to the Nepelis. There was not enough time.</p>
<p><em>I should try to figure out what’s on Edith’s mind.</em></p>
<p>She was not willing to trust that Edith was helping her out of kindness, it was certainly too good to be true, she definitely had other plans on her mind. Every person had their greed, and hers was just being hidden. It was nonsense that Edith never expected anything back when she sent out the gifts and letters. Even if her intentions were pure, she wouldn’t be so kind as to turn her back on her own family.</p>
<p>After nodding her head to the conclusion Lila turned back to her current partner. “Hey Senior.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Keep your vigilance today okay?” She turned back with confusion visible all over her face, but Lila continued before she opened her mouth. “We seem to be entering the snake’s lair.”</p>
<p>“Snake … ?” Senior was completely taken aback at Lila’s words, but Lila refused to repeat herself. Because the carriage had already arrived at the front gates of the Nepeli Mansion.</p>
<p>She casually hopped out as if she didn’t just label their host as a vicious snake. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The Nepeli Mansion hallway seemed drawn-out and dramatic, with sculpted ornaments lined up on each side of the corridor; they looked luxurious, especially from an outsider’s perspective.</p>
<p><em>No wonder she gifted Mrs. Marshmell so often.</em></p>
<p>The earring dangling from Lila’s ear was expensive enough to buy an entire house. The fact that Edith sent such pricey jewelry as a gift easily proved her wealth.</p>
<p>Lila glanced at the anxious Senior next to her.</p>
<p><em>So different from the Hilns. Same class, but different level.</em></p>
<p>The same went for Wipere. Everyone seemed to respect Wipere more even though they were all upper class. If the Nepelis favored Senior, Senior’s position among the Hilns would dramatically become special and renowned.</p>
<p>“This way.” A butler seemingly appeared out of thin air leading them onwards further down the hall. His gray mustache twitched as he grinned further along the path. “She is already waiting.”</p>
<p>A pinkish-colored door was apparent towards the end of the hall, silently signifying that the room belonged to someone positive without making it too obvious. When the butler opened the door, the duo finally understood that the room had a cherry blossom theme, with colors similar to the door painted all over the room. In front of a long rectangular desk sat Edith, cross-legged with a joyful grin.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re here!” She raised her hands towards them like she was embracing them from afar.</p>
<p><em>Such a welcoming attitude, as if she had been waiting for our arrival. </em>Lila resisted the urge to roll her eyes and brightened her stiffened face.</p>
<p>She wondered how long Edith would keep up the ‘fan of Lila’ act before showing her true colors.</p>
<p>The butler gestured to them onwards without going himself. “Please do go on ahead”</p>
<p>“Okay….” Squeaked Senior, not noticing her weak voice.</p>
<p>The small voice made Lila pay attention to her. She may have been overwhelmed with the ‘Snake’s Lair’ phrasing, as she looked extremely nervous.</p>
<p>Lila tilted her head towards Senior and warned quietly. “Why the long face? It’s not going to help us in this situation.”</p>
<p>“I know but … I can’t help it.” Senior tried to relax, but there was no change to her expression.</p>
<p>Lila tried to come up with a new way to calm her down. “This is nothing. We have way more arduous fights ahead of us. You can’t be nervous over something like this? Luckily Edith seems to be on our side.”</p>
<p>“You said it might be a snake’s lair … How can I not be anxious after hearing that?”</p>
<p>Lila expected her reaction to an extent. There was certainly a reason why Dawson was a better head than his fellow Senior, Lila started seeing that reason as being braver and more willing to take risks. She had to help her with it eventually but now was not the time.</p>
<p><em>Edith favors me anyways, maybe I should just keep Senior calm and quiet for today.</em></p>
<p>“I get it. Then maybe you should just keep the stern face. Just try not to overexpress your feelings, okay?”</p>
<p>“Well … Okay, I will.”</p>
<p>She did not look completely convinced but Lila seemed satisfied with the response.</p>
<p>“Good. Now let’s head in.” There was no time to hesitate. Edith was already suspiciously staring at the two while they loitered at the entrance.</p>
