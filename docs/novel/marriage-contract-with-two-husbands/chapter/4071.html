            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guest visiting Duke Postenmeyer’s villa was the priest from the Central Cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The High Priest of our Cathedral will officiate the wedding ceremony, Your Highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We appreciate your acceptance, Priest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The High Priest will arrive on the day of the wedding. I heard there is a church on this estate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not a church, but we have a small chapel for prayer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melchor is an atheist and never visited the Cathedral, but the Empire required noble families who governed a certain size of land to construct a church or chapel for praying to God in their home. This was meant to signify the divine nature of nobility’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Postenmeyer Mansion in the capital was a villa and not the main house, but because it was so large, a small chapel was built following the imperial building regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Melchor nor Roseline used the chapel, but the faithful servants who worked at the mansion did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Very well. We will have our wedding there. Please add it to the church’s schedule, and sign this document. You can provide your last name and maiden name.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline wrote her name on the bride’s list offered by the priest. After signing her autograph, the priest glanced at the list and raised his eyebrows while checking her name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, the name is… Roselyn?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s Roseline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Hmm. I’m not used to the Western pronunciation…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The capital city was a mixture of Eastern and Western cultures, but it appeared that the visiting priest was from the East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Roseline’s hometown, western aristocrats despised eastern pronunciation as dry and hard, while eastern aristocrats looked down on western pronunciation as soft and weak. Even within the same country, cultures could differ significantly. Roseline sighed, thinking that meeting and dealing with people in the East after her wedding would be more challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Melchor had called her Roselyn from the start, making her wonder if he was from the West too. She felt like she was under some sort of spell since an unrelated person had the same name, face, skill, and place of origin as her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, please, Priest,” Roseline said, dismissing the priest after he had left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*****</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning to the office, she was followed by the butler, Hugo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s going on, Hugo?” Roseline asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your new servants will arrive tomorrow,” he replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My new servants?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When Your Excellency requested more workers, he told me to bring in talented people from my family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline quickly responded, “I’m not unhappy with my meal right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hugo explained that he had contacted his parents to bring a maid and a cook, so the meals would be better. He added that when Roseline returned to the East, she would have to get used to eating the dishes prepared by the Postenmeyer family chef.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Excellency also instructed me to take very good care of you,” Hugo said, quickly dropping Melchor’s name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Hugo’s words, Roseline overheard a conversation between the servants the previous night, which made her distrust the butler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Are the maids arriving tomorrow? Prepare a room for the servants in the annex.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be more crowded when the servants of the family come in, but there will be no problem because they will be experienced in their work. They decided to have a small wedding anyway, so there’s nothing else to prepare. We can go to the east after finishing the work there.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I go to the east, I’ll be busy from then on, but I can stay quiet until then.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">******</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning, Princess Annestrote arrived at the Grand Duchess’s chamber. Usually, only those with appointments were allowed to enter, even the most powerful nobles. However, Princess Annestrote, who had been appointed the next empress, was unstoppable. Disregarding her butler’s request to wait in the waiting room, she made her way to the first-floor hall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grand Duchess of Postenmeyer, my name is Annestrote. It’s a pleasure to meet you,” she greeted upon arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nice to meet you too, Princess,” replied the Grand Duchess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The butler was in a state of confusion, which was unusual. The hall was filled with colorful and large boxes, and workers were constantly bringing goods in from the cart. One of the large boxes had magic stones pierced into the four ears of the lid, filled with dazzling jewels that would blind anyone who looked at them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is all of this?” asked the Grand Duchess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a gift from the imperial family to congratulate the marriage of Grand Duke Postenmeyer and his wife. The preparations were made by both majesties, and I came as the imperial representative,” explained Princess Annestrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite arriving without an appointment and occupying the hall, Princess Annestrote was proud. Roseline had heard rumors that the Grand Duke was her nephew, but she never imagined that she would meet her in person. Although Roseline hesitated, the princess confidently approached her and shook her hand vigorously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nice to meet you, Grand Duchess. Could you tell me your name?” asked Princess Annestrote, her handshake quite forceful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry for the late introduction. This is Roseline Postenmeyer,” replied the Grand Duchess.</span></p>
