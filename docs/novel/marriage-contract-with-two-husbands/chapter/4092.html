            <p>The season was beginning to enter summer, but the emperor felt a chill in his heart. It was probably the thick curtains on the windows which blocked the sunlight.</p>
<p>“It’s a sunny day, but you’re so cold.”</p>
<p>He sat on his throne with his hands on his chin. He sighed deeply. His white hair flowed down to one side. His red eyes stared at Melchor. It would have been a picturesque sight if the emperor wasn’t so annoying.</p>
<p>“I would like you to let me go if you are done with your whining. I have work to do on my eastern estate. I would rather finish my work fast and spend my time with Roseline”, said Melchor.</p>
<p>He didn’t particularly dislike the emperor. He had a duty to himself and certainly wanted to be loyal. However, as the emperor’s right-hand man, it was his job to oversee the country, advise the emperor, and protect him. Melchor didn’t think that the job description included listening to the emperor’s idiotic whining.</p>
<p>“I am mistaken to expect any compassion from you.”</p>
<p>“You know that very well,” affirmed Melchor inwardly.</p>
<p>“You reported your wedding, but you have mentioned nothing about the ceremony. Are you going back to the east and not the capital?”</p>
<p>“We won’t be holding a wedding ceremony.”</p>
<p>“What? Why?” The emperor sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>The emperor looked dizzy, having stood up so quickly. But it didn’t seem like he would fall anytime soon, so Melchor didn’t extend his hand for support.</p>
<p>“There’s no need.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean there’s no need?”</p>
<p><em>I am already concerned about what the empress might be planning next. I don’t want to have a public ceremony because I want to keep Roseline as safe as possible.</em> Melchor didn’t say this aloud.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to show my bride to anyone,” said Melchor.</p>
<p>His response shocked the emperor. Melchor is so greedy that he doesn’t want his bride to be seen by another man.</p>
<p>He had never expected Melchor to be so orthodox. The emperor had been surprised when Melchor said he wanted the wedding to be legally binding even when his parents were against it. He had never considered Melchor had such deep feelings.</p>
<p>The emperor looked at Melchor and thought he was being sincere. Melchor’s expression was too serious to be otherwise.</p>
<p>“I see. Our Melchor…….”</p>
<p>There is no ‘our’ between you and me, Melchor added to himself.</p>
<p>“But it’s an opportunity to welcome the Grand Duchess of Postenmeyer. If the Grand Duke doesn’t even have a wedding ceremony, what will the other nobles do in the future?”</p>
<p>“The Postenmeyer family is just a vassal. How can I affect other nobles just because I decide not to have a ceremony?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about, Melchor?”</p>
<p>Melchor frowned. Sometimes Emperor Baltazar liked getting too close to him as if he were his friend or his brother.</p>
<p>“Tell me honestly,” said the emperor. “Why don’t you want to have a wedding ceremony? I can’t allow that without a strong reason. The marriage of nobility is a matter of great importance and a cause for celebration.”</p>
<p><em>“Your Majesty….” Melchor sighed. Your wife, Empress Wilhelmine, seems to be targeting Roseline. I can’t expose her to danger.” </em>Although he can’t tell him that.</p>
<p>“She is in mourning,” the best alibi Melchor can say.</p>
<p>“Oh… I see.”</p>
<p>Count Crimson Rose had recently died. He was killed. His crimes had been comparable to treason, he was not even allowed a funeral. The body was buried in the cemetery without a tombstone. That was what was done to criminals.</p>
<p>“I see,” said the emperor again. “The Grand Duchess lost her father.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Melchor. “I can’t hold a funeral for her father. But it seems rather disrespectful for me to insist on a wedding ceremony when she is still mourning for her family.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. You have grown to be considerate of others’ emotions. You grew up well…”</p>
<p>Melchor wasn’t sure why the story was turning in the direction of admiration for his deeds. He was relieved at the emperor’s response, so he didn’t refute it. He wanted to be done with this conversation.</p>
<p>“I understand,” said the emperor. “But it won’t look good for me who hastily approved your marriage. Make sure you have a ceremony, even if not so grand, shortly.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>He will call a priest and bribe him to do the ceremony for the sake of it. Melchor didn’t intend to invite the emperor and the empress. Melchor bid the emperor goodbye and left the palace.</p>
