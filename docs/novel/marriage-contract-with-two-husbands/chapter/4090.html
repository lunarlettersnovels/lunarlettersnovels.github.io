<div class="sc-iCfMLu bZHFRR">Roseline took down some books related to the Postenmeyer family from the library. At the academy, they did teach the history of some great noble families, including the Grand Duke’s family. But the academy did not really get into personal matters relating to these families.</div>
</div>
<div class="sc-1sp3zau-0 jaefFT sc-1di2uql-0 tiegV" data-tag="post-content">So, Roseline’s knowledge of the Grand Duke and his family was superficial. She wanted to check the records kept in the family library. Otherwise, it was close to impossible to understand how the family operated.<p></p>
<p><em>I was worried that there would be no records at all here in the capital, but I am glad I found a copy.</em></p>
<p>She heard that the mansion in the east also had a library. This library held records of every event that ever occurred in the family.</p>
<p><em>I should keep track of all the records in this place.</em></p>
<p>73.6 million gold. That was how much Roseline owed Melchor. It was an unrealistic amount. Melchor had never asked her to pay it back but Roseline felt uncomfortable brushing it off. Roseline would do anything since it was such a huge debt that she owed him.</p>
<p><em>The Grand Duchess is the vicar of the Grand Duke. I’ve got to try to get things done in the right way.</em></p>
<p>Roseline felt like she had just gotten a job as a property manager rather than having married. But it didn’t matter.</p>
<p><em>Competition among the heirs of the Postenmeyer family. Melchor became the head of the estate through the test.</em></p>
<p>Heirs to the Postenmeyer family are tested and then selected to compete with each other again.  The best person inherits the estate and becomes the head. It was a system created by the past Grand Dukes to avoid corruption. Otherwise, many problems would appear if the title was passed down to the eldest son.</p>
<p><em>Melchor was also from the proletariat.</em></p>
<p>His parents died when he was young. He participated in the test just before his coming-of-age ceremony. It had taken only a year for him to prove himself and officially inherit the title from his predecessor. It meant that the time he spent with the previous Postenmeyer family had been extremely short.</p>
<p><em>Melchor must have had no choice but to think of himself as special and to just venture into it.</em></p>
<p>A childhood spent without a family. He was sent to the capital to live in the dormitory of the academy because he had no relatives who cared about him. Roseline understood him. She was sent to boarding school when her brother was born, as though she wasn’t needed anymore.</p>
<p>But Melchor had met someone special. <em>How did she disappear?</em></p>
<p>If he had not been able to find her using the title of the Grand Duke of Postenmeyer, she might not exist in this world today. <em>Is that why he decided to marry me so easily and give up on Roselyne?</em></p>
<p>Melchor couldn’t bring himself to forget her, that was clear. He had noticed the similarity in her swordsmanship with the one who disappeared. If he didn’t find a corpse or at least a grave of Roselyne, he will forever hold her in his heart.</p>
<p><em>Why am I even thinking about it? I don’t even know her.</em></p>
<p>Their marriage wasn’t based on love or affection. It was an arrangement. She didn’t need to pay attention to her husband’s past. It shouldn’t matter to her.</p>
<p>But Roseline was curious.</p>
<p>She wanted to find out what kind of person this Roselyne was. She wanted to know why Melchor was so obsessed with her that he would even marry someone who looked similar just to save her from certain death.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door. It pulled Roseline to the present. She lifted her head.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Roseline.</p>
<p>“Your mother and younger brother have arrived, My Lady.” It was Nicholas, a servant who had been sent to relay the news.</p>
<p>“Mother and Alfons?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my Lady.”</p>
<p>“Are they already here at the mansion? Where are they now?”</p>
<p>“They were in the VIP room on the fourth floor.”</p>
<p>“Alright. I will go and see them right away.”</p>
<p>Roseline got up from her desk and cleared the books. She had scribbled Roselyne’s name on a blank piece of paper when she was lost in thought. She looked at it, then scrunched it up and threw it in the trash.</p>
