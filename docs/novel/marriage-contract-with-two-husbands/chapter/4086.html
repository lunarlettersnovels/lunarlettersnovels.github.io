            <p>Roseline stood up in her seat. The VIP room was large and luxurious enough to accommodate two people. It was larger than the Crimson Rose mansion’s room.</p>
<p>“All right, since I’m Alfons’ sister, I’ll take responsibility for Alfons in this mansion.” But now I must reflect… I’m already married, I’m no longer my mother’s daughter, and there’s no reason for me to look after you.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“This is the Postenmeyer family’s residence in the capital.” As the Postenmeyer family’s hostess, I have a say in everything that happens in this house.”</p>
<p>Roseline indicated the VIP room’s door.</p>
<p>“Countess Crimson Rose, get out.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The corridor was quiet.</p>
<p>When the sun goes down, the moon rises, and the earth begins to sink into darkness. Roseline strolled down the corridor.</p>
<p>Even after washing her eyes and looking for it, a man’s shadow is invisible. It was crowded with people who came to become employees in the morning, but it is now quiet.</p>
<p>The butler would have hired him on his own, and it will be quite noisy in a few days.</p>
<p>Roseline descended the stairs into a corridor lit up with scarlet lights. The first-floor hall was spacious and quiet.</p>
<p>Roseline felt someone outside the door as she opened it to leave. She wasn’t surprised because she recognized the person.</p>
<p>“Where are you going, Roseline?”</p>
<p>Roseline was about to open the door and greet him, but Melchor interrupted her.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about fleeing tonight.”</p>
<p>“Because of that one signature on our wedding vows?”</p>
<p>“I’m only kidding. I was planning on going for a walk to get some fresh air.”</p>
<p>“It’s dark because the sun is going down.” I’ll go with you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. “I’ll go by myself.”</p>
<p>“You can’t do it.”</p>
<p>Melchor did not enter but remained outside. It’s like waiting for Roseline to appear.</p>
<p>“This guy is indeed the real obstinate one, not me,” Roseline muttered softly.</p>
<p>Melchor asked, a little puzzled, as Roseline stepped out, feeling a little unfair.</p>
<p>“Your eyes are bright red. “Have been you ill?”</p>
<p>People frequently inquire, ‘Did you cry?’</p>
<p>Roseline found it amusing, but Melchor was such a gentleman that she didn’t mind and turned her gaze to the side.</p>
<p>“Simply leave it alone.”</p>
<p>“I can’t do it.” Because I’m your spouse.”</p>
<p>Roseline grinned.</p>
<p>To avoid punishment, they entered a snatch marriage in which a woman who resembled the woman he loved was placed as a substitute.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Melchor claimed to be her husband, and Roseline felt relieved for no apparent reason, as if she had heard reassuring words.</p>
<p>“Defiance isn’t always a bad thing.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“I’m conversing with myself.”</p>
<p>Roseline shook her head and exited the open door. The cool night air entered her nostrils.</p>
<p>There was an odd sense of freedom.</p>
<p>Roseline is unsure whether her comfort comes from inhaling the cold air or from Melchor’s consolation. She had the impression that she had come out to fight.</p>
<p>Because the Grand Duke’s stay was brief, the landscape in the capital mansion was somewhat desolate. The garden was not cultivated, despite being neatly kept, and there are no decorative elements, so the road is wide and there is nothing to see.</p>
<p>It was fortunate that the moon was visible in the sky.</p>
<p>“The moon is shining brightly.”</p>
<p>“Because there is a full moon.”</p>
<p>The two took their time walking through the garden. Melchor calculated in his head as he looked at Roseline’s figure as she walked looking at the moon.</p>
<p>“I’m staying here for two months and intend to hire a gardener.”</p>
<p>Roseline has already instructed her butler Hugo to hire servants, but finding a competent gardener will be difficult. Perhaps it would be better to bring in the main house servants.</p>
<p>“I need to talk to you about the wedding, Roseline.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you were going to skip it?”</p>
<p>“Unless there is a special reason, the Emperor said, a ceremony should be held.” That is why it is preferable to do it informally.”</p>
<p>“I see. “How big are the guests?”</p>
<p>“At the very least, summoning the priest and taking the vows and oaths is sufficient.” However, because your family has been here for a long time, it is preferable to invite people close to you.”</p>
<p>“Family… yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>Roseline’s expression darkened once more. Melchor, who had no idea she had recently kicked her mother out of the house, failed to notice Roseline’s negative reaction.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>After all, aren’t weddings inconvenient? Was Melchor disappointing because he changed his mind?</p>
<p>“Of course, if you don’t want to, you don’t have to. “I’ll tell his Majesty again,” Melchor continued.</p>
<p>“No, let’s go for it. Melchor, more than that.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Blue and green eyes lit each other up in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Roseline’s gaze moved from his eyes to his lips, then to the left and diagonally to the side.</p>
<p>The gaze that had remained on his left shoulder, which Roseline would have stabbed, moved to the right, circled in the air, and turned towards the brightly shining full moon.</p>
<p>“How are your wounds?”</p>
