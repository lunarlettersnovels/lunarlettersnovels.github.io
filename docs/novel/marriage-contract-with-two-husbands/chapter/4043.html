<p>Roseline was well aware of the Postenmeyer family’s reputation and status, and she knew that a family of their stature could easily secure a marriage with another prominent family of equal rank or even with the royal family. There was no need for them to seek marriage with the daughter of the Korean-American Crimson Rose family by falsely claiming her to be the daughter of a criminal.</p>
<p>But if the head of the Postenmeyer family had some flaw or weakness, then a family of equal standing would not want to send their children into such a marriage. That was why Melchor had picked her.</p>
<p>She knew of his unusual sexual desires but could not ask for a divorce, even if she wanted to. Melchor had the upper hand, both situationally and psychologically, and had revealed his secret desires with confidence. It was a situation that left Roseline feeling uncomfortable, but if it was just a matter of conversation, she thought she could handle it.</p>
<p>She had heard stories of spouses who were troubled by their partners’ behavior in the bedroom, and she was relieved that Melchor was not that kind of person. If it was just a matter of talking, even if it was somewhat unconventional, she could endure it.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s give it a try. I owe you that much,” Roseline said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a voluntary decision, but she owed Melchor anyway, and divorce was not an option at the moment. If a few conversations could make their marriage easier, it was not a bad deal.</p>
<p>Melchor offered to talk more about his desires, but Roseline hesitated, saying that it was a bit sudden and embarrassing. However, she agreed to spend more time talking, little by little. It was a positive change, and Melchor was genuinely proud of himself.</p>
<p>He realized that communicating with his wife was the key to a better relationship, and he was grateful for Heinz’s advice. As they talked, Melchor’s icy expression began to melt away, and he felt truly happy.</p>
<p>Neither of them knew that their conversation was a turning point in their relationship, but they were both content with the progress they had made.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Roseline struggled to convey her story to others. It wasn’t always this way. As a child, she had been able to express herself well. However, over time, she lost confidence due to her parents’ indifference and favoritism. Now, she no longer felt the need to fix it.</p>
<p>She believed that it was better to keep things to herself, especially if she wasn’t confident in dealing with the aftermath of sharing her thoughts. Not because they would cause controversy but because they could hurt her feelings. So, she kept her worries to herself, only bringing them up when necessary, and forgetting about them if they became too distressing.</p>
<p>However, there was one difference between the present and the past. Instead of wielding a sword to forget her anxiety, Roseline took a quiet walk in the garden.</p>
<p>“Nicolas, I think the lawn is a little long,” Roseline said.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell the gardener to trim it,” replied Nicolas.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t planning on having a garden party, but this is the Postenmeyer family’s capital mansion. Didn’t you usually take care of it properly?” asked Roseline.</p>
<p>“Technically speaking, I wasn’t an employee of the mansion. I was only Melchor’s subordinate, and the number of servants employed was too small to take care of the garden,” replied Nicolas.</p>
<p>While he didn’t know the details, he tried to keep Roseline’s oath to assist Melchor without causing any inconvenience. Roseline never ordered him to do anything, but if asked about the situation at the mansion, he would answer truthfully.</p>
<p>“The eastern mansion must be much bigger than here, right?” asked Roseline.</p>
<p>“Its nature is 100 times larger than here, and the garden is wider,” replied Nicolas.</p>
<p>Roseline was not surprised. The Postenmeyer family was the most prestigious family in the empire, and this capital mansion was already bigger than that of the Crimson Rose family. However, it was 100 times bigger than the capital mansion. Walking in the garden almost made her feel lost.</p>
<p>“This place is also spacious,” Roseline said with a light sigh. She tilted her head when she saw a path through the red rose bushes.</p>
<p>“Where does this road lead to?”</p>
<p>The garden was divided by the main house, and there were separate houses on both sides of the garden, but there was nothing in this direction. Roseline stepped into wonder but suddenly felt a cool breeze that made her close her eyes. When she opened them, the whole place was full of tall trees.</p>
<p>“What?” Roseline exclaimed.</p>
<p>She looked back and around, but she couldn’t see Nicolas. Had she walked too far? She had only taken a few steps, and she couldn’t hear Nicolas calling her even if she listened carefully.</p>
<p>“That’s weird,” Roseline said to herself.</p>
<p>She thought that perhaps Nicolas had lost sight of her while looking away for a moment, but she couldn’t find him anywhere. She raised her head and saw that the trees had grown thick enough to cover the sky.</p>
<p>“I’ll really get lost in the eastern mansion,” Roseline muttered.</p>
<p>She moved toward the east, trying not to walk recklessly. The garden of the capital mansion was not that wide because the trees were lush, so if she went in one direction, she would find the end. There was an option to stand still and wait for Nicolas to come, but she thought it would be better to move because the garden wasn’t that big, and she wouldn’t get lost.</p>
<p>However, as she continued walking, the same scenery repeated itself, and Roseline slowly became suspicious of whether she had misjudged the situation.</p>
<p>“It’s weird. It’s not supposed to be this wide.”</p>
<p>In the capital city, no mansion was grander than the Imperial Palace, but the Postenmeyer family villa was still impressive. While it wasn’t as vast or complex as the noble families’ capital villas, it was still large enough to lose oneself in the garden. Roseline had checked the map and confirmed this with the butler, Hugo, and the housekeeper, Johanna.</p>
<p>As she walked along, Roseline couldn’t help but feel disoriented. Although she could see the fence or the building in one direction, the surroundings seemed to remain the same, as if she were spinning in place. She contemplated marking the road to ensure she didn’t get lost, but then she heard a boy’s exclamation nearby.</p>
<p>“Oh…!”</p>
<p>Following the sound, Roseline recognized the familiar face of Julian.</p>
<p>“Julian!”</p>
<p>“You’re here.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no…. Hello.”</p>
<p>He greeted Roseline a little awkwardly, seeming hesitant but honest. They both expressed surprise at running into each other again.</p>
<p>“How did you get here?” Roseline asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I… This forest is close to the academy.”</p>
<p>Roseline looked around and realized that they were in a dense forest, far from the well-maintained road she had been walking on earlier. She had entered the forest again, where she had met Julian before.</p>
<p>“I see. Nice to see you again, Julian.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Long time, no see.”</p>
<p>They chatted for a while, catching up on what they had been doing since their last encounter. As they talked, Roseline wondered if Melchor’s mansion was connected to the forest in the park. It seemed unlikely, given the distance between them, but the map indicated that the proportion of green space was not that large. Perhaps it was bigger than she had thought.</p>
<p>In any case, Roseline decided not to dwell on it too much and to enjoy her unexpected reunion with Julian.</p>
