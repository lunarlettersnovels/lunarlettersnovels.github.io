        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>At the outer castle of the Imperial Palace, Gertrude stood waiting for Melchor to arrive at the office of Grand Duke Postenmeyer, which was strictly off-limits to outsiders. Once he arrived, she could only enter the room.</p>
<p>Melchor acknowledged Gertrude’s presence and inquired, “I see you, Your Excellency. Indeed, rumors have been made that the Grand Duchess is unusual.” Gertrude lowered her gaze, feeling her heart contract just by making eye contact.</p>
<p>“Roseline sent you here?” Melchor asked.</p>
<p>Gertrude confirmed and proceeded to explain the base silhouette chosen by Roseline, displaying three designs she had selected from the catalog.</p>
<p>“She chose these three for detailed decoration. She said you are the one to choose….”</p>
<p>Melchor questioned, “ Me? “</p>
<p>Gertrude answered, “Yes.”</p>
<p>The three dress decorations chosen by Roseline were the highest-priced decorations, the most expensive decorations, and the lowest-priced decorations, respectively.</p>
<p>Although it was a wedding ceremony before the emperor and empress, Roseline couldn’t choose a shabby dress. Therefore, she selected the best-priced handmade lace decoration. However, as Melchor desired an unnoticed wedding, a simple dress couldn’t be excluded. Thus, she chose the pearl decoration as inexpensively as possible to the extent that it would not detract from the bride’s appearance.</p>
<p>After selecting two dresses, the gap seemed too wide. Therefore, Roseline chose one more reasonably priced design, resulting in three choices.</p>
<p>Melchor, unaware of women’s dresses, didn’t know that there was a significant price difference between the three dress decorations in the book since he hadn’t heard the prices.</p>
<p>Melchor believed that Roseline couldn’t decide which of the three dress decorations she liked, so she sent the book to Gertrude.</p>
<p>“If Roseline likes it, I can buy all three. What do you think is hard?” he asked nonchalantly, covering the catalog’s face and holding it out to Gertrude.</p>
<p>“Let’s order all three,” he declared.</p>
<p>Gertrude was surprised. “What?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t Roseline say she chose three things? Then I’ll order all three with different decorations.”</p>
<p>Gertrude pointed out, “Oh, but the Duke. She  can’t wear all three at the ceremony.”</p>
<p>Melchor realized his mistake and nodded.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s what it is.”</p>
<p>Although one could purchase any clothes they desired, only one dress could be worn at a time. Melchor recognized that Roseline had sent him three dress options she liked and asked him to choose one for the ceremony.</p>
<p>He almost made a mistake with a quick thought. Melchor opened the catalog with a relaxed face, hiding his relief, and examined the three-decorated dress.</p>
<p>All three dresses seemed suitable for Roseline. Melchor had never said it out loud, but he truly believed that anything would look good on Roseline. She seemed to prefer casual and comfortable attire, but she looked stunning in anything she wore. There was nothing out of place, such as rough horseback riding clothes, elegant indoor clothes, and elegant outdoor clothes. If it didn’t suit Roseline, it wasn’t a dress.</p>
<p>Therefore, there was only one criterion for deciding which dress to choose from.</p>
<p>“What dress do you think suits me?” Melchor asked.</p>
<p>Gertrude was taken aback. “……what?”</p>
<p>All three dresses looked good on Roseline, and Melchor was sure of that. So he decided that it was meaningless to think about which dress would suit her better and changed his perspective. He thought about which dress would make Roséline stand out the most when she wore it next to him.</p>
<p>Gertrude, who had no way of knowing Melchor’s thoughts, was embarrassed by his question.</p>
<p>“What? Wasn’t it about choosing a dress for the Grand Duchess? Why are you asking me what suits you?”</p>
<p>Gertrude looked at the drawings he gave her and confirmed that they were for women’s dresses. There were no men’s suits in the collection, and she found it odd that he was asking her about dresses.</p>
<p>She suddenly remembered that Duke Melchor had originally planned to have a private wedding ceremony with only close relatives in the chapel attached to his mansion. The Empress had said that it was to prevent the news of the marriage from spreading, but Gertrude found it strange. It was uncommon for the most prestigious aristocrats of the Empire to leave for their fiefdom immediately after a private ceremony.</p>
<p>Gertrude began to wonder if there was another reason for the private ceremony. “Don’t tell me your taste in cross-dressing is…?” she asked, her expression filled with shock and confusion.</p>
<p>Melchor didn’t like to talk to his opponents for a long time. He always conveyed his business simply and didn’t like to engage in small talk. So his conversation with Gertrude was also very concise. He omitted all the secondary words and gave only orders for direct action.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Gertrude was well-known for understanding even what the client did not say. She had to take Melchor’s words as an extension of what ordinary ladies had metaphorically said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Gertrude had completely misjudged Melchor’s intentions. He had a habit of finishing all his thoughts in his head and only revealing his conclusions. She had mistakenly assumed that Melchor was interested in dressing up as a woman and was attempting to secretly marry Roselaine in a dress.</p>
<p>Gertrude was an artist with a designer’s soul, who had been approached by the empress for her unconventional dress designs. She accepted the fact that men might want to wear dresses, without any reservations or doubts.</p>
<p>If Gertrude had been an ordinary person, she would have asked for a detailed explanation of what was meant by “choosing a dress suitable for the Grand Duke.” This would have prevented any misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Gertrude had a broad and free way of thinking as an artist, which allowed her to understand unconventional language and creative ideas even when they didn’t make sense to others. This led to her misunderstanding Melchor’s intentions.</p>
<p>As the situation changed and they were forced to hold a public wedding outdoors, Melchor decided to reveal his secret to the world after much consideration. He had made his decision, and there was no going back.</p>
<p>With an open mind, the artist within Gertrude embraces the diversity of the world. As a designer and a human being, she deeply respects the courage, boldness, and taste of Melchor. When he hands her the book, Gertrude accepts it with a grim expression, her mind racing with creative possibilities.</p>
<p>Melchor stands tall, exuding an ice-cold aura that demands attention. His plain clothes seem inadequate for his presence, and Gertrude can’t help but think that something more extravagant would suit him better. She suggests a shiny outfit for the upcoming wedding, and Melchor agrees. Gertrude nods firmly, pleased to have found the perfect outfit for the Grand Duke.</p>
<p>As Melchor turns his attention to the documents on his desk, Gertrude feels a moment of embarrassment. She wonders if she has overstepped her bounds by assuming that Melchor would choose the lace dress she suggested. But when she asks him if he has decided which dress he wants to wear, Melchor seems confused.</p>
<p>Gertrude realizes that Melchor had indeed chosen the lace dress she suggested, but for a different reason than she had expected. He had chosen it because he believed that Roséline, his wife, would look stunning in it. Gertrude can’t help but smile at Melchor’s thoughtfulness, even though it means that he and his wife will be wearing matching lace outfits.</p>
<p>Gertrude has always avoided matching outfits, even with her twin sister at home. But as she looks at Melchor, she realizes that sometimes, breaking the rules can lead to unexpected beauty.</p>
<p>No woman would want to wear a dress that is designed to grab attention and show off her individuality, only to find someone else wearing the exact same outfit at a party. In this era, clothing is seen as a powerful form of self-expression, and the idea of accidentally twinning with someone on the street can create a tense and uncomfortable atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, Melchor, as a man, tends to prefer clothing that is similar to what others are wearing. This creates a sense of homogeneity and belonging, as is the case with uniforms and other attire designed for group identity.</p>
<p>Gertrude couldn’t help but chuckle as she imagined Melchor’s reaction to her suggestion of matching outfits for him and his wife at the upcoming event.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency wants to feel a sense of unity as a couple by wearing the same dress as the Grand Duchess!” she exclaimed, her words dripping with sarcasm.</p>
<p>Despite her reservations about the idea, Gertrude couldn’t deny that there was something sweet about the thought of Melchor and his wife wearing matching outfits. Maybe it was the romantic in her, but she couldn’t help but imagine the couple strolling through the event, their matching lace outfits a symbol of their love and commitment to each other.</p>
<p>Still, Gertrude couldn’t help but wonder if the couple would regret their decision if they ended up twinning with someone else at the party. Regardless, she knew that fashion was all about taking risks and expressing oneself, even if it meant breaking a few unwritten rules along the way.</p>
