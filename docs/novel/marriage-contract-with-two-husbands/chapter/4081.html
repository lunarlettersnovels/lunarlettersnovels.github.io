            <p>Melchor had no idea Roseline was arguing with the Countess.</p>
<p>You are not required to contact your family. I was going to tell the priest to recite the vow quickly and then put it away. Melchor pondered.</p>
<p>“Melchor.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“How much do I look like your Roselyn?”</p>
<p>It was a surprising question. Melchor’s stomach churned for no apparent reason, but he couldn’t stop himself from answering the question. He responded by turning his gaze away from the black wooded garden in the distance.</p>
<p>“…to the point where I mistook myself for the same person.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Roseline is a brunette with reddish-orange hair and green eyes. a woman who uses swords in a unique way that no one else can.</p>
<p>Roseline might have misidentified Roselyn as herself if she hadn’t known Melchor had met her ten years before.</p>
<p>“I thought it was strange to marry just because I resembled the person you liked, but I was an idiot for thinking that.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I would have been in prison if I didn’t look like her, and I was worried.”</p>
<p>Melchor was powerless to refuse. Melchor was only concerned with the fact that the Empress had moved her army ahead of the Emperor, so he went to investigate the East Sea.</p>
<p>Melchor might not have saved her if it hadn’t been for Roseline, who was being humiliated on the spot.</p>
<p>He would not have taken over her personal life and tried to protect her in his own villa even if he had rescued her.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about it for a few days now. It was also stated in the letter of disapproval that I resented you for taking care of things without my permission. In any case, everything worked out well for me.”</p>
<p>Melchor became terrified of confronting Roseline. No, he’s a fearless human being, so he should express his discomfort.</p>
<p>Melchor didn’t always feel confident when he saw her.</p>
<p>Roseline’s voice, on the other hand, remained calm until the very end.</p>
<p>“It was fortunate for me. You might be let down.”</p>
<p>“I’m not disappointed in you, Roseline.”</p>
<p>“You want the genuine Roselyn.”</p>
<p>Melchor was unable to respond. In silence, he clutched the railing. The stone railing was thick and firm enough to lean against, but it looked like any other railing in the hands of a large Melchor.</p>
<p>“I really wanted you.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Because it was you I was trying to save.”</p>
<p>Melchor is aware that it isn’t. But it was a plausible alibi. He saved her because she resembled Roselyn, but he also wanted to save Roseline.</p>
<p>Melchor did not consider it a substitute. It’s not even a dream.</p>
<p>Melchor’s attempt to understand Roseline’s mood now had nothing to do with Roselyn, despite the fact that Roselyn was the reason he was interested in Roseline.</p>
<p>“You had no idea about me.”</p>
<p>“… … .”</p>
<p>“But you were gracious to me. It’s fantastic to be able to do that to strangers. Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>Melchor turned his head and looked at Roseline as she spoke.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, her hair appears purple rather than red, and her green eyes sparkle brightly. When was the last time he saw such eyes up close?</p>
<p>It hasn’t been years. Melchor hasn’t seen Roseline in over a month.</p>
<p>He’s only now seeing it for the first time.</p>
<p>“It’s too late to change anything. I apologize.” Roseline went on.</p>
<p>“You are not required to apologize.”</p>
<p>“I’ll repay you later.”</p>
<p>Melchor felt a sharp pain in his chest when he heard the word.</p>
<p>He lied to her, apparently, and Roseline thanked him and offered to repay him. Melchor couldn’t figure out why he felt so uneasy after being promised a reward.</p>
<p>“You are not required to repay me.”</p>
<p>“What? But…”</p>
<p>Melchor despised seeing what he had given her as a way to repay him. He hoped she liked it when she got it. When Roseline said she would repay his kindness, it felt more like a stranger.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to be able to pay me back anyway.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sharp remark was made. Melchor closed his mouth in surprise, but he couldn’t recall what he had said. Roseline stared at him, her eyes wide open and slowly blinking.</p>
<p>“You have everything: status, power, wealth.”</p>
<p>His sword skills were even better than Roseline’s. She was powerless to help him.</p>
<p>Roseline gave a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Roseline could not rise to an equal position because she could not repay even if she received grace.</p>
<p>What is the point of getting up? It has no significance.</p>
<p>Roseline believed Melchor had made a hasty decision to marry her and would soon demand a divorce when things calmed down and interest waned.</p>
<p>Okay. That type of relationship is simply not appropriate. I’m not getting married because I want to.</p>
<p>Is it because he never proposed?</p>
<p>Roseline obviously signed the document as “Roseline Postenmeyer” and was addressed as “Madam” by her servants, but Roseline didn’t feel married to Melchor.</p>
<p>She even considered taking a job as a caretaker for the Postenmeyer family.</p>
<p>“I will do my best not to become anyone in your or the Postenmeyer families’ names.”</p>
<p>“Roseline, I……”</p>
<p>“I believe that’s the best I can do as long as I’m your wife.”</p>
<p>Roseline’s eyes seemed to be lonely.</p>
<p>“As long as I’m your wife.”</p>
<p>She appeared to have drawn a line.</p>
<p>Melchor had something he wanted to say to her. He wanted to explain because she appeared to be misinterpreting him. But he was at a loss for words.</p>
