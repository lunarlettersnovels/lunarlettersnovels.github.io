            <p>There is no need to change the current system if Melchor is not married to Roséline. However, with Roséline’s presence, the situation becomes complicated. Despite her not being their direct employer, she represents the employer. It is a problem that the servants don’t think about her and continue to only work at set times.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think that their job is just to run the mansion, but the reason the employer hired them was to help them. Melchor’s short stay in the villa and lack of involvement in housework changed the meaning of the servants’ jobs without them realizing it. It is necessary to address this issue and put things back on track.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>“Roseline!” Melchor exclaimed as he entered her room, not even taking off his coat.</p>
<p>“You’re early,” Roseline said, looking up from the land management documents she was reading.</p>
<p>Melchor quickly explained, “I heard there was a fire.”</p>
<p>“It was just a small one on the outskirts, it didn’t spread anywhere else. The building is burned black, though,” Roseline informed him.</p>
<p>“Is it okay?” Melchor asked, with concern in his voice.</p>
<p>“No, the inside is burnt out and it’s not usable. I didn’t clean out the burnt items because they’re planning to tear it down in the winter anyway, but should I have cleaned them?”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant,” Melchor said, pausing for a moment before continuing. “I’m asking if you’re okay.”</p>
<p>“I’m…fine,” Roseline replied, unsure of how to respond.</p>
<p>“I heard you went into the kitchen while it was on fire. Don’t do something so reckless,” Melchor scolded her.</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t gone in and checked, I wouldn’t have known what caused the fire,” Roseline defended herself. “If you spray water on an oil fire, it can cause the flames to spread and cause more damage, or even hurt someone. The fire could have spread before the fire brigade arrived.”</p>
<p>Roseline believed that her actions were not wrong and that her ability to find the cause of the fire would help her gain recognition as the new hostess. She was surprised when Melchor scolded her instead of complimenting her.</p>
<p>“I thought you’d compliment me,” she said, confused.</p>
<p>Melchor apologized and explained that he didn’t mean to blame her, but before he could say more, Roseline handed him the documents she had been reviewing.</p>
<p>“I finished reviewing the documents. Can I send the amendment as it is?”</p>
<p>Melchor hesitated for a moment before answering, “Oh, yes.”</p>
<p>He realized his answer was bitter and wished he could take it back, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Roseline stood up from her chair indifferently and left the room.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Roseline asked, her green eyes wary.</p>
<p>Melchor took a step back, feeling guilty for not having a proper conversation with her.</p>
<p>Roseline was frustrated that Melchor wasn’t opening up to her.</p>
<p>“Roseline, what did you do today?” Melchor asked, trying to start a conversation.</p>
<p>“What? I just gave you what I wrote today,” Roseline said, pointing to the document in Melchor’s hand.</p>
<p>“I was outside securing the wedding hall since this morning. I secured a schedule and drew up a contract. I got lost in the middle and met Julian… I don’t have to tell you. Besides, seeing a ghost is useless, so I decided to skip it. When I returned to the villa with Nicholas, there were servants who had arrived from my parent’s house. I heard a report of a fire from the butler, Hugo. They put out the fire and punished the servants who tried to test her in a dangerous way. After that, as you know, I turned off the lights, sent the servants back, and kept working. Throughout the schedule, I checked the contents, revised the details, and wrote down the instructions for the agent. You came by the time I finished signing.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that…,” Melchor said, realizing that he wasn’t asking about her work. He wanted to know what she saw, what she thought, and what kind of day she had.</p>
<p>“I mean, for lunch today, what did you eat?” Melchor asked, still trying to start a conversation with Roseline.</p>
<p>“…….” Roseline tilted her head, confused by the question. She thought Melchor could just ask the chef about her diet.</p>
<p>“Mashed potatoes, sausages, and veal cutlets in tomato salad,” she answered.</p>
<p>“How did it taste?” Melchor asked, still curious.</p>
<p>“Taste?” Roseline repeated herself, still not understanding why Melchor was asking. Melchor had not yet dined with Roseline. He had been busy, leaving the mansion at dawn and coming back at night.</p>
<p>He wanted to know if Roseline was eating properly. But, of course, if she hadn’t been eating properly, the butler would have told him. What Melchor was curious about was her taste in food. However, Roseline, not understanding his intention, answered calmly.</p>
<p>“That’s the taste, you know,” she said, explaining that the specific menu changes, but the diet is always similar as long as the number of people working in the kitchen is the same.</p>
<p>“In the morning, we eat simple dishes of bread and salad with ham and cheese, meat dishes with soup or soup dishes for lunch, and grain bread in a menu similar to lunch but a little simpler,” she added.</p>
<p>“No, I mean… I wanted to hear if you liked the meal, for example, if you want the meat to be cooked more, what kind of bread you like, and what kind of fruits you like to have after the meal. I wanted to know your preferences,” Melchor explained.</p>
<p>“There must be something you want to eat,” he said, hoping she would open up to him.</p>
<p>“Getting used to Eastern food comes first. For that, I brought it from my parent’s house to the kitchen,” Roseline replied, still not sharing her preferences.</p>
<p>“Did you not like the chef’s skills?” Melchor asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not picky about food, so it’s okay,” Roseline said, keeping her answer short and superficial.</p>
<p>Melchor felt nervous and frustrated by Roseline’s lack of openness. He wanted a more private conversation but didn’t know how to have one. He had not had many personal conversations before, and the ones he had were not memorable. Even Heinz, a close friend, didn’t share much about himself.</p>
<p>“Roseline, ask me, too,” Melchor said, hoping that by opening up to her, she would do the same.</p>
<p>“What?” Roseline asked, confused.</p>
<p>“As I asked you, you ask,” Melchor said, using his questions as an example for her to follow. He hoped that she would share more about herself by opening up first.</p>
<p>“Melchor, what did you do today?” Roseline asked, following Melchor’s lead.</p>
<p>“I…” Melchor paused, trying to remember what he had done that day.</p>
<p>He had been busy preparing for his upcoming marriage to Roseline. He had to obtain the Emperor’s permission, and there were a lot of preparations to be made. He’d been working all day and had delegated everything to his assistant, Heinz, after learning of the fire in the mansion. He knew he would have a lot of work to catch up on, so he would have to return to work early the next day.</p>
<p>“I worked today,” Melchor said, feeling guilty for not being able to give her a more interesting answer.</p>
<p>“…….” Roseline didn’t say anything in response.</p>
<p>“I have to work tomorrow, too,” Melchor added, feeling increasingly frustrated.</p>
<p>“…….” Roseline still didn’t respond, her green eyes losing their light as she looked away.</p>
<p>“Work hard,” she finally said, ending the conversation.</p>
<p>Melchor felt frustrated and wanted to hit his chest. He had never felt more acutely that he didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t show it because Roseline was next to him.</p>
