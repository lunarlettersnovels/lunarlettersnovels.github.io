            <p>Melchor, meanwhile, was hard at work in the palace’s office on documents. Melchor used to be the type to deal with things quietly, but he has become sharper these days. Melchor wasn’t feeling bad, but he felt like he was gathering his thoughts on purpose because there was something that might distract him. Heinz, Melchor’s aide for three years, was confident that he understood Melchor’s behavior, especially as he entered his second year of experience, when confidence was high.</p>
<p>“What happened to your wife, Sir?” Melchor’s pen halted on the document as he inquired,</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Heinz said that the wedding pledge had been fulfilled, that the Crimson Rose hat’s safety had been transferred, that the wedding officiant had been invited, and that the two-month stay in the capital had gone well. The rest of the work was always completed, but if Melchor’s mood was particularly agitated, his wife, Roseline, was the only thing to think about.</p>
<p>“I haven’t been able to see Roseline recently. I’m just interested in the news,” Heinz explained.</p>
<p>“Forget about my wife,” Melchor replied.</p>
<p>“Even if you wanted to, you’re not the type to initiate a conversation with someone. Your wife once complained about your majesty not telling her anything,” Heinz pointed out.</p>
<p>Melchor’s brow furrowed as he inquired, “Did Roseline say that?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Do you know how perplexed Damian and I were at the time? We can’t tell you recklessly because your Excellency didn’t tell us, and I feel guilty when I stay still. And you’re now a couple. Your Excellency should have a more private conversation with your wife,” Heinz suggested.</p>
<p>“It’s a private conversation…” Melchor pondered, recalling the last time he had a non-work-related conversation with Roseline. He had attempted to have a more personal conversation with her, but it had not gone well.</p>
<p><em>But what should we discuss?</em></p>
<p>A knock on the office door stopped him in his tracks. The door burst open as soon as he granted permission to enter, and Erich, a knight in a black cape, marched in and saluted.</p>
<p>“Sir, we have a quick report from the Porstenmeyer mansion,” says the dispatcher.</p>
<p>“An unexpected report? What exactly is it?” Melchor inquired, rising from his desk.</p>
<p>“The mansion was on fire,” Erich replied.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Melchor’s chair collapsed as he rushed to the door, making a loud noise. “I need to check on the mansion’s situation,” he said to Heinz, who was following him, before exiting the hallway.</p>
<p>Heinz grabbed Erich, who was attempting to follow Melchor, and demanded more information from him. “Wait a minute, Erich. Is it true that the mansion caught fire?</p>
<p>“Have there been any casualties?”</p>
<p>“There have been no casualties. To be more specific, a fire broke out in a building on the mansion’s western outskirts. The fire department has been called, but…” Erich’s words trailed off, causing Heinz’s face to tighten in concern.</p>
<p>“If it’s outside the mansion, it doesn’t even come close to touching the main building.”</p>
<p>“There is no need to inform His Majesty if there are no casualties,” Heinz said, relieved that the situation was not as serious as he had first thought. He sighed deeply and ran his hand through his unkempt blond hair.</p>
<p>“If he left like that, what should I do with the rest of this work? There is also an agenda that His Majesty must approve by today.”</p>
<p>Spending two months outside without his beloved Benjamin was filthy, but Heinz cringed as his boss abandoned his work and left his seat. “I told you to have a conversation, and you quit,” Heinz said to Erich, his face dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Erich paused for a moment, unsure whether to follow Melchor or stay and assist Heinz with his work. As a knight, he was loyal to his bosses and subordinates, so he decided to go to Heinz and help him pick up the scattered papers.</p>
<p>“Aide Heinz, are you unconcerned? His excellency hastily exited. Do you mind if we don’t go to the mansion together?” Erich inquired, still wary.</p>
<p>“It won’t be a big deal,” Heinz said dismissively, waving his hand.</p>
<p>“Huh? The mansion has a fire, and it’s not a big deal…?” Erich inquired, perplexed.</p>
<p>Heinz sighed, sick of hearing more explanations. “Isn’t that self-evident?” he asked. “I was also attacked when I first joined the Knights.”</p>
<p>“What?” Erich was taken aback by Heinz’s response.</p>
<p>Heinz’s Knights teammates often underestimated him because he looked like a boy and had a naturally strong body. Some of the knights who joined the team simultaneously speculated that Heinz had cheated to pass the knight test. Heinz had to demonstrate his abilities and prove them wrong.</p>
<p>Heinz expected such a backlash when he learned Melchor had married Roseline. Her father had committed a felony and died, and her family was highly conservative.</p>
<p>Roseline was different from the type to be friendly or well-liked, making her easily hated and deceived.</p>
<p>“New Year’s Day,” Heinz said casually as he patted Erich on the shoulder.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Pour, pour, pour!”</p>
<p>“Come on!”</p>
<p>The servants were busy carrying wheat bags and sprinkling flour on the flames. The black smoke soaring high in the sky gradually dissipated as the white powder covered the fire, and the fire in the kitchen, burning loudly, went out. The kitchen had a charred interior and a stinky pile of burnt flour.</p>
<p>“Make sure there are no embers left, and take the burned furniture out and dismantle it,” Roseline instructed the servants.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” they answered.</p>
<p>Hugo’s response was softer than usual, and Roseline noticed that when she looked at him, he quickly lowered his gaze. It must have been difficult for the 18-year-old girl to devise a cool countermeasure without being embarrassed by the unexpected fire. It was also a situation in which the servants were watching to put her to the test.</p>
<p>Despite the pressure, Roseline accepted the test and correctly responded to the situation. The most effective way to put out the fire was to use flour, which could cover and block the oxygen that fueled the flames. Other materials, such as salt or sand, could have been used to accomplish this.</p>
<p>Roseline chose flour because it was easily accessible in the kitchen, close to the main building’s food warehouse. Knowing about fire suppression would have needed more time to develop a quick solution. Roseline demonstrated her ability to think realistically and solve problems in the best way possible. She was a good judge of character.</p>
<p>The servants were surprised to see the hostess they had ignored handle the crisis in an unexpectedly skillful but calm manner.</p>
<p>Roseline sighed as she observed their carefree demeanor. Despite her inability to prove it, she suspected that the accidental fire was a test set up by the servants to humiliate their hostess.</p>
<p>This theory was supported by the circumstances.</p>
<p>There was, however, no evidence to back up her suspicions. If she accused the servants of setting the fire on purpose, they would deny it and claim that she was overreacting.</p>
<p>Even if they were successful in their test, they would still lose money, and if they failed, they would embarrass Roseline while avoiding responsibility for the results.</p>
<p>Roseline was uneasy at the thought. If she had given the incorrect answer, the oil that had come into contact with the water could have splashed and caused a significant accident. The old building, which was due to be demolished anyway, was isolated from other structures, preventing a fire from spreading. However, there was no way to guarantee that no one would be killed in the fire.</p>
<p>In the winter, many buildings are demolished, and Roseline has no idea how the fire will spread. If something went wrong, such as starting a fire or injuring someone, the Postenmeyer family’s employees might have used it as an excuse to crush her spirit.</p>
<p>They might refuse by making excuses or scratching their heads if she gave an order again. Saying things like, ‘You don’t know much because you’re not good at housework,’ or ‘You only value your pride and neglect your responsibilities and duties.’</p>
<p>Despite their efficiency and competence, Roseline perceived a critical flaw in the Postenmeyer family’s employees: they were not considerate. She brushed her disheveled hair back and inquired of the butler.”</p>
