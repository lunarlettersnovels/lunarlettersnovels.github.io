<div class="sc-gKclnd cDdKdQ"><span class="sc-1di2uql-1 kxSoJv" data-tag="post-title">It </span>was a quiet morning. Melchor woke up before sunrise and left the mansion at dawn.  Roseline had her breakfast alone.</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="sc-1sp3zau-0 jaefFT sc-1di2uql-0 tiegV" data-tag="post-content">
<p>“My Lady, it’s time to change the sheets. Would you mind moving over for a moment?”</p>
<p>“All right. Do you always change the sheets at this hour?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Doing the work at the appointed time is the principle of the Postenmeyer family.”</p>
<p>Catalina, Roseline’s maid, was blunt and straightforward. But Roseline preferred her like this instead of the tight-lipped version of her from before. At least she answered her questions now.</p>
<p>“If one makes a habit of doing things at a fixed time, one is less likely to forget or make a mistake. It’s an efficient policy.”</p>
<p>“Since you clean all of them at the same time, wouldn’t it be inconvenient if there are guests?”</p>
<p>“It rarely takes very long. The visitors don’t mind.”</p>
<p>Roseline thought the way things worked in the mansion was a little strange. Of course, it looked fast and efficient to get the work done instantly, but it might be inconvenient for some.</p>
<p>However, to change the existing system, Roseline must have experience in managing servants herself. She had managed the Crimson Rose Household for a while but she felt that her past experience might not apply here because it seemed the Postenmeyer staff worked in a completely different way.</p>
<p>Melchor had said she could do whatever she wanted, but…</p>
<p>One could always gain experience as one learns the work. She must not change the way of the servants, otherwise, she might be misunderstood for being condescending and abusing her power. Roseline decided to tread carefully.</p>
<p>“Let’s work hard!” said Roseline and left the drawing room on the third floor. She headed down to the second floor. Melchor had said that she could use his office if she wanted, so she decided to use it from today.</p>
<p>Roseline walked down the stairs and stopped at the window. People were lined up in front of the annex outside. <em>What’s happening? </em>she wondered.</p>
<p>“Nicholas,” she called.</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lady?”</p>
<p>Nicholas was the watchman. He remained in the mansion and was Roseline’s escort as well. Roseline didn’t know why Melchor felt like she needed an escort if all she did was stay in the mansion, anyway.</p>
<p>“Why are people gathered in that annex over there?”</p>
<p>“I heard ‌they are hiring new staff. They are probably the applicants for the position.”</p>
<p>The Postenmeyer family stayed in the eastern part of the estate. Compared to other noble families, it had few workers. The Grand Duke’s butler, groundskeeper, and a few maids were the only servants in the whole mansion.</p>
<p>When Roseline first came here, she had assumed that there would be an infinite number of servants and maids considering the Postenmeyer family’s infamy. She had discovered, to her surprise, that it wasn’t so.</p>
<p>The situation changed as Roseline became the Duchess of the Postenmeyer family. Roseline’s mother and brother would be released from confinement soon. They had no choice but to stay with her until the Crimson Rose mansion was rebuilt. The household would need more staff. It must be why the Postenmeyer household was recruiting more people.</p>
<p>Roseline had not been aware of this until she gazed from the window and saw roughly about fifty people queued outside.</p>
<p><em>Even if the recruitment is overseen by the butler, shouldn’t the hostess of the family be informed at the least? </em>Roseline thought.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Melchor had been called by the emperor again to listen to his useless complaints. It might not seem as insignificant from the emperor’s perspective, but to Melchor, it just seemed gibberish.</p>
<p>“I went to Wilhelmine last night, but she didn’t even meet me…,” said the emperor.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“As expected, I am hated for approving your marriage.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“Melchor, don’t you even care? Don’t you think it is partly your responsibility to help us improve our relationship?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
