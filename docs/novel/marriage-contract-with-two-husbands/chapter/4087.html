            <p>When was the last time she smiled or laughed? Roseline has lost her memory; it seems like years have passed.</p>
<p>‘You’ve been like that since you were a child, but you’re a truly unique child.’</p>
<p>Roseline has heard that the Crimson Rose family clan is uncommon. Her mother did not have high hopes for having a child because her husband was born after several miscarriages.</p>
<p>The doctor said her mother was pregnant, but she had no morning sickness.</p>
<p>‘I don’t see any indications of cravings.’ I was afraid I was going to miscarry.’</p>
<p>Roseline’s mother seemed to take it for granted when she talked about Roseline nearly being killed in her stomach.</p>
<p>‘In comparison to your brother, I gave birth to you with little difficulty. That’s probably why.’</p>
<p>Her mother avoided Roseline, citing an illogical reason that she couldn’t attach herself to her daughter not because she suffered, but because she didn’t.</p>
<p>Perhaps things could have turned out differently. Roseline may have been able to openly express her emotions, even when she was hurt, and smile even when she was sad and tired.</p>
<p>If she had someone who understood, comforted and loved her, she might not have expressed herself as well as she should have and had an insensitive personality for her age.</p>
<p>Roseline’s closest family, however, did not understand her heart. They were uninterested in what she was carrying or how she intended to carry out her duties and responsibilities.<br>
The suppressed emotions that surrounded Roseline’s heart were like a solid wall. It was also perhaps natural for her to become self-sufficient early on, without expecting or relying on anything.</p>
<p>Roseline’s surroundings no longer expected her to display human emotions. Roseline noticed an invisible barrier between herself and the others.</p>
<p>But it was fine with her.</p>
<p>Roseline had no idea things would change until his brother was born.</p>
<p>‘It’s a baby boy!’</p>
<p>Roseline’s life was up in the air after the birth of her younger brother Alfons. A child was born who would become the family’s heir. She was awkward and perplexed. Her feet seemed to be trembling.<br>
‘I’m going to train Alfons as a replacement.’ You should just go to the academy.’</p>
<p>Roseline was sent to the academy without a word from her parents. Her mother had abandoned her in the dorms.</p>
<p>‘That’s fantastic, Roseline. It’s another perfect score.’</p>
<p>‘Thank you very much, Professor Mitries.’</p>
<p>‘Why don’t you smile when people compliment you?’</p>
<p>‘…….’</p>
<p>Roseline was a dedicated student. She was always serious about her lessons, and she never skipped studying or reviewing. She didn’t despise studying. Because her studies have yielded the same results as she has tried.</p>
<p>Roseline reasoned that this was why she clung on more desperately and with swordsmanship.</p>
<p>Roseline could distract herself from her worries by moving her body. She swung her sword until she was out of breath.</p>
<p>Tsug!</p>
<p>The barrier was struck by a sword that flew faster than an arrow.</p>
<p>The sharp blade cut through the trees, the petals, and the wind. It slashed through intangible despair and frustration.</p>
<p>A sword is a tool used to kill enemies and protect oneself.</p>
<p>If so, can she turn off her mind in order to keep herself together?</p>
<p>Roseline collapsed on the floor, panting heavily. The sky could be seen.</p>
<p>‘There is blue in the sky.’</p>
<p>A pleasant breeze is blowing. There was a faint sound of green grass.</p>
<p>‘Regardless of how much I suffer, the sun will rise, the wind will blow, and the trees will grow.’</p>
<p>Roseline’s life was everything to her. However, not for her parents.</p>
<p>Roseline made the decision to admit it. She claimed that no matter how hard she tried, nothing could be changed.<br>
Even after losing her entire life, Roseline was not strong or mature enough to be shaken. She was only 12 years old, no matter how old she got.</p>
<p>Responsibility, duty, effort, and frustration were rendered meaningless in the face of the world’s massive barriers. Roseline shut her eyes.</p>
<p>Roseline then cried for the first time.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“She can’t do this to me if my mother considers me a family member, if she considers me her child-like Alfons.”</p>
<p>“Why are you always pointing at Alfons?” “Do you resemble Alfons?”</p>
<p>“I, too, am a mother’s child.”</p>
<p>“Alphons is not as conceited as you!”</p>
<p>She’s conceited. She’s overjoyed. Words she frequently hears from her mother. Roseline’s parents always make such remarks when she says something. Roseline’s self-assurance was so strong that it caused her to be more obedient and obey her parents.</p>
<p>Roseline, on the other hand, was branded as a stain on the family after obeying her parents’ words. Roseline failed to succeed, dropped out of the academy, and was even broken up with by his fiance.</p>
<p>“Roseline, please mature. You’ll be sorry if you live like that!”</p>
<p>“Regret? I’ve already started.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Then…”</p>
<p>“I should’ve told you sooner.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
