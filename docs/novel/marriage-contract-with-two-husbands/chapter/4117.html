        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The men who were frozen in place looked at each other, and then quickly bowed their heads. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What ? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline coughed and barely raised her upper body, her attention on the tall man clad in jet-black armor. He was a man with dark hair that looked black even under the warm sunlight, pale skin that looked like it was made of wax, and extraordinarily beautiful blue eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roseline?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His eyes, which were like sharply forged ice spears, flickered for an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roseline…isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you know me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Roseline met such an impressive man before, there was no way she would not remember it. His eyes blinked again at Roseline’s question. Those blue orbs which seemed to enclose the winter scenery stared at her delicately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty, is something the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A young man with blonde hair, who seemed to be an aide, approached and asked a question, but the man in black dismissed it. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Majesty?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It only meant one person. The Grand Duke of Postenmeyer, who placed all the eastern territories of the Empire under his jurisdiction, said that he was side by side with the emperor. Perhaps his name was Melchor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was unknown why the Grand Duke, who ruled the eastern territory, came to the West.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Highness, what are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps he understood the situation too late. The commander in blue cloak rushed to his feet and knelt in front of the archduke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doing here?” the Grand Duke asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her Majesty has ordered me to take the Crimson Rose family,” the captain replied, attempting to hide the tremble in his voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You took the family and caused a lot of damage in the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sir, it happened because we needed to find those who were hiding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does it look like a person can hide behind a picture frame or a flowerpot with that mess?” the duke retorted, his voice chilling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knight commander’s expression darkened in fear at the duke’s reply. Roseline found it a little bit strange: killing the butler as an example or scouring the mansion to catch the servants. However, the knights in the blue cloak did not stop there. They pulled out all the furniture and household items in the mansion one by one and destroyed them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed like they were trying to find something else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then work hard to find the missing ones. I will take this one.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Grand Duke glanced at Roseline and shook his head, the knight commander jumped up from his seat and dissuaded him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would be in trouble, Grand Duke! “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re going to take her to the capital anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is the order of the Empress to bring the sinner myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The Emperor said I could take her with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the words of the Grand Duke, the knight commander’s face turned earthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights cannot move without the emperor’s consent, so the empress’ command to arrest the Crimson Rose family was also like an emperor’s order. Therefore, even in front of the Grand Duke, the commander could claim to secure Roseline’s recruitment, but the story would be different if the emperor had ordered the Grand Duke. If the orders of the emperor and the empress diverged, the order of the empress became invalid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I can’t allow His Excellency’s hand to touch such a thing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve come all the way here, and if I go back without doing anything, I won’t be able to see the Emperor either. Countess Crimson Rose and his son Alfons had already been transferred to the capital, so why don’t I take this woman with me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Or are you about to have my Black Knights search the house?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not even worth it!” The commander quickly claimed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the duke dismissed the commander of the blue cloak, he turned his head and looked down at Roseline, who was still tied. His eyes narrowed. He seemed hesitant about something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that was all. The Grand Duke immediately turned away, erasing his affection for her in his eyes, and gave instructions to the blond young man who seemed to be his assistant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heinz, please take care of Lady Crimson Rose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heinz quickly pulled a dagger out of his arms and approached Roseline to sever the rope which bound her. Roseline was surprised at how he was able to cut it easily. He took off his cloak and put it over Roseline’s body, examining her condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think your bones are damaged. But you’d better be careful. I’ll help you, Lady Crimson Rose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can get up on my own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t let me regret untying the rope. I’ll tie you up again if you don’t listen to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a considerable difference between his smiling face and his words. His appearance was as fresh as the early summer sun, and he had a good sense of strength and balance–much needed as he was an aide to the Grand Duke of Postenmeyer. He held Roseline unshakable and carried her to the carriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Knights’ transport wagon was not only gigantic but also comfortable. The Blue Knights carriage, which had ridden Roseline’s mother and Alfons, was far from this form, though she had only seen it at a glance.</span></p>
