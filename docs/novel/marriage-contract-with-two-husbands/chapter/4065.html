            <p>Humans are weaker in their natural state than other animals. On the other hand, humans learned how to make fire and tools, which gave them an advantage over animals.</p>
<p>At first glance, it is easy to believe that humans have become “strong” through the use of fire or tools, but this is not the case. He figured out how to wield power and make it his own.</p>
<p>“To win a fight, Julian, you don’t have to be strong.”</p>
<p>“Is that correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Roseline gave a nod. Julian nodded obediently after her, though he didn’t think he understood much of what she was saying.</p>
<p>“If they bother you again, Julian, try this.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>Roseline lowered her head and whispered something into Julian’s ear. Julian’s shoulders shook in surprise as he heard the woman whisper for the first time in his life, but he could clearly hear what she said.</p>
<p>“How can you…” Oh, no. I’ll follow Roseline’s instructions.”</p>
<p>That’s what his patron said. Julian had complete faith in Roseline’s advice.</p>
<p>Roseline stroked Julian’s head inadvertently because the face, which appeared stubborn and innocent on the other hand, was cute.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Julian has already hardened. The nerves all over his body seemed to be focused on her head. Roseline removed her hand and apologized after confirming the rigid response.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for touching your hair. You’re annoyed, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t.”</p>
<p>He was simply taken aback because this is the first time anyone has ever touched his hair. Julian shifted his gaze.</p>
<p>He had the impression that flowers were rising from the top of her head the moment Roseline touched it.</p>
<p>Roseline. The rose’s name.</p>
<p>The fine, pinkish nails on the white finger’s tip stood out especially.</p>
<p>Julian shook his head, sure that roses were growing from the tip of her finger.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Roseline.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What?”</p>
<p>“Many thanks for your assistance.”</p>
<p>“Forget it. I did it because I enjoyed doing it.’</p>
<p>Roseline responded calmly. But she had no idea how much that casual response meant to Julian.</p>
<p>Julian looked at Roseline’s face with blue eyes, then turned away because he thought it would be impolite to stare at her for too long.</p>
<p>The sound of two people stepping on fallen leaves was busy.</p>
<p>“However, the forest is very deep.”</p>
<p>She had heard that most of the forest had been cut down to make a square and a park, but even if she walked strangely, the road was not over. Roseline’s heart felt strange but next to her was Julian, a child. Julian, as an adult, will become more anxious if she displays anxiety.</p>
<p>Roseline pretended to be calm as she walked in the direction of the tree branches. Obviously, she will find an exit if she walks to one side.</p>
<p>Her prediction, however, was incorrect.</p>
<p>“Oh……?”</p>
<p>A stream ran in front of the two.</p>
<p>Did this forest have a stream?</p>
<p>Roseline returned Julian’s gaze. Julian appeared tired as if he had been walking with his injured leg.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Julian. “How about you take a break here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>
<p>He appears to be uneasy with his legs, as evidenced by his response, “Let’s do it,” even though he would say it’s fine.</p>
<p>Roseline sat Julian a little further away from the stream and examined the water. The water was so clear that it couldn’t be imagined as a stream flowing through the park’s forest.</p>
<p>With her hands, Roseline scooped the stream. The water is icy.</p>
<p>“Do you want some water, Julian?”</p>
<p>Roseline drank a sip of the stream water and moistened her throat. He was tired of wandering around the forest, but after drinking the water from the stream, he felt relieved.</p>
<p>“This forest is enormous. ” “It appears to be much larger than I saw on the map.”</p>
<p>“This is virgin territory.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>She heard it was developed as a park 5 years ago, but it is still undeveloped. She was talking about preserving a portion of the forest rather than turning it into a park.</p>
<p>If the forest was this large, such an expression could have been made by the child.</p>
<p>Julian’s words were taken in stride by Roseline.</p>
<p>“Sorry. It’s also my first time here, so I wasn’t expecting it to be this large. Do your legs hurt?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Julian’s face and voice were both calm. No, it was subdued rather than calm.</p>
<p>Is the swollen ankle painful?</p>
<p>Roseline tilted her head and looked at Julian, but he didn’t look back. The boy’s gaze was fixed on Roseline.</p>
