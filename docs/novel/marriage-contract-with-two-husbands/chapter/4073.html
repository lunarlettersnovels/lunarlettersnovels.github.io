            <p>Roseline sighed quietly enough not to be heard by her brother when she heard his story.</p>
<p>She doesn’t want to show her anger to her younger brother. To Alfons, a child, he would also be seen as threatening to be angry.</p>
<p>It was the servants who insulted Roseline and her family anyway, so there was no reason to be angry at Alfons.</p>
<p><em>I can’t make a fuss here. Rather, it will only do more damage to my reputation.</em></p>
<p>Neither she nor her family did anything for Roseline. Even so, the Crimson Rose family was her family, and she could not deny her roots.</p>
<p><em>The daughter of a criminal… That would be public opinion.</em></p>
<p>Melchor seems to have forgotten because he was in favor of her. Her father died a sinner, without a funeral or even a grave.</p>
<p>Roseline suppressed her anger, which was rising like smoke from inside, and put on a soft expression as much as possible.</p>
<p>“Alfons, did you tell our mother this story?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. She’s too far away….”</p>
<p>It seems that he has not even visited the western annex yet. His tearful eyes were filled with feelings of wanting to see his mother.</p>
<p>Even though Roseline was a harsh mother, she was kind to young Alfons, so the child naturally wants to see her.</p>
<p>“Alfons, do you want me to take you to your mother?”</p>
<p>Alfons shook his head. He looked like he was about to cry, but he didn’t.</p>
<p>“If I don’t stand tall, people will curse my family again.”</p>
<p>“… … .”</p>
<p>Even a child has pride and anger. Alfons has kept it to himself since last night. Even though the aristocrat himself was despised by his servants, he must have been resentful of his cowardly and powerless situation, and he could not stand up in front of them and stand up proudly.</p>
<p>Roseline didn’t say anything. She just hugged Alfons quietly.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, Alfons. You held it in well.”</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>His slender shoulders shook, and his small hand clenched Roselaine’s sleeve.</p>
<p>Roseline took Alfons into her room, wiped his brother’s face so that it was not obvious that he had cried, and laid him on the bed.</p>
<p>“If you couldn’t sleep all night, you would be very tired. You’d better try to sleep now.”</p>
<p>“Sister…”</p>
<p>Alfons grabbed Roseline’s sleeve again.</p>
<p>His brother wants her to stay with him until he falls asleep. It was still early, so she still had some time. It was difficult for her to work right away because of her aching feeling.</p>
<p>“Alfons, tell me if you need anything.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you make up with mom?”</p>
<p>Roseline’s hand, which was patting her brother’s stomach wrapped in a blanket, stopped.</p>
<p>“I don’t like it when my mom and sister fight. ”</p>
<p>Alfons’ expression was once again depressed. Roseline tried to smile, but she couldn’t help but feel down.</p>
<p><em>I’m sure he is anxious because he is away from his mother.  Because he wasn’t that close to me.’</em></p>
<p>The mother who protected him will be more dependable. But now that his sister has the authority to kick his mother out, young Alfons has no choice but to hang on to her and ask her to forgive her mother.</p>
<p>Alfons wishes she had told his mother when she slapped her sister.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about my younger brother?”</p>
<p>Since coming here, it seems that she has become self-centered. She promised herself that she should give up her greed and expectations, but how can a person’s heart be so stingy?</p>
<p>“If my mother feels the same way as I do, will you make up?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Alfons’ face relaxed as if he had fully comprehended his sister’s words. As soon as his eyes closed, a sound of breathing was heard.</p>
<p><em>It’s hard. Why are human emotions sometimes one-way?</em></p>
<p>Roseline stayed with her younger brother for a long time, even after Alfons fell asleep.</p>
