            <p>“Let’s go inside,” said Roseline.</p>
<p>“Yes?” Melchor responded.</p>
<p>“You have to go to work tomorrow morning, don’t you?” Roseline asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Melchor replied.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s go in,” Roseline said, grabbing Melchor’s hand.</p>
<p>The moment Roseline grabbed his hand, Melchor was startled by the warmth. Melchor didn’t seem to notice that Roseline was upset, either because she didn’t look like she was feeling anything or because it was dark and her face couldn’t be seen due to the backlight. Rather than clasping, the fingers were slightly spread, but that alone made Melchor feel as if he was being dragged by chains. A different tension flowed through his body than when he was stabbed by his sword when he was in Dalian.</p>
<p>“Roseline, you’re moving too quickly,” said Melchor.</p>
<p>“Yes?” Roseline responded.</p>
<p>“I find myself pulled to you,” Melchor said, his voice carrying the most unsettling feelings Roseline had ever heard.</p>
<p>Roseline was not a quick thinker, and Melchor was considerably taller than her with larger legs, which made his stride wider. Even if she yanked him away, he wouldn’t slip or fall.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, I’m sorry,” Roseline said, concerned that she was being too harsh on someone who would become her husband. But there was no other option.</p>
<p>Roseline apologized and released her grip on Melchor’s hand. However, at that precise moment, Melchor clasped her hand again.</p>
<p>“Melchor?” Roseline said.</p>
<p>“What?” Melchor responded.</p>
<p>Melchor’s voice was tinged with shame. He couldn’t figure out why he was holding Roseline’s hand. The warmth faded as he let go of her hand, but he unwittingly gripped it again.</p>
<p>“Do you dislike holding hands?” Melchor asked, blushing and looking around awkwardly as he evaded the question. He gradually let go of Roseline’s hand.</p>
<p>As the warmth from their contact dissipated, Roseline said, “I’m not saying I don’t like it. It’s just that I was astonished.” She stroked Melchor’s hand with her other hand, and although it was not a firm grip when Melchor’s huge palm curled around her own, her body temperature rose unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“Me too,” Melchor responded. Roseline gave an unexpected response, looking him in the eyes before lowering her gaze and looking at her hand.</p>
<p>“Melchor,” said Roseline.</p>
<p>“Yes?” Melchor responded.</p>
<p>“May I take your hand again?” Roseline asked.</p>
<p>Melchor extended his hand slightly before retracting it. Roseline was left speechless.</p>
