        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chandelier in the hall fell into pieces. Sharp pieces of glass were embedded in the carpet, and the shiny crystals were dizzying as they lost their meaning as decorations. The white candles rolled on the ground, trampled on by urgent mud-covered steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait a minute, what a rude thing to do! At least after she’s ready…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The butler tried to stop the knights, but his efforts failed. Without so much a scream, the frail butler collapsed into the ground, dead</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Search everywhere. Catch those who hide!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knights flooded inside to find Countess Crimson Rose, the Countess’ daughter and son. The cries of frightened servants followed, and the sounds of breaking objects echoed throughout. It was then that Roseline appeared from the stairwell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you doing?” she demanded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rose-colored red hair, which symbolizes “Crimson Rose,” and the vivid green eyes that stood out from a distance… Knowing at a glance that she was the Count’s daughter, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took a step forward and raised his left arm in front of his chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Count of Crimson Rose has gambled against the country’s law. This undermines the dignity of the aristocracy and the prestige of the empire. You know it’s a felony equivalent to treason,” he announced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know,” Roseline said as she reached around her waist and pulled out her sword. She pulled three silver blades out of a sheath decorated with gold. “I can’t be dragged away by those who break in so recklessly.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lady Crimson Rose, please confess your guilt. If you resist in this way, the crime becomes even heavier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the crime of disgrace for making false claims, the punishment is heavier than initially deserved. It is advantageous to resist the ruling when innocent, but if you commit a crime, the sentence will be lighter if you do not resist. The worst case was when Roseline pleaded not guilty and resisted, only to be found guilty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she was innocent, she learned that if it was difficult to prove her innocence, it would be better to surrender and receive a reduction in sentence. Although realistic, it was unreasonable to be published in law books that she had learned from her middle school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was already a felony equivalent to treason, not a crime that could be lightened. If she admitted to the charges, she would only feel little comfort being taken, and the results would remain the same. They would all die in prison or on the streets.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nobleman of the rank… </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was disastrous for the aristocrats to lose their wealth and title by committing crimes. Since they do not know how to farm, it is difficult to escape to the countryside and hide their identity, and the only way left would be to fall into the dark side. As a criminal, they cannot go to an office or become a knight. Even if they enter entrepreneurship, they don’t have the capability to sign a transaction contract, and even ordinary stores won’t seal a deal with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t mean to admit it anyway,” announced Roseline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Knightsman seemed to have no faith in her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand that the Crimson Rose family are very close. Don’t lie that you didn’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her father thought of his daughter as a tool. Still, he was a person who was concerned about others’ opinions, so he always talked to others, claiming that his family was always harmonious and friendly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline didn’t deny it because it wouldn’t be beneficial for them for the family’s secret to be out in the open for the society to gossip about, but she didn’t expect such fabrication to entrap her in a situation like this</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you don’t believe me, I’ll insist on my innocence. I have no choice but to resist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are rigorously trained knights. You’ll only be ashamed if you resist the swordsmanship you’ve learned a little in the academy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knight’s tone was polite, but there was an undeniable sarcasm underneath his words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added, “But isn’t it the childish Count who grew up without knowing the world? To confront the Knights of the Empress with a single blade is to say that you don’t understand the situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you think so, I’d rather be glad,” retorted Roseline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more you look down on your opponent’s skills, the more you become careless to create an opening for the enemy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline turned her wrist, and her three swords bent and stretched out toward the sky. She seemed like an actor on stage performing tricks, and some of the knights standing behind the chief of the knights burst into laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Quiet!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The captain blamed the knights behind him, but the only thing that stopped was a laugh; the look in his contempt remained unchanged. In their eyes, Roseline would have seemed a foolish child who could not understand the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last warning, Lady Crimson Rose. If you don’t surrender, I’ll have to put you down with all my might.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Try.” Roseline stood upright and pointed her sword. The afternoon sun from the cracked window glittered against her sharp blades. “If you’re going to tie me up, you’ll have a hard time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline’s sword was like a living creature in itself. It bent like an elastic vine as it took the blade of the knight and drilled itself sharply and accurately into his gauntlet, breaking the tendons of the knight’s wrist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ouch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no need to aim for life, for Roseline was not slow enough to be caught by a half-horse knight who could not hold his sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knight’s face showed that he didn’t understand what was happening now. Ironically, it was the empress’s knights who could no longer comprehend the situation. </span></p>
