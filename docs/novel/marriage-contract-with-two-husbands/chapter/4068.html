            <p>Roseline is in a pickle.</p>
<p>She hadn’t expected the empress who had ordered her capture to send a wedding present.</p>
<p>An aristocratic young lady, however, will not refuse the emperor and empress’ gifts, no matter how uncomfortable they are with each other. She had to accept it because she couldn’t send it back, but the problem is that all of these jewels and outfits were presented to Roseline by the imperial palace.</p>
<p>When the emperor or empress gave something to the people, they were expected to flaunt it and brag about how wonderful they were.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to do anything that would draw attention to herself.</p>
<p>One must use these many gems and gowns for her wedding because they are wedding gifts. The only way to have a magnificent wedding and invite a large number of guests is to hold the ceremony in front of them.</p>
<p><em>I was planning a modest wedding, but everything went wrong.</em></p>
<p>What should we do with this?</p>
<p>“Hugo.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“I need to reschedule the wedding. To a greater extent.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Hugo, the butler, is in a pickle. This is because the bride and groom of the Porstenmeyer family insisted on a quiet wedding and turned down all offers from wedding venues all over the country.</p>
<p>The cathedral and ceremony space are most certainly already booked.</p>
<p>Obviously, naming the Grand Duke of Porstenmeyer cancels all weddings and frees up a spot, but the problem is that Roseline is very against hurting other people.</p>
<p>All of the jewels and gold given by the imperial family must be used for the ceremony, and all of the ceremonies have been scheduled. You cannot pay a fee to attend someone else’s wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>How can they spend the empress’s entire money to save face and have a big wedding that doesn’t hurt anyone?</p>
<p>The option was not the solution. It has always been difficult to come up with new responses. Roseline, who had observed the butler in pain, heard the estimated budget and paused before opening her mouth.</p>
<p>“Can I see a map of the capital, Hugo?”</p>
<p>“What? A map?”</p>
<p>“I’m not familiar with the capital’s geography. If feasible, I’d want a large map with all the features marked up and a panoramic view.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll get it ready right away.”</p>
<p>Roseline asked as she looked at Jiro, who had been brought to her by the butler from the capital. She pointed to Central Grand Park.</p>
<p>“There’s a park right in the middle of the road.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was originally part of the mountain that surrounds the capital. We wiped out the surrounding area and built structures as we extended the capital and ordered the compartments, thus, we became a forest that fell alone. It was transformed into a park five years ago.”</p>
<p>At first, he tried to make everyone in the forest build a building, but the emperor said that the streets should only have buildings and not be pretty. So, the forest became a park.</p>
<p>A huge road was built, and in the central plaza, an outdoor hall was built. The trees were moved and replanted.</p>
<p>“It’s an open-air hall. ”</p>
<p>“There are also orchestra performances for citizens on holidays.”</p>
<p>“Then it has to be big and have a lot of seats.”</p>
<p>“What? That’s the ideal place.”</p>
<p>Roseline indicated the position of the park’s outdoor hall after hearing Hugo’s response. It looks small because it is shown on a map of the whole capital, but it is much bigger than the other buildings around it.</p>
<p>“All well, I’ll buy this park.”</p>
<p>“……what?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to hold a ceremony in this outdoor hall.”</p>
<p>All of the available ceremonies and churches for the ceremony are fully booked. If this is the case, the only option is to create a new ceremony.</p>
<p>Fortunately, all of these gigantic diamonds are already owned by Roseline, not the Postenmeyer family, so she can freely use them without considering others.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to meet and speak with the park’s manager. Hugo, please prepare to leave.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Roseline went to the park’s management and made sure that the outdoor hall wasn’t booked for the wedding day. She then decided to rent the park from today until the wedding day.</p>
<p><em>Previously, saving money was my job, but now that I’ve gotten over the hump, it’s my responsibility to spend it.</em></p>
<p>Roseline gazed out at the wide woodlands that surrounded the outdoor hall. The square, which is centrally located, will comfortably accommodate 1,000 people. The cost of decorating a ceremony of this size will be significant. There was no problem with using the royal family’s jewelry.</p>
<p>The challenge is to have a big wedding to save the face of the royal family while also giving Melchor the small wedding he wants.</p>
<p><em>It’s a grand and simple union.</em></p>
<p>What a symbiotic relationship. How are we going to meet these two? Roseline shook her head and stepped down from the stage to hear the manager explain.</p>
