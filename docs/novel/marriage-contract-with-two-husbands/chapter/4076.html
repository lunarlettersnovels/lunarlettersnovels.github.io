            <p>Of course, it is a separate matter whether Melchor needs a child born to Roseline, but everyone who meets her in the future will expect Grand Duke Porstenmeyer to have children and create direct descendants.</p>
<p><em>Is it a couple’s duty?</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, Melchor avoided touching her body. Perhaps it was because he recognized that Roseline and Roselyn were different when they faced each other closely.</p>
<p><em>If we got married because we only look alike, but you don’t want to touch me because we’re not the same person, what should I do?</em></p>
<p><em>And what will Melchor do to himself?</em></p>
<p>Roseline, who did not know that Melchor was not immune to women at all, freely gave the reason and came to her own conclusion.</p>
<p>After all, it’s a marriage that was led by that person. It’s not even a question that can be answered just by thinking about it.</p>
<p>If it is a problem that cannot be solved by one’s power, it is better to give up. It was better to forget. It was Roseline’s specialty to rule herself by acknowledging and giving up her limitations.</p>
<p>But that night, Roseline quickly forgot and couldn’t fall asleep.</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>The next day, when Roseline woke up, Melchor had already gone to work and was not at home. She drank a glass of tomato juice for breakfast and set out for her walk.</p>
<p>“Madam, skipping meals is not good for your health,” Nicholas, her escort, reminded her as they left the house. Melchor will go to work before Roseline wakes up, and Nicholas, as Melchor’s subordinate by position, will also get up at the same time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Nicholas’ face showed no signs of fatigue. Roseline believed that knights have different basic physical strengths, despite the fact that she believed in his sword skills.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>“It’s because I don’t feel well,” Roseline said. “Then shall I call a doctor?” Nicholas asked. “No, I think I’ll calm down if I breathe cold air while taking a walk,” Roseline replied.</p>
<p>If the four seasons were condensed into one day, it is said that spring is like a morning, summer is like midday, autumn is like twilight, and winter is like a night with a fresh moon. The cool early morning wind disheveled Roseline’s red hair as she stepped out of the house. The sun was slowly rising in the eastern sky, and Roseline narrowed her eyes as she saw the pale end of the sky turn white. “There are various colors in the morning sky,” she thought. She knew that the evening sky was a mixture of blue and red, but she didn’t know that the morning sky could be colored in various ways depending on the direction of the sun rising. It looks like it will be sunny today, Roseline thought as she walked slowly, looking around at the trees in the garden as she prepared for the morning sun. The small sound of her steps on the grass and the loud birdsong harmonized.</p>
<p>Nicholas was following Roseline, about two steps behind her.</p>
<p>“Nicolas, you said Melchor rarely stays in this mansion, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Your Highness is almost always in the East except for the annual event to observe His Majesty,” Nicholas replied.</p>
<p>“It’s unusual for him to stay for two months this time,” Nicholas added.</p>
<p>“I’ve also heard that the garden is not being managed. Of course, to be exact, it’s more of a non-decorating garden than a non-managing one. The lawn is cut to a certain height, and the trees are thick enough to look good. If no one was managing it, the grass would have grown as tall as a person’s height, and the trees would have become thick like a jungle forest.”</p>
<p>“The tree is very tall. How many years has it grown?” Roseline asked Nicholas.</p>
<p>“This mansion was originally owned by the imperial family. Six years ago, the present Emperor gave it to the Grand Duke,” Nicholas replied.</p>
<p>“What? Really?” Roseline exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes. It was originally built more than 200 years ago under the command of the Emperor at the time,” Nicholas continued.</p>
<p>It was strange that there was a mansion this big in the capital, even though it was not even a castle. This is the capital of the empire, no matter how noble the Postenmeyer family is in the empire. As long as the size of the mansion represented the dignity of the family, it could not have been possible to build a mansion this size if it were not because of the emperor.</p>
<p>It was built by the imperial court,” Nicholas confirmed. “The capital city has an imperial castle, so it may not have been built according to the concept of a villa.”</p>
<p>Oh, so it was connected to the forest? Roseline recalled being on her way back alone after a confrontation with Melchor when she got lost in the forest and fell into it. She met a boy named Julian in the forest. Maybe there was an academy beyond the forest.</p>
<p>“Forest…,” Roseline tiptoed and looked at the patronage. “It doesn’t look like it’s connected to the forest from this side, but there must be more space behind it.”</p>
<p>Thinking of Julian, Roseline briefly prayed for the boy’s safety, “I hope you’re not being bullied again.” Imagining the academy beyond the invisible forest, she wondered what the boy was doing now.</p>
