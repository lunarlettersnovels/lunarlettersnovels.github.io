            <p>“You can go wherever you want.”</p>
<p>“Me, me, everything, everything, forget, forget!” “I’m gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.”</p>
<p>The man shuddered. Roseline gasped and grabbed Julian’s hand. The man’s arms and legs were twisted in strange ways, and his head was bowed. She had no choice but to protect the child.</p>
<p>Roseline, on the other hand, lacked a sword, and it was impossible to use a sword against a ghost.</p>
<p>Roseline’s hardened hand was wrapped around Julian’s hand.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, Roseline.” “It is not dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Who is that person, Julian?”</p>
<p>“It’s something we don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaaa.”</p>
<p>The man’s body flipped backward.</p>
<p>“I forgot where I was going and what I was supposed to do.” “I’ve been exploring around here.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the voice calmed down, and the stuttering vanished.</p>
<p>“Please take me if you have pity on me.”</p>
<p>Julian shook his head silently and spoke clearly to the man.</p>
<p>“As you can see, I’m a kid.” It’s a challenge to keep my body healthy. “I don’t believe I can be held accountable for anyone.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you feel sorry for me?”</p>
<p>“If you take one person in without thinking about his abilities just because you are in a pitiful situation, you will be bound to him forever.” You can never go back to the way things used to be. “I don’t want to be irresponsible with my life.”</p>
<p>The man sobbed in response to Julian’s words, “huhu…” With a groan, he sat down and melted into the floor.</p>
<p>The clear stream that ran between them and the man vanished.</p>
<p>“Oh, my goodness…”</p>
<p>Even after seeing it with her own eyes, Roseline couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“Did you consecrate the ghost, Julian?”</p>
<p>No, I simply took the power and dispersed it. “It will be holy if someone has the power to make it so.”</p>
<p>It’s known as spiritual power.</p>
<p>Roseline was uninterested in the occult because she did not believe in ghosts, but her ex-fiancé was. As a result, he frequently told stories.</p>
<p>‘When a person dies, the body vanishes and the soul departs. What if you were able to capture the flying soul?’</p>
<p>Roseline was confused because he kept asking unanswerable questions. She did, however, respect his interests. because she believed that conducting unscientific research was similar to reading a fictional novel or watching a play in which actors acted falsely.</p>
<p>She had no idea, however, that she would witness the existence of ghosts with her own eyes.</p>
<p>“Did he pass away here?” “Shouldn’t we find out why he was murdered unjustly?”</p>
<p>“We won’t be able to do it.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because it has no shape or form, I have no idea who it is.” Because there is nobody, the owner cannot be found. “Because there is no body, a soul that has lost something to prove its existence cannot go to heaven and is trapped on Earth.”</p>
<p>“Is there a way to launch it into the sky?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so, but…” “It is unknown if a superior person will arrive.”</p>
<p>Roseline was taken aback by Julian’s response.</p>
<p>It was strange to see a ghost, but even stranger was Julian’s ability to calm ghosts and make them fall asleep on the ground.</p>
<p>She struck him as a quiet, sincere, and intelligent young man who was bullied by his peers.</p>
<p>“I’m near death, so it seems to cling to me.”</p>
<p>“The ghost?”</p>
<p>“Yes,”</p>
<p>But why is such a child on the verge of death? Roseline wanted to ask, but she couldn’t because she was afraid the question would offend Julian.</p>
<p>Julian was probably used to this kind of thing, judging by his calm demeanor even after seeing a ghost.</p>
<p>How many ghosts and “deaths” has this child witnessed in his young life?</p>
<p>“Julian…… ”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Roseline. “Please avoid making eye contact with me.”</p>
<p>Julian lowered his head and pressed the back of his hand against his eyes.</p>
<p><em>Is it only me?</em> Something like a bright light seemed to shine from the boy’s blue eyes.</p>
<p>“Julian?”</p>
<p>“Everything is fine now.” “Fortunately, it subsided quickly.”</p>
<p>Julian raised his head again and looked at Roseline, slowly blinking. The boy’s eyes returned to the brilliant blue color she had first seen.</p>
<p>“I was afraid it would pop out again if it sank to the ground, so I took so much of my soul that I couldn’t keep its shape.” After that, I noticed a strange light in my eyes. “When they made eye contact with me, everyone was surprised and terrified.”</p>
<p>“… … .”</p>
<p>Roseline was unable to comprehend everything Julian said. What is it that steals the soul, and what is the light that comes out of the eyes?</p>
<p>But she believed Julian was telling the truth.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, Melchor had a peculiar glow in his eyes.”</p>
