            <p>The VIP room was located on the fourth floor.</p>
<p>As Roseline opened the heavy-looking dark reddish-brown door, her mother and Alfons, who was sitting on a large sofa in a wide VIP room, rose from their seats at the same time.</p>
<p>“Roseline!”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>She had never seen her mother and younger brother this happy. Roseline closed the door in a bit of a daze.</p>
<p>The two were easily released with the help of Grand Duke Postenmeyer after being interrogated. They arrived late because they were resting at the hotel on their way to the palace because they were not feeling well, perhaps because of their hard work.</p>
<p>“Roseline, the Duke of Postenmeyer has saved us.” Roseline mother exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know.” Roseline shrugged.</p>
<p>“And he made you his wife. It’s a really big favor. I can’t believe my daughter will become a Grand Duchess. What a miracle!</p>
<p>Roseline’s mother, Countess Renate Crimson Rose, smiled in her excitement and held Roseline’s hand tightly. She really seemed to regard Melchor as the savior of the family.</p>
<p>“It’s not wrong.”</p>
<p>The money spent to rescue the two was 70 million gold, and 3.6 million gold to regain the status and estates of the countess. Roseline’s mother did not seem to think about it at all, even though it was tantamount to handing over a generation-loss debt.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you’d be so happy.”</p>
<p>“Of course I’m happy! If you marry the Postenmeyer family, no one will look down on our Crimson Rose family, right?”</p>
<p><em>Is that really the case? </em>Roseline thought.</p>
<p>In reality, the Crimson Rose family would be treated as a subordinate family to the Grand Duchess of Postenmeyer. No, rather, from the point of view of a real subordinate family, Crimson Rose is just an unqualified rolling stone.</p>
<p>“Also, he promised full support to the management of the estate and the management of the mansion until he became an adult.”</p>
<p>“But it’s all debt.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>The wealth of Grand duke Postenmeyer, who paid a large sum of the country’s annual budget and did not suffer any loss, was admirable. However, their support was by no means taken for granted because the amount was not a burden to the princely family.</p>
<p>“Even if I work my whole life, I won’t be able to pay it back.”</p>
<p>“So, let’s live with gratitude.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Roseline’s father was killed while gambling was prohibited by national law. His titles and assets were confiscated, and Roseline and her family members will be imprisoned or placed on the streets.</p>
<p>It was Melchor who saved Roseline’s family. He defended the Crimson Rose family by pushing for marriage to Roseline in a radical and compulsory way.</p>
<p>But it is an act of kindness to Melchor. It is true that Roseline was saved, even if he had another purpose.</p>
<p>However, the unprovoked goodwill can disappear at any time. One day, even if Melchor changed his mind and divorced Roseline and cut off aid, they had to accept it without even saying a word of defense.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t we do something to pay back the money the Grand duke spent on our behalf?”</p>
<p>“Roseline, would your Highness Postenmeyer care about such trifles? Do you know how much the Postenmeyer family has? Perhaps it will never run out even if we spend our whole lives happily ever after.”</p>
<p>“So you’re going to go on a spree?”</p>
<p>Her mother opened her eyes wide and soon frowned at Roseline’s sharp question.</p>
<p>“Roseline, what are you talking about in front of your mom?”</p>
<p>“I’m just asking you questions.”</p>
<p>“What’s with your attitude to your mother?” Countess Crimson Rose raised her voice.</p>
<p>“You’re just leaving because you don’t have a father. Now that you have become Grand Duchess Postenmeyer, you mean to ignore your mother, the Countess of Crimson Rose?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that.”</p>
<p>“No! You’ve been protected here from the start, and you haven’t found us until the Grand Duke has saved us. Even when we were at the hotel, you didn’t even send me a hello letter, let alone come to see us!”</p>
<p>She couldn’t find them. Roseline was also stuck for the first week. After that, she was in a hurry to push for marriage. The only answer that came back every time she asked for the safety of my family was a relief to her. There was no one to help her. What can she do more by herself?</p>
<p>“The mansion also made that riot and put us in a corner, but you haven’t really changed at all.”</p>
<p>Her mother hasn’t changed a bit.</p>
<p>“Please pull yourself together. Aren’t you ashamed as Alfons’ sister?”</p>
<p>“I don’t live to set an example for Alfons.”</p>
<p>“That’s the way I think, that is why your fiance broke up your engagement!”</p>
<p>Roseline was stunned by her mother’s cry.</p>
