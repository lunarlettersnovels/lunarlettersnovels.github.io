            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the family’s finances deteriorated, Roseline insisted that she would work even if she entered the Knights Templar, but her father was extremely sensitive to external gaze. He ignored Roseline’s opinion, saying he didn’t want to hear that his daughter, who didn’t even hold an adult ceremony, was setting up a family with the money she earned from working and tried to find a way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline’s father met scammers, caused disasters, and acted as a blind man with an invisible business. Aggravating the situation, he then eventually tried gambling as his last resort. However, what can the landlord, who made the family poor because he couldn’t even manage the land properly, do? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline’s father had been acting behind his family’s back, fearing that law enforcers would catch him. However, his gambling act was a felony equivalent to treason under imperial law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the Crimson Rose family was destroyed in an instant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At this moment, we will seize the territory and property of Count Crimson Rose! Any member of the Crimson Rose family who violated the imperial law should show themselves and admit their sins!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crimson Rose mansion was in chaos at the unannounced arrival of the knights. Screams, objects breaking, and heavy footsteps echo throughout the place, making it look like they were getting attacked by bandits. Roseline heard the loud voices even from a distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline’s mother, Countess Renate Crimson Rose, opened her eyes wide and asked her daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roseline, what is the meaning of this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline, who watched through the window and witnessed the whole disaster outside, looked back at her mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is said that my father gambled. He died while running away to avoid arrest at the scene, and since they have evidence against him, they told my father not to rebel and turn himself in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not asking because I don’t understand that! What’s this all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are you asking me that?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a question that Roseline could not answer, for her mother had always blamed Roseline when she was in a dire situation. As if this happened because of her doings. Roseline was not particularly angry because she was already used to being criticized for something that was not her fault. However, the situation was too serious to ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I checked the flag’s pattern. It must be the Blue Knights of His Majesty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So your father gambled? He got caught running away and lost his life?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, my father was also your husband.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline didn’t expect her father would even gamble, but she was mistaken. Due to business failures, her father sold most of their lands. She expected him to do something that could save their situation, but she didn’t mean that he should commit a crime and hide it from his family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What should I do now? Are we all going to be arrested as well? If you’re a sinner, you’ll lose your pretense. What about young Alfons?” her mother cried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young brother, who was in his mother’s arms, couldn’t make a decent sound and was only shedding tears. He didn’t understand the situation yet, and he could only cry in response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…We didn’t know my father was gambling. We’re not at fault.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The knights are certain! If they didn’t conclude that we were sinners, why would they invade us?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trembling at the chaos heard from the hall on the first floor, the mother hugged her son, who was more cherished than her own body. The family was staying on the third floor, but once the knights invaded the mansion, they would reach them soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What should I do now… It’s over!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it the end?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Roseline thought. If so, her father has indeed gambled, so he must be the one held responsible. Even if the knights were following the order of the Empress, they could not invade the Count without justification.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know. And my mother… If we can prove that we are not involved in our father’s gambling, we can avoid being deprived of our status and imprisoned.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline recalled what the loud-voiced knight said a little earlier. He had told them to admit their crimes, but she was certain it’ll only be used against them in the court. When falsely accused, you must resist as much as you can and claim innocence. It is also included in the academy’s law textbook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The professor had said: “The law in this country is strange. Even if you don’t die, you’ll get hurt. However, if you do not resist to that extent, you will surely be at a disadvantage in the trial.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline learned that it is difficult to reverse the ruling if the judge’s mouth says, “Isn’t it because you didn’t even resist even though you were caught falsely?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll block them,” she finally said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? How can you stop those soldiers alone?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll try as much as I can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Roseline got up from her seat and took the two swords hanging on the wall, her mother’s face turned white. But it wasn’t from concern for her daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you crazy? What if the knights get angry?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re taken calmly, it’s more disadvantageous in a trial. You have to resist as hard as you can,” Roseline replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What if they harm us even before we get a trial?” her mother asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But by “us”, her mother only meant herself and young Alfons. It does not include Roseline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Roseline wasn’t disappointed nor discouraged because she was so used to it. She wasn’t expecting affection from her mother. It has always been that way. Roseline stepped forward and opened the door to the drawing-room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So hide, I made it clear for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, Roseline! Roseline!”</span></p>
