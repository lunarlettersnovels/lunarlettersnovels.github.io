<p>“I was curious as to who created this type of thesis,” Roseline said. “I was dying to meet her and ask her a question.”</p>
<p>“What? Now, hold on a second,” the princess interrupted. “Roseline? Who are you…?”</p>
<p>“Your graduation thesis isn’t the only well-known one,” she replied. “Just read your four poems from middle school.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute! Are you insane?” the princess exclaimed. “Why would you read something like that?”</p>
<p>“Records of Imperial Academy class materials exist,” Roseline explained. “The thesis you wrote when you graduated from a higher academy was used in class.”</p>
<p>“It’s handwritten!” the princess exclaimed, her face turning red, white, and blue. She seemed ashamed to see the color of her face alter so dramatically, even with makeup on.</p>
<p>“No, do you really use it in class?” the princess asked, her tone turning hostile. “Are you insane? I’ve never let it happen.”</p>
<p>“Data can be used for academic research without the parties’ permission,” she said, ready to land one last blow.</p>
<p>“Because the example sentence was so good, I’m still remembering it,” she said.</p>
<p>“What do you memorize?” the princess asked, her tone growing more curious.</p>
<p>“Would you like me to play it for you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Balancing the world is necessary, therefore, while some individuals work hard, others prefer to idle their time,” Roseline recited. “As long as all monarchs set a good example for their people, it’s not good to insult the lives of the uninterested, so if they are truly excellent monarchs, they will feel sympathy and hope for them…”</p>
<p>“Stop!” the princess exclaimed, clearly upset.</p>
<p>Princess Annestrote covered Roseline’s mouth with her arms, but Roseline ducked backward to avoid it. “What’s the point of memorizing it?” the princess asked.</p>
<p>“I told you. It was outstanding,” Roseline replied calmly, taking a drink of tea. She explained that there had been a lot of exchanges between the Capital Academy, where the princess graduated, and the Western Academy, where Roseline had attended.</p>
<p>The princess’s expression quickly soured. “If I became Emperor, I would shut down all academies,” Roseline heard her say.</p>
<p>“I apologize, Roseline,” the princess finally said, hoisting the white flag. “I’m sorry for being disrespectful all of a sudden. I was curious how you behave when you’re upset.”</p>
<p>Roseline was taken aback. “You intended to irritate me? Why?”</p>
<p>“Honestly, because of our statuses, it’s so difficult for us to get to know each other because we’re looking for politeness when we first meet, right? So, I do this if I want to get to know my opponent quickly,” the princess admitted.</p>
<p>Roseline was surprised and concerned that she might have made an enemy of the princess. But the princess continued, “Being nasty was offensive. It’s the first time I’ve heard someone say that to me. In fact, I came halfway to attack you. I was envious as well.”</p>
<p>The princess then revealed that Melchor, whom Roseline had been dating, had dumped her. Roseline was surprised, but she understood why he would choose her over the princess.</p>
<p>“Did the princess, then, like Melchor?” Roseline asked.</p>
<p>“You must have had a difficult time,” the princess said. “That’s correct. It was really difficult to accept that my fantasy of being unemployed had come to an end.”</p>
<p>The princess went on to say that she was sad she couldn’t count on Melchor to run the center while she ran the east. Roseline found her views strange, but she was curious about what the princess was planning to do.</p>
<p>“Anyway, that’s all I’ve got,” the princess said. “It wasn’t what I expected, but I’m happy to see that Roseline is a wonderful person. I thought Melchor shouldn’t marry an ordinary woman.”</p>
<p>“I’m not very good…” Roseline protested.</p>
<p>“You are incredible,” the princess reassured her. “Most folks get overly upset when I pick a fight like this. Some people put up with it or ignore it. I’ve never encountered such a reaction.”</p>
<p>The princess then asked about Roseline’s plans for her upcoming wedding, specifically if it would be private. Roseline didn’t know what to say, so the princess told her, “That gift over there is just a part of what I brought. The rest will come later today.”</p>
<p>“Are you coming back?” Roseline asked.</p>
<p>“It’s for Roseline, so make the best of what you’ve been given,” the princess replied. “I believe you’ll be successful at this.”</p>
<p>Roseline was unsure what the princess meant by her final statement, but she didn’t have a chance to ask as the princess quickly left the room like a bolt of lightning, her exit as swift as the wind. In truth, Roseline had wanted to hold her back and ask her to stay longer, but the princess was not close to her and her character was so oppressive that Roseline didn’t feel comfortable doing so.</p>
