            <p>Alfons has seen his mother and sister argue a lot since he was young, at an age he can’t even remember. When his mother shouted something, his sister always protested with a few words, closed her mouth, and left her seat.</p>
<p>Then yesterday, her sister confronted their mother and kicked her out of the palace. It was a shocking scene for young Alfons.</p>
<p>When he was in Crimson Rose’s mansion, Alfons also slept alone in his room, but this place was so unfamiliar to him. In addition, in the shock of his mother’s expulsion, Alfons eventually couldn’t sleep. He kept tossing and turning around his bed and decided to come out of the room. He was scared of the dark hallway, but he went down the stairs carefully.</p>
<p><em>Mom will be in the annex.</em></p>
<p>It was the first time he had seen his sister so enraged, but she didn’t completely expel her mother. She sent her mother to the West Annex. Alfons came out of the main building to visit his mother. But there were buildings on both sides.</p>
<p><em>Which way is the west?</em></p>
<p>Frustrated, Alfons headed first to the nearby building, where the lights were on. It was an act that followed the instinct that there would be someone because there was light.</p>
<p>The boy, who thought it would be faster to knock on the window than to enter the entrance, approached the window where the light leaked and heard the stories the servants were talking about.</p>
<p>&lt;Isn’t that ridiculous? The fact that the only Grand Duke of the Empire would marry a woman from such a poor western noble family. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;It’s not even a noble family. I heard their title was even confiscated, but the Grand Duke gave it back to them. &gt;</p>
<p>Her father broke the law; after all, they are a criminal family. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;It is ridiculous that such a family chose to refuse to participate in the Emperor’s arranged marriage with the Empress Annestrotte.” &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Did you see her kick her mother out, too? There’s no family of bean powder.&gt;</p>
<p>The young Alfons did not know much about the power and families of the nobility. However, he knew that Grand Duke Porstenmayer’s family was the most traditional and wealthy in the empire and that his family, the Crimson Rose family, nearly fell apart in an instant because they committed such a heinous crime.</p>
<p><em>Family of criminals…</em></p>
<p>Even a six-year-old child could understand why the servants intended to say such a thing. They were not so much ignoring the Crimson Rose family as despising them.</p>
<p>The Grand Duke of Portenmeyer was the pride of the empire. It was not just because the territory was wide and the authority was strong, but because loyal people gathered in the Postenmeyer family from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Their souls are engraved with the grace they owe to the Postenmeyer family.</p>
<p>It was about the Grand Duke of Porstenmeyer’s subordinate families and those who gathered under his command.</p>
<p>They had great pride. The nobles they worked for were not aristocrats, but they were different from other nobles.</p>
<p>This means that it was an honor for a servant to be ranked by the noble families they worked for.</p>
<p>They were devastated that such a great grand duke as Postenmeyer married a small family of no name or honor in the west.</p>
<p>What’s more absurd is that it’s not just an ordinary Korean-American family, but a closed-class noble family that committed a felony equivalent to treason.</p>
<p>“The Grand Duchess is a criminal’s daughter; does that make sense?” &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;If it were her, I would have been shy and could not carry my face.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;When I heard that the Grand Duke of Postenmeyer was recruiting employees, I wouldn’t have come if I knew he would take the criminal family as his wife.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;The same goes for me.&gt;</p>
<p>The servants who came in this time were those who ran a long way with a determination to work for the Postenmeyer family and were hired after passing strict screening.</p>
<p>&lt;I can never admit such a woman as a madam.&gt;</p>
<p>It was a natural reaction.</p>
<p>If it was the Grand Duke of Melchor they served, of course, the hostess should also be a person who fits the Duchess’s “class.”</p>
<p>Even an ordinary woman from a simple family doesn’t choke on her surname, but what if a former aristocrat becomes their Grand Duchess? It was unacceptable.</p>
<p>&lt;The butler intentionally recruited servants by posting a notice, but they said she fired three people because she didn’t like them?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;It’s funny. What did she know? She had no experience in managing employees..&gt;</p>
<p>The butler remained silent about the reason why three servants were cut off the day after signing the employment contract. This is because he was reluctant to reveal that he hired them because he failed to check their identity. only the fact that they were fired under the authority of the Grand Duchess.</p>
<p>So the servants realized the Grand Duchess had fired three decent servants.</p>
<p>&lt;They did not commit any accidents, but how did she cut it the day after hiring? That’s ridiculous. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;She is the daughter of a criminal. What do you expect? &gt;</p>
<p>&lt; She kicked her mother out of the building, too. It was scary. &gt;</p>
<p>While they were talking a lot of gossip about the grand duchess’ secret, someone popped up.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we purposely cause an accident and humiliate her?”</p>
