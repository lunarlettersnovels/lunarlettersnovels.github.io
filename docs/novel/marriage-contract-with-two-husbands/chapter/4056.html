            <p>Before they knew it, the two reached the hallway on the fourth floor. Countess Crimson Rose decided to return to the VIP room where Alfons was staying.</p>
<p>Melchor became nervous. He had heard that she had an argument with her mother, the Countess, but she said she would go see her family; he couldn’t ask her to deal with her without seeing her anyway. However, he could not intervene in the private conversation of the Crimson Rose family, whom he had never met.</p>
<p>If Roseline opened the door and entered, the opportunity to talk to her would be cut off.</p>
<p>“Roseline, wait!”</p>
<p>As he hastily grabbed Roseline’s hand to open the door, she stared at Melchor with her eyes wide open, as if she were surprised.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m sorry. Wait a minute…”</p>
<p>It stopped too threateningly. Melchor apologized and stepped back. He had to talk to her before she opened the door. His brain, which must have been intelligent and cold at one time, turned faster than it would have on the battlefield at this moment.</p>
<p>“Roseline, do you want anything from me?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly.”</p>
<p>Roseline’s answer was simple. But Melchor did not give up.</p>
<p>“Anything will do. Yeah, well… Tell me if there’s anything you want to eat, something you want.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know…”</p>
<p>“Do you have anything to ask of me?”</p>
<p>Roseline’s green eyes slowly shifted their gaze up and to the right.</p>
<p><em>What can I ask Melchor to do?</em></p>
<p>While slowly retracing her memory, Deborah came into Roseline’s head.</p>
<p>A young girl named Deborah is falsely accused of setting a fire by her fellow servants in the Postenmeyer household. As a result, she is mistreated and left feeling scared and vulnerable.</p>
<p>“I have one.”</p>
<p>“Really? What is it?”</p>
<p>Roseline, the hostess of the household, feels sympathy for Deborah and wants to help her by making her a personal maid. She seeks permission from Melchor, the head of the household, to do so and explains the situation to him</p>
<p>“Can I use Deborah as my maid?”</p>
<p>“Deborah?”</p>
<p>Melchor didn’t know who Deborah was. He left the affairs of the mansion to the butler and housekeeper and just told them to add more people if they were short of hands. He couldn’t have known the name of the new maid, who had come in only a month ago.</p>
<p>“Deborah is a young girl who works as a maid in the Postenmeyer household. She was falsely accused of setting fire by her fellow servants and has been mistreated as a result. I feel sorry for her, and I don’t want her to be intimidated by others just because she is weak.”</p>
<p>Roseline explained it to Melchor.</p>
<p>“I understand. I’ll make sure she is treated well and given proper work. You have my word.”</p>
<p>Melchor nodded in agreement. He may not have known Deborah by name, but he understood the importance of treating all of his employees with respect and fairness.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Melchor. I really appreciate it.”</p>
<p>Roseline smiled at him, relieved that Deborah would have a chance to start over. And thus, Deborah was given a chance to work as Roseline’s maid, and she proved to be a hardworking and good servant.</p>
<p>But Melchor asked because he wanted to do Roseline a favor. It was not cool to ask who Deborah was here.</p>
<p>He nodded his head in a nonchalant manner.</p>
<p>“Well, do it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Melchor.”</p>
<p>Roseline gently lowered her eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>It was his first time seeing her smile.</p>
<p>Melchor was mesmerized by her smile. Time seemed to stop.</p>
<p>When he came to his senses, there was no Roseline. He didn’t even notice that she opened the door and went in while he was absent-minded.</p>
<p>He heard voices from the room. He wondered what Roseline was talking about with her family.</p>
<p>He thought about eavesdropping, but he abandoned the idea because he thought it would be inappropriate, not to mention rude.</p>
<p>First of all, he had to comply with her request. Melchor went down the stairs and found Hugo, the butler.</p>
<p>“Come with me!”</p>
<p>His faithful butler, who appeared at any time when called, still approached the owner in a neat and tidy manner and bowed his head.</p>
<p>“Did you call me, sir?”</p>
<p>“Who is Deborah?”</p>
<p>“She is a young maid who applied four days ago when I was recruiting additional workers. She came in two days ago because she was coming in as a substitute.”</p>
<p>Melchor finally got a clue. A young maid who recently entered the mansion, Roseline, said she wanted to use the child as a maid of honor.</p>
<p>He didn’t miss the chance to figure out her ‘private parts’.</p>
<p>“Bring the child in. Now!”</p>
<p>Deborah, the new maid, stood uneasily, shaking her skinny arms and legs.</p>
<p>“Is this Deborah?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Instead of Deborah, who was frozen close, the butler Hugo stepped forward to answer.</p>
<p>Deborah couldn’t make eye contact with Melchor and was shaking just looking at the carpet on the floor.</p>
<p>No wonder, Melchor’s imposing presence, and aura were enough to make people around him uneasy. To assist him for a long time, one had to be bold.</p>
<p>Deborah came in as a maid in charge of small chores, so the butler judged that she would rarely encounter Melchor. So he chose her without a test of courage, but he didn’t expect her to face the Grand Duke like this.</p>
<p>Hugo, the butler, sighed inside because he thought he had made another mistake.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with her?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not sick. I was only skinny and hired after being diagnosed by a doctor that there was nothing wrong with my health.”</p>
<p>“But why are you shaking like that? Is it cold?”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Melchor seemed to have no idea that Deborah was shaking in fear of him.</p>
<p>“Deborah.”</p>
<p>“Well, uh, yes!”</p>
<p>Deborah barely moved her trembling lips to answer. Still, she couldn’t look at Melchor’s face.</p>
<p>With black hair and a black uniform, pale skin, and icy blue eyes, his appearance was intimidating.</p>
<p>Her body had been shaking just because she was in the same space with him as if they were of different species.</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Melchor carefully examined Deborah’s figure.</p>
<p>Lean limbs, crumbly brown hair braided in pigtails, a 14-year-old little girl with freckles on her face.</p>
<p>Roseline said she would like to have such a child as a maid of honor. He wondered why.</p>
<p>Specifying someone as her maid in particular means she liked her.</p>
<p>According to the butler’s report, there were few encounters with Roseline, but what did Roseline like about this child?</p>
<p>Melchor wondered how Deborah had ingratiated herself with Roseline.</p>
<p>“Roseline said she wanted you as a maid of honor.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes….”</p>
<p>“Do you know why?”</p>
<p>“What…??”</p>
<p>Deborah managed to clear her mind, enduring the incoming fear.</p>
