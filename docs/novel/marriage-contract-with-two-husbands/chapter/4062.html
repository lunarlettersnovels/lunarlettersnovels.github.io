            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as their eyes met, Roseline felt her heart skip a beat. She was entranced by the mesmerizing gaze of the stranger before her, a man whose piercing blue eyes were so intense that they seemed to penetrate her very soul. She couldn’t believe that anyone could possess such an arresting gaze, but then again, Melchor had the same striking features as Julian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was strange, she knew, to compare the two based solely on their physical attributes – black hair, blue eyes, and pale skin – but she couldn’t help herself. Despite having nothing in common, the two men had left an indelible impression on her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melchor, with his self-indulgent and incomprehensible demeanor, was nothing like the well-mannered and kind-hearted Julian. And yet, in her heart, Roseline couldn’t help but feel guilty for having compared the two in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Julian, are you alright?” she asked, breaking the silence that had descended upon them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m fine,” he replied, pointing to his leg. “It’s much better now, thanks to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had set his leg and applied a splint, and she was pleased to see that the swelling had completely subsided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roseline?” Julian’s voice was filled with curiosity. “Do you think absorbing the ghost’s soul has something to do with the healing process?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline nodded. “Yes, I believe it does.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry if I scared you earlier,” he said apologetically. “Let’s go now, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without waiting for her answer, Julian took her hand in his. Roseline felt a jolt of electricity run through her body at the contact, and she couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief at the warmth of his touch. She quickly became embarrassed, realizing that she was the one who was supposed to be protecting him, not the other way around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Julian seemed not to notice her unease. “Thank you for your help, Roseline,” he said sincerely. “I couldn’t have made it out of there without you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I should be thanking you,” she replied, feeling her chest flutter with emotion. “I’m sorry I dragged you into this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julian’s eyes softened as he looked at her. “I mean it, Roseline. You’re a true hero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her heart skipped a beat at his words. This child reminded her so much of herself, someone who preferred to act alone and to avoid being thanked or judged by others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without another word, Roseline took Julian’s hand and squeezed it gently, the two of them walking hand in hand as they left the forest behind them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for today, Roseline,” Julian said as they approached the dorms. “I’m heading back now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take care,” she said, feeling a pang of sadness at the thought of their time together coming to an end. end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She let go of the clasped hand and smiled at Julian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy raised his head to look at Roseline, then lowered it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can we get together again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, no! “What am I saying?  I’ll be on my way!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julian scurried to pick up the horse before turning around and fleeing. Roseline paused to see Julian’s back as he walked away, but then turned to face the square and the plaza.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">****</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“MadameMadam Roseline!” The escort knight, Nicholas, called out to her and rushed towards her as if he had been eagerly waiting for her to emerge from the forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was worried when I lost sight of you. Have you been well?” he asked, concerned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline apologized for causing him concern and thanked him for his care. Nicholas, however, was pleased to have met her and led her and Julian to the Grand Park manager without delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline wondered how much time had passed since they left the forest. She had spent what felt like a long time conversing with Julian, but Nicholas seemed relieved, relieved as though he had only missed her for a brief moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking up at the sky, Roseline realized that only a short while had passed. She found it challenging to explain her experience in the forest, where darkness made it impossible to determine the direction of the sun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She pondered if time had played tricks on her, as it had on people trapped in caves who thought they had been there for only a few hours, when in fact, they had been there for several days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline gazed out into the forest and tried to locate Julian’s escape route. However, no sign of him could be seen on the forest’s edge. Frowning, she pressed her fingertips against her eyes, realizing that she was straining them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerned, Nicholas asked if she had a headache, but Roseline waved him off and walked towards the Grand Park’s manager. The rental contract was soon terminated, and Roseline, accompanied by Nicholas, returned to the Postenmeyer villa in time for her wedding.</span></p>
