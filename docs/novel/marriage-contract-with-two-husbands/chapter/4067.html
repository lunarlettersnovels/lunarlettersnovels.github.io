            <p>“If the table is installed, the chairs will be arranged in a circle like this. This distance is required due to the circulation of servants carrying food.”</p>
<p>“What exactly is that tent?” Roseline pointed at the tent.</p>
<p>” Members of the previous symphony orchestra temporarily performed it for tuning purposes. Until the wedding… No, we’re going to demolish it right now.”</p>
<p>The manager nodded to Roseline and told the workers to take down the tent. While they worked, Roseline decided to take a look around her.</p>
<p>Beautiful green trees surrounded the square, and red rose bushes grew along the signposts pointing in the right direction. This park is in the heart of the city, but when you stand there, you feel like you’re in an outdoor hall in the mountains, not a city garden.</p>
<p>It’s her first time visiting the capital.</p>
<p>She couldn’t leave the mansion because she was locked up there, and after the wedding was set, she was busy with other things and didn’t think about leaving. Roseline, on the other hand, didn’t know anyone in the capital city, so she didn’t have to go out.</p>
<p>The majority of the eastern nobility interacted with the Postenmeyer family, and Melchor did not invite them to the wedding because he planned to keep it simple.</p>
<p>There was no greeting or letter received. They will have a wedding and then travel east.</p>
<p><em>East… Will I have the ability to adapt?</em></p>
<p>Even the church’s priest, who didn’t know anyone, didn’t know Roseline’s name because it was pronounced in a western way.</p>
<p>Easterners dislike meeting strangers. Will Roseline be able to blend in among the East’s nobles?</p>
<p>She truly lacked confidence.</p>
<p>“Whoa…… what?”</p>
<p>Roseline sighed and raised her head. When she noticed the darkness around her, she was taken aback.</p>
<p><em>Where is the highway?</em></p>
<p>She was apparently in the outdoor hall where the ceremony was to be held until a short time ago, but she entered the forest while lost in thought and looking at the sign wrapped in red rose vines.</p>
<p>It was a densely forested area. The trees were tall enough to block the midday sun, and the road was paved with bumpy stones.</p>
<p>Roseline tilted her head, perplexed.</p>
<p>Near Park, which has an outdoor hall, was originally a new-style park created by building a road and laying blocks in the middle of the capital’s dense forest.</p>
<p>The park, which was only five years old, was located on the capital’s busiest street and was teeming with people.</p>
<p>Of course, it should be well-kept, but doesn’t this place resemble a deserted mountain?</p>
<p><em>Is it still underdeveloped?</em></p>
<p>Roseline crossed the dense forest with a tilt of her head. The sun’s light narrowly entered through the dark shadows cast by the thick leaves.</p>
<p>It was an odd sensation. Roseline felt as if she had stepped into a forest, despite the fact that she was in the empire’s capital, in a park in the middle of one of the busiest streets.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a dense forest; it felt like she was exploring a new world.</p>
<p>Is it correct to say that there is no sense of reality?</p>
<p>The scent of fresh leaves, the cool breeze gently entering through the cracks in the branches, and the sound of stepping on the pebbles on the floor were all clearly present, but it all felt hazy as if it were a dream. It could be due to the nearby cave and the sound of the flowing stream.</p>
<p>She recalls feeling like this one day. What year was it? It hasn’t been a long time. She must have passed by a red rose bush once…</p>
<p>“Over there!”</p>
<p>Someone’s voice was heard. The sound of a young boy’s voice. It’s also not just one. Are they the students who came to play in the park? Roseline was looking around when she noticed a small shadow running towards her.</p>
<p>It was only for a split second, but she recognized who it was.</p>
<p>“Julian!”</p>
<p>When Roseline’s name was called, the boy who had been running frantically stopped.</p>
<p>“Stand right there!”</p>
<p>Other boys’ voices could be heard in the distance. Is it possible that you are being pursued? Roseline motioned to Yulian, who shook his head. Roseline attempted to change her pace in the opposite direction as if she didn’t want to get involved.</p>
<p>“Julian, come here right away!”</p>
<p>The voice became louder as she became more hurried. Julian took a step closer to</p>
<p>Roseline paused for a moment and then jumped back as if he had made up his mind.</p>
<p>“Run away, Roseline.”</p>
<p>“Yes. come here.”</p>
<p>Julian intended to tell Roseline to flee, but Roseline grabbed Julian’s hand and pulled it away.</p>
<p>“On my way here, I noticed a cave.”</p>
<p>She thought it was a little far away, but after a few steps, she was getting closer. Perhaps she misidentified perspective because she was walking while blankly thinking. Roseline and Yulian entered the cave together.</p>
<p>“Roseline…… ”</p>
<p>“Shh.”</p>
<p>The sound of several footsteps approached, then faded. It appears to be excessive.</p>
<p>“It appears that everything has passed.”</p>
