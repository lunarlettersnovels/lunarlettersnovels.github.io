        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“You were a real beauty when I met you. You’ve never been to the capital’s social circle, have you? If you had attended at least once, it would have been known right away.”</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem like a compliment, but she couldn’t stand still when the princess spoke like that, so Roseline gave a formal thank you.</p>
<p>“I would like to speak with you alone. Would you mind giving me a moment?”</p>
<p>Was Roseline taking her lightly, or is it because she ignores her manners? Looking at her tone alone, she is arrogant, but her expression is friendly, and her actions are powerful.</p>
<p><em>I wasn’t older than Melchor…?</em></p>
<p>Roseline, suppressing the feeling of being hiccuped for some reason, led the princess to the parlor on the first floor.</p>
<p>“Wow, I can’t believe what I see here! It looks amazing! For the first time in my life, I visited the Postenmeyer cottage. While I requested the Grand Duke to invite me, he did not do so despite the fact that I asked him to do so.”</p>
<p><em>Is she close to Melchor, as she asked him to invite her?</em></p>
<p>No, but if you’ve never been invited, doesn’t that mean you’re not close?</p>
<p>Is that the case, and if so, what is the princess’ attitude toward it? Due to the fact that they were not acquainted, it was necessary to search for them. As Roseline sat across from her, her butler, Hugo, asked her to make tea for her.</p>
<p>“I am not prepared because I do not know that you will come suddenly. Please understand.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be formal, Roseline. I’m not the kind of person who cares about that.”</p>
<p>The words were short. Besides, she just called her name.</p>
<p>“Would you mind letting the butler go? It’s a bit different when there’s a man in conversation with women.”</p>
<p>“Hugo, get out.”</p>
<p>No matter how much she thought about it, the princess’ attitude was rude. If so, should she make a comment? Roseline was in trouble.</p>
<p>“First of all, thank you for the gift. I didn’t expect you to send me so much.”</p>
<p>“We had to spend more initially. I didn’t get all of them because I wanted to see Roseline’s face, but I just left quickly.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes… .”</p>
<p>No matter how free-spirited the princess was, it wasn’t the Grand Duchess’s place to be so rude. She’s not an idiot either.</p>
<p><em>There must be some purpose.</em></p>
<p>It was impossible to tell if she was simply looking at Roseline in a blissful way, or if she had another purpose in mind. Some of the gifts she brought were sent by her empress, so there’s no doubt she’s a spy on the empress’s side.</p>
<p><em>Are you intending to be very rude, to excite me, and then take advantage of my weakness?</em></p>
<p>Or she could be rude and embarrass Roseline, hitting her on the back of her head, knocking her out, and kidnapping her. Roseline made sure her princess did not bring any assassins. She did not seem suspicious in any way.</p>
<p>“I proposed to Melchor four years ago and got dumped. So I was so curious about who Melchor decided to marry.”</p>
<p>“I come from the Crimson Roses of the West.”</p>
<p>“I know that. Because he’s famous.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“It’s rare for a father to commit a crime and get killed, right? This is the first case of a returning nobleman.”</p>
<p>Princess Annestrote clenched her chin and smiled.</p>
<p><em>It’s really rude.</em></p>
<p>Roseline was wary of getting hit in the back of her head, but her thoughts were short. It didn’t occur to her that they would attack so openly in front of her.</p>
<p>As soon as the princess arrived, Roseline thought she was doing nothing but rude things, so a counterattack was self-defense. She can get angry.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p><em>Things are terrible.</em></p>
<p>Witnesses disappeared because of Hugo’s release. Of course, he had a problem with his attitude when he came here. Roseline’s reputation among her servants is very dishonorable. So, if she gets upset and kicks her princess out, that is a dishonorable act of self-defense. All that will be discussed is that “there is no other choice but to become a criminal’s daughter.”</p>
<p><em>Besides, she won’t be hurt if I kick her out in anger.</em></p>
<p>She suddenly came over and made such abusive remarks, she would think it was worth it even if she got angry and kicked her out. Roseline didn’t know what the purpose of this rude thing was, but she didn’t want to act according to the will of the princess.</p>
<p><em>Then how will I respond?</em></p>
<p>Continuing to act in this way is foolish.</p>
<p>However, sending her out in anger is against her reputation.</p>
<p>Then there is only one way left. The princess did the same, mentioning the most shameful fact.</p>
<p>“I also wanted to see the princess once.”</p>
<p>“Uh? Okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Roseline took the cup, smelled the tea, and put it down.</p>
<p>“I read your graduation thesis at the academy.”</p>
<p>The confident expression of the princess cracked.</p>
