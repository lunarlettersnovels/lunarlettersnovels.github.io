<p>The emperor’s presence was different from usual. All the thick curtains covering the window were open, and bright light poured into the wide room. Sitting across from the emperor was an unexpected figure.</p>
<p>The beautiful woman, who looked strong and had curly black hair and red eyes, sat up straight in front of the emperor.</p>
<p>The daughter of the former emperor and niece of the current emperor. It was Princess Annestrote, the Imperial Daughter, who was appointed as the next empress.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know Melchor was such an unpredictable man.”</p>
<p>“Well.”</p>
<p>Opening all the windows, the half-blind emperor sat with a black cloth hanging from the throne. After his rude niece said over and over that she hated how dark the den was, he took down all the curtains. The throne has become cozy due to the sunlight. Emperor Baltazar smiled gracefully as he swept the golden cup with his fingertips.</p>
<p>“If Melchor is fickle, there are few men in the world who are not.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. He even refused to marry me.”</p>
<p>Princess Annestrote proposed to Melchor four years ago and was dumped. It wasn’t so much that she was dumped as that she went in the wrong direction with her proposal, which was full of passion and determination.</p>
<p>“Melchor said he had no intention of getting married at that time.”</p>
<p>“It was four years ago, wasn’t it? It’s enough time for a person’s thoughts to change.”</p>
<p>“Would Melchor have been my husband if I had waited four years?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The Emperor denied it.</p>
<p>As it is now, four years ago, Melchor was the best groom ever to covet, even abroad. Having just become a great duke, he was given a name by the emperor and danced as the strongest knight in the empire.</p>
<p>Is that all? Even from a distance, the number of women who secretly adored him was never small, fascinated by his tall, beautiful appearance, and the sensual, mid-to-low sound that fell in front of their ears. Annestrote, the daughter of the emperor, was no exception.</p>
<p>Although, of course, she had a slightly different reason for targeting Melchor as her husband.</p>
<p>&lt;He is competent. When Melchor is appointed as a national secretary, there is no reason for me to be stuck in troubling politics. I can entrust the government to my husband and live a jobless life!&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;… … .&gt;</p>
<p>Melchor is the best groom ever! If she marries him, there will be a revolution in which even a single emperor can become unemployed. Wouldn’t it be of great historical significance?&gt;</p>
<p>Emperor Baltazar was very upset, but he had to find a partner for the princess to marry. The emperor eventually persuaded Melchor to marry him.</p>
<p>&lt;Melchor, you know that my niece Annestrote has you in mind.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;No.&gt;</p>
<p>Melchor’s answer was far too simple. Emperor Baltazar, who had nothing to say in his too-simple answer, coughed in vain and continued.</p>
<p>&lt;Then you should know from now on. Annestrote is old enough to have a husband, but she doesn’t have the right person. Melchor, what do you think?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;No, Your Highness&gt;</p>
<p>It was an answer with a firmness that seemed not to fit a needle.</p>
<p>He would prefer to find an appropriate compromise if Melchor would tell him that he doesn’t like it or that it is difficult for some reason, but neither persuasion, conciliation, nor threats seemed to work against Melchor.</p>
<p>&lt;Um, I understand. It’s a little too much for Annestrote.&gt;</p>
<p>Taking the Grand Duke of Postenmeyer as a subject helps the emperor keep his power. So, not even the emperor could make Melchor, the Grand Duke of Postenmeyer, do something that was not fair.</p>
<p>Melchor’s will was stubborn enough to push ahead with his marriage to the imperial daughter Annestrote, and in fact, it was an undesirable marriage for an emperor, so it soon became nothing.</p>
<p>The problem is that it touched the pride of the princess.</p>
<p>&lt;How dare you break my dream!&gt;</p>
<p>She thinks it was a dream that would be beneficial to the world if it were broken, but in any case, Princess Annestrote followed suit and began to confront Melchor more actively.</p>
<p>In a way, the Princess’ willingness to stand in front of a competent husband and enjoy a free life was more passionate and sincere than a confession of love, but of course, it did not bear fruit. The emperor was truly relieved.</p>
<p>“So you should stop and give up, Melchor.”</p>
<p>“I can’t give up.”</p>
<p>“Melchor seems to be determined.”</p>
<p>“You never know.”</p>
<p>Princess Annestrote rose with a proud sniff.</p>
<p>She looks perfectly fine, but how did her outlook on life become like that?</p>
<p><em>When it comes to kids, she’s a good one. I wish she would just give up.</em></p>
<p>The emperor ended up laughing. He was a valuable successor to him, one way or another. As the emperor of one country, he couldn’t support Annestrote ‘s love for him, or rather, her dream for him, but he wanted to keep a lukewarm eye on what she was doing.</p>
<p>“So, Annestrote, what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have to check who the girl is who got Melchor so into it.”</p>
<p>The eyes of Princess Annestrote flashed. Red eyes were like the emperor, if the emperor’s eyes were as thick as a pool of blood, her eyes were like a blazing fire.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>After lunch, Roseline went back to Alfons’ office on the second floor to make sure he was sound asleep. She worked here a few times, and even though it was the office of the Grand Duke, it was comfortable as if it were for her.</p>
<p>Today, she must finish organizing the genealogy of subordinate families.</p>
<p>She was about to start work when a butler named Hugo came.</p>
<p>“Madam, we have a visitor.”</p>
<p>“Guest?”</p>
