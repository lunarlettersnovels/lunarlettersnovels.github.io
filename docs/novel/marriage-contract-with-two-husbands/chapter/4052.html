            <p>“What do you mean by prepared?” Melchor asked, appearing to blind the other person with his intensity.</p>
<p>The question on the table was whether Roséline expected Melchor, who was still in love with his first love, to neglect his duties as a husband, and if she had already devised a countermeasure.</p>
<p>Melchor was not pleased with this assumption.</p>
<p>Despite being criticized, ridiculed, or misunderstood, he did not feel that it impacted his worth because he was honest with himself. However, the thought that Roseline could believe he was capable of cheating on his wife made him feel uneasy.</p>
<p>“I’m not that kind of man. That resolution doesn’t change anything, I swear,” he declared.</p>
<p>This created a problem for Roseline, as she was beginning to wonder if fulfilling her duties as a wife was also important. The couple had a responsibility to consummate their marriage and produce an heir.</p>
<p>“Hey Melchor, that duty, when are we going to do it?” Roseline asked, unable to meet Melchor’s eyes and turning her head in embarrassment.</p>
<p>In response, Melchor gave a determined look and replied, “From this moment on.”</p>
<p>Roseline’s voice rose in surprise, as she hadn’t expected it to happen so soon. She had mentally prepared herself for the night, but they hadn’t even had their wedding yet.</p>
<p>“Melchor, how about going to work?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it after I hear your answer,” he responded.</p>
<p>Although she was relieved that it wouldn’t happen immediately, Roseline’s heart was still pounding due to Melchor’s determined gaze. She wondered if it would happen tonight.</p>
<p>Melchor considered it his duty as an adult to consummate their marriage and felt that stepping back from it would be childish.</p>
<p>Roseline hesitated for a moment before reaching out to take his hand. Melchor’s mind went blank as he felt her soft hands in his.</p>
<p>“Roseline…” he breathed.</p>
<p>Although they were only holding hands, Melchor’s heart raced. Roseline was uncertain but knew she couldn’t avoid it forever. If it had to happen eventually, it wouldn’t be a huge problem if it happened a little earlier than anticipated.</p>
<p>“Okay, then tonight,” Roseline said.</p>
<p>“Tonight?” Melchor was taken aback by Roseline’s sudden proposal.</p>
<p>But Roseline’s heart was set on spending time with her beloved, and she quickly realized her mistake. She inquired about Melchor’s work schedule, wondering if he’d be stuck late at the office again.</p>
<p>Melchor, however, had a few tricks up his sleeve. With a competent 24-hour aide at his disposal, he could easily wrap up his duties and leave work early. He made a conscious effort to set aside any potential distractions and promised Roseline that he’d be there for her tonight, no matter what.</p>
<p>Melchor acknowledged that Roselaine was his first love, but now Roseline was his wife, and he was determined to be faithful to her from that moment on. He admired her strong work ethic and sense of responsibility and aimed to emulate those qualities in his own life.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>As the morning sun blazed through the window, Melchor’s unexpected visit left Roseline reeling. She sat in solitude, her mind wandering aimlessly, her fingers tingling with anticipation.</p>
<p>“Tonight…” Roseline muttered to herself, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Deborah’s voice pierced through her reverie. “Madam, don’t you like the taste of tea?”</p>
<p>It was only then that Roseline noticed the cold tea sitting in front of her.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about it for a while. I’ll drink it now,” she said, absentmindedly.</p>
<p>Deborah offered to bring a new one, but Roseline waved her off. The tea didn’t matter much to her – it was just a formality. As long as it moistened her throat, she was content. She downed the cold tea, and Deborah refilled her cup with a fresh, steaming batch.</p>
<p>“Madam, are you feeling uncomfortable?” Deborah asked, noticing the unusual expression on Roseline’s face.</p>
<p>“I’m just a little restless,” Roseline replied, her mind consumed by thoughts of Melchor.</p>
<p>He had been away from the mansion for too long, and Roseline was starting to worry. She had taken care of all the urgent documents for the estate and property management, leaving only the small details for Melchor. But even those hadn’t been handed over yet.</p>
<p>Roseline sighed and leaned back in her chair, lost in thought. Melchor was her husband. The anticipation of seeing him tonight was almost too much to bear.</p>
<p>Deborah’s words made Roseline realize that the designer was coming today. She had completely forgotten about it. The thought of trying on a wedding dress didn’t appeal to her at all.</p>
<p>“Postpone it to tomorrow,” Roseline said, rubbing her temples.</p>
<p>“Understood, ma’am,” Deborah replied, making a mental note.</p>
<p>As she sat there, lost in thought, her train of thought was interrupted by a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Come in,” Roseline said.</p>
<p>A young woman entered, carrying a large parcel wrapped in colorful paper.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Madam. This is a gift from the Empress,” the woman said, bowing.</p>
<p>Roseline’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>“The Empress?” she repeated, taking the parcel.</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam. She sent her warmest congratulations on your wedding and hopes that you will accept this gift.”</p>
<p>Roseline carefully unwrapped the package, revealing a beautiful silk dress in shades of blue and purple.</p>
<p>“It’s beautiful,” she said, admiring the craftsmanship.</p>
<p>“May I help you try it on, madam?” the woman asked.</p>
<p>“No, that won’t be necessary,” Roseline replied, setting the dress aside. “Thank you for bringing it.”</p>
<p>As the woman bowed and left, Deborah approached Roseline.</p>
<p>“Shall I prepare your tea, ma’am?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, please,” Roseline said.</p>
<p>As she waited for her tea, she couldn’t help but wonder why the Empress was sending her gifts. It seemed like a strange gesture, given the history between Melchor and the Empire.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand it,” Roseline said aloud, to no one in particular.</p>
<p>“Understand what, Madam?” Deborah asked, placing a steaming cup of tea in front of her.</p>
<p>“Why does the Empress keep sending gifts,” Roseline replied, taking a sip of her tea.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say, but perhaps she wants to extend an olive branch, madam,” Deborah suggested.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Roseline said, still uncertain. “But it feels like there’s something else going on.”</p>
<p>Deborah nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep an eye on things, madam, and if anything seems amiss, I’ll be sure to let you know.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Deborah,” Roseline said, feeling grateful for her loyal maid.</p>
<p>Roseline took a sip of black tea and put down the cold teacup, her mind racing with thoughts. She turned to Deborah and asked, “By any chance, has the designer already arrived?”</p>
<p>Deborah nodded and said, “Yes, ma’am. She has arrived and is waiting in the changing room.”</p>
<p>Roseline felt her heart race and her face flush. She couldn’t understand why the Empress was sending her a wedding gift or why she was so interested in Roseline’s wedding dress. Perhaps it was a way for the Empress to keep tabs on Melchor and his family.</p>
<p>“I see,” Roseline said, trying to hide her unease. “I’ll be there in a moment.”</p>
<p>As she stood up, Deborah reached out and gently touched her arm. “Madam, are you sure you’re feeling okay? You seem a bit off today.”</p>
<p>Roseline hesitated for a moment before replying, “I’m fine, just a bit tired. I’ll rest after the fitting.”</p>
<p>Deborah looked at her for a moment longer before nodding and saying, “Of course, madam. I’ll inform the designer that you’ll be down shortly.”</p>
<p>As Deborah turned to leave the room, Roseline couldn’t help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. She knew that she needed to be careful, especially with the Empress involved. But for now, she had to focus on getting through the fitting and ensuring that everything went smoothly.</p>
<p>Roseline took a deep breath and walked towards the bell, steeling herself for what was to come.</p>
