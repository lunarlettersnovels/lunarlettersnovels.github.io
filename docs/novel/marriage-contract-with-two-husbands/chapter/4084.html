            <p>“I’m sick of you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, lovely Wilhelmine. You’d finally forgiven your obnoxious husband.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t laugh. It all settles.”</p>
<p>The emperor approached her with his arms open as if he was going to hug her, but she turned away to avoid him. She walked over to the table and sat on her sofa. Even though it was night, the Empress’s room, like her Emperor’s audience room, was completely closed with curtains.</p>
<p>“You knew I was coming, Wilhelmine.”</p>
<p>“Why do you keep coming to see me when I tell you I’m not going to see you?”</p>
<p>“I adore you, and I can’t live without seeing you.”</p>
<p>Emperor Balthazar was well-known for casually distributing outlines that were too tingly for a middle-aged couple to share. Wilhelmine looked sadly at the older Emperor, who appeared to be twenty years her junior. With a sly smile, the Emperor sat down next to her Empress, as if he was glad she looked at him, pitiful or not.</p>
<p>“Why are you sitting so disgustingly next to me?” “Please take a seat across from me.”</p>
<p>“I inhaled a lot of night air, and my body became cold.” “I require your warmth.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, go to the other side before you’re kicked out right now.”</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>He eventually gave up and sat down on the other side after pushing the Emperor with his brows down and crying like a child.</p>
<p>“Are you still upset?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“About the Crimson Roses’ release.”</p>
<p>“Why should I be bothered by that?” “It is all your Majesty’s will.”</p>
<p>The Empress turned her head, her long sleeves covering her wrists.</p>
<p>“I apologize, Wilhelmine. I have no hope of survival if you despise me.”</p>
<p>“Hmmph.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t sleep for ten days because I couldn’t see you. “Do you see the emaciated cheeks?”</p>
<p>“I’m not seeing it.”</p>
<p>Despite her cold demeanor, the wrinkles around her mouth were slightly raised. To forgive the Emperor right away hurts her self-esteem, so it’s like telling him to say something nicer.</p>
<p>“You are my sunshine, Wilhelmine.” “I’m willing to go to any length for you, but that doesn’t make me a god.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about suddenly?”</p>
<p>“That means I can’t help you unless you tell me what you want.”</p>
<p>The Emperor’s eyes were serious, despite his playful smile.</p>
<p>“Wilhelmine, please let me know if you require anything.”</p>
<p>“That’s… … .”</p>
<p>“I exist solely to live and die with you, and I will do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>The two blood-red eyes narrowed beneath the pure white eyelashes.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Melchor left the mansion at dawn the next day. Roseline got up on time, finished her breakfast, and went to her office on the second floor. She was supposed to finish organizing the Postenmeyer family’s records, but she was unable to do so yesterday.</p>
<p>“Lady.”</p>
<p>Butler Hugo stood in front of the office. He appeared to be perplexed.</p>
<p>“The Countess of Crimson Rose desires to meet with you.”</p>
<p>“Please inform her that I do not wish to see her.”</p>
<p>“Lady…”</p>
<p>“It will be sufficient for her to remain in an annex without inconvenience.” She’ll return when the Crimson Rose mansion is completed, but staying here is preferable to staying in a hotel until then.”</p>
<p>Roseline evicted her mother from the detached house last night after a heated argument. The Postenmeyer family’s capital villa consisted of a central main building and an annex on both sides. Because of Grand Duke Postenmeyer’s grandeur, it was of course much more comfortable than the servants’ rooms of other noble families.</p>
<p>Rosaline gave her mother the uppermost room in the west annex, a guest building, and it was far from a shabby room. Because she faces west, it was an unspoken decision made with the hope that her mother, who had overslept, would be at ease.</p>
<p>“Lady, but…”</p>
<p>The butler’s voice was a little more emotional. Roseline understood what he was saying. How can she treat her mother this way after she has just returned from suffering?</p>
<p>No one said anything to themselves when I was left unattended after hearing abusive language from my parents.</p>
<p>Even the uninformed butler begins to feel uneasy when she neglects her mother.</p>
<p>It would not be a pleasant sight to see parents and children acting naturally. But telling the butler about it is a different story.</p>
<p>Because if Melchor had driven out his birth mother instead of Roseline, the butler would have waited as usual without saying anything.</p>
<p>“It goes beyond that. “Didn’t you hear there was a new servant recruitment yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, my Lady.”</p>
<p>“How come I didn’t hear you were hiring a servant for this mansion?”</p>
<p>“… Yes?”</p>
<p>Roseline walked over to the office, opened the door, and spoke without looking at the butler.</p>
<p>“Identification certificates and letters of recommendation from yesterday’s servants.” Please bring all of them.”</p>
