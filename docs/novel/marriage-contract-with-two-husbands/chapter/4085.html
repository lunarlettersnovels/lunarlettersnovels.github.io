            <p>“Wound?” Melchor was perplexed.</p>
<p>“You hurt your shoulder fighting me.”</p>
<p>“Ahh.”</p>
<p>Her sword stabbed Melchor in the left shoulder. Roseline was so engrossed in her swordplay that she entirely forgot she was fighting the Grand Duke and had hurt him.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s insignificant.”</p>
<p>“Does it make a difference?” Rosaline’s voice became icy.</p>
<p>Melchor rolled his eyes and gazed at Roseline’s side profile as if his voice had lost strength.</p>
<p><em>Did I say something incorrectly?</em></p>
<p>She stabbed his shoulder, but he was unharmed. Even if it was a major injury, Melchor’s huge stamina and resilience would not be affected.</p>
<p>Melchor spends his days in the capital if he is not fighting in a war. The injury was not a major concern because it did not interfere with his employment or daily life.</p>
<p>Melchor, on the other hand, had an irrational fear that he had spoken something incorrectly. He should have produced an apology, but he couldn’t think of anything. Furthermore, as Roseline resumed her stroll, Melchor was afraid to speak and simply followed her.</p>
<p>The night the dark sky descended was deep and calm, and the air on the ground was cold, lit only by the moonlight.</p>
<p>Roseline, you’re deafeningly quiet.</p>
<p>Roseline wanted to get some fresh air, so Melchor decided he’d follow her so she didn’t trip or get attacked by a bug while walking.</p>
<p>But he felt odd when she was walking with him in a lawn-like way.</p>
<p>Melchor appreciated calm activities but had no desire to gaze out the window. When his skin aged, he preferred to work out rather than walk; it was unusual for him to walk out at night like this.</p>
<p>Also with females.</p>
<p>Melchor, who had never even gone for a stroll, let alone dated a woman, realized his situation and was perplexed after a long walk.</p>
<p>Something… Should he speak with her? Melchor is unable to speak.</p>
<p>Roseline was dressed simply, as opposed to Melchor, who wore a cloak that covered her neck.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t it going to be cold?</em></p>
<p>Melchor tried to ask whether he might lend Roseline his coat, but his voice was muffled. This is because, having walked all the way to the center of the garden, Melchor thought it was too late to donate his coat.</p>
<p>Melchor cast a sidelong peek at Roseline’s expression, and she didn’t appear to be cold at all.</p>
<p>Melchor turned his head again and gazed straight ahead as if talking to her was an understatement.</p>
<p>Eventually, the two did not speak until they returned to the mansion after walking around the garden.</p>
<p>Rosaline, on the other hand, was unconcerned. She didn’t like talking to other people by nature, so she went for a walk without saying anything because she’d never been able to speak with Melchor.</p>
<p>The issue was on Melchor’s side.</p>
<p>Roseline, you didn’t say anything the entire walk.</p>
<p>Melchor saw her eyes were crimson. He wondered if she was upset with him because he had brought Roseline’s mother and brother in too late. Is it because he arrived home late? If not, does she feel uneasy at the palace because he waited too long to engage servants?</p>
<p>“Melchor.”</p>
<p>“ … Yes?”</p>
<p>“It’s late, let’s go in.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>Melchor agreed with a nod. He accompanied Roseline to her third-floor bedroom, said farewell to her in the hallway where her room was, and then returned to his own apartment on the second floor.</p>
<p><em>I… You had to make a mistake, didn’t you?</em> Melchor chastised himself.</p>
<p>Since the Empress’s demons have been thrown aside, the marriage vows have been accomplished, and Melchor has a reason to defend her, all fears should have vanished, but new worries have sprung in Melchor’s heart.</p>
<p>The scariest thing is the germ of misunderstanding since it has no substance.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>For ten days, the Empress had hounded the Emperor. Nonetheless, he did not give up and went to the Empress often.</p>
<p>“Williamine, are you going to open the door today?”</p>
<p>“… … .”</p>
<p>“It’s early summer, and the night air can handle it, but I’m getting old.” My stamina has significantly decreased.”</p>
<p>His appearance can be misleading. The Emperor still appears to be a youthful man in his twenties. But the Emperor was older than the Empress, who was in her forties. He was standing in front of the door with an excuse, not knowing if it was a bluff or not when he heard a click from within and the door unlocked.</p>
