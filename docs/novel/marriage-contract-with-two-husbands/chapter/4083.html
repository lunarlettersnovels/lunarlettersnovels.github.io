<p>Roseline piled up the documents of those who were not hired on one side of the desk, and the newly hired documents were spread out on the desk, and she read them carefully.</p>
<p>Even though it was said that they needed people quickly, they were actually looking for a worker for the Grand Duke of Postenmeyer. It could not be hired without a proper letter of recommendation, as well as solid identification.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s got a perfect history.”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am. I’ve been a butler to the House of Postenmeyer for over 20 years. We will never hire anyone who is not identified or without a letter of recommendation, no matter how many hands we have.”</p>
<p>“It’s reliable, but wow!”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Roseline pulled out some papers, then picked them up and handed them back to Hugo.</p>
<p>“Send back the three people here.”</p>
<p>“……What?”</p>
<p>The butler took Roseline’s documents, checked their names, and frowned.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible, ma’am. You have already signed an employment contract. They were supposed to go to work today.”</p>
<p>Instead of asking why the butler cut it off by saying ‘impossible’. Considering Roseline as his employer.</p>
<p>“With whom did you sign an employment contract?”</p>
<p>“With your family…”</p>
<p>“I am the mistress of the House of Postenmeyer.”</p>
<p>Roseline pushed aside the rest of the documents and instructed the butler.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you’re already at work. Bring in the three men from the document. I’ll terminate the contract myself.”</p>
<p>No matter how much Melchor entrusted the butler with the right to hire servants, he was only a butler. If Roseline, the hostess, objected, the recruitment contract could be blanked out at any time. As an employer, the Grand Duchess had precedence over the Grand Duke, so her orders were binding unless the Grand Duke objected.</p>
<p>The butler’s face turned pale.</p>
<p>“Madam, why? May I ask why?”</p>
<p>Roseline wishes he had asked that question from the beginning. Roseline stared at the butler for a moment and sighed quietly.</p>
<p>She took a blank sheet of paper from the desk drawer and drew a figure with a pen on it.</p>
<p>“The western branch of the Tuscan Chamber of Commerce closed in August last year and merged with the southern branch. So Axel’s history of working in the western branch until January of this year is a hoax. I can’t trust his past history because you haven’t even done a basic investigation.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Shipments connecting the port city of Wirtram and the continent are once every two weeks. However, from early May to mid-June, the ship cannot be flown because of the typhoon. “So the history of Cora from Wirtram, who came across by boat at the end of May, is also fake.”</p>
<p>Roseline then drew a large apple shape on the blank part of the paper.</p>
<p>“Raban, who was the caretaker of the Snau-Pearl Orchard on the outskirts of the capital to the west,</p>
<p>“Madam, Laban’s history is real. The Snau-Pearl Orchard has a history of dealing with our family, so we can definitely determine the authenticity.”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s real, so no.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The SnauPearl Orchard was originally from Crimson Rose. Three years ago, I was swindled by a new caretaker and taken away.”</p>
<p>The butler’s mouth was wide open.</p>
<p>“But I didn’t know you were doing business with the SnauPearl Orchard. Let’s cut off the deal. I’ll never interact with you again.”</p>
<p>Roseline, who fired the three employees, reviewed the documents of those who were not hired and made up for the three employees who were short.</p>
<p>“Hugo, contact these three.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>
<p>“And.”</p>
<p>When Roseline was added, the butler felt a little nervous.</p>
<p>“When you hire new servants in the future, make sure you come to me first and get permission.”</p>
<p>“……Yes, madam”</p>
<p>When hiring a servant, it is the butler and the housekeeper who actually review the documents and interview them. It is rare for employers to choose a person to hire themselves. Therefore, it may be said that, in fact, employers do nothing when hiring servants.</p>
<p>However, it is wrong for a butler and a housekeeper to hire servants on their own and not report a word to their employer. No matter how practically unnecessary, the principles must be kept.</p>
<p>The butler left the office with a smile on his face and the servants’ documents. Only then did Roseline feel better, which was uncomfortable.</p>
<p><em>I don’t like the way the servants work, but.</em></p>
<p>If she made a big mistake or had an accident, she couldn’t change the way employees worked just because she didn’t like it. It’s not impossible for an employer to have power, but abusing power for no good reason is the same as being a dictator. Roseline didn’t do anything wrong, but she hated bullying her opponent just because she felt bad or didn’t like it. So she decided to move on to this one.</p>
<p>Of course, Roseline moving on, she doesn’t mean she had forgotten.</p>
