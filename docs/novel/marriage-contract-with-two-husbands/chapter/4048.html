        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>Melchor didn’t anticipate a wedding or seeing Roseline in a wedding dress. His priority was to protect her, and he realized he was succeeding in doing so by keeping her within his fence. What he truly desires is not just a wedding ceremony, but a fulfilling married life with Roseline.</p>
<p>As he tries to write down his thoughts, Melchor pauses, realizing that he doesn’t want to give the impression that he only cares about having a wife rather than specifically being with Roseline. He had failed once before in expressing himself to her, and he didn’t want to risk being misunderstood again. With great care, he searched for the right words.</p>
<p><em>Be honest, be honest…</em></p>
<p>Struggling to come up with a suitable expression, Melchor furrowed his brow. He had never been skilled at pleasing ladies or writing love letters, but he knew he had to be honest with his feelings so that Roseline wouldn’t misinterpret them. After much contemplation, he slowly and deliberately wrote down each letter.</p>
<p>[I look forward to us becoming one, Roseline.]</p>
<p>Melchor contemplated the idea of a couple becoming one mind and body, realizing that for him, marriage was not just about having a wife, but about cherishing a life together with Roseline.</p>
<p>As he wrote a card to her to express his feelings, he wondered what she was thinking as she prepared for the wedding. Did she like the dress he chose? Did she eat properly? He wished he could ask her directly, but he knew it was not appropriate to do so through a card. He decided to save his questions for when they met.</p>
<p>Feeling content with the message he wrote, Melchor added a simple sentence,</p>
<p>[Let’s go home early today.]</p>
<p>and folded the card into an envelope. He sealed it with blue jewels on melted candles, and with a sense of satisfaction, he sent it off to Roseline. Even though the card did not mention anything about the wedding or the dress, Melchor felt that the message he conveyed was perfect for the moment.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Roseline’s expression stiffened as she read the card from Melchor. She was taken aback by the short and cryptic message, but after pondering over it, she felt she understood its meaning. It seemed to be a confirmation that Melchor would come home early that day, possibly to spend their first night together as a married couple.</p>
<p>Despite feeling a little embarrassed, Roseline knew that she couldn’t avoid this moment with her husband. After all, they had made a promise to marry each other. She looked at her bed and thought to herself,</p>
<p>“If it’s something you have to go through anyway, what does it matter if the time is advanced a little?”</p>
<p>Even though she felt a bit nervous, Roseline knew that this was a moment she couldn’t avoid and that she had to be properly prepared for it.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit strange to set up a new room before the wedding, Is he suggesting that he is going to sleep in my room?”</p>
<p>Traditionally, a married couple uses each other’s beds on their wedding night, so Melchor requested Roseline’s bed. Roseline felt obligated to fulfill the tradition, even if Melchor didn’t want to sleep in her room. She was used to following a given purpose rather than making her own decisions, and she quickly agreed to Melchor’s request without much thought.</p>
<p>“ Deborah, change the sheets. Melchor will be here tonight.”</p>
<p>“What? Your Highness?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’ll sleep here. No, he didn’t tell me if he was going to sleep.”</p>
<p>Roseline sighed and instructed her maid, Deborah, to change the sheets in her bed for Melchor’s arrival that evening. However, she was uncertain whether Melchor intended to stay the entire night or just for the early hours of the evening. She checked the card again and noted that the first line referred to having marital relations, but the second line was unclear. Did coming in early mean sleeping in the evening, or just arriving before it got too late?</p>
<p>“If he were going to sleep, he would have told me to prepare it separately.”’</p>
<p>Roseline assumed that Melchor intended to return to his own room after their marital duties were over, and she mentioned to him that he should have mentioned any preparations he needed for his own room. However, she misunderstood his intentions, and there was no one present to correct her assumption.</p>
<p>“What about pajamas and underwear…</p>
<p>As Deborah busily changed the sheets, Roseline wondered aloud about what pajamas and underwear Melchor would need for the evening. Deborah offered to provide new ones for her, which Roseline accepted.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Madam, may I offer you new pajamas and underwear?”</p>
<p>“No, there’s no need for new underwear. You won’t be able to wear it anyway,”</p>
<p>Roseline told Deborah when she offered to provide new underwear for the evening. Deborah and Roseline looked at each other with confusion.</p>
<p>Roseline had learned basic sexual knowledge at the academy, but she had no experience applying it. She was unsure about the appropriate preparations for the evening and had many questions on her mind. For instance, would there be blood when she first experienced sexual intercourse?</p>
<p>Should she take off her underwear or let Melchor do it? Would her delicate underwear withstand Melchor’s big hands? And, most importantly, she didn’t know anything about Melchor’s preferences or habits.</p>
<p>“I need to know something to prepare for. I don’t know anything about Melchor.’</p>
<p>She wanted to prepare properly, but general knowledge about lighting, alcohol, and lingerie didn’t apply in her case. Roseline was hesitant to ask Deborah, who was younger than her, and felt uncomfortable discussing such intimate details with the housekeeper. She also wondered if the first time would be painful and if Melchor was experienced enough to make it enjoyable for her.</p>
<p>Roseline realized that she needed more information to prepare properly for the evening. However, she didn’t know who to ask or how to approach the subject without feeling embarrassed. She also realized that her comment about Melchor being inconsiderate in bed was unfair and unfounded. She felt ashamed of herself for judging him without knowing him well. She corrected herself and said,</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t judge him like that. I don’t really know him, and it’s not fair to assume things without evidence.”</p>
<p>Deborah nodded in agreement, and Roseline continued,</p>
<p>“Anyway, just prepare clean pajamas and underwear. And could you also bring me a painkiller?”</p>
<p>Deborah looked confused and asked, “Pain pills? What’s wrong, ma’am?”</p>
<p>Roseline hesitated for a moment before admitting,</p>
<p>“I’m a little nervous, and I heard that it might hurt the first time. So, just in case, I want to be prepared.”</p>
<p>Deborah nodded in understanding and went to fetch the items.</p>
