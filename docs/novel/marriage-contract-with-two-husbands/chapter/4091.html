<p>“Your Excellency!” Heinz, who was waiting in the hallway, rushed to greet Melchor as he saw him walking out of the emperor’s office.</p>
<p>“Heinz. Have you confirmed the temporary residence of the Black Knights and organized the budget?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Am I not a competent aide, Your Excellency?”</p>
<p>“Whenever you say that you miss a few things.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on,” grinned Heinz. He swept his hand across his hair, disheveling his neat blond hair. Heinz had an innocent yet sheepish beauty that invoked affection from men and women alike, and he knew how to use it.</p>
<p>Melchor didn’t care. He looked indifferent. Heinz looked at him and sighed. It was hard to have a boss who was so unaffected by his fatal charm.</p>
<p>“By the way, My Lord. When do you intend to return to the east?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>The territory of the Grand Duchy of Postenmeyer was not only the capital but the whole of the eastern territories.</p>
<p>The capital’s villa was as large as a noble’s house, but Heinz preferred the mansion of the Postenmeyer family, which controlled a vast territory. If Melchor stayed in his hometown, it was only because it was close to the Eastern Knights. And commuting would be convenient.</p>
<p>The central knights of the capital had accommodations for the Black Knights when Melchor visited the capital. But Melchor never stayed much in the capital. He didn’t prefer the environment there and there were so many minor conflicts with the Emperor’s Red Knights.</p>
<p><em>Besides, there are a lot of sweaty guys in the Red Knights. </em>If he was a knight, Heinz would just sneak out and sleep at an inn making excuses. But as the Grand Duke’s assistant, he had to set an example. He could not leave the Knights’ quarters without a valid reason.</p>
<p>“When will the Countess of Crimson Rose and her son arrive?” asked Melchor.</p>
<p>“We received a report that they were being taken to the mansion today. After making sure they are safe, will you leave immediately?”</p>
<p>Melchor was considering that. While the Crimson Rose Mansion was being rebuilt, his mansion in the capital was handed over to Roseline’s mother and brother for the present. Melchor planned to return to the east with Roseline. He had ordered Hugo to hire servants for Roseline’s family.</p>
<p><em>Roseline will want to spend some time with her family, </em>thought Melchor.</p>
<p>Melchor himself had long lost his family, so he didn’t really feel any attachments. But he was worried about Roseline’s family. Melchor wanted to be considerate towards Roseline.</p>
<p><em>Even if the wedding ceremony is small and informal, it would be better to have a family present.</em></p>
<p>It didn’t matter if they were branded as the ‘emperor couple’ just because the emperor approved the marriage, it might be a good idea to put up a good front. Melchor made up his mind.</p>
<p>“Heinz. Extend the period of stay.”</p>
<p>Heinz’s face darkened. “By how much?”</p>
<p>Melchor stroked his chin, thinking. He then put up two fingers.</p>
<p>“Two more days? I will contact the staff and…”</p>
<p>“Not two days…”</p>
<p>“Two weeks then? To be honest that’s a bit…”</p>
<p>“No.” Melchor shook his head.</p>
<p>Heinz’s eyes widened. “Please, Excellency!  You don’t mean…”</p>
<p>“Two months.”</p>
<p>“No! Benjamin!” cried Heinz in agony.</p>
<p>“Benjamin?” asked Melchor in confusion.</p>
<p>“My sweetheart whom I left behind in the East!”</p>
<p>“Uh, you mean ‘that’…” Melchor rolled his eyes. Then he nodded. “Just two months, Heinz. Someone else will take good care of your lover till then.”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency! I haven’t seen Benjamin for almost half a month now! What if I am away too long and someone else takes her away?”</p>
<p>“Like who?”</p>
<p>“You are the only one who doesn’t see Benjamin’s loveliness! If she breaks up with me because I neglected her, I will file a worker’s compensation claim!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure it is still there?”</p>
<p>“How can you say that? We are spiritually connected!”</p>
<p>Benjamin was the name of the rubber tree that Heinz had grown at the Knights Templar.</p>
<p>“Being connected with a plant? You are greater than His Majesty in that sense, Heinz.”</p>
<p>“Benjamin likes the water I give her the most. She must be missing me and dying with agony…”</p>
<p>“That will never happen.”</p>
<p>“What? No! It might!”</p>
<p>Heinz pressed the corner of his eyes, squeezing out tears. “Why can’t I marry a plant? My Benjamin with small hands and feet…”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t really have hands or feet.”</p>
<p>“That’s because it is small. You can’t see it just like that. I see it in my heart.”</p>
<p>“I am just saying there is no such thing,” said Melchor, patting a sobbing Heinz on the back. He then walked to his office.</p>
<p>Heinz muttered Benjamin’s name a few more times and followed.</p>
