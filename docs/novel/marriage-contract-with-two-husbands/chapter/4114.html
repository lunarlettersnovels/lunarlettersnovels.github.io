<p>Roseline’s swordsmanship was not meant to defeat the enemy and gain victory, but only to defend herself. It was quite accurate to say that she had used a broom to sweep dust in the hallway.</p>
<p>“Roseline, did you ever receive a knighthood, or have you ever participated in an official swordsmanship contest? Even if you took swordsmanship classes at the Academy, it makes no sense to figh with such skills against elite knights.”</p>
<p>“But it is true,” insisted Roseline.</p>
<p>“Those who haven’t seen it won’t believe it. There will be no charges against you since it will be concluded that several of the Knights of the Blue Cloak were injured because of other accidents.”</p>
<p>Her father’s gambling allegations resulted in their entire family being branded as criminals. Pleading that she was unaware of it all would simply be impossible—nobody would believe her.</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me, Your Highness, do you?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“I asked if you didn’t believe in my ability to neutralize the twenty elite members of the Blue Knights. You said people who haven’t seen it won’t believe it.”</p>
<p>“Well, it wasn’t a sloppy cut. The knights’ wounds were so accurate and clean. It’d be difficult to achieve such precision even for experienced knights. Even with three swords.”</p>
<p>“Is it difficult even for you, Grand Duke?”</p>
<p>The Grand Duke raised his head at her provocative question. As their eyes met, Roseline could glimpse the twirling flames in his icy gaze.</p>
<p>“Roseline, do you want additional charges in your case?”</p>
<p>Despite his threatening remark, Roseline stared straight at him, unwavering. “It’s not a crime because I only defended myself, but if what I did offended Her Majesty, I shall apologize.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a very wise decision.”</p>
<p>“I will take responsibility for what I have done, but I will plead innocence for what I did not do. I’ll be sure to tell them in court. My father had never told me about his illegal affairs.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a very wise decision either.”</p>
<p>“Is it so because I have no evidence to convince the judge?” asked Roseline.</p>
<p>“No, it is because there is no trial.”</p>
<p>Wasn’t she supposed to go to trial because she had been charged? Roseline, unable to understand the Grand Duke’s words, tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Roseline, do you know why the Knights Templar moved?”</p>
<p>“Evidence came out that my father was a gambler, and my family was also accused of it.”</p>
<p>“Evidence of gambling has emerged, so why are the Queen’s Knights moving?”</p>
<p>“Gambling by aristocrats is a felony equivalent to treason. Of course, the Emperor must have also reported it, right?”</p>
<p>Just as the Grand Duke possessed the Knights of Black Cloak and the Empress the Knights of Blue Cloak, the Emperor owned the Knights of the Red Cloak. At the Emperor’s command, the Knights of the Red Cloak moved.</p>
<p>However, the Queen’s Knights had been the first.</p>
<p>“I know that even the Empress cannot move the Knights Templar without the Emperor’s approval. His Majesty the Emperor should also agree,” added Roseline.</p>
<p>“Agreeing means that the other party made the offer first, right?”</p>
<p>Even if the report was delivered to the Empress first, the decision lay with the Emperor. The illegal affairs of her father were far from urgent, but the fact that the Empress acted on it and asked the Emperor for consent only meant that the Empress had a reason to handle the matter herself.</p>
<p>The Crimson Roses were incomparable to the Imperial family. Whatever his father did, it shall not pose any threat to Her Majesty the Empress. Why would she have to send her own knights to ruin their mansion?</p>
<p>Thinking that far, Roseline suddenly realized that there was something wrong.</p>
<p><em>The Blue Knights ransacked the mansion. Why?</em></p>
<p>What was their reason for their peculiar behavior? They had smashed the mirrors,  overturned carpets, opened drawers, and searched all rooms. For what? Their actions indicated that they were looking for something.</p>
<p>Did Roseline’s father hide something? Are they trying to find evidence of his gambling? No, they said they had already found evidence of it.</p>
<p>So, what did the Blue Knights scour the mansion for?</p>
<p>“Roseline, Is there anything you’d like to point out?” Melchor asked, interrupting her train of speculations.</p>
<p>Roseline shook her head, “No, no. I have none.”</p>
<p>“Then think about it. I will think about it myself as well.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The Grand Duke rose from his seat, ignoring Roseline’s confusion, and walked to the door.</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about going to visit her Majesty the Empress until you think about it.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Let’s unravel the mystery.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>After the interrogation—or so-called “interrogation”—Melchor’s assistant, Heinz, appeared in front of him. He, who usually wore a bright expression in front of others, approached him with a solemn expression and whispered in a small voice.</p>
<p>“The Empress’s younger brother, Count Wigelhofen, has come to visit.”</p>
<p>Melchor’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p><em>This was what I was aiming for after all.</em></p>
