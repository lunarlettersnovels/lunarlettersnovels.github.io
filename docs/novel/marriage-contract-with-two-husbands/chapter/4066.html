            <p>Roseline poked her head out of the cave and looked around, sensing that the footsteps</p>
<p>had vanished. There was no one there.</p>
<p>“You can come out now, Julian.”</p>
<p>“…… thank you.”</p>
<p>Julian paused before emerging, holding Roseline’s hand. Her ears were red, indicating that she was embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Who were you looking for?”</p>
<p>“Before…… ”</p>
<p>Julian had already been bullied by his classmates. He overheard something about stealing exam papers.</p>
<p>“No. I just happened to run into some of my former classmates.”</p>
<p>“… … .”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your assistance, Roseline. Then I’ll go back to the academy.”</p>
<p>Julian turned around and nodded to Roseline.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>His standing posture was straight, so she didn’t notice, but when he moved his steps, he leaned slightly to the left, which seemed to hurt his right leg.</p>
<p>“Wait, Julian.”</p>
<p>Roseline approached and supported Julian by grabbing his shoulders. The boy stares at her, his eyes are wide open in surprise.</p>
<p>“Did you injure your right leg, Yulian?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You have poor walking posture.”</p>
<p>Julian’s blue eyes moved around as if he were embarrassed, and Roseline was right to point out that he lowered his gaze a little.</p>
<p>“It’s perfectly fine. I can return on my own.”</p>
<p>“Where do you live?” If you continue to walk with an uncomfortable leg, the injured part may swell and you may be unable to walk the next day.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already been helped twice, and I can’t keep being a bother.”</p>
<p>Julian shook his head and gently pushed Roseline away.</p>
<p>“Because I don’t even know how to repay the favor.”</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about repaying favors in public. Adults have a natural duty to protect children, and children have the right to be protected.”</p>
<p>“You’re not an adult<em>,”</em> he says. Her ears were hot from embarrassment even after she had talked about it.</p>
<p>Isn’t Roseline a minor with a birthday that hasn’t yet passed?</p>
<p>Roseline was sincere, even if she inadvertently said something embarrassing. She recalls that she had previously stated that she was an academy senior. That means she is only 14 or 15 years old.</p>
<p><em>Julian, I’m wondering if my pride was harmed.</em></p>
<p>She looked into Julian’s eyes, but the boy remained motionless with his head slightly lowered, not responding. He didn’t appear to be offended.</p>
<p>“Julian, I’ll start with the injured area.”</p>
<p>He sat on the floor this time, as Roseline had requested. His right ankle had been sprained and swollen slightly.</p>
<p>“You’d prefer not to move.”</p>
<p>Roseline splinted a twig with her handkerchief and wrapped it tightly around her ankle.</p>
<p>“It’s not a serious sprain, so if you don’t walk for a long time and apply ice, it should heal in two or three days.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please.”</p>
<p>It was a very slender ankle. Deborah was starving and felt very thin as a result of her inability to eat, but Julian’s pale skin and thin body made him appear sickly.</p>
<p>“Is there anywhere else where it hurts?”</p>
<p>“No, there isn’t.”</p>
<p>Roseline asked in a calm voice, having calmed herself down after hearing Julian’s firm response.</p>
<p>“Julian, are your classmates threatening you?”</p>
<p>“I have to figure it out on my own.”</p>
<p>“How are you going to deal with it?” Will you be beaten if I threaten you violently like this? ”</p>
<p>“If I tell the professor about what happened today…”</p>
<p>“Do you think it’ll work?”</p>
<p>Julian was unable to respond to Roseline’s question.</p>
<p>There will be no countermeasures, even if you consult with the professor.</p>
<p>The only violence exchanged occurred during the process of asking Julian to bring the answer sheet, and the actual cheating was not caught, making it difficult for the academy’s upper level to punish him.</p>
<p>Only Julian may be misunderstood as a liar if they band together and falsely testify.</p>
<p>“There’s no other option, even if it doesn’t work out.”</p>
<p>There was almost no way for the weak to confront the majority of the strong. It was only natural that he would be unable to fight on his own without the mercy of the stronger.</p>
<p>“It’s insignificant.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Julian, you can take advantage of it if your classmates look down on you and bully you.”</p>
<p>Underestimating an opponent implies being careless.</p>
<p>In a game with a large difference in skill, it is difficult to defeat a strong player who is serious about winning, but it is not so difficult to defeat a strong player who is careless.</p>
<p>The bigger the difference in power, the more overconfident the opponent will be in their own skills. Even if you are careless, you are confident that you will not be taken in by your opponent’s weakness.</p>
<p>It’s understandable that she doesn’t believe she’ll be able to pass on her own strength.</p>
<p>“Those who use their power well, not those who are strong, win a fight.”</p>
