            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she turned around, there was a man standing across the stream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the man’s appearance was unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t exactly what it appeared to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is your name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She addressed him, but he did not respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s peculiar…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline had no idea what a man looked like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stream is just a few steps away. A man stands directly across from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline couldn’t tell if the man standing across the stream was tall or short, fat or slim, young or old, or what kind of clothes he was wearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t think it was strangely dangerous, even though it was obvious that he was the type of person who couldn’t tell his appearance from a distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t feel like attacking this side from a man’s perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because this is a park, it could be someone who went for a walk in the park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline was even under the ridiculous impression that she was tired and unable to distinguish the other person’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I apologize, Roseline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Julian?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe it is because of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julian said he was sorry to Roseline, but Roseline didn’t understand why the boy was sorry to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, I’m lost.” “Would you mind taking me with you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man on the other side of the stream inquired. The voice was both high and low in pitch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julian spoke up just as Roseline was about to respond to her invitation to come over here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We take different paths. “I’m not sure where you’re going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that correct?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a short moment of silence for Julian and Roseline, the man turned around and went into the forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, it’s not correct to say that I went in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man walked through the woods, returned to the stream, and asked Julian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I got lost.” “Oh, would you mind taking me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, it was unclear whether the man’s voice was high or low. However, the sound seemed a little louder and clearer. Even though the horse was stuttering more than usual, it was strange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline was possessed and touched her temple. Julian put his hand on Roseline’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry, Roseline. “It is not hazardous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? It isn’t that… “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julian stroked Roseline’s hand again and said to the man,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We take different paths. “I’m not sure where you’re going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man took a step back, hid among the trees, and spun around the tree. Roseline was horrified by what she saw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That isn’t a living being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it a spirit?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline had no faith in ghosts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a man dies, his body is buried in the earth, and his soul ascends to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cathedral priests have stated that in heaven, they are judged by God for their karma during their lifetime and either go to heaven or hell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline didn’t particularly believe in God, but she didn’t deny it either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was certain, however, that he had never seen a ghost in his life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because she believed that if there was a god with character, she would not have allowed her life to go so far, and that if there was a ghost, the person who was wrongfully killed would not leave the criminal alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she can only think of a man as a non-human being who emits a strange energy across the stream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will the man be a ghost who died in this forest because there is no sorcerer in this empire?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julian shook his head and stood up as Roseline tried to protect him from a ghostly man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Julian stood up, the man who had been circling the tree returned to the stream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gi, gi, gi, gi, gi, gi, gi!” “Sweep!” says Gi gi gi. Sseup!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, a voice could be heard shouting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please take me!” Please take me with you! I’m not going to, Ni, Nia!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline hurriedly closed her mouth, fearful of answering yes inadvertently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her heart pounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julian calmly responded to the man across the stream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We take different paths. “I’m not sure where you’re going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That, that, that, that, that!” That! I’m, uh, where am I? Where! “Where, where, where!” Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.</span></p>
