            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lady Crimson Rose. How far have you been briefed?” Heinz asked, also confused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline muttered, “I didn’t hear anything. No explanation whatsoever…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, my.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heinz felt sorry for Roseline, whose embarrassment for her obliviousness was evident. But it was also difficult for Heinz to come forward and talk if the Grand Duke hadn’t explained to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First of all, there are two things I can tell you,” Heinz began, “one is that Lady Crimson Rose was brought here by the Grand Duke for your protection.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that they are going against the Empress</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Roseline’s expression became serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The other is,” Heinz paused, “His Excellency needs your help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseline was puzzled. She didn’t know why he needed her to the point that he would defy the Empress’s orders. What was so important that he had to do this? But Roseline didn’t know anything that might benefit the Duke.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If she couldn’t give what the Duke desired, she might be discarded to the Blue Knights later on. Roseline could already see the worst thing that could happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What should I do?” she mumbled to herself dejectedly, “there is nothing I could do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You must have had a hard time coming in the carriage, so you’d better take a rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Roseline faced Heinz, her worries seemed to fade away. She decided to remain quiet, believing that asking more questions would not solve her curiosity. She ought to speak with the Grand Duke himself.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’ll come again tomorrow for an interrogation, right?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But rarely do things go the way people want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Melchor, oh, Grand Duke of Postenmeyer!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the door of the drawing-room on the first floor opened, a dark silhouette appeared and a short, fat man jumped out of his seat and approached Melchor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You may call me whatever makes you at ease, Count Wiegelhoffen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Count Rainer Mostri Wiegelhofen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The younger brother of Empress Wilhelmine, a greedy figure who constantly uses his sister’s power to satisfy his own interests. Unfortunately, his power was insignificant compared to his greed. It was also rumored that the Empress covered up all the accidents he had caused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Count was unable to meet Melchor in the eye, causing the Duke to laugh at his nervousness. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Count Wiegelhofen had a small physique, while Melchor was of considerable stature. His mere presence would undeniably intimidate the feeble Count. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, my. I’m sorry to barge in without an appointment. It’s such an urgent matter,” the Count rambled as he fidgeted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since you came all of a sudden, I thought there was a reason for that,” replied Melchor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad you understand. Then, let’s sit down and talk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure. I’ll have the tea ready.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh,” the Count chuckled nervously, “excuse me then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Melchor beckoned, Count Wiegelhofen sat on the sofa, wiping the sweat that trickled down his fat chin. When Melchor sat across from him, the butler named Hugo served the tea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well,” the Count coughed, eyeing the butler, “Duke of Melchor, would you please tell the butler to step aside?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hugo is a faithful butler. He’s not going to move anywhere from here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, still. I want to talk to the Duke of Melchor alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Melchor beckoned, Hugo politely bowed his head and left the drawing-room, closing the door carefully behind his back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afternoon sunshine enveloped the spacious room along with the strong scent of tea. But in spite of this serene and warm scene, Count Wiegelhofen, as he faced Melchor, felt as if an eclipse had happened. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He felt frightened as the Grand Duke’s icy glare pierced his soul. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He even believed that the man in front of him wasn’t actually a human, but a human-eating beast or a demon of hell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Count Wiegelhofen felt a chill in his back and a cold sweat running down his cheeks even when he avoided his gaze. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He puffed and wiped off his sweat with his damp palms, gulped down his tea like cold water, and put it down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was quite hot to drink at once, but Count Wiegelhofen was not in a condition to feel the temperature of the tea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He began, trying his best not to stutter, “The Duke of Melchor. I hear you’re protecting Count Crimson Rose’s daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, Count Wiegelhofen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Count of Crimson Rose has already lost his title and territory, which makes his daughter also the daughter of a sinner. I don’t think there’s any need for interrogation because the crime of the family is crystal clear. Hence, I’d like you to hand over Roseline Crimson Rose and her personal belongings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melchor stared straight into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Count Wiegelhofen, a smirk playing on his lips. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a rude fellow. </span></i></p>
