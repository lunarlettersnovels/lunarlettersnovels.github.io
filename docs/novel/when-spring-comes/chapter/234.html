            <p><b>Chapter 3 – First Heartbreak</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eh? Why does something feel off?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overcome by curiosity, Hua Chun slipped a hand into her robes and groped around, the findings making her lips twitch. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This… Wasn’t there supposed to be something more for a man? Why does this body feel no different from my own?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hua Chun wondered, her brow furrowing in confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring the pain radiating from her bottom, Hua Chun forced herself up, and glanced down at her own clothes, at her chest. It was flat, but as soon as she inhaled, she noticed that there was something wrapped tightly around her chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Prime Minister… was a woman?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stunned, Hua Chun sat in silence until tears leaked from the corners of her eyes, her bottom lip trembling as she abruptly moved to cover her face. With that, Hua Chun cried as if she had lost the love of her life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, her first heartbreak!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t easy — not at all! To think, a man so handsome turned out to be</span><b>… </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A woman! What kind of cosmic evil force had she encountered? She thought God’s mercy granted her a chance to understand men up close, but she didn’t expect it to be such bizarre transmigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had passed through, right? She had transmigrated into the TV series. So, she had thought: was she going to become the Prime Minister or something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, Hua Chun often read transmigration novels and fantasized about what would happen if she experienced it one day. But she always imagined that it would follow the plot of a beautiful girl meeting an overbearing president. Never in her life had she imagined that she would become a man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing made sense. Everything was happening too fast. What kind of transmigration has transpired? A BL?! But that made little sense… She was a woman!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t even know the end of the story. Was it a tragedy? And if yes, as one of the leading characters, would she have to be punished or hanged?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frowning, Hua Chun turned her attention to her severely beaten derriere, a million and one thoughts still rampaging along inside her mind. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Tsk…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the medicine she took, the pain should have gone away by now. But… Why was it still burning? Indeed, the Emperor was just as ruthless, shameless, and unreasonable as when he appeared in the first episode! The prime minister only advised the emperor to pay less attention to the harem in the court hall and be less addicted to opera. But, as a result, they beat her to death. Was there any justice at all?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Argh!’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun was a loyal fan of Prime Minister Hua and was determined to follow his fine style and never bow to evil forces, even if it meant being killed… ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait… if they had beaten her to death again, maybe she would have gone back?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that thought, Hua Chun’s mouth formed into a thin line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe… As if!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To comfort herself, Hua Chun wrapped her arms around her own body for a quick embrace before moving to lie back down, intent on going back to sleep on her stomach for a while. After all, it really was too painful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before she could close her eyes, a servant was outside the door knocking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Young Master! The emperor … His Majesty is here!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun was shocked. The person who ordered others to beat her to death had come to see her? Where was the good news in that? The emperor… Why did he seem to have such a weird character? Coupled with his facial paralysis and rebellious attitude, she really had no clue. They were about the same age, but he was much worse than Prime Minister Hua.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a frown, Hua Chun immediately lay down, turned her head away, closed her eyes, and pretended to be asleep. After all, she was a narrow-minded person. After being brutally beaten to the point that she could barely walk, she had lost all affection for the emperor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite not responding, after a few moments, the door swung open, and Yu Wenjie stepped inside the room with an expressionless face. He was dressed in silver, but the dark lines of the dragon embroidered on his robe still looked vicious. Coupled with his imposing tall figure, Hua Chun felt chilled by his presence, even with her eyes closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Didn’t you say he was awake?” A low voice sounded by her bedside. At that sound, Hua Chun forced herself to stay calm, concentrating on slowing her breathing and making it look natural.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little servant girl, Pin Tan, looked anxiously at Hua Chun on the bed and could not help but reach out and grab her arm and try to wake her up: “Young Master, wake up!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun didn’t respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Emperor, Yu Wenjie, looked down at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pin Tan gritted her teeth and tried harder, “Young Master!” With this strength, Hua Chun almost fell out of bed. With that kind of force, how was she able to continue pretending?</span></p>
