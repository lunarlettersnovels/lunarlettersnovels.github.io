            <p><b>Chapter 23 – Can Only Accept Reality (2)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While everyone was eating, Hua Chun silently looked at the faces of these people. Some of them appeared in the first episode, and some were new faces, whose identities could only be determined by guessing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua’s bloodlines were genetically good. Heroic, but very delicate. The two little sisters seated with their mothers looked lovely as well, and they were bound to be betrothed in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s just that the ten-year-old kid, Hua Xianyu, seems to be at odds with her. For quite some time now, the kid had glanced at her a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the aunts seemed to have lowered eyebrows, which looked as if they couldn’t find anything temporarily. But, there is one, Aunt Fu, who looked a lot like Yi Fei in an old TV series. But she was not as gentle as Yi Fei; Aunt Fu had a lot of arrogance in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the same roof with this person, it was no wonder that Wan-shi could not control her fierce temper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Wan-shi finished her meal and left, she pulled Hua Chun away quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mother, my bottom hurts!” Hua Chun couldn’t help but howl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowing down, Wan-shi looked back sadly and said, “What can I do? I’m going to be bullied by that cheap, evil woman!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didn’t know if she would laugh or cry, Hua Chun looked back and found that only Pin Tan and her mother’s servant girl were following them. Thus, she took the opportunity to lean in and whisper to Wan-shi. “You are too anxious and angry, and that is why you’re easily trapped in Aunt Fu’s wicked plans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I pay so much attention to her!” Wan-shi immediately rebutted in a low, indignant tone. “I’m happy to see her unhappy, and if she’s happy, I’ll be furious!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What’s wrong with that?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hua Chun twitched the corner of her mouth and pulled her away. “You can’t always count on others to live. Your life is yours. Just let go and let Aunt Fu be. With her character, there will be no happy ending for her in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh?” Ignoring the first half of her words, Wan-shi asked curiously, “Why won’t she have a happy ending?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun looked at her helplessly. If she could only let her mother see some palace fighting drama, then she would have. Why can’t her mother open her mind to all these possibilities?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You just wait. If there is no peace in this house, a mistake made by Aunt Fu just now will be enough to implicate Senior Concubine Hua.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mistake?” Wan-shi was confused.”What mistake can Aunt Fu make? Didn’t she just fight with me? Did you see how she acted? Master Hua is used to it and won’t even care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright!” Hua Chun couldn’t bear to push her forward. “Don’t ask. Let’s just go back and rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the afternoon, Hua Chun will go back to the palace for discussion, so she wanted to nap while there was still time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan-shi was stunned; her back was pushed forward by Hua Chun’s hands. What transpired today turned out to be the same as when Hua Chun was a child, still pushing her away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was some sorrow in her heart. Wan-shi’s lips were pursed, and her eyes turned red as a little drop of tears fell down from it. Feeling the little hands behind her, she didn’t want to ask anymore. She just took steps back to the small yard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon sorting out the relationship between these prominent families, Hua Chun had a good rest for a while. She felt better and more energetic. Although her buttocks were still sore, the third plaster has not hindered her from walking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that she has come to this entirely different world, she decided to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people here are all alive. There is no camera or director, so she would just be here to live on behalf of others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life here may be much more thrilling and exciting than her boring modern life.</span></p>
