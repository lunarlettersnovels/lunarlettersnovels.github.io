            <p><strong>Chapter 57 – Mischievous Antic (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Brother,” the prime minister whispered to him. “Do you know? It’s pretty useless to put a knife against my neck. You won’t be able to scare them.”</p>
<p>“What?” The man was taken aback.</p>
<p>“A knife in the neck may still save me, after all. The correct kidnapping posture should be to aim the knife at my heart.” Hua Chun said solemnly, and then reached out and grabbed the man. With her own hand, she pointed the dagger right at her heart: “That’s right, understand?”</p>
<p><em>’What tricks?’ </em>The man was at a loss, but it made sense to think about what she said. Some people saved their lives by cutting their throats, but never heard that they could survive with a knife.</p>
<p>Being momentarily distracted, he put the knife in the Prime Minister’s heart and continued to think of a solution. All the while, Chang’an and Yu Wenjie both continued to pay attention to the movements happening here, and after they managed to beat the remaining assassins one by one, they finally had time to look back towards them.</p>
<p>Assassins trying to escape downstairs would soon be caught by the guards surrounding them, so they wouldn’t need to worry about the rest. The only thing to worry about now was this useless prime minister.</p>
<p>“You can’t escape.” Yu Wenjie looked at the person coldly. “Let go of him.”</p>
<p>At this, the man behind Hua Chun took a few steps back, his expression flustered, and turned his head to see what the scene was downstairs. Taking advantage of this moment, Hua Chun pulled out his right hand, pinched him sharply, and decided she would try to snatch the knife from his hand.</p>
<p>“Ah!” The screams resounded throughout the restaurant, and the man automatically hurt her sore spot. He then grabbed her tightly and stabbed her in the chest!</p>
<p>“Are you stupid?!” Yu Wenjie opened his eyes wide, the anxious expression evident on his face for the first time. ‘<em>When someone gets caught, he should wait for someone to find a way to save him. What the heck was he thinking?!’</em></p>
<p>He Chang’an acted almost immediately, wanting to go up to save the person, but the distance proved to be too far. Even if he had managed to catch the person’s wrist, the blade would still enter Hua Jinghua’s heart.</p>
<p>Taking a breath, he slammed the man away and looked at Hua Jinghua with wide eyes. The picture seemed to slow down suddenly, and a trace of pain flashed between Hua Chun’s delicate eyebrows. She then looked at him with a palpable tenderness now evident in her eyes.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie frowned.</p>
<p>He had heard the harsh sound of the dagger landing, and saw Hua Jinghua’s slowly rotating body. For a moment, he suddenly felt that He Chang’an was right. Hua Jinghua was really beautiful. Her eyes were clear and gentle, much like a jade rabbit.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the emperor found that he didn’t hate her that much. However, now, did that realization seem to be too late?</p>
<p>Hua Chun grasped at the knife in her heart, slowly, slowly… and fell onto the bench that was right next to her.</p>
<p>“Jinghua!” He Chang’an went over and held her in his arms, a sad expression taking over his face. Could the brothers who had just gotten worshipped make heaven and man separated forever? Why was God so cruel?</p>
<p>“I… It’s okay.” Hua Chun looked at him weakly, and then at the emperor. “You are fine.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie pursed his lips, walked over to look at him a few steps, and sighed after hesitating for a long time.</p>
<p>“You are a good prime minister, and I am not a good emperor.”</p>
<p>“The emperor shouldn’t say that… You are a very good leader.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie shook his head and closed his eyes. “I know my own temper. I have wronged you many times.” ’<em>It’s just that I can’t admit my mistake.’</em></p>
<p>“This minister is very pleased.” Hua Chun continued to laugh weakly. “Our emperor is a good one. Even if there is no minister in the future, he will definitely be able to give a prosperous rule.”</p>
<p>He Chang’an sighed. “You’re fatally wounded, and that is all you can still think about?”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing else to worry about.” Hua Chun closed her eyes, stretched out her hand in the direction of the emperor, and then said authentically. “The emperor is the heaven of the officials, and the heaven of the people…” At this, the Prime Minister’s voice trailed off. The hand that had been suspended mid-air now dropped.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie was startled, quickly reaching out to grab her hand, and whispered harshly, “Prime Minister Hua!”</p>
<p>He Chang’an’s sadness only grew even further upon witnessing this scene. However, before he could indulge in his negative emotions even further, the person in his arms opened her eyes.</p>
<p>“The Minister is here!”</p>
<p>He Chang’an fell into stunned silence. The sadness on Yu Wenjie’s face was all but frozen, and he squinted his eyes when he looked at the resurrected man with a knife still stuck in his chest. ‘<em>Was this a stunt?’</em></p>
<p>“I’m not kidding you anymore.” Hua Chun smiled and stretched out the dagger, and then took out the bronze mirror in her arms. The back of the hard bronze mirror turned out to be the one pierced by a dagger. This thing was not an imaginary metal or stone, but a strange mixture of scum. No wonder it had been sold so cheaply.</p>
<p>“I’m not that stupid. I wouldn’t dare to take any chances if I didn’t know this thing was in my arms.” Hua Chun smiled and looked at the two people in front of her. “How about it? I’m pretty great, right?”</p>
<p>Upon listening to her brief explanation, He Chang’an felt dazed for a long time, and held the mirror in his arms. Meanwhile, Yu Wenjie, who stood still right next to them, took back all the expressions on his face, stretched out his hand, and carried Hua Chun up without saying a single word.</p>
<p>“Hey?” Hua Chun was startled. “Er, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Striding over to the window sill, Yu Wenjie was about to throw her out without hesitation! It was apparent that he did not appreciate the cruel trick. The point was that he had really been fooled, and he found that fact intolerable.</p>
<p>At the moment when he was about to be thrown away, Hua Chun ‘s hair now exploded all over, and she hurriedly wrapped her arms around the emperor like an octopus, with her legs between his waist, and her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>“Second Lord, please!”</p>
<p>At this, the irresistibly delicate skin on his neck rubbed against his body, and Yu Wenjie turned black again.<br>
