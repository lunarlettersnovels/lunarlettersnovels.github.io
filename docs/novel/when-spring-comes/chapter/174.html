            <p><strong>Chapter 63 – Plotting Marriage (2)</strong></p>
<p>The trip turned out to be beneficial for only Hua Chun. When he took Qing Niao out of Tianxiang Pavilion, Hua Chun was still very happy, thanking He Chang’an repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Little things, little things.” He Chang’an glanced at Qing Niao. “I hope this girl can take care of you.”</p>
<p>Qing Niao then responded in a low voice, and followed Hua Chun obediently.</p>
<p>Wenjie glanced at the two of them, frowning slightly. “Chang’an, let me go back, Jinghua will go home by himself.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Hua Chun bowed deeply, not giving his words much thought. After all, she had brought a maid with her, so she couldn’t possibly follow him. At this, He Chang’an got into the carriage with the emperor, and the carriage quickly started moving.</p>
<p>“Do you really think Hua Jinghua is weird?” After a brief silence, the emperor asked again.</p>
<p>Touching his chin, He Chang’an took his time with his reply. “What’s strange about him?”</p>
<p>“I feel like he is too soft, like milk.” Yu Wenjie wrinkled his nose in disgust.</p>
<p>“Huh?” He Chang’an looked at him in disbelief. “Why do you say that? Jinghua is a scholar, not a warrior. Sure, he might be a little too thin, giving him a gentle demeanor, but why would you compare him to milk?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this question, the emperor pursed his lips. He couldn’t say that Hua Chun smelled like milk the night he squatted on the beam–He Chang’an would just call him a pervert! However, even if Hua Jinghua looked like that, he still couldn’t help but wonder… Did the prime minister get possessed by some kind of female ghost?</p>
<p>After pondering for a while, the emperor finally spoke once more. “Let someone go find a monk. Have him enter the palace and talk to me about Buddhism.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Although he didn’t understand what Yu Wenjie was planning to do, He Chang’an still agreed.</p>
<p>The emperor, who had finally finished his work, seemed extremely relaxed, so he began to prepare for his next mishap with Hua Jinghua. Hua Chun could feel this, and when she took Qing Niao back to Huafu, she discovered that her clothes were wet from sweat.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with that girl?” When Wan-shi received the news, she came to the yard to look for her. “Where did it come from?”</p>
<p>Hua Chun then responded with a serious expression, “That’s the woman He Chang’an gave to me.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Wan-shi cried for a moment, then panicked: “This… you… what have you done?”</p>
<p>The reason why the master had been preventing him from marrying Jinghua was because she was afraid of revealing her identity. She was a woman, after all. How could she marry another woman? This would definitely cause the Hua family’s secret to get exposed!</p>
<p>“Mother, don’t worry.” Seeing her in such a panicked state, Hua Chun quickly calmed her down. “What can I do?”</p>
<p>Wan-shi shook her head, “This is the person sent by Gong Yuhou. You can’t do anything about it.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, that’s right.” Hua Chun nodded. “Let’s just say that Mingzhong is getting married. What do you think?”</p>
<p><em>’What?’ </em>Wan-shi froze and looked at her blankly. Wasn’t this just Hua Chun looking for death?</p>
<p>“The emperor has already begun to doubt me.” Hua Chun shrugged. “There is no other way around this, but to marry right away.”</p>
<p>At this, Wan-shi paled, shivered for a while, took her hand, and started crying all over again. Pin Tan hurriedly went outside to guard.</p>
<p>“It’s not good for mother!” Wa-shi cried, “If it weren’t for the impulse fight for favor back then, you wouldn’t have to be a man all your life!”</p>
<p>The backyard competition for favor in the Hua family was fierce, even comparable to the century. In the war, Wan Liufang was born from a humble background. In order to have a better life for himself and his children, he bought the midwife and insisted that the girl be a boy.</p>
<p>In fact, the safer way was to buy a boy directly in exchange, but Wan-shi couldn’t bear it. He thought it was a day if he could hide it. At least he could live a good life for a few days, right?</p>
<p>In the end, she didn’t expect that this would mean twenty years of concealment. Her child was still the promising, high school champion. Her child had managed to enter the court as the prime minister to become the ancestor of the glory.</p>
<p><em>’It is truly hard to ride such a fierce tiger!’</em></p>
<p>The more Wan-shi thought about it, the more sad she became, and she only cried further.</p>
<p>Hua Chun sighed and stretched out her hand to pat her back. “Everything will be fine. Our first priority is to deal with the emperor first, so this son will have a discussion with the girl later on, and then marry her as his wife.”</p>
<p>That was easy. However, the girl was like a delicate flower, a rare jade. Would she be subjected to a life of widowhood forever? Who would prefer that? Wan-shi shook her head again and again; This was such a risky endeavor. Rather than waiting for the disaster to come to her, she felt that she might as well just confess with the master first. Afterwards, the two of them would run away.</p>
<p>Hua Chun obviously disagreed with this idea. Wasn’t this TV show about the young prime minister? If he ran away at the beginning, how would the plot develop later? If it didn’t develop well, this TV series might get cut off. The people in it still wouldn’t know what her fate would be.</p>
<p>And so she said, “Prepare for the marriage. Mother will help her and tell her father that this son has to go to the palace again in order to wipe out the emperor’s suspicion. Otherwise, this matter will never be settled.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie’s eyes were perceptive and calculating, after all. If he were to seriously start focusing on her, it would only be a matter of time before Hua Chun’s identity would be revealed.<b></b></p>
