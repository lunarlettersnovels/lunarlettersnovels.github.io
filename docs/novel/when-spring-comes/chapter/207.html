            <p><b>Chapter 30 – Unsheathed Swords Disturb the Night (2)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About four to five people wandered below, inspecting every corner of the room in silence. Hua Chun closed her eyes and didn’t dare to keep looking. She was afraid that one of them would look up and she would undoubtedly yell out and get butchered, so she buried her head against Yu Wenjie’s chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Wenjie didn’t look down either, his head on top of Hua Chun’s. He was capable of protecting himself, but he was certain that Hua Chun, who could barely lift a sword, would be definitely killed. And Hua Chun’s death would be a terrible loss, which could be likened to losing one of his hands. So, he couldn’t be impulsive to fight with them. Yu Wenjie had to wait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was steps ahead of the assassins as he retreated to Zǐchen Hall, leaving them no clue of his whereabouts. After roughly searching the room, the assassins left at once, failing to find a single soul. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Wenjie’s tense muscles loosened a little. He was about to say something when he smelled a milky scent, urging him to look down. Hua Jinghua was engulfed in his arms; he was thinner than he looked. It was strange that he didn’t smell like books, but instead like warm, sweet milk. Yu Wenjie frowned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room fell into quietness again and the loud raindrops continued outside. Hua Chun opened her eyes and raised her head. She looked at Yu Wenjie, her finger pointing to her mouth. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can I speak?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Wenjie nodded and whispered, “Speak less and softly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it was best to remain silent lest they accidentally reveal their presence, but Hua Chun was overwhelmed with curiosity. She asked, “How could there be assassins in the palace?” The palaces in the TV shows were usually heavily guarded, and countless guards would swarm in seconds to protect the emperor even if there were assassins. How could they just let him stay here by himself?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t play dumb with me,” Yu Wenjie gave her an unhappy look,” Lord Xi is in the palace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lord Xi? How could she know him as there was no preview of his identity? It was unbeknownst to Yu Wenjie, but Hua Chun was indeed innocent. However, it was reasonable to ask less. She could probably guess. People in the palace were all chasing for the throne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrr.” Her stomach rumbled again. Hua Chun rubbed her belly shyly and intended to say sorry, only to hear the same sound come from the stomach of the man behind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrr.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startled, Hua Chun looked back at him. The expression on Yu Wenjie’s face remained unfazed, displaying not a hint of embarrassment. “I’m as busy as you. I didn’t have dinner either,” he said. It was natural for a hungry stomach to make a sound. A hungry emperor would not be an exemption!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh…” After accepting his explanation, Hua Chun looked at the figures still unscattered outside and asked in a low voice, “Would you like to have some too?” She reached out and took out the dried fish her mother had packed for her. She held it in front of him in a flattering way and said, “It’s made by my mother. It’s non-genetically modified green food. It doesn’t contain preservatives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken aback, Yu Wenjie looked at her with narrowed eyes and said bluntly, “Shut up. If you talk too much, you’ll be in trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua chun was startled and immediately became quiet. She crouched and carefully opened the oil paper package, releasing the spicy aroma. Since the emperor was behind her, Hua Chun tried her best to behave in an elegant manner. She did not chew in her mouth aloud, but ate slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rain was heavier. Along with the smell of dust that floated midair is the smell of dried fish. Yu Wenjie frowned at the ash on her face and her bulging mouth. He could also glimpse at her pale neck. This man, he was like a snow-white rabbit, Yu Wenjie thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at her delighting in the dried fish, Yu Wenjie became even more hungry. Having been emperor for so long, he had never felt this hungry. The hovering assassins outside persisted, the guards never arrived, and even Eunuch Qin didn’t return. Perhaps they would be trapped in the palace all night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing this, Yu Wenjie adjusted his posture and leaned against the wall at one end of the beam to save his strength. As a result, Hua Chun was dragged along with him, still chewing on the dried fish. Without a backward glance, she rested on his arms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor was becoming angry. If he was not afraid that he would fall down and reveal himself to the lurking assassins, he would really like to beat the guy comfortably lying in his arms. They were both men!</span><br>
