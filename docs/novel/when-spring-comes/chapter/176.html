            <p><strong>Chapter 61 – Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion (2)</strong></p>
<p>Seeing that his sworn brother actually picked someone, He Chang’an focused his gaze on the maiden before smiling and nodding.</p>
<p>“Eh, younger brother has good eyes.”</p>
<p>“Second brother, I’m interested in her. Don’t you dare rob her.” Hua Chun retorted, letting out a small laugh.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie, seeing He Chang’an’s interest in the girl, also stopped to look. Seeing the girl, Yu Wenjie nodded. She was small and attractive. But… next to a man like Hua Jinghua, even if a flower like this was seated next to him, it did not bring out any of his manliness at all.</p>
<p><em>‘What kind of woman will such a man marry in the future?’</em> Yu Wenjie thought as he narrowed his eyes at the prime minister’s form. Thinking over the silly question carefully, he finally concluded: ‘<em>Maybe… a general’s daughter. Hopefully, someone who would beat him up every day.’</em> At the thought, Yu Wenjie could not help but release a grunt, his lips forming into a small smile.</p>
<p>Oblivious to the emperor’s thoughts, Hua Chun turned to the girl beside her and reached out to touch her chin, donning on a roguish smile: “Pretty flower, what is your name?”</p>
<p><em>‘Nailed it! Who said TV dramas aren’t of help?’</em></p>
<p>The person in front of her merely smiled, not afraid of her at all. “This humble servant’s name is Qing Niao.”</p>
<p>Taken aback, Hua Chun dropped her hand and looked at her in shock. “What? You… Have you also crossed?”</p>
<p>In response, the maiden merely blinked at her, her actions tinged with innocence. “Young Master, what are you talking about?” Qing Niao asked slowly. After a few beats, she stretched out her hands towards the table, wrapping themselves around the bottle of wine that was laying there.</p>
<p>Whilst pouring Hua Chun a cup, she said, “This humble servant is a newcomer to Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. Thus, this servant is still not too familiar with the rules. If this servant has done anything wrong, I ask the Young Master to forgive me.”</p>
<p>As she accepted the cup, Hua Chun continued to look at her with unsettled eyes, the burn in her chest growing.</p>
<p><em>‘Really? This is not Qin Niao? But the eyes are too similar. Qin Niao, Qing Niao, is she really not the same?’</em></p>
<p>In her past life, she experienced a lot of painful events, and Qin Niao was the one who was always by her side, cheering her up. Others’ girl friends might be stealing their men and doing all kinds of bad things but, a good person like Qin Niao, who took pictures with her and helped her photoshop them, was one of the best Chinese besties ever.</p>
<p>At this moment, seeing Qing Niao, Hua Chun acknowledged that she really missed Qin Niao. She didn’t even know how she was in the future.</p>
<p><em>‘Qin Niao… I haven’t seen you in so long, a.’</em></p>
<p>As she was lost in her thoughts, staring at Qing Niao, He Chang’an looked towards them and smiled. “Younger Brother, you seem to really like this girl, eh?”</p>
<p>At the question, Hua Chun turned to look at him with wide eyes—only to see him raise his cup towards her. “If you like her so much, let your older brother redeem her for you. Consider it a gift. She seems to be honest and upright.”</p>
<p><em>‘So generous?’</em> Hua Chun thought, shocked. After regaining her senses, he shook his head and glanced between He Chang’an and Qing Niao. Nervously, she asked: “Is it expensive?”</p>
<p>Qing Niao paused before nodding and bowing her head. “This slave is worth two taels of silver, Young Master.”</p>
<p><em>‘Two taels? That sounds cheap.’</em> Hua Chun thought as she lowered her head in contemplation. After a beat, she raised her head to look at Qing Niao again.</p>
<p><em>‘I… I am penniless, afterall. The emperor wouldn’t be able to return my pocket money, from when I changed clothes at the palace so…’</em></p>
<p>“Then… Thank you, Second Brother!” Hua Chun called out, turning to smile at He Chang’an. “When we go back, I will definitely prepare and return a gift!”</p>
<p>Waving his hand, He Chang’an called over a manservant and settled the price. Then, he said, “As long as you are happy, Younger Brother. What need is there for a return gift?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Hua Chun felt that He Chang’an was simply an ancient version of Gao Fu and Shuai. Even the action of giving silver away was very much like the modern rich and young young masters that handed their black cards to cashiers.</p>
<p>If Hua Jinghua ever reveals herself to be a woman at the end of this TV series, Hua Chun fervently hopes that He Chang’an be the male lead!</p>
<p><em>‘I don’t care! The ending should be like this!’</em><br>
