            <p><strong>Chapter 38 – The Prime Minister’s Crime </strong></p>
<p>“Alright, it’s also an opportunity for me to pay a visit to our Prime Minister’s house to see how he is now.” He Chang’an bowed his head, “I’m going.”</p>
<p>“Go,” Yu Wenjie nodded.</p>
<p>Hua Liuying stared helplessly at the retreating silhouette of the Duke of Gongyu. When his back could be seen no more, she hiked up her skirt and knelt before the emperor. “Your Majesty, please give lenient sentences to Hua family for the sake of my great care of you these years.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie stood up, brushing the dust on his imperial robe, and stared at the crouching figure. “I don’t like mercurial people. You are selfless so I give you a chance to prove that you really are. Isn’t it good enough?”</p>
<p>Hua Liuying was quiet, and her silent agony infuriated her. The emperor then walked out of the room without sparing her a glance. “Eunuch Qin, arrange vehicles to see Consort Hua.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” answered Eunuch Qin. Taking a look at Noble Consort Hua, he left with the emperor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, He Chang’an rode his horse to the Hua Hall once he departed the palace. The prime minister piqued his interest, owing to the matter of his proclaiming a false decree. He, who was said to be clever, couldn’t get himself in trouble simply because of a yard. But the behavior of Noble Consort Hua had aroused disgust in his heart, so if he were to take a side, it would be on Hua Jinghua.</p>
<p>The servant walked forward to get the porter informed. The porter opened the gate at once and went to report to the prime minister.</p>
<p>Hua Chun had enjoyed a deep and peaceful slumber. She was reading the documents in traditional Chinese when Pin Tan hurried to her side and said, “My Lord! You should go to the Flower Hall right now!”</p>
<p>What happened? With an unpleasant intuition, Hua Chun hurried to stand up only to hurt her bones. After a rough massage, she limped towards the Flower Hall without a second choice. He Chang’an had been waiting in the hall for the duration of two burning joss sticks. Soon, Master Hua’s figure appeared and he gestured a salute to He Chang’an, “It’s rare for the Duke of Gongyu to return to the Imperial City, more even so to visit the Hua Hall.”</p>
<p>Master Hua hadn’t worked in the government; it was no wonder that he would be so shallow to say these words. How could he be so polite to him as the Duke of Gongyu was not higher than Prime Minister Hua in status at all? He Chang’an smiled, “I was sent by the emperor to investigate whether Prime Minister Hua had proclaimed a false decree.”</p>
<p>“Proclaim a false decree?” Master Hua was dumbfounded. The aunts behind the curtain in the side hall all gasped.</p>
<p>“Noble Consort Hua had reported that the Prime Minister had proclaimed a false decree just now in the palace, so I was dispatched by the emperor to investigate it,” said He Chang’an, “If it’s true, Hua Hall will be closed down and all relatives including the Noble Consort will be degraded to commoners and exiled.”</p>
<p>At first, Aunt Ren was gloating, assuming her scheme was triumphant; however, at He Chang’an’s words, all became hysterical, Aunt Ren not an exemption. Murmurs erupted behind the curtains. The wiser ones hurried to their rooms to pack their valuable possessions.</p>
<p>“Why did Noble Hua report our young master to the Emperor? How had this happened?”</p>
<p>“Sister Liu, you have to give us a reasonable explanation. Are you trying to make all of us lead a miserable life by getting us in trouble?”</p>
<p>Wiping the beads of sweat on his temples, Master Hua asked, “Is there any mistake? My boy should have known the rules.”</p>
<p>“I am here to figure out,” said He Changan, “Please sit down. Let’s wait for him.”</p>
<p>“I’m here.”</p>
<p>He Chang’an turned his head to the voice and saw Prime Minister Hua striding towards them, dressed in white. People always admired him as a rare beauty. He Chang’an came to realize that there were more beauties after he returned to the Imperial City. Mountains were lush with green and the oceans were gentle with their cerulean waves. Eyeing Hua Jinghua up and down, He Chang’an smiled, “Your timing couldn’t be better, my Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>Seeing him, Hua Chun felt friendly and said confidentially, “How about your waist?”</p>
<p>“It’s good. I have put a plaster on it” He Chang’an replied as he watched her sit down, “You were so dusty in the morning that I hadn’t seen you clearly. But now I must say that you are indeed such a unique beauty.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much,” Hua Chun laughed humbly, but in her eyes there was a glint of pride. The atmosphere suddenly turned harmonious. At the end of their friendly chat, Hua Chun asked, “Oh, my Duke, what brings you to our house?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Gongyu Duke said gently, “just to investigate the case that you had proclaimed a false decree and cheated the Emperor.”<br>
