            <p><b>Chapter 24 – The Emperor Doesn’t Like Hua Chun (I)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once she accepted her reality and adapted to the rules of the world, it became surprisingly natural for Hua Chun. She didn’t know if she had always loved costume drama and classical things, but she liked everything here and became very familiar with greeting people. For a moment, she even felt the sense of fate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, I made you some dried fish.” Her mother handed a paper bag of dried fish to her. “The aroma has attracted many cats over. It’s delicious, I promise!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun was a bit dumbfounded as she sniffed the air and looked at the paper package in her hand in amazement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unbelievable! The Prime Minister actually liked to eat dried fish!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to deal with lengthy work at the palace. If you feel hungry, just eat this dried fish quietly. I am sure Your Majesty won’t mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling deeply moved, Hua Chun placed the packet of dried fish into her pocket and nodded to Wan-shi. “Mother, don’t worry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she was a bit domineering, Wan-shi was a good mother. Even for this bag of dried fish, she had to fight with the Emperor again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun still had trouble walking. In the afternoon, some old ministers carried her to the palace in a sedan chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can I have a talk with you?” She looked at Grand Master Tang beside her with a straight face and asked, “Now that you have brought me in by sedan chair, can you also carry me out by it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grand Master Tang was stunned and retorted, “In the morning, the servants were waiting outside the Hall of Xuan Zhang, and the sedan chair was also prepared. You didn’t come back home by sedan chair, did you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun was dazed. Why were they waiting outside the Hall of Xuan Zhang when she worked at the Imperial study?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun wiped her face and smiled dryly, “It’s alright.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be taken as a joke by many servants gratuitously!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grand Master Tang cast a look at her and said, “The Prime Minister still has to consult more with Your Majesty about granting a relief fund.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand.” She had indulged in similar endeavors back in her world. There was no difference between ancient and modern times when it came to corruption in disaster relief.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">She had presented an idea before, but it was rejected strictly by her superior, because it would hurt too many people. But for now, she was uncertain whether or not she had a chance to practice it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Wenjie, who slept in the royal bed, woke up from his dream. His eyes swept across the people beside the bed as soon as he opened his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eunuch Qin, slightly surprised, offered herbal tea and brocade handkerchiefs promptly to serve him to get up. “Your Majesty, there is a meeting from three to five o’clock.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Meeting?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After a pause, Yu Wenjie closed his eyes. When his eyes fluttered open again, he returned to a calm state, the hostile look in his eyes dissipating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dream visited his sleep again. In the dream, it seemed that he had lost something which made his heart, liver, spleen, and lungs wrung together. The feeling made him grumpy, but he had to restrain himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After putting on his court dress, Yu Wenjie went to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hall of Xuan Zheng</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a pale face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While waiting for the Emperor, Hua Chun took a seat on the chair, humming songs and eating a mouthful of dried fish leisurely. Wan-shi was skillful at cooking, and the dried fish cooked by her was the best snack; it was spicy and hot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Hua Chun was relishing her meal, the voice of Eunuch Qin rang out from outside. “Here comes the Majesty!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She learned to be well-behaved this time. Without saying a word, she immediately knelt down on the ground and kowtowed respectfully. “We are waiting to greet Your Majesty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Wenjie, frowning,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">finally reached the throne in the middle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His back to the north and facing the south, he slowly took a seat and glanced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Prime Minister Hua.” He asked somewhat mockingly, “The meeting is not the morning audience, why are you kowtowing to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, Hua Chun wished she could slap herself to death! She should study the court etiquette now! It was the second time that she felt disgraceful!</span><b></b></p>
