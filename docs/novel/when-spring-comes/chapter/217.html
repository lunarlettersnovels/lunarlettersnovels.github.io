            <p><strong>Chapter 20 – Hua Jinghua’s Thoughts (1)</strong></p>
<p>Somewhat surprised, Hua Chun reached out and took the book, flipping through it. The words written on the copy were purely flattering words for the Emperor, whatever wise and unparalleled. As long as it was a good word, it had been piled upon him.</p>
<p>It seemed to be extremely favorable, even if there was no substance in it at all. No wonder it had been sentenced to be discarded.</p>
<p>However, even if the book was old and invalidated, by all means, Hua Chun was unexpectedly captivated by it. She had added a lot of notes next to it using her vermilion pen.</p>
<p>“The Emperor succeeded the throne at such a very young age, now that’s pure bravery. Handsome, young and mighty but tough and reckless, how can he be called the Emperor of all ages?”</p>
<p>“There are so many beautiful ladies in the harem, who said that there was no desire for a pure heart?”</p>
<p>As Hua Chun read the passages, whenever there were excessive compliments about the Emperor, she would smile irritatingly and often internally disagreed. She probably knew that the book would be discarded, so she wrote unfair and dishonest remarks. Although there were no insulting words about the Emperor, and what was said was all true. All her side comments were obviously full of annoyance and provocation, and… a strange feeling.</p>
<p>Stupefied for a while, Hua Chun turned to the end of the writings.</p>
<p>The man who wrote the book was wonderful and kind enough. He exaggerated the whole story, but in the end, he said: “Heaven envies talents, how early the Saint died; the Saint should take care of his body, and live a long life.”</p>
<p>At first glance, he was an unprofessional ghostwriter. Ah! Fortunately, the book was not published. If the Emperor were to see it, the writer would have died. Although it wanted to express that the Emperor should take care of his health, it was too unlucky to say it.</p>
<p>The lines written by Prime Minister Hua in the book are also hefty, and so she wrote stroke by stroke:</p>
<p>“Long live the Emperor, no need to worry about it.”</p>
<p>Looking at these words, Hua Chun was taken aback and felt her heart become even weirder.</p>
<p>Hua Chun looked at the books in front of her. She should have hated Yu Wenjie so much and couldn’t live with him. But when she saw the writings in the book, she suddenly felt that Hua Jinghua felt awe for the Emperor, maybe.</p>
<p>“Master.” Pin Tan’s voice suddenly sounded outside. “It’s time for lunch. Do you want me to bring your food in here or just in the dining area?”</p>
<p>She picked up the book with her hands and put it away. Hua Chun thought about it and shouted, “Bring me to the dining area.”</p>
<p>She hasn’t met anyone else in the mansion yet, so she thought it would be a good idea to roam around and get to know everyone so she could somehow be friends with them.</p>
<p>Pin Tan answered, opened the door, and came in to help her. While leaning near, she whispered into Hua Chun’s ear, “Wan-shi just had an argument with Aunt Fu, please be careful.”</p>
<p><em>‘What? Arguing again?’</em> Hua Chun thought as she sported an incredulous look. Looking at Pin Tan, Hua Chun could not help but ask curiously, “Why?”</p>
<p>“It was because of the matter of not repairing the family yard.” Pin Tan said helplessly, “Wan-shi told the master about this, and Master Hua asked Aunt Fu to listen. She probably showed some schadenfreude* and annoyed Wan-shi. After all, if Hua’s yard will not be repaired, then it has something to do with the imperial concubine, and the Lady can’t help but confront Aunt Fu.”</p>
<p>Aunt Fu was the biological mother of Senior Concubine Hua. Although she was only referred to as an aunt, that was only because Senior Concubine Hua entered the harem and attained a high position. Her position in the harem should not be underestimated, and Wan-shi did not dare provoke her too much.</p>
<p>Breathing heavily, Hua Chun followed the servant out, feeling a little guilty. Her mother’s extravagant temperament must have been shown off as she wanted the yard to rebuild desperately, and now that she had decided not to, her mother must have been ridiculed secretly.</p>
<p>She had to think of a way to make up for this mess.</p>
<p>The master of the Hua Family was a… capable man. He actually had four concubines, himself. One of them died young, and the other three sat at the table in fine satin clothes. Each aunt had a child with her, that looked to be fifteen or sixteen years old, and the youngest fifth master, Hua Xinyua, was only 10 years old.</p>
<p>In the study, Hua Chun found a letter from Grandpa Hua Cheng for her, saying that Master Hua did not strive for success, failed to get a good reputation, and could see him become the Prime Minister in this lifetime. And the old man died without any regrets.</p>
<p>In other words, Master Hua should have no glory to his name, so this mansion must only be called “Hua-Fu.”</p>
