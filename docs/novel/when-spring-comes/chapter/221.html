            <p><strong>Chapter 16 – Never a Smile on His Lips (1)</strong></p>
<p>A warm and soft voice, but somehow it made people feel a little intimidated. Hua Chun was still standing in front as the imperial concubine carelessly sat on the Emperor’s thigh.</p>
<p>Since the imperial concubine was her relative, Hua Chun did not treat the concubine as an outsider. So she was not bothered at all by her actions.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie didn’t move. Although his hand was still on the arm of the chair, he didn’t refuse the concubine’s gesture.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister’s proposal was for the people in the kingdom, and I can’t stop if it wanted to disappoint me and all families in the harem.” Senior Concubine Hua herself said to the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Hua Chun arched her hand and was about to speak. But then she heard Senior Concubine Hua gave a soft and lovely laugh, a laugh as crisp and loud as the firecrackers on the ground.</p>
<p>“The eldest brother seemed to never care how the concubines feel. If the Prime Minister believed that rebuilding the backyard was not appropriate at this time, then don’t. I can’t do anything about it. There’s no need to repair the hall anymore. Save money and send relief. What do you think, older brother?”</p>
<p>Will this matter end the relationship between the Prime Minister and Senior Concubine Hua as brother and sister? Hua Chun looked at concubine Hua secretly; her words were like roses graced with thorns. Can the palace and a backyard be the same? It makes no sense to spend money on a backyard, it’s too unreasonable.</p>
<p>Just when she was about to contradict what Senior Concubine Hua said, Yu Wenjie said, “The Prime Minister is an example of a hundred officials. If you want to provide disaster relief, take the lead in donating silver taels, without Hua Guifei reminding you.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun remained silent.</p>
<p>This high hat was to be put on first, which makes people unable to get down. Are Taiwan’s tricks a bit familiar? She just used it now, and her ability to learn and use it was pretty good.</p>
<p>Concubine Hua covered her lips with a pair of winking eyes and asked her, “Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, as long as the Emperor gives priority to the people, then this minister also regards himself as an example of a hundred officials and does not disappoint the Emperor.” Although Hua Chun was new to Hua’s family, all she could was agree and nod her head obediently.</p>
<p>The imperial concubine snorted, pursed her lips, and got up to pay her respect to the Emperor. “Since the Prime Minister has said what needs to be done, the concubine cannot be a wicked witch to this country, and the repair of the Yong-An Temple should be decided by the Emperor and the Prime Minister.”</p>
<p><em>‘So much talking?’</em></p>
<p>Hua Chun was happy, bowed her head, and saluted. Yu Wenjie also nodded and watched Hua Chun leave.</p>
<p>“Since the imperial concubine doesn’t object, according to Grand Preceptor Tang, let’s postpone the repair of the Yong-An temple and provide disaster relief first,” he said. “Is the Prime Minister satisfied?”</p>
<p>“Satisfied!” Hua Chun plastered a smile, but felt wrong. Something was not right. She immediately bowed her head and said respectfully, “Your majesty!”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie looked at her quietly for a while and rubbed his eyebrows tiredly, “What else does the Prime Minister want to say?”</p>
<p>“The minister has nothing else to say. I must leave.”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm.”</p>
<p>As Hua Chun left the imperial study, she felt the wind pass through her and shivered.</p>
<p>This Emperor doesn’t seem to talk very much, and unlike the cheerful old men in other TV shows, Yu Wenjie was different. Although he was still only in his twenties, his serious face gave people a lot of pressure. No wonder many of the old ministers are afraid to talk to him. And judging from the details of his looks, he should have been born as a martial artist, with a tall and robust body, not like an ordinary pretty boy.</p>
<p>It was a little fuzzy in her mind; Hua Chun suddenly couldn’t remember the name of the actor who played the Emperor in the TV series. Generally speaking, the protagonist will be introduced at the beginning of the film.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, she suddenly felt a little bit cold behind her.</p>
<p>The TV series on her computer seemed to … have no intro or credits? She opened the computer directly and entered the plot. At that time, she watched it with fondness and didn’t seem to care so much. But now, when she thinks about it, she feels a bit scared as if a gruesome twist of the story will happen.</p>
<p><em>‘How could a regular TV series not have a beginning and an ending?’</em></p>
<p>Squeezing her hand tightly, Hua Chun hurriedly walked out of the imperial study but exhausted by the pain on her buttocks. It was useless to walk fast.</p>
