            <p><strong>Chapter 67 –  I’m Not Interested in Women (2)</strong></p>
<p>The atmosphere in the court was a bit awkward, even Yu Wenjie found out that Hua Jinghua seemed to be getting squeezed out.</p>
<p>Why? Was it because he had always acted like he hated him, so everyone followed suit? Looking at the awkward young boy at the bottom right, the emperor pursed his lips, feeling that he really was innocent for the first time. However, he would not help him. Everything depended on his own ability.</p>
<p>Seeing that the emperor didn’t say much, the civil and military officials below also shared a feeling of understanding. People everywhere began to stand up and express their concerns in the court hall. This morning, the court unexpectedly went on for two full hours.</p>
<p>Hua Chun didn’t say a word. At first, she felt a little embarrassed and didn’t understand the reason why, but then she wanted to find out. Officialdom was also a place where the weak were continually stepped on. She did her job well, but that was it. The rest couldn’t be controlled.</p>
<p>The prime minister of this place had similar responsibilities as class representatives. It was not difficult to collect memorials and report to the emperor the situation in the central government, but Hua Jinghua was too conscientious. He took everything on his shoulders, and even took all the inappropriate memorials. It was blocked back, just like the class representative helped the classmates to change their homework. This kind of dedication was quite rare.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that they did not want to appreciate it.</p>
<p>Since people didn’t appreciate it, she was also happy. This meant that she would be able to leave the palace easily after the dynasty, going back to communicate with Qing Niao.</p>
<p>“Grand Secretary Li.” Grand Preceptor Tang stopped the person in front of him with some worry: “Is it really good for us to do this?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Grand Secretary Li said, “You have seen it too. Give all power to that. Boy Mao, he will do things that are harmful to everyone’s interests regardless. He should be taught a lesson.”</p>
<p>“But…” Grand Preceptor Tang frowned and muttered. “It shouldn’t be so serious. The Prime Minister is also dedicated to his country. In this way, I am afraid that it will make him cold.”</p>
<p>“No.” Grand Secretary Li said: “You see the Emperor has been cold-eyed to him for so long, and you don’t see any reaction from him. Besides, in the presence of such a high official position as the Prime Minister, what could possibly cause him to be cold? You can relax. ”</p>
<p>’<em>Is that so?’ </em>Grand Preceptor Tang went silent.</p>
<p>The courtiers also had their own circle. He, Grand Secretary Li, General Meng and others were both guardians of the imperial faction. He didn’t know why, but both Grand Secretary Li and General Meng had started targeting Prime Minister Hua this time. They held a small meeting in private and decided to give the prime minister a warning.</p>
<p>Everyone was only good for the emperor. Thinking about this, Grand Preceptor Tang didn’t bother too much with this issue, and went out of the palace with everyone.</p>
<p>As soon as Hua Chun got off the sedan chair, she saw the green curls waiting for her at the gate of Huafu.</p>
<p>Even she had to admit that the girl Qing Niao was so well-behaved. She didn’t talk much, she always looked at her with the eyes of a kitten looking at her owner, telling her to do whatever she wanted. In short, she was very obedient.</p>
<p>To such a girl, Hua Chun had always had no immunity, and she couldn’t wait to feel pain like her sister.</p>
<p>“It’s so hot outside, why did you come out and wait?” When Hua Chun asked these words softly, she felt like she had suddenly become a man. She was almost tempted to flex her biceps to emphasize the feeling further.</p>
<p>Qing Niao smiled at her, not a coquettish smile, but the kind of smile that was very close to a friend, and whispered, “Because of the hot weather today, presumably the adult’s mood will not be too good, so the servants came to the door and waited. Take the adults back to drink some rock sugar and white fungus soup.”</p>
<p>This girl was really amazing, and she knew that things might be bad today. Hua Chun smiled and followed her inside.</p>
<p>It was impossible to say yes. After all, whoever got squeezed out would be unhappy, but it was not enough to invade her mind all day. After all, what others thought was other people’s business, and she should decide what she did. Yes, it wouldn’t help things if she simply were to follow what the people wanted like some sort of puppet.</p>
<p>If they did, then they weren’t cut out to be the protagonist.</p>
<p>Hua Chun was still obsessed with the protagonist. After all, the protagonist had the law of immortality. Because of this, she would definitely be a good prime minister according to the famous Hua Jinghua’s style.</p>
<p>“I should be free recently.” After drinking the white fungus soup, Hua Chun looked at Qing Niao hesitantly and said: “Is there anyone else in your family?”</p>
<p>Qing Niao was taken aback, looked at her fixedly, and then shook his head “No, my parents have died early on.”</p>
<p>Poor thing. Hua Chun couldn’t help but pity her. “You do know that marrying me means that we won’t indulge in the bridal chamber ritual…?”</p>
<p>“This slave knows.” Even before Hua Chun had finished speaking, Qing Niao had already answered.</p>
<p>Hua Chun felt a little shocked, looking at her before speaking once more. “And even then, you are only allowed to be my person and no one else’s.”</p>
<p>“This slave knows.” Qing Niao simply smiled, eyes clean and clear. “If there are no adults, slaves and maids will definitely not be able to escape from the fire pit, so the adults can do anything with their slaves and maids.”</p>
<p>Why were ancient girls so simple and cute? Hua Chun’s heart was about to melt, though she felt even guiltier at this point. “I… I have no interest in women.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Niao’s lips curled up into a smile, and her eyes bent into crescents. “It’s okay, the slave knows your lord. I just want to repay you for your kindness.”</p>
