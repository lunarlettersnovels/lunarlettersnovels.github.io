            <p><strong>Chapter 43 – Stuck with the Emperor (2)</strong></p>
<p>“I have known that her conduct is not good,” said the queen, “it is Wanbao Hall that the Emperor would first head for after the levee. I believe that only you can help me to lead the emperor to the right way.”</p>
<p>Huo Qianrou was as glamorous as a fox. And it was said that she was mean and crazy about fighting for favor. The queen was worried about such a person alongside her son. But there weren’t many concubines that were decent in the harem and those close to her were not favored by the emperor. The queen had no choices but to turn to the prime minister for help.</p>
<p>“What do you want me to do?” Hua Chun asked.</p>
<p>“Accompany the Emperor as long as you can these days,” said the queen, “you have an eye on him for me. Instruct him to read more books. He doesn’t have interest in ancient books and is only enthusiastic about cold weapons.”</p>
<p>The task was rather difficult. Hua Chun smiled dryly. Yu Wenjie disliked her so much that he even wanted to slap her against the wall. She would get herself killed if she always staggered around him. She weighed every word and asked, “Is Noble Consort Hua still in the palace?”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it,” said the queen helplessly, “I have helped her a lot as she is of the Hua family. I’ve thought that she would have been as loyal and sensible as you, but…” With a pause, she continued, “The Emperor has ordered her to be degraded to Consort Hua and live in the Youyang Hall. It’s possible that she wouldn’t have the chance to serve the Emperor for several months.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun gasped and was left speechless. She was right that Hua Liuying was more miserable than Ren-shi. Why did she look for trouble for her own? Her surname was also Hua but she screwed with Prime Minister Hua. So Hua Liuying didn’t fit for a high position. Those whose brain was worse would be more painful after falling from a high level. Now she was just degraded in terms of the title. It would be great if she could become conscious and aware of her identity. If she kept looking for trouble, one day the whole Hua family would be incriminated.</p>
<p>“Now that you have ordered me to do so,” Hua Chun said, “I would follow your instruction.”</p>
<p>She was occupied enough with the disaster relief. There were many unintentional reasons why the emperor offered to drive her away. The imperial power was supreme and the queen wouldn’t blame her for anything. This was the circuitous strategy. She was not a child anymore who would dash around madly.</p>
<p>The queen stared at her pleasedly and sighed, “If only Hua family has a girl as sensible as you. And you deserve it if you are the queen.”</p>
<p>At her words, Hua Chun’s heart missed a beat and she looked at the queen with surprise. Then, she hurried to salute humbly. The queen thought highly of Hua Jinghua, almost moved by his honesty, integrity and loyalty. After all, there were few who didn’t care much about the paddling and kept serving the emperor like her. However, pride and dignity that were significant for ancient people meant nothing to Hua Chun. She was satisfied with leading a good life and didn’t have many demands. So the modern people would live well in ancient times, as they wouldn’t die for their face.</p>
<p>After leaving Huiming Hall, Hua Chun just followed Yuejian to Wanbao Hall. She had heard the sound of instruments before she was close to the hall. It must be an obscene scene. It said in books that the emperor has a hundred and eighty methods to play with women, such as the wine pond and meat forest, naked beauty lying down and cracking silks for a beauty’s smile.</p>
<p>But when she opened the door and stood outside, she found something unusual. There was a beauty dancing and her curves were evident with the little piece of clothing that she wore. Meanwhile, the emperor sitting on the chair was…</p>
<p>Checking memorials!</p>
<p>Wasn’t there anything wrong? The woman’s bare skin felt smooth even at a distance. Her dance even made Hua Chun, a modern woman, blush, but Yu Wenjie was merely checking the memorials one by one and ticked with a red pen at times. Having mixed feelings, Hua Chun didn’t know whether she should praise him or say something else.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty.” Yuejian walked forward and curtsied lightly, “I have sent Prime Minister Hua for your company by the order of the Queen. The Queen has ordered that from this day forward the Prime Minister has free access to the harem.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie looked up and frowned at Hua Chun. “So you have just accepted such a ridiculous decree?” There was no reason for the official to have free access to the harem.</p>
<p>“What the Queen meant is, the Prime Minister could come for your company as long as you are in the harem,” Yuejian laughed, “or he wouldn’t come to the harem.”</p>
<p>More annoyed, the emperor looked up and glanced at the door. “Why don’t you come in as you are here?”</p>
<p>With haste, Hua Chun straightened herself, left with no chance to escape. She hurried to lower her head to salute, “Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>The music stopped and the beauty ceased to dance. The emperor squinted at the man who knelt and said calmly, “Arise.” The smell of gunpowder in his tone almost drove her crazy. Hua Chun was rather nervous. It was the queen that had forced her. She never had any intention to stay by the emperor’s side!</p>
