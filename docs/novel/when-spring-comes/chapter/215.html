            <p><b>Chapter 22 – Can Only Accept Reality (1)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know Wan-shi is older than me, and I should not have put up a fight with her. But, what she said was too biased! If it hadn’t been for my daughter, Senior Concubine Hua, would the fifth young master still be alive now? Would the young master’s career be so smooth?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, Aunt Fu was relatively calm. Yet, she found herself raging after Wan-shi’s words. She frowned and looked at Wan-shi and said, “They are all Master Hua’s children. You gave birth to noble children. However, others will be born lowly, but the wind and water will turn. Sooner or later, you will ask for help!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s the other way around!” Wan-shi was furious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan-shi was sitting on the right side of Master Hua, and Aunt Fu was on the left, not far away. Wan-shi was holding a bowl and thought of smashing the younger sister in the face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her hand was held by someone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why does mother seem so excited?” Hua Chun ate something to cushion her rumbling belly and soon felt better. Hua Chun smiled and looked at Wan-shi, “A family meal like this… it will make everyone feel nervous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master Hua was about to open his mouth to get angry at Wan-shi when he was stopped by Hua Chun, so he could only turn his head and yell at Aunt Fu, “Aren’t there any rules in this house?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aunt Fu was surprised and looked at him resentfully. Wan-shi and her are both to be blamed, and yet Master Hua only yelled at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mother, your thoughts and ideas are all clear and are taken into consideration,” Hua Chun sighed. “There is no need for you to feel sorry for your son. Now that I have decided to assist the Emperor, I will be like a tiger. You don’t have to worry about such trivial matters as being beaten. As of the matter of building the yard, I will find another way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm…” Wan-shi’s body softened at her daughter’s words. Settling back onto her seat, Wan-shi faced Hua Chun, her lips pursed into a thin line. “I don’t want to fight either, but some people insist on placing a hard time on your mother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun smiled, took a look at Aunt Fu, and said, “Aunt Fu’s words are sound, and some are reasonable. It is just rightful to thank the person who interceded and pleaded for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aunt Fu was slightly taken aback and looked a little surprised. After a glance at her, the anger disappeared a lot. It’s a good thing to pay respect and bow down, so as not to be arrogant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun continued to make polite statements to her aunt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks to Grand Secretary Li and Grand Preceptor Tang for being desperate and kneeling on their knees, pleading for the Emperor to have mercy on me while everyone was watching me beaten to death. I would also like to thank the second sister for reminding me that it is not appropriate to build her backyard at this time. I am even willing to stop repairing her Yong-An Hall at the same time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun looked at Aunt Fu gently. “I heard the second younger sister is still living in the Yetting Palace. When I have a chance, I will ask the Emperor for a decree that Aunt Fu will move to a larger palace first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took a long time for Aunt Fu to understand that Hua Chun was taunting her, and immediately her mood changed. “Prime Minister Hua does not need to worry about where I will live as the Emperor will naturally build a much bigger and beautiful palace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, that’s right.” Hua Chun nodded, curbed her expression, and said, “Then we don’t need to worry about Aunt Fu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aunt Fu choked and frowned at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can I enjoy a good meal?” Master Hua asked calmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone picked up their chopsticks. Hua Chun pressed on her mother’s hand, told her to be calm, and then continued to fill her stomach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, Hua Chun did not like to argue with people at all. She didn’t like to fight, rob, or pay attention in crowds either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she has a trick – it was called pretending. In her world, her boss often took her to serious meetings. Why? Because even though she was inexperienced, she was calm and confident when talking to other people, which lowered people’s guards and heightened their views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, even if she was a newcomer and scared to death in this new world, she can still make two moves ahead of Aunt Fu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go out and then counsel.</span></p>
