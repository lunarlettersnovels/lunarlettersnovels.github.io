            <p><strong>Chapter 35 – Changed Hua Chun (2)</strong></p>
<p>“The backyard of the Hua family has nothing to do with the court, but because of Imperial Concubine Hua, the Emperor gave such an order.” Hua Chun explained, “The Emperor appreciated my filial piety, and for the sake of my meritorious service, so he gave me grace. You can just go and tell father to continue to repair the courtyard as originally ordered.”</p>
<p>“That’s wonderful!” Wan-shi exclaimed with a bright smile, her orbs trembling in delight. “I know my son is outstanding, no matter how difficult it is, he can get over all difficulties!” Pride strengthened her voice, and it made the other concubines uncomfortable. However, Ren felt differently; the news made her a little angry. She asked, “What about the Yong’an Palace?”</p>
<p>Hua Chun replied, “Yong’an Hall still can’t be built. The money of the national treasury should be used for the disaster relief.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Ren frowned. She took a deep breath in an attempt for her words to sound gentle, but she couldn’t stifle her rage. She looked at her intensely and said, “We agreed in the beginning. If the Yong’an Hall couldn’t be built, then the backyard should not be repaired either. Now you want to repair the backyard, without building the Yong’an Hall? We are all families, this is not good for harmony, right?”</p>
<p>“How could you say that?” Hua Chun looked at her, “It was the idea of the important officials in the Imperial Court to stop building the Yong’an hall first. As the Minister, I merely suggested. Who knows that Imperial Concubine Hua wanted to stop repairing the courtyard to make her feel balanced. Even though this is not fair, I also agreed with her. Now, it is the Emperor’s idea and it has nothing to do with me, so why do you blame me?”</p>
<p>Hua Jinghua had not spoken much at home since she was born, even Wan-shi was startled at her fierceness. But she quickly helped her son, “That’s right! Your daughter started it. You shouldn’t blame my son.”</p>
<p>“You!” Ren did no longer attempt to conceal her irritation, but she was a sensible person; she knew there was nothing she could do right now, so she contained her anger and curtsied, “I’ll leave first!”</p>
<p>“Take care,” Wan-shi waved her hand at her retreating silhouette.</p>
<p>For such a long time, although she was the mistress, she had suffered much from her. Hua Chun didn’t care about her before, so she always held herself back. Now, Hua Chun knew how to refute! Relief flooded Wan-shi’s heart. The other concubines looked at each other and shortly left with palpable resentment. The Third Lady bowed her head, glanced at Hua Chun sheepishly, and hastily ran after the others.</p>
<p>With a sigh of relief, Hua Chun turned to Pin Tan and said, “I want to take a bath.” Pin Tan was stunned, but she then nodded and plastered a smile, “I will go to prepare.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun shook her head and looked at Wan-shi who had affectionately clasped her hands with hers and said, “I will do my best to treat you well, there is no need for you to argue with them.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Hearing her words, Wan-shi also felt a little guilty, “but I just can’t control myself very well, and I also caused many troubles for you.”</p>
<p>“It is nothing, but you are the mistress, you should have the temperament, don’t be fussy about some concubines?”</p>
<p>This was the first time that Hua Chun talked to her calmly! Wan-shi became a little excited. She crumpled her handkerchief and nodded repeatedly, “I understand.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun hoped that she would understand. A heavy sigh fell from her lips. Seeing the housemaid had already carried the bathtub and hot water into the room, she stood up and said, “Mother, please go back and have a rest, I am too tired, and I want to take a nap after taking a shower.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Wan-shi complied.</p>
<p>When the bathwater was ready, Pin Tan turned to bolt the door and shut all the windows tightly. “Master, I will serve you to take your clothes off.”</p>
<p>With a nod, Hua Chun followed her.</p>
<p>In the past, when watching TV series, she always hoped that Minister Hua would have a scene where he would take a bath and reveal a little of his skin, but now, Hua Chun felt conflicted.</p>
