            <p><strong>Chapter 50 – Wrong Turn of Events (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Right.” Looking around, He Chang’an then asked in a low volume, “Are there any update on the assassination in the Sun Hall?”</p>
<p>“Well…” The emperor looked a little uncomfortable when asked about this. “There are updates, but the evidence is not enough. They didn’t even keep any bodies, so I have to figure something else.”</p>
<p>“What do you want to do?”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie paused for a moment before replying, “The scenery of the city is very nice. Why don’t you and I go out of the palace to look around without any guards around?”</p>
<p>“This is a good idea.” He Chang’an clapped his hands and agreed, “I do want to walk around there, and it is even better with your presence.”</p>
<p>“Then come to the Sun Hall tomorrow afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Will do.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun contentedly followed the guiding servant all the way to the gate, her belly full of food. Before passing the Xuanzheng Hall, a servant caught up behind her and excused the guiding servant. The lady then came to her and said, “Prime Minister, my master asked me to send me this humble gift.”</p>
<p><em>‘What?’</em> Hua Chun looked at her, confused. The servant then put a piece of jade in her hand.  “Who is your master?” Hua Chun asked after looking at the jade pendant.</p>
<p>“It is Empress Huo Zhaoyi,” the lady said with a smile, “The Empress said the Prime Minister has worked hard for the country and the people. This humble gift is just a symbol of respect. She hopes you would kindly accept it.”</p>
<p>After finishing talking, she ran away, as if she was afraid that he would inexplicably return the gift.</p>
<p>Frowning, Hua Chun thought it was a bit difficult to handle. She would never accept a gift if someone gave her something. If this were to reach the queen mother’s ears, she would not be happy about it. However, it had been accepted, and if she were to return it, wouldn’t it be rude this time around?</p>
<p><em>‘What a trouble maker!’</em> This jade pendant seemed to be of great value, and even if she did not know much about antique and jewellery, she could still tell that the delicate touch and fineness were not at all ordinary!</p>
<p>“What do I do with it?”</p>
<p>It was the first time for her to receive such an expensive gift, but it had just resulted in insomnia and she didn’t sleep well that night. The next day, she fell asleep standing in the hall with two dark circles under her eyes.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister?” Yu Wenjie squinted at her.</p>
<p>Hua Chun closed her eyes, leaning back and forth. When she fell to a certain angle, she would even stand back on her own, like a ballpoint pen rolling in a pen holder.</p>
<p>The hall had become quiet. Everyone looked at Prime Minister Hua. Taishi Tang got anxious and quickly pulled at his clothes, “Prime Minister!”</p>
<p>Hua Chun opened his eyes with the blink of an eye and she looked up blankly. The emperor was staring at her with rage. But she was innocent! She just didn’t get enough sleep the night before. She probably slept for only an hour. Her biggest wish now was to go back to sleep immediately.</p>
<p>Whilst crying, Hua Chun went down on one knee. “I am sorry for my mistakes.”</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister manages everything, and seems to be more tired than me.” Yu Wenjie said calmly.</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised when the emperor worded it that way, but the prime minister wasn’t. Instead, he calmly responded, “If I manage everything and get more tired than you are, it is then worth doing.”</p>
<p>Li Zhongtang and others were relieved and secretly gave her a thumbs-up. Their Prime Minister Hua was so good at words that they didn’t even have to worry about him anymore. Look, he could even handle the emperor in different scenarios!</p>
<p>“I am very touched by your loyalty, Prime Minister.” The emperor nodded, “In this case, please go to the Sun Hall after. I would like you to take care of something for me then.”</p>
<p>“Ro…roger that.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun then broke down inside because, at this point, all she wanted to do was go home. Why did the emperor need to talk to her again? This was exactly the feeling one would get when the teacher asked her student to see her after class. It just felt annoying! However, there was no way she could say no since he was the emperor. She could only obey his orders.<br>
