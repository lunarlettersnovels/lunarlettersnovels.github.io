            <p><strong>Chapter 60 – Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion (1)</strong></p>
<p>Seeing this, Hua Chun merely shook her head while dragging her feet forward. <em>‘Do I really have to do this? I’m not interested, at all. I had my fill of brothels from the scenes in ancient dramas of the future.’</em></p>
<p>However, although the name of this brothel was tacky, it was unlike the ones she’d seen in ancient dramas.</p>
<p>First and foremost, there was no fat, bald, old man that was screaming at the door. Second, there were no exotic dancers who were making a show nor were there any girls stationed to call over customers. In fact, the courtyard was very large, clean, and grand. At the entrance, there were only two manservants, who, upon seeing them, handed over three inscribed bamboo tags.</p>
<p>Holding the narrow stick of bamboo in her hand, Hua Chun was at a loss on what to do. “What is this for?”</p>
<p>“Younger brother, you have never been to this kind of place before?” He Chang’an asked, his eyebrows raised in surprise. Waving the stick, he said with a smile: “When you see a girl you like, stick this into her bun!”</p>
<p><em>‘Wow. Ancient people really… know how to play. So, you don’t actually use hairpins nor use name plates? Rather, they’ll walk around with bamboo sticks in their hair? Ancient dramas, you have failed me.’</em></p>
<p>As her mind was occupied with such thoughts, Hua Chun registered movement in the corner of her eye. Turning to face that direction, she saw three girls walking towards them. They had their arms folded together at their waist, their chins raised, and… their head full of bamboo sticks.</p>
<p>Just like that, those girls walked past them, looking proud and pleased of themselves. And just like that, Hua Chun broke down, laughing. She laughed so hard, she had to prop herself up against the pillar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, He Chang’an and Yu Wenjie stood in place and looked at her with baffled expressions.</p>
<p>After a short moment, Hua Chun stifled her giggles as she righted herself. While wiping tears from her eyes with one hand, she spoke out while lazily waving the other in their direction: “It’s alright. I’m sorry, I forgot to take my medicine when I went out today.”</p>
<p>Still confused, He Chang’an walked over and placed his hand on his back, a look of concern painted on his face. Afterall, how could the ancients understand that modern joke? He Chang’an really thought he was sick!</p>
<p>“Is that so? Should I call for someone to get you some medicine now? Young brother, what is your illness?” He fretted while patting Hua Chun’s back.</p>
<p>Hua Chun, on the other hand, quickly covered their face then squared their shoulders while shaking their head. “It’s okay, it’s okay. Don’t worry, Second Brother!”</p>
<p><em>‘I can’t tell you the truth! You’d think I was crazy!’</em></p>
<p>In front of her, Yu Wenjie was staring at her, as though he was contemplating that she was actually crazy, before turning away his gaze and walking forward. Hua Chun simply shrunk back and directed a smile towards He Chang’an before stepping forward to follow the emperor into the front yard.</p>
<p>As they walked, Hua Chun observed her surroundings and realized that the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion did not look like any ordinary brothel. The surroundings felt very high-end. Surely, the beauties here would not be ordinary.</p>
<p>When they found their way into a room, a maidservant immediately came and greeted them. Naturally, He Chang’an beckoned her forward and slipped a token into her hands. Nodding obediently, the maidservant quickly left. Soon after, more than thirty girls came into the room. Although they were brightly dressed, their skin was not exposed and they all looked to be very well-mannered.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Hua Chun could not help but become curious. Afterall, which person did not like to appreciate beauty?</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie chose the best-looking one, and He Chang’an beckoned over a girl who looked delicate and gentle. After looking left and right, Hua Chun found her gaze focused on the girl who was located last in the row and had been staring at her this whole time.</p>
<p>This maiden, who looked to be around seventeen or eighteen years old, looked mediocre, at first glance. But, the more Hua Chun looked at her, the more pleasing she became. It was mostly due to the girl’s eyes—they looked clear, fresh and eager, and gave off the feeling that they’ve known each other for years.</p>
<p>They reminded her of her best friend, Qin Niao. She was the person who got her into TV dramas and always recommended her new things to watch. Although this little girl looked nothing like her, her eyes just felt like Qin Niao. So, that ultimately led to Hua Chun choosing her.</p>
<p><em>‘I… I’m not homesick. Not at all.’</em> Hua Chun thought as the girl made her way towards her.<br>
