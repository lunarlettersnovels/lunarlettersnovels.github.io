            <p><strong>Chapter 26 – An Embroidered Pillow</strong></p>
<p>The ministers standing next to her, who had ceaselessly shown her support, grew silent after listening to Hua Chun’s words. They all bowed their heads low, uttering not a single agreement. But she was not taken by surprise. Among these important officials, none would dare say that they are incorruptible. Even the Emperor wanted her embarrassed. He could choose this opportunity to destroy her.</p>
<p>Hua Chan felt calm though. In the beginning, she had spent countless nights composing plans, and she was satisfied if she were allowed to speak even a part of them.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie stared at her with a puzzled look. Previously, he felt that Prime Minister Hua had changed a little. He had specifically searched for the mole on the back of her neck to ensure it was her. Although he didn’t like her, he was privileged to have someone like her to assist him.</p>
<p>“Good idea.” Yu Wenjie nodded towards Hua Chun.</p>
<p>The two words that fell from his lips were like deep-sea torpedoes in the Palace of Xuan Zhang; it caught everyone by surprise. General Meng panicked for an instant, “Emperor, if you follow the Prime Minister’s words, you can really stir the whole body. I am afraid that a lot of trouble will occur.”</p>
<p>“General Meng is right…” Grand Preceptor Tang glanced at Hua Chun. He couldn’t help but say, “Doing this will delay disaster relief.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun received plenty of weird stares behind her, yet she straightened her back. She didn’t say a word wrong; she didn’t need a guilty conscience and worry.</p>
<p>“Men of Ai Qing do not have to worry.” Yu Wenjie was seated as he spoke. “I think the Prime Minister can observe the arrangements so there will be no delay.”</p>
<p>The situation is constant every year. When the relief supplies are released, the people are barely struggling to make ends meet. It is better to try other methods, and as the emperor, he has no other choice.</p>
<p>“This…” Everyone looked at each other in bewilderment. Grand Preceptor Tang even gently tugged Hua Chun’s sleeve.</p>
<p>Hua Chun ignored them, seeing as excitement filled her to the core. It would be great if a case that had not been used in modern times would be operated in this era. The Emperor didn’t seem to be as unreasonable as she thought and it would be worthwhile for her to rack her brains to think about classical Chinese.</p>
<p>Seeing that Prime Minister Hua didn’t mean to change his mind, all the old officials didn’t speak any longer.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie said, “The meeting is over. Please exit. Ai Qing please stay, along with Prime Minister Hua.”</p>
<p>“Move to Zǐ Chen Hall.” Yu Wenjie rose from his seat and cast a glance toward Hua Chun. He then said, “I hope what the Prime Minister just said is not a whim, but that there is already a plan that can be implemented.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun wowed inwardly; this must be the longest sentence she had heard from him.</p>
<p>The plan she had prepared could be useful. Hua Chun subconsciously folded her hands together and she looked at the Emperor, her eyes glistening. “Thank you, Emperor.”</p>
<p>At her greeting, she caught a glimpse of the man in front of her, a clear look of disgust in his eyes. Without a word, he walked past her and left.</p>
<p><em>‘What’s the matter? Didn’t you just agree with what I said?’</em> Hua Chun’s head was full of questions. Hua Chun presumed he must’ve wanted to pick him up and throw him out of the window.</p>
<p>Why do men live like this?</p>
<p>Growing up on horseback, Yu Wenjie admires iron-blooded men, and naturally, he hates embroidered pillows. And Hua Chun, whether in appearance or behaviour, is a blatant embroidered pillow.</p>
<p>If Hua Chun couldn’t say anything worthwhile later, he really didn’t mind dismissing him and have those old and cunning ministers do relief work instead. At that time, he knew that to be a good old man in the court would be of no use at all. In the face of interests, people would never help him again.</p>
<p>With a cold snort, the emperor walked hurriedly out of the room.</p>
<p>Hua Chun trailed after the emperor, clenching her teeth as the pain from her injuries still lingered on her body. Enlightenment dawned upon her: one cannot merely envy others from one aspect alone, but on the whole, women are better treated than men. She now wants to go back and continue to enjoy the life of a woman. Is God still awake?</p>
<p>Boom! A clap of thunder raced along the walls and Hua Chun jumped in fright. Yu Wenjie turned around to frown at her. Duke Qin chuckled lightly, “Seeing as it is going to rain today, you should not be afraid, Prime Minister. It is just thunder.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun smiled in embarrassment. Pursing her lips, she continued to follow the emperor until they reached the Zǐ Chen Hall.</p>
<p>A large table laid in the front hall of Zǐ Chen Hall, which is used for meetings and banquets. Surely, the emperor obviously would not spare Hua Chun anything to eat. He took the main seat and motioned her to sit and speak.</p>
<p>After rationalizing her thoughts, Hua Chun quickly entered the state, took paper and pen, and gave the emperor a thorough analysis on how to arrange disaster relief, ensuring to speak in classical Chinese.</p>
<p>For an entire hour, Hua Chun elaborated her plans. She used to hold back what she didn’t dare to say, but now she had reported every detail to Yu Wenjie, such as letting the people supervise officials, or sending officials who can’t come together, to supervise each other. The most important condition is: the routine cannot be the same year after year. It has to be changed so that people don’t have the opportunity to take advantage of the loopholes in advance.</p>
<p>After a long hour, the sun hid beneath the horizon.</p>
<p>At a sip of tea, Hua Chun looked at Yu Wenjie and waited for him to express his misgivings…</p>
<p>She was the only one who had expressed her opinions and it was time the emperor conveyed his thoughts. Looking at the paper with some unclear symbols on the table, Yu Wenjie was silent for a while, deep in thought, before saying, “Just do what you say.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun’s proposition was capable, and if the emperor would push through it, she was afraid that it would encounter a lot of resistance.</p>
<p>After a moment of pondering, Yu Wenjie approached Hua Chun. Just when he was about to say something, a spicy and glutinous smell pervaded his nose.<br>
