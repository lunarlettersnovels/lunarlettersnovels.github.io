            <p><strong>Chapter 56 – Mischievous Antic (1)</strong></p>
<p>Hua Chun trembled slightly on the table whilst looking at the ruckus that was currently unfolding before her. After a few moments, she replied, “I think this place is the safest. Even if they bump into me, they won’t be able to hit me.”</p>
<p><em>’Look at this fool!’ </em>Yu Wenjie didn’t bother expressing his anger verbally any further. Instead, he stretched his arm out towards her and placed her right next to him. “What senseless logic. It’ll be useless for you to hide from the beam of the room, so just stay there.”</p>
<p>“…Oh.” At this, Hua Chun nodded, then turned to watch the battle.</p>
<p>This had obviously been a premeditated trap, and their targets had taken the bait. All they did was sit around and wait for the assassins to show up, only to have them surrounded in the end.</p>
<p>Looking out the window, she found that the streets below them were also bustling with activity. There were a lot of strong men in commoner’s clothing, who were all busy carrying the bodies of the fallen assassins. They then dropped said bodies into bullock carts before wheeling them away.</p>
<p>It all looked terrible to her.</p>
<p>However, this particular group of assassins seemed to be in a hurry. He Chang’an was already planning to fight back. At first, He Chang’an was able to deal with it easily, but the guards around him had gotten injured a lot. The rest of the assassins rushed to him, and he soon found himself struggling.</p>
<p>“Sit and don’t move.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun was taken aback as she looked up at the emperor who was talking right next to her, and he actually stood up.</p>
<p>“S-Second Lord?” She stammered out, but Yu Wenjie had already rushed towards He Chang’an. This left Hua Chun staring after the two of them blankly. This was the first time she had had seen the emperor personally come on the court with all the intensity of a fierce confrontation. It almost felt like seeing a gang boss wielding a mace. For Hua Chun, it felt very subtle.</p>
<p>However, although their movements were not as good as those she had seen in TV shows with their own background music, Yu Wenjie’s strength was admittedly so powerful that he ended up hitting the opposite person against the wall with a single punch, causing the other person to bounce back like a spring, really vomiting. The person next to him then made a stab at his vest with a knife. However, Yu Wenjie had eyes implanted on his back, and kicked the person down the stairs with a reflexive kick.</p>
<p>Although Yu Wenjie’s personality turned out to be really infuriating, Hua Chun couldn’t help but cup her mouth with her hands, shouting, “Handsome!”</p>
<p>With the emperor’s help, He Chang’an managed to relax a little more, although their guards were half injured, and there were still about ten assassins, which made their goal barely manageable.</p>
<p>If they just didn’t bring her today…</p>
<p>Another man had gotten kicked by Yu Wenjie, which caused him to take a few steps back and clutch his chest. He looked so much in pain that he dared not step forward. For a moment, it appeared that a hundred thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>While in this state, he turned his head and saw the prime minister, who was standing still beside him, and was smiling like she had dementia. And so, Hua Chun, who had initially been enjoying the scene unfolding before, now found herself in quite a detrimental position. Her heart sank as she felt the cold chill of the blade on her neck.</p>
<p>Trembling slightly for a bit, Hua Chun decided to speak up meekly, “You’re busy fighting them, aren’t you? If so, then why are you here to catch me?”</p>
<p>“You look weaker than they do,” the person behind her replied honestly, “they are too powerful. Now, I can only pick soft persimmons.”</p>
<p>At this, Hua Chun fell into stunned silence. Did he really have to mock her in that manner? Although Hua Chun gritted her teeth, she didn’t say a word, as closing her eyes was considered submissive.</p>
<p>“You all stop!” The man shouted towards the other side.</p>
<p>Both He Chang’an and Yu Wenjie were taken aback, turning their heads one after another, their faces gradually darkening upon realizing what had happened.</p>
<p>“Let go of him.” He Chang’an frowned. “What kind of underhanded tactic is that?”</p>
<p>Hua Chun sighed. Although she was a butcher now, she still couldn’t help but want to complain: first, she at least had the strength to catch chickens. Second, these people were originally assassins, so what was she supposed to do against them?</p>
<p>As expected, the man behind her snorted. “We are not heroes. You must be obedient, otherwise, the Prime Minister Flower will die today. It’s your choice!”</p>
<p>Hua Chun raised her eyebrows after a slight pause.</p>
<p><em>’Prime Minister Flower?’</em></p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, He Chang’an asked, “What do you want?”</p>
<p>“It’s very simple.” The man looked around. “You will take the emperor’s life with your own hands.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be better if you just kill him.” The emperor didn’t hesitate to make his decision at all, and turned around and continued to fight the rest of the assassins.</p>
<p>He Chang’an also sighed helplessly. He then looked at Hua Chun. “Brother Xian, it’s not that the eldest brother and the second brother don’t want to help you, it’s just that there is no way to help.”</p>
<p><em>’Taking the emperor’s life in order to change the court’s life? What a joke.’</em></p>
<p>Hua Chun was about to cry in anger because of the stupid assassin behind her. He already knew the impossible, so why did he still bring it up?</p>
<p>Seeing that the other end still continued on with their fight, the man tied up with Hua Chun now felt a little silly, and he did not expect that the prime minister tied up would be so unintimidating. They simply ignored him, so what else was he supposed to do? Keep holding onto his leverage? What was the use of it?<br>
