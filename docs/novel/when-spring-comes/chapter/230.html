            <p><strong>Chapter 7 – A Dream So Vivid</strong></p>
<p>With a sigh, Hua Chun handed the plaster to the poor servant and asked them to put the medicine before lying down on the pillow.</p>
<p>She was just a trivial person in the vast world, a fresh college graduate. How could someone like her be so ill-fated and disastrous? At least her fate was different. Usually, females who crossed over were fated to be concubines or the Empress. But, no matter how beautiful they were, in the end, they were all prostitutes — beautiful and famous prostitutes. But her fate was only a bit better. She was a man. But… She was also a man that still could not see eye-to-eye with the emperor! Bah!</p>
<p>What kind of grudge did the world have with her? If she died here, would she go back to modern times where she wouldn’t have to suffer? If that were the case, she would not struggle so much and run to the palace and point at the emperor, scolding him for everything she could! Then, she could return home peacefully, with her grievances at rest.</p>
<p>Annoyed, she closed her eyes and turned her head to the side, shifting her form carefully to get comfortable but not disturb the ointment on her bottom. Speaking of the cream, it felt surprisingly refreshing. And although minor, the pain felt less than before. Smiling at the discovery, Hua Chun silently thanked the old officials in her heart as she slowly drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>“Jinghua.”</p>
<p>When she was sleeping soundly, she seemed to hear someone talking.</p>
<p>“Come back, Jinghua.”</p>
<p><em>‘Foodies are so rampant these days, even the obsession with ham sausage was so deep?’ </em>Hua Chun’s mouth twitched when she vaguely thought of the advertisement for the best ham sausage she often saw on TV when she was a child. <em>Lean Meat King! A~</em></p>
<p><em>‘Wait a minute. Who was thinking so much about that old brand? Really, their longing is so fierce. Their cries can reach my ears!’</em></p>
<p>She turned her head and continued to sleep, somehow feeling like she was flying in the middle of the sky, overlooking the entire city. There were no modern skyscrapers when she looked down on this old city. Instead, all she could see were old antique pavilions.</p>
<p>It looked familiar.</p>
<p>“This is Yanjing, don’t you remember?” someone sighed.</p>
<p><em>‘Yanjing?’ </em>Hua Chun’s thought subconsciously, mentally frowning. ‘<em>Wasn’t Yanjing just Nanjing? The ancient capital of the Six Dynasties in history, it was the place where she lived. How could she not remember? It’s just that the ancient and modern names were just different. Bah!’</em></p>
<p>As the thick fog cleared, she sailed down and flew through the streets of Yanjing, as if she had wings; the red flowery lanterns and high eaves flashing before her eyes until she faced the Imperial Palace, standing imposingly with its vermillion walls and yellow tiles. As she stood there, the Imperial Gates opened. And down there was a line of palace men with their heads bowed, as if in greeting.</p>
<p>She flew forward with a grin, coasting over the eight-level jade steps, only stopping before the Dragon Chair, seeing a person sitting on it.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah! The Emperor! </em><em>EH?! The Emperor?!’</em></p>
<p>This man, with his forehead supported by his hand, sleeping in broad daylight, was the Emperor. ‘<em>What the—’ </em>Hua Chun was dumbfounded, to think she’d see the day where the same Emperor who tyrannically ordered her to be beaten would have the countenance of an angel as he slept.</p>
<p>Curious, Hua Chun floats closer, her eyes roaming across his features. ‘<em>You know… The Emperor did not look all that bad.’ </em>His eyelashes were long, dark, and thick — like a small brush. And when his eyes were closed, he didn’t look as frightening as he usually did. His well-built body was like a sculpture, which tempted Hua Chun to reach out and touch his firm muscles.</p>
<p>However, before she could get any closer, Yu Wenjie suddenly opened his eyes, quickly narrowing into a fierce glare, scaring Hua Chun to death. It felt like her heart leaped into her throat, and she couldn’t move at all. She felt like she was falling, drowning.</p>
<p>And with that, Hua Chun woke up.</p>
<p>Confused, she sat up with her eyes open, slowly roving them across her surroundings. She was still in bed. She didn’t go anywhere. Yet…</p>
<p>It all felt so real…</p>
<p>Feeling the coolness of sweat upon her back, Hua Chun continued to sit in a daze, speechless.</p>
