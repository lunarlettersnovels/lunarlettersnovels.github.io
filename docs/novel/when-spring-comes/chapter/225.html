            <p><strong>Chapter 12 –  The Emperor is in a Good Mood (2)</strong></p>
<p>Once the last official gave his report, Grand Preceptor Tang could not help but raise his voice, fearing that the Emperor would end the court session: “Does the Prime Minister have anything to say?”</p>
<p>At those words, all eyes deliberately focused on her form, causing her to feel a phantom sweat drop travel down the side of her face. ’<em>Eh, Grand Preceptor?! Isn’t this a case of driving a duck onto a perch?’*</em></p>
<p>With a small reluctant smile, Hua Chun pushed herself off of her seat, one hand covering her waist. “This lowly official does have something to say, Your Majesty. But… it is better to wait until the end of the morning court. This lowly one suggests waiting until Your Majesty proceeds to the royal study before we speak on the matter.”</p>
<p>At the suggestion, Yu Wenjie could not help but frown. “From time immemorial, the Imperial Court has been the domain wherein important matters are discussed. What important matters must the Prime Minister discuss after this morning session?”</p>
<p>At that, Hua Chun smiled and raised her arms, forming one hand into a fist which she placed right against her open palm, bowing solemnly at the waist. “It is true, Your Majesty, that the court is the place for discussion, but the matters which your humble servant has to present concerns the Imperial Harem. Therefore, it will only be appropriate to wait for the right time and venue.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yu Wenjie intoned, raising an eyebrow in intrigue. <em>The Prime Minister has suddenly earned a glib tongue… How interesting.</em> Narrowing his eyes at the small bowing form, the Emperor’s lips curled into a sneer. “Since the Prime Minister also feels that the matters of the Inner Courts should not be interfered with by officials, why bother to report to me? The harem is my house. The Back Palace is my home, and you are my Prime Minister, not my steward.”</p>
<p>Hearing those words, Hua Chun did not dare to raise her head. ’<em>The Emperor is so fierce!’</em> She commented to herself as she felt a cold wave rush down her back. But she could not help it. It was a setting in this world. As long as it was Prime Minister Hua, the Emperor will always carry gunpowder in his words. Even if his words are subtle and decent, the Emperor will still breathe fire in response.</p>
<p>Strangely, Hua Chun felt disappointed upon realizing that fact. ’<em>No matter what I do… In the Emperor’s eyes, I would be wrong.’</em> Frowning, Hua Chun bit back a sigh. ’<em>At least, with this, I don’t have to worry about being too respectful.’</em></p>
<p>Steeling herself, Hua Chun quickly forced herself to kneel. Ignoring the pain from her injuries, Hua Chun spoke out, her voice hoarse. “Your Majesty, those words are inappropriate! Although the Inner Court is Your Majesty’s home, it is also the home of the world. Just as the Empress is called the Mother of the World, the Inner Courts’ affairs are also related to the people of the world. All matters related to the people are considered important by us lowly officials. Thus, we shall readily serve.”</p>
<p>Pausing, Hua Chun took a fleeting glance at the emperor’s form before solemnly lowering her head. “But, as the saying goes, family matters must not be made public. Thus, this lowly official humbly requests Your Majesty to discuss these matters in private. Please, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p><em>‘Let us see how you respond to that, Yu Wenjie</em>.’ Hua Chun thought to herself, internally donning on a smug smile. Her words were not remiss, nor were they disrespectful. Quite frankly, it had the tiniest bit of logic in it, as well. All her previous skills were not for naught.</p>
<p>Previously, in modern times, she dabbled in the field of politics. Although she quickly left after a short period, she did not lose the skills she gained – such as persuasion and eloquence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as she was speaking, Yu Wenjie continued to stare at her with a blank expression, his brown eyes glued to her form, as he leaned lazily against one side of his throne, his chin propped up by his hand.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Grand Preceptor Tang and the other officials could not help but lower their heads in fear. In their minds, they could not help but lament the familiar sight of the Emperor and the Prime Minister butting heads. Although the Prime Minister’s manner of speaking today was much better than before, who can guess what the Emperor was thinking? They truly feared that the Emperor was upset by the Prime Minister’s words.</p>
<p>With that, silence settled upon the vast court hall, yet again. Within this time, Hua Chun did not move from her position, her teeth gritting from the pain of it. Thus, when the Emperor’s voice sounded, Hua Chun could not help but feel relieved. ’<em>No matter if it is a rejection or not, at least let me stand!’</em> She cried out in her heart while keeping her head bowed, conveniently hiding her impatient expression.</p>
<p>But, contrary to her thoughts, once she registered the Emperor’s words, she could not help but be shocked.</p>
