            <p><strong>Chapter 52 – Humble Servant (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Don’t move!” Yu Wenjie whisper-shouted, holding her collar whilst sporting an ugly, disgusted expression. “Don’t you know how to change your clothes by yourself?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can!” Hua Chun felt like she was about to cry at this point. “I think that I could do it on my own all of a sudden. Please watch your temper, Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>He Chang’an felt funny about this situation, so he finally decided to lend the emperor a hand, saying, “Take it easy. The Prime Minister just meant to play a joke on you. It’s not a valid reason for an emperor to help his courtier change clothes.”</p>
<p>Letting go of the buttons on Hua Jinghua’s clothes, the emperor narrowed his eyes before replying, “Do it as quickly as you can. Don’t worry about the manners between the lord and his men. However, if you move as slow as a girl, don’t blame me for treating you rudely.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun felt too frightened to stand still. Therefore, she hurried to the back of the screen beside with the clothes in her arms. There, she took off the gown quickly and put on the indigo robe in her hands.</p>
<p>Her undergarment was even thinner than the emperor’s, and her corset was plain to see once she took off the gown. It was a relief that He Chang’an helped her out of the dilemma. The emperor would have doubted her if she had changed clothes in front of him. Did it sound reasonable that she chose to use that thing to make her pecs obscure.</p>
<p><em>‘What a joke!’</em></p>
<p>However, just as the people in the ancient times used to put on many clothes, they would not die from the heat in hot weather if they wore thin underwear.</p>
<p>Hua Chun went out to stand by the emperor’s side after changing her clothes.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie promptly gave her a cloak. Each of them had packed themselves up and put on hats. Then Eunuch Qin then led them into the carriage, and they left the palace by a track.</p>
<p>“Mind the way you call yourself out of the palace,” said the emperor while they were in the carriage. “Just call me master.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord.” Hua Chun didn’t feel all that stressed about the sudden name change, for in the first place, she was unaccustomed to using honorifics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, He Chang’an seemed to be in a good mood. He looked at the walls of the palace outside the windows before asking the emperor.“Are you sure that we won’t be in danger outside?”</p>
<p>It was more dangerous outside than it was inside the palace. Hua Chun was curious about this, too. But as he was the emperor, how could he go out without much discretion?</p>
<p>At this, Yu Wenjie said, “Save yourself when in danger.”</p>
<p><em>‘What?’ </em>Hua Chun was stunned and turned around to look at him. Then she looked back at He Chang’an.</p>
<p>She had remembered that the emperor was good at kung fu. And, in terms of He Chang’an, it was evident that he had practiced martial arts from the blue veins in his hands, although he had a pretty exterior. Then, the question was whether Hua Jinghua knew how to fight.</p>
<p>The answer was no. Even if Hua Jinghua did, Hua Chun knew nothing about kung fu. Therefore, the emperor’s words might have just been permission for her to die when in danger.</p>
<p>She felt so bad. Why did he want her to go with them even though it was obviously dangerous? Was it true that it was everyone’s duty to care for the Prime Minister? There would be a mess in the court if she wasn’t there!</p>
<p>Looking at the emperor with apparent hesitation, Hua Chun didn’t have the nerve to say anything to him. All she could do was look at He Chang’an with an innocent expression and said, “My Duke, I know nothing about kung fu.”</p>
<p>“Just call me Chang’an,” said He Chang’an. “And it’s okay. I will protect you.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun felt so moved that she chose not to pay attention to the issue of homosexuality anymore. She would treat He Chang’an as a close friend whom she would do anything for, considering those words from him.</p>
<p>The emperor laughed slightly as he gracefully stayed on his seat. Although he had taken off the imperial robe and put an ordinary cloth on, there was still a strong temperament of the emperor evident in Yu Wenjie. Hua Chun had looked at him for a few times, but still didn’t have the nerve to tell him the truth.</p>
<p>In addition to this, it was evident that He Chang’an had figured the problem out. Touching his chin, he stared at the emperor and asked Hua Chun, “Do you know how to make the master look plain?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Hua Chun said with hesitation, “but the master wouldn’t want to try it.”</p>
<p>His lofty figure and outstanding face would immediately be noticed once getting out the palace gate. He would be a moving landmark in the street. She didn’t know what they were going out for, but it was clear that their purpose was not to draw attention.</p>
<p>“I could do as you suggest,” said Yu Wenjie in a low voice. “Today, there is no difference between an emperor and his official. I would get over any offensive behavior of yours.”</p>
<p>Perfect. Hua Chun was relieved. She had finally mustered enough courage.“Then it’s simple. Go to a rogue shop after leaving the palace and I’ll handle this problem.”</p>
<p>The emperor was in doubt. He thought,‘<em>A rouge shop?’</em></p>
<p>He Chang’an raised his eyebrows and looked at her with curiosity, “Can you do make-up?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” Hua Chun answered naturally. It was a must to do make up every day, as it was needed in the world of work.</p>
<p>However, she soon realized that she was a man now and had to act accordingly. Thus, she said immediately, “I usually do make up for my mother. Practice makes perfect.”</p>
<p>It was evident how Yu Wenjie thought of her by his eyes. Hua Chun paid no attention to it. He evidently thought she was too feminine for his own comfort.</p>
<p><em>‘So what? I don’t care.’ </em>Hua Chun pursed her lips, dropped her head and said no more.<br>
