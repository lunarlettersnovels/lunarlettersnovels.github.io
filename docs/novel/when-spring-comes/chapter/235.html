            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 2 – The God You Called Is Online (2)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of Xuanzheng Hall, Yu Wenjie looked at the fainted Hua Chun on the bench with an expressionless face. The Duke Quin secretly glanced at him and then folded his hands and asked, “Your Majesty, do you still want to continue to blame the unconscious prime minister?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enchanting concubine pursed her lips and told the Emperor, “Your Majesty, the Prime Minister should already know by now that he was wrong. How about we let him go?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person had already fainted and if the emperor continuedly punish the poor prime minister, he will truly take the name of a tyrant. Several veteran officials knelt and shed tears as they have run out of words to persuade the emperor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emperor’s moodiness today made a lot of people worry about the future of the country. Prime Minister Hua was one of the few people who dared to speak out. But if he was beaten so hard, the old officials worry the young minister would never dare to speak out ever again.  How will the king know his gains and loses? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s enough.” Glancing at the kneeling people, the emperor on the steps finally said, “Help the prime minister to go back home and rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was relieved including a trembling old man in his sixties to seventies. He stood up and automatically went over and lifted the young and severely punished Prime minister on the bench and went outside the palace together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Hua Chun heard in her dreams was the sighs of many people, one after the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun sniffed. She does not care what these people were worried about, all she wanted was to have a good sleep hoping the pain will go away when she woke up. However, it was a fact that all things in life have their cause and effect, and because she had been hit by the road more than a dozen times, Hua Chun was awakened by pain in the afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hiss!” Hua Chun took a breath and opened her eyes to see a teary face in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My son, you finally woke up!” Wan Liufang squeezed her handkerchief and took her hand. “Does it still hurt?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What nonsense is she speaking?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hua Chun thought. Could she wake up and feel no pain at all after being whipped?! As she looked at the person dressed in an ancient costume and the room around her, she was struck with familiarity once more. She could not help but whisper, “Am I dreaming?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Liufang was taken aback and the tears flowed from her eyes. She turned her head and said to the person standing in the middle of the room: “Master, my son has been beaten to the point of delusion! The Emperor is too unjust!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun: “…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master Hua sighed; his thin face was full of helplessness. He looked at her and said, “You should understand that the Prime Minister must regard the emperor as his heaven. And even if the emperor misjudges, one should not be resentful. Do you understand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun subconsciously nodded.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I with the Prime Minister’s family?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hua Chun wondered. This room was clearly the Prime Minister’s in the residence. It appeared in the first episode. The Prime Minister’s biological mother was from the Wan Clan and Master Hua was the biological father. The man spoke anciently, as if he were reading from a script.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why was there no director and cameras around?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hua Chun could not help and asked Wan Liufang, “Can you give me a mirror?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan Shi was stunned then took the bronze mirror on top of the table beside her bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handsome face that she liked so much appeared in the mirror. When she opened her mouth, he also opened his. She raised her eyebrows and he followed suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After laughing in disbelief, Hua Chun buried her face in the pillow and took a deep breath and said, “I want to be alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This..?” Wan Shi frowned and looked at her. After thinking about it, she got up and said, “Then you should take a good rest and your mother will depart.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.” Hua Chun responded dully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a sigh, Wan Shi took one last look at her daughter and waved the servants out of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing the sound of the door closing, Hua Chun covered her mouth and finally screamed: “AGH!!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, my God!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There is nothing wrong with the prime minister’s face, but what kind of evil had she committed that she had become a man?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After having been single for twenty-five years, she really wanted to taste of a man very much, but not become one! How should she adapt to this sudden change, with no bosom on her chest and a beast on her lower body?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After roaring ten thousand times in her heart, Hua Chun tried to think rationally. Despite the situation, she stretched out her hand and touched the bottom of her body immediately. It became the first thing she did as a man.</span></p>
