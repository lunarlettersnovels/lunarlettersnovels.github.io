            <p><strong>Chapter 27 – Caught in Humiliation (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>‘What?’</em></p>
<p>The emperor frowned and glanced at Hua Chun.</p>
<p>Naturally, as the one appointed to present, Hua Chun was deprived of food and after talking for a long time, she was overcome with hunger. Seeing that the emperor didn’t intend to hold a banquet, Hua Chun could not help but sneak a piece from the dried fish in her sleeve.</p>
<p>She glanced at the emperor from the corner of her eyes as she stealthily moved her hands toward her sleeve, hastily twisting a chunk of dried fish, and tilted her head to the other side to feed herself while the emperor’s attention was not upon her. Then, she turned around casually.</p>
<p>She had mastered this kind of trick when she wanted to eat snacks in class back when she was a child.</p>
<p>Chewing lightly, Hua Chun looked down at the paper on the table. Seeing that the emperor hadn’t spoken or moved, he thought he was immersed in thought, so she stuffed another piece into her mouth with confidence.</p>
<p><em>‘Wan-shi was right, this dried fish is really fragrant and delicious!’ </em>she beamed inwardly.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of Yu Wenjie’s eyes, he noticed her subtle movements, and saw her sneaking like a thief. Her eyes were bright and her fingers were white and slender. But with some oil.</p>
<p>No, this is not the point. He could not believe that the dignified prime minister had brought snacks to Zǐchen Hall and secretly ate in front of everybody.</p>
<p><em>‘Sissy really is a sissy! How many men did this behavior?’</em></p>
<p>The emperor felt disgust deep in his heart, but as he cast a glance outside the wide windows, he saw it was already late. Huan Shu had been talking for so long, and her proposal was quite useful. He couldn’t care about ordering small fish, right?</p>
<p>After enduring it for a while, Yu Wenjie calmly said, “If this matter can be implemented, I will give a reward, and I hope the Prime Minister will do his best.”</p>
<p>As the emperor spoke of a reward, Hua Chun immediately became enthusiastic and quickly rubbed the oil on her hands on her clothes. Seated in a precarious manner, she looked at the emperor and said, “Can the Minister dare to ask the Emperor for grace?” He moved to the other side, and Yu Wenjie frowned and looked at him. “What kind of grace do you want?”</p>
<p>“My mother raised the Minister for more than twenty years. I haven’t enjoyed any good fortune yet,” Hua chun said seriously. “The Minister wants to do his filial piety to help his mother fulfill a wish. I wonder if the Emperor can agree?”</p>
<p>“You have to do your best, why do I have to agree?” replied Yu Wenjie.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Hua chun said solemnly, “The Emperor is the Son of Heavens, and if the Emperor does not allow it, no ministers or others dare to be the masters without Your Majesty’s permission. The mother’s wish is not very difficult. She only desires that I find peace in my heart and mind, and have a home to be healthy.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie fell in thought. Should an emperor try his best to satisfy such ordinary desires?</p>
<p>“To have a heart at ease in an adequate home and the family to be well. This is indeed a very common wish,” Hua Chun continued.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, Yu Wenjie nodded. “As long as you don’t involve others. Use your own strength and don’t violate the national laws and family rules. If you want to do it, then do it.”</p>
<p>Immediately, Hua Chun’s eyes lit up. She cheerfully rose from her seat and gestured a salute toward the emperor. “Thank you, Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>It was enough for Hua Chun, who had only been bluffing with the last few of her words. Indeed, her mother wished for a large home, but that reason itself wasn’t enough. <em>‘People, you have to be artful with the way you speak! See, clever words attract desirable favor.’</em></p>
<p>However, when Yu Wenjie didn’t react, Hua Chun wanted to flee the room.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister,” Yu Wenjie suddenly voiced.</p>
<p>“The Minister is here.” Hua Chun was taken aback. She turned and arched her hands, “What else does the Emperor have to order?”</p>
<p>Leaning on the back of the chair, Yu Wenjie stared at her and said, “Do you think it’s boring and hungry to come to accompany me to discuss matters?”<br>
