            <p><strong>Chapter 28 – Caught in Humiliation (2)</strong></p>
<p>As Hua Chun’s heart fluttered in panic, she immediately replied, “As a Prime Minister, I do not have the slightest dissatisfaction nor slack!” And as if her words sounded inadequate, she became a flatterer. She opened her mouth and said, “With the Emperor’s prestige in front, the Minister will not be hungry or weary. As long as he can share his worries for the Emperor, the Minister will do everything!” Her sonorous voice sounded throughout the vast room.</p>
<p>Upon hearing her dramatic excuse, the emperor seemed to be a little moved. His gaze remained fixated at her for a while, and soon he said, “I understand the Prime Minister’s loyalty, but it is not a good thing to pollute this Zǐchen Hall.”</p>
<p><em>‘What?’</em> Huachun was at a loss. Then, she followed the emperor’s eyes which landed at her seat and instantly became mortified. <em>‘The smell of mother‘s dried fish leaked out!’</em></p>
<p>She was too hurried to pay attention, unaware that bits of her lovely and spicy dried fish were scattered along her chair and the ground, making the scene humiliating and awkward.</p>
<p>Hua Chun peeked at the emperor’s expression. He didn’t seem to be angry, but calmly reminded her of the fact that something fell out. Frozen on her spot for a long while, Hua Chun moved carefully, took a paper bag from his sleeve, and wrapped the dried fish with it.</p>
<p>“I don’t like people who speak empty words.” Looking at her, Yu Wenjie said indifferently, “Just do what you should do.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun pursed her lips. This emperor is too naive. What is empty talk? Everyone is willing to listen to good things. Even if the words were fake, the audience feels better than hearing a straightforward, harsh truth.</p>
<p>The mentor who taught her before said that the people who live best in the world are never good people, but sly men, who talk like a devil. Even if one cannot be a good samaritan, he will encounter lesser difficulties.</p>
<p>But the emperor, above ten thousand people, has the right to be willful, and no one can control what he says. She was the only minister at the moment, but she folded her hands and responded with a smile, “Wēi chén* understands.”</p>
<p>Since half an hour ago, the rain poured heavily. Hua Chun left the Zǐchen Hall, but as she glimpsed outside the sky was already dark and thunder roared.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister,” Duke Qin looked at him embarrassedly. “The rain is too heavy. It’s not easy to go if the gate is flooded. Why don’t you take a rest in the side hall next to you? Wait for the palace staff to clear the rain before leaving.”</p>
<p>The drainage system in the vicinity also needed reparation. This rendered Hua Chun speechless, but after little thought, Hua Chun agreed. Duke Qin nodded and asked a eunuch to take her to the side hall, and then went into the front hall to report.</p>
<p>“He’s gone?” Yu Wenjie asked with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>Duke Qin divulged, “The outside is flooded, and the Prime Minister can’t leave the palace temporarily. The Duke asked him to rest in the side hall and wait for the rain to lighten before leaving.”</p>
<p>The emperor opened his eyes and looked outside without a word. A moment later, he asked someone to arrange dinner in the back hall of Zǐchen Hall.</p>
<p>He is still delighted to starve him and let the <em>sissy</em> suffer a little bit more. Prime Minister Hua seemed to have become a lot gentler recently. Although he was not as annoying as before, he was still quite annoying.</p>
<p><em>‘Let him stay in the cold side hall.’</em></p>
<p>Yu Wenjie rose from his seat and headed toward the apse. The wind blew violently and the rain poured strongly. Even if the eunuch held an umbrella above him, he would still be soaked from the rain.</p>
<p>“This kind of weather is uncanningly similar to three years ago.” His eyes sweeped the dark. Feeling the cold rain, he whispered, “Even the killing intent in the air is so familiar.”</p>
