            <h4><strong>Chapter 21 – Hua Jinghua’s Thoughts (2)</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father, Mother.” Hua Chun greeted them as soon as she stepped into the door, feeling a little strange as she bowed down.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Have I watched too many ancient dramas? Why does paying respects feel so natural?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan-shi seemed to be still angry. Master Hua calmed down when he saw her coming, “My son, come and sit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table in the middle of the front hall was huge, but the dishes were placed in front of each other. Each person had six small dishes, which looked clean and decent, and it was charming to have people at the same table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun nodded, touched her aching behind, and sat down carefully on the stool. Because of the pain, there was absolutely no other way to be elegant. Her actions were even a bit funny and ridiculous. Ren, who was seated next to her, covered his mouth and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wan-shi’s eyes flew past like a knife, “Is this amusing to you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lady Shi, please calm down.” Ren said with a smile, “I didn’t mean anything else; I just thought the weather was good today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, really?” Wan-shi snarled as she raised her chin. After a moment, she bowed her head, resolutely staring down at the fine china as she adopted an elegant demeanor. “The barefoot can’t laugh at those with shoes, and those who can’t give birth to sons can still laugh at other people’s sons?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ren, for a moment, glanced at muffled Master Hua, and wiped her mouth with a handkerchief without a smile. “Hasn’t Lady Wan-shi heard of the saying: There is no joy giving birth to a son, neither sorrow in giving birth to a daughter? Wei Zifu still dominated the world, what’s wrong with having a daughter who lived in the palace with a high rank. She will not be punished and tortured by the court.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, he glanced at Hua Chun. He said, “The Hua family’s generations were Zhongliang, and the Prime Minister was the first one who got a high position in front of the court, which was remarkable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a curl of her lips, Aunt Fu could not help but add: “It was a shame to be blamed and punished in court in front of so many people. If it were an old man with low endurance, he would have to hang himself when he went back. Fortunately, the Empress Dowager asked the Emperor for a personal visit and gave the Hua family a story down, otherwise?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You!” With Wan-shi’s violent temper, she could no longer bear such words. She immediately slammed her hand on the table and stood up, her eyes glinting with hatred. She was about to lose her temper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Enough!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master Hua, who had been silent, always played a role during critical moments. With a deep roar, Wan-shi slowly calmed herself down and sat down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun turned her head and looked at this man, thin-faced, similar to her father in real life. Although his clothes and paraphernalia were made of countless exceptional gifts, he appeared gentle and not intimidating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the weight of the world was so heavy on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Master Hua looked at each and everyone at the table, they all bowed down their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After all the arguments that you two have delved in, you still have not laid rest to your feud?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Zhengrong glanced at Wan-shi and Ren, “Each one of you has a good point, but how can matters be resolved with your voices high?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My Lord.” Wan-shi said in a low voice, “She started it first!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s sad that the concubines are reckless.” Wan-shi rolled her eyes and said, “If they wouldn’t bring up about giving birth to son’s and daughter’s every time, then I would not have reacted this much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continued, smiling angrily, “By what means did you send the second young lady into the palace? Do you think others don’t know about it? And you are still proud of it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was no trick used. It is an indisputable fact that Senior Concubine Hua was better than the young master. If she hadn’t persuaded the Emperor time the Prime Minister was beaten to death, could the master still have his life back?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a loud brawl again. Hua Chun secretly picked up two chopsticks and stuffed food into her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you say you are better than the second lady, how come she doesn’t get rewarded? She was the only one who stayed in the palace, but the Emperor gave nothing! If it hadn’t for my son, your nephew would be handed in marriage.”</span></p>
