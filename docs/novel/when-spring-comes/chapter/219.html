            <p><strong>Chapter 18 – The Hua Family Yard (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Mother.”</p>
<p>Shaken by her roar, Hua Chun saluted and greeted her decently, “Why are you at the door?”</p>
<p>Wan-Shi* smiled and extended out her hand and walked towards the mansion: “Can’t your mother be worried about what happened to you? Just wait here.”</p>
<p>Looking at her twice, Hua Chun felt a bad premonition in her heart.</p>
<p>This lady Wan-shi also appeared in the first episode. Her costly dress and beautiful eyes were enough to impress the audience. Not to mention that afterward, the lady stood at the door of the courtyard of the prime minister, put her hand on her waist, and yelled at Concubine Ji outside.</p>
<p>“If you can, you can have a son too! A smarter son! Don’t take porcelain work. If you are dissatisfied with your old lady, you’ll have to hold back your anger and go!”</p>
<p>Those words roared drastically that left Concubine Ji shocked, daring not to say another word.</p>
<p>Hua Chun fondly watched the TV series, but when she really came in to be her son, her heartbeat felt like the sound of a loud drum.</p>
<p>According to the general TV set, the more striking people are, the sooner they die. Thus it was better to keep a low profile.</p>
<p>“Come on. Come, and see.” Wan-shi held Hua Chun’s hand with so much joy. “Seeing that you are alright, it is the right time to plan the repair of our mansion. You are already the Prime Minister. Why are we still huddled in this little yard? This time, the Emperor believed in you. The construction of this mansion will be paid and funded by the court so that we don’t have to save and spend some money.”</p>
<p><em>‘What?’</em> Shocked, Hua Chun felt that it was a foolish idea. ‘<em>The need to rebuild their yard? For her and Wan-shi?’</em></p>
<p>Hua Chun’s body felt like it froze. When she clearly remembered what she had just promised the Emperor, she did not continue to walk inside the mansion.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Wan-shi turned around and looked at her curiosity. “Don’t you want to have a look? Does your bottom still hurt?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then what are you waiting for?” Wan-shi said as she reached out to pat Hua Chun’s shoulder, giving her ‘son’ a wink. “The land is huge, larger than the yard of the months in the house put together, enough for you to live until you get married and move to the prime minister’s office.”</p>
<p>Grimacing, Hua Chun carefully looked up at her, “Does this yard have to be repaired?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” With her eyes wide open, Wan-shi frowned and looked at her. “What happened today? Why do you ask such a question? Weren’t you the one who said that being a Prime Minister was not easy, and if you become one, you will remain loyal to your mother?”</p>
<p>Hua Chun was silent.</p>
<p>The plot of this episode was definitely hidden. It was not properly broadcast, causing her to fall into the way of the Senior Concubine Hua! No wonder the poor concubine was asked not to repair the backyard of the Hua family. Prime Minister, Wan-shi, and the Hua family were enemies at all, and we’re just the opposite.</p>
<p>No wonder Grand Preceptor Tang and Grand Secretary Li had such expressions. No wonder they said that Hua Chun sacrificed her happiness for the people. Hua Chun herself was moved by what had happened.</p>
<p>And this sacrifice, it had not been discussed with Wan-shi.</p>
<p>Looking at Wan-shi’s surprised expression, Hua Chun swallowed and pondered for a while before she carefully opened her mouth and said, “Mother, there is something I want to discuss with you.”</p>
<p>Wan-shi was also keen. One look at her daughter’s face and she knew that the matter was important. “Say it.”</p>
<p>“Our backyard may not be repaired temporarily. Today, I asked the good Emperor for disaster relief and postponed the repair of Yong-An temple. When Senior Concubine Hua knew, she was disheartened. So she said that the backyard of the Hua family would also be suspended, and I agreed.”</p>
<p>Wan-shi’s eyes widened in disbelief. She took a deep breath and put her hands on the side of her hips. She was like a dragon that is about to spit fire.</p>
<p>Hua Chun immediately covered her ears!</p>

<p>T/N: <em>*Shi (suffix) – Shi is a suffix/appellation added to a married woman’s original last name to indicate that they are from that family. Example: Mr. Hua married Ms. Wan. Ms. Wan will now go by Wan-shi instead of Mrs. Wan.</em></p>
