            <p><strong>Chapter 55 – Clash in Daylight (2)</strong></p>
<p>“You don’t need to feel too nervous.” He Chang’an took the wine handed over by Xiao Er and poured a bowl for the three of them boldly. “The wine here comes from the most fragrant family in Yanjing. I think they should become brothers with Brother Jinghua. ”</p>
<p><em>’Huh?’</em> Hua Chun stared at him blankly.</p>
<p>The emperor also turned his head and looked at him with a frown. “What nonsense are you talking about again?”</p>
<p>“It’s not nonsense. I’m being serious.” He Chang’an looked solemn. “The Prime Minister Hua has both knowledge and personality, and being able to worship is a blessing.”</p>
<p>At this, Hua Chun laughed.</p>
<p>With Hua Jinghua’s identity, she could only worship a man as a brother in this life. Gong Yuhou was the celebrity in front of the emperor, and also the distinguished Lord Hou. Becoming brothers with him was only equivalent to finding a backer. She had to make sure she did not suffer any losses.</p>
<p>After figuring this out, Hua Chun straightened up the wine in front of her. “What vows do you want to say?”</p>
<p>He Chang’an smiled and asked Xiao Er to take the scissors, and naturally, he reached out and cut a piece of her dress.</p>
<p>“The brother-in-law is a brother, and the rest of the vows are unnecessary.” As he spoke, he also cut a piece of his own clothes, folded the two pieces of cloth together, cut it again, divided it into two halves, tied it with a string, and handed it to her.</p>
<p>“I’m older, so I can barely be your second brother.” He Chang’an told her. “Except for formal occasions, in the future, virtuous brothers can be called second brothers directly.”</p>
<p>“Good!” Hua Chun happily replied, squeezing the fabric in her hands. After putting it away, she turned back to him, looking doubtful. “Why are you only the second brother?”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie remained silent, his face turning pale.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s like this.” He Chang’an smiled and put his hand on the emperor’s shoulder: “I have also bowed to the second master. He is currently the eldest brother, so I can only be the second brother.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun went silent.</p>
<p>The ceremony of worshipping the beams was prevalent. According to the rule, two people did worship, and one of them would worship with the others. The relationship of worship was indeed a common practice.</p>
<p>She felt that the backing of Gong Yuhou was powerful enough. However, in the end, she also ended up gaining a hidden big brother who constantly pressured her, and who reminded her of the saying, “through a cloud-piercing arrow, thousands of horses will meet each other.”</p>
<p>However, the emperor didn’t seem to appreciate it. He looked at her coldly, with an expression that was as ugly as a fried fish.</p>
<p>Shrinking her neck, Hua Chun felt very innocent. It was Gong Yuhou’s request to be worshipped, and it wasn’t she that insisted on getting involved. Could he possibly blame her?</p>
<p>“Okay, you should also relax.” He Chang’an looked at the emperor. “They are all people of one standpoint, why bother being so tit-for-tat about it?”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie didn’t seem to want to worship Hua Chun, and He Chang’an also wanted to reconcile the relationship between the emperor and the prime minister. After all, the emperor had not yet secured his seat on the throne. There were loyal ministers like Prime Minister Hua, however. Where was there any reason to extrapolate?</p>
<p>Although he knew Yu Wenjie’s temperament, the typical “those who follow me prosper against me will perish” attitude, being able to stay in Jinghua had been regarded as the most benevolent. But if he could be more harmonious and consistent with the outside world, then he wouldn’t mind being the peacemaker.</p>
<p>The emperor actually understood his thoughts, but… he couldn’t bear to have a man like Hua Jinghua be his brother!</p>
<p>Wasn’t it more appropriate to be a sibling?</p>
<p>Frowning and looking at the opposite person again, the emperor closed his eyes, took two deep breaths, and faintly said to He Chang’an, “It’s up to you.”</p>
<p>Did this mean he acquiesced to worship her as well? Hua Chun blinked and looked at He Chang’an, who happily raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p><em>’If you have bowed to your brother, you couldn’t kill her in a fit of anger, right?’ </em>Hua Chun thought cheerfully. Wasn’t there such a sentence? ‘<em>Do not seek to be born in the same year and on the same day, but to die in the same year and on the same day. To bow to the emperor is equivalent to having a gold medal for avoiding death.’</em></p>
<p>For a moment, she felt that they could be forgiven for dragging her out to her death today. However, before she could feel happy for too long, the cups of the people next to them fell to the ground and broke with a pop.</p>
<p>Hua Chun’s heart jumped.</p>
<p>There was a movement of a group of people going upstairs from the stairs of the building. He Chang’an and Yu Wenjie sat still, allowing more than 20 people to come up and surround their small table.</p>
<p>“Damn!” Hua Chun felt so scared that she quickly grabbed the window string next to him. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Do you still have to ask?” He Chang’an said, “Obviously, he’s trying to look for trouble with us.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun ‘s eyes widened at his reply. “What should I do then?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.” He Chang’an stood up and moved his joints. “Just wait for them.”</p>
<p>There were three tables of people on the second floor, including the one with the broken cups. The people at that table also belonged to the group of people coming upstairs, and the other two tables were all guards, directly guarding those situated in the middle.</p>
<p>The leader probably hadn’t expected them to be prepared, for he looked a little startled. Nevertheless, he waved his hand.</p>
<p>A group of people rushed towards them.</p>
<p>As a resident of the 21st century and the peace era, Hua Chun had not even participated in the group frame of elementary school students, let alone watched this kind of large-scale fighting in broad daylight. She immediately climbed up the table very confidently to avoid being surrounded by the whole lot of them.</p>
<p>He Chang’an had already rushed towards the crowd. Unexpectedly, it seemed that this posture was not about fighting, but like an eagle catching a chick. He would catch a person and throw him down on the floor.</p>
<p>The sound of the collision of swords and guns was fierce, but the guards brought by the emperor were having a good time. There were only eight people. They were not allowed to approach them, so that Yu Wenjie still pretended to continue sitting whilst drinking at the table.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Looking at the people on the table, the emperor spoke unhappily. “Come down, don’t embarrass me!”</p>
