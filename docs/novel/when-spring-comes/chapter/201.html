            <p><strong>Chapter 36 – An Act of Sheer Folly (1)</strong></p>
<p>Hua Jinghua was also a woman and had the same body as her, so was there anything worth her exploring and why was she so excited? Besides, she was Hua Jinghua. Why was she feeling nervous to see her own naked body? And, most importantly, it was not until today that Hua Jinghua would take a shower since she extended through time.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Hua Jinghua opened her hands and closed her eyes, allowing Pin Tan to remove her dirty gwanbok and underwear. A little cold, she felt tighter in her chest. In her mind, she was repeating the principle to respect Hua Jinghua’s privacy and not to pry on her body, fulfilling the duty of a law-abiding citizen.</p>
<p>However, when Pin Tan took off what was tied tightly in her chest, Hua Jinghua became shameless and opened her eyes with the sense of surging weight. <em>‘Oh my gosh!’ </em>She was thrown in excitement and almost bit her tongue upon catching sight of the figure reflected in the bronze mirror behind the screen.</p>
<p>“Master?” Pin Tan was testing the heat of the bathwater and glanced back, hearing the noise, “What happened?”</p>
<p>“No… nothing…” With her face overspread with the deepest blush, Hua Jinghua staggered along the wooden stairs and walked into the bathtub, covering her face with her hands.</p>
<p>Every woman would be confused by the same problem– the size of their breasts. Hua Chun had used millions of ways to make them fuller, but finally, she could only comfort herself with the saying that she that has big breasts couldn’t rule the country [a Chinese homophone]. Hers was a chest that could be likened to a board, or a port where planes landed.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hua had undoubtedly gone through a tough time pretending to be a male, she thought. The corset had squeezed her mounds into A cup, which would be thought to be muscles if touched by people who were oblivious of the truth.</p>
<p>She was too cruel to herself.</p>
<p>“Master.” Looking at her expression, Pin Tan comforted her as usual,” Don’t worry about it too much. Let’s wear something tighter next time and they will become smaller.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun was speechless. ‘<em>Smaller?’ </em>Who could understand her feelings right now? It was as though someone threw a delicious roast chicken into the dust bin in front of a man who was about to starve to death. That couldn’t be forgiven. She had made up her mind to give Prime Minister Hua a massage every night, making full use of her perfect figure.</p>
<p>Secretly resolved, Hua Jinghua began to wash her body carefully. Hua Jinghua was tall. Her skin was fair and hard. She even had abs. How did she manage to work out? No wonder she looked celibate. This skinny but powerful woman puts on many clothes every day to conceal her gender. It was strange if she wasn’t celibate. Heat rash would definitely rise on her body in summer.</p>
<p>After bathing, Pin Tan fetched a tighter corset and said, “Master, let’s begin.”</p>
<p>At this moment, Hua Chun seemed to hear the cries from her breasts. But what could she do? Hua Jinghua was meant to be a man all her life, or else, she would take offense to the emperor. In that case, she would lose her head, not to mention her breasts.</p>
<p>She stayed still, allowing Pin Tan to put it on her. Hua Chun resigned to go to bed. It was not easy to be a prime minister; she could only sleep for an hour and then needed to conduct official duties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the side yard, Aunt Ren had been angry for a long time, crying. She couldn’t bear it anymore so she wrote a letter and sent someone to deliver it to Liuying in the palace. It was so unfair. Why did that stupid woman benefit so much? If the yard was furnished, she would be proud of it for a while. The letter was full of cries and accusations. Ren-shi had taken no consideration of the influence of domestic conflicts, sparing no efforts to accuse Wan-shi and her son with inflated claims.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie was surprised by the unexpected wails outside while he was playing chess with He Chang’an joyfully.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty!” Hua Liuying cried, paying no heed to her ruined makeup. She knelt down, tears staining her face, “I beg you to do me justice!”</p>
<p>Frowning slightly, Yu Wenjie looked at Eunuch Qin, who immediately understood his glance and brought Noble Consort Hua in.</p>
<p>“What wrong?”</p>
<p>Hua Liuying stopped her crying when she caught sight of the emperor. She knelt down once again and spoke in a dejected tone, “I’ve heard that Your Majesty has presented Prime Minister Hua the grace to allow the Hua family to furnish their backyard. Haven’t you said that the Hua backyard wouldn’t be furnished and neither would Yongan Hall? But why…?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” The emperor was still confused, wrinkles deepening in his forehead. He looked at her and asked, “When did I allow Prime Minister Hua to furnish his backyard?”<br>
