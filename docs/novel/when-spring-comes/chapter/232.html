            <p><strong>Chapter 5 – The Fancy Shield</strong></p>
<p>After pondering, Hua Chun asked the servant, “Where are all the people in this house? Why haven’t they come and see me?”</p>
<p>Pin Tan said, “Replying to the Young Master, The Third Young Miss is still in school, and the Fourth Young Miss has still not come back after going out. As for the Fifth Young Master…”</p>
<p>At this point, Pin Tan paused, hesitating with her words before she shook her head.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to count on it. It would be good if he doesn’t come.”</p>
<p>Nodding absentmindedly, Hua Chun turned her gaze away from the servant girl, quietly digesting her words. With that one reply, she had gleaned a lot of information. First, there were men in the Hua family, but they did not seem cordial with Prime Minister Hua. Second, this body had two younger sisters, but it seemed they weren’t very harmonious either.</p>
<p><em>“Eh? Then… Did Prime Minister Hua disguise herself as a man because she wanted power?’</em></p>
<p>“Hmm…” She breathed out, her hand reaching up to rub her chin as she mulled over that thought.</p>
<p><em>‘That… Considering the situation, that possibility was high.’</em></p>
<p>Dropping her hand from her chin, she nodded. It just so happened that the major she studied at school was the same as that of Prime Minister Hua’s work. With this, she could at least continue her male god’s work… err… Goddess?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>While Hua Chun was lost in her thoughts, several guests had arrived at the Hua Mansion and were now outside her door. They had even already announced their arrival.</p>
<p>One by one, the senior court officials of the imperial court stepped through her door, each with gray beards and withered hair — the perfect image of wise old men. Yet, when they saw her figure, they knelt as if they had seen some God.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister!”</p>
<p>“Prime Minister! You should get better soon. There is no country without a king. And so, there court without you, ah!”</p>
<p><em>‘Eh, those words… Aren’t they pleasing to hear?’</em> Hua Chun mentally scolded herself at the thought. How pretentious of her! Refocusing on the current situation, Hua Chun focused her gaze on the officials and hurriedly reached out her hand, her voice anxious. “Elders, please. Be seated, and may this one know why all of you have come?”</p>
<p><em>‘Bah! Stand up! Please!’</em></p>
<p>Seeing all these old men kneeling before her, she really did feel like she was about to lose her life. However, looking at them, Hua Chun felt inexplicably moved. These old people had that kind of Chinese characteristic that she always read about, where every grain of their being radiated loyalty. Everyone under the heavens and earth could learn from them!</p>
<p>One official, Grand Preceptor Tang, stood and stepped forward, cupping his hands in obeisance as he gave a slight bow. “This official asks for the Prime Minister’s heart to not be chilled towards today’s affairs.”</p>
<p>As if on cue, the other officials stood and copied his actions.</p>
<p>“These officials have already gone to the Empress Dowager and pleaded for her to reprimand the Emperor for what he did today. The Prime Minister’s righteousness is well known all over the world!”</p>
<p>“With these actions, we hope that the Prime Minister will continue to still assist our Majesty. So, that the world will stay harmonious, and the people will live in peace!”</p>
<p>These words moved Hua Chun so badly that she immediately opened her mouth and said, “Your Excellencies, be at ease! As soon as my wounds heal, this official will be back to work. This official will continue to give advice and assist our Emperor.”</p>
<p>With these words, the old men smiled with relief, finally straightening their backs, looking as if the whole world was taken off their shoulders. Then, one man took something from behind and gave it to Hua Chun.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister, this is a new booklet to be presented to the Emperor, please review and hand it over to His Majesty.”</p>
<p>Another man hurriedly stepped up and said, “I would like to ask the Prime Minister to tell His Majesty that the disaster in Huaibei can no longer be ignored. In this official’s eyes, it is best to put aside the palace’s repair and provide relief first. Prime Minister, please help!”</p>
<p>“Prime Minister!”</p>
<p>“Prime Minister!”</p>
<p>“…Please advise His Majesty to not expand the harem and save the expenses of the imperial palace. Instead, advised that he needs to fill the national treasury.”</p>
<p><em>‘Ha… Ha? Ha!?’ </em>Hua Chun felt stupid. <em>‘Aiya, what is this? These things…’ </em>They were all hot potatoes! And all of them were being thrown at her! She felt like she was about to vomit blood… No wonder these officials supported the prime minister so much! They were using her as a shield!</p>
<p>And with that, Hua Chun had become a shield. A very fancy shield.<br>
