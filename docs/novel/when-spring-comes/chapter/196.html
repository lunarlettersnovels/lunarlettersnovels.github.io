            <p><strong>Chapter 41 – Tit for Tat (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Hua Liuying deserves it.” Hua Chun closed the door and looked at Wan-shi, “I didn’t mean to set her up. We may have conflicts and we should solve them by ourselves. But we shouldn’t let others know of them. You shouldn’t have the thought that if you are insulted, others should also suffer.”</p>
<p>Dumbfounded, Wan-shi pouted and looked at her, “You have grown up. Now you are teaching me a lesson.”</p>
<p>“Not a lesson.” Hua Chun shook her head, “As we are in an official family, I’m worried about you. Now that you are fulfilled by insulting Ren-shi, avoid her and don’t insult her anymore as a desperate person might do whatever she wants.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun had an abundance of experiences in this aspect. Many people bearing hatred and loathing had set up others. And she herself had almost been afflicted by those people.</p>
<p>“But why? We have won. And I have to avoid her?” Wan-shi was rather confused, “She always shows off in front of me and I want to do that just like her.”</p>
<p>“My mother,” Hua Chun was a little annoyed, “you are not a kid. Is it reasonable to step on the foot deliberately of the man that has stepped on you?”</p>
<p>Wan-shi pouted and said defiantly, “What I know are tit for tat and he who doesn’t take revenge is not a gentleman.”</p>
<p>“And you are not a gentleman. You are a woman.” Hua Chun handed her a tea cup and said, “Trust me. I wouldn’t be wrong. Take enough rest and don’t worry about these things. I will handle them.”</p>
<p>Wan-shi finally agreed after a second thought. Her son was reliable and capable of handling many things. He wouldn’t suffer some loss as before anymore.</p>
<p>However, frowning, Wan-shi looked up at her and said, “I like what you are now. But what happened? It seems as if you are enlightened after the paddling. You are talkative and more outgoing.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun became uneasy. See, it was not true that no one would notice the difference if someone had traveled across time. There was a significant difference between her and Hua Jinghau. Her mother would definitely have noticed the change.</p>
<p>What should she do? Would everything be alright after she was recognized?</p>
<p>After contemplation, Hua Chun laughed as she looked at Wan-shi and said, “The paddling has enlightened me. Why don’t we enjoy our life as it is short? I won’t have the chance to talk with you if someday the Emperor goes mad and beats me to death.”</p>
<p>A little shocked, Wan-shi was moved again. She looked at her son and said, “It’s delightful that you are conscious. I would always stand by you no matter what you do.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, my mother.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun watched her leave after a short conversation.</p>
<p>It was Wan-shi who comforted her most after she traveled to this time. She didn’t know what had happened to her in the end. But as she was the mother of Hua Jinghua, she would fulfil her filial duties and treated her well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, He Chang’an had returned to the palace and had informed Yu Wenjie exactly what Prime Minister Hua said.</p>
<p>“I know he would have explained in that way,” the emperor was annoyed, “he is playing a word game with me. How dare he?”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Your Majesty,” He Changan smiled, “to be fair, it is Noble Consort Hua that is the initiator. She set her family up. There isn’t a strong relationship between the furnishing of the yard of Hua and disaster relief. Don’t punish Prime Minister Hua.”</p>
<p>The emperor squinted at him and closed his eyes, “It seems as if you like Hua Jinghua.”</p>
<p>“A little,” He Chang’an nodded without hesitation, rubbing his chin, “don’t you think that Prime Minister Hua has a special temperament that attracts people?”</p>
<p>A special temperament? Yu Wenjie shook his head. He was indeed special when he was against him with a grim face, which made him want to behead Hua.</p>
<p>However, although He Chang’an seemed to smile gently all the time and was easy to get along with, he was always indifferent. Yu Wenjie was clear of that as they had been close friends for many years. He Chang’an saw Hua Jinghua for the first time after he returned to the imperial city this time; how could he like Hua Jinghua after saving him in an almost failed manner?</p>
<p>Looking at him uneasily, the emperor paused and then said, “Chang’an?”</p>
<p>“Huh?” He Chang’an’s mind was absent.</p>
<p>“You haven’t married a woman at this age, do you…”</p>
<p>“What?” He looked up at the emperor with a pair of blank eyes.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Yu Wenjie said seriously, “Do you like males?”</p>
<p>Almost falling down from the soft couch, He Chang’an was speechless. “Why? It’s just because I haven’t met someone I love. How could I like males?”</p>
<p>“You look at Hua Jinghua in a gentle expression, which wouldn’t appear in your face when you look at any other woman,” said Yu Wenjie, “your expression was different when you met the princess of the other nation.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” He Chang’an chomped, “I would stare at her in the same way if she was half as beautiful as Prime Minister Hua.”</p>
