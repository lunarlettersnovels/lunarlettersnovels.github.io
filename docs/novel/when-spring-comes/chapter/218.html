            <p><strong>Chapter 19 – The Hua Family Yard (2)</strong></p>
<p>Wan-shi took another deep breath. She surprisingly calmed down. She frowned and looked at poor Hua Chun and said, “You can’t be blamed for this. Senior Concubine Hua’s mother can’t get along with us. If the upper beam is not straight and the lower beam is crooked, one must be careful. It’s not easy for you to be Prime Minister, so I can’t hold you back. If you say so, then do so.”</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, she was being very reasonable. Hua Chun was a little bit surprised and was moved a little after the incident. Even if Wan-shi was somewhat rude and boisterous, she will stand by her side and consider her.</p>
<p>“Rest assured that you will find a way to get the Emperor to free to continue to repair the courtyard.” She said, “After all, the courtyard of the Hua family has nothing to do with the court.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Wan-shi held Hua Chun’s hands and opened her mouth to say something, but she only squeezed her gently because of the servants next to them.</p>
<p>The Hua family was a part of the dynasty since the days of old, and Master Hua favored sons over daughters. Because of this, Wan-shi has always supported her son’s decision.</p>
<p>After all, it was her own selfish desires that turned her daughter into a son. Wan-shi regretted it many times, but it was too late to turn back the time. The Hua family couldn’t bear the crime of deceiving the Emperor, so they could only wrong her.4</p>
<p>“Since there is no need to go and see, then you go back and rest.” Patting her on the back, Wan-shi said, “Go and change your clothes. Don’t forget to apply your medicine.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun looked at her mother, gratefully. She then turned around to hold Pin Tan’s hand and went back to the small courtyard.</p>
<p>It was the best time for her to step into a pit. Thus, she must get to know the previous Prime Minister Hua. Up to now, she didn’t even know the real and full name of the Prime Minister. She only heard people address the prime minister as Minister Hua Shi.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, Hua Chun said to Pin Tan, “Send me to the study room. There are still a lot of things to be done.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Pin Tan didn’t ask any more questions. After all, her master has always been extremely diligent.</p>
<p>There was a lot of information in the study, so she stayed there alone for a long time. Hua Chun sat behind the desk, holding a stack of letters and papers and read it.</p>
<p>In modern times, Hua Chun was a clerk, graduated from the Department of Political Science and Law, and became a secretary in a specific agency. She was excellent at writing paper works. It was not difficult for her to understand matters related to government affairs.</p>
<p>But somehow, she did not feel right. She looked at these traditional Chinese characters and the brush strokes in front of her and felt very ill at ease at how easily she read them as if she had seen them many times.</p>
<p>So when the words “Hua Jinghua” came into view, she was taken aback.</p>
<p>“Jinghua?”</p>
<p><em>‘That is my name? Eh? Why couldn’t I have a better name in this life? Even if it is called “Fachum” in modern times, it is still a ham sausage, ah! Can someone dare to love or hate ham sausage!?’</em> Although Hua’s name was very similar to Mary Sue, it was better than the real one.</p>
<p><em>‘Eh, why does this name sound familiar, though? Have I heard it somewhere before?’</em></p>
<p>After thinking about it for a long time, Hua Chun continued to read these letters from the people.</p>
<p>It can be seen from the lines of the letter that Hua Jinghua was definitely a member of the elite.</p>
<p>He was neither humble nor overbearing, neither greedy nor overly self-humble. Like the TV series’s image, it gave people a comfortable feeling of kindness, like a jade.</p>
<p>However, the papers for the Emperor are quite different. There are still many papers on the table that have not been presented, and the places where Zhu was added are just a few unkind words. The conciseness was correct, but the tone seemed to provoke the Emperor.</p>
<p>If he didn’t beat her up, who will do so? Hua Chun reread the document for a long time and objectively thought that the Emperor had endured so long to beat her, and he really had a good temper. She wrote.</p>
<p>“The truth.”</p>
<p>“It was true.”</p>
<p>“The Emperor was wise. He tells the truth.” What’s more? After an old man slapped the Emperor’s flattery, Prime Minister Hua wrote. One word: “Oh.”</p>
<p>Senseless violence became popular thousands of years ago? People praised the Emperor. One must give it all to the Emperor and not die.</p>
<p>Hua Chun picked up the brush and planned to change it for her.</p>
<p>However, her elbow accidentally touched the zipper next to it. The zipper with the word “discard” at the bottom was swept to the ground.</p>
<p>Shocked, Hua Chun hurriedly lowered to pick it up.</p>
<p>There was an early book of Zhu Pi opened. Looking at the ink, she knew it had been a long time. The Zhu Pi on the top was much more than what she held now.</p>
