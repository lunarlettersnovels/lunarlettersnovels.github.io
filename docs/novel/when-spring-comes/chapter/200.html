            <p><strong>Chapter 37 – An Act of Sheer Folly (2)</strong></p>
<p>Hua Liuying became puzzled at the emperor’s answer. She stared at him with a pair of innocent eyes. “Haven’t you presented him with grace?”</p>
<p><em>‘Grace?’</em> The word sounded familiar to Yu Wenjie’s ears. It seemed as if Hua Jinghua had talked with him about it, but not in that way. He replied, “I haven’t.”</p>
<p>He Chang’an then became curious as he listened to their conversation, glancing at Noble Consort Hua, who had evidently become pleased, gloating over the emperor in a low voice, “What on earth is going on?”</p>
<p>“The disaster relief,” Yuwen Jie explained in a casual tone, “Prime Minister Hua suggests stopping furnishing the palace and putting disaster relief in the first place. Noble Consort Hua is saying that if her hall couldn’t be furnished, Hua’s backyard shouldn’t be furnished either. The Prime Minister should set an example.”</p>
<p>Raising his eyebrow, Chang’an said, “Isn’t Noble Consort Hua the sister of Prime Minister Hua?”</p>
<p>“I am his sister.” Hua Liuying stood up, grasping the hands of a servant. She hurried to take her handkerchief out to wipe her face, applying her makeup evenly. As they were brother and sister, how could the situation be like this, where no one would benefit? He Chang’an’s interest heightened, but remained silent.</p>
<p>Noble Consort Hua said, a satisfied smile curling her lips, “So, Prime Minister Hua must have proclaimed a false decree.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie tilted his head and looked at her, “Do you know the consequence of proclaiming a false decree?”</p>
<p>“I know it’s severe,” Hua Liuying replied, masking a serious expression, “but if my brother did do something wrong, I wouldn’t speak anything for him. Just do whatever you want, Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>She had spoken of the same words last time when Hua Jinghua was sentenced to a paddling session. Yu Wenjie was well-aware of their sour relationship; he didn’t like him either. However, it was foolish of her to set her brother up like this, because her surname was Hua, too.</p>
<p>“Now that you are so generous, I’ll send someone to figure it out to make a final judgment,” he looked at Hua Liuying’s joyful face and said, “if Prime Minister did proclaiming a false decree, he would be sentenced to suffer from the property confiscation and exile with all his families.”</p>
<p>Hua Liuying’s grin instantly vanished, and she asked in disbelief, “What?”</p>
<p>How funny and foolish her expression was. He Chang’an shook his head. Was every woman so mindless like her? She paid no attention to the whole situation and only did whatever she wanted. Owing to her recklessness, she charged the Hua family with the guilt of proclaiming a false decree. What would Noble Consort Hua do, He Chang’an was curious.</p>
<p>Understanding what the emperor meant, Hua Liuying was in a panic, “Your Majesty, is it that serious?”</p>
<p>“Did you say that you wouldn’t cover for him?” Yu Wenjie turned his head, fixing his gaze on the chessboard, and said, “Now that you are so selfless, I will give your heart.”</p>
<p>Hua Liuying paled, blood leaving his face as he panicked and hurried to turn back to the imperial servants, who immediately understood her desperate stare and left in total silence. How did this happen? The emperor usually doted on her, protecting her even. Why has he turned cold, burdening her with such a problem? Hua Liuying observed the emperor for a while, thinking that he might just be in a sour mood.</p>
<p>She only wanted to cause misery to Hua Jinghua, only to unleash misfortune to the entire Hua family! How foolish. This was nowhere near a fair trade and she must make amends. The emperor had sent some of his people to investigate the matter; she must find a remedy as soon as possible. Thinking twice, she was about to ask for his favor when the emperor put down a chess piece in his hands and looked up to He Chang’an, “Why don’t you admit defeat?”</p>
<p>He Chang’an regained consciousness and stared at the black pieces on the board before raising himself with a salute, “You are much better than me and I am willing to lose this game.”</p>
<p>Triumph glimmered in Yu Wenjie’s eyes, but there was no change in his facial expression. He squinted at He Chang’an and said, “Now that you’ve lost, do me a favor.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you want me to do, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“It’s about the issue that Prime Minister Hua proclaimed a false decree,” said the emperor, “pay a visit to the Hua Hall by yourself.”</p>
<p>Hearing his words, Hua Liuying’s legs weakened and quivered, and she collapsed to the ground. “Your Majesty!” she cried. How could she make amends if the Duke of Gongyu was the investigator? The duke was stubborn and didn’t interface well with her. It was impossible to bribe him in such a short period of time. The Hua family’s ship would sink to the bottom of despair if Hua Jinghua did indeed proclaim a false decree!</p>
<p>“You didn’t behave well today, my lady,” Yu Wenjie turned to look at her, his face turning solemn, “you have shouted again and again. You are in the palace, not on the street.”</p>
<p>Her heart fell; Hua Liuying looked at his eyes in silence and desperation, her eyes intending to shed tears. No one knew how much effort she had put into gaining the emperor’s love, but he was cold and fickle. He had treated her well for this half of the month, only to turn hostile all of a sudden. However, his bitter words weren’t the reason for her tears: she had known that the emperor would have snubbed her for a while. Nervous and yet angry, she put the blame on her mother, who placed her in the pit of ridiculous tragedy.<br>
