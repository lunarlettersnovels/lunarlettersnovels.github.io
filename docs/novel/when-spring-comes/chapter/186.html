            <p><strong>Chapter 51 – Wrong Turn of Events (3)</strong></p>
<p>She was like a zombie, holding her eyelids up with her hands as she followed the servant to the hall.</p>
<p>“By the way,” quickly thinking of something, Hua Chun straightened up quickly and looked at the servant next to her, “can you please give this to the Queen Mother for me?”</p>
<p>The servant hesitated, but then nodded. Hua Chun then handed over the letter she asked someone else to write, along with the jade.</p>
<p>This was the best way she could think of to handle the situation: giving the jade pendant to the queen mother and saying it was from Huo Zhaoyi. If the queen mother still didn’t appreciate it, then there was nothing she could do about it. Huo Zhaoyi needed to know this for her own good.</p>
<p>It was actually one stone that could kill two birds. Only such an exquisite and delicate woman as her was worth the effort made by Hua Jinghua!</p>
<p>However, when she was preparing for the letter today, she found that although her calligraphy was similar to that of Hua Jinghua, it was still possible to spot the difference for someone attentive to details, such as the emperor. She had to think of a way to avoid writing letters in the future, so that she could live safely without having her secret revealed.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister Hua,” He Chang’an had already arrived at the apse of the Sun Hall. Seeing her coming, he took her right inside and closed the door.</p>
<p>‘<em>What is this?’ </em>Hua Chun trembled slightly as she looked up at him.</p>
<p>“Let’s get changed.” Yu Wenjie stood inside, looking at her. “Today, we are going on a tour outside the palace. Since the Prime Minister wants to share the worries for me, I decided to take him with me.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun froze. Getting changed for… a tour?</p>
<p>The only thing she could think of upon knowing the agenda was people killing each other with knives and swords flying in the air, and probably even flying towards the emperor. Those who accompanied him either protected the emperor from being stabbed to death or given to death if they failed to escort him. So basically, death was the only result.  She wanted to bawl her eyes out.</p>
<p>“Emperor, why do you suddenly want to go on a tour on a whim? There are many risks outside the palace, and it’s not safe…”</p>
<p>“Is it safe in the palace then?” The emperor asked calmly in reply.</p>
<p>Thinking of the night last time, Hua Chun shook her head with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>“So, yes, now you’re telling me.” Yu Wenjie glanced at him, “Are you ever scared of death? Why are you so timid today?”</p>
<p>“Well,” Hua Chun squeezed her thigh, gritted her teeth and responded, “I am not scared, and I will indeed follow the order…”</p>
<p>“Great.” Yu Wenjie had already started to unbutton his clothes by himself, throwing some articles of clothing on him, “Put this on.”</p>
<p>There were only three of them in this huge apse, and there was not even a servant that would help with changing. He Chang’an had changed into a normal robe, and the emperor’s dragon robe had also been half taken off.</p>
<p>Hua Chun stiffened upon assessing her predicament, not knowing what to do. She looked at the robe in her hand and asked, “Do we just change here?”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” He Chang’an smiled, “In order to prevent others from knowing our whereabouts, so we can only do it ourselves… Do you not know how to change your clothes?</p>
<p>Her face reddened, and her heart began racing. Hua Chun shook her head and started to think, “There are maids helping me change the clothes…” And the doors and windows were shut, and there was only one maid waiting for her to change clothes!</p>
<p>Taking off the dragon robe, Yu Wenjie only had a thin coat inside, and when he heard Hua Chun mumbling, he frowned and just walked right up to her. Without his outer robe worn, he directly pinched the buttons on her clothes impatiently.</p>
<p>“A dignified man doesn’t even know how to change clothes. The Prime Minister is really embarrassing me! How can I serve you personally?”</p>
<p>Hua Chun’s face went pale as ice, and she boldly pushed the emperor’s hand away.</p>
<p>Things were beginning to take an unpleasant turn.</p>
