            <p><strong>Chapter 65 – The Future of Hua Jinghua (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Huh?” Yu Wenjie responded absentmindedly, apparently lost in his thoughts.</p>
<p>“The Minister is going to marry the young girl from the brothel as his wife. On the day of marriage, I hope the Emperor can let his Minister take a half-day vacation.”</p>
<p>After returning to his senses, the emperor turned his head to look at him: “You want to marry the brothel woman as your wife?”</p>
<p>As the emperor took a deep breath, Hua Chun nodded solemnly and spoke in a deep voice. “The Minister has not married for many years, all just to meet her. Now that I have met the one I love, I naturally want to give her the best. Identity is not important, and friendship is indeed rare.”</p>
<p>Frowning slightly, Yu Wenjie couldn’t seem to understand. “You fell in love with her so soon.”</p>
<p>“You can say that it’s a bit fast, but when you meet the right person at the right time, the feelings will naturally develop quickly.” Hua Chun responded seriously. “Furthermore, the Minister should also continue the incense for the Hua Family.”</p>
<p>Continue the incense? The emperor glanced at him up and down, the boy with no hair was already growing up. He always felt that Hua Jinghua was a sissy, and now that a sissy would marry another woman, it would definitely make people feel very awkward.</p>
<p>“There have been a lot of things happening in Korea and China recently. Do you have to get married at this time?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing his unhappy tone, Hua Chun’s heart jumped. “It’s not that I should get married right away. If there are too many things, you can postpone it for a while. The Minister is only here to discuss with the Emperor.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to discuss with me about your marriage?” Yu Wenjie got up, all with no expression on his face: “While I am looking for free time, I can’t allow you to leave.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun simply stayed silent. He seemed upset. What did she do to upset him? He was the one who thought that she was virile, but he was also the one who did not prove her masculinity to her. If so, then what was wrong?</p>
<p>The emperor waved his sleeves and left. Zhili also retreated. Hua Chun felt helpless as he got up and went out of the palace. She didn’t know if this was just her illusion. She always felt that the emperor didn’t doubt her gender, but had been doubting other things. He even let the eminent monk look at her natal chart. Could it be that she had gotten possessed by a ghost?</p>
<p>If so, then the technique of this eminent monk must really not be very good. They didn’t even see that she was indeed a ghost from the 21st century. A lively, cute, and harmless ghost.</p>
<p>Silently complimenting herself, she went back to <strong>Huafu</strong> with a sound peace of mind. As long as she got married to Qing Qi, and then she thought about getting a baby, her life would be considered stable. However, this matter was not urgent, so she still had to take her time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Youyang Palace, Hua Liuying washed her face with tears all day long, and had no idea how many days she had cried. The news in the palace did not mean that the emperor had welcomed the new concubine again, or that the people in the palace had been rewarded again. However, she was still locked in this Youyang Palace, and her future seemed bleak.</p>
<p>The splendor of the previous imperial concubine and the love of the emperor seemed to be still in sight. She couldn’t accept that it had become like this in a blink of an eye, and there was nothing to do except cry.</p>
<p>“Master!” Omiya Shigure ran in and said excitedly. “Don’t cry, the Emperor is here!”</p>
<p>However, she couldn’t understand her words clearly. “Who is here?”</p>
<p>“The Emperor! It’s at the gate of the palace!”</p>
<p>Hua Liuying quickly cheered up, looked at her crying dirty face in the mirror on the dressing table, wiped her nose and left a tear, and evened her makeup. She then rushed out.</p>
<p>“The concubine welcomes the holy driver!”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie sat on the dragon blade in a daze, lowering his eyebrows to look at Concubine Hua who was kneeling next to him, not knowing why he had come here for a while.</p>
<p>For women who were tired, he never loved to spoil them.</p>
<p>Since he was already here, there was no other way. Yu Wenjie still got off the dragon and walked into the palace.</p>
<p>“How are you doing?”</p>
<p>When she heard this, Hua Liuying’s tears came down again. “The concubine thinks about the king day and night, and is very haggard… I thought the Holy Master would never come again.”</p>
<p>Indeed, he did not plan to come here ever again.</p>
<p>The emperor sat down on the main seat and looked at her and said, “Today the Prime Minister Hua said that he is going to get married, so I will come to see you.”</p>
<p>Get married? Hua Liuying felt shocked, did Hua Jinghua always want to get married? Why was it suddenly open for discussion now? Once he got married, wouldn’t the born child be the eldest son of the Hua Family? The status of the Hua family would go a step further.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, Hua Liuying felt a little panicked, and quickly said, “My eldest brother is dedicated to his country. Marrying a girl may delay others.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yu Wenjie glanced at her: “You don’t want your eldest brother to get married?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t want…” she trailed off. “The concubine can’t interfere in this kind of thing. It’s okay if the eldest brother really likes people, if it’s just for the children… As a woman, the concubine will naturally sympathize with the future sister-in-law.”</p>
<p><em>’Huh.’</em> He didn’t believe that that person would really like a girl in such a short period of time. After all, for so long, he had been keeping an eye on the minister and had never seen a woman ever move Hua Chun’s mind.</p>
<p>He could also say this because, earlier, Hua Jinghua’s eyes were not right when he saw him. Although his face was expressionless, the look in his eyes was similar to those of the harem. The concubine was no different. It indeed seemed that everything was different now. He was no longer as cold and affectionate as before, but he had become lively and heartful. Seeing that his eyes were full of fear, he was no longer half as charming as he used to be.</p>
