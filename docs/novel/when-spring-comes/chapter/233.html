            <p><strong>Chapter 4 – Cold, Serpentine Emperor</strong></p>
<p>“Hmm?” Hua Chun forced out, adopting a sleepy tone as she pretended to let out a small yawn. Slowly blinking her eyes open, she looked towards the Emperor and acted surprised, offering him a reluctant smile. “I was not aware that His Majesty had arrived. I ask My Lord to forgive me for not giving a proper welcome.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie offered no response. Instead, he stood, silently observing him — his eyes shifting from her face, to her body, and then to her hips before he finally opened his mouth. “I have been instructed by the Empress Dowager to come and check on the Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>It was a cold and flat remark, no ups and downs in his words, just like reciting a scripted line emphasizing ‘It was the Empress Dowager, not I, who wanted me to come.’ A handsome and heroic face looked so heartless and as cold as ice.</p>
<p>The corner of her mouth twitched as Hua Chun pondered over the Emperor’s words before she cautiously said, “The Emperor’s heart has been subdued. Thank you for the grace of the Empress Dowager.”</p>
<p>She thought, as long as the Emperor didn’t come here to bring punishment again, she had to thank him. On the TV series, the Emperor and the Prime Minister were naturally at odds. And whenever they met, it was the Prime Minister who suffered losses because of their identities. Yet, seeing her so miserable now, the Emperor’s conscience pricked.</p>
<p>With one more glance over her body, the Emperor then stared into her eyes for a quick beat before offering a silent nod. He then turned on his heel and left, not offering any additional word of concern. Helpless, Hua Chun looked towards Pin Tan and inclined her head towards the door. “Pin Tan. Please send Your Majesty off in my stead.”</p>
<p>With a nod, the servant girl went off to do so. Yet Yu Wunjie continued to be stone-faced. Without looking back, he went straight out of the Hua Mansion, only stopping outside the doorway where someone was waiting for him, his back bending to a bow upon seeing the countenance of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Glancing at this person, the Emperor then stared straight, his face still expressionless as he dusted off his clothes.</p>
<p>“Eunuch Qin, go and tell the Empress Dowager that I have done what I was supposed to do.”</p>
<p>“As ordered, Your Majesty.” Eunuch Qin responded, his head still bowed while he silently sighed in his own heart. Really, the Emperor was so heartless.</p>
<p>As an emperor, it was his responsibility to distinguish right from wrong. Yet, Prime Minister Hua only spoke too much in the court hall that day. And, that led her to be punished with a beating. What would it make of them after that horrible day? Would they still be able to talk calmly?</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>Complicated… So complicated… ” The official thought, resisting the urge to sigh out loud as he straightened his back after seeing the emperor off, staring quietly in worry at his way before turning away, intent on relaying the Emperor’s words to the Empress Dowager.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Back in the room, Hua Chun lay back down on her side, glancing at the little servant next to her. After thinking about it, she said hesitantly, “Pin Tan, will you come and change my clothes?”</p>
<p>At the sudden question, Pin Tan was taken aback but recomposed herself after a few minutes. With a shake of her head, the young maid said, “Your Majesty, it is not very convenient for the time being. Your injury is not yet healed. For the time being, bear with me and just wait for a little while for the next dressing. Then this servant will help you change your clothes for you.”</p>
<p>Listening to this tone, Hua Chun guessed that Pin Tan often helped Prime Minister Hua when getting dressed. In other words, she should have known by now that Prime Minister Hua was a woman.</p>
<p>Hua Chun could not help but be more curious.</p>
<p><em>How could this girl pretend to be a man and hold a rank such as the prime minister? Wasn’t it a deadly crime to deceive the royal family? Why would this body risk that? Argh, why didn’t she speed through the TV series?!</em></p>
<p>With a sigh, Hua Chun closed her eyes, her mind still whirring. Truthfully, she had encountered similar plots back in the modern world. All those shows, movies, and books — the reasons could be boiled down to two things: either she was a female who wanted to stand firm despite her gender status, or she was forced to by her family. For example, what if this generation had no sons and only daughters but still wants someone to inherit their power? So, typically, one must be forced to pretend to be a man!</p>
<p>With these conspiracies swirling inside her mind, she mentally made a face and asked herself. <em>‘Then… Which category did this Prime Minister Hua fall into?’</em><br>
