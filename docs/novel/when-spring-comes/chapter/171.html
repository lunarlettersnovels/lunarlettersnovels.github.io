            <p><strong>Chapter 66 –  I’m Not Interested in Women (1)</strong></p>
<p>At first he thought it was pretty good, for at least it wouldn’t make him feel embarrassed. After all, he didn’t like men. It must be uncomfortable to be stared at by a man all day.</p>
<p>However, today, he suddenly heard that the prime minister was going to get married. The emperor’s heart was more or less feeling unpleasant.</p>
<p>This feeling had nothing to do with his emotions, but a kind of inertia. He was used to Hua Jinghua putting all his body and mind on him every day, changing his mind, competing with him, and trying his best to let him listen to his advice, although he may be a broken sleeve. In this regard, the emperor felt very disgusted, but even he had no choice but to admit that Hua Jinghua was indeed a very competent prime minister.</p>
<p>Marriage should not have any effect, but he was so young, and vigorous, and full of blood. Wouldn’t he be distracted by women?</p>
<p>There were many messy thoughts coursing through his mind. Yu Wenjie watched Concubine Hua walk away.</p>
<p>Hua Liuying couldn’t understand the emperor’s thoughts, but the emperor didn’t like her eldest brother, and she knew it. After pondering for a while, she whispered, “Actually, this concubine thinks that the eldest brother might be acting in this marriage.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Yu Wenjie looked back at her, looking down at her.</p>
<p>Hua Liuying continued, “When I was a child, my concubine was in the Flower Mansion. I never saw my elder brother approaching any woman. Many people in the mansion felt that my eldest brother… has a special hobby and doesn’t love women. After a long time, he has never been married. There are more and more people who continually gossip about him. The concubine thinks that the eldest brother going to get married this time is more or less a cover up.”</p>
<p>After a slight pause, the emperor cast his eyes down and looked at the woman in front of him.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie liked smart people. It seemed that, until now, Concubine Hua didn’t understand why she had been degraded last time. It was not just as simple as framing the prime minister, but because she could ignore her own brother for her own desires. Such a woman made him feel terrible. Hua Liuying still hadn’t grown at all.</p>
<p>The emperor got up, no longer looked at her, and walked out.</p>
<p>Hua Liuying panicked, and obviously felt that the emperor was angry with her again. But why? She obviously followed the emperor’s will to say that Hua Jinghua was not good. Didn’t he like to listen to it before? Why couldn’t it seem to weigh on his heart recently? His heart was indeed very unpredictable!</p>
<p>Watching the dragon robe disappear outside the door, Hua Liuying reacted thusly and continued to cry.</p>
<p>She really hated Hua Jinghua. Her life would’ve been fine without him. Without him, she would still be happily by the emperor’s side, and she would definitely bring more glory to the Hua family! Because of him, her mother was so unhappy, she also fell to the point where she was all alone in the cold palace!</p>
<p>Hua Jinghua should have died much earlier!</p>
<p>The emperor got up and drove back to the Zǐchen Hall, seeing as he did not continue to want to see Jinghua. However, inexplicably, he found that he could not sleep well overnight.</p>
<p>Just after dawn the next day, Yu Wenjie sat in the chaotic hall.</p>
<p>Around this time, the civil and military officials were going to the Xuanzheng Hall with smiles on their faces. When they went in and saw the emperor, however, they all turned stupid, thinking they were late, and hurriedly returned to the queues on both sides, trembling.</p>
<p>The emperor looked at the door intently with no expression on his face.</p>
<p>Hua Chun got up a bit late today. He didn’t know why, but the old officials who used to call her hadn’t been here for a few days. They had seen her from a distance as they walked on the road, and didn’t even come to say hello to her.</p>
<p>Along the way, she immersed herself in her own thoughts. If it was because of the disaster relief… the case had been rejected, and no one’s actual interests were harmed. Judging from the fact that they always supported the Prime Minister Hua, it was impossible for them to hold a grudge against her. Even if one held a grudge, it was simply impossible to alienate her.</p>
<p>Because of this, she really couldn’t understand why.</p>
<p>As she lowered her head and stepped into the Xuanzheng Hall, Hua Chun felt that the atmosphere was not the same as usual. When she looked up, the emperor was already sitting on his throne!</p>
<p>Looking back at the gray sky outside, she felt that she should not be late, but what was the situation here? As she hurried forward, Hua Chun did not dare say a word.</p>
<p>“Everyone is here.” Yu Wenjie told him. “If you have something to tell us.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun didn’t receive too many notes yesterday, and the important things had already been reported, so she thought that this morning should not be particularly lively.</p>
<p>However, unexpectedly, as soon as the emperor’s words fell sound, Grand Secretary Li stood up and said, “The minister has started, the disaster relief has been arranged, and the relief bank has been on the way of transportation recently, and the inspector has followed all the way. There is no corruption, and the people in the capital have praised it.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun was taken aback and glanced at him. Did he say that to slap her in the face?</p>
<p>Grand Preceptor Li looked to her side, slightly shook his head, stood up and said, “Six parliaments have ended, so the three officials have recommended any of six positions. Please do look over this list, emperor.”</p>
