            <p><strong>Chapter 54 – Clash in Daylight (1)</strong></p>
<p>Moving on, Hua Chun still felt a little cautious at first. After all, the two people next to her were not familiar with her, and their status in society was precious, which only served to pressure her further.</p>
<p>However, looking at the antique shops on both sides of the street, as well as the various odd and small gadgets displayed on the small stalls, Hua Chun’s inner collecting addiction had resurfaced once more. In modern times, she had a special big box to hold all kinds of hairpins and bronze mirrors from a certain treasure. Now that what she could see were the original antique products, how on earth could she possibly bear it?</p>
<p>By that point. He Chang’an stopped walking, turned around, and found that the people around him had disappeared.</p>
<p>“Second Lord.” He yelled for the person in front, anxiety rising.</p>
<p>Hua Chun then squatted by the small stall at the entrance of the next shop, quickly picking and choosing, choosing two bronze mirrors with jewels and five hairpins.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie stared at her without a single sound.</p>
<p>He wanted to pick him up and beat him up again. He, a man, was acutally interested in this kind of thing?</p>
<p>After paying for her purchases, she hurried back to them and saw the expression in the emperor’s eyes. Hua Chun consciously explained: “This is a gift for the sisters in the house when we get back.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie’s eyes narrowed even more.</p>
<p>He Chang’an, who stood next to him, asked jokingly: “Your palace has golden branches and jade leaves, yet you think they will like these gadgets?”</p>
<p>“They will like it!” Hua Chun’s eyes widened as she replied. “Look at these two bronze mirrors. Although they are not expensive, the workmanship is exquisite, and it is still very hard to make. I estimate that it will not break if you were to drop it!” To prove her point, she picked one up and threw it to the ground.</p>
<p>Pop!</p>
<p>The piece on the back of the bronze mirror was not broken, yet the mirror itself had shattered into a thousand fragments.</p>
<p>At this, Hua Chun felt a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie looked at her with an idiotic expression, and then went on walking without looking back.</p>
<p>He Chang’an chuckled slightly before going over to her. “Let’s go, don’t ask for it if it is already broken.”</p>
<p>“But… the gem above.. .”</p>
<p>“That’s a fake, if you like it, I will find some real gifts for you.” Hua Chun looked at him with a very moved expression, but then shook her head: “No, it’s gone if it’s gone.”</p>
<p>Reaching out and holding the bronze mirror in her arms, Hua Chun looked at the emperor, who was getting farther and farther from them, and couldn’t help asking He Chang’an.  “Do we have a specific destination?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” He Chang’an stopped. He then pointed to a restaurant next to him: “It’s here.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun looked up, looked at the words “Zhengdu Restaurant” on the plaque, and then glanced at the emperor who was almost out of sight by now. “Then?”</p>
<p>“I think I’ve gone the wrong way. I’m busy thinking about something, but I’ll be back later.” He Chang’an seemed to have taken off, leaving the emperor just like that before taking her into the restaurant.</p>
<p>The business was good, the first floor was full of people, drinking and shouting, and the atmosphere is good. The shopkeeper named Xiaoer led them to the second floor. Contrary to the first floor, the second floor was much quieter, with only a few tables of people drinking quietly.</p>
<p>There was a place by the window, and He Chang’an led her over. As soon as she sat down, the emperor followed up with half of his face black.</p>
<p>“Look at you, not paying attention to respect and inferiority, you are really obedient.” Yu Wenjie snorted at He Chang’an.</p>
<p>This was obviously said in a joking tone. He Chang’an was not afraid of him at all. He smiled and replied, “Isn’t it rare to have so many worries when you are relaxing? Aren’t I right, Brother Jinghua?”</p>
<p>Every time he was called this name, Hua Chun felt very ashamed. However, in ancient times, it seemed that there was no special understanding of “essence,” so she could only smile and respond, “Yes.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie sat down opposite Hua Chun, right next to the window. He lowered his eyes and glanced at the side slightly with the peripheral light, and then pressed his lips.</p>
<p>Seeing his expression, Hua Chun felt nervous.</p>
<p>In the following plot, based on years of experience in watching TV series, the assassins must be sitting at the next few tables! After a while, she would slap the case and set off the table of wine and food. Although she had never understood how to kill people properly, did the wine and food provoke them? Must they really be overturned? However, after the wine and food would get overturned, there would be a fierce fight, and the protagonist may be forced to jump off the second floor.</p>
<p>With these thoughts running through her head, Hua Chun hurriedly stretched out his head in order to look through the windows. This was only on the second floor, about the same height as the beams of the Zǐchen Hall. If one were to fall, he would, at most, gain a fracture without losing his life.</p>
<p>Looking at the other two people on the table, Hua Chun whispered hesitantly: “Second Lord, I don’t think the atmosphere here is very good. Why don’t we change the place?”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie looked towards her calmly. “I like the atmosphere here.”</p>
<p>Perverted? Hua Chun gritted her teeth. These two were both talented and brave. Meanwhile, she didn’t know any martial arts. She was only very persuasive. Since it was a purposeful trip, knowing that she would be in danger, why must she be pulled along?<br>
