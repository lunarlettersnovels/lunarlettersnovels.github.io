            <p><strong>Chapter 64 – The Future of Hua Jinghua (1)</strong></p>
<p>She still wanted to live a little longer, and she still wanted to continue living in ancient times. It was quite interesting, living here. It was not easy to pass through once, and she simply couldn’t end up with a dead body!</p>
<p>Wan-shi looked at her sadly. Eventually, she nodded hesitantly. She was very willing to believe in her daughter. However, the emperor was already suspicious of her. Could he really dispel his suspicions by only getting married? The expression on Hua Chun’s face was very firm, however, and this relaxed Wan-shi upon seeing it. ‘<em>It’ll be okay, my daughter is omnipotent, nothing can stump her.’</em></p>
<p>“You can go,” she waved.</p>
<p>Hua Chun nodded in reply, went to change into an official uniform, took something, and walked out of the door of Huafu with her chest puffed up. However, as soon as she got into the carriage, she automatically drooped down. At this, she scratched the wall of the carriage and made a face.</p>
<p>She really didn’t know anything in her heart! How could one prove that a woman was actually a man? Why did this kind of century problem fall on her? What if the emperor would take her clothes off and look at her by accident?</p>
<p>Hua Chun felt so sad that she felt like she had been losing her hair. The carriage reeled to the palace, and it was now getting late. This time, it went in. ‘<em>I don’t know when I can go home.’</em></p>
<p>Why did her life become so bitter, anyway?</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister Hua has entered the palace!”</p>
<p>Just after the bathing and changing clothes, the emperor was sitting in the back hall of the Zǐchen Hall to meet the high monk. Hearing Eunuch Qin’s confession, his eyes brightened: “Let him come in.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun came in, holding Zhezi in his hands. In order to reflect on her “masculinity,” she came in with one hand holding this large pile.</p>
<p>“Weichen (this humble servant) has visited the emperor.”</p>
<p>Looking at him up and down, Yu Wenjie spoke. “Why send Zhezi in so late?”</p>
<p>“I’m sending it back to the emperor. There are some important things in the book. The minister is afraid of delaying such a prize, so…” Putting it down, she said, “You’ll have to work hard.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Yu Wenjie calmly replied, “come here and sit down.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know if it was because of the long time they had spent together, but Hua Chun felt that the emperor’s attitude towards her had become a lot gentler, unlike the stern expression he always wore around everyone else. It seemed that bowing was really the best way to draw a relationship between two people who were unable to fight.</p>
<p>Hua Chun sat down obediently and glanced at the person standing in the middle of the hall. It had been so late, and there was still a monk standing here. Was it possible that Yu Wenjie had started studying the art of immortality at a young age?</p>
<p>“Master,” the emperor told him, “the Prime Minister of Hua is my prime minister.”</p>
<p>It had originally been intended to let this master go to see Hua Jinghua again when he was in court tomorrow. However, he had brought it to the door by himself at this moment, so it would be better to watch it first so he could feel relieved. If he was really possessed by a female ghost, it was better to expel the ghost as soon as possible. Thinking of this, Yu Wenjie looked at the monk as solemnly as he could.</p>
<p>However, Hua Chun thought it was strange. He thought the emperor was a very strict person, so he wasn’t expecting this at all. Although there must be many things unknown to mankind in this world, Hua Chun was an atheist. She didn’t believe in fate, let alone fortune tellers. But if the emperor wanted people to kill her, she raised her head and looked at the monk honestly.</p>
<p>Zhili was an eminent monk in the imperial temple. He was over fifty years old, and had always spoken with authority. However, he was not very good at fortune-telling. Whenever he met everyone, he ended up acting like a fool. At this moment, in front of the emperor, he actually felt quite nervous. He didn’t understand what the emperor wanted to hear, and he couldn’t say anything at this point.</p>
<p>However, the eyes of the prime minister in front of him were too clean, as if he had the wisdom to see through all the Zen machines. When he closed his eyes, he didn’t dare to talk nonsense.</p>
<p>What Yu Wenjie saw, on the other hand, was that the eminent monk looked at Hua Jinghua very seriously, and the latter looked back at him calmly. There seemed to be unusual fluctuations in the air.</p>
<p>After a long time, Hua Chun blinked sourly, and first asked, “Master, what’s my life?”</p>
<p>Zhili had returned to God, hurriedly recited a Buddha’s name, and said, “The Prime Minister’s life chart is very good. Such is the destiny of great wealth!”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yu Wenjie frowned. “Is there nothing weird about it?”</p>
<p>At this, Hua Chun paused, wondering if he could find a monk that could possibly be better than this. This was too mysterious, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>“Nothing strange.” Zhili sweated coldly. “The Prime Minister is loyal to the bones, and he will be loyal to the Emperor forever.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun was relieved after hearing this. At this, Hua Chun glanced at the emperor’s pensive expression. Thinking that he was still suspicious, he smiled and asked, “I’m going to get married soon. Can Master calculate how many children I would have in the future?”</p>
<p>“This…” Zhili thought for a while. “The Prime Minister’s son, Sun Fu, is also very generous. Say there will be two children, at the very least.”</p>
<p>“That’s good; thank you, Master.” Hua Chun smiled and arched his hands, then turned to look at the emperor. “The Emperor, the Minister enters the palace at this time, there is one more thing I want to announce.”</p>
