            <p><strong>Chapter 49 – Wrong Turn of Events (1)</strong></p>
<p>What was the advantage of being good-looking? That was what He Chang’an had said in a way that made everyone think he felt proud of it. Hua Chun blushed a little at this, but she didn’t feel angry.</p>
<p>If it had been someone ugly saying this, Hua Chun would throw a plate of spinach right on his face! However, she was a man now, and he was also a man. One man had said that the other was handsome and gorgeous… What even was that?</p>
<p>Laughing awkwardly, she put her head down and replied, “Master Hou, please enjoy your meal.”</p>
<p>He Chang’an smiled softly, “Don’t take it too seriously. I just can’t help but joke around.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Hua Chun nodded before continuing to stuff food into her mouth. She did not know what to say any further than that.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie noticed her red ears and girly eating posture, and he just felt angry seeing all that. Therefore, he put down his chopsticks, looking unamused. When the emperor put his chopsticks back on the table, everyone else stopped eating. He Chang’an turned his head and looked at the emperor naively, “Are you done eating?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Yu Wenjie nodded, “Come with me to the garden for a walk, and Prime Minister Hua can leave the palace.”</p>
<p>“Finally!” Hua Chun’s eyes lit up and immediately jumped up to salute, “Thank you, your Majesty.” Now, even something as small as being permitted to leave the palace became something that was worth being grateful for. This was not an easy job for her.</p>
<p>He Chang’an did not feel full, but the emperor seemed to have something to say. Therefore, he had no choice but to follow him. When he stood up, he saw a grain of rice sticking in the corner of Hua Jinghua’s mouth, and he couldn’t help taking it off for her. “Please do take care, prime minister.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Lord Hou.” Hua Chun smiled stiffly in response, goosebumps rising all over her body at the unexpected action.</p>
<p>Such a beautiful person should, for sure, come to try a pick-up line when she was dressed as a woman. She would indeed be very happy! However, she was currently dressed as a man, so the way He Chang’an was treating her – as if she was a flower – just felt awkward. In addition to this, there was even a sense of guilt growing in her, all because she felt like a b*tch getting men simply by dressing up like one of them.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the emperor’s permission, Hua Chun ran out of the sun hall in no time.</p>
<p><em>In the Royal Garden.</em></p>
<p>The emperor looked at the person in front of him in a serious manner and said, “Chang’an, are you…”</p>
<p>“Emperor.” He Chang’an knew what he was going to say just by looking at the expression on his face, so he decided that now would be the best time to interrupt him. “Don’t overthink this. I just think that Prime Minister Hua has a special air that makes him feel like a friendly person. I don’t have a beloved woman, nor do I prefer a beloved man.”</p>
<p>He was a normal person, after all, and he had no interest for men.</p>
<p>After looking at the sombre look on his face, Yu Wenjie still felt suspicious. However, Hua Jinghua did change a lot recently. He had changed from an ice-cold kind of person to a fool. If it weren’t for the mole at the back of his neck, he would have suspected that the person with him now was a different one from the Hua Jinghua that he knew.</p>
<p>However, now… he was not as annoying as the previous one, but he had developed quite the feminine side. The emperor wished that he could just ask him to join the military and gain his masculinity back!</p>
<p>It was okay as long as nothing went wrong with Chang’an, because even though it had been quite a liberal era in the Tang Dynasty, there would still be punishment if one was found to be homosexual. After so many years of friendship, he couldn’t just watch his friend destroy his career.<br>
