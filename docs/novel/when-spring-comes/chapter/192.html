            <p><strong>Chapter 45 – Unpleasant Situation (2)</strong></p>
<p>After a while, the seductive woman returned to the hall, the sound of silk and bamboo could be heard once more, and the beauty continued to swing her waist. However, no one knew if it was because of Hua Chun’s presence, for Huo Zhaoyi, who had been twisting her waist like a willow leaf before, was now moving stiffly, almost as if her lumbar disc was protruding.</p>
<p>Hua Chun felt a bit embarrassed. Although as a woman, it should be okay to look at someone’s waist, she was currently disguised as a minister. What was the emperor thinking, letting the harem Zhaoyi present such flattery in front of him?</p>
<p>Looking at the awkward expression on Huo Zhaoyi’s face, she knew she would probably cry for half an hour when she left.</p>
<p>“Emperor.” She couldn’t help but say, “Since you want to read books and make checks, why do you want to watch the show and listen to the music?”</p>
<p>Glancing at her, Yu Wenjie didn’t speak, but his expression had become extremely cold.</p>
<p>At this point, Hua Chun knew it would be better to shut her mouth. Duke Qin, who stood next to her, quietly explained to her, “This is your Majesty’s habit.”</p>
<p>What was wrong with him? Was reading books a habit, or was it watching the ladies dance? Unable to control herself any longer, Hua Chun rolled her eyes. However, she noticed that the emperor had been glancing at her. After a moment, he asked, “How does the Prime Minister think about Huo Zhaoyi’s dance?”</p>
<p>Hua Chun tilted her head downwards and replied, “The Minister dare not offend the concubine. I only read with your majesty, and dare not look elsewhere.”</p>
<p>‘<em>Very clever,’ </em>Yu Wenjie pursed his lips, “It seems that you are also a courteous person, and know not to look at anything inappropriate.”</p>
<p>Of course. If she had dared to look, she might have been grabbed and pushed out and beaten again. This trap was so obvious, did they think she wouldn’t notice? Smiling, Hua Chun continued to stare at the pattern on her clothes.</p>
<p>“Huo Zhaoyi.” The emperor called out. “Come here.”</p>
<p>At this, Huo Zhaoyi stopped her dancing and walked to the emperor’s side, “What can I do for you, Emperor?”</p>
<p>“Come and read with me.” Yu Wenjie reached out his hand.</p>
<p>Huo Zhaoyi’s expression shifted into one of joy. She stared at the emperor with affectionate eyes before settling herself into his arms in a shaky fashion.</p>
<p>Hua Chun immediately turned around.</p>
<p>Desolate and innocent, this was just rude. Huo Zhaoyi only had perhaps two layers of yarn on her, and when she sat in the arms of the man, how could one possibly hold it? Would she be forced to watch some highly unwanted discourse later on? She really wanted to leave right away, however… the queen mother’s order weighed heavily on her shoulders, forcing her to stay right where she was.</p>
<p>“Emperor?” Huo Zhaoyi’s soft voice was like a strand of hair, lightly stroking across the body. The quality of her voice had the ability to make people squirm. In short, this command of her voice was really alluring.</p>
<p>Hua Chun felt like a third wheel at this moment, but the two people seemed to have not noticed her at all. In fact, their attention was on the books they were reading.</p>
<p>“How do you pronounce this word?” Yu Wenjie then asked Huo Zhaoyi.</p>
<p>Huo Zhaoyi bit her lip and whispered, “Emperor will embarrass his concubine. This word looks so complicated. Is it…f*ck?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” the emperor nodded, “that’s right.”</p>
<p>He was definitely doing this on purpose! Hua Chun grabbed the armrest of the chair. Calling Zhaoyi up and asked her to read such word. She really wanted to just stand up and announce her departure immediately, but…</p>
<p><em>‘Never mind.’</em> Taking a deep breath, Hua Chun cheered herself up. Wasn’t this just watching people show affection for each other? She used to witness this every day and didn’t think there was a problem. This was just a different place, and there was nothing to be hypocritical about. The people here were not ashamed of their actions, and so, she shouldn’t rush to be ashamed of others. Other people’s faces were not hers, after all.</p>
<p>After figuring something out, Hua Chun sat upright, put her head down and asked, “May I ask what book your majesty read?”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie frowned, and replied impatiently, “The “Road to Governing the Country,” left by our ancestors.”</p>
<p>“What can one learn from it?”</p>
<p>The emperor went silent.</p>
<p>This person could still ask him so calmly what he had gained from the book? Normal people would not even look at people showing affection. They would have just left. What exactly was Hua Jinghua’s face made of?</p>
<p>“The Minister shouldn’t talk too much,” Hua Chun started, “but you should concentrate on reading the book in order to understand what the book says.”</p>
<p>“Are you scolding at me?” The emperor’s tone became cold and severe.</p>
<p>Her body trembling slightly, Hua Chun immediately shook her head and said, “I would never dare!”</p>
<p>“Then there is no need to say more.”</p>
<p>Ah, then perhaps she should just sit still and do nothing, then.</p>
<p>Huo Zhaoyi wore a smile on her face, but she kept looking at the prime minister next to her. Seeing him sitting with such a serious and handsome expression, she couldn’t help but start to like her.</p>
<p>“Emperor, it’s not good to just let the Minister sit there doing nothing, right? Why don’t you show the Minister some books, too?” She suggested.</p>
