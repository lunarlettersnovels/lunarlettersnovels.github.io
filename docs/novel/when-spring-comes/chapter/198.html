            <p><strong>Chapter 39 – A Futile Dream</strong></p>
<p>“Why bother to pay a visit to our house for such a small thing?” replied Hua Chun, smiling.</p>
<p>For a few moments the hall was silent. Master Hua, along his concubines, was rendered speechless; they didn’t know what to say. Even He Chang’an was brought to a pause as he looked at Hua Chun with a doubtful gaze, “How positive you are. You must have a clear conscience.”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Hua Chun nodded, a dopey grin gracing her lips. But as she caught a glimpse of the bystanders’ expressions, she blinked and stared at the man in front of her. “Pardon, my Duke, an offense to the emperor?” she asked.</p>
<p>Chang’an raised his eyebrows, peering into Hua Chun’s blank eyes, and couldn’t suppress a laugh. “Haven’t you heard what I said?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry but my mind was absent just now…” She excused, a frown crumling her forehead. In reality, she was busy admiring the beauty of the man in front of her. How could she expect that he would have dropped such a grave topic amid the peaceful and jovial atmosphere? Why was he so straightforward?</p>
<p>Amused, Chang’an replied, “Noble Consort Hua has told the Emperor that you cheated him in terms of the issue of furnishing the backyard of Hua Hall. Do you have anything to say about this?”</p>
<p>“Well…” Surprisingly, Hua Chun was barely intimidated. She fist her palm and placed it on top of her chest. “I haven’t cheated the Emperor. I have already asked for the Emperor’s permission before the project began and I am allowed to furnish the backyard according to him.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Chang’an was confused, “But why did he say that he didn’t know it at all?”</p>
<p>“This,” Hua Chun heaved a sigh, “he might be too busy that day to memorize things like this. But I did ask for his permission, with the desire to make our heart peaceful, our lives settled, our house bigger and all of us well. I didn’t dare to start working until the Emperor said yes.”</p>
<p>He Chang’an repeated her words and smiled, “I see.”</p>
<p>The emperor had agreed to make their house bigger, that is, to furnish the backyard. It was not reasonable for Noble Consort Hua to intervene in the project of Hua family. Hua Jinghua was brave enough to propose the explanation, which was reasonable. It should be judged by the secretary before condemning the prime minister. The secretary wouldn’t support Noble Consort Hua if what Hua Jinghua said was totally true. Hua Jinghua wouldn’t be convicted for this issue. However, the emperor might be a little angry about this. But that was not already new; he was always cold and indifferent towards Prime Minister Hua.</p>
<p>Nodding, He Chang’an said, “Now that this is just a mistake, I will explain it to the Emperor.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much,” Hua Chun hurried to stand and salute, “You are so sensible, my Duke.”</p>
<p>Reaching out to support him, He Chang’an replied, “You’re welcome. But I’ll be glad if you invite me for a drink.”</p>
<p><em>‘What?’</em> Hua Chun froze and lifted her head, the tip of her ears turning crimson. According to the law of time travel, it was the supporting character, no less handsome than the protagonist himself, who would fall in love with the heroine. Staring at the gorgeous man in front of her, Hua Chun thought that it would be fantastic if he doted on her as what TV dramas presented, protected her when she was in danger, and loved her forever even if she was married to someone else.</p>
<p>Hua Chun felt good, in her mind flashing the scenes of the second male lead holding the heroine in a bridal carry as they spun in the air, the world blurred behind them, while petals of flowers cascaded above them. He would then carry her gently as they fly out of the palace, beholding the night sky that sparkled with bright golden stars. The whole world would be in awe if she raised her head.</p>
<p>How magnificent, she thought.</p>
<p>But He Chang’an’s words put an end to her beguiling fantasy. He said with a smile, “Our Prime Minister is extraordinary. You are honest and law-abiding. I’ve heard a lot about you and intend to befriend you. If we have similar personalities and ambitions, we could become brothers.”</p>
<p>Brothers. Not a couple.</p>
<p>Hua Chun suddenly awoke from her stupor and looked down at her chest. She had forgotten that the body she wore was destined to be of a man. She was not the heroine; she was the hero. How could a male be in a relationship as she “is” a man? In fact, he might be a rival in love, not a lover. If she had a wife, she ought to be wary that he might cuckold her.</p>
<p>Upon realizing, Hua Chun was very upset. Barely lifting her spirits, she extended her arm to salute, “No problem. You flatter me.”</p>
<p>“Then, I’m going back to the palace and explain the issue to the Emperor,” He Chang’an nodded.</p>
<p>“See you later, my Duke. Take it easy.” Master Hua, who had been standing still, hurried to give Hua Chun a shove to beckon her to company him to leave. Hua Chun understood and went out with He Chang’an, accompanying him to the gate.</p>
