            <p><strong>Chapter 9 – Graced with Generosity</strong></p>
<p>The two servants stepped forward, their arms reaching for Hua Chun. Yet, once the two servants tried lifting her, Hua Chun cried out in a sharp voice, her eyes snapping open to shoot an aggrieved look towards Pin Tan.</p>
<p>“It hurts!”</p>
<p>At the cry, Pin Tan quickly rushed over but held herself back at the last second, realizing they could do nothing to help. “Young Master,” they said, anxiety tainting their voice as they fretted by her side. “Please endure it!”</p>
<p>After a moment’s hesitation, Pin Tan quickly added. “This servant has already exchanged the plaster with a new one. Young Master, do not fear! You will definitely be able to walk more freely.”</p>
<p><em>‘Nonsense! It is still very difficult!’</em></p>
<p>Discouraged, Hua Chun gently shook the servant’s hands off of her and took a few small steps forward herself, her face quickly paling at the action. “Aiya! It’s like I’m a little mermaid who traded her tail for human legs! Every step is like walking on broken glass,” she hissed out immediately without a thought, as the two servants quickly moved to support her again, both wearing worried expressions.</p>
<p>“Young Master?” Pin Tan couldn’t help but blurt out, surprised by the strange foreign words coming out of Hua Chun’s mouth. “What did you just say?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, nothing.” Hua Chun quickly replied, her face morphing into a bitter expression. Of course, they would not know what that meant. How careless of her.</p>
<p>To distract them, Hua Chun quickly asked them to help her change into her uniform and move outside, swallowing a deep sigh. There was no escape from this disaster. With such a group of very persistent old men, the only thing she could do was steel her heart and go to the palace to face her destiny.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister!”</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Hua!”</p>
<p>With merely one step out the door, joyous greetings overwhelmed Hua Chun’s ears, which quickly made her head swivel in their direction. With twinkling eyes full of hope, the old men were delighted at her appearance. One after the other, they all quickly moved to surround her while also giving her a clear path to tread. Just like that, they all made their way outside the Hua Mansion while filling Hua Chun’s ears with chatter.</p>
<p>Upon stepping outside, Grand Secretary Li stepped out from the ranks, a grand smile on his face as he bowed, gesturing a hand forward.</p>
<p>“Knowing that it is troublesome for the Prime Minister to walk, these officials have prepared some footmen and a sedan chair. Please sit, Prime Minister Hua.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun, who had her head down to hide her bitter expression, cleared her face and looked up, her expression quickly morphing into one of surprise. In front of her were four footmen and a sedan chair that looked like it was made from a tiger’s skin and fur. That’s right! Genuine tiger skin and fur!</p>
<p>Speechless for a moment, Hua Chun could not help but just stare in a daze. What were these old men thinking? Feeling a cold sweat creep onto her back, she cast a nervous look at the smiling officials, then back at the elaborate display.</p>
<p><em>‘If I sat on this, wouldn’t I be able to experience the emperor’s point of view?’</em></p>
<p>Frowning at the thought, Hua Chun shifted in place. Everyone had prepared this for her, but… wasn’t it inappropriate? Racking her brain for an excuse, her gaze drifted off to the old officials, the sight causing her thoughts to freeze. Ah… seeing these expectant faces, it was hard to refuse. Squirming underneath their collective gaze, Hua Chun took an awkward step forward and settled herself on the sedan chair, sighing. Really, these old men were not her match.</p>
<p>Seeing Hua Chun settled, Grand Preceptor Tang shouted, his voice tinged with excitement. “Move! To the Imperial Court!”</p>
<p>On command, the porters lifted Hua Chun, and five or six old courtiers gathered around their shoulders before moving out in tandem, escorting her to the palace gates, where she had to switch sedan chairs.</p>
<p>The magnificent chair felt no different from that of the emperor’s.</p>
<p>In all honesty, Hua Chun was stunned at the situation. “In the Imperial Palace, isn’t there no other choice but to walk around?” She asked out loud, her face twisting into a concerned expression, her stomach feeling like it was weighed down with stones.</p>
<p>She remembered coming across such a sentence in an ancient book. It stated that, upon entering the palace, regardless of your rank, one must disembark from their sedans, carriages or horses, and walk the rest of their way. Was it possible that this dynasty was different?</p>
<p>Hearing those words, Grand Secretary Li could not help but smile and offer a small nod of his head with his answer.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister need not worry. Yesterday, the Empress Dowager issued a decree, if Prime Minister Hua was to attend court, he was to be granted a sedan chair that was equivalent to the Empress’ to use.”</p>
<p><em>‘What?!’</em> Hua Chun stifled her surprise, her eyes tearing up as she stifled a cough, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>Although she was actually a woman, the prime minister was at least a man on the surface, right? Wasn’t it a little strange to be given a tool the same as the Empress’ to use?</p>
<p>With that thought, Hua Chun turned her watery eyes towards the Grand Secretary. But before she could comment on the matter, Grand Preceptor Tang quickly chimed in, trying to ease Hua Chun’s worries.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister does not have to worry. The Empress Dowager was in charge of everything. The Emperor will not criticize you or anything. Now, it’s getting late. Let’s go to Xuanzheng Hall as soon as possible.</p>
