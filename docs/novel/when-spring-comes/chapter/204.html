            <p><strong>Chapter 33 – Punishment (2)</strong></p>
<p>Hua Chun lied on the beam and slept for a while. When she was awakened by a noise, her face was tainted with the ashes on the beam.</p>
<p>“Jump down,” Yu Wenjie said without lifting his head. He didn’t speak anything else afterward. Hua Chun found his demand ridiculous. Gritting her teeth, she replied: “Emperor, I am not good at martial arts. I’ll get hurt if I jump down.”</p>
<p>Hearing the sound originating from above, He Chang’an was a little surprised. He took a look at the emperor, walked a few steps forward, and looked up at the beam. He stared at the unfortunate silhouette of Hua Chun and asked, “What are you doing, Minister?”</p>
<p>At the smooth voice, Hua Chun looked down immediately. What a handsome man! She stared at the stranger below.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister,” Yu Wenjie said unpleasantly, “haven’t I told you to be punctual for the meeting?”</p>
<p>Hua Chun shifted her gaze, catching a glimpse of the emperor. She couldn’t help but shiver. “Your Majesty, I’m wounded and I am unable to get down.”</p>
<p>He Chang’an blinked and looked at the Emperor. He had been away from Yanjing for a long time, so he was not familiar with Hua Jinghua, a very well-known name. He thought Hua Jinghua would be a serious person, but he was surprised to see him with his own eyes today.</p>
<p>Hua Jinghua’s eyes were bright like the stars, but what He Chang’an didn’t know was that the stars in his eyes were because Hua Chun had caught sight of handsome boys. Her eyes would shine brighter if the boy was more handsome, and they could be turned into crescent moons if she met someone extraordinarily handsome.</p>
<p>“Come down!” Yu Wenjie was very annoyed when he saw his vulnerable image, and he didn’t say anything else besides those two words.</p>
<p>His Majesty was so fierce that Hua Chun wanted to cry. Looking at the ground ten feet from her while she massaged her aching bottom, Hua Chun’s facial expression turned grave. As the old saying went, ‘If the king wants the minister to die, then the minister would have no choice but to kill himself.’</p>
<p>Hua Chun blinked and slowly raised herself, trembling. He Chang’an stared at the slim figure dressed in a loose robe and frowned slightly. However, Yu Wenjie was rather calm and even stepped back to leave some room for Hua Chun.</p>
<p>Eunuch Qin repeatedly wiped the beads of sweat on his temples, giving Huo Zichong a signal to help Hua Chun.</p>
<p>Hua Zichong had already prepared for that. He would try his best to catch Prime Minister Hua for the court even if the emperor hadn’t ordered him to do so. Hua Chun was so thin that she, as a person who was unacquainted with martial arts, would undoubtedly get hurt once she jumped from such a height without a buffer. Hence, they all were well-prepared on the right side of the beam. Hua Chun aimed for the soft couch on the left side. She closed her eyes tightly and braced herself.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister!” Huo Zichong was frozen in nervousness, he could barely utter a word. Wouldn’t it be more painful if she landed on the low table beside the soft couch?</p>
<p>It was obvious that Yu Wenjie was surprised by her action. However, he reacted more quickly than Huo Zichong, reaching out his hands in an attempt to catch Hua Chun, but he was slower than He Chang’an, who had fixed his eyes at Hua Chun for a long time.</p>
<p>After a series of instinctive ludicrous postures in the air, Hua Chun fell into He Chang’an’s arms. The strong impact threw He Chang’an towards the low table while Hua Chun fell to the ground. Hua Chun gasped and picked herself up upon landing on the ground. Looking at the man behind her, her face turned pale as she asked, “Are you okay?” She had heard the sound of impact.</p>
<p>“Chang’an?” The Emperor also felt a hint of worry, approaching He Chang’an.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Just a minor injury” He Chang’an frowned and put his hands over his waist. “As long as the Prime Minister is fine.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun was filled with shame and unease, but she shouldn’t be blamed for this. She had intended to jump directly to the softest part of the couch as there was only that furniture to serve as a buffer.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. I will never forget this favor you did today,” Hua Chun curtsied to He Chang’an,“I will call at your house in person to make amends as long as I leave the palace.” She lowered her head, blue veins on her neck were visible because of the strain. He Chang’an laughed lightly and his eyes strangely grew tender. “You don’t have to be nervous, Prime Minister Hua.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie frowned and looked at Hua Chun. “Leave the palace as early as you can. I have something to say to the Duke.”</p>
<p>How could the man that was to blame for all those things talk to her in such an accusatory tone? Hua Chun was so angry that she rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Your Majesty!” He Chang’an leaned against the back of the couch, watching that slim person leave. He then turned his head to the Emperor and asked, “How did he get on the beam?”</p>
<p>“It’s a long story.” Yu Wenjie pursed his lips. “Do you want to visit the court doctor?”</p>
<p>“He is not that heavy.” He Chang’an looked down at his hands. “He is so thin. What have you done to our little Prime Minister concerning the country and people to make him that lean?”</p>
<p>“How could I know?” asked Yu Wenjie grimly. “He might be eating more snacks than meals. It has nothing to do with me.”</p>
<p>“Alright…” He Chang’an shrugged and asked, “Haven’t you beaten him a few days ago? Doesn’t it count?”</p>
<p>The two have been good friends while they grew up with each other, enjoying a close relationship and usually paying no heed to the status of each other. Yu Wenjie couldn’t blame He Chang’an for those words and only shifted the conversation to another topic. “Do you know the Zichen Hall was locked down last night?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied He Chang’an. “I have sent people to investigate the issue. But as you know, that guy is scrupulous and would never leave any accusation. Anyway, if he was the architect of the plot, the Empress would speak for him.”</p>
<p>“Leave it alone.” Yu Wenjie said, “You just need to figure it out and keep the evidence intact.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
