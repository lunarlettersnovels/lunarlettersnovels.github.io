            <p><strong>Chapter 42 – Stuck with the Emperor (1)</strong></p>
<p>The emperor shook his head and said, “You are so superficial. Isn’t it too mean to judge a person by her face?” There was no one else that was shameless enough to speak these words in the whole imperial city. He Chang’an shook his head resignedly, “but why didn’t you marry that princess? I have noticed her strong desire to be a part of your harem.”</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie was silent. He had a higher standard of beauty than He Chang’an did. Moreover, that princess couldn’t be regarded as a woman; how could she become one of his concubines? It was reasonable to send her back where she came from.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>He Chang’an was about to make a mockery of him when Eunuch Qin came in and said, “Wanbao Hall has been spruced up and the resident also has been welcomed.”</p>
<p>“Good,” nodded Yu Wenjie. He stood up and said, “this thing is okay then. As for Noble Consort Hua, I have my way to deal with her. It’s late now and you are supposed to leave.”</p>
<p>“Your subject obeys.”</p>
<p>Glancing at Eunuch Qin, He Chang’an also stood to withdraw. Yu Wenjie watched him leave and headed to Wanbao Hall.</p>
<p>“Is there a new woman in Wanbao Hall?” He Chang’an asked a eunuch as they were walking on the road.</p>
<p>The guide was also a eunuch serving the emperor. He responded in a wonderful attitude, “Yes. The emperor has taken the fourth daughter of Huo Family and bestowed on her Wanbao Hall for her breathtaking beauty.”</p>
<p>The fourth daughter of the Huo Family? In bewilderment, He Chang’an thought that title sounded familiar. Although he had been away from the imperial city for a long time, he remembered that words came that the fourth daughter of the Huo Family was the first imperial city’s beauty. She had long lived in her purdah, but her portrait was popular in the city and was admired by many people.</p>
<p>Yu Wenjie loved beauties. No wonder he would have married her. Without a second thought, He Chang’an left the palace.</p>
<p>The next day, Hua Chun came to the palace dynamically and stated the details of the disaster relief. The emperor was greatly pleased and even praised her for the first time.</p>
<p>“My Prime Minister finally has done something practical.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun regarded these words as praise, no matter how ambiguous they were. Only a praise was the reward for her dark circles! Hua Chun went out of the court in delight. She was about to leave the palace when two eunuchs stopped her.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister, the Queen wants to see you.”</p>
<p><em>‘What? The queen?’</em> Hua Chun widened her eyes. She was dragged by them to sprint before figuring out what the queen wanted from her. They were so fast that when the emperor came out to have a small talk with the prime minister, he didn’t see a trace of him.</p>
<p>Hua Chun was frustrated. She had a foot to walk on her own. Was there any reason to be dragged by them? And now that the queen’s hall was distant from the front court, why didn’t they arrange some vehicle for her? Few minutes later she retracted her feet, with her arms on the two eunuchs’ shoulders, and swung towards Huiming Hall.</p>
<p>There was a serious smell of incense. She felt a sense of tension once she entered the palace. She felt that she would immediately see an old lady wearing loads of jewels reclining on the couch, staring at her seriously.</p>
<p>“I come to meet you here, my Queen.” Kneeling down in front of the curtain, Hua Chun didn’t dare look up. She just kept staring at the pattern on the persian carpet.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, Prime Minister Hua.”</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, her voice was as gentle as a feather sweeping over the redwood table, “Yuejian, bring others away from here. The Prime Minister is not an outsider. There is no need for others to stay here.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lady,” responded the maid next to her. She immediately brought other eunuchs and maids outside like a combine.</p>
<p>Hua Chun became more nervous after the door of the hall was closed.</p>
<p>“Come here, Jinghua.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun was dumbfounded. The queen had called her name in such a gentle voice, which felt strange. The queen had requested the emperor to visit her after she was badly beaten. She also had bestowed on her a seat in the court. Reflecting upon it, Hua Chun wondered why the relationship between Prime Minister Hua and the queen was so good.</p>
<p>Staggering to her feet, Hua Chun felt an ominous foreboding. The secrets of the palace were unspeakable. What if the queen had a preference for Hua Jinghua’s handsome face? That would be terrible! Having blinked for a few times, she pulled back the curtain in front of her, feeling as if she was about to be killed. The queen looked at her kindly, dressed in formal clothes in the colors black and red, which was the manner to meet the officials. On the other hand, Hua Chun couldn’t help but feel filthy. Nonetheless, she hurried to reach out her hands to salute, “Do you have anything to assign me, my Queen?”</p>
<p>“I need your help,” The queen sighed slightly, “yesterday the Emperor welcomed Lady Huo into the palace and bestowed on her Wanbao Hall. She was named Zhaoyi this morning.”</p>
<p>Hua Chun frowned unconsciously. The man who appeared cold and indifferent was rather engaged in beauty. Her favor to the emperor had declined. Perhaps it was his passion to be a playboy. He had doted on Noble Consort Hua a few days ago, if she was not mistaken. But it was none of her business. What was the queen thinking to call her here?<br>
