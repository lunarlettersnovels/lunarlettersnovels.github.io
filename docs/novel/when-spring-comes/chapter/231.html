            <p><strong>Chapter 6 – The Sausage Spirit</strong></p>
<p>How bad God’s temper was today, Hua Chun could tell with just one episode.</p>
<p>Although these words were all right if she actually said these to the emperor… She was afraid she would be beaten again!</p>
<p>Shivering at the thought, Hua Chun was instantly terrified. Casting a glance at the innocent old men in front of her, she tensed awkwardly. In the back of her mind, all she wanted to do was shake her head and refuse.</p>
<p>But before she could do it, an old man, whose face was covered with age spots, suddenly let out a cry, “Prime Minister!”</p>
<p>The sound was so loud that Hua Chun quivered with fear and looked at the old man in horror.</p>
<p>Grand Secretary Li cleared his voice and said, “If you don’t help us convince and advise the Emperor, this country will surely perish! Rather than watching the country founded by the first Emperor die with our very own eyes, these old ministers might as well go directly to see the former Emperor!”</p>
<p>After he said this, the rest of the people quickly stepped up and echoed his words, their faces carrying the determination to die and the deep sorrow over the thought of losing one’s own country. With a sad expression, he continued.</p>
<p>“If the Prime Minister doesn’t want to take any more risks, please collect and bring home the corpses of these old officials! We do not deserve a peaceful death! We beg you! Take our bones away! Instead of burying our bones here, bury them in the mountains! Let them stay away from Yanjing! We do not have the face to face the ancestors of the Yuwen dynasty!”</p>
<p>With these words, the cries of grief circulated, as if they were taking part in a memorial service. Their cries were so loud that outsiders, who were unaware of the situation, could not help but take a peek, fearing that Prime Minister Hua’s condition suddenly took a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>Hua Chun looked at them with a troubled expression.</p>
<p>All these people in front of her were ancient, to the point where she may have had to call them ‘grandpa’. Yet, in front of Hua Chun, they knelt on their knees and begged. Seeing this, Hua Chun couldn’t bear to refuse. But it took a little courage to say yes.</p>
<p>As she was overwhelmed with the scene that had happened, Hua Chun remembered the mighty rod that left her in agonizing pain. Worriedly, she secretly reached for her behind and whispered to herself. “God… so painful… it’ll take at least 100 days for me to recover. If they give this job to me, wouldn’t it be too late?”</p>
<p>Despite muttering in a whispered voice, Grand Preceptor Tang heard Hua Chun’s words and hurriedly took out some ointment from his sleeve, quickly handing it over to her. Hua Chun was surprised by this old man as he was seen sobbing, and next second, a smile was painted on his face.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Prime Minister! This old official came to deliver medicine today. With this Shujing Huoluo ointment, all your pain will be gone! With this, I guarantee that you will be able to move around as soon as tomorrow!”</p>
<p><em>‘Ah? It was that amazing?’ </em>Curious, Hua Chun reached out and looked.</p>
<p>‘…<em>Ah!’</em></p>
<p>The smell was awful, and the color was so dark that it left her doubtful. But she did read some history books, and many wild stories talked about the magic of these ancient plasters. Shooting a glance at the men before her, Hua Chun then bowed her head down and thought. All these old men seemed anxious for her, it seemed that they only wanted what’s best for her. So, logically, there was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, Hua Chun said, “Then I shall try this medicine first. If my injuries feel better tomorrow, this official will go to the palace and meet the Emperor. If not… I would like to ask each one of you to not feel distressed.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Several old officials laughed, nodded, and showed their respect to the prime minister before they finally left with the servant Pin Tan seeing them off, completing all the necessary courtesies. When the servant returned, she squatted by Hua Chan’s bedside, casting a worried look at her.</p>
<p>“Young Master, you should take care of yourself.”</p>
<p>Hearing those words, Hua Chun’s face morphed into a bitter expression. <em>‘How was she going to take care of herself?’</em> Bearing the identity of Prime Minister Hua Cheng, with their responsibilities, it was like killing herself every day!</p>
