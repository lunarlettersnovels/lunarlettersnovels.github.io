            <p><strong>Chapter 62 – Plotting Marriage (1)</strong></p>
<p>Seeing that he was so grateful for a woman, Yu Wenjie’s expression evidently showed his disapproval, but after thinking about it, he also found this a little strange.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister…”</p>
<p>“Ah!” Upon hearing this, a shocked Hua Chun quickly turned to look at him. “Emperor, what are your orders?”</p>
<p>“How old are you?”</p>
<p>What was with the sudden question? Hua Chun felt at a loss that she couldn’t help but answer honestly. “I’m older than twenty.”</p>
<p>Ordinary men should be married at this age, right? Yu Wenjie raised his eyebrows. He Chang’an did not marry because his parents were gone and no one forced him to do so. But as Hua Jinghua’s son, how could he have not married yet? Looking down at her white neck again, the emperor squinted, feeling like something was amiss. After thinking for a long time, he asked again. “Do you like women?”</p>
<p>At the same time that Hua Chun had gone silent, Chang’an began to protest. “First you accuse me. Now, you doubt Jinghua. In your eyes, are other men not normal?”</p>
<p>“No.” Yu Wenjie frowned. “Don’t you think he is strange?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Hua Chun’s heart sank. Was she about to get caught?</p>
<p>“I’m already weak, so I haven’t gotten married yet. In addition to this, I’ve always been caught up in unpleasant situations these days…” He glanced up and down at Hua Jinghua.</p>
<p>At this point, Hua Chun felt as if her face had whitened to the brink of death. She hung her head quickly, trying to conceal her expression. Although she was a newcomer and many of the rules were still unclear, she could still see that the crime of deceiving the monarch was very serious. If she were to make a mistake, she would be exiled by the whole family. When the imperial court became the prime minister, wouldn’t it be full of copycats?</p>
<p>In short, if Hua Chun were to get exposed, it wouldn’t matter at all if the emperor was her elder brother. Her uncle would be useless during that situation, and she would still face the severity of her actions. Her crime was too great to overlook.</p>
<p>Therefore, before the emperor could continue to guess, Hua Chun gritted her teeth and interrupted him. “The second master was wrong. Jinghua has never married because he didn’t meet the right person, and didn’t want to lead other girls on.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yu Wenjie regarded him closely. “I heard that Taishi Tang and Li Zhongtang are both interested in granting you the daughters of their family. Are these two daughters still inappropriate for you?”</p>
<p>With cold sweat running down her back, Hua Chun solemnly answered, “The two daughters are definitely knowledgeable and gentle, but their destiny does not lie in the Jinghua bloodline, so…” Fate was definitely a good excuse. Though it sounded ridiculous to her, the people of this era definitely took topics such as destiny seriously.</p>
<p>However, the emperor still looked doubtful. He looked him up and down and replied, “It’s understandable if you haven’t married, but how did I hear that, besides a maid serving you in your daily life, there is no woman beside you?”</p>
<p>If abstinence could be solved the way He Chang’an did with his, then coming to the brothel would definitely be a solution. Looking at his strange appearance, he must have never even come to a brothel before. As a man, how on earth could he solve his normal physical needs?</p>
<p>Hua Chun smiled awkwardly. “There are not so many appealing women around. Besides, I really fell in love with the young girl I met today today, and I will take her back to the mansion.  Perhaps she is my destiny.”</p>
<p>At this, Qing Niao appeared moved. She snuggled into Hua Chun upon hearing her words.</p>
<p>Hua Chun only stiffened in reply, however, her face turning green. She then leaned over at an angle that would be beneficial to her. Although her chest had been tied tightly, she was still afraid that the woman in front of her would comment on how Hua Chun’s chest muscles were so defined.</p>
<p>After watching Qing Niao nervously for a long time, she found that the latter could only smile at her shyly, blushing without speaking at all.</p>
<p>Slightly startled, Hua Chun looked at her, feeling more like her girlfriend. Qing Niao was also a good-looking, gentle little princess. Every time she saw her, she would lean against her, making her feel small in an instant. That was right; Qin Niao was a little bird, and Hua Chun was a strong tree in comparison.</p>
<p>The affection for this little girl in her heart was also rapidly rising. However, Hua Chun couldn’t help but shiver and frown, a multitude of thoughts running through her mind. The little girl she had just met, how could she make her feel so comfortable?</p>
<p>This entangled thought soon turned into a staring contest between the two. In He Chang’an and Yu Wenjie’s eyes, it seemed that having the Langqing concubine meant something to the prime minister. And so, the emperor swallowed the rest of his doubts, turned his head, and then glanced at the woman next to him.</p>
<p>He didn’t know why, but he didn’t seem to like these types of coquettish women recently. They were all soft, meaningless. It now seemed better to choose someone who dared to confront him. It would definitely make the palace a little more fun. The harem had also been a bit empty, recently. Thinking of this, the emperor stood up and said, “It’s late, let’s go back to the palace.” Seeing that the emperor was somewhat distracted, He Chang’an nodded in his stead.<br>
