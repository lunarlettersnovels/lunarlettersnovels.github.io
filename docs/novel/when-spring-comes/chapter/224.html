            <p><strong>Chapter 13 –  The Emperor is in a Good Mood (3)</strong></p>
<p>“…Alright.” Yu Wenjie drawled out, his brown eyes glinting but unreadable. “I will grant you your request, Prime Minister. Everyone else, you may now retire. The morning court session is over. Prime Minister…” Yu Wenjie paused, watching as Hua Chun’s head jolted up in surprise to look at him. “Proceed to the Imperial Study.” He finished as he pushed himself off his throne, the difference in height emphasizing his majestic aura.</p>
<p>With that, all the officials in the hall sighed in relief and quickly knelt down, one after the other. Following their examples, Hua Chun bowed her head yet again and chimed in unison: “Long live the Emperor!”</p>
<p>Nodding at the farewell, Yu Wenjie strode down the staircase to the side and walked out of the hall, sparing no other glance at the contingent that he left behind. His manservant, Eunuch Qin, however, stayed behind to assist the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>After calming herself down from the surprising shock, Hua Chun gingerly and awkwardly rose from her earlier position, her face wincing at the sudden jolts of pain, here and there. Seeing Eunuch Qin stretch his hand out, Hua Chun gratefully bowed her head for a quick time before taking it and allowing him to help her out of the hall.</p>
<p>Grand Secretary Li, Grand Preceptor Tang, and the other officials stood in place and watched as Hua Chun walked out, not missing her minute expressions of pain. One of them could not help but speak out, his voice coated in emotion: “The prime minister seems to have been enlightened after the emperor ordered for him to be caned. Today, he actually did not butt heads with the emperor.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Grand Preceptor Tang quickly responded with enthusiasm, wiping the tears that were gathering in the outer corners of his eyes. “This old man finally sees hope. If the prime minister continues to talk well, then the emperor will naturally listen! Aiya! If I die today, I will not be ashamed to face the first emperor!”</p>
<p>Murmurs of agreement quickly rose up before sighs were heard all around. ’<em>Today is really auspicious.’</em> They all thought collectively before bidding one another goodbye as they left the hall in twos and threes, each one happily thinking of dinner and wishing for the prime minister and the emperor’s continued amity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hua Chun continued to trail after the emperor’s back, with the aid of Eunuch Qin. It was but a moment after that she actually remembered to be afraid.</p>
<p>She had actually talked back to the Emperor! Thinking back to her earlier words, a layer of cold sweat washed down her back, her hands subconsciously tightening. As the Emperor, Yu Wenjie frightened her more than the tiger-faced businessmen* that she used to battle within her past life.</p>
<p>*tiger faced – I’m presuming this to mean fierce individuals that you need to be careful of because you’ll never know when they’ll threaten you</p>
<p>Eunuch Qin, who felt Hua Chun’s grip on his arm tighten, could not help but smile exasperatedly before whispering, “The Prime Minister need not be nervous.” When Hua Chun turned her eyes on him and relaxed her grip, the Eunuch Qin continued, “The Emperor is in a good mood today.”</p>
<p><em>‘Good mood?’</em> Hua Chun thought to herself, shooting an incredulous look towards the manservant as he looked forward. ’<em>What good mood, ah?</em> <em>Did you not see his manner of speaking at the court hall?’ </em>Shaking her head, Hua Chun adjusted her posture, wiping off the expression as she looked in the same direction. ’<em>Well, if his manservant says he’s in a good mood… I must not aggravate him.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…I wonder what the Emperor is like when he’s angry.’</em> Hua Chun thought to herself as she subconsciously tightened her grip on both Eunuch Qin’s arm and the notes hidden in her other sleeve, her expression going dire. ’<em>I am just a simple forwarding station. He will not get mad at me, right?’</em></p>
<p>As she comforted herself, Yu Wenjie finally reached the doors of the imperial study, with Hua Chun and Eunuch Qin arriving a short few moments after. With a wave of his hands, the servants around the vicinity, including Eunuch Qin, all walked out; the door resounding with a load ‘Dan!’ as they left the prime minister and the emperor alone.</p>
<p>At the sound, Hua Chun could not help but internally panic, keeping her head bowed down as she gripped the hidden notes in her hand, as though it was a protective talisman. ’<em>Aiya, that sound… I am not going to be executed, ah?!’</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yu Wenjie strode further into the room, situating himself behind the only desk there, quickly adopting a simple yet imposing form.</p>
<p>“Didn’t the Prime Minister have something to report? Quickly! Say it!” Yu Wenjie ordered after the silence continued for some time. ’<em>Really, was this prime minister really silly?’</em></p>
<p>“Minister Hua.” He stressed as he saw Hua Chun jolt into action, the short form quickly taking out the notes that were hidden in her sleeves and laying them down before him in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty! This humble official implores Your Highness to look through these notes!”</p>
