            <p><strong>Chapter 58 – The Three Brothers (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Release me!”</p>
<p>“No, no, no!” Hua Chun quickly replied as she tightened her grip on his form. “Second Master, have mercy! If you throw me down from this height, I will be injured, no, I would die! My head would hit the pavement!”</p>
<p>Squeezing his form once more, she continued: “Second Master, please. Hear me out! I personally think that I am still beneficial to the development of the country. Second Master, I can help the economy, a! Don’t be impulsive! ”</p>
<p>As Hua Chun continued to chatter on, Yu Wenjie’s face continued to darken as he glared at his subordinate.</p>
<p><em>‘Really? What is wrong with you’? </em>Yu Wenjie thought as he gritted his teeth while ceaselessly trying to pry Hua Chun’s octopus-like hold off. ‘<em>Do you not know shame, Prime Minister? Two men hugging in broad daylight—does this not make your face tingle?!’</em></p>
<p>Furious, Yu Wenjie turned to look at the dumbfounded He Chang’an. Seeing his still form, the emperor’s patience finally snapped. With an icy tone, he said: “Are you still watching? Come and pry him off!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty!” He Chang’an replied reflexively, the strength behind Yu Wenjie’s voice quickly returning him to his senses. He Chang’an quickly walked over to tug at Hua Chun’s limbs while offering soothing words to the frightened prime minister.</p>
<p>“Hua Jinghua, come down quickly. Don’t worry, His Majesty will not throw you. But, if you continue to hold on—well, don’t say I didn’t warn you…”</p>
<p>As He Chang’an coaxed the frightened prime minister like a child, he aimed a glance at the frustrated emperor, who merely snorted in response as he stood stoically. Afterall, despite his actions, Yu Wenjie was not that angry—just frustrated at Hua Chun’s joke.</p>
<p><em>‘Well, it’s alright now, knowing that everyone is okay.’ </em>He Chang’an thought as one hand continued to tug at Hua Chun’s arm, while the other patted his back. ‘<em>Though, I must commend Hua Jinghua for his foresight and the joke that he played. Afterall, for a small moment, Yu Wenjie did realize and admit his own mistakes.’</em></p>
<p>After hearing He Chang’an’s words, Hua Chun quickly calmed down and immediately released the emperor and stepped away while forcing a rather dry smile on her face. On the inside, she was panicking.</p>
<p><em>‘Aiya, what is wrong with me? Why did I cling onto Yu Wenjie like that? He Chang’an was right. If Yu Wenjie actually had no plans to throw her then, after clinging onto him like a crazy concubine, he surely would have changed his mind!’</em></p>
<p>Repressing a frustrated grunt, Hua Chun guiltily glanced at Yu Wenjie’s form and winced, her shoulders and head quickly falling into a slump. After all, Yu Wenjie was staring at her with narrowed eyes, his lips curled into a small snarl as one hand continuously moved over his wrinkled clothes.</p>
<p>Keeping her head bowed, Hua Chun’s thoughts raced. ‘<em>Yu Wenjie, a! You clearly suffer from a stiff face all year round! Yet, you actually throw such a disgusting look my way. Aiya, should I be regarded as a bull?’</em></p>
<p>With a sigh, Hua Chun places a hand against her racing heart.<em> ‘Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid. Yu Wenjie can be considered my elder brother now. Even if he wants to choke me to death, he wouldn’t be allowed to do it. He Chang’an would stop him!’</em></p>
<p>At that moment, Hua Chun felt that He Chang’an was really a wise man. By leveraging their relationship as ‘sworn brothers’, he could easily save Hua Jinghua from the emperor’s wrath. Now, she would be able to outright say whatever she wanted to say in the future. There was no need to fear offending Yu Wenjie, he wouldn’t be able to do anything to her, anyway. That’d be a great help to not only the court officials but, also to the country, as a whole!</p>
<p>Unknown to her, the latter path of her thoughts was part of the reason why He Chang’an decided on becoming ‘sworn brothers’ with her. Protecting the life of this kind of prime minister, the kind that was rarely seen in a century, would be a boon to everyone. That was a fact that He Chang’an wholeheartedly believed in. Ever since Yu Wenjie struck the prime minister—both of their temperaments changed for the better.</p>
<p>If the emperor ever loses his temper and takes it out on Hua Chun—what if that’d lead to another change? The country would lose a great prime minister! Therefore, in a way, He Chang’an was also working hard for the country and its people.</p>
<p>“Anyway…” He Chang’an spoke up. “The assassins have already been caught. We—”</p>
<p>At the same instant, Yu Wenjie spoke, cutting him off mid-sentence: “It is time to go back.”</p>
