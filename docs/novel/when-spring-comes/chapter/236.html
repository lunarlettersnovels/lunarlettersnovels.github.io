            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 1 – The God You Called Is Online (1)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every month when she was suffering with dysmenorrhea, Hua Chun would pray to heaven, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“God, please make me a man so that I won’t have to endure this pain and so I could go everywhere, jump and pee without worries, whistle at beautiful ladies and hug handsome men casually.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was such a wonderful thing to think about!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, when she finally turned into a man, Hua Chun was a little flustered as she lay down in front of the many people all staring at her bottom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene felt awkward and left Hua Chun speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One second, she was crying in front of the computer screen yelling, “Give the Prime Minister to me instead!” and the next second, a wide rod hit her behind as punishment from the court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was more painful than being slapped by her father when she was a child. As soon as the beating ended, she screamed inconsolably in pain. Her voice was as loud as a rooster crowing at six o’clock in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spectators had not expected for Hua Chun to cry so loudly that it gave everybody in the scene a shock. Suddenly, an old man with a white beard jumped out from the side, knelt not far ahead of her, and kowtowed towards the steps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty, although Prime Minister Hua was reckless with his words, his loyalty still remains! He absolutely had no intention of disobedience, and we ask the emperor to punish him lightly!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The line sounds familiar. She seems to have heard it somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the audience, many were astonished at the old man’s action. But then, these people on both sides knelt down like dumplings, crying out for sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty, Prime Minister Hua’s words were for the sake of the country and the people! Honest advice is hard to take! Please forgive him, Emperor!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old minister was willing to be punished on behalf of the Prime Minister and had asked the Emperor not to make this loyal person die from punishment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The palace servant who beat Hua Chun seemed to be moved by this scene and so he stopped. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Hua Chun laboriously raised her head and glanced up the steps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene in front of her seemed familiar, as if she had seen it from somewhere. There were eight jade steps with the honor guard standing below it. There was a beautiful imperial concubine on the left and a beardless father-in-law on the right. The emperor was standing in the middle dressed in a five-clawed Dragon robe. His appearance couldn’t be seen clearly. She could only see his tall figure that gave people an inexplicable oppressive feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing so many people knelt out, the emperor seemed to smile. His eyes pierced through the air and fell on the palace servant beside Hua Chun. And with just one look, the palace servant immediately raised the rod and hit her again! The strength and speed that felt like smashing rice cakes caused Hua Chun to cry desperately in pain.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of misfortune is this?!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hua Chun cried helplessly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All she remembered was watching a beautiful tv series at home and seeing a wonderful place. But now a violent and unruly king wanted to castigate the handsome Prime Minister. How had she become beaten in a blink of an eye? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pain reminded her that this was no longer a dream. Hua Chun, who was born in well-off family had never suffered or been tired her entire life. After less than 20 strokes, her eyes rolled to the back of her head and she passed out. The young Prime Minister Hua could no longer withstand the ancient rod punishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Prime Minister Hua!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Prime Minister!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All she could hear were the heart piercing cries from a few old men in the crowd then Hua Chun’s vision plunged into darkness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun tried to recall everything from before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had just quit her job and was not in a good mood and so her best friend recommended her a TV series, a total of 9 and was even better than an AV* to cheer her up. It was a story rich in plot and full of well-written characters. In short, it was worth seeing So, she shut up herself inside her room and watched it alone.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*AV – Adult Video</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story was inspirational. It was about a young Prime Minister. As the only son of the Hua family, he entered the court at the age of twenty and assisted the ill-tempered Emperor of the Ming dynasty. As soon as she saw the second episode, Hua Chun could not help but become attracted to the handsome and alluring young Prime Minister in the film.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oddly enough, the actors in the tv series are fresh faces and none of them were famous celebrities, but somehow, she felt very fond of it. Especially with the Prime Minister, who was too handsome and disciplined, and allured the people around him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, when the dumb emperor blamed the Prime Minister Hua Chun, she could not help but yell at the computer screen: “Let go of the prime minister and let him come to me!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a loud noise was heard from the sky as if God had torn the clouds with a lightning bolt. And then, a white light burst from the screen she was watching from. And now.. Hua Chun was lying down in the court having been beaten severely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hua Chun had transmigrated to this world.</span></p>
