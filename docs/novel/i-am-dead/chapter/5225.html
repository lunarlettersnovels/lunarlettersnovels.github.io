            <p><strong>Chapter 6.2</strong></p>
<p>I held my trembling hands. Miss Yena had ALS? She seemed perfectly fine.</p>
<p>“Is it curable?”</p>
<p>“It’s incurable, which is why this is considered a miracle. I was astonished. This is something I would want to report to the medical community. But we promised the Honorary Chairman to keep this a secret.”</p>
<p>I was in shock. Miss Yena had ALS. More questions arose.</p>
<p>“When did I get diagnosed?”</p>
<p>His face filled with sympathy.</p>
<p>“You really don’t remember, do you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You first came to me when you entered middle school. You came with the Honorary Chairman. Initially, there were suspicious symptoms, and you were formally diagnosed with ALS when you started university.”</p>
<p>That was when Miss Yena was studying abroad.</p>
<p>“The Honorary Chairman sent you abroad for your studies, and I know you received treatment there. It was a cover for the treatment.”</p>
<p>Director Han continued.</p>
<p>“We thought the symptoms would stop around that time, but when you returned to South Korea, you were hospitalized. Since then, the disease gradually worsened. Do you remember that?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Every month, under the pretext of the Honorary Chairman’s health checkup, you would come secretly for tests. But we never expected you to recover like this. We’ll need to keep monitoring, but for now, it seems safe to say you’re fine.”</p>
<p>I pressed my palm against my chest to calm my racing heart. I had no idea Miss Yena had such an illness. I was also terrified by my grandfather’s meticulous planning. How could he keep this hidden for over a decade?</p>
<p>“Do the family members know?”</p>
<p>Director Han’s face hardened.</p>
<p>“The Honorary Chairman kept it a secret from them for this very reason. The only people who know are you, me, and the Honorary Chairman.”</p>
<p>“Is there any risk of the medical records being leaked?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to worry about that.”</p>
<p>“But doesn’t Professor Han Eui-jin know?”</p>
<p>His expression turned peculiar.</p>
<p>“Do you not remember Professor Han Euijin either?”</p>
<p>I tried to stay as calm as possible.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“She’s my daughter. She won’t let this information slip.”</p>
<p>I sighed in relief. It was a good decision to claim amnesia.</p>
<p>As I walked back to the hospital room, my mind was filled with thoughts. Miss Yena wasn’t part of the family’s corruption that I had been uncovering. I didn’t see her as an enemy or as someone necessary for my divorce. Most importantly, she was the only person who had been kind to me.</p>
<p>Her health had suddenly deteriorated. Was there some hidden conflict I wasn’t aware of? Something must have been going on, whether within the company or the family.</p>
<p>She had been getting monthly check-ups, and recently, her condition had rapidly worsened. If so, the body I now inhabited should still be ill. But it was cured. What did this mean?</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>My head throbbed. This situation defied medical and scientific explanation. It seemed like something straight out of a novel.</p>
<p>In the elevator, I leaned my head against the wall, lost in thought. The events of the past few days felt like a dream. Miss Yena’s incurable disease, my life—was there some causal link between the two?</p>
<p>If our souls had switched, there had to be a reason I wasn’t aware of.</p>
<p>When I returned to the hospital room, Housekeeper Ahn stood up to greet me.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling alright?”</p>
<p>I looked at her thoughtfully. She had cared for Miss Yena since she was young. Could she know something?</p>
<p>“Housekeeper Ahn.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Since when have you been looking after me?”</p>
<p>She searched her memory.</p>
<p>“Since you were five years old.”</p>
<p>“Then there must be nothing you don’t know about me, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct. But why do you ask?”</p>
<p>I was curious if she knew about Miss Yena’s illness.</p>
<p>“My parents passed away when I was six, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You even developed aphasia back then. The Honorary Chairman was very worried. Do you still not remember?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>I kept my answers short. Housekeeper Ahn’s face grew somber.</p>
<p>“After your parents died, and you lost your memory and developed aphasia, the atmosphere at home was like walking on thin ice.”</p>
<p>The mention of childhood amnesia made sense now. She gently held my hand and spoke softly.</p>
<p>“There are some things in this world that don’t need to be remembered. Sometimes, it’s better to live on without those memories.”</p>
<p>I gave up trying to find out if she knew about the illness. Pushing further might raise her suspicions.</p>
<p>My chest felt tight. I had always envied Miss Yena. She was the cherished daughter of a Chaebol family. Intelligent, beautiful, and confident, I envied everything about her, especially when I compared my life to hers.</p>
<p>But to think that someone like her was suffering… Childhood amnesia, aphasia, and ALS…</p>
<p>These were things I would never have known if I hadn’t become her. Maybe not everything is as it seems. Could there be a divine purpose in switching our souls?</p>
<p>I looked at Housekeeper Ahn. Could I trust her? In Miss Yena’s phone, she was listed as ‘God.’ How much did she know about things I was unaware of?</p>
<p>It was another restless night.</p>
