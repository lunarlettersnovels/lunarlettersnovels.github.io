            <p><strong>Chapter 7.1</strong></p>
<p>“Miss Yena. Miss Yena?”</p>
<p>Miss Yena? But I’m not her… I opened my eyes to see Housekeeper Ahn’s face.</p>
<p>“Housekeeper Ahn…”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me. You have a visitor.”</p>
<p>I felt momentarily dazed. Who am I? Lee Buyeon? Namgung Yena? Seeing my confusion, Housekeeper Ahn called out again.</p>
<p>“Miss Yena? Are you alright?”</p>
<p>Only then did I relax. Every time I opened my eyes, I feared things would revert back to how they were.</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>She spoke to me as I got up.</p>
<p>“There’s a visitor outside.”</p>
<p>“A visitor? What time is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s 7 a.m.”</p>
<p>I frowned. When I lived as Lee Buyeon, I always woke up at 3 a.m., but now that I’m Namgung Yena, I’ve been sleeping more.</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>Who visits someone at this hour? How inconsiderate.</p>
<p>“It’s President Jang Doha.”</p>
<p>My eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“President Jang Doha.”</p>
<p>Why is he here at this time? He visited just yesterday.</p>
<p>“Did he say why he’s here?”</p>
<p>“He said he was worried about you.”</p>
<p>Clearly, there must be something between them.</p>
<p>“Could you ask him to wait a moment?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I went to the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth. It was inconvenient with one hand, but I needed to get used to it. As I dried my face, I thought about how I needed a proper shower with Housekeeper Ahn’s help later. After tidying my hair, I signaled Housekeeper Ahn to leave the room. Then, CEO Jang Doha came inside.</p>
<p>Today, he wore a gray suit, bringing a subtle fragrance with him. He entered with one hand behind his back.</p>
<p>“Hello, President.”</p>
<p>He smiled refreshingly.</p>
<p>“How are you feeling today?”</p>
<p>“I’m alright.”</p>
<p>“This is for you…”</p>
<p>He revealed the hand he’d hidden behind his back, holding a single rose. I then knew for sure—CEO Jang Doha liked Miss Yena. The question was whether she liked him back. That shy smile of his was charming. It didn’t come off as cheesy at all.</p>
<p>If I were Miss Yena, I’d be thrilled. But I’m a 35-year-old woman who’s been through it all. This didn’t excite me.</p>
<p>I accepted the rose. It was the first time I’d received a flower. My husband never gave me flowers, not even while we were dating.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t sure if flowers were allowed in the hospital. Is it okay?”</p>
<p>“One flower should be fine.”</p>
<p>“I hope so.”</p>
<p>I spoke kindly.</p>
<p>“I’ll check with the nurse. Thank you.”</p>
<p>He looked visibly pleased by my response. How could someone be so pure at 32 and be a company CEO? He was bound to be taken advantage of. Maybe the Honorary Chairman made a mistake. This man couldn’t stand up to my husband.</p>
<p>I studied him. Miss Yena had ALS. Could she have truly accepted this man?</p>
<p>Probably not. If there were deep feelings between them, there wouldn’t have been such awkwardness and shyness yesterday. It seemed to me that Jang Doha’s feelings for Miss Yena were one-sded.</p>
<p>“And this… I got it from the duty-free shop.”</p>
<p>He handed me a small, wrapped box from his pocket, smiling sheepishly.</p>
<p>“It just looked pretty.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but laugh. Being courted by a younger man at my age was amusing.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>He seemed surprised that I accepted it so easily.</p>
<p>“Why are you surprised?”</p>
<p>“I thought you’d refuse again.”</p>
<p>So he had been pursuing her all along. I was right; Miss Yena had been rejecting him. I thought he would be rigid and dull, but he had an unexpectedly cute side. Should I keep rejecting him as she did? I decided to change the subject.</p>
<p>“I think I can return to work in about a week.”</p>
<p>“So soon? Shouldn’t you rest more?”</p>
<p>“I think work might have piled up. And you said Team Leader Jeong Han-il took over my work, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t. I’ll handle it.”</p>
<p>I needed to understand her work. The information team would fill me in. And if Team Leader Jeong Han-il, whom Miss Yena labeled as ‘fire,’ was in charge, he likely wouldn’t put any effort to make the project a success.</p>
<p>“But your health…”</p>
<p>“It’s just my arm that’s inconvenient.”</p>
<p>Did my words sound curt? He looked a bit taken aback and sullen.</p>
<p>“The doctor said I should resume daily activities to recover faster.”</p>
<p>“Then should I drive you to work?”</p>
<p>This man was straightforward. I’d never dealt with someone so direct before.</p>
