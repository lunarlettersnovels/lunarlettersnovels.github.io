            <p><strong>Chapter 3.2</strong></p>
<p>I could only etch their sorrow into my heart. Meanwhile, the conversation between my husband and mother-in-law kept echoing in my mind like a hellish reminder.</p>
<p>Fury flared up inside me. I wouldn’t let this go.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>“Let’s go upstairs now.”</p>
<p>As we headed to the hospital room, I felt the stares of people lined up in the hallway. Among them, I saw some familiar faces. Despite the sudden bad news, most people were indifferent.</p>
<p>Only my parents, grandfather, and the three people from my information team genuinely mourned my death today. I felt I had died a meaningless death. I won’t forget this.</p>
<p>In the elevator, Housekeeper Ahn spoke cautiously.</p>
<p>“Um… Miss. When people from the main house arrive later, could I go down briefly to pay my respects?”</p>
<p>“Are you going to pay your respects too?”</p>
<p>“Of course… None of us are indifferent to madam’s death… She wasn’t someone who should’ve gone like this… She was too kind… why did this happen…”</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn’s voice, choking with tears, was sincere. Knowing that there were people who mourned my death somewhere made my chest constrict.</p>
<p>“There was a driver who worked for my sister-in-law, right?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Sung. Fortunately, he survived, but… his spine was fractured…”</p>
<p>I closed my eyes. It was a relief that Mr. Sung was at least alive.</p>
<p>“What happened to my phone?”</p>
<p>“Chief Jeon took it.”</p>
<p>Chief Jeon was Grandfather’s Chief Secretary and also part of Yena’s dedicated team.</p>
<p>“You know how to contact him, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Please call him and ask him to come to the hospital.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>“When Chief Jeon arrives, you can also go pay your respects.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, miss.”</p>
<p>When the elevator doors opened, I headed to the hospital room. I didn’t need to look in the mirror to know my face was tense. I was livid.</p>
<p>Time passed, and Mr. Jeon arrived. He was an older man with graying hair. He bowed and greeted me, his face gaunt.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you regained consciousness, miss.”</p>
<p>I told Housekeeper Ahn. “You may go now.”</p>
<p>After she left, I asked Mr. Jeon.</p>
<p>“What was the cause of the accident?”</p>
<p>“The other driver was drunk. He’s currently in custody.”</p>
<p>“Drunk?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I scrutinized Chief Jeon’s expression. Could I trust him? Did he suspect that I was someone else? Everything felt precarious. Did the young lady address him formally or informally? I dredged up every memory I had.</p>
<p>“The phone?”</p>
<p>“Here it is.”</p>
<p>He handed over a new phone and laptop. He explained while I examined them.</p>
<p>“They were so damaged that we could only recover some phone numbers and photos and a few emails from the laptop.”</p>
<p>“What about the bag?”</p>
<p>“Here it is.”</p>
<p>The large bag that Miss Yena usually carried was scratched and torn, bearing traces of that day. I put it under the table and asked again.</p>
<p>“What about my sister-in-law’s phone?”</p>
<p>There were important pictures on it. Evidence of my husband’s violence. Mr. Jeon looked troubled and said.</p>
<p>“That… it was given to the director as a keepsake.”</p>
<p>I felt conflicted but somewhat relieved. With fingerprint recognition on the phone and me being dead, no one could unlock it. If they couldn’t unlock it, my husband would likely dispose of the phone.</p>
<p>I received Miss Yena’s phone, dazed. Whether it was because it wasn’t password-protected or because Mr. Jeon’s team had exceptional hacking skills, the screen unlocked and functioned normally.</p>
<p>Now, I had to use this small device to uncover everything about Miss Yena’s actions and life. My knowledge about her was limited; I didn’t know about her friends or work-related matters at all.</p>
<p>But I needed to become Namgung Yena now… not Lee Buyeon. I made up my mind after hearing the inhumane conversations in the family room.</p>
<p>I would become Namgung Yena and destroy them.</p>
<p>“How much can I trust you, Mr. Jeon?”</p>
<p>When I looked up and stared at him, Chief Jeon’s face stiffened. He was highly loyal to my great uncle, which is why Grandfather had assigned him to Yena. Still, I needed to be cautious.</p>
<p>“I will continue investigating. Even though 20 years have passed, the investigation will not stop.”</p>
<p>Twenty years? Investigation? What was he talking about?</p>
<p>“The Honorary Chairman also instructed us not to stop investigating.”</p>
<p>This seemed like something important that I didn’t know about.</p>
<p>“We believe we have located the driver who caused the accident 20 years ago. We are currently tracking him.”</p>
<p>This was becoming more confusing, but I couldn’t show it.</p>
<p>“Inform me immediately when you find him.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And there must be information you’ve gathered about those around me. Give it to me.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>This was purely my guess. There must be a team managing the family, and they would also monitor Miss Yena’s surroundings.</p>
<p>“I need to know who my allies and enemies are. I need to handle this clearly.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, my voice didn’t waver. It was low and confident. I would change. Mr. Jeon, who had been watching me for a moment, asked,</p>
<p>“Are you referring to all the individuals?”</p>
<p>“Yes, including work relationships and occasional friends.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>“And there was a driver who worked for my sister-in-law.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I heard his spine was fractured. Please cover his medical expenses and support his family’s living costs. Don’t forget the compensation. Do it discreetly.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>This was the first order I gave with Miss Yena’s face. I was given a second chance at life with this… but Miss Yena—I’m so sorry, Miss Yena!</p>
<p>I’ll do my d.amned best for both of us.</p>
