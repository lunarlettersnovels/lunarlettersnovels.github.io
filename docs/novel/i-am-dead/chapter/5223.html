            <p><strong>Chapter 7.2</strong></p>
<p>“Is that a problem?” Jang Doha suddenly asked when I didn’t reply. He looked a bit embarrassed after suggesting it.</p>
<p>“Can you do that?” I asked.</p>
<p>His eyes widened in surprise before he smiled brightly. “Sure, I can do that.”</p>
<p>Jang Doha’s smile reminded me of a golden retriever. It was an unexpected discovery that he had this side to him.</p>
<p>“You haven’t had breakfast yet, have you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No, it’s still early,” I replied.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is. Haha. So, are you allowed to go out?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Is it difficult to go out?”</p>
<p>“Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“Actually, I was wondering if you’d like to have breakfast together. There’s a hotel nearby that’s famous for its breakfast.”</p>
<p>“Ilton Hotel?”</p>
<p>“Do you know it?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Da.mn it. The current MK Chairman, my father-in-law, sometimes had breakfast there. He claimed it was for business, but I knew better. He used that hotel when spending the night with his mistress.</p>
<p>“You want to go there?”</p>
<p>Seeing my arm and neck in casts, he looked disheartened.</p>
<p>“Guess that’s not possible.”</p>
<p>It was surprising that his disappointed expression didn’t annoy me. I agreed readily.</p>
<p>“How about we go after I get discharged?”</p>
<p>At my words, his eyes crinkled as he broke into a smile. His cheerfulness was infectious.</p>
<p>After he left, I was fully awake and remembered a promise I made yesterday. The information team was scheduled to visit at 9. Before they arrived, I needed to send Housekeeper Ahn home.</p>
<p>“Housekeeper Ahn.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Yena?”</p>
<p>“I can’t stomach the hospital food.”</p>
<p>“Shall I bring you a packed meal?”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t that be too much trouble?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine. Do you have something in mind?”</p>
<p>“I’d like abalone porridge, skewered meat, and roast deodeok.”</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn’s eyes reddened at my request.</p>
<p>“Why are you crying?”</p>
<p>“Those were Madam’s favorite dishes…”</p>
<p>A heavy weight settled in my chest. I had unconsciously asked for the food I used to like. I felt grateful for Housekeeper Ahn’s memory of me. It was a strange feeling to be mourned by someone while still alive.</p>
<p>“I’m being foolish. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, Housekeeper Ahn.”</p>
<p>I spoke to her, my eyes meeting hers, which were red with tears.</p>
<p>“Thank you, for not forgetting my sister.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying… Of course, I remember her. Madam treated us so well.”</p>
<p>I felt a lump in my throat. Ten years had passed, and though it seemed like an eternity, some things remained unchanged.</p>
<p>After Housekeeper Ahn left, hospital breakfast food was brought to my room, but I sent it back. Even in a VIP room, the food was nothing special. For someone with a sensitive palate, it was torture.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the information team arrived. I welcomed them warmly, though they seemed awkward.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>Team Leader Cha greeted me, and I responded kindly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to call you so early.”</p>
<p>“It’s no problem.”</p>
<p>“Please, have a seat.”</p>
<p>Team Leader Cha looked around and asked,</p>
<p>“Where’s Housekeeper Ahn?”</p>
<p>“It would be troublesome if you bumped to her, so I sent her home.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>After they sat down, I got to the point.</p>
<p>“Grandfather told me you’ve been assisting my sister-in-law.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“From now on, you’ll report to me instead of her. The contents of the reports will remain the same.”</p>
<p>Team Leader Cha thought for a moment before asking,</p>
<p>“Do you know what the reports entail?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they cover MK’s stock trends, business movements, and even our family’s private matters.”</p>
<p>Their expressions mirrored each other—surprise and confusion.</p>
<p>“You heard this from the Honorary Chairman?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I addressed them confidently. I needed to leave the timid Lee Buyeon behind.</p>
<p>“The private matters of the family include the current Chairman, the first Madam, and Executive Namgung Muyeol.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand. Please continue.”</p>
<p>I began to deceive them from this point.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I have partial amnesia.”</p>
<p>Their eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>“Grandfather doesn’t know this yet. Dr. Han will likely inform him soon. So, I need your help.”</p>
<p>“How can we assist you?”</p>
<p>I looked at Jo Jungsik and asked,</p>
<p>“Mr. Jo Jungsik, you’re in charge of hacking, correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>I handed him a note I had prepared.</p>
<p>“The people listed here are my colleagues. I’ve forgotten all my work-related matters, but I don’t want them to know.”</p>
<p>“Are you asking us to investigate work-related matters?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I need you to investigate all work-related matters and the people involved. Especially Team Leader Jeong Han-il. I need detailed info on him.”</p>
