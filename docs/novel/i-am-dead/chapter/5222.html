            <p><strong>Chapter 8.1</strong></p>
<p>Team Leader Cha asked calmly, “What exactly do you want us to investigate?”</p>
<p>“I need to know if Executive Namgoong Muyeol, or the current MK chairman are involved. If they are, we need evidence.”</p>
<p>They responded affirmatively.</p>
<p>“Time is of the essence for this task. I need to start working next week.”</p>
<p>Team Leader Cha asked, “When are you being discharged?”</p>
<p>“This Friday.”</p>
<p>“We’ll submit the report before then.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>I paused before continuing, “I plan to create a new email soon. Please contact me through that.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>After the three people left, I was engulfed in an indescribable feeling. I felt excited and filled with confidence about a new life. I think I could do it.</p>
<p>I’ll make Namgoong Yena the head of the family.</p>
<p>My heart felt a warmth it hadn’t in a long time.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn arrived just before noon. She came with a lunch box wrapped in cloth, and worried about me for awhile.</p>
<p>“You must be hungry. I’m sorry for the delay, the traffic was heavy.”</p>
<p>“I should be the one apologizing.”</p>
<p>She seemed surprised by my response. It made sense, as Yena would never apologize regardless of the situation. I worried momentarily if I had made a mistake, but it was just a needless concern.</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn’s looked touched. She unwrapped the lunch box. The warm abalone porridge smelled savory, the skewered meat was perfectly cooked, and the roasted deodeok made my mouth water.</p>
<p>“Please eat. You must be hungry.”</p>
<p>I tried the porridge. Though slightly different from what I usually made, it was delicious since I hadn’t eaten properly in a while. The spicy, roasted deodeok particularly brought tears to my eyes.</p>
<p>If I were dead, I wouldn’t be able to enjoy such things now.</p>
<p>Yena always ate little, but I made sure to chew and finish all the food. Houskeeper Ahn looked both surprised and pleased.</p>
<p>“Miss, your appetite has improved. That’s a relief.”</p>
<p>“I guess I was hungrier than I thought.”</p>
<p>“No wonder, with everything that’s been happening. If there’s anything you want for dinner, let me know, and I’ll bring it.”</p>
<p>“Who will be having dinner at home tonight?”</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn blinked. I spoke casually.</p>
<p>“I was going to request the same dinner menu. It would be easier if it’s the same.”</p>
<p>“These days, the Honorary Chairman hardly eats. Everyone said they’ll be having dinner outside tonight.”</p>
<p>“Grandfather isn’t eating?”</p>
<p>“No. Director Han visits him every day.”</p>
<p>A sigh escaped me. It was because of me.</p>
<p>Still, I was grateful that Grandfather remembered me and felt distressed. But he’s old—he shouldn’t be skipping meals. I spoke cautiously.</p>
<p>“He likes black sesame porridge…”</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn was surprised.</p>
<p>“That’s right. He does like that. Thank you, Miss.”</p>
<p>She then made a sad expression.</p>
<p>“Still, it’s a relief you remembered. Normally, Madam would take care of these things…”</p>
<p>When I am suddenly mentioned like this, my heart feels heavy. I’m suddenly reminded of my parents. If Grandfather is this way, it must be even harder for them, to send their child first.</p>
<p>“Housekeeper Ahn.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss?”</p>
<p>“Could you make a couple of extra bowls of porridge when you prepare Grandfather’s?”</p>
<p>“Are you craving porridge?”</p>
<p>“No, I think my sister-in-law’s parents might also not be eating.”</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn couldn’t hold back her tears at my words.</p>
<p>“I wish I could help them, but I’m bound here… Madam will appreciate it too. I’ll make it and bring it to you.”</p>
<p>“No, bring it to the hospital. I’ll take it myself.”</p>
<p>“You, Miss, will go yourself?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m worried about how they’ve been since the funeral.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll bring your clothes too.”</p>
<p>“Please. Something modest.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss… Thank you.”</p>
<p>I received thanks for taking care of my parents. I smiled faintly.</p>
<p>After eating the porridge, I showered with Housekeeper Ahn’s help. The warm water on my skin for the first time in several days made me feel as if I was floating in cloud 9. I even dared to remove the neck brace.</p>
<p>When afternoon came, Housekeeper Ahn went home, and soon after, Chief Jeon arrived.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Chief Jeon. Please have a seat.”</p>
<p>He noticed my neck brace was gone and asked, “Are you feeling better?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m getting around fine now. Did you bring it?”</p>
<p>“Here it is.”</p>
<p>He handed me a tablet. It was organized into categories of company, friends, and close friends—and thankfully, photos were attached as well. But Chief Jeon’s gaze was that of confusion.</p>
