        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 1.2</strong></p>
<p>I looked at my husband sitting across from me. Namgung Muyeol, 38 years old. He holds the title of executive director at the main office and has a sophisticated appearance and manners, but he is undoubtedly a piece of trash.</p>
<p>When I made eye contact with Miss Yena, I conveyed my gratitude and asked her to stop. She understood and thus ended another uncomfortable breakfast.</p>
<p>I finally had some free time once everyone left for work, and my mother-in-law went out. I told the housekeeper I would be resting and went up to my room. After locking the door, I entered the dressing room and pulled on the third hanger in my wardrobe.</p>
<p>A door opened slightly, and I entered a room filled with various jewels on display. Standing before a cabinet, I pressed a hidden button, revealing a safe.</p>
<p>This safe, known only to me, contained not money but documents. I took a few files from the top and sat down at my vanity to review them.</p>
<p>Each file contained information on MK’s business trends, share movements, and the secret lives of the family members.</p>
<p>It included the young men my mother-in-law was seeing, my father-in-law’s mistress, and my husband’s mistress. It also detailed the petty corruptions of each family member. While not immediately useful, this information would be crucial evidence and blackmail material for my divorce later.</p>
<p>The most important file now was this one. When I opened the yellow file, I saw details on MK’s recent stock movements. Grandfather had made some secret transfers recently, but it wasn’t clear to whom.</p>
<p>Though the amounts were small, these transfers could become significant variables in future share disputes. I knew the entire family was keeping a close eye on these shares since I wasn’t the only one receiving updates on stock movements.</p>
<p>I turned my attention to MK’s business trends, especially those related to the Overseas Business Division.</p>
<p>I understood why my sister-in-law wanted to bring me into the company. Having completed my MBA and inherited my mother’s culinary skills, I was the talented person she desperately needed.</p>
<p>Recently, Grandfather made an unconventional move by scouting Jang Doha as the CEO of the main office. I had met Jang Doha once when he visited our home, so I knew his face.</p>
<p>From my research, Jang Doha was a founding member of the American venture company Meat and had an impressive track record. His skills were already proven, and his network in the U.S. was significant, with rumors even suggesting connections to the White House.</p>
<p>When Jang Doha was hired, my father-in-law was furious and even raised his voice.</p>
<p>It was understandable. As the eldest son, my husband was supposed to take the CEO position, but Jang Doha stole it away from him just by being so talented.</p>
<p>I had laughed at the time. Jang Doha wasn’t the problem; the biggest obstacle would be me. My husband would never become the head of the family because I would prevent it.</p>
<p>No one knows that I possess all this information—no one except Grandfather.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Grandfather entrusted this task to me. I handle a significant amount of information. I even have my own intelligence team dedicated to this purpose. Any unusual occurrences are reported directly to Grandfather.</p>
<p>In the household, I am the one person uninvolved in any power struggles. I handle and report information objectively. Grandfather specifically chose me for this role.</p>
<p>Outwardly, I may appear to be the eldest daughter-in-law confined to the kitchen, but this is my real role. If I do this well, Grandfather promised to set me free.</p>
<p>Just then, my phone alarm went off. I put the files back into the safe and left the room.</p>
<p>I live on the second floor of the east wing, and Grandfather and Yena live on the first floor. My in-laws live in the west wing, while the second and third sons live in the annex.</p>
<p>I stopped by the kitchen to prepare a tea set for Grandfather, who enjoys a tea ceremony twice a day.</p>
<p>But this is just a pretext to avoid the prying eyes of the family; the real purpose is for me to report to him.</p>
<p>Grandfather trusts no one else but Yena and me. I know that Grandfather sees Yena, not my father-in-law, as the next head of MK. He hasn’t said this directly, but I can tell.</p>
<p>I stood in front of Grandfather’s room, holding the tea set. After a small knock, I entered. Grandfather was in the tea room decorated in a traditional Korean style. Kneeling before him, I brewed a cup of tea and handed it to him.</p>
<p>“Have some, too,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I brewed a cup for myself and took a sip. As I put down my cup, Grandfather spoke.</p>
<p>“There have been recent changes in my shareholdings. You’re aware of this, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Those shares are for you.”</p>
<p>Startled, I couldn’t help but look up at him. Grandfather’s expression was indifferent, but his voice was gentle.</p>
<p>“They are your shares. It’s been ten years since you joined our family. I think it’s time to fulfill my promise to you.”</p>
<p>I swallowed nervously and looked at him with a tense expression.</p>
<p>“You’ve endured a lot living with your husband.”</p>
<p>Only then did I realize that Grandfather was aware of my husband’s constant infidelity and his current mistress. My hands trembled. Did he also know I was gathering evidence?</p>
<p>“You knew?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Starting next month, you’ll be working at Yena’s company.”</p>
<p>My heart pounded. I couldn’t believe it. As I stood there speechless, Grandfather continued kindly.</p>
<p>“I heard your father is running for mayor of Seoul. You know this, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I will transfer the shares to your name at the right time. You can help with your father’s campaign. You’ve done well all this time. Now, show your abilities freely.”</p>
<p>“Grandfather….”</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed with emotion. Grandfather knew all along how I had suffered under unfair treatment. My eyes welled up, and I lowered my head. His gentle voice continued.</p>
<p>“You can divorce your husband when you think the time is right. You deserve better.”</p>
<p>I was shocked. In this family, divorce was unthinkable. Separation by death, yes, but never divorce. The rule was that all shares would be reclaimed immediately upon divorce, a rule set by Grandfather himself.</p>
<p>Yet, he was giving me permission to divorce? I trembled. He knew. He knew how my husband treated me. I felt a mix of gratitude and shame.</p>
<p>As I left Grandfather’s room and walked down the corridor, I stopped in front of a mirror.</p>
<p>The woman who looked back at me was brimming with hope.</p>
<p>The day I could finally part ways with this family was not far off, and that alone made me incredibly happy.</p>
