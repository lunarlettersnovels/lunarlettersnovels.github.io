            <p><strong>Chapter 9.2</strong></p>
<p>At my words, my mother covered her face with her hands and sobbed. Though my heart ached, I couldn’t just cry along with her. In a somewhat strong tone, I said,</p>
<p>“You need to eat. If my sister knew you were like this, she’d be distressed.”</p>
<p>“How can a young person have such a heart…”</p>
<p>“You’re living not for yourself but for my sister Buyeon’s sake, too. I’ll visit more often from now on.”</p>
<p>My father, with reddened eyes, nodded and comforted my mother.</p>
<p>“Let’s eat. For the sake of our in-law’s heartfelt gesture, let’s eat, dear.”</p>
<p>I poured water for both of them and placed it in front of them, sitting down to watch them eat. Every time my mother tried to put down her spoon after a few bites, my father stopped her, and I gave her a rather stern look. Noticing my expression, my mother finally finished the porridge. Smiling, I said,</p>
<p>“I’ll call every day to make sure you’re eating properly. And I’ll visit too. If you skip meals, expect another lunchbox. Okay?”</p>
<p>Looking at me with sad eyes, my mother nodded.</p>
<p>“When you’re done, could you go to the living room?”</p>
<p>“Why…?”</p>
<p>“I’d like to make some tea.”</p>
<p>I spoke more lightly, feeling relieved to see them eating. Though I couldn’t do the dishes, I boiled water, opened the tea caddy, and prepared the tea. It all came so naturally.</p>
<p>Being in my parents’ kitchen felt just like the life I had before I got married, which made me feel a bit more at ease. When I carried the tray out awkwardly, my father rushed over to take it from me.</p>
<p>“How could you…”</p>
<p>“I found it while looking around. My sister said you liked tea, don’t you?”</p>
<p>I kept my tone light to ease their burden. To save the two of them, I needed to steel myself. If I acted sad or heavy-hearted, they would feel the same. Kneeling to brew the tea, their eyes welled with tears again. My mother reached out.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it…”</p>
<p>I watched her brew the tea, seeing so much of myself in her. Gathering my courage, I got to the point.</p>
<p>“My sister made a request right after she married. I’ve come to fulfill it.”</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>“She entrusted me with her wedding funds to invest. Turns out, I’m quite good at it.”</p>
<p>I unzipped the two bags that Chief Jeon had left. It was my first time seeing them too, but they overflowed with 50,000 won bills. Concealing my surprise, I calmly continued,</p>
<p>“This is the result. It’s 1 billion won.”</p>
<p>Their eyes and mouths widened.</p>
<p>“1… 1 billion won?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I managed to grow it substantially. This belongs rightfully to my sister and now to you.”</p>
<p>My father, deep in thought, spoke.</p>
<p>“Does her husband know about this?”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t. Even if he did, my sister wouldn’t have wanted it to go to him.”</p>
<p>“We did talk about stocks before…”</p>
<p>“That’s something my grandfather needs to handle, not me.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay, you don’t need to do that.”</p>
<p>“No, please take it. Grandfather will return it to you. You should run for mayor and win. I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>My father sighed and then spoke.</p>
<p>“Miss Yena, I still don’t quite understand why you’re doing all this.”</p>
<p>“… My sister and I were close. She confided in me, and I observed her married life closely. Uncle, you absolutely must win the election. My sister was very happy about it. Grandfather asked her to help with the campaign. She was even supposed to start working at the company next month. So, think of this as her last request and get up. Staying secluded like this is not what she would have wanted.”</p>
<p>I tried to convey my sincerity, and it worked. It moved my father to tears, and his resolve faltered.</p>
<p>“I will… For Buyeon’s sake, I will overcome this… Thank you…”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Han, please start working again. I want you to take over what my sister previously did.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean…?”</p>
<p>“I had asked Grandfather for sister because I needed her, but now that she’s gone, I want you to take over her work.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I plan to introduce Korean cuisine internationally. I need you to lead this initiative.”</p>
<p>I spoke confidently. Yes, this is the way. This is the path for everyone to thrive.</p>
<p>“My sister was genuinely happy about this. Please take her place, Mrs. Han.”</p>
<p>I believe my mother will take on this role because it was something her daughter wanted to do.</p>
<p>I left my parents’ house and headed home. Now, I have to meet Grandfather and take care of other tasks. This moment, when no one else is around, is the perfect time.</p>
