            <p><strong>Chapter 10.1</strong></p>
<p>The car glided through the main gate, winding towards the imposing main building. My heart fluttered uneasily as I took in the carpet of fallen leaves under the canopy of ancient trees. I never expected to be here as Namgung Yena, not Lee Buyeon.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the car, I gazed up at the grandeur of the structure, a surge of exhilaration washing over me. When I walked inside, the staff greeted me warmly.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Miss.”</p>
<p>“We’re relieved to see you safe.”</p>
<p>Such words would be unthinkable in any other household, but the informality was normal for how Miss Yena interacted with them.</p>
<p>“I’ve come to see Grandfather. Has he eaten any of the porridge?”</p>
<p>“Well… he’s hardly touched it.” Jeongeun, one of the housekeepers, said.</p>
<p>Impulsively, I decided, “Can I go to the kitchen?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“If he hasn’t had any, we have to make him eat somehow.”</p>
<p>As I strode towards the kitchen, a hushed murmur trailed behind me. Naturally. Miss Yena had never set foot in the kitchen before. In the bustling kitchen, I took off my coat and rolled up my sleeves.</p>
<p>“Could you give me some milk?”</p>
<p>When I opened the refrigerator, the staff nearby looked as though they might faint. With practiced ease, I began preparing the milk porridge, though I did require some assistance due to my left hand being less nimble. The faces of those watching nearby turned pale with shock.</p>
<p>“Oh, Miss! Do you know how to cook?”</p>
<p>“We’re working on a project using Korean Palace Cuisine at the company. I’ve had experience with my sister before.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure how convincing the lie was. Normally, such a task would have been beyond me. The milk porridge was ready. After putting it in a bowl and placing it on a tray, Jeongeun said,</p>
<p>“I’ll take it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Could you also prepare some tea? Green tea would be perfect.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Please bring it to Grandfather’s room.”</p>
<p>I headed towards Grandfather’s room. Knocking gently, I entered. Grandfather sat in the main room, gazing out the window.</p>
<p>“Grandfather.”</p>
<p>Grandfather turned his head and gestured for me to come closer. Jeongeun came in, placed the tray on the table, and quietly departed. I kneeled before him and took his hand, his eyes reddened.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard you’re recovered.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“A miracle has happened… Thank you…”</p>
<p>Grandfather embraced me. Since hearing what he had said, I began thinking. Wasn’t it also a divine will that an incurable disease had been cured? Ther was something the divine definitely wanted to do with Miss Yena’s body. I straightened my spine and in a firm tone, I said,</p>
<p>“You have to eat.”</p>
<p>“I already did.”</p>
<p>“I heard you barely touched your food. Eat this.”</p>
<p>When I removed the handkerchief covering the tray, Grandfather’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“This is….”</p>
<p>“It’s milk porridge. I did my best, though not as well as my sister.”</p>
<p>“You made this? How?”</p>
<p>“I secretly learned from my sister all this time. I thought knowing how to cook would help make the project successful.”</p>
<p>“You and your sister-in-law cooked?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Grandfather didn’t doubt my words. After taking a bite of the milk porridge, he looked surprised.</p>
<p>“It’s just like your sister-in-law’s. Did you really make this?”</p>
<p>“Who else would have?”</p>
<p>I grew more confident, determined to comfort the gloomy Grandfather and get him to eat.</p>
<p>“Finish it all. After you eat, I’ll tell you something.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you after you eat.”</p>
<p>Though it took a while, Grandfather finished the bowl of milk porridge. Soon after, Jeongeun arrived with tea at the perfect moment. I poured the tea as usual. Grandfather, who had been watching me closely, finally spoke.</p>
<p>“Watching you, it feels just like your sister is sitting here.”</p>
<p>I was taken aback for a moment. It seemed like my ingrained habits weren’t hidden after all.</p>
<p>“I’ve learned a lot from her.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Handing him the tea, I got to the point.</p>
<p>“Grandfather, it’s about the shares you intended to give to sister.”</p>
<p>Grandfather narrowed his eyes. “How do you know about that?”</p>
<p>“In this household, there’s no one who doesn’t know. My older Brother knows. Aunt knows. Everyone knows. Sister was beaten by older brother because of it.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Grandfather might have pretended not to know, but there is no one in this family that doesn’t know that older brother beats sister.”</p>
<p>Grandfather was embarrassed. Here I was, using Miss Yena’s voice to criticize the adults.</p>
<p>But my heart couldn’t help but voice out the injustice. Why did you turn the other way and pretend not to know? Why did you act that way?</p>
