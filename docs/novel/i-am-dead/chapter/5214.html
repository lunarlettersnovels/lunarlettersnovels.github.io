            <p><strong>Chapter 12.1</strong></p>
<p>Jang Doha scratched his index finger across his brow, embarrassed.</p>
<p>“I actually, uh, told them it was Yena,” he confessed.</p>
<p>My expression changed. It wasn’t just that he said he had a girlfriend.</p>
<p>“You specifically said it was me?”</p>
<p>“I apologize. I’ve been so caught up with work that I don’t have a girlfriend, so I just blurted it out.”</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“You told them I was your girlfriend?”</p>
<p>He slouched, looking sheepish.</p>
<p>“Yes… I’m sorry. It just slipped out.”</p>
<p>I let out a hollow laugh.  Since becoming a woman of society, I’ve faced all sorts of trials. But his mess was not my problem.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of joining in your shenanigans. Maybe you should find someone else.”</p>
<p>He looked dejected at my refusal. Even though his expression resembled a puppy with drooping eyes, I maintained my composure. I wasn’t one to be swayed by something like this. He nodded and said,</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll tell the truth. I acted impulsively. This is truly my fault. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>His smile wasn’t entirely genuine. It felt a bit resigned and bitter. Perhaps Miss Yena had given him some grounds to say such a thing. But this was a separate issue from how I felt about him. I am utterly fed up with men.</p>
<p>After President Jang left, I picked up my laptop and phone and started studying. Studying was the only way to survive at work and avoid suspicion. As I looked through emails on my laptop, something felt off. No matter how much I looked, nothing in the emails seemed related to the photos taken on my phone.</p>
<p>I opened my phone and entered the gallery, pondering. What the heck is this? It was just a list of numbers with no context. I compared it with the emails, wondering if it was related to work, but couldn’t find any clues. Where were these taken? What are they? I had some suspicions, but nothing concrete.</p>
<p>I emailed the photos to myself and deleted them all. Anyway, Miss Yena lived such a calm, boring life. At the youthful age of her twenties, she didn’t even have any pictures of food, which was common among peers her age. It was surprising.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the hospital room door opened, and Housekeeper Ahn came in.</p>
<p>“I’m back, miss.”</p>
<p>I closed my laptop and smiled.</p>
<p>“Did you have something delicious?”</p>
<p>“I just ate nearby. Did you enjoy your meal, miss?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was okay. How about you, Housekeeper Ahn?”</p>
<p>She immediately made a face of disgust.</p>
<p>“I didn’t like it. They used so much seasoning. Home-cooked meals are the best.”</p>
<p>“Meals cooked by someone else are the best, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>She looked surprised at my joke, then laughed.</p>
<p>“You’re right. Meals cooked by others are the most delicious. When did you learn to joke like that, miss?”</p>
<p>“You used to mutter about it. Wishing you could eat food cooked by others.”</p>
<p>“Did I say that?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Don’t you remember?”</p>
<p>“I must be getting old. Everything feels new these days.”</p>
<p>Chatting with Housekeeper Ahn turned out to be enjoyable. Her unexpected sense of humor and natural ability to put people at ease made the conversation thoroughly enjoyable. Perhaps it was these qualities that enabled the old housekeeper to maintain a somewhat cheerful personality despite the turbulence in our family.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The next day, a report arrived in the new email account I had set up. It was from Team Leader Cha. I couldn’t help but be impressed by their skills. Despite the company’s security, the report detailed projects Miss Yena had worked on or was currently working on, along with each employee’s status and, thankfully, information about my husband as well.</p>
<p>I saved the reports I needed to review and read through my husband’s report. He had been practically demoted since Jang Doha joined the company. It was a punishment from grandfather for the projects he had messed up.</p>
<p>As I skimmed through the report, there was nothing particularly impressive. I couldn’t help but laugh. With such incompetence, it didn’t make sense for him to act big and mighty because he was the eldest grandson of MK.</p>
<p>“You’re finished, Namgung Muyeol.”</p>
<p>I muttered a warning he couldn’t hear. I was now ready to fight him.</p>
