            <p><strong>Chapter 14.1</strong></p>
<p>At my mother-in-law’s words, Grandfather put down his chopsticks and asked,</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Earlier, I tried to show Yena a potential match. He’s the second son of the Prosecutor General. Very promising. It’s a match that was hard to arrange, but Yena, well, she lied.”</p>
<p>I calmly put down my chopsticks, took a sip of water, and looked at my mother-in-law with a smile.</p>
<p>“How do you know it’s a lie?”</p>
<p>“Do I not know you? You’re not seeing anyone.”</p>
<p>“So how can you be so sure?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” she scoffed. “I had someone follow…!”</p>
<p>My mother-in-law’s face turned pale as she realized her slip of the tongue. Grandfather looked at everyone with a frightening gaze and said,</p>
<p>“If you had someone follow Yena, make sure they withdraw immediately. Anyone who disregards my warning will not only lose their shares but also their management rights.”</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent. My mother-in-law and my husband lowered their heads and avoided eye contact. But my father-in-law… looked strange. His expression subtly hardened, but he pretended otherwise.</p>
<p>Had he also had someone follow Miss Yena? It was understandable for my mother-in-law, but my father-in-law too? Was it because of the shares? A chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p>The tense dinner ended after awhile. After finishing the meal, I escorted Grandfather to the main building.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>Following Grandfather’s words, I entered the room with him. As I sat on the sofa, Grandfather asked,</p>
<p>“Do you really have someone?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Is it a lie?”</p>
<p>“No. There really is someone. But it’s at a stage where it’s hard to talk about it yet.”</p>
<p>Grandfather squinted his eyes and spoke.</p>
<p>“Is it Jang Do-ha?”</p>
<p>I was truly shocked. Was he guessing? Or had Miss Yena told him something? It was hard to gauge. Grandfather, looking at me, chuckled.</p>
<p>“Now that you’ve recovered, there’s no reason not to meet. You said you liked him. Go ahead and push forward.”</p>
<p>I felt sweat trickling down my back. It seemed Miss Yena could talk about anything with Grandfather. I blinked. Miss Yena really had her eyes on President Jang.</p>
<p>What should I do now? My mouth felt dry.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Back in my room, I was in a daze. I have no interest in men. That man, Namgung Muyeol, was more than enough for me in this lifetime.</p>
<p>At this rate, wouldn’t I end up having dinner with President Jang’s parents as he mentioned? It was a serious problem. Then I recalled my father-in-law’s expression at the dinner table.</p>
<p>I’m quick-witted. In the ten years I’ve lived in this house, I’ve learned to read the room and hide my emotions. My father-in-law’s expression bothered me. Although no one else could notice, I could.</p>
<p>Why did he have someone follow Miss Yena? He used to be more lenient towards her compared to my mother-in-law and husband. Come to think of it, he didn’t even visit me once during my funeral.</p>
<p>“There’s something….”</p>
<p>This unsettling feeling was definitely not just a hunch. At that moment, I heard a knock.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Miss. The Chairman is looking for you.”</p>
<p>When I opened the door, there stood the Housekeeper Ahn.</p>
<p>“Uncle?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He sent a message for you to come to the study on the second floor.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>I picked up my phone and headed to the study on the second floor. After knocking and entering, I found my father-in-law, now uncle, at his desk.</p>
<p>“You called for me?”</p>
<p>He gestured for me to sit. Once I was seated on the sofa, he sat in a single armchair and spoke.</p>
<p>“Who is he?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The person you’re seeing. If he’s just an ordinary guy, meet the prosecutor I arranged for you. It’s time for you to fulfill your obligations as a member of this family.”</p>
<p>I looked at my father-in-law. He was different from my impulsive and emotional mother-in-law. He currently commands MK and is someone known for his meticulous planning and emotional restraint. He never treated me harshly but was always harder to deal with than my mother-in-law.</p>
<p>“Are you saying I should marry out of duty to the family?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Fortunately, he thinks well of you. His father is currently the Prosecutor General but will soon be appointed as the Minister of Justice. It wouldn’t hurt to have a Minister of Justice in the family.”</p>
<p>I understood his intentions. But I had no intention of complying. Direct confrontation wouldn’t work with him. I needed a different approach than the one I used with my mother-in-law.</p>
<p>“The truth is, I am seeing someone.”</p>
<p>“If he’s just some ordinary guy, it’s not worth considering.”</p>
<p>I smiled and spoke softly.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know I needed Uncle’s permission to get married.”</p>
