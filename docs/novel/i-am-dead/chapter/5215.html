            <p><strong>Chapter 11.2</strong></p>
<p>“I’ll treat you to this again next time. Since you seem to enjoy it,” Jang Doha said.</p>
<p>I gave a faint smile. As I ate dessert, I felt his gaze lingering on me.</p>
<p>“Why do you keep staring at me?”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. But Miss Yena, you seem a bit different.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I felt it yesterday, too. Something about you has changed.”</p>
<p>My stomach churned for a moment.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well… You used to smile a lot before. I know it’s not easy after the accident, but your demeanor… How should I say it? You seem more mature, composed, and serene. Even your voice has a different tone now.”</p>
<p>I realized my slip-up. I hadn’t paid attention to my natural way of speaking. Continuing to impersonate Miss Yena would be challenging, especially under his watchful scrutiny. If this continued, he might suspect that I’m not the real Namgung Yena. When my expression turned stiff, he became apologetic.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if I overstepped,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I understand why you might feel that way. No need to apologize.”</p>
<p>Still, he kept watching me, clearly expecting an explanation. I could have easily avoided giving him an explanation, but his gaze was too earnest to brush off. It was better to clarify things now.</p>
<p>“I lost my sister-in-law in the accident, you know?” I began.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I can’t laugh and chat as I used to. I have to live for her, too. For her family. I have to change, and I must.”</p>
<p>He sincerely apologized again. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have been nosy. I’m truly sorry.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. By the way, your Korean is quite good,” I said casually.</p>
<p>He looked surprised at my comment. I was startled; perhaps this was something he had already discussed with Miss Yena. Yet, I met his gaze calmly.</p>
<p>In my line of work, I knew there would be more challenging situations. I couldn’t afford to be flustered every time. I needed to handle things with confidence.</p>
<p>He smiled, though slightly disappointed.</p>
<p>“I mentioned this when we first met. My family emigrated when I started middle school. I was already fluent in Korean, so it wasn’t difficult. But don’t forget it now. It almost hurt my feelings.”</p>
<p>I lifted the corners of my mouth slightly. Thankfully, it seemed to have worked. I have to remain vigilant from now on. When dealing with many people, mistakes like this are bound to happen frequently. As I slowly savored my pudding, he asked,</p>
<p>“What time should I pick you up in the morning?”</p>
<p>“Are you really going to come?” I replied.</p>
<p>“I said I would.”</p>
<p>“Seven o’clock. I’ll inform security.”</p>
<p>“But can you work with that arm?”</p>
<p>“I have to. And it’s not broken, so I’ll just need a cast for about a month.”</p>
<p>“That’s a relief. The car was totaled, but it’s fortunate you only got injured this much. What happened to the perpetrator?”</p>
<p>“They said it was drunk driving. Since my sister-in-law died because of this, he should pay the price.”</p>
<p>“Of all times, why then…”</p>
<p>“It must be a twist of fate.”</p>
<p>Indeed, fate had played a cruel trick—taking the young lady’s life and sparing mine. Then, he cautiously broached another topic.</p>
<p>“My parents are coming to Korea soon.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t particularly interested in his parents’ visit, but I feigned interest. He hesitated, his expression awkward.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s just… Yena.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“When my parents come… would you join us for a meal?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>I was really surprised. What was he talking about? He looked flustered, his face turning red.</p>
<p>“My parents have many friends in Korea. The truth is, they’re coming to introduce my fiancée.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but look puzzled. What did that have to do with me? Seeing my expression, he seemed very embarrassed but spoke firmly.</p>
<p>“The truth is, I told them I have a girlfriend.”</p>
<p>My face hardened. Is this guy an idiot? How could he tell such an obvious lie?</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I blurted it out when they insisted I meet someone. Once my parents set their minds on something, they don’t let go… Please, just this once, help me out. I’m begging you.”</p>
<p>“That’s difficult, President…”</p>
<p>At my gentle refusal, he looked dismayed. Oh, please, a grown man shouldn’t make that face. He looks like a puppy begging after doing something wrong.</p>
<p>“Is it really difficult?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If you truly don’t want to marry, wouldn’t it be better to be honest with your parents and try to persuade them? Avoiding a moment of trouble by deceiving them isn’t the right approach.”</p>
<p>I didn’t scold him. Instead, I offered practical advice. He stared at me intently and asked, “Aren’t you angry?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to get angry.”</p>
<p>I know how to control my temper. And this isn’t something to get angry about.</p>
