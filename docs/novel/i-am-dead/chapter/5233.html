            <p><strong>Chapter 2.2</strong></p>
<p>“Hospital… don’t you need to go to the hospital?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>There was no hospital that would willingly write me a medical report. Just as my husband had said, no law firm would even take on my divorce case.</p>
<p>I had already tried in the early days of my marriage. The result was a brutal beating.</p>
<p>“Dinner…”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it. How could you in this state?”</p>
<p>“Please give me my clothes. I’ll go downstairs.”</p>
<p>Then a thought crossed my mind.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Ahn, can you give me my phone?”</p>
<p>I turned on the camera on the phone Mrs. Ahn brought and said, “Please take some pictures.”</p>
<p>“Ma’am…”</p>
<p>“It won’t cause you any trouble. I just want to survive.”</p>
<p>Holding the phone, Mrs. Ahn said resolutely,</p>
<p>“If you need a witness, I’ll testify. I’m ready to retire anyway.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Ahn…”</p>
<p>“Show me your back. No, I’ll start with your face. The bruising is severe.”</p>
<p>Following her directions, I posed for the photos, my heart in tatters. All I could think about was filing for divorce. I would search the whole country to find a lawyer.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mrs. Ahn’s consideration, I didn’t have to prepare dinner. However, I received a message from my mother-in-law to prepare crab soup for breakfast the next day.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law surely knew what had happened today. She was aware of her son’s nature, and this wasn’t the first time. She deliberately instructed me to buy crabs, knowing I was in pain.</p>
<p>My husband didn’t come home. Rather than feeling empty, I felt more comfortable without him. I stayed up all night, eyes wide open. Instead of sleeping, I gathered evidence for the divorce.</p>
<p>At 3 a.m., I left the room to go to the fish market. As I left the house, Mr. Sung, the chauffeur, greeted me. Mr. Sung is an elderly and cautious man.</p>
<p>“Good morning, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m sorry for the early hour.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. Please get in.”</p>
<p>When I leaned my head against the seat, Mr. Sung looked into the rearview mirror and said,</p>
<p>“Mrs. Ahn gave me some citron tea. Would you like some?”</p>
<p>Thinking of Mrs. Ahn making tea for me, who was starving since dinner, I couldn’t refuse.</p>
<p>“Yes, please.”</p>
<p>I took the tumbler, opened the lid, and the fragrant smell brought me some comfort. As I carefully sipped the tea, the car left the mansion.</p>
<p>After driving for a while, we passed the barricaded main gate when Mr. Sung noticed an approaching car.</p>
<p>“It’s Miss Yena’s car.”</p>
<p>Peering out, I saw it was indeed her car. She had said she was working late, and it seemed she was just coming home now.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>
<p>Miss Yena noticed us, too, and flashed her headlights. The light changed, and our car and Miss Yena’s car slowly crossed the intersection.</p>
<p>And then it happened. Like a scene from a movie, a speeding dump truck crashed into her car in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>“Ack!”</p>
<p>It felt like everything was happening in slow motion. Her car was pushed and collided with ours. All I could do was watch. With no seatbelt fastened around my waist, I was thrown around the back seat violently.</p>
<p>I was terrified of dying. In that split second, I prayed desperately to be saved.</p>
<p>Please, save me! I don’t want to die like this!</p>
<p>Our car flipped, and I found myself lying on the ceiling, which had become the floor. Barely conscious, I saw Mr. Sung hanging upside down, motionless. I tried to move, but my body was motionless. My throat felt strange. I blinked slowly and felt my consciousness slipping away.</p>
<p>Am I going to die? Just like this? Did Miss Yena survive? With those thoughts, I lost consciousness.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>My whole body hurt. Through my barely opened eyes, I saw an unfamiliar ceiling. I tried to turn my head slightly, realizing I had a neck brace on and a cast on my left arm.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seemed I had survived. My first thought was about Miss Yena. What happened to her? And Mr. Sung?</p>
<p>Just then, the door opened, and Mrs. Ahn came in, startled when she saw me awake. She rushed over.</p>
<p>“Miss! Are you awake?”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>I didn’t realize it then, but she called me “Miss” instead of “Ma’am.” Mrs. Ahn pressed the call button, and before I could ask anything, doctors came in.</p>
<p>“Miss Namgung Yena, are you awake?”</p>
<p>I blinked. Namgung… Yena?</p>
<p>“Miss Namgung Yena, you were very lucky. You had a narrow escape.”</p>
<p>Why do they keep calling me Namgung Yena? I’m Lee Buyeon.</p>
<p>The doctors looked at the chart and prodded various parts of my body, pleased that my nerves were responsive. I wanted them to leave quickly so I could talk to Mrs. Ahn.</p>
<p>As soon as the doctors left, I asked,</p>
<p>“Mrs. Ahn, what happened? No, can you give me a mirror first?”</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to expect. But when I looked into the mirror, I was stunned. I had never been so surprised in my life.</p>
<p>The reflection wasn’t mine but that of Namgung Yena.</p>
<p>“How… how is this possible…”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ahn started crying.</p>
<p>“Miss, you were incredibly fortunate to survive… but Ma’am… Ma’am…”</p>
<p>Ma’am? Could it be…</p>
<p>“Are you talking about Lee Buyeon?”</p>
<p>“Yes… Mrs. Lee Buyeon died instantly at the scene… her funeral is happening now.. heuk…”</p>
<p>The mirror fell from my hand.</p>
<p>Am I dead? And now I am Miss Yena? I couldn’t believe it. How could such a thing be possible?</p>
<p>A moment later, I insisted, despite Mrs. Ahn’s protests, and went down to the funeral hall in a wheelchair. People parted like the Red Sea, staring at me as if they had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>I heard whispers of “It’s Namgung Yena,” but I didn’t care. I was in a daze, in my hospital gown with casts on my arm and neck. I couldn’t understand what on earth was happening.</p>
<p>When I reached the mourning hall, I froze. There, in the memorial photo, was me.</p>
<p>It was Lee Buyeon.</p>
