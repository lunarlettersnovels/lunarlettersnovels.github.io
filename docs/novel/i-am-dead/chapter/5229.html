            <p><strong>Chapter 4.2</strong></p>
<p>My mother’s eyes widened, and tears streamed down her face.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know…. I thought she was living well…. She always said she was…. It’s my fault…. How could I not know as her mother….”</p>
<p>I wanted to tell her it wasn’t her fault, that I would punish them, but I held back my words.</p>
<p>Please wait for me, Mom. I’ll take my revenge. Instead—</p>
<p>“I’m sorry….”</p>
<p>There was nothing else I could say. My mother, thinking it was Miss Yena speaking, continued to thank me through her sobs. I turned to my father.</p>
<p>“Father-in-law.”</p>
<p>My father looked at me with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>“Grandfather gifted some of his shares to sister-in-law. It’s not a significant amount, but he said to use them to support your mayoral campaign. I want to transfer those shares to you. Will you allow it?”</p>
<p>My father’s eyes widened, then he shook his head.</p>
<p>“Those are my daughter’s shares. I can’t accept them.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t let that happen. I couldn’t stand the thought of my shares going to that man.</p>
<p>“If you don’t accept them, they will go to my brother.”</p>
<p>My father seemed deep in thought at that. He had likely been furious at my husband’s behavior throughout the funeral. With tears welling in his eyes, he asked me,</p>
<p>“Were you close with our child?”</p>
<p>My throat tightened.</p>
<p>“Yes… We were like real sisters.”</p>
<p>Tears streamed down my father’s face at those words. I wanted to embrace his shaking frame, but I couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Please run for mayor. Sister would have been very happy.”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“Thank you…. I’ll try to pull myself together….”</p>
<p>I was genuinely grateful for his words. Live.</p>
<p>You must survive. Father, Mother.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath, left the funeral home, and headed to the hospital. My mind was blank.</p>
<p>How many people in this world attend their own funeral with someone else’s face? Suddenly, my whole life played out like a movie before my eyes. I used to remember that before marriage, I lived a life of no envy and studied hard.</p>
<p>When I first met my husband, I was deceived by his hypocritical face. He behaved like a well-mannered man, and even though it was an arranged meeting, he was kind and sweet during our courtship.</p>
<p>I only found out the brutal reality after marriage—It was a match arranged by my grandfather, and he had married me only because he was threatened that all his shares would be revoked if he didn’t get married.</p>
<p>I sighed. I regretted not divorcing him immediately after the first act of violence, but it was too late now.</p>
<p>I felt sorry for Miss Yena, but I also didn’t want this… There must be a reason our souls were switched.</p>
<p>But now that it has come to this—I promise to live this life to the fullest. To live it differently. I, as Namgung Yena, would accomplish what Lee Buyeon couldn’t.</p>
<p>It was the only way to make amends to Miss Yena.</p>
<p>I was startled when I entered the hospital room. A man I had never seen before was there. He seemed to be about 190 cm tall, with sculpted, broad shoulders that suited his suit perfectly. He was incredibly handsome.</p>
<p>Who is he? A colleague? A friend? Sweat dripped down my back.</p>
<p>“Yena!”</p>
<p>He approached quickly and hugged me, trembling as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I’m glad. What a relief.”</p>
<p>I was truly shocked. What is this? Miss Yena’s boyfriend?</p>
<p>My heart was pounding loudly from the surprise. I pushed against his chest with my right arm. Realizing what he was doing, he stepped back, his face and even the tips of his ears turning red. He stammered,</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry. I did it unconsciously. I couldn’t come right away because of a contract, and hearing the news made me anxious…. I apologize.”</p>
<p>Then I remembered. He was President Jang Doha. He was Miss Yena’s boss and someone my grandfather trusted.</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>Instead of scolding him, I spoke gently, and he looked at me gratefully and asked,</p>
<p>“Is it that bad?”</p>
<p>He seemed quite startled to see me in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>“No, it’s just that moving is still difficult, so I’m using a wheelchair.”</p>
<p>At my words, he looked relieved. But that wasn’t just the expression of a superior relieved that his subordinate wasn’t seriously hurt. My heart still pounded.</p>
<p>“I’m truly sorry about your sister-in-law’s death. You two must have been very close. It must be hard for you.”</p>
