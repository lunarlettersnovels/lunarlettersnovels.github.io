        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 6.1</strong></p>
<p>After wiping away my tears, I opened the gallery. There were no photos of friends, places, or food—just a collection of incomprehensible images.</p>
<p>As I zoomed in on one, I instinctively glanced towards the door of the hospital room. They looked like documents. Could they be something important and official, worth photographing? Deciding to investigate later, I left the gallery.</p>
<p>From then on, I memorized my phone inside and out, hoping it would minimize my mistakes. Soon, it was Housekeeper Ahn’s turn to be scrutinized. Her entry had a single word: ‘God.’ This detail stood out to me. Housekeeper Ahn had served our family for many years.</p>
<p>I’d heard she started working for us when my great uncle was alive and continued even after Miss Yena was left alone. Maybe that’s why the word ‘God’ felt so poignant.</p>
<p>Given her long tenure, she likely knew all the family secrets. I had always thought of her as just a kind person, but now I sensed she could be a valuable ally.</p>
<p>There was also Team leader Jeong Han-il that CEO Jang had mentioned. His descriptor was ‘fire.’ I took note of his face—he looked incredibly cunning.</p>
<p>Luckily, I had an excellent memory, and after one look, I could recall faces and details perfectly. Soon, I had memorized every person and comment from my phone’s gallery. With the additional information from the former secretary and the information team, I felt ready to return to work.</p>
<p>My determination burned fiercely. There has never been a time where I felt a clear sense of purpose.</p>
<p>I searched Miss Yena’s bag. It contained only a pouch with cosmetics and a wallet. Perhaps she needed a larger bag for her laptop.</p>
<p>Moving on to the laptop, I turned it on. As the Chief said, only emails were recovered inside, and at least they were work-related.</p>
<p>“Hmmm.”</p>
<p>There must be a safe in her room. Could there be any hints about the password?</p>
<p>I opened the pouch and found two small keys tied together. They weren’t room keys. What could they be for? I put the keys back in the pouch. I would need to find where they fit, either at home or at the office.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, I received a message from Director Han, asking me to come to his office. I remembered my grandfather’s words—to listen to what Director Han had to say.</p>
<p>Determined, I walked to his office, despite Housekeeper Ahn’s insistence that I should still use a wheelchair. I believed walking was essential for my quick recovery. After asking for directions, I reached the office.</p>
<p>“Phew.”</p>
<p>I was nervous. I was about to uncover the secret known only to the neurologist, Director Han, my grandfather, and Miss Yena. I had to be careful not to give anything away. After knocking, I opened the door to Director Han’s office. He rose from the sofa with an emotional expression and grasped my hands.</p>
<p>“Yena, it’s a miracle!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>He locked the door and guided me to the sofa, lowering his voice as if sharing a secret.</p>
<p>“All the test results are normal. This is unprecedented.”</p>
<p>I blinked. Normal results? Did that mean Miss Yena had been seriously ill?</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Yena, every single test result is normal. There’s no more shortness of breath or trembling. You’re completely healthy.”</p>
<p>A memory flashed of Miss Yena struggling to breathe, a look of panic on her face. She had told me it was asthma. So it wasn’t asthma after all.</p>
<p>“Does Grandfather know?”</p>
<p>“I informed him immediately. He was skeptical at first but was thrilled when I showed him the results.”</p>
<p>I decided to take a bold step.</p>
<p>“Director Han.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Yena?”</p>
<p>“There’s something I haven’t told you.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I… I don’t remember many things.”</p>
<p>I thought this was the best way to avoid suspicion while living in Miss Yena’s body.</p>
<p>Director Han was taken aback.</p>
<p>“But your brain scans were clear.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I didn’t tell anyone. I thought my memory would return, but it hasn’t.”</p>
<p>“Is it certain periods you can’t remember, or specific events?”</p>
<p>“I remember my family, but nothing about work or people I knew when I was younger. When CEO Jang visited, I didn’t recognize him at first. I thought it best to keep this a secret.”</p>
<p>As I spoke, I surprised myself with how convincingly I lied. My calm demeanor and expressions left no room for doubt. Director Han looked grave, pondering my words for a while before speaking.</p>
<p>“It seems like dissociative amnesia…”</p>
<p>“I think so too.”</p>
<p>“And you still don’t remember anything from your childhood?”</p>
<p>Still? I answered calmly.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He sighed deeply.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s natural that you don’t remember. They must all be memories you’d rather forget.”</p>
<p>I listened carefully. If he was referring to memories I’d want to forget, he might be talking about when my parents died. I decided to take another risk.</p>
<p>“Actually, I don’t even remember what illness I had.”</p>
<p>Director Han looked surprised.</p>
<p>“You were suspected of having ALS, Miss Yena.”</p>
<p>“ALS?”</p>
<p>“It’s also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Recently, your condition was rapidly worsening.”</p>
