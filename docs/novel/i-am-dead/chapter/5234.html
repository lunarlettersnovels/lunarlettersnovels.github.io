        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 2.1</strong></p>
<p>Several days have passed.</p>
<p>I kept my job a secret from everyone. My grandfather said he would personally inform them the day before I started. I was grateful.</p>
<p>If they knew in advance, my mother-in-law’s reaction would be predictable, and I was especially afraid of how my husband would react once he found out that the shares were transferred to me.</p>
<p>I have to handle the divorce issue carefully. They have a powerful legal team. To fight them, I need to gather more evidence. It would help if my husband were involved in drugs or something.</p>
<p>Because in this family, infidelity isn’t considered a big deal. When would be a good time?</p>
<p>I was working in the secret room when the phone rang. It was Miss Yena.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss.”</p>
<p>[What are you doing, sister?]</p>
<p>“Just sitting around.”</p>
<p>Her cheerful voice had no shadow.</p>
<p>[Would you like to have lunch together tomorrow?]</p>
<p>“With me?”</p>
<p>[Yes. I have a prior engagement today. Is that okay?]</p>
<p>“What’s the occasion?”</p>
<p>[We have things to talk about.]</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>[Oh, come on. Grandpa told me. You’re starting work next month. I have so much to discuss with you, and it’s hard to do that at home. I’m really looking forward to it.]</p>
<p>Her voice was filled with anticipation. Her words, welcoming me, made my heart flutter.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll come to the office tomorrow.”</p>
<p>[Okay. I’ll call home and tell them I left something behind. That should work, right?]</p>
<p>It was a common enough occurrence that it wouldn’t arouse suspicion. Pleased with her meticulousness, I agreed.</p>
<p>“I’ll bring you some clothes.”</p>
<p>[Okay. I’ll be late today. Don’t prepare dinner for me.]</p>
<p>“Are you busy?”</p>
<p>[I’m swamped. I’ll come home after work.]</p>
<p>After hanging up, I patted my cheeks. Could there finally be light in this dark hole? I couldn’t believe it. Just then, my phone alerted me.</p>
<p>[The director has arrived.]</p>
<p>Startled, I stood up, organized my files, and hurried out of the room. Shortly after leaving my office, my husband entered. When I saw the murderous expression on his face, my heart sank.</p>
<p>“Dear, wh-what’s wrong…!”</p>
<p>Before I could finish, stars flashed before my eyes, and I felt a stinging pain in my cheek. My body stumbled, unable to withstand the force.</p>
<p>Before I could even lift my head, my husband grabbed my neck. I couldn’t breathe, and blood rushed to my face. He pushed me roughly against the wall.</p>
<p>“Was it you? Did you trick Grandfather and took his shares?”</p>
<p>The pain of being strangled was familiar. Getting slapped was also something I’m used to. But right now, surviving is my priority. My husband’s eyes were already deranged.</p>
<p>“Wh-what are you talking about? I… don’t know….”</p>
<p>“Don’t know? Really?”</p>
<p>If I admitted it here, I would die. Crying, I pleaded.</p>
<p>“I really… don’t know….”</p>
<p>My husband, glaring at me with narrowed eyes, looked menacing. I felt a chill run down my spine.</p>
<p>“My grandfather’s shares have been transferred. Do you know how hard it was to search for several days?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know… Really, I don’t…”</p>
<p>Perhaps because he felt the sincerity in my words, my husband released his grip, and I clutched my neck, coughing. As air entered my oxygen-deprived lungs, I wheezed uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Then, I heard the sound of a belt being unfastened. Horrified, I saw my husband wrapping the belt around his hand, smiling coldly.</p>
<p>“When Grandfather transfers the shares to your name, you will immediately gift them to me.”</p>
<p>The belt in his hand scared me more than his words. Whenever things didn’t go his way, my husband would turn violent.</p>
<p>Today was one of those days. I felt chills, and my legs trembled.</p>
<p>“Dear… I really don’t know anything.”</p>
<p>“I get it. I’ll believe you this time.”</p>
<p>My husband gestured for me to turn around. I was in despair. This madman was not human.</p>
<p>A flurry of thoughts crossed my mind. Should I just file for divorce now? I can’t live like this anymore.</p>
<p>I don’t want to live.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath and steeling myself, I said,</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>My refusal made my husband’s eyes widen.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’m getting a divorce. From now on, I am no longer your wife, Namgung Muyeol.”</p>
<p>His eyes widened, and then he laughed out loud. When all the laughter was gone, there was an eerie silence, and then he swung his fist with a maniacal look on his face.</p>
<p>The blow sent me flying. The pain in my jaw felt as if it had shattered.</p>
<p>“What? Divorce?”</p>
<p>I cried for my life.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just marry your mistress! Why are you doing this!”</p>
<p>My words made my husband pause. His lips curled into a sinister smile. I wanted to tell him that Grandfather knew about it and had agreed to the divorce, but I held back.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know that divorce is impossible in our family? If it were possible, it would’ve happened already. Why are you acting like you don’t know?”</p>
<p>His vile laughter sent chills down my spine. He picked up the belt and approached, and my body shook.</p>
<p>“If you do this, you’ll be at a disadvantage in the divorce proceedings!”</p>
<p>He sneered.</p>
<p>“Is there even a law firm willing to handle your divorce? Or do you want to get your father kicked out of his position as president?” Then, with a chilly smile, he said,</p>
<p>“Oh! How about just dying? That would be perfect. You’d escape from this house, and it would be good for me too. Right?”</p>
<p>I gritted my teeth and turned around the moment he raised his arm. At the sound of the merciless whip cracking, I felt a searing pain in my back.</p>
<p>After the second strike, I lost consciousness.</p>
<p>When I came to my senses, it was almost time for dinner. Mrs. Ahn, the housekeeper, entered the room and found me unconscious.</p>
<p>“Ma’am! Ma’am!”</p>
<p>Barely opening my eyes, I saw Mrs. Ahn crying.</p>
<p>“How… how could this….”</p>
<p>Lifting me, Mrs. Ahn was at a loss, crying. She sat me on the bed, took off my blouse, brought the first aid kit, and applied medicine to my wounds.</p>
<p>The antiseptic stung like fire. But the pain was nothing compared to my overwhelming sense of shame and despair. I barely held back my tears.</p>
