            <p><strong>Chapter 13.2</strong></p>
<p>My mother-in-law’s hand, griping the sofa’s armrest, turned white. She forced a smile and said, “Just meet him. Your uncle introduced him. He said he’s a good person.”</p>
<p>I resisted the urge to scoff. “No thanks.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It seems like you want to kick me out of this house.”</p>
<p>“What!”</p>
<p>“I’m already seeing someone.”</p>
<p>She was about to yell but stopped short. “What?”</p>
<p>I looked at her calmly. This time, I didn’t tremble before her—she could no longer hit or verbally abuse Lee Buyeon. Though she was older, in terms of family hierarchy, Namgung Yena ranked above her.</p>
<p>“I said I’m seeing someone.”</p>
<p>Her face contorted in an ugly expression. “Do you realize you’re disrespecting your uncle with this behavior?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. I wasn’t afraid of her anymore. “Believe it or not, I am seeing someone.”</p>
<p>She visibly faltered at my demeanor. “Who… who is it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I need to tell you.”</p>
<p>“Hey! Namgung Yena!”</p>
<p>“Oh my. Aunt, Grandfather is right across the hall.”</p>
<p>Her face turned bright red as she trembled with rage. I had never seen her like this before, and it felt exhilarating.</p>
<p>“Orphaned brat.”</p>
<p>“I never asked for your pity.”</p>
<p>“Arrogant b!tch.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>When I didn’t back down, she jumped up and raised her arm. I looked her straight in the eyes. I won’t let you hit me anymore.</p>
<p>“Are you going to hit me?”</p>
<p>I stood up and leaned my cheek towards her. “Go ahead, hit me.”</p>
<p>She clenched her fist but couldn’t bring herself to strike me, trembling violently.</p>
<p>“Crazy b!tch.”</p>
<p>My mother-in-law swore and stormed out, stomping her slippers along the way like a petulant child.</p>
<p>I laughed. So, this is what power feels like.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law, who had always terrified me, was just another lower rung on the family pyramid. Now, there was nothing I couldn’t do, no need to watch my back. I no longer had to be scared of getting hit or be on edge all the time.</p>
<p>When I got home earlier, I was worried about how to act around my family members, but this incident erased those worries. There was no need to fear them anymore.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>When evening came, all I had to do was escort Grandfather to the dining room at mealtime. There was no need to hustle in the kitchen to prepare the food.</p>
<p>When I entered the dining room, everyone stood up from their chairs simultaneously. Of course, they stood because of Grandfather, but it still felt good. I stared at my husband. Just looking at his face made my stomach turn.</p>
<p>Dinner was served. As soon as I saw the plate placed in front of me, I hesitated. It was Korean cuisine, with the main dish being braised short ribs. Grandfather’s gaze turned sharp when he saw my plate.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you know that Yena can’t eat meat?”</p>
<p>“Oh my, did Yena get braised ribs? There must have been a mistake in the kitchen. Yena, just eat around the ribs.”</p>
<p>I looked at my mother-in-law. Miss Yena, in the past, didn’t eat meat. This was intentional, a petty revenge for my earlier defiance. But I wasn’t going to play along. I spoke to Grandfather.</p>
<p>“It’s alright, Grandfather. I eat meat now. I have been avoiding it because of my diet, but I’ve decided to start eating it again because I was getting too thin.”</p>
<p>Then, I smiled sweetly at my mother-in-law.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Aunt. I’ll enjoy the meal.”</p>
<p>I deliberately picked up the biggest piece of meat and ate it with relish. I almost laughed at the stunned faces of my mother-in-law and father-in-law. Not just them, but my husband and his two brothers were also stunned.</p>
<p>“That’s right. You don’t need to diet. Eating well and being healthy is the best,” said my sister-in-law, Chae-Ian, with a kind tone.</p>
<p>“Thank you, little sister.”</p>
<p>At that moment, my mother-in-law interjected.</p>
<p>“From now on, just call her sister.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“There’s only one daughter-in-law in this house, so why do you still call her little sister?”</p>
<p>“Wow, unbelievable. It hasn’t been long since elder sister passed away, and you’re already like this? Is no one mourning her death? Not even you, brother? Surely not?”</p>
<p>I smiled brightly as I looked directly at my husband. He was flustered.</p>
<p>“Of course not. It feels like she’s still alive.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Really? Then can you see who’s behind you?”</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look behind him. He, especially, turned pale and looked over his shoulder, and lost his temper.</p>
<p>“Namgung Yena!”</p>
<p>I burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Just kidding, just kidding. But brother, be careful,” I looked at him with a sharp gaze, “They say a restless spirit who died with so much resentment can’t leave the house. They become a ghost, haunting the halls with vengeance.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>“Oh, these braised ribs are really delicious. Everyone, dig in before the food gets cold.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s faces turned red with embarrassment. The only person who managed to suppress a smile was Grandfather. It wasn’t long before my mother-in-law, having calmed herself, spoke elegantly.</p>
<p>“Father, did you know Yena is seeing someone?”</p>
<p>I flinched for a moment. A counterattack? Grandfather couldn’t hide his surprise and asked,</p>
<p>“You are?”</p>
<p>I could see right through her. She believed I was lying and wanted to expose me in front of Grandfather. I answered calmly,</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandfather, I am.”</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you later. We’re still getting to know each other.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re not just lying?” My mother-in-law suddenly interjected.</p>
