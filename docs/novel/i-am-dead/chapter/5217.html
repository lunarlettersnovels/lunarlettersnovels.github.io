            <p><strong>Chapter 10.2</strong></p>
<p>With Grandfather’s tacit approval, the entire family persecuted and punished me with fists or words. Grandfather’s face turned grim.</p>
<p>“You’re right. It’s my fault….”</p>
<p>I felt uneasy at Grandfather’s self-reproach. The only reason I could endure in this household was because of him. Yet, this was why I brought it up.</p>
<p>“I would like you to give the shares supposedly for sister, to her father.”</p>
<p>“To my in-laws?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It was meant for sister anyway. Since she’s not here anymore, it makes even less sense for older brother to have it.”</p>
<p>“But I intended to give it to you.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. Even without it, I can become the head.”</p>
<p>Grandfather’s eyes widened at my words. “Have you made up your mind?”</p>
<p>As expected, Grandfather’s trusted confidante was Miss Yena.</p>
<p>“Yes. My health is better now, and there’s no reason not to. Besides, I don’t want older brother Muyeol to take it.”</p>
<p>“’Your uncle (Muyeol’s father) won’t stay quiet. Be careful, and let’s keep this between you and me. I’ll handle the preparations.”</p>
<p>Grandfather’s expression shifted. With a new goal in sight, he wouldn’t falter or lose will like my parents.</p>
<p>“I’m being discharged this Friday and plan to start working next week,” I declared.</p>
<p>“Are you sure that’s okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I haven’t felt this motivated in a long time. I’ll work even harder,” I added, “for sister’s sake, too.”</p>
<p>His eyes flickered as he looked at me. “Alright. Work as if you’re doing it for your sister.”</p>
<p>“I want to hire my sister’s mother as the consultant for the project,” I proposed.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Han?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Originally, I was going to ask sister. I need someone who can cook well and, most importantly, someone I can trust.”‘</p>
<p>Grandfather nodded thoughtfully. “That’s a good idea. Mrs. Han needs to work to move on from grief. It’s a good idea.”</p>
<p>“I also suggested the uncle-in-law to run for election. That’s why I asked you to transfer the shares to him.”</p>
<p>“I’ll handle that.”</p>
<p>“I plan to visit occasionally and help with the campaign.”</p>
<p>“Can you really manage this? You must be busy with work at the company.”</p>
<p>“I’m doing this for my sister.”</p>
<p>Grandfather didn’t protest further. I stepped out of the room and glanced around. The place was quiet. Heading to the main entrance, I looked around and went upstairs to the second floor. Finally, I entered my room, locked the door, and entered the secret room.</p>
<p>I opened the safe and took out the files inside. This was why I came here today. These must not be discovered by anyone. I put the files into my bag, went back downstairs, and ran into Jeongeun.</p>
<p>“Miss, why are you coming down from there?”</p>
<p>“Just looking for something,” I replied casually.</p>
<p>I didn’t elaborate further. Confidently, I walked to the entrance, opened the door, and left. I got into the car and said, “Please take me to the hospital.”</p>
<p>As the car left the family estate, we passed the main gate and reached the intersection where the accident had occurred earlier. It felt unsettling. Just a short while ago, an accident had happened here, but now it was peaceful. I leaned back in my seat and closed my eyes tightly.</p>
<p>By the time we arrived at the hospital, it was already dinner time. While waiting for the elevator, my phone rang. The caller ID showed it was Jang Doha.</p>
<p>“Yes, President.”</p>
<p>[Did you have dinner?]</p>
<p>“Not yet.”</p>
<p>[Good. Should I wait for you? I’ll bring some food.]</p>
<p>“Yes?” I was momentarily stunned. Food? Why?</p>
<p>[Because I don’t want to eat alone. You should eat too, right, Yena?]</p>
<p>This was definitely a clear signal of affection. One shouldn’t easily dismiss someone who wants to share a meal together.</p>
<p>“Okay… why not? What are you going to bring?”</p>
<p>[Really? Can I come over?]</p>
<p>His flustered tone was evident. I almost laughed. If I were Miss Yena, I would have replied playfully, too, but sadly, my heart was grim with the reality entrusted to me. I didn’t have time to dwell or ponder about his intentions.</p>
<p>“I feel like having steak. I prefer medium well.”</p>
<p>[Got it. I’ll get that.]</p>
<p>Even through his trembling voice, I could sense how happy and flustered he must be right now. After ending the call and getting on the elevator, I couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>Jang Doha’s face, blushing as he held out the rose, kept coming to mind.</p>
