            <p><strong>Chapter 9.1</strong></p>
<p>I stepped out of the hospital alongside Chief Jeon. As we emerged, a sleek Bentley glided to a stop before me.</p>
<p>“Our Honorary Chairman wants you to have a sturdier car from now on. From now on, a designated driver will escort you,” Chief Jeon said.</p>
<p>“Very well,” I replied calmly, though inwardly, my chest tightened and my legs quivered.</p>
<p>The accident’s aftermath was proving more daunting than I had anticipated. Hadn’t I nearly lost my life moments ago? After a few steadying breaths, I managed to step into the car. Seated beside me, the Chief turned and asked,</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Let us proceed,” I replied, attempting to maintain composure despite the tremors betraying my nerves. The Chief glanced back and inquired,</p>
<p>“Should we return to the hospital?”</p>
<p>“No, there’s no need. Besides, I must use the car to go to work.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I insisted through gritted teeth. I couldn’t afford to falter now. If I succumbed to such trivialities, how would I face greater challenges ahead? Closing my eyes, I attempted to summon memories of carefree childhood days, but the effort proved futile. Perhaps it was the brush with death, but the trembling intensified.</p>
<p>“…should I drive you to work?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the unexpected offer from CEO Jang Doha flashed through my mind, along with the single rose he had shyly presented. Remembering our conversation eased the tremors and slowed my racing heartbeat. As I calmed down, I said to the Chief,</p>
<p>“There’s something I haven’t mentioned. I don’t need the car to go to work.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Someone else will drive me. You can come pick me up when I leave work.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>The Chief didn’t say much, but what pleased me more was that he didn’t inquire about the reason. There was no need for detailed and trivial explanations. As my anxiety subsided, I could go to my parents’ house a bit more comfortably.</p>
<p>The car rolled to a stop in front of my parents’ house. Beyond the fence, a persimmon tree drooped heavily, burdened with fruit that seemed too weighty for its branches.</p>
<p>Normally, my mother would have harvested and dried them by now, but this year they hung untouched. Just seeing that made my eyes grow warm. I pressed the doorbell. Silence greeted me. I pressed it again.</p>
<p>Did they went out? After a moment, a weary voice called out,</p>
<p>“Who is it…?”</p>
<p>My throat tightened at my mother-in-law’s lifeless voice.</p>
<p>“It’s me… Namgung Yena.”</p>
<p>“Miss Yena?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me.”</p>
<p>The door opened, and I entered with Chief Jeon carrying two travel bags. Maybe because of how I felt, even the yard seemed like a ruin. Even the porch that was swept and cleaned had leaves piled up, evidence that it hadn’t been touched by human hands.</p>
<p>The front door opened, and my haggard mother came out. I was greeted by her rough skin and chapped lips and her thin, frail body.</p>
<p>Tears were about to pour out. I gritted my teeth. If I cried here, it would only make things harder for my mother. Suppressing my emotions, I lowered my head and greeted her.</p>
<p>“How have you been? I’ve come to see you.”</p>
<p>Seeing me, my mother’s eyes welled up with tears.</p>
<p>“Thank you…”</p>
<p>“Is the President inside…?”</p>
<p>“He’s inside. Let’s go in.”</p>
<p>As I followed her into the house, I saw my gaunt father waiting in the living room. My heart throbbed at the sight of his body, which was even thinner than it was during the funeral.</p>
<p>“What brought our daughter’s sister-in-law in here..?”</p>
<p>I met his gaze in silence, feeling as though my very soul had been replaced. Perhaps my presence was a reminder that life continued despite their loss. Yet, seeing them both stirred feelings of guilt and sorry.</p>
<p>“You must keep going.”</p>
<p>At my unexpected words, my mother burst into tears, and my father gave a bitter smile. My heart felt torn apart. After bidding farewell to Chief Jeon, I took the lunch box I had brought to the kitchen and set the table. I heated the porridge and took out two of my mother’s cherished bowls. I wanted to take out some water kimchi as well, but I hesitated.</p>
<p>“Could you come here for a moment?”</p>
<p>When they entered the kitchen, they were surprised to see the porridge.</p>
<p>“What is all this…?”</p>
<p>“It’s porridge. I brought it from home.”</p>
<p>Forcing a bright expression, I sat my mother down on a chair and had my father as well. The two of them, taken aback, sat down in a daze.</p>
<p>“Please eat. I thought you might not have eaten anything. Our grandfather isn’t eating at all either.”</p>
<p>“The Honorary Chairman?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I thought he might eat this, so I asked for it. It’s the same recipe my sister used to make.”</p>
