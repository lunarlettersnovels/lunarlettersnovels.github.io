            <h3>Chapter 28</h3>
<p>As time passed, I started feeling worse. I’d pulled an all-nighter, then ran early in the morning. To top it off, the breakfast I forced down left me bloated, and my thick makeup made my skin feel like a turtle’s shell—I just wanted to wash it off. As lunchtime approached, I left the Director’s office.</p>
<p>“Let’s have lunch, Director.”</p>
<p>“You go on first.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be back.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Team Leader Jeong Han-il smiled and asked, “Care to join me?”</p>
<p>I smiled back. “Go ahead. I need to remove my makeup first.”</p>
<p>“Well, then I’ll head out first.”</p>
<p>After the staff left the office, I followed five minutes later. I took the elevator down to the first floor, stopping by a convenience store to buy some cleanser. Naturally, I made my way toward the bank. After storing my journal, I stepped out of the bank, making sure to check my surroundings.</p>
<p>Ever since reading the journal, I had become more aware of things I hadn’t paid attention to before.</p>
<p>As I crossed the lobby, my ex-husband stepped out of the elevator. Standing next to him was his personal secretary, Ahn Chihong. I quickly turned around, waiting for them to pass.</p>
<p>“Is she still acting like that?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I think she’s really going to hold a press conference.”</p>
<p>“Damn it, this is driving me insane. Hurry up.”</p>
<p>From their conversation, it was clear that Jung Jinyoung was blackmailing him. Once I confirmed they’d exited through the main entrance, I headed to the elevator. If Jung Jinyoung was trying to enter MK with a fake pregnancy, this could be a great opportunity for me.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law wouldn’t tolerate someone like her, and Jung Jinyoung wasn’t exactly easygoing either. If they ended up fighting every day, that would certainly be entertaining.</p>
<p>Back in my room, I sat on the couch and closed my eyes. There was so much to do, so much to think about, but my body wasn’t keeping up. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message.</p>
<p>[Tutor me.]</p>
<p>A small smile crept onto my face. So he’s made up his mind.</p>
<p>[When?]</p>
<p>[Starting today. The tutoring will take place at my house.]</p>
<p>At his house? Doha’s house?</p>
<p>[Your house? That might be a bit uncomfortable.]</p>
<p>[Well then, should I let them know what our tutoring sessions are about?]</p>
<p>I bit my lip. He had a point, but going to his house felt a little… off.</p>
<p>[I’ll also cook for you. Personally. That’s a service.]</p>
<p>Another message came in right after.</p>
<p>[And I’ll drive you home too. That’s included.]</p>
<p>“Haha.”</p>
<p>This time, I laughed out loud. His sense of humor was refreshing.</p>
<p>[Alright.]</p>
<p>[5:00 pm. Elevator.]</p>
<p>[Okay.]</p>
<p>Another punctual day off. It seems like this will be the case for a while. I decided to call Chief Jeon. After a few rings, I heard his voice.</p>
<p>[Yes, Miss?]</p>
<p>“Starting today, Mr. Jang Doha will be responsible for my ride home.”</p>
<p>[Understood. The car is always ready, so just let me know when you need it.]</p>
<p>“Thank you. By the way, how are the preparations for the camp coming along?”</p>
<p>[We are currently in the process of selecting the personnel. I will submit a separate report on that.]</p>
<p>“I’m counting on you.”</p>
<p>[No worries. His clean image will make it easy to build public support.]</p>
<p>That sounded like a polite way of saying he wasn’t fit for politics.</p>
<p>“You’re quite principled. Please continue to support him well, Chief.”</p>
<p>[I’ll do my best.]</p>
<p>As soon as I hung up, a sigh escaped me. The sheer amount of work made my head throb. Still, it had to be done. I gave up on taking a break and sat down at my desk.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM sharp, I left the Director’s office. Initially, the staff seemed a bit startled, but now they simply accepted it as routine and began tidying up their desks.</p>
<p>“See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Have a good evening.”</p>
<p>All day, my head had felt foggy, like I was walking on water. How did the Young Lady manage late-night work with a body like this? Maybe she did it to avoid spending too much time at home.</p>
<p>I headed for the elevator—CEO Doha was waiting there. He smiled as I asked,</p>
<p>“Aren’t you worried that leaving work right on time will make it seem like you’re slacking off?”</p>
<p>He shrugged. “Leaving on time is only natural. It’s in the employment contract. Are you a cruel boss, Yena?” he replied.</p>
<p>I chuckled. Laughing at his jokes had started to feel natural. He then asked,</p>
<p>“You took off your makeup?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it felt like my skin was cracking after going without it for so long.”</p>
<p>“You’re beautiful just as you are. Don’t hide behind makeup anymore.”</p>
<p>The flattering compliment made me feel awkward, and he noticed, laughing softly.</p>
<p>“Do compliments make you uncomfortable?”</p>
<p>“A little. No one really compliments me so directly.”</p>
<p>“Well, if your boyfriend doesn’t praise you, who will? Compliments are natural between lovers.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure this is your first time dating? You seem a little too good at it.”</p>
<p>“When it comes to love, I don’t hold back. I’ll do whatever it takes to win someone over.”</p>
<p>Even his smooth way of speaking was something I was gradually getting used to.</p>
<p>His house was incredibly close—less than five minutes by car, and that was only because of parking. His place was right next to the office, while mine was an hour away.</p>
<p>“Have you been driving all the way to pick me up every morning, even though you live so close?”</p>
<p>“Now you appreciate it? I told you, I don’t hold back.”</p>
<p>“Don’t come tomorrow. It must be tiring.”</p>
<p>“That won’t do. Now, sit and relax. Dinner will take about 20 minutes.”</p>
<p>“You can cook?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been living alone for years. I’m probably better than you.”</p>
<p>He rolled up his shirt sleeves and headed to the kitchen, where he surprisingly fit right in. Sitting on the sofa, I watched him. It wasn’t an exaggeration—he handled the kitchen tools with ease.</p>
<p>“How did you find out about Director Kwon Sung-il’s stock purchases?”</p>
<p>“I’m a man of talent. That wasn’t hard.”</p>
<p>“So, do you keep track of MK’s stock trends?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Are you interested in MK?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly interested, but I had to know who could get in my way. Now, though, I think I might start paying attention.”</p>
<p>He glanced up and smiled slightly as he continued.</p>
<p>“Even a company needs politics, especially if you want to rise to the top. You know what a kingmaker is, right?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“There’s someone who helped make the current U.S. president. Officially, their role isn’t much, but no one in the White House dares ignore them.”</p>
<p>“You know this person?”</p>
<p>“I learned about politics from them.”</p>
<p>“Were you thinking of going into politics?”</p>
<p>“No. But they told me, the bigger the company gets, the more you’ll need politics. It’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s a necessary part of building a fairer and more just company.”</p>
<p>It turned out the rumors about him having connections in the White House were true.</p>
<p>“You’re more capable than I expected.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be even more impressed. Eventually, you’ll fall for me.”</p>
<p>His confidence was becoming familiar, and I couldn’t help but envy it. As I watched him, my eyelids grew heavier. This wasn’t good. I was supposed to be having a lesson, not drifting off. I blinked, trying to stay awake, but soon enough, my head drooped.</p>
<p>A warmth enveloped me—soft, secure. I stirred slightly, but my body felt sluggish, refusing to move. As I opened my eyes, I froze. Something was right in front of me. Clothes? I focused harder, and then it hit me—bare skin showing through the gap in an open shirt.</p>
<p>My heart raced. Confused, I slowly lifted my head just as a deep voice rumbled from above.</p>
<p>“You’re awake?”</p>
<p>Every muscle in my body tensed. He seemed to notice, and his voice came again, calm and reassuring.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything. I was just lying next to you. No need to be so tense.”</p>
<p>When he stood up, the situation became clear. I had been slumped against the sofa, and he’d been lying next to me, on the outer edge.</p>
<p>“You kept sliding off. I was just stopping you from falling.”</p>
<p>Now seated in a chair, his elbows resting on his knees, he looked exhausted. I fidgeted, still feeling awkward, and asked the first thing that came to mind.</p>
<p>“You didn’t sleep?”</p>
<p>He let out a short, disbelieving laugh.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>He gave me a look, one filled with frustration. “Do you really not know?” he said.</p>
<p>“Know what?”</p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>He dropped his head, letting out a deep sigh. As the fog of sleep left my mind, my face grew hot with embarrassment.</p>
<p>Now I understood his frustration. How could I have fallen asleep like that? What were you thinking, Lee Buyeon? Feeling flustered, I jumped up.</p>
<p>“I should go.”</p>
<p>Before I could take a step, he caught my wrist. Turning back, I found his eyes fixed on mine, crystal-clear and unwavering. It felt like I was being drawn into their depths, as though I was sinking into a calm, endless lake.</p>
<p>We stood there, locked in each other’s gaze, neither of us moving.</p>
<p>I knew this feeling all too well. Even though it had been a while since my husband and I had been intimate, I hadn’t forgotten what that kind of look meant. His gaze was too intense to dismiss. My heart was pounding, my throat suddenly dry.</p>
<p>“When do you get your cast off?”</p>
<p>His voice was low and husky, laced with a raw intensity.</p>
<p>“Next week…”</p>
<p>“Can’t you get it off sooner? Like tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Maybe…”</p>
<p>He sighed again, this time softer, then smiled and stood up.</p>
<p>“Let’s eat. I’m starving.”</p>
<p>He had returned to his usual self, light and easygoing, as if nothing had happened. I watched him walk toward the kitchen, but my heart was still racing.</p>
<p>Something had changed between us. This wasn’t just a casual flirtation anymore, or a relationship between coworkers. I could feel it in the air.</p>
<p>Our dynamic had shifted, and there was no going back.</p>
