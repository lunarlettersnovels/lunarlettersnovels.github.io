            <p><strong>Chapter 5.1</strong></p>
<p>I was taken aback. Miss Yena rarely talked about me, yet he spoke as if he knew something. The two of them might be quite close.</p>
<p>“Yes… Thank you for coming.”</p>
<p>At my words, he looked at me with surprise and an expression as if he was hearing something unfamiliar. His gaze made my heart sink. Clearly, there was something between him and Miss Yena.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you weren’t seriously hurt. Don’t worry about work; just rest comfortably. The company has processed your sick leave.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>I appreciated his words. I needed time right now to understand everything about the company’s internal relationships and tasks—especially this man, Jang Doha.</p>
<p>If they were really dating, my current behavior could become suspicious. His watchful eyes made my heart race. He smiled shyly.</p>
<p>“Take it easy. You’ve been through a tough time and need to recover. Team Leader Jeong Han-il wanted to take over the project that Director Namgung was handling, so I entrusted it to him for now.”</p>
<p>Team Leader Jeong Han-il. I need to gather information about him, too. As he was heading to the door, he stopped, turned back, and looked at me with a deep gaze.</p>
<p>“Thank you for surviving. I mean it.”</p>
<p>My chest felt tight. Miss Yena never mentioned Jang Doha, but what if they were truly special to each other? It felt like a huge mountain was suddenly blocking my path.</p>
<p>Before I could gather my thoughts after Jang Doha left, Director Han came into the room. I hadn’t seen him before, but his gown had “Director Han Wonjun” written on it. He looked to be about sixty, with hair thinning at the top.</p>
<p>“Yena, how are you feeling?”</p>
<p>“Not bad. Except for my arm.”</p>
<p>He chuckled at my response.</p>
<p>“Not that. Any other symptoms?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, my grandfather’s words came to mind.</p>
<p>‘If they learn about your condition, they’ll pounce and tear you apart.’</p>
<p>There was definitely something going on, but I had no idea what it was. I decided to play it safe.</p>
<p>“I’m okay.”</p>
<p>“Really? That’s good to hear. Shall we go for some tests then?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Director.”</p>
<p>“This is Professor Han Euijin from the Neurosurgery Department. You know him, right? He’ll be assisting with your tests today.”</p>
<p>I greeted Professor Han Euijin and left the room in a wheelchair. My mind was racing as we headed to the elevator.</p>
<p>Neurosurgery? Did the young lady have some neurological issues? Was that why my grandfather said what he did?</p>
<p>We got into the elevator, but neither Director Han nor Professor Han spoke to me.</p>
<p>The first place we visited was the Clinical Pathology Department. After they drew my blood, I underwent nerve conduction and electromyography tests, followed by an MRI. I didn’t have to wait long for any of the tests, and it all took less than two hours.</p>
<p>When I returned to the room, Housekeeper Ahn was waiting for me. She greeted me.</p>
<p>“Welcome back.”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>“You look exhausted.”</p>
<p>“I am. I need some rest.”</p>
<p>I collapsed onto the bed, completely spent. I had told the director I was fine, but my body and mind were worn out from the car accident and the trip to the funeral home. On top of that, the hug from a stranger and the subsequent medical examinations left my nerves frayed.</p>
<p>But although I was lying down, it was strangely difficult to sleep. I wanted to lie on my side, but the cast on my arm and neck made it uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I stared blankly at the ceiling. The past few days felt like a dream. If my soul hadn’t been switched, it would be Miss Yena lying here now. I don’t know what she would have thought. I was even more oblivious to her situation.</p>
<p>We were close, but she never shared trivial matters with me. If we had been closer, it would have been helpful now.</p>
<p>And to think I have to go back to work soon… that’s when the real problem starts. It’s fine at home, but company life is an area I know nothing about. I don’t even know anything about the project Miss Yena was handling. And I have no idea what kind of relationship she had with President Jang Doha.</p>
<p>The strange look he gave me before leaving the room lingered in my mind. It was not the kind of look typically exchanged between a superior and a subordinate.</p>
<p>However, when I pushed him away, he seemed genuinely shocked by his own actions. He stammered and blushed. There was something special between them, but it didn’t feel mutual.</p>
