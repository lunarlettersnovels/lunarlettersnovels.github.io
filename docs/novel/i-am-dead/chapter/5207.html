            <p><strong>Chapter 16</strong></p>
<p>I tried to convince myself with the same mantra. If I were Miss Yena, I would be flustered by this sudden change in atmosphere, but I am Buyeon. As if I was brought back to reality, I became less flustered.</p>
<p>I smiled at him and said, “So you know you’re handsome.”</p>
<p>He blinked at my composed attitude, then laughed. “Yena, now I see you’re not someone to be underestimated. Got it. That was refreshing.”</p>
<p>He was as quick-witted as ever. He even noticed that I wanted to change the subject.</p>
<p>“So, where are we going now?” I asked.</p>
<p>“To see the autumn leaves. They say you must see them in the fall.”</p>
<p>“Autumn leaves?”</p>
<p>“Do you know Hwadamsup* They say the autumn leaves there are breathtaking.”</p>
<p>“Where is that?”</p>
<p>“Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province. It was hard to make a reservation. It sold out in a minute.”</p>
<p>*Hwadamsup autumn leaves.</p>
<p>I was puzzled. “How did you know today would work out when you made the reservation?”</p>
<p>“I planned to go alone if I couldn’t take you. At the time of the reservation, I thought it would be nice to go with you.”</p>
<p>“So you’re really lucky today?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I laughed. Perhaps because of this pleasant atmosphere, I was suddenly giddy. It had been exactly ten years since I had gone out for fun.</p>
<p>“Can I open the window?”</p>
<p>“It’s warm today. I’ll open it for you.”</p>
<p>He opened the window, and a cool breeze eagerly swept inside, ruffling my hair. I stretched my hand out, feeling the freedom slip through my fingers, tingling.</p>
<p>I am free now. Even though my body is Namgung Yena’s, I feel fortunate to be alive.</p>
<p>As I leaned out a little further, the wind brushed my cheek. I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t. And at that moment, Jang Doha said,</p>
<p>“Scream if you want.”</p>
<p>He turned to me and gave me a relaxed smile. “Screaming helps relieve stress.”</p>
<p>“Can I really?”</p>
<p>“Who’s here besides us?”</p>
<p>His words gave me a surge of confidence. Regardless of the cars behind us or the fact that we were on the road, I took a deep breath and let my voice out.</p>
<p>“Yaaaaa! Yaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>The sound of my scream quickly dispersed into the air. Instead, a coolness filled my heart. I felt relaxation seeping into my hard, tense mind, making me feel a little softer. I smiled at him, and the expression on his face when he saw my smile was a bit strange. As I rolled up the windows, feeling relieved and a bit conscious, he spoke.</p>
<p>“Keep smiling like that. You used to smile a lot, but this smile looks different. It’s beautiful.”</p>
<p>I was taken aback. Had I really smiled? Thinking about it, when I was with him, I laughed and smiled more than I ever did before.</p>
<p>How long had it been since I last smiled like this? Before marriage, I used to smile often, but over the years, all joy had drained away. I lived in constant fear, controlling and suppressing my emotions to avoid sudden outbursts of violence.</p>
<p>Now, sitting here, I felt a wave of gratitude toward him rather than embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Thank you for bringing me out.”</p>
<p>“Come out often. There are many places you haven’t been to because of work.”</p>
<p>My heart felt warm and cozy. Despite the congested road, my mind was clear.</p>
<p>We arrived at Hwadamsup and barely managed to find a parking spot. Stepping out of the car, I was struck by the breathtaking view.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing.”</p>
<p>Not only were the autumn leaves impressive, but the sheer number of people was also striking. It had been a long time since I had been in such a crowded place.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment.”</p>
<p>He popped open the trunk and pulled out a pair of sneakers. “Try these on. I bought them by estimate, so I’m not sure if they’ll fit.”</p>
<p>I blushed slightly. “Are these for me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, just in case. Give them a try.”</p>
<p>I slipped off my heels and eased into the sneakers. They fit like they were made for me. A satisfied smile spread across his face.</p>
<p>“They fit well. Are they comfortable?”</p>
<p>“Very comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Hold on a second. Let me tie the laces better.”</p>
<p>This nearly six-foot-three man knelt before me and carefully retied the laces. It was an unexpectedly romantic gesture. Passersby glanced at us with envious eyes, causing my face to flush.</p>
<p>He finally stood up, flashing me a bright but coy smile. He then took off his gray scarf and gently wrapped it around my neck.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to…”</p>
<p>“It’s cold in the mountains.”</p>
<p>My cheeks warmed inexplicably. This was the first time anyone had treated me like this. He smiled as he draped the scarf around my neck.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>He was dressed in a gray turtleneck sweater and a slightly darker gray overcoat, looking even taller. In my sneakers instead of heels, I had to tilt my head back to meet his gaze.</p>
<p>“You’re really tall.”</p>
<p>“I was even offered a spot on the basketball team.”</p>
<p>Basketball? That suited him.</p>
<p>“Did you join the team?”</p>
<p>“No. Instead, I got into street basketball. Do you know 3-on-3 street basketball?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I used to watch it all the time when I studied abroad.</p>
<p>“I think it suits you.”</p>
<p>“Joining the team meant I would have cut my study hours, so I played it as a hobby. I didn’t want to devote myself to basketball entirely.”</p>
<p>We walked slowly, chatting along the way. Conversations with him were always enjoyable. He paused at the ticket booth.</p>
<p>“Just a moment.”</p>
<p>He bought something and came back over, beaming with a big smile.</p>
<p>“Looks like we’re in luck. I got tickets for the monorail.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“It’s a ride that takes you up. It would be tiring for you to walk all the way, and they say the monorail is a must.”</p>
<p>“Who says so?”</p>
<p>“I did some research. I was excited just thinking about coming here with you.”</p>
<p>He said such corny things so earnestly. Maybe it was his pure-hearted nature. We waited our turn and boarded the white monorail. He positioned me by the window and stood behind me protectively. In his large presence, I felt safe. My heart fluttered a bit. The monorail started moving, and a subtle fragrance wafted from him. It was the same scent I noticed at the hospital, soothing and calming. He marveled at the view.</p>
<p>He said such cheesy things with such sincerity. Maybe it was his pure-hearted nature. We patiently waited our turn and boarded the white monorail. He then guided me to a window seat and stood protectively behind me.</p>
<p>I felt secure, wrapped in his tall presence. I discreetly placed my hand over my chest, where my heart was pounding faintly. As the monorail started moving, I could smell a subtle fragrance waft from him—the same soothing scent I noticed at the hospital.</p>
<p>As the monorail went deeper, little by little. I was suddenly caught by the marvelous view.</p>
<p>“Wow, this is just beautiful.”</p>
<p>From above, Hwadamsup was stunning. The unfolding display of autumn foliage especially captivated me, and I murmured, “It looks just like Central Park.”</p>
<p>“The leaves are beautiful there, too, but I think this is even more spectacular. South Korea has so many beautiful places.”</p>
<p>Miss Yena and I attended different schools. I went to NYU, and technically, I was Jang Doha’s senior. But to avoid any misunderstandings, I intentionally refrained from discussing school.</p>
<p>Right now, I was too caught up in enjoying my first taste of freedom in Hwadamsup, and I was likely to slip up.</p>
<p>As we got off the monorail, he said, “It takes about 90 minutes to see everything here. Let me know if your feet hurt, and we’ll head back.”</p>
<p>I nodded. Even if my feet hurt, I was determined to see everything. We walked slowly. While my spirit felt like it could wander endlessly here, Miss Yena’s body was weary.</p>
<p>After about 20 minutes, I began to pant. My legs felt heavy, my heart gasped for air, and sweat beaded on my forehead.</p>
<p>“Huff… huff…”</p>
<p>Seeing me struggle, he grew anxious. “Let’s go back.”</p>
<p>“No. I want to see everything. We can go slowly.”</p>
<p>This felt like the first real test of Miss Yena’s physical endurance. I wasn’t exactly in great shape myself, but her body was in terrible condition. How had she managed this long?</p>
<p>Of course. I suddenly remembered her Lou Gehrig’s disease and smiled sadly. ‘You’ve endured well with this body. From now on, I’ll make sure you’re healthy.’</p>
<p>We took frequent breaks. It felt like I was gasping for every bit of air I could muster. Initially, he insisted we turn back, but as my determination solidified, he silently stayed by my side.</p>
<p>“Hold on,” he said.</p>
<p>Using his arm for support, I walked slowly. At some point, he had taken my coat and was holding it. We walked a few steps, paused, and walked again. That’s how we made it to the top of Hwadamsup.</p>
<p>I looked down at the forest, the autumn leaves now held more meaning than just their beauty. For me, they symbolized a sense of accomplishment, as if I had completed my first mission. I sensed his gaze on me.</p>
<p>“Yena, I’m impressed.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I thought you’d ask to go back halfway.”</p>
<p>“This felt like a challenge I couldn’t back down from. I wouldn’t have made it without you, President Jang. Thank you.”</p>
<p>I raised my head and looked at him. The wind blew, tousling his hair and mine. It was a strange sensation. The feeling of having accomplished something with him made me feel more connected, and my trust in him had grown. I offered my hand to shake, and he took it, grinning as he asked.</p>
<p>“We’ve gotten a bit closer, haven’t we?”</p>
<p>I smiled sincerely. My chest was warm. “Yes, I think so,” I agreed.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>As we left Hwadamsup, we gave up on finding a nearby restaurant; there were just too many people. He started searching on his phone.</p>
<p>“Let’s just eat anywhere we find on the way,” I suggested.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “This is our first date. We can’t just eat anywhere.”</p>
<p>At that moment, I realized we needed to have a serious conversation.</p>
<p>“President Jang.”</p>
<p>“You should only call me that at work. If you call me President Jang in front of my family, they’ll get suspicious.”</p>
<p>He was right, but I addressed him anyway.</p>
<p>“President Jang, I need to talk to you about something.”</p>
<p>At my gentle tone, he put down his phone and looked at me. “I’m ready. Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“The MK Chairman tried to marry me off to the Prosecutor General’s son.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you said you were dating me?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And you said I was your girlfriend. So I thought this could be mutually beneficial…”</p>
<p>He looked at me with a strange, unreadable expression. It was the first time I’d received such a look from a man, but I wasn’t too naive to understand what it meant. I blinked, flustered, as he spoke calmly. His voice was deeper than before.</p>
<p>“I like you, Yena.”</p>
<p>It was a simple yet heartfelt confession. For a moment, my heart wavered, but then I was brought back to 10 years ago—I had heard something similar back then, too. My ex-husband had confessed in the same way.</p>
<p>“I don’t trust men’s confessions. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>The words came out of my mouth reflexively. I shouldn’t have been nervous. I was expecting this. But my voice couldn’t help but tremble, and I didn’t know why.</p>
