            <p><strong>Chapter 1.1</strong></p>
<p>“Ma’am.”</p>
<p>When I heard someone calling me, I realized it was 6 o’clock. After inspecting the plates that had finished being plated, I nodded, and the staff, dressed in neatly pressed maid uniforms, waited for me, holding brass trays.</p>
<p>For breakfast, I wake up and start moving at 3 a.m. It’s not just me. The dozens of kitchen staff do the same.</p>
<p>They wait for me to make the first move. If I’m even a minute late, my stern mother-in-law’s gaze turns fiercer. So today, as always, I move with nerves on edge. This has been my morning ritual for ten years.</p>
<p>After removing my silk apron, I make a final inspection of the staff’s attire. One staff member has a stain on her sleeve.</p>
<p>“Jeongeun, I’ll take this today.”</p>
<p>She looks bewildered, and then flustered when I point to her sleeve.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, ma’am. I’ll change right away.”</p>
<p>I smile and say, “It’s okay. I’ll take it today.”</p>
<p>“But it’s heavy.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Everyone else is carrying them, too.”</p>
<p>“Thank you….”</p>
<p>Smiling, I take Jeongeun’s tray and lead the way. The brass trays and bowls are quite heavy. But for a day, it’s no problem. It’s better than having Jeongeun get into trouble with my mother-in-law, who would not hesitate to fire her for something like this.</p>
<p>Behind me, the staff follow in a line with their trays. When the back door of the dining room swings open on both sides, and I set the tray down in front of my grandfather-in-law at the head of the table, the staff simultaneously place their square trays in front of the family members.</p>
<p>The table, which seats twelve, is perfectly set. The flower arrangement in the center and the chandelier above are spotless.</p>
<p>When I take my seat, Grandfather speaks.</p>
<p>“Let’s eat.”</p>
<p>As Grandfather lifts his spoon, the rest of the family begins their meal. Grandfather built the current MK empire. Namgung Beom, the honorary chairman. Although he has stepped down to an honorary position, he is the real power behind the group and the household.</p>
<p>“Your milk porridge is good today.”</p>
<p>At Grandfather’s compliment, I smile softly.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Grandfather.”</p>
<p>To Grandfather’s right is my father-in-law, Namgung Jeong-ryeol, the chairman of MK. To his left sits Namgung Yena, my sister-in-law, instead of my mother-in-law. She is the only daughter of my late uncle, making her my cousin-in-law.</p>
<p>Meals at the family table are strictly determined by shares. That Yena’s seat is ahead of my father’s indicates her share is no less than his. She even holds more shares than my husband.</p>
<p>My husband Namgung Muyeol, the eldest; the second son, Jinseok; and the youngest, Taejun, make up my mother-in-law’s three sons.</p>
<p>Despite the early hour, my mother-in-law sits elegantly with makeup perfectly done, appearing graceful and aloof but more cunning and ruthless than anyone—of course, only towards me and the employees.</p>
<p>She embodies the principle of the strong, preying on the weak.</p>
<p>The etiquette at this family’s meals is so strict that not even the sound of cutlery against plates is heard. It’s a wonder how any food goes down in such an atmosphere.</p>
<p>But I show no emotion on my face. The moment I do, I’ll suffer verbal and physical abuse from my mother-in-law. This is one of the survival tactics I’ve learned from ten years of married life.</p>
<p>Today, as always, I struggle to survive.</p>
<p>Miss Yena speaks with a smile.</p>
<p>“As expected, big sister-in-law’s skills are the best. This is your work, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>At her friendly words, I smile gently. “Does it suit your taste?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s exactly as expected from you,” then, turning to the head of the family, she said, “Grandfather, can’t I take my big sister-in-law with me? It’s a waste of talent if we just keep her at home. If she helps me, I’m sure our overseas expansion would be successful.”</p>
<p>Instinctively, I glance at Grandfather, hoping. Yena works in the overseas business department of the main office. Recently, she’s been handling a food business project.</p>
<p>At 26, she is already the department head and recognized for her abilities. She’s straightforward and has a charm that draws people in. She’s also the only person in this family who’s kind to me and the person I envy the most.</p>
<p>Grandfather remains silent. I hide my disappointment well. I can already feel my mother-in-law’s piercing glare on the top of my head.</p>
<p>“Who would prepare the meals if the eldest is not here? Yena, your big sister-in-law is indispensable to this household.”</p>
<p>Miss Yena smiles brightly and says,</p>
<p>“It’s not like her stepmom is holding her back, right? Big sister-in-law graduated top of her MBA class. It’s a national loss to waste such talent.”</p>
<p>At her words, my mother-in-law’s face turns icy. Forcing a smile, she says,</p>
<p>“What business does a woman have outside the home?”</p>
<p>“Second sister-in-law is allowed to work at the company.”</p>
<p>My mother-in-law’s face stiffens awkwardly. I bite my lip slightly. My younger sister-in-law, Chae-Ian, who has been married for two years, is the second daughter of Jae-an Group. She works not at MK but at Jaean Group.</p>
<p>It’s not okay for me to work, but nothing is said about my sister-in-law working at her family’s company.</p>
<p>In this household, I am almost an outsider. My family has no connections to the business or political worlds. My father, Lee Jincheol, is the president of Korea University, and my mother, Han Yesook, is a royal court cuisine instructor.</p>
<p>To outsiders, they may seem impressive, but to this family, my family is considered poor and insignificant.</p>
<p>I am always amazed and envious of Miss Yena’s boldness. She smiles and says everything she wants to my mother-in-law. After the accident that killed my uncle and aunt, Grandfather bequeathed part of their shares, as well as some of his own, to Miss Yena.</p>
<p>In this family, the major shareholders are Grandfather, my father-in-law, and Miss Yena. If Grandfather decides to pass his shares to his granddaughter, the position of the largest shareholder could change hands. That’s why even my mother-in-law can’t say anything.</p>
<p>“Your sister-in-law should stay at home.”</p>
<p>At the deep voice that followed, Miss Yena retreated with a smile.</p>
<p>“If my brother says so, it’s not my place to interfere. Alright, I’ll stop.”</p>
