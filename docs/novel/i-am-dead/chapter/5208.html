            <p><strong>Chapter 15</strong></p>
<p>The next day. In this household, breakfast doesn’t get delayed just because it’s the weekend. As expected, my husband didn’t come home last night. While eating breakfast at precisely 6 AM, I brought up the topic.</p>
<p>“I’m going out today.”</p>
<p>No one paid any attention to my words.</p>
<p>“Doha will come to pick me up.”</p>
<p>At that, my father-in-law cleared his throat, and my mother-in-law’s face turned pale. Then, my grandfather spoke.</p>
<p>“Since he’s coming, tell him to come inside and say his greetings.”</p>
<p>I was taken aback but responded calmly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandfather.”</p>
<p>Once my grandfather acknowledged it, my mother-in-law’s face stiffened, and I could see her trembling. I met her gaze and smiled brightly. Watching her inner turmoil was oddly satisfying.</p>
<p>Jang Doha arrived at our house at 11:50 AM, about ten minutes earlier than the agreed time. Upon hearing that his car had passed through the main gate, I went to the front door to wait for him. When the doorbell rang, and I opened the door, a large bouquet of flowers obstructed my view. I was flustered.</p>
<p>“I noticed last time that you seem to like flowers. I didn’t want to come empty-handed.”</p>
<p>Seeing my stiff face, he hastily explained. I smiled and let him in.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Please, come in.”</p>
<p>Once inside, he exchanged a polite nod with Housekeeper Ahn.</p>
<p>“Grandfather wants to see you,” I said.</p>
<p>He asked, “Yena, what did you tell them was the reason for my visit?”</p>
<p>Sensing his nervousness, I replied calmly.</p>
<p>“I told them we are seeing each other.”</p>
<p>His eyes widened.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I told them the truth—that we are seriously dating.”</p>
<p>I sensed someone hiding upstairs, eavesdropping on our conversation. It was probably my mother-in-law. He glanced at me and smiled.</p>
<p>“Of course. It’s time to tell them. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, he seemed perceptive. Relieved, I handed the bouquet to Housekeeper Ahn, and we headed to my grandfather’s room. I knocked gently on the door.</p>
<p>“Grandfather, it’s Yena.”</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>We entered together. Upon seeing Jang Doha, my grandfather smiled contentedly. Doha even bowed deeply to him.</p>
<p>“It’s a pleasure to formally meet you, Grandfather.”</p>
<p>He didn’t call him “Honorary Chairman.” He knelt respectfully but confidently in front of my grandfather, who observed him keenly.</p>
<p>“So, you’re dating our Yena?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“What do you think of her?”</p>
<p>“When my parents return, I plan to introduce her to them formally.”</p>
<p>From his demeanor, it was clear that he had grown up well-loved and educated in a healthy family. My grandfather smiled approvingly.</p>
<p>“Very well. Good luck to both of you. When a man and a woman date, mutual respect means fewer arguments.”</p>
<p>“I’ll keep that in mind, sir.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you to spend more time with an old man. You can go now.”</p>
<p>“I’ll visit again soon, sir.”</p>
<p>“We’ll be back, Grandfather.”</p>
<p>After leaving the room, I went to get my coat. The bouquet he brought was already in a vase, filling the room with a pleasant scent. He followed me into the room, looking somewhat awkward.</p>
<p>What’s gotten into him?</p>
<p>“I’ll just grab my coat. Feel free to make yourself comfortable.”</p>
<p>He said, scratching the back of his head. “It’s just… it’s my first time being in a girl’s room… Haha.”</p>
<p>I was genuinely surprised by his awkward laughter.</p>
<p>“Is this really your first time dating a girl?”</p>
<p>His face flushed. I couldn’t hear his mumbling well, so I asked again.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>He looked at me with a resentful expression and, with a red face, spoke again.</p>
<p>“I said, you’re my first. Yena.”</p>
<p>I was truly taken aback. That couldn’t be true. Hadn’t he lived in America, where people were basically free-spirited when it came to relationships?</p>
<p>“That’s a lie. You lived in America. You said you immigrated in middle school.”</p>
<p>He flared up.</p>
<p>“I’m not lying. Really, you’re the first girl I’ve dated, Yena.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“Not even when you were in school?”</p>
<p>“There were no other Asians where I lived until high school. It was hard enough to make friends with the guys, let alone dating girls….”</p>
<p>I asked the dejected him.</p>
<p>“You graduated from NYU, right? You didn’t date anyone there?”</p>
<p>“I was too busy founding Meat at that time to have time for dating. After graduation, I was too occupied with running the company. I’m really not lying. It’s the truth.”</p>
<p>His indignant pout was so cute.</p>
<p>“Since I haven’t dated anyone and only focused on work, my parents said they were coming over. What parents would meddle in their grown-up son’s dating life?”</p>
<p>I blinked. Was he a living treasure? He was either a fool or a workaholic. But didn’t he say he told his parents about me? It didn’t add up.</p>
<p>“Where did you get the courage to tell your parents about me, then?”</p>
<p>Jang Doha’s face and ears turned red. He avoided my gaze, looking suspicious.</p>
<p>“Mr. Jang.”</p>
<p>“Call me Doha. What if someone outside hears?”</p>
<p>“Did you know someone was listening on the stairs earlier?”</p>
<p>“As soon as I came in, someone hurriedly went up to the second floor. And I have enough sense for that.”</p>
<p>His pouty face and disappointed eyes were all so new to me. After living with a man who always scowled and hurled insults, seeing someone like him felt refreshing. I smiled and apologized.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I was just surprised. I never imagined someone like you, Doha, would be a ‘motae solo.’”</p>
<p>“Motae solo?”</p>
<p>“Someone who’s never dated since birth.”</p>
<p>He scowled. “Don’t tease me, okay?”</p>
<p>I held back my laughter and said,</p>
<p>“Alright, I won’t tease you. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know conversations could be enjoyable like this.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>I got into his car, buckled my seatbelt, and we left the house. As we passed the front gate and approached the site where the accident happened, I felt that familiar tightness again.</p>
<p>He must have seen me gripping the seatbelt with both hands because the next moment, he reached out his right hand to shield me. I turned to look at him, and I stared straight ahead. He spoke calmly.</p>
<p>“It’s going to last a long time. The trauma.”</p>
<p>“How did you know?”</p>
<p>“I actually came to the accident site right after I returned to Korea.”</p>
<p>“Here? Why?”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to see if there was anything to note.”</p>
<p>“But why did you think that way?”</p>
<p>“This is the road to your house, Yena. It’s understandable for cars to pass by, but it felt strange for a construction dump truck to be here at that time.”</p>
<p>He looked like a completely different person, cold and analytical compared to the gentle, dog-like smile he usually had. And he had reached out to protect me. I felt my ears getting hot as I turned my head.</p>
<p>“They must have done a thorough investigation. After all, my sister-in-law died. But they said there was nothing except for the drunk driving.”</p>
<p>“Did you investigate the driver?”</p>
<p>“No. If he was drunk, what is there to investigate? But why do you ask?”</p>
<p>He turned his head and smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“My hobby is reading mystery thrillers. Even in the most ordinary cases, there’s always a conspiracy.”</p>
<p>I finally laughed. I had been momentarily tense, thinking there really might be something. Thanks to him, I was able to pass the intersection without any trouble.</p>
<p>“Your hobby is reading?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. I read all genres.”</p>
<p>“You must read a lot.”</p>
<p>“I do. What’s your hobby, Yena?”</p>
<p>Miss Yena’s hobby? Or my hobby?</p>
<p>“I solve math problems.”</p>
<p>He was truly surprised.</p>
<p>“Math? The math we know?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but laugh a second time.</p>
<p>“Yes. When I solve math problems, I can really focus. I feel a significant sense of accomplishment after solving them.”</p>
<p>He looked at me with a twinkle in his eyes and exclaimed, “Wow. It’s the first time I’ve met someone who solves math problems as a hobby.”</p>
<p>My smile was faint. No one knows that I solve math problems. Only I, Buyeon, know this. It was a hobby I started doing after 10 years of suffering—otherwise, I would have died from the mental agony.</p>
<p>I tried to change the subject, asking cheerfully, “Do you have any other hobbies?”</p>
<p>“I like basketball. I jog every morning.”</p>
<p>“You like physical activities, mental activities, and you’re good-looking too. Why can’t you get a girlfriend?”</p>
<p>I wondered if I sounded older, and as expected, he looked at me curiously.</p>
<p>“You sounded just like my grandma. Did you know that?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but giggle.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I feel like an old person. I guess it’s because I’m close to my grandfather.”</p>
<p>“Of course, it’s hard not to be influenced. But did you really think that about me?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You just said it. I’m good at physical and mental activities—and good-looking. That means you think I’m handsome, right?”</p>
<p>The car stopped at a traffic light. He turned his head and looked at me with a deep gaze. I was suddenly flustered.</p>
<p>Why did he have to look at me like that? Can’t you revert back to your puppy gaze? I dislike romance. I’ve had enough of it.</p>
<p>Still, my heart trembled for a moment under his unwavering gaze.</p>
