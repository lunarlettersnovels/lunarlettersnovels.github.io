            <p><strong>Chapter 11.1</strong></p>
<p>As soon as I entered the hospital room, Housekeeper Ahn hurried toward me.</p>
<p>“Are you having a hard time?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine. I just went to my house and back,” I replied, reassuring the old housekeeper.</p>
<p>“You went back home?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I stopped by to check if my grandfather had eaten, but he hadn’t.”</p>
<p>“That’s serious… He hasn’t been eating at all…”</p>
<p>“I made him some milk porridge, and he ate it.”</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn looked surprised. “Who made the milk porridge? Surely not you?”</p>
<p>“Why not? I know how to make it. I learned from my sister.”</p>
<p>“You learned from Madam? When?”</p>
<p>“My sister used to come over to run errands for me sometimes. I learned then.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know…”</p>
<p>“Of course, you didn’t. She didn’t want to tell anyone.”</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn seemed to accept my explanation as I smiled. She glanced at the bag I was holding.</p>
<p>“You can give me the bag, please.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay.”</p>
<p>I needed to store the documents inside somewhere safe, but I hadn’t decided where yet. Should I keep them in the bank?</p>
<p>“President Jang is bringing takeout for dinner. You should go out and have something nice, too.”</p>
<p>She gave me a peculiar smile, making me feel a bit guilty.</p>
<p>“It’s not like that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. I know.”</p>
<p>“Really, it’s not.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I understand. When is he coming?”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t it take time to cook a steak?”</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn was startled by my words.</p>
<p>“You’re going to eat steak?”</p>
<p>I understood his surprise. Miss Yena used to avoid meat, sticking to small portions of vegetarian meals unless it was Korean food.</p>
<p>“Since the accident, my taste seems to have changed. I want to try it.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. Madam tried so hard to get you to eat meat…”</p>
<p>I felt distressed at the mention of Miss Yena’s past self. Probably the reason she didn’t eat meat was because of her illness. But now that her body fully recovered, there’s no reason I can’t eat it.</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn left to have dinner, and soon after, President Jang arrived. He was carrying a paper bag with the logo of a well-known hotel. As he walked in, despite it being autumn, it felt like he brought spring with him, brimming with energy.</p>
<p>“Did you wait long?”</p>
<p>“No. Come on in.”</p>
<p>I greeted him without changing into my hospital gown, still wearing my dress. He smiled when he saw me.</p>
<p>“You definitely look better in everyday clothes than in a hospital gown.”</p>
<p>“Who looks good in a hospital gown?”</p>
<p>He flinched at my words and smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p>“I misspoke.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. The takeout…”</p>
<p>“Oh! Here it is.”</p>
<p>He pulled the packaged container out of the paper bag and placed it on the table, looking both excited and a bit giddy. I watched him calmly. Jang Doha didn’t seem like someone I needed to be wary of. However, he had feelings for Miss Yena, and I still couldn’t figure out how to handle that.</p>
<p>When he opened the lid, a delicious aroma wafted out. The reddish meat looked mouthwatering. He handed me a fork and knife wrapped in a table napkin.</p>
<p>“Do they give out cutlery with takeout these days?”</p>
<p>“No, I asked for it. I wanted you to have something nicer. Eating with plastic isn’t great. I also brought dessert. Do you like pudding?”</p>
<p>Unlike Miss Yena, I eat almost anything.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>His smile was bright, and when his lips were upturned, there wasn’t any crease at all. On the contrary, I rarely showed my emotions. Before marriage, I used to smile often, too. However, ten years of married life had changed me.</p>
<p>Bringing my mind back to the present, I took a bite, and the meat melted in my mouth with its tender, flavorful goodness.</p>
<p>“It’s good.”</p>
<p>“This place is famous for its steak.”</p>
<p>“It’s decent. Thanks for the meal.”</p>
<p>I was really craving meat, so I ate with enthusiasm. Sensing his intense gaze, I glanced up to find him observing me closely.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“It’s the first time I’ve seen you eat so well, Yena. I didn’t know you ate meat.”</p>
<p>His observation caught me off guard. Though surprised, I maintained my composure.</p>
<p>“I do eat meat. I’m just very hungry right now.”</p>
<p>He narrowed his eyes. “Did you ask me to come just because you wanted to eat meat?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>I was taken aback by his question. I hadn’t expected him to think that. He chuckled heartily.</p>
<p>“Even if that’s the case, it’s fine. I didn’t want to dine alone either. Eat up.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t the type to rush through a meal; instead, he savored each bite. Thanks to him, my appetite returned in full force. Soon, my plate lay empty before me.</p>
