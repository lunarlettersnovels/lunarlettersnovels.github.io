            <p><strong>Chapter 14.2</strong></p>
<p>My father-in-law’s eyebrows shot up.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I thought I only needed Grandfather’s permission. Isn’t cousin Taejun’s marriage more urgent than mine?”</p>
<p>He glared at me with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“Who is he?”</p>
<p>“Uncle knows him too. President Jang Doha.”</p>
<p>I deliberately spoke calmly and composedly. His eyes narrowed even further, and my heart pounded.</p>
<p>“Jang Doha?”</p>
<p>“Yes. His parents are coming soon, and I’ve arranged for us to meet them. Grandfather has given his permission, too.”</p>
<p>“You want to choose a guy with nothing but brains?”</p>
<p>I widened my eyes and spoke.</p>
<p>“Nothing but brains? MK’s market capitalization is lower than Meat’s, which he runs. Besides, Grandfather scouted him personally due to our declining sales, which have now started to rise thanks to President Jang’s hard work.”</p>
<p>I subtly hinted at my husband’s incompetence. His failures had driven Grandfather to bring in Jang Doha, making him a thorn in my father-in-law’s side.</p>
<p>My father-in-law clenched his fist on the armrest. However, his face was impassive.</p>
<p>“Get out.”</p>
<p>I nodded slightly and left the study. As I closed the door, I heard something fall with a thud inside. I turned around and saw my mother-in-law standing with her arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Did you have a good talk with your uncle?”</p>
<p>I smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Aunt. I’ll be bringing President Jang Doha over soon.”</p>
<p>“What? Who?”</p>
<p>Seeing my mother-in-law’s face twist was thrilling.</p>
<p>“The person I’m seeing, President Jang Doha. I’ve informed Uncle as well. Goodbye.”</p>
<p>I nodded slightly and turned to leave, hearing a faint scream from my mother-in-law. She then entered the study, and their muffled voices became indistinct.</p>
<p>While I felt a sense of satisfaction, many thoughts crowded my mind. I had assumed Miss Yena in our family spoke her mind freely. But observing their reactions today, I realized she wasn’t free from pressure either.</p>
<p>Moreover, my father-in-law’s attitude toward her… it wasn’t how one treats a niece. That look in his eyes… it was clear hostility. The only reason for his animosity towards her could be the shares. The thought gave me chills.</p>
<p>As I descended to the first floor, I heard footsteps behind me on the stairs. It was my husband. Dressed up and humming, he was clearly on his way to see his mistress.</p>
<p>“What were you doing on the second floor?”</p>
<p>“And where are you going this late at night? Off to somewhere nice?”</p>
<p>“None of your business.”</p>
<p>He descended the stairs and went out the front door. I already receive reports on his movements. What irks me is his complete lack of basic decency toward his deceased wife. But well, what could I expect from a scum like him?</p>
<p>As much as I want to kill him right now, there’s a time for everything. Besides, I don’t have the luxury of mercy to kill him easily.</p>
<p>I entered my room and sat on the edge of the bed, letting out a sigh. The weight of everything that happened today slowly settled in. So much had happened in just one day.</p>
<p>What should I tell President Jang? This is a big problem. No matter how much I think about it, there’s no way to backtrack now that I’ve mentioned Jang Doha. Meeting the prosecutor my father-in-law suggested is something I can’t even consider.</p>
<p>“Should I just be honest and ask for his help?”</p>
<p>He needs a girlfriend to reassure his parents, and I need someone to get me out of this marriage pressure. If I’m asked to bring him immediately, it’ll be difficult. I decided to call him.</p>
<p>[Yes, Yena?]</p>
<p>His voice was bright and cheerful.</p>
<p>“Am I bothering you?”</p>
<p>[No, I was just thinking about you. It’s like telepathy. I was surprised to see your name on the screen.]</p>
<p>His tone was lively and a bit chatty.</p>
<p>“Is something up?”</p>
<p>[Well, I need to convince you somehow. My mother called a little while ago, excited about meeting her son’s girlfriend. Yena, can you please help me out? Can’t you think of it as saving my life?]</p>
<p>I was honestly relieved. I had worried about what I’d do if he had given up after my rejection.</p>
<p>“Can we meet tomorrow? Are you free?”</p>
<p>[Yes, I’m free. Even if I wasn’t, I’d make time for you, Yena.]</p>
<p>I paused. His cheerful voice almost made me smile. When we arranged the time and place, he insisted on picking me up from home. I didn’t refuse. It would be perfect for appearances if he picked me up. After ending the call, I felt a bit more at ease.</p>
<p>With him being so cooperative, it would be easier to bring this up. We could pretend to be a couple for a while, and once things settle, we can naturally say we broke up. I did sense that he liked Miss Yena, which made me uneasy, but it’s something that can be dealt with.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t keep pursuing her if she’s not interested. I comforted myself with that thought.</p>
