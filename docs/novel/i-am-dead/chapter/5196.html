            <h3>Chapter 27</h3>
<p>I applied heavier makeup than usual to conceal my tired and rough face, then made my way to my grandfather’s room to escort him. Standing outside the door, I took a deep breath, counting silently—one, two, three—before knocking.</p>
<p>“Grandfather.”</p>
<p>He looked surprised when he saw me.</p>
<p>“Your makeup is heavier today.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I decided to go a bit stronger today. Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>He studied me quietly for a moment before nodding.</p>
<p>“Yesterday must have been difficult for you.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Did the ancestral rites finish smoothly?”</p>
<p>“Although it ran a bit late, it was completed.”</p>
<p>It seemed that in the end, my stepmother had been forced to prepare the food.</p>
<p>“Are you planning to send her away today?”</p>
<p>“What do you think should be done?”</p>
<p>“If rumors spread, it might look like a conflict between you and Uncle.”</p>
<p>My grandfather chuckled softly.</p>
<p>“You’ve started considering even those things. You’ve grown.”</p>
<p>“I had to grow.”</p>
<p>I remained calm and composed—too calm, perhaps. But with the goal I now had in mind, I needed to change. If I continued thinking simply, I would surely be destroyed.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>I escorted my grandfather to the dining room, where the people who wore the mask of family—yet were my tormentors—stood as we entered. I glanced at each of their faces. My father-in-law remained unreadable, as always. My stepmother kept a close eye on my grandfather, nervous. Namgung Muyeol appeared as carefree as ever, and my two younger brothers-in-law were bright and cheerful. Not one of these people was innocent in their abuse of my cousin.</p>
<p>Once we were seated, my grandfather spoke.</p>
<p>“Daughter.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Father.”</p>
<p>“Our family’s foundation is built on ancestral rites. If you can’t handle that, you should step down as the mistress of this house and leave.”</p>
<p>“No, Father. I apologize. I won’t let something like yesterday happen again.”</p>
<p>Mother-in law spoke humbly. I focused my attention on my father-in-law, the most dangerous one in the room. I needed to tread carefully and prepare thoroughly. This wasn’t just some petty family dispute over control—it was a war that could cost me my life.</p>
<p>Lowering my gaze, I began to eat. My mouth was dry, and I didn’t feel like eating, but I forced myself to. I had to start building up this body’s strength. With the current physical state I was in, I wouldn’t be able to achieve anything.</p>
<p>Slowly, deliberately, I chewed every bite, finishing my meal. By the time I was done, I was slightly out of breath, but I endured it. My stepmother seemed eager to start an argument, her lips twitching as if to speak, but perhaps she had enough sense to hold her tongue.</p>
<p>Once I finished, I stood up.</p>
<p>“I’ll be leaving first.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Take care.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandfather.”</p>
<p>I also bowed politely to my father-in-law before leaving the dining room. Then, I went to find Housekeeper Ahn.</p>
<p>“Housekeeper Ahn, do you have any digestive medicine?”</p>
<p>“Is your stomach bothering you?”</p>
<p>“A little.”</p>
<p>“Just a moment.”</p>
<p>As I took the medicine she handed me, I watched her carefully. Sensing my gaze, she asked with concern, “Should I get you a hand warmer? Are you feeling that uncomfortable?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You don’t look well.”</p>
<p>“Housekeeper Ahn.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>She was visibly surprised, but then gave me a gentle smile. I stood up and, as I headed toward the kitchen door, I added, “I’ll be late today. Don’t prepare dinner for me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, young miss.”</p>
<p>Housekeeper Ahn was the only person in this house, apart from my grandfather, who had shown me warmth and care. To the late young mistress, she was like a mother. Thank you, Housekeeper Ahn.</p>
<p>I returned to my room and waited until 7 a.m. The young lady’s diaries were all packed in my bag, and I planned to store them securely in the safe. Ten minutes before the hour, I left my room and headed toward the front door. As I stepped outside, I saw Jang Doha waiting with a smile.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Yena.”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Doha.”</p>
<p>He approached but then paused, a hint of surprise crossing his face.</p>
<p>“Your makeup today…”</p>
<p>“It’s heavy, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“Let’s get in the car first.”</p>
<p>Once he sat behind the wheel, he glanced at me, curiosity and concern evident in his eyes. I spoke first.</p>
<p>“Is it alright if I’m a little late to work today?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Then, can we go somewhere quiet to talk?”</p>
<p>He looked at me steadily before starting the car. We didn’t say a word as we passed through the front gates and drove to a quiet spot. When he finally turned off the engine, he asked, “Tell me.”</p>
<p>I had thought about this all morning. It was time to make a deal with him. Right now, Jang Doha was the only person I could ask for help.</p>
<p>“Are you planning to return to the U.S. when your contract ends?” I asked, my voice steady.</p>
<p>“I haven’t decided yet,” he replied, watching me intently.</p>
<p>“You must have a lot of money, right? Maybe even more than my grandfather… if you didn’t donate so much.”</p>
<p>“Do you need money?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a lot. Will you help me?”</p>
<p>My voice was calm, my gaze steady. This wasn’t how the young lady usually spoke to him. I could see his expression harden, sensing the weight of my words.</p>
<p>“Let’s hear it then. Why does Yena, one of MK’s largest shareholders, need money?”</p>
<p>“I need to become the head of the company. But I can’t do it on my own.”</p>
<p>Jang Doha listened carefully, not interrupting.</p>
<p>“If I start buying up shares, it’ll get reported right away. The same goes for my grandfather,” I said.</p>
<p>“So, you want me to secure shares for you?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I looked at him unwaveringly. “I want to use you, Doha.”</p>
<p>His eyes darkened. He knew I wasn’t joking.</p>
<p>“Do you really think you can become the head?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But only if you help. They can’t know you’re the one buying the shares.”</p>
<p>“That part is easy. What I want to know is, why did you suddenly make this decision?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to take down Chairman Namgung.”</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“Does the Honorary Chairman know?”</p>
<p>“I’ve already told him. He said he’d prepare, but he’s old. I don’t want to involve him any further.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t risk putting my grandfather in danger.</p>
<p>“Even if I help, it’s not just about shares. Running a company takes more than ownership.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I need you by my side, Doha. Don’t go back to the U.S. Stay with me.”</p>
<p>He remained silent for a moment.</p>
<p>“Alright. I’ll think about it.”</p>
<p>Then, with a sudden smile, he added, “By the way, heavy makeup doesn’t suit you. If you want to fight a war, prepare without standing out. Smile like you used to. Let them underestimate you. Blend in. Do you understand what I mean?”</p>
<p>I nodded. I understood perfectly.</p>
<p>“You’re saying not to make them feel threatened?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Don’t stir the bushes unnecessarily. Keeping them unaware until we cross the forest is a strategy in itself.”</p>
<p>“I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“Good. Now, shall we go? How about stopping by the first floor for a smoothie before heading up? It’ll look good for people to see the CEO and Director laughing together, acting casual. The more rumors about us dating and slacking off, the better.”</p>
<p>He winked playfully before starting the car. After a moment, he casually asked, “You know Director Kwon Sung-il, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course. He’s one of my grandfather’s closest aides.”</p>
<p>“Well, he’s been quietly buying up shares recently. I don’t think the chairman knows yet. He’s disguising the purchases as small individual investors through a few layers of proxies. It’s likely on orders from the Honorary Chairman.”</p>
<p>I was shocked. Even I hadn’t been informed of that.</p>
<p>“How do you know…?”</p>
<p>He glanced at me with a grin before responding, “You still have a lot to learn about this world, Yena. If you want, I could give you private lessons.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“But I don’t come cheap. Remember, I’m very expensive… especially if I decide to help.”</p>
<p>I was taken aback. What is this man playing at?</p>
<p>When we arrived at the company, we intentionally stopped at the first-floor café, drinking smoothies and laughing loudly. It was meant to be a performance, but as I listened to his story about fighting off a bear at the Grand Canyon, I found myself genuinely entertained.</p>
<p>“Ehh, don’t exaggerate! You almost had me believing it was true.” I chuckled, the tension easing for the first time all day.</p>
<p>His eyes widened dramatically as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, it’s true! A black bear this big came right at me.”</p>
<p>“But wasn’t it winter? Don’t bears hibernate?”</p>
<p>He pounded his chest for emphasis. “I’m not lying, I swear.”</p>
<p>“So, you fought off a hungry black bear?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he jumped up, spreading his arms wide and letting out a loud roar. He started stomping from side to side, shouting so loudly that not only did everyone in the café turn to stare, but even people passing by in the lobby paused to look. My face turned crimson.</p>
<p>“Doha!” I hissed.</p>
<p>“I was even wearing a puffy jacket! I made myself look bigger, yelled at the top of my lungs, and the bear ran away.”</p>
<p>“Fine, I believe you! Please, just sit down….”</p>
<p>“Do you really believe me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I believe you. Now sit, please.”</p>
<p>Seeing my flustered face, he grinned and finally sat down. I covered my face with my hands and lowered my head.</p>
<p>“Embarrassed?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly….”</p>
<p>He burst out laughing, clutching his stomach. “Alright, let’s head up now.”</p>
<p>He extended his hand. I gave it a wary look before standing, but just as I did, he interlaced his fingers with mine.</p>
<p>“Doha!”</p>
<p>I glanced around nervously, but his soft voice cut through the moment.</p>
<p>“From today, we’re going to be that annoyingly affectionate couple who can’t hide their love.”</p>
<p>I looked up at him in surprise. His eyes sparkled, and a tender smile played on his lips. Even though I knew it was all part of his playful act, my heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>“Good,” he continued. “From now on, when we’re at work, I want you to look at me like that.”</p>
<p>With my hand still in his, he led me out of the café and through the lobby. I could feel the stares from the other employees, and my cheeks burned under the attention. But more than that, it was the warmth from his hand that sent heat rushing to my heart, spreading like wildfire.</p>
<p>Even in the elevator, he didn’t let go of my hand. As more employees stepped in, they noticed us and quickly turned away, pretending not to see. But I caught their small, knowing smiles.</p>
<p>By noon, our little act would be all over the company. If that was his goal, he had succeeded brilliantly.</p>
