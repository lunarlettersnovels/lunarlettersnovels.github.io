            <p><strong>Chapter 8.2</strong></p>
<p>I glanced at him and said, “You’re wondering why I asked for this, right?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I honestly don’t understand,” he replied.</p>
<p>“Chief Jeon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been diagnosed with dissociative amnesia due to the recent accident.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>He looked utterly shocked.</p>
<p>“I can’t even remember the combination to the safe I used. The only things I can recall are related to my family. They say I suffered from amnesia and aphasia after my parents’ accident when I was young, too.”</p>
<p>Chief Jeon’s eyes shifted from suspicion to sympathy as he looked at me.</p>
<p>“Of course, this information is confidential. No one else should know.”</p>
<p>“Understood. But does the Honorary Chairman…?”</p>
<p>“He knows. I heard Director Han visited the house.”</p>
<p>“So, aside from your family, you remember nothing?”</p>
<p>“Yes. This is a bigger reason than just figuring out who is friend or foe.”</p>
<p>“I excluded distant friends and focused on those you occasionally contacted.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I have any close friends?”</p>
<p>Chief Jeon seemed to believe my claim of amnesia.</p>
<p>“Although it might seem like you had many friends, in reality, you kept no one close. You didn’t attend alumni gatherings either.”</p>
<p>“Chief Jeon, you were with me when I studied abroad, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Even then, you had no close friends.”</p>
<p>This was the real side of Miss Yena who always appeared friendly with everyone… Even after living with her for ten years, I was fooled. Perhaps her battle with Lou Gehrig’s disease made her this way.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Did you visit Sir Sung?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I paid the full hospital bill and gave him one hundred million won.”</p>
<p>“Give him another two hundred million.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>He looked genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>“He has served our family all his life. He deserves at least that much in compensation.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>“There is one more person I’m curious about.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“CEO Jang Doha.”</p>
<p>He looked flustered.</p>
<p>“Do you not remember him either?”</p>
<p>“He seemed very friendly with me. I didn’t recognize him at first.”</p>
<p>“Ah… I see…”</p>
<p>He looked uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“You’ve been with me, so you might know something about him, right?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“You need to tell me so I don’t make any mistakes.”</p>
<p>After hesitating, he spoke.</p>
<p>“I don’t know about his behavior in the company, but whenever I was with you, he often called.”</p>
<p>That was enough for now.</p>
<p>“Please investigate CEO Jang. Check if he has any connections with my uncle or my older brother Muyeol.”</p>
<p>“Are you suspicious? CEO Jang was personally scouted by the Honorary Chairman.”</p>
<p>“Even a stone bridge must be tapped before crossing. We can’t know what’s inside unless we check.”</p>
<p>I decided to consider everyone around me as a potential threat. Now, I had to confront and find out myself.</p>
<p>“Oh, and how is the investigation you mentioned progressing?”</p>
<p>“We found out that the person we couldn’t locate was abroad after being released from prison. We recently discovered his entry and exit records. He is very cautious and doesn’t use cards.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lose him.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>I was curious about who he was. If he had been chased for twenty years, he must be significant, possibly linked to the accident that killed my uncle and aunt. Grandfather wouldn’t have ordered a twenty-year search without a critical reason.</p>
<p>“I’m planning to go out later. Will you accompany me?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“I intend to visit my sister-in-law’s parents. But first, I need to withdraw some money. Cash, preferably.”</p>
<p>“How much do you need?”</p>
<p>I decided to test the waters. I needed the money, but I also wanted to see how far Miss Yena’s financial power extended.</p>
<p>“One billion won?”</p>
<p>“I’ll prepare it.”</p>
<p>I was astonished. Despite being the daughter of a wealthy family, it was surprising that I could arrange a billion won with just a word. There was a striking difference between my world and hers—other than living expenses and allowance from Grandfather, I had no money.</p>
<p>After Chief Jeon left, I memorized the tablet’s contents thoroughly. By the time Housekeeper Ahn arrived, I had it all memorized.</p>
<p>“I’m back, Miss.”</p>
<p>“Did you bring the clothes?”</p>
<p>“Yes, here they are.”</p>
<p>When she opened the suitcase, there was a sky-blue Dior dress and a coat. I paused and glanced at it.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t there anything in a more… subdued color?”</p>
<p>“This was the most modest one… Miss…”</p>
<p>I pretended not to notice Housekeeper Ahn’s gaze. I had forgotten Miss Yena’s flashy fashion sense. At least it wasn’t pink. I changed into the dress. Thankfully, it fit well.</p>
