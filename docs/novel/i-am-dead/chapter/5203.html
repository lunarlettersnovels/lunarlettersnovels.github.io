            <p><strong>Chapter 20</strong></p>
<p>The employees who overheard their conversation began to gossip.</p>
<p>“Did the President really hit our Executive Director?”</p>
<p>“But why would the President hit the Executive Director?”</p>
<p>At that moment, President Jang boldly declared, “Director Namgung Yena, Head of the Department, before she’s your cousin, she’s my woman. Know your place, and don’t overstep. There won’t be a next time.”</p>
<p>After saying all he wanted, he marched into his office, leaving only my husband standing there. Realizing that all the employees had come out to watch, the idiot suddenly screamed,</p>
<p>“What are you looking at? Get back to work!”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but laugh at his reaction. On one hand, I felt reassured, but I was also surprised by President Jang’s audacity to announce our relationship publicly.</p>
<p>With this incident, he had achieved two things: first, he’d declared war on my husband, and second, he’d officially revealed our relationship. This news would spread through the company in no time.</p>
<p>I had a feeling the days ahead would be exhausting, but at the same time, I felt an immense relief. It was exhilarating and refreshing like never before.</p>
<p>As I closed the office door, Assistant Manager Jang Heejin cautiously asked,</p>
<p>“Director, are you dating the President?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I replied briefly.</p>
<p>Some employees looked at me with envy, while others offered their congratulations.</p>
<p>“President Jang is really impressive. You two make a great couple.”</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Director.”</p>
<p>I smiled and said, “Thank you. Now, shall we head to the meeting?”</p>
<p>On my first day back at work, I became an official office couple.</p>
<p>The first meeting began. For now, I listened to the employees’ reports and refrained from giving any opinions. I needed to understand the situation. Just listening to the meeting itself was already helpful. I wrapped up the meeting, feeling satisfied.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s end the meeting here today.”</p>
<p>As I was leaving the conference room and heading to my office, someone called out to me from behind.</p>
<p>“Director.”</p>
<p>I turned around to see it was Jeong Han-il.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“There’s something I need to discuss with you.”</p>
<p>I invited him into my office. Sitting in front of my desk, Team Leader Jeong began to speak.</p>
<p>“The project you’ve been working on. May I take it over?”</p>
<p>“You, Team Leader Jeong?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve come up with some good ideas. Would you take a look?”</p>
<p>He handed me a file—a report on an overseas restaurant business. Without even looking at it, I asked, “I’ve already told President Jang that I’m continuing with that project. Didn’t you hear?”</p>
<p>“I did, but I have some great ideas, and frankly, I’m eager to take it on.”</p>
<p>“But don’t you already have a project in progress?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s true, but…”</p>
<p>I smiled and said, “You can’t handle two projects at once. You’ll have to choose one, and I already have plans for this project. Please focus on finishing your current work.”</p>
<p>At my words, his face awkwardly stiffened. I was sure my husband had instructed him to steal the project from me, which is why he was so desperate.</p>
<p>Namgung Muyeol, I’m not going to play by your rules. If you want a war, come at me fair and square. Stop pulling strings from the shadows. I smiled as I saw Team Leader Jeong out.</p>
<p>As I was reviewing the documents, the image of my husband getting hit suddenly came to mind. I started to laugh. It was so satisfying. At first, I just intended to smile, but the laughter kept bubbling up.</p>
<p>“Hahaha.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t stop myself from laughing out loud. I laughed so hard that tears welled up in my eyes. It felt incredibly cathartic. After ten years of being hit, seeing him get knocked down so easily was priceless. Watching him fall, despite his size, was like finally getting rid of a ten-year-old burden.</p>
<p>I picked up my phone and sent a Kakao message.</p>
<p>[How did you even think to hit him?]</p>
<p>A reply came shortly after.</p>
<p>[He deserved it, so I hit him. From now on, don’t suffer in silence. Just tell me right away.]</p>
<p>[And then you’ll hit him again?]</p>
<p>[Next time, I’ll hit him hard enough to knock him out.]</p>
<p>I giggled.</p>
<p>[But what should we do? The rumor about us dating must have spread by now.]</p>
<p>[Let them talk. I’m not scared. Besides, the rumors will keep you from trying to run away from me.]</p>
<p>Wow! The way this man thinks is truly something else.</p>
<p>[Two birds with one stone?]</p>
<p>[Three birds. I won your heart too, didn’t I? You’ve fallen for me all over again, right?]</p>
<p>Instead of answering, I closed the chat. But I didn’t feel annoyed. I couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>Before lunch, my mother came to the office. I went down to the lobby to meet her and saw her dressed in a beautiful hanbok. For a moment, I almost called out, “Mom.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Han,” I greeted instead.</p>
<p>She turned to look at me, and she seemed a bit better than before, though she hadn’t completely returned to her usual self.</p>
<p>“Ms. Namgung,” she replied.</p>
<p>“Was the trip here comfortable?”</p>
<p>“Yes, thanks to the car you sent.”</p>
<p>“Please come upstairs.”</p>
<p>It had been a long time since I’d seen my mother outside the house. I felt a bit excited. As we waited for the elevator, I asked, “You haven’t had lunch yet, have you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You haven’t been skipping meals, right?”</p>
<p>She gave a faint smile. “You said you’d call and check on me if I didn’t eat. So I’ve been eating.”</p>
<p>“How’s my father-in-law?”</p>
<p>“This morning, a man named Mr. Jeon Boseok came by. He said you sent him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’ll be helping with the groundwork for the camp setup for a while. But of course, your husband will need to make the final decisions on staffing. I’ll also drop by whenever I can.”</p>
<p>“You really don’t have to go that far.”</p>
<p>“This is something I want to do. Besides, Grandfather asked me to help.”</p>
<p>“I need to thank the Honorary Chairman as well… I can’t tell you how grateful I am that he stayed by Buyeon’s side throughout the funeral.”</p>
<p>“I’ll arrange a time for you to visit him.”</p>
<p>The elevator doors opened, and I hesitated as I was about to step in. Inside was that man. Namgung Muyeol, my husband. He looked startled when he saw my mother.</p>
<p>“Mother-in-law….”</p>
<p>Her face stiffened. For a moment, I considered waiting for the next elevator, but I stepped in with her. There was no reason for us to avoid him. Inwardly, I hoped my mother would stand her ground against him.</p>
<p>“What brings you here?” he asked.</p>
<p>I looked at his lips and smiled meaningfully. They were more busted up than mine, and there was even a bruise forming on his chin. My mother’s voice was soft, but her eyes were icy as she responded.</p>
<p>“I’m here to meet with Ms. Yena. But what happened to your face? Did someone hit you?”</p>
<p>His face twisted in discomfort. Covering his mouth with his hand, he answered, “No, I just bumped into a car door while parking.”</p>
<p>Then he shot me a warning look, silently telling me not to say anything foolish. I, of course, feigned ignorance and said, “Oh, so it wasn’t because President Jang hit you earlier? You really just bumped into a car door?”</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth. My mother curiously asked, “You were hit?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that….”</p>
<p>I cut him off.</p>
<p>“President Jang Doha, whom you’ll be meeting soon, hit him—right in front of all the employees.”</p>
<p>His face turned red with embarrassment. My mother asked, puzzled, “Why?”</p>
<p>“Because my brother hit me yesterday. President Jang and I are in a relationship, and he couldn’t stand it, so he took revenge for me.”</p>
<p>I explained it very gently and kindly, but I didn’t mention that Jung Jinyoung had come by. My mother’s face hardened, and she looked at him with cold, contemptuous eyes.</p>
<p>Unable to endure it, Namgung Muyeol pressed the button for the next floor, bowed his head slightly, and got off the elevator. Once we were alone, my mother asked,</p>
<p>“May I ask why your brother hit you?”</p>
<p>“There were some circumstances. We’ll be running into each other often from now on. I’d appreciate it if you could avoid acknowledging him. It won’t be good for you.”</p>
<p>“Honestly, I was worried about that on the way here. I really don’t want to run into him.”</p>
<p>“If you do, just stand your ground. My brother’s the type who’s strong against the weak and weak against the strong.”</p>
<p>“Weak against the strong?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s only tough on those he thinks are beneath him.”</p>
<p>I escorted my mother to the floor where the International Business Department was located, and we headed straight to the President’s office. After knocking, we entered, and President Jang stood up from his chair and approached us.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Mrs. Han Yesuk. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Jang Doha, President of MK.”</p>
<p>He greeted her politely. My mother responded just as formally.</p>
<p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Han Yesuk.”</p>
<p>“Please, have a seat.”</p>
<p>We sat down on the sofa. President Jang asked, “I’ve prepared sikhye*, as I heard you enjoy it. Would you like some?”</p>
<p>*Sikhye (rice punch) is a traditional sweet Korean drink made of fermented malt and rice.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Honestly, I was surprised. He had researched my mother, learned her preferences, and made sure to cater to them. It was a small gesture, but it was meticulous and showed his consideration for her.</p>
<p>Three cups of sikhye were placed on the table. The round cups had floating pine nuts and jujubes, but no egg yolk. The aroma was pleasant. I watched as my mother tasted it. Her palate is even more discerning than mine.</p>
<p>“This is sikhye from Dawon, near Gyeongbokgung Palace, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>President Jang was taken aback.</p>
<p>“How did you know?”</p>
<p>“There aren’t many places in Seoul that serve authentic sikhye. Plus, it has that unique flavor that only that place offers.”</p>
<p>He glanced at me for a moment.</p>
<p>“Director Namgung is the same way. She can tell not only the ingredients but also whether something is store-bought or handmade just by tasting it. It’s an honor to meet another person with such a keen palate.”</p>
<p>My mother looked at me, and suddenly, I felt a tightness in my chest, and cold sweat ran down my back. This was bad.</p>
