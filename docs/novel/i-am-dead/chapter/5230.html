            <p><strong>Chapter 4.1</strong></p>
<p>It rained on the day of the funeral—quite a lot of downpour for autumn. Whether it was for Miss Yena or for me, I wasn’t sure, but I chose to think that the heavens were mourning her death.</p>
<p>I felt sorry, endlessly sorry, but it made my resolve to survive even stronger.</p>
<p>I decided to make Miss Yena the next head. Although my father-in-law is still alive, it wasn’t impossible if Miss Yena’s shares and abilities were recognized. My grandfather’s will was also crucial, and using the information I had and Miss Yena’s skills, it was possible.</p>
<p>The cremation began. Watching the coffin enter the wavering flames was distressing. It was clearly my body burning inside, but I can’t say the same for the soul.</p>
<p>Had our souls switched? Did God make this choice out of pity for my life, or was it simply a mistake? Experiencing something beyond scientific explanation made me believe in God’s existence for the first time.</p>
<p>As I waited for the cremation to end, I carefully observed my husband and mother-in-law. She wore black, but it was a designer dress adorned with eye-catching jewelry.</p>
<p>Whoever that that was an appropriate attire for her daughter-in-law’s funeral? Moreover, there was a faint smile on her lips.</p>
<p>Disgusting.</p>
<p>My husband didn’t leave immediately. He was probably on a call with his mistress. There was my father-in-law, who became chairman after my great uncle’s accident, and my father-in-law’s cherished first son, Namgung Muyeol.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t give them anything. Bored, the family members went outside. Only my parents, grandfather, and I remained.</p>
<p>I felt someone grasp my shoulder firmly and looked up. It was my grandfather in his wheelchair. I was honestly surprised that he stayed throughout the funeral. Even now, he looked deeply sorrowful.</p>
<p>“Grandfather.”</p>
<p>“Is your body okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Whether it was fortunate or unfortunate, my body was excessively normal, except for my cast arm.</p>
<p>“Get a check-up while you’re in the hospital.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“You must always be careful. If they learn about your condition, they’ll pounce and tear you apart.”</p>
<p>I was shocked. My condition? Miss Yena’s condition? She was perfectly healthy. But his words implied there was something wrong with her body. I hid my emotions and replied politely.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll do that.”</p>
<p>“And make sure you get the results only from Hospital Director Han.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I felt like I was uncovering Miss Yena’s secret.</p>
<p>“And there’s a team your sister-in-law used to run. I’ll give it to you, so make good use of them.”</p>
<p>It was my information team. I was wondering how to bring them over, so this was perfect.</p>
<p>“Yes, grandfather.”</p>
<p>He looked at me with a peculiar expression.</p>
<p>“Do you know what kind of team that is?”</p>
<p>“I’ll find out when I meet them.”</p>
<p>I had to feign ignorance. The information team was a secret only my grandfather and I knew about.</p>
<p>After the cremation, my husband received the urn with a calm demeanor, my father couldn’t hide his sorrow, and my mother almost collapsed. My heart was torn to pieces as I watched, unable to do anything. Tears streamed down my face, and I felt sorrow for my body being reduced to mere ashes. The guilt towards Miss Yena was even heavier.</p>
<p>My ashes were enshrined in my family’s Columbarium. My father had requested it, and my grandfather agreed. Upon hearing this, my husband used work as an excuse to leave.</p>
<p>Watching his retreating figure made me want to kill him. Only my parents and I remained. My mother was in a daze, and my father staggered, unable to steady himself. I spoke to Chief Jeon, who was attending me.</p>
<p>“Chief Jeon, please leave us for a moment.”</p>
<p>After he left, it was just us. I wheeled myself over to my mother.</p>
<p>“Mother-in-law.”</p>
<p>I had to address her as such while my voice trembled violently. My mother’s face was gaunt from the past few days. It was the first time we were alone throughout the funeral.</p>
<p>My heart ached deeply. But they needed the words I was about to say.</p>
<p>“Live. That’s what sister would have wanted.”</p>
<p>My mother staggered towards me, grabbed my hand, and sobbed.</p>
<p>“Thank you….”</p>
<p>She hadn’t spoken to my husband during the entire funeral. Though I had hidden it fiercely, she must have realized upon seeing him what kind of life her daughter had lived.</p>
<p>“Sister was preparing for a divorce.”</p>
