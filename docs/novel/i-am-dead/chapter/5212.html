            <p><strong>Chapter 13.1</strong></p>
<p>Grandfather’s face instantly showed his fury.</p>
<p>“How dare him! How long has it been since his wife died!”</p>
<p>“It seems like he has a child,” I added.</p>
<p>Grandfather’s eyes narrowed. “How do you know that?”</p>
<p>“I heard it at the funeral. My aunt and big brother were laughing and talking, not knowing I was outside.”</p>
<p>Grandfather’s fists trembled with anger.</p>
<p>“Those inhuman people….”</p>
<p>Grandfather must have known about my husband’s affair. Even though I excluded the family’s private affairs from my reports, there was no way he was unaware.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. As long as I’m alive, that will never happen.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I feel sorry for my sister-in-law. Nothing good has happened to her ever since she got married into this family.”</p>
<p>“That’s true… She left us so pitifully… It’s my fault. I should have acted….”</p>
<p>I looked at my self-reproaching grandfather with cold eyes. I didn’t feel any sympathy.</p>
<p>“I’ll be going now.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>As I was getting up, I turned around and spoke. “Would you like to have tea with me instead of sister-in-law from now on? I can do it on the weekends.”</p>
<p>Grandfather laughed heartily and replied, “Of course. I’d appreciate that.”</p>
<p>I left Grandfather’s room and went into my room, or rather, Miss Yena’s room. I was curious about the bag Housekeeper Ahn had brought a bag. Locking the door, I took off my outerwear and started searching the room.</p>
<p>There must be a place where that key fits. Where could it be?</p>
<p>I started by searching around the bed. Bingo! There was a keyhole in the bedside table drawer. I took out the key from my pocket and tried one of them. It didn’t fit. I tried the other key, and it finally clicked open.</p>
<p>What secret could it hold? I wondered, but when I saw the contents of the drawer, I was devastated. It was a drawer full of medicine.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>The young and beautiful Miss Yena was suffering from an illness. I was even made more aware of it. She hid it so well that she even used a key to keep it a secret. If I hadn’t died and our souls hadn’t swapped, she would have been filled with joy to recover from her illness.</p>
<p>My stomach felt sick. I had stolen Miss Yena’s life.</p>
<p>I was disgusted with myself for coldly thinking that the key held some special family secret to dig up. I was blinded by revenge.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I couldn’t take it anymore, I ran to the bathroom, grabbed the toilet seat, and threw up. Exhausted and in tears, I collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p>“What am I doing….”</p>
<p>My eyes stung. I had lost my mind. I only thought about what had happened to me and didn’t even think of Miss Yena.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…. I’m sorry, Miss Yena…”</p>
<p>I lay on the bathroom floor, sobbing quietly.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>After I pulled myself together and washed my face, I looked at Miss Yena’s room with a calmer mind. I felt apologetic, but I needed to find out what secret this key held.</p>
<p>I entered the dressing room and pulled and pushed everything around, trying to find a hidden compartment, but there was nothing.</p>
<p>Then, could the remaining key not be for this house…? Where could it be? The company?</p>
<p>Would Miss Yena really keep important documents at a place where many eyes and ears were around?</p>
<p>After almost an hour of searching, I gave up. I sat on the bed resignedly, and out of the corner of my eye, there was the drawer full of medicine. I opened the drawer and took out all the contents, putting it into the bag.</p>
<p>If I threw it away at home, someone might find it and use it against me. I’d have to get rid of it when I go to work on Monday. Just as I finished packing the medicine, there was an impatient knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>“Why are you locking the door at home? Open the door.”</p>
<p>I frowned. It was my mother-in-law. Why was she here?</p>
<p>As I hid my bag and opened the door, my mother-in-law strutted confidently inside the room, without even greeting me. She sat on the bedroom sofa, crossed her legs, and gestured with her chin to the seat opposite her.</p>
<p>“Sit down.”</p>
<p>I sat without a word. She placed something on the table—a photo and a document. I looked at them silently.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“You’ll be twenty-seven next year, right? How long do you plan on staying unmarried? He’s the second son of the Prosecutor General. He’s currently a prosecutor at the Public Prosecutors’ Office. Make time to meet him. It wasn’t easy to arrange this.”</p>
<p>I looked at the sprawled documents on the table and to my mother-in-law’s smug face. So, she wanted to kick Miss Yena out of the house. And even more, she wanted to plant a watchdog by my side.</p>
<p>How outrageous. My lips couldn’t help but turn into a sneer. My mother-in-law trembled in anger at my arrogance.</p>
<p>“You. How dare you show such an ungrateful attitude when an elder is speaking to you?”</p>
<p>“I guess since my parents were not around, I didn’t have the opportunity to receive proper education at home.”</p>
<p>My mother-in-law’s face twisted at my words. The tormented Buyeon inside me was satisfied to see her like this.</p>
