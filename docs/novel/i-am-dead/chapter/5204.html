            <p><strong>Chapter 19</strong></p>
<p>Back in my room, I glanced in the mirror and winced. My lip was split. Anyone who saw it would know I’d been hit. And I have to go to work tomorrow.</p>
<p>My thoughts drifted back to the sitting room. Jung Jinyoung. Grandfather had said he’d throw Namgung Muyeol out if she moved in.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it might be a good thing. From what I overheard, she’d stood up to Mother-in-law, and even threatened her. Jung Jinyoung’s temper seemed fierier than I’d expected. She didn’t back down.</p>
<p>This could work in my favor. I needed to find out more about her and decide if she could be useful to me.</p>
<p>I immediately called Team Leader Cha.</p>
<p>[Yes, Director.]</p>
<p>“There’s a woman named Jung Jinyoung, Muyeol’s mistress.”</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>“I need to know more about her.”</p>
<p>[What specifically?]</p>
<p>“Her personality, reputation, relationships, debts. Anything.”</p>
<p>[Understood.]</p>
<p>As I hung up, I smiled bitterly. When I was Lee Buyeon, Team Leader Cha and I had a cordial relationship. I remembered their birthdays and their children’s milestones with gifts and cash. We exchanged information, but there was a warmth to it.</p>
<p>Now, Cha Insook was cold and professional. She provided the information I needed, but that was all. It felt like losing an old friend. But I couldn’t reveal my true identity. I had to continue as I was.</p>
<p>Gaining one thing often means losing another; I was only now learning that lesson.</p>
<p>I heard a commotion outside and went to the window. Muyeol and Jung Jinyoung were arguing. She was crying, and he was frantically trying to console her.</p>
<p>I smirked. He must be going crazy. She threatened a press conference, and Grandfather said he’d kick him out if she moved in. He was trapped. It was satisfying.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The next morning at 4 a.m., I got up, put on my workout clothes and sneakers, and headed out. I walked the route I’d chosen yesterday, determined to keep it up every day. Early mornings were perfect for clearing my mind.</p>
<p>Today was a workday. I’d mastered the tasks and relationships in the office. But there were still nuances I couldn’t understand just from reports—like how to interact with people.</p>
<p>The real issue was that there were more supporters of Father-in-law in the company than I’d anticipated. I didn’t have many senior managers on my side. Their votes in future board meetings would be crucial.</p>
<p>My head throbbed with the complexity of it all. The temptation to give up was strong, but I steeled myself. This was Yena’s life, and I wanted to achieve what she desired.</p>
<p>Breakfast was unusually tense and silent. Even my husband, who would usually have followed Jung Jinyoung, sat quietly at the table. I refrained from provoking him today.</p>
<p>At 7 a.m., I put on my coat and the sneakers he’d given me and waited for Mr. Jang’s arrival. When his text came, I grabbed the bag with the file from my safe and reported to Grandfather.</p>
<p>“I’m off, Grandfather.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Take care.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Is Mr. Jang picking you up?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Don’t overdo it. Your health comes first.”</p>
<p>“I understand. See you later.”</p>
<p>Leaving Grandfather’s room, I stepped outside. Mr. Jang, waiting by the car, gave me a bright smile, instantly lifting my mood.</p>
<p>“Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>As he approached, he paused, and his expression became dark. He stopped in front of me and scrutinized my split lip.</p>
<p>“Who did this?”</p>
<p>“Namgung Muyeol.”</p>
<p>I answered honestly. There was no reason to hide it. His eyes flashed with murder.</p>
<p>“Did you put anything on it?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Get in the car. It’s cold today.”</p>
<p>He opened the car door for me. As we drove through the gate, he didn’t mention my lip. Shouldn’t he at least offer some comfort to the girl he liked?</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you asking?”</p>
<p>“Asking what?”</p>
<p>“Why I got hit.”</p>
<p>“Do you need a reason?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Whatever the reason, violence is violence. A man who hits a woman doesn’t deserve to exist.”</p>
<p>His words felt like a balm, something I, Lee Buyeon, had longed to hear. No one had comforted me back then.</p>
<p>Feeling sentimental, I turned to look out the window. I had lived for ten years with a beast who had no right to exist. I had always thought of revenge but never considered the specifics.</p>
<p>I would figure it out eventually. Right now, I was too busy adjusting to my new life. But one thing was clear—I would ruin his life. Completely and so subtly that he wouldn’t even realize it was happening. I was resolute.</p>
<p>We arrived at the office. The International Business Department was located between the Executive Director’s office and the President’s office. Before stepping in, he smiled at me.</p>
<p>“Good luck today.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. You too, President.”</p>
<p>I took a deep breath in front of the door. As I entered the office, the staff welcomed me warmly.</p>
<p>“Director, what happened? You’re wearing a cast!”</p>
<p>“Are you feeling better?”</p>
<p>“You should’ve taken more time off. Are you really okay?”</p>
<p>Their concern reassured me. It seemed Yena had a good relationship with her subordinates. Smiling, I replied, “I’m fine now.”</p>
<p>I mentally matched the information I had with their faces. I was searching for someone—Team Leader Jeong Han-il, Namgung Muyeol’s spy. He regularly received envelopes from Muyeol through the Chief Secretary, Ahn Chihong. Team Leader Cha had confirmed this. Just then, someone bumped into me from behind.</p>
<p>“Ouch.”</p>
<p>“Who the hell…”</p>
<p>The grumbling person was the very one I was looking for, Team Leader Jeong Han-il. With his slit-like eyes and thin lips, he looked even more sly and treacherous in person. Seeing me, he hurriedly bowed.</p>
<p>“Oh, hello, Director.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s been a while, Team Leader Jeong.”</p>
<p>My slightly barbed tone seemed to unsettle him, but he quickly plastered on a sycophantic smile.</p>
<p>“I was so worried about you. But I’m glad to see you’ve returned in good health.”</p>
<p>“You have been waiting for me?”</p>
<p>My calm, slow tone flustered him.</p>
<p>“Of course. Absolutely.”</p>
<p>Ignoring him, I addressed everyone, “Let’s start the meeting and then get to work. Meeting in 30 minutes.”</p>
<p>Before turning away, I caught a glimpse of Jeong’s sour expression. I entered the Director’s office. I drew the blinds on the glass walls and began searching for where the key might fit. The cabinets had keyholes, but none matched.</p>
<p>I approached the desk. On it was a childhood photo of Yena with Grandfather. Sitting down, I tried the key in each drawer but to no avail. Frustration crept in. Where could this key possibly fit? It was crucial to find out.</p>
<p>Pausing my search, I turned on the computer. I punched in the password written in Team Leader Cha’s report and the screen flickered. I scrolled through the files, all the while marveling at Jo Jungsik’s hacking skills.</p>
<p>His report was about hacking Yena’s computer. With skills like his, even the President’s office would be vulnerable. I spent 30 minutes reviewing files before leaving the office.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s start the meeting. Everyone, report on your ongoing projects.”</p>
<p>As we headed to the conference room, a shout echoed from outside the door.</p>
<p>“Namgung Muyeol!”</p>
<p>I heard my husband’s name, and I opened the office door, wondering what was going on. I was stunned to see my ex-husband and President Jang facing off in the hallway.</p>
<p>What was going on? Behind me, the staff clustered together, watching the scene unfold. My husband looked in my direction, his eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“What’s this about?” Namgung Muyeol asked icily.</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember what you did?” President Jang interrupted.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Move.”</p>
<p>I was shocked. The usually calm and mannerly President Jang looked like a beast on the verge of exploding. He spoke in a low voice, his tone deadly.</p>
<p>“Bite the bullet. Or I’ll break it.”</p>
<p>Then he swung his right fist. The sound of the punch was followed by the staff’s shocked gasps as my husband staggered back against the wall. I was truly stunned.</p>
<p>Not just because he hit him in front of everyone but because he hit him at all. When I told him about being hit this morning, I never imagined this would happen.</p>
<p>“You son of a b!tc`h!”</p>
<p>Furious, my husband threw a punch in return, but President Jang easily dodged it. The commotion drew employees from their offices, creating a buzz.</p>
<p>“Think carefully about who you hit.”</p>
<p>“What!”</p>
<p>“If you lay a hand on her again, I’ll k1ll you.”</p>
<p>His voice was low, his gaze lethal. Cold fury radiated from President Jang. Namgung Muyeol’s face turned red with rage.</p>
<p>“You’re doing this because I hit Yena? Do you know who I am? I’m Namgung Muyeol!”</p>
<p>“So what? Does Namgung Muyeol get to hit women?”</p>
<p>“You bastard!”</p>
