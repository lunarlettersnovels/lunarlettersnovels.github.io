            <h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p>Hanga, located in a quiet area of Samcheong-dong, is a place that faithfully recreates a traditional Korean hanok. I had been here once before with my mother when I was Lee Buyeon, but as Namgung Yena, I’m not sure. Was it my first time, or had I been here before? As we passed through the arched gate, a manager dressed in a suit came out to greet us.</p>
<p>“Are you Mr. Jang Doha?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>“I’ll guide you to the Un (雲) Room.”</p>
<p>We followed him. The Un Room was a standalone space, much like an annex. As we entered, a subtle fragrance filled the air. On the walls hung scrolls with orchids painted on them, and the traditional furniture was neatly arranged. The table was larger than you’d expect for four people—likely because Korean multi-course meals come with many dishes.</p>
<p>“Shall we start serving the food right away, or would you prefer tea first?”</p>
<p>President Jang glanced at me, and I opted for tea. After observing the room, he spoke.</p>
<p>“This place looks just like something out of a drama. What do you call that piece over there?”</p>
<p>He pointed at a chest of drawers inlaid with mother-of-pearl.</p>
<p>“It’s called a ‘mungap.’ The smaller drawers with floral designs are medicine cabinet,” I replied.</p>
<p>“You seem to like traditional things, Yena.”</p>
<p>“I don’t particularly like them. I just know about them because my grandfather used them.”</p>
<p>He nodded, as if recalling his own grandfather’s room. “I noticed there were a lot of paintings and ceramics in your grandfather’s room too,” he said.</p>
<p>“His hobbies are calligraphy and Go,” I replied.</p>
<p>“No other hobbies?”</p>
<p>“Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“Because I’d like to get closer to your grandfather.”</p>
<p>His straightforward comment made me laugh in disbelief. Seeing me laugh, his eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>“You’re finally smiling.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Since the elevator ride earlier, you haven’t said much, and you haven’t smiled.”</p>
<p>When I looked awkward, he continued.</p>
<p>“Don’t feel pressured. Just think of it casually. At work, we’re colleagues, and outside of work, maybe I’m like an older brother?”</p>
<p>My face twisted in confusion. “An older brother?” I said slowly.</p>
<p>“I’m six years older than you. Of course, I’m your oppa.”</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but let out a laugh. His eyes grew wide.</p>
<p>“That reaction… does that mean you don’t agree?”</p>
<p>“I already have enough ‘oppa.’ Three of them, in fact—and they’re all a real handful.”</p>
<p>“You don’t get along with your brothers, do you? From what I saw when you were talking to Executive Director Namgung…”</p>
<p>I cut him off. “I have quite the temper too, you know?”</p>
<p>“But it’s much better than being on the receiving end.”</p>
<p>“I’m not exactly easygoing. I’m sensitive and picky.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what your employees say.”</p>
<p>“What do they say?”</p>
<p>“They say you’re a bit of a workaholic, but you’re fair and just. You treat everyone equally, regardless of rank.”</p>
<p>I was baffled. “Did you talk about this with the staff?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Actually, when you were in the hospital, we opened an anonymous internal forum, asking people to freely share any concerns or complaints. Every department had something to say—except for the International Business Department. They all praised you, calling you ‘our boss.’”</p>
<p>“And you made that public?”</p>
<p>“No, I saw it alone.”</p>
<p>“Why did you do that?”</p>
<p>“If you ignore the staff’s concerns, it festers inside. I wanted to put an end to issues like power abuse by superiors or stealing ideas.”</p>
<p>“But you’re someone who will leave eventually… All you need to do is increase sales, so why go that far?”</p>
<p>“Well, I get paid a lot, right? I feel like I should fix something before I leave. Ah, and I haven’t decided if I’m leaving yet,” he smiled. “If Yena accepts my feelings, I’m willing to stay longer.”</p>
<p>There was a playful twinkle in his eyes. On the surface, Jang Doha seemed easygoing and mischievous, but that wasn’t the whole story. He was a thorough perfectionist. Fair, too.</p>
<p>He was the complete opposite of Namgung Muyeol. From MK’s perspective, it would be beneficial if he stayed longer. My grandfather’s judgment of people had been spot on.</p>
<p>The tea arrived. It was cherry blossom tea. When hot water was poured, the petals slowly unfolded, releasing a subtle fragrance. He inhaled the scent and marveled.</p>
<p>“What kind of tea is this? It smells so good,” he said.</p>
<p>I smiled and answered him. “It’s cherry blossom tea. I’ve heard it’s made only from cherry blossoms that are specially cultivated in clean air environments. These flowers have to be roasted at low temperatures for a long time.”</p>
<p>“Roasted?”</p>
<p>“They’re stir-fried in a dry pan. When you make tea, it’s called roasting.”</p>
<p>“I thought I knew Korean well, but there’s still a lot to learn. That’s good to know.”</p>
<p>“You’re too kind.”</p>
<p>President Jang looked at me intently.</p>
<p>“Why are you staring at me like that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, I feel like I can see traces of your grandfather. You know a lot about old furniture and flower teas. Even your way of speaking.”</p>
<p>I was slightly taken aback. “Is my way of speaking strange?”</p>
<p>“I used to think you talked like other people in their twenties, but you’ve definitely changed. Not that it’s a bad thing. You mentioned before it was intentional, right? I’ve noticed the way the executives treat you has changed too.”</p>
<p>“In a good way?”</p>
<p>“Yes. People judge others by their age. At first, I noticed the executives had a dismissive attitude towards you, especially Executive Director Namgung.”</p>
<p>“My brother tends to look down on others.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I make a point of speaking and behaving more formally around the executives.”</p>
<p>“To make sure they can’t look down on you?”</p>
<p>He chuckled. “Exactly.”</p>
<p>“So, which one is the real you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Are you curious?”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“I like to joke around, I love being playful, and I enjoy physical activities. But when I get focused on work, I can go days without washing, sleeping, or eating.”</p>
<p>“When you were starting Meat?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I wasn’t even human back then.”</p>
<p>I laughed. Conversations with him were never boring. Everything flowed naturally, and he never came across as forced or trying to impress. That made me feel at ease.</p>
<p>Our meal arrived, and he looked flustered at the endless array of side dishes. Once the table was fully set and it was just the two of us again, he asked,</p>
<p>“Is it always like this?”</p>
<p>“This place serves traditional royal cuisine. Other places tend to simplify the number of dishes or do fusion, but places like this are rare now.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like this before.”</p>
<p>“It’s not difficult. They just use the same ingredients, but in a more refined and meticulous way.”</p>
<p>As we ate, I briefly explained the ingredients and the origins of the dishes. He listened intently and was also impressed with the flavors of the food.</p>
<p>“The seasoning doesn’t seem too strong overall,” he noted.</p>
<p>“That’s because royal cuisine has many dietary restrictions. It’s a natural and wholesome way of cooking. In our country, it’s considered expensive and difficult to make, but I believe it could appeal to people overseas. If the popular approach succeeds, we could even open a restaurant targeting a specific niche market later. That’s why I made royal cuisine the core of this project.”</p>
<p>He paused mid-meal to look at me intently.</p>
<p>“Why are you staring at me like that again?”</p>
<p>“To be honest, when I first met you, I just thought you were pretty and attractive.”</p>
<p>I resisted the urge to laugh. “And now?”</p>
<p>“You’re breaking all my preconceived notions. You’re deeper and more open-minded than I expected. I can also see your potential as a business leader.”</p>
<p>I remained silent for awhile. “Well… I grew up learning about business right by my grandfather’s side. Maybe that’s the difference you see?”</p>
<p>“You’ve been different from the start.” He smiled warmly. “Go ahead and eat.”</p>
<p>Sharing a meal with him was a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>After we finished eating, the table was cleared. Noticing how much food was left untouched due to the large portions, he commented.</p>
<p>“It feels like such a waste. Some of this wasn’t even touched.”</p>
<p>“This place is expensive for a single meal. People know the food will go to waste, but they still choose to dine here. Do you know why?” I said.</p>
<p>“Because it’s expensive?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. The fact that the food is wasted doesn’t matter to them. It’s about making deals, negotiating terms, and finding common ground while being treated to a meal in a place like this. This isn’t just a restaurant; it’s a meeting ground. Of course, not all meetings here are positive ones.”</p>
<p>He chuckled.</p>
<p>“My parents are ordinary people. I grew up normally too. Honestly, I didn’t want to know the behind-the-scenes of these big corporations. When I first joined MK, the first thing I heard was that I’d need to entertain clients and play golf.”</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of discussion that happens in those settings. Just like a person can’t live alone, a company can’t survive purely on its own either.”</p>
<p>“Do you really believe that?”</p>
<p>“I used to. Before I met you, that is. Didn’t I say you’re breaking my preconceptions? You’re showing me that it’s possible to run a business differently.”</p>
<p>Our eyes met, and we exchanged smiles filled with trust. It felt like we had found good partners in each other. He asked,</p>
<p>“Would it be okay if we stayed out a bit longer?”</p>
<p>“Next time, could you tell me why along with the question? I’d probably answer faster.”</p>
<p>He laughed heartily.</p>
<p>“Fair enough. I’m actually feeling a bit tired today, and I was thinking of going to an arcade to blow off some steam. I was wondering if you’d like to join me.”</p>
<p>“An arcade?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, there’s a good one near my place that’s open 24 hours. Sometimes I go there to shoot some guns and relieve stress.”</p>
<p>I was curious to check it out, but unfortunately, my energy was running low. Shaking my head, I replied,</p>
<p>“I think I need to rest. Let’s go to the arcade after I’ve built up some more stamina.”</p>
<p>“This is tiring for you?”</p>
<p>I gave a wry smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, apparently so.”</p>
<p>“How about starting some exercise?”</p>
<p>“I actually started jogging early in the mornings. Well, right now, it’s more like walking, but I’m hoping I’ll be able to run someday.”</p>
<p>“Just the act of challenging yourself is meaningful in itself. Well done. I’ll be cheering you on.”</p>
<p>His eyes sparkled. They were the eyes of someone full of health and vitality. I wondered, do my eyes shine like that too? That thought suddenly crossed my mind.</p>
