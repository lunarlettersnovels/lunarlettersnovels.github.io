            <p><strong>Chapter 32 – First Rejection (I)</strong></p>
<p>The goddess of love had sworn to never forgive her husband after abandoning her hours into their marriage. Yet here she was now, thinking, <em>How can I stay angry at him</em>? That all the residents of Olympus were either smooth liars, or prideful to the point of being incapable of an apology, was something Aphrodite took as a fact of life. But as Hephaestus continued to mumble words of apology with his eyes downcast, she became more and more convinced that he was sincere.</p>
<p>It was a strange feeling. In the heat of her fury, Aphrodite had sworn to every force in the universe more powerful to the gods that she would make her husband regret his actions. Now, she had all but forgotten all her oaths and plans for vengeance. Hephaestus’ words, which seemed to contain nothing but sincerity and contrition, had sapped all the anger out of his wife.</p>
<p>Still, she could not help but think that perhaps her husband was no different from their other brethren who could lie blatantly without so much as blinking. <em>But where could he have learnt that, </em>she thought. <em>Or from whom?</em> Besides, Hephaestus did not strike Aphrodite as the cunning type. If any, he was a bit slow.</p>
<p>As he continued his stream of words in a low voice, the goddess of love cut him off haughtily, saying “Well, if you say it like that, I have nothing to say.”</p>
<p>Without waiting for a response, she continued, “But I’m telling you, what you did was very wrong. I hate the fact that it happened to me.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I didn’t think it through.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite’s amazement continued to grow. She was talking to him as if he was some lowly attendant of hers at a temple, not the god of fires and blacksmiths but he did not seem to take any offense at all. If anything, it seemed he became more ashamed, like a henpecked husband. With her heart actually feeling sorry for him, the goddess of love decided to end her charade of being angry at him, saying, “Never do it again.”</p>
<p>His answer made her freeze.</p>
<p>“I can’t do that.”</p>
<p>“What did you just say?” She could not believe her ears. Hephaestus should be groveling on his knees right now, with words such as “Yes” or “Of course.”</p>
<p>“I said no,” he repeated, removing all doubt from Aphrodite.</p>
<p>“You mean, no, you will never do that again, am I right?” she replied, still in denial.</p>
<p>“No. It means I can’t promise that it won’t happen again.”</p>
<p>The goddess of love was at a loss for words. Granted, his bluntness continued to make her uncomfortable. But this was on another level.</p>
<p>“I can’t let you do that. I don’t want to get hurt twice,” she stammered weakly, ashamed that her weakness was showing in her voice.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’d rather offend you rather than make a promise I can’t keep.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re so honest! So honorable,” she responded, sarcasm oozing with every syllable. Hephaestus was dull, but not that dull as to be unable to notice. He bowed his head in shame. Still, he answered back, saying, “I can’t break my contract with Zeus. If he beckons, I follow. This is not the first time, at least, for the other gods and goddesses.”</p>
<p>“You’re a god, for crying out loud. Not a servant”</p>
<p>“Of course not. We both entered into an agreement,” he answered in a patient tone, as if he was already a father explaining things to a simple-minded child. But Aphrodite understood what he meant. Her husband also got something out of the arrangement. That would explain why he would rather disappoint his wife on their wedding night rather than break the contract. Still, she could not overcome the feeling that her husband was being taken advantage of. After all, he was no god of wisdom.</p>
<p>“Regardless of an agreement, don’t you think it’s unfair Zeus had to make you run out of your bedroom the day after your wedding?”</p>
<p>“That was an exception. Besides, I actually asked him to give me a day off for our wedding so I could spend the night with you,” he answered, with a tone that indicated he clearly thought Zeus had done him a big favor.</p>
<p>“Exception? What kind of exceptions are there?”</p>
<p>Silence, again. Aphrodite stared hard at her husband, willing him to talk. She was dead-set not to let him get away with not answering this time.</p>
<p>Finally, he spoke with a sigh, “It’s because you went by before.”</p>
<p>“Me? When, where?”</p>
<p>More silence.</p>
<p>“You mean <em>that </em>time?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>Aphrodite recalled the day she went to see him to receive the Kestos Himas.<em> “Come to think of it, he was busy at that time. Does he mean that I got in the way of his work,” </em>she thought. The goddess of love blushed in shame. To cover it up, she blustered, “Then you should have told me to leave.”</p>
