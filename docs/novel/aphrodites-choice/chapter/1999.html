            <p><strong>Chapter 30 – The Tradition of Olympus</strong></p>
<p>Zeus’ plan was effective enough to achieve a moderate balance in the relationships between humans and gods. The wars did not cause worry on the destruction of mankind anymore, and this allowed the gods to remain stable.</p>
<p>It was Aphrodite who received everyone’s attention at the feast. It had always been the case since she joined Olympus, but she was extraordinarily beautiful today. It was her first appearance to others after her marriage. She was clothed in delicately textured fabrics that Athena had gifted to her, adorned with bright gold and colored jewels. Her hair was elegantly braided with fresh red roses. No human could ever completely replicate nor mimic her beauty.</p>
<p>“You’re so beautiful today.”</p>
<p>“Haha, isn’t it natural? She’s now a woman.”</p>
<p>Some stared and admired, enchanted by her beauty, while others spit spiteful words and whispered. One very keen person said something a little different.</p>
<p>“Why does she look so upset?”</p>
<p>“Who? Goddess Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. She didn’t smile even once today.”</p>
<p>Some heard what this person was saying and looked at Aphrodite again, realizing it was true.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, we’re looking at her too much.”</p>
<p>Despite others’ concerns, the reason she was frowning was not because of their gazes. Amassing the attention of others was as natural as breathing for her; it didn’t feel special in any way. It was because her husband’s presence was nowhere to be seen at the feast. She had ordered her nymphs to look everywhere for him, but no one said they had seen him. She had believed Athena’s words that he would be at the feast, but he was not there. If she knew it would be like this, she would have gone to his sanctuary instead and destroy the disgusting walls that stood proudly there.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I could do that now? </em>She thought, imagining the iron gate becoming crumpled and the walls breaking down into a pile of stones. <em>It would be nice to break the chimney of the forge as well. He would have nowhere to hide as an excuse if I destroyed all of his equipment. This really sounds like a good idea!</em></p>
<p>Her destructive impulse had almost turned into actions when Athena spoke to her.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Come here. What are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>“What? I wasn’t thinking about anything.”</p>
<p>The two goddesses headed to a corner where they could hide from other people. Aphrodite blatantly denied Athena’s speculation. She thought there was no reason to confess to her as the plan was only in her head. However, Athena read Aphrodite’s thoughts right away.</p>
<p>“Hephaestus is talking with my father.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t ask.”</p>
<p>“No way. You were just thinking about how to sabotage him until now.”</p>
<p>“My goodness! You’re saying such a scary thing. Why would I think about that?”</p>
<p>Although Aphrodite was denying her accusation, her expression showed that she was shocked at how Athena pointed out her thoughts. Athena let out a sigh, “As I said before, Hephaestus cannot refuse father’s requests. I don’t know the exact details of the contract between them, but it is clear that it has strong control over Hephaestus’ actions.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I know the contract and I didn’t say anything about that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you did. Something very spiteful at that.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite sneered, realizing that Athena was talking about what happened the day after her wedding. That day, Athena happened to be with Zeus when he was meeting with Hephaestus. She had decided to become the messenger for Aphrodite.  When she explained his untimely disappearance, Aphrodite had laughed bitterly and swore at both Zeus and Hephaestus. Had Athena not pacify her, something undesirable could have happened to the two gods.</p>
<p>“I’m just telling you this so that you would forgive him.”</p>
<p>“I told you I would think about it.”</p>
<p>“It sure doesn’t sound like you are. You sound angrier at best.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help it. The more I think about what happened, the angrier I get.”</p>
<p>However, Aphrodite endured with all the patience she had. She was enduring after she heard that Hephaestus was stuck in his forge because of Zeus, after realizing that she could only wait endlessly for more news from him. It was a lot of patience, which did not suit her personality. She had never been so generous with anyone.</p>
<p>“Father is also very concerned about you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, tell him not to worry. It’s useless.”</p>
<p>“This is really an unavoidable circumstance, so please try to understand…”</p>
<p>“Stop it, Athena. I’m warning you.”<br>
