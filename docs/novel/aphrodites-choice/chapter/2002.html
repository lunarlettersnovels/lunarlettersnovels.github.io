            <p><strong>Chapter 27 – Pain and Pleasure (II)</strong></p>
<p>Aphrodite was about to say something else to tease Hephaestus, challenge him even, but her words were cut short by a gasp from her throat as he went in. Her womanhood suddenly felt like it was on fire. Even more, the burning sensation not only overwhelmed every inch of it, it threatened to penetrate up to her belly button. <em>Damn, he is enormous beyond all expectation</em>, she exultantly thought, looking up to Hephaestus who had clambered on top of her and entered her with a swiftness and sleekness she did not expect from someone as brawny as him.</p>
<p>Her unspeakable joy at his penetration gave way to an overwhelming of her senses, as if her mind could not come up with appropriate words to describe the sensation. Hephaestus could push deeper, gently, and Aphrodite could only come up with choked sounds in protest. Instead, she began slapping his chest powerlessly, as if to push him away.</p>
<p>“Relax.”</p>
<p>“How… can I? You’re… going to… destroy me down there,” she gasped weakly.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? I thought you wanted this. I tried to warn you. And besides, it’s not even half in.”</p>
<p>“Lies, lies!” she protested but as she peered down, she could see that it wasn’t.  <em>Oh no, he isn’t even fully in yet</em>, thought Aphrodite, her mind in equal parts of panic and excitement. She was afraid of what would happen if he pushed it all in. But at the same time, a part of her wanted to find out, like a moth drawn towards a flame. The goddess of love began to drool in anticipation.</p>
<p>The expression did not escape the attention of Hephaestus. He felt his steely resolve to not hurt her more, near as hard as his manhood, weaken.</p>
<p>“No. Keep going. I can take it,” protested Aphrodite, afraid that her husband might lose heart and completely withdraw.</p>
<p>Wordlessly, he acknowledged her words by slowly pressing in deeper. It brought both pain and pleasure to a whole new height and she almost involuntarily wrapped her legs around his waist while her arms interlocked behind his back, like a drowning person holding onto a piece of wood to keep afloat.</p>
<p><em>Damn</em>, she thought in awe as he felt his manhood throb inside her. He was either that deep in or that massive. Probably both. On top of that, Aphrodite could feel him dig deeper with each thrust, as the sensation began to reach into her belly.</p>
<p>“Oh… my… are you getting bigger? You’re getting even bigger!” she gasped weakly, her breath now coming in pants as deep and fast as Hephaestus’ thrusts. For an answer, he continued to pump inside of her, each thrust making an obscene sound as his flesh smacked hers, making Aphrodite dig her nails into his back as she agonized whether to make him continue or stop. Still, he bore into her, every steel-hard thrust felt in every nerve of her body. His wife bit him wherever her mouth could reach him, her body losing ways to express the mind-blowing pleasure it was drowning in now.</p>
<p>The last vestiges of self-control gone, Hephaestus began to thrust at her with wild abandon. Aphrodite lost her understanding of all but one word: her husband’s name which she kept muttering rapidly, as if in frantic prayer to a power higher than the two of them. Like the god of smithing that he was, he hammered on the fire between the goddess of love’s legs as if he was forging his greatest work. With no relenting on his part, Aphrodite’s chanting turned into a scream. Each scream contained his name and it echoed all over their room.</p>
<p>With that, Hephaestus lost all control. He exploded his sweet nectar inside her in such a torrent that she felt it. And then another spurt. And another. Each one fully felt by Aphrodite as his manhood throbbed with each release. His releases seemed non-stop to the goddess of love, something that did not surprise her as this was his very first in his long existence.</p>
<p>She felt that his manhood had not diminished in size and thus wanted to urge him on, thinking that it would be a shame to waste that heavenly thing. But despite that, she felt a heaviness seeping through her limbs as the exhaustion from their coupling began to outweigh the pleasure. <em>No, no, no, no, </em>she thought to herself. She wanted more.</p>
<p>As sleep began to overwhelm her consciousness, she could somehow make out him saying, “Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>“This is… what… I hate…”</p>
<p>She wanted to say something but even her lips felt heavy now.</p>
<p>“It’s unfair…”</p>
<p>If she had seen his distorted expression or heard his painful sigh and asked about it, a lot would have changed.</p>
<p>However, she fell into a long-awaited dreamless sleep and had no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>It wasn’t her fault.</p>
<p>It wasn’t his fault either, but no one was there to think so.<br>
