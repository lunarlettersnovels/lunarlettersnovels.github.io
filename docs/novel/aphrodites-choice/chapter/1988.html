            <p><strong>Chapter 41 – The Lascivious Goddess</strong></p>
<p>Aphrodite had emerged as the new epitome of debauchery in Olympus.</p>
<p>As if holding a banquet once every ten days was not sufficient, she held a feast almost every day and welcomed whoever seemed willing to attend. And each time, she would tell them tales that made their eyes go wide. Naturally, it attracted the descendants of those in Olympus, who were fed up with boredom.</p>
<p>“Ah, you are here today as well!”</p>
<p>“Of course. There’s nowhere else that is as entertaining as here, these days.”</p>
<p>The latest hot topic was Aphrodite’s beautiful human which she had brought from Cyprus, her sanctuary on the ground.</p>
<p>“That child Adonis really is quite the looker.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed. I wonder if he will be here today?”</p>
<p>Adonis, the grandson of the king of Cyprus, looked beautiful even when he stood next to the goddess of beauty. But the reason why everyone’s attention was focused on him was not plainly because of his looks.</p>
<p>“I heard he will be returning to Cyprus.”</p>
<p>“What? Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s not confirmed but I heard it’s because a certain someone is jealous of him.”</p>
<p>“Someone is jealous? It can’t be Hephaestus?”</p>
<p>“Heh, how is he relevant to this conversation?”</p>
<p>Aphrodite’s beloved beautiful boy had an extremely powerful love rival  god strong enough to crush a juvenile with his thumb—someone who was violent and narrow-minded enough to do such a thing.</p>
<p>It was not Hephaestus who was being completely ignored by his wife.</p>
<p>“It must be Ares.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Ares had been loitering around Aphrodite, and was openly trying to court her. To him, it was a great hunt to prey on his brother’s new wife. Which meant Adonis was like a wedge stuck between Ares and Aphrodite. In particular, Ares had recognized Adonis in the previous banquet and explicitly expressed his hostility towards him. The onlookers watched their love triangle with great excitement, and couldn’t help but be disappointed to hear that Adonis would be leaving Olympus—just as things started to become interesting.</p>
<p>“What a pity. I was certain he would last long.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s better to leave alive than be killed.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whilst the sightseeing may have been free, it was impossible to interfere. The only thing the onlookers could do is hypothesize new scenarios and wait for events to unfold.</p>
<p>“That’s true. Oh, so does this mean that the goddess has finally accepted Ares’ feelings?”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“She’s let go of someone she was close to.”</p>
<p>“Possibly, yes.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite, who happened to be overhearing the conversation, laughed to herself.</p>
<p><em>I must keep a close eye on the two of you today.</em></p>
<p>Adonis was her godson. In the process of reconciling after a misunderstanding between Aphrodite and the royal family, Aphrodite was asked to be the boy’s godmother. He was so beautiful and sweet that she agreed to protect and take care of him. Her appreciation of Adonis stopped there. So, she could only laugh that he was part of a scandal involving himself and Ares.</p>
<p>Though it was true that Ares had shown clear signs of jealousy, Aphrodite couldn’t help but think that Ares must lack self-respect. Even after he had stormed off after being kicked out by Aphrodite, he attended her banquets and feasts every day, and did not shy away from outwardly pleading for her love.</p>
<p>He even apologised for what had occurred between Hera and Aphrodite, stating that should his mother lose her temper and destroy Olympus, he would ensure no harm came her way. Aphrodite wanted to scoff, but Ares seemed surprisingly sincere.</p>
<p>Besides, she already had confirmation that her relationship with Ares did nothing to provoke Hephaestus in any way. Rumors that the two were together had spread far and wide, even beyond Olympus, and all Hephaestus had claimed was that his job was more important than his wife.</p>
<p>Perhaps that man’s heart was made of steel.</p>
<p>Whenever she thought about Hephaestus, she felt her blood boil. At the start of their marriage, she was calmer about the issue, but now she got emotionally worked up on anything regarding it. Certainly, it was not her fault—it was purely his. How could he not say anything? Shouldn’t he have come running? What kind of attitude was that, not caring what his wife did with another man?</p>
<p>She had prepared what she was going to say if he appeared, as well as an answer to all the possible scenarios she could think of. But what was the point, when he was nowhere in sight?</p>
<p>Her pride stung, and it was almost comical how she was unable to give up. It didn’t matter what it took, she wanted to see a reaction in Hephaestus.<br>
