            <p><strong>Chapter 15 – The Strangest of All</strong></p>
<p>“The question is simple,” Hephaestus said.</p>
<p>“I know that!” Aphrodite snapped.</p>
<p>“You can either say ‘yes’, or you can say ‘no’, depending on what you truly want.”</p>
<p>“I know, Mr. Obvious, I swore to the Styx to tell the truth. Just give me some time, okay?”</p>
<p>His seriousness accompanied by that unending reservoir of calmness confounded her. Both of their lives’ serious decisions had been revealed as a chess piece on some Jester’s board, knowing how Zeus played them both. ‘<em>How in the entire Hades could he remain so calm?’</em> She shook her head and laughed, this was all so absurd, then she asked with a frown, “You didn’t want to get married, did you? Is that why you are so adamant at wriggling an answer out of me?”</p>
<p>When Hephaestus looked at her, his gray eyes reflected the angry Goddess of Love and Beauty before him. But this God of Fire emanated a calmness that was unlike anything she had ever experienced.</p>
<p>“Is this your first question among the three?”</p>
<p>Aphrodite didn’t know how to respond to that, she was dumbfounded. She didn’t intend it to be her very first binding question. Oh well…</p>
<p>“If it is not subjected to the oath, then I refuse to answer it,” he said.</p>
<p>“Hey, no way in hell!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I think I am going to lie to that then,” he said, with that insufferable smirk.</p>
<p>“Since when have you been the God of Honesty,” said Aphrodite, rolling her eyes. Her sarcasm was lost on him, instead he looked at her and repeated the same words.</p>
<p>“Do you want to break the marriage?” he asked.</p>
<p>Aphrodite pondered long and hard. She felt so exhausted when she recalled Zeus’ deception, and all the charade he had conjured to trick her into this marriage. She could say ‘yes’ and break this marriage once and for all. There was nothing to lose. Or was there? But she couldn’t utter the words. She had that damned oath to thank for it! She couldn’t say anything that wasn’t true to her.</p>
<p><em>‘Do I really want to break it off?’ </em>Aphrodite thought, facing Hephaestus. She could see that he was waiting for her answer, ever so attentively. But she didn’t know what was going through that head of his.</p>
<p><em>‘How in the blasted Hades can you be so calm?’ </em>she thought.</p>
<p>She couldn’t understand this man. Would he really break it all off with one answer from her? God knows all of Olympus wanted to marry the Goddess of Love and Beauty. They wanted to own her. And this man, knowing that she would have to be with him no matter what, was offering the same goddess a chance to walk away.</p>
<p>So many questions were ricocheting in Aphrodite’s mind. ‘<em>Will he be happy if I said no? Should we just confront Zeus and put an end to all this facade? If Zeus allows him to break it off, will he be happy then? Will he walk away without even a glance?’</em></p>
<p>Aphrodite let out a weary sigh. At this moment she felt utterly alone. The only clarity in her mind was that of the bitterness that she felt towards Zeus and the whole of Olympus. The loneliness and betrayal were all she was left with. The sorrow that welled up inside her was shared by just one other person who was, at this time, before her eyes. In that moment of clarity, Aphrodite reached out and grabbed Hephaestus’ collar. Hephaestus’ eyes grew wide as he looked at her with surprise.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite?” he said.</p>
<p>“I won’t,” Aphrodite blurted out, “I don’t want to break it off.” She looked at him, searching his face for any reaction, any indication of his feelings.</p>
<p>“You do know what that means? You said it was terrible being deceived—”</p>
<p>“I am not going to break it off! Are you having trouble understanding simple words?” said Aphrodite mockingly.</p>
<p>“No, I am just making sure,” he said, looking at her with tenderness.</p>
<p>The more she repeated these words, the angrier she felt. She was angry at herself; this was unexpected. How could she agree to stay when this was just a result of deception that Zeus forced onto her? She projected this anger onto the one person that was before her.</p>
<p>She pulled his collar violently. All the anger and emotions presented itself in the form of a surge of dizziness, and she almost fell. Hephaestus held her by the shoulder and set her on the seat as easily as if she was light as a feather.</p>
<p>“Be careful,” he said, with a low scratchy voice.</p>
<p>His tone was reproachful, and she flinched without meaning to. He let out a faint sigh and let his hands, which were holding her, fall to his side. She was still leaning on him, surprised by this strange feeling. She had always been in control of her feelings; she was the Goddess of Love! She made others flustered. Being flustered herself wasn’t apt for a goddess! She was confused, and a little afraid of what she felt. Is this how others felt when they fell for her, or when they were overwhelmed with love?</p>
<p>Hephaestus let out a slow cough. Well, this was awkward! She straightened up, looking at him. Her dizziness and nausea were subsiding. Being near him made her feel anchored.</p>
<p>“I know you might be upset. I am sorry. But I am still going to ask you the last question,” he said.</p>
<p>Aphrodite sighed.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to break off the marriage—” he began.</p>
<p>Aphrodite interrupted him with annoyance, “How many times do you intend to make me repeat myself?”</p>
<p>“This will be the last time,” he said.</p>
<p>“I have already said it, and I will say it again. I am not breaking off the marriage. Happy?” she said with annoyance, “Just get on with your last question then.”</p>
<p>He seemed self-conscious with the idea of asking the last question he had left. It almost looked as though he was avoiding it. But an oath was an oath, three questions were the agreement. He either had to risk it or forfeit the chance of asking the very last one.</p>
<p>Hephaestus seemed to have made up his mind. He said in all seriousness, “Okay, let me ask you the one question which I have left.”</p>
<p>Hephaestus stilled himself, looked her in the eye and asked, “Will you marry me, Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t much of a question. Their marriage had already been fixed by the King of the Gods himself. Whether they liked it or not, it would have ensued either way. But both of them knew that it was different, that this question meant a proposal that was made in earnest. No lies, no deceit.</p>
<p>Aphrodite looked into his gray eyes, she was aware of herself blushing and was embarrassed with that knowledge. This day had elongated from one weird encounter to another, but this moment was the strangest of all. She realized that this was what she had been waiting for, this one question that respected her enough to give her the choice to answer with whatever she wanted.</p>
<p>“I will,” she said, letting go of all doubts and queasiness that she had been holding within her.</p>
<p>She could see the joy and relief in his face that he tried so hard to keep impassive. She knew she didn’t have to worry about the oath now, because she had answered everything truthfully, with all her heart. She still had three questions that she was meant to ask him. But at this point, she couldn’t care less. She was so elated that, at this very instant, she wanted this moment to last forever.</p>
