            <p><strong>Chapter 16 – The Wedding Day</strong></p>
<p>At long last, the awaited wedding day has come.</p>
<p>Noise overwhelmed Aphrodite’s sanctuary still early in the day, when Eos, carrying the lanterns of the morning star, began to saunter along the sky path. Various goddesses and nymphs arrived, dressed for the new bride.</p>
<p>Artemis came early and sprinkled moonlight and starlight. Owing to him, Aphrodite’s skin glimmered like the moon and stars that dazzled the night sky. Demeter then came and showered the ground with a scent of a thousand flowers, and whenever Aphrodite’s footsteps kissed the ground, a scent of a fresh rose pervaded the sweet atmosphere.</p>
<p>And Athena, she tailored Aphrodite’s own wedding dress. It perfectly hugged Aphrodite’s body, accentuating her fine curves. Aphrodite, who beheld herself in the mirror, gave a laugh and said to Athena, “I always get my own clothes from the very beginning!”</p>
<p>“It’s the first time you’ve had ‘clothes’ today.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. Clothes are on my body. What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Athena was referring to what happened in Cyprus on the first day Aphrodite appeared in the shape of the gods. It was Athena’s first encounter with Aphrodite among the Olympus gods. She took off her cape and covered Aphrodite, who had just risen from the sea and had not a stitch on, before they set out to meet the other gods.</p>
<p>“Now, as I say, Athena. Thank you for that time.”</p>
<p>“You say greetings so early.”</p>
<p>“It’s better than never.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s like you.” Athena laughed.</p>
<p>Aphrodite stared at Athena through the mirror. It’s not something to say, but it was the luck of fate for Aphrodite that Athena was the first person she met in Cyprus.</p>
<p>Wisdom is needed to see beauty as beauty.</p>
<p>Those bereft of wisdom knew not how to tackle beauty— the reason why they ought to leave it untouched. And Aphrodite only realized now. They would yearn to have their desires satisfied, and if they couldn’t, they would rather tear it to pieces or send contempt for causing impulse and passion.</p>
<p>Aphrodite, who thought of Hephaestus and, to be exact, the questions they exchanged, crumpled her forehead.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Aphrodite?” questioned Athena.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your complexion, it looks like there’s something wrong.”</p>
<p>It was an accurate remark. Indeed, there was something wrong. A troublesome problem at that! Since the day she visited Hephaestus, nightmares had been a constant visitor of Aphrodite every other day. When she awoke, her memories had already left her, leaving only a part of her comfort. Aphrodite suspected those fleeting memories were her experiences in the past.</p>
<p>In her dream, she was the image of a young girl. It was like a time when she drifted across the sea before she arrived in Cyprus, or before she awoke to God. A time when other gods did not notice its existence because it had barely grown.</p>
<p>And it was very arbitrary. In Aphrodite’s own eyes, she felt that her temper was worse than it is now. She was easily agitated, unable to pacify her own anger, and the sea, which responded to her, created then a violent storm. Her presence was a terrible windfall for both sea creatures and human ships, unluckily passing by.</p>
<p><em>‘Where the hell are you?’</em></p>
<p>Young Aphrodite was always anxiously searching for something, and now she couldn’t figure it out. Because she in the past failed over and over again.</p>
<p>She had wandered over the sea as though in a chase for something, scouring every island she could see, but every time the outcome remained unchanging: she couldn’t find it. The same attempts and failures were tirelessly repeated. Still, for some reason, her pursuit didn’t end.</p>
<p>But the thing she earnestly sought for wasn’t anywhere.</p>
<p><em>‘You said you’d wait!’</em></p>
<p>She leaped angrily and wailed, unable to contain her frustration. She jumped into the waves and screamed evil.</p>
<p>What was she so desperate to find?</p>
<p>When she awoke from her dream, her cheeks were damp with tears, and all bitter emotions lingered like a stain, only disappearing after some time. But the worst thing was: even if all symbols and nuances coalesced into one conclusion, her dream remained a riddle still.</p>
<p>She called Morpheus and Pan, who manage dreams, to unravel the infuriating mystery. But to no avail. Neither of them could decipher it, nor had they ever imagined playing tricks on one of the twelve gods of Olympus.</p>
<p>In the end, Aphrodite, without earning any answer, threatened that she would drop them on Tartarus if they ever spoke to anyone of her visit before she dismissed the gods of dreams.</p>
<p>And she kept dreaming.</p>
<p>She still hasn’t grasped anything decisive. All that was certain was that Aphrodite had drifted across the sea longer than she thought and that the purpose of her wandering was to find something. However, as if they were sealed in the dark, the memories preceding her venture were never revealed to her.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>“Uh, uh?”</p>
<p>“Is there really something going on?”</p>
<p>Athena, she was not a bad person to ask for advice. But right now, it was difficult. There were too many listening ears, and most of all, the wedding ceremony was close at hand. Aphrodite shook her head, “Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Athena didn’t believe her word, but she didn’t probe anymore. This is why wisdom is a laudable virtue. Athena changed her words, “And I’m not even grateful for empty talk, so let me know whenever you need my help.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for that. I’ll remember.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite plastered a wide smile on her rosy lips as she met Athena’s eyes through the mirror. The two goddesses were much different, but they were nevertheless fond of each other.</p>
<p>Then, the curtain lifted and Hera’s voice sounded from outside.</p>
<p>“Is the bride ready?”</p>
<p>“She’s almost done.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you to start as soon as you come out.”</p>
<p>The insignia returned to its original position before Aphrodite could give a second answer. Hera left her seat.</p>
<p>“Ha, ha.”</p>
<p>“You can do that. She’s doing that because she doesn’t tolerate mistakes.” Athena comforted Aphrodite, who was laughing in vain.</p>
<p>Today, Hera took on the role of a mother who would take Aphrodite’s hand and walk her to the ceremony. Not as the groom’s mother, but as the queen of the gods and guardian of the family. In other words, the way Hera treated this marriage was thoroughly public. The reason was clear: she doesn’t consider Hephaestus as a son.</p>
<p>Aphrodite, who had heard of the story during her engagement, thought it was quite strange, but she didn’t put a word on it, because she had no reason nor right to interfere. As all gods of the same age do, it would be enough to coexist with an attitude of respecting each other’s territory.</p>
<p>Aphrodite only thought so. To be naive and complacent.</p>
