            <p><strong>Chapter 38 –</strong> <strong>Spiteful Exchange</strong></p>
<p>Of course, Aphrodite had not forgotten Hera’s words. In fact, it was a factor in her choosing Ares as the unwitting tool of her plot. As she just stood there in her own thoughts, relegating the Queen of the Gods’ tirade in the background of her mind, the latter said something which jolted the goddess of love’s attention.</p>
<p>“You dare despoil my son just because you couldn’t stand your husband’s ugliness?”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?” said Aphrodite, an unchecked frown making its way to her beautiful face now.</p>
<p>“You used my son like a rag!”</p>
<p>The goddess of love could not understand why her husband was suddenly being dragged into the conversation. Not only that, his mother was making a big deal out of his appearance. Aphrodite thought the god of fire’s face would never be considered fair, but neither could it be called ugly. Not by any stretch of the imagination. The more she thought about it, the more the goddess of love began to take offense at Hera’s words.</p>
<p><em>Everyone knows there’s no love lost between the two, but I didn’t know it was this bad</em>, thought Aphrodite. The dislike the Queen of the Gods held for her disfigured son was common knowledge, both in the mortal realm and the immortal. But it was one thing to hear about a rumor, and another to hear the actual person spitting venom with every syllable.</p>
<p>What the goddess of love didn’t know was that her husband had committed an unforgivable sin against his mother. Had she known, perhaps she would’ve thought twice before uttering her next words.</p>
<p>“I guess it takes one to know one, right? An ugly toad, I mean.”</p>
<p>“What did you just say?” responded Hera, her eyes bulging with shock. How dare this second-rate goddess talk back to her like this. She, the only being in the whole universe whom even Zeus was afraid of!</p>
<p>“I mean, it’s not like he had a father. So, the ugliness could only come from one source,” said Aphrodite, further goading her on even if she knew it wasn’t believable. After all, the only resemblance between the two was the color and shape of their eyes. The mother had scarlet eyes crowned with dark brown hair. Her son had a darker shade of red and almost-black hair.</p>
<p>Hera knew that all too well, which is why Aphrodite’s verbal arrow drove deep into her heart. If the mother’s disgust for her son wasn’t apparent to the goddess of love then, it was now.</p>
<p>“How dare you say something like that!” said the Queen of the Gods, the anger in her voice apparent now.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Hera, you really look like Hephaestus.”</p>
<p>“You’re being ridiculous!”</p>
<p>Seeing how a few words were causing Hera unexpected, barely-restrained rage Aphrodite kept up her barrage of mockery.</p>
<p>“It must be true that you are his mother!”</p>
<p>“Aphrodite!” yelled Hera as she stood up, trembling in fury.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. As the Goddess of Beauty, I’ll give you a word of advice. Look in the mirror before cursing your own son,” she responded, every syllable dripping with malice now. Aphrodite was considering whether she had pushed Hera to the brink, or whether she should continue. However, her opponent said something which made her lose control.</p>
<p>“You’re an arrogant, impudent wench.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Not only do you seem to be proud of engaging in such shameless acts, but you even have the gall to insult me when you should be begging me for forgiveness.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite burst into laughter.</p>
<p>If Hera began their conversation like this, Aphrodite would not have attacked. After all, she didn’t really do much with Ares anyway. But her mother-in-law made it personal the moment she dragged Hephaestus into it and insulted his very being. The goddess of love had planned to feign being penitent, nod her head all the time, and sprinkle a “Yes, queen” here and there. But she was sick of the goddess in front of her, and sick of this farce.</p>
<p>“Well, who started the name-calling?”</p>
<p>“Aphrodite! How dare you speak like that to me! I, as the Queen of Olympus…”</p>
<p>“Ha! You talk in such a way that would make the lowliest of humans blush and then suddenly, bring up your authority?”</p>
<p>Hera blushed in shame and fell silent, something Zeus would’ve never thought possible had he been present. But the goddess of love was not Zeus, and she pressed on.</p>
<p>“This is hilarious. If you didn’t like the fact that your handsome son was sleeping with me, you should go back to living with him like he’s a child. Take out your anger no him, not me?”</p>
<p>“How dare you, how dare you!”</p>
<p>“And you said Hephaestus was ugly? Sorry, but you are much, much more hideous”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Hera, but you are much more hideous.”</p>
<p>It looked as if this unpleasant encounter was coming to an end. Aphrodite stared at Hera, thinking she had won, when Hera picked something up with her trembling hand.<br>
