            <p><strong>Chapter 45 – Blank Minds</strong></p>
<p>He twisted Aphrodite’s arms behind her back, binding them together too tightly that the wrists united as one. Caught by surprise, Aphrodite tried to untangle herself but the unbreakable restraints were firmly fastened. Absorbed with the thoughts of freeing herself, she squirmed on the bed as Hephaestus sat down beside her. Without warning, he lifted Aphrodite and laid her face down on his lap. Helpless and unable to move, she felt like a pillow that he could merely toss around wherever he pleased.</p>
<p>Now she looked like a pathetic little child being punished for her mistake. The thing is, she was no longer a child but a grown beautiful woman, stark naked, and bound against her will.</p>
<p>“Hephaestus!” she cried in protest.</p>
<p>“You deserve being posed this way.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite struggled to change the way she was positioned, but she felt a gentle pressure on her neck restraining her movement. As she was about to put on a more aggressive fight, long fingers suddenly caressed the inside of her nude white thighs making her gasp.</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>Hephaestus felt his finger sucked by Aphrodite’s wet insides, welcoming him. “You’re already wet,” he smiled wickedly, thinking her outside protesting contrasted what was transpiring inside her.</p>
<p>“That’s…”  As she was about to object to his claim and blame it on smelling his scent, she heard his suddenly cold voice.</p>
<p>“Did Ares touch you?” His tone was biting. “Did he open you up and touch you?” By the sound of him, his questions need not to be answered; they were more of a statement. Declarations of criticism from a husband to his unfaithful wife. “Answer me Aphrodite. Did he touch you here?”</p>
<p>Although referring only to the part of her body where his finger was now exploring, the truth is, she had been touched by Ares in more places of her body than one. Unlike Hephaestus though, who has always been gentle with her, Ares inflicted her more pain than pleasure. Knowing that his question had nothing to do with how she felt, she remained silent.</p>
<p>“I see.” His tone was icy cold, cutting through her defense.</p>
<p>She gasped when he suddenly pressed her back down. Not minding her reaction, he continued to play her insides faster and stronger.</p>
<p>“Then it won’t be enough just by touching you like this.”</p>
<p>“Ha, ah, what?” With what his finger was doing to her, Aphrodite couldn’t think straight, let alone utter a coherent response.</p>
<p>“I made you something.”</p>
<p>Before she could turn around to see, she was presented a gold chain which had few marbles the size of a fingernail hanging from it. <em>What is this?</em> Aphrodite squinted with her lustful eyes, trying to identify what she’s looking at. “What is it?” she asked curiously when it was pulled away from her.</p>
<p>“Stay still.” Hephaestus didn’t reveal its identity, but he showed her its purpose. He wrapped the chain around her waist then pulled the remaining chain in between her legs.</p>
<p>She gasped again as she felt the cold chain touch the mound between her legs. It felt odd but not entirely unpleasant. The chain wasn’t heavy nor dangerous. Knowing that she was not to be hurt by it, the thought of being tied up aroused her even more.</p>
<p>Aphrodote flinched here and there as the chain was being fitted around her. When the small marbles rubbed against the sensitive spot between her legs, she found it difficult to obey in remaining very still. The tingling sensation made her breathing labored when the other marbles stroke her cl*toris as Hephaestus finished his adjustments. Then, with a flick of his finger, the chain suddenly came alive and started vibrating.</p>
<p>“Ha, agh, it feels weird, agh! Ah! It’s moving!”</p>
<p>Shocked by the sensation, Aphrodite tried to move her hips in response to what occured to the chain. The more she struggled and moved though, the more the marbles rubbed and stroked her.  As the chains tightened around her v*gina, her arousal tripled.</p>
<p>Hephaestus, as if not satisfied by what he was already doing with her, fingered her wet v*gina. “I’m sure it might be lacking but it should give you what you want.”</p>
<p>“What… this?”</p>
<p>“You already seem to be enjoying it down here.”</p>
<p>She knew he was right. She couldn’t hide the truth even if she wanted to deny it. Her body would only betray her as she was truly soaked and pulsating down below. The pleasure she was feeling not only made her drenched but she was generously dripping liquid of ecstasy. Her opening loosen and tightened its muscle in a sucking motion fully engulfing his playful finger inside her. With all her senses concentrating in what transpired within her womb, she lost all her will to talk and even think.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah, Hephaestus, this is, ah, too!”</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“No… no, ah!”</p>
<p>Unable to say anymore as she could not describe the pleasure of such experience, she only let her mind go blank and allowed her deliriousness to take over. She then burrowed her face on the bed, moaning, savoring such inexplicable euphoria she was feeling for the first time. All the while, Hephaestus thrusted his fingers inside her, rapturing her senses even more.</p>
<p>“Agh!”</p>
<p>Aphrodite’s body has a mind of its own now, as she neared a big release she could feel more liquid flowing down her thigh, then everything turned dark.<br>
