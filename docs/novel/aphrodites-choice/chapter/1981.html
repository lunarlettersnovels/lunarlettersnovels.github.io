            <p><strong>Chapter 48 – Fortunate Prisoner</strong></p>
<p>Wanting to hear Hephaestus climax and release his prodigious seed inside her womb, the goddess of love did something she had never done before. She clenched the muscles of her sexual organ as if it was another mouth hungrily devouring the god of fire’s shaft.</p>
<p>The effect was both instant and electric: Hephaestus let out a moan that threatened to render Aphrodite deaf as he grabbed her waist almost painfully. For her, she could feel every throbbing vein in his organ as he threatened to dig as deep as she could possibly allow.</p>
<p>The sensation was unlike anything she ever felt or even imagined before. With her mind overwhelmed, Aphrodite gushed between her legs as she felt every inch of her body melt. Her orgasm was so tremendous she skipped the stiffening phase and immediately collapsed onto the bed with a drawn-out gasp.</p>
<p>But Hephaestus wasn’t done. Keeping his grasp on her, he finally released his self-control and began to pump as hard and as fast as he could in a desire to enjoy the same mental explosion the goddess of love had. It was all too much for Aphrodite and her last thought before blacking out was: <em>More! I can’t take it anymore! More!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Her eyelids felt sticky, as if it was made of honey, a sign of extended slumber. She had to blink several times just to clear her vision. The first thing she saw was a thick, beefy arm wrapped around her body like a humongous snake. Spending most of one’s waking hours wielding a gigantic hammer would do that to anyone’s body, thought Aphrodite.</p>
<p>As her consciousness came back like a gentle stream, she began to reflect how touching it was that Hephaestus kept her in his arms the whole night. At least, she thought they were asleep all night. But then, one thought drowned out everything else. No, it wasn’t a thought. It was more of a sensation. That something foreign was lodged inside her and between her thighs. Something thick and foreign.</p>
<p>It seemed he fell asleep inside of her. He did not pull out. Aphrodite cursed silently, marvelling at how sexy that was.</p>
<p>If he had only done that during their wedding night, there would have been no need for all of the plotting and scheming the goddess of love had done, as well as the trouble it caused for many other residents of Olympus.</p>
<p>As if her thoughts awakened him, Hephaestus moved slightly, still half-asleep.</p>
<p>With her womb still sensitive from the pounding it received, Aphrodite let out a half a moan before she bit down her lips in embarrassment. Too late.</p>
<p>“Are you awake?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay if you want to sleep more.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite wanted to say, “Sleep is the last thing on my mind right now,” but for some reason, she didn’t. In fact, she had an irrational desire to clamp down on the heat that was beginning to crawl all over her body again. It was all for nothing, however, as her body betrayed her. One of Hephaestus’ hands came up to her breast and found out that her nipple was already standing erect, as if beckoning him to do as he wished.</p>
<p>“Don’t pull it out.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“Let’s do it my way this time.”</p>
<p>In response, Hephaestus removed the arm around her and pulled out, much to Aphrodite’s chagrin. As she was about to utter an indignant protest, her husband grabbed her with that titanic strength and hoisted her on his shoulder effortlessly.</p>
<p>“You should probably wash up.”</p>
<p>His wife barely swallowed a profanity. What was the point of telling this oaf what she wanted? But these thoughts of fury washed away like the rain when she saw where her husband was taking her.</p>
<p>At first glance, it looked like a small pond. However, the water in it was bubbling and steam was everywhere. The smell of rotten eggs confirmed her suspicions.</p>
<p>“It’s a hot spring,” he explained.</p>
<p>“I know. But I never know there was one in Olympus?”</p>
<p>“I made it. You can do many things with Mount Etna’s lava.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite eyed the hot spring with curiosity. She had heard that the water from such a source had many benefits yet she never got around to trying it out as there wasn’t one in her sanctuary. Without urging, she slipped off Hephaestus’ arms and bounded into the spring. Wordlessly, he made a movement with his fingers to cast a spell to lessen the brunt of the heat on the goddess of love’s skin. The result was that the water’s temperature was right on the boundary between pleasurable and painful.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear. It’s good. Very good”</p>
<p>Her body, exhausted from intense lovemaking all night, welcomed the water’s embrace. Aphrodite closed her eyes as she started humming a tune to herself.</p>
<p>Because she closed her eyes, she did not see Hephaestus’ expression. He looked at her with desperate glances as if expecting something from her. Then he looked down in disappointment, as if he hadn’t gotten what he wanted.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Fifteen days and fifteen nights had passed since Hephaestus ensnared Ares and Aphrodite and dragged away the latter. It felt like she was a prisoner, except that she was treated well. Considering how the god of fires almost never went to the subject of her infidelity, his wife thought she was lucky.</p>
<p>With the ravaging of her body took for hours each day, she was indeed very fortunate.<br>
