            <p><strong>Chapter 10 – The Beautiful Intruder</strong></p>
<p>Aphrodite herself is the absolute standard of beauty that existed, but it only meant that anyone is ugly compared to her. There would be no point in comparison. In Aphrodite’s perspective as a judge of beauty, the evaluation of Hephaestus’ appearance was rather poor than real.</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes at him and delved in thought.</p>
<p>He was slightly crooked but tall, with a defined nose, and a slightly overdeveloped jaw, which was worth considering as masculine. In particular, thick lips were his advantage that other gods did not have. It was attractive. <em>I’d like to have a look at it, and the feeling of it rubbing against my skin would be pretty good…</em></p>
<p>As her thoughts reached such, her desire began to rise. Aphrodite, unwittingly licking her lower lip, took a step forward.</p>
<p>And screamed with fright.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Around the place where Aphrodite stepped, two cubits of floor space, about a hundred centimeters, from left to right soared high. There was nothing strange about it; it was constructed by Hephaestus himself.</p>
<p>It happened so quickly that she couldn’t avoid it. Aphrodite was caught on top of a square pillar that almost reached the ceiling.</p>
<p>Surely enough, the disturbance caught the attention of Hephaestus. Hephaestus, who put down the hammer, slowly approached Aphrodite. A distant low voice caught her in the ear with a stern sound.</p>
<p>“Who dares enter without permission?”</p>
<p>Hephaestus seemed livid, which was only expected. He was immersed in his work, only to be disturbed by an intruder. Aphrodite felt a little, little sorry. The pillar began to descend slowly. Aphrodite was deliberately looking elsewhere but was left with no escape the moment Hephaestus’ gaze poked holes on the side of her face.</p>
<p>She greeted him with a lovely smile, “Hello.” She even waved her hands shamelessly as if she had made an appointment in advance.</p>
<p>Hephaestus’ glowering red eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>“Ha, ha.”</p>
<p>His next reaction, however, was unexpected.</p>
<p>“You can’t be…”</p>
<p><em>You? </em>Aphrodite frowned. But to argue, Hephaestus seemed to have no idea what he had said. She hadn’t observed him in detail before, and she grasped the opportunity now.</p>
<p>He was calm at the insult of his stepbrother, but he seemed to have lost his composure when he saw her. Not only surprised that the intruder was a different god but for more than that.</p>
<p><em>What’s wrong with him?</em> Aphrodite tilted her head and scratched her cheek lightly. It was simply habitual behavior, as long as she did not realize it. But Hephaestus responded greatly to Aphrodite’s subtle gestures. His dark eyebrows raised, and his eyes deepened as the embers hidden in the ashes spread.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Aphrodite was startled by the feeling of tightness in her chest and was surprised once again that she had such a feeling.</p>
<p><em>Why, why is my stomach shaking so much?</em></p>
<p>She felt nauseous. It was hard to tell whether or not it was because of emotions that seemed to be hers, or because of the floor that stopped at an unfavorable height.</p>
<p>Either way, it wasn’t desirable. Aphrodite closed her eyes and shouted. It was almost the same time that Hephaestus, who had left his lips dry without a word, spoke.</p>
<p>“Memories.”</p>
<p>“First let me down now and then talk, Hephaestus.”</p>
<p>The first word of Hephaestus didn’t reach her ears. The same was true for his next words.</p>
<p>“…Maybe not.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Come down.”</p>
<p>Hephaestus listened to Aphrodite without a hitch. A light gesture brought the engine back to its full position. She had a moment’s delay in thinking what to say, then he asked first.</p>
<p>“How did you get in here?”</p>
<p>“I asked where you were, ordered nymphs to guide me, opened the door, and walked in on my feet.”</p>
<p>“I mean, no one stopped you.”</p>
<p>“Your clogged servant said no to me.”</p>
<p>“Of course you would have ignored it.”</p>
<p>Somehow she felt like she was a child who was struggling helplessly. Aphrodite raised her chin and grumbled, “It’s not like I shouldn’t be here. Or would you say that I presumably came into a place where even Zeus couldn’t?”</p>
<p>Hephaestus wrinkled his forehead.</p>
<p>“Did Barreus say so?”</p>
<p>“A lot like it.”</p>
<p>“That remark made you angry. I’ll give him a good scolding.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite opened her eyes wide. It wasn’t because she felt sorry that Barreus would be scolded by his master. For her, conscience only existed for the gods in equal ranks, but not for other people’s households.</p>
<p>Of course, she didn’t visit him for an empty talk. Come to think of it, isn’t this a kind of hospitality? There was no reason to tell him not to do so when he said he would punish those who stopped her from entering.</p>
