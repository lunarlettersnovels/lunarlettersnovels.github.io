            <p><strong>Chapter 61 – Behind the Contempt</strong></p>
<p>Aphrodite and Hephaestus lay on his bed in his room, holding each other in their arms. “I went back to Limnos to try to find you,” he said.</p>
<p>“Really?” she asked, looking at him.</p>
<p>“It was too late,” he said sadly, “I asked the earth spirits about you. They had seen everything that the Erinyes did to you.”</p>
<p>“They saw me?” she asked, surprised.</p>
<p>He nodded. “They told me they followed you because you were crying,” he said, “They saw everything, but they were scared. The Erinyes are much more powerful than them, so they hid.”</p>
<p>“That’s how you knew,” she recalled, “At the wedding. You knew I was tricked by them. I am an idiot.”</p>
<p>“Don’t blame yourself,” he said, stroking her hand, “The ones who deceived you are at fault. And me, being the reason that led to it. I stayed in Limnos for a while, hoping that you would return. I wandered around the Aegean Sea, but I couldn’t find you.” His voice was bitter.</p>
<p>“We might have missed each other,” she said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, “So, I went back to Olympus. I knew you would eventually come there, being an Olympian.”</p>
<p>That was what had happened. Aphrodite had reached Olympus in her journey. But the wait was painful, because none knew when they would be able to cross each other. Aphrodite, for her part, didn’t even have her memories of him.</p>
<p>“I should have been able to recognize you,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Why did it take so long?”</p>
<p>“Because the Erinyes are cunning,” he said, “They wouldn’t have made it that easy.”</p>
<p>“What?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Their terms for the bet couldn’t be fulfilled by you meeting me,” he explained, “Your heart was the key.”</p>
<p>“My heart?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It was not just you returning to me physically,” he said, “Your heart had to return to me, too.”</p>
<p>Hearing him say it, Aphrodite thought it was true. Her memories had nudged her whenever her heart had wavered upon seeing him. “I had no faith, no confidence,” she said, and buried her face deeper into his chest.</p>
<p>She was ashamed of the fact. But she was here now, and she wasn’t leaving again, nor would she allow him to leave. She hoped he wouldn’t look so lonely anymore. He seemed to smile a little as he stroked her hair and calmed her.</p>
<p>“Ares’ trial ended that day, in accordance with Hera’s wishes,” he said, “Which means I testified against the truth. I wasn’t able to be free from her, not until I became a full-fledged, adult god after a few years.”</p>
<p>“She held you captive until then?” said Aphrodite, scrunching her face.</p>
<p>“She didn’t exactly bind me and imprison me,” he said, smiling bitterly, “But she did place very strict restrictions that I wasn’t able to break.”</p>
<p>“That woman is outrageous,” she said angrily, “She should be put behind bars.” Hephaestus laughed.</p>
<p>“I know she is your mother,” she said, “But why is she so brutal to you? That is why Ares is the same. He thinks he can own anybody in any way he wants.” She gritted her teeth in anger. “The more I think about it, the angrier I get. If I had my memories earlier, I would have shown her a thing or two.”</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, chuckling, “I heard that you already did quite a number on Lady Hera.”</p>
<p>“It’s not even close to what I want to do to her, for what she put you through,” she raged.</p>
<p>He laughed. His chest shook with his laughter. Aphrodite buried her head deeper into his chest and inhaled. “Mm,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” he asked, smiling.</p>
<p>“I like your smell,” she said, “I am trying to forget my anger this way.”</p>
<p>He was silent. Aphrodite wondered if she had crossed a line. Feeling a little embarrassed, she drew back a little from his arms, only to be pulled back in. She heard him chuckling above her head.</p>
<p>“You really drive me crazy, you know,” he said.</p>
<p>“Mmm, why?” she asked.</p>
<p>“We aren’t done talking, yet,” he said, “Hold your little antics to yourself for a while, alright? I am having trouble holding myself back.”</p>
<p>She smiled bashfully at him. She kissed him on his chest. He gasped. “Aphrodite…” he said hoarsely.</p>
<p>“Once isn’t good enough for me, I suppose,” she said as she kissed him again. “I am greedy, but you know that. Well, you can talk now. I am finished.” She tried to sound nonchalant. He let out a breath.</p>
<p>“I might forget what I was going to say,” he said, with difficulty.</p>
<p>“Oh, alright,” she said, “I will keep myself to myself till you are done.”</p>
<p>It seemed her words weren’t enough. He sat up and held her tight so she couldn’t move. His chin resting on top of her head.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on,” she protested, “Must you really do this?”</p>
<p>“If I don’t,” he said, “you will try something again, which will make me unable to think. And I have much to say to you, that might even anger you”</p>
<p>Aphrodite listened, attentively. “The day I returned to Olympus,” he began, “I found out the reason for Hera’s hatred towards me.” The sentence did make her anger flare. Hera’s name was enough to make her angry these days.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” she asked vehemently, “Why does she hate you then?”</p>
<p>“It is because I look like Kronos,” he said bitterly.<br>
