            <p><strong>Chapter 49 – Creations of the Blacksmith God</strong></p>
<p>With a click, a ring-shaped device attached to her clitor*s. Aphrodite felt it tighten gently around the flesh. Gently, but it caused a powerful sensation all the same and she trembled while mumbling incoherently.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I crafted it so that it will stop just short of being painful.”</p>
<p><em>As are all your other creations</em>, thought the goddess of love, marveling at all the works of her husband: The Chair of Restraint, the Platinum Rod, and the Clitor*s Clamp. That the Blacksmith God would use the same hands that forge weapons for the residents of Olympus to make devices solely for her pleasure was a thought that warmed her all over.</p>
<p>That was until Hephaestus began to use them on her. Now, she was no longer warm. Her skin, the space between her thighs, and everywhere else felt like it was on fire. Aphrodite’s heart fluttered madly as if it was trying to escape the body burning almost literally with desire.</p>
<p>She recalled a seat which had an imitation of a man’s rod protruding from its seat. Another time, her husband had attached devices shaped like a man’s mouth all over her body. While Aphrodite was blindfolded, these objects licked her with their faux tongues, or bit and sucked at her with false teeth and lips.</p>
<p>Despite all of her extraordinary experiences, the goddess of love felt something was missing. It wasn’t for lack of satisfaction. On the contrary, Aphrodite and Hephaestus ended each day with the latter utterly exhausted. But her husband’s refusal to use his own shaft against her wet, inviting hole drove her crazy. For the past two weeks, he had done virtually everything but that.</p>
<p>One time she had asked and his response was a simple “I don’t have confidence.”</p>
<p>She found it unbelievable. No matter how many times Aphrodite tried to reassure him of the sufficiency of his rod, and her desire for it, he couldn’t seem to believe her. Or perhaps he didn’t want to believe it. But how could he, thought Aphrodite, since they had already been together on their wedding night. Surely, he saw who much he drove her to the heights of ecstasy.</p>
<p>There was another time where she begged him with tears in her eyes. She was sure he would be moved but instead, he just said: “With this, you will be satisfied” as he took another one in his endless series of devices.</p>
<p>“No! No! Please no!”</p>
<p>The rod, which had only rotated in a fixed position until now, began to move back and forth.</p>
<p>Like the others he used on her before, the objects Hephaestus created moved very much like his own rod. It pressed exactly where Aphrodite would feel most stimulated, rubbed the insides of her trembling inner walls, and instinctively thrust forward as soon as her insides contracted.</p>
<p>There was one time where Aphrodite became so exhausted at the end of their seemingly endless sessions that she literally couldn’t lift a finger. Her husband had to undo the straps that held her to another device and hoist her up his shoulders.</p>
<p>While she was soaking blissfully in the hot spring, Hephaestus said, “Did you like it?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“That’s too bad. What was the problem?”</p>
<p>Annoyed that he still couldn’t get what she had been telling him all along, she spit out with more venom than she intended to the following words: “It’s smaller than yours.”</p>
<p>“It’s nearly exactly the same.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like you made it while looking at yours.”</p>
<p>“No matter what I make, my estimates have never been wrong.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Truly amazing,” she responded, rolling her eyes in exasperation as she knew her words failed to penetrate his thick skull yet again.</p>
<p>“Get some rest, then,” he responded, again oblivious to the sarcasm. As was his habit, he would leave as soon as she had fully immersed herself in the water. She closed her eyes as she knew the conversation was at an end. But then she felt a light touch on her neck and then the words “I’ll be back.”</p>
<p>But when she turned her head, he was already gone.</p>
<p><em>Ah, that’s really too bad</em>. She licked her lips, straightening her posture, and slid her body deeper into the water.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Aphrodite, Aphrodite!” said a voice as it pierced the goddess of love’s sleeping consciousness. She wanted to tell that voice to leave her alone as she was still sleepy, but only a groggy moan came out.</p>
<p>The voice continued, insistent, and then she felt a hand grab her shoulder and shake her incessantly. Aphrodite frowned as this was very much unlike Hephaestus. Before, he would always let her sleep as much as he wanted. And he was never pushy.</p>
<p>“Hey, Aphrodite!? Hey! Wake up!”</p>
<p>She suddenly recognized that voice. It wasn’t the deep, calm baritone of her husband. It was the annoyingly arrogant tone of the god of war, Ares. Aphrodite turned towards the voice and opened her eyes to the sight of those red eyes staring at her hungrily.</p>
<p>“How did you get in here, Ares?”</p>
<p>“Where there’s a will, there’s a way. But we’ll save that for later. Quickly, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“What?” responded the goddess of love, her brain still struggling to understand what’s happening. <em>Go where</em>, she thought as she pulled her hand away from the war god’s crushing grip as if it was the most disgusting thing in the universe.</p>
<p>Ares seemed genuinely perplexed at her answer, saying, “We don’t have time, we have to go before that bastard comes back.” Aphrodite frowned, offended as she understood that he meant no one but her husband, the blacksmith god. Oblivious, he continued, saying, “Come with me, and I’ll take care of everything.”</p>
<p>“Take care of what?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to demand Zeus that he holds a trial. Everyone in Olympus knows about how he keeps you as a captive here, and that he mistreats you.”</p>
<p>“What, no!” said Aphrodite passionately. True, her husband did not allow her to pass through the walls of his sanctuary. That much was true. But treated badly? Her experience with Hephaestus the past few weeks were quite the opposite! She would’ve boasted about it to shut up the arrogant yet insecure god in front of her, but she felt that the blacksmith god would become embarrassed if all of their escapades became public.</p>
