            <p><strong>Chapter 20 – The Island of Limnos</strong></p>
<p>But Hephaestus’ nervousness was uncovered in his stiffened back. Fortunately, it was only Aphrodite who could notice his disguised front. Despite so, Hephaestus spoke as though he was not afraid. “Don’t bother her and talk to me.”</p>
<p>Erinyes purple lips moved. Her mouth curled upwards, as if she was smiling, but the voice that followed was more barbarous than it had been.</p>
<p>[I’m telling you not to disturb.]</p>
<p>[How could you dare to get involved in the conversation that Uranos’ children share?]</p>
<p>Even Aphrodite could no longer be unfazed, but Hephaestus did not yield nor tremble, and said, “I’m qualified for it.” At his words, Tisiphone, without a doubt this time, clicked her tongue.</p>
<p>[You’re qualified? Hephaestus of Olympus, you?]</p>
<p>“You know me,” replied Hephaestus.</p>
<p>[I heard you’re the groom of the day. Hera’s son, the grandson of Cronus. So know your place and keep your mouth shut.]</p>
<p>Aphrodite frowned as Erinyes called Hephaestus as Hera’s son. Nonetheless, Hephaestus answered casually, “No, I won’t.”</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>“You don’t know me all. As for my qualification, I have something to say.”</p>
<p>The already frozen atmosphere turned even colder, caused by the fury of Erinyes.</p>
<p>[Child, you don’t have to talk because you have an open mouth.]</p>
<p>[Do you want to be locked up forever and suffer in exchange for your rudeness?]</p>
<p>As Aphrodite looked around, wondering what the strange sound was, she realized that the space had been twisted without their knowing. Only herself, Hephaestus and Erinyes were entrapped by the magical sphere Erinyes had created. She caught a glimpse of Zeus’ puzzled expression; his mouth moved as if he was talking to them, but his words were obscured. They only sounded like a roar in the water. Perhaps it was the same with what was spoken within.</p>
<p>Aphrodite never thought the power of Erinyes was this powerful! Aphrodite belatedly regretted having taken them lightly. What if they could never escape from Erinyes’ strange spell?  Unlike Aphrodite, who was beginning to panic, Hephaestus remained calm. His gaze remained at Erinyes, resolute and unwavering. Then, he brought up a random remark, “The island’s name is Limnos.”</p>
<p>[What are you talking about?]</p>
<p>“Humans raise almonds and olives and make cheese out of their sheep’s milk. A part of it is dedicated to the altar of the volcano in the northeast.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite was perplexed. Did she lose her mind for a moment and miss the context? What was he talking about all of a sudden, this man? she wondered. However, if truth be told, Hephaestus was alluding to his sanctuary. The volcano of Limnos was Moskils, and the altar there was his temple. But it was still a mystery why he had mentioned his home. Erinyes’ thoughts seemed to be the same as those of Aphrodite.</p>
<p>[Shut up if you want to talk nonsense.]</p>
<p>[Don’t disturb us anymore, but step away from our youngest sister.]</p>
<p>Then, Erinyes spread out her wide wings, its black claws stretched threateningly, and with a few flutters, a gust of dreary wind blew.</p>
<p>“Oh, god.” Aphrodite was frightened, and yet angry at Erinyes. It was disrespectful enough to interrupt one’s special day, but how dare she flaunt her strength! The daughter of Uranus, the executor of the world, however, couldn’t be simply thwarted. Aphrodite had not forgotten her nil chance of winning, but she too couldn’t easily accept her defeat.</p>
<p>But Aphrodite couldn’t come at Erinyes. She muttered, hopelessness in her words, “I can’t stop, this…”</p>
<p>“Erinyes!” Hephaestus roared loudly. His deep voice pierced the wind and reached Erinyes. The wings that flapped violently silenced. Indeed, Hephaestus was a man born to quell rage. <em>It would suit him to be the anchor god. </em>While Aphrodite drifted in her thoughts, Hephaestus spoke to Erinyes. “You know the place I told you about, so is what happened there.”</p>
<p>[We do not know the island of Limnos.]</p>
<p>“First, almonds, olives, flocks, and volcanoes have been there for a long time. And…” The hand of Hephaestus, who held Aphrodite, was strained. “The pearl that fell on the western sandbar.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite frowned, her ears failing to fathom his words. What happened on the island? It seemed easier to solve the prophecy that Apollo deliberately twisted. But Erinyes seemed to understand. The fluttering wings were completely folded, and the snake, which brandished its venom, closed its muzzle.</p>
