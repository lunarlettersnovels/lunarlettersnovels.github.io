            <p><strong>Chapter 25 – Drunk in Passion (II)</strong></p>
<p>Her hips began to rock of their own accord. Whenever Hephaestus pulled back a little, she canted her hips after him, trying to keep him against her. Instinctively, she lifted her legs and wrapped them around his hips. Hephaestus avoided her by using one hand to gently press down on her pelvis.</p>
<p>“Aah, H-Hephaest-tus!”</p>
<p>“Don’t be so rash. You’ll hurt yourself.”</p>
<p>She didn’t want to listen to him. <em>Even if I can’t move my legs, I still have two arms right here! </em>She reached out to wrap them around his neck, but even that failed. Hephaestus snatched both of her wrists in one hand and pinned them down over her head.</p>
<p>“W-why are you doing this?” she whined.</p>
<p><em>Even if I was tied up in chains, it would be difficult to feel more helpless than this. </em>Aphrodite realized that she was completely bound by Hephaestus. Helpless. Intense excitement fluttered in her belly and her breath got faster.</p>
<p>“Aah…ah…”</p>
<p>“Stay still,” said Hephaestus, stroking her thigh with his large hand.</p>
<p>His palms were scaly with calluses, which was a novel sensation for a goddess like Aphrodite, who rarely had to lift a finger. But his swede, gentle, even prudish caresses only made it more difficult for her to bear. It was simple skin-to-skin contact, but it felt as if he’d poured sugar on her. She willingly pressed her leg into his hand and let out a sweet moan.</p>
<p>“Aaah…”</p>
<p>Hephaestus gently plumped and squeezed the soft flesh, asking, “Does it hurt?”</p>
<p><em>There’s no way this could hurt!</em></p>
<p>“I like it,” she panted. “I like it. Touch me more. Touch me inside.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>His finger slipped into her already-slipper flesh. He brushed spread the dripping liquid around her l@bia, groping the flushed, swollen flesh to find her opening. Her juices had accumulated to the point of overflowing, soaking Hephaestus’s fingers and dripping onto the bed.</p>
<p>“You’re wet.”</p>
<p>“I-I know that!”</p>
<p>Hephaestus seemed to make up his mind about something and sat up. He grasped Aphrodite’s legs and placed them on his shoulders, rising onto his knees. Doing this made her entire lower half float in the air. She flushed with embarrassment at the undignified position.</p>
<p>“Wait!”</p>
<p>“Are you uncomfortable?”</p>
<p>The bed was soft, and she was putting all her weight on Hephaestus, so she wasn’t uncomfortable, but she was embarrassed at being so spread open and vulnerable to the man in front of her. He could see everything.</p>
<p>Pretending to be calm, she asked, “What are you trying to do?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s enough.”</p>
<p>“W-what do you mean…ah!”</p>
<p>Without warning, Hephaestus buried his face between her thighs. He pressed his lips against her l@bia as if he were kissing them, then spread her open with his thick tongue to stroke against her insides.</p>
<p>“Ah, wait, ah! Haah!”</p>
<p>Aphrodite struggled in surprise, but he hugged her belly to take control of her. He wasn’t satisfied with just a sample of her taste, so he doubled down and started sucking on her. <em>Slurp, slurp. </em>The lewd, vulgar sounds rang through the bedchamber. The people down on Earth would never imagine such sounds coming from a coupling of the gods.</p>
<p>Aphrodite trembled in silence, unable to speak. Every time Hephaestus sucked on her, it felt as if stars were exploding behind her eyes. She didn’t notice, too lost in ecstasy, but the god himself was out of his mind with desire.</p>
<p>At first, he’d been doing it to make sure she was aroused enough to accept him, but the moment her juices hit his tongue, he lost control of himself. He pressed his nose against where her scent was most intense, and sucked, licked, and swallowed her. It was never enough; he thirst for more. The liquid flowing out of her was like a fragrant poison. The moment he stopped licking at her, his throat burned for more.</p>
<p>No, that wasn’t right. Whatever came from her was sweet. Both the juice flowing out of her when he probed her with his tongue and the soft golden hair that rubbed against his brow were delicacies. What truly drove him wild was her cl!toris, swollen from stimulation and glistening. Every time he licked and sucked that little pearl bead, she fluttered against him. Her slender waist arched, her plush thighs trembled, and her rounded chest heaved up and down.</p>
