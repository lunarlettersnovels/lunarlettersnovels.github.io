            <p><strong>Chapter 3 – Indifference Toward Beauty</strong></p>
<p>“How about me, Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>It was a young man with a young face who caught her attention. When their eyes met, he smiled and waved his hands, and the divinity was revealed from his appearance as a Greek juvenile soldier.</p>
<p>Aphrodite sarcastically towards Hermes. “You have a big dream. On the subject of a small kid.”</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s too much! If you say that, I’m hurt.” Hermes held his heart and cried. Aphrodite, of course, snorted without even lifting an eyebrow.</p>
<p>Hermes was the most crafty writer in Olympus, even though he pretended to be harmless by the appearance of an adult of an age. The word “undergrown” was an indication of his outward appearance but at the same time a reflection of the state of his mind.</p>
<p>What would be so great to expect from a man, but at least it was an envoy to hit Hermes.</p>
<p>“Shut it off.” Aphrodite spat out chilly, and turned her back around against Hermes. Now there were two left.</p>
<p><em>Oh my, it’s just two of them.</em></p>
<p>The first thing that caught her eye was Ares. The God of War grinned with open chests and raised chin. Even if he didn’t have to show off his masculinity, his elated face showed clearly what he was thinking. Ares was convinced he was Aphrodite’s husband.</p>
<p>She enjoyed his smooth face and reckless expressions, so she responded several times. But was it enough to convince her?</p>
<p>Aphrodite stared into Ares’ face. His nose stood beautifully under a lock of his golden hair, but she had the urge to hit it hard rather than pat it. Unfortunately, she couldn’t really do that, so she had to put up with it. The goddess looked away, swallowing a faint sigh.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>And the moment she saw the last groom candidate, Aphrodite noticed that there was one more reason for Ares’s confidence.</p>
<p>The lame god, the only ugly man in Olympus, and the ugly child that Hera gave birth to alone.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Hephaestus was expressionless.</p>
<p>Does he have no idea that he is compared at a glance to Ares where they sit side by side? Or does it not matter?</p>
<p>At any rate, he stared at Aphrodite with an unknowable look, uttering not a single word. It was unclear whether he had nothing to say or simply did not want to say anything.</p>
<p>Aphrodite felt a strange sense of hopelessness.</p>
<p>If it were a man, Aphrodite could read his mind without using God’s power. She didn’t have any special ability, but she could decipher all the thoughts that were evident through their eyes.</p>
<p><em>‘Beautiful, I want it,’ they would scream. The desire for absolute beauty was so intense that even the transcendent of Olympus could not endure.</em></p>
<p>The gods of this place, who reign at the top, were not much different. Even Apollo, who was wary of Aphrodite, was actually unwilling because he was tempted by her unconsciously…</p>
<p>But Hephaestus was different.</p>
<p>He seemed to have no feeling in front of Aphrodite. His grayish red eyes were as rigid as the dead volcano, and they could not find even admiration, let alone desire.</p>
<p><em>No way. How could he do that?</em> Aphrodite glared at Hephaestus.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite ignored Zeus’s call and stared only at Hephaestus. There was no significant response, however. Her eyes met the eyes of the man before her and felt anger.</p>
<p>She was a deity who was worshipped as an existential, flawless beauty, the ultimate ideal common to all the people of the desire. To such a goddess of love and beauty, nothing? This was impossible.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>If Zeus hadn’t called again, Aphrodite would have approached Hephaestus and grabbed him by the collar. But she couldn’t pretend not to hear the voice of the Lord’s power permeating. She turned her head away, swallowing her irritation.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Zeus, with a hazy smile, opened his mouth. “That’s enough.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“If you like the groom, it’s a pleasure as a matchmaker, but I’m not asking you to have a wedding today.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite raised her eyebrows. That was why Zeus’s words were out of the blue. Isn’t it too much to interrupt, putting an end to what he ordered in the first place? Not only her, but other gods seemed to have not understood Zeus.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Let’s hold the ceremony as soon as possible and be blessed by all.”</p>
<p>“That’s why… What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Was I wrong?” Zeus seemed to enjoy the situation. It was childish to say that he felt joy by making his opponent feel frustrated, unable to speak with coherence.</p>
<p><em>Are you paying me back for being sarcastic about moving women around? </em>Aphrodite clicked her tongue and wondered what to say.</p>
<p>But Zeus was a step ahead of her deciding what to say.</p>
<p>“Because you were staring at your groom so intensely, I thought it had come true, even though I haven’t spoken to him yet.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>It was too obvious what he meant; asking would only appear ridiculous. Aphrodite opened her mouth, and so did the other gods.</p>
