            <p><strong>Chapter 63 – Justice</strong></p>
<p>“You still don’t believe me?” asked Aphrodite, “Even though I am a mess for you right now?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that,” he said, embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Mmm,” she mumbled. She had intended to seduce him, but she, in turn, had gotten aroused. She pulled down the fabric and revealed her chest. “I like everything that you do to me,” she said, “I even love your little instruments.”</p>
<p>“Should I go get them?” he asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>“No,” she said, “It’s you I love.” She pulled him close, her breast against his chest. She whispered in his ear, “Do whatever you want to me.” She kissed him. “But for now, just you,” she said, “I want only you.”</p>
<p>“Will that be enough?” he asked, his voice low.</p>
<p>“Yes, please,” she said, straining against him, “Hurry.”</p>
<p>He looked conflicted for a moment, then his large hands embraced her. As he gave in to her seduction, he laughed aloud in his own happiness.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The word of Ares having invaded Hephaestus’ sanctuary and having gotten crushed underneath a boulder had spread like wildfire in Olympus. Hermes was to be thanked for that. He had spread the gossip far and wide, as he had been witnessing the whole thing from a nearby village. It gave his boring existence something to live for, in his own words.</p>
<p>Hence, by the time Hephaestus and Aphrodite were done with each other and had gotten dressed. The twelve Olympians had arrived in their sanctuary. “Hello everyone!” said Zeus grandly, “It has been far too long since we all have gathered like this.”</p>
<p>“Aphrodite!” Zeus put on a smile as he saw her coming out to greet them.</p>
<p>Aphrodite put on a sardonic smile. “My, my, to what do I owe the pleasure?” said Aphrodite in mock happiness, “Why are all the Olympians milling about my porch. You could have knocked.”</p>
<p>“The door was closed,” said Zeus, “And we didn’t want to disturb.”</p>
<p>“Oh Zeus, ever so polite,” smiled Aphrodite, “What’s the use of a closed door when your son has already found it in his authority to break into the household?”</p>
<p>Zeus’ smile became strained. He was, at the least, pretending to be courteous, which was so much more than what some other Olympians could manage at the moment. Aphrodite would have rebuked him more, since he was not excused from ill-treatment of Hephaestus as well. But she wasn’t so mad at him as she was with Hera. Zeus, as the King of the Gods, had indeed treated Hephaestus fairly, so she had no grievances towards him.</p>
<p>“You rude brat,” said Hera vehemently, “Hand Ares over.”</p>
<p>With Hera, though, Aphrodite had no qualms about holding back her wrath. She looked around to see Ares still squashed under the boulder. “Must you keep him like that?” said Hera, her voice shaking. “It is very brutal. He must be completely disfigured under that thing!”</p>
<p>Hera’s plight was accompanied by a snort of laughter from the back. Was it Athena? Apollo? Artemis? Whoever it was, they had no affection for Ares. Perhaps most of the gods were dragged along by the Queen of the Gods, unwillingly, to protest for the release of Ares. Who could refuse Hera when she went on a rampage, anyway? Hera spun around to direct a death glare at anyone that was laughing.</p>
<p>Aphrodite smiled radiantly. “Well, it’s only fair to take back what’s left of him, I think,” obliged Aphrodite, “But that’s not for me to decide.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that, you impudent fool?” thundered Hera.</p>
<p>“This sanctuary belongs to Hephaestus,” said Aphrodite happily, “It belonged to Hephaestus when your son deemed it fit to invade it, and it still belongs to him when you are here to take the perpetrator back. So, it is only logical that you should ask for permission from the owner of the sanctuary. It would be preferable if we all keep our heads and settle these like rational gods. By which I mean, please maintain a tone of respect and politeness while asking for permission.”</p>
<p>“Aphrodite, there is no need—” said Hephaestus hastily.</p>
<p>“There is every need,” Aphrodite cut him off. “He is an intruder that posed a threat to you, and me. We need to hold a trial to punish the perpetrator like civilized beings. He tried to hurt you! If we let criminals go just like that, what other evil schemes will there be in the future to hurt us again? Can you guarantee everything will be alright?” Aphrodite directed a glare at Hephaestus to shut him up.</p>
<p>“He tried to hurt him?” asked Zeus, incredulously. “Is that true, Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord Zeus,” said Aphrodite, “He declared with much pomp that he was here to kill him. It is a serious crime for an Olympian god to kill another, is it not?” Aphrodite indicated the gash of the wound on Hephaestus’ forehead. “You can see the evidence for yourself.” The gods were flabbergasted. They gasped as they saw the wound on his forehead was deep.<br>
