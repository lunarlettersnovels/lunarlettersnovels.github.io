        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 7 – Kestos Himas</strong></p>
<p>Although he does not belong to the twelve deities of Olympus because he resides in the underworld, Hades was included in the supreme deity as Zeus’ brother. Therefore, it was right to have the same courtesy as when receiving gifts from other gods.</p>
<p>But it was not the lion of the underworld who bowed his head to her who went out.</p>
<p>“Dear Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, the guardian of the craftsman, the god of fire and blacksmith, the servant of Hephaestus greets you.”</p>
<p>“Hephaestus?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite tilted her head, “What brought the lion of Hephaestus here?”</p>
<p>“I have received the gift from my master to Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>“Gift?”</p>
<p>It was unexpected. Was there such a thing in the marriage custom of the Olympus? There were only two precedents, so she didn’t even ask for ‘procedures’ that she ought to follow, but she didn’t know if she should have checked.</p>
<p>“Yes, please accept this, Miss Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>But he already brought it, and she couldn’t send it back.</p>
<p>“Alright, get it.” Aphrodite nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Her lower gods and nymphs accepted Hephaestus’s gift from the lion.</p>
<p>It was a long silver ark. It looked quite heavy, but it was hard to guess what was beneath its cover. It even looked boring and simple, and at first glance, it looked like a big chunk of silver.</p>
<p>“What’s in it?” As she murmured to herself, the lion of Hephaestus managed to grasp her curiosity and answered, “My master made it himself for Aphrodite and named it Kestos Himas.”</p>
<p>“Kestos Himas, the Magic Belt?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“What magic is in it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. One thing my master says, “You can see when you wear the belt and look in the mirror.””</p>
<p><em>Oh, then I’ll try.</em> Aphrodite, a little impatient to quench her interest, hurried inside and opened the silver ark.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Her lips opened unconsciously.</p>
<p>The belt neatly placed in the silver ark was staggeringly beautiful. A thin, flat band, adorned with several layers of rose vines, all gold. Each rose bud was meticulously detailed. That alone was admirable, and when she looked closely, she added elegance and loveliness to the blooming flower decorated with pale pink pearls.</p>
<p>It was the most dramatic work she has ever seen before. The pure gold rope that had been attached to Apollo’s gift felt rough compared to this belt.</p>
<p>Aphrodite pulled out the Kestos Himas. The long waistband drooped along a flowing curve, and even its texture sparked pleasure. She couldn’t help but admire the gift in awe.</p>
<p>“This is really great.”</p>
<p>The nymphs, who had been looking at her, even forgetting to breathe next to her, came to their senses. Soon, they began to chatter.</p>
<p>“How beautiful, Miss Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen a treasure like this. Come on, put it on your waist!”</p>
<p>She was about to. Without delay, Aphrodite then draped the Kestos Himas around her waist.</p>
<p>A blacksmith’s creation is like a treasure made by the hand of God. Kestos Himas was wrapped around Aphrodite’s waist as if it had been waiting, then wounded around her before she even adjusted it, completing its perfect appearance.</p>
<p>This is why everyone constantly sought Hephaestus. Once again admiring, Aphrodite raised her head with both hands on her waist. Her gaze landed on her reflection at the mirror in front of her.</p>
<p>Words left her.</p>
<p>The moment she saw herself in the mirror, she almost lost her sanity. Even though she knew it was herself! Wearing the magical belt, she was terribly adorable. She was willing to give anything. It must have torn her heart if she rejected it for not needing anything.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The nymphs watching from behind seemed to feel the same way. They knelt down and wept as if they were falling apart.</p>
<p>If the magical power in the Kestos Himas was named, ‘absolute fascination’ would be appropriate. Its magic of amplifying the wearer’s charm and drawing the obedience of its audience was impeccable.</p>
<p>She had no idea how this magic could be invoked. She didn’t even imagine this would be possible in the first place.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>But there was no way not to believe it, as she had already seen it with my eyes. Aphrodite laughed with herself in the mirror. Slowly and silently, but her smile was wide enough that anyone could tell she was greatly satisfied.</p>
<p>This was the best thing she could get from being a god!</p>
<p>No treasures received from other gods, as well as human offerings, were comparable to Kestos Himas. This was the best tribute for herself, the goddess of love and beauty.</p>
<p>And one more thing.</p>
<p>Hephaestus, who acted like a rock, was a man after all. He was unexpectedly capable of sending gifts to make a woman delighted. Isn’t that admirable? Aphrodite nodded gladly. And in return for the gift from Hephaestus, she decided to willingly go down.</p>
<p>“I must go right now. Take the lead.”</p>
<p>“Where shall I take you, Miss Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>“A blacksmith’s workshop.”</p>
