            <p><strong>Chapter 44 – Punishment</strong></p>
<p>Without so much a word, Aphrodite walked towards her husband as he beckoned with one hand. With a second gesture, the net-like metal parted, allowing his hand entry. Hephaestus grabbed her and pulled her towards him, the trap completely parting to let her through. He then bent to pick up her robe from the ground and wrapped it around her as if to protect her modesty.</p>
<p>She hugged him as tight as he could and buried her face on his chest, giggling madly. Meanwhile, she felt herself go moist between her thighs with excitement. This was something she never felt with Ares, whatever he said and did.</p>
<p>“Zeus, let us discuss Ares’ punishment on a later date.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Why not now?”</p>
<p>“For now, I intend to take Aphrodite back with me.”</p>
<p>“Aphrodite? Where? What do you have in mind?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“What? What do you mean by no?”</p>
<p>“You asked if you could ask. That is my answer.”</p>
<p>Zeus was stunned. Hephaestus was not the defiant sort and even the more spirited of Olympus’ residents rarely crossed him, the King of the Gods.</p>
<p>“If there is nothing else I will be on my way.”</p>
<p>“Very well, then. Proceed.”</p>
<p>Hoisting Aphrodite into his arms, much as the groom would do to his bride after their wedding vows, the god of fire began the long walk to his own castle. He was untiring as he did not ask to put her down to rest, not even once. But time lost all meaning to the goddess of love. In fact, she was surprised when they walked through the gates of his fortress. She could not tell whether they were walking for ten minutes, an hour, or half a day.</p>
<p>With surprise evident on their faces, Hephaestus’ attendants rushed out of the building to greet them as he gently put his wife down on the ground.</p>
<p>“From now on, nobody can come in without my specific command,” he said in a cold, forbidding voice.</p>
<p>“But why, my lord?” said one in surprise, his own boldness surprising him.</p>
<p>“I have no reason to explain why. If we have guests that try to open the door, or force themselves in then tell them they will be cursed under my name.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite shared the shock of his followers. It was exciting and curious to see a new side of him, one that she did not expect. After all, she had him pegged as a lost cause as far as husbands went.</p>
<p>“Follow me,” said Hephaestus, his voice cutting through her feverish, jumbled thoughts. His wife was all too glad to obey and jogged to catch up with him. They were headed towards the bedroom, noted Aphrodite. As soon as she entered, the goddess of love let the robe wrapped around her fall into the floor.</p>
<p>The god of fires gave her a long, hard stare. But instead of looking away, he shifted his gaze lower, towards her bosom. Like a sculptor examining a piece of uncut marble, he was studying every inch of his wife’s nudity. The effect on Aphrodite was electrifying: it was more erotic than any kiss or touch she had every experienced. Her nipples stiffened under his cold, almost expressionless gaze.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have something you want to say to me?” he finally said, almost reluctantly, as if he did not wish to speak at all.</p>
<p>“Do I?” she responded with a mischievous smile and in a tone to match.</p>
<p>“Think about it. What do you think is a good thing to say right now?” responded Hephaestus, refusing to rise to Aphrodite’s banter.</p>
<p><em>Was there something he wanted to hear, </em>she thought. If there was, she never found out for her husband turned his back on her and began rummaging for something in a small chest. It was a pair of oddly-designed bracelets joined by a very short chain. Any doubts as to whether it was a magical artifact were dispelled as the god of fires put it on her wrists. The hard metal almost seemed to melt like a liquid as it tightened around the flesh near her hands. But such an appearance was deceiving: the bracelets did not budge when she tried to move her wrists.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“You’ll soon find out.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“Something that you like.”</p>
<p>“Something that I like?” said Aphrodite, her head tilted to one side in surprise. She was thinking how sure she was that her husband was going to punish her when another thought dawned to her. Suddenly, she suspected that pleasure, not punishment was on the mind of Hephaestus.</p>
<p>But he no longer explained or elaborated.<br>
