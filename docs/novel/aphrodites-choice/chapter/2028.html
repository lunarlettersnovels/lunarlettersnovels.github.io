            <p><strong>Chapter 1 – Zeus’ Matchmaking</strong></p>
<p>The great twelve gods of Olympus, Dodecathlon, gathered together.</p>
<p>It was, of course, Zeus who convened the meeting. As King of the Gods, he sat on a high throne surrounded by clouds and greeted the other gods, and as soon as all the twelve gathered, he brought up the story without delay.</p>
<p>The one whom Zeus pointed out, Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, asked sharply again.</p>
<p>“Marry me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will.”</p>
<p>“Why should I?”</p>
<p>Despite the defiant response, Zeus remained calm. He replied with a generous smile to the name of the king of the gods.</p>
<p>“Because you are the goddess of love and beauty.”</p>
<p>“That can’t be a reason.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s not true. I’ll explain.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite didn’t like Zeus. She has been upset since she first saw him, but the more she knows, the more she doesn’t like him.</p>
<p>The origin of Aphrodite’s birth was the ancient god, Uranos, Zeus’ grandfather. She belonged at the top of the hierarchy, according to her lineage. But even though Zeus knew it clearly, he treated her like a newborn goddess, daughter or granddaughter.</p>
<p>“Beautiful Aphrodite. The atmosphere in Olympus has been very chaotic lately. Do you know why?”</p>
<p>It was the only resistance that could be made by disobedience, as it was resentful but could not outpace Zeus by force. Aphrodite replied, looking straight into Zeus’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Well, even if it’s just the way it is? The gods and spirits who adore you fought for the order of courtship and competed for gifts, and eventually came to compete for strength. With each of your calling behind you.”</p>
<p>She listened to his words half-heartedly. Eventually, she couldn’t endure until the end and kicked out the nymphs.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Zeus continued. “The situation is very serious. Ever since the Titanomachy [war between the Olympians and Titans led by Zeus], the atmosphere has never been so sour.”</p>
<p>Making a fuss with a dignified accent was also an ability if it were considered one. Aphrodite laughed in vain.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot of exaggeration.”</p>
<p>“Exaggerated, not at all. I can’t stand by any longer.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“Come on. What do you think of this deplorable situation?”</p>
<p>Aphrodite fully understood Zeus’ words. In other words, he has to get married so that foolish men don’t fight uselessly anymore. To be honest, she had planned such a life. Like some of the goddesses here, she didn’t mean to swear to herself, and she was thinking of having a baby one day.</p>
<p>But she didn’t want to follow his orders. Aphrodite went out crooked.</p>
<p>“I think it’s desirable.”</p>
<p>“Desirable?”</p>
<p>“They want me. Well, I can’t help it. If you want what everyone wants, you have to fight and win. Wasn’t that a very basic discipline in the world we govern?”</p>
<p>It was not Aphrodite’s candid appreciation of the recent embarrassing situation. She didn’t fret nor want to incite them to fight among themselves, as Eris did. Moreover, she had never promised the winner anything in the first place.</p>
<p>What do you think of what the low-downs have done? It is unpleasant in itself to be asked such a question, what more would he think?</p>
<p>But she could say anything she didn’t want to say to Zeus to break the ice.</p>
<p>She isn’t the goddess of truth. Aphrodite turned her hair over with an exaggerated gesture. Several gods frowned at the attitude that the idle remarks just brought out might seem sincere.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Zeus was different. He answered calmly, “Not so, Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>
<p>“In my ruling world, struggle is not the only answer when it comes to getting something.”</p>
<p>“What then? Fraud and backdoor deals?”</p>
<p>“It’s a rational agreement and a fair trade.</p>
<p>“Poo-hoo.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite eventually burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Whether Zeus wriggled his eyebrows or not, it was a sound she couldn’t help but laugh! Where’s that in Olympus? If Kronos had heard that, Tartarus would have let out a roar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, Zeus wasn’t the only one here. The other gods cast their eyes on Aphrodite’s attitude. In particular, Athena glared as if she would nag right away.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh, Athena. Please calm down. I didn’t mean to diminish the value you protect.’</em></p>
<p>Aphrodite looked eagerly at Athena, but her inner thought was not delivered to her foe. It was because the ability to read thoughts between the gods, who were in the same class, couldn’t be accomplished.</p>
<p>“Oh, well. I’m sorry.” Swallowing her irritation, Aphrodite cleared up her mistake. She couldn’t help it because she would get into trouble if that nagman sided with Zeus.</p>
<p>Anyway, Zeus turned the tables thanks to his daughter. He coughed lightly in vain, focused the eyes of the gods, then spoke solemnly toward Aphrodite.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“As King of Olympus, as Lord, I, Zeus, recommend you to have a husband who is fit for you.”</p>
<p>It was a recommendation, but underneath it was an order. It was clear that he would not allow a refusal. Aphrodite twisted her lips.</p>
<p>“I mean, be somebody’s wife.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Then you’ll come into my bed. Lightning? Raindrops? Or sheep?”</p>
<p>It was a sarcastic remark about the highest-ranking who coveted married women.</p>
