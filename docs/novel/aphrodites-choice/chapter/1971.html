            <p><strong>Chapter 58 – Gone</strong></p>
<p>Hephaestus guessed about the events that had transpired in Olympus, in his absence. He was certain that the whole incident of his fall had been revealed and Ares had been found guilty. If not, Hera would never descend on earth, much less come to meet him. She came for Ares, the one child she loved.</p>
<p>“Go to Olympus and testify,” she demanded.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” he asked, feigning unawareness.</p>
<p>“Do I need to spell it out for you, boy?” she snapped, “Fine. Just go and acknowledge that it was all a mistake, a misunderstanding. You can say that Ares was commanding the spirits to save you.”</p>
<p>Hephaestus wasn’t even surprised, he expected it. It was almost funny. She had never cared for him. She didn’t care if he died. Any hope for love he had from his mother was gone. He laughed and felt free from her for the first time. He would have done as she commanded, if he had been the same boy as before. He would have done it to see her pleased, even if he was starving for a scrap of love from her, but not anymore. He realized that she would never see him as her son, and the sooner he let go of any expectations regarding her, the better.</p>
<p>“I am not going,” said Hephaestus, chuckling.</p>
<p>“What?” she said, momentarily dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“They know what happened. The evidence is clear,” he said, “I am not going to lie for your sake or for Ares’ any longer.”</p>
<p>“I will not let it happen,” she said thunderously, “I will not have Ares punished!”</p>
<p>“And that’s why you need me to lie. Yes, yes, I get it,” he said, “But I want Ares punished for what he did. It’s only fair.”</p>
<p>Hera was seething in anger. Hephaestus dreaded that expression ever since he was a child, he feared it. Every time he saw her angry, he would do anything at all to please her, to comfort her. But not anymore.</p>
<p>“You can go back now, if that’s all,” he said nonchalantly, “Goodbye Lady Hera.” He turned to go away from the spot but realized that he couldn’t move. His feet were bound by invisible shackles.</p>
<p>“I will drag you to Olympus if I have to,” said Hera, laughing maniacally.</p>
<p>Hephaestus tried to squirm out of the bindings, but to no avail. He tried to free himself, but nothing worked against the power of Hera. She was much too strong.</p>
<p>“I am not going!” he yelled.</p>
<p>“Just testify,” she said, “After that, I don’t care what you do. You will be as good as dead to me.”</p>
<p>“No,” he said angrily, “I will not-” His mouth was glued shut with magic. Hera climbed into her brilliant golden carriage, and Hephaestus was thrown in the seat across from her. The soldiers on either side held him still, but he struggled with all his might.</p>
<p>“Back to Olympus,” she demanded, “My son is waiting.” The horses made of cloud and magic reared their heads and kicked their feet. They ascended to the sky and soared through the air. Hephaestus tried to scream in despair, but no sound came out.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The girl from the sea had been pushed far by the waves because of a storm. When she came back to the home that she shared with Hephaestus, he was gone. The place exuded an emptiness that made her realize he might not be back for a long time, or perhaps ever.</p>
<p>She sought out the earth spirits who relayed to her everything that had happened in her absence, having witnessed all. But they refused to answer the most important question she posed: “Where was he taken?”</p>
<p>They were afraid of Hera’s wrath. They had already done as much as they could by providing home and heart to Hephaestus, the most hated son of the Queen of the Gods. They were very scared of crossing her further.</p>
<p>“Our apologies, Great One,” they said, head bowed, “We cannot help you any further.”</p>
<p>She didn’t press them anymore. She understood their fear. She wandered around the island. She walked from the northeast side of the island to the southwest end. The residents of Limnos weren’t any help either. They were already afraid of the storm that Hera had wrecked on the island with her visit; they took it to mean that the gods were angry.</p>
<p>She wandered around the island till her legs gave out from underneath her and she dropped to the sand. She sat there lamenting his absence and her being unable to find him. <em>Where are you, Hephaestus? </em>There was only silence, disturbed occasionally by the breeze. She remembered his eager smile and his cheerful wave.</p>
