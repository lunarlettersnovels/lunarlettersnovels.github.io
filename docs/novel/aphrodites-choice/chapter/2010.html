            <p><strong>Chapter 19 – Aphrodite’s Forgotten Promise</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to everyone else, Aphrodite was neither fazed nor afraid of Erinyes. Her personality wasn’t of a weak and feeble woman in the first place, and frankly, Hephaestus’ presence next to her was of some help. His rigid body was like a huge stone pillar. Even though he was not Atlas, he was a stalwart that could stand his ground even if Zeus’ thunder struck. His silhouette alone allowed Aphrodite to remain unperturbed before the fearsome visitors.</p>
<p>Hephaestus asked, “I’m surprised the three goddesses are coming to Olympus. May I ask what’s going on?”</p>
<p>[Our business is not with you.]</p>
<p>Strangely enough, however, the echo of Erinyes’ voice in her ears didn’t feel sinister.</p>
<p>Aphrodite glared at Erinyes in wonder. For the past days, visions unknown to her had been appearing in her mind, although fleeting, and even from Erinyes, she felt a sense of familiarity. Unconsciously, her grip around Hephaestus’ hand tightened. With her gaze still locked on Erinyes, Aphrodite didn’t notice that Hephaestus had looked down in dismay.</p>
<p>“Then who did you come to?” Zeus’ voice sliced through the tense air, and at his question, the three sisters turned their heads at the same time toward the same direction. Three thin fingers pointed to Aphrodite, and Erinyes’ lips moved in chorus.</p>
<p>[We came to visit our youngest sister.]</p>
<p>Aphrodite was startled, “Me?”</p>
<p>[Yes, sister.]</p>
<p>There was not much justification for the use of the nickname ‘sister.’ Though not born from normal conception, Erinyes was considered a child of Uranus and Gaea. Hence, Aphrodite, who was born to Uranos, could be said to share her father with them. It was a technical fact, but weren’t they too different to be sisters?</p>
<p>Aphrodite stared at Erinyes in uncertainty. Unlike when they were dealing with Zeus earlier, the three Erinyes sisters all looked at Aphrodite and recited like a spinning song:</p>
<p>[Aphrodite, last daughter of heaven.]</p>
<p>[We are here as witnesses of your oath.]</p>
<p>[If today’s oath is broken, the security belongs to us.]</p>
<p>Aphrodite frowned, unable to comprehend the meaning of their words. She questioned in confusion, “What oath? I don’t remember.”</p>
<p>Surprised by her negligent response, Zeus shouted low, “Oh, Aphrodite!”</p>
<p>“Why? I just said I don’t remember.”</p>
<p>“A lie doesn’t work on Erinyes.”</p>
<p>That was why she said it as it is! Aphrodite tried to appeal to Zeus, but Erinyes was quick.</p>
<p>[Don’t interfere, Zeus.]</p>
<p>Aphrodite thought that the goddess who had kept Zeus’ mouth shut was Alecto. It wasn’t certain, but it was extremely likely. Then, Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone spoke to Aphrodite in turns.</p>
<p>[Little sister, it’s natural that you don’t remember.]</p>
<p>[Because it was such an oath.]</p>
<p>[At that time, you were merely fluid without understanding, so you swore by memory.]</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Hephaestus squeezed Aphrodite’s hand to the point of pain.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p><em>What’s wrong with him?’</em>Baffled, Aphrodite dug her fingernails on the palms of Hephaestus to retaliate and turned her eyes to Erinyes. Without hesitation, she asked, “You mean I have an oath with my memory as collateral?”</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>“What did I swear on?”</p>
<p>The serpents that twined above Erinyes suddenly shook their heads and hissed, revealing in their sharp fangs the green venom that dripped menacingly.</p>
<p>[If you complete your oath, you will naturally realize it.]</p>
<p>“Which means you can’t tell me before then?”</p>
<p>Erinyes nodded. Aphrodite then realized that the oath these vicious sisters were trying to affirm had nothing to do with the blankness of her memory. It was dumbfounding.</p>
<p><em>Wait, what did they say?</em></p>
<p>“You think that the oath I made will be broken? Today?”</p>
<p>[As far as we know, perhaps.]</p>
<p>If the oath was to be betrayed, Erinyes would rightfully acquire the collateral, which was Aphrodite’s memories; it was like a game that left Aphrodite no chance for triumph. Trapped in a seemingly hopeless situation, Aphrodite set her boundaries, “What the hell should I do and how? You don’t even know, no, no! Don’t come any closer. Talk there.”</p>
<p>[Alright. Even if you do not remember, there will be no harm to you now.]</p>
<p>Aphrodite glared at the slowly approaching Erinyes. Even one was enough of a burden, but since there were three, it was unlikely that she would win by competing head-on. Could she ask the other gods for help? Athena would be the best combatant here, but she couldn’t be seen because the crowd was hidden behind Erinyes.</p>
<p>It might have been better to flee. Aphrodite stepped back, attempting to find a retreat, but before she could take a single step, a strong force held her.</p>
<p>“Stay still.”</p>
<p>It was Hephaestus. He took a step forward, pushing Aphrodite behind his back. As the wind blew, the scent of his body, which had been thickly ingrained in his rich hem of clothing, brushed against the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>There was a scent of fire and ash, of passion and patience, in him. Aphrodite took a deep breath without realizing it. Well, it was fine. There was no mistaking this smell for someone else nor someone noticing. She wished she could smell a little more…</p>
<p>However, it was not entirely the best timing to savor his body scent.</p>
<p>“Erinyes.”</p>
<p>There was no fear, no servility in the voice of Hephaestus.<br>
