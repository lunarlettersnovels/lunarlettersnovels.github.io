            <p><strong>Chapter 46 – Devious Desire</strong></p>
<p>They made love only once to consummate their marriage, yet it was remarkable that Hephaestus remembered exactly where her sensitive spots were, concentrating on pleasuring her there.  Subconsciously, she squeezed his finger tightly inside her and moaned.</p>
<p>Every time his long finger roamed inside her with such expertise, she felt like her womb was on fire, melting and consuming every part of her being. She shuddered as she felt not one but three of his fingers inside of her, stroking and caressing her in places he knew that she would squelch more of her, pouring liquid all over her thighs down to her legs.</p>
<p>The marbles gave her no mercy. Now glistened with her moisture, they moved in rhythm with Hephaestus’ fingers. With the marbles massaging her cl*toris on the outside and her husband’s fingers exploring her inside, another big climax made her breathing thick with lust as she let out another gasp.</p>
<p>“Do you like it?  Your liquid essence is hot and sweet smelling, I guess you are enjoying it.”</p>
<p>“Ah, aghh, Hephae…st…us. Aghh! Hmm…”</p>
<p>Opposite to her panting and stuttering, she hinted both calmness and coldness in his voice.</p>
<p>“I guess you are frustrated with having me as your husband, unable to perform my duty in pleasing you. I know you are not satisfied with me. I’m sorry that I didn’t resolve the situation earlier.”</p>
<p>Though calm, she still couldn’t decipher the meaning behind his words. Aphrodite thought Hephaestus was talking nonsense until she felt his fingers against her faltered that she realized what he was trying to say. He meant that she wasn’t satisfied with him. From what? If he was referring to their first time, which was amazing despite it being benign, then he was absurd into thinking that.</p>
<p>“What are you talking, agh, about? Do you know how much, when, ah-”</p>
<p>Fighting off her lust with logic, she tried to refute him, but her sentences became gibberish as she couldn’t stop moaning. He was intentionally distracting her, focussing his attention fully in giving her ultimate sexual satisfaction, and not even wanting to hear what she wanted to say.</p>
<p>His one hand was stroking her earlobe now, while the other continued to thrust in and out of her, penetrating her deeply as if an actual sword was soaking inside her womb.</p>
<p>Powerless to hold off as she reached another climax, her lips let out a loud cry of ecstasy. As Aphrodite rubbed her face on the bed, she realized how she was positioned. Naked, tied up, and lying down on a man’s lap; she should have felt humiliated by being assaulted this way, yet she couldn’t contain her excitement that she even thrusted her hips to match the movement of her husband’s fingers inside her.</p>
<p>“Ah, ahh!”</p>
<p>“Do you like it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I like it. Ah, mmm, right there.”</p>
<p>“I will remember it. You like it if I enter here…”</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>“And press you hard here.”</p>
<p>“Don’t pre…press so hard, ah, ah!”</p>
<p>“You seem to like it more the harder I press.”</p>
<p>More than the physical pleasure, she was enjoying herself because she was doing it with her husband. It was all because of Hephaestus, the stone like man who told her once that she could be easily replaced by more important matters in her husband’s life. Yet, the fact that he was exploring her inside just to give her ultimate pleasure implied otherwise. She felt as though she was the most important in his life.</p>
<p>With all these being said, how could she not enjoy herself with what he had laid out for her when he even went out of his way to get her back from another man with his own arms? Jealousy, possessiveness and whatever he was feeling, all of these were solely directed to her. His emotions, focused only on her, gave deep color with her existence to be worshipped and adored like the true goddess of love that she is.</p>
<p>Such knowledge and emotion gave her a sense of satisfaction, as a woman, a wife, and a goddess. Aphrodite shivered from such feeling of insurmountable bliss.</p>
<p>“Ah, I like it, ah!”</p>
<p>Yet, Aphrodite knew from within her that she wanted more. Her ecstasy, though satisfying, was not enough. It was insufficient that Hephaestus was only using his hand. Had she not experienced him inside her before, she wouldn’t have complained, but after having a taste of his manhood… No matter how skillful his fingers were, it would never be enough. She wants his entirety inside her.</p>
<p>She climaxed lightly this time. As she collected her breathing, she felt his finger thrusting her again but determined to get what she truly wanted, she squeezed him hard wanting him to feel her dismissal. This time, she moved the muscle in her womb not to enjoy herself but to stop him from continuing what he was doing.</p>
<p>Sensing the change, Hephaestus asked her, a bit taken aback. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“Stop putting it in now,” Aphrodite commanded in a firm voice.</p>
<p>“Why? I’m sure you are still far away from being satisfied.”</p>
<p>“Satisfied, ah!” She nearly lost her resolve as he fingered her again, fighting off her rejection. This brought her arousal to another level but Aphrodite bit her lips and turned around to face her husband, more determined to express what she truly wanted. “What I mean to say is, stop using the finger! I want you inside me!”</p>
<p>“Me?” Hephaestus was obviously caught off guard.  He was not expecting such request from his wife.</p>
<p>“Yes, you. The thing between your legs.  I want it inside me, now!”</p>
<p>It was quite empowering for Aphrodite to loudly demand such from him, but beggars can’t be choosers. She started to look between his legs and rubbed her naked body against it, wanting him to feel what she wanted. Of course, she could easily do such in spite of her restraint; after all, she was on top of him, lying face down exactly where his manhood was within her reach.</p>
