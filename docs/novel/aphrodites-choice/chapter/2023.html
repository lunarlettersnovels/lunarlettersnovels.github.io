            <p><strong>Chapter 6 – The Unseen Truth</strong></p>
<p>“It’s decided by Zeus. A little, um, retaliation.”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah. That’s why.”</p>
<p>It was a story of the King of Gods: marrying the ugly man in revenge for the beauty’s failure to be tempted. But the residents of Olympus nodded their heads in silence.</p>
<p>“It was like that.”</p>
<p>The public opinion thus resulted in a sympathetic view of Aphrodite.</p>
<p>“Maybe good, Aphrodite. What is her sin?”</p>
<p>“I know. I heard she is sick and lying down right now.”</p>
<p>“What! What? Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard she has been crying…”</p>
<p>“Oh, my.”</p>
<p>Many sympathetic words poured out from strangers’ lips toward the beautiful goddess who had been imprisoned by an unwanted marriage. Half were heartfelt regret and half were jealous sarcasm.</p>
<p>But the reality was quite different.</p>
<p>Aphrodite wasn’t lying down, nor was she crying sadly. Isn’t that too ‘human?’ She was a descendant of Uranos to the world and a goddess of Olympus. She is too great to be wallowing in self-pity.</p>
<p>Moreover, Aphrodite’s residence was indeed the most beautiful sanctuary in Olympus.</p>
<p>The columns supporting the delicately carved roof are as rich as pearls. The pillar-to-ground contact area was encircled by glimmering vines like stalagmites. Roses boasted their delicate colors on each vine’s stem, revealing that this was indeed the sanctuary of Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love and Beauty.</p>
<p>No god could sustain melancholy in such a place.</p>
<p>Aphrodite, of course, was far from depressed from her natural nature. She was busily unwrapping the wedding gifts that arrived in front of her. Her nymphs continued to wait on her.</p>
<p>“Who sent this, you said?”</p>
<p>“This is from Athena.”</p>
<p>The Goddess of Wisdom, born from the head of the father, swore to herself forever. Therefore, the wedding gift cannot be returned.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Athena’s gifts were quite substantial. There were especially many great fabrics. Aphrodite somehow enjoyed having the textiles against her body and picked out a cloth whose snake scales subtly reflected light like real leather.</p>
<p>“I’ll make clothes for the next feast with this. Keep the rest well.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will.”</p>
<p>The nymphs closed Athena’s box. Aphrodite explored her next target.</p>
<p>“Let me see.”</p>
<p>What caught her eye was a box of flashing brilliant gold. Even the rope that wounded around the box was dazzling, made of fine gold instead of thread. It was impossible not to know who sent it. Aphrodite laughed. The nymph confirmed that her guess was correct.</p>
<p>“What you’re seeing is from Apollo. The one on the right is from Artemis.”</p>
<p>“Yes, what do you say?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Open it.”</p>
<p>Apollo must have been quite annoyed that he had to pick out a gift instead of paying it back that day.</p>
<p>But Zeus arranged the marriage. Is it just matchmaking? It was a union that promised to host the ceremony in person. It was like expressing dissatisfaction with Zeus’ decision if he didn’t send a congratulatory gift.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>Still, he could have just pretended to let go and fill it insincerely, but would he have been worried that he’d get caught? The golden box was filled with valuable items such as beautiful lira, outer garments woven with pure white swan feathers, and rare medicinal fruits.</p>
<p>“Our God of Sun is also very sincere. What should I do?”</p>
<p>“There seems to be nothing to use right now, so take it to the warehouse,” Aphrodite ordered.</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>While Apollo’s gift box was closing back, Aphrodite stretched.</p>
<p>Ten of the twelve highest gods of Olympus had sent her their presents. She had still opened half among those she received, but she was already beaming. Having new possessions and fancying them were the basic habits of the gods. which is why humans donate their offerings before praying for their protection.</p>
<p>The gods are not very interested in themselves, but they know that if they receive something, they will be keeping them at the back of their minds. That’s what for humans, so she couldn’t help but be happy to receive something without compensation from the gods of equal status.</p>
<p>Aphrodite hummed and examined the boxes that had not yet been opened. <em>‘Whose should I open this time, Artemis? Hermes?’</em></p>
<p>A subordinate god approached Aphrodite, who was in joyful agony.</p>
<p>“Miss Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I think you should come out for a moment. The lion is here.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite thought Hades’ gift had arrived.</p>
