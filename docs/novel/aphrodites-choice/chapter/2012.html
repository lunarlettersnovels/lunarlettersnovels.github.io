            <p><strong>Chapter 17 – The Ethereal Bride</strong></p>
<p>Olympus was always in spring. It was neither too hot nor too cold, nor warm. The weather was constantly pristine.</p>
<p>It was thanks to the strength of the gods who resided there. The power also stems from the increasing number of Greek people who worship them. The men, who diligently cultivated their lands, planting olives, and gave birth to their children, built temples and dedicated themselves to various offerings.</p>
<p>The sanctuary that grew human faith into the soil, the paradise of the gods, peacefully and comfortably invoking immortality…</p>
<p>That was Olympus.</p>
<p>And all those living in Olympus were gathered today in one place to bless the marriage of the two gods. The island in the air was swarmed, and the cheers from the bride’s carriage, pulled by a white swan, resonated clearly throughout Olympus.</p>
<p>“It’s the bride!”</p>
<p>“Aphrodite is here!”</p>
<p>But to be exact, not every single person came.</p>
<p>Holding Hera’s hand as she descended the carriage, Aphrodite sauntered down the path illuminated with starlight. The bride’s road prepared for the goddess certainly was ravishing as though to complement the goddess’s unparalleled beauty.</p>
<p>However, not long after, Aphrodite felt tired. The place where Zeus, the host of the wedding, and Hephaestos, the groom, stood, was quite far from what she thought. So Aphrodite scanned the guests, pretending to look ahead.</p>
<p>The dense congregation of the lower gods and nymphs did not distinguish well, and after about half the road, the images of the twelve gods began to be seen one by one.</p>
<p>Athena, who hurried around the outskirts and sat in her seat, Artemis whispering in the presence of Athena, Hermes poking at the starter standing behind Apollo, Dionysus stretching out in his own long chair, and…</p>
<p>“Someone is missing.”</p>
<p>Poseidon was seated apart with his wife and daughters on the other side; Demeter, who was side by side with his only daughter, Persephone, clasped his hand with hers. But still, someone was missing.</p>
<p>Hera said to Aphrodite, who tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for Ares?”</p>
<p>“Oh? Oh, I see. There’s no Ares.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t let him come.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Aphrodite received Hera’s words casually. It was none of her business whether or not Ares was there or not, and she had nothing more to say because he was absent by his mother’s order, not his own will.</p>
<p>But Hera seemed to have misunderstood Aphrodite’s reaction.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to get attention from my son.”</p>
<p>Of course, Hera was referring to Ares, but Aphrodite, who was offended, responded nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“I don’t know which son you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You have two sons. Well, one of them is my groom.”</p>
<p>Hera was ridiculously provoked, with a voice that sank coldly she spoke, “Watch your tongue. Who’s my son?”</p>
<p>It was different from what Aphrodite had seen so far. She didn’t know it was this extreme, but Hera seemed to despise Hephaestos. Birthing a child certainly does not necessitate affection from the mother, but to such an extent…</p>
<p>As if she hadn’t said enough, Hera added harshly. “My son, Ares, don’t twist him. Never!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“If the name of that groom and my son comes up and down together again, I will surely not leave you alone,” threatened Hera.</p>
<p>Aphrodite almost burst into laughter. It was ridiculous. Indeed, her hatred against Hephaestus manifested, blaming her for the scandal that her favorite son caused.</p>
<p>“What’s your answer?”</p>
<p>Still, she treated Hera as the queen of the gods. Aphrodite smiled flagrantly and feigned exaggerated politeness. “Precisely, I’ll keep that in mind.” Though her courtesy was faked, her words were sincere. Hera’s warning was deeply engraved in Aphrodite’s memory.</p>
<p>To provoke Hera, touch her precious son, Ares.</p>
<p>“You…”</p>
<p>Aphrodite’s answer did not seem to satisfy Hera. Hera, with her eyes frowned, tried to say something again, but fortunately, they had reached the end of the bride’s road in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Zeus greeted Aphrodite with a smile. “You’re a beautiful bride. How beautiful.” It sounded like a ceremonial greeting, but the admiration it contained was genuine.</p>
<p>But such flattery didn’t faze Aphrodite, who was said to be beautiful from the moment she existed. She only looked at Zeus for a moment with a dull look. Of course, it wasn’t Zeus if he was embarrassed by such a reaction. The king of the gods smiled and spoke to Hera, very naturally.</p>
<p>“You’ve had a hard time getting the bride, my wife.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s just start the ceremony.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you should. Please send a bride to the groom. The groom will take the bride’s hand.”</p>
<p>Hephaestos, who had been invisible behind Zeus, took a step forward according to the call. Aphrodite was only then able to see her groom properly.</p>
<p>He was exactly what she knew.</p>
<p>The people of God are basically immortal, so if something had changed in a few days, it would have been even more strange. Needless to say, what bothered Aphrodite wasn’t his appearance.</p>
