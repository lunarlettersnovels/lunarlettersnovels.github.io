            <p><strong>Chapter 2 – Choosing the Groom</strong></p>
<p>The atmosphere was as if it had been poured by cold water. Not to mention the other gods who were listening, the slick Zeus seemed at a moment speechless. Even his smiling face cracked.</p>
<p>It’s a pleasure to see such a violent reaction, even though she didn’t make up a story that doesn’t exist. Aphrodite smiled and appreciated Zeus’s stiff face.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>But it wasn’t long before someone interfered. It was Apollo, a man with a patternless himation and a halo of light as a decoration.</p>
<p>“I wish you could keep good manners to the King of the Gods.”</p>
<p>“Oh, was I rude?”</p>
<p>“Since a long time ago, we’d better withdraw our previous inappropriate remarks.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Aphrodite calmly answered Apollo’s chilly gaze. This God of Sun, the son of Zeus, tended to be too devoted to his father.</p>
<p>The sun, prophecy, and medicine. In terms of control, Apollo was the one who would have been aiming for the next generation of the throne alongside Athena. But he, as the son of Zeus, didn’t want to get away from his position as a god under his command.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the reason was not to revere Zeus. Apollo was not even interested in his father, let alone his faithfulness.</p>
<p>At Olympus, Apollo only had one object of interest, Hestia, the goddess of fire. Artemis doesn’t even know that, and she seems to despise only the fairies who are unfortunately entangled in her brother’s scandal, but…</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite knew as soon as she saw it. The meaning of Apollo’s eyes on Hestia, as well as the reason why the strong God of Sun is satisfied with the present, not against the Lord.</p>
<p>Apollo did not rebel against Zeus because Hestia swore that she would remain a virgin forever. If he could have married his father’s sister, Apollo would have murdered Zeus. But Apollo, who couldn’t, chose to maintain the status quo. He decided to live under the authority of Zeus.</p>
<p>It’s a pity.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” Apollo glared at Aphrodite. Her expression alone seemed to say she had noticed something unpleasant.</p>
<p>She doesn’t like men who are quick-witted. Aphrodite grinned. “I don’t think you like it very much.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“But if you really want to hear it, I can tell you.”</p>
<p>“No need.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s wait for the next time. When you’re resting in front of a warm fireplace or something like that.”</p>
<p>Apollo immediately understood that Aphrodite’s last phrase was, in other words, ‘with Hestia’. A handsome face was sharply distorted.</p>
<p><em>What a shame! No, no. He’s not even a man who’s going to be mine.</em> Aphrodite tilted her head as if she were going to tease him further. But before she could think of a plausible word, Zeus stepped out.</p>
<p>“Come back to what you were saying, Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>“To what part of the story?”</p>
<p>“At the part, a husband who is fit for you.”</p>
<p>She wanted to pretend that she didn’t listen to anything she actually didn’t. Aphrodite smiled. Looking at Zeus’s face, which has become finer than before, the stretching seemed to have to be this much.</p>
<p>“Well, if you wish.”</p>
<p>“Are you accepting?”</p>
<p>Aphrodite nodded, “I told you so. When do I have to find my husband?”</p>
<p>Zeus laughed. It was ominous of him to show a smile without an immediate answer.</p>
<p>Sure enough.</p>
<p>“It’ll be decided right now.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember the recommendation you made to follow?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you told me to take my husband.”</p>
<p>“Which husband?”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p><em>Oh, it’s a deal.</em> Aphrodite realized in that phrase that his groom candidate had been compressed enough to pick with one hand.</p>
<p>The goddess of love and beauty originated in Uranus, the heavenly god, so as soon as she set foot in Olympus, she joined the ranks of the highest gods. In other words, only twelve gods are with her.</p>
<p>And out of the twelve gods, the male gods are seven.</p>
<p>Aphrodite looked at her groom candidates with fresh eyes. “Hmm.”</p>
<p>Zeus was the first to be excluded. The same goes for Poseidon, who had touched many nymphs, including the sea, rivers, and foxes, and even conceived children from human women.</p>
<p>Apollo, which was boiling with unfulfilled affection, was also not interested.</p>
<p><em>Then who’s there, Dionysus?</em></p>
<p>The God of Alcohol was sipping wine from a glass, blinking no matter if someone looked at him or not. Now he is sober and drinking, but she has seen him go wild with madness many times.</p>
<p>“Stop drinking, Dionysus.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Athena, who figured out the situation by looking at Aphrodite’s expression, stole the glass from Dionysus’ hand. Dionysus frowned but did not rebel against Athena.</p>
<p>“Ha.” Aphrodite turned away from Dionysus with an irritating sigh. This made her have lost half of the groom candidates. The problem is, the rest of them are not very well either…</p>
