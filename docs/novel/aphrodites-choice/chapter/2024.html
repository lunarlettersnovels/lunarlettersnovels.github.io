            <p><strong>Chapter 5 – The Story of Aphrodite’s Marriage</strong></p>
<p>The whole Olympus was in shock.</p>
<p>The goddess of love and beauty, Aphrodite, who received the attention of the entire Olympus from the moment she appeared, is getting married!</p>
<p>She was a goddess who seemed to be everyone’s lover until the end of the world. There were many who were heartbroken by the mere fact that she became someone’s wife so quickly. And he even…</p>
<p>“It’s Hephaestus.”</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous. They don’t fit together, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s not enough to just say that they don’t fit together.”</p>
<p>It was no wonder that the lower gods and spirits alike were causing such a fuss.</p>
<p>“Oh my, I can’t believe Aphrodite and Hephaestus are a couple…”</p>
<p>A combination of the most beautiful goddess and the ugliest god! It was also a matchmaking marriage. This meant that they would not be separated from each other for a while, but would become an official spouse who would be bound together for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>“But why are they getting married?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“You know, why would you marry if you had children without marriage, or if you could?”</p>
<p>A formal spouse; a married couple. The sound of the word in the world of gods was extraordinary.</p>
<p>It was extremely rare for a god to be formally married in Olympus. Of the first generation, defined as Zeus and his siblings, only Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon were officially married. Down onto the second generation, the age of their children, there has never been a marriage at all.</p>
<p>“Right, it sounds like that, too.”</p>
<p>So, it was perhaps natural for the residents of Olympus to wonder. Does it mean there’s a reason for them to marry? So why?</p>
<p>Only the parties knew what conversation ensued at the meeting of the twelve gods and those whose marriage was decided.</p>
<p>But the twelve gods had lower gods and nymphs who served them. The owner’s words and eyes are clever enough to recognize something, and there are curious, talkative, and imaginative people all around.</p>
<p>“About that.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to tell who said this, but I’ve heard a story.”</p>
<p>“Oh, what is it? Go ahead and tell me.”</p>
<p>“That’s, well, I’m not trying to undermine the reputation of the great. You know that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course. Who dares to think like that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we just want to know the truth.”</p>
<p>“Then you just have to listen…”</p>
<p>The more they heard it, the more plausible it was, and although it was not guaranteed by anyone’s name, a rumor was born in the name of the truth anyway.</p>
<p>According to the law of false rumors, not all parts of the ten were false. The beginning was the real fact that the majority of Olympus had witnessed.</p>
<p>“Remember there was a fight between those who adored Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>“How can I forget? It was a while ago.”</p>
<p>“But there was a fight like that, even among the gods.”</p>
<p>“What, what? Who? By any chance, Ares?”</p>
<p>“Of course Ares is in, but it’s not only him.”</p>
<p>It was also true that Ares fell in love with Aphrodite. He didn’t care about the attention of his subordinates, so there were countless witnesses.</p>
<p>After that, however, the facts were twisted and stories were added.</p>
<p>“There’s another one?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Actually, it’s not that surprising. Because Zeus wanted Aphrodite, too!”</p>
<p>The name of the God, who is notorious for coveting beautiful women, added fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>“Oh, no.”</p>
<p>“Then it’ll leave Aphrodite between father and son…”</p>
<p>There was no detailed explanation or evidence, but everyone was convinced of the so-called “multiple politics surrounding Aphrodite,” and they trusted the following story as it was.</p>
<p>“It’s too early to be surprised. There’s more.”</p>
<p>“There’s someone else?”</p>
<p>“Sure! Poseidon and Apollo said the same thing.”</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>“At this point, no one else knows.”</p>
<p>To encapsulate the gist of the rampant rumors: none other than the father, son, brother, and mature male gods of Olympus became rivals for Aphrodite, creating a harsh atmosphere. A major dispute was likely to break out. Then Hera, the Queen of the Gods, became the mediator.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite didn’t fall for Zeus, so he said he liked her or something like that.”</p>
<p>“Aha.”</p>
<p>“But then why Hephaestus?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Hera doesn’t like Hephaestus. Of the two sons, she only loves Ares, but why doesn’t she mate Ares with her?”</p>
<p>Some reasonable questions were raised in regard to the incoherent details, but they were also simply muted in Zeus’ name.</p>
