        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 8 – Hephaestus’ Sanctuary</strong></p>
<p>The residence of Hephaestus was in appearance vastly different from the sanctuary of any other gods.</p>
<p>The whole area was entrapped by high walls. To enter, one had to pass through a huge iron gate. It was quite the opposite of most of the sanctuaries in Olympus being guarded with decorative fences and broad gardens.</p>
<p>“Tsk, tsk.” Aphrodite clicked her tongue.</p>
<p>She didn’t listen to what others had said about Hephaestus, but seeing this, she wondered if she made the right choice. <em>What’s this? There’s no need for a barrier like this in Olympus!</em></p>
<p>“I’ll knock on the door, Miss Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we should.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, someone opened the door from inside. Did he sense an unusual guest’s visit? The huge iron gates opened wide on both sides with a thunderous roar, and a low-ranking god, who seemed to have a good standing, appeared.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man with a dignified appearance had the weight to match his behavior. His eyes grew bigger when he saw Aphrodite in the Kastos Himas, but he greeted politely without falling to his knees unseemly.</p>
<p>“Your servant Barreus greets Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Can I dare ask you why you’re here?” Barreus bowed so deeply that his waist was bent. Aphrodite, who had already been in a good mood, was pleased with the display of great respect.</p>
<p>“I came to see your master. Is he inside?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he is. One is hard to meet right now.”</p>
<p>“I’m here to see him, I said.”</p>
<p>“I apologize.”</p>
<p><em>Look at this. </em>Aphrodite laughed in vain. <em>You’re trying to kick yourself out without telling your master. </em>Is the magic of the belt not working for the power of Hephaestus?</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“My master is now in the first workshop.”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with that?”</p>
<p>But Aphrodite’s doubts were soon satisfied. Barreus gave various explanations with a look of guilt.</p>
<p>“The furnace in the first workshop uses the fire of Mount Moskils.”</p>
<p>Moskils was a volcano on Limnos Island, the sanctuary of Hephaestus. The fire with the hottest temperature, melting any metal as though they were water, poured out from the mouth of Moskils. In fact, Zeus’ lightning bolt was also smelted by Moskils’ fire.</p>
<p>“The fire is fierce, so we’re likely to throw away what we’re making. So Hephaestus, once he goes in, he doesn’t come out until he’s done, and he doesn’t let us in.”</p>
<p>In other words, it was too dangerous to enter. Aphrodite was a little persuaded, and inquired further, contemplating of returning to her home.</p>
<p>“You don’t know when he’ll come out, do you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m afraid so. Even when Lord Zeus came here before, I couldn’t give him a promise.”</p>
<p>The problem was that Barreus uttered Zeus’ name. He said it without knowing it, but it was a clear mistake. It’s not a sin to be ignorant of the relationship between the gods, but…</p>
<p>No, no. It’s not a crime. It was a crime to offend her.</p>
<p>Aphrodite glared at him with a frown, “So you meant, ‘What does Aphrodite have to insist on when Zeus immediately understood?'”</p>
<p>“What? No, no, no! How dare of me…”</p>
<p>Aphrodite, who snorted, walked away without hearing the guard’s excuses.</p>
<p>“Oh, Miss Aphrodite?”</p>
<p>“You wait there.”</p>
<p>The nymphs who followed were left behind.</p>
<p>“Please wait a moment! Goddess!”</p>
<p>Barreus followed in contemplation. But Aphrodite swung her hand off without even looking back at him. The fierce movement carried the power of God without her knowledge. Barreus was thrown as far away as a branch caught up in a gust of wind.</p>
<p>Those who looked out from inside the gates of the sanctuary, perhaps dwarfs, who seemed to be spirits of bellows or tempering, began to hiccup uncontrollably. Aphrodite smiled and beckoned them. Whether Kestos Himas’ power was valid, the short spirits came without hesitation, though they feared her.</p>
<p>She gave a haughty order.</p>
<p>“Take me to the place where Hephaestus is.”</p>
<p>“Ah, uh, uh, yeah.”</p>
<p>Her trip was short.</p>
