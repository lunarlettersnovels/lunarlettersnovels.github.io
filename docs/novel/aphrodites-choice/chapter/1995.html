            <p><strong>Chapter 34 – Impulsive Affair (I)</strong></p>
<p>“Why don’t you take a break?” said Aphrodite to the fully-armored male whose back was turned toward her. With a flick of her wrist, she sent a gentle breeze on to the back which was stained with the perspiration of exertion.</p>
<p>“Who dares disturb my practice!” said the god of war angrily as he whirled towards her, sword at the ready. But at the sight of the goddess of love, his tensed facial muscles softened while his eyes widened as he let out an “Oh.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite let out a carefully-calculated smiling, showing off her perfect teeth that were like mirrors reflecting the sun’s rays. Ares’ senses were immediately afire as he tossed away his weapon carelessly and asked, “You never visit me. What brings the beautiful one here?”</p>
<p>“I suppose being the god of war doesn’t make you the god of wisdom. Why else do you think I’m here?” she responded with a laugh, half-dainty and half-mocking.</p>
<p>“The cripple’s iron wasn’t hard enough for you, was it?” he responded in an arrogant tone.</p>
<p>Hephaestus was, of course. But knowing Ares, that would light up his legendary temper and she didn’t want him angry. At least, not yet. Besides, Aphrodite was not after an actual lover, only someone who seemed like the type. Her type, to be exact. With his beautifully-muscled body and confidence in every movement, the god of war was perfect for her purposes.</p>
<p>“Well, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“I always knew he was no real man. You are wasted on such a husband,” said Ares as he made no effort to disguise his gaze shifting towards Aphrodite’s loose dress, or more precisely, her peaks which would make an appearance as her robe’s hem moved with every slight breeze.</p>
<p><em>How predictable. And easy</em>, she thought. Like a fisherman reeling a trout out of the river, Aphrodite let out a well-practiced sigh. With a glum tone, she said, “Yes, you’re right.”</p>
<p>“What?” answered Ares, half-hoping but at the same time not expecting to hear those words.</p>
<p>“What you said is all true. Really, Ares. What should I do?” she said, head lowered as if in sadness, but only to hide her smirk at having caught her prey too easily.</p>
<p>“I knew it!”</p>
<p>“Knew what?”</p>
<p>“Poor Aphrodite. How miserable must you be, having been wed to a man with soft iron and looks like he used his own face to put out the flames on his smith. But fret not, you have come to the right god for the job.”</p>
<p>She laughed awkwardly to hide a sigh of relief. The goddess of love was unsure how to lie about her husband as he was everything she wanted in a man on her bed. Thankfully, this braggart of a god went ahead and invented a story which she only had to agree with.</p>
<p><em>But why do I feel so bad? Everything’s going according to plan, </em>she thought.</p>
<p>“Aphrodite?” asked Ares, and without waiting for an answer, he began to stride towards her. She could feel the heat literally steaming out of his body. The goddess of love was pretty sure it wasn’t just because of his sword practice. As she raised her head, Aphrodite could see the unpleasant leer forming on his face. She felt unease at how the god of war bit on her bait without hesitation. Yes, she should be pleased because he was making her job easier. But on the other hand, Aphrodite felt that she might have badly miscalculated Ares’ actions.</p>
<p>“Don’t be shy,” he said, misinterpreting the goddess of love’s mood as if she was being a shy maiden.</p>
<p>“Wait!” she said, holding her hands up in defense as Ares was now almost face-to-face with her.</p>
<p>“I’ll make you forget all about him,” he said huskily. The god of war’s voice wasn’t as deep, but it was enough to remind her of Hephaestus. Unbidden, memories of their night together came rushing back to her. Aphrodite gritted her teeth as she felt the desire for his husband almost overwhelming her. She shook her head, as if these thoughts were mere flies buzzing around her head, and forced a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“You sound confident. Should I expect something good?”</p>
<p>“You’ll regret ever asking that.”</p>
<p>“Words are wind. I’ll believe it when I see it. Or rather, feel it.”</p>
<p>Ares snorted with laughter at that.</p>
<p>“Alright. Where do you want to do it? I recently captured a new temple that looks pretty good. Shall we go there?”</p>
<p>The goddess of love appreciated the gesture, but Aphrodite had no intention of leaving Olympus. Her plan required her to remain here, where no corner was safe from sight or hearing of a god or goddess.</p>
<p>“No, I prefer my sanctuary, if it’s all the same to you.”</p>
<p>With a lone eyebrow raised, Ares asked shrewdly, “Bold of you, dear. Are you trying to start any rumors?”</p>
<p><em>Yes, that’s it, </em>thought Aphrodite as she flashed another one of her dazzling smiles.</p>
