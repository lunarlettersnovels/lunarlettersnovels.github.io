            <p><strong>Chapter 24 – Drunk in Passion (I)</strong></p>
<p>“You asked for this marriage, Hephaestus,” said Aphrodite.</p>
<p>He inclined his head. “You’re…right.”</p>
<p>“And you’re refusing me?”</p>
<p>“I…how could I do that?” he protested. “I’m not trying to say no, I’m just-”</p>
<p>She hushed him. “I don’t want to hear it.”</p>
<p>Hephaestus fell silent.</p>
<p>“I still have questions to be answered.”</p>
<p>Before their wedding, they had each agreed to allow the other to ask three questions each, and to answer with only the truth. Hephaestus had already used up his allotted questions, and now it was Aphrodite’s turn.</p>
<p><em>I swore not to use my questions in vain… Who would have thought I would end up using them like this? </em>Still, Aphrodite didn’t think she was wasting them. There was no surer way to bring Hephaestus on board than this.</p>
<p>She leaned toward him with a pretty smile and whispered, “I’ll ask one of my questions now, Hephaestus. You want to hug me, don’t you?”</p>
<p>She could have phrased it in much more explicit terms, but she kept it modest for her embarrassed groom.</p>
<p>Hephaestus hesitated. Then he closed his eyes and opened his full lips, the ones that Aphrodite found so charming, and spoke as if he was admitting defeat. “Yes, you’re right.”</p>
<p>Her hunt was a success. A radiant smile blossomed on Aphrodite’s face.</p>
<p>“Then do it,” she told him.</p>
<p>His arms, which hung awkwardly at his sides, wrapped around her waist. Aphrodite had been waiting for this moment, and gave herself to him utterly. He lifted her gently off her feet and carried her over to the bed.</p>
<p>Aphrodite’s bed was festooned with fragrant flowers and silk pillows. A cloud of perfume hung around it like invisible curtains. The goddess lay down on her back, looking up at her husband as he climbed on top of her.</p>
<p>She’d never thought of him as unattractive. She liked the way he looked, and it made her look forward to what he was going to do to her. He was heavily muscled and strong, imposing even though he wasn’t trying to show off.</p>
<p>“I might be clumsy,” he warned her.</p>
<p>His hesitant confession didn’t bother her either. <em>It’s pretty cute that he was gruff and stoic all this time only to become honest at the end. </em>She burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I won’t kick,” she reassured him.</p>
<p>Hephaestus’s lips gave a strange twitch. <em>Did he just smile?</em> She wanted to see more of his expression, but she was distracted by his large hands working to divest her of her clothes. Her thin bridal robe opened easily, revealing her breasts in their immaculate entirety. She felt a flicker of embarrassment at Hephaestus staring at her bare chest. However, that was forgotten the moment he grabbed both her breasts in his big hands.</p>
<p>His hot palms cupped her breasts while his hard fingers rubbed across her nipples until they stiffened and stood up. The small, raised beads of flesh were soon sandwiched between his reddened fingers.</p>
<p>“Ah…hah….” Aphrodite gasped.</p>
<p>His claim that he might be clumsy was a lie. Whenever Hephaestus rubbed or pulled her nipples, it sent bolts of heat down to her lower abdomen. Aphrodite’s hips shook back and forth as she struggled with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Why did you even, ah, pretend to be clumsy?”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you’re enjoying it.”</p>
<p>Hephaestus’s already low voice had dropped even lower. Goosebumps rose on Aphrodite’s back and liquid pooled between her thighs. And this was just the beginning. Hephaestus continued to toy with her breasts while he pushed his knees between her thighs. Only a thin layer of underwear covered her privates, a fragile barrier barely separating her from the press of Hephaestus’s hard thigh. Her core clenched in excitement.</p>
<p>“<em>Ah</em>!”</p>
<p>Aphrodite’s head tilted back on the cushions as she trembled in pleasure. His rock-hard thigh continued to press against her soft flesh. She remembered that it was those thick, strong legs she’d seen and been attracted to when she’d visited Hephaestus’s sanctuary. His muscles had glistened in the heat, shifting under his skin whenever he moved. The memory was vivid and a tingle ran down her spine once again. Back then, she could only imagine how strong he was. Now she knew the truth; he was even stronger in reality.</p>
<p>“<em>Haah…</em>”</p>
<p>The god began to rub her with his thigh and she squirmed in ecstasy. The hard muscle nudged against her sensitive area again and again. Her wet underwear pressed against her flesh and peeled away with each movement, heightening the sensation. From time to time his manhood, which was much hotter than the flesh of his thighs, brushed against her, making her impatient.<br>
