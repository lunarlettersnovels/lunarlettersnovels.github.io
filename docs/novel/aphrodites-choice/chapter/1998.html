            <p><strong>Chapter 31 – It’s Me, Hephaestus</strong></p>
<p>Aphrodite shooed Athena away in annoyance. She was getting worn out from trying to keep calm. There was not much room for her to listen to Athena speaking on behalf of Zeus. She bit the inside of her lips and stared in the direction of Zeus’ sanctuary. <em>Oh, how much longer will I have to wait? Just show up already.</em></p>
<p>Maybe Hephaestus heard the voice inside her head as Aphrodite could now hear the voice she had waited for so long.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite quickly turned her head. Hephaestus had the same appearance as always. His black hair was tied together, and he was wearing black clothes with no patterns or decorations with a brown outerwear that fell down to his ankles. There was no single bracelet or a pendant on him. His simple appearance stood out among the gods dressed up in fancy clothing and jewelry for the feast.</p>
<p><em>I only</em> <em>missed him because he approached me from my blind spot; if he was walking towards me from any other direction, I would have spotted him right away. But what about him? Will he be able to find me right away? </em>Although she had decorated herself with beautiful garments, she did not feel confident.</p>
<p>Feeling resentful, she spoke in a sarcastic tone. “Well, well, who is this?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“I think I saw you somewhere before… where was it? Oh, did you attend my wedding?”</p>
<p>Athena sighed from behind. Of course, Aphrodite ignored her and continued to glare at Hephaestus. Hephaestus did not seem too surprised by Aphrodite’s actions.</p>
<p>“I want to talk.”</p>
<p>“I don’t even know you. What are we going to talk about?”</p>
<p>“Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>“Everyone knows my name in Olympus. I’m asking you who you are.”</p>
<p>He was a man who left his bride after their first night together and had not appeared in front of her for nearly ten days. Aphrodite was not overreacting. In fact, she thought he should be thankful that she didn’t already slap him in the face. However, she was becoming angrier at his composed demeanor. She expected him to apologize and ask her for mercy, but he seemed to have no memory of what he did.</p>
<p>He even gave a sincere, incorrect answer to her question.</p>
<p>“It’s me, Hephaestus.”</p>
<p>“Ha.” Aphrodite became speechless for a moment. <em>Seriously, he’s going to answer with his name? He should have said that he was my husband without even thinking about it! </em>She would let his answer go as a joke if he was smiling at least, but she could not find anything like a smile on his face. He was staring at her dryly.</p>
<p>“Let’s move to a private place first.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite gave no response.</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite was still upset, but could hear a sense of desperation in his voice. She had no choice but to nod. She continued to wear an unpleasant expression, but held Hephaestus’ hand when he reached out to her. She then pouted. The peculiar sense of stability given by his large, warm hands strangely seduced her. She felt that it would be difficult to continue being upset if she held onto it, but she didn’t want to let it go either.</p>
<p>“Can’t you just do one thing?” she asked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The place where Hephaestus took Aphrodite was not too far from the place where the feast was held, but it was in a remote corner where no one was around. The walls and pillars were interlocked in a strange way, blocking the view, and neither light nor wind reached this place, leaving only a dry shade. Aphrodite thought she wouldn’t be noticed by anyone if she hid here.</p>
<p>“It feels like a place of refuge.”</p>
<p>Hephaestus paused from preparing a place to sit for Aphrodite. However, his voice remained the same.</p>
<p>“I had used it for such purpose before.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Sit here.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite sat down on top of Hephaestus’ chestnut coat. Contrary to its boring appearance, the cloth was warm as if it was laced with magic. <em>Hm, better than I thought. </em>She liked how fluffy it was as well. Above all, she was pleased with Hephaestus’ subtle scent which she could smell from the coat. Aphrodite quickly frowned in order to prevent an accidental smile. She forced a cold voice.</p>
<p>“So, what are we going to talk about?”</p>
<p>“First of all, I’m sorry. It was wrong for me to leave the room this morning without telling you anything.”</p>
<p>Aphrodite did not expect him to apologize so quickly like this. It was a very polite apology as well.</p>
<p>“I wanted to say this here instead of the noisy place we were in.”<br>
