            <p><strong>Chapter 21 – The Furies Retreat</strong></p>
<p>Erinyes relented and gazed at Hephaestus with curious eyes. Then, they tilted their heads as they recited a song.</p>
<p>[Almonds, olives, flocks, volcanoes, and sandbars.]</p>
<p>[Then.]</p>
<p>[Was it you?]</p>
<p>Hephaestus did not answer. However, rather than repeating her question, Erinyes burst into laughter. They didn’t seem to be pleased.</p>
<p>[Oh, my god! It was you!]</p>
<p>[You’re choking me!]</p>
<p>The ear-splitting laughter shook the entire space. How fierce and harsh the sound was, their skin prickled as if it was grazed by a sharp blade.</p>
<p>[You took an oath because you knew this would happen, sister!]</p>
<p>Erinyes last remark was aimed at Aphrodite, but she couldn’t understand it either. Aphrodite wanted to ask what it meant, but Hephaestus was far from finished. He spoke once more, “If you knew I deserved enough, Erinyes, please confirm what happened to Aphrodite’s oath.”</p>
<p>The three goddesses were silent.</p>
<p>“I asked you to check again.” Hephaestus’ tone was adamant yet it didn’t lose its respect. Erinyes had a wry look on her face, but she followed Hephaestus’ request as if she couldn’t help it. Her demeanor had shifted, unalike to when she ignored Zeus.</p>
<p>[We are witnesses of the oath.]</p>
<p>[The oath that Aphrodite, the last daughter of heaven, made.]</p>
<p>They returned to the story of oath, and Aphrodite remained at loss. The unresolved outcome continued to distress her. Was she going to lose her memory again? She closed her eyes tightly, anticipating the worst.</p>
<p>But what she heard next was unexpected.</p>
<p>[I see that you are on the right path.]</p>
<p>“Huh? What?” Aphrodite’s eyes widened in surprise. <em>You said it was going to be a mess before, but why are you suddenly changing your words?</em> Erinyes, seeing the confusion in Aphrodite’s face, only spoke the words she needed to say.</p>
<p>[On the day of the oath.]</p>
<p>[For the old memories are returned to their original masters.]</p>
<p>[We will not touch the collateral of the oath.]</p>
<p>Her voice resonated clearly. They seemed very dissatisfied with the fact that they could not have Aphrodite’s memory. The last words that fell from their lips sounded like curses.</p>
<p>[Of course, a chance one in ten thousand. If the oath is broken, Aphrodite will not be able to regain her memory.]</p>
<p>At the end of her declaration, Erinyes ascended the heavens as if she had nothing more to see. The earth was once again agitated by her enormous wings. The road cracked and a shallow root was protruded. Fortunately, nothing happened to Aphrodite. It was owing to Hephaestus, who shielded her like a windbreaker.</p>
<p>Aphrodite stared at Hephaestus’ back with a strange feeling. He kept her safe. Even if her old memories hadn’t returned to her yet, she couldn’t but feel touched, but at the same time, his protection conjured a question in her head. She believed their marriage wasn’t enough reason for risk, and there was nothing else between them either, at least to her knowledge.</p>
<p><em>Then, why? Why did you do that?</em></p>
<p>She wanted to ask him, but the distorted space was restored before she could utter a word. The gods hastily ran toward them and raised their voices in concern.</p>
<p>“Hephaestus, Aphrodite! Are you both safe?”</p>
<p>“Oh, my god, Hephaestus! Did you hurt your face?”</p>
<p><em>What?</em> Startled, Aphrodite pulled Hephaestus, but her strength could barely turn him around. As if he didn’t want to reveal his face to her, Hepeastus turned his head to the other side. Aphrodite demanded, “Show me your injuries.”</p>
<p>“It’s not something you should see.”</p>
<p>“Where is it? If it’s serious, we should hurry up and treat it.”</p>
<p>“It’s a scratch. It’ll be gone in a little while.”</p>
<p><em>What the hell is this nonsense?</em> Aphrodite fumed. She tried to argue, but he held her hand tightly and kept her from seeing his face. He was even stubborn toward Apollo, but eventually showed his injuries to him. Apollo wiped his blood with linen and said, “It’s all healed now.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“I think we can resume the ceremony, is that alright?”</p>
<p>When his wound had healed, Hephaestus turned to look at Aphrodite. Aphrodite narrowed her eyes, scrutinizing every corner of his face. There was not a single trace of injury, but Hephaestus seemed hesitant. He asked, “Do you mind?”</p>
<p>Aphrodite laughed in vain. He was an unpredictable man. If he was her husband, there was nothing to be bored about. <em>Really.</em></p>
