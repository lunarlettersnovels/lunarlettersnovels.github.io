            <p><strong>Chapter 56 – A Pact Between Two Gods</strong></p>
<p>Hephaestus hesitated, like a boy who had forgotten how to speak. The truth was, he grew up not being able to express his honest thoughts, not to his mother, nor to anyone else. Whenever he did, he was ill-treated. He wanted her to stay, of course. But he felt so stunted emotionally that he felt unable to express it.</p>
<p>“Well, then,” she said, turning to leave, “You don’t need to say it if you can’t. I will leave.” She walked to the shore. Hephaestus was aghast. He wanted to stop her somehow.</p>
<p>“Wait!” he shouted after her.</p>
<p>“It alright,” she said reassuringly, “Goodbye, Hephaestus.”</p>
<p>“No!” he said, running after her, “Don’t go!”</p>
<p>It amused her to hear him run after her, kicking gravel to the side. She smiled to herself; her back still turned to him. She walked faster.</p>
<p>“Just stay here, alright?” he said, grabbing her sleeves, and panting from running all the way, “With me.”</p>
<p>It somehow made her feel loads better hearing him finally say it. She looked at his fingers grasping the edge of her sleeve, as though he was afraid to touch her. She turned to him, laughing, and placed her hands on both of his cheeks. He was too amusing. His agitated copper-coloured face, sandwiched between her palms, was in stark contrast to her white hands.</p>
<p>“You should have just said so,” she said to him, “Keep doing it, alright?”</p>
<p>“Keep doing what?” he asked, confused.</p>
<p>“Being honest!” she said happily, “I know it might be difficult in the beginning, but it will get easier. So keep expressing yourself.” He was so silent that he hardly felt tangible for a moment. “Do you understand?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, right,” he said hurriedly, “I will do so.”</p>
<p>“Okay then,” she said with delight, “I will stay here with you.”</p>
<p>Thus, two young gods made a mutual pact to live together.</p>
<p>Limnos had always been an island with many human populations. But they managed to get along without encountering anybody else. It was mostly because they lived in a volcano that wasn’t yet dormant.</p>
<p>“Greeting to the Greater Ones,” the earth gods always address them with reverence. They knew that Hephaestus and the girl were the Olympians who will be seated at the great throne of gods. They held a certain fear and respect regarding them. They had offered to set up a home in the volcano so that no human could interfere. Hephaestus had readily accepted their gift. Their home was named Mt. Moskilos.</p>
<p>The girl took great interest in the home that was so uncannily situated in the volcano, as well as in his work. He tried to answer all her questions, which were endless. It felt good to have someone other than him interested in his creations, his workshop, and everything else. It was refreshing.</p>
<p>He laughed and talked more than he had ever done in his life. He was surprised at this change in himself. He had never thought it was possible for him to feel at peace and happy. He became accustomed to her presence, and he liked it. He felt more alive and looked forward to the start of every day. He had never known it was possible to be close to happiness.</p>
<p>The girl followed him into his workshop every day and looked around. After spending days trying to figure out his tools, equipment and objects, she breathed out a sigh. “I don’t understand it,” she said, “These things are not very fun for me, to say the least.”</p>
<p>“That’s fair,” he said.</p>
<p>“Is that fine?” she asked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Is it okay for me to not like things that you like?” she asked. She was still figuring out the ways to live in this chaotic world. She didn’t know the rules half the time.</p>
<p>“Of course!” he said, surprised. “Not everyone likes the same thing. It is absolutely alright to have different interests, as long as we don’t degrade others for having different preferences.”</p>
<p>He tinkered with his equipment, thinking of something to create. “But you have to accept what I make for you,” he teased.</p>
<p>She chuckled. “Of course!” she said giggling, “You better make it acceptable, though.” She trailed her hand over the half-created things that lay on the table. Her fingers paused on a brooch or what looked like a brooch. “Is this for me as well?” she asked, picking it up, “I can’t tell what it is at this point, though.”</p>
<p>“Not yet,” he grinned, “Those are just random trinkets I made. I need to get the right material to make something for you.”</p>
<p>Hephaestus had envisioned many beautiful accessories to gift her: bracelets, anklets, belts studded with moonstone or starlight, etc. His imagination contained more treasures than Hades’ treasury itself. But it was so difficult, close to impossible, to find the right materials on earth, much less on this barren land.</p>
<p>He wanted his first gift to her to be something magnificent and memorable. He had no intention of giving her things made of simply copper, iron or mixed gold that he had been able to find with some difficulty. He made trinkets to hone his skills, so that if he found the right material, he could create something exquisite to suit her.</p>
<p>“I see,” she said, as she put down the brooch on the worktable. She couldn’t hold in her smile.</p>
