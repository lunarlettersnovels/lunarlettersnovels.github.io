            <p><strong>Chapter 57 – Until the World Ends</strong></p>
<p>“So, are you going to stay here and continue thinking about things to make for me?” she asked, playfully.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, smiling.</p>
<p>“Okay then,” she said, clapping her hands, “You better think of something beautiful, then. I am going for a stroll around the island.”</p>
<p>Hephaestus nodded. “Go ahead,” he said with a smile, “Be careful.”</p>
<p>“I will,” she said and walked out of the workshop with a wink. He raised his hammer and waved at her cheerfully. When she was gone, he turned back to his work. It wasn’t going as smoothly as he planned. He heard a strange rumble, like a sound of thunder where there shouldn’t be any. He felt the being that had materialized on Limnos and was approaching him rapidly. He felt them at the foot of Mt. Moskilos. He walked to the entrance of his home and opened the door. He faced ten or so fully garbed soldiers, their head covered in helmets.</p>
<p>“Sir Hephaestus,” the one who was probably the commander said, “We have come to escort you back to Olympus.” Hephaestus looked at them, uncertainly. A few months back, he wouldn’t have hesitated. He had nothing here or there that was dear to him, so he would have followed them without any concern. But now things had changed. He had found a home here and the girl would be alone.</p>
<p>“What if I don’t want to?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Sorry?” asked the commander, stunned. He was at a loss for words. His instruction was clear: escort Hephaestus to Olympus. He had never faced any opposition from the young god before.</p>
<p>“I asked, what if I don’t want to go back?” repeated Hephaestus in a dangerous voice.</p>
<p>The commander opened his mouth and then closed it. He was silent for a while. “We have no orders regarding that,” he said finally, “We would need to speak to the Lord on how to proceed.”</p>
<p>“Who sent you?” asked Hephaestus, although he had a good enough guess for an answer.</p>
<p>“Lord Zeus,” replied the commander.</p>
<p>Although he mostly knew it, he felt relieved as well as disappointed that it wasn’t Queen Hera. He was disappointed because his mother’s indifference towards him never changed and he could do nothing to change it. He felt relieved because he might be able to discuss his situation with Zeus, the king of the gods.</p>
<p>“Can you convey my message to Lord Zeus?” he asked the commander.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” the commander obliged.</p>
<p>“Please convey that I wish to live here for the rest of my life,” said Hephaestus, choosing his words carefully, “I will not bother Olympus. And I wish for the Olympians to extend the same courtesy. They can pretend I don’t exist. This way, it will be easier and advantageous for both parties concerned.” He looked at the commander squarely in the eyes. “Please relay this message to him without leaving out a word.”</p>
<p>The commander clenched his teeth. He found Hephaestus’ attitude very perplexing and disrespectful to the Lord he served. But he had enough sense to not interfere in godly matters. He bowed to Hephaestus and took his leave with his soldiers.</p>
<p>Hephaestus only relaxed when he sensed the soldiers vanishing one after another, headed for Zeus’ palace. He realized that he had clenched his fists so tight that his nails had drawn blood from his palms. After the last one was gone, he sat down and heaved a relieved sigh, feeling exhausted.</p>
<p>“Is everything alright?” said a voice in the workshop. She had brought the salty breeze of the sea with her, after riding the waves. “You don’t look so well,” she said with concern.</p>
<p>He looked at her, unable to form any coherent words. There were so many thoughts raging in his mind. He wanted her to be safe, more than that, he wanted her to be a secret. For the first time in his life, he had found a friend, a companion, and had tasted happiness. He didn’t want them to find out about her. He didn’t want Hera to find out about all this, especially. He would be left alone again.</p>
<p>“What is it?” she asked, walking over to him. She sat by his side, worry etching her face. “Tell me,” she urged.</p>
<p>How could he tell her in simple words that this island had become a sanctuary for him because of her presence? Hephaestus, the boy-god, seemed so lost and miserable in that moment.</p>
<p>“Hephaestus?” she said.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with emotion and tears streaming down his face, he threw his arms around her. She hugged him back, feeling more worried than before. He was trembling. “I just want to live with you here,” he said, crying.</p>
<p>“Me too!” she said, confused, “But we do live here, so what’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“I mean, I want to live with you forever,” he said, trembling, “Until the world ends.”</p>
<p>She laughed. Hephaestus felt stupid and scared. Had he said too much? Was she going to leave? “It’s a promise, then,” she said.</p>
<p>“What?” he asked, surprised. A lifetime of rejection makes a person always appalled with just one acceptance.</p>
<p>“You said, ‘until the world ends’,” she explained, “Which means you have to promise to watch the end of the world with me, no matter what.” She wrapped her hands around him and held him tightly. She patted him on the back.</p>
<p>Hephaestus felt the heat in his throat and was barely able to respond. “Okay, it’s a promise,” he declared meekly. It wasn’t an oath made binding by swearing on the river Styx, but for the young gods, it might as well have been because it was a genuine promise they had made with all their innocent sincerity. They had never even entertained the idea that it might be broken.<br>
