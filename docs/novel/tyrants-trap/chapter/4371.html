            <p><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>
<p>The person who found her first was Regnart lune Estlenin, the most powerful man in this world and the emperor of the Itaire Empire. She realized this when she was led to the palace and allowed to stay.</p>
<p>Mora thought that, if this was a novel, then Regnart would be the main male character. There was no other reason for him to have everything—power and wealth as well as great magical power, all in addition to his beautiful looks. He had everything. Everything but a good personality.</p>
<p>He acted like a child who had just received his first gift from his parents. He wasn’t used to it and was incredibly tenacious.</p>
<p>“I picked you up so you are mine!” he declared. “Can’t I do whatever I want?”</p>
<p>If he hadn’t randomly shown up and bullied her by saying this, she might have naturally fallen in love with him. He was her savior and there was no way for her to reject him.</p>
<p>Even the people from the temple who called her “saintess” only had brief moments and opportunities to be with her because of the emperor’s insistence. Emperor Regnart’s power was absolute and nobody could deny him.</p>
<p>Though she was annoyed, Mora was adjusting to this world as best as she could. It wasn’t like she had much of a choice.</p>
<p>But then, someone else showed up in her life.</p>
<p>Even though he was only three years older than her, he was hailed as a prodigy and called the Empire’s Sword. He was the grandmaster of the palace’s order of knights, Kirkalas Cententa. Kirkalas was the closest to the emperor and he was known on the battlefield as an abandoned prince. So, Regnart had Kirkalas guard Mora.</p>
<p>She was glad to see another black-haired person. It was easy to get used to dark blue eyes. Kirkalas was handsome but he didn’t feel as inhuman as Regnart did. Naturally, she was able to hold proper conversations with him and, as time passed, they grew close.</p>
<p>Until one day.</p>
<p><em>“Will you allow me to put you in my heart?”</em></p>
<p>Kirkalas confessed his feelings. It was the first time he had ever done so. Mora was so flustered that she didn’t give him an answer, but she did start to notice him more in that light.</p>
<p>They say the phase of flirting before entering into a relationship is the best time, and they are right. She blushed whenever their eyes met and she always tried her best to look pretty. She spent more time with him. Kirkalas was kinder and nicer than Regnart towards her. She naturally started catching feelings for him.</p>
<p>Considering the emperor’s liking to Mora, they would be in great danger if the emperor found out that they were dating in secret. Every day, every moment they shared was as sweet as a dream. Mora liked this world now that Kirkalas was in it. She didn’t even want to go back. It was the first time in her life that her days were filled with so much sunshine and joy.</p>
<p>But that happiness was at risk when she found out Kirkalas was preparing to commit treason against the crown. Mora was terrified.</p>
<p>“What are you doing!” she exclaimed. “You’re going to die if you do this!”</p>
<p>“I know,” he told her. “But a knight must put his life on the line for his principals.”</p>
<p>He told her that the emperor was a tyrant. He had killed many nobles who were against him and had taken the throne from his little nephew. He was also preparing for a war that no one wanted.</p>
<p>From what Kirkalas had told her, Mora found the emperor to be nothing short of cruel and she had to consider the evidence that he had shown her very hard. She knew that the fate of this world would change depending on the side she chose.</p>
<p>If she chose Regnart, then she would have to marry him instead of Kirkalas as she knew that Regnart believed that marrying the saintess would solidify his power. This was the best way to get people on his side, then after he could start wars against the neighboring countries that he didn’t like on a whim. Many innocent people would die.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if she chose Kirkalas, war wouldn’t happen. The young former emperor who lost his throne to his uncle would find his place again and the Empire would become peaceful. She also wouldn’t have to bid farewell to her lover Kirkalas.</p>
<p>“I’ll accept your decision and will be alright with whichever side you choose,” Kirkalas told her. “The people who are with me will resent me for this, but, above all, I want you to be safe.”</p>
<p>While he said that he would respect Mora’s decision, the desperate look in his eyes said otherwise.</p>
<p>“But to tell you the truth, Mora.” He swallowed the lump in his throat. “I need you. I don’t want the emperor, a man who doesn’t even know what love is, to have you.”</p>
<p>Mora couldn’t ignore Kirkalas for the way that he had needed her. She felt like if she didn’t make the right decision, she would regret it for the rest of her life. She didn’t want war to happen. She wanted peace to persevere.</p>
<p>In the end, she chose to be on Kirkalas’s side.</p>
<p>She knew that Regnart would come to her eventually for no reason at all. He would force her to try all kinds of different food. Even if she said she wasn’t feeling well, he would force her to take a bite of each dish and would only stop when Mora ran to the bathroom. Then, he would fall asleep on the sofa as usual.</p>
<p>When he eventually came to her and fell asleep on the sofa, she knew it was time to act.</p>
