            <p><b>Chapter 21 – Hidden No Longer </b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘But I didn’t trample on it?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300;">Just as Levisia began to feel something was amiss, she walked over to her presenting something in her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“Do I have to host another tea party which was not on the schedule just for you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Levisia almost went deaf with Elizabeth loudly scolding her. She ended up making a retort. “I’m sorry?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“I am inviting you officially, giving you another chance to attend my tea party. I am especially giving you this chance for the first time!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The golden invitation shone brightly in the sun. Elizabeth held her chin high flapping the invitation in the air. With an expression on her face as if to say, ‘be grateful!’</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘What is going on here?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300;">Levisia</span> <span style="font-weight: 300;">blinked her eyes out of bewilderment but soon greeted her. “Second Princess, your highness?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“Yes. I am Elizabeth Seine Kraiden. Kraiden’s second royal daughter. Levisia White, you daren’t say you don’t know me?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘It’s not hard  to know if you introduce yourself like that.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 300;"> Levisia thought of what to do for a bit, then politely returned the invitation. “I must say I cannot attend the tea party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“What? You will trample my invitation again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She never trampled the invite; she only politely declined it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“There must be a misunderstanding. I did not trample your invitation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“Declining my invite is the same as trampling it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She must love trampling things! Just then the invitation fell to the floor, as if to ask to be trampled. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘What, what’s this?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300;">Levisia quickly stepped backward for fear of actually trampling on it. Then she heard a sharp voice in front of her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“You’d even avoid me right in front of my face?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘She’s driving me insane!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“N-no, you misunderstand. What I am trying to say is, your highness doesn’t have to go out of your way to hold another tea party for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Now that she has come all the way here to find Levisia, there was no way to avoid her. But Levisia would rather see her anywhere but a suffocating situation as a tea party. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘I rather should’ve…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Perhaps declining Elizabeth’s invitation brought on this misfortune just as Lidan said. ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">Who knew she’d come find me herself…’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 300;"> Levisia continued, on the verge of abandoning any hope. “If your highness desires an audience with me, a little time for a friendly chat would suffice.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘I don’t need anything fancy like a tea party…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Elizabeth’s eye brows twitched at Levisia’s words. Soon, a cool grin spread on her face. “So, you also want to have an audience with me! Then why did you decline my invite? Did you want me to come all the way out here for you myself? Then you have succeeded!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She rattled on so quickly that Levisia’s head was beginning to spin. “Why…” How will Levisia bring her back here when she’s gone so far ahead, as far as the space, all on her own?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">As if the universe were against her, the agony was becoming worse every second.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 300;">* * *  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Elizabeth and Levisia moved to a different room. They didn’t go too far, just to the same sitting room where she welcomed Lidan. Sheila brought out tea and remained quiet. Elizabeth looked around the tiny space and furrowed her eye brows as if something wasn’t to her liking. At the sametime, she enjoyed her cup of tea.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘Such an odd person…’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 300;"> Levisia picked up her tea as she pondered Elizabeth’s strange character. It was really torturous sitting there just drinking tea without saying anything. Just as Levisia began to feel full, she started to seriously worry. What sort of conversation are they to have?</span><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">  ‘Before that, why did her highness desire my audience?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She had just opened her mouth to ask the question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Crash! With a loud noise two people burst through the open door. Startled, Levisia looked to the door but Elizabeth didn’t even flinch, as though she already knew. She even continued to sip her tea and criticized them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“What thoughtless behavior is this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“Elizabeth!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“Sister Elizabeth!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Unsurprisingly, the two people were Lidan and Siaphyl. They seemed to have run all the way here and addressed her without catching their breaths. Elizabeth set her tea down and turned around towards them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“The look on your faces.” Her remark left them speechless as if they were caught off guard. “How does it feel to have this child discovered by me?” Elizabeth pointed to Levisia with her chin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘Discovered?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Just as Levisia’s head tilted, Elizabeth looked at her. “Yes. There has to be a reason those two have tried to conceal you to this extent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The situation and nuance all indicated she was talking about her. But Levisia didn’t have a clue as to what about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“Whatever do you mean?” Levisia asked her with genuine curiosity but she retorted with another question. “You, who are you? How did you bewitch two of my brothers to you?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘Bewitch them…? I mean, if you looked at Lidan and Siaphyl, you could most definitely say they were bewitched. Seeing as how they suddenly showed interest in me when we never had any acquaintance beforehand. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300;">But no matter how much she asked, Levisia couldn’t give her an answer. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">‘I should be asking that. I want to know too.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 300;"> If she did indeed have an ability to bewitch them, Levisia wanted to hide it entirely and escape the royal grounds safely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“I would like to know as well. Why are the three of you seeking me out like this all of a sudden?”</span></p>
