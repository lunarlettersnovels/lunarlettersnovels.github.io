            <p>She had never wanted to see Siaphyl as an adult. It makes no difference to her whether he is honorable or dishonorable in front of her. But if she said that, she would be lying…</p>
<p>Levisia reflected for a moment before making a plausible statement.</p>
<p>“I believe that is more humane and beneficial.”</p>
<p>“Are you alive?”</p>
<p>Levisia shifted her weight onto Siaphyl. His eyes opened, as if he’d heard something unusual.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be tedious if everything was perfect on a scale of one to ten?” It only takes a certain bit of humanity to feel familiar.”</p>
<p>The same might be said with Siaphyl and the other Kraidens. They each have an own personality. The commonalities were their exceptional ability and intrinsic personalities, and the difference was that they appeared perfect, although they were flawed at times.</p>
<p>What they lack serves as a reminder that they are living, breathing beings. Levisia placed a high value on this.</p>
<p>Siaphly, who appeared befuddled, burst out laughing. It wasn’t the Siaphyl she remembered, who had always been a proper young man. It was the first time she had heard him laughing so loudly.</p>
<p>“Only you could say something like that.”</p>
<p>Why? Is it because he is the most humanitarian member of the imperial family, with no flaws?</p>
<p>But the next thing Siaphy said was the polar opposite of what she expected.</p>
<p>“No one…</p>
<p>Nobody wants to see that side of us.”</p>
<p>Siaphyl didn’t simply point to himself; he used the word “we.” It was not difficult to deduce that it referred to Kraiden.</p>
<p>“This isn’t what you’re expecting from us.”</p>
<p>The laughter abruptly stopped, leaving just the dry voice of an adult who has been through everything before and after childbirth. It was cloudy inside the half-opened wall, as though in thought.</p>
<p>For a few period, Levisia was forced to remain mute as she felt the weight of Siaphly’s petite shoulders.</p>
<p>All Kraidens, including Siaphyl, share a great feeling of pride. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that some of them had sky-high nose bridges.</p>
<p>It is natural for people to become frustrated with others. However, they did not appear to be free because they were inside the wall.</p>
<p>They were struggling in their own way to avoid conforming to others’ expectations. to appear faultless</p>
<p>It could have been a protective strategy to avoid revealing vulnerabilities while armed with strong self-esteem.</p>
<p>So, what happened to Siaphyl, who was born and appeared to be the youngest? The level of expectation is comparable to what his elder brothers experienced.</p>
<p>Siaphyl would have worked hard to catch up with them as soon as he discovered this. He would have run till his legs were ripped apart.</p>
<p>Siaphyl is a person who lives with the modifier “genius,” although she was aware of how hard Siaphly normally works. If it’s too tight, will tiny hands become stuck in areas exactly like adults?</p>
<p>It happened as she was staring at Siaphly’s hand on the blanket. Siaphyl said as if after much consideration.</p>
<p>“I suppose so.”</p>
<p>“… … ?”</p>
<p>Siaphyl moaned slightly, as if recalling a good experience.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I feel like my siblings are younger than me.” I’ve never been that naive…”</p>
<p>Those were the words of the youngest. What if it was juvenile? They also needed to think about it.</p>
<p>“Ah, but you have to keep what I said a secret.”</p>
<p>As he placed his index finger on Levisia’s lips, Siaphyl muttered. The youngster nodded his head, clearly relieved.</p>
<p>His blue eyes became weary all of a sudden. The small guy whispered after a few pauses, blinking his eyes gently.</p>
<p>“I’ve always felt at ease next to you, but tonight, something more……”</p>
<p>She could see the edges of Siaphly’s lips twisted slightly just before he fell asleep. He smiled more carelessly than he did when he laughed.</p>
