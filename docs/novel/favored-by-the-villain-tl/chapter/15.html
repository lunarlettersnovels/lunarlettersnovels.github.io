            <p>Not too long after making that decision, a maid Levisia had seen for the first time came to her and said,</p>
<p>Miss Aurora has asked to see you.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Why was the princess who had only recently returned to Kraiden looking for her, of all people?</p>
<p>Levisia suppressed the urge to sink her eyebrows before saying,</p>
<p>“By chance are you mistaking me for someone else?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, madam. Miss Aurora has said that she specifically wants to see Levisia White.”</p>
<p>“Did she give a reason?”</p>
<p>“She did not. I’m sorry, madam.”</p>
<p>“No… it’s okay,” she said, waving a hand at the bowing maid. No way a subordinate could ask such a thing of his or her master.</p>
<p>So, what now? She looked back at Sheila’s room as she thought about it. It saddened her to have to leave an injured Sheila by herself.</p>
<p><em>But to bring Pel back here…</em></p>
<p>Their conversation from a little while ago interrupted her thoughts. Just as expected, it might be embarrassing to have to face each other now.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, there is a patient inside. I am the only one looking after her, so I can’t really leave her side. By chance can Princess Aurora take my spot?”</p>
<p>The maid’s head tilted as if she couldn’t understand why someone with Levisia’s status was looking after someone.</p>
<p>“Then when will she be able to do it?”</p>
<p>Today seemed difficult, and she didn’t think she could see Pel again until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Weighing her options, she replied, hoping that Aurora was not the Elizabeth-type,</p>
<p>“I think tomorrow morning will be okay.”</p>
<p>Now that she has told the maid a specific time, Aurora wouldn’t suspect that Levisia was rejecting her offer to meet.</p>
<p>“I shall relay that message to Miss Aurora, please excuse me.”</p>
<p>Aurora’s maid left respectfully.</p>
<p>That day, she stayed by Sheila’s side until dawn.</p>
<p>“That’s what happened, so please stay here by Sheila.”</p>
<p>Having run into Pel early in the morning, they behaved like nothing had happened between them the day before.</p>
<p>However, despite her efforts, Pel didn’t seem to be listening to Levisia.</p>
<p>Even after she had finished talking, he looked up at her for such a long time, prompting her to ask,</p>
<p>“…you listening?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I am listening.”</p>
<p>It was a dry answer. She decided to check him.</p>
<p>“So what did I say just now?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>That’s when a beam of light entered his eyes. Like he had been thinking of something different this whole time.</p>
<p>“Look! You aren’t even listening!”</p>
<p>“You told me to look after Sheila.”</p>
<p>“… I’m listening.”</p>
<p>But why did it seem like he wasn’t listening? she mumbled to herself, feeling foolish and embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Then I will be back soon.”</p>
<p>Aurora’s maid, who’d eagerly come to Levisia’s room, was waiting outside of her door.</p>
<p>“Just a second.”</p>
<p>As she was passing by Pel, she was caught in that voice.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Though she had asked calmly, her voice might have been trembling a bit.</p>
<p>That’s how nervous she was. If Pel brings up what they talked about yesterday, she may have to spend all day outside and come back tonight.</p>
<p>“Have you slept?”</p>
<p>She hoped he was being sarcastic while wanting to ask: “Did you have a good night’s rest?”</p>
<p>Levisia was having a twisted thought for a moment, when she concluded that Pel couldn’t be that way and replied,</p>
<p>“Yep, I di—”</p>
<p>“Liar.”</p>
<p>He cut her off as soon as she opened her mouth. What she had tried to say was now shoved down her throat.</p>
<p>Because Pel was right.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying you look sleepy.”</p>
<p>His fingertip touched below her eye before he quickly withdrew it. He had probably found out because of the bags under her eyes.</p>
<p><em>Are my eyes that sunken?</em></p>
<p>They were never like that except when they looked a little rough after washing her face, but it was strange. Though she knew that Pel was quick-witted…</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“But how come—”</p>
<p>“Sheila has been suffering all morning. I think she’s in a lot of pain, so I stayed by her side.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>In her mind, Levisia said to him precisely, “It’s because of you.”</p>
<p>Perhaps that was conveyed to him, he turned his eyes away from her.</p>
<p>“Then I will be by Sheila’s side tonight.”</p>
<p>He stepped off on his way to Sheila’s room after saying that.</p>
<p>Ugh, so difficult. I mustn’t keep Aurora’s maid waiting outside for too much longer, Levisia thought.</p>
<p>She hesitated and stomped in place before grabbing Pel.</p>
<p>“You can’t. You haven’t slept.”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>His eyes widened a little. It was for a second, but it showed that her guess was the answer.</p>
<p>“I just randomly threw that out there, but I guess it’s true.”</p>
<p>“…if you say so, woman.”</p>
<p><em>Woman?</em> While she paused at the random word, he pulled the arm that she was grabbing. She hadn’t let her hand go, so her body was jerked toward him.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Her forehead brushed his arm. Then she felt his arm go around her waist as if he had intended to do so.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to put a distance between us, do it properly.”</p>
<p>“What…”</p>
<p>Pel’s head lowered and tilting to the side, stopped at her ear. Then he whispered to the frozen Levisia,</p>
<p>“Stop your unnecessary flirting.”</p>
