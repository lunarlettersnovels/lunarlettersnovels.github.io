            <p><b>Chapter 24 – Still No Change </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Levisia’s fingertips touched the Fairy Stone, it began to tremble.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of one’s power was measured by the saturation of the color the stone changes into. Elizabeth was popular for having the stone change its shade into a deep hue of yellow, depicting her destructive power to manipulate electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia, on the other hand…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are unbelievably weak.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stone exhibited no change in color; in fact the gem remained exactly as it is: bright green. It showed not the slightest change in its saturation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just as I thought. You wouldn’t have any power.” Elizabeth waved her hand in dismissal. However, the stone’s answer provided her relief. Levisia breathed a sigh which she’d been holding and asked, “Then may I leave now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth scrunched her forehead. “What do you mean? I’m not feeling well so tend to me before you go.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">..What?’</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been three days since Elizabeth has claimed she ‘wasn’t feeling well’, and consequently, Levisia had to come by her palace since then to tend after her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What did I do in my previous life to deserve this?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Levisia would do is go to Elizabeth’s office and watch her to do her work. When she grew bored of it, she’d look around the library attached to Elizabeth’s office… and eat with her when it was time.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Perhaps through another person’s spectacles, I was the one being tended. Well, at least I haven’t seen Lidan and Siaphyl thanks to this ordeal…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Look, she came today again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been three days since she attracted unwanted attention as well. A group of men huddled together muttered whispers with one another, fixing their gazes at Levisia. She couldn’t bother to spare a glance at their way and only hurried her steps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main palace where Elizabeth undertook her royal responsibilities constantly had many people come and go, mostly because most prominent figures always gathered here. However, noticing Levisia presence for the third day at a place one would need to be authorized to enter provoked tittle-tattles about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who did she line up behind?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve never seen her? Which family is she from?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Should I line up there too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didn’t even know she was a princess. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Well… Not even all the royalties know each other, so it’s not surprising.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she hastened her pace, deliberately ignoring them, someone suddenly stepped in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Levisia looked up, one of the whispering men she passed by stood before, an awkward smile painted on his lips. “Um, could we talk for a minute?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It won’t be long, I just need a moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, she noticed a group slowly approaching behind him. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Darn it, I’ve been caught.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling embarrassed, Levisia shook her head. “I’m sorry. I have to be in there by 11 o’clock.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s 10:50 right now.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Why does he seem rather rude?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Levisia must’ve sensed correctly as he smiled saying it was a mistake. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’m not in the mood for smiling…’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was rather exhausting, so she decided to concede and nodded, “We can talk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, from which family you might be from?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stared at him without a word. Levisia already knew this man standing before her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sixteenth Prince, Vager Roffle. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he’s older than her, he was introduced into the royal family later than Levisia. This will be embarrassing for him, but she needed to get going. “I’m-”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, Rabbit?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A familiar voice interrupted from behind. When she turned her head around, Levisia saw Lidan smiling and waving his hand at her. “I’ve finally run into you. Are you going to Elizabeth’s office today too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-the Third Prince, Your Highness?” Vager eyes widened, not because of Levisia but of Lidan. When Lidan heard his name addressed, he blinked his eyes and asked her, “Who is this? Do you know him? I have no idea who this is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lies, Levisia thought. There was no way Lidan, who instantly recognized her, wouldn’t know Vager. At least his power was measured to a three.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is Vager Roffle, your highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh, what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vager, not expecting Levisia to know his name, appeared bewildered and pointed at her with his finger. Just then, Lidan grabbed and folded his finger down and smiled. “This is the Fifteenth Princess Levisia White. Let’s try to at least know each other’s faces, brother.” Lidan then stretched his arm toward Levisia after introducing her to Vager, “Shall we go then, sis?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t need a hand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re being too hard, I haven’t seen you in a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, Levisia entered the main palace with Lidan, leaving behind the pale-faced Vager. For some reason, Lidan followed behind Levisia just like he did back at her own palace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Didn’t you have some business to tend to?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s something I must do first before my own business right in front of me.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I shouldn’t have asked.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hurriedly arrived at Elizabeth’s office. When Levisia knocked on the door, she heard a voice telling her to come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you going to come in with me as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Might as well see our Elizabeth’s face since I’m here.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t think you were that close to her to say ‘our Elizabeth’.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she had expected, when Elizabeth saw Lidan entering in with Levisia, she immediately ordered him to leave.</span></p>
