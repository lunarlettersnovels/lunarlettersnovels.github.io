            <p><b>Chapter 23 – Strange Tingles</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia stopped when she heard a voice as she entered the office. Then she looked at how differently she was dressed. This pale green dress, one of the dresses Elizabeth sent, was quite luxurious. So much that Sheila kept admiring it as she helped Levisia into it. She thought of what Sheila said, so deeply touched, that finally her lady gets to wear a dress like this. She had to show her gratitude.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for lending me the dress, your highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“L-lend you? What do you mean? You want me to wear clothes that you’ve worn?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But you sent me three dresses…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I- I said I found them on my way over here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even all the necklaces as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes!” Elizabeth insisted.  “More importantly, come over here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confused, she walked over to where Elizabeth was beckoning. There was a large light green gem wrapped in silk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the Fairy Stone. You’ve seen it before at least once?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I have seen it before…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every child adopted into the royal family has touched this Fairy Stone at least once. It measures the strength of one’s natural ability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Be grateful it is under my care. I will especially give you another chance to touch it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incredulous, Levisia took a couple steps back. It probably won’t measure any differently now but one can never be too sure.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What if it did change?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others might tell Levisia she’s counting her chickens before they’re hatched, but this was an important matter to her. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘There has never been a case where the results changed…’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident in the Fairy Forest kept coming to her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I said come here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know how much my ability measures. There is no need to do it ag-” As Levisia withdrew a few steps, Elizabeth inched towards her. “You do not know your ability and yet you are trying to hide it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She saw right through her then grabbed a hold of her hand. Just then, a painful tingly feeling spread from Levisia’s fingertips. Elizabeth must’ve felt the same thing; she let go of her hand and frowned. “You, what did you do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry? I didn’t do anything..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then why is my strength…” Elizabeth stumbled as she spoke. Startled, Levisia instinctively grabbed her arm. “Are you okay, Your Highness?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let- let me go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth shook her arm weakly. Why is she like this all of a sudden? Suddenly, the words ‘crime of assasination of the imperial family’ in bold red symbols flashed fleetingly in Levisia’s head.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘No!’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she doesn’t do anything, she could get all the blame. Levisia quickly escorted her to the sofa and sat her down. “Your highness, are you feeling better? Your Highness?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she sat there still frowned and gasping for air, even her eyes seemed hazy. Levisia looked around and brought over the tea that appeared to be hers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your highness, drink this.” She tipped the cup on her lips holding her chin up and Elizabeth weakly took a sip. When the cup was empty, she began to ponder. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Should I call her attendant over her?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no more spare time to debate. A person collapsed after losing her strength, she needed to do what she could do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please wait just a moment, your highness. I’ll have your attendants call the doctor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W..ait…” Elizabeth grabbed her hand again. This time there was no tingling sensation. “My hand…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Elizabeth didn’t finish her sentence, Levisia realized what she was going to say and clasped her hand with hers.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It seemed like she was asking me to hold her hand.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wasn’t sure if this was right, but Elizabeth closed her eyes as soon as Levisia held her hand. So she was right. After holding hands for some time, her breathing relaxed and she opened her eyes. Soon she looked up at her and asked, “You, what… really are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m Levisia White, your highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s nothing else besides…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, there was nothing she could do for Elizabeth’s frowning face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you feeling better now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Much better than before. Take your hand off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Erm, you are holding my hand, Your Highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth was startled as she looked down at their clasped hands and immediately snatched hers from her. “Hm, hmph!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘You may hide your hands, but it already happened, Your highness, princess.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia swallowed the words she couldn’t say out loud. After a long silence, Elizabeth had regained her composure, and she was able to ask her about what just happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, your strength left you after the tingling sensation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. And you really didn’t do it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why would I do such a thing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident became more and more baffling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I also felt the tingling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But you were fine though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s true…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So it was your doing-”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth rubbed her temples as though she had a headache. Levisia’s head was hurting as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why won’t you touch the Fairy Stone? Is something weighing on your mind?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia rubbed her cheeks without saying a word. She glanced at the Fairy Stone laid out on the desk. “Could I bring the Fairy Stone over here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After having Elizabeth’s permission, she moved the stone to the table. When Levisia set the silk wrap down, Elizabeth gave her a look. A look to coax her into doing something.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘…Guess there’s nothing I can do.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia took a deep breath and reached out her hand.</span></p>
