            <p><b>Chapter 27 – In a Somber Palace</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A week has passed since Levisia visited the main palace. Unlike other days, she was told Elizabeth wasn’t in her office.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please wait in the sitting room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She found it strange for someone to be extremely devoted to her duties to be absent from her workplace. She wondered what it could be. As she followed the attendant, she kept glancing at the office door. It seemed like Elizabeth would be on her desk like any other day if she opened the door right now, so bizarre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will bring tea out. Please wait for a moment.” The attendant quickly left the room. Levisia looked around the sitting room she was led to and hesitantly took a seat.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Everything looks expensive.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was, in great measures, different from the temporary sitting room in her old shabby palace. If the main palace’s sitting room is like this, she wondered how luxurious the sitting room of Elizabeth’s palace would be.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Now I see why she was so displeased that day.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could almost guess why Elizabeth’s face hardened when she looked around the sitting room the day she came to her palace the first time. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She’s only seen sitting rooms like these.’  </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia scratched her cheeks as she looked down at the tea cup the attendant brought out. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I shouldn’t get used to this.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She felt like if she stayed here too long, she’ll find herself having unreasonably high expectations. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I need to go back to my secluded life as soon as I can.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She already emptied her third cup of tea as she reminisced about her usual, dull days. Levisia stared at the clock realizing the time ruthlessly passing by.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been two hours already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She still didn’t hear anything from Elizabeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll wait just thirty minutes more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She passed the time walking around the sitting room and looking down the long window but nothing changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I should go now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps today would be the last day of her visit since she wasn’t told to come back tomorrow again.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She’ll call me when she really needs me.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia didn’t believe Elizabeth was still not feeling well from the incident the other day. It was obvious. She recovered on that same day. But Levisia still came to the main palace every day only because she couldn’t disobey her words.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This commoner nature… Who am I to disobey Elizabeth’s wishes? This is not surprising. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She left her seat and opened the door. Just as Levisia was about to let the door attendant that she was going to leave, a handmaiden rushed over and grabbed her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fifteenth Princess, Your Highness.” She spoke without catching her breath. “The Second Princess Her Highness asked to escort you to her. Could you come with me right now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth came herself to see Levisia at her palace but this time she sent a handmaiden to fetch her. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I wonder what this could be?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stood there as if her feet were tied down. Levisia thought for a moment and eventually nodded. The handmaiden appeared visibly relieved and nodded her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then please follow me.” She turned around and began to walk without hesitation. Levisia quietly followed behind her. But she was leaving the main palace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are we leaving the palace?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. The Second Princess Her Highness is at a different palace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She decided to accept that answer. The handmaiden left the main palace and went towards the outskirts of the main buildings.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I don’t think Elizabeth’s palace would be in the outskirts…?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always having mountains of work every day, Elizabeth had an important duty even amongst the Kraidens. There was no way she would have a palace in a secluded place as she does. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did Elizabeth really call me?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia glanced at the handmaiden, but she didn’t notice as she was too busy walking. As her suspicions grew deeper, a palace overshadowed by another palace appeared. At the entrance, there was Elizabeth.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘So it was her…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After momentarily realizing she doubted for no reason, Levisia noticed Elizabeth looked very different from her normal appearance. She nervously paced back and forth, biting her lips, very unlike her normal self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, Your Highness?” When Levisia called her from an audible distance, she looked at her. Elizabeth approached Levisia with a look of someone who had found a sliver of hope after falling into despair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Help, help me!” Elizabeth urgently grabbed her hands like she did before. Levisia couldn’t rip her hands off and stupidly replied, “I’m sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up close, Elizabeth’s face was pale. Seeing her lips trembling Levisia realized this was a serious matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come… this way!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia was quickly whisked into the palace. The interior of the palace looked quiet. It appeared like even the palace residents haven’t been coming by for some time. There Elizabeth let go of her composure and ran up the stairs. Holding on to Levisia hand with hers, of course. That is to say, she was following her without intending to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is going on?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth’s behavior was odd but so was the all too quiet palace. Our footsteps echoed throughout the palace because of the vast emptiness.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It almost seems like we’re at a funeral…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Levisia rid her mind of the dark thoughts, they arrived at a room on the second floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait, Your Highness-” Before she could finish, Elizabeth flung open the door. It was a spacious room. And…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Not much for furnishings…’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emptiness almost reminded her of her own palace. Levisia’s eyes settled on the large bed at the end of the room. Elizabeth, already having let go of her hand, was approaching it.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘There’s a… person?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person lied on the bed, appearing almost dead, without a hint of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth looked over to Levisia as if beckoning her over to her as she hesitated to approach. She didn’t ponder too long and made her way there. When she came near the bed, she saw that the person was a man. A beautiful man with a hair of silver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth’s hand held the man’s, shaking.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This man must be…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone Elizabeth holds dear. One person came to her mind.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I didn’t know he’d be in this state.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by his pale face and dry lips, he seemed to be in a critical condition that caused Elizabeth to rush over. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘But why call me…?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, Levisia didn’t see how she could help her or the man. She was neither a physician nor a pharmacist. She was about to tell her this, but Elizabeth spoke quicker than her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just be near him, please.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Just be near him?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a baffling request. What would change if she was near him? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘But I can’t say no…’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth’s voice sounded so desperate Levisia decided to stay by the bedside. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Do I really just stay here? I don’t need to call a physician?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed like this man would need a physician more than her. She began to think Elizabeth had mistaken her for a human medicine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, color began to return on the pale man’s face and his eyelids twitched as if they were going to open at any moment.</span></p>
