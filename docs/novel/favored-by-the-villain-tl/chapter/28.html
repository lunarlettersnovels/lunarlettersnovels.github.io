            <p>Levisia let out a cry as a huge gust of wind swept past her. The intensity was more that she could handle, but she also knew that if she let go, she would be swept out to see. Though she wished for the wind to carry herself away, this was not what she was expecting. This was not a gentle breeze. No, this was a hurricane.</p>
<p>Gripping onto the bannisters of the stairs, which were somehow still embedded into the ground, Levisia managed to keep her eyes open long enough to see what was happening. To her surprise, the wind was carrying the broken chunks of the lighthouse away from her. Above the sounds of the wind was the roaring of the kraken. Levisia watched as the lighthouse landed on the kraken. It writhed around in pain as it was bombarded by rubble and shrapnel. The sea slowly turned red as the kraken sank beneath the sea. Levisia swore she could hear the wind whispering to her as it subsided, and silence soon followed.</p>
<p>“Is-Is it over?” She asked, her knees wobbling. She managed to keep herself upright until her eyes happened upon the space where the lighthouse had been, and it dawned on her how lucky her escape had been. Her knees finally gave out from underneath her, and she hit the stairs.</p>
<p>“Princess!” The old man ran to her and held his hand out for her to take. “We should get back to the docks. Can you walk?”</p>
<p>Levisia nodded and accepted his hand. Her legs were still shaking as she slowly began making her way back to the docks. Though the danger was over, she didn’t want to think about what had just happened. If she did, she would stop in her tracks and not be able to move until she had processed everything. Or if someone carried her. No, she would make her own down, even if she had to blank her mind and put one foot in front of the other until she reached the bottom of the stairs. Only then did she stop and look back at what could have been her demise. A wave of nausea overcame her, and she could hear someone calling out her name as her world went dark.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Jedian watched as Elizabeth and Merril walked towards him, Levisia unconscious in Elizabeth’s arms.</p>
<p>“So, she survived the lighthouse.” He said, folding his arms and nodding to Levisia. “It was foolish of her to go up there, no matter how many people were trapped in the lighthouse.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth gave him a look that held many conflicting emotions: disgust, relief, begrudging respect… She cleared her throat and held her head up high.</p>
<p>“I suppose I have you to thank for the wind that came out of nowhere and swept the lighthouse out to sea. As well as saving Levisia’s life, you also managed to beat the kraken. So, you have my thanks.”</p>
<p>Jedian bit his lower and tugged at the collar of his shirt. On the one hand, receiving praise from the Kraidens was a rare thing, and many people would kill just to receive kind words from them. On the other hand…</p>
<p>“That wasn’t me.” He said with a shrug. “How could it have been? I was with you the entire time, dealing with the kraken down at the docks. It must have been her doing, somehow.”</p>
<p>He pointed to Levisia, who was beginning to stir in Elizabeth’s arms. Merril gestured to Elizabeth to get to the carriage as she stepped forwards.</p>
<p>“You think Levisia did this? Does she have power over the wind now?” Merril asked once Elizabeth was out of earshot. “But I was certain she didn’t have any powers, despite being blessed. But if that is the case, why didn’t she tell us?”</p>
<p>“Maybe she doesn’t know. Maybe they only activate under extreme situations. Ask her when she wakes up.” Jedian spun on his heel away from Merril. “I’m going to check on the town.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t, as the knights were dealing with the citizens, but he wanted to be alone. As he walked away, he looked down at his hands. Was there someone else out there besides him and Lidan who could control the wind? And if Levisia did have these powers, how could she summon such a strong gust when he was barely able to make a simple breeze?</p>
<p>“But what if these are not her powers? What if she somehow managed to command the wind to do her bidding?” He said, squeezing his hands shut. “What if…”</p>
<p>“What are you muttering about?”</p>
<p>Jedian lifted his head up and turned to face Roman, who was leaning against a wall and frowning at him.</p>
