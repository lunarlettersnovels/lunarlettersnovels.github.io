            <p><b>Chapter 22 – Passing Storm</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidan said that Levisia drew him to her the first time they met. That has never happened before. Just then, she remembered the most recent peculiar phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re talking about the incident at the Fairy Tree Forest recently-”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sister, that’s…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rabbit, wait-”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fairy Tree Forest? The forest?” Elizabeth sharply reacted to the word Fairy Forest. “Tell me more about the incident. You two, leave us right now.” Elizabeth managed to kick two people out with her mere glare. Suddenly, Levisia became nervous as a rabbit would be in front of its predator when she was left alone with her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I thought she was a cold person who would not listen to a word out of my mouth.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a change of character. Must be why she is the leading candidate for the throne as the next emperor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, what happened in the forest?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her anxiety climbing, Levisia explained to her what happened that night. The strange phenomenon that occurred the deeper she went into the forest. The mysterious lights. When her short tale ended, Elizabeth was deep in thought. Levisia had hoped that she might know what those lights were but she was wrong, as she expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve never heard of such a thing. Floating lights in the Fairy Forest.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘So even Elizabeth doesn’t know about it?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And the lights circled around you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. I remember it clearly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth stared at Levisia while she sat with her legs crossed. She remained mute for a while, her chin resting on her palm. Then she broke the silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come to the main palace tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pardon?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s something I want to check so come early in the morning.” Her slender finger then pointed at my outfit. “Also, don’t come to my palace wearing those.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What’s wrong with my outfit…?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Levisia looked down at herself and tilted her head. It’s not a bad dress. She doesn’t see what’s the problem. Of course, it couldn’t be compared to the extravagant dress Elizabeth was wearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you come in that outfit, you will be like the invitation you trampled on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…I’m sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You will be trampled on as well.” Elizabeth scanned Levisia with her arms crossed. “You’re not saying you don’t have any decent dress to wear?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re referring to the dress your highness is wearing as decent, then I’m afraid so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ha! I’ve had enough of this. Come with me this instant! I will send some your way with my attendant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, no. There is no need for…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth began to leave the room but then turned around. “What are you doing? You should come and see me off!” She declared, as if to say ‘how dare you not see this noble person off’. Awkwardly, Levisia followed after her and bid her goodbye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I bid you safe travels, your highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph!” Elizabeth glowered at Lidan and Siaphyl who were standing next to Levisia and left the palace. She didn’t forget to huff and puff as she walked through the grassy path.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Why does it seem like a storm just went by…’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia stood dazed when a few attendants soon appeared with several sparkly boxes in their hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Second Princess has sent these to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of these?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s unlike Elizabeth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sister Elizabeth did this…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having witnessed the same scenario, Lidan and Siaphyl seemed uneasy about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a message her highness sends with these. If it pleases you, could I recite it right now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? Yes. Please do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia hoped it was not anything bizarre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve found these on my way so do as you wish after you have worn them! End quote.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon seeing the attendant’s face turning red with embarrassment, she quietly looked away.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Why are we the one who must feel embarrassed?’</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth noticed her strange behavior. After seeing the Fifteenth Princess, she had become peculiarly fond of her. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Impossible.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She tried to keep her guard up, but before she knew it, she was acting foolishly. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What could she be?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be the same reason why Lidan and Siaphyl were drawn to her. If she could, she wanted to interrogate the girl of what she’s done to her. But her heart and body responded honestly unlike her head. The day after meeting the Fifteenth Princess, Elizabeth found herself checking the clock constantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When is she coming?” Just as she angrily exclaimed this, an attendant outside made an announcement. “Your highness, the Fifteenth Princess has arrived.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now? Without realizing, Elizabeth shot up but immediately sat back down to maintain her dignity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She may enter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite her effort to seem calm, her voice had an air of excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth flipped through some paperwork to appear uninterested but her eyes still glanced at the door. It seemed like forever waiting for that door to open. And for some reason, every time she saw a figure through the crack of the door, her heart pounded.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Calm down, Elizabeth Seine Kraiden. This is unlike you.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She repeatedly told herself as if to hypnotize herself but soon caught Levisia’s eyes. Unsurprisingly, she made a foolish comment as soon as she saw Levisia’s face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph! Now you look more acceptable with that outfit!”</span></p>
