            <p><b>Chapter 32 – Hidden Right Under the Enemy’s Nose</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You didn’t ask anymore about my secret, so I won’t ask anymore about yours,” Levisia replied softly. She wanted to leave it at that but Pel was more persistent than she had previously thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think I can do that. You’ve looked in here without my consent and you’re saying you’re about to pretend like you saw nothing without asking right now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not that I wanted to see it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her weak excuse soon shriveled away when Pel came a step closer. He slowly pushed her back into his room and in his usual brisk tone he spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t take your word for it, what will you do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What would you have us do then?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At her question, Pel opened his drawer and pulled out a piece of paper, pushing it towards her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s write a contract.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘That thorough bastard.’ </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long later, Levisia found herself with a pen in her hand, writing a contract that was more like a memorandum.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No one’s secrets shall be disclosed nor inquired any further.]</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His voice then interrupted her as she was about to sign her name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it has been disclosed or inquired…” Pel’s fingers swept his damp hair, and for the first time, a smile was painted on his lips. A very scheming smile. “Whatever the other wishes, one must grant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait, that’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You simply have to not disclose or ask anymore of it. Do you plan to do either?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had her in the palm of his hand! But just as he that would eat the fruit must climb the tree, she quickly added the clause to the contract with no further protest to get away from him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it good now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, he would get things finished without delay; however, he took his sweet time inspecting the contract. His eyes skimmed the paper one more time, then its gaze shifted toward her as she clutched the contract. He then brought his finger to his mouth and dug his teeth on his finger to draw blood. He stamped his blooded finger on the contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she stared at him out of confusion, Pel opened her hand and smeared his blood on her thumb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait, then… Wouldn’t it be your blood then?” When she looked at him with the inquiry, he calmly spoke. “It doesn’t matter. The fingerprint will be Your Highness’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia looked down at the blood on her hand, and having nothing more she could do, she stamped my finger on the contract just like his.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The contract is established, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll keep this with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I’ll just write up another one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you want Sheila to find out about this?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He meant whether she wanted Sheila to discover the contract while cleaning. For lack of anything better, though she wasn’t quite satisfied, Levisia had to agree with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So why did you come all the way here looking for me? Surely that isn’t a secret?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh. I went out to the field and some of the support rods were broken.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Simply because of that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could tell what words he swallowed when she saw where his eyes turned to. A contract was written because his secret was seen merely because of support rods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will probably need five more support rods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will get them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well then… I shall be off.” She continued to pretend not to notice the wig’s glaring existence on the table and walked away. As soon as she left the room and shut the door, her heart began to uncontrollably pound out of her chest. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘No way.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She covered her mouth lest a sound slipped and hurried off. Numerous thoughts erupted in her mind as she went on her way back to my room. One of which was about the novel this world originates from. It described the main lead as one with reddish black hair and golden eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what she could recall, due to the genre of the novel, it was not very descriptive when it came to the characters. For that reason, it was hard to determine Pel’s identity by the few times the description appears in the novel.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘But…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main lead who has become the fallen kingdom’s prince was said to have spent his youth years in this kingdom.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I didn’t know that meant that he spent it in the royal ground, the heart of this kingdom!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And adding to that the fact that he kept himself hidden from Kraiden…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia’s heartbeat pounded along to the beat of her steps. Even if one easily missed what was under their nose, it was utterly ridiculous. To hide and work as a servant in the palace where your enemies are all living? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Or perhaps, to observe the enemies in close quarters…’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How calculating! All this time, she thought the one person she had to be most wary of until she could flee this place was Kraiden, but now Kraiden was not the problem.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The most dangerous person was right next to me!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farid Roycal—the one who is going to leave the royal grounds in ruins!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Damn it.’</span></i></p>
