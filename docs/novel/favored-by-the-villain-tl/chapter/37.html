            <p>Levisia recalled the way they had all danced with swords during the fairy festival, and how they all seemed to cooperate in order to perform an exhilarating dance. Had it all been a façade to make the masses think that they all got along with each other, when deep below the surface they detested each other? Or had they only just recently begun to have their squabbles?</p>
<p>“Could this all be related to the wilting of the fairy tree?” Levisia said aloud to the empty room. “The fairy tree started wilting before I even entered the palace. What does that mean?”</p>
<p>The fairy tree was withering away slowly, the barrier protecting the blessed land was crumbling, and the Imperial family were beginning to suspect that other countries were involved. Taking all that into consideration, it was only a matter of time before the Kraidens grew suspicious of one another.</p>
<p>Levisia sat up in bed and rubbed the back of her neck. What with everything that was going on, and given that Elizabeth said that she was suspicious of everyone who came into contact with the fairy tree, she felt like now was as good a time as any to enact her plan to distance herself from the Kraidens. But that could also badly backfire on her. Right after Elizabeth voices concerns over a mole in the palace, Levisia acting like she wants nothing to do with them would make her even more suspicious. And Pel, as well. They would do some more digging into Pel and find out who he really is. That is, if they didn’t already know.</p>
<p>Levisia thought long and hard about what she should do, even going as far as to open a window to let some fresh air into the room. As she breathed in the salty sea breeze, the solution came to her. She won’t distance herself, but she won’t get any closer to them. Making herself scarce would be a challenge anyway, even without all the suspicions that she may be a mole. Ever since Aurora went abroad, she had been the centre of attention for all the Kraidens. And Elizabeth had insisted that Levisia stay by her side at all times. Sneaking away from the palace in the dead of night seemed like a viable option, but only stirred up more trouble.</p>
<p>“Your Highness?”</p>
<p>Levisia nearly jumped out of her skin at the sound of someone knocking on her door. She slammed the window shut and hurried over to unlock the door. On the other side was Sheila, her hand held aloft as if she was about the knock again.</p>
<p>“Sheila, hello. What can I help you with?” Levisia asked as she smoothed her creased dress down and flicked her hair over her shoulders.</p>
<p>“The Kraidens wanted to know if you were joining them for after dinner drinks.” Sheila said, biting down on her lip. “Are you alright, Your Highness? You ran away from the dining table in a terrible hurry. I wondered if you were sick or injured, and Elizabeth was about to go after you, but Pel insisted that you would be alright.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I worried you.” Levisia said, stepping into the corridor and closing the door behind her. “I ate too much, that’s all. Needs time to let my stomach settle.” She awkwardly laughed as she patted her stomach. “I guess I did eat a little too quickly. But I was so ravenous you can hardly blame me. Right, after dinner drinks, you said? Where are we going?” She set off walking, despite not having any idea where she was going.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, are you sure you’re alright? You don’t seem well at all.” Sheila called out as she ran to catch up. “If you are sick, I can always tell the Kraidens that you have retired early. The sun is setting, after all. Night will soon be upon us.”</p>
<p>“I… I think I might have a bit of a headache.” Levisia said, throwing her hand to her head in an exaggerated manner. Sheila had just handed her a lifeline, a chance to escape the Kraidens, and she was going to take it. She bid Sheila an early goodnight, and returned to her room. After locking the door again, she threw the window open and lay down on her bed. For all the sleeping she had done during the carriage, she was still tired. With a belly full of good food and a soft bed, and the added bonus of no creepy people grabbing her hand, she felt as though she would be able to get a decent night’s sleep. She hoped so, anyway.</p>
