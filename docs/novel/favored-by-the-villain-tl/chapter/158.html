            <p><b>Chapter 12 – As If Entranced</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Third Prince Lidan’s daily routine was simple. It was certain that on Thursdays, one could almost say that he was a playboy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidan, after finishing his morning training, traversed his way to the library for his nap. Indifferent toward the peering eyes, he scanned the towering shelves and picked a book to shield himself from the glaring sun. Then, he laid down by the window, which basically had his initials imprinted, and began to take a doze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the warm sunlight, illuminating the floating dust as it pierced through the glass windows, the crisp sound of pages turning, and murmuring voices, he was about to drift off to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, footfalls, precisely very faint footfalls, slowly woke him up from the looming slumber.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What is it…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half asleep, Lidan followed the sound of the footsteps. The sound stopped momentarily and briskly went another way.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Stairs.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Footsteps climbing the stairs or rather something indescribable completely woke him up. He rose from his seat, roughly tousled his hair, and left the window side as if he was being drawn away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he walked up the stairs, his heart started pounding. As soon as he arrived on the second floor, he noticed a person standing between two bookshelves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dazzling silver hair and green eyes flicking through the book. Lidan already knew who this was.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘But why? Why am I drawn to this person?’ </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he found this strange, he walked towards the person and said, “Sis?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she turned to look at him, he revealed a faint smile.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Sis?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Levisia was more taken aback now than when she was called “sister” by Siaphyl. She began to stumble backwards until her back collided with the bookshelf. “Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With swift hands, Lidan caught the book that almost fell on top of her head. He looked at the book and slyly said, “Someone must’ve half shelved the book.” After returning the book in its proper place, Lidan walked towards her. Despite knowing there was no way to escape, she tried to flee, but to no avail. Because Lidan suddenly bent over and took a sniff of her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What, what was that?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oblivious that she had become frozen in embarrassment, Lidan straightened his back and muttered to himself, “What was that?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Exactly what I wanted to say. What was that?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia gave up trying to escape and addressed him. “The Third Prince, Your highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm. Your Highness? How unaffectionate!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Were we ever affectionate to one another?’ </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shall I address you as the fifteenth empress, Your Highness Levisia?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Lidan utter her name caused chills to run down her back. She wondered how he knew her identity. Just then, he answered as though he read her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re siblings. How can I not know your name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with there being thirty-eight of us, it isn’t a surprise for anyone not to even recognize their siblings; furthermore, those with the name ‘Kraiden’ were even more indifferent to the nameless brothers and sisters. It was what distinguished the legitimate from the illegitimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia became flustered, having no idea that Lidan knew her name. She soon composed herself and asked, “Is there something you need from me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, not really,” he answered calmly.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Then why?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You drew me to you, sis. It was as if you were calling me, was it not?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I would have avoided you, not to mention call you.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes wandered, completely clueless as how to answer him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seems as though you didn’t call me intentionally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She withdrew two steps backward as his face suddenly hovered near hers. Lidan just simply stared at her and then asked, “How did you do it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t really understand what you mean…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm…” When Lidan realized he wasn’t going to get any answer out of her, he crossed his arms and seemingly became lost in thought. “If there’s nothing more to say, then I will… That book is intriguing.” Lidan smiled as he stopped her attempt to leave. He then proceeded to pull out the book [How to Survive in the Desert] which she had returned a few days earlier. “Have you read this one?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. I read it a while ago.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re reading the whole series.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Did he catch on?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked away in vain and as soon as Lidan’s feet were out of her sight, she looked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This would be good to read next.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book he handed her was called [How to Survive in the Sea]. It was indeed interesting, but it was the book he had on his face while he took a nap by the window just a moment ago.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Does he read with his face?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When that thought suddenly sneaked into her mind, Lidan looked at her and smiled, “How about it? Want to read it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? No, not in particular…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why not? It doesn’t seem like you’ve read it yet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hesitated to say it, but the words left her mouth before she even realized. “It’s just that it had someone else’s face on it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?” Lidan burst into laughter when he heard her response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, we’re in a library..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, sorry, sorry. That was quite hilarious.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What part of that was hilarious?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She kept glancing his way, wishing to escape this place. It’s too late to not be seen now, could she just run away? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The aftermath…’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was hard not to think about the aftermath. If someone were to ask her if she would be able to deal with the consequences, her answer would be a solid no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shall we move to a place where we can laugh without worry, sis?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…You mean me as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course.” Lidan smiled with the book on his shoulder. “Whatever you may take me for, I must pursue anything that intrigues me right away.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘And that intriguing thing is… me?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia could even feel her face growing pale, but Lidan simply smiled at her.</span></p>
