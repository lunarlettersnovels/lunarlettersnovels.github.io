        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 3 – Announcement</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Excuse me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it was only expected that they be taken aback. That’s what Levisia anticipated if she told them, with no sign beforehand, that she was planning to leave. She didn’t even know how to respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously I’m not leaving right away. I will leave when I’m ready and have become an adult.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Pel heard this, he seemed to have guessed what she was thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re going to flunk your aptitude test, then give up your right of succession and leave the castle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flunk? Well, a test is a test, so Levisia could just express her goal like that. She looked Pel right in his eyes and lightly accepted his assumption, “Correct.”  The year Levisia becomes an adult is the same year she’ll take the test. At that time, Levisia could prove that she is not worth much and give up becoming a royal member. Only then could she leave the palace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But if you do that, you’ll never be able to use your abilities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…That is also correct.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pel was more quick-witted about the royal family than she presumed. According to him, if she left and tried to reveal her abilities elsewhere, she wouldn’t be able to use them. This was a kind of prohibition to protect the legitimacy of the royal family. If Levisia was to go against this, it would only result in her death and those who learn about her abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well… that would be the case if anyone was actually killed. She wasn’t certain, because no one had ever given up on the royal family yet. But it was possible. Considering their abilities to fight for succession in the future, disappearing from this world should be a piece of cake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I leave here, you two will also take on the burden of all this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheila glanced at Pel who was staring at her. And then, almost simultaneously, their eyes fell on Levisia once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t really care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Highness, the people involved in the royal family’s affairs live under a lot of restrictions. It’s a basic rule not to talk about them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did I do that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two responded as if there were some sort of problem. As a result, only Levisia, who expected a bad response, seemed to be embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But Your Highness…” Sheila carefully tried to discourage her. “Your Highness, if you’re out there alone, it’ll be a world of trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would be so. Sheila didn’t see any difference between her and these candles lit in the room. Levisia nodded her head, accepting this. But she wasn’t finished talking. “That’s what I’m saying, I want you two to leave with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their expressions flipped at her words, it was as if their tongues were cut off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia was well aware that Sheila and Pel had nowhere else to go but the royal palace. Sheila had been with her since she was a baby. So naturally, Levisia came to know her well. And Pel, while he hasn’t told her much about himself, was straightforward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no way to get out during the break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheila assumed Pel was from a small family in the suburbs. Her guess is just as good as Levisia. Anyway, it was certain that all three of their circumstances were just about the same. Circumstances that give them no place to stay and no real family; they have only each other to embrace. So, no matter how much courage she musters up, she can’t leave these two behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously I’m not asking you to attend to me outside the palace. You won’t even have an identity once you leave anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Highness, how can you say that?” Sheila said, as if soothing her. Levisia cracked a small smile, but she couldn’t keep it for long. She fiddled with her hands, trying to carefully choose words to persuade the two. It might sound selfish, but Levisia thought she would be extremely lonely if these two weren’t with her when she left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I left alone, you two…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sure we’ll get a new master.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pel!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, Sheila’s hand couldn’t reach Pel in time. He sprung off his chair and shook his head at them. “No matter how I think about it, I just don’t think this plan makes sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Which part?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The whole thing. Everything.” Pel’s answer was firm as a rock. Levisia knitted her brows as if she were about to frown. “Can you be more specific?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You said you’d hide your abilities. It’s not just anyone else. It’s the emperor. You have to deceive Your Majesty. That can’t be possible, for sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she heard what he said, Levisia wondered where to start fixing this. She had never seen him like this. Was he perhaps overestimating her? If her powers were great enough to hide, she wouldn’t have struggled in the Kraiden castle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First things first, if we’re talking all honest here, I have no abilities to hide. They’re so weak and insignificant that I can’t get anyone to notice them.”</span></p>
