            <p>Wasn’t it cliche, the reason why he hadn’t been able to ask it?</p>
<p>“Because I was afraid.”</p>
<p>He was scared of Levisia’s reply, but more than that, he couldn’t force her to choose. It was the same question that bothered both those who were not chosen and those who could not answer.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to drive you in a corner like that?” ask Farid.</p>
<p>“…I drove you to a corner too.”</p>
<p>Farid’s eyes slowly grew bigger. Looking up at him she mumbled in a faint clear voice,</p>
<p>“The truth is I also hoped that you only wouldn’t ask me that. Because I wouldn’t be able to choose a side even if you had asked.”</p>
<p>“Then why…”</p>
<p>At his half question, she beat on her chest with her balled fist. It was as if she couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>“I’m selfish from beginning to end, but you’re trying to be for me even in this situation.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Even if you point out my indecisiveness, I can’t say anything. I don’t deserve it, because I know it well.”</p>
<p>Levisia was telling him to hurt her, she deserve to be hurt.</p>
<p>But Farid could not do that. Levisia’s thought had been wrong in the first place.</p>
<p>“I only wanted you”</p>
<p>Farid volunteered himself. If Levisia had looked into his head, he would never have said that. It was something he could say since he didn’t know what in his head was messed up.</p>
<p>She was as clean as her shiny white hair; pureness he could never match.</p>
<p>Farid approached Levisia who stood a little more than three steps away and said,</p>
<p>“Did you say that to me even after being treated like that earlier?</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“I’m really only for your highness”?”</p>
<p>Trembling, Levisia’s body winced. But she didn’t avoid him as he closed in on her.</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>This time, Farid flinched.</p>
<p>It was a frustratingly innocent conviction. By the way, he was jumping with joy at her calmly-displayed trust, wearing a mask of guilt.</p>
<p>“This is dangerous.”</p>
<p>He felt nauseous. Frowning, he hurriedly changed the topic.</p>
<p>“As for me, there is something I’ve been thinking is strange.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, he had said this with quite a persuasive voice. While he was breathing, Levisia replied after rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>“…what is it?”</p>
<p>“Why were you so convinced that I would leave?”</p>
<p>Levisia’s eyes grew wide.</p>
<p>He had said it not just to escape the crisis, but Farid really had been wondering this all the time.</p>
<p>She looked like she knew what he was planning. It was a sense of disharmony that he had felt since she had figured out his true identity.</p>
<p>“That conviction of yours, where on earth did it spring from?”</p>
<p>Levisia gulped as she shifted her eyes.</p>
<p>“You… are the Prince of Roycal.”</p>
<p>“I was. By the way, isn’t that old news? It’s been such a long time since Roycal became a ruin, so there’s no way I’ll have a place to go back to…”</p>
<p>“I never thought about how long you were going to stay by my side. When I think about your identity, the imperial palace is too dangerous of a place for you.”</p>
<p>Levisia answered smoothly as if she had come prepared. There wasn’t much space between her sentences.</p>
<p>Still, though, it was weird. Farid mumbled low as he tilted his head.</p>
<p>“This is a place where I’ve lived for many years.”</p>
<p>“…since your identity was revealed to me, I naturally thought you would leave.”</p>
<p>“So that’s why you wrote the contract.”</p>
<p>It was not sloppy, but it was vague enough to accept easily. Or maybe he was hanging on his senses, holding onto a false accusation.</p>
<p>“Can you really feel relieved about that?” asked Levisia, standing a mere one step away from him. The look on her face was as if she was certain that she hoped to end this topic with these final words.</p>
<p>She seemed to have thought about this scenario up to here. Well, the next thing was something she would have never thought of.</p>
<p>Farid, not thinking much of it, lifted his hand and slid it over her cheek. Her smooth skin under the back of his hand had slight tremors.</p>
<p>She was nervous. She’d been that way right before her lips had been stolen by him.</p>
<p>Well, even though she was nervous like that, Levisia only flinched, never trying to avoid his touch. Perhaps she thought he’d get upset if she dodged him.</p>
<p>Farid’s gaze fell on her pink lips. The swelling was noticeably lower than before.</p>
<p>He gently smoothed the corners of her stiff mouth and gave a slow answer as he swept her trembling lips with his fingertip.</p>
<p>“I sure can.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Levisia seemed to not even notice that she hadn’t replied to him because all the nerves were focused on Farid’s hand touching her lips.</p>
<p>Wasn’t this such a lovely innocence? How could she leave her lips to him without even thinking of running away?</p>
<p>With a light laugh, Farid cupped one of her cheeks in his hand and gave her a peck on the lips.</p>
<p>“..…!”</p>
<p>While Levisia remained frozen at his lips that had touched lightly like a surprise attack, he whispered as if letting out a sigh.</p>
<p>“Don’t I love you?”</p>
