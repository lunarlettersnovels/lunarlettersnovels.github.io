            <p><strong>Chapter 101 – All Leads to One</strong></p>
<p>“How have you recovered, Reign? You looked awful the last time I saw you.” Elizabeth sat at the edge of her couch and leant in closer. “What happened?”</p>
<p>Reign looked down at his hands, which were grasping his trousers with such force that his knuckles were turning white.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you, but you can’t get mad after hearing this, Elizabeth.” He said, lifting his head to meet Elizabeth’s gaze. “I received help from Levisia White.”</p>
<p>“What?!” Elizabeth leapt to her feet; her hands clenched in fists at her side. How could it be possible for Levisia to have healed him when she and Reign had never met? “That’s impossible! How did that happen?!”</p>
<p>Reign pressed up against the back of his chair, hands clenching the armrests.</p>
<p>“You brought her here that one time. Remember?” He shrunk further into the armchair. “Anyway, I got help from her. And now, my condition has improved significantly.”</p>
<p>“When did I do that?! It wasn’t me who did that!” Elizabeth folded her arms. “If this is your idea of a joke, then it failed. And anyway, that’s not why I came here.”</p>
<p>“So, why did you come today?” Reign slouched in his seat, his fingers drumming in on the armrest. “And here I was assuming that you were checking in on me out of the kindness of your heart.”</p>
<p>“It’s… complicated.” Elizabeth flopped back down onto her couch, and pinched the bridge of her nose. “The Emperor has sent us all down the southern regions to investigate the curious phenomena that is happening. The withered fairy trees, the ground turning black… I think it might be linked to one person in particular, but I can’t say for certain.”</p>
<p>“So, you think this is all connected to Levisia, do you? If that’s the case, maybe she can solve the problems that have emerged in the Empire.” Reign said, smirking at Elizabeth. “Then how about bringing her along during this inspection? If you do, you’ll know a little bit more.”</p>
<p>“No, I couldn’t do that. I… Wait a minute.” Elizabeth sat up straight and glared at Reign, heat rising to her cheeks. “I never once mentioned that I thought it was linked to Levisia. I said ‘one person in particular’. How did you bring her into this?”</p>
<p>“Ah, so you do think that it’s her. Seems my hunch was right.” Reign pretended to check out his nails, which irritated Elizabeth greatly. She got to her feet again and marched over to Reign, looming over him with a stare that could kill a man.</p>
<p>“I am not bringing Levisia into this. Both the situation with the fairy trees and the strange occurrences in the south are confidential. If word gets out about these, they can throw the empire into chaos.” Elizabeth clamped her hands over the armrests and dug her nails into the leather. “How am I meant to tell her about all this?</p>
<p>“Actually, Elizabeth. I already told her.” Reign let out a sheepish smile as he shrugged his shoulder. “She was around and I just happened to let it slip. My bad.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you!” Elizabeth resisted the urge to slap Reign across his stupid, unbearably smug face. He knew that Levisia was a taboo subject for her, and there he was, flaunting the fact that he was apparently talking to her regularly. And spilling important Empire secrets to her, as well. “And how did you hear about it? I only heard about it myself not long ago. It seemed like myself and my siblings were the only ones who knew about it.</p>
<p>Reign only shrugged again, which served to annoy Elizabeth even more. She planted her hands on top of Reign’s, ready to dig them into his flesh if needed.</p>
<p>“I just happened to overhear a conversation about it. That’s all.” Reign wiggled his hands free from Elizabeth’s vice-like grip, nail marks scratching his skin. “And it felt like the sort of thing Levisia should know about. Seeing as she has been brought back here and is now surrounded by Kraidens. She needed to be warned, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“You… I don’t know where you got your information from. Whether you overheard it or got it from an informant, or whatever! The fact remains that you told Levisia about it, and now she’ll be worrying about it. Not to mention her inability to keep her mouth shut.” Elizabeth turned away from Reign, her head in her hands. She visited him to clear her head from her troubled thoughts, and now her thoughts were even more scrambled up.</p>
<p>Levisia and Reign? How and when had they met up? When did Reign tell Leivisia about what was happening to the south? What else had he revealed to her?</p>
<p>She needed to pay a visit to Levisia.</p>
