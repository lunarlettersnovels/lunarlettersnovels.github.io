            <p>What Farid pulled out was his heart chopped to pieces by his own hands. The emotions poured out as if he was on the brink of his death.</p>
<p>“That’s why my identity―”</p>
<p>He squeezed Levisia’s hand after she had flinched and backed up, placing it on his chest. The place where only the slow sense of falling stayed because of his plummeted heart.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have blamed you until my last breath.”</p>
<p>Like a lie, the warmth that touched fell like trampled embers and could not seep through him at all.</p>
<p>“Now, I will leave you to go prepare to rebuild Roycal. Half of my plan is already complete, and when the other half is complete, I plan on destroying Kraiden straight away.”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>“And if they find out that you hid my identity, you will not be able to escape death.”</p>
<p>His hand wrapping Levisia’s cheek was trembling hideously. Farid, after narrowing his eyebrows, squeezed her hand tightly.</p>
<p>Thankfully, she was so shocked at his words she seemed to not realize.</p>
<p>“So, tell me you’re leaving.”</p>
<p>Levisia’s face became distorted little by little. Despite the look in her eyes that said, “don’t say anymore”, Farid moved his lips.</p>
<p>“A servant who doesn’t even know grace insulted you and ran away. You’ve always been suspicious, so it’s better to find out what I’ve done.”</p>
<p>“Stop it.”</p>
<p>“That way you will be safe.”</p>
<p>“Then you―”</p>
<p>“You’re extremely generous to me, who just said that I’m going to destroy your country.”</p>
<p>Levisia was left speechless. Farid, who let go of her hand as he took his other hand off her face, said in an unprecedented cold voice,</p>
<p>“If Kraiden collapses, you will be no different from me… no, you will be in a much worse situation than me.”</p>
<p>Levisia, chewing on her lips, soon turned her head.</p>
<p>Farid stepped away as he watched her. He stopped walking only after he became further away than he had approached earlier.</p>
<p>“Then please run away to a place where I can’t even reach you, as far as you possibly can.”</p>
<p>Finally, the heart that had been falling with no end in sight struck on the ground. It rolled around, damaged and smooshed beyond recognition.</p>
<p>“Because it would be better to not see each other forever.”</p>
<p>It was a perfect abandonment only when it was infinitely devastating.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The inspection team left Vinhol. People cheered and sprinkled flowers and colored paper on the wagons passing in a row.</p>
<p>The people of Vinhol praised the Kraiden royal family for their work at the port and sent them infinite trust. Marquis Vinhol said he would quickly resolve the situation and report it to the royal family, and they promised they would not spare any support in restoring it.</p>
<p>According to Merril’s confirmation by taking out the boundary stones from the sea, she had said that there was barely any damage to them, that thankfully, the damage was not severe, so she could restore them soon.</p>
<p>And in the series of processes, she was so exhausted that she suffered for a full week. Even while she was groaning in the wagon on its way, the inspection team was steadily moving on their schedule.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’m saying that we are perfectly fine.”</p>
<p>“Brother, I miss when you were lying down.”</p>
<p>“What is this? Who in the world is calling me brother?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve never had a weak sister… I guess I was mistaken for a second.”</p>
<p>“Let’s see who’s the weak one here.”</p>
<p>Merril and Lidan’s continuous bickering becomes distant as they walk away.</p>
<p>Levisia looked out the window of the rattling carriage. The carriage left the smooth street and shortly entered a forest path. Having left Vinhol, they were already on their way to their fifth destination, the South.</p>
<p><em>Have we already gone to four cities?</em></p>
<p>Levisia asked, calculating in her head.</p>
<p>She looked up at the sky slowly crawling above. It was a bright day with not a cloud in sight.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, Farid left, she thought. It had already been more than ten days. Leaving her cold words while she had been asleep.</p>
<p>To her amusement, the last thing he had said to her was so typical of ‘Pel.’</p>
<p><em>“Sheila will wake up tomorrow morning. I can’t see her before I leave, it’s hard to guarantee, but she’ll probably become healthier than before and help you, so you don’t have to worry.”</em></p>
