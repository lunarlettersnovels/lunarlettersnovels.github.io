            <p><b>Chapter 25 – Becoming Prey </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lidan Serger, leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a way to greet someone, sis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you not hear me? I don’t want to see your face for another second.” When Elizabeth spoke angrily, Lidan waved her off. “I didn’t really come here to see the Second Princess either.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Didn’t he just tell me he might as well see her since he came by?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On the way here, I saw some ass holding back our Rabbit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was definitely talking about Vager. He had called him his brother just a moment ago;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">now, he was calling Vager an arse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you bringing that up…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What did you just say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, Elizabeth unexpectedly had a murderous response. A spark of light erupted in the air. When Levisia turned toward Elizabeth, she realized she had released her power; it was electricity that sparked. Elizabeth’s wavy golden hair swayed in the air as though the wind blew in the room. Lidan momentarily shrunk at the scene but soon laughed as it was funny.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What is so funny about her looks?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia just wanted to get out of this palace. She felt like she needed to leave the room before something broke. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What if I get electrocuted standing next to Lidan?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrified at the chance, she slowly moved away from Lidan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidan once again spoke up, not realizing the mood. “Your highness must be intrigued by Rabbit seeing as you have been keeping her around the past few days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intrigued? Levisia must’ve felt the same way as well. There was no way someone who is as calculating as Elizabeth would keep her around them with no reason.  The problem was, it seems like neither Levisia nor her seem to know why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take care of your surroundings. I wouldn’t have exposed Rabbit like that for some trash to hang around her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Lidan’s provocation, Elizabeth’s power grew even menacingly. Her hair began to shine like Pikachu who was just about to let out a million bolts.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I must escape!’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia withdrew, attempting to escape from the sight of Elizabeth and Lidan. Her back barely touched the door when she was caught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop right there, Levisia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where are you going, Rabbit?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They both turned to look at her at the same time. It was a moment of sheer horror more than that of a midsummer night’s horror movie.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Poor Rabbit. How did you end up gaining favor in Elizabeth’s eyes?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidan looked at Levisia with pity.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘You shouldn’t be the one making that face at me!’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when Levisia raised her eyebrows in defiance, Elizabeth shot up kicking her chair away. Crash! With the sound, Lidan winked at Levisia at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, my work is done here, so…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Wait, you’re just going to leave after stirring up the atmosphere like this?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before realizing, Levisia grabbed Lidan’s arm that was holding the handle. She gave him a look of, ‘take me with you,’ but he only whispered petty words to her. “I didn’t realize it would be so hard to see your face the past few days, Rabbit.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘That’s certainly not my fault!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you leave like this, it will be harder to see me again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I shall come find you until I see you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a hopeless person!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well then. Cheers, sis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After driving Elizabeth up the wall, Lidan left cold-heartedly and Levisia was left alone with her who was about to explode. Levisia couldn’t help but feel like a prey thrown into the predator’s den. A very hungry predator at that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she held her breath, Levisia heard Elizabeth’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That ass.” She let go of the pen she was holding. It had already burned up and became a pile of ash that soon blew away in the gentle wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where is he?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her voice sounded murderous still.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, Levisia went to the main palace where Elizabeth was as if she was clocking in for work. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘How long do I have to keep this going…?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day began with opening the box sent by Elizabeth, watering the crops, and busily getting ready.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she would have to go into the main palace with all the unwanted attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She walked towards the palace begrudgingly, and when she arrived at the entrance, her eyes widened. Unlike other days, the courtyard was empty. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Is the main palace taking a break today?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth would’ve let her know if that was the case. Levisia passed the empty path and walked up the stairs. Then she saw the palace guards at their posts as usual. ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they must not be on a break then.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She showed them her pass to the palace and they nodded their heads in approval. “Pardon me, did something happen today?” She asked, pointing behind her. The guards looked at each other and shook their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t know either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has never happened before while we were on duty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this was an unusual incident. Levisia glanced back and bowed to them. It was only when she arrived at Elizabeth’s office when she found out who wiped the palace courtyard clean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Levisia entered through the door held open by the attendant, Elizabeth wasn’t tending to her work as she normally would but was looking out the window as if to wait for someone and turned to look at Levisia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Was your way here peaceful?”</span></p>
