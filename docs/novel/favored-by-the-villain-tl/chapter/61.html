            <h3><strong>Chapter 109 – Sister Feud (II)</strong></h3>
<p>“Yeah, Elizabeth.” Merril slammed the book and thrust it back at Levisia. “You really should take a break. Listen to what the princess has to say, sister dearest.”</p>
<p>Levisia realised too late what she had done. By trying to get Elizabeth’s attention, she had created an opening for Merril to swoop in and provoke Elizabeth. And Elizabeth’s icy cold glare when she lowered her documents reflected on that.</p>
<p>Levisia sat still and opened her book to a random page. She waited to see what would happen, now that the tension in the carriage was at its peak. She had been the one to lay down the fuse, and she deeply regretted it. With any luck, neither Elizabeth or Merril would be the one to strike the match.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of her eyes, she saw Elizabeth and Merril stare at each other for an uncomfortably long time. Eventually, Elizabeth returned to her papers and Merril scooted back over to read the book over Levisia’s shoulder.</p>
<p>The situation was still less than ideal, but it was better than nothing.</p>
<p>About half an hour later, during which Levisia had managed to get no reading done, the carriage began to slow down. Confused, she lowered her book and pulled back the curtains. The sun was in the sky, but it still appeared to be too early for lunch.</p>
<p>“Why are we stopping? Surely it is not lunchtime already?” She asked Elizabeth and Merril. Both women shrugged, and stretched their arms out.</p>
<p>“Likely so we can take a break. We’ve been sitting in this carriage since early morning, after all. Time really flies when you are having fun.” Merril winked at Elizabeth, who muttered several curse words under her breath. She opened the carriage door and hopped out, skipping off to the left. Elizabeth reached over and yanked Levisia down by the collar of her dress.</p>
<p>“Don’t say anything to her, understand. She is looking for any opportunity to provoke us.” She spat, her face so close to Levisia’s that their noses were nearly touching. “Do not give in to her, understand? Ignore her. It’s worked out for me.”</p>
<p>She let go and climbed out the carriage, going the opposite way of Merril. Levisia closed her eyes and exhaled through her nose in frustration. There was no way she could have known that Merril would be trying to get under Elizabeth’s skin, and would throw Levisia’s words back at her. She slammed the book down and hopped out the carriage, not bothering to conceal her identity anymore.</p>
<p>Everyone knew she was there. It was an open secret at this point.</p>
<p>Just beyond the carriages, another temporary camp was being set up. She could smell the rich aroma of the stew she ate yesterday, the one with the venison and the vegetables, but her appetite had all but vanished.</p>
<p>Wanting to be as far away from Elizabeth and Merril as possible, she set off in the direction of Pel’s carriage. All she wanted was to hide with people she could trust, even if it was for a few short minutes whilst lunch was being served.</p>
<p>To her dismay, there was no sign of Pel. Or Sheila, for that matter. Her anger levels rising, she spun on her heels and marched into the forest. She stamped across the ground, spraying mud all over the hem of her dress. There had been a heavy rainstorm the previous night, and the ground was still saturated with water. Levisia would wash her dress later, as she had more important things to worry about.</p>
<p>Like repeatedly kicking a tree over and over, letting out a frustrated scream with every kick. She let out one final yell and buried her head in her hands.</p>
<p>“My, my. Seems like someone is having some issues.”</p>
<p>Levisia’s head shot up at the unknown voice. She frantically looked around, trying to find the source. A few feet away from her, leaning against a tree, was a man. His black hair, which had been tied back in a ponytail, was lightly swaying in the breeze. Levisia tried to not wince at the dark red eyes that seemed to be staring directly into her soul.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” She said, trying to sound authoritative. Her voice merely came out as a squeak, to which the unknown man laughed. His voice was deep, yet hypnotic, as he sank to the crow that was perched on his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Who I am is not important.” He said, his smile stretching from ear to ear. “It’s who you are that’s important.”</p>
<p>With a single whistle, the crow spread its wings. Levisia began to back away, running away just as a single whistle echoed throughout the air.</p>
<p>She glanced back behind her to see that the crow was rapidly gaining on her.</p>
