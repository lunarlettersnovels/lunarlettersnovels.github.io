            <p>Aurora’s location was in the garden of the castle. While walking under the guidance of Aurora’s maid, Levisia was busy organizing her hair and dress and cooling off her heated face.</p>
<p>When Aurora’s maid looked at her face and handed her a handkerchief, she wanted to crawl inside a rat hole.</p>
<p>On it, she could see some unknown fluid and smeared lip marks.</p>
<p><em>Where on earth did this thing come from?</em></p>
<p>She headed to the garden feeling on her pouted lips. Not too long later, a woman looking at flowers appeared.</p>
<p>She, who blinked her blue eyes with soft-looking brown hair hanging down, was none other than Aurora, the 7th Princess.</p>
<p>When Levisia thought she was close enough, Aurora said, not even turning to look at her,</p>
<p>“The flowers have blossomed beautifully, right?”</p>
<p>Upon looking at Aurora, she had no time to appreciate the surrounding scenery. Levisia replied after belatedly looking around the garden.</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>
<p>Did her voice sound sulky? Aurora plucked a flower and handed it to her as if trying to give her a closer look.</p>
<p>Levisia stared at her face then lowered her gaze. And a bit of embarrassment kicked in.</p>
<p>The flowers she thought she had beautifully decorated the garden with had wilted.</p>
<p>“You can’t know if you don’t see it up close,”</p>
<p>said Aurora, turning around as if she didn’t care whether Levisia looked at it or not.</p>
<p>“It was a great choice to go south for the inspection this time.”</p>
<p>The topic had suddenly gone from flowers to the inspection.</p>
<p>Aurora ran her hand through a bush as she slowly walked. Several leaves and petals fell from every place her hand touched. For a light touch, there sure were lots of things falling.</p>
<p>“How can this be bad soil? I can’t even tell all that is going on.”</p>
<p>Her voice sounded as if she was upset. When Levisia was guessing something from the words ‘bad soil’, Aurora looked back at her.</p>
<p>“But there’s always a suitable reason for everything.”</p>
<p>Aurora blinked her eyes which resembled the sky.</p>
<p>“So, I think that you being here is a similar reason, Your Royal Highness.”</p>
<p>That was her first time hearing a title of respect from a Kraiden. Aurora greeted the surprised Levisia gracefully, lifting her skirt.</p>
<p>“7th Princess Aurora Vale Kraiden. Pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>Had Levisia ever received such a friendly greeting from a Kraiden at the first meeting?</p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p>It was almost like when she had first met Siaphyl. Of course, it was a suspicious kindness.</p>
<p>Levisia stared blankly at Aurora raising her head and soon came to her senses before briefly greeting her.</p>
<p>“I am 15th Princess Levisia White.”</p>
<p>Aurora smiled after hearing the introduction.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your time today. I have been wanting to meet you.”</p>
<p>If a different Kraiden had said that, she could think they were up to something strange, but Aurora was different.</p>
<p>Even her graceful smile looked kind.</p>
<p><em>Is the first impression important?</em></p>
<p>Aurora’s first impression, who had returned from another place far away, remained in Levisia’s head as the most normal of all the Kraidens.</p>
