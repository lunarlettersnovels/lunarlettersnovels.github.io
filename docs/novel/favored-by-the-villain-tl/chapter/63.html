            <p><strong>Chapter 107 – The Filendells (II)</strong></p>
<p>“You go rest too. I will take care of these.” She reached out to take her luggage from Pel’s hand, but he held it out of her reach.</p>
<p>What she had told Sheila a moment ago was just an excuse to get her to leave.</p>
<p>“No need, Levisia. I’ve got these. Now, let’s find you a room next to Elizabeth, shall we? Before Her Highness has a meltdown.” Levisia scowled at his back as approached one of the bedrooms.</p>
<p>“I am perfectly capable of carrying my own bags, Pel.” She snapped, marching alongside him. “Besides, how are you going to open the door if both of your hands are full?”</p>
<p>She was not expecting Pel to tuck her luggage, arguably the heavier of the two bags, under his shoulder like it was little more than a book.</p>
<p>“There is more than one way to hold things, Levisia.” He smirked as he opened the door and carried her bags in.</p>
<p>“You could have also just put the bags on the floor. Or given one to me, like I requested.” Levisia said, trying to hide her amazement at his strength.</p>
<p>“Maybe so.” Pel dropped their luggage onto the floor. He leant against the wall, a slight smirk across his face. “But where is the fun in that? Why do things the conventional way when I can do things unconventionally?”</p>
<p>Levisia rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, thank you for carrying my bag, Pel. You are free to leave and go to your own bedroom.” She said, walking over to fetch her luggage and heave it onto the bed. As she was rummaging through it to find her nightclothes, she noticed that the door was still open. Frowning, she looked around and saw that Pel was down on one knee.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Pel?” She could feel the heat rising to her face. It almost looked like he was about to propose to her.</p>
<p>“Showing my respects to Her Highness.” Pel said as he bowed down low. “It is only fitting for someone like me.”</p>
<p>“What, no! I mean, I didn’t mean it like that. I…” Panicking, she dropped to her knees so that they were level. “You’re of royal blood too, remember? The Imperial Prince, your father being an Emperor… Don’t lower yourself in front of me, Pel. That is not what I meant.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know anything about me. No matter my past, now I am just a servant of yours.” Pel lifted his head up, his eyes glistening. “And why are you making that face at me?”</p>
<p>“What face…?” Levisia frowned.</p>
<p>“Like you’ve been hurt at what I said.” Pel raised an eyebrow. Levisia sighed and looked away.</p>
<p>“I just hope that you take care of yourself.” She said, still refusing to meet Pel’s gaze. “As well as your knees. It can’t be good for you to kneel for long periods of time.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say there weren’t any exceptions. I am taking care of myself more than you think, and my kneeling here in front of you is an exception. Because I am down on my knee only for you.”</p>
<p>Levisia felt Pel’s hand lightly cup her chin. He gently turned her head to face him, and she did not fight him. With a soft smile, he traced his thumb over her cheek, and then got to his feet. Without warning, he bent down and scooped her up into his arms.</p>
<p>“Pel?! What are you doing! Put me down!” Levisia said, too stunned to move. “That wasn’t an invitation for you to just pick me up without telling me first!”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you sitting down because you were tired of standing?” Pel chuckled under his breath.</p>
<p>“No! It was so that we were on the same level! To show that… Just put me down, Pel, for god’s sake!” Levisia tried to wiggle free from his arms, but he held onto her tightly. She could only sulk in his arms as he carried her across the bedroom and lowered her down onto a chair.</p>
<p>“All of that just to take me here?” She said, raising an eyebrow at him. He had been acting strangely, and she couldn’t figure out why.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Well then, is there somewhere else you’d like to go?” Pel said, bowing down to her again. “I remain your humble servant, after all.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant.” Levisia reached behind her for the cushion she was leaning against, and childishly threw it at Pel. Ever since their little talk, and she got him to stop avoiding her, his comebacks have been coming through thick and fast. He always had something to say in response, and Levisia was finding it increasingly difficult to talk to him without having her words thrown back in her face.</p>
