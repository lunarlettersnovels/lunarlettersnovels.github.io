            <p>Jedian glanced at Levisia the whole time they walked. There was something bubbling beneath the surface, something that Jedian knew that Levisia had also picked up on. The way she kept glancing over at him suggested that she wanted to say something, or maybe she was waiting for him to talk. They walked a little longer in the awkward silence until Levisia came to a halt and turned on her heels to face Jedian.</p>
<p>“If you have something to say, please say it,” Levisia said, rubbing her arm. “Look, if this is about what happened back at the dining hall…”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that.” Jedian blurted out. Levisia blinked at him several times and tilted her head off to the side. Jedian bit his lip and sighed. “Actually, there is something. The Kraidens… They do seem a little possessive over you. Always trying to get close to you and such.”</p>
<p>Levisia’s face scrunched up, almost as if she had tasted something sour. Jedian immediately regretted asking.</p>
<p>“I wish I knew. Why don’t you ask them yourself?” She said with a shrug. “I’m sure they’ll be able to tell you, and then you can report back to me with your findings.”</p>
<p>“Report back? I… Oh…” Jedian quickly realized what Levisia meant.</p>
<p>Levisia herself had no idea why they were obsessed over her and was using him to find out why.</p>
<p>“Oh, no. I couldn’t possibly talk to the Kraidens. How would I even go about…” His words died in his throat as he remembered what Roman had told him. The venomous glee in his voice as he laid down his plans to expose Levisia to the Kraidens bounced around his mind.</p>
<p>“Jedian, are you alright?”</p>
<p>At the sound of his name, he came back to his senses. Levisia was frowning at him, though worry was plastered across her face. He knew he had to tell someone about what Roman was going to do, but who could he tell? Which one of the Kraidens would not immediately kill him?</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and pictured the Kraidens, wondering which one he would picture first. Merril sprung into his mind. Shaking his head, he repeated the process. Yet again, Merril appeared into his thoughts.</p>
<p>Yes, Merril was his best bet. She would solve the problem swiftly. Elizabeth would fry him where he stood for daring to have a bad thought about her precious Levisia, Lidan would likely laugh at his face and not believe him, Cassian would not care at all, and who knows how Siaphyl would react? Merril was rational enough to listen and powerful enough to make everything right.</p>
<p>“I am quite alright, Levisia. I will get going now. Goodnight.” Jedian said with a bow and turned to walk away. There was a spring in his step, his mood brighter now that he had found a solution to his problems. He would ask Merril about why the Kraidens were so possessive over Levisia, as well as warn her about Roman.</p>
<p>He barely walked three steps before he bumped into someone else who was out for a late-night walk. Fearing he had encountered a Kraiden, and that they had overheard his conversation with Levisia, he began to rapidly apologise.</p>
<p>“Stop apologizing. What are you doing here so late at night?”</p>
<p>Jedian looked up to see Pel staring down at him. He scoffed and brushed past him without waiting for a response.</p>
<p>“Pel! Isn’t it dangerous for us to be seen together like this?”</p>
<p>The way Levisia spoke to Pel seemed that they had more familiarity than that of a servant and their master. Jedian hurried away from them and around a corner, peering out to eavesdrop on their conversation.</p>
<p>“Levisia. How many times have I said that it is chilly at night?” Pel said, taking off his jacket and draping it around Levisia’s shoulders. “It is colder here than back at the palace.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t have time to go to my room and get a jacket.” Levisia pulled the jacket tighter around her. “And why would the southern regions be colder than home? Surely it should be warmer.”</p>
<p>“Regardless of what the weather should be like, what on Earth are you doing running around in that dress?” Pel nodded to the thin and floaty dress Levisia was wearing.</p>
<p>“I told you, I didn’t have time to go back to my room. I couldn’t grab a jacket, let alone change out of my dress into something warm.” Levisia reached out to touch Pel’s hand. “Besides, it sounds like you want to see more.”</p>
<p>“Don’t test me.” Pel tucked a strand of hair behind Levisia’s hair. Jedian clapped his hands over his mouth and ducked back behind the corner. He knew that there was something more going on that they were letting on.</p>
