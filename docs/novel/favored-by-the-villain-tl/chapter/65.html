            <p><strong>Chapter 105 – Curious As Well</strong></p>
<p>“Good to see you’re alright, and that you are surviving Elizabeth.” Pel said, leaning against the carriage. “Sheila is coping, I suppose. It’s quite the strange journey we’re going on.”</p>
<p>“I was thinking the same thing. I mean, about you being okay. And the journey, I guess.” Levisia smiled at him, and then gasped at the sight of Lidan. She grabbed Pel by his shirt and pulled him into the carriage. Ignoring Pel’s complaints, she slammed the door shut, much like Elizabeth had done.</p>
<p>She guessed that Lidan had also been called away, much like Elizabeth. Given how Elizabeth had gone to such lengths to keep her hidden, she figured that she may as well do that same.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Why are you trying to hide me?” Pel hissed. Levisia clamped her hands over his mouth, waiting until Lidan’s footsteps had faded away. She peeled her hands away from Pel and sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s Lidan. And I am not hiding you.</p>
<p>“Aside from Princess Elizabeth and the emperor, no one knows I’m part of this inspection team. Since nothing good will come out of him knowing, I stayed in here. And since  everyone knows you’re my servant…” Levisia peered through the curtains. “I don’t know why Elizabeth is so keen on hiding everyone, but that seems to be the case.”</p>
<p>“Ah, about that.” Pel rubbed the back of his neck. “It seems like everyone already knows you’re here. I know you tried to hide me in order to hide yourself, but I’m afraid it is already too late.”</p>
<p>Levisia cursed, and hid her head in her hands. All the work she and Elizabeth had done in order to conceal her identity had been for nothing. And she had yanked Pel into the carriage for nothing.</p>
<p>Was she ever going to be in charge of her own life? Since she had returned to the Kraidens, she felt as though she was not in control. Gone were the days when she could make her own decisions. Now she was merely a puppet for everyone else, going along wherever her strings were pulled.</p>
<p>She yanked the curtains back and pulled the window down in order to get some fresh air into the claustrophobic carriage, not bothering to hide herself now that everyone knew she was there. Spotting Helga in the distance, she thought back to when Pel had cornered her outside the tent.</p>
<p>“So, how do you know Helga?” She asked, resting her elbow on the door and leaning against her fist. “Seems like you were having a deep conversation with her.”</p>
<p>“Who?” Pel tilted his head, confusion etched on his face.</p>
<p>“Elizabeth’s maid. I saw the two of you talking.” Levisia realised that her tone of voice made it seem like she was jealous, and she quickly held up her hands in a silent surrender. “Not that I don’t want you to talk to her. I’ve just never seen the two of you interact before.”</p>
<p>Pel scoffed, and shook his head.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit of an inconvenience having her here, if you ask me. But, seeing as she is here, I thought I would make use of her.” He glanced out the window. “Seeing as she is close to Elizabeth, and Elizabeth is close to you.”</p>
<p>“Why would you, who avoids people whenever you can, go out of your way to talk to the maid of the one of the most important people of the Kraiden Imperial family?” Levisia couldn’t believe what Pel was saying. “You are unbelievable sometimes. Are you trying to get close to her?”</p>
<p>Pel laughed, though it was humourless.</p>
<p>“I am not close to her, and I am not intending to. She is just a means to an end. Besides,” Pel folded his arms and drummed his fingers, “it always feels like she is planning something. I said to never trust the Kraidens, and that extends to their servants.”</p>
<p>“Planning something?” Levisia leant forwards, now eager to hear what Pel had to say. “What do you think she’s planning? And the Kraidens… They all seem to be gathered around for a private meeting. Do you know what’s going on? Did Helga let anything slip?”</p>
<p>Pel shook his head and shrugged.</p>
<p>“She’s as tight lipped as her mistress, I’m afraid. She didn’t let anything slip. However, she did ask me quite a few questions. Questions about you.”</p>
<p>Levisia slid back in her chair with a heavy sigh. If Helga was pestering Pel about her, then the order must have come from Elizabeth. Why would Elizabeth want to do such a thing in the first place? She already knew all there was to know about Levisia in the first place.</p>
<p>“What did you tell her, then?” She said, after an uncomfortable silence had drawn out long enough.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Because I’m curious about you, as well.”</p>
