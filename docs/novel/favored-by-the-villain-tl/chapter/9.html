            <p><em>“But Your Highness, there doesn’t seem to be a reason to get closer to Princess Levisia more than you need to.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Can you really be sure of that? Was it only for convenience?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I dare to say this, but you shouldn’t get close to Princess Levisia, Your Highness.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, Hectile’s warning seemed correct. Somehow he may have predicted this future; a future that even he had vaguely assumed.</p>
<p>Farid, who was still reflecting on the contents of the letter, opened the window when he saw a bird chirping.</p>
<p>Then, it flew out of the window as if it’d been waiting. With only a slight wiggle of the feathers, its form bolting off in the distance looked so natural.</p>
<p>He set his arms on the windowsill as his eyes followed the bird heading off to the sky.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, hadn’t it been exquisite when Hectile sent his carrier pigeon?</p>
<p>“You don’t really need to prod like this, Hectile.”</p>
<p>He knew. He didn’t know.</p>
<p>But..<em>.it keeps on appearing.</em></p>
<p>Even Farid knew. That he didn’t have the right to say that he was selfish to see Levisia, who couldn’t lean to either side easily.</p>
<p>The same was true of him comparing something else with her. He put off his decision due to hesitation and settled for an unstable reality.</p>
<p>Just like Levisia had hoped, Farid too wanted to be with her forever.</p>
<p>So he had postponed it a little more. The choice, however, only added a little danger.</p>
<p>The situation was now at the end, and it may go wrong if it were delayed further.</p>
<p>That’s what Hectile was concerned about. It would have been no more anxiety for him who would have watched his lingering feelings closer than anyone else.</p>
<p>That’s why he had to make a decision.</p>
<p>No, actually the decision had already been made.</p>
<p>From when Farid had coveted Levisia’s lips or from when she had said that she was ready to let him go.</p>
<p><em>Right, then..</em></p>
<p>The Levisia at that time, as if she had looked into his heart, had only told him what he wanted to hear. Heh-heh, the Devil’s whisper.</p>
<p>She probably wouldn’t know even if she thought about it for her entire life. In what temptation her words had come to him, what kind of desire she had instigated, and how―</p>
<p>Sweet they’d been.</p>
<p>Farid buried his head in his folded arms. The tip of his right ear was red with heat.</p>
<p>“Heh-heh-heh.”</p>
<p>It was a laugh because it was ridiculous. It was also an empty laugh from a deranged person, as he couldn’t win against the feeling of loss.</p>
<p>How happy had he been when he went crazy and opened her lips? When he tasted her breath urgently, he finally wanted to dedicate everything to her.</p>
<p>That was a moment he often dreamed of. Since some time ago, he had been longing for it.</p>
<p>And the reality was more than a dream. Incomparable. That moment was oh so sweet. Even thinking about it again gave him a deep pleasure that tugged at the back of his head.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it was scary.</p>
<p>Starting with tangled hands, everywhere in contact with her pulsated with fear. He still couldn’t forget the feeling that his whole body had become a heart as if he had been held in her hand.</p>
<p>His heart was beating frighteningly as if he were chased by fear. It felt like he was going to throw up his heart through the lips that had touched hers.</p>
<p>Scared. He was so scared.</p>
<p>Of the woman rattling his heart like this. Her sweet breath was like drugs. And…</p>
<p>Farid thought he wanted to turn his back on everything at once at that kiss.</p>
<p>And Levisia seemed like she could really do that. She was that type of existence. She was already grasping that power in his heart.</p>
<p>Farid wanted to pretend to be crazy and beg for affection. In fact, even if he didn’t go crazy, he thought that he would always beg in front of her.</p>
<p><em>Just one time..</em>.</p>
<p>Could she not love him?</p>
<p>Leave everything behind and look only at me, don’t go anywhere, stay by my side, out of everyone else’s sight…</p>
<p>“Whew.”</p>
<p>Letting out a breath of air, he lifted his head.</p>
<p>It was a crazy emotion. It couldn’t be normal. He had pretended to be crazy, taking his lips away, and he must have been really crazy.</p>
<p>Everything was a mess. So much that his telling Hectile not to worry was funny.</p>
<p>That’s why he had no choice but to make a decision on what he had put off. Before he becomes really crazy.</p>
<p>Farid closed his eyes at the blowing wind. It wasn’t until he plucked off all of the grains of sand with slow hands that he opened them.</p>
<p>Before he knew it, he had stepped off to the outside of Sheila’s room—that is, after shutting the window. As soon as he came out another door opened.</p>
<p>“You’re here.”</p>
<p>The one who’d opened it was Levisia. She flinched in surprise as soon as she saw him.</p>
<p>Farid knew that she had come in front of the room and hesitated for a long time before coming in. If he told her that even her hesitation was lovely, she would really see him as a crazy person.</p>
<p>But what should he do, that he was so crazy about her?</p>
<p>“How’s Sheila?” asked Levisia in a firm voice, hiding her surprise in an unperturbed way.</p>
<p>It was Farid’s favorite voice. A voice like wind blowing in a clear forest. It was not light, but she didn’t put any weight on it, and it seemed dry and friendly.</p>
<p>“She is fine.”</p>
<p>“Really? That’s a relief…”</p>
<p>It was good to hear her voice mixed with her breathing. From then, Levisia, however, kept her lips clamped.</p>
<p>Farid smiled uncontrollably when he found himself feeling sorry for her. Soon, he was the one to open his mouth first.</p>
