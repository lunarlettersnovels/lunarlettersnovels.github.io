            <p><b>Chapter 29 – The Sun as Red as Blood</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sun had painted the sky crimson by the time Levisia finally returned to the palace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re finally back.” Pel was sweeping up the entrance when she came through. “You haven’t eaten yet, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. I think I’ll have a simple meal. I’m tired.” She replied, covering her mouth as a soft yawn escaped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll relay the message.” Pel continued to sweep, not minding her presence one bit. Levisia stood in the corner and watched him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you doing?” His eyes narrowed in confusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing.” She continued watching him sweep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought you were tired. Why don’t you go inside and rest?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like I haven’t seen you for quite some time recently,” she said softly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pel stopped sweeping and looked up at her words. A peculiar expression crossed his face as it caught the glow of the sunset. “So you’re just going to stand there and watch me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can’t I?” She questioned with a slight smile gracing her words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imagine how it feels to be observed,” he replied monotonously.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Would it be uncomfortable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,’ she wondered. “So you don’t like it?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not that exactly. Doesn’t bother me that much.” Pel looked away from her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She placed her arms under her bosom and settled into watching him. The way he worked with a blank expression made him seem like a statue. Always blank and hiding secrets. After a quiet moment, Pel broke the silence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You always have your way, Your highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me?” She shook her head in denial at his words. “There’s no one more predictable than me. Where else would you find another master easier to attend to?” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I always gently inform the attendants when they forget their manners and I let rude behaviors slide.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then what?” She asked, slightly annoyed. The only sound that echoed in the room was the broom’s strokes as it swept the ground. Pel calmly spoke, “Your highness is the one who’s been absent these days, not me. But now you’re…” He trailed off and Levisia tilted her head to the side. “Watching you as I please?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, basically, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can watch me too, then.” She gathered her long dress and crouched down. Pel gave her a baffled look at her ungraceful posture on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like you, your highness?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing will happen even if we don’t see each other for a couple of days,” Pel muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re the one who felt sad about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who said anything about being sad</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia interrupted before he could finish speaking. “Then I’ll just keep watching you,” she informed him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“See, you do insist on your own way.” Pel shook his head and put away the broom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you done?” She queried as she lifted herself off the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll finish it up later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because of me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Half of it is,” he stated, looking into the distance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about the other half?” She took a step towards Pel and he immediately withdrew with narrowed eyes. “Why do you keep trying to strike up a conversation today?” He asked with blatant suspicion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven’t talked much lately,” she replied nonchalantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know. So why are you suddenly like this?” Pel looked down at her with his head to one side as he gestured to her. “Have you always been this concerned about me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course. You’ll be with me when I leave the royal grounds,” she stated confidently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pel’s face stiffened at her words. ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I say something wrong?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She pondered while he lowered his head.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you sincere about that statement?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You won’t come with me?” She was bewildered. Would he want to stay behind? ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave Pel behind knowing what will happen here? I couldn’t do that.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not that,” he said. “The part where you will leave this place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve said it before. I haven’t changed her mind.” Even after getting involved with the Kraidens, she still worried for her life. She became more desperate after getting entangled with their lives. Instead of withering away amongst them, she’d rather leave. Running away would be the best way to survive.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But you have been spending time with them.” She knew exactly who Pel was referring to when he said ‘them’. “They’re all…” Pel suddenly stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pel looked up when Levisia parroted his words. His calm golden eyes stared at her for a brief moment, and he slowly glided past her. “It’s nothing. Let’s go in. it’s getting dark.” He walked by her and led the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sunset that lit the path was as red as blood. </span></p>
