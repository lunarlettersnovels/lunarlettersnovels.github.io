            <p><b>Chapter 14 – Mystifying Fairy Tree </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t feel that way, sis?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia kept her silence to Lidan’s question. As a matter of fact, Siaphyl had said something similar a few days ago. She didn’t know how to phrase it, but she didn’t feel it because she wasn’t a legitimate Kraiden. It was well known that the Kraidens regarded the Fairy Tree more particularly than the nameless siblings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was fair to assume why they cherished and treasured the Fairy Tree: it was essentially the source of their power. For that reason, it seemed that Lidan and Siaphyl both felt something she couldn’t feel. So, to say that her powers were too ordinary to feel anything would be a better way to put it.  Levisia pondered for a moment for a refined way to articulate her thoughts but eventually, she ended up telling him plainly:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do not feel anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, because I am not a Kraiden…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah.” Lidan nodded his head as though he roughly understood what it meant. Truthfully, it was even dismal he understood that.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I mean, should I be thankful that he understood that?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s even a saying, “A genius cannot comprehend an average person.” They cannot comprehend the other like because what may be easy and natural for them might not be so for an average person.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Yes, it seems better to think it this way than have him just wonder why I can’t feel it.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you sure you didn’t secretly transplant a Fairy Tree here?” Lidan raised his eyebrows, still skeptical. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she looked at him, speechless, Lidan tilted his head as if to regard her as strange, but it seemed to her that he was the stranger one here. “Why would I transplant a tree that cannot survive outside the forest?” She asked, holding back the urge to plant her palm on her face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Lidan said something very odd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You never know. It could all be made-up that it cannot survive outside the forest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? Is it so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia stopped following him around, baffled by his unpredictable demeanor. It took a while before Lidan looked back at her after wandering around some more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I get it now,” Lidan said with a grin, “it wasn’t the place, but the person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Lidan’s eyes seemed to gleam insidiously as he said those words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia kept herself in her sanctuary as much as possible since the day Lidan visited, fearing running into another Kraiden if she left. However, despite her efforts, visitors to her palace only increased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, sis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here he was with a lazy face waving at her when he should be taking his nap by the window in the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Third Prince, your highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think I’ve gotten used to that cold greeting now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a week now, Lidan had been coming to her palace every day, just like Siaphyl did. Once they became acquainted with her, it continued on for reasons only known to them. How could she leave the palace? She intended to visit the garden but became unsure where she wanted to go because of him. Just then, Lidan approached her and handed her a book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You haven’t read this one yet, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last of the [How to Survive] series: How to Survive in a Dragon’s Lair. It was no wonder Lidan knew which books she had read and which she hadn’t. He would come by every day to see what she was doing.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This is rather nice.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidan had been bringing her books, sparing her the effort and time to visit the library. Though it seemed as though she were treating Lidan as an errand boy… But nice is nice. What could she say? It was not like she asked him for it. He acted willingly. Owing to him, she now owned a stack of five books in her room. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘But I have yet to finish the previous book, How to Survive a Volcano. I must hurry.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where were you heading to today?” Lidan asked as he followed behind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving the books in her room, she answered, “I was going to the garden.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is there to see?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had forgotten that Lidan thought the garden was nothing but a bare piece of earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have something to do there.” She had planned to put in support rods for the seedlings so that they would grow straight and healthy. By now, Sheila and Pel would’ve started already, so she had to go soon as well. “Are you going to keep following me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shouldn’t surprise you. That’s all I’ve been doing these past few days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could he so proudly talk about having nothing better to do? He was correct though. However, she couldn’t argue and went to the garden with him trailing after her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, upon arriving at the garden, Lidan was filled with disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is this?” </span></p>
