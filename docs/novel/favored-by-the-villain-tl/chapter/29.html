            <p>To Levisia’s immense relief, they were both soon outside the lighthouse and sprinting down the stairs leading to the pier. Her legs hurt, she was out of breath, and her heartfelt as though it was about to explode, but she was in the home stretch.</p>
<p>She barely had enough time to catch her breath when the old man let out a cry of surprise. Levisia looked up in time to see one of the kraken’s tentacles lash out and strike the lighthouse.</p>
<p>Without stopping to think about what had just happened, Levisia took off down the stairs. She was already aching from running down all the stairs of the lighthouse, and now this was pushing her over the edge. But it was better that she made it out alive and with a body that hurt all over than be crushed beneath a pile of rubble. After all, it wasn’t just for her sake that she was fleeing to safety, but also for that of the lighthouse keeper who was now struggling to keep up with her. The ground was violently shaking as she clung to the railings, glancing up to see that the lighthouse was still intact and the old man was lagging behind.</p>
<p>There was a brief moment when she paused and wondered why she was doing this. Why was she risking her life to save a stranger she didn’t know existed until a few minutes ago? Why did she bother going up the lighthouse in the first place? She had acted on a whim the moment she saw that it was still lit up, without even asking if it was occupied or not. That whim of hers was about to get her killed. Maybe she should have listened to the Kraidens and stayed where she was, where it was safe and they could coddle her.</p>
<p>And then, as the kraken’s roar filled the air, she realized her answer: No, she was not going to stay put. The Kraidens didn’t own her, and she was going to set herself apart from the Kraidens. They helped people because they had to, due to their position as royalty, and to increase their reputation for their own selfish goals. But she was different. She was helping people because she wanted to help them. Like how she helped Viola Mentine, even if she did have a little assistance from the strange voice in her head. She still didn’t have any answers for that, but she was still happy that she was able to save the little girl from her crippling illness that was tearing the family apart.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were interrupted by the old man grasping onto her hand and tugging her forcibly. The lighthouse keeper was looking at her, his eyes wide with fear. She knew he didn’t have the strength to carry on, but he was also afraid to die by the kraken. She could see it out of the corner of her eye, gearing up for another swipe at the lighthouse. One more hit was all it would take to completely destroy it and bury them both in the rubble.</p>
<p>She didn’t want that to happen, but she also did not have the strength to carry on. Her legs had given out, and her heart was beating so fast it was painful. The only way for them to be saved was for some external force to swoop in and save the day.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” She said, tears forming in her eyes. “I wish there was some way to save us both.”</p>
<p>No sooner had the words left her mouth, a gust of wind blew past her. It was not salty, as one would expect from a sea breeze. No, it was as fresh as a walk in the meadow on a summer’s day. Light, refreshing, and bringing about a promise of hope.</p>
<p>Stunned, Levisia reached out to touch the wind, which seemed to move away as if playing a game with her. There was a small giggle as it brushed past her again.</p>
<p>“Say those magic words again.”</p>
<p>Levisia paused, unsure if she was hearing things in a blind panic. She reached out once more, and this time, the wind danced around her fingers. The childish giggle once again filled her ears.</p>
<p>“Go on, you know you want to. Say what you wish, and we will listen.”</p>
<p>“I…” Levisia opened her mouth to speak but was cut off by the unmistakable sound of the kraken lashing out and striking the lighthouse. The ground beneath her feet began to shake, and dust was filling her lungs. She glanced up and screamed as the top of the lighthouse, which had been severed clean in half, was beginning to crumble. If she delayed any longer, she would be crushed. It would take days to recover her body.</p>
<p>“I wish for myself and the old man to be far away from here!” She cried out into the wind, hoping that it hadn’t abandoned her in her time of need.</p>
