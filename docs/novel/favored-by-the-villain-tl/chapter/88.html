            <p><strong>Chapter 82 – The Three Thieves</strong></p>
<p>As Pel was speaking, Levisia could feel something strange taking place, something that was causing her to lose her mind. It felt like there was a ringing sound in her ears. She wondered if Pel was feeling the same way as he pulled her away from the gatekeeper and let go of her waist with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“I think we’re in the clear.” He said after they had walked down the corridor and were out of earshot. The strange feeling hadn’t vanished, and Levisia wondered if Pel was feeling the same way. She looked up at Pel, her eyes locking with his.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me?” Levisia demanded, as if she hadn’t been doing the exact same thing.</p>
<p>“I should be the one asking you that. You look shocked all of a sudden. It’s your eyes. They say the eyes betray all your emotions.” Pel said, his own eyes seeming to shine brightly. “Although you seem to have other things on your mind.”</p>
<p>Pel was right. Out the corner of her eye, Levisia spotted three figures in the garden outside. She pressed herself up against the wall, Pel doing the same on the other side. Together, they peered out to see what was happening.</p>
<p>The three strangers were all huddled together, discussing something. None of them were wearing a mask, despite the black market’s rule.</p>
<p>“That man. He was the one who stole the necklace.” Levisia whispered as she pointed to the one who looked exactly like her sketch. His bushy eyebrows and the mole on his nose were identical.</p>
<p>“And that woman there, she was the street vendor who sold us flowers during the Fairy Festival. It appears they are in the same group.” Pel nodded to the woman talking to the thief. “Figures.”</p>
<p>The three of them finished talking and put their masks on. Levisia pulled away from the window and sighed.</p>
<p>“What shall we do, Pel?” She asked. If they were to confront them, it would be three against two, so in terms of numbers they were at a disadvantage. But couldn’t they at least grab one of them? Shake them up and confront them about why they stole the necklace and how it ended up at the black market?</p>
<p>Whilst Levisia weighed up the options in her mind, Pel suddenly pressed himself against the wall. Confused, she did the same and counted to ten. Only then did she risk a peek. All three of them  were looking back at her, causing her to leap back with a startled yelp.</p>
<p>“They know who we are.” Pel cursed under his breath.</p>
<p>“Even with our masks on?” Levisia checked to see if her mask was still in place. Her mask was still in place, though her hair was beginning to fall loose from it’s elaborate hair style.</p>
<p>“Yes. But this is the right moment to strike. Stay here.” Pel said, unlocking the window.</p>
<p>“Wait! What are you doing?” Levisia hissed. “You can’t be serious! I’m not staying here alone!” She did not like the idea of being left behind in such a dangerous place, especially when the thieves were around. She was sticking with Pel, regardless of what he said.</p>
<p>“Are you sure? I don’t want you getting caught up in the fighting.” Pel said, his hands clasped on the window as he struggled to open it.</p>
<p>“I can handle myself. Go. I’ll be right behind you.” Levisia hoisted the window open with Pel. With the grace and skill of someone who had experience, Pel leapt through the window and set off running after the thieves. Levisia couldn’t jump through like Pel, so slid across the windowsill while holding her dress down. Fortunately for them, they were on the ground floor and thus were in no danger of broken bones.</p>
<p>With her feet safely on the ground, Levisia ran to catch up with Pel. He and the three people were already off in the distance. Two of them disappeared behind a door leading into the building, whilst Pel tackled the third member to the ground. After hosting him up and giving him a thorough shake, Pel demanded to know where the necklace was being kept. That’s when the man reached behind him and pulled out a sharp blade.</p>
<p>“Pel! Be careful!” Levisia called out, hurrying over to Pel. Her words, however, were in vain as Pel had already disarmed the assailant and now had him pinned to the floor by his knee. As soon as Levisia got close, the man lifted his head, used his free arm to wipe the blood away from his forehead, and called out for security.</p>
