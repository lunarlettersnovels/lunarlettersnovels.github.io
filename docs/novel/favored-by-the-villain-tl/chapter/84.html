            <p><strong>Chapter 86 – Jealousy</strong></p>
<p>On his way to the palace, Pel stopped by the rest area to change his outfit</p>
<p>“We’ll clean up this place and come up with a contact.” Hectile said, packing things away in boxes.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Hectile. And I have one more favour to ask of you: track down the thieves. Two men and one woman. One of them has an accent like those in the Pasci Empire.”</p>
<p>Pel said he walked out of the rest area and down the dimly-lit streets. At the end of the road was a tall wall, behind which were many lives that he needed to die for sooner or later. Again…</p>
<p>Hectile already seemed to have a new rest area in mind, but Pel didn’t think that it would be so easy to just up and move. He’d lost his special card in the form of Levisia so he had to make do without her. However, did he really have to do that? Levisia was irrelevant. He could already hear her voice chastising him about how he should be the one to cover it up.</p>
<p>Pel rubbed his throbbing head, trying to keep his headache at bay, as he passed through the gate with no difficulties and reached the palace where Levisia lived.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re here?”</p>
<p>Pel slowly lifted his head at the sound of Levisia’s voice. Levisia herself was squatting down over the flowerbed. She got to her feet, holding a bouquet of flowers. Seeing Levisia in a thin dress, he began to instinctively take off his jacket, as if to keep her warm.</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s no need. I’m not really cold.” Levisia smiled at her flowers.</p>
<p>Pel came to his senses and awkwardly shuffled his jacket back on.</p>
<p>“I was worried.” Levisia admitted in a small voice. “Come inside, you must be tired. It hasn’t been long since I was last pestered.”</p>
<p>“Pestered?” Pel gripped his hands into tight fists. “I thought the Kraidens were going to treat you well?”</p>
<p>“Well, they are. But since I came back, it’s not just been those two people who have been sticking close to me. The others have as well.” Levisia sheepishly rubbed the back of her neck. The soft evening breeze blew through the garden, causing the hem of her dress to sway gently. Her silver hair and green eyes were shining brightly in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Pel could only stare blankly at her. He knew about Elizabeth and Lidan, but when did more show up? “You seem to attract a lot of crazy people,” he muttered under his breath.</p>
<p>Levisia obviously heard what he said as she blinked and laughed softly.</p>
<p>“What, are you jealous, Pel?”</p>
<p>Pel tried his best not to wince at her words. Jealousy… This dark, clingy thought. How could he express his feelings through such words? It was as though Leivisia knew exactly what she was thinking.</p>
<p>Pel clenched his jaw, trying to unravel his thoughts. They were so muddled that he couldn’t tell where one thought began and another ended.</p>
<p>“What if I am?” Pel managed to say, his voice calm despite everything that was going on inside his mind. “What if you’re right, and I am jealous?”</p>
<p>Levisia’s eyes widened. She dropped her flowers to the ground and walked over to him.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Are you hurt somewhere?” she asked, reaching out to briefly touch his forehead with the back of her hand. It was easy to see that she hadn’t asked that to change the subject. As her hand dropped down again, her fingers brushed with Pel’s. There was a quick moment when they both flinched, but soon it was like nothing had even happened.</p>
<p>“And if I’m not hurt?” Pel said, taking a step closer.</p>
<p>Levisia tilted her head up to look at him.</p>
<p>“If you’re not hurt, then what is the matter?” She asked, her voice quiet. “It’s not like you to behave like this. Are you tired? Cold?”</p>
<p>Pel sighed quietly, and turned to walk away from the awkward situation he had gotten himself in. He knew what he was feeling, but had no idea how Levisia felt.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I interrupted you.” He said, as he turned to walk away. “I shall leave you alone now.”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait? You didn’t interrupt me. Pel, come back please!” Levisia grabbed hold of Pel’s arm. Pel stopped in his tracks and craned his neck to smile at Levisia. His blonde wig was slipping off his head.</p>
<p>“Is there anything else you’d like to hear from me?” Levisia didn’t even have time to answer before he fully turned to face her. “I like you,” he whispered into her ear. “Does that answer your question?”</p>
<p>Levisia, the expression on her face unreadable, raised her hands and pushed him away. “Who confesses so horribly like this?”</p>
