            <p><b>Chapter 28 – Miracle by an Untold Princess</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Could I really be a human medicine?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Levisia was floating about her thoughts when Elizabeth urgently called out to her, dragging her back to reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like he is going to wake up. When he does, please don’t tell him I was here,” she said as she hurriedly gathered herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry? What do you- Your Highness! Your Highness!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She let go of his hand and rushed out of the room.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What is going on?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia was about to follow Elizabeth but just as she took a step, a hand closed around her wrist and she was rooted to her spot. The hand encircling her wrist was big, pale and rough against her skin. ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No way.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She slowly turned her head to see the man staring at her with hooded purple eyes— the same purple eyes that she had been looking into just a few minutes ago. Eyes just like Elizabeth’s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you save…” He trailed off as if unsure whether he should continue the question.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Damn it.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nope,” she quickly answered, hoping that there would be no misunderstandings. He coughed into his fist and bestowed her a look of confusion. “Then why are you…” He motioned to the room they were in, his uncertainty very clear in his tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s, I mean…” she dragged out her words, a bit unsure what to say to him. “Anyway, that’s not the case.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cough escaped him as he fist the sheets in his hand. “Water please,” he called as he cleared his throat after his hacking fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are mistaken. Alright?” Levisia declared, completely ignoring him. She wanted to get it across to him that she did not save him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay,” he said as he broke down coughing again. “But water!” He exclaimed as he let out another round of coughs that sounded painful. “Are you trying to kill…” He relapsed into another coughing fit, and Levisia slowly turned her head towards him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She observed him as she realized that he was desperately pleading for something while she was trying to explain herself.  ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water? Did he ask for water?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked around the room and noticed a pitcher of water on the table tucked next to the bed. She hastily picked up the pitcher and handed it to him as she repeated what she had been saying. “I’m not it. Whatever you’re thinking I am, I’m not it. Whatever or whoever you’re thinking of isn’t me,” she said, stressing that it wasn’t her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silence pervaded the room as her words reached their end. She continued observing him. She already had a lot on her plate with Siaphyl, Lidan, and Elizabeth and she refuses to be needed by another person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia watched as he just stared at the pitcher and looked over to her like she was an idiot. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I should give him a cup for his water though,’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she thought as his gaze remained on the jug. “Here’s the cup. Drink as much as you like. It should soothe your throat and make it feel better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked up at her with his dull purple eyes and closed them with a sigh. He didn’t acknowledge the glass she was holding out to him as if he no longer needed the water.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia stared down at the man laid out on the bed and couldn’t help but wonder if he was alive. He looked so lifeless. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Did I kill him?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could see not a single movement. Just as she was about to go over and check, she heard his harsh breathing and sighed in relief. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Good. He’s still alive.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was genuinely relieved. She worried she was going to get caught with assassinating a royalty again. That’s a relief. If she had gotten a verdict of, ‘death caused by the fifteenth princess’s refusal to give water,’ it would’ve been terrible. She would be in so much trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She moved towards the bed and removed the pitcher from his hand, returning it to the table. She turned around to exit the room when Elizabeth, who she thought had left, poked her head in.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Highness?” she questioned, a bit confused that she was still around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What happened? Did he not wake up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She shook her head as she looked down at the man who was fast asleep. “No he did wake up. He just fell asleep.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘He is sleeping right?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia wondered silently as she stared at his unmoving body. ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope he didn’t pass out due to dehydration.’ </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth quietly approached as she gazed upon hima and muttered, “He looks much better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was right. A minute ago he had looked like he was about to be placed in a coffin, but now color had been added to his skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So you are indeed…” Elizabeth looked at Levisia and she could see the question in her brilliantly purple eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, Your Highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?” She asked as if her statement baffled her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is all because of your caring heart, Your Highness. You reached out to him and helped with his recovery.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what do you mean?” She exclaimed, a blush coating her cheeks. “I didn’t care for anyone!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia shook her head softly at her words as a slight smile attached itself to her lips. If she didn’t care, then why was she rushing around with desperate eyes and wishes he would get better? Elizabeth shook her head profusely in denial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-why would I care for something like him?” She stuttered as she wrung her fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He is, at the very least, your brother. How could you call him a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘thing’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“B-brother! I’ve never had a pale thing like him as a brother!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This man who had been at Death’s Door was the Second Prince, fReign Moror. He is Elizabeth’s biological brother. Despite being of noble birth, he had no powers like Elizabeth so he wasn’t bestowed the Kraiden name. He is very sick and his only sister pretends to not care about him. They always say he was unfortunate. His existence contrasted Elizabeth’s, who is extremely fortunate. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Maybe I should have helped him earlier with the water situation. Maybe he deserved to know that someone was looking out for his well-being.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia looked at him with pity and regret for he was so unfortunate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denying that she cared for her family, Elizabeth quickly changed the subject. “You seem to have some connection with the Fairy Tree,” she stated randomly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pardon?” Confusion laced her voice as she shot her a bewildered look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You really don’t know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia merely stared at her silently, waiting for her to elaborate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The feeling you’re giving off?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She nodded her head at her but couldn’t help but wonder why she was oblivious to the things they seemed to know.</span></p>
