            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 1 – The Nameless Empress</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Levisia opened her eyes, a hand hovered above her face. It was an unusually large hand. At the moment she breathed, someone said, “You finally woke up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She  rolled her eyes to see whose voice it was. Certainly, those words weren’t her own murmur, but she couldn’t move an inch. Then, a familiar guy came into vision, but it was difficult to speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Highness? Is this real?” he asked as he thrust his face closer. Levisia traced his eyes with her fingers, which she managed to lift after immense effort, and spoke in a hoarse voice. “Your eyes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah.” He frowned, quickly closed his eyes, and retreated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She withdrew her  wandering hand, thinking she must have touched a sensitive spot. As a servant in the palace, Pel takes on many responsibilities but is full of secrets. He hates talking about his past, doesn’t mention his family nor does he like to touch others. Once in a while, he showed a sensitive reaction to all of these. Just like now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia groaned as she lifted her body up. Her one and only servant seemed to have no intention of helping, so she couldn’t do much. As she barely rested her back on the headboard and looked around the room, she caught sight of a familiar scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This room, neither too big nor too small, was simple. Only dull furniture placed throughout the room occupied some space, but the rest wasn’t much. It was plain and modest, exactly how she remembered her room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, she turned her head and gazed at Pel. Between his large eyes, there was a nose large enough for a bird to sit on; his skin was fair and white and his lips were deep red although he never applied anything. Oftentimes, his orbs glimmered bright golden; at other times, they glimmered an unusual glow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pel was a good-looking guy who gave the impression of being somewhere between a boy and a young man. Except for his fluffy blonde hair and crooked posture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His golden locks barely brushed his shoulder muscles, and it made her wonder if he did this purposely to distinguish his beauty. On top of that, he hunched around as if he was hiding a secret. If only he would straighten out his bent torso, he’d look much taller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, he doesn’t try to hide his good looks. As expected, nothing’s complete without an attractive face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you looking at me like that?” He turned around to see if she was glaring at him. In return, Levisia asked him the same question that had been lingering in her head. “This place is Kraiden, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He responded, attempting to conceal his embarrassment, “If it weren’t so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No…” she clenched and stretched out her pale hands. She still felt the scent of burning on the tip of her nose. Perhaps it was because of a long dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Am I alive?” When Levisia asked him to confirm, he gazed at her with a peculiarly expressionless face. “You almost died, but I’m surprised to see you wake up like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What happened?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cause is unknown. Even the doctor is clueless.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crisis came that almost killed her, and even the doctor didn’t know? She asked this as she felt a bit leery, “So, how long was I lying here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pel directed his head towards the bedside table, to where the calendar was. “It’s been two weeks. This whole time, I was watching you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-four years old. The age that will greet death. Levisia had just seen twenty-four years of memories in two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where am I injured?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t have any injuries?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pel looked over her body as she spoke. There weren’t any particular problems. “My clothes are wet. Was I sweating? I want to wash up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re not hurt anywhere, correct?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pel frowned at her uncertain reply, but she didn’t even know why she was laying here for two weeks. Isn’t that even stranger? As Levisia shrugged her shoulders, Pel turned up without saying a word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll run the bathwater and tell Mrs. Merne.” Pel left the room shortly, then Mrs. Merne entered just like he had said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheila Merne. This woman has been the only one to raise her since she was a child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Highness.” Her hands covered her mouth as she entered through the door and witnessed Levisia’s condition. Levisia could have guessed that she must have been very worried about her. “Dear God, thank you.”</span></p>
