            <p>Siaphyl was dressed in a way that would not be unusual if he were to fall asleep. He was dressed elegantly in white satin pajamas in the shape of a blouse with frills.</p>
<p>He appears to have planned everything…</p>
<p>Levisia, on the other hand, couldn’t imagine falling asleep next to Siaphyl. Could she sleep peacefully next to this tiny Kraiden?</p>
<p>Siaphyl bowed his head with a sullen expression, perhaps because an embarrassed look appeared on her face while she was thinking hard.</p>
<p>When she looked down from above, all she saw was his long nose and chubby baby fat. Oh, and his bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>Please be patient. Are your eyes red?</p>
<p>Siaphyl, who seemed to be on the verge of tears, said at the same time she noticed them,</p>
<p>“Everyone who sees me wants to pat me. Why are you so aloof? “I’m… hurt.”</p>
<p>…because I know you’re a terrifying individual who will tear your siblings apart in the future, young ones.</p>
<p>Levisia, on the other hand, was unable to respond in this manner. And because she promised not to regard the boy as a potential murderer.</p>
<p>Levisia lowered herself to match his eye level. She carefully reached out, her gaze absorbed in his red eyes above his trembling plump cheeks.</p>
<p>When Siaphyl flinched and lifted his head, the boy’s tears fell sharply from his eyes.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Levisia sighed softly and brushed her thumb across the corner of his eyes. Fortunately, she had been successful.</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>She could see his eyes getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to pet it because it was so lovely. What else can Levisia say?</p>
<p>Instead of complimenting him, she asked him in the most diplomatic manner possible,</p>
<p>“Have you already brushed your teeth?”</p>
<p>Siaphyl moved his head up and down as he blinked his wide eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, yes.”</p>
<p>“Good. Please come in.”</p>
<p>Levisia spoke up, leaning against the door. But Siaphyl just kept staring at the door and her.</p>
<p>“Are you going to let me in?”</p>
<p>Siaphyl, who was normally brilliant and had never stuttered, replied as if he couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Levisia responded after returning her gaze to her bed.</p>
<p>“My bed is large, so our sleeping habits will not cause any problems.”</p>
<p>She could see his brow furrowing.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a sleeping routine.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Siaphyl opened his mouth as if about to refute something, but then carefully stepped into the room, and she nodded as if she believed him.</p>
<p>“Please excuse me.”</p>
<p>When Levisia entered, she shut the door behind him.</p>
<p>“Your room is identical to mine.”</p>
<p>“I’m guessing the furnishings are similar.”</p>
<p>“It is, but this room is more comfortable.”</p>
<p>Siaphyl smiled brightly and moved quickly as if he’d forgotten he’d been crying just a moment before.</p>
<p>Levisia thought she was about to be attacked by the little devil, but when she saw his excitement return, she wondered what he was like.</p>
<p>Unlike other times, his excitement could be seen in his steps. As he ran towards the bed, his brilliant blonde hair bobbed up and down.</p>
<p>He jumped into bed as soon as Sheila stepped back after tidying it. Then he put his neck out there and called her name.</p>
<p>“Levy, come over here. Quickly.”</p>
<p>This was her first encounter with him, who always acted like a grown baby in this manner. After exchanging glances with Sheila, Levisia made her way to the bed.</p>
<p>“All right, good night.”</p>
<p>“And you, Sheila. Get some sleep.”</p>
<p>Sheila returned to her room and turned off the lights. Levisia, like Siaphyl, went under the blanket in the meantime.</p>
<p>Even though they didn’t sleep too far apart, it’s possible that an arm’s length distance was created between their bodies due to Siaphyl’s small body size.</p>
<p>Levisia lay down and gazed at the ceiling before turning her head and looking to the side.</p>
<p>His blue eyes were blinking in the dim moonlight. She didn’t expect to fall asleep quickly after seeing his clear eyes.</p>
<p>“You should get some sleep because you have to get up early tomorrow and move.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Ma’am.”</p>
<p>He nodded and closed his eyes, then opened them quickly and smiled. In a low whisper, the boy with his face half-buried in a pillow said,</p>
<p>“I appreciate you listening to my whining.”</p>
<p>Was that something that deserved to be acknowledged? To begin with, it could have been a release from guilt. Levisia regretted only seeing him as a potential murderer.</p>
<p>It would have been unjust if Siaphyl had known.</p>
<p>Levisia agreed but responded as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“I did because you don’t do that very often.”</p>
<p>“…pardon me?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it difficult to see you that way?”</p>
<p>Today’s Siaphyl had cried and whined like a child. On any given day, she would never see those aspects of him.</p>
<p>That the weak-looking boy who had come to protect her showed those sides of himself was not without her responsibility.</p>
<p>Children, in particular, can easily pick up on the emotions of those around them, so Siaphyl may have noticed her fear. That could be why he’d gotten upset and cried.</p>
<p>Siaphyl muttered as he buried his crimson face in a pillow,</p>
<p>“Sorry. I only want to show you my mature side, but… “I’m still acting like this.”</p>
