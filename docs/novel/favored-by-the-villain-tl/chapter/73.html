            <p><strong>Chapter 97 – Don’t Keep Your Guard Down</strong></p>
<p>“Come now, Levy. There was no one around the palace.” Pel draped the towel around his shoulder. “I was only gone for ten minutes.”</p>
<p>Levisia flinched at the use of the nickname. Pel had obviously caught sight of it, as he frowned at her.</p>
<p>“What’s with the flinch? You don’t like when I call you that?” He said, sitting down on the edge of the bed. Levisia shook her head, her hair falling loose from its braid. And there was something in the air that was making her uncomfortable. Something she couldn’t put her finger on.</p>
<p>“It’s not really something I like. I much prefer just going by Levisia, if that’s alright with you.” She gripped the blanket between her hands.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll do what you like.” Pel said, causing Levisia to look at him suspiciously. He was smiling, a genuine smile, that made her feel even more on edge.</p>
<p>“Well, that sounds generous.” She said, and then it finally dawned on her what was out of place. “Wait… You’re here? You’re not avoiding me?</p>
<p>“You told me to stop doing that.” Pel shrugged his shoulders. “Why, do you want me to leave you alone again?”</p>
<p>“What? No! I mean… I just didn’t expect you to listen to me straight away.” Pel rubbed the back of her neck. “Is this because I threatened to reveal your identity if you didn’t stop ignoring me?”</p>
<p>“Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. Now, have you figured out where you are, and how you got here?” Pel said, nodding to the blanket clasped between her hands.</p>
<p>“I’m in your room. But how did I get here? I was in the garden with you, and now… I’m here.” Levisia thought about how she could have fallen asleep in one place and woke up somewhere else. Heat rose to her face when she finally realised what had happened.</p>
<p>“Figured it out, have you?” Pel got to his feet and rubbed his hair with the towel. “You were incredibly light, you know. Are you sure the Kraidens are feeding you enough?”</p>
<p>“Yes! I am being fed enough, and I…” Levisia stopped when she realised arguing with Pel was pointless. Instead, she asked what had been going through her mind. “But why here? Why not my room?”</p>
<p>“My room was closer.” Pel said, his back to Levisia. “And you are free to leave, you know. In fact, I suggest you head back right away.”</p>
<p>“Why? What’s going on?” Levisia rose from the bed, the blanket dropping to the floor as she walked over to Pel. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“Nothing really. Only that, as I was having a bath, I looked out my window and I spotted some people walking down a path.” Pel turned to face her, a smirk across his face. “They seemed pretty important, so I took a closer look at them. And wouldn’t you know it, they were the third and nineteenth princes.</p>
<p>Levisia stared in horror at Pel as his words sank in.</p>
<p>“Wait a second. That means… Oh no.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Judging from what has happened, they’ll go to your room as soon as they get here and look for you.”</p>
<p>“And you didn’t tell me? The whole time you knew they were coming, and you didn’t think to…” Levisia let out a groan of frustration and sprinted to the bedroom door. As soon as she turned the doorknob, Pel stuck his arm out to close the door.</p>
<p>“Stop letting your guard down, Levisia.” He said, looking down at her with a serious expression. “This palace is a dangerous place, full of people who may not have good intentions for you. Do not trust anybody here.”</p>
<p>“I know, Pel, I’m not an idiot.” Levisia said, knocking Pel’s hand away. “Do you really think I will let my guard down here?”</p>
<p>“You dropped it around me, remember?” Pel leant against the doorframe. “You were so certain that I would not hurt you that you fell asleep on me. Do you have idea how stupid of an idea that was?”</p>
<p>Levisia stopped and looked at Pel. He was trying his best to hide his true feelings, but his eyes were betraying him. She gently rested a hand over his arm.</p>
<p>“I trust you, Pel. We’ve been through too much for me to not trust you. And… I’m sorry I shouted at you, and blackmailed you. I’m just so tired of feeling like I am alone in a viper’s nest, where I have to watch my every move and control my tongue. But with you, I felt free.” She sighed and closed her eyes. “I just want someone I could be myself with.”</p>
<p>“I know, Levisia, but you should still watch yourself out there. Especially as it seems all the Kraidens are gathering together. Now,” he stepped back to allow Levisia to open the door. “Get going before they catch you here.”</p>
