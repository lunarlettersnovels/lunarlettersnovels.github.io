            <p><b>Chapter 17 – The White Rabbit</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since Lidan and Siaphyl ran into each other in Levisia palace, their visits to her place have been frequent. They often come at the same time as though they had planned it, and whenever that happened, they would frequently quarrel. Just like right now.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Baby brother, you shouldn’t be neglecting your studies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean neglect, brother? I am a very diligent student.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then how is it that you come here every day, hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The class ends early because I am very diligent in studies, brother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t know our Siaphyl was so brilliant! You’re going to make your big brother cry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidan teased Siaphyl that he was neglecting his studies. Siaphyl, while kindly responding, teased Lidan as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brother, have you replaced the seedling by the way? You pulled out a seedling mistaking it for a weed, remember?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You keep bringing it up when I told you I already have the day before yesterday, baby brother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, did you? I seem to forget often.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Isn’t it bad to be that forgetful at your age, baby brother?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, on that day when Lidan plucked the weeds out, he mistakenly plucked out a seedling. Levisia was shocked to find out after not keeping her eyes on him. He profusely apologized for his ignorance and planted a new seedling in its place himself. That was two days ago…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Looks like he’s going to tease about it forever.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siaphyl kept smiling as Lidan appeared to be embarrassed. He was such a little rascal. Because of this, the longer Levisia got to see them, the more distant they seemed from the image of the Kraidens she had in her head. In the book, the Kraidens were a broken family with no chance of restoration… Watching them quarrel over little things made them seem like a real family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the days went by with them visiting so often, Levisia began to have more intimate conversations with them. She found out that Siaphyl, who acted diligent, sometimes skipped his studies, and how Lidan came to take his naps in the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mother used to read there all the time.” Lidan shrugged his shoulders as he spoke of his childhood. “I’d go with my mother to the library, but instead of reading books, I’d fall asleep on her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed just what he’d do. As she thought about this, Levisia caught Siaphyl’s eyes. He seemed to be thinking the same thing. Just as Siaphyl put his finger over his lips to say it was a secret, Lidan continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That then became a habit. I can fall asleep very well in the library.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia nodded but soon stopped when she heard Lidan’s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sis, your middle name was given to you by your mother, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidan was right. When Levisia became part of the royalty, she gave up her original surname and instead kept her first name along with the middle name given by her mother as others had as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“White. How did you come to receive that name?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m curious too, sister.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They both asked, marveling. She opened her mouth, wondering how they reached this point of conversation. “Because of the color of my hair.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Color of your hair?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two pairs of eyes immediately focused on her hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia was given the rather ridiculous middle name White, because her hair was white. They can guess her mother’s ability to come up with names here. She was indeed a very unique person…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their reaction to her story was hard to pin down. More precisely, they both revealed a subtle smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s still pretty, sister.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Why is it ‘still’?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidan nodded to Siaphyl’s response and said, “How about Rabbit for a nickname?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know, like a white rabbit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia immediately detested the name. But Lidan liked it more when she showed her disdain. “Rabbit, rabbit. Isn’t it cute?” He even teased Levisia that the name he decided on his own was her nickname. “You don’t like it, sis?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, it’s just…” She gave up answering and nodded her head instead. Levisia decided not to care anymore. Then she noticed Siaphyl watching them, sullen. “What is the matter?” she asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siaphyl looked much more serious when she asked him the question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why was I born after you that I cannot call you by your name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Levisia looked at him wondering if he was being serious, his eyebrows drooped down, making him look even sadder. For a moment, even knowing his future and his true nature, he seemed rather adorable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the privilege of the elder ones, baby brother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidan did not miss the chance to boast and teased Siaphyl. But when Siaphyl appeared to get sadder, Lidan seemingly changed his attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then in that case, why don’t you call her sister Levisia?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siaphyl looked up at Levisia when he heard this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh… um…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was simply having her name being spoken and yet for some reason, she cringed a little at the thought of it. Levisia reluctantly nodded her head after pointlessly considering it. There was someone who gave her a nickname and was already calling her by that name, so having her name called wouldn’t be any worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am okay with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m so happy, sister Levisia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siaphyl immediately called her name and smiled genuinely. Watching this, Lidan muttered to himself.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels like something was taken away from me, but I guess what’s good is good.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’m the one whose name is being spoken and yet, why does Lidan feel like something has been taken away from him…?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite allowing him to call her name lightheartedly, Levisia felt her heart sinking heavily. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Now that they are calling me by my name, it seems like the plan to stay hidden and unnoticed until leaving this place has been rendered moot… But it can’t be that bad? It’s just the two of them, right? It will be okay… it has to be okay.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite trying to reassure herself, she wasn’t feeling very confident. </span></p>
