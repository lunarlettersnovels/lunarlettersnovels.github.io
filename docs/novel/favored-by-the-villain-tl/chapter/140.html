            <p><b>Chapter 30 – Levisia’s Unruly Sanctuary</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, for the first time in a while, Levisia stayed inside and read her books. This moment had been long awaited. The peace the books radiated as the letters captured her eyes, however, was soon shattered when a familiar voice invaded her room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why haven’t you come to see me today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Second Princess, your highness,” she replied and shifted from her sitting position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth barged in when the sun was still high in the sky and glared at her. She gnawed at her lips as she stared at me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was no instruction on me having to return,” she spoke, avoiding her gaze. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth’s eyes widened as if she heard something she had not expected. “Are you saying you will come by anytime at my word?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia quickly placed her book down next to her, deciding to be frank. “I also have work to do so going to see your highness everyday might be a bit of a stretch.” She actually didn’t have much to call work but if she didn’t put it this way, Elizabeth might really call her every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have work to do?” Elizabeth seemed to think for a bit and looked around. “Your palace is very small and dirty. It’s hardly breathable,” she stated with a nonchalant air about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry?” she questioned, a tad offended. Pel swept all day yesterday and mopped today. What does that make Pel if she said such words about her home?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How dare you make me come all the way out to this place,” she stated indignantly. “Shame on you. Move into my palace at once,” she demanded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your highness?” Levisia was extremely confused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why, what do you want?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia could only guess how extravagant and luxurious her palace would be considering how she spoke about theirs. But why was she suddenly accusing her palace of being dirty and unpleasant and demanding that she move into her palace?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think that’s appropriate,” Levisia replied, confusion still not leaving her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why not? Then you won’t have to get out of your way to come see me.” </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘So that was her plan all along.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppressing a sigh to escape her lips, Levisia politely declined her offer. “I still prefer her own palace. I find it comfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C-comfortable? Where? How is it comfortable?” Elizabeth asked, appearing to be completely baffled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like the tranquil and all the trees surrounding the place. I don’t mind being in a secluded area. It’s beautiful.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m less likely to run into a Kraiden, too. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This she didn’t say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I will stay here too!” She exclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?” Utter bewilderment littered her voice as Levisia regarded her. “You just said it was small and dirty and unpleasant…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You wouldn’t mind fixing up the place excluding the things you’ve mentioned?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Fix, what?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia’s features twisted into one of confusion. No sooner had the words left Elizabeth’s lips that people barged into the palace. They cleared the grassy path leading outside the palace. Flat stones were placed strategically to form a walkway and the trees were trimmed, vastly improving their appearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This looks much better now,” Elizabeth exclaimed as she surveyed the area. The unseemly path had been transformed into something that would not be out of place in a luxurious garden. Yet Elizabeth’s exclamation of satisfaction was bothersome. It was rather adorable when Elizabeth appeared earlier that day with leaves in her hair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rest will be completed soon enough,” she made a sweeping motion. “I shall not be doing this again since I am busy,” she stated with an air of superiority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your highness is the one who invited herself here…” Levisia trailed off slowly with slight confusion. Elizabeth harrumphed and pursed her lips, “Don’t stand here looking ill and go in!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia bowed to Elizabeth, bidding her farewell. As Elizabeth hesitantly took her steps, the words that rolled out of her tongue with a blush tinting her face were, “Not offering to stay for dinner? How inconsiderate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levisia stood still in the silence that permeated the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I even purposely came by at this hour.” Her last mumbling words were the least expected.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I had to offer her to stay?’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could have hinted at it instead of expecting her to know. But when you have to farm just to feed three people, offering a meal to someone else was a feat of luxury. Their food is precious; she could not simply afford to offer indifferently as though they were basking in riches.</span></p>
