            <p><strong>Chapter 3.2</strong></p>
<p>Even through his bloodstained pants, the exaggerated size and length of the bulging outline on his left thigh made it impossible to ignore. One didn’t need to be a genius to figure it out.</p>
<p>When Heeju ripped his pants to assess his injuries, the sight became even more impossible to ignore. His thick, blunt tip strained against his underwear, peeking out just above the waistband, unable to remain contained.</p>
<p>And yet, she tried to be casual, acting as though she hadn’t noticed. But this…?</p>
<p>The damp fabric clung to him, revealing the full girth of his shaft and the curves of its tip in unforgiving detail. Heeju averted her gaze, tearing her eyes away from the insistent outline of his member pressing against his underwear. She looked him in the eyes and spoke.</p>
<p>“In some patients, extreme pain can lead to an er3#ct!on. It’s an involuntary response, nothing to be embarrassed about. It sometimes happens…”</p>
<p>“Do I look embarrassed to you?”</p>
<p>The sensation creeping across her ears was hard to pin down—was it a chill or a surge of heat?</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re just naive, or that you can’t read the room?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re just too young.”</p>
<p>His voice was low and heavy, resonating like a deep, throbbing wave that wrapped around her ears, leaving them tingling. Heeju felt the fine hairs on her earlobes stand on end, a shiver running through her.</p>
<p>“If you’re not going to handle it yourself, just sit there and watch.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun spoke in a casual tone. Just as he was about to move his hand, Heeju quickly grabbed his wrist to stop him.</p>
<p>“If you tense your abs, the wound will reopen.”</p>
<p>Their gazes locked deeply. Though it was just their eyes that were intertwined, it strangely felt like their entire bodies were entangled.</p>
<p>“So, should we just sit here and watch? I’m sore down there, right now.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun’s intense gaze seemed to burn into Heeju.</p>
<p>“With this kind of e1r3ct!0n, I should have already been inside some hole. I’ve been holding back a lot.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Didn’t want to scare the sh!`t out of you.”</p>
<p>“You’re very considerate.”</p>
<p>“Right? I just realized it myself.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun shrugged nonchalantly. His eyes, however, remained fixed on Heeju, making her feel as if she were being stripped bare by his gaze.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit awkward just watching you enjoy yourself.”</p>
<p>Heeju released his wrist and said, “Call me if the wound reopens.”</p>
<p>“Sure, will do.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun replied casually. She had thought he might try to keep her from leaving, so his response was somewhat unexpected. Rising from her chair, Heeju quietly turned away.</p>
<p>Thud, thud, thud, thud.</p>
<p>She took a few steps when from behind, she heard the sound of something thick and fleshy being stroked, like a pillar being rubbed. It was Gukhyun, who had really started m@stu!rba2ti1ng, stroking his erect p3n!s.</p>
<p>Heeju strengthened her trembling knees and tried to walk calmly. Until the door was completely closed, the wet, slapping sounds of Gukhyun’s flesh echoed in her ears.</p>
<p>“How’s the director?:</p>
<p>As soon as she came out of the room, Yunam, who had been waiting in the corridor, approached her and asked.</p>
<p>“How’s the wound?”</p>
<p>“I’ve treated him for now.”</p>
<p>Next to Yunam stood a middle-aged man in a white coat, holding a briefcase. This must be Dr. Hwang, whom he had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>“It would be good to disinfect the sutured area daily for the next few days. Since the doctor is here, may I go upstairs now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you for your hard work.”</p>
<p>Yunam gave Heeju a casual nod before engaging in conversation with Dr. Hwang. Heeju took a few steps, then paused to let out a long sigh. She turned back and said,</p>
<p>“It might be better to go in after a few minutes. Five or ten minutes, maybe.”</p>
<p>Yunam, who was leading Dr. Hwang towards the room, looked slightly puzzled. He couldn’t understand what Heeju was saying.</p>
<p>However, she had no intention of providing a more detailed or courteous explanation. Feeling she had done enough, Heeju resumed walking.</p>
<p>She wished she could teleport to her room.</p>
<p>Her feet dragged heavily across the floor, feeling as if they weighed a thousand pounds. As she dragged her weary body down the corridor and up the stairs, her vision suddenly spun, and her knees buckled.</p>
<p>Uh… what’s happening?</p>
<p>In her sluggish thoughts, Heeju reached out to grab the railing. Or at least, she tried to, but unfortunately, she couldn’t. Perhaps it was commendable that she had managed to hold on this long with her poor stamina.</p>
<p>Thud.</p>
<p>At the sound of Heeju collapsing to the floor, Yunam turned around in the corridor.</p>
<p>“Ko Heeju?”</p>
<p>With that voice as the last thing she heard, the thread of her consciousness snapped, and her vision went completely black.</p>
