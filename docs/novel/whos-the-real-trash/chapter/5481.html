            <p><strong>Chapter 9.1</strong></p>
<p>Sungang clicked his tongue and gestured toward the living room.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you sit down and rest?”</p>
<p>Her knees were trembling. Honestly, it was tempting. But the living room sofa wasn’t empty. She could see the back of someone’s head sticking up from it. Heeju shook her head.</p>
<p>“…No, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Then follow me.”</p>
<p>Sungang stood in front of a door.</p>
<p>“Since we mostly use our bodies, people always complain about aches and pains, so we call in a physical therapist. Some go directly to the center, but usually, we have them come here. I think your sister, Ko Heejin, started coming around early last year.”</p>
<p>She remembered her sister mentioning weekend appointments occasionally.</p>
<p>“She looked frail, but surprisingly, she had strong hands and good skills. I got treatments from her sometimes, but others saw her regularly. She probably said she needed money during one of those sessions.”</p>
<p>Sungang shrugged.</p>
<p>“There’s a logbook inside. It should tell you who her regular clients were. Honestly, I don’t get why you’re so curious now that she’s gone, but don’t take it the wrong way, okay?”</p>
<p>Heeju silently stared at the doorknob. She wasn’t offended. In fact, she found herself agreeing with Sungang.</p>
<p>What are you curious about, Ko Heeju? Do you want to prove that your sister didn’t die because of you? Are you hoping there was another reason?</p>
<p>“It can be frustrating when your only family leaves you with nothing but debt overnight.”</p>
<p>Sungang swung the door open.</p>
<p>“What the…”</p>
<p>The room, which he thought was empty, was already occupied. A man lying face down on a massage table looked up with a frown at the sudden intrusion. The physical therapist, who had been working on his shoulders, also straightened up in surprise.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know how to knock? What the hell?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re here? If you’re using the room, lock the door.”</p>
<p>“Why would I lock the door? Unbelievable.”</p>
<p>The man brushed the hair from his forehead and propped himself up halfway. His chest was adorned with a tattoo of a crucified Jesus.</p>
<p>“Who’s behind you?”</p>
<p>His sharp eyes turned to Heeju.</p>
<p>“She’s Gukhyun’s new personal doctor.”</p>
<p>Sungang introduced Heeju, pulling her forward by the arm. She was unexpectedly introduced to a man in drawers, with a Jesus tattoo on his chest and a weasel on his back, named Chulhyun.</p>
<p>“What about Dr. Hwang?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of paying him a visit soon to show some respect for the elderly.”</p>
<p>Grinding his teeth in frustration, Sungang seemed visibly irritated. Chulhyun nodded indifferently and gestured towards Heeju.</p>
<p>“She looks a bit young to be a personal doctor. How old are you?”</p>
<p>“That’s none of your business, Chulhyun. When will you be done?” Sungang interfered.</p>
<p>“I just started. But have we met before? Your face looks familiar.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sh!`t. That line is so f-ck`i!ng lame.”</p>
<p>Sungang clicked his tongue harshly and turned away.</p>
<p>“Hey, kid, we’ll have to come back later. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a line…”</p>
<p>Chulhyun tilted his head, staring intently at Heeju, his eyes narrowing as if trying to recall something.</p>
<p>“The physical therapist who used to come here is my sister, Ko Heejin. Do you know her?”</p>
<p>At Heeju’s words, Chulhyun finally seemed to remember, letting out a long sigh and said, “Oh, the previous physical therapist…”</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>For a brief moment, Heeju felt a strange sense of alienation. She glanced back and forth between Chulhyun and Sungang, but their faces had already returned to neutral expressions.</p>
<p>“Yes, I remember pretty women. But the sister is even prettier. Both of you are beauties.”</p>
<p>“Enough. Just lie back down, you massage addict.”</p>
<p>Sungang pressed down on Chulhyun’s head with his large hand, making him lie back on the bed.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. We need to sign the contract. The lawyer has arrived.”</p>
<p>As Sungang led Heeju out, she glanced back. Chulhyun was already lying on the bed, pointing to his shoulder for the physical therapist. The therapist in the light blue uniform nodded and began pressing Chulhyun’s shoulder with his elbow.</p>
<p>“Next time.”</p>
<p>Sungang shut the door with a click, and Chulhyun and the therapist disappeared behind it.</p>
<p>“I’ll bring you back here when the place is empty.”</p>
<p>When the place is empty…</p>
<p>Heeju quietly walked, mulling over Sungang’s words. She couldn’t pinpoint the source of her uneasy feeling.</p>
