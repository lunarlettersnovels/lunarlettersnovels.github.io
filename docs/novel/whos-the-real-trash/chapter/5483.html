            <p><strong>Chapter 8.1</strong></p>
<p>“Gang-ah, do you want an omelette?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m good. I’ll eat later when I go to the headquarters. For now, I’ll just keep an eye on her.”</p>
<p>Although Sungang knew the housekeeper couldn’t see, he still pointed at Heeju with his finger as if to emphasize his words. After the housekeeper left for the kitchen, he leaned back and stared at Heeju again.</p>
<p>“But what makes you think you can act like that?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you. You said you didn’t sleep with our hyung.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Heeju looked down, her eyes fixed on the rice in her bowl. She was counting the grains one by one in her mind.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you this because I feel sorry for you, but you’re not good at reading the room. From now on, you should be more humble. Gukhyun doesn’t like arrogant people.”</p>
<p>“Is he going to kill me?”</p>
<p>“Maybe after you’ve paid off your debt.”</p>
<p>“That’s the best news I’ve heard all day.</p>
<p>“Haha. This kid is cute…” Sungang smirked, making the scar that ran diagonally across his otherwise handsome face twitch.</p>
<p>“I was wondering why the boss was letting you off. Honestly, it was f!1ck`ng weird.”</p>
<p>Sungang rubbed the end of his scar with his fingertips, staring at Heeju.</p>
<p>“It was really, really weird because he’s never done this before…”</p>
<p>Every time he moved his hand, the snake tattoo on his forearm flexed. His eyes, filled with a mix of interest, confusion, and curiosity, scrutinized Heeju. Then, as if he had finally understood, he smiled, his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>“You’re pretty. Your life must have sucked.”</p>
<p>“…I it’s f1ckk!in.g bad.”</p>
<p>“How can a girl say the f-word? D@!mn, I can’t say anything in front of a kid. You want me to watch my mouth?”</p>
<p>“Do as you please.”</p>
<p>“But you’re only twenty-six, and you graduated from medical school and became a forensic pathologist? You must have worked really hard. Most people your age are just finishing med school, right?”</p>
<p>Yes. If I had known everything would fall apart like this, I might have lived more carelessly.</p>
<p>The memories of her past struggles to live as normally as possible flashed through Heeju’s mind like a lantern.</p>
<p>After losing her parents in a car accident on the same day, Heeju and her sister Heejin were sent to an orphanage. Life was not easy for the young sisters. Despite being a child who had suddenly lost her parents, Heejin did everything she could to protect Heeju.</p>
<p>For her sister, Heeju thought the only thing she could do was study. A series of events at the orphanage strengthened this resolve, and Heeju dropped out of middle school at sixteen to take the GED. She studied relentlessly and entered medical school within two years. Although she had always been considered a prodigy, she studied as if her life depended on it.</p>
<p>After graduating from medical school, completing her internship, and becoming a resident in forensic medicine, her sister was the compass guiding her life. When choosing her specialty, Heeju initially considered lucrative fields, but her sister advised her to pursue what she truly wanted to do rather than just chase money.</p>
<p>What do I really want to do?</p>
<p>That was the first question she had ever asked herself.</p>
<p>Her sister probably knew. Every time there was a dissection practice, Heeju would come back with a flushed face and repeatedly watch the professor’s videos.</p>
<p>So, following her heart, she chose forensic medicine, the poorest department in medical school. It wasn’t an easy path, but she had hope that things would get better.</p>
<p>Looking back now, it might have all been a delusion.</p>
<p>“You must have heard a lot that you look like your sister.”</p>
<p>Heeju looked up at Sungang. He was now standing with his arms crossed, smiling. The smile softened his otherwise rough appearance.</p>
<p>“Do you know my sister well?”</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Ko Heejin wouldn’t have liked you. She hated thugs.”</p>
<p>Sungang burst into laughter at Heeju’s response.</p>
<p>“Wow, calling me a thug to my face…”</p>
<p>He found it so amusing that tears formed in his eyes. He wiped them away with his finger and gestured to the bowl.</p>
<p>“Eat. It’s probably cold by now.”</p>
