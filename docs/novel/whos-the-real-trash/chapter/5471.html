            <p><strong>Chapter 14.1</strong></p>
<p>Heeju turned to Yeongshin and asked.</p>
<p>“How do you  know that?”</p>
<p>“I heard it from my father.”</p>
<p>Yeongshin’s father was a professor at the Korea University Medical School’s Department of Forensic Medicine and the director of the Forensic Science Research Institute.</p>
<p>“He’s been obsessed with getting some investment for the research institute, and he’s really going crazy about it. Whether it’s black money or noble money, what’s the difference? We’re in a tight spot right now.”</p>
<p>The research institute, which was the poorest department in the medical school, was barely running due to the heavy workload and lack of personnel. It was only sustained by a thin veil of pride and sense of duty.</p>
<p>In a society where the number of medical students specializing in pathology or forensic medicine was rapidly approaching zero, Kim Seokjin, Yeongshin’s father, was one of the people who were working tirelessly to keep the field of forensic medicine alive.</p>
<p>Yeongshin often took a sarcastic tone when talking about his father, but in reality, he tended to express the opposite of what he meant.</p>
<p>“They’re all about image management, too. ‘We’re not a gangster company anymore, we’re a socially responsible company that makes a lot of donations,’ and so on.”</p>
<p>Yeongshin glanced around briefly and leaned in close to Heeju’s ear. His voice had become calmer.</p>
<p>“So what’s the point? Rumor has it that he’s still active behind the scenes. If he’d made it to where he is now, he could have delegated the dirty work to his underlings by now, but he still gets his hands dirty, peels off skin, and cuts off fingers to deliver.”</p>
<p><em>It’s probably not just a rumor.</em></p>
<p>Heeju thought to herself. Just a week ago, the person whose stomach was cut open and bleeding profusely was smiling like a normal person, but now Kwon Gukhyun was smiling like a perfectly healthy businessman.</p>
<p>Below the stage, a figure with glasses appeared in the shadows. He was holding a phone to his ear and in the middle of a conversation.</p>
<p>“Look. Even though he’s smiling like a nice person, there’s venom in his eyes. In this world, people who wear suits and make donations are treated with respect and gratitude, even if they’re the ones who committed crimes in court.”</p>
<p>Yeongshin, who had been grumbling with his mouth full, suddenly stopped talking and swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“Why does it seem like he’s looking this way?”</p>
<p>Just like Yeongshin said, Kwon Gukhyun on the stage was indeed looking in this direction. His characteristic relaxed expression didn’t change, making it unclear whether it was just a coincidence or if he really saw them.</p>
<p>However, given the distance and the fact that they were lost in the crowd, it was difficult to spot them. Unlike Heeju, who thought it was just her imagination, Yeongshin looked visibly flustered.</p>
<p>“Hey, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Yeongshin quickly grabbed Heeju’s wrist and pulled her along, hastily moving away from their spot.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you scared? Did he hear you insulting him?”</p>
<p>Heeju laughed, finding it amusing that Yeongshin was sweating bullets.</p>
<p>“What’s there to be scared of? It’s not like I made it up.”</p>
<p>Heeju’s wrist was also sweaty, and she laughed. Then, she helplessly followed Yeongshin as he led her away.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Forensic Science Research Institute was quiet. As a rule, forensic pathologists often have frequent fieldwork and take external lectures to earn a living, so it wasn’t common for them to come to the institute every day.</p>
<p>It was a bit different from the usual situation, but at one point, Heeju was paid per case, similar to a freelancer, and lived in the autopsy room all day without a care in the world.</p>
<p>From a trainee’s perspective, it was quite an exceptional treatment. The autopsy requests were pouring in, but the available personnel were extremely scarce, and it was thanks to the director’s consideration that they were able to manage.</p>
<p>“Dr. Kim is so popular now that it’s hard to even see his face. His schedule is almost as busy as a celebrity’s, right? Have you seen him? He’s on every show these days.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I haven’t, but I’m glad he’s doing well. He always wanted to get his name out there.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. So now the director of the research institute is fawning all over him, saying he’s raised the profile of forensic medicinea nd she’s always sucking up to him. But does that mean the medical students will even take an interest in this field? It’s heartbreaking to watch him chasing after a dream in vain. His dedication is admirable, but it’s just a waste of time.”</p>
<p>Heeju was sitting in Yeongshin’s lab, catching up with her colleagues after finishing the material they had agreed to watch together when the lab door flung open.</p>
<p>“Ah, why didn’t you two answer your phones?”</p>
<p>The research assistant, who worked under Director Kim Seokjin, rushed in, his back bent and his breath coming in ragged gasps.</p>
<p>“The director wants to see you urgently.”</p>
<p>“The director? Ah, that guy again, why.”</p>
