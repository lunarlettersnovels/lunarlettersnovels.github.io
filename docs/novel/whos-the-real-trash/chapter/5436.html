            <p><strong>Chapter 31.2</strong></p>
<p>“What do you want to watch? What genre do you like?”</p>
<p>He had said he wanted to watch a wholesome movie, so why was he opening the section for 19+ er0-t1c films?</p>
<p>“I like action movies. The good guys beating up the bad guys.”</p>
<p>“Is that your taste? Action movies aren’t bad. Go ahead and pick one.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun leaned back against the pillow and casually tossed the remote control to Heeju. Heeju, caught off guard, took the remote control and asked.</p>
<p>“But aren’t you going to work? It’s not the weekend.”</p>
<p>“I’m sick, and you want me to go to work?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun pointed to his shoulder, which was wrapped in bandages.</p>
<p>“That’s a bit harsh.”</p>
<p>“You seem fine since you’re moving around so well.”</p>
<p>“Touch my forehead. I think I have a fever.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you. You’re lying without even wetting your lips…”</p>
<p>“If I pass out, can you give me mouth-to-mouth?”</p>
<p>What was with all this talk about mouth-to-mouth? Heeju pretended not to hear anything and pressed the remote control as she calmly looked at the screen. She selected the movie that looked the most wholesome from the list of new releases.</p>
<p>“Uh? Hyu- Hyung-nim!”</p>
<p>Only then did Sungang suddenly turn around, and took off his headset in surprise. At the same moment, a character navigating through a dark warehouse on the screen was shot and fell to the floor.</p>
<p>“When did you arrive?”</p>
<p>“Just a while ago.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun replied nonchalantly. He raised his arms and rested his hands behind his head.</p>
<p>“We’re going to watch a movie. Do you want to join us, Gang-ah?”</p>
<p>Sungang, who had awkwardly approached the bed, glanced at Heeju. Then, scratching his head with an awkward expression, he replied.</p>
<p>“No. I was just about to head out for something.”</p>
<p>There were bruises and scratches on Sungang’s face that she hadn’t noticed before. The wounds were shiny from the ointment smeared all over them.</p>
<p>“Here, put this on.”</p>
<p>Heeju handed Sungang the band-aid she had in her pocket.</p>
<p>“Ah, uh, thanks.”</p>
<p>Sungang took the band-aid and bowed slightly toward Gukhyun.</p>
<p>“I’ll be going now, Hyung-nim. Enjoy the movie.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just his face that was injured; Sungang was also limping slightly. As Heeju watched his back as he left through the door, she suddenly felt a heaviness in her thighs. It was because Gukhyun was lying with his head resting on her thigh.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“So kind. Do you like Gang-ah?”</p>
<p>“I’m kind when I treat the Executive Director’s injuries too.”</p>
<p>“True. I heard you turned pale and cried when I collapsed yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Me? Who said that?”</p>
<p>“Yunam did.”</p>
<p>Heeju let out a hollow laugh, incredulous.</p>
<p>“Don’t lie. What kind of man lies as soon as he opens his mouth…?”</p>
<p>“I thought you only cried prettily when you were getting f*!cked, but it seems like you have a lot of tears. Were you that sad?”</p>
<p>“What, nonsense… Get off me. You’re heavy.”</p>
<p>Heeju pushed with all her might to try to shove Gukhyun’s head away. However, he stubbornly held his ground, arms crossed tightly. She couldn’t overpower him at all.</p>
<p>Gukhyun kept his eyes closed, resting his head on Heeju’s thigh, and murmured.</p>
<p>“Just stay like this a little longer. It’s been throbbing like f*ck since earlier. This seems to help a little.”</p>
<p>“…Really? Let me take a look.”</p>
<p>Heeju paused for a moment, gave up on pushing Gukhyun away and placed her palm on his forehead. Gukhyun smiled as if he felt good, rubbing his forehead against her hand. She thought he was just being dramatic, but his forehead felt warm and he seemed like he really had a slight fever.</p>
<p>“I think we should get a thermometer and check properly. You also need to take your morning medication.”</p>
<p>As Heeju tried to get up from the bed, Gukhyun grabbed her wrist and pulled her back down.</p>
<p>“Just stay. I won’t die from this.”</p>
<p>If he knew how many people die from tetanus each year, he wouldn’t be so carefree. Heeju quietly looked down at the man lying on her thigh.</p>
<p>He exhaled lazily, like a satisfied beast after a hearty meal. Gukhyun’s smiling lips were red and luscious. Although the movie was playing on the screen, the dialogue barely registered in her ears.</p>
