            <p><strong>Chapter 32.2</strong></p>
<p><em>I don’t know if I became a p#rve2rt because of this man, or if I was a p#rve2rt from the start.</em></p>
<p>“What kind of body is this that even your b.utth!0le is pink, ah?”</p>
<p>While Gukhyun was talking coarsely, he buried his head between Heeju’s legs like a dog.</p>
<p>“Haa, sh!*t… smells so fu!ck1ng good.”</p>
<p>He pressed his entire lips against her wet folds while mumbling. His low voice resonated through her skin, and a shiver ran through her body.</p>
<p>Heeju unconsciously reached out and grabbed Gukhyun’s hair. It was at that moment that a hot, thick tongue probed inside her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The refrigerator door swung open. Sungang grabbed a 1.5L bottle of water and started chugging it.</p>
<p>“W!t.f, Sungang! Are you going to keep drinking straight from the bottle without using a cup? That’s so f*c!k1ng disgusting.”</p>
<p>Chulhyun, who strolled from behind, glared at Sungang with annoyance. Sungang just wiped the water that dripped down his chin with the back of his hand and shot back confidently.</p>
<p>“Why does it matter if I’m going to drink it all at once anyway?”</p>
<p>“What are you, a water-drinking hippo?”</p>
<p>Chulhyun shook his head disapprovingly as he walked past Sungang and headed to the kitchen. He took out some bread from the pantry, popped it into the toaster, and set a cup under the coffee machine before pressing the button. <strong><em>Whiiiir.</em></strong> The coffee started brewing.</p>
<p>As he approached the fridge to grab some jam and butter, he paused. Sungang had switched the fridge display to mirror mode and was seriously looking at his reflection while putting on a band-aid.</p>
<p>“Did you get hurt a lot yesterday?”</p>
<p>Chulhyun’s words made Sungkang look back at him. He was pretty good-looking at a glance, but with the long scar running from his forehead to his cheek, and today’s bruises and band-aids, his face screamed ‘I’m a fist-wielding bastard’ to anyone who would look.</p>
<p>“No? Compared to the kids I crushed, this is just cute.”</p>
<p>Sungang rubbed his chin and acted all cocky.</p>
<p>“They say it was from Kwon Joo-ah, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s pretty obvious. It’s not like it’s the first time.”</p>
<p>“What did Hyung-nim say about it?”</p>
<p>“You know how it is. The chairman’s kids crawl all around him. Oh, but I heard Kwon Giju got hospitalized yesterday. He mustbe fu2ck!ng scared. If you’re going to act tough, at least do it right. What an idiot.”</p>
<p>“Did they treat him properly?’</p>
<p>“You can’t treat it with this sh!`t. It’s just a band-aid, and it’ll be gone tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Sungang gulped down more water. His prominent adam’s apple bobbed up and down like crazy.</p>
<p>When Chulhyun took out the jam and butter from the fridge and turned around, he saw Sungang just putting the empty water bottle down on the table with a thud.</p>
<p>“Wow, you really drank all that. You little hippo.”</p>
<p>“…Hey, Chulhyun-ah.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Chulhyun replied nonchalantly while placing the toast that popped up from the toaster onto a plate.</p>
<p>“Ko Heeju. Gukhyun’s new doctor.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. What about Ko Heeju?”</p>
<p>“She’s f2ck!n1g obsessed with her dead sister. Should we tell her what we know?”</p>
<p>Chulhyun’s hand, which was spreading butter on the toast, suddenly froze. Holding the knife, he stared coldly at the wall before turning to Sungang. Then he grinned and said.</p>
<p>“I wonder what made our Gang-ah think of such a stupid idea all of the sudden.”</p>
<p>“I just feel sorry for the kid. Seeing her still go in and out of the physical therapy room. She wants to know something.”</p>
<p>Sungang rubbed the band-aid on his cheek as he spoke.</p>
<p>“You and I have called Ko Heejin here the most for work, it’s so obvious from the work log. If we keep pretending we don’t know anything, she’s going to be suspicious. She’s not an idiot.”</p>
<p>“If she starts to suspect something, so what? What’s the difference?”</p>
<p>Chulhyun turned back around and finished spreading butter on the toast.</p>
<p>“Let her suspect all she wants.”</p>
<p>After spreading a thick layer of strawberry jam over the thinly spread butter, Chulhyun took a big bite of the toast.</p>
<p>“It’s better not to know.”</p>
<p>As Chulhyun mumbled with his mouth full, his eyes narrowed. Then he looked closely at Sungang’s face and grinned.</p>
<p>“But why did you suddenly feel sorry for her…?”</p>
