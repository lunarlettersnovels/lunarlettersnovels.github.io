            <p><strong>Chapter 1.2</strong></p>
<p>Even when she first saw him, she noticed how overly handsome he was. His long eyes were deep and languid, while his prominent brow and nose were so beautifully formed that it would be difficult to sculpt them intentionally.</p>
<p>In truth, it was hardly an appropriate situation to leisurely admire the man’s face, yet her gaze was drawn to his striking looks as if entranced.</p>
<p>He had an aura around him that made her stomach knot, almost as if he was radiating testosterone throughout his entire body. It was a type of presence Heeju had never encountered before.</p>
<p>Among his sharply defined features, the epitome of masculinity was his chiseled jawline. And on that smooth jaw was a distinct bloodstain, the origin of which was unknown.</p>
<p>That wasn’t all. The shirt clinging to his broad torso was so thoroughly soaked in dark red blood that its original color was unrecognizable.</p>
<p>…Just a scratch?</p>
<p>The blood-soaked man brought the whiskey bottle to his lips, taking a swig, and then poured the liquor generously over the unsually darkened spot. The rich scent of whiskey spread, masking the metallic smell of blood that lingered in the air.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with her?”</p>
<p>The man’s eyebrows raised slightly as he looked down at Heeju. With the long tear in his shirt on the left side of his abdomen and the bloodstains spreading everywhere, it seemed like he had been stabbed. Although, for someone with a hole in his stomach, he looked surprisingly fine.</p>
<p>“She looks worse than when I found her wandering alone.”</p>
<p>Who’s talking about whose condition now? Heeju felt a moment of absurdity at the man’s attitude, who spoke as if nothing was wrong despite being covered in blood. Yunam glanced sideways at Heeju and then lowered his head.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’ll pay more attention.”</p>
<p>“There are a few logs lying around at the construction site. Send the guys to clean them up. From now on, I’m going to play with her, so don’t disturb us.”</p>
<p>At the man’s words, Yunam and the other men bowed without a word and quickly left. The room, now left with just the two of them, was enveloped in a cold silence.</p>
<p>The man, who had carelessly set down an empty whiskey bottle, walked over and suddenly crouched in front of Heeju.</p>
<p>“You’re a doctor, right?”</p>
<p>The man’s eyes, which seemed deep at first, looked fierce like a viper up close. Heeju blinked slowly and replied.</p>
<p>“I’m not a doctor, I’m a forensic pathologist.”</p>
<p>Technically, she was both a doctor and a forensic pathologist, but she had no intention of explaining that kindly. The man met Heeju’s gaze and smiled slightly.</p>
<p>“Good thing I picked you up.”</p>
<p>It was an ominously seductive smile.</p>
<p>“I’ve quit now, as you know. And you didn’t pick me up; you dragged me here.”</p>
<p>“I saved you when you were on the brink of death, and now you look at me with cocky eyes. You should be saying, ‘Thanks for saving me, I’ll repay your kindness.'”</p>
<p>The man grabbed Heeju’s chin and lifted it. He slowly turned her face from side to side, scrutinizing it closely before suddenly letting go. Her jaw throbbed where it had been twisted sideways. A red handprint had already formed where the man had gripped.</p>
<p>“I’m letting it slide because you’re pretty, baby.”</p>
<p>Heeju raised her calm eyes.</p>
<p>“You must have something to gain.”</p>
<p>“If I was just going to take what I wanted, I wouldn’t be acting so sweet, would I?”</p>
<p>Despite his words, his demeanor was far from kind, but the man shamelessly shrugged with a faint smile. He didn’t even seem to be in pain from his pierced stomach, making him hardly look like a patient.</p>
<p>“If you’re a forensic pathologist and not just a doctor, so you’re good at cutting and stitching. Are you good at sewing?”</p>
<p>Understanding the man’s implication, Heeju responded.</p>
<p>“I specialize in corpses.”</p>
<p>“We’ll get along well then. I like corpses too.”</p>
<p>It does look that way, Heeju thought to herself. The man, satisfied, curled his lips into a smile and slipped his hands under Heeju’s arms, lifting her up from her crouched position. Her exhausted body had no strength to resist and was lifted like a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The man’s scent, mixed with the smell of blood, filled her nostrils. It was a deep, heavy scent with a strangely sweet undertone that made her head spin. Heeju instinctively held her breath and frowned.</p>
<p>The man gently played with Heeju’s fingertips and spoke arrogantly.</p>
<p>“Let’s see how good these hands are.”</p>
