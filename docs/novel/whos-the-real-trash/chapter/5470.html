            <p><strong>Chapter 14.2</strong></p>
<p>Yeongshin stood up, looking annoyed, but the research assistant was looking at Heeju and said.</p>
<p>“It’s not Dr. Kim, but Dr. Ko. Dr. Ko, the director is calling for you now.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>Heeju asked, looking flustered. The research assistant didn’t have time to explain and simply grabbed Heeju and took her away.</p>
<p>“What the hell is that? What’s the fuss about? That guy didn’t even know Heeju was here today, so how did he…?”</p>
<p>Yeongshin followed Heeju up to the second floor.</p>
<p>“Doctor Ko, just wait. If something strange happens, I’ll talk to them.”</p>
<p>Before the research assistant could even try to stop him, Yeongshin burst into the reception room, taking a bold step inside. But he froze like a statue. On the sofa in the reception room, a completely unexpected person was sitting face to face with the research director.</p>
<p>“What a generous donation to our research institute! Director, I’m not sure how to express my gratitud.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. It’s a company decision, and I’m just here to deliver the message.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun set his teacup down on the table with a clink. Yeongshin looked flustered and said:</p>
<p>“Ah… I didn’t know there was a guest inside, I’m sorry. Director, you called us, right…?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t ask for Doctor Kim. I’m sorry, Director. Doctor Ko, please come inside.”</p>
<p>The research director scowled at Yeongshin, who had burst in without knocking, and then nodded at Heeju.</p>
<p>“Come in, Dr. Ko.  I heard that you and Director Kwon are well acquainted. He’s agreed to make a large donation to our research institute from the Jungdo Construction company this time.”</p>
<p>Yeongshin was shocked by the unexpected words and stiffened. The assistant quietly led Yeongshin out of the room.</p>
<p>“You’ve come all this way to deliver the news in person, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>Heeju shot a questioning glance at Gukhyun, but he simply crossed his legs and sat with a smug expression, his lips stretched out in a long, languid line. He sat on the sofa with his back against the cushions as if he were the owner of this place despite being a guest.</p>
<p>“When I heard that Dr. Ko was coming to work, I thought it would be a good opportunity to introduce you to our research institute and give you a little tour.”</p>
<p>“Coming to work…? No, Director.”</p>
<p>“You know we’re always waiting for Dr. Ko to return.”</p>
<p>The research director looked at Gukhyun’s expression and said this.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know that the number of formally registered forensic pathologists in the country is less than 100?”</p>
<p>“Is that so? That’s less than I thought.”</p>
<p>“Excluding those like me who are about to retire, the number is even smaller. We have to handle over 10,000 autopsies every year, after all. Each one is precious. Especially someone like Dr. Ko, who has a bright future ahead of her, is even more so.”</p>
<p>The director took out a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his forehead with it. Even though the temperature in the reception room wasn’t high, the director’s forehead was sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Heeju remembered Yeongshin’s words, that his father had told him about Kwon Gukhyun. The director’s hands, which had been suppressing fear and tension, were trembling slightly.</p>
<p>Gukhyun looked at the director’s hand and smiled wryly. It was a bright and cheerful smile, the kind that made you wonder who would think of calling someone like that a gangster.</p>
<p>“Your management philosophy is excellent. It’s not easy to achieve something like that in a company, you know.”</p>
<p>“This year’s donation from Jungdo Construction  will go toward keeping the esearch institute and forensics department alive and well.”</p>
<p>“That’s a great cause. We’ll also do our best to promote it.”</p>
<p>“Well, you two are welcome to stay and talk, but unfortunately, I have to head out of town, so I’ll have to leave first.”</p>
<p>The director propped his hands on his knees and slowly got up from his seat.</p>
<p>“Our forensic pathologists are always on the road and we don’t get many visitors, so our reception room is small and simple. I’m sorry, but if you need anything, please don’t hesitate to let me know. Our assistant will help you.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough. The tea has a nice chrysanthemum scent, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun said, holding the teacup to his lips. The director left the reception room, leaving a hint of a request to Heeju. The sound of the door closing echoed through the room, and suddenly the two were alone.</p>
<p>Gukhyun pointed to the chair next to him with his chin.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Come and sit down.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I don’t like other people looking down on me.”</p>
<p>Even though he was sitting, he had a posture that made it seem like he was looking down on people, and yet he was saying something like that.</p>
