            <p><strong>Chapter 18.1</strong></p>
<p>Heeju’s hips jerked. Her thighs instinctively tried to close, but with the man’s head between her legs, there was no escape. Gukhyun pushed his tongue into her tight opening.</p>
<p>“Ha euk…”</p>
<p>Her lower back arched upward. His large hands gripped her trembling waist, holding her at the perfect angle for him to s*ck.</p>
<p>Every time he probed her opening with his tongue and pressed hard against her cl.1t0r!s, her entr@nC.e contracted violently, releasing more flu!ds. <em>Slurp, suck, schlick</em> – the vulgar and l3w.d sounds continuously echoed, intensifying their s*3xu@al excitement.</p>
<p>Was it due to the tension from the location, or the awareness that they were doing something insane? Her climax approached ridiculously fast.</p>
<p>Heeju twisted her pelvis. Her toes curled tightly and her entire body tingled.</p>
<p>“Nng, ah, ahng, this, this is weird. S-stop… Ahng!”</p>
<p>“Mm. That’s exactly what I’m going for.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun didn’t back off, instead using his tongue to s*ck her entire v4g!n@ even more strongly. <em>Haah!</em> Now Heeju’s m0!@ns were becoming more like cries of pleasure.</p>
<p>At some point, a rhythmic slapping sound mixed with the l3w.d wet sounds from below. Gukhyun was pleasuring himself while eating her out.</p>
<p>Each time he moved his hand up and down, his firm abs flexed visibly. Clear flu!d splashed from his throbbing gl@ns. Tiny droplets scattered like dew.</p>
<p>The increasingly fast and strong sounds made her breath catch as if choking, and her vision blurred.</p>
<p>“Haahk!”</p>
<p>As Heeju grabbed Gukhyun’s hair and curled her body into a small ball, her flu!ds gushed out like a broken dam. Gukhyun also released at the same time. His s*m3n shot into the air with intense pressure, drawing an arc before splattering down.</p>
<p>When he lifted his face from between her legs, her pooled flu!ds trickled down like urine.</p>
<p>“Do you even know what you’re c*mming from?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun openly stared at her slick, messy v4g!n@ with a long smirk. Regardless of his gaze, Heeju just lay there limply with a dazed expression.</p>
<p>“Haa, haa…”</p>
<p>As she’d felt before, the feeling of being completely exhausted and helplessly sprawled out after getting eaten out felt good. The aftershocks of climax left her body completely limp, and her consciousness drifted aimlessly like a shipwreck abandoned in the middle of the ocean, slowly sinking deeper.</p>
<p>She wanted to close her eyes for just 10 minutes, no, even 5 minutes would do. Heeju’s eyes fluttered shut, drawn by an intense desire to sleep. But then, her body was suddenly pulled halfway down.</p>
<p>“You’ve developed a bad habit.”</p>
<p>As Heeju’s eyes snapped open, something hard and hot pressed against her sensitized flesh.</p>
<p>“It’s troublesome if you pass out after enjoying yourself alone when we haven’t even started. I won’t let it slide this time.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun had already positioned himself between her legs. The head of his m3mb3r, aligned with her entr@nC.e, was covered in white cream from his previous release.</p>
<p>While Heeju’s upper body remained on the autopsy table, her lower half had been pulled down, leaving her bu2tt0c.ks precariously suspended in the air as her thighs were firmly held in his hands. It was a position that seemed to be waiting for his penetration.</p>
<p>Gukhyun adjusted his m3mb3r’s angle, gauging how far he could go. <em>Probably about this far.</em> He lifted her knit top to expose her stomach and placed his hand on her flat belly. Being her first time, it would be better not to go all the way in, but whether he could exercise such restraint was questionable… He wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun asked Heeju as she looked up at him with dazed eyes. Her unfocused brown eyes were clear and transparent like glass marbles.</p>
<p>“You’re going to continue here?”</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>“What about a c0.nd1m?”</p>
<p>“Do I look like I have one?”</p>
<p>“You’re really trash.”</p>
<p>“I hear that a lot.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun replied nonchalantly without batting an eye, as if talking about someone else.</p>
<p>“How did an innocent girl end up with a trash like me? Such terrible luck.”</p>
<p>“Hnn…”</p>
<p>Gukhyun aligned his engorged gl@ns with her entr@nC.e and circled it around. <em>Squelch, squelch</em> – with l3w.d sounds, her stimulated opening twitched, trying to s*ck his tip inside.</p>
<p>“Sorry about taking your first time in such a shabby place.”</p>
<p>He looked up and met Heeju’s gaze. His strange grey eyes were frighteningly dark.</p>
