            <p><strong>Chapter 33.1</strong></p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“Our cute Kang Sungang isn’t the type to feel any universal human emotions like guilt. No way… are you seriously in love?”</p>
<p>“What the hell are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Sungang’s face twisted in anger.</p>
<p>“Seriously, is your brain only wired that way? You’re a Jesus freak, yet you’re the type to chase after women like crazy.”</p>
<p>He crushed an empty water bottle in one hand and threw it at Chulhyun. Chulhyun chuckled and quickly snatched the flying bottle out of the air.</p>
<p>“I’m not chasing after women. I respect their existence.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, go ahead and flap your gums and talk nonsense. If you fell into the sea, your lips would probably just float.”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness. I can’t swim, you know. I have a trauma. If I fell into the sea, I’d be dead right away, but I guess I’d survive thanks to my lips?”</p>
<p>Chulhyun wiped his crumb-covered lips with his fingertips.</p>
<p>“Ugh, d#`mn it. Why should I have a serious conversation with this guy? Sh`!t, I’m out.”</p>
<p>Sungang raised his middle finger and wiggled it in the air as he turned around. Chulhyun stared at Sungang’s back as he left the kitchen and called out to him.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kang Sungang.”</p>
<p>“What do you want, you weasel?”</p>
<p>“Don’t feel sorry for Ko Heeju.”</p>
<p>Sungang slowly came to a stop.</p>
<p>“Hey, just don’t think about her at all.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“You know that she’s Gukhyun hyung-nim’s woman, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know, man.”</p>
<p>Seeing Chulhyun’s suddenly serious expression, Sungang couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly lowering your voice and acting all serious? Are you writing a novel these days? Sounds like some delusional level sh1!t.”</p>
<p>“I was just wondering if our Gang-i was too clueless to realize.”</p>
<p>“Get lost.”</p>
<p>The two exchanged gossip with bright smiles on their faces. After finishing a whole toast, Chulhyun put a new slice of bread into the toaster, and Sungang clicked his tongue as he left the kitchen. Watching him limp out, stomping his foot on the floor, Chulhyun took a slurp of his hot coffee.</p>
<p>“What a cute kid. So d$`mn obvious.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seokchan opened the hospital room door. A middle-aged man leaning on a cane entered the room.</p>
<p>Giju, lying on the bed with one foot in a cast, was groaning in pain. In the chair next to the bed sat a woman in a purple suit, absentmindedly tapping her foot in heels while continuing her phone call, unaware that a guest had arrived.</p>
<p>“Those idiots said they could handle it for sure. They’re only asking for 2 billion when they’re not even that capable? I knew it from the moment they asked for an advance. Just clean up the mess. Don’t contact us for a while. They won’t be able to cling on anyway.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, it’s so f*ck!ng noisy, really! I’m already getting a headache, so if you’re going to talk, do it outside, kay? Ah, Dad!”</p>
<p>Giju, who had been grumbling at the woman, suddenly noticed the guest and his eyes widened. The man with the cane was none other than his father, Kwon Jungman, the chairman of Jungdo Construction.</p>
<p>“Dad, you’re here….”</p>
<p>Giju shot up from the bed, clutching his chest and letting out a painful groan. Jungman clicked his tongue as he looked at Giju’s face, which was bruised and swollen on the cheeks and temples.</p>
<p>“Joo-ah, you’re here too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Dad, please sit here.”</p>
<p>Joo-ah quickly ended her call and stood up to offer her seat to Jungman. He sat down in the chair, resting his cane beside the bed, and gave Giju a disapproving look.</p>
<p>“So, how does it feel to have your old man come to visit you?”</p>
<p>At Jungman’s words, Giju frowned, looking aggrieved.</p>
<p>“Dad, I’m really upset and frustrated; I’m boiling inside. That b@st#r.d Kwon Gukhyun went beyond being blind to everything! Has he finally gone crazy?!”</p>
<p>“Director Kwon.”</p>
<p>Jungman corrected Giju’s title in a calm tone. Giju’s face stiffened and turned red as he reacted to Jungman’s unexpectedly composed attitude.</p>
<p>“…Yes, Director Kwon. That Director Kwon did this to me.”</p>
<p>Giju threw off his hospital gown. The dark bruises on his abdomen looked extremely painful. He shouted loudly as if he was advertising the bruise.</p>
<p>“Don’t you get angry seeing me like this, dad? Your only son got beaten up by that ungrateful mutt, and look at me now! This is insubordination! Just how little do they think of me and you…!”</p>
