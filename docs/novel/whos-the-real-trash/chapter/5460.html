            <p><strong>Chapter 19.2</strong></p>
<p>“We’ve had s<em>x, so it’s not like I should be embarrassed to show you my p</em>$$y. And besides, you’re the as3h,0l3 who came inside me without permission, so you should take responsibility.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun pulled Heeju’s waist close and wrapped his arms around her, grasping one of her thighs with his hand. Her legs spread wide. He looked up at Heeju and chuckled.</p>
<p>“Are you pouting? You’re glaring at me.”</p>
<p>“I’ve always looked like this.”</p>
<p>“No. You look like a f2,ck!ng angel.”</p>
<p>A soft touch brushed over her v@g!na. The hand wiping her thighs with a handkerchief was surprisingly serious. The warmth of his body on her back was comforting, so Heeju leaned her upper body against Gukhyun’s chest and relaxed.</p>
<p>Her eyes fluttered, and her eyelids kept trying to droop. Was it because she was so exhausted? She wondered how other people managed to go about their daily lives after having s*3x. She was too sleepy…</p>
<p>“I think it’s better if I take out what’s inside you.”</p>
<p>A husky voice whispered right next to Heeju’s ear. The fingers probing her v@g!na seemed to be getting more and more l3,wd, and then, a finger slipped inside her h0l3.</p>
<p>“Uh, euh, uhn…”</p>
<p>“You smell so naughty. If I leave you like this, bastard will take you at this rate.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun’s fingers moved in and out of her h0l3, pumping like a piston. Starting with his middle and ring fingers, he eventually added his index finger as well. Three fingers were now inside her, stirring and probing the soft, relaxed interior.</p>
<p>“Ah, ahk, sto-stop, ahhng.”</p>
<p>Heeju’s shoulders hunched as she twisted her waist. Even when she shook her head from side to side and grasped Gukhyun’s wrists with both hands, it was no use. Gukhyun shook his hand violently from side to side, despite Heeju’s hands being attached to his wrists.</p>
<p>“The c*m just keeps coming out, what do you mean stop?”</p>
<p>“It’s weird, huh, I, I don’t like it.”</p>
<p>“A waist as small as a fist, but already swallowed a lot of s3m’n? You’re greedy, aren’t you, doctor?”</p>
<p>She felt like she was losing her mind. She thought she had no strength left, but her abdomen was getting hot again. Her knees were trembling and her spine was tingling.</p>
<p>A cloudy liquid, mixed with s3m’n and fl.u!ds, was flowing out of her h0l3, splashing and dripping everywhere. It wasn’t just wetting Gukhyun’s palm, but also dripping onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Uhn, haaa….”</p>
<p>Gukhyun supported Heeju, who was almost collapsing, and pulled up her knit top and bra all at once. Her white flesh, which had been wrapped in her bra, spilled out.</p>
<p>“Hah, what the h3.ll?”</p>
<p>The man let out a fierce, mocking laugh, as if he was exasperated.</p>
<p>“It’s no wonder you’re tired of living, carrying all this heavy weight. Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>Heeju wanted to retort that it was none of his business, considering he was carrying around something much heavier and more weapon-like in his own gr0!.n, but she couldn’t catch her breath to respond. She was gasping for air, her breath caught in her throat.</p>
<p>“What kind of dirty body is this, that even your n!ppl€s are pink? You’re in big trouble.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun muttered ominously and leaned down to engulf her br3@st in his mouth. The soft flesh was sucked into his mouth.</p>
<p>“Heuu, ahh, hmmf… sto-stop, mmmh!”</p>
<p>He sucked on her br3@st like he was trying to milk it, and at the same time, he was probing her v@g!na with his hand. The firm part of his palm pressed down on her mound, stimulating her, and Heeju’s toes, which had been dangling in the air, curled up tightly.</p>
<p>“Ahh, aah, ah…!”</p>
<p>Tears welled up in her eyes as she reached an unbearable climax. Her consciousness, which had been flickering, seemed to come back and then fade away again, and eventually, it disappeared. Heeju’s body, which had been tense, suddenly lost all its strength and went limp.</p>
<p>Gukhyun, who was used to seeing Heeju collapse anywhere, wasn’t surprised when she went limp in his arms like a corpse. He took the hand that had been probing her v@g!na and grasped his own m3mb-r with it.</p>
<p>As he grasped his m3mb-r, a cloudy s3m’n shot out from the tip of his gl@n.s.</p>
<p>“Huu…”</p>
<p>Gukhyun milked his m3mb-r, squeezing out all the remaining s3m’n, and then, after a moment, he slung Heeju over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Yunam, I’m leaving now.”</p>
<p>After a brief phone call, Gukhyun lifted Heeju up lightly and started walking, with Heeju wrapped in his jacket. At first glance, it looked like she was being kidnapped.</p>
<p>Gukhyun was holding Heeju’s sneakers in one hand, and her feet were dangling in the air, swaying back and forth. The sound of his footsteps echoed through the quiet, long corridor of the underground parking lot.</p>
