            <p><strong>Chapter 7.1</strong></p>
<p>Unable to openly defy Gukhyun, Sungang scratched his temple, looking hesitant.</p>
<p>“Is Dr. Hwang not to your liking? He’s a little cranky with his old age, but his skills are still decent.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Hwang has been following Chairman Kwon around, playing mahjong lately.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun’s casual response made Sungang’s expression immediately turn grim. He ground his teeth, and the scar on his forehead bulged with a blue vein.</p>
<p>“That old fool must have lost his mind in his old age. I’ll take care of it right away, hyung.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for that.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun tightened his tie and approached Sungang, patting his shoulder as if to calm him down.</p>
<p>The difference in their physiques was significant. Even though Sungang was quite large, he was no match for Gukhyun.</p>
<p>“He’s an old man with not much time left. Let him go find a new master peacefully.”</p>
<p>It was evident at a glance that in their ruthless, survival-of-the-fittest world, Kwon Gukhyun effortlessly stood above everyone else, reigning supreme.</p>
<p>Watching the large hand of a man who could easily snap her wrist in two slides into his pants pocket, Heeju fell into her thoughts.</p>
<p>There were plenty of places to borrow money from, so why did KO Heejin make the mistake of turning to this man?</p>
<p>“But hyung.”</p>
<p>“We should respect our elders.”</p>
<p>“But how can we…!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Gang-ah. We have a new family member, and she might think you’re a thug.”</p>
<p>At Gukhyun’s words, Sungang glanced at Heeju. Then, as if trying to suppress his rising anger, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. It was somewhat amusing. Apparently, even a thug didn’t like being called a thug.</p>
<p>“Understood, hyung. Since Attorney Kim is coming today, we can handle it then…”</p>
<p>Even though she hadn’t agreed, it was clear that no one cared about Heeju’s opinion.</p>
<p>“40 million a month?”</p>
<p>Sungang’s eyes widened upon hearing the terms. He thought it was an incredibly generous offer but didn’t make the mistake of saying it out loud. After all, the decision was Gukhyun’s to make.</p>
<p>Adding an opinion was pointless. It wasn’t as if Kwon Gukhyun would ever change his mind, and besides, he wasn’t the kind of man to repeat himself. Sungang, being someone who valued his life, quickly nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“200 hundred million won’t take long.”</p>
<p>Quietly listening to their conversation, Heeju interjected in a low voice.</p>
<p>“I have a condition too.”</p>
<p>A brief silence fell over the room.</p>
<p>Sungang stared at her in disbelief. His scarred face twisted into a scowl, making him look even more menacing.</p>
<p>“Let’s hear it, then.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun approached the sofa and sat down. Crossing his long legs, he leaned back, spreading his arms over the backrest. The tailored shirt he wore stretched taut across his chest, the fabric straining so much it seemed like the buttons might pop off at any moment.</p>
<p>“Sit down. You look like you’re about to collapse. What are you standing there for?”</p>
<p>At Gukhyun’s words, Sungang grabbed Heeju by the arm and plopped her down onto the sofa. Then, he positioned himself like a statue behind Gukhyun.</p>
<p>“Take it easy. You’ll scare her.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung. My apologies.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun pulled a cigarette pack from the inner pocket of his suit. The moment he placed a cigarette between his lips, Sungang was ready with a lighter.</p>
<p>However, Gukhyun, looking irritated, took the lighter himself and lit the cigarette with a deep drag on the filter.</p>
<p>The tip of the cigarette burned red with a hiss. As Gukhyun inhaled deeply, his cheeks hollowed, and the acrid smell of smoke filled the air. Through the swirling smoke, Gukhyun gestured to Heeju.</p>
<p>Speak. His voice seemed to echo in her ears. Heeju looked directly into Gukhyun’s eyes, which shone clearly even through the haze and spoke.</p>
<p>“I need to know where the 200 million won my sister borrowed from you went.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun chuckled with the cigarette still between his lips.</p>
<p>“You’re asking the wrong person. Do you want me to dig her up so you can ask her yourself?”</p>
<p>“My sister was cremated.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. May she rest in peace.”</p>
<p>His playful response made Heeju’s eyes narrow in irritation.</p>
<p>“…It was money she borrowed from you.”</p>
<p>“So? Whether your sister spent the money on booze or on some boy toy, I really couldn’t care less. The only thing I care about is that now you get to pay it back.”</p>
