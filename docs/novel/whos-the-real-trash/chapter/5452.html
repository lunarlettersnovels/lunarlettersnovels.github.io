            <p><strong>Chapter 23.2</strong></p>
<p>“Our Director Yoon has great skills, doesn’t he? I thought I wouldn’t be able to meet you today. How did you bring her?”</p>
<p>“I ran into her by chance inside while bringing the alcohol.”</p>
<p>“I heard Kwon Gukhyun keeps her closely guarded and doesn’t let her out much, but I guess that was just a rumor? Anyway, nice to meet you. I’m Kwon Giju. I’ve grown up with Gukhyun hyung like brothers since we were young.”</p>
<p>Yoon Seokchan also said he was like a brother to Kwon Gukhyun, and Kwon Giju said almost the same thing. When Heeju looked nervous, Seokchan, who was sitting in the opposite chair, added an explanation.</p>
<p>“Giju’s father is Chairman Kwon Jungman of Jungdo Construction. Thanks to Chairman Kwon taking care of Gukhyun and me, we’re living like decent human beings now.”</p>
<p>Something Kim Yeongshin had said in passing flashed through her mind.</p>
<p>“There’s a rumor that the chairman secretly took away a child who had been kicked out of some chaebol family in the past and adopted him, but I don’t know if it’s true. Anyway, they say he uses him like a dog whenever he needs him, but no matter how hard he tries, the company will eventually be handed down to the chairman’s biological child, right?”</p>
<p>Was this the biological child who would inherit Jungdo Construction?</p>
<p>“Oh, but why did you only bring such strong stuff? You should have brought wine or something. I’m taking herbal medicine these days, so I can’t take strong things.</p>
<p>Giju grumbled as he rummaged through the bottles of alcohol that Seokchan had brought. Picking up a green bottle of whiskey among them, he placed a spoon on a glass filled with whiskey and casually put a sugar cube on top of it.</p>
<p>“Doctor, would you like a drink too?”</p>
<p>“No, thank you.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, this is delicious.”</p>
<p>Giju, who had flicked on a lighter, set the sugar on fire. Blue flames flared around the sugar soaked in whiskey.</p>
<p>“Director Yoon, why don’t you go soak in the water too? It’s nice and warm. Are you just going to take care of me and leave?”</p>
<p>At Giju’s words, Seokchan shook his head and tilted the bottle towards his glass.</p>
<p>“No, thanks. If your sister finds out, she’ll flip out.”</p>
<p>“Seriously, our brother-in-law is an incredible mommy’s boy. Are newlyweds always like that?”</p>
<p>“Newlywed, my foot. I’ve been married for a while.”</p>
<p>“Hey, still, we count up to a year as the honeymoon phase. Don’t you think so, Doctor?”</p>
<p>The arrow of conversation suddenly flew towards Heeju. Heeju, who had been sitting like a bump on a log, felt the gazes of the two men fixed on her. After choosing her words carefully in her head for a moment, she spoke in a calm voice.</p>
<p>“Director Yoon brought me here because someone was injured, but it doesn’t seem like it’s a particularly necessary situation. I’ll be going now.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s me. The injured person.”</p>
<p>Kwon Giju downed the cloudy, greenish-yellow liquid in one shot and flopped onto the sunbed.</p>
<p>“Here, my sole.”</p>
<p>Then, he flicked his ankle in a delinquent manner.</p>
<p>“It’s been throbbing and hurting since earlier; I think I cut it pretty deep. Do I have to get stitches, maybe?”</p>
<p>Seokchan sent a look urging Heeju to act. Heeju could roughly understand how the power dynamic between Yoon Seokchan and Kwon Giju was tilted, and she could also get a sense of what kind of personality Kwon Giju, the chairman’s son, had.</p>
<p>Sungang’s words, telling her not to wander around alone, were probably a warning to be careful of situations like this. To warn her like that and then leave without a word himself…</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I told you my name, but we haven’t exchanged introductions, have we? What was the doctor’s name again? I think I heard it before, but I forgot.”</p>
<p>“Ko Heeju.”</p>
<p>Seokchan answered in her place. Heeju and Seokchan’s gazes briefly met.</p>
<p>Heeju didn’t know what kind of work Director Yoon Seokchan did at the company, but she suspected that he was one of the executives who seemed to have a smooth relationship with Kwon Gukhyun on the surface, but was actually in an invisible competition with him.</p>
<p>How else could he be so interested as to accurately remember even the name of Kwon Gukhyun’s new personal doctor?</p>
<p>“Ah, Ko Heeju. Right, that was the name. It’s a pretty name. I thought only her face was pretty.”</p>
<p>“The wound isn’t that deep, so if you just leave it alone, it’ll probably heal on its own.”</p>
<p>Heeju said, glancing at Giju’s sole. This was as far as she could take him. She felt like she had to leave.</p>
<p>Kwon Giju listened to Heeju’s words, or pretended to, wrinkling his nose and sneering. It was clear from the start that the wound on his sole didn’t even hurt.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think Gukhyun hyung was like that, but he’s incredibly sly. Did he pick his personal doctor based on her face?”</p>
