            <p><strong>Chapter 11.2</strong></p>
<p>The palm cradling the back of her head was as large as a pot lid. Was it excessive to feel like he might pull her head down and bury it in his gro0!n at any moment? Heeju stuck out her tongue and lightly licked the slick, wet gl@ns.</p>
<p>Contrary to her expectation that it would taste fishy and disgusting, it had no taste at all. Surprising. Thinking she could do more, Heeju parted her lips and took in as much of the tip as she could.</p>
<p>“Kuht…”</p>
<p>As the wet mucous membrane enveloped the gl@ns, the base of his p3n¡s throbbed roughly. Having seen herself flailing like a fool while he was su2cki!.ng her, she now wanted to see Gukhyun’s face as he got his c*ck sucked.</p>
<p>Heeju awkwardly moved her mouth and looked up. Contrary to her expectation that he would be thoroughly enjoying it, Gukhyun was frowning deeply.</p>
<p>“Take it out.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>When she just stared blankly, Gukhyun frowned and roughly grabbed her arm to pull her up. The p3n¡s popped out of her mouth with a loud sound and bobbed in the air.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Her weak, swaying body was suddenly pulled towards him. In the blink of an eye, Heeju found herself in Guk-hyun’s arms, blinking in confusion. His large hand touched her forehead.</p>
<p>“Are you sick?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You have a fever.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, no?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sick…”</p>
<p>“What the fuck…”</p>
<p>Gukhyun muttered a short curse and supported Heeju’s waist. She had insisted she was fine, but suddenly, like a puppet with its strings cut, she slumped and lost consciousness.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Her limp body was burning up in his arms. The forehead resting powerlessly against his chest was scalding hot. One could only imagine how her constricted mouth must have felt.</p>
<p>It was hot, damp, and soft, maddeningly good, to the point that it was frustrating to have only the tip in and out of her mouth.</p>
<p>He had felt that Heeju’s body was excessively hot from the moment he started sucking her off, thinking it was just the heat from the pleasure. But it was only after he had pushed his c0!ck into her tight mouth that he realized something was off.</p>
<p>Thinking about sucking c*ck in this fvc2ked-up state, she must have lost her mind. Or maybe she wanted to die with a d¡c.k in her mouth.</p>
<p>“Yunam, where are you? You need to come up for a bit.”</p>
<p>After calling Yunam, Gukhyun moved Heeju to the bed. Despite being limp like a corpse, her thin and frail body was astonishingly light in his arms.</p>
<p>Even a straw would be better than this.</p>
<p>“No wonder you keep fainting out of nowhere.”</p>
<p>As he laid her down on the bed with a thud, she made a groaning sound and sluggishly turned to lie on her side. For someone who had just lost consciousness so suddenly, her expression was surprisingly peaceful. The breath that leaked from her slightly parted lips was hot.</p>
<p>Seeing her standing on the balcony, looking as if she could be swept away by the wind, had really pissed him off.</p>
<p>Considering her already weak body, it was more surprising to him that she hadn’t fainted earlier after having her pu2s.sy7 sucked so thoroughly.</p>
<p>Gukhyun placed his hand on Heeju’s forehead. She unconsciously rubbed her forehead against his hand, as if finding its coolness comforting.</p>
<p>“You want to die like this, huh? That’s a bit difficult.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun laid Heeju down straight and propped her head up with a pillow. The air itself felt hot and steamy just from being close to her, probably due to her high body temperature.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, her limp legs were still spread apart, dripping with her juices and trembling slightly. Her pants and u!nd3rwe1.ar were scattered on the floor, having fallen off earlier.</p>
<p>His jaw clenched tightly. Not only his gr0¡n but even his b@lls ached. Gukhyun irritably yanked the blanket and covered Heeju’s body, which was buried in the bed. Just as the blanket settled over her, there was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim, it’s Yunam.”</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>Yunam entered, carrying a tray loaded with various items. After quietly closing the door, he approached Gukhyun, who was sitting on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>“You only needed to bring the medicine. Why did you bring a lot? Are you raising a kid?”</p>
