            <p><strong>Chapter 34.2</strong></p>
<p>“Agh…! Hnng…”</p>
<p>Heeju’s eyes met Gukhyun’s as he lifted his head from between her legs, now soaked with her ar#*sa.l.</p>
<p>“Does it feel good to have your p#s.sy eaten?”</p>
<p>His lips were also glistening with transparent wetness. Gukhyun licked his lips with a blatantly obsc#n3 motion using his bright red tongue.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t taste this for days, thought I was gonna die.”</p>
<p>“Haa, haa… How’s your shoulder?”</p>
<p>Heeju asked him while catching her breath. Gukhyun slowly curved his lips into a smile, still wet with her fl#!ds.</p>
<p>“Such a strong sense of duty. My cute little physician.”</p>
<p>“No symptoms like paralysis or convulsions?”</p>
<p>“If I had those, I’d have come to you sooner, wouldn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Any fever?”</p>
<p>“My c*~ck’s fucking burning right now.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun grabbed his massively e.r3ct m#.mb*r through his pants, kneading it crudely as he spoke with vulgar gusto.</p>
<p>“Wanna touch?”</p>
<p>Since he wasn’t the type to admit his pain honestly, Heeju felt she’d only be reassured by checking the state of Gukhyun’s injury with her own eyes. He treated his body so recklessly that even if an infection had him on the brink of death, he’d probably still charge in for s3.x first, wouldn’t he?</p>
<p>“Show me.”</p>
<p>“Now you’re shamelessly demanding to see it.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun unzipped his pants as if he had no other choice.</p>
<p>“Not there, your shoulder.”</p>
<p>Sitting up, Heeju didn’t even glance at the p#.n!s that sprang free from his loosened pants. Instead, she grabbed his shirt and pulled it off. Gukhyun looked slightly disappointed at first, but as Heeju began unbuttoning his shirt one by one, he started grinning slyly.</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing?”</p>
<p>“‘Cause you’re cute.”</p>
<p>“That’s a first.”</p>
<p>She’d heard plenty of times that she wasn’t cute, enough to make her ears ring.</p>
<p>“If you act cute in front of other guys, it’ll be trouble. Got it, baby?”</p>
<p>“There won’t be any trouble.”</p>
<p>Heeju undid the last button and slipped her hands inside to pull off his shirt. While she examined his wound, Gukhyun slid his hand under her T-shirt and eagerly gr0.p3d her br#@s.ts.</p>
<p>He cupped them from below as if weighing the soft flesh, then gently teased her n^p.p!es until they hardened, only to mischievously tug them outward. He kneaded her bre*s,ts, making them jiggle and sway as if he was kneading dough.</p>
<p>It was quite annoying. Heeju sighed but still closely examined the wound on Gukhyun’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Good thing you have good resilience.”</p>
<p>For a wound stabbed by a nail to be neglected like this and still heal so well already. If no signs of infection appeared after a week, the likelihood of tetanus was significantly reduced. Moreover, the dark bruising around the wound had faded considerably.</p>
<p>“The bruising is almost gone… It’s almost miraculous how fast you heal.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t like Yunam, as blunt and indifferent as Gukhyun, would’ve followed him around applying medicine, so what on earth did he eat to have such incredible recovery? He was a research subject in more ways than one.</p>
<p>A body with muscles more perfectly sculpted than any anatomy chart. Despite being covered in all sorts of grim scars, his physique was as beautiful as a statue meticulously carved by a great artist with all its heart.</p>
<p>“Thanks to someone who refuses to sleep with a guy who’s hurting.”</p>
<p>As he tapped his tightly sculpted abs, pr#.c<em>m trickled along the surface of his thr#bb!ng 3r</em>ct!o.n. Not only that, but his gl@n.s, the size of a baby’s fist, was already smeared with s3m#n from having climaxed once while he was f0ndl.!ng Heeju’s v@g!n.@.</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying you snuck into a sleeping person’s bedroom like a thief and stripped them n^k3d because you’re all healed?”</p>
<p>“You were calling out ‘Director, Director’ in your sleep, looking for me. Missed me that much?”</p>
<p>Stunned by his brazen lie, Heeju let out a short, hollow laugh.</p>
<p>“Who’d believe that nonsense…”</p>
<p>“It’s nonsense, alright. Your p#ss.y was all soft and dry while you slept. If you’d been dreaming of me, you’d already be wet on your own.”</p>
<p>With a smug grin, Gukhyun gently pushed Heeju’s shoulders, laying her back down on the bed.</p>
