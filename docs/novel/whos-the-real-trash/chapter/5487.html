            <p><strong>Chapter 6.1</strong></p>
<p>Common sense had long since left the conversation, so Heeju hadn’t expected a normal reaction. But Gukhyun went a step further, spreading his legs wider as if to prove a point.</p>
<p>“Why do you have such an er3ct!0n every time?”</p>
<p>The response was as if it was obvious.</p>
<p>“It’s morning.”</p>
<p>“…You’re healthy.”</p>
<p>“Thanks to you.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun, with an arrogant smirk, grasped his erect member through his gown. The dark shadow on the gray fabric was both explicit and tantalizing.</p>
<p>It seemed like Heeju’s mind was going crazy. Instead of being repulsed, her breathing quickened as she watched him.</p>
<p>Heeju observed the fabric around his m@n1ho0d, which was gradually darkening. Gukhyun, meanwhile, moved his hand, slowly stroking the fabric.</p>
<p>The gown was soon drenched, and he simply caressed it with his fingers, unlike the rough, skin-slapping motion from yesterday. As if trying to elicit a response from her.</p>
<p>Just as she felt frustrated, Gukhyun asked in a casual tone.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to suck?”</p>
<p>His gaze was intense as he rubbed the tip and looked at Heeju.</p>
<p>“Do doctors have to do that too?”</p>
<p>“Doctors don’t have to do that. But you can’t take your eyes off my p3n!1s.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a wrong statement, and Heeju let out a short sigh. Even at that moment, her head felt like it was going to explode. Her stomach was churning, and she felt like she was going to vomit.</p>
<p>The headache was unbearable, and the fatigue was weighing her down. But then, she had a thought. If she focused on something else, maybe she’d feel better.</p>
<p>“If I get hurt down there, will you, ah, take care of it?”</p>
<p>Instead of responding to the ridiculous joke, Heeju silently reached out her hand. She knew it was a stupid thing to do, but she didn’t care. She pushed aside the gown, revealing his er3ct!0n.</p>
<p>The bright red glans was throbbing, and pre-come was dripping out. The clear liquid that had accumulated in the glans flowed down his length. Heeju’s lips parted slightly.</p>
<p>“Is this your first time seeing it?”</p>
<p>“How could that be? I see it every day.”</p>
<p>Although she said that, she was honestly surprised. To be precise, it was her first time seeing a living man’s p3n!s in person.</p>
<p>In the past, Heeju had built walls around her relationships and worked like a madwoman, so she saw more corpses in the autopsy room than people she met in a day. But that didn’t matter now.</p>
<p>The problem was that Kwon Gukhyun’s manhood was statistically impossible. Was it even humanly possible?</p>
<p>Heeju stared at Gukhyun’s penis with a stunned expression. Until now, she had pretended not to see it, but since it was out in the open, she didn’t need to be polite anymore.</p>
<p>“Do you like it?”</p>
<p>He smeared the prec0m3 on his hand and stroked it down the length of his thick sh@f1t as if to show it off. The man’s smile was sly and seductive.</p>
<p>“…It’s big. Really big.”</p>
<p>The more she looked, the more surprised she was. The p3n!s, which seemed to be enjoying her gaze, was thicker than an adult’s forearm.</p>
<p>“You look like you’re dying to eat it.”</p>
<p>Is that my expression? Heeju touched her cheek with her hand. Her mouth was agape. It wasn’t a hungry expression but rather one of fascination, like when she discovered something new and exciting.</p>
<p>“Do you see how you’re making me squirm? It’s ridiculous. I’m going to c0m3.”</p>
<p>The bright red glans was throbbing, and the liquid was dripping out, as if it was about to spurt out at any moment.</p>
<p>The transparent fluid flowing down his length, coating the engorged surface, was excessively stimulating. Heeju felt dizzy and disoriented.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The menacing ph@llu!s hovered in the air. Gukhyun leaned against the headboard, observing Heeju with a calm, predatory gaze, like a hunter waiting for the perfect moment to strike.</p>
<p>The thought of his come spouting out of the bright red ur3thr@!l opening made her stomach churn. Her mouth felt dry and parched. She felt like she would need to open her mouth wide to take in something that big.</p>
<p>What would it taste like?</p>
<p>The thought crossed her mind, though she was fairly certain it would be disgusting…. Still, as if entranced, Heeju lowered her head.</p>
<p>Just as she opened her mouth wide, ready to take him in—</p>
<p>A firm finger pressed against the center of her forehead, stopping her.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
