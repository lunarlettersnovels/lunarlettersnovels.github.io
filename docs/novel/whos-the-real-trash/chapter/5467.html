            <p><strong>Chapter 16.1</strong></p>
<p>As a forensic pathologist, it was common to receive threats or resentment from others. Performing autopsies on up to five bodies a day and mechanically producing autopsy reports was routine for Heeju, but these reports could be her salvation or downfall.</p>
<p>The tragedy began a year ago when she solved a case that could have remained unsolved. A suspect had been identified thanks to the tiny trace of DNA found on the body of a r@p3 and mu.r2d3r victim—a case that had been passed to Heeju after the National Forensic Service failed to find any clues.</p>
<p>It was strong enough evidence to warrant immediate arrest, but due to the suspect’s alibi and powerful backing, the investigation proceeded without detention.</p>
<p>Though he avoided immediate arrest, the perpetrator, sensing he couldn’t escape prison once the trial began, unexpectedly directed his resentment toward Heeju. He believed she had put him in trouble by revealing the evidence.</p>
<p>Up to that point, it might have been just another ordinary day in Heeju’s life. She believed that until the moment that dark malice reached out and strangled her throat.</p>
<p>“Unni, I think I’m going to be late. Should we just meet next time?”</p>
<p>– No, I already left. Besides, what’s the point of meeting later when it’s your birthday? I was planning to sleep over there anyway. I’ll wait at home, so take your time. Don’t rush.</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll order chicken for you, so eat first.”</p>
<p>– What chicken? We’ll eat together when you come, why would I eat alone?</p>
<p>“I’ll be there real quick.”</p>
<p>– I told you to take your time.</p>
<p>Some people say they can physically sense impending doom, but Heeju truly felt nothing. Looking back now, strangely enough, the traffic that day was incredibly heavy on her way home, and the chicken place that she and her sister loved happened to be closed.</p>
<p>She was anxious thinking about her sister waiting. As she hurriedly climbed the stairs to her apartment, someone was sitting on the last landing. The man, upon seeing Heeju, asked as if he had been waiting:</p>
<p>“Ms. Ko Heeju?”</p>
<p>She still vividly remembers the strange sensation of air enveloping her entire body when her eyes met with the man who had his hood pulled deep over his head.</p>
<p>“…Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m so glad to meet you.”</p>
<p>The unidentified man reeked of strong alcohol and stale sweat.</p>
<p>“It’s me. The one you f8ck3d up so badly this time.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Thanks to you, I’m going to jail.”</p>
<p>The man straightened his hunched back and stood up. Instinctively sensing danger, Heeju turned around without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Where do you think you’re running, you little rat!”</p>
<p>The man snorted harshly and kicked the ground. As she barely made it down the stairs, he grabbed her by the hair. Heeju screamed in pain as the roots of her hair were pulled out—before she swung her arms with all her might.</p>
<p>She doesn’t clearly remember how intense the physical struggle was. She just suddenly came to her senses to find thick fingers choking her throat, her vision turning black as her breath was cut off.</p>
<p>Just as consciousness was about to fade completely, Heeju mustered every last bit of strength and kicked the man in the gr0i1n. With a scream like a pig being slaughtered, the hands choking her throat quickly fell away.</p>
<p>“Urghk! You, b-…!”</p>
<p>The man collapsed on the floor, drooling and gasping. Without hesitation, Heeju ran down the stairs, taking two or three steps at a time. Just when she felt relieved thinking she had successfully escaped, hands full of malice suddenly pushed her hard from behind.</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Without any chance to react, Heeju tumbled down the stairs. Even while losing consciousness, she remembered thinking, ‘Unni will worry so much. What if she tells me to quit being a forensic pathologist?’</p>
<p>When Heeju opened her eyes again, she saw the white hospital ceiling. The IV drip beside her bed was dripping, and her entire body ached as if she’d been beaten. She expected her sister to be there, but instead of her sister, Yeongshin was there to greet her.</p>
<p>“Are you okay? You really… I thought you were going to die.”</p>
<p>Yeongshin repeatedly rubbed his face as he looked at the pale, awakened Heeju. Though it felt like she had just closed and opened her eyes, surprisingly, she had been unconscious for over five days since being brought to the emergency room.</p>
<p>Thanks to a neighbor who called the police during the commotion on the stairs, the perpetrator who did this to Heeju was arrested on the spot. Though three ribs were broken and her lungs were filled with blood, at least she hadn’t died, so it was just a matter of time before things would get better.</p>
<p>“But what about my sister? Where did she go?”</p>
