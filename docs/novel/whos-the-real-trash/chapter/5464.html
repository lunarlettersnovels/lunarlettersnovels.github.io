            <p><strong>Chapter 17.2</strong></p>
<p>“Who said you could pull away?”</p>
<p>“Hnng, mph…”</p>
<p>“You need to breathe through your nose, baby.”</p>
<p>The man’s previously relaxed gaze had turned fierce. Not just the m3mb3r in her mouth, but even his well-defined abs above were visibly throbbing.</p>
<p>Gukhyun straightened his previously reclined upper body. Finding the movement somehow threatening, Heeju swallowed her saliva with his m3mb3r still in her mouth. Her mouth involuntarily tightened.</p>
<p>When the soft membrane pressed against his m3mb3r, Gukhyun let out his first low m0.a@n. It was a a sound both s3ens.u@l and frightening, like a growling excited beast.</p>
<p>It felt strange that the man who hadn’t even flinched when having disinfectant poured on his bleeding wounds and flesh being stitched would make such sounds just from getting s*cked off.</p>
<p>And she found herself wanting to hear more of his m0.a@ns.</p>
<p>“S*ck it like you’re sucking hard candy.”</p>
<p>How did one s*ck hard candy? Heeju frowned as she gripped Gukhyun’s m3mb3r.</p>
<p>The veiny p*3n!s was so large and hard it was difficult to believe it was part of the same person’s body. It was so heated that rather than candy, it felt more like a hot iron rod.</p>
<p>“I thought only your p*s,s!y was tight, but your mouth is just as tight. What are we going to do with all your tiny h0l3s, baby?”</p>
<p>Even with just her clumsy licking, the m3mb3r filling her mouth pulsated wildly. Having something as thick as a club in her mouth made her jaw ache before long.</p>
<p>Saliva and prec*m mixed together were dripping messily from her stretched lips. Unlike the brutality ravaging her mouth, the man’s hand caressing the back of her head was infuriatingly gentle.</p>
<p>“Whew… Does it taste good?”</p>
<p>“Mmph, mm…”</p>
<p>“F1u!c.k…”</p>
<p>Heeju, who had been moving her head back and forth at first, gradually got overwhelmed by force. When she came to her senses, Gukhyun was standing up on both legs. Her upper body was nearly bent backward, and his impossibly massive m3mb3r was steadily invading her throat.</p>
<p>“Mph! Hngh! Hck…!”</p>
<p>Her breathing became ragged. This man was clearly planning to 3j@cul@.t3 in her mouth. Through her dizziness, she could feel his persistent gaze fixed on her. Just when she sensed he was about to release his load, Gukhyun instead pulled his m3mb3r out completely.</p>
<p>Gack! Cough!</p>
<p>Heeju bent forward and broke into a dry cough. Saliva dripped down. As her blocked airway cleared, her head spun as if she was hyperventilating.</p>
<p>“You’re better off just getting s*cked.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun grabbed Heeju’s staggering forearm and pulled her. Her body followed before she could react. Heeju was pushed by her shoulders and found herself lying flat on the autopsy table.</p>
<p>“Ah eugh, why here…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t this better than lying on the floor?”</p>
<p>Though she once spent almost all her waking hours here, while she’d looked down at this autopsy table countless times, this was her first time lying on it looking up at someone.</p>
<p>“My personal doctor has good hands but terrible c<em>ck-s</em>cking skills.”</p>
<p>Her pants and underwear dropped to the floor at once. Her sneakers came off too, caught in the pants, leaving Heeju with only her socks on as her ankles were grabbed. The autopsy table was hard, but somehow Gukhyun’s jacket had been placed under her bu!tt0cks, so it wasn’t cold.</p>
<p>Her thighs spread weakly. The cool air touching her sensitive flesh sent a chill through her.</p>
<p>It felt different from getting eaten out in the isolated space of Kwon Gukhyun’s mansion. This was once a place of Heeju’s daily life.</p>
<p>The feeling of spreading her legs and showing everything to a man in such a place…. It really felt like she’d gone as far as she could go.</p>
<p>It would be a lie to say she wasn’t ashamed, but at the same time, a twisted pleasure surged through her. She knew that being physically attracted to Kwon Gukhyun in the first place was close to a hopeless self-destructive desire.</p>
<p>Anyway, since he was a man without shame, morals, or conscience, there was nothing to be embarrassed about or hesitate over.</p>
<p>“You s*ck terribly, so why is your h0l3 so wet?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun gently caressed her v4g!n@ with his middle and ring fingers. He deliberately scooped up the sticky flu!ds flowing out. When he pressed his fingers together and pulled them apart, the clear liquid stretched like thread.</p>
<p>“Have you ever tasted your own juices?”</p>
<p>“Why would I?”</p>
<p>“Try it. It’s sweet.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>When Heeju turned her head away with a disgusted expression, Gukhyun chuckled with amusement. Then he put his fingers covered in her flu!ds into his own mouth and casually s*ck3d them clean.</p>
<p>“You’re quite picky.”</p>
<p>His playful smile lingered over her wet flesh. Gukhyun stuck out his tongue and wickedly licked up her sl!t while watching her reaction.</p>
<p>“Heuk!”</p>
