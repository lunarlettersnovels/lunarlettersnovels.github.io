            <p><strong>Chapter 17.1</strong></p>
<p>Heeju alternately looked at the large hand gripping her wrist and Gukhyun’s face. And she thought: He’s doing this on purpose. His twisted desire to watch her pathetically struggle must have kicked in.</p>
<p>Her former self would have been extremely hurt in her pride for showing weakness in front of others, but strangely, she didn’t care.</p>
<p>Was it because he had already seen her at her worst? Or perhaps she had reached a reckless state of mind where nothing mattered anymore.</p>
<p>“I’ll pay back the money on my own.”</p>
<p>“How will you manage when you collapse and tremble just from smelling the autopsy room?”</p>
<p>“…How do you know about that?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I’d investigate someone who’ll be working under me.”</p>
<p>Wasn’t he the man who said he’d investigated her background and knew everything anyway? So there was nothing particularly to be concerned about now.</p>
<p>“You’re supposed to wear a hazmat suit in here, you know? I won’t be responsible if anything happens.”</p>
<p>Heeju said while pulling up a chair to sit.</p>
<p>“Lift your shirt.”</p>
<p>Honestly, it would be easier to examine the wound with him lying on the autopsy table, but even for someone like Kwon Gukhyun, asking a living person to lie down on an autopsy table seemed inappropriate.</p>
<p>Gukhyun carelessly tossed his jacket aside and unbuttoned his shirt. Even seeing it again, his body was covered in scars.</p>
<p>“Ever seen any ghosts here?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“That’s disappointing. I thought I might meet some friends.”</p>
<p>Heeju rubbed the antiseptic cotton over Gukhyun’s wound. When she deliberately applied pressure to make it hurt, he chuckled as if it tickled.</p>
<p>While she took out a new pair of tweezers to remove the stitches and covered the wound with gauze, Gukhyun played with Heeju’s hair like a toy and gently stroked her earlobe. When Heeju pulled her neck back to avoid his touch, he would casually follow and scratch her ear.</p>
<p>“Why do you keep touching me annoyingly?”</p>
<p>“Because my hands are bored?”</p>
<p><em>‘If you’re bored, touch your own body.</em>’ Heeju only thought this to herself. If she said it out loud, he would undoubtedly undo his pants as if he’d been waiting for the chance. Wasn’t he the kind of person who would shamelessly 3j@cul@.t3 on someone’s face without any common sense?</p>
<p>“Is it done?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun asked as Heeju withdrew her hands and began cleaning up the tools with a clatter.</p>
<p>“Yes. You can get down now.”</p>
<p>“Then shall we do something fun?”</p>
<p>A soft, coaxing voice. Heeju turned to look at Gukhyun and froze.</p>
<p>“I was thinking of finishing what we left off last time.”</p>
<p>He was slowly massaging his er*ct m3mb3r through his pants. Heeju slowly raised her eyes. The man looking down at her had an arrogant and nonchalant expression, like someone collecting an overdue debt.</p>
<p>“Now?”</p>
<p><strong><em>Zzzzip.</em></strong></p>
<p>Instead of an answer, there was the sound of a zipper being pulled down.</p>
<p>“This was your intention from the start, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have a fever today, do you?”</p>
<p>His massively er<em>ct m3mb3r sprang up between his undone pants. The thick gl@ns, comparable to a baby’s fist, was already messily wet with prec</em>m.</p>
<p>“Why would I take such good care of someone who fell asleep while s*cking me off? You should repay the favor, even if it’s late.”</p>
<p>“You’re making it sound like all you did was take care of me.”</p>
<p>“It was marking my territory.”</p>
<p>Having seen it several times now, the sight of his menacingly throbbing m3mb3r wasn’t as shocking as the first time. Though very briefly, she had already taken it in her mouth once. What did it feel like? She couldn’t rem3mb3r well since she’d done it while feverish.</p>
<p>Watching clear flu!d drip down along the uneven surface, Heeju suddenly realized something. At some point, the sky had stopped looking yellow, her brain no longer roared, and her hands had stopped trembling like a fool.</p>
<p>It might have been since the man started that nonsense talk about ghosts, or perhaps since he started annoying her by playing with her earlobe. That was probably why she thought it wouldn’t be so bad.</p>
<p>Heeju wrapped both hands around the base of his m3mb3r. The entire shaft throbbed as if welcoming her inexperienced touch. Finding it somewhat fascinating, she slowly lowered her head.</p>
<p>Gukhyun didn’t rush her. He merely watched her quietly, leaning back with his arms propped behind him. His eyes were filled with wicked pleasure.</p>
<p>She stuck out her tongue and lightly licked the gl@ns. It was moist, hot, and surprisingly soft. When she poked it with the tip of her tongue, the way the excited ur3thr#l opening twitched greedily somehow felt er0t.i!c.</p>
<p>After finishing her exploration, Heeju opened her mouth wide and took in as much as she could.</p>
<p>“Mmph…”</p>
<p>Once she took it in, it was a bit overwhelming. Kwon Gukhyun’s shaft was too thick and it completely filled her mouth. As she tried to pull back, unsure of what to do with her tongue, a large palm suddenly gripped the back of her head.</p>
