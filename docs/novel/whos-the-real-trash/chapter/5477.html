            <p><strong>Chapter 11.1</strong></p>
<p>The man buried his face between her legs like a dog starved for three days and nights, greedily svck¡ng and swallowing. Each time, a l3!wd m⁰an rumbled from Heeju’s throat.</p>
<p>“Haa– eung, aah!”</p>
<p>The situation was entirely different from what she had imagined when she spr³ad her legs. She had thought he would just l¡ck a little, but at the moment she realized how foolish she had been, her !nn3r walls contracted frighterningly.</p>
<p>“Ha! St-stop…!”</p>
<p>“Not yet.”</p>
<p>“Un-until when…! Huuung! Ugh!”</p>
<p>“I’ll stop when I see you p!ss.”</p>
<p>Her hips trembled violently in the air. She twisted her pelvis and flailed her legs almost desperately, but the restraint holding Heeju’s lower body did not loosen. Instead, the movements of the tongue probing inside her became even more intense.</p>
<p>“Even the inside of your h⁰le is pink. Did you know?”</p>
<p>“How would I… Ahhk, know something like that… Huuu!”</p>
<p>“It’s so fvck¡ng pretty, it’s ridiculous.”</p>
<p>The heat coiled in her belly swirled rapidly, as if it would explode at any moment. Her convulsing body felt like it was soaring high and then plummeting down.</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>At some point, Heeju couldn’t even m0~an and clenched her toes tightly. The feeling of something bursting from underneath her felt strangely liberating. Frightening, but exhilirating— the kind of sensation she hadn’t felt in a long time.</p>
<p>“Haak, haa…”</p>
<p>Without realizing it, her hand, which had been gripping Gukhyun’s hair tightly, fell limply. Gukhyun also lifted his face that was covered in her flu¡ds, and released her waist.</p>
<p>Thud. She felt her bo!tt0m hit the sofa, but she had no strength left to close her legs that were spr³ad wide. Her whole body felt limp, as if it had turned into liquid and was sinking into the couch.</p>
<p>Heeju lay there, completely exhausted, panting heavily. Her mind was bleached white. She felt dizzy, dazed, and unable to think of anything. She thought that maybe she could just fall asleep like this without dreaming at all.</p>
<p>“The main event hasn’t even started, and you’re already passing out?”</p>
<p>While the one being sucked was on the verge of fainting, the one doing the sucking remained excessively calm. He wasn’t even breathing heavily. In fact, Gukhyun had already slipped a finger into Heeju’s v∆g¡nal opening.</p>
<p>Soaked in her fluids, the wet and slippery ¡nner w∆lls sucked on Gukhyun’s finger, trying to pull it deeper inside. He gently rubbed the soft flesh as if counting the folds of her vag¡n∆l walls. Then he whispered languidly.</p>
<p>“Do you just want to sleep? Baby, I’m sorry I can’t f.u!ck you. Your hole’s cramped.”</p>
<p>The man’s tone was not just gentle but almost indulgent. He said such things while having his finger inside her. Heeju pushed herself up from the sofa with her elbows, struggling to get up.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“…I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Anyone might think she had gotten back her bearings, but in reality, Heeju wasn’t thinking much at all. Her mind was truly blank.</p>
<p>While it wasn’t unheard of for someone to die during s³x, it seemed that kind of luck wasn’t on her side. Perhaps, as Kwon Gukhyun said, it was because the main event hadn’t even started yet.</p>
<p>“You’ve got good endurance. I like it.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun withdrew his finger from inside Heeju. Then he grabbed the outline of his painfully e®e©t p³n¡s through his pants and slowly massaged it. It looked like it was about to burst through the fabric, straining to the point of tearing. He looked quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Noticing Heeju’s gaze, Gukhyun chuckled and unzipped his pants. His p³n¡s, which had been compressed under the fabric, sprang up like a spring.</p>
<p>It sprang up so forcefully that there was no need to take it out. The thick object, resembling a club, sliced through the air and stood erect at an incredible speed.</p>
<p>The imposing p³n¡s slapped against the man’s abs with a thud, then bobbed heavily with the recoil. Transparent droplets of prec×m splattered as his sh@!ft pulsed in the air.</p>
<p>The large, flushed p3n¡s looked furious. The slit of the gl@ns flared, as if demanding to thr×st into something immediately for it to be satisfied.</p>
<p>Heeju reached out and wrapped her hand around the base. Gukhyun’s eyebrows lifted slightly.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to su2ck me. I just want to fu!3ck right now.”</p>
<p>“Try to hold on.”</p>
<p>Heeju got down under the sofa. It seemed more comfortable than bending over.</p>
<p>“Only if you’re hell-bent on getting a sore jaw. I’m d1a@mn good at holding back.”</p>
<p>As she watched Gukhyun’s confident smile, Heeju slowly lowered her head. Gukhyun gently tucked her hair behind her ear, seemingly intent on fully enjoying the view of her bl0w¡ng him off.</p>
