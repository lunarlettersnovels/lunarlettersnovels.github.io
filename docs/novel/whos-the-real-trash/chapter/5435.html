            <p><strong>Chapter 32.1</strong></p>
<p>The atmosphere felt oddly peaceful, and she couldn’t shake this strange feeling. Could she really believe the man’s claim that he just lent money to her sister?</p>
<p>Kwon Gukhyun, sitting there with his eyes closed, looked younger than usual. She couldn’t help but picture his childhood. She had heard that someone who was hired to kill his parents gave him a new last name. From that moment on, did he end up growing up with gangsters and getting involved in dangerous activities?</p>
<p>With caution, Heeju reached out and gently brushed aside the messy hair from Gukhyun’s forehead. His jet-black hair scattered across his strikingly handsome face. Just as she had been careful when reaching out, the moment she tried to pull her hand away, her chin and wrist were caught.</p>
<p>“…..!”</p>
<p>Before she knew it, Gukhyun had opened his eyes and was looking up at Heeju as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Are you getting wet down there just by looking at me?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that. I just thought your hair looked uncomfortable, so I brushed it aside.”</p>
<p>“You always come up with the cutest excuses.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun spun around and suddenly yanked Heeju’s pants. Before she could react, both her pants and pant!3s were pulled down at once.</p>
<p>“Ah, hey, I said I don’t want to…!”</p>
<p>He pushed Heeju’s shoulders firmly, making her lie back against the high stack of pillows. Then he tilted his head slightly to peek between her legs.</p>
<p>“You said you don’t want, so why is your p.8ussy so wet?”</p>
<p>Heeju closed her legs and protested, “I really don’t want to. If you get a fever or something, you’ll just collapse again.”</p>
<p>“You’re being so noisy with all that chirping. Just don’t do anything stupid, okay?”</p>
<p>“But why do you keep taking my clothes off…?!”</p>
<p>Her top was suddenly yanked off over her head. She tried to grab it at the last moment, but it flew under the bed. At the same time, Gukhyun buried his face in Heeju’s chest while slipping his hand behind her.</p>
<p>“I’m just going to suck you.”</p>
<p>The bra loosened.</p>
<p>“I don’t need it, heuk.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lie. It’s hard here.”</p>
<p>As Gukhyun took off the bra and pinched the erect n1pp!le with his fingertips.</p>
<p>“Mhm!”</p>
<p>“My baby is getting naughty.”</p>
<p>Her soft br@3sts were sucked into Gookhyun’s mouth. One finger slipped into her opening. He sucked on and mischievously pulled on her entire a!re0la.</p>
<p>“You can’t even last a day to suck me off. You’re nipples are already erect before I’ve even touched them.”</p>
<p>“Who the hell… ugh.”</p>
<p>“Shh… lower your voice.’”</p>
<p>Gukhyun pulled his finger out from inside Heeju’s hole and pushed it between her lips. Hngh, Heeju let out a m0a!n and she accidentally wrapped her tongue around the finger that went deep inside.</p>
<p>“If anyone outside hears and comes in, they’ll see you sucking—are you okay with that?”</p>
<p>Heeju looked at him with fingers covered in plenty of love juice in her mouth, as if protesting, and Gukhyun, grinning, bit Heeju’s thigh and kissed her.</p>
<p>“Good girl. I’ll just let you suck.”</p>
<p>He just stayed on her thigh as if he was waiting for her permission while her toes kept curling. Her legs instinctively spread, and her lower abdomen grew warmer. Gukhyun couldn’t possibly miss such physical changes in her.</p>
<p>At one point, Gukhyun sucked and swallowed the soft flesh of her thighs as he gently rubbed circles on her wet l@b!a. Her bottom jerked at the intense contact.</p>
<p>“Who’d believe that? It’s still like this, huh….”</p>
<p>She could feel her wet hole throbbing and squirming as he spoke. Heeju sighed in frustration. Her body had gotten used to Gukhyun’s touch—but it gave in too easily.</p>
<p>“Trust me. I’m not going to f*c!k you, and I’m not going to m@stu!rbat3.”</p>
<p>“Really…?”</p>
<p>“You’re doubting. Have you only lived being deceived?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun lips stretched to a grin as he sat up. His bandaged chest was rising and falling quickly with excitement. His a0us@al was highly contagious that Heeju felt her own breathing become ragged.</p>
<p>“Spread open your p8us!sy and show me.”</p>
<p>Despite feeling like a terrible p#rve2rt, Heeju spread her legs wide. Using her index and middle fingers, she spread her closed folds apart.</p>
<p>“You’re so good at taking me inside that tight, little hole.”</p>
<p>No matter how much she had already shown all kinds of things in front of him, she couldn’t be so shameless as to be indifferent in this position. Her ears began to turn red. She felt ashamed and embarrassed, yet at the same time, she was incredibly turned 0n.</p>
