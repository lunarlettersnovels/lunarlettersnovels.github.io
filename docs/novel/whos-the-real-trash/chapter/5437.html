            <p><strong>Chapter 31.1</strong></p>
<p>In a situation that was hard to understand, Heeju swallowed a sigh and said, “Is it time to eat ramen?”</p>
<p>“Then what should we do? I know what you were expecting, but this is everything.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun took out a potato chip and then closed the cupboard.</p>
<p>“There are a few passages like this in this house. The architect was probably a damn p#rv3rt or had a lot to hide, so they made escape routes to slip away quietly whenever needed. You just happened to discover one of them.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I thought you were a rabbit, but you’re just a mole digging around? You really don’t play as you look.”</p>
<p>“I don’t trust you.”</p>
<p>“Whether you trust me or not is up to you, and I don’t know your sister. I still don’t care where the money she borrowed from me went before she died.”</p>
<p>At his brutally cold words, Heeju’s eyes turned red. There was no reason for her to be hurt by someone like him, yet she couldn’t stop the heat from rising in her eyes. Despite casually spewing harsh words, Gukhyun narrowed his eyes and frowned.</p>
<p>“Hey, baby.”</p>
<p>He cupped Heeju’s chin with his large hand. Then, with a tender gesture, he gently stroked the redness around her eyes. Hands that would be better suited for choking someone’s neck or crushing a skull.</p>
<p>“You’ve noticed that I’m being softer with you than usual, right? Because you’re making that face, it’s funny, but it’s making me weak-hearted.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If you want to keep obsessing, I can have the kids hang out with you, but that’s all there is to it. There’s no grand secret that you’re hoping for.”</p>
<p>The hand that had been rubbing her eyes moved past Heeju’s cheek to toy with her lips. Every time his thumb brushed against her skin, her eyelids fluttered.</p>
<p>“The contract between you and me is simple. You’re paying off your sister’s debt, and once the contract is over, I’ll let you go.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Heeju found it hard to understand why he looked at her with such intense eyes while saying those words. In a relationship where all she had to do was pay off a debt, why was he being so soft with her, acting as if he was dying to have her?</p>
<p>The disparity between his words and actions left her confused about what was real and what wasn’t, which side she should believe, and whether he was even a man worth trusting in the first place. Everything surrounding him was confusing.</p>
<p>Gukhyun pressed gently under Heeju’s chin with his thumb. Her small mouth opened slightly, revealing her damp, red tongue inside. As he stared intently at her slightly parted lips, he suddenly leaned down. Heeju didn’t avoid him</p>
<p>Just as their lips were about to touch, a piercing scream echoed from the space connected to the auxiliary kitchen.</p>
<p>“Agh!”</p>
<p>The sound, which pierced through their eardrums, made both Gukhyun and Heeju turn their gazes in the same direction.</p>
<p>“F*ck!”</p>
<p>A rough curse followed. Upon listening closely, it was Sungang’s voice. Gukhyun grabbed Heeju’s hand and walked toward the source of the sound.</p>
<p>As they exited the auxiliary kitchen, a slightly larger space was revealed. One wall featured a large screen, and opposite it was a bed big enough for at least three people to roll around on. If this was a movie theater, the edges of the room looked like they had been transformed into an internet café.</p>
<p>Several dual monitors were set up on a computer desk, and Sungang was sitting at one of them, hurling curses at the screen.</p>
<p>“Is that m`therf#cker trying to shoot me from there? Wow, f<em>ck, what do I do? I’m so f</em>cking pissed!”</p>
<p>Gukhyun left Sungang to his outburst and led Heeju to the bed. When he suddenly pressed down on her shoulder, she plopped down onto the bed.</p>
<p>“Why…”</p>
<p>Heeju glanced at Sungang’s back. He seemed completely unaware that anyone else had entered the room, likely because he was wearing a headset.</p>
<p>Gukhyun also climbed onto the bed. Heeju instinctively shifted her bottom, her eyes filled with wariness. With the combination of the bed and Kwon Gukhyun, the atmosphere was inevitably becoming l.3wd.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when they were doing it at the living room window, he had made that outrageous suggestion about calling the other guys to show them having s`x. Of course, she thought it was just something he said because he was h&amp;rny, but there was no guarantee that Kwon Gukhyun wouldn’t actually do it.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me like that? I just want to watch a wholesome movie.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun chuckled as if he could see right through Heeju’s thoughts and picked up the remote control. Even after he turned on the screen, Heeju couldn’t shake off her suspicions.</p>
