            <p><strong>Chapter 26.2</strong></p>
<p>Seeing that their acts were becoming more and more l3,wd and vu!lg@r day by day, she sometimes felt like she was being manipulated without even realizing it.</p>
<p>“You swallow com3 just fine, but you don’t like p2.ss!y juice.”</p>
<p>“That’s completely different. It’s weird to eat something that came out your own body.”</p>
<p>“A picky eater is a bad child.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already become bad since I started sleeping with you.”</p>
<p>“You’re openly treating me like trash.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun raised Heeju’s body and hugged her.</p>
<p>“I haven’t even done anything trashy yet.”</p>
<p>The knitwear was whipped off over her head.</p>
<p>“Show me your n!p,pl3s.”</p>
<p>“You can just take the rest off.”</p>
<p>“Just take your br3@s.ts out. With your own hands.”</p>
<p>Heeju looked at Gukhyun with eyes as if she really had to do that. Gukhyun gently stroked Heeju’s soft lower abdomen and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>“That’s more ar0!us1ng.”</p>
<p>“Ha…. You’re really a p3rv.e!rt.”</p>
<p>When Heeju shuddered, Gukhyun leaned his forehead on Heeju’s shoulder and chuckled.</p>
<p>“Trash and a p3rv.e!rt. I’m f2ck!.ng irredeemable.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun put his hand inside her bra and tickled her n!p,pl3s. While Heeju groaned at the wet sensation tingling her earlobe, he took out the soft flesh from outside her bra and massaged it roughly, saying.</p>
<p>“Are you going to collect me?”</p>
<p>“Why would I? Hmmmng, ahhh.”</p>
<p>“You like my c01.ck.”</p>
<p>“Ha, mmngh, men’s c01.cks are all the same.”</p>
<p>“You’re saying cute things. Curious? Want to eat our kids one by one?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun, who asked in a low voice as if making a secret proposal, pushed his hot tongue into Heeju’s earhole. Hnngh! A l2s.tful mo@a.n eruptedand he tugged hard on her erect n!p,pl3s, as if in praise.</p>
<p>Her pink n!p,pl3s stiffened in his hand, and her soft flesh turned into a l3.w!d shape. It should have been shameful for her n!p,pl3s to be stretched out in the outward direction, but rather she was so ar0us3.d that tears welled up. She was as crazy as she could be.</p>
<p>“Hmmph! You told me to only do it with you.”</p>
<p>Her sensitive n!p,pl3s now sparked with electricity whenever he touched them. Had her whole body become an erogenous zone? L2s.tf!ul flames spread wherever Gukhyun’s touch passed. Her spine trembled and her knees kept buckling.</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>Heeju blankly watched Gukhyun press down on both of her n!p,pl3s at once with his large hands and play with them as he pleased, and lowered her hand. Because her juices on his hand was smeared all over her chest, everything in sight was er0t!c and stimulating. Her gr0p!ng hand came into contact with his erect p.3n!s.</p>
<p>“Want to touch my c01.ck?”</p>
<p>When she stroked his hard shaft with her hand, Gukhyun turned Heeju’s body around and made her face him. His fiercely erect p.3n!s rubbed subtly against her flat lower abdomen.</p>
<p>“Touch my balls too.”</p>
<p>He had only taken out his p.3n!s from between his unbuttoned pants. Heeju put her hand inside his drawers and touched his sc.r0t1m.</p>
<p>“How is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s softer than I thought.”</p>
<p>It was the first time she had touched a living man’s sc.r0t1m. The thin and soft epidermis was soft and the inside was hard. It was clinging tightly to his g.r0!n and throbbing as if it would pump out c.om3 at any moment at Heeju’s touch.</p>
<p>“It’s like candy. Want me to give it to you?”</p>
<p>“Ha, you’re crazy. What are you going to do with this s.h!t?”</p>
<p>“It’s for licking, sucking, and petting.”</p>
<p>Isn’t he already doing that? While she was blankly thinking, Gukhyun suddenly grabbed Heeju’s forearm and pulled her over.</p>
<p>“Come this way.”</p>
<p>The place he led Heeju to was in front of the full-length window facing the garden. The moonlight illuminating the desolate garden was particularly bright.</p>
<p>“I, I don’t like it here.”</p>
<p>Heeju pulled her hips back and resisted, but there was no way she could stand up to Kwon Gukhyun’s strength, who could even lift an adult man upside down. She was dragged along.</p>
