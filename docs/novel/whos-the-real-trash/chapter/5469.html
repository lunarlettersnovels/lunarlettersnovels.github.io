            <p><strong>Chapter 15.1</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps because of Kwon Gukhyun’s massive frame, the reception room’s sofa looked particularly cramped. Was it his gaze that made him seem like a predator waiting for prey to fall into his trap?</p>
<p>Heeju stood in front of the sofa and asked.</p>
<p>“Why did you come here?”</p>
<p><em>‘It seems I wasn’t mistaken when I thought our eyes met in the lobby earlier.</em>’</p>
<p>His long eyes with gray irises curved elegantly.</p>
<p>“I should be asking why my personal doctor, who should be at home, is here.”</p>
<p>“You gave me permission to go out.”</p>
<p>“Going out is fine. But it would be bad if you misunderstood that I let you out for fresh air to secretly flirt with some d!c.kh3ad behind my back.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun uncrossed his legs and spread them wide. His characteristically arrogant yet relaxed attitude seemed both threatening and seductive.</p>
<p>“Do you always talk like that?”</p>
<p>“I tend to. Do you like it?”</p>
<p>“From what I saw earlier, you were disgustingly good at pretending to be polite.”</p>
<p>It felt strange to recall the image of Kwon Gukhyun shaking hands with professors on the stage and patting children’s heads.</p>
<p>“Is politeness your thing? 근데 그건 어렵겠다. 네가 좀 꼴려야지.”</p>
<p>That same man was now sitting there like a villain, spewing vulgar words.</p>
<p>“Has it been a week? My baby has become even prettier.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun slowly examined Heeju from head to toe, inspecting her with his gaze. Having left her coat downstairs, Heeju was wearing a knit top and slacks. Her toes unconsciously curled.</p>
<p>Even though she was fully dressed, she felt as if she was being stripped piece by piece – this was due to Kwon Gukhyun’s persistent gaze being so intense.</p>
<p>“Did you call me here just to mess around? You must have a lot of free time.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun shrugged his shoulders at Heeju’s words.</p>
<p>“I didn’t call you here to crack jokes. This spot keeps throbbing.”</p>
<p>He lifted one side of his suit jacket wide open. Then he placed his hand over his shirt. It was at the end of his ribcage – the area where Heeju had sutured a week ago.</p>
<p>“I need some warranty service. I can’t even f8ck with this. Did I hire a quack doctor?”</p>
<p>His smirking face looked quite amused. Heeju let out a small sigh and approached Gukhyun.</p>
<p>“Let me see.”</p>
<p>As Heeju casually stepped between the man’s thighs, a lazy smile spread across Gukhyun’s face. It was a suggestive smile, as if welcoming a foolish prey that had finally fallen into his trap.</p>
<p>Feeling his intense gaze on her face, Heeju pulled out the hem of Gukhyun’s shirt from his pants. As she slowly unbuttoned from the bottom up, she could see the long, thick outline on his left thigh visibly growing larger in real time.</p>
<p>Heeju pretended not to notice as she removed her hands from the buttons and lifted the fabric up. While examining the wound on his abdomen closely, she could feel Kwon Gukhyun’s breath spreading across her nape. It was very languid, as if observing the situation, yet tense, as if it could turn fierce at any moment.</p>
<p>At the moment when that strange tension would snap, it felt like the man might bite into her nape. Her pulse quickened instinctively.</p>
<p>“It’s time to remove the stitches.”</p>
<p>Heeju straightened her back and spoke in a calm voice. As the atmosphere of assessing each other and the subtle tug-of-war suddenly lost its balance, Gukhyun smirked.</p>
<p>“From what I can see, you haven’t been disinfecting it at all. When you neglect a wound like this, of course it throbs and it hurts.”</p>
<p>He had clearly left it exactly as it was since her last treatment. For an ordinary person, it would have become infected or worse, but his body, despite being subjected to such sad neglect, had managed to heal well on its own.</p>
<p>“That’s why I came. To see my personal doctor.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun lifted his chin as if expecting praise.</p>
<p>“I’ll remove them when we get home. You’ve already waited this long, so you can endure a few more hours.”</p>
<p>“Do it now. It doesn’t feel right.”</p>
<p>What an attitude.</p>
<p>Heeju let out a resigned sigh and went outside. He wasn’t the type to be persuaded anyway. It was better to just quickly do what he wanted. The assistant, who had been looking at the monitor, jumped up awkwardly from their seat in surprise.</p>
<p>“Are you done talking?”</p>
<p>“Ah, do you happen to have a first aid kit?”</p>
<p>“Are you hurt?”</p>
<p>The startled assistant glanced at Gukhyun who followed Heeju out. It seemed there was some misunderstanding. Gukhyun raised his eyebrow slightly while staring intently at the assistant.</p>
<p>The assistant’s face was visibly turning pale. Heeju stood between the two and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m not hurt. I just need it for something.”</p>
