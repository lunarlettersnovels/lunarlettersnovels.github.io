            <p><strong>Chapter 12.2</strong></p>
<p>He usually just sucks up to others and when it was his turn to have fun, the person who should be pleasing him has already passed out. It wouldn’t have been surprising if he had just left her there, but it was a bit unexpected that he took care of the medicine himself. He was a strange guy in many ways.</p>
<p>Thinking that he was more sensible than he appeared, Heeju picked up the cooling patch that had fallen on the blanket. But she felt something squishy and sticky. When she rubbed her hand, a whitish mucus stretched out like a thread.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Feeling a sense of foreboding, Heeju touched her cheek with her hand. The same slippery liquid was not only on her cheek but also smeared around her mouth. It was evidence that the man, who was already beyond common sense, had not only taken care of her but also satisfied his own desires.</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised at all.”</p>
<p>Heeju muttered to herself in a tired voice and collapsed back onto the bed. With s3m*n all over her face, she thought she should wash it off first, but everything felt too bothersome.</p>
<p>If someone had ej@cu.late2d on her face, shouldn’t they at least have the decency to wipe it off? What kind of d!1ckh3@ad would leave it there like that?</p>
<p>Heeju closed her eyes, imagining Kwon Gukhyun, who had calmly m@st1u.rbat³d beside her while she was feverish. She felt her temperature rising again. Sleep was far away.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It had been a week since Heeju became Kwon Gukhyun’s official doctor, yet she hadn’t seen even a glimpse of her employer. No one informed her of his whereabouts, and Heeju wasn’t particularly curious.</p>
<p>“How long do you think it will take today?”</p>
<p>Sungang, sitting in the driver’s seat, asked as he turned the steering wheel sharply. However, there was no immediate response. Sungang glanced at the back seat through the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>“She’s dazed again.”</p>
<p>Heeju was staring blankly out the car window. The sight of bare street trees swiftly passing by was reflected in her clear brown eyes, but she wasn’t engaged in any particularly productive thoughts. Zoning out and killing time was what Heeju was best at these days.</p>
<p>“Hey, kid!”</p>
<p>“…Yes?”</p>
<p>Heeju answered belatedly. Sungang’s face, looking at her through the rearview mirror, was as fierce as ever. The scar across his face became more pronounced whenever he looked like that.</p>
<p>“I asked how long it will take today. When should I come to pick you up?”</p>
<p>“Ah… I’ll find my way back on my own. No need for you to come back.”</p>
<p>The car carrying the two of them was on its way to the forensic research institute where Heeju used to work. It was because she didn’t know when the work would end, but Sungang’s eyes filled with suspicion, and his gaze narrowed as he listened to Heeju’s response.</p>
<p>“I’d really like to do that too, you know? But I’m just wired to follow orders, so I can’t help it. Enough talk, just contact me when you’re about to finish.”</p>
<p>He seemed to think she might try to escape secretly, but Heeju had no intention of running away, not even a tiny bit. Running away was something for people who had the will, passion, and stamina for it.</p>
<p>Even if she did run away, there was nothing special to do, nor anything she wanted to do. It would be the same as wasting time and air uselessly, so why bother exhausting herself? It would just make her unnecessarily tired, for what reason?</p>
<p>Heeju had no reason to desperately run away from the place, especially since she was curious about the information regarding Ko Heejin, whom she didn’t know, who had worked at that mansion. What exactly she wanted to know was still unclear.</p>
<p>Moreover, if she worked for just five months, they would forgive a debt of 200 million won, so why would she refuse?</p>
<p>“If you turn off your phone and run, you’re dead.”</p>
<p>Sungang stopped the car in front of the school and gave a fierce warning, scowling.</p>
<p>“Let’s not make things difficult for each other. You know you’re in the palm of my hand even if you try to hide, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes… I’m not going to run away.”</p>
<p>I don’t have the strength for that anyway. Heeju got out of the car with a tired expression.</p>
