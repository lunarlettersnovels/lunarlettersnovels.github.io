            <p><strong>Chapter 24.2</strong></p>
<p>Giju, who placed his hand on the ground, staggered to his feet with his uninjured leg. Limping, he barely managed to reach the edge of the swimming pool where Gukhyun was standing.</p>
<p>“Giju, I don’t say anything about you coming here to play. I don’t care if you do drugs, f2.ck in groups, or do any kind of crazy sh!1t.”</p>
<p>“…Go f2.c!k yourself. You say you don’t give a f2.c!k, but you’re doing this to me?”</p>
<p>“If you’re so considerate, you should act like it. You can’t bully the people under me. Is that how hyung taught you?”</p>
<p>After a long, hollow laugh, Giju exhausted body slumped over the edge of the pool. His breath was rough from moving with his injured foot. The blood that had been trickling down from the back of his head began to soak the collar of his gown.</p>
<p>Giju looked up at Gukhyun. He was in the swimming pool, and Gukhyun was standing above, so there was a huge difference in their eye level.</p>
<p>Backlighting shone, and white light spread around the huge silhouette. Gukhyun’s face looked dark. Thinking that he looked just like a demon, Giju muttered,</p>
<p>“You’re just a stray dog… I dressed you in good clothes and fed you good food to raise you, so you must think you’ve become something? But in the end, you’re just a hound.”</p>
<p>“Do you know what happens to a hunting dog like you after the hunt is over? I’ll hang you to death. It wouldn’t be bad to pluck your fur and beat you with a club until your spine becomes limp.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun held out the phone in front of Giju’s face, who was muttering like a crazy person.</p>
<p>“You’ve been watching too many movies. Puberty came too late.”</p>
<p>The moment Giju reached out to snatch the phone, Gukhyun tossed it to the side with a flick. Thud. The phone, which fell to the bottom of the swimming pool, bounced off the tiles and rolled away.</p>
<p>“Sh1t! Are you kidding me?”</p>
<p>Giju, who looked at the phone that had flown away just in front of him, glared at Gukhyun with a spiteful expression.</p>
<p>“It slipped. Pick it up and use it.”</p>
<p>His ankle was dislocated to the point where he couldn’t even stand properly on both feet. His body, leaning against the edge of the swimming pool, trembled. Giju, who swallowed the extreme anger, twisted his lips fiercely.</p>
<p>“You must have misunderstood. I didn’t harass her. What was her name, Ko Heeju?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Giju pointed at Heeju with his chin.</p>
<p>“I just had a little interview. I was going to take her and use her if hyung threw her away. I thought the doctor is worth keeping around with that pretty face.”</p>
<p>“Ah… You’re crossing the line.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun let out a low sigh. Giju didn’t hear his quiet mutter.</p>
<p>“Yunam.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung.”</p>
<p>“Take her away.”</p>
<p>“But hyung, your shoulder…”</p>
<p>“Don’t make me say it twice. Go home.”</p>
<p>Yunam, who reluctantly bowed his head, helped Heeju up. Heeju was pulled up powerlessly.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Seokchan, who watched Yunam take Heeju away, carefully opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Gukhyun, stop here and just bear with it. Giju is just saying whatever comes to his mind because he’s angry, and he’s just a kid. I’ll tell the Chairman about what happened today and make sure it goes smoothly…”</p>
<p>“Take your hand off.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun slowly turned around and spoke. Seokchan flinched and pulled back the hand that had been holding Gukhyun’s shoulder to stop him. Just his gaze alone sent shivers down his spine.</p>
<p>“I warned you. Don’t make me feel like sh!1t.”</p>
<p>“What are you… Are you not even going to let me talk? It’s not something to go this far over. Calm down. Giju’s ankle is dislocated right now. He needs to be taken to the hospital.”</p>
<p>“Giju, is your ankle dislocated?”</p>
<p>The tone of his question was quite gentle. The gaze looking down at him was also as soft as if he were looking at a brother, making it difficult to grasp his intentions. Just a moment ago, he had been acting like he was going to kill him.</p>
<p>Giju rolled his eyes in frustration.</p>
<p>“Are you asking because you don’t know? It hurts like f2c!k. I think my skill is cracked.”</p>
<p>“You’re exaggerating.”</p>
<p>“Exaggerating? Can you say that after seeing this? I even bled, you know?”</p>
<p>Giju, who distorted his expression, spread out his bloodied palm.</p>
<p>“Oh, my. Then clench your jaw tightly.”</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>“It’s going to hurt even more from now on, so bite down on your molars tightly. You’ll hurt your teeth.”</p>
<p>The moment Giju looked up at Gukhyun with a dazed face, a shoe slammed into his head.</p>
