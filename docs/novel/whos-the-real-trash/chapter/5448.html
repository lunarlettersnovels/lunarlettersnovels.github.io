            <p><strong>Chapter 25.2</strong></p>
<p>Giju trembled and looked up at Gukhyun. His teeth chattered. If he wanted to survive here, the only way was to hope that he would show mercy. But how?</p>
<p>That bastard’s eyes are completely gone…?</p>
<p>“Hyung, Gukhyun hyung, I’m in so much pain, please send me to the hospital.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t an exaggeration, he really felt like he was going to die. The punch to his stomach earlier probably even damaged his organs. Giju, who decided to appeal to his emotions, clutched his stomach and groaned.</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me like that, please just forgive me once… Hyung!”</p>
<p>Giju, who grabbed Gukhyun’s leg and clung to it, slid down and cried out in frustration.</p>
<p>“Honestly, what did I do so wrong? Is this something to go this far over? You’re overreacting to a little joke between us! Don’t you care about the Chairman anymore? Fu2c.k! Is there nothing you’re afraid of anymore!”</p>
<p>He tasted blood in his throat as he spat out a spiteful cry. Giju, who was prostrate at Gukhyun’s feet, couldn’t control his anger and slammed the floor with his hands.</p>
<p>“I’m so embarrassed! What did I do so wrong! Huh?”</p>
<p>“You’re asking me that?”</p>
<p>“Huuk, f3c!k, this is f.u2ck3d up, really…”</p>
<p>“You have no learning ability, Giju. That’s why I told you to read a book once in a while.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun bent down and grabbed Giju’s collar and lifted him.</p>
<p>“Eu, eua, ha, don’t do it, don’t do it!”</p>
<p>Giju, who was frightened, struggled and thrashed, trying to remove the hand holding his collar. However, his body, unable to overcome the monstrous strength, was helplessly dragged into the air. His dislocated ankle rattled.</p>
<p>Gukhyun slowly scanned Giju from head to toe and pondered. His face, his chest, his stomach with a fierce gaze that only beasts can have. Which spot would it hurt the most?</p>
<p>“Keeuk…”</p>
<p>Giju, unable to overcome the extreme tension, let out a grotesque groan and finally lost his mind. Even so, Gukhyun didn’t release the strength in his hand.</p>
<p>The moment he balled his fists in judgment, someone hugged his waist from behind. He shook her off as if she were annoying, and she fell away with a shriek.</p>
<p>“……?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun, who thought it would be Yoon Seokchan, stopped moving and immediately turned his head. It was none other than Heeju who had flown and crashed into the corner of the swimming pool.</p>
<p>Heeju let out a strangled groan as she fell to the ground. She couldn’t breathe well the moment she was pushed away. His strength was so great that her entire head was dizzy and her whole body ached as if she had been beaten.</p>
<p>At the very least she was only thrown backward this much, but if she had been hit properly by that hand, something would be definitely broken.</p>
<p>Yunam ran over, a mixture of surprise and embarrassment on his face, and helped Heeju up.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Heeju, who was pale and ghastly, rose weakly, staggering.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m okay…”</p>
<p>Gukhyun was just staring at the scene somewhat blankly. He didn’t blink an eyelid, as if he was stuck in a situation he didn’t understand.</p>
<p>Heeju rubbed her throbbing shoulder and looked at Gukhyun.</p>
<p>“That’s enough. Let’s go home together.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“You are scaring me.”</p>
<p>Yunam swept his face with his hand as if he had heard something shocking. A fierce wind blew, sweeping away the fallen leaves rolling on the bottom of the swimming pool.</p>
<p>The full moon hanging on the wall was chillingly white. Despite having a face that was paler than the moon, Heeju walked with a firm step, as if she wasn’t afraid at all. Yunam tried to stop Heeju from behind, but a glance from Gukhyun stopped him in his tracks.</p>
<p>“I’m saying this as your doctor.”</p>
<p>Heeju, who had come closer, pointed to Gukhyun’s hand. Gukhyun lowered his gaze and looked at his hand. There was blood smeared all over the back of his hand.</p>
<p>“It’s not my blood.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. I want to earn money without working.”</p>
<p>“You’re a thug.”</p>
<p>“Fire me if you don’t like it.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun chuckled at Heeju’s words.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason to dislike it. I’m a thug too.”</p>
<p>Finally, he let go of Giju’s collar and took Heeju’s hand.</p>
