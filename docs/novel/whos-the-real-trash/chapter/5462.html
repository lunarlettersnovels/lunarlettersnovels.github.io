            <p><strong>Chapter 18.2</strong></p>
<p>“If you’re sorry, ngh, it’s not too late to stop.”</p>
<p>“When such a pretty h0l3 is fluttering right in front of me, begging to be filled, it’s not easy to stop. I’m not impotent, you know.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun pressed his m3mb3r against her tightly closed entr@nC.e and applied pressure. Her opening, thoroughly loosened from the previous foreplay, greedily moved like a mouth and caught his gl@ns. However, it wouldn’t open any further.</p>
<p>“Ahk…! Ah, it hurts!”</p>
<p>Heeju shrank her shoulders and trembled. Gukhyun’s m3mb3r was too massive to swallow at once, and Heeju’s tight opening, never having received a man before, only clenched tighter and gaped helplessly.</p>
<p><em>It hurts?</em> Gukhyun lowered his upper body and gently licked her earlobe. <em>What to do, I won’t be able to stop even if you cry.</em></p>
<p>“Relax. It’s going in.”</p>
<p>Though his whisper was gentle, he didn’t pull back. Each syllable, laden with moist heat, gave her a feeling of growing l3w.dness.</p>
<p>“Ahk, w-wait…!”</p>
<p>He gripped her thighs and pushed them up toward her chest. Her body folded in half. The flu!ds coating her v4g!n@ trickled down beneath her bu2t.t0cks.</p>
<p>“Remember this.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun looked into Heeju’s eyes as he slowly pushed his throbbinglength in.</p>
<p>“This is the feeling of my c<em>ck spreading your p</em>ssy open.”</p>
<p><em>Squelch.</em> With immense pressure from below, her inner walls began to spread tightly around the shape of his m3mb3r.</p>
<p>“Ah…! Ah eugh…”</p>
<p>Frozen by the shock of this first-time experience, Heeju unconsciously wrapped her arms around Gukhyun’s neck in a death grip. She needed something to hold onto, and all she could see was Kwon Gukhyun.</p>
<p>“From now on, when you come here, you’ll only rem3mb3r fu.2ck!ng with me.”</p>
<p>Sweat had formed on Gukhyun’s forehead. The feeling of being squeezed so tightly made his rough breathing come in low gasps.</p>
<p>“Ah, eung, nng, d-don’t, move. Hngh.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun lifted and embraced Heeju’s body. <em>Ahngh!</em> The connection deepened. His shaft filled her insides completely, making her belly visibly bulge. Heeju shook her head frantically.</p>
<p>“Isn’t one person tormenting you enough?”</p>
<p>“Uhuhk, hnng…”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Baby.”</p>
<p>Through her scattered consciousness, he whispered softly. Then he grabbed her chin and devoured her lips.</p>
<p>It was a kiss that seemed to mark her. Intensely sharp and fierce.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“You’ll catch a cold if you sleep in a place like this.”</p>
<p>Heeju’s eyelids trembled. As his m3mb3r slowly pulled out, her inner walls clenched tightly. Her flesh, having tasted climax, gripped his m3mb3r as if screaming for it not to leave.</p>
<p>“Hnn…”</p>
<p>Heeju lay limply on her side on the autopsy table, barely breathing. She was so drained she couldn’t move a finger. Even though he had just pulled out, her overworked h0l3 still felt strangely full.</p>
<p>She learned one thing from s*x with Kwon Gukhyun. That it might actually kill her if done right.</p>
<p>When Gukhyun’s m3mb3r first spread her inside and dug deep into her belly, she thought she would die like being skewered, but at some point, she felt like dying in a different way.</p>
<p>The sensation of being mercilessly pierced, pounded, and packed by something comparable to a deadly weapon was still vivid between her legs. How had such heat remained hidden so deep within her body?</p>
<p>The uncontrollable pleasure seemed to lift her weakly trembling body somewhere before suddenly bursting like an explosion. The feeling of her soul scattering like dust, leaving behind only an empty shell – for the price of doing something crazy, it felt surprisingly good.</p>
<p>Heeju wanted to savor this drowsy state a bit longer, feeling as if being pulled into sleep. But Gukhyun wouldn’t leave her lying there like a corpse.</p>
<p>“Get up. You need to go home. You want to sleep sprawled out here?”</p>
<p>“Leave me alone for a moment. I’m exhausted.”</p>
<p>Her entr@nC.e, still affected by her climax, kept opening and closing, repeatedly contracting and relaxing. Gukhyun spread her b2t.t0cks with his hands, seeming to enjoy watching her twitching v@g!na.</p>
<p>That wasn’t all. He even inserted his fingers into her h0l3, which was thoroughly mixed with his s*m3n and her flu!ds, and stirred them around with squelching sounds.</p>
