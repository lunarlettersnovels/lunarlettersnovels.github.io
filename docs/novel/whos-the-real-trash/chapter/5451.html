            <p><strong>Chapter 24.1</strong></p>
<p>“Dr. Hwang must be upset that he lost his job overnight.”</p>
<p>Heeju replied in as calm a voice as possible.</p>
<p>“The bleeding has already stopped, and if it’s uncomfortable, you can just put a bandage on it. Is that okay?”</p>
<p>“No? It’s not okay.”</p>
<p>Giju, who suddenly stood up, grabbed Heeju’s wrist and forcefully pulled her towards him.</p>
<p>“Take a closer look. I’m telling you it hurts.”</p>
<p>Her wrist felt like it would snap. She frowned.</p>
<p>“Let go of this…”</p>
<p>At that moment, a chillingly low and eerie voice suddenly came from behind.</p>
<p>“Then, shall I take a look?”</p>
<p>Heeju, who quickly turned around, widened her eyes. Gukhyun was striding towards them from the other side of the swimming pool.</p>
<p>He looked somewhat disheveled, unlike his usual self. Not only was his suit jacket unbuttoned, but even the front of the coat he wore over it was open, and the long coat tails fluttered in the breeze. As if time had slowed down, the approaching man’s figure seemed to be in slow motion.</p>
<p>It seemed that she wasn’t the only one who was frozen in place. Yoon Seokchan and Kwon Giju were the same. While the three of them were blankly captivated, Gukhyun, who had approached in the blink of an eye, grabbed Giju’s ankle, who was sitting on the sunbed, and lifted it up.</p>
<p>“What, what are you d-doing… Uwaaaaaaagh!”</p>
<p>He lifted him into the air like he was catching an animal and threw Kwon Giju towards the swimming pool. Was it even possible to lift an adult man, who seemed to weigh at least 90kg, so lightly, and even with one hand as if he were hanging upside down in the air?</p>
<p>At the unbelievable sight, the blood drained from Heeju’s face. Regardless of whether Heeju believed it or not, Kwon Giju had already floated in the air, then slammed into the bottom of the swimming pool with a thud.</p>
<p>“Keuk, keuek…! Ahheuk…”</p>
<p>Because the swimming pool had been drained for the winter, the aftermath of the impact was directly transmitted to his body. Giju couldn’t get up right away, lying on his side, and trembled with twitches. Several tiles were shattered.</p>
<p>“Executive Director Kwon! Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>Seokchan jumped up and shouted.</p>
<p>“Director Yoon, it seems like there’s nothing you’re afraid of anymore.”</p>
<p>When Gukhyun turned around, Seokchan flinched, shrinking back and stepping away.</p>
<p>“Why are you keeping my doctor here without my permission?”</p>
<p>“…I’m not keeping her here. Giju was slightly injured, so I just asked her to take a look at his wound. I didn’t bring her here by force.”</p>
<p>“Even so, you should have gotten my permission.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I understand that, but do you think the Chairman will let this go if you do that to Giju? Are you out of your mind?”</p>
<p>“Your tongue has gotten a lot longer, hasn’t it? Our Director Yoon Seokchan.”</p>
<p>As Gukhyun slowly called out his name, attaching his surname, Seokchan couldn’t even retort and clenched his fists tightly. Just the difference in their physiques alone was enough for Gukhyun to overwhelm the atmosphere.</p>
<p>“I’ll let Director Yoon off the hook, so be quiet. Don’t make me feel like sh1!t.”</p>
<p>Red veins stood out in Seokchan’s eyes, crushed by the heavy air. After Seokchan became quiet, Gukhyun looked down into the swimming pool again.</p>
<p>“Giju, crawl out.”</p>
<p>Giju’s ankle, sprawled on the bottom, was bent in a strange direction. Having been lifted up by only his ankle and thrown like that, his ankle couldn’t bear the weight.</p>
<p>“Euheuk, fu1c2k…”</p>
<p>Giju touched his head and looked at his palm. Thick blood was smeared on it.</p>
<p>“Fu1c2k, blood… I fell on my head. I fell on my head!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, you’re a stonehead.”</p>
<p>“Haha, fu1c2k! Hyung, are you out of your mind?”</p>
<p>After laughing and cursing in disbelief, Giju groped his body wildly while lying down. However, all he was wearing was a triangular swimsuit and a gown.</p>
<p>“Looking for your phone? Are you going to call your dad?”</p>
<p>At Gukhyun’s gesture, Yunam, who had been standing behind him, went towards the jacuzzi. The people who had been enjoying the open-air bath had already sensed the unusual atmosphere when Giju flew into the swimming pool and ran away as fast as their tails could carry them.</p>
<p>Only pale steam was rising from the empty jacuzzi. Yunam, who rummaged through the clothes that Giju had taken off, brought the phone he found in the pocket.</p>
<p>“You always drag your dad into things you should resolve with me. I feel sorry for you, parentless bastard.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have made me feel sorry for you! This is a declaration of war against the Chairman! Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Giju, stop acting crazy and come get your stuff.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun held out the phone he received from Yunam in the air.</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law! Are you just going to stand there and watch? Aren’t you going to help me? My ankle is dislocated!”</p>
<p>Giju turned his head sharply and glared at Seokchan. Seokchan merely sighed as if he were tired and rubbed his face with his dry hands.</p>
<p>“Sh1!t… You’re all dead.”</p>
