            <p><strong>Chapter 3.1</strong></p>
<p>The soaked pants quickly turned into rags. If she squeezed the fabric that had come off the man’s body, it felt like blood would flow out. Although there was a lot of blood, the man’s legs were spotless without a single wound.</p>
<p>So whose blood was all that? She had no desire to find out as much as she badly wanted to, but it felt right to ask anyway.</p>
<p>“You don’t look like you have any other injuries. With all that blood, I thought I’d have to do some major surgery.”</p>
<p>Heeju calmly dressed the sutured area, shifting her gaze from the man’s muscular thighs. Every time her fingers brushed his skin, his abs tensed up, becoming more defined. She glanced up at Gukhyun.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“Not pain… it’s just ticklish.”</p>
<p>Maybe it was the way he dragged out his words. It felt like he was whispering right next to her ear.</p>
<p>“Keep going.”</p>
<p>Click, the sound of a lighter’s flint being struck. Gukhyun lit a new cigarette and spoke.</p>
<p>“Just so you don’t misunderstand, it was self-defense.”</p>
<p>With the cigarette between his lips, his words sounded slightly muffled. His voice, slow and scraping like it was dragging through her insides, was incredibly low and relaxed.</p>
<p>It was the first time in her life that she found someone’s voice sexy, just hearing it sent shivers down her neck.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty easygoing as long as no one tries to climb over me first.”</p>
<p>Of course, he would be.</p>
<p>Heeju tossed the blood-stained tools into the trash and tidied up the area.</p>
<p>“I’m not misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>After all that, she felt utterly exhausted, as if her energy had been drained in an instant. She was barely holding onto the thread of consciousness that seemed ready to snap at any moment. The headache tightened around her head, growing more intense, and her mental clarity faded by the second.</p>
<p>She wanted to go upstairs and sleep as soon as possible. Ideally, without ever waking up again.</p>
<p>“For the next few days, make sure to disinfect and change the dressing daily, and try to keep it dry. Starting tomorrow, you can use a waterproof bandage and take a shower, but for tonight, it’s better to just wipe down and sleep, even if it feels a bit uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>Through the hazy cigarette smoke, their eyes met. His cheeks hollowed as he took another drag, then exhaled.</p>
<p>Normally, she hated the smell of cigarettes, but strangely, it didn’t bother her this time. In fact, seeing him smoke made it look quite appealing, which made her think that her mind was definitely messed up.</p>
<p>“Since the suturing was done in less than ideal conditions, the wound might get infected easily. Those are the main precautions. Do you have any other questions?”</p>
<p>His deep gray eyes seemed to study Heeju’s face intently before narrowing suddenly. Captivated by this strange change, she was caught off guard when Gukhyun asked in a languid tone.</p>
<p>“Can I still fu!ck?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Heeju looked at Gukhyun with a steady gaze. In the silence, Gukhyun casually rubbed over the dressing. His large hand, like a pot lid, showed prominent veins, and his fingers were long and straight.</p>
<p>With a playful smirk, he looked much younger than his initial rough impression. Thirty-two or thirty-three, perhaps? Maybe even younger.</p>
<p>Seeing that he had the energy to joke about such things, injuries like this were probably routine for him. Even if she told him not to, he probably wouldn’t listen anyway.</p>
<p>“If you’re confident the wound won’t reopen, do as you please. It’s none of my business.”</p>
<p>“You can just stitch it up again if it does.”</p>
<p>The man smiled, stretching his lips into a long grin. There it was again, that ominous smile.</p>
<p>“So, should I take that as permission?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun flicked the cigarette ash away, brought the cigarette to his lips, and extended his hand. Heeju’s gaze followed his hand a beat late.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing, right now?”</p>
<p>“You know, my d!’ck’s been hard since earlier. It’s about to burst now.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun grasped the outline of his erect length through his drawers.</p>
<p>“You should praise me for holding out this long.”</p>
<p>Heeju was momentarily speechless. She alternated her gaze between Gukhyun’s calm face and his blatantly erect p3n!s bulging under his underwear, as well as his relaxed hand casually stroking it.</p>
<p>“I’ve been hard ever since you started fumbling that knife around.”</p>
<p>She was aware that he was ar0u!s3d.</p>
<p>The peculiar tension crackling between them was charged with s3xu!@l tension—too obvious for her to miss, no matter how oblivious or naive she might pretend to be.</p>
