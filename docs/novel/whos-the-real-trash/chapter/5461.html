            <p><strong>Chapter 19.1</strong></p>
<p>“Ahk, what are you doing…? I told you to leave me alone, hnn…”</p>
<p>“You’re lying there with your h0l3 wide open and defenseless. It’s like you’re asking for more. This is it.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean, it’s just that I’m tired.”</p>
<p>Heeju frowned and reached down with her hand, intending to push away the annoying finger that was probing inside her. But instead, her wrist was caught and held by that hand.</p>
<p>“You’ve really lost all sense of fear.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun pulled Heeju’s hand and made her touch her own wet and slippery v@g!na. The area between her legs was so sl!ck it seemed like a flood had occurred. It was not just her fl.u!ds that were flowing out in a frightening amount, but also something else that filled her h0l3.</p>
<p>“When you’re messing around with another guy later, if someone tries to stick it in bare, I’ll kill him.”</p>
<p>Is that that something you would say after ej@c2lat!ng? Heeju looked at Gukhyun in disbelief. His absurdity was beyond imagination. Heeju had recently come to realize that when someone was too ridiculous, it could leave you speechless.</p>
<p>“I might just do that.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun’s p-n!s still wasn’t tucked back into his pants and was a mess with s3m’n stuck to it, dripping down the shaft. He grasped the base of his m3mb-r and tapped his stiff shaft against her v@g!na.</p>
<p>“I’m worried you’ll go somewhere and spread your legs without fear. Do you know how many trash there are in the world?”</p>
<p>“Is this a confession?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun’s m3mb-r was excessively thick and long, and when compared to Heeju’s pelvis, its girth felt even more pronounced. It was no wonder she was completely drained of energy, with no strength left in her body, considering that thing had been moving in and out of her.</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen a gentle trash like me?”</p>
<p>His tone was both affectionate and scolding. His m3mb-r that had been stabbing past her lower abdomen to her upper abdomen was still standing er*ct even after one round of ej@cul-t!on, its veins bulging with anger.</p>
<p>“If I had really acted like trash, I would have eaten you up to the bones right here.”</p>
<p>He was growling savagely, as if he needed to dig into her h0l3 again to relieve his frustration. But instead of thr#$ting roughly, he was gently rubbing the head of his m3mb-r around the entrance of her v@g!na, which made him seem slightly kind…</p>
<p>“You’re so skinny and trying to starve yourself to death, so I’m just filling your belly with c*m.”</p>
<p>He pulled up Heeju’s knit top again.</p>
<p>“Are you full now?”</p>
<p>His hand, which was caressing her flat and soft lower abdomen, was both sinister and gentle at the same time.</p>
<p>“Should I say thank you?”</p>
<p>“It’s not time for thanks yet, since it’s still flat. Maybe I’ll accept your gratitude when your belly is nice and round.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun brushed his fingertips against her v@g!na, coating them with s3m’n and her fl.u!ds, then smeared them on Heeju’s lower abdomen. Although it was a bit disgusting, Heeju just let him do as he pleased. The gentle touch gliding over her relaxed body actually felt quite pleasant.</p>
<p>“You’ll be cute if you got pregnant.”</p>
<p><em>Does he think pregnancy can happen to just anyone?</em> Heeju didn’t bother responding to his frivolous comment. Instead, she pushed away Gukhyun’s hand, which was teasing her belly, and sat up. Just that small movement made her waist wobble unsteadily.</p>
<p>“My clothes?”</p>
<p>“This?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun picked up the pants and Heeju’s p@nt!es, which were tangled together on the floor. Heeju held out her hand, but instead of handing over the p@nt!es, Gukhyun stuffed them into his own pocket.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Give them back.”</p>
<p>“Give me my p@nt!es, please.”</p>
<p>“…Give me my p@nt!es.”</p>
<p>“You’re telling me to do it? You have no pride?”</p>
<p>“What pride could I possibly have over a single pair of p@nt!es?”</p>
<p>“I’ll wipe you down below, so open your h0l3 with your hand.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun pulled out a handkerchief from the inside pocket of his jacket. It was somewhat unexpected to see a neatly folded handkerchief come out of a pocket that seemed like it could be hiding a weapon.</p>
<p>“You’re making a mess everywhere.”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who did it on purpose.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m going to take care of the aftermath. Open up, so I can see inside.”</p>
<p>“Stop it. What’s up with this? You’re a pervert.”</p>
<p>“Are you embarrassed?”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“A person who’s completely naked from the waist down and only wearing socks?”</p>
<p>As who was perverted between Gukhyun, who’s fully dressed except for his exposed g3n!ta@@ls, and Heeju, with her legs spread wide and her v@g!na exposed covered in fl.u!ds, and only wearing socks—Heeju definitely thought she was more outrageous. His words were subtly accurate which was annoying.</p>
