            <p><b>Chapter 27.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gukhyun, positioning Heeju by the window, asked with an unconcerned expression,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Someone might pass by. If someone sees from outside…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike Gukhyun, who had his d!c&lt; hanging out, Heeju was naked except for a br.@. Moreover, her br3@sts were sticking out of her b.r@ that she might as well have been completely n@!&lt;3d.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing by the window in such a v</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">lg@r state, where anyone could see, made her head spin. Amidst the anxiety and embarrassment, a strange, p3Rv</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">rs.e pleasure surged up that was the exactly opposite of rationality, causing her to panic. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Am I really this p3rv#rt*.d?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Should I call the kids and show them what we’re doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gukhyun’s languid voice was almost seductive. He grasped Heeju’s thigh and lifted it up. She felt the cool air touch the opening between her legs. A trickle of @r0*s@L flowed down her thigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hngh, no.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heeju shook her head. But soon, her other thigh was also caught by him. The tip of his d!c&lt; pressed firmly against her twitching p^s.sy. Kwon Gukhyun was really planning to do it here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How do you think it would be if I showed them my d!c&lt; going in and out of your cute little p^ss.y?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gukhyun inserted his arm into the inside of Heeju’s knee and spread her legs wide apart. Her legs were splayed open like a frog’s, and her toes were wiggling in the air. No matter how pitifully she struggled, her body was completely restrained, unable to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll show them everything that goes in and out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wet h0l3, exposed between her legs, greedily opened wide, trying to swallow his d!c&lt;. The tip of his penis was barely inside, and it seemed to be devouring him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I don’t want to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this state, the only thing she could do was to be p!3r.c#d by him in a b3@st-l!ke posture. Fear and a p3rv#rt*.d sense of anticipation flooded her. Heeju trembled with dismay, tightly grasping Gukhyun’s arm. It was ironic that in this situation, the only person she could rely on was Gukhyun. But if she didn’t do this, she felt like she would completely collapse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You say you don’t want to, but you’re squeezing me tighter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gukhyun, with the tip of his d!c&lt; still lodged at the entrance, finally thrxst it in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha- eungh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heeju sobbed as she clutched Gukhyun’s arm. The thick sh@f.t of his d!c&lt; scraped against the f0lds of her !nn3r w@ll.s, pushing its way in. Heeju’s head lolled forward, her mind reeling from the overwhelming excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your sl*tty p^s#sy is lying. You’re overflowing, baby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah- eung, haa, hnghh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where did you learn to be so naughty?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saliva dripped from her parted lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This little thing keeps acting up. Am I your friend?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hnggghn…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wanted to respond, but she was panting so hard she couldn’t think straight. Gukhyun whispered sweetly as his d!c&lt; pound3d into her ut3r*s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you call me baby, I’ll let you off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to. Hnggh, eung, I won’t do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How naughty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gukhyun rubbed the area where their nether regions were joined, thrxsting his d!c&lt; in wildly. It made her feel much more connected with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her !nn3r fl3.sh was crushed and p0u.Nd3d until it was s0.ft and m^s-hy. The squelching sounds grew louder. The w3t, tangled mucous membranes r*b.b3d against each other, causing a terrifying thrill. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">More, more, more, more. Thrxst harder.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if someone outside saw her in this v^lg.@r state, she felt like she couldn’t stop. Her rationality was reduced to a thin thread, overwhelmed by the sensation of nothingness, and she ended up loving the feel of Gukhyun’s d!c&lt; thrxs.t!ng into her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, good, right there- ah, ahn, hnggh, eeung, haaang!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like it here? Should I thr-xst harder?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmph! Hngghn, haaaa…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gukhyun grasped Heeju’s thigh, holding it firmly in place, and th.rxst his d!c&lt; into her with a force similar to drilling. Every time he pushed his lower body into her, her body would jerk upward, and when he pulled out, it would fall back down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her br3@sts bounced l.3wdly as he rapidly moved in and out. Even the heavy, soft flesh of her br3@sts swaying back and forth added to the stimulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, eung, stop, angh, don’t wanna, it’s weird, stop there, haa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heeju, on the verge of cl!m.@x, begged as she rubbed her head against Gukhyun’s shoulder. But Gukhyun increased his pace even more. He too was struggling to hold back his own 0rg@-sm, his jaw clenched and a vein bulging on his forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C.*m first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment his low, husky voice caressed her earlobe, Heeju’s watery eyes rolled back. The cl!m@x that had been building up 3r*p-ted in her stomach.</span></p>
