            <p><strong>Chapter 5.1</strong></p>
<p>Heeju found it unnerving how Gukhyun pretended to care while his real goal was just to get paid.</p>
<p>“If someone falls down, you’re supposed to carry them gently to their room.”</p>
<p>“I would have missed a good show if I did that. You were moaning and crying like a baby all night.”</p>
<p>He saw her crying pathetically. Heeju bit the inside of her lip. Another reason to want to die added to her list, not that she could die on her own terms anymore.</p>
<p>“Seems like meeting your dead sister in your dreams was pretty awesome. You slept like a log, even when I came on your face.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun’s lips curled up into a wicked, suggestive smile.</p>
<p>Feeling a sense of dread, Heeju touched her cheek. Her entire face was wet. When she checked her palm, the moisture was just clear.</p>
<p>…It was tears.</p>
<p>“You actually believe that.”</p>
<p>With a narrowed eyes, Gukhyun suddenly leaned his upper body towards Heeju. He rested his forehead on her shoulder and chuckled softly. A gentle vibration traveled through their touch.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you’re so naive.”</p>
<p>Their eyes met, and Heeju realized that the man’s eyes, which she had thought were a dull gray, were actually a complex mix of black, blue, and deep green.</p>
<p>Gukhyun leaned in, his tongue tracing a long path from Heeju’s cheek to her temple.<br>
Every spot his tongue touched sent shivers down her spine.</p>
<p>“… What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Heeju’s voice was stiff, but Gukhyun just smiled, his eyes gleaming with amusement.</p>
<p>“I can taste the sweetness in your tears.”</p>
<p>“Are you a pervert?”</p>
<p>“Every time we make eye contact, you always compliment me. But that won’t cancel your debt.”</p>
<p>It’s not a compliment, you crazy bastard.</p>
<p>Heeju’s eyes conveyed her thoughts, but Gukhyun just grinned as if he was enjoying himself. Their faces were close. She could feel his breath lazily spreading over her lips.</p>
<p>His eyes moved slowly, like a predator examining its prey. They passed over her eyes and nose, lingering on her lips. The ticking of the clock sounded excessively loud.</p>
<p>“Innocent yet seductive.”</p>
<p>At some point, his gaze moved to her neck. Her skin, damp with cold sweat, clung to her hair. Gukhyun pressed his nose against the spot where her pulse beat visibly.</p>
<p>“Enticing.”</p>
<p>She felt him inhale deeply, taking in her scent. It must smell like sweat… but it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>He was a man who exuded danger at a glance. Moreover, he displayed his s3xu1@l desire without any hesitation. It would be natural to feel repulsed by such an unusual man’s behavior, yet strangely, she didn’t feel the urge to stop him.</p>
<p>Under his languid gaze, she sensed a hidden brutality, as if he might suddenly bite into her neck. It didn’t seem like a bad idea. Should she offer her throat more? As she entertained these silly thoughts, a sense of unease crept in. Heeju placed her hands on Gukhyun’s shoulders and pushed him back, speaking.</p>
<p>“But you smell nice, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I hear that a lot.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun attempted to bury his nose in the nape of Heeju’s neck once more, but she pushed him away again.</p>
<p>“Did you wash up?”</p>
<p>Staggering backward, Heeju parted the gown’s collar, which wrapped around Gukhyun’s body. Sure enough, the dressing over the wound was soaked through.</p>
<p>“I told you to keep it dry.”</p>
<p>“Did you? I was too turned on to listen.”</p>
<p>Heeju pressed down hard on the wound. Any normal person would have screamed in pain, but Gukhyun just smirked wickedly.</p>
<p>“Pressing like that only turns me on.”</p>
<p>How could someone be so perverted with every word they spoke? She didn’t have the energy to respond to every l31wd comment.</p>
<p>“Lie down straight on the bed. I need to disinfect the wound.”</p>
<p>“You keep telling me to lie down. It makes me excited.”</p>
<p>Insensitive to pain but shameless about his desires, Gukhyun was an enigma. Usually, sensitivity to pain and pleasure go hand in hand, but he was an exception. As Heeju carefully removed the dressing, she sighed audibly.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>Why did he even bother getting stitches if he was going to neglect it like this? She couldn’t shake the suspicion that he was just trying to make her life difficult. Heeju opened a drawer, took out a medical kit, and treated the festering wound.</p>
<p>“From now on, use waterproof bandages when you shower. Don’t forget to disinfect the wound every time you change the dressing.”</p>
<p>“You talk like it’s someone else’s job. You’re the one who has to do it now.”</p>
<p>Heeju looked up at Gukhyun.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“My doctor’s position has been vacant since yesterday. I like your handiwork, Ko Heeju.”</p>
