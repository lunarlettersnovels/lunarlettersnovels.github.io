            <p><strong>Chapter 25.1</strong></p>
<p>Thwack!</p>
<p>With a sound like a watermelon being smashed, Giju’s body floated and flew away like straw. The blow to the jaw knocked him unconscious and he landed at the corner of the swimming pool.</p>
<p>Bubbles formed in his mouth. His body, twisted in a strange direction, convulsed. Even in his unconscious state, he coughed and writhed.</p>
<p>“Kwon Gukhyun!”</p>
<p>Seokchan shouted in horror. At the shriek-like scream, Heeju, who was being dragged away by Yunam, quickly turned around.</p>
<p>Seokchan was clutching his head in disbelief. Gukhyun, who had been standing at the edge of the swimming pool, went down below with light motions. Now, only Gukhyun’s upper body could be seen from where Heeju was standing.</p>
<p>As Gukhyun leisurely walked over and bent down, a sound like a pig’s throat being slit echoed.</p>
<p>“Eueo, keoheok…”</p>
<p>Giju, who clutched his stomach like a pill bug, vomited blood. The fist that struck his abdomen gave him pain as if it were piercing through his stomach.</p>
<p>“Hyu, hyung… Just a moment.”</p>
<p>It would have been more comfortable to remain unconscious, but Giju, who finally regained consciousness, grabbed Gukhyun’s sleeve and squirmed.</p>
<p>“Wa, wait… Stop. I, I’m strange, I…”</p>
<p>His pupils shook, unable to find their way. He gagged as if he were about to vomit, then made a gurgling sound and dropped his head.</p>
<p>He quickly realized that it would be more comfortable to faint. Bubbles of blood flowed from the corners of his gaping mouth.</p>
<p>“Gukhyun, Gukhyun, stop it. Let’s stop. Giju will die like this. You have to think about the Chairman, the Chairman.”</p>
<p>Seokchan, who somehow followed him down, grabbed Gukhyun’s waist. Gukhyun sighed with annoyance and grabbed Seokchan’s neck.</p>
<p>Hieeik. Seokchan was horrified and raised his arms, putting up a guard in front of his face. Gukhyun looked at him with contempt and threw him away like an insect.</p>
<p>“Euheuk, keuk…”</p>
<p>Seokchan, who was slammed into the corner of the swimming pool, let out a faint groan and then became quiet. He was a bastard who cherished his own body like a treasure. It was clear that he was pretending to be unconscious, but Gukhyun left Seokchan alone and turned his head.</p>
<p>And then he grabbed Giju’s collar, who was sprawled out like a corpse, and lifted him up. Inside the tightly closed eyelids, his pupils were moving madly.</p>
<p>“Giju, wake up.”</p>
<p>A hand like a pot lid slapped his blood-stained cheek. Smack! Smack! As his facial skin was kneaded like dough, a crunching sound echoed. His cheeks, which turned bright red and beyond, turned purple as all the blood vessels burst.</p>
<p>“Euheoeok! Keoeok!”</p>
<p>As if forcibly dragged from the world of unconsciousness, Giju made a strange, grotesque sound and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m awake, I’m awake. Hyung, hyung, Gukhyun hyung…”</p>
<p>Thick blood flowed from his open mouth.</p>
<p>“Hyung, I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong.”</p>
<p>Giju knelt, trembling. One of his ankles was twisted in a strange direction, but perhaps because there was no part of his already battered body that didn’t hurt, he wasn’t even aware of it.</p>
<p>“I won’t tell Dad. I won’t tell him. Hueu, heu…. I’ll bury everything and go. Please, just forgive me once.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun shook off the blood on his palm with annoyance.</p>
<p>“I’ll beg like this. I’m an idiot. It’s because I’m a shitty bastard. Huh? Hyung. It really hurts, it hurts so much I feel like I’m going to die. Huuk…”</p>
<p>The sight of him sniveling and rubbing his hands together was no different from a child. An ordinary person might feel a little sorry or pitiful, but Gukhyun’s eyes, looking down at Giju, were only cold.</p>
<p>His pupils were emotionless, and his breathing was uncharacteristically steady for someone who had just beaten a man to a pulp.</p>
<p>Am I going to die? Am I going to die here?</p>
<p>Giju felt a distinct sense of fear. In his consciousness, which was brightening and darkening as if he were about to faint at any moment, he had a premonition that Kwon Gukhyun would eventually cut off his breath.</p>
<p>Ah, so that’s why.</p>
<p>When he asked why his father hated Kwon Gukhyun, this is why.</p>
<p>The moment the dog, who was so reliable when he was on the same side, revealed his cruel nature towards him, an intense fear that he had never felt before constricted his entire body like a tremor.</p>
<p>My father already knew that a dog, who had been loyal and obedient to him all his life, was a dangerous element who would one day rebel.</p>
