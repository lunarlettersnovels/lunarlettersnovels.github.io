            <p><strong>Chapter 10.1</strong></p>
<p>Gukhyun came over to the sofa and plopped down. His coat and jacket were nowhere to be seen, leaving him in just a thin shirt.</p>
<p>“Do I need your permission to look like a ghost?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s annoying.”</p>
<p>He finds a lot of things annoying, doesn’t he? Heeju grumbled inwardly. White breath escaped from between her lips.</p>
<p>“Enough of that. Come here quickly.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>When Heeju didn’t budge.</p>
<p>“Or should I come to you? Is it more thrilling to suck c0`ck outdoors?”</p>
<p>Heeju frowned, wondering what he was suddenly talking about. Then she remembered what had happened in the morning. A tingling sensation spread under her tongue.</p>
<p>“Who said I’d suck you?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that why you were waiting?”</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>“Got my hopes up for nothing.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun shrugged as if it can’t be helped. He spread his arms wide over the back of the sofa and stared at Heeju.</p>
<p>“Then why the hell are you acting like that?”</p>
<p>His snake-like, fierce gaze slowly scanned Heeju from her pale cheeks to her wind-tossed hair, her slender shoulders, down to her waist, legs, and finally her fidgeting toes.</p>
<p>“Can’t sleep?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, I can help.”</p>
<p>Gukhyeon’s lips curled into a lazy, dangerous smirk. It was a seductive, suggestive smile that left no room for doubt about the kind of help he was offering. How should she respond?</p>
<p>The decision didn’t take long. Heeju took a step forward. Her frozen toes pressing against the cold floor felt strangely unfamiliar. She figured this was better—less pathetic than wallowing in solitude.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what she told herself. Maybe, just maybe, she’d finally fall into a deep sleep, just as he promised.</p>
<p>Behind her, the balcony door clicked shut. As the room’s warmth enveloped her, her body thawed instantly. Her ears buzzed as if submerged underwater, and her mind turned hazy.</p>
<p>It was the perfect state for making reckless decisions.</p>
<p>Heeju staggered toward the sofa. Gukhyun sat sprawled out, his back resting at an angle, thighs spread wide in an almost arrogant pose. As she placed her hand on his thigh, leaning forward to settle herself between his legs, Gukhyun abruptly grabbed her arm.</p>
<p>“Why are you going down?”</p>
<p>“…Didn’t you say to be quick?”</p>
<p>“You want to suck it so badly? Running over here barefoot and all.”</p>
<p>Heeju glanced down at her feet. Her once-frozen toes were now swollen and red, stark against the room’s warmth. In contrast, the man was still wearing his shoes, even indoors.</p>
<p>What is he? Is he some kind of American?</p>
<p>The thought flitted through her mind, but before she could dwell on it, Gukhyun pulled her closer, guiding her to sit squarely on his lap. The hard press of something beneath her made her stiffen. How long had he been like this?</p>
<p>Gukhyun’s hands slid to her hips, pressing her down firmly as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Do you think my c0!ck’s pretty?”</p>
<p>The outline of it pressed and rubbed between her thighs. A dull, pulsing ache spread through her groin, resonating like a slow throb. Was this how bodies worked?</p>
<p>Even in her lethargy—too drained to lift a spoon or even care—her body’s immediate reaction to ar0us@1l was almost laughable. The human body was absurd like that.</p>
<p>“Looks pretty gross, honestly.”</p>
<p>“Maybe so, but it tastes amazing.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun grinned with smug confidence as his hands gripped her bottom, kneading firmly. Even through the layers of fabric, the sensation was enough to send shivers down her spine.</p>
<p>“Problem is,” he murmured with a sly twist of his lips, “I’ve got a mean streak. The more you want to suck it, the less I want to give it to you.”</p>
<p>The firm length of him dragged against her, the thick ridge grinding slowly but insistently. She gasped, a hot breath escaping her parted lips.</p>
<p>“Fine, then forget it. I won’t—hmmphf…!”</p>
<p>“Lie down.” His voice was low and commanding. “I want to suck you first.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun’s hands, kneading her bu!t.t0cks with pressure, suddenly shifted to her shoulders. The room spun as her vision blurred, and in one swift, forceful motion, he pushed her back onto the sofa.</p>
<p>Her pants and underwear were yanked down in a single, fluid motion and discarded in a heap that he carelessly tossed beneath the sofa. Picking up the remote, Gukhyun turned on the room’s lights. A stark, white glow poured down from the ceiling.</p>
