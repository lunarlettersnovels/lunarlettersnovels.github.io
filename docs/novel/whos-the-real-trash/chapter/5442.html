            <p><strong>Chapter 28.2</strong></p>
<p>Yunam stared silently at Heeju’s face for a moment. The man’s eyes, visible through his silver-rimmed glasses, were calm and composed.</p>
<p>“That’s not something Ms. o Heeju needs to worry about. Please focus on the Executive Director’s recovery.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Ah, and this is just out of concern.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“You were lucky today. I’m talking about you interfering when the Executive Director was angry. Don’t do something so dangerous. If you value your life.”</p>
<p>Heeju didn’t answer Yunam’s words and turned her head away. It seemed like the people here didn’t remember that she had jumped into the sea to die and was forcibly brought back. Judging by that kind of advice.</p>
<p>The door clicked shut. The sound of footsteps faded away.</p>
<p>Heeju used the remote to dim the lights. The light emanating from the lamp created a subtle shadow along Gukhyun’s nose. Kwon Gukhyun, who was quietly asleep with his eyes closed, looked peaceful and docile, not like the tyrant who had beaten someone to a pulp just a few hours ago.</p>
<p>“That guy is the son of the chairman of a gangster company, right? He seemed to have a nasty personality, so why did you do that? What if he goes to his dad and tells on you? Is there really nothing you’re afraid of?”</p>
<p>Heeju mumbled to herself, resting her chin on her hand. Even if that were the case, it wasn’t really her business, as Yunam had said.</p>
<p>She couldn’t understand why her body had moved on its own at that moment, why she had suddenly interfered when she had nothing to do with it, even when she thought about it herself. All she could say was that it was meddling with a death wish.</p>
<p>“Why did I do that?”</p>
<p>‘Am I guilty because it felt like I started it?’</p>
<p>At first, she was glad Gukhyun had appeared. Kwon Giju was the type she never wanted to deal with, and she wanted to avoid the situation, but she didn’t think he would let her go easily.</p>
<p>So when Gukhyun appeared, she was definitely glad to see him. She thought he would get her out of that unpleasant situation.</p>
<p>‘But what about the moment when I realized that he might actually kill the man?’</p>
<p>Heeju reached her arm back and massaged her throbbing back.</p>
<p>There must be a bruise where she’d hit the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p>She laughed at the thought of having s2.x like there was no tomorrow without realizing it. Especially with a guy who was seriously injured.</p>
<p>It was truly amazing that he didn’t collapse during s2.x, considering he was lifting someone into the air and moving his body like that when his shoulder might have been destroyed. It’s strange that he didn’t go into shock.</p>
<p>Heeju quietly looked at Gukhyun’s sleeping face. Perhaps it was because of the dimly cast shadows, but he looked somehow strangely somber.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, her hand reached out. Then, she suddenly stopped her hand midway and clenched her fist tightly, lowering it down. Her fleeting heart was confused.</p>
<p>Why was it that seeing this man lying there as if he were dead suddenly made her remember the first time she had s2.3x with him?</p>
<p>“Here you are, doing this again.”</p>
<p>“Can’t take my eyes off you. So annoying.”</p>
<p>“… you have a habit of collapsing anywhere and everywhere.”</p>
<p>Back then, she thought he was a terribly reckless man, so uninhibited that he would hook up anywhere, regardless of time or place. She, who would gasp for breath just from smelling the air in the autopsy room, was so caught up in him that she couldn’t come to her senses. As if he had blown out her trauma out of the water.</p>
<p>“Remember.”</p>
<p>“This is the feeling of my c<em>ck spreading your p</em>ssy open.”</p>
<p>“From now on, when you come here, you’ll only rem3mb3r fu.2ck!ng with me.”</p>
<p>The low, muffled voice that had pierced her eardrums like a needle and left a lingering resonance echoed in her mind. Heeju growned slightly and rubbed her chest. The underside of her chest tingled.</p>
<p>Was he trying to comfort her in his own way…?</p>
<p>A listless, mocking laugh escaped her lips. She felt half-ridiculous and half-self-loathing, wondering if she was reading too much into it.</p>
<p>Maybe she’d been so lonely and isolated since her sister’s death that she’d allowed unnecessary emotions to grow wildly towards the man she was physically intimate with…</p>
<p>It was clear that she had enjoyed the s2.3x with him. Although it had started with a self-destructive mindset, the s2.3x with him was extremely stimulating, and she loved the sensations that made her forget about her sh1tt!y reality. But now….</p>
<p>When she saw the man bleeding profusely and collapsing, her heart sunk, and her vision turned white. When she thought that he might kill Kwon Giju, she felt the same way. She was scared that something might happen to him.</p>
<p>How could she explain this feeling she had now?</p>
<p>If she asked herself if she felt the same way as she did in the beginning, she wouldn’t know how to answer. Her ambiguous emotions and the mood that was rising and falling on its own were confusing her mind.</p>
<p>“I’m really losing it.”</p>
<p>As she muttered this to herself, a deep fatigue washed over her.</p>
<p>She wasn’t sure if she was talking to Kwon Gukhyun or herself. Perhaps it was both.</p>
