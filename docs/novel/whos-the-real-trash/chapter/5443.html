            <p><strong>Chapter 28.1</strong></p>
<p>Seeing Gukhyun’s condition, Yunam didn’t seem surprised. Instead, he had an expression that seemed to say, “This was bound to happen.” It was clear that he already knew about Gukhyun’s injury.</p>
<p>Heeju found it difficult to understand either the man who would have s3.x despite being injured or the man who knew about it but quietly stepped aside without stopping him.</p>
<p>‘Without knowing anything, while happily having s3.x until the man suddenly collapsed, only I was the fool who was terrified. Only me.’</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t we take him to the hospital?” Yunam asked. Heeju checked Gukhyun’s temperature with a thermometer. He had a slight fever, but it wasn’t critical.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, we have everything we need here, so I’ve taken all the necessary emergency measures. It looks like he was hit with something like a nail-studded plank, is that right?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, something like that.”</p>
<p>Yunam answered shakily, as if he didn’t want to go into the details of what had happened. Since she was only there as a doctor to treat the wound, Heeju didn’t ask any further questions. Besides, she doubted he would tell her anything even if she did ask.</p>
<p>Instead, she pictured Gukhyun on the stage at the Korea University Medical School donation ceremony, shaking hands politely with the professors. He acted like a decent businessman who did a lot of good deeds, but behind the scenes, he was involved in a world where people wielded nail-studded planks.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the condition of the nails, but based on the marks left on his skin, there’s a risk of tetanus, so I gave him an immune globulin shot. I also administered antibiotics intravenously. Since he lost blood, it’s best to give him IV fluids as well.”</p>
<p>Heeju pointed to the IV drip that was steadily dripping at a constant rate near his head.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to monitor his progress, but I think he’ll be fine after a good night’s sleep, as long as the wound is properly cared for.”</p>
<p>Yunam rubbed his face with a relieved expression.</p>
<p>“The bruises are also quite severe, so he’ll probably be in more pain tomorrow. Depending on his condition, we can use painkillers or muscle relaxants, but that’s something we’ll have to decide once he regains consciousness.”</p>
<p>“You’ve worked hard. I’ll stay by the Executive Director’s side, so Ms. Ko Heeju, please go upstairs and get some rest. You must have been very shocked today.”</p>
<p>At Yunam’s words, Heeju looked down at the sleeping Gukhyun for a moment. Her tingling fingertips trembled slightly. Her body had been heavy with extreme fatigue for some time.</p>
<p>The events at the swimming pool, the intense s.3x, and the unexpected situation that followed had already pushed her mental strength to its limit. But even if she went back to her room alone, would she be able to sleep peacefully?</p>
<p>Heeju turned to Yunam and said.</p>
<p>“I’ll just stay here. His condition might worsen suddenly.”</p>
<p>“Then call me if anything unusual happens. I’ll be outside.”</p>
<p>Yunam, who had turned and was heading towards the door, stopped midway as if he had remembered something.</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way, how did you end up being with Director Yoon and Kwon Giju earlier?”</p>
<p>Heeju recalled what had happened at headquarters. It had only been a few hours ago, but it strangely felt like days had passed.</p>
<p>“I ran into them on the first floor of headquarters. Director Yoon knew that I was the Executive Director’s personal doctor, and since there was someone injured, he asked me to take a look. When I went, that was the situation.”</p>
<p>“Did you go to headquarters alone?”</p>
<p>The atmosphere somehow turned into an interrogation. Heeju quietly looked at Yunam. Yunam silently waited for Heeju’s answer, as if urging her to speak.</p>
<p>Yes, from Yunam’s perspective, that was understandable. Because of that, the person he served had been put in a very difficult situation today. But Heeju couldn’t help but feel her voice stiffen.</p>
<p>“No, I went with Kang Sungang, but when I came out of the physical therapy room, he was gone. He said he had received a call and had to go somewhere urgently, so I was on my way back alone.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Yunam sighed softly and took off the glasses he was wearing. Then, he tiredly rubbed his forehead.</p>
<p>“Sungang was on the move after receiving the news, so he couldn’t keep an eye on you. I should have prepared for that.”</p>
<p>After letting out a long sigh, Yunam met Heeju’s eyes and said, “It was my mistake.”</p>
<p>Heeju’s eyes flickered slightly. Contrary to her expectation that he would be displeased with her for making the situation worse, saying that the situation wouldn’t have happened if she hadn’t been there, she felt strange when he said it was his mistake.</p>
<p>Yunam put his glasses back on, turned around, and said, “It must have been difficult. I’ll make sure that doesn’t happen again. Get some rest.”</p>
<p>“That guy named Kwon Giju.”</p>
<p>Yunam, who was about to open the door and leave, turned back to Heeju again.</p>
<p>“How did it go?”</p>
<p>“He was taken to the hospital. His ankle will be a problem, but otherwise, he should be fine. He tends to exaggerate a lot.”</p>
<p>“I heard he’s the chairman’s son…”</p>
<p><em>Am I the reason he’s in trouble?</em> She swallowed the unspoken words.</p>
