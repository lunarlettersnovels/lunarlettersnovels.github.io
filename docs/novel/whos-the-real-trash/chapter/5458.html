            <p><strong>Chapter 20.2</strong></p>
<p>Not content with just being fully inserted, Gukhyun used his hard gL,@ns to stimulate Heeju’s c3rv!x, grinding and thr#$t!ng inside her. Heeju’s body, which had never known a man before, was tightly stretched to accommodate Gukhyun’s m#mb3r, and with each thr#$t, a clear liquid splashed out from the entrance, which was clenched shut.</p>
<p>It feels good. It feels good. It feels good.</p>
<p>Through her melting consciousness, Gukhyun lazily warned her.</p>
<p>“So, it’s better if you give up on the idea of trying another man’s c0.ck for a while.”</p>
<p>“Mmmh! Ah, ah! Ah!”</p>
<p>The surging pleasure was frightening. Gukhyun completely restrained Heeju, who was trembling all over, and thr#$t his throbbing c[0.ck inside her.</p>
<p>“Fv.ck… it’s f2.ck!ng tight. Relax down there.”</p>
<p>“I’m not tensing up, huu, uhn… ah!”</p>
<p>“Are you going to keep pushing your hips down? Align your p<em>$$y h</em>l3 straight.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun seemed annoyed, and he pulled Heeju’s knit top over her head and threw it away. Now, in the car parked in an unknown location, Heeju was completely na!.k3d.</p>
<p>Unlike Gukhyun, who was mostly fully clothed except for his exposed m#mb3r, Heeju had nothing on except for a sock that was precariously clinging to her ankle.</p>
<p>“This innocent baby… what’s gotten into you?”</p>
<p>“Nnnggh, ah, stop there. Hmmh!”</p>
<p>“Is it here? Do you like it here?”</p>
<p>“N-no. It’s wei-weird, euung, haa!”</p>
<p>The sound of flesh slapping against flesh grew louder, and the heavy car rocked back and forth in sync with Gukhyun’s rough hip movements. The impact of the uneven rhythm made their union even deeper. The car window fogged up with white mist.</p>
<p>With their upper bodies completely entwined, he continued to relentlessly thr#$t his lower body, and poured out a torrent of crude and intense s<em>x. The relentless pounding of his m#mb3r made it impossible for her to think anymore. Every time his firm t3st!c</em>s struck her pubic area, saliva dripped from her open mouth.</p>
<p>“Spread your legs wider.”</p>
<p>Yes, yes. Heeju clung to Gukhyun’s neck, her legs trembling, and spread them wide.</p>
<p>“I’ll come inside you.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“I hope the verdict today has brought you some comfort.”</p>
<p>In court, the lawyers had seemed confident, but in the end, the defendant was found guilty of attempted murder due to reckless negligence. However, the fact that the defendant had been drunk at the time of the incident and had a weakened state of mind, and that they had shown remorse by writing daily reflection papers and had made efforts to restore the damage by paying a large bail, were all taken into consideration as mitigating factors. As a result, the defendant was ultimately sentenced to 6 years in prison. Heeju went to the sea that day.</p>
<p>That criminal will live a peaceful and safe life behind bars. Heeju didn’t know what to do now, and everything felt uncertain and bleak. She felt resentful and angry towards her sister, who had left her behind.</p>
<p><strong><em>Whoosh, whoosh.</em></strong></p>
<p>The rough sea kept pushing Heeju’s body towards the shore. She trudged through the waves, struggling to make her way in.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gurgle gurgle.</em></strong></p>
<p>Just as the seawater was about to fill her lungs and choke her, she saw a pair of ash-gray eyes in front of her.</p>
<p><em>Uh…?</em></p>
<p>“Hey, snap out of it.”</p>
<p>Where had she seen him before?</p>
<p>“It’s a little awkward to die like this…”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Mmh….”</p>
<p>Heeju woke up from her dream, drenched in cold sweat. The blanket covering her body was also soaked. She lay there, staring blankly, waiting for her mind to clear, before slowly getting up.</p>
<p>As the blanket slid down, her bare body was revealed. Heeju brushed back her disheveled hair. As she vaguely recalled her last memory, a s3ns8al scene unfolded in her mind.</p>
<p>Last night, she had been on all fours on the sofa, taking a man’s c[0.ck from behind. As he trembled and c.@me inside her, Heeju had also reached her cl!m2ax. She savored the warmth spreading through her lower abdomen, and then her consciousness faded away.</p>
<p>It always ended like this every time she had s*x with Gukhyun. He interfered with her eating habits so much that she had been eating more lately, and she thought her physical strength had increased, but it seemed that he had exhausted her to the point where she couldn’t take it anymore.</p>
<p>Gukhyun had carried her from the sofa to the bed while she was unconscious. Heeju got out of bed, staggering, and as soon as she put her feet on the floor, something dripped down from between her legs.</p>
<p>It must be s*m3n, after all.</p>
<p>After she and Gukhyun first had s*x at the research lab, he would come to her room or call her to his room every night, as if it was only natural.</p>
<p><em>It’s been about two weeks, or maybe three?</em> She didn’t keep track of the days, so she wasn’t sure. Anyway, except for the days when Gukhyun was away from the mansion, they probably had s2*x every day.</p>
