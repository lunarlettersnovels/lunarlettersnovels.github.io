            <p><b>Chapter 34.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon closer inspection, Giju’s cheek bore a bruise in the shape of a large hand, like a pot lid that had been slapped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just called that woman over for a quick chat, and he flipped out like this. I can guarantee you, if he gets married, that b@st#r.d will be the type to develop morbid jealousy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jungman’s eyes narrowed oddly as he silently listened to Giju’s words. Leaning on his cane, he fell into thought before asking in a low voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where did you meet her, and how?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, dad. From what I found out previously, she has some kind of debt relationship with Director Kwon…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joo-ah immediately responded. By the time she heard that Kwon Gukhyun had suddenly changed his attending physician to a young woman, she had already gathered at least a basic profile on her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Joo-ah recalled the photo saved on her phone and was about to pull it out of her pocket, Seokchan suddenly interrupted the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will look into the nature of her relationship with Director Kwon in detail and report back, Chairman.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joo-ah shot a glare at Seokchan, who was interrupting her, but he maintained his polite attitude and continued speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s important isn’t how she became the attending physician, but what their current relationship is. Given what happened yesterday, Director Kwon will likely react more sensitively, so I’ll quietly investigate for now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right. To catch a cunning mutt, we need to be cautious too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jungman nodded slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That could be a good bait. If they really are dating, that is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As each of them pondered their thoughts, Giju pouted and grumbled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Am I really supposed to just take this lying down? What about my pride, which is being trampled on like trash on the floor? This is just too much! No one cares about how hurt I am. Everyone just keeps talking about Kwon Gukhyun, Kwon Gukhyun, Kwon Gukhyun…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giju lay back on the bed, turning his body toward the wall and crossing his arms. His entire body was sulking, and Jungman looked at his immature youngest son with disappointment. He pressed his forehead and clicked his tongue. He gave a meaningful glance at Seokchan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While he’s in the hospital, make sure to give him something he likes. There are parties and things to distract him. We don’t want him getting riled up and causing trouble again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, Chairman. I will take good care of Giju.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heeju tossed and turned in her sleep, as if she were being pressed down by something. The bed felt unusually restless. Unconsciously twisting her waist, she finally sensed something ominous and abruptly opened her eyelids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startled awake, Heeju rolled her eyes to look down at her body. Someone had buried their head between her legs like a dog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, it was Kwon Gukhyun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her pajamas were already gone, and she couldn’t see where they had been thrown off to. Her legs were spread wide open by Gukhyun’s hands, and her top was pushed down to her shoulders. Since she usually didn’t wear a br@ to bed, her br`@sts were fully exposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Heeju was deeply asleep, Gukhyun had stripped her n@k3d without permission and was absorbed in s*ck1ng her v@g/na. Each time he thr`#st his thick tongue into her, her back arched involuntarily, causing her exposed br3@sts to sway l3wd’ly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hnng… when did you get here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been nearly a week since she last saw Kwon Gukhyun. Less than two days after sustaining a shoulder injury, he left the mansion with Yunam, claiming an urgent business trip. Sungang and Chulhyun were also nowhere to be seen for days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mansion was never particularly crowded, but with even the few people around gone, it felt really empty. Only the housekeeper in charge of meals, as if following some directive, consistently prepared sumptuous feasts without fail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s with you, coming in without a word… hnng, eung.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gukhyun used his entire lips to stimulate her cl`t.#r!s, greedily sucking on her v@g`n4. </span><b><i>Smooch, smack, slurp.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The sloppy sounds echoed, sending shivers down her spine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waking up suddenly to find herself being s#ck3d like this. It should have been absurd and unpleasant, but instead of closing her widely spread legs, Heeju reached out and gripped Gukhyun’s hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if he wasn’t just s*ck!.ng her but had taken her without consent, she honestly wouldn’t have been surprised. Maybe because she already knew he was such a crude, vulgar man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahgn, haa…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gukhyun’s head burrowed even deeper between her shamelessly spread legs. The movements of his tongue, mercilessly digging into her, grew increasingly intense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn’t take long for the heat boiling in her stomach to burst. Heeju’s hips, trembling in midair, sank back onto the bed.</span></p>
