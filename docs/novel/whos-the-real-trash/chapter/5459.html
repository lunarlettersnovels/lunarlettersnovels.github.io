            <p><strong>Chapter 20.1</strong></p>
<p>“Uhn…”</p>
<p>Heeju made a small m0@an and tossed her body around. Her furrowed brows twitched and trembled.</p>
<p>Her body felt heavy and was sinking down, and something was tickling and twitching, causing her to shudder. <strong><em>Suck, suck.</em></strong> An ominous noise pierced her ears.</p>
<p>With difficulty, she lifted her eyelids. Heeju was leaning against the back seat of a sedan. Where was she? The window outside was dark, and the vehicle was parked somewhere. She could see a wall or something, but she had no idea where she was.</p>
<p>“Hnng, what are you doing now…”</p>
<p>Heeju frowned and lowered her head. Gukhyun had his large body hunched over with his head buried in Heeju’s chest.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, uhn…”</p>
<p>Her knit top was pulled up, and her br3#$t was exposed, pulled out of her br@. He cupped her mound and sucked on one peak, making a lu,stf3ul sound.</p>
<p>Gukhyun sucked in her entire a.re0la, and then looked up at Heeju with his eyes wide open. It was unclear when he had started sucking on a sleeping person’s br3#$t, but he was exuding a le3.wd and lascivious energy from his entire body.</p>
<p>“I’m sucking on your br3#$t.”</p>
<p>“So why…”</p>
<p>“I only sucked on one side earlier, and the color was different, so I wanted to even them out fairly.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need, uhn…”</p>
<p>Heeju’s hips jerked upwards. It was because Gukhyun’s hand, which had dug into her pants, was er0t!c.ally rubbing the area under her bottom.</p>
<p>Her body, which had become aware of pleasure, was reacting to even a single touch, twitching and clenching, and was releasing her ju!c*s. Heeju grabbed Gukhyun’s wrist and tried to stop him.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute…”</p>
<p>“Shh, lower your voice.”</p>
<p>The sharp eyes right in front of her looked even more savage than usual.</p>
<p>“Do you want Yunam to get an er*ct!0n?”</p>
<p>Heeju’s eyes widened in surprise at his words. Her bright eyes glanced forward. There was a partition between the front and back seats, but it was unclear how effective it would be in soundproofing.</p>
<p>“You’ve been crying so prettily since earlier, I’m sure you’ve turned him on.”</p>
<p><em>So, you’re saying that you’ve had your subordinate sitting in the driver’s seat the whole time, while you’ve been sucking on my br3#$ts?</em> Heeju looked at Gukhyun as if she was staring at a serious pervert.</p>
<p>Shush.</p>
<p>Gukhyun quietly put his finger to his lips, as if telling her to be quiet. Then, he grabbed Heeju’s pants and quickly pulled them down. Since she wasn’t wearing any underwear, her wet and sticky lower area was exposed.</p>
<p>At that moment, something flickered across Gukhyun’s face, but it disappeared quickly. It was so brief that it was almost imperceptible, but his long eyes narrowed slightly, and the corner of his mouth curled up in a playful smile, revealing a mischievous glint.</p>
<p>Heeju suddenly felt a sense of unease and reached out to press a button. With a whirring sound, the partition between the front and back seats slowly came down. The driver’s seat was empty.</p>
<p>“There’s no one there.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun leaned his forehead against Heeju’s shoulder and let out a low chuckle.</p>
<p>“I want to tease you because you’re so naive and believe everything.”</p>
<p><em>Ugh, it’s so annoying.</em></p>
<p>She felt foolish for freaking out, even for a moment. Heeju tried to push Gukhyun away, who was covering her body, but instead of being pushed back, Gukhyun buried his head even deeper and pressed his lips against her ear, making soft kissing sounds. His voice, tinged with amus*m3nt, whispered low in her ear.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to show the kids how I f2.ck you.”</p>
<p>“It’s unexpected that you have some common sense.”</p>
<p>For a moment, she had believed that his subordinate was sitting in the driver’s seat, but it was because Gukhyun was the kind of person who would do something like that. Perhaps, even if he had tried to have s*2x in front of his subordinates, it wouldn’t have been that surprising.</p>
<p>“Your p*$.$y is so pretty. The boys will go crazy when they see it.”</p>
<p>Ziiiik. The sound of a zipper being unzipped was heard.</p>
<p>“I don’t like my things being touched by others.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun pulled out his er<em>ct m#mb3r from his pants and, with a slapping sound, lifted his p</em>n!s while spreading Heeju’s legs wide apart with his knees. His large body made the spacious sedan’s back seat look cramped.</p>
<p>Despite this, Heeju knew that he would take her here, and she couldn’t escape. Moreover, she didn’t particularly want to escape.</p>
<p>Heeju looked into Gukhyun’s eyes and then obediently spread her thighs. In the darkness, the man’s excited eyes shone with an unusual light. At the same time, something hot and hard touched her v*lv@.</p>
<p>“Haa… I’m not an object, though.”</p>
<p>As the fully er<em>ct gL,@ns penetrated her v</em>lv@ and probed her wet h*l3, Heeju’s eyes closed involuntarily and her jaw lifted. A heated breath escaped between her parted lips.</p>
<p>“Then should I call you my woman?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun thr#$t his p<em>n!s into Heeju, and thanks to the s</em>m3n he had ejaculated inside her earlier, which acted as a lubricant, his large m#mb3r slid into her like a snake, filling her up.</p>
<p>“Euk!”</p>
