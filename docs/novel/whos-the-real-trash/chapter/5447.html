            <p><strong>Chapter 26.1</strong></p>
<p>“Everyone get out.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun said as he threw Heeju onto the living room sofa. Yunam stopped at the front door, hesitating without being able to enter or leave.</p>
<p>“But hyung, before that…”</p>
<p>“Yunam wants to watch? Should I tell him to stay here?”</p>
<p>“No, hmmp…”</p>
<p>Only Heeju’s small feet sticking out of the sofa could be seen. Yunam ran a hand through his hair in embarrassment and reluctantly turned away.</p>
<p>“Ha, this is crazy…”</p>
<p>He muttered, and the front door slammed shut. Almost simultaneously, Heeju’s pants and panties fell off her legs. Gukhyun took off his cumbersome coat, spread Heeju’s legs together and lifted them.</p>
<p>“You’re mine.”</p>
<p>He swallowed Heeju’s ankle whole. No sooner had her hips flinched and jumped up than his fingers spread her vu2lv@ and entered.</p>
<p>“Ahh…”</p>
<p>“Why were you looking at someone else’s dirty toes?”</p>
<p>His calloused middle finger rubbed the folds of her inner wall. Her tight and hot flesh gripped Gukhyun’s finger tightly as if it were his p3.n!s.</p>
<p>“To make me feel like shit?”</p>
<p>“As if something like that would… Heung…”</p>
<p>What kind of l.3wd body was it, that it could barely swallow one finger but still suck it inside with pleasure? Gukhyun felt the inner mucous membrane becoming wet and sticky as he lowered his zipper and took out his c01.ck.</p>
<p>“Are you going to find a new owner?”</p>
<p>When he put his smoothly wet c01.ck in her mouth, Heeju made a sound and slightly opened her lips. A small, soft tongue came out and licked Gukhyun’s gl#@.ns. Gukhyun’s finger was still stuck in her hole.</p>
<p>“Don’t read too much into it. Mmmgh.”</p>
<p>The head of his c01.ck jerked back and forth. His abs tightened and his spine tensed.</p>
<p>“Bite deeper.”</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>When he pushed his lower body in and made her swallow past his gl@!ns, Heeju’s eyes turned red. Even so, the way she opened her mouth and tried to swallow Gukhyun’s p.3n!s was clumsy. That’s why it’s more arousing, which is the problem.</p>
<p>“I only do this kind of thing, eueup, with you.”</p>
<p>Heeju mumbled with his c01.ck in her mouth. Every time she did, the narrow and humid inside of her mouth pleased pleasantly against his shaft.</p>
<p>She looked timid and docile, but it was so absurdly cute that she glared with sharp eyes at him. Gukhyun stirred the wet hole with two fingers and said,</p>
<p>“You like it as long as the c01.ck is big.”</p>
<p>“Who, heueup, says that. That I like it, heup, as long as the c01.ck is big.”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“What. You’re bragging about your big c01.ck.”</p>
<p>Heeju glared and spat out his p.3n!s from her mouth. It wasn’t easy to speak with something like a club full in her mouth.</p>
<p>Her mouth was dripping with saliva just from sucking it a little. Heeju wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and faced Gukhyun.</p>
<p>“I’m not sleeping with you because of your c01.ck.”</p>
<p>“Then why?”</p>
<p>“I’m sleeping with you because you’re handsome.”</p>
<p>The movement of his hand, which had been stirring her p2.ss!y, slowed down. He seemed to be mulling over Heeju’s words for a moment, then Gukhyun smiled, stretching his lips wide.</p>
<p>“I’m going to have to kill all the handsome bastards with big c01.cks.”</p>
<p>The fingers stuck in her inner walls increased to three.</p>
<p>“Hmmph!”</p>
<p>Heeju instinctively grabbed Gukhyun’s forearm. However, Gukhyun, far from stopping, rather began to shake his hand roughly from side to side.</p>
<p>“Euhk! St, stop! Ahh!”</p>
<p>“I’ll stop if you pee.”</p>
<p>“No, mmngh! Hukk! Ah! Ahhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Her flat lower abdomen lifted upwards. Her body, which had been twisting and struggling, not knowing what to do, stiffened at some point, all the way down to her hole.</p>
<p>“Hnngghh!”</p>
<p>Trickling droplets spurted like a stream of water, drawing a l.3wd parabola in the air. Heeju, who had reached her climax, gasped for air and slumped into Gukhyun’s arms.</p>
<p>“That was fast. How much did I even poke you for you to already go?”</p>
<p>Gukhyun pulled his fingers out of her p2.ss!y and held them in front of Heeju’s eyes. Clear liquid dripped from his soaked fingertips.</p>
<p>“Look. It came from your p2.ss!y.”</p>
<p>Her v2@g!n.a was still twitching and spitting out her juices in the aftermath of her climax.</p>
<p>“Want to suck it?”</p>
<p>“Ughh…”</p>
<p>Heeju made a disgusted expression and turned her head to the side. Gukhyun chuckled and put his transparently wet fingers in his mouth and sucked them.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he was a man who didn’t force Heeju to do what she didn’t want to do. It would be a lie to say that the extremely rough and barbaric s3.,x with Kwon Gukhyun wasn’t overwhelming, but he knew it like a demon and didn’t cross the line.</p>
