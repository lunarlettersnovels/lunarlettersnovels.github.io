            <p><strong>Chapter 10.2</strong></p>
<p>Heeju propped herself up slightly on her elbows, her upper body lifting off the sofa. Her face was marked with a small, questioning frown.</p>
<p>“Why’d you turn on the lights…?”</p>
<p>“Need to get a good look before anything else,” he replied coolly.</p>
<p>He gripped her thighs and spread them wide apart, leaving no room for modesty.</p>
<p>“Let’s see just how pretty it is.”</p>
<p>Heeju’s lips parted slightly, but no words came out. She lay there, her legs splayed like a frog’s, the brightest light exposing every intimate detail. Her most vulnerable, delicate part was completely bare under his gaze, and his dark eyes lingered on it liek a predator.</p>
<p>“Pink,” he murmured.</p>
<p>What could you expect from a guy like him? Gukhyun was crude every time he opened his mouth; there was no way he’d suddenly turn polite during s.3x. She hadn’t thought of it, and she definitely didn’t hope for it.</p>
<p>His tongue flicked out, wetting his lips as his eyes stayed fixed between her legs. The way he looked at her, all heated and focused, made something in her stomach tighten.</p>
<p>“See? I told you.”</p>
<p>He let out a short laugh, his mouth twisting into a smirk. His thumb moved slowly around her entrance like he was sizing her up, and his voice came out low and rough.</p>
<p>“Your p1/!s.sy didn’t need to look this good.”</p>
<p>His rough fingers skimmed over her, touching just enough to make her flinch. Every brush sent a jolt through her, her hips reacting before she could stop them.</p>
<p>“So d@1mn soft,” he muttered.</p>
<p>As crude as he was, she found herself okay with it. Maybe she even liked it. She didn’t want sweet words or gentleness. She wanted to let go completely, to lose control. If there was anything left in her to break, she wanted it shattered now.</p>
<p>Heeju let the tension in her legs go slack. Gukhyun, who had been holding her thighs apart, didn’t miss it. He shifted, spreading her wider to get an even better look, his gaze darkening. The faint smirk that had been playing on his lips was gone, replaced by something sharper.</p>
<p>“You ever had a man’s c0!`ck in here before?”</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, one of his fingers slid inside her. Her hips jerked upward involuntarily. The sudden intrusion made her entrance clench tightly, and she instinctively propped herself halfway up, clutching at his arm.</p>
<p>“You said you’d use your mouth,” she gasped, her voice catching. “Why… why the finger?”</p>
<p>“Does it matter?”</p>
<p>“You freaked me out!”</p>
<p>“If this freaks you out, we’ve got a problem.”</p>
<p>He pulled his finger out and, to her shock, slipped it into his mouth, tasting it. Why the hell would he do that…? She frowned, but he didn’t care. Looking down at her, he spoke with absolute certainty.</p>
<p>“You’ve never been f!u.1ck3d.”</p>
<p>“What makes you so sure?”</p>
<p>“You can barely handle one finger.”</p>
<p>He squinted one eye slightly, his smile sharp and dangerous. His sculpted features turned fierce, radiating an unsettling kind of allure.</p>
<p>“Is it your first time giving something so precious to a guy like me? What a pity.”</p>
<p>“I was not keeping it; I’m throwing it away. To someone like you.”</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll gladly accept it.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun grabbed Heeju’s thighs and suddenly lifted them into the air. In the blink of an eye, her lower body was hoisted high, leaving her stunned.</p>
<p>“Ah! H-Hey! What are you—”</p>
<p>“With a hole this tight, how do you think you’re going to take my c0c1.k? And yet, here you are, spreading yourself open for me.”</p>
<p>Her back barely rested against the sofa as her legs were raised high, leaving her completely exposed to him, her most vulnerable parts right in front of his face.</p>
<p>“Not scared, are you? My fearless little doctor.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun draped her flailing legs over his shoulders and gripped her waist, lifting her even higher.</p>
<p>“It’ll take more than this. That tight little entrance of yours needs to be soft and pliable, or it won’t even begin to take me.”</p>
<p>Her hips were pulled up further, her body stretching to his control.</p>
<p>“What are you gonna do now?”</p>
<p>“What do you—ahh! Ngh!”</p>
<p>Before she could finish, Heeju’s hips bucked as he spread his mouth wide and sucked her p!u.1ss`y as if devouring it.</p>
<p>Actually, from the time Kwon Gukhyun observed her nether regions with intense eyes, she became more and more aroused. The stimulation applied to the sensitive area was unfamiliar yet very shocking.</p>
<p>Gukhyun supported Heeju’s bu!.tt0cks with one arm, restricting her movement, and then used his thumb and index finger to widen the hole, inserting his tongue deep inside.<br>
“Ah, nggh!”</p>
<p>He inserted his hot and thick tongue into her hole, rubbing against her 1nn3r walls. Gukhyun’s tongue moved roughly, as if it was penetrating, stirring the inside.</p>
<p>“Is it because you didn’t get enough stimulation? You’re reacting wildly wherever I touch. If you wanted it this much, you should have asked me to s.u1ck it earlier. Baby.”</p>
<p>She didn’t even have the energy to respond. He sucked her entire v@!g1n$a with his lips, swallowing every last drop of the fluid that was flowing out. The sound of sucking and slurping, as he ate her wet flesh, was loud and obscene.</p>
