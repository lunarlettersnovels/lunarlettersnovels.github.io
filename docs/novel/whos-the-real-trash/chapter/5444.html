            <p><strong>Chapter 27.2</strong></p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Unable to make a sound, Heeju’s lips trembling like a fish out of water. Heeju’s body c0n.v^ls3d and a l.3wd stream of fl<em>!d sp</em>r.t3d out of her h0l3, which was still cl3Nc.h!ng his d!c&lt;, and spl@tTer-3d onto the clean glass window.</p>
<p>“Uhk.”</p>
<p>It was at that exact moment that Gukhyun sh.0t his lo.@d !ns-de Heeju. The c<em>m intensely sh.0t against her !nn3r w@ll.ss and flowed into her ut3r</em>s. The he@.t3d fl.3s!h ins!de her quivered with c0n-v*ls!ons as if savoring the feeling of being f!l.l3d to the brim. It was as if her body was begging him to pour everything !ns!-de her.</p>
<p>To be honest, she found the low gr0.@n he made as he ej@c*l@ted to be pleasing. It gave her a strange feeling, as if she had discovered a vulnerable part of a man who occupied the highest position in the world of survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>“It’s so fvck!ng hot inside.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun continued his leisurely thr-xsts, as if determined to sq`3e.z3 every last dR.0p of his c*m !ns-!de Heeju, reveling in the shameless afterglow. The s’m3n that overflowed from their joined bodies dripped onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Haa, haa…”</p>
<p>Hee-ju lay limp, gasping for breath. Gukhyun licked her earlobe, his tongue tracing the edge of her ear as if nibbling on it.</p>
<p>“You need to drink some water. You’re dr!p.p!n.g all over the place.”</p>
<p>“Put me down, please. I’m going to die from exhaustion.”</p>
<p>“Should we just go to the kitchen like this?”</p>
<p>“Do you have the strength left for that?”</p>
<p>“All I have is a sturdy body.”</p>
<p>Despite having left Heeju unable to move a single finger, Gukhyun looked strangely refreshed.</p>
<p>“I want to get down.”</p>
<p>“Try saying ‘please put me down’.”</p>
<p>“Please put me down.”</p>
<p>What’s so difficult about that? Gukhyun chuckled with amusement at Heeju’s polite tone. He then walked over to the sofa, and set Heeju down.</p>
<p>Just as she felt the softness of the sofa behind her and thought she could finally rest, Gukhyun fell on top of her.</p>
<p>“Eung…”</p>
<p>Heeju let out a m0.@n as the weight of his body pressed down on her. Her eyes scrunched up in discomfort.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? You’re too heavy.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“It’s heavy.”</p>
<p>At first, she thought he was just joking around. But when she tried to push him away, she realized that something was off.</p>
<p>Gukhyun, even when he was on top of Heeju, never put his full weight on her. He knew that their size difference would cause her to be crushed, so he always left some space for her to breathe. But now, this was different from usual.</p>
<p>“…Excuse me.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Executive Director.”</p>
<p>She shook his shoulder, but Gukhyun didn’t respond, burying his face in Heeju’s neck. Heeju swallowed hard, her mouth dry. She was starting to feel suffocated.</p>
<p>Thinking that he would be a truly awful person if he was doing this as a joke, Heeju wriggled her body. After barely managing to escape from under Gukhyun, her breathing became ragged again.</p>
<p>Heeju’s eyes widened in shock as she gazed down at Gukhyun, her body frozen like ice. The back of Gukhyun’s shoulder was stained with blood, a deep red color.</p>
<p>“What is this…? This couldn’t be, right…?”</p>
<p>Heeju’s trembling hand reached out to touch Gukhyun’s shoulder. Maybe it wasn’t his blood. It couldn’t be.</p>
<p>She had hoped that the man who had just enjoyed an incredible s3.x would simply pass out, but she knew that was a foolish expectation. The shirt stained with blood became even more soaked.</p>
<p>Heeju checked Gukhyun’s breathing and then quickly got up from her seat. She returned with a medical kit and hastily cut Gukhyun’s shirt with scissors.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Only then did the wound on his shoulder become visible to Heeju. The scissors slipped from her hand with a clatter.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Now that she thought about it, Heeju realized that she had never seen Gukhyun sleep before. After s3.x, she would always fall asleep first, and when she woke up, his side of the bed would be empty. It was only natural, since they didn’t share a bed in a familiar or intimate way, despite having s3.x when they felt like it.</p>
<p>He was a person who slept completely still like a corpse. His peaceful appearance made her uneasy that something was wrong, and she found herself constantly checking to see if he was breathing properly.</p>
<p>“How is the Executive Director’s condition?”</p>
<p>Yunam asked, standing like a stone statue in a spot far away from the bed. Heeju adjusted the flow rate of the IV fluid and plopped down in the chair she had brought over to the bedside.</p>
<p>Since she couldn’t move Gukhyun to the bedroom by herself, she had to call Yunam. He had arrived so quickly like a wind that she suspected he had been waiting right outside the front door.</p>
