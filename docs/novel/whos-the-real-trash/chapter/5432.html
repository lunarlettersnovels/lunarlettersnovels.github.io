            <p><strong>Chapter 33.2</strong></p>
<p>“Director Yoon, is the soundproofing okay in here?”</p>
<p>Ignoring Giju, who was throwing a fit, Jungman turned to Seokchan, who was quietly standing at the foot of the bed. Seokchan immediately bowed his head.</p>
<p>“I’ve cleared the entire floor. Security is also being taken care of, so don’t worry, Chairman.”</p>
<p>“Good. Make sure that no unnecessary noise leaks out, Director Yoon, and Giju, you stay in the hospital for a few days before going home.”</p>
<p>Jungman stood up from the chair, leaning on his cane. As he showed signs of leaving, Giju’s eyes widened in alarm.</p>
<p>“Is that all, dad? What about Kwon Gukhyun?”</p>
<p>Joo-ah stood next to Seokchan and didn’t say anything, but her expression was just as dissatisfied as Giju’s. Jungman stared at Giju with a composed face.</p>
<p>“What do you want me to do about Director Kwon?”</p>
<p>“We need to show him an example! How dare he lay a hand on the chairman’s child… Are you really going to let this slide? If we just let it go, what will happen to me?”</p>
<p>“You idiot!”</p>
<p>The sound of Jungman hitting the hospital floor with his cane echoed loudly. Giju was startled and shut his mouth tightly in shock.</p>
<p>“Does your brain actually work, or is it just for decoration?”</p>
<p>“Ah, dad….”</p>
<p>“All this time, it was Director Kwon who quietly cleaned up after your dr*!g use and all the trouble you caused. Did you really think he protected you purely out of goodwill, like a brother?”</p>
<p>He tightened his grip on the cane.</p>
<p>“That guy has been collecting your weaknesses, step by step. And you, without realizing it, run to him every time you get into trouble, hiding behind his back? You dimwit!”</p>
<p>Under the pressure of Chairman Kwon’s authority, Giju couldn’t muster a reply and just gaped like a fish out of water.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, at least keep pretending to be close like brothers, instead of poking at a bomb that’s holding onto your weaknesses!”</p>
<p>“But, dad, this time it was Kwon Gukhyun who touched me, not the other way around….”</p>
<p>“How many times do I have to tell you that to be a true leader, you need to make sure your subordinates are completely on your side? When will that stupid head of yours finally get it?”</p>
<p>Joo-ah’s eyes turned cold as she watched Giju, the chairman’s only son, being scolded. The phrase “true leader” made her clench her fist tightly, prompting Seokchan to quietly wrap his hand around hers. It was a gesture to calm her down and remind her to hold back.</p>
<p>Kwon Jungman had two wives and three children: two daughters and one son. Despite being the youngest, Giju was the least capable in terms of intelligence and skills, yet the chairman’s intention to pass the company to his son remained firm.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling wronged for being taken down by a subordinate? Chew on your anger now and wait for the right time.”</p>
<p>Giju swallowed hard at Jungman’s words.</p>
<p>“Are you going to keep Kwon Gukhyun under you, or are you going to get rid of him entirely? It’s one or the other.”</p>
<p>“What do you plan to do about Kwon Gukhyun, dad?”</p>
<p>A brief twitch crossed Giju’s bruised face. Instead of answering Giju’s question, Jungman suddenly turned his warm gaze toward Seokchan.</p>
<p>“Look at our Director Yoon. He’s been doing such a great job by Joo-ah’s side.”</p>
<p>As Jungman praised Seokchan, Joo-ah slightly lifted her chin and made a satisfied expression. Seokchan bowed his head even lower and replied with a polite demeanor.</p>
<p>“No, Chairman. I’m just fulfilling my role.”</p>
<p>“I vividly remember the time we took Seokchan into our organization. There will be even more work to do for the company moving forward.”</p>
<p>“I will work hard, Chairman.”</p>
<p>“Good. By the way, I heard this whole incident is about a woman.”</p>
<p>Jungman patted Seokchan on the shoulder and turned to look at Giju, twisting his cane in his arm.</p>
<p>“Is that true?”</p>
<p>“A little while ago, we brought in a young woman as the new attending physician.”</p>
<p>Giju rubbed the dark bruise on his cheek as he muttered.</p>
<p>“I thought Dr. Hwang was immediately cast aside for siding with you, dad, but that wasn’t it. It turns out that there’s some kind of relationship going on with that woman and that b@st#r.d Kwon Gukhyun.”</p>
