            <p><strong>Chapter 6.2</strong></p>
<p>Heeju froze, her lips parted and tongue slightly out as she glanced up. Her gaze met Kukhyeon’s.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you’re willing to suck it,” he said, voice laced with amusement. “But here’s the thing.”</p>
<p>His expression turned almost apologetic as he narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“I have to head out.”</p>
<p>Without waiting for a response, he placed a hand on her shoulder and gently pushed her upright. Leaving Heeju frozen in place, Gukhyun got out of bed with an easy, unhurried motion.</p>
<p>“This can wait.”</p>
<p>He brushed a thumb lightly over her still-parted lips, closing them with a faint smile before turning away without hesitation. Untying the already loose knot of his robe entirely, he picked up his phone and started walking.</p>
<p>“Gang-ah, come here for a moment,” he called into the phone.</p>
<p>Heeju, still sitting dazed and unmoving, turned her head. Gukhyun had just finished his short call and was shuffling into the dressing room, the hem of his robe fluttering.</p>
<p>What… the hell? He was the one who said to do it.</p>
<p>After Gukhyun leisurely disappeared, Heeju staggered as she got up from the bed. As soon as she straightened her knees, a severe dizziness hit her. She quickly leaned against the wall to steady herself.</p>
<p>The thought of trying to suck a man’s p3n!s’ with a sh1!tt`y body made her laugh bitterly. When did she become so primal? It must have been something she picked up from him.</p>
<p>As she lowered her hand from the wall, she noticed an unfamiliar bandage on the inside of her arm. Removing the round bandage revealed a needle mark. She must have gotten an IV while she was unconscious.</p>
<p>Despite the IV, her body, exhausted from a night of nightmares, seemed to be in worse condition every day. She hated it. Dragging her heavy feet, Heeju moved forward.</p>
<p>Gukhyun’s bedroom had a similar layout to the room she stayed in on the second floor, but the interior was entirely different. Not interested in exploring the room, she trudged along until she stopped in front of a large black tank installed against one wall.</p>
<p>The tank was large enough to fit a person, and its dark color gave it an ominous appearance.</p>
<p>Does he keep fish?</p>
<p>Feeding and caring for a pet didn’t seem like the kind of tedious task the room’s owner would bother with. The thought didn’t match his image at all. Heeju peered inside but found the tank empty.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>At that moment, a knock on the door made Heeju turn her head.</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim, it’s Sungang. I’m coming in.”</p>
<p>With a click, someone entered the room. It was a man with a long scar running from his forehead to his cheek. Sungang didn’t seem surprised to see Heeju standing in front of the tank.</p>
<p>“Oh? You’re up? Yesterday you looked as pale as a corpse, and you don’t look much better now.”</p>
<p>“You’ve come.”</p>
<p>Just then, Gukhyun walked out of the dressing room. Dressed in a suit, he looked nothing like someone who had been stabbed in the stomach the night before.</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung. You called for me?”</p>
<p>Sungang bowed deeply to Gukhyun. Unlike the rigidly disciplined Sungang, Gukhyun lazily gestured towards Heeju.</p>
<p>“Tell Attorney Kim to come in. We need to write up that kid’s contract.”</p>
<p>“What kind of contract, hyung?”</p>
<p>“An employment contract.”</p>
<p>“An employment contract? Ah… What should I write as the position?”</p>
<p>“My personal doctor.”</p>
<p>Gukhyun said as he adjusted his shirt collar and draped a tie around his neck. Sungang glanced at Heeju with a doubtful expression. His quick up-and-down look clearly showed his skepticism.</p>
<p>‘A personal doctor? How could he trust this skinny kid…’</p>
