            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 53 – After Story (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p>The laughter of Hekate, goddess of the ominous night, flowed all the way down to the underworld.</p>
<p>Persephone stopped his hand sweeping her hair and staring at the fog surrounding the palace. It looked like a monster was lurking somewhere deep in the hazy fog. She glanced away and studied the half-open door of the side room. Inside, objects were hanging, things she didn’t have much interest in, such as a dagger that had slashed and dashed Titans, a long whip, and the cap of invisibility.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the door opened, and she heard ‘him’.</p>
<p>“You’re back?”</p>
<p>He was a man whose every aspect of his being was reminiscent of the superficial meaning of death, including his soft black hair falling past his ears, broad shoulders, hard chest, and beautiful calves.</p>
<p>Her husband Hades, king of the underworld.</p>
<p>Leaning with his back against the door, his eyes looked edgier than ever before. More than around this time last year.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You look excited.”</p>
<p>Cheering herself up was her habitual routine.</p>
<p>“Don’t be like that, Hades.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“How can I not? Even though the day when I have to go back above ground has come, I will come back to you… You know that. I love you.”</p>
<p>Tonight, she was to go back to earth and Hades had always hated her leaving.</p>
<p>Spending half the year here, and the other half there was a promise she made to the gods of Olympus. A consolation to the mother who had inevitably lost her daughter and a minimal compromise was concluded.</p>
<p>Each time she’s in the underworld, Persephone was soaked in the sensation of pointy birch leaves tickling her feet. Hades had gifted her with a garden she adored. He brought enough joy to her imagination.</p>
<p>This happiness, would it be just like Tartaros, to which dropping an iron needle couldn’t reach the ground for ten days? Is there no end to this happiness, like the bottomless Acheron?</p>
<p>“Are you going to spend the rest of your days staring at me with such grieving eyes?”</p>
<p>The man who she had caused a great scandal did not forsake her, did not abandon her, did not punish her—he did not want to do any of that. Instead, Hades loved her, and with her every return to Earth he would be thoroughly disgruntled. Why can’t he have his wife all for himself?</p>
<p>“Sometimes I feel like I’m going to fall victim to that face of yours. Just sometimes.” He said in a grave tone.</p>
<p>“If you’re that uneasy to let me go, then do what I want you to do. Just love me more.” Persephone naturally hugged his neck.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Hades to sit her up on the table next to the neatly seated pomegranates, vases, and gray quill. With her head tilted to the side, Persephone looked at him with a trembling heart. Indeed the beautiful god of death; who would deny his loftiness?</p>
<p>“Return quickly if it’s possible… Fast, if you can.”</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>“Persephone.”</p>
<p>Hades gently sucked on her tongue and slowly pushed his tongue inwards. Since days and nights are unclear in the underworld, they count the time when it is only by measuring the sunset. She was staying in his world long enough to get used to his kiss.</p>
<p>As her body temperature gradually increased, and the hand feeling around her waist gripped tighter, Hades’ kiss became intense. His kindness—such a thing was ravishingly washed away as if it were not there from the beginning—and his tongue was entangled deeper by bending his jaw at an angle.</p>
<p>It was like he was digging a hole under Persephone’s tongue. Then, she soon released herself from his lips.</p>
<p>“Do you love me?” He asked her.</p>
<p>“Of course. I swear to Styx, I love you.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I love you, I love you. No one else on this planet will love you like I do. We were destined to be together.” She comforted him with her sweet words.</p>
<p>Hades placed his enormous hands on the table and swept everything away with one swipe. All at once, they were thrown down to the floor, like all of the anguish and trouble inside of him. The vase holding daffodils fell and shattered.</p>
<p>“Whoa…” Persephone’s breath moved to his ears. Her body tingled whenever the tip of his tongue penetrated her ear like a snake.</p>
<p>“I know that, so I… have no reason to act foul like this. I know.” He was talking to himself.</p>
<p>His robe lifted, and his gentle hands, which had been caressing her white calves for a long time, soon opened her thighs as if he was tired of only kissing. It felt like her flesh had been crushed by his grip.</p>
<p>“Ouch.”</p>
<p>“I’ve hit rock bottom. There is no point of return possible.” Hades murmured to himself. His love for Persephone was beyond words. Every time he hugged her, he felt that he’d become perfect. Like he was stuck in a remote abyss. The king who ruled the deep underground world more than anyone else—he knows that he could never get rid of this feeling.</p>
<p>“My back hurts.” In a mousy voice, Persephone raised a little complain.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you liked pain?”</p>
<p>“Ouch, Hades.”</p>
<p>“I know you also like stiff, hard things.” He snatched off her robe like he’d been annoyed by it and trampled it like a rag.</p>
<p>Hades grabbed her waist and pulled her down to the edge to fit between her thighs. His erect penis grazed between her thighs. And he mocked her as he looked down to see her red genitals already getting wet.</p>
<p>“I haven’t even started yet, and you’re already wet—” He said, sliding his finger inside down of Persephone’s widely spread legs. With no warning, he pushed two fingers in and out, tickling her inner walls, and watched the clear liquid flow out. Persephone lost her breath.</p>
<p>“Oh… Ah!”</p>
<p>The wandering fingers entered deeper and sped up, almost rubbing the deepest point, making a gushing noise. Persephone looked up at him with his eyes down, even his ears reddening. Hades’ eyes filling with excitement looked good to her. He continued to loosen the inner flesh by pushing in with barbaric hand movements.</p>
