            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 47 – Deceived</strong></p>
<p>Her endless moaning and her hand that couldn’t find anything to grab shook like the forest’s tree branches. The more she did, the more Hades lost his mind.</p>
<p>At this moment, the thing he couldn’t stand most was himself. The girl didn’t love him, but from the moment he knew that, he seemed to be losing reason.</p>
<p>He couldn’t allow her to deceive him and run away from him, from he who became a mess like his insides had been torn apart. While roaming around above ground, determined to find Demeter’s island, he suffered more anger day by day. I was deceived, he thought. Whose fault was it that I was just a puppet in the young goddess’ hands, he thought. If he could get over that, that would be enough.</p>
<p>However, that was impossible.</p>
<p>“You didn’t think I’d find you? You really believed that? Did you believe that Demeter’s protection was that great? Huh?”</p>
<p>The perfect mockery.</p>
<p><em>-That’s Demeter’s daughter. Didn’t you know that since you two are close? I wasn’t sure at first, but I definitely saw it. You didn’t hear the story about the virgin daughter that Demeter madly cherished so much that she trapped her on an island.</em></p>
<p>Hermes’ words rang in his ears…</p>
<p>Hades didn’t forget Persephone’s words when she introduced herself to him.</p>
<p><em>-My mother is concerned about me because she loves me too much. My mother called me Kore because she wanted me to be Kore forever, and the other nymphs who heard her call me that, so it became a nickname.</em></p>
<p><em>‘It all made sense…’</em></p>
<p>“It was your biggest mistake to confess to believing a human being.” He said, referring on the cunning Sisyphos, whom Persephone once confided to.</p>
<p>Sisyphos was a trickster, however, when he mentioned Persephone to Hades, the lord of the underworld believed him. Hades then chose to take on the problems of Zeus and Sisyphos, whom he had never expected would become important to him. He said he would show mercy to the human who deceived death.</p>
<p>-“I’ve been wondering sir. That is, which goddess has offended you? I see, sir, you’re afraid that she wouldn’t be forgiven by you for doing something. She said she was almost done, but something went wrong, and she wanted <em>something</em> from the beginning, so she stayed by your side…” Sisyphos had said.</p>
<p>-“How, how dare you undermine my authority and…”</p>
<p>Everything pointed to Persephone’s dishonesty. She was even crueler than Sisyphos. She had even squeezed the oath from Hades on the premise of ‘no matter what I would do, you must forgive me’.</p>
<p>Whether or not this feeling of care, love, and betrayal was an obsession with vows, Hades has lost himself. He lost his former calm and impassiveness… The ire he felt now was a proof to this.</p>
<p>It was difficult to judge whether Hades was working himself up right now, or if he was caught up in a tornado of anger. He wasn’t even this riled up in the Vale of Tempe, which was the fiercest battle with the Titans.</p>
<p>“Oh, Hades! Ohh!”</p>
<p>“You like it when it hurts, huh? I can feel you getting wet already.”</p>
<p>Her rebellious behavior was no more. Persephone welcomed him, accepting his flesh inside of her. With Hades’ penis pumping deeply in and out of her, she grazed its sticky shaft with her fingers. The sensitivity made her head spin.</p>
<p>“Girl, who do you think you are?”</p>
<p>Now she wasn’t the girl who called herself ‘Niasis’.</p>
<p>Hermes had said that she was the daughter of Demeter, but Hades didn’t know her. He just felt that only the girl who hid everything from him remained in his heart, still bound by the oath.</p>
<p>Persephone. That’s what her real name was.</p>
<p>He didn’t care one bit that she was Demeter’s daughter nor that she was still living her life on earth.</p>
<p>“You really thought that Demeter could hide you from me forever?”</p>
<p>It was like a byproduct of life to be someone’s god, someone’s friend, someone’s child. The same went for the issue of being involved with a girl who lived above ground. She had already deceived him, and Hades didn’t feel that he had a reason to respect her life anymore.</p>
<p>It was her who laid her hands on the invisible helmet and caused the situation with Ceres. It was sinister how someone with a gentle, soft face could do such a thing, but it was indeed her.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t have been a coincidence to get an oath on the Styx River from her on that same day. As Sisyphus had said, it was to avoid getting into trouble. The price of sin against someone who deceits death—for she has already made an oath—will be kept secret forever.</p>
