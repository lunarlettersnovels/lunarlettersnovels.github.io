            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 13 – A Kiss from Him (2)</strong></p>
<p>Cyane sighed and dejectedly said, “I won’t tell.”</p>
<p>“Naiads and Aretusa too?” She nodded her head reluctantly, heaving a deep sigh. “Kore please tell me the truth. Where did you go so early in the morning that your feet got scratched up so much?”</p>
<p>“I took a walk.”</p>
<p>“You swear on Styx River that you’re not lying and you only took a walk?”</p>
<p>Persephone bit her lip, curbing the next lie. “I remember Helios, who took the tragedy in exchange for a vow of sincerity; I can’t believe you mentioned the river’s oath over something so trivial. Isn’t that a bit rash, Cyane?”</p>
<p>“The circumstances are different. Is it true that you really only just took a walk?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to believe it, then don’t.”</p>
<p>Persephone entered her room blatantly ignoring Cyane. To her, the nymphs weren’t even worth a branch from a forest tree, and it was enough for her if they didn’t tell Demeter. Lying down on her bed, a shy smile spread over Persephone’s face. Her elated mood hadn’t been spoiled by Cyane’s rebuke. Touching her lips, she buried her face in a pillow and shook her head violently. It was a shame that the tingling sensation had disappeared, but she still remembered how good the feeling was; the feeling of kissing Hades.</p>
<p>That kiss, it had been so real. The ruler of the vast world, the epitome of ‘death’ itself, the owner of the ‘Cap of Invisibility’ had kissed her!</p>
<p>While his tongue had been in her mouth, she felt like it was just an illusion, much to her distress. The first feeling she had felt gave her goosebumps; it was so good that she couldn’t forget it even after the night was over. To her regret, he had told her to never return like he was ashamed of her, or with himself. She tried to console herself by saying that he was just spouting nonsense he really didn’t mean. Hope was the base of all pleasure.</p>
<p>The first time she saw him, his voice, which had whispered ‘her’ obsessively in her mind, brought back memories. Even if he was the existence of the underworld in the flesh, rather that’s why she craved him even more.</p>
<p>She broke out of her reverie when she heard Naiads’ voice from outside the door.</p>
<p>“Cyane, what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Why is your face like that?” She asked, seeing Persephone’s beet red face.</p>
<p>Persephone opened her eyes with a chilled look and stared over at the closed door. “What about my face?”</p>
<p>“It seems like something is bothering you. Why is Kore still awake?”</p>
<p>Annoyed, she grabbed the blanket and pulled it up.</p>
<p><strong>-Call me Niasis.</strong></p>
<p>She thought back at the moment she had lied to him, remembering his lips twisting with his soft voice saying ‘Niasis’. Persephone pouted her lips, thinking how useless it was to say her name was Niasis in the confusion of the moment. She had felt extremely jealous without even realising it.</p>
<p>With the blanket pulled all the way up to her head, Persephone closed her eyes tightly. How wonderful would it be if the goddess of the evil came every night. How wonderful it would be if the goddess swallowed this entire world.</p>
<p>“<em>How free I would be—if I were to be with him.</em>” She wondered.</p>
<p>Hekate slept beyond the horizon, and time continued when Nyx’s mercy touched the ground peacefully. The tired nymphs fell asleep after running all day. Persephone, who was looking out of the window listening to the sound of a buzzing grasshopper, headed out silently like a thief, holding a magpie’s foot in her dainty hands.</p>
<p>After she climbed the cliff and braved the waves, the shallow cave appeared. Without hesitation, Persephone pushed her body into the dark, cramped entrance and crawled through, not caring about her knees. There was a blockage wall just as she expected, but still, she let out a grumpy growl. She knocked on the stone with a balled-up fist before pressing her knees together and squatting down. Cursing at Nyx’s night, she grabbed a stone and picked it up. Even if Hekate’s night doesn’t come, she’ll visit the cave and spend her time scribbling on this narrow wall.</p>
<p>‘<em>Will Hades come looking for me? Can I ever find a coin? If Kharon says no, should I really just swim? But the river is massive, right? I don’t even know what lurks deep down there.</em>’ She pondered to herself as she pressed down on the wall one letter at a time until the stone was worn out.</p>
<p>A crooked letter was written down. Time flies when you’re having fun.</p>
