            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 38 – Forever and Ever</strong></p>
<p>In general, the essence of Hekate was close to the magic of darkness, and she was a symbol of disaster and sinister on earth, but underground, she was just a vulgar person who caused small problems.</p>
<p>“Door?”</p>
<p>“There was a cave near where I live, and I remembered that my favorite Narcissus flowers bloomed, so I went out to look for flowers at dawn. And then I followed her into the cave… Every time, I see her only at night. I hoped I would see her every day…”</p>
<p>Hades was able to draw a mental picture to a certain extent by organizing his thoughts thoroughly. One day, traces of the door that had been shut and erased were revealed in the goddess’s tricks, and an immature girl crawled in through the gap.</p>
<p>“That’s the honest truth, Hades.”</p>
<p>Hades remained silent for a while, then asked, “Did you really have to go in?”</p>
<p>“Did you not want me to?”</p>
<p>“Though I’m not saying that. Weren’t you afraid?”</p>
<p>Persephone was lost in the eyes that looked clearly at her. Hades didn’t know why he was so fascinated by just one nymph. However, he did not want to run away from the provocative question, so he nodded his head, leaving the uncomfortable feeling behind.</p>
<p>“If it’s more comfortable to go in.”</p>
<p>“Could you look after me? Could you do that? Would you continue to love me like this? Will you forgive whatever I do and love me? No matter what anyone says?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“What this nonsense?”</p>
<p>“It’s impossible to cheat when you swear on Styx River.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“There won’t be any danger if you don’t recklessly wander around the underworld, but it’s not like I can’t afford to protect you. As long as you’re in my zone, I will cherish—”</p>
<p>“Are you saying you will love me?”</p>
<p>“That too; I can keep you safe.”</p>
<p>“With Styx as your witness?”</p>
<p>“With Styx as my witness.” Hades smiled as he said so.</p>
<p>Forever and ever?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Actually, it’s okay if you don’t promise forever. I’m pleased enough now. This is great.” Her face was in full bloom. “Instead, you can’t look at other girls.”</p>
<p>“You really have your speculations. There’s no time for me to even try.”</p>
<p>“I’m mad.”</p>
<p>A low laugh burst from Hades, then he rubbed his hand on Persephone’s head, messing up her hair. “What did you say?”</p>
<p>“We are now lovers.”</p>
<p>Hades, who was about to laugh at her, realized that her words weren’t different in meaning and once again fell into a strange mood. For the first time in his life, he didn’t think it was strange to be called a lover.</p>
<p>Actually, it was the first time for him.</p>
<p>It seemed like at some point he ended up in a position just like Persephone had wanted. He suddenly got the chills. However, he felt rewarded by the girl for everything he could enjoy on earth. It was a type of comfort, and he couldn’t deny that Eros, whom he despised, would be small in his snobby, flattering love.</p>
<p>“You say that you couldn’t stay because it would worry your mother.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me no matter what?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me with eyes like that?”</p>
<p>“There’s no hurry.”</p>
<p>Hades refrained from confessing his impulses when she said ‘want me.’ There was no need to hurry. She was now living as one of Phoibos’ many free slaves, but someday, this girl will be perfectly in his arms. Since that’s bound to happen, he decided not to be impatient, putting aside his thoughts and doubts for a while.</p>
<p>A while later, Persephone, who was looking into Hades’ face who fell fast asleep, slowly rose from the bed. It was a silent night. The time for Hekate to pass back through the horizon was approaching. Persephone got off the bed, looked back once, walked a few steps again, and looked back.</p>
<p>She held back a grin as she opened the door of the side room to reveal Hades’ weapons hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>Hades woke up to an empty bedside. He even felt an unexpected feeling that Morpheus had visited because last night seemed to be a lie. However, there was still a sense of satisfaction that hadn’t been there before, and he couldn’t be as nervous or worried as the first time Persephone had disappeared.</p>
<p>At some point, she will suddenly appear.</p>
<p>That girl. She was as lovely as a gift from a strange night, all the way down to the discomfort that made him feel even more anxious that it didn’t seem like she was completely his. Of course, he didn’t truly believe that she was really his. He has already weighed in that she’s not a nymph. No matter how much of a joke Hekate was, a nymph can’t just skip her way out of Hades’ territory</p>
<p>‘I’ll find out, little by little.’ Hades said in his head.</p>
<p>Since Persephone loved him, and he obviously longed for her, it didn’t feel important now.</p>
