            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 30 – What Are You?</strong></p>
<p>Either this girl is a nymph, or the rules of the underworld are broken.</p>
<p>As soon as she woke up, she saw the face of a man drawn by the dried up rain and jagged rocks. Persephone thought she might be really dead or just wandering around aimlessly in Morpheus’ dreams.</p>
<p>The dreamy man spoke. “You should have waited for Kerberos.” Kerberos was a three-headed dog who fected Persephone when she was in danger.</p>
<p>It sounded like a scolding, so it was certainly not one of Morpheus’ hoaxes. The glowing Persephone crept up and hugged Hades’ waist.</p>
<p>“… Hades, I thought I would never see you again. Just in case we can’t meet.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t wait. Since the hopeless Kronos is cruel to all of us.”</p>
<p>“What in the hell happened?”</p>
<p>Persephone raised her head and caught Hades’ eyes, who wasn’t smiling. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know?”</p>
<p>Doubt, suspicion; all of the feelings she didn’t want to put up with all poured out.</p>
<p>Persephone gently kissed his lips as she stroked his hand, who didn’t say a word. Then, a little bolder, bent down to lick his neck. Just as a little beast rubs against its master, but it was a little bit more sexual.</p>
<p>“We’re here together again, so why is that so important?”</p>
<p>Hades was aroused immediately. Anger was forgotten when Persephone reached for his robe and took hold of his manhood. The girl’s small red tongue now lapped his anger.</p>
<p>“Niasis.”</p>
<p>“Don’t call me th—?</p>
<p>“You’re a nymph?”</p>
<p>Persephone looked into his eyes carefully. Not a single look of embarrassment or awkwardness; only annoyance.</p>
<p>Hades gave out such a look in a flash. Persephone soon shook her head with a bitter smile spread across her face. Her tender red tongue sucked him, groping around in her warm mouth. With no regard to his intentions. As if—being raped. With his manhood rubbing the inside of her cheek, she wiggled her tongue around it, pulled it out slightly, and pushed it back in.</p>
<p>Persephone looked up at him with eyes soaked with satiety as if she had reflected the memory of first kissing him, and put all her might into sliding his length down her throat.</p>
<p>A relaxed sweet taste.</p>
<p>“Say something strange, Hades.” He was at a loss for words at the girl smiling innocently, looking up at him with a fascinated expression. “It’s been so long since we’ve met; are you gonna hurt my feelings?”</p>
<p>Hades removed himself from her lips, and Persephone’s hanging jaw closed shut. His breathing quickly became rough, his tongue twitching a little. Persephone’s lips puckered up as if she couldn’t let go of him for even a second. Excitement flared up in her head as if she had been waiting. Then, suddenly, Hades stepped out of the hallucination of sinking into a swamp.</p>
<p>“You’re really a nymph?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Don’t make me ask you a third time.” Hade’s voice was strained a little, resisting her charms.</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me like that. I don’t like being called that.”</p>
<p>“Well why can’t you answer me? Niasis. Because you know that a mere nymph can’t leave my territory without crossing Acheron again.”</p>
<p>Persephone regretted her own lie. If she had imagined him to recite the name Niasis with such gusto, she would never have chosen it.</p>
<p>How long has she waited for this day of freedom again only to be treated so cold-heartedly? She looked up at him, frowning at the surging sorrow coming from inside. However, she was able to feel the distance between them just by looking in the eyes of the man whom she pleased just a moment ago.</p>
<p>“Nia—”</p>
<p>Persephone pleaded, holding Hades’ hand tightly.</p>
<p>“Hades, even though my feelings are hurt, I still end up coming back to you. I couldn’t be honest with my adored mother… Breaking away from those annoying other nymphs, you’re the only one I want to see. It’s been that way since I first met you. Don’t you believe me? If so, what am I supposed to do?”</p>
<p>“Niasis.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t call me Kore…”</p>
<p>Kneeling on the bed, Persephone’s quick hands grabbed Hades’ cheeks. She squeezed so hard that her fingers were all worn out. The fingernails dug in and made a long cut.</p>
<p>Hades looked down at Persephone with a look of indifference and ridicule because he couldn’t even feel pain.</p>
<p>“I’m upset. You pissed me off so much it made me attack you, Hades.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I’ve thought of only you this whole time, but you’ve only been suspicious about me being a nymph?”</p>
<p>“…. Kore.”</p>
<p>In an instant, she spread her arms and wrapped them around his head.</p>
<p>“I really missed you. But I couldn’t come out because my mother was always around. I didn’t know what to do since it was like being in a jail cell. Have you been waiting for me? For how long? Tell me. I’ll never know if you don’t tell me.”</p>
<p>Sometimes when Hades talked to her, there were moments where he felt out of place. It was she who liked and chased him from the beginning, and her feelings have been consistent the whole time. Hades, who was listening to her ever-racing heartbeat, sneeringly blurted out, “There’s a lot more that you don’t know. For example…”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“What it is that I’m thinking right now.”</p>
<p>Persephone felt a hunch, but her reasoning didn’t work properly. Hades’ arms crept around the girl’s back. Her body heat, her warmth; whatever it was, it made his heart flutter. Hades, who had let out a soft groan, pulled her in tighter.</p>
<p>“What in the world are you?”</p>
