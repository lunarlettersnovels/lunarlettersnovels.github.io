            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 27 – A Soft Warning (2)</strong></p>
<p>When Demeter had a strange look in her eyes, Persephone, who felt a pang in her heart, hurriedly spoke.</p>
<p>“That, that, so that thing about the humans was a big deal, huh?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t know? The kids on the island are in a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“… You were so lazy, not listening to a word I said.” Demeter’s eyebrows slowly frowned. When Persephone was discovered not taking proper care of the island’s grains, she wanted to kneel down and apologized. But Demeter already settled her anger about that exhausting situation.</p>
<p>“But still, it’s going to end soon. Everything will go back to normal when Ares seizes Corinth.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Look, Kore. Outside this island, there are mean, nasty humans who even deceive God. Robbers, crooks, and bandits not only plunder grains, but they do everything for their own sake. They certainly have exceptional intelligence, and they don’t even fear God because they’re so arrogant. You have to look back every day and live like you’re walking on thin ice.”</p>
<p>“Those… What made them that way?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes a human being will do anything to escape death. Because no one wants to be in the underworld.”</p>
<p>“They’re that smart?”</p>
<p>“Sisyphos of Corinth is smart, cunning, and bold.”</p>
<p>Persephone closed her mouth slowly. Demeter added in a friendly tone how she accepted her expression.</p>
<p>“Don’t be scared. This place is safe. With everything going on, this is the safest place.</p>
<p>Demeter clasped Persephone’s hand with her slightly scented hand and pressed her lips against the back of it.</p>
<p>“My sweet baby. My Kore.”</p>
<p>Persephone smiled gently and grabbed her hand as well. “Yes, mother. I…”</p>
<p>“Don’t disappoint me. Even if you disappoint me and act without thinking, it will really bother me; even if I do say I love you.”</p>
<p>Persephone intuitively understood the hidden meaning behind the words. <em>Even if I do say I love you, I will severe your love like a sickle slices grain crops. You will never receive such affection just as the same wheat won’t grow in the same spot once it’s cut off.</em></p>
<p>“I know. The day that I betray you will never come. Ever.”</p>
<p>Only then did Demeter’s smile bear a strange shadow. Persephone slipped Demeter’s hair into his finger and played around with it.</p>
<p>“But you know what. Mother. There is one thing that I want—”</p>
<p>“Anything.”</p>
<p>“Coins, I’m curious about them.”</p>
<p>“Coins?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“… If it’s what I think you’re talking about…”</p>
<p>Demeter placed both hands behind her neck to take off the necklace she was wearing. Persephone hurriedly nodded her head. One of Demeter’s precious items that she wore every day was similar to that of a coin. But as only the shape was similar to a coin, it wasn’t a real one.</p>
<p>“Not that, I mean a real coin. I’m just curious.”</p>
<p>Demeter’s watery eyes looked down at Persephone as if it were a big deal. However, she was always generous with what was ‘outside of the island,’ so she didn’t ask in-depth.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, when Notus passes through the neighborhood, let’s ask him about it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>Persephone clung to Demeter’s neck as she hugged her. Demeter, who smiled a little, held Persephone’s small body in her arms.</p>
<p>“Kore.”</p>
<p>“Yes, mother.”</p>
<p>“Just remember”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“In the daytime, the island is yours to the fullest, but at night—”</p>
<p>“‘It’s like the mouth of those who are secretive and cunning.’ I always remember everything you say, and I live by your words.”</p>
<p>Demeter’s merciful hand swept down Persephone’s arm. “That’s a good girl. Caring for the island for so long and finally finding the time to rest, you can go lay down and rest for today.”</p>
<p>Persephone, who tried to walk out of the room, suddenly felt eyes on her and turned her head.</p>
<p>Her mother’s benevolent blue eyes were cold—But still, she looked at her with a warm expression. Demeter asked Persephone, who stood bewitched, “Do you love me?”</p>
<p>Persephone replied, “More than anything in the world.”</p>
<p>And it didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>“The best mother in the world.”</p>
<p>Then she asked her mother, “Do you love me too, mother?”</p>
<p>“That’s nonsense. Of course, I do.”</p>
<p>When Demeter gave her the preciousness, she didn’t know what her daughter was peeking at in her eyes; the love ‘despite that.’</p>
<p>The prisoner deeply loved the jailer who held the key to the most solitary prison on earth. With the one and only love that could never be lost.</p>
<p>Before going to bed, Persephone looked up at her fingertips and reflected on the creases carved on the cave walls.</p>
<p>A smile flashed across her face.</p>
