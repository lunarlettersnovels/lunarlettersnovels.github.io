            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 19 – Want Me (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Playful? You think I’m playing when I avoid the stares from other nymphs and keep the secret of coming into the underworld wandering around just wanting to meet you?”</p>
<p>“Nias—”</p>
<p>“I said call me Kore!”</p>
<p>Persephone shot up and shoved Hades’ shoulder again.</p>
<p>Pushed back against the sofa, Hades’ eyes met hers at a slanted angle. Her courage to possess such profanity was almost praiseworthy, so he was left speechless; but far from being angry, he was too caught up in her rage to do anything.</p>
<p>Persephone, who had been staring at him for a long time, bent down to an inch away from Hades’ eyebrows, as if she thought she had gone too far, and hugged him.</p>
<p>“It hurts my feelings when you talk like that.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You’re starting to hate me, right?” Sneakily, she throws a question at the nape of his neck, pouting her lips. Her voice faints, as if on the brink of tears. A wet fondle that incites a difficult desire.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“If you keep making me feel bad I’m not going to come again.”</p>
<p>The thing that was incited from the honest purity was a quasi-affectionate thirst. Hades rested his hand on her chin and lifted her head. “What do you want?”</p>
<p>“Kiss me.”</p>
<p>She was like a blind servant who seemed to follow him whenever he ran away and always came running no matter which direction he pushed.</p>
<p>Hades caught his breath for a moment and pressed the urge, then, with his eyes glued to his heart’s content, kissed her lips.</p>
<p>“What do you want from me?”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“Child, tell me what you want.”</p>
<p>Looking into her eyes, he would gladly nod his head yes even if she asked him to bring back the dead.</p>
<p>“Want me.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I want you to want me.” Persephone held Hades’ cheeks tightly and said, “Give me death; give me you.” She pulled up the drooping tip of his lips.</p>
<p>Apart from acknowledging desire, Hades also looked down on Aphrodite’s s3xuality and Artemis’ purity. When the promiscuous and the innocent fall into the land of the dead, the difference is not as much as a sheet of paper, and just as those who cried out for spiritual love when they drank the water from the Lette River—How can they not laugh at him for forgetting as if he has never been in love? But it was quite sweet to say that the girl’s lips were a love that was out of this world. Strangely.</p>
<p>“… to ask for the underworld.”</p>
<p>A hunger for morbid affection apparently set fire to a morbid desire.</p>
<p>Death doesn’t send back those held in its arms. That’s why death dominates over wealth, to accumulate wealth like that. Greed is lurking in everything underground and can eat anything, whether bitter or ripe. The nymph was foolish. She had thrown away the chance to escape twice.</p>
<p>Her thrusting tongue was bolder than ever. Every time she licked, pressed, and sucked, Hades’ entire head turned chaotic. He groaned with shame at the ferocious thrill and increased his breathing. Lips pressed against cheeks, noses rubbing together, and their bodies pressed together closely.</p>
<p>Persephone, who was wrapped around his neck, felt painfully hot in the spot where Hades’ lips touched. She felt a shock all the way down to her feet.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“Kore—like you said.”</p>
<p>Hades, aware of her stiff arms, whispered in a low groan, “Child, you… don’t have to pull on me like this.”</p>
<p>Persephone didn’t know what to do with her arms, so she lowered them, lifted them, then wrapped them around him again.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? You seduc3d me first, and now you’re playing dumb?”</p>
<p>She obviously wanted to ‘have’ him to herself, but Kore—the nickname she was known by—didn’t have any power over the powerful man. Her mother always forced her to remember what she had to go through, so she only knew it by heart. The heat and excitement boiling inside her felt great no matter what.</p>
<p>Hades’ hand slid down her waist and grabbed her bottom; his breathing exhilarated naturally. Every time his irregular breathing grazed her ears, it felt like a wave crashing into her heart. His tongue licked her earlobe and dug deeper… Persephone couldn’t help but place her ticklish lips on his cheek.</p>
<p>“Oh, Hades… you’re so stiff.”</p>
<p>Hades, who had been tasting her collarbone, neck, lips, and cheeks for some time, groaned low. So low that it was like a feeble plea mixed in with his breathing. Hades gently removed his hand from her lips, grabbed her wrist, and dragged it downward. Her hand stopped between him, who slightly raised his waist, and her lower body. She felt something big and hard.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Persephone’s lips became so small that they were slightly incomparable to her face. It was new to her. Hades slowly guided her hand and placed it on his pen!s.</p>
<p>“Rub it slowly.”</p>
<p>“Uh, I…”</p>
<p>It was unimaginably thick, and she didn’t even know it existed inside his cloak. She wasn’t even able to grip it with one hand and couldn’t familiarize herself with it even after realizing what it was. Hades, who frowned, sighed and ordered, “Grip it tightly.”</p>
<p>“Ummm.”</p>
<p>“Use all of your strength. Like this.”</p>
<p>Hades lifted her chin and kissed her, then Persephone’s hand started going up and down. While doing so she realized that it was longer than the palm of her hand. She touched the velvet-like texture and the bulging veins, and when the long shaft entered her hand, she noticed the sticky fluid dripping from the tip and licked her lips unknowingly.</p>
<p>“It’s wet.”</p>
