            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 35 – Fever of Desire (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p>Hades lifted his head to look at the girl standing in the doorway. She came up and hugged him as he showed his natural frown.</p>
<p>“You didn’t come… so I was wondering if I should look for you.”</p>
<p>She brought with her a faint scent from outside.</p>
<p>Hades’ fingertips softly brushed her bright red earlobe. And he was about to ask what she was doing but stopped himself. He had to decide right now what to do about her. These past two months have been a wake-up call. He has already given too much affection to the things on earth. No, he didn’t mean affection; it felt like he was being dragged.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about with me in front of you?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about what exactly your identity is.”</p>
<p>The girl’s hands pushed him toward the bed and peeled off his robe. “Since we don’t have much time, don’t waste your time about that, Hades.”</p>
<p>Then she covered his eyes with an unknown thin cloth. Hades slowly hugged her and gr0aned as he tried to lift his hand.</p>
<p>“You can’t see a thing if your eyes are closed. But when that happens, the world feels clearer… Don’t doubt it, just trust me.”</p>
<p>Persephone slid her hand down his tight abs and asked, “Can you feel how much I want you?”</p>
<p>Her behavior was much different than before. A sense of incompatibility was clear. When Hades was about to push her off, Persephone bent her waist.</p>
<p>And without hesitation, her lips went around his manhood. She started to suck with the force from when he taught her how to do it the first time. Tongue sliding down the length; lips touching the base; tip piercing the back of her thr0at; she wouldn’t stop even if she felt like vomiting. Hades tried to remove the blindfold but lost all strength in his arms.</p>
<p>Even eyes penetrating the darkness couldn’t see the world beyond the thin blindfold. All he could feel is desire. An unthinkable fever rushed to his head.</p>
<p>‘Oh…”</p>
<p>Smack. Persephone’s head popped up after releasing her lips from the tip of his length.</p>
<p>“You like that?” Then she fell on his stomach and whispered, “Hades, I knew you were ‘the one’ the moment I saw you. Oh, this is the one I’ve been looking for.”</p>
<p>Her soft words burrowed deep into Hades’ heart. Even Siren couldn’t afford to lose such a determination.</p>
<p>“Niasis.”</p>
<p>Her hand softly pinched his chin. She gave him a deep kiss and whispered a warning.</p>
<p>“I said don’t call me that… Can’t you do that for me?”</p>
<p>Suck. Slurp. Hades’ waist stiffened whenever her lips, which held his n!pples, breathed a warm breath. His hands groping her b*tt became impatient. He brushed his hand over the soft, squishy flesh of her rears and squeezed hard; Persephone’s breathing sped up. With his vision impaired his lips and hands were left to her as if she were committed to him. The girl, rubbing his legs between her thighs, m0aned a short m0an and whispered while rubbing the pen!s below, ‘Wait a second.”</p>
<p>Hades thought the weight of her body would ease up from his thigh but then something hot enough to make him flinch fell on his chest. Melted candle wax.</p>
<p>“You! What the hell!” He was so shocked he pushed her off and removed the blindfold, but she, faster than expected, rushed back to him and wrapped her hands around his head.</p>
<p>“Ooomph.”</p>
<p>“You feel that?”</p>
<p>Hades gave out a good moan and grabbed the back of her waist. “That excessive practical joke.”</p>
<p>Her voice melted over his head. “I… That’s how I feel when I think of you, Hades.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“My chest gets hot like that. Like it’s burning. I wanted you to feel it, too. Can you feel it?”</p>
<p><em>What is wrong with this girl? She has lost her mind.</em> She was turned on by the burning pain. Turned on so much that even Hades couldn’t understand it. Why does she love pain so much?</p>
<p>Hades patted her cheek and kissed her deeply. The thirst was overwritten by a pain that had never been felt before.</p>
<p>When Persephone, who had rolled over, began to rub the nodding pen!s below her legs, Hades stopped thinking about whether he should push her away or not.</p>
<p>“Little girl.”</p>
<p>“You like that? That feels good, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Girl, stay here with me.”</p>
<p>She slowly began to shift her weight. The pen!s was swallowed in her soft spot but not wet enough. Her opening was too tight. It brought a feeling of being eaten. Hades knew she wasn’t ready, and she was hurting.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, her waist bounced on its own as the inner walls grabbed his member as if to tear it apart. Hades gritted his teeth, grabbing and pressing down on her th!ghs.</p>
<p>“Oh! Ah…! It’s too big. It hurts, Hades.”</p>
<p>“You… ah.”</p>
<p>The sensation of a long shaft digging along a path opened by a thick tip. Persephone’s th!ghs were trembling. However, she can never run away with her body crouched like this. She soon rose gently, then sank again and began to turn her back gently.</p>
<p>“Do you like it, Hades?”</p>
<p>Hades felt like his brain was melting.</p>
<p>“Do you like me, Hades?”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. You’re making me crazy.”</p>
<p>Hades no longer had the will to deny the current situation.</p>
<p>“Oh… Did you f*ck that other girl like this?”</p>
<p>“You’re speculating… ohh… again.”</p>
<p>“Did you?” The girl’s movements became increasingly bold. “You’re so big I think you’re gonna tear me in half. It’s killing me.”</p>
<p>“That again.”</p>
<p>As her vag!na got wetter and wetter, Hades’ member, which pounded in and out of her, also glistened. It was his first time noticing this. Eventually, Hades, who had been patient for some time, moved his waist up and down to match her speed.</p>
<p>“Oh! Yes!”</p>
<p>“Ooomph.”</p>
<p>Every time he pounded, her body flinched. The heat from her insides being pounded by Hades only caused more excitement.</p>
<p>Every time Hades hit her butt, her moans were shortened like a bobbed scream. Every time his pen!s slid out, the liquid that had soaked down to his test!cles made the sound of watery leather.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Oh! Oh… Hades… Hades…”</p>
<p>Hades, who was soaking in sweat, held her waist and rapidly sped up his pounding.</p>
<p>“Ooooo! Yes, Hades. Yes. I have wanted you like this for so long. Ahhh!”</p>
<p>“Ugh. Be quiet.”</p>
<p>In the end, Hades, who couldn’t stand it and took off his blindfold, knocked Persephone’s body down.</p>
<p>The spot below her abdomen pulsated bright red. There was nothing left to reason with, but he couldn’t stand it whenever he saw her shivering with pain.</p>
