            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 24 – The Besotted King (2)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, several other dead servants, who heard the call of the maid with no eyes, came to where they were. Persephone was surprised at their hideous faces, but her mouth remained sealed. Hades explained. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘They lied to the masters they’re serving.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indeed, they had no mouths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respectfully, the kneeling servants started to carefully wiped Hade’s body with a thin cloth. Completely, from his calves to his ankles. Then, he wiped his wet groin and reached his arm out from behind to grab his clothing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hades was again as wonderful as he was at first, returning to his perfect form as if nothing had happened. And without even looking back, he exited. Persephone’s eyes pitifully followed Hades as he left.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘He’s gone…’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persephone, who had followed his footsteps, which left nothing but deep regrets, sunk herself onto the bed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plop. She rolled around on the sheets and scanned the walls of Hades’ bedroom. There was a side room. It took her a long time to figure out what was flashing in the dark room.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After lifting herself off the blanket and stepping down onto the floor, she opened the door and went inside. There were only shelves and weapon racks, but Hades’ armor stood out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt ecstatic when she imagined a brave god who would have left the weapons to those hard and beautiful bodies and fought against the Titans at the time of Titanomakia. Her hand grazed across a cold metal helmet.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cap of Invisibility. An invisible warrior. It made anyone who wore it invisible, allowing death to spare them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the symbol of Hades and a precious treasure in the underworld. Persephone flashed a grin and reached for the helmet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After countlessly forgetting that even the goddess of the night wouldn’t save them, the Titans curled up again after receiving countless realizations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hades has his own attachment to the underworld. Even though he said he didn’t want it to begin with, he eventually became the ruler of the underworld and has spent endless years here. However, he felt complex feelings about the Titans in many ways—a mixture of sympathy, hatred, disgust, and annoyance. It couldn’t have felt good.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Should have stayed calm from the beginning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radamantis asked when the runaway Titans calmed down and the earth’s axis, which had been raised and split, began to stabilize, “By the way, king, why do you look so happy?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radamantis was one of the judges of the underworld. The one who decided which punishment dead people deserved when they are judged on the nature of their crimes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also protects Tartaros by staying at the tribunal at its entrance. His words were always straightforward as he had a personal hobby of handing down the biggest punishment to criminals who lie.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m in a state of ecstasy.” Hades smiled low and looked down at the ghastly iron door. “I found someone I like.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who is it? Who is the sinful child?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She’s still serving the shadows, so the trial is far from over.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you saying she’s one of Phoibos’ free slaves? When did you go up to the earth? King, you said you liked Phoibos’ free slaves?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radamantis blinked as if he was really surprised. Everyone knows, but Hades was the king of the underworld that completely separated the earth from the underground. He was always indifferent to things on earth. Hades ignored his questions and listened to the sobbing, chanting, and moaning that echoed from deep underground.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t listen too much.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hades turned away.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the Titans were calm again, he would return to the golden royal palace. He recalled the tiny body of a girl who had hugged him and was thirsty for him for a long time. The thought filled his entire body with warmth. Even her unexpected lust was so cute and lovely that it made it impossible for him to endure.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dark, gray world’s palace consisting of almost all brilliant gold is approaching. A living swamp protected the inside and outside of the brass fence, which was surrounded by a vast garden. The swamp flowed nonstop through the garden looking for shelter and food. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something caught Hades’ eye, who was walking across the garden, that made him stop for a moment.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He saw a dead man who had fallen into the lovely swamp that devoured everything, alive or dead. Apparently, he was a servant of the palace. His soul had been chewed up and his skin peeled off with bones protruding by the swamp’s teeth.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The swamp ate anything.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally a servant fell victim to the swamp if they stepped in the wrong place. There can be no other death in death, but tearing one’s soul to shreds will be called a different death.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow the dead man caught Hades’ attention, who was staring at the empty eye sockets. He continued walking. The dead servants of the palace were generally similar, and Hades naturally felt indifferent toward them because he never had an eye for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he felt different for Persephone. He cared for her, and even at this moment, he couldn’t stop thinking about her. What could she be doing at this time? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was one way to find out. He must go home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span></p>
