            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 48 – The Cave by the Cliff (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p>Just like that she seduced him with her whole body and pushed him under the illusion of love.</p>
<p>“Kore—”</p>
<p>He had waited three nights when she didn’t go looking for him, longing to be n@ked with her to caress his shameful heart. Waiting for her to come back and put him to sleep…</p>
<p>What drove him crazier now more than anything else was that he still thought of her oath and consoled himself that her love for him couldn’t be fake. If she made the oath without really loving him, she may have lost her immortality or already fell into Tartaros.</p>
<p>Hades hugged Persephone’s body tightly and thrust his hips. The heat-induced connection took away her sanity. She begged and wept while struggling with his heavy body.</p>
<p>“H-h-hand, ah! Your hand… Loosen it up, Hades! Please loosen it. Take off… oh yes… the blindfold! Hades!”</p>
<p>“You were the one who said that it felt better when you can’t see anything. You feel it now? Oh, how much…”</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>“I’m going crazy…” Hades roughly rubbed his lips against her pampered lips. And Persephone’s body gyrated like he was about to tear her in half. He pushed his tongue in and rubbed and licked the tongue that had deceived him.</p>
<p>Persephone’s breathing reached a high point, and she barely escaped suffocation. As soon as Hades pulled and bit her lips tightly, the vag!nal walls, which were tightening his genitals, contracted as if twitching. Hades, who laughed devilishly and raised his teeth to bite Persephone’s lips, calmly slowed down his waist movement and whispered,</p>
<p>“You like it when I bite like that—”</p>
<p>“Oh! Ah!”</p>
<p>“Would it be a crime if I don’t make it hurt?”</p>
<p>Persephone shook her head, moving up and down on Hades’ chest.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, ohh, Hades. Yes, oh yes!”</p>
<p>“If your ulterior motive was to steal my thing and run away with it, then you shouldn’t have made that irrevocable oath.”</p>
<p>“You misunderstood, Hades, that’s… Ah! I did… oh!”</p>
<p>“No other woman has made me this angry, you’re a real piece of work. I look down on people like you.” Hades bent his waist and pushed deeper inside her, and Persephone buried her forehead in his neck.</p>
<p>“W-w-while I was go-g-gone, did you do this to an-an-another girl? Did y-you?”</p>
<p>Hades stopped for a moment to stare at her. As the silence grew longer, Persephone drew her teeth and bit his neck. The sharp pain from her tight jaw traveled all the way down to Hades’ hips.</p>
<p>“If you did, you really hurt me, Hades.”</p>
<p>It was a truly bizarre deception.</p>
<p>“So what if I did?”</p>
<p>“If you did…”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna find her, ahhh, and kill her….” She was likely to say this even after having putting Phoibos in front of her and standing naked before the eyes of truth.</p>
<p>Hades didn’t know if he should believe her or not from now on.</p>
<p>He no longer had a choice. At the moment when he couldn’t forgive her, he was overwhelmed by her pathetic cry of hope that her oath was sincere. <em>Did she really love me?</em></p>
<p>How long will he move his hips like a beast and embrace her again and again? Splat, splat. Hades put his arms around Persephone and moved his hips, then slowly raised his head. A naked woman and the man ravaging her are in the forest that couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p>“Close your eyes.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The brown eyes lurking in fear lost their gloss in the dark forest. Cyane was on night watch tonight, her mind was on none other than Persephone. For a few days, Persephone remained calm enough to keep the nymphs’ concerns at bay. However, Cyane was not someone to be fooled so easily. She felt like Persephone had a plan, and she couldn’t shake this thought off her head.</p>
<p>“Let’s see where you really go at night.”</p>
<p>There was definitely a reason why Persephone left without the other nymphs knowing. Nowadays, the nymphs had also noticed Persephone’s fingertips were all torn or bruised and slightly scarred. Niasis and Aretusa even made up a joke about it.</p>
<p>“She’s probably secretly building a boat to leave the island.”</p>
<p>Even though it wasn’t funny, Cyane didn’t find it too farfetched. Because she knew how much Persephone loathed this island.</p>
<p>Up until now, Persephone never overly rebelled against Demeter as she was scared of losing her mother’s mercy and love. That’s why she never tried to leave.</p>
<p>After finding that Persephone was no longer insider her bedroom, Cyane quickly left her spot, which was outside the girl’s chamber door, and went outside. Trusting her luck, she searched the island, and soon found herself standing on the edge of the coastal cliff.</p>
<p>Cyane had some skills, although not as much as Artemis’ maidservants whose hobbies were hunting and tracking. After crawling along the edge of the cliff, hearing the sound of the waves pound against the rocks, a darkness she had never known greeted her.</p>
<p>After looking closely, a cave entrance emerged. It was filled with shallow water and so low that a person could barely fit inside.</p>
<p>Upon close inspection, she saw traces of a sure visitor. Could it be Persephone?</p>
