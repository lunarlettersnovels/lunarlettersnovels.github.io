            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 36 – The Punishment for The Sinner (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p>With one arm resting on the bed, Hades rubbed Persephone’s, pleasur!ng her. Persephone, trapped between him and the bed, lifted her head and begged, “I love it. I love you.”</p>
<p>He dared to suck the lips of her, who spoke of love, “Stay here with me if you really do,” He uttered.</p>
<p>“Do you love me?”</p>
<p>“Those words, if you really need to hear them, then I’ll say it a million times. Yes, I do love you.”</p>
<p>The beastly excitement leftover in the place of the reason he fled was embarrassing for himself, but he felt a great sense of compassion about the fact that this girl was in his arms.</p>
<p>It was love. He told her, “I love you. Stay here, and I will do anything for you” as if he were possessed and constantly brainwashed.</p>
<p>“Yes, more, more, harder, more, hurt me! Ah!”</p>
<p>“Make it hurt? Why do you always say that?”</p>
<p>“Because it feels good.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I hate to feel mercy. I’m tired of you having mercy on me.”</p>
<p>Hades had heard that before. Among those who entered the underworld, there were many people with strange barriers, and she was one of them. Hades pushed his whole body up and raised his chin. The trick she had played on him was a clear candle burning shyly, peeping into their affair.</p>
<p>“You mean just like you did to me?” He remembered when she poured candle wax on his back before.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Your disgusting habits.” Hades, who was now holding a half-melted candle, lifted his waist and tilted it right over her breasts. Drip. Drip. The hot wax flowed over her pale chest.</p>
<p>“Ow! Whoa, ahhh.”</p>
<p>“That’s a good girl.”</p>
<p>“Oh… It’s hot! Ow!”</p>
<p>With her waist twisted, Persephone’s breasts swelled seductively. Whenever her white, slender body and narrow waist moved from side to side, the inner walls that were swallowing Hades tightened. She gasped, “It hurts, it hurts” and followed it up, “More, more.”</p>
<p>Hades looked down at her body, flapping naked, and trembled with unfamiliar excitement that he had never felt before. Her cheeks were burning like fire and her saliva-soaked nibbles were hard as she moaned endlessly. As beautiful and s3nsual as the painter’s masterpiece, the excitement was forgotten for a moment. Persephone’s lips in line with Hades drew a thin arc.</p>
<p>“Feels good.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“It feels really good, Hades.”</p>
<p>The faint excitement within him has awakened again.</p>
<p>“Niasis.”</p>
<p>“I said call… me Kore, ahh!”</p>
<p>Hades, after blowing the candle out and setting it back down, pressed down on her thighs. When he thrust in and pulled back as if to pull out his penis, the inner walls held onto him in a roar. He put off all his thoughts as Persephone scream and moaned.</p>
<p>“Oh! Ah! Ohh!”</p>
<p>Hades waist gyrated back and forth. Persephone, who was gasping and crying every time he pounded her with all his might, was so stimulated she started rubbing her cl!toris. The view of her doing that was perfectly sensational, and Hades grabbed and spread her soft, round thighs, and gave a stronger thrust.</p>
<p>Different from before, when it had been dry, clear liquid gushed out from inside Persephone.</p>
<p>“I love you, Hades.”</p>
<p>“You love me, do you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, ah! Hades, I do love you. From when I first saw you— just everything about you… ah!”</p>
<p>Hades, who pushed in with all his strength and pressed her waist tightly, couldn’t repress his laughter. This damn little girl really loved him. The moment he felt a rush and slapped her butt, Persephone’s moan grew longer.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh…!”</p>
<p>Her entire body wiggled and began to tremble. And the inner walls tightened him relentlessly. The liquid flowing out of her rolled down to his testicles.</p>
<p>It was a clear climax that swept her. Persephone closed her eyes as her breasts bounced up and down. Her insides swallowing Hades with convulsions was a surprisingly real reaction.</p>
<p>She shuddered again as Hades kissed her forehead and rubbed her cl!toris.</p>
<p>“Seeing you now…”</p>
<p>“Ahh…. Oh, Hades, yes…!”</p>
<p>Persephone’s face was as red as a beet. She was still madly adorable, so Hades hugged her harder and bent his back.</p>
<p>“I underestimated you.”</p>
<p>Their skin clattering continued for a long time, and as soon as Hades felt a strain in his thighs, he stopped. He dug in deeper, and she begged.</p>
<p>The heat from his entire body swept away, and what remained in its place was pleasant fatigue full of languid.</p>
<p>“How much do you want me, Hades?”</p>
<p>Was this pillow talk? If that’s what it was, it wouldn’t hurt to listen. With Persephone’s naked body hugged up against Hades’, he was so deep in the satisfaction that he could forgive her for what she had done.</p>
<p>“So much that I’m troubled by your pain.”</p>
<p>“If that’s so, could you forgive anything?”</p>
<p>“Forgive?”</p>
<p>“What do you do when someone does something that angers you?”</p>
<p>“I would have to punish that person,” Hades answered truthfully.</p>
<p>The underworld was also a place that distinguished between what was right and what was wrong. Judging was one of his duties, and even though Hades didn’t respond with a passionate belief, he didn’t neglect to fulfill his duties and rules.</p>
<p>“No matter what? Do you punish them somehow? Even if they didn’t do anything wrong?”</p>
<p>Hades noticed that her previous question had penetrated him a completely different way from the one she had asked to check what his thoughts were. Looking down at her, she looked uncomfortable as if she had done something wrong.</p>
<p>“Actually committing a crime is a whole different issue. Why do you ask?”</p>
