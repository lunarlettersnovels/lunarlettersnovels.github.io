            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 21 – Thoroughly Debauched (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p>Hades, after pushing his finger in a little deeper, pulling it out, and rubbing the lips of Persephone’s flower as if playing with it, smiled softly.</p>
<p>“You have the name of a neat and tidy virg!n.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a name… Ah!”</p>
<p>She felt his long finger wiggling inside of her. The reply, which she was about to utter, was swallowed up and suffocated by the sensation between her legs that had now been forced open.</p>
<p>Persephone wanted to burst into tears with the heat and indescribable joy that spread from the innermost parts of her. She was now being pleasured by Hades’ hand in the ‘unseen world’, where she came without her mother’s permission.</p>
<p>“Oh… Ah!”</p>
<p>She tried to crawl forward, but Hades’ hand clung to her thigh. “Don’t run away.”</p>
<p>“Ah! It hurts…”</p>
<p>“You’ll live.”</p>
<p>Poking in and out slowly, he then stared at his dripping finger and sped up. Liquid splashed as he poked, twisted, and rubbed; then he pushed it all the way in and stretched her walls. Persephone arched her back in submission to the frantic sense of friction. The flowing liquid soaked Hades’ fingers instantly.</p>
<p>“Ah yes, that’s it! Oh, Hades!”</p>
<p>“You have to loosen up. Squirming around like this is too much for one finger.”</p>
<p>His other hand slid over her soft rear and smacked it, “Ahh!,” so hard there was a faint red handprint branded on her bottom. Persephone shed tears of joy spread from the burning sensation. Her slightly contracted body slowly loosened up.</p>
<p>“Ease up.”</p>
<p>She struggled somehow to follow Hades’ humble order. Soon Hades, who had taken out his finger, ordered in a cracked voice, “Get ready.”</p>
<p>Persephone’s entire body was trembling. It was too much just to grasp. But it was Hades’ order, and she didn’t want to disobey him. She held back a m@an as he lifted her butt in the air.</p>
<p>“Oh, ah! Wow!”</p>
<p>Soon Hades, who had straightened her back, came up behind her. Persephone felt his hand resting and creeping on top of her bum. Soon something hot and thick pressed and rubbed and pierced her insides. She knew exactly what it was. It was his pen!s that she suck3d so much with her lips that she remembered even the shape with her tongue. The more rigid Hades’ breathing became, the more likely she felt like she was going to choke. On the exhilaration.</p>
<p>“Just a little bit, even if it’s a little uncomfortable at first…”</p>
<p>A rather rugged grip, contrary to his tender words, pulled her hair back. His touch came as a gift over her wet lips. She felt every movement as he thrust. Here and there, their moans and groans were intertwined. It was ecstatic. At that moment, Persephone’s insides pulsated and were forcefully expanding, and the enormous pressure that she had never felt before scared her. His pen!s was stretching out her vag!nal walls—In a place too narrow, even if it had been opened, it had begun to push on his shaft.</p>
<p>“Ah…! Oh my… Yes! Oh! Oh, Hades.”</p>
<p>He took out his and shook it between her rear, stripping away the purity she once possessed. Flapping and beating, but Hades didn’t stop, and when his entire shaft entered her walls completely, Persephone barely reached the point of panting.</p>
<p>“Oooh… ooohh…”</p>
<p>Feeling like her jaw was about to break, her weeping and breathing, like a dying patient, was swallowed up, and she was reduced to pain. Hades pressed himself against her. After the thick tip of his p3nis dug in violently, the pillar-like shaft continued to stretch out her inner walls. Gently pushing himself to Persephone’s deepest chamber, Hades groaned low.</p>
<p>“You’re so tight. More than I expected.”</p>
<p>That’s when he slowly started to move his waist back and forth. He was affectionately violent. He seemed to be worried, and he seemed to be comforting, but he didn’t stop in the end and didn’t even show his will to stop. Persephone was forced to open her legs wider and felt the thickness <em>his</em> crashing through her entire body like a wave. Even at the slightest movement, it was powerful enough to suffocate her. She gripped the sofa and put in all of her strength.</p>
<p>“It hurts, it hurts!”</p>
<p>Hades, who shifted his eyes for a moment and glanced at the veins popping out of Persephone’s hands, licked his dry lips. Soon he grabbed her waist to put more force on her hip. Heavy heat quickly rushed to the narrow entrance where his thick pen!s was thrusting and pounding. It was completely submerged inside.</p>
<p>Persephone’s body trembled whenever she felt him rattling inside her lower belly. The mere sight of it made her whole lower abdomen ache, and she was on the brink of tears. But beyond that—what the hell happened to the inexplicable joy?</p>
<p>“Ah… Hades.”</p>
<p>“Too tight. It’s a bit uncomfortable for me too…”</p>
<p>Tears streamed down her face, and her breathing grew louder. Hades, who looked down at her, smiled as he gritted his teeth. “Should I keep going?” He said while drawing circles on her sensible nub. Persephone couldn’t help but moan.</p>
<p>Hades took it as a “yes.”</p>
<p>His hip movements became more adventurous. He slid out of her and went rushing back in. He sped up his motion and went in deeper. Flap flap flap. The sound of their flesh rang out. A burning heat rose in the spot where Hades’ wet stump hit. He seemed to almost tear her in half.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>Persephone’s vag!na, which had barely been pierced all the way to the bottom, began to spit out bubbles, and the sound of the liquid clattering soon began to grow loud. Hades thrust his hips even more. When the walls closed to fill the gaps where his pen!s had hit, they pulsated violently.</p>
<p>The narrow hot inner walls were unfamiliar enough to make him feel a bit too much, and the girl begging for more was dripping with excitement to the point where she was wet to her thighs.</p>
<p>“Oh! Yes. That’s good.”</p>
<p>Hades pulled at her waist and held her close to him. And her bottom jiggled up and down even more.</p>
<p>“You make me crazy in so many ways, you little girl.”</p>
<p>Persephone’s body trembled, and she moaned as he smacked her rear. The inner walls, which had contracted in an instant and had been engulfing his pen!s, were rather relaxed now. The girl’s red face was like a blossomed flower. Tonight, she was thoroughly corrupted by the Lord of the Underworld.</p>
