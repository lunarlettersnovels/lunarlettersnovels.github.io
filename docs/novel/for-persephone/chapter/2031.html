            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 56 – After Story (4) | 19</strong></p>
<p>“I once missed you so much that I was miserably knocking down the closed door of a cave at dawn. So I know how it feels to long for someone. They’re extremely sad, and if you take good care of them, they’d forever be indebted in your gracefulness and someday become your faithful servants. Hades, look at them. I know you’re that kind of person. I love you even more because of that. So please save their love. According to the rules of the underworld, if Orpheus doesn’t look back before stepping on the ground with his dead wife, he’ll get a second chance. If a man deserves it, he will protect his wife and take her up, but if he doesn’t, he will lose her and not be able to do the shameless act of asking for her again because it’s his responsibility.”</p>
<p>Hades was also worried about their circumstances because they were a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He just might show them mercy. However, the reason why he was unable to speak was that sometimes, or more often, things flow well according to Persephone’s sense. Hades silently looked at her for some time, then shortly replied,</p>
<p>“That won’t be so bad… If he doesn’t turn to look at her until he steps foot on the ground, his wife will have a second chance at life, if he looks back under suspicion, he will lose her forever.”</p>
<p>Hermes, who was leaning against the door when he came out the side door, smirked. Hades didn’t do anything ungodly, not until now.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to tell you because you’ve already heard us. Lead them out, Hermes.” Hades ordered Hermes.</p>
<p>“Are you stupid? How could you play with humans’ love like this? This, this…” Hermes tried to dissuade but when he heard Orpheus and his wife’s cheers, he became silent.</p>
<p>In the room, the couple’s voice burst into tears of joy, thanking Persephone and Hades. Hermes puckered her lips. “Persephone’s living well. Terribly well, I’m surprised.” He commented.</p>
<p>“And when she goes back above ground?” Hades’s eyes zeroed at him.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll keep an eye on her. I’ve already been doing it for years, every time. You, too, Hades. One of the virtues of thieves—”</p>
<p>“If a difficult problem lingers in your mind, give up or rule it out.”</p>
<p>Hermes, with a cane hanging on his waist, stared past the door, which was far invisible from his clear, curved eyes.</p>
<p>“About Persephone, for some reason, she now looks different in person.”</p>
<p>“That’s pointless to say.” Hades blew him off and strode out.</p>
<p>Hermes, chasing after him with his eyes, hummed with his hands folded against the back of his head. “Anyway, it’s Orpheus and Eurydice, I’m betting on their failure!”</p>
<p>A thief also had the temperament of a gambler. They’re not exactly the same idiots in the sense that they’re aiming for a fortune.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Hermes lead Orpheus and started on his long journey again. To shoot for the star and succeed at what many people had only hoped for. Joy tickled his fingers, which had always felt sad tunes.</p>
<p>When he gets back above ground, he’ll play a joyful song on the lyre. He had been lucky enough to get Persephone’s sympathy and get his beloved wife back; was there any more reason to shed tears? However, the road from Hades’ palace to the underworld’s exit gate was a long one. Hermes had said she’d follow close behind him, but he couldn’t even hear his wife’s footsteps. Shuffle. The sounds from his shoes were naturally silent, but he wondered why he couldn’t feel Eurydice’s presence around. If she’d show some kind of sign that she was nearby, Orpheus probably wouldn’t be bothered about it. Even when he leaned his ear toward the back, all that was heard was the sound of Hermes’ feet hitting the dirt before him.</p>
<p>So he said to Hermes, who took the lead a few steps ahead,</p>
<p>“I really appreciate this, Hermes. Thank you so much. My wife will also thank you. Sincerely. That’s true.”</p>
<p>His voice echoed in the wide cave. Eurydice’s voice, which he hoped would answer back in a small voice, was not heard. As an honest woman, she was bound to at least say something. No, they had received orders not to say one word to one another. Sure enough, Hermes was the one to reply.</p>
<p>“Don’t strain yourself trying to talk; follow me quietly and get out. Hades was generous enough to do this. So don’t mess it up. You must be tired from doing all that crying after singing so many loves songs.”</p>
<p>“Oh, uh, I’m sorry. Thank you. I’m yes… uneasy.”</p>
<p>“I can hear your tears flowing.”</p>
<p>“Sorry. Hey, uh, I’m really going back with Eurydice, right? What if she gets lost on the way out? She has no sense of direction. So… though I can’t turn around and look, Hermes…”</p>
<p>Eurydice was following, smiling silently behind Orpheus three steps away. Hermes turned back ahead and muttered,</p>
<p>“What do you think it’ll be like outside?” He asked her. Eurydice’s heart throbbed at his question, but she kept her emotions under control and did not answer, as what she was expected to do. However, her silence further troubled her husband.</p>
<p>No matter what, a god would never deceive Orpheus. There wasn’t even a reason for that, plus Persephone had really looked like a good-natured queen. They crossed the Styx River, cut across a forest path, stepped over skeleton graves, and headed to the exit.</p>
<p>However, the sound of her footsteps hadn’t been heard for over half the day. What kind of expression was on Eurydice’s face right now? Orpheus seriously wondered if his beloved wife’s feet were hurting from stepping on the rough stone ground, or if her feet had gotten dirty in the mud, or, even worse, if she really was trailing behind him and Hermes.</p>
<p>Orpheus froze as soon as he saw the exit in the distance leading to above the ground.</p>
