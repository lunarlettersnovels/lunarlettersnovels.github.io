            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 20 – Want Me (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p>“Can you do it yourself?”</p>
<p>Hades’ long fingers found their way to Persephone’s petal, it was already slippery. Dripping with sticky liquid.</p>
<p>“You’re already wet. Kore—”</p>
<p>“… if you play with me.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to make you impatient.”</p>
<p>His cracked voice melts the savageness that Persephone can’t resist—not willing to refuse. A perfect god. He seemed to be committing a crime just by looking into her eyes. Persephone’s heated face was about to burst. She crept her hand to his meat and slowly began to str0ke it up and down. Slowly lowering his eyes as if savoring her touch, Hades grinned and whispered to himself, ‘That’s good, you’re doing it, Kore—,’ and when Persephone heard the compliment she felt good and stroked faster.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>He gently lowered his eyelids, endured groaning, and wrinkled his forehead, creating an unbearable excitement. Persephone steadily kept stroking up and down faster.</p>
<p>“It feels good when I do it like this, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>After a silent bout of just staring at her, Hades made a gesture with his chin and said, “Kore, get down on your knees.”</p>
<p>As told, Persephone got down on the floor. Hades, who threw off the cloak, sat with his legs spread open. From then, Persephone saw his whole pen!s splayed in front of her eyes. His crimson pole, thicker than her wrist, had a blue vein bulging out as if full of anger, and the embarrassment of facing that for the first time in her life, added to the fact that she touched it a little while ago, made her head dizzy.</p>
<p>“Why are you just looking at it? Keep doing what you were doing.”</p>
<p>Hades, who took a shallow breath, laughed. As Persephone came to her senses and reached out again, Hades’ hand clasped her wrist with force.</p>
<p>“It’s better with your lips.”</p>
<p>Every time his voice melted into sweetness, Persephone felt a shudder down to her toes.</p>
<p>“Put your lips on it. You have to suck it.”</p>
<p>“You mean this?”</p>
<p>Hades didn’t wait for a reply. Immediately he grabbed the back of her head and brought it closer to his bulging pen!s.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He felt the dampness of her lips brushing up against the tip. Persephone felt uncomfortable but didn’t want to stop. As she gently opened her lips, Hades, who held the back of her head, pulled her down. His pen!s, which she thought would never be in her mouth, pierced her throat.</p>
<p>“Mmmph.”</p>
<p>A groan filled her throat with pain in her open jaw. It was thick enough to choke her. As she was breathing shallowly and pitifully, not knowing how to move her tongue, Hades said graciously, “You have to suck it.”</p>
<p>Persephone managed to swallow some saliva. In order not to somehow fall, she gripped his thigh and moved her tongue slowly, licking the shaft and the tip stabbing the roof of her mouth, and pressing hard as if it would shoot right down her throat.</p>
<p>Not really knowing what else to do, she clumsily scraped it with her teeth. Hades looked down and frowned at her. Frozen in surprise at her clumsiness, he placed his hand on her head softly and moved it in a wave motion.</p>
<p>“Be careful with your teeth.”</p>
<p>“Mmm hmm. Mmmph.”</p>
<p>A kind gentleman. She felt a sensation whenever he pushed gently deep into her throat. The t0ngue flicking became more intense, and Hades moaned as if it were quite enough.</p>
<p>His thing, soaked in sal!va, was slick and as soft as velvet. Hades eased up on the hand on her head.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>Every time Hades’ low m0an fell overhead, Persephone responded more enthusiastically. With his tongue, she rubbed the tip against her lips, suck3d the shaft up and down, swallowing it all the way down her throat. Slurping and licking was her passionate way to win his love. She wanted him. No one but him. She was satisfied now that Hades has shown interest in her and expressed that he wanted her.</p>
<p>Persephone’s lips swelled red. Hades gently pulled her head up and stared at her. The tongue of the girl who devoted herself more sincerely than expected was quite good. Every now and then, when she unintentionally scratched her teeth at the tip, Hades felt a thirst for excitement. Without even asking, she put him deep into her throat and gasped for a wet, hot breath. When her hot breath steamed the tip of Hades’ p3nis, which was stimulated to the fullest extent and oozing white liquid, goosebumps spread through his spine.</p>
<p>It wasn’t usual.</p>
<p>But most obscene of all, she was herself. Her cheeks seemed to burst when she looked up at him with a faint smile as if she were drunk on his seeds; as if possessed by a sweet dream; like Medusa, her eyes seemed as if they would capture anything.</p>
<p>“Get up,” Hades ordered to her as he pulled her up. Then he grabbed her waist and bent her over on the sofa. He untied the straggling knot holding her robe closed and threw the robe down; a worthless piece of cloth. Her white bare body greeted him. Persephone, who had her cheek buried in the sofa, looked up at him in a clumsy way. Hades felt a hard desire from her position. Very few women can captivate a man with their eyes and breathing as she does. A stream of excitement with such an innocent face.</p>
<p>Hades, knee-deep on the sofa, slowly spread her legs open, then looked down at the flesh of her moistened lotus flower. It was as nak3d as ever.</p>
<p>“Oh, Hades.”</p>
<p>“Kore— you said, all this time while you were suck!ng me…”</p>
<p>Persephone closed her eyes tightly. Hades put his hand between her l3gs and started to feel around her w3t lips. Persephone, who didn’t stand a chance against the heat spreading all over her body, groaned and pressed her forehead on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Ahh…”</p>
<p>It’s soft, too.”</p>
<p>“Feels strange.”</p>
<p>His finger started piercing in and out of her pulsating vag!na. And then he wiggled his finger around the inside like he was playing with it.</p>
<p>When Hades rubbed the clitoris with his finger, Persephone’s waist had a knee-jerk reaction.</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>Every time his finger was swallowed into the crevice, the sound of liquid swirling around sounded like a kiss. Persephone couldn’t fight the finger piercing her deeper and deeper, and she spread her legs wider. She couldn’t wrap her head around this embarrassment she had never felt before. It was embarrassing every time she felt liquid dripping down her leg.</p>
<p>“Oh, Hades. Oh, Hades…”</p>
