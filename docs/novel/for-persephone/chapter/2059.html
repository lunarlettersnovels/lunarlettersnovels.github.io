            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 28 – The Fear of Losing Someone (1)</strong></p>
<p>The autumn harvest has ended. Over the past two months, an ominous night knocked on the island’s door three times. But when Demeter returned and began to stay, Persephone couldn’t even go out when the sun went down.</p>
<p>Even though she enjoyed her mother’s attention at first, Persephone became nervous as time went by that Hades would forget about her.</p>
<p>As she waited for the right time, a chance to break free for a bit finally came. When her mother left the island for a moment. On the night after Demeter left, Persephone left her abode…</p>
<p>Persephone checked that the nymphs were sleeping and headed to the cave with her cloak on.</p>
<p>The door opened on its own as if waiting for her return, and she stepped down inside without an ounce of fear.</p>
<p>A breeze of wind rushed between her fingers. Bugs were living in the dreary fog, and every time she breathed, she heard them scattering. She was in the basin of the Acheron River.</p>
<p>After her mother had left, the one thing that satisfied Persephone was the fact that she had gotten a gold coin. God of the western wind Zephyros, who dominates the world, brought it at Demeter’s request.</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“Here you go.”</p>
<p>Kharon’s eyes burst open wide when Persephone appeared in front of his boat holding a gold coin.</p>
<p>Earlier, the dead people on board glanced toward her, then lost interest and turned their eyes beyond the fog. Their expressions were as if they had no idea what stood in the distance.</p>
<p>Kharon’s forehead wrinkled.</p>
<p>“You, uh…”</p>
<p>“Can I ride?”</p>
<p>“What are you doing here again? Where the hell did you come from?”</p>
<p>Persephone was very suspicious because it was not his unusual neurotic tone. Was he warming up to her? She was going to tell him off but then decided not to.</p>
<p>She threw a gold coin into his old hat and got on her tippy toes just in case, but nothing happened and Kharon didn’t stop her. The highly satisfied Persephone grabbed the support beam and carefully made her way on board.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at? It’s insulting.”</p>
<p>“You’re the insulting one. You cheeky little bitch. Hades—”</p>
<p>Kharon, who stared at her with a twisted expression the whole time, stopped talking.</p>
<p>“What about Hades? Did he say anything about me? Kharon. Kharon! Answer me!”</p>
<p>“No, just forget about it.”</p>
<p>Kharon remained silent; the boat soon took off.</p>
<p>Persephone tried to pry more but was swept away by the greater excitement and caught off guard by hazy fog. Her heart raced as she felt like she had become one of the dead bodies that roam the underworld. She didn’t even feel the cold, dry air.</p>
<p>As the boat docked, the dead people got off one by one and began walking to a sign pointing toward the Plegeton River like they were on a mission. Persephone also followed behind. Kharon grabbed her and said, “Look here, little kid.”</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“Wait. You’re not even completely dead, so where do you think you’re running off to?”</p>
<p>“It’s annoying when you talk to me like that.”</p>
<p>Kharon’s tone was neurotic, so Persephone also naturally changed her tone.</p>
<p>“Whatever, you’re going to go see the king.” Kharon concluded.</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I have to. So, what were you about to say earlier?”</p>
<p>“You cunning bitch.”</p>
<p>“I know I am.”</p>
<p>Kharon stared at Persephone with annoyance in his eyes, scratching his bearded chin. “Pathetic. Don’t do anything stupid.”</p>
<p>“What would I do?”</p>
<p>“What you said earlier. It’s not too late to return now, girl. It’s dangerous here.”</p>
<p>Persephone sucked her teeth as if laughing at him and turned around to continue following the dead people.</p>
<p>“I said don’t go! You ragdoll.”</p>
<p>Kharon bent over and started rummaging through a box on the boat. Judging by the concerned look on his face, it seemed like he was finally warming up to Persephone after meeting her about six or seven times.</p>
<p>Kharon pulled out a huge blow horn. After muttering “I didn’t want to blow this,” he blew it so loudly, the deep sound that echoed through his stomach spread like a ripple. Persephone rubbed the goosebumps on her arm and screamed, “What the hell are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Now you wait here.”</p>
<p>Without further explanation, Kharon drove the boat back to the fog. Slosh, slosh. The sound of the oars hitting the water faded away.</p>
<p>Persephone, who didn’t have a clue what the blow horn was for, looked around with nervous eyes as she waited. The dead people she had ridden along with had disappeared without a trace. It remained still all around for a long time. Persephone, who had been waiting calmly, thought of the fact that Kharon would be picking her up soon and that she was wasting time now.</p>
<p><em>‘Why did I believe him?’<br>
</em><br>
The night was short and the time more precious than ever. Persephone changed her mind after looking at the sign with eyes full of anguish. And she began walking without any more delay.</p>
<p>Walking for so long, all she saw was thick, hazy fog. Doubt raised whether she was actually able to follow the direction that the sign was pointing to. With no clue about of vast this place was, her steps became even more impatient.</p>
<p>After walking like that for a while she came to a stop. Suddenly, unfamiliar eyes fell on her pale skin.</p>
<p>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh my…’</em></p>
<p>Dozens of eyeballs floated through the mist and approached her.</p>
