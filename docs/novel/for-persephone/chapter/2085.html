            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 2 – Demeter’s Daughter | 19</strong></p>
<p>The hot t0ngue licked her ear softly.</p>
<p>“Are you… Ah, mmm!”</p>
<p>From the thighs to the waist, the man’s hand, which was wiggling up, slid in between her legs. He laughed at the stiff, helpless woman.</p>
<p>“You’re wet even in this situation, a girl like you.”</p>
<p>A ‘part’ of the man lying on her body pushed through her. Inward, inward, and further inward in between her tense legs. The flesh was forcibly opened and it brought unspeakable pain.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, it hurts! It hurts, ah!”</p>
<p>Persephone took a breath and trembled.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you like it when you felt pain?”</p>
<p>She tried to raise her hand and pull the blindfold down, but her wrist was still caught in the man’s grip. The heart— thumping inexorably, beat faster than she ever felt in her life. Whenever the man moved his bottom back and forth, her waist twisted due to the rubbing of flesh on her lower part.</p>
<p>“Ah, hhhh, haa… Ugh.”</p>
<p>“Did you have fun?”</p>
<p>“That…, Ah, mmm, ah!”</p>
<p>“Was it fun?”</p>
<p>“… Ah! mm!”</p>
<p>Persephone closed her eyes tightly and held her breath. Every time he raised his hips and pushed up against her, a mo@n burst out of control. The man stuffed her stiff body with all his might and grabbed her chin.</p>
<p>“…I asked if you had fun deceiving me.”</p>
<p>The pain that filled her belly was difficult to describe. She sobbed his name.</p>
<p>“Lord Hades…!”</p>
<p>It was Hades, the lord of the underworld.</p>
<p>It was ‘him’.</p>
<p>Her inner wall, starting to get wet, remembered his manhood and began to tremble. The body temperature seemed to burn coolly. Kisses poured out. Tongue chasing tongue, lips biting lips, teeth bumping into teeth, quickening, sucking, pulling, crushing… In the meantime, the man’s hips did not stop and stabbed in between the trembling thighs.</p>
<p>“Ah, hhh… Ah!”</p>
<p>The bunch of Narcissus under her back was ruined by the pressure of their weights.</p>
<p>“Did you miss me…?”</p>
<p>The night when the owner of the black carriage ascended to the ground, Persephone was kidnapped.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p><em>Twisted Goddess of the Night, guide me out the door—</em></p>
<p><em>Bring me death at the end of the shore.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Demeter, the goddess of grain and abundance, admired by all, loved her flesh and blood so much that she hid her daughter on an island. The small island sprouted green leaves even in the middle of winter, and the nymphs worshipped it as “a gift from Demeter’s deep motherhood. However, the daughter, the beneficiary of love, knew better than anyone that her mother’s affection was closer to punishment, and that it was a price rather than affection. Because no one knew.</p>
<p>The daughter was the product conceived from sin.</p>
<p>Decades ago, one day. A man, the god of thunder and lightning who was not bound by the morality of men, forced his insatiable lust unto his sister goddess. Since the daughter’s father was the man and the mother was the goddess, it was difficult for her to say she wasn’t a child conceived in tragic—maybe repulsive—disgrace. The mother, who was an innocent goddess with the hubris of self-satisfaction, was worshiped with radiant pride. That is why it would not have been acceptable.</p>
<p>-In that way, I gave birth to you.</p>
<p>The goddess would not have hoped for a child when she was forced by her sibling, picked like a ripened grain unable to resist. However, the child was conceived, and the goddess loved her daughter because she herself was a life-loving abundance.</p>
<p>-Even so, I, your mother, cherish you deeply.</p>
<p>‘Even then’. Motherhood stems from such treacherous feelings. The existence of this island was perfected based on the intoxication toward oneself that must be compassionate in everything, the sincerity that the beautiful child born from colic does not suffer from contempt, and the desire to exist as if it does not exist at all.</p>
<p>That is also considered love. Being safe from the father’s wife, who said she would not forgive her husband’s affair, the small island that was rich in all seasons, and the thought to come and hug her whenever the seasons change were all a form of love. But the daughter was smart, and her awareness of the nature of motherhood was recognized. The world before and after knowing could not be the same. Freedom was an indispensable orientation for self-respect.</p>
<p>However, the world beyond the Ionian Sea was unknown to her, who was called a virg!n on the island. On the island, there were only nymphs who served her mother, as well as small trees, few wild animals, migratory birds. All that was given to her was only time, and what she could do was as narrow as that. It was all about making a corolla while hanging out with the nymphs and picking flowers, tormenting small beasts, climbing a cliff to enjoy the wind, and drawing in her mind the greatness of Mount Olympus that she had never seen before.</p>
<p>A mother’s love that hasn’t changed for decades.</p>
<p>A narrow prison that hasn’t changed for decades.</p>
<p>The daughter once asked.</p>
<p><em>-When will I leave the island and become free?</em></p>
<p>She asked with courage to her mother who looked disappointed.</p>
<p><em>-I am worried that you may resemble him… Whenever you are so stubborn like this. My little Kore (Persephone’s nickname, meaning “virg!n,”) don’t you already know? My thoughts of you, the depth is far from measurable…</em></p>
<p>Then the great goddess answered that it would not be possible because of love.</p>
<p><em>-My good daughter. What made you feel uncomfortable that you would try to disappoint your mother? As I had said, the world outside the island is not full of great adventure, trust, and happiness as you might imagine. Insidious and peculiar bugs are infested in the pit, Warfighters swept away by Ares’ subterfuges rise nearly every day, and miscellaneous mobs like Zeus are spread throughout the world making you frown when you meet them.</em></p>
<p>Demeter said endlessly.</p>
<p><em>-The heads of the weak fall like grains in the rice field, and the sight will give you goosebumps. How can I let you go out to the world such as that?</em></p>
<p><em>-Demeter’s daughter’s suffering? How would I be able to stand it? But don’t worry, I’ll take care of you safely until the day your mother closes her eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>-So don’t say that again.</em></p>
<p>“Yes, mother.” Persephone obediently said.</p>
<p><em>-If so, would you make a promise? Dedicate your love for your mother to the Styx River…</em></p>
<p>I will do that.</p>
<p><em>-Don’t betray your mother. You know that I love you. I forgave Zeus to love you. Even after everything, I still love you.</em></p>
