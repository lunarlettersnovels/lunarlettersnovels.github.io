            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 54 – After Story (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>He didn’t even tolerate it when her breathing, finding familiarity with his fingers, began to regain very slight stability.</p>
<p>The fingers were thrusted one more time. Then he pressed her cl!toris with his thumb; the dull composure—something the king of the underworld had no choice but to possess—disappeared as if washed away with the rapid fingers.</p>
<p>Persephone’s skin heated even more. The soft wet thumb rubbed the narrow and sensitive cl!toris everywhere. She didn’t want it this way. The dense caressing caused excitement all over her body, wetting her butt0cks.</p>
<p>“St-stop it… Oh…”</p>
<p>“While my fingers are thrusting like this?”</p>
<p>“Ah, oww!”</p>
<p>Hades, who continued to wiggle his fingers around inside, tickled her with his fingertips.</p>
<p>Persephone’s body trembled. The inside of her head totally blacked out. As her toes flinched, Hades lifted her legs high and pressed his lips against one of her trembling calves. The sensation of his scratching teeth and licking t0ngue stopped at her ankle.</p>
<p>The thrusting fingers also came out around then. When all of the stimulating senses disappeared, she felt empty.</p>
<p>“Ah… Hades…”</p>
<p>“I want to take my time just a little bit more though.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“You’re all heated up down there, so I have to put something inside.”</p>
<p>Persephone, who gasped heavily, grabbed the table. Hades’ hot pen!s tip touched her opening. She could feel it hot with excitement, making her heart almost burst. He grabbed tightly at her waist and pushed in.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“You will never know how furious I have always felt at this time of your leaving.”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>His thing stopped wandering around the vag!na and opened up a familiar path, heating up relentlessly. It was thicker than her wrist, and it was a mockery to compare the indescribable tip to her finger.</p>
<p>She had become used to his kissing and feeling, but not just that but the penetrating member tip forcing her tight insides open. When it was barely in, the next sensation was the shaft stomping down the squeezing tight path. By the time she felt the sensation of having his entire member inside her, filling up every possible nook and cranny, hitting her deepest core, Persephone had forgotten how to breathe.</p>
<p>“Aaaah!”</p>
<p>However, just like any other time, Hades didn’t stop, and he started moving his body.</p>
<p>Every time he pushed harder and harder inside like a blunt spear, Persephone felt like he was crushing her insides. He pushed in deep, then pulled out, went deep again, and pull back out. The heavy pain was soon to go.</p>
<p>“More, ohh, ahh yes!”</p>
<p>She hooked on to his neck, hanging like a heavy necklace. Bent at the waist, Hades kept his body close to her and pounded so hard she couldn’t pull him in any closer. The flesh on Persephone’s thighs and bottom quickly turned red.</p>
<p>The s3x was closer to the feeling of being swallowed and eaten than to being fully engaged like normal coupling is.</p>
<p>Liquid flowed out from inside her. The soft wetness gradually accelerated the pace, and his hip muscles were tight, unable to loosen up.</p>
<p>“Ah… It hu-hurts!”</p>
<p>“But you still like it. Isn’t that right? You’re so wet.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, yes.”</p>
<p>“Tell me you want more…”</p>
<p>No mercy came from him crashing through her. The table was almost about to crash to the floor, and the rattle sound made her heart pound.</p>
<p>A shackled beast in a fit of temper and a girl promised the eternal love of that beast.</p>
<p>“Oh, Hades! Oh!”</p>
<p>Rationality was exploited. Persephone grop3d his jaw and searched for his lips. She felt like she would choke if she didn’t kiss him. Her t0ngue grazed his, hot breath burning her neck, their excited bodies dancing in the rambunctious rhythm.</p>
<p>They clung together as their bare skin rubbed away. When their kiss got deeper, Hades slowed his waist thrusting down and made it more shallow. He gripped Persephone’s jaw and did not utter a single m0an; it was only through his lips that a thin breath of air flowed out. His eyes and sweat-drenched body full of anguish like a mad dog. She raised her legs higher.</p>
<p>Slightly licking his lips, Hades’ hand poked into the upper corner of Persephone’s robe. Like someone who knew exactly what to do, he rubbed her hard n!pple. Gripping it tightly with his big hand, he squeezed and rubbed, sending pleasant shivers all the way to the soles of her feet.</p>
<p>“Please… Please…! Ah, ah, oh.”</p>
<p>“Please what?”</p>
<p>“Now, please… Ah!”</p>
<p>The moment she was groaning with tears of joy and pain, there was a light knocking sound.</p>
<p><em>Knock, knock, knock.</em></p>
<p>“I’m here, Hades.” It was Hermes’ voice.</p>
<p>Squeak, squeak, squeak. Hades’ shallow waist movement subsided completely. Persephone, who closed her lips tightly and held back the trembles all over her body, shook her head. Her entire body glossy with sweat. Hades, looking down for a long time at her, whose ears were even shining red, shed a gentle smile. He bent down toward her and pressed his lips against hers.</p>
<p>“I brought Orpheus here, who I mentioned last time. Are you busy?”</p>
<p>Persephone frantically hugged his waist. “Please don’t stop, Hades. Don’t go. You know it’s my last night here, ah…”</p>
<p>The kiss was ever so rough. She felt the beating heart from his hard, muscular chest. After the long kiss, a bitter little whisper seeped through.</p>
<p>“How could this be the last time?” He asked her in a raised brow.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean, Hades. You know I can’t sleep alone. While I’m waiting for my departure,”</p>
<p>Slightly smiling, he lifted himself and left her side. Then, he quickly wiped off his sweaty, gorgeous body, and put back on his robe that had fallen.</p>
<p>“You said you will be sleeping? You have an obligation in the underworld before you go back above ground, My Queen. Come.” He, the god of death, turned back around in an instant to go to the gaudy Hermes outside the door.</p>
<p>By now, the heat all over Persephone’s body had subsided, and silence took over. How could she forget? As a queen, she was expected to join Hades in his duties. She shook her head and laughed. Then fixed her messy robe and tried hard to shake off her disappointment.</p>
