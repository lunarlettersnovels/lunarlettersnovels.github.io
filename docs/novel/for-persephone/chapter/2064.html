            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 23 – The Besotted King (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p>Persephone glanced out the window with a faint smile on her face. Estimating how much time it would take. It felt like the time spent with Hades had been cut short, as if they were floating off into an endless eternity in separate directions.</p>
<p>Persephone, who was chasing the moon with her eyes, murmured, “Have you ever seen Hekate?”</p>
<p>“She has Titan roots, so occasionally she comes down to see her brothers.”</p>
<p>“Is she beautiful?”</p>
<p>“She’s loud and rugged.”</p>
<p>“Did Nyx want to give birth to her?”</p>
<p>Hekate, the goddess of sorcery, used to be called the goddess of the wicked night, and she herself didn’t deny it<strong>.</strong> Nyx was a predator of the night.</p>
<p>Persephone has felt some kind of kinship with Hekate over why she allowed her to live in this world. In other words, about the consciousness of whether the mother really wanted to give birth to her.</p>
<p>Would Nyx love her daughter, who is trying to take her place every night? Could that daughter love such a mother? Persephone couldn’t ask because she always watched their nights fall like shooting stars over her head.</p>
<p>“The mother loves her daughter, and… was it decided from the beginning that she would obey her mother?”</p>
<p>Her waist twitched at something. She opened her eyes wide and groaned after feeling something hard rub near her thigh. Her body remembers the pain and joy; one of two she still felt deep inside. Without hesitation, Hades pulled her waist in and rubbed between her legs his raging length.</p>
<p>“… Oh…”</p>
<p>A heavy sensation of it entering in through her swelled opening crawled up from her lower belly.</p>
<p>“At least you’re not obeying your mother anymore.”</p>
<p>“Ah… yes, yes.”</p>
<p>“Kore—that’s what it was, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Hades… Hades, yes…”</p>
<p>“You’ve already shattered everything your mother hoped for.”</p>
<p>Every time Persephone pushed her waist toward him she cocked her head back.</p>
<p>The dry inner walls soon began to drip wet. It was even before the first feeling of being surprised after receiving him and the swelling sensation subdued. A sensation bouncing between pain and joy of the repeated insertion was twined from the tip of her toes. Persephone held on to his chest and gasped.</p>
<p>“Oh, ah, oh….”</p>
<p>Hades, who had slowed his waist movement, squeezed her hips with both hands.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Persephone raised her head in amazement at Hades’ voice. While thrusting his hips gently and penetrating her, Hades sensed another presence in the chamber. Turning his head, he looked around and saw a maid with a pale face. She had no eyes and was therefore, blind.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the maid, Persephone’s face flushed with red. Even redder when Hades shifted their position and let her ride on top of him.</p>
<p>“Oh Hades, ahhh!”</p>
<p>Not convinced that the maid was blind, Persephone tried to slide under his body again, but Hades wouldn’t let go. Instead, he drew a circle and rubbed her cl!toris with his big, strong thumb. Heightened pleasure spread all over the girl’s body.</p>
<p>“Don’t be embarrassed, she doesn’t hold a candle to your skills,” Hades whispered playfully. As he said, the maid was blind.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…”</p>
<p>Squeak squeak. Her whole body trembled at the sensation of him poking and piercing deep inside.</p>
<p>“I have something to say.” The blind maid suddenly announced. Her eyes focused on the bed where gasps and mo@ns were coming from.</p>
<p>“Is it about Thanatos?” Hades replied in a rough, irritated voice.</p>
<p>Hades, who glanced at her flaming-red ears, asked back in a voice that had held in a laugh. Then he put more strength in the hands that held her waist and blatantly raised her up and down and up and down. His glistening wet p3nis was pushed through the girl’s tiny hips and then slipped out.</p>
<p>“Oh, ah…. ah oh…”</p>
<p>Persephone’s shame soon faded into excitement. This was part of her journey in the underworld that wouldn’t be discovered by anyone, naked—literally naked. Regardless of whether the maid had eyes or not. Every time Hades pounded away at her tiny waist, she wanted to hold on to him; to feel him more.</p>
<p>“Radamantis said to tell you, ‘You must have noticed it was empty.’” The blind maid uttered.</p>
<p>Instantly, Hades stopped moving as if she had played a joke on him. It was the night that Hekate didn’t leave. The Titans of Tartaros would be even more furious on a day like today.</p>
<p>“Hades…”</p>
<p>Persephone couldn’t stand the delay. She hugged his torso, twice the size of hers, with pleading eyes. Everytime she wiggled her waist, the p3nis, which was swallowed in and out, was stimulated with no motion on its own.</p>
<p>Hades grabbed the back of Persephone’s head to kiss her forehead and smiled heavily.</p>
<p>“That’s enough for now.” He said.</p>
<p>Persephone hugged his neck and rubbed her lips wildly on his cheeks and chin, “Don’t go.”</p>
<p>“I can’t.” Hades, who frowned without hiding his annoyance, soon erased the expression off his face neatly and pushed her to her feet. Persephone bit her lips as she stood there still exposing her bare waist.</p>
<p>“Do you really have to go now?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“But it’s late.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>*</p>
