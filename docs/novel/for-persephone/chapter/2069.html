            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 18 – Another Woman (2)</strong></p>
<p>The unexpected question evoked a brief silence. Hades looked down at her with a slightly amused face, and gestured towards the door with his chin. Following him outside, Persephone found herself in a royal chamber that looked like a reception room. Regardless of the emptiness of the palace, where it was rare to even see the dead let alone a human, everything from the cleaning to the decorations was perfect, giving it a curious sense of alienation. Sitting on the sofa, she watched his every move.</p>
<p>Hades’ broad back was turned to her as he scoured the charcoal with a kindle. His back was carved with hard muscles, and softness arose whenever he moved his arms or tilted his body; making Persephone drool over his gentle shape. When the fire had risen to some extent, Hades turned around and approached her, seating himself next to her. His arm came around the sofa behind her back, much to her pleasure.</p>
<p>“Why are you smiling?”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer him, instead asked him her own. “You didn’t answer my question earlier. Are you close with that woman?”</p>
<p>Hades lightly pushed her forehead with his fingertips and smiled at her persistence. <em>‘She could make a good thief’</em> he thought to himself and chuckled lightly. “You jealous?”</p>
<p>“Have you kissed her too?”</p>
<p>Hades stared at her as his head tilted. He was at a loss for words. While conversing with this girl, he was always swayed by her immature but strong words.</p>
<p>“Niasis, are you a nymph from the free river? Or do you have someone you serve?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I’m confused as to why you crossed the river and came all the way here? What were you thinking?”</p>
<p>“You don’t want me here?”</p>
<p>“If I say so, will you go back?”</p>
<p>The girl looked remarkably uncomfortable, gripping her doric chiton and glaring at him deeply. But since she had crossed the Acheron River and completely set foot in his territory, Hades felt the need to know some of the girl’s background. The problems and events carried out by other gods on earth, were already having an unpleasant effect on the underground. He didn’t need any more trouble arising in his land.</p>
<p>“You hurt my feelings, Hades.”</p>
<p>“What?” Out of all things that could come out of her mouth, he wasn’t expecting this.</p>
<p>“I had been dying for the day so I could see you again, but you were with that pretty lady instead.”</p>
<p>“She is family and has nothing to do with—” he tried to placate her.</p>
<p>“How could you do this to me?”</p>
<p>She scowled at him while growling in a sulky voice. Hades was embarrassed when her eyes, as sharp as a female cat, turned to him. At the same time, however, it was both chilling and hilarious. His temples throbbed with the onslaught of emotions. It was luck to meet Hermes by chance, but it was the girl’s tenacity that made it possible for them to meet. Her stubbornness seemed pretty unusual. When he spoke again, his voice came out strangely soft.</p>
<p>“I don’t look at that woman the same way I look at you.”</p>
<p>“What do you see me as?” The girl’s cheeks glowed a bright red. Hades realized that he had unconsciously set his eyes on her lips and had been drawn back in.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to be so honest seeing how cute you are, but you shouldn’t mistake my leniency for mercy.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay if you’re ruthless Hades. Actually, I prefer ruthlessness to mercy. Things like pity and coddling get on my nerves.”</p>
<p>A long silence settled. Soon Persephone made a fuss as if she were under a false accusation.</p>
<p>“If I’m so annoying, then don’t kiss me. You’re the one who looked at me with those kinds of eyes, so why are you being so mean? Why did you make me this way?”</p>
<p>“You’re saying that’s all my fault?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not mine. The way you’re so lovely and wonderful, it’s all your fault, Hades.”</p>
<p>Hades buried himself in the sofa seat and closed his lips with his chin resting crookedly on his fingertips. So ridiculous, so cute. What does this girl want?</p>
<p>“Do this, do that, don’t do this, don’t do that, it’s all getting on my nerves. Are you going to continue to say those tiring words Hades?”</p>
<p>He wasn’t a man prejudiced against his desires, and hadn’t lived by rejecting desires. It’s just that up until now, no one had ever bewilderedly wanted him this much. He only looked at the girl, whom he was almost ready to embrace because she was so sweet. He was beware of those who whisper sweet words for no reason. A girl who wasted her time looking for the land of the dead—the land which others wish to leave and never return. Leaning on him with a warm body, destroying parts of the man who doesn’t want to be attached to things on the earth, and slowly planting herself in him. A tree, that he wasn’t sure what fruit it would bear.</p>
<p>“You don’t think I’m as pretty as that goddess?”</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with that.”</p>
<p>“Do you have another woman?”</p>
<p>“Niasis”</p>
<p>“It’s Kore.”</p>
<p>“Kore. Stop acting so childish. You don’t know what you’re asking and what consequences it’ll bring. So, it’s better for me to just watch than be played by you.”</p>
<p>“What did you say to me? You think I’m playing with you?” Persephone jerked his shoulder and glared at him.</p>
