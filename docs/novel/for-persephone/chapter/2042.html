            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 45 – A Trail of Narcissuses (1)</strong></p>
<p>But the nymph’s surveillance wasn’t the reason for Persephone locking herself up in the house. In fact, that was the least of her worries. Let alone unimportant, but it was pointless. She was now in possession of the cap of invisibility, and if she wanted, she could slither herself outside at any time.</p>
<p>Persephone overheard the nymphs’ movements for some time by leaning her ear on the door and smiled softly at the sound of Aretusa and Naiads entering the room.</p>
<p>‘I guess tonight is Aretusa’s night.’</p>
<p>Shortly after, she opened up the secret box hidden under her bed.</p>
<p>It was a kind of treasure box that she has been using since her childhood for presents she received from Demeter, like a still-living corolla flower, a flower ring, a whistle, a shell, etc.</p>
<p>When she stuck her hand inside to feel around the random items, she felt the cap of invisibility grace her hand and she lifted it out. An unbreakable smile spread across her entire face.</p>
<p>‘Hades…’</p>
<p>How much did Hades know by now? The thought alone made her anxious. However, as well as the Ceres situation, she was somewhat convinced by Sisyphos’ advice, so she would be satisfied with it for the time being.</p>
<p>Persephone could hide anywhere at any time if she held onto the invisible helmet. She can possibly also go as far as to secretly leaving the island without the nymphs knowing! Oh my, what a dream came true!</p>
<p>Of course, her wishes were big. And it was a long list. She’d been locked in this island all her life, there was a lot of things in life that she missed. Now, no one could stop her from experiencing those…</p>
<p>Persephone, after kissing the cold metal helmet, placed it back into the box again. With all the struggle in sneaking in and out of the cave to visit the underworld, all ten of her fingertips were torn and cut, she planned to stick around for a few days and behave well like the nymphs hoped she would.</p>
<p>She was about to fall into a deep sleep at Hypnos’ hand gesture.</p>
<p>It was a night when thousands of Nyx’s eyes were flickering over the horizon.</p>
<p>Persephone, who opened her eyes with a sudden chill, looked out the window. Night shadows hovered over the forest. It was silent outside of the locked door.</p>
<p>No matter the degree of the nymphs’ stakeout, getting out was easy.</p>
<p>A small worry crossed her mind. But it was only for a split second and her cloak was within a hand’s reach.</p>
<p>Persephone slid underneath the bed and carefully pulled ‘that thing’ out from inside. And stealthily escaped out the back door. She didn’t even feel the presence of a single nymph.</p>
<p>The forest at night had an unfamiliarity that seemed to be lurking all around, unlike the day. Looking at the narrow path engulfed in the bleak air, she got caught up in the vague feeling of looking down a road she had never walked in her life.</p>
<p>That was especially so today.</p>
<p>A bizarre premonition lifted the nerves all over her body…</p>
<p>She lifted the lamp and looked around. The fallen leaves and the shadows of the branches made it look like the trees were rushing at her with their mouths wide open. The usual sound of waves coming from the distance sounded as if it was sneering at her.</p>
<p>She opened the fence in the front yard. Then noticed a yellow Narcissus lying in the sticky darkness.</p>
<p>‘A Narcissus?’</p>
<p>Narcissuses weren’t a common blooming species on the island, but a rare flower that could be seen very occasionally when seeds that were tired of flying in the arms of Notus and Boreas took root. Why would it be here?</p>
<p>*T/N: Notus and Boreas are two of the Greek Gods of the wind.</p>
<p>Her favorite flowers. Just how lucky could she be?</p>
<p>A faint smile fell on Persephone’s lips, who lifted the flower and smelled it. This made her heart feel at ease. She then discovered another one not too far from where she stood and approached it. When she picked up the second one, the situation felt a bit peculiar. And another flower, another one, another…</p>
<p>‘… What is going on?’</p>
<p>Persephone, who had been following about six or seven wilted Narcissuses in a beautiful embrace, had already reached a secret vacant lot inside the forest that was off the main path. She bent down and picked up the last Narcissus.</p>
<p>Rustles.</p>
<p>Her yellow eyes went wide as she went into a state of alert.</p>
<p>Persephone stood rather calmly and looked around. But in all directions was the forest trees with thin branches and leaves. Her throat went dry, and her heart was racing.</p>
<p>Then she carefully screamed out,</p>
<p>“… Naiads? Cyane? Or Aretusa? Are you following me?”</p>
<p>All she heard in return were the screams of the wind breezing through the forest. But there was ‘clearly’ someone else there.</p>
<p>Persephone, who was about to throw down the bunch of Narcissuss and run out to the main path, was caught by a hand that had reached out at some point. The grip was harder than any other branch and hurt like being caught in an animal’s jaw.</p>
<p>She screamed, but her scream, it never left her mouth…</p>
