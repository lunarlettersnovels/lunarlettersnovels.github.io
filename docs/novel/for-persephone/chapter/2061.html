            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 26 – A Soft Warning (1)</strong></p>
<p>The last room down the hall connected to the nymphs’ bedroom. It wasn’t quite a study since it was only half full of bookshelves, and the tables were too small for it to serve as a restaurant. A small pot furnace about the size of four lamps burned quietly.</p>
<p>Persephone’s toes twisted with nervousness. On the other hand, the nymphs looked as relieved as if they had been rescued from Hera. Finally, Niasis laid down a cushion and blanket for Demeter respectfully and then withdrew.</p>
<p>“Why are you so stiff? Come here.”</p>
<p>Persephone bit her bottom lip gently and approached her. “Mother…”</p>
<p>Demeter brushed her fingers softly through her daughters’ disheveled hair. If there was one mother in the entire world who was the kindest, it was hers. Having seen her for the first time in weeks, Persephone placed her head up against her neck.</p>
<p>“How did you get here, mother?”</p>
<p>“Something bizarre happened recently, and things are going crazy everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Something bizarre? Can you tell me?”</p>
<p>“Some human caused a ruckus. But—”</p>
<p>Demeter, who gently touched the back of her daughter’s head after an affectionate kiss to her forehead, asked, “It’s awfully late now. Where did you go? My Kore.”</p>
<p>“The seaside breeze felt good, so… I went out to take a little walk. Then—”</p>
<p>“I told you that a good girl shouldn’t go out after sunset, but I see you’ve already forgotten that.”</p>
<p>Persephone’s chest started pounding like crazy.</p>
<p>Her mother always had a smile on her face, and no matter what the content was, she never showed any sign of criticism. Just like always. Fear was rising in Persephone’s throat as she looked up because she was afraid of the future when the mercy of the great goddess will no longer be given to her.</p>
<p>“But mother…”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Wherever I am, at any time I know you love me, so what am I supposed to be afraid of? You are everywhere on earth and I am always safe with your love.”</p>
<p>Demeter’s, which hand patted Persephone’s back, touched her wounded elbow.</p>
<p>“This happened while you were out walking?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Did I say something that hurt you?”</p>
<p>A distinct blood clot sat on the wound she got when she had escaped from the cave and climbed the cliff. Persephone tried to hide it, but it was useless.</p>
<p>“You know that your body will suffer if you go out at night; don’t you ever think about that? You still haven’t learned that when worms gnaw at the edges of their grain, it eventually rots the entire straw. The same is true with disappointment.”</p>
<p>Persephone’s shoulders trembled.</p>
<p>The nymphs must have all come early.</p>
<p>“Kore.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Answer me.”</p>
<p>“Sorry for going out without permission. Please forgive me. Mother, I never meant to disappoint you.”</p>
<p>“My sweet baby.”</p>
<p>Demeter skillfully searched the cupboard like someone who lived there and brought a bottle of medicine that the nymphs ground once every spring. Persephone gently extended her elbow toward her. Every time her mother’s soft touch grazed the wound, a pain that shot to her chest made her flinch.</p>
<p>Demeter then asked Persephone to show her knees, as she had noticed from the beginning. She knew that Persephone also had cuts on her knees. Despite the bitter, disgusting smell of the medicine, her mother didn’t care. She noticed the deep bags under her mother’s eyes which looked carefully at the scratches.</p>
<p>Persephone asked, “How big were all the crops?”</p>
<p>“Thanks to your stupid father’s perversions and your uncle’s negligence of life, the ground has rotted, causing an infestation of bugs, and the crops have all wilted.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“No-good bastards.” The cynicism hanging around Demeter’s mouth—more specifically her tongue—was washed away.</p>
<p>“But of course, it will all be taken care of. Ares will catch the gruesome scamps and toss them in Tartaros.”</p>
<p>“Tartaros?”</p>
<p>“The price of deceiving death is the promise of eternal punishment.”</p>
<p>“They deceived you?”</p>
<p>“Your uncle, Hades, was here. He’s a madman who believes that death is lofty.”</p>
<p>Persephone’s heart thumped through her breasts like a hammer. The Hades that Demeter just mentioned seemed like a completely different person. The man whom she just rolled around in bed with.</p>
<p>Her face heated up when she remembered the moment when their bodies had intertwined. She reminded of the pain she felt from accommodating him. And—for a brief moment she seemed to recall the story about her father raping her mother. But it wasn’t the same pain as her mother had felt—she actually enjoyed the pain—rather, it was the total opposite because she wanted him so badly.</p>
<p>“Do you have a bad relationship with Zeus, too?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“I mean Hades.”</p>
