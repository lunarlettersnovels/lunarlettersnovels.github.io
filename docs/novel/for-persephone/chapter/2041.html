            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 46 – A Trail of Narcissuses (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p>Clink, clank. And she could hear the cap rolling across the grasses and stones.<br>
Her mouth was shut, and her eyes were instantly covered. It only took a few seconds for ‘the invisible goddess’ to become ‘the goddess who can’t see’.</p>
<p>The hand, clasped onto her chin and covering her mouth, belonged to a man, she realized. Persephone did not know how to deal with this strange situation as she had never experienced it before. She began to move vigorously to free herself but it was too late.</p>
<p>“Ugh, arghh!”</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t even loud enough.</p>
<p>This was the most secret and safe place on earth that Demeter, her mother, had achieved. It should have been. Living for several decades on this island, she had never seen a ship of humans passing by, and very occasionally, only the gods who ride the wind like a sleigh would pass by. It was an island with no entrance nor exit.</p>
<p>She tried pushing with her feet, shook her head to somehow free herself from the cloth that covered her eyes, but the hands that tied the cloth were too strong.</p>
<p>“Who, who the…!!”</p>
<p>Then she felt the man’s hand grab her hair.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Ahhhh! Stop it!”</p>
<p>Persephone, whose head was forced back, felt the teeth of a man nibbling on her neck, then her body stiffened up.</p>
<p>Her mother’s voice passed by in her head.</p>
<p><em>-The world outside the island is not full of great adventures, faith, and happiness like your imagination… A day doesn’t go by without warmongers who are swept away by Ares’ trickery fight, and those like Zeus are scattered all over the earth and will make you frown… When I think of him, I see goosebumps all over my body…. How can I send you out to such a world knowing that you, my daughter, would suffer?</em></p>
<p>As if mocking her puny attempt to turn over her body somehow, strong arms pulled her waist towards him.</p>
<p>-During the day the island is completely yours, and at night… it’s like the inside of a sneaky, cunning liar’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Hush,” The first thing the ‘man’ has said was an order.</p>
<p>“Demeter hid you away so well…I had a lot of trouble finding you.”</p>
<p>Persephone’s cloak was removed as if it had been ripped off.</p>
<p>And her shoulders shivered mercilessly as a cold spell hit her. The man’s chest was up against hers, and in an instant, the hem of her robe was lifted to her belly. Right then, she could recognize his voice.</p>
<p>“Persephone, Persephone.”</p>
<p>The way he called her name.</p>
<p>The way his tongue slid up her neck.</p>
<p>“Why are you acting so afraid? Didn’t you say you weren’t scared?”</p>
<p>And the way he mocked her. She knew all of it.</p>
<p>She got goosebumps all over her body. The fear that she was taken captive, unable to see anything while disappearing without a trace, and for a reason different from before, her heart began pounding.</p>
<p>‘He has found me.’</p>
<p>The lips of the man in anger touched the back of her ear. As soon as the hot breath brushed it, Persephone became rigid. His hot tongue clung to her earlobe.</p>
<p>‘He has come all this way.’</p>
<p>The thing between the man’s legs was creeping up between Persephone’s thighs. He was clearly turned on, and it wasn’t anger, and Persephone shuddered as much as his weight pressed onto her.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, did you have fun?”</p>
<p>At that moment, the man’s hot thing came rushing in between Persephone’s shrunken legs. The pain of her rigid flesh being forced to spread open gave an indescribable pain.</p>
<p>“Oh… ah!”</p>
<p>“You had fun?”</p>
<p>“… Ah! Ow…”</p>
<p>Persephone breathed in and closed her eyes tightly. Every time her waist moved up, an uncontrollable moan broke out. The man held her jaw open as he thrust in and out.</p>
<p>“… You had fun deceiving me?”</p>
<p>“Hades… Oh, w-were, y-y-you looking for m-me?”</p>
<p>It was indeed Hades, king of the underworld—The lovely girl’s death.</p>
<p>‘In the end, you found me.’</p>
<p>For Hades, darkness was like a second shadow. The night view had no misgivings. However, she expected him to have a hard time finding her because she had his helmet.</p>
<p>The cap of invisibility was unseen even by Titans’ eyes and a perfect weapon that made Phoibos’ eyes, which penetrate all truths, steer away. If one were to run away with it on, they’d never ever ever get caught.</p>
<p>As Hades watched yellow Narcissuses disappear into the dark, he was able to catch the cunning girl. Persephone was caught red-handed.</p>
<p>Hades couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>If the only thing she wanted from the beginning was to steal the treasure of the underworld, why did she swear under the pretext of love? Why hasn’t she fallen to Tartaros yet? And why can’t he shake the illusion that her love is real?</p>
<p>Hades held tight against Persephone’s slender waist, so she couldn’t escape, and lifted her buttocks.</p>
<p>“Oww! It hurts, it hurts. Ah!” She complained as her folds met his raging manhood roughly.</p>
<p>“Don’t you like it like that? When it hurts. Was that also one of your lies?”</p>
