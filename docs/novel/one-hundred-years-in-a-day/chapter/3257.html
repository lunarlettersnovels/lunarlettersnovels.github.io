            <h3><strong>Chapter 266</strong></h3>
<p>“To prevent the situation from escalating further, I should go and release Lady Sorel. I’ll complete my work and return… I ask for your understanding,” Julius said, his tone now measured and cautious.</p>
<p>Julius suddenly realized Duran’s presence in the room. He hastily adjusted his words, making an effort to avoid his usual casual tone. However, the situation was already painfully clear, rendering his efforts futile.</p>
<p>He let out a deep sigh and swiftly exited the reception room. Duran, left behind in confusion, offered an awkward smile. “Then I will inform Father that there’s no need to worry,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’ve disrupted an important event,” I said.</p>
<p>“No, I would say it’s fortunate that it ended with just this.”</p>
<p>Duran added, subtly casting a glance at Kaichen’s hand still resting on my shoulder. Clearing his throat lightly, he lowered his head when Kaichen shot him a glance and continued, “Please take some time to rest, considering how startled you must have been.”</p>
<p>“I apologize; I will make amends properly for today’s events,” I replied.</p>
<p>“No need for apologies. It’s more because I failed in properly hosting His Highness’s guest.”</p>
<p>Duran offered a gentle smile, bowed deeply with courtesy, and exited the reception room.</p>
<p>I intended to rise and see him off, but I found myself held in place by Kaichen, who continued to grasp my wrist. He was well aware of the breach of etiquette but made no move to release me.</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this?” I asked with a slight frown.</p>
<p>Kaichen regarded me with a steady gaze. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You’re making me appear as though I lack proper manners.”</p>
<p>“I don’t view it that way, so there’s no issue.”</p>
<p>“It makes me uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s only natural… Well, yes. We’re the ones who disrupted that event… Yet we were unable to offer a proper apology or bid farewell to the person who followed us out of concern. Doesn’t that bother you?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“His Highness must have been quite surprised. He was unaware of everything.”</p>
<p>“An ignorant fool remains foolish.”</p>
<p>Kaichen eased his grip, and my wrist was suddenly free. Although I had requested him to release me, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of unease when he did.</p>
<p>“It’s not what you think,” I insisted. “Regardless, Lord Duran did us a favor, and I wanted to at least express our gratitude…”</p>
<p>Kaichen, who had maintained an emotionless demeanor, furrowed his brows and turned to question me, “What kind of trouble are you in? You needn’t repay that fellow or even greet him.”</p>
<p>“Why not? We disrupted an event hosted by the Manuwell family… We’re the ones who caused harm. Considering the reason the Duke hosted the party… it’s even more regrettable!”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you? Whether it was Lady Sorel or the Princess who acted or self-harmed, it still makes us victims. We should be the ones who are to be compensated by the Manuwell Duke’s household. I can’t understand your actions.”</p>
<p>“…We disrupted an important event, so it’s only right. In any case, we worsened the situation.”</p>
<p>Kaichen clenched his fist, raising one eyebrow as he did. Now fully facing me, he asserted, “Regardless of the truth, the Princess is the victim. The host of the party where the Princess was harmed will<em> naturally</em> become an important witness in this incident and bear some responsibility. They provided the location and the occasion for the event.”</p>
<p>“Why does that matter…!”</p>
<p>“That’s the way of high society,” Kaichen said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“To prevent such conflicts, the party host must be meticulous and attentive. They cannot act as if high society is devoid of complexity, right?”</p>
<p>“Master!”</p>
<p>Kaichen’s gaze turned icy and distant. It was a chilling stare devoid of emotion, a demeanor he had never displayed to me ever since that confession where we became lovers.</p>
<p>I was on the verge of blurting out in frustration, but my jaw clenched tightly. With just one look, my heart sank heavily.</p>
<p>“Is your desire to apologize related to what happened today, or is it just pity for Duran’s feelings that you couldn’t reciprocate?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Regardless of the reason, I cannot comprehend your attitude.”</p>
<p>Kaichen slowly rose from his seat. It wasn’t as though he had cast a spell to immobilize me, but my body refused to budge.</p>
<p>I could distinctly feel Kaichen’s penetrating gaze, but I couldn’t muster the strength to lift my head. My heart raced with anxiety, and my mind went blank.</p>
<p>I needed to say something, to take some action, but I found myself utterly powerless.</p>
<p>All that consumed me was fear—a profound fear—emanating from Kaichen’s icy, emotionless stare.</p>
<p>“…Haa…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“If you have nothing to say, then go.”</p>
<p>“Mas-!”</p>
<p>My body instinctively jerked, and I raised my head, but all that remained in the empty air was Kaichen’s shimmering golden magic. He had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Even in such moments, his use of teleportation magic was infuriating. He could have at least given me some time. What could be so urgent that he had to resort to teleportation magic?</p>
<p>I thought about how he used teleportation magic as naturally as breathing, but even so, I couldn’t help but feel frustrated.</p>
<p>As I angrily pounded the innocent sofa, my heart continued to race.</p>
