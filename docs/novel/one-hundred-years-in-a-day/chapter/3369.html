            <p><strong>Chapter 154</strong></p>
<p>It was a pity. I felt sorry for Daiman and Duran. Kaichen will just ignore them like he had done with bart.</p>
<p>“It’s been very long, Daiman. You’ve grown up well, Duran,” said Kaichen. This surprised me. Kaichen was kind and friendly to them. Perhaps they had known each other for a long time. But it was not only me who was caught off guard. Daiman looked shocked and Duran’s mouth fell open. I realized that this was their first time being acknowledged by Kaichen.</p>
<p>“So, both of you have received your titles?” continued Kaichen, surprising everyone even further.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s question stirred up the surroundings. Everyone seemed shaken by the fact that Kaichen had acknowledged them and was open for conversation. <em>Well, no one is as surprised as the two of them, </em>I thought, watching the expression on their faces. It was as if they couldn’t believe Kaichen could be this friendly.</p>
<p>“I just tried to add a little more effort on top of your brilliant teaching.” Daiman lowered his head slightly as if he was feeling shy. His cheeks seemed to have turned a bit red.</p>
<p>I looked at Duran with my eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“We still have a long way to go to be of help to His Highness. If you teach us, I think we can improve even more.”</p>
<p>Like their appearance, their personalities were also completely different. Daiman had probably met Kaichen before, and Duran was only now getting acquainted properly.</p>
<p>“Efforts never betray you.” The answer this time was a little brisk. I didn’t know why there was a sudden change and Kaichen was actually participating in a conversation! I stole a glance at Kaichen then shrugged. Perhaps he was turning a new page in his life and making an effort for a social life. But as he engaged in conversation with Daiman and Duran, other people approached us slowly.</p>
<p>“I hope to see you more often, Countess Alshine, Lord of Acrab.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you’ve been hiding this beauty. Countess Alshine is so humble, too!”</p>
<p>“You are so beautiful I thought I had gone blind for a moment, Countess.”</p>
<p>There were some who approached me with glittering eyes and ulterior motives. I smiled awkwardly, not sure what to say. I glanced at Julius wondering if I should ask for some help since I didn’t want to deal with so many people. But he was engaged in what looked like a serious conversation with Duke Drenis.</p>
<p>Sighing inwardly, I looked at the viscount who had been rambling in front of me for ten minutes now. “Was there a restaurant like that in Heulin? I’ll have to remember and visit there once.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I’ll be glad to show you around if you want.”</p>
<p>He looked like he could be my father. Age difference didn’t seem to matter in this world. He looked proud of himself. I narrowed my eyes. He definitely seemed to be flirting with me.</p>
<p>He was half bald, and his breathing was unstable, probably because he had been rambling nonstop. He looked stupid because he wore so much jewelry. <em>Is he a nouveau riche? These are overly expensive accessories for his title.</em></p>
<p>Unlike the aristocrats who kept their distance because of Kaichen and Julius, the viscount had no such qualms. I hadn’t even agreed to his offer of visiting a restaurant together, and he was already busy making plans about it. Maybe he had other titles which made him powerful enough to push the conversation even when people weren’t interested.</p>
<p>“Oh! I’ll show you the restaurant with a view of the western square! If we go in the evening after sunset, we can see a very nice night view.”</p>
<p>His words reminded me of the restaurant I had gone to with Kaichen. The encounter with that woman and the duel were still fresh in my mind. My lips curled into a smile without realizing it.</p>
<p>“Do you like that kind of place?!” The viscount had taken my smile as an affirmation. He was excited now. I winced and faltered at his loud voice. But he had already moved on to other arrangements of what we would do when we got there: eating, chatting and watching the view.</p>
<p><em>This is troublesome. </em>I wondered how I should reject the offer while sounding polite at the same time. I had learnt polite ways of refusal from Kaichen and Julius before coming here. Kaichen, especially, had told me to reject offers of private meetings like the one viscount wanted.  They said that nobles usually ask for a date by introducing themselves at a ball and then sending a letter. So, I hadn’t paid it much mind because I thought I would have time to think of a reply after receiving the letter. They had told me that nobody would brazenly approach me and openly ask for a private meeting unless the people were already intimate and knew each other well. But the viscount was not following proper etiquette.</p>
<p>I pondered on a proper reply. “She has already been there. So, I think she doesn’t plan to visit it for a while.”</p>
<p>Kaicen was suddenly next to me. He looked at the viscount.</p>
<p>“M-Mr. K-Kaichen?” The Viscount stuttered and took a step back in surprise. He bowed his head in respect as though it was such an honor to have met Kaichen here.</p>
<p>“That was… I was just wondering…”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, please let me clarify.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“She already visited that restaurant <em>with me</em>.”</p>
