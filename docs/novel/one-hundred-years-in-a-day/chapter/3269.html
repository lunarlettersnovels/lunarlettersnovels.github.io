            <p><strong>Chapter 254</strong></p>
<p>Julius posed the question with a serious expression, once again entrusting me with an important task.</p>
<p>Although I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I might be exploiting Yanghwa, the circumstances left me with no other choice.</p>
<p>In the event that the envoy truly originated from Princess Exchetra’s side, the worst-case scenario would involve accusations like ‘Julius kidnapped the youngest princess of the Suran Empire!’</p>
<p>And that could potentially escalate into a war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yanghwa shared stories about her three older brothers and two older sisters, to the point where my ears felt like they might start bleeding.</p>
<p>It became evident that they had a significant sister complex – an intense fondness for their younger sibling. Strangely enough, Yanghwa remained oblivious to this fact.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Princess.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“What would you do if I requested a favor from you?”</p>
<p>“What is it, though?!”</p>
<p>Yanghwa’s eyes widened, and she leaped up, joining me at my side.</p>
<p>Although I was taken aback by her sudden approach, given her state of undress fresh from the bath, her enthusiastic gaze urged me to continue.</p>
<p>“Well, for example, how would you feel about utilizing your position as a princess?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… My status as the princess of the Suran Empire? Why would you need that here?”</p>
<p>“So, hypothetically, if we were to suddenly establish friendly relations with the Suran Empire?”</p>
<p>As I voiced my thoughts with a hint of guilt, Yanghwa’s eyes narrowed, and she playfully nudged my arm.</p>
<p>“So, you wanted to get close to me for my power, huh?”</p>
<p>“Power! Princess, where did you pick that up?”</p>
<p>“You always think I’m so young, right? I know more than you think.”</p>
<p><em>‘Oh, really? What exactly do you know?’</em></p>
<p>I stifled a chuckle and glanced at Yanghwa with slightly blurry eyes, only to find her bursting into laughter before she could say anything further.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, count me in. I’ve been a runaway, so I’ve got no shame… Besides, if you negotiate with my older brother, you might earn a reward.”</p>
<p>“But isn’t that essentially using you? Wouldn’t you feel uneasy about that?”</p>
<p>“Did you treat me kindly just for this?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“It’d be nice… if you weren’t so brutally honest.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Yanghwa shyly smiled, briefly toying with her bobbed hair using her fingers, then nodded. “Still, I think it’ll work out,” she said.</p>
<p>“Why’s that?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s true that you helped me. Even if it was partly for your own benefit.”</p>
<p>“…Princess, if you’re too kind, you might end up losing out.”</p>
<p>“Rosa used to say something similar. But I can’t help it. I already like you, Dalia.”</p>
<p>With that admission, Yanghwa spread her folded fingers, signaling for us to depart. I pursed my lips.</p>
<p>As expected, small and adorable beings possess an undeniable charm.</p>
<p>I struggled to comprehend why I was obliged to accompany Yanghwa to the upcoming party, yet I was resolute in my determination to ensure her safety.</p>
<p>I was prepared to shield the innocent and gentle Yanghwa within a socialite gathering teeming with ruthless and formidable individuals.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The carriage of Count Alshine, a masterpiece crafted by the skilled hands of the Acrab Artisan Association, stood out magnificently. It was the sole such creation within the empire, with a design deemed irreplaceable.</p>
<p>Elegant black roses adorned the fluttering flags, fashioned to resemble exquisite black buds, while the four grand wheels gleamed resplendent gold.</p>
<p>Honestly, I couldn’t help but feel slightly embarrassed by the glamor of the carriage.</p>
<p>“Kyaa! It’s so beautiful!”</p>
<p>I had to admit that it was a stunning carriage befitting a princess from a fairy tale. Yet, the notion of me riding in it filled me with shame, and I had scarcely used it except for formal balls.</p>
<p>As I ascended the carriage steps, a sense of anticipation mingled with a wave of motion sickness, caused me to raise a white flag almost immediately.</p>
<p>It didn’t help when on the carriage’s arrival, the mansion’s employees lined up in unison to bid farewell as we embarked on our journey. Their simultaneous exclamation of “Wow~” resonated in the air.</p>
<p>“Master, I must confess… I find this carriage rather extravagant.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it designed with you in mind by the Artisan Association?”</p>
<p>“True, but… Why the peculiar design? A carriage fit for a princess doesn’t suit me.”</p>
<p>Kaichen tilted his head slightly, casting his gaze between the carriage and myself before offering a smile.</p>
<p>“But it suits you.”</p>
<p>Kaichen, leaving me momentarily speechless, opened the carriage door, extending his hand toward me while offering a graceful bow.</p>
<p>“Please, step up.”</p>
<p>An additional wave of embarrassment washed over me as a series of gasps erupted from behind me.</p>
<p>Unusually, Kaichen wasn’t dressed in his customary official attire, opting for a suit akin to any nobleman’s attire for today’s occasion.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous gathering, Kaichen and I were now openly involved romantically.</p>
<p>Barristan had confidentiality informed me that rumors of our relationship were already circulating within the Alshine Mansion. While it wasn’t exactly a secret liaison, I chose not to address the matter openly, finding humor in the idea of eventually revealing, “We’re dating!”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kaichen’s conduct, portraying himself as a tender escort to his beloved, left me questioning his motives. If this wasn’t an overt display of affection, then what could it possibly be?</p>
<p>Yanghwa, who had shadowed me like a faithful puppy for two months, was well aware of our relationship. Hence, Kaichen’s actions elicited a chorus of “Kya! Kya!” from her, accompanied by playful pokes in my direction.</p>
<p>This girl seemed to be a perfect match for Julius.</p>
<p>Blushing faintly, I approached him. “Ahem! Master, do you realize that sometimes you’re even more audacious than me?”</p>
