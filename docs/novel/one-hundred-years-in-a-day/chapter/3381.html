<p>When I realized I liked Kaichen, I was happy to have him by my side. I was even imagining a future with him. That future didn’t seem impossible if we continued like this. Julius’ struggle for the throne had already begun, and he had to fight Princess Akshetra, who was a real villain.</p>
<p>If we wanted a happy future, Julius had to become the emperor. I could only dream of other things if his story was complete. He is the main character, after all. That was what I had decided but I depended on Kaichen far too much. The bitterness lingered in my heart. This was Heulin, not Acrab. This was a place where there were fierce political wars and people deceived each other. I had to be careful.</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Teacher.”</p>
<p>“Don’t overthink about useless things.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Just don’t ever change.”</p>
<p>I felt like I had been caught doing something wrong. I tried to smile. Kaichen raised his eyebrows and took my face in his hands. It seemed as though he was telling me not to give him a fake smile. I stopped smiling and lowered my head.</p>
<p>“Just, stay by my side, alright?”</p>
<p>“But I am by your side, as usual,” I said, confused.</p>
<p>“But you are making a stupid face.”</p>
<p>He flicked a finger lightly at my forehead like he always did. He then didn’t say anything more and turned his back to me to watch Chushinick and Lamia who were in a conversation a little distance away. He folded his arms and watched. Kaichen stood there appearing stern and intimidating. Whoever said magicians were physically weak was wrong.</p>
<p>Kaichen had practiced swordsmanship unfailingly for the past two years. Every night he would be out with his sword swinging it murderously like a madman. I stared at Kaichen’s back, which was so broad that it covered Chushinick and Lamia from view.</p>
<p>“So? Do you intend to duel me?” asked Kaichen.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I think I will only be able to see His Majesty the Crown Prince tomorrow when the Lady’s honor has been restored.”</p>
<p>Kaichen accepted the duel with a brisk nod.</p>
<p><em>Foolish Chushinick</em>…, I thought. <em>You might not live to see the Crown Prince tomorrow.</em></p>
<p>The sudden news of a duel caused a stir in the restaurant. Kaichen was in disguise, so it seemed people didn’t really know who he was. But they knew Chushinick Petral, a famous knight who was the Crown Prince’s escort and guard. To duel with such a knight seemed no less than a suicide mission. They stared at Kaichen sympathetically.</p>
<p>Kaichen didn’t care much about it. Chushinick saw Kaichen without a sword, so he gave him time to prepare. They decided to meet in the square right in front of the restaurant an hour later.</p>
<p><em>“You should be more careful with your words, Countess. Unlike Acrab, Heulin is a dangerous place where a single world can ruin the whole family.”</em> I recalled Julius’ words. <em>I am so sorry Julius. I made trouble even though you warned me.</em></p>
<p><em>“But your teacher will protect you even if I don’t.” </em>Julius had said that before. Could he see the future? His words had come true. Kaichen had stepped in to clean my mess… again. We moved to the square after a while.</p>
<p>“Teacher, are you really going to fight with a sword?”</p>
<p>“Obviously. It’s a duel.”</p>
<p>“It’s only been two years since you started learning swordsmanship! I heard that Sir Petral is the Crown Prince’s knight…”</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll lose?”</p>
<p>It didn’t really seem like that. I had seen him practice like a madman. But swinging a sword alone was different from dueling a person.</p>
<p>“No, but I am worried that you might get hurt. I can’t live with myself if you get hurt because of me…”</p>
<p>I thought what I said was very cringy. He was the Archmage, after all. He smirked and took out his sword from the subspace.</p>
<p>“Hm… you should worry a little. After all, you said you want to be greedy and have me all to yourself.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Let me tell you one thing.”</p>
<p>“Okay… what?”</p>
<p>Kaichen lightly swung his sword once. I saw Lamia and Chushinick approach. She had a triumphant smile on her face. Kaichen’s face darkened as he watched her.</p>
<p>“You won,” he said. “And you will continue to do so….” I couldn’t properly hear the second part because his voice was so low it was only a mumble. Kaichen looked at my stunned face, smiled and walked to the space to duel.</p></div>
