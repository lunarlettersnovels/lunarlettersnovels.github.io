            <p><b>Chapter 2</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t believe I became that crazy person. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possessing Dalia didn’t seem as pleasant any longer. But it was a waste of time to regret things I can’t control. The only thing I am good at right now is waiting for the time to pass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title of the novel was, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius, the heir of the Blue Dragon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The protagonist was abandoned as soon as he was born and left to wander the streets as an orphan till the age of six. He then saved a person by chance who happened to be the owner of a strong magic tower. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title was so childish, so was the story. I wouldn’t be caught dead reading it. But it was worth reading to kill some time. That was why I was invested in it. To be completely honest, I enjoyed it a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The male protagonist, Julius, becomes friends with Kaichen Tenebre, the first person he meets when he enters the tower. Anyway, the novel prattles on to reveal later that Julius was the long-lost son of the emperor who was lost because of an evil scheme hatched by the enemies.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t very surprising. These types of novels always had this trope of the protagonist’s secret birth and pedigree. The author probably knew this and didn’t use it as a ‘plot twist’ later.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the protagonist, after many trials and hardships, ascends to the title of the crown prince. Five years later, abnormal and banned magic is suddenly detected in the ‘Acrab’ territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The abnormal magic had sealed the place. No one could go inside or out. Kaichen, who disliked practically everything and was always so quiet throughout the novel, shows an interest this time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Kaichen resolves to travel immediately to save Acrab. Julius joined him and asked him to stay by his side. He encouraged Kaichen to take this opportunity to study time magic, which Kaichen was delighted about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius got a helper by his side and one of the strongest powers of magic. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeez, just like royals, taking credit for other people’s work! Kaichen was the one who did everything.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat up. Dalia was trapped in time magic at that time. Dalia couldn’t do anything until Kaichen saved her. Eventually, she lost her mind and lived like that for the rest of her life. The ending was tragic for the character of Dalia. This body I was in would meet her end at the last part of the second chapter. Unfortunately, I woke up in her body…  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually in the novels about transmigration, the characters were possessed at the beginning of the novel. But I dropped here right in the middle of it where the story arc had already developed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The worst thing was that Acrab was already trapped in time magic. Even if it didn’t look like it at a glance, three years have already passed. But Dalia wasn’t able to last three years in time magic…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this time, I’m the owner of this body! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will not go crazy and once I am saved, I will live the rest of my life comfortably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, because Kaichen will definitely come to save Acrab.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I clenched my fist and looked out of the window. I could only see spider-webs covering the whole of the window making it impossible to see anything outside. It reminded me of my doomed future. So very annoying. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crap! Trapped in this freak house! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a step back and stepped on one of the empty bottles. I fell backward, hitting my head on the wall. It hurt immensely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a useless alcoholic!” I yelled. The anger and resentment were too overwhelming. And yelling was of no use. Dalia was me now. Yelling and cursing at her won’t help anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubbing the back of my head, I kicked the bottle away. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is even the point of having such a big, fancy house if it was kept this repulsively? Disgusting!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place is ‘Acrab’, trapped in time, repeating the same day over and over again. Which meant, even if I somehow clean the house, it will eventually return to the state of disrepair no matter how many times I do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only I was awake right now. Everyone would be going about their ‘normal day’, they would be repeating whatever they did on this day for every other day to come. It was a cruel kind of magic. The only person who knew this was Dalia… me. The others just lived the same day repeatedly in the same manner without knowing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It may be better to develop my skills until I get saved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dalia, in the novel, was trapped five years in the time magic surrounding Acrab. There was still two years left until she would be saved. Five years in Acrab would be only a few hours for Kaichen who flew to the place as soon as he heard the news. Which meant, even if I was trapped here for five years, it would be only a few hours outside.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I should get back at least for the people who locked me up here. The flow of the novel is already at the end of the second part, but this novel is about the growth and success of the main character. The more the story develops, the stronger the enemies. I need to be strong to survive.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to live a quiet and comfortable life, but that is also a privilege of those who are strong. If I am weak, I will always be in danger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To makes things worse, I have only read up to the middle of the third part of this novel…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t even know who the most important villain in the story is, or if the main character manages to become the emperor and live happily. The possibilities were endless. The novel had no fixed ending. It is none of my business whether the original story would be messed up or not. I don’t want to die in vain again. There were lots of things I liked doing, and I can still do it…</span></p>
