<p>As I giggled, Kaichen softly kissed my lips and looked up. Even his perspiration rolling down from his forehead was so lovely, so how could I ever hate and loathe this man. Just because the l0vemaking was a bit intense didn’t mean he wasn’t being considerate.</p>
<p>“Then, you’re going to love me more now?”</p>
<p>As I smiled with my eyes, Kaichen m0aned. He straightened his back with his hands around my waist, and his member that was pulsating inside me was begging to move.</p>
<p>My inside was already moist from our earlier release, and he smiled as his length grew inside me. His handsome face looked strained, but his manhood wasn’t.</p>
<p>“I’ll love you until you beg me not to,” was all he said.</p>
<p>He held me closer and thrusted inside deep, hitting a spot that made me gasp and see stars. I squeezed my thighs around him, locking him in an embrace.</p>
<p>There was no way I would ever get sick of his loving.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yanghwa had been asleep for days until Hamal came from the magic tower. The only time Yanghwa would awaken was when the magic was loosened to allow her to eat porridge so she wouldn’t starve. As I fed her, she would complain, half-asleep, that she didn’t like onions.</p>
<p>Suran Empire’s royal family had many siblings, and Ja Yanghwa was the youngest daughter of them all, their small and precious flower. Whatever had brought her to Kalhi Empire–kidnapping or running away–the Suran Empire must be going crazy.</p>
<p>I didn’t understand why novels would give the background of a story later in a book instead of writing it in the beginning. All I knew was that she was the youngest princess of the Suran Empire. Looking at Yanghwa sleeping, I considered whether I should let the Suran Empire know about her situation.</p>
<p>If the current Emperor of Suran and the big brother of Yanghwa learned that his sister was addicted to drugs, how would he react? I imagined him saying he’d rip apart whoever made Yanghwa this way, whether it was Julius, who was protecting her, or the culprit who created the addiction, depending on how the message was delivered.</p>
<p>I should really think of it more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I thought that perhaps the Princess of Exchetra had sent her here for that purpose. I knew it shouldn’t happen, but I could see myself looking hazily at Yanghwa’s brothers, who would barge in with anger.</p>
<p>I sighed while coming out of Yanghwa’s room and went to the drawing room. Since Duke Manuel’s garden party, I needed to get many dresses for upcoming socials.</p>
<p>Julius had ordered me to get fitted into many dresses, promising to send a famous designer from Heoulin. <em>‘You need to learn how to take care of yourself. Aren’t you ashamed of such a pretty face? Why are you wasting it?’ </em>he had said.</p>
<p>I couldn’t refuse him in front of Tristian and Mimi, so I nodded.</p>
<p>As I entered the drawing room, I saw the designer, who looked nervous, and Kaichen, who was sitting comfortably on the sofa. The atmosphere was a bit odd, but Kaichen finished talking while I was coming in.</p>
<p>“You’re saying that the fashion trend in the Empire these days is to be revealing?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes…”</p>
<p>“Even though Heoulin’s weather is consistent and not hot and humid, why is it so revealing? I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“W-well… the trend isn’t just wearing revealing clothes…”</p>
<p>I felt like the conversation between the nervous designer and frowning Kaichen was going to take a long time, so I quickly intervened.</p>
<p>“Ahahaha! Master, what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Dalia, what do you think? This isn’t Sharatan so do you have to dress like that?”</p>
<p>I wanted to ask why he was measuring revealing clothing by the weather, but Kaichen looked at the world through a magical formula, so I could understand why he was thinking that way.</p>
<p>“Master, you like it when I dress like that. Isn’t the reason for dressing like that to hope that others like it?”</p>
<p>Kaichen’s face became stern, and he stopped talking. I turned to the designer, smiled, and told him to make whatever he desired and sent him away. I would have told him my style, but I was lazy and no longer interested after seeing Kaichen’s cute side.</p>
<p>I poked Kaichen’s arm while he was still looking shocked. “Master, don’t you like me attending parties?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” came his curt reply.</p>
<p>“Why? Because young nobles will fall for me?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p></div>
