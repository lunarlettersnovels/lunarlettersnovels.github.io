            <p><strong>Chapter 108</strong></p>
<p>Maybe that was why Julius felt annoyed at Kaichen. He was trying to deal with everything alone without asking for help. Julius always asked Kaichen for help but Kaichen always hesitated. He never asked for help if he could solve something alone, no matter how difficult it might seem for him.</p>
<p>“Maybe you need to rein in your self-indulgence,” said Julius. “I am always the one who has to clean up after you.”</p>
<p>Kaichen eyebrows were raised so high they almost disappeared under his hair.</p>
<p>[I don’t think you, of all people, can say such a thing. Did some part of your brain get damaged? That brain of yours that forgets your own deeds which I have to cover up is really appalling.]</p>
<p>“What? Did you forget? What happened in the past when you used your barrier magic and ordered me to ask for help from the teacher? I told you I could fight, but you took care of it all by yourself as you pleased!” Julius shouted at him.</p>
<p>Kaichen looked shocked at Julius’ outburst then burst out laughing.</p>
<p>[You were deeply stabbed in the side with a sword and were bleeding excessively. You wanted to fight! What do you think would have happened if I had let you? Do you think you would be sitting here all high and mighty?]</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>[You were an idiot. You wanted to use your sword instead of using magic. That’s why you got injured in the first place. You would have died! What were you thinking wielding your aura without any protective magic? You are too reckless for your own good.]</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>[And as far as I know, the teacher also chastised you for being reckless. The way I see it, I was cleaning up your mess and saving your life in the process. You cleaning up my mess? Don’t make me laugh.]</p>
<p>“Ugh! Damn you! You always win, don’t you?” Julius shook his head with a smile. There was no winning with him. “Why did you pick up a fight with the imperial family anyway? Did it even cross your mind how awkward you have made my situation?”</p>
<p>Kaichen sighed.</p>
<p>[I’m sorry about that. The incompetent emperor wouldn’t listen to you, and the ignorant princess wouldn’t back down, so it was necessary to pose an appropriate threat.]</p>
<p>“Oh ho,” mocked Julius. “And you posed that threat believing firmly that the magic tower would actually step forward for you?”</p>
<p>[Well, as long as I have my status there hasn’t changed, it was very likely that they would.]</p>
<p>“You cocky bastard.”</p>
<p>[The imperial family is not yet ready to go against the magic tower. The princess also knows that, so I am hoping this will work and everything will end here.]</p>
<p>“If you hadn’t killed Antares, it would have provided us with leverage,” said Julius. “He would have been enough to overthrow my sister.”</p>
<p>[I couldn’t… stand him breathing after what he did.] His answer was brisk. But his eyes still had rage in them. Julius could only sigh.</p>
<p>“So, Is Countess Alshine awake?”</p>
<p>[Not yet]</p>
<p>“I’ll get in touch with my sister. When would be a good time?”</p>
<p>[As fast as possible]</p>
<p>“Okay.” Julius heaved another weary sigh. The loss of losing Antares was great. However, Julius thought that this way wasn’t all bad either.</p>
<p>Although they are close like brothers, Kaichen rarely interfered in the conflict regarding the throne. When Julius asked for help, he helped. But that was it, He never initiated or stepped forward overtly regarding matters of the throne. He was the Archmage. His every moved was watched by the empire.</p>
<p>He was affiliated with the Magic Tower of the Kalhai Empire but Kaichen was sought after by every magic Tower in the whole continent. Someone like him who kept a low profile suddenly decided to confront Princess Akshetra. For Julius, there was nothing better than this. This would be a warning from the Archmage himself.</p>
<p><em>Is it because of the countess? </em>Julius smiled. She wasn’t ordinary to say the least. She had managed to convince this unyielding man to accept her as his disciple. She was truly something else. Julius felt his irritation subside. He unfolded a blank sheet of paper and dipped a quill in the ink bottle.</p>
<p><em>So, if I lure countess Alshine to my side, Kaichen will be a bonus. </em>In the past, before becoming the Lord of Acrab, Count Alshine, Dalia’s father, was said to have been third-generation nobleman of the empire. Beautiful black roses had bloomed in Acrab.</p>
<p>Julius wondered why such a great family ran only a remote city on the eastern edge and lived so quietly. It was history. But he was curious. If what he had learnt in his study of the empire’s history was true, then Julius hoped Countess Alshine could once again become the Black Rose of the empire. Only then will Kaichen attain his full potential.</p>
<p>Julius wondered if Countess Alshine was more than what met the eyes. If he could win her over, he could win Kaichen over too. Julius pondered how he could win the favour of the elusive countess.</p>
