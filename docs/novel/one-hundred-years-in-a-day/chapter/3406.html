<p><strong>Chapter 117</strong></p>
<p>“If I die in the distant future, what will you do?” When she asked Asta while recalling the memories, he answered unshakably.</p>
<p>“I can’t do anything about it. Because if Princess dies it means that I have already died.”</p>
<p>Asta’s words made her feel a little better when he said that if Akshetra died, he would have already died protecting her. It was unconditional loyalty that was close to brainwashing. Askhetra knows her own future.</p>
<p>Julius eventually becomes emperor, and Akshetra, who committed all kinds of evil acts, is brutally stoned to death in front of the people of the Empire. It would be better not to know such a future, but it was a novel she had already read. The ending of the villainess was refreshing, and the death of the cruel Akshetra gave the readers a catharsis.</p>
<p>However, after becoming that woman, she realized how unreasonable the world was. Just because he was chosen as the main character, this world flowed exclusively around Julius. The good-natured protagonist made her sick to her stomach. A guy who can’t do anything suddenly becomes the main character! Success was already his and failure was Akshetra’s. Living with a fixed destiny was boring; however, it was not in her nature to give up and do nothing, even if a clear death awaited her.</p>
<p>“I can’t just watch my right-hand man die, can I?”</p>
<p>“Princess… Did you really see the future where you will die?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. However, the future has already changed. Dalia Alshine should have been dead already. The future has already changed because of her. Yes… I’ve just confirmed that I might not die too, so I can’t think of this as a huge loss.”</p>
<p>A possibility. Akshetra felt that way when she thought about Dalia Alshine. Even if the events changed a little, the fate of the character did not change. That’s what Akshetra thought before this incident happened. The path of the villain required countless efforts.</p>
<p>It is surprisingly difficult. Good deeds are rather easy. All one had to do was help others or do what they wanted without thinking. Good deeds did not require any special ‘ability’ and it could be done without money. In particular, it was so easy to be a good person in a world where you clearly know what will happen in the future. She once thought about living like that, but it didn’t go her way.</p>
<p><em>‘I did my best.’ </em>But destiny made it so that Akshetra Kalhai must be a villain. It means that as the villain of this novel, she had to do the work given to her. So, she prepared more thoroughly than the original Akshetra and honed her abilities even more.</p>
<p><em>I know I can’t beat Julius, the swordmaster, and Kaichen, the Archmage, even if I do my best. </em>They were crazy people with no weaknesses. So she thought not to try to win by force, but to create a situation that can’t be helped and drive them into a corner.</p>
<p>She made the emperor, who could not forget his beloved empress, addicted to drugs, and turned him into a puppet. She has become the perfect princess: kind on the outside, cares about the people, and can do anything be it politics, economy or culture.</p>
<p>In the original work, Akshetra often expressed her anxiety outwardly and couldn’t hide her temper, so many people murmured about her, but this was not the case now. Many people look up to her. The nobles are dissatisfied with the emperor’s choice to make Julius the crown prince, who cared more about the people than the nobles.</p>
<p>Since the great flow of fate could not be changed, she has changed it little by little. However, the forbidden magic case of Acrab. To give an ordeal to Count Alshine, who was not moving according to her will, Akshetra disguised Momalhaut as a band of thieves and blocked the path of the Mencar Mountains.</p>
<p>In addition, Dalia Alshine had a love-hate relationship with Kaichen Tenebre, so she thought she was a good prey to torment Julius. That’s why he killed Count Alshine and his wife, who tried to join hands with Julius, and disguised it as a carriage accident. It is only at the end of the story that Akshetra’s atrocities are revealed. In the end, all the misfortunes in this world were caused by Akshetra.</p>
<p><em>‘However, that woman is alive.’ </em>That’s how fate changed. The fate of the character did not change no matter what she did. Akshetra couldn’t help but shudder. Even though the long-prepared event went to waste, her heart was pounding and she felt good because she saw a possibility.</p>
<p>“Asta, I always thought that I was the only one who could see the future.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But, thinking about it, it turns out it’s not necessarily like that. Besides me, there may be another person who can see the future.” She smiled. It was chilling.</p>
<p>There is a possessor besides herself. Just becoming aware of that possibility made Akshetra happy with this failure.</p>
<p><em>How can I express this feeling, this joy? What exactly is the excitement that makes my head twitch? What is it that I really want?</em> – Asked Akshetra herself and the corners of her mouth went up automatically.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of dying, Asta.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“I have to work hard to be victorious in this unreasonable battle.” She pushed complicated calculations and thoughts into a corner for a while. Her body heated up with an unexpected shudder. She smiled, reached out and stroked Asta’s hair.</p>
<p>Her precious doll.</p>
<p>A child who will someday die at the hands of Julius while defending Akshetra. A child who will not betray her no matter what. Asta, a loyal right-hand man and the only man Akshetra has ever truly opened her heart to.</p>
