            <h3><strong>Chapter 265</strong></h3>
<p>Julius exhaled heavily and slumped down on the opposite sofa as if he had lost all his energy. He looked defeated, and I found myself at a loss for words.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh my, does he not know?’</em></p>
<p>I knew that over the past two months, Julius had been so busy dividing his time trying to win Yanghwa’s heart that he had practically worn out the mansion’s doors with his comings and goings.</p>
<p>After the initial misunderstanding was cleared up, Yanghwa, who had avoided everyone for a while due to distrust, became quite friendly with him.</p>
<p>In the original work, the two of them didn’t suddenly become lovers. Nevertheless, being friends was a good start.</p>
<p>But beyond that, Yanghwa only talked a little about Julius. She always preferred to follow me around, doing everything together, like having tea, taking baths, or going for walks.</p>
<p>But Julius’s feelings were different. The way Julius acted now, it looked like he was so concerned about his precious Yanghwa getting hurt to the point that he lost control of himself.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, you don’t have to worry. Although Lady Sorel did start the argument first, the Princess handled it appropriately,” I finally found the words to speak.</p>
<p>“But…!”</p>
<p>“It was an accident. Even if Lady Sorel is foolish, she won’t dare to lay a hand on the Princess, who is the Prince’s guest.”</p>
<p>“But the Princess…”</p>
<p>“She was sad and shocked… that’s all. Please don’t give Lady Sorel too severe a punishment.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“The Princess wishes for that, too.”</p>
<p>In my heart, I wanted to prevent Lamia Sorel from causing any more trouble and avoid Yanghwa getting involved in the upper circles of society. Regardless of whether Lady Sorel had hit Yanghwa or not, if this incident escalated any further, it could turn into a serious diplomatic issue with Suran.</p>
<p>Moreover, Lady Sorel was under Exchetra’s side. As the Princess, Exchetra could still change the course of the situation in her favor. Knowing Princess Exchetra, she could do it.</p>
<p>“If possible, I hope this matter doesn’t escalate unnecessarily. That’s also the Princess’s wish,” I repeated.</p>
<p>Before she fell asleep, Yanghwa said she didn’t want to cause trouble for anyone. She had done something wrong but hoped no one would get seriously hurt.</p>
<p><em>“Even though it was unfortunate… it wasn’t a disastrous thing. Let’s just say I played a little trick,” </em>Yanghwa had said. I secretly thought there was no shortage of fools in this world as I comforted Yanghwa to slumber.</p>
<p>Julius had a completely incredulous look in response to my words. Then, as if something had dawned on him, he finally asked me, “Could it have all been an act?” he said.</p>
<p>“Um.”</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>As he said that, he glanced at my face, the calm Kaichen sitting beside me, and even Duran, who had been staring diligently out the window. Julius shook his head in disbelief and let out a bitter laugh, finally realizing how much he had lost his reason. “So that’s why you advised against making a big deal.”</p>
<p>“It was the Princess’s wish…”</p>
<p>Julius let out a sigh while smiling bitterly and leaned his head against the back of the sofa. He stared blankly at the ceiling with his limp body, and his self-deprecating laughter revealed that he had finally realized how irrational he had been. “I lost my rationality to the point where I couldn’t even see that,” he lamented.</p>
<p>“It’s because you were worried…” I said.</p>
<p>“Losing my rationality out of concern for others is the problem.”</p>
<p>Why was that a problem? Well… Yanghwa and Julius had only met for a short two months. But love at first sight was a thing. I don’t know what the trigger was, but something must have made Julius feel something strongly for Yanghwa. I didn’t know exactly what had happened between them in those two months.</p>
<p>But for Julius, who was fighting Princess Exchetra for the throne, the fact that he had fallen in love with someone was not a good sign. Perhaps Kaichen and Duran were also worried about that.</p>
<p>Only then did I feel like I understood why the air in the room was so chilly when I first entered. Both Kaichen and Duran took Julius’s shift seriously.</p>
<p>No one knows if it’s love or just a strong liking.</p>
<p>“Oh, well…”</p>
<p>In any case, Julius had developed a major weakness. He only seemed to have realized it now, so he was probably smiling forlorn.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to say, so I shut my mouth. Duran, who seemed to be thinking the same thing, didn’t say anything, and Kaichen, who had no interest in the first place, was gingerly caressing my shoulder with an indifferent expression.</p>
<p>His touch was so delicate that it tickled. Although my fingers had turned red from Julius’s firm grip, it wasn’t painful enough to make a fuss. Moreover, Julius, who rarely gets impatient, held my shoulders tightly because of his feelings that had spiraled out of control.</p>
<p>I could understand. It was just that Kaichen didn’t have the heart to understand him.</p>
<p>“Do as you say. An envoy will arrive in Suran soon, and we can’t complicate matters… The Princess isn’t seriously injured, so she should recover soon. Please don’t worry, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>She had struck herself on the cheek, but I wasn’t sure how hard she had hit herself. It would take more than a day or two to heal fully. However, bringing up such matters would only further dampen Julius’s spirits, so I kept those words to myself.</p>
