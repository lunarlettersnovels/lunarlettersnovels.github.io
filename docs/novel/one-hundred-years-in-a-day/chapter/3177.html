            <p><strong>Chapter 347</strong></p>
<p>I said I would wait because I believed him. When I think of him, all that comes to mind is his desperate face and his voice calling out to me in agony.</p>
<p>Can I wait without going insane?</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>It’s different from when I waited for Kaichen for a hundred years. Back then, I didn’t even know what he looked like. But now, I am so dependent on him that I couldn’t even breathe properly without him.</p>
<p>“Ha… Haha.”</p>
<p>The hand that had reached out into the void clenched into a tight fist.</p>
<p>The black masses, raging fiercely in the space where no single breeze blew, were familiar. It was my corrupted black magic, which I had disliked. Its presence now felt exhilarating.</p>
<p>“Black never changes no matter what colors mix with it. It’s not contaminated; it’s an absolutely pure color.”</p>
<p>Kaichen was right. My magic wasn’t corrupted. From the beginning, it was a color that didn’t even blink, no matter what it mixed with.</p>
<p>My chest swelled with pride. The terrible pain and the voice that had torn my body to shreds came back to me anew.</p>
<p>Flinch—</p>
<p>My heart pounded fiercely. Though my breath was still shallow, I smiled at the storm of magic swirling inside me like a tempest.</p>
<p>I have already experienced what happens to me, the medium, when I break the magic crystal. I could feel its twinkling presence just as I watched Walter in Northern Hoiore.</p>
<p>But for some reason, I knew it would be okay.</p>
<p>The black rose petals suddenly grew exponentially, covering the entire square. My mind was clear, unlike my wildly beating heart.</p>
<p>“I won’t die.”</p>
<p>I felt a strong conviction.</p>
<p>Stable breathing and unwavering mental strength were said to be important for using more magic power. It was a strange feeling. None of the anxiety and fear that had dominated me until now were present at all.</p>
<p>I just longed to return to Kaichen’s side.</p>
<p>“Kaliate’s lovely child.”</p>
<p>“Poor, pitiful child, who sees the world more beautifully than anyone else, Kaliate can’t bear to see you in pain. So, take my protection. Go back to Kaliate’s side.”</p>
<p>It was you.</p>
<p>You’ve been giving me hints all along, haven’t you? Even though I’ve come this far without realizing it…</p>
<p>For the dear friend whom you miss dearly, I would do anything.</p>
<p>It seemed to say that it was okay if the crystal broke, so hurry and go save him. Don’t worry—you won’t die.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Somehow, my nose tingled, and it felt like tears would come.</p>
<p>I won’t wait until he comes to rescue me. I won’t hope for salvation. Instead, I have to go save him, the man who has fallen into despair because of me.</p>
<p>It’s my turn now.</p>
<p>“Kaliate’s lovely child, please cherish precious Kaliate. Now, don’t sacrifice yourself for me anymore; I hope Kaliate finds his happiness.”</p>
<p>You don’t need to say it; I’ll do that.</p>
<p>There’s nothing special about the beauty of the world. Everything only looks beautiful when you’re with someone you love.</p>
<p>So stop being alone. Stop being lonely.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Six months had passed.</p>
<p>Kaichen seemed on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>There were dizzying moments when he felt like he would lose his mind. Every time, Julius would come over and shake him like a madman, grabbing him by the collar, punching him, and even kneeling to reason with him.</p>
<p>Every time, Kaichen repeated the same words.</p>
<p>“I can’t find a way to save Dalia…”</p>
<p>It was closer to death than despair.</p>
<p>Exchetra happily explained that if he poured out magic as powerful as the magic she had poured into it, the magic circle would break.</p>
<p>But the magic Exchetra used took the vitality of millions. No matter how much of a prodigy he was, he couldn’t use that much mana.</p>
<p>Moreover, the potent time magic accumulated through three instances of time magic was so different from ordinary magic that even if he gathered that much mana, it was uncertain whether he could unravel the magic circle.</p>
<p>With a mocking laugh, Exchetra assured him that if he tried hard enough, he could save her before he died. She said that when he gets old and saves her, only thne will he be able to meet Dalia, to whom no time has passed.</p>
<p>After the final warning that they could no longer be together, Kaichen did not seek out Exchetra anymore. All he did was show the victor the loser’s face and give her a sense of accomplishment every time.</p>
<p>Exchetra confessed to all her secrets and admitted her guilt with satisfaction.</p>
<p>She no longer had any regrets since the long and long game, which she exchanged for her life—her ultimate entertainment—had succeeded.</p>
<p>Kaichen searched and searched for a way to break the magic circle like a madman.</p>
<p>He couldn’t sleep either. Whenever he closed his eyes, he saw Dalia smiling, crying in his arms, and screaming that she was scared.</p>
<p>If he happened to fall asleep, he would see Dalia’s tragic appearance even more vividly and realistically in his dreams. Sleep was impossible.</p>
