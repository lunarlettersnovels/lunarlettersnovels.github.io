            <p><strong>Chapter 18</strong></p>
<p>Subspace magic was in the basic magic I learned. At that time, I was so happy that there was actually a subspace that I had only seen in games and cartoons. I didn’t use it for a long time, knowing that it was useless magic for me, who was trapped in the time magic, but it was also one of the things on my list of magic that I wanted to use once I got out of it.</p>
<p>“Ah! Mr. Kaichen!”</p>
<p>As soon as I picked up the bag, Kaichen appeared outside the gate. I waved my hand happily, proud that I was using teleportation magic without any difficulty. Ignoring my enthusiastic greeting, he gestured for me to follow him. I pushed the still sobbing Angel gently into the mansion and ran to Kaichen. It was not a behavior befit a noble lady, but I had long thrown caution to the wind, along with social etiquettes.</p>
<p>“We are going to the magic tower, right? Oh, I’m excited. It’s my first time!”</p>
<p>“We won’t be going to the magic tower”</p>
<p>“What?! Why? I have no intention of staying in Acrab!”</p>
<p>I had already passed on the responsibility of managing the mansion and handed over my assets to Angel. I couldn’t go back now.</p>
<p>Kaichen walked without a break. “As long as it’s not Acrab, it doesn’t matter where we go, does it?”</p>
<p>“Th-That’s true but…”</p>
<p>“We won’t be going to the magic tower but somewhere else.”</p>
<p>“Wh-Where are we going?” He didn’t answer. “Mr. Kaichen? Where are we going? Exactly what is our destination?”</p>
<p>As if he had decided not to answer, Kaichen closed his mouth tightly. I kept pestering him, but he didn’t tell me. I clenched my fists and glanced at Acrab which became smaller as we progressed further away from it.</p>
<p>I gulped, clenching the strap of my bag and followed him. I was finally able to leave the boring place, but I didn’t feel good at all. I felt like I was just running away.</p>
<p>As questions buzzed in my mind, Kaichen said, “Are you going to be like this all the way?”</p>
<p>He was looking at me quietly. He was telling me to stop bothering him, so I smiled like a fool and turned my back on Acrab and walked with him.</p>
<p>“Are you going to tell me now where we are headed? This isn’t even the direction to Hwangdo Island. It’s not even the way to the magic tower….”</p>
<p>“We are going to a place where we can do our research quietly.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t the tower of magic that kind of place?”</p>
<p>“It will definitely become noisy if you go, so not there.”</p>
<p>What noise would I make at an unfamiliar magic tower? However, it was true that I was secretly studying magic while wandering around, so I decided to let it go and pouted my lips.  “Then where are we going? It isn’t like we are going to your house, is it?” He didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“Oh.” <em>Oh my god. Really?</em></p>
<p>As though my silence bothered him, he said in a voice full of irritation, “I know it might not be the most pleasant arrangement but there is no other way. So, even if you don’t like it, I guess you will have to adjust.”</p>
<p>“Keep in mind that I am trying my best to accommodate a countess,” he said in a cold tone and took the lead.</p>
<p>I looked at his back as he walked forward in quick strides. <em>I am going to Kaichen’s house? </em>I could not believe my ears. The Kaichen, Great Archmage of the continent. I will be at his house which is always shrouded in a veil of secrecy that every magician wants to visit.</p>
<p>What a weird coincidence? Or should I call it luck? His house definitely was a pleasant change because it would most definitely have an abundance of magic research and books. <em>What does he mean I will have to adjust if I don’t like it? Obviously, there would be no better place to learn magic than his place. There is no way I wouldn’t like it.</em></p>
<p>This was a marvelous chance! This was the golden opportunity that I had been looking for, to become his disciple. My gloomy mood from escaping from Acrab lifted a little. I followed Kaichen with longer strides. He might abandon me if I don’t keep up to his pace. Hell, he might use his teleportation magic and disappear if he got annoyed.</p>
<p>“Mr. Kaichen! Are you saying that the two of us will be spending god knows how many days at your house alone?”</p>
<p>I followed him, waving my hand energetically, but Kaichen never looked back. He glared at me once because of my taunts and I burst out laughing and continued teasing him. He then adamantly turned his back on me and walked on, not looking back at me at all. Thus, it came to this that I followed him towards his mysterious house that I had only heard in stories.</p>
<p>Oh, what should I do? I’m a little excited.</p>
