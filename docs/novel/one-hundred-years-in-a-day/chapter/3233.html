            <h3><strong>Chapter 290</strong></h3>
<p>Kaichen finally empathized with Dalia’s words. Exchetra was a chilling individual.</p>
<p><em>‘If making Julius falter isn’t the ultimate goal, then what is it…? Is there a separate purpose for the time magic?’</em></p>
<p>This time, no magic runes were preventing the use of magic. It felt like the end of a hunt, where the prey was within reach but just out of grasp.</p>
<p>His chest felt constricted, making him unable to breathe.</p>
<p>“It’s more complicated than you think. I’ll explain…”</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way, I heard some strange rumors.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“It’s been three days. Do you even know?”</p>
<p>“Know what?”</p>
<p>Kaichen pressed his temples. His tired body was demanding rest for a swift recovery.</p>
<p>Jirata’s brows furrowed. “What, you really don’t know?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t know what?” Kaichen impatiently replied.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Jirata was bewildered as he scrutinized Kaichen. He seemed hesitant about how to convey what he knew.</p>
<p>“No, I also… I heard something about that dark magician… So, ah, sh!t!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Your disciple, Dahlia Alshain, was identified as a suspect in the murder of a noble lady. She was taken under Princess Exchetra’s orders about three days ago…”</p>
<p>While speaking, Jirata subtly observed Kaichen, who appeared oblivious to everything.</p>
<p>Even the Tenebre, who were focused on magical research in the Magic Tower, had a good understanding of how the Empire’s power struggles unfolded. Probably, they couldn’t be completely unaware that Kaichen, who would likely be the next leader of the Mage’s Tower, openly supported Julius.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was unsurprising that the Magic Tower also endorsed the Crown Prince.</p>
<p>However, the news was slow because he hadn’t been outside like Kaichen. Still, there was no way he didn’t know that Prince Julius’s political opponent was Princess Exchetra.</p>
<p>When Jirata heard about Kaichen’s hidden disciple, Dalia Alshine, whom Princess Exchetra had imprisoned, he thought Kaichen wouldn’t remain silent if he found out.</p>
<p>But what he didn’t know was that Kaichen had poured his magical power into the time magic dispelling for three days. He didn’t realize that Kaichen was oblivious to it.</p>
<p>“Uh?”</p>
<p>Kaichen’s reaction was completely unexpected.</p>
<p>“Oh… What?”</p>
<p>Seeing Kaichen’s distressed expression, Jirata glanced at the others, wondering if he had misspoken. Michelle and Saveli had stern expressions, which made Jirata realize that Kaichen did not know the situation.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh, d@mn. This is bad.’</em></p>
<p>The Magic Tower, not to mention the Magic Association, knew how much Kaichen cherished his disciple. It was evident not only from the emotions he displayed toward Dalia but also from how he looked at her.</p>
<p>His feelings extended beyond those of an ordinary mentor.</p>
<p>Jirata grew up in the Magic Tower with Kaichen for a long time, so the moment he saw Kaichen with Dahlia, he knew. He thought, <em>‘So even this bastard knows how to love.’</em></p>
<p>The reason why no one could touch Countess Alshine was because of this. She was the woman and disciple loved by Kaichen, who would be recorded in history as the ‘Great Archmage’.</p>
<p>The official announcement of Dalia Alshine’s imprisonment issued by the royal palace was nothing different from saying they would do whatever it took to expose her crime.</p>
<p>“What do you mean… What are you saying?”</p>
<p>So, in response to Kaichen’s question, Jirata had to swallow his saliva.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details either. That dark mage… he told me the Archmage should not expect his cherished disciple to be all right. When I clarified it, I learned she was imprisoned three days ago.”</p>
<p>Kaichen felt his vision dimming for a moment.</p>
<p>After Dalia was accused, Kaichen went to the Magic Tower to save her. He thought that by revealing the circumstances of Lamia Sorel’s death, Dalia would be excluded as a suspect.</p>
<p>However, as he looked away, time magic was cast on Turbeau. Exchetra, having anticipated that he would react sensitively to the time magic, had known it would take some time to break it.</p>
<p>That’s why she had imprisoned Dalia.</p>
<p>Before replying to Jirata, who was hesitantly watching, Kaichen used whatever magical power he had left and confirmed Dalia’s location. He was fortunate she had a bracelet on her wrist made with his magical power.</p>
<p>His ribs ached, and his chest was so tight that it was difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>Anxiety.</p>
<p>He had been feeling this unfamiliar emotion more frequently recently, and thinking of this, Kaichen gritted his teeth. He needed to find her quickly.</p>
<p>His body was in the worst possible condition, on the verge of losing consciousness, but he had to endure for Dalia. He had to save her.</p>
<p>Kaichen felt suffocated. He wondered if something had happened to her. Afraid she might have received a wound he couldn’t heal.</p>
<p>No other thoughts entered his mind. When he pictured Dalia, the image of the broken Julius came to mind, and his body moved on its own.</p>
<p>“Hey! Going there now won’t change anything…!”</p>
<p>Michelle’s fierce voice was cut off midway.</p>
<p>He used a teleportation spell, enchanted in a way that could be activated from anywhere. Thanks to his magical power being depleted by the time magic dispelling, he realized the amount of magical power required every time he used a single spell.</p>
<p>Did long-distance movement magic require this much magical power?</p>
<p>After using the teleportation spell, Kaichen stumbled around, feeling dizzy. He strained his eyes to see better.</p>
<p>Kugugung-</p>
<p>He thought the thunderous noise in his ears, which he could hear no matter where he was, was strange.</p>
<p>Ssshaaa-</p>
<p>He shivered from a creepy sensation that ran down his skin, and as his vision gradually cleared, he stopped breathing at what he saw.</p>
