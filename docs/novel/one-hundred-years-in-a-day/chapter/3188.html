            <h3><strong>Chapter 336</strong></h3>
<p>Purple energy surged from the surroundings like a tidal wave, converging toward the end of the altar.</p>
<p>“Holy sh!t, what is this…”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but curse at the surreal scene unfolding before me.</p>
<p>Hundreds of nobles attended the ceremony, their bodies emanating purple magic energy like tree trunks. It was a sight beyond belief.</p>
<p>At the altar’s end, Exchetra’s face briefly came into view. Her lips formed a deceptively elegant smile of victory.</p>
<p>“Checkmate.”</p>
<p>I started to yell at her for speaking prematurely but then thought better of it.</p>
<p>Despite the veil obscuring her face and the considerable distance between us, her voice resonated as though she whispered directly into my ear, confirming that I was already ensnared in her spell.</p>
<p>The silver lining was that the purple tendrils couldn’t reach me.</p>
<p>A nauseating feeling settled in my stomach as they wriggled menacingly nearby; they reminded me of tentacles from an alien movie.</p>
<p>It dawned on me that the nobles’ silence wasn’t merely out of respect for the sacred ritual—they were under Exchetra’s spell.</p>
<p>I realized with horror that she was draining their life force into her magic through those purple stems.</p>
<p><em>‘That woman is truly… insane.’</em></p>
<p>How could a mere mortal wield power comparable to Kaichen, the golden dragon incarnate, even if she delved into black magic?</p>
<p>It was a cruel practice, a taboo even among wizards. Exchetra disregarded taboos with impunity; she wouldn’t stop her relentless pursuit of forbidden magic just for that.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but wonder how many lives she had consumed to achieve such power.</p>
<p>Even ordinary humans without magical abilities possessed mana; depriving them of it was akin to stealing their lives.</p>
<p>Human magical potential stemmed from vitality, and depleting mana without cause endangered their existence.</p>
<p>According to mythology, the golden-scaled dragon sacrificed itself to bestow magical powers upon humans. This power, given to humans born from the blue dragon’s sacrifice, resided in their life force, known as mana.</p>
<p>Exchetra recognized that tapping into such life force would exponentially amplify her magic, regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p>It was a ruthless method, devoid of concern for the lives she drained.</p>
<p>My teeth clenched in disgust. The nobles surrounding us were likely already in her control, like a horde of mindless zombies.</p>
<p>I had hoped last night’s ball had gone normally, but judging by the nobles’ condition, something had transpired.</p>
<p>Those like myself who arrived today found themselves bewildered by the sudden strangeness, unable to escape the grasp of the writhing tentacles.</p>
<p><em>‘I need to escape.’</em></p>
<p>It felt like being ensnared by hundreds of zombies!</p>
<p>A young nobleman, confined to minimal movement, stumbled toward her, his eyes rolling back in his head.</p>
<p>“AHH! I hate horror movies!”</p>
<p>I bolted forward without a backward glance at the ghastly figure. Although my instinct urged me towards the exit, I knew it was likely blocked.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a group of black-clad, sword-wielding men approached with an ominous air. No need for closer inspection—I recognized Asta leading them, confirming they were the Momalhaut.</p>
<p>Digging in, I sprinted toward where the tentacles hadn’t extended yet.</p>
<p>Asta’s eyes flashed, his sword drawn as he lunged towards me. Unarmed and facing an armed adversary, the odds were hardly fair.</p>
<p>“Ah! What have I done?”</p>
<p>Dodging the nobles, who suddenly lunged at me with wide eyes, and evading Asta’s sword thrusts was challenging.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you’re wicked—karma returned to me like a boomerang. Wait, no! Weren’t they the ones who kidnapped me in the first place?</p>
<p>My parting gift to him was justified.</p>
<p>Frustration surged, but I frantically chanted a magic spell to preserve my life.</p>
<p>There was no room for other thoughts. Red alarms blared in my mind, urging me to flee first and foremost.</p>
<p>Asta swung his sword with ruthless determination, the blade perilously close.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I completed my spell just as his sword descended.</p>
<p>Riiip!</p>
<p>Asta’s sword sliced through the edge of my fluttering robes as I propelled myself forward and spun around. Rising to my feet, the pain barely registered as I sprinted with all my might.</p>
<p>My magic wouldn’t falter. It never had.</p>
<p>“Ugh…… ack!”</p>
<p>I heard Asta’s brief groan behind me.</p>
<p>No remorse stirred within me. It was a pity he hadn’t perished.</p>
<p>A resilient foe. Even wounded, how could he wield such a formidable sword against a feeble, cowardly creature like me?</p>
<p>I was at a disadvantage!</p>
<p>The spell I used unleashed mid-level magic, creating moisture explosions in the air. While not a water spell, its efficacy depended on a humid environment. But I didn’t expect much in a region known for its temperate climate.</p>
<p>I gathered sweat from my brow and palms, then snapped my fingers. Though sweat comprised mostly salt, it still possessed liquid properties.</p>
<p>The result was insufficient for lethal impact, yet enough to cause discomfort. Asta can’t easily shrug it off.</p>
