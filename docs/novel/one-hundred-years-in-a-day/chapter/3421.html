<p><strong>Chapter 102</strong></p>
<p>I felt really pathetic. But I chose to look on the brighter side. I wasn’t completely doomed yet. I couldn’t hire mercenaries so I was unable to subdue the monsters in the mines but after learning a little magic from Kaichen would surely make me capable enough to get rid of them myself. I could learn barrier magic if I wasn’t able to fight the monsters. It would keep them out of the road to the mines.</p>
<p>Learning new skills always helps you win in difficult situations. I opened the door to the guest room where Kaichen was staying. I should have learnt my lesson. I should have knocked. But this place was so familiar to me that I forgot all about it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Kaichen wasn’t changing his clothes like he had been doing the last time I barged into his room without knocking. He was asleep. The sun filtered through the gap in the curtains and fell on him. He slept soundly. I quietly walked over to his bed and placed the tray of food on the side table. His room was messy, like it had been in the Willow House.</p>
<p>Papers were scattered on the floor. There were three desks in the room. I didn’t know if they were already here or were bought since he started living here. It looked like a hurricane had passed by the room. There wasn’t any space to step on the floor. I tried to sidestep all the papers, taking care not to trample on them.</p>
<p>As I got closer to the bed, I saw his face. He slept so soundly despite the sun shining on him. He had dark circles under his eyes. I wondered how tired he must have been. His face looked serene and calm, almost carefree. I had never seen him like this. He was always on his guard. I observed him in earnest.</p>
<p>His bronze skin was smooth and flawless. His dishevelled bangs fell on his perfect eyebrows. When awake, he always frowned and appeared very serious. But now, his face was calm and peaceful. His sharp nose looked so sculpted. His eyelashes were so long. I hadn’t noticed them before. I knew that his golden eyes rested behind those closed eyelids which when it fell on people rendered them speechless by its intensity.</p>
<p>My gaze fell on his lips. I blushed. I felt like a creep because I wasn’t able to take my eyes off him… I wondered if his lips were soft. His collarbone was visible through his loose shirt. I had been worried about him. The mattresses were too soft in this mansion and wondered if he would sleep okay. But here he was, sleeping like a log, his gold hair dazzling in the sunlight. My rescuer who shone as bright as the sun.</p>
<p>Resting my chin on my hand, I looked at him for a long time. I felt like I would never get tired of watching him my whole life. I remembered that I had painted a portrait of Kaichen when I had been trapped in the time magic. Out of hundreds of paintings that I had made, not one quite resembled Kaichen. Maybe I had poor imagination or perhaps a handsome face like this was impossible to paint into existence.</p>
<p>How can something this beautiful be put down onto a piece of paper? I suddenly wanted to take a photo of him. There was no such thing as a camera in this world. Such a shame, really. I wanted to capture this moment of Kaichen sleeping peacefully without a care in the world.</p>
<p>I had read in the novel that I could make something equivalent to a picture if I knew enough magic. However, the novel hadn’t explained the whole process. Unfortunately, I will just have to imprint this moment in my memory and try not to forget it. I had good memory. Maybe I could remember this forever.</p>
<p>“How are you feeling?” asked a cracked, sleepy voice which startled me from my reverie. His drowsy eyes were open and looking at me while propping himself up on the pillow. “Are you feeling okay?” he asked again.</p>
<p>Even half-asleep and tired, he worried about me. He didn’t even seem surprised that I was here. His gaze made me feel embarrassed. I leaned down and buried my face in the bed. <em>D*mn. </em>I felt myself blush. I was sure my ears were red.</p>
<p>“Dalia,” he called. “Are you still unwell?”</p>
<p><em>When had he started being so sweet all of a sudden?</em></p>
<p>“I-I am fine. I am very healthy,” I managed to croak out. Kaichen was quiet for a while. Was he relieved? Or had he fallen asleep again? I raised my head to look at him. Watching him sleep had been intense enough. Seeing him awake was too bad for my heart. I could feel my heart pounding double hard.</p></div>
