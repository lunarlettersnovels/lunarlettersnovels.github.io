            <p><strong>Chapter 170</strong></p>
<p>“I’ll go too.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes at his firm rejection. It must be because he thought the journey might be dangerous.</p>
<p>“Teacher, the second son of Manuvell sent us an invitation to a tea party today.”</p>
<p>“Are you talking about Duran?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I also have received numerous invitations that expressed desire to spend time with the beautiful Imperial Black Rose.”</p>
<p>“Therefore?”</p>
<p>“I rejected them all but…”</p>
<p>Kaichen’s expression, which had increasingly turned sour, relaxed a bit. Trying not to laugh, I said softly, “If you leave for the North alone, I will be very bored. Maybe it will be a good idea to accept the invitation from Duran Manuvell since he is such a close ally to His Highness.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I have already turned down the invitation. But maybe I can hold a tea party and invite them all?”</p>
<p>“Dalia.” Kaichen frowned softly.</p>
<p>I smiled happily. “Yes, Teacher?”</p>
<p>He clicked his tongue and sighed. “Why do you always choose to do everything I tell you not to?”</p>
<p>“Why not? Do you forbid me to have tea with Duran?”</p>
<p>“I have told you not to get close to strange men.”</p>
<p>“Duran Manuvell is no strange man.”</p>
<p>“He’s a strange bloke.”</p>
<p>Kaichen then went into the instructions he had given me countless times before coming to Heulin. He was adorable.</p>
<p>“If I follow you to the North, Teacher, I wouldn’t even need the tea party to keep me occupied.”</p>
<p>He frowned. “It’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Is it because it’s very cold there?”</p>
<p>“You get cold easily.” Kaichen sighed.</p>
<p>“I want to help.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that simple.”</p>
<p>“I want to check something there. I received a request from Countess Sheliak.”</p>
<p>Kaichen looked displeased. His eyebrows were knitted with worry. When we were almost at the mansion, he stopped walking.</p>
<p>“The Hoiore Estate in the North is currently out of bounds. There is a possibility that magic cannot be used there.”</p>
<p>“I must be thoroughly prepared then.”</p>
<p>“You still insist on following me?”</p>
<p>“Of course! Wherever you go, I will follow you unconditionally.” Kaichen finally smiled and stroked my hair.</p>
<p>I felt like I was being treated like a child again, but it seemed like an expression of his affection, so I accepted it happily. If magic truly couldn’t be used in the North, it would hurt him more than me. For someone who has dedicated his whole life to learning and researching about magic, how will he cope if it is suddenly taken away from him? Maybe he was worried that if he lost his magic, he wouldn’t be able to protect me. His concerns were apparent in the way he stroked my hair.</p>
<p><em>But I can’t let him go alone. If someone is truly behind this, they might be targeting Kaichen for sure. He might be in danger. </em>Even more so if another possessor stood by Akshetra’s side and helped her with whatever she planned. I needed to find out and for that, I must follow Kaichen to the Hoiore Estate. Even if my actions were part of their plan, I had no choice but to follow him. They already knew that my biggest weakness was Kaichen.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Akshetra silently listened to the noble ladies who spoke openly while still being cautious of her gaze.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen such a brazen woman, you know?”</p>
<p>“Oh my God!”</p>
<p>“How can you do such an unscrupulous thing with an Archmage on your back?”</p>
<p>“You must have been really upset.”</p>
<p>Lamia, daughter of Marquis Sorel, inflated her cheeks as if she was furious, and complained sheepishly. Others listened to her attentively and sympathized with her. Lamia twisted the events of that day as though what she said was the only truth.</p>
<p><em>It’s like watching a play, </em>thought Akshetra.</p>
<p>Looking at them with happy smiles on their faces, Akshetra felt that she was no different. She put down her teacup. “I understand that you are upset. Countess Alshine’s magical abilities have not been proven yet, but since the Magic Association has recognized it, she must be a wizard. If you blindly confront her, you’re not going to see anything good.”</p>
<p>Akshetra’s insinuation was clear. She didn’t want any of them to lay a hand on Countess Alshine. At least, not yet. Lamia was flustered. She lowered her head.</p>
<p>“Of course, Princess,” she said. “It’s just a pity that people don’t know how she really is and are paying attention to her.”</p>
<p>“It’s probably just curiosity toward something new,” said Akshetra.</p>
<p>Lamia smiled. This was immensely boring but having tea parties with Lamia, who was from one of the most influential families in the Heulin social circle was very important to Akshetra. It was only about once a week, and Akshetra had made some good connections. It was all thanks to the eager young ladies who attended her tea party.</p>
