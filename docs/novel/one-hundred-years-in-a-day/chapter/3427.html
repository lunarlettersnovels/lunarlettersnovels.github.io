            <p><strong>Chapter 96</strong></p>
<p>“Dalia…,” He called over and over again. He would give anything for her to say, “Yes, Teacher!” like she always did. He recalled her smile and how lively she always was. Kaichen regretted everything. He should have accepted her as his disciple sooner. He should have placed some protective magic on her bracelets even if he had just created them out of impulse. He could have done something… anything… to prevent this. He should have done something.</p>
<p><em>I knew of my feelings for her. I should have told her. I should have tried harder. If I had known she felt such pain, I could have helped her. I should have tried harder. </em>He regretted not paying attention to her. He had clung to his shallow anger and childhood mistakes. That had been so petty. Kaichen cursed himself for being an idiot.</p>
<p><em>If I had only tried to find her after her parents died, I could have consoled her. She wouldn’t have been so lonely and broken. Momalhaut couldn’t have taken advantage of her then. Dalia wouldn’t have been a medium and wouldn’t have had to suffer like this. If only…. </em>Kaichen sobbed.</p>
<p><em>I want to help her.</em> <em>She went through all this alone. He wasn’t able to tell me her secret and she was suffering all alone. How can I help her? </em>The tears streaming down Kaichen’s cheek wet Dalia’s dress on the knees. He tried to bite his lips to withhold the sobs escaping from his mouth but he couldn’t.</p>
<p><em>Please…, </em>he prayed. <em>Please. If I had known anything at all, I would have tried everything to get you out of this pain. </em>Kaichen couldn’t stop crying. He recalled her apologizing for the seizures she had. She had apologized to him for having to take care of her. He couldn’t forgive himself. He had been so wrapped around his own anger and hatred and then the desire he had for her that he had never questioned what she must have been struggling with.</p>
<p><em>You stupid, stupid woman. Why couldn’t you ask for help? How did you struggle this much pain alone? </em>She had told him that she had sinned. That she had done terrible things when she had been stuck in time magic. <em>Why did you think you did this by your own will? Why do you blame yourself for everything?</em></p>
<p>“Dalia… Dalia… please.” Dalia didn’t move. Kaichen had dissolved the robe binding her. And yet, she didn’t move. Kaichen cried. He wished his hot tears would melt her coldness. He wished he could end all this pain with a swish of his wand. She had always said that she found his mana so dazzling and beautiful. He filled the room with his golden mana. It burst forth from him, pulsating and brightening everything. He wished it would be enough to melt her darkness.</p>
<p><em>“Please accept me as a disciple.”</em></p>
<p><em>I should have found her sooner. I should have helped her.</em></p>
<p><em>“Teacher, are you trying to comfort me?”</em></p>
<p>He recalled her voice and her words haunted him. <em>I really should have comforted you. I should have known how vast your loneliness was.</em></p>
<p><em>“I remember that you called me Dalia. You called me that yesterday, too. I hope you’ll continue to call me that.”</em></p>
<p><em>How lonely it must have been for you!</em> <em>How terrible it must have been! Dalia… I hope I can get you out of that terrible place if you will allow me. Let me help you.</em></p>
<p>Dalia’s black mana seemed to have been thinned slightly by kaichen’s golden mana. He poured out more. He didn’t care how much he had to pour out if it meant she would be okay. He had already used a lot of mana on the barrier and other countless permanent magic he had cast around Acrab. His wand couldn’t handle the rush of power and it shattered. Dalia drooped forward on the chair like a broken doll. He hugged her.</p>
<p>He was happy when she had started gaining a little weight and appearing a bit healthier than before. But he had still felt that was nowhere near enough. She still looked thin and sickly. He remembered how she had cooked for him, taking care to cook dishes that he liked. While she wasn’t able to keep food down and vomited every time she ate. She was the one who needed care and yet, she had cooked for him. <em>What in the world can I do to bring back your smile? Oh, why did you have to return to Acrab if it caused you so much pain? </em>Kaichen wiped his tears.</p>
<p>He held her and stroked her cold cheek. He held her hands and blew onto it try to warm it. She was a bit calm now. Her black mana wasn’t making Kaichen lose his mind although it was still very painful. He realized that he could get back on his feet now. He lifted her up from the chair and carried her out of the building.  She shivered. He took off his outer robe and wrapped her in it. It made his heart ache to see her unconscious and frail. He wanted to teleport to her castle at once but he had used an awful lot of mana and there was still the barrier that he had to maintain. He had to save every bit of mana he had.</p>
<p>When he walked out of the building with Dalia in his arms, he saw Antares struggling on the floor where he had left him. As Dalia’s mana calmed down, he seemed to recover his senses a little.</p>
