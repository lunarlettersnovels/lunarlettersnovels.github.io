            <p><strong>Chapter 216</strong></p>
<p>I couldn’t focus on anything except the way Kaichen was kissing and licking me. My knees were shaking and I was barely holding on, with Kaichen keeping me steady by my waist.</p>
<p>The sound of him thrusting against me was so raw and animalistic. My body was pushed forward with each movement.</p>
<p>“Haa…ugh, Dalia,” he breathed, as I m0aned in response.</p>
<p>I shivered as he ran his hand down my spine. I was fully lost in pleasure, my hair a mess and my skin slick with sweat. Kaichen seemed to want me to let go of all reason, and I was more than happy to oblige.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We kept going until dawn, and I overslept the next day. I woke up groggy, scratching my head and rolling around in bed. We started early, but we kept going until morning light. I had passed out from exhaustion, my body drenched in sweat and our fluids.</p>
<p>I had no idea how much stamina Kaichen had. I thought the archmage was a monster just because of his magical powers, but he also had the physical strength to match. The most monstrous thing about him, however, was the one nestled between his legs.</p>
<p>Should I have stopped him from exercising his stamina every night?</p>
<p>After learning how to wield a sword, it seemed like he was pushing himself to improve his stamina unnecessarily.</p>
<p>I didn’t hate it, but my physical strength wasn’t enough to keep up with Kaichen’s needs. I shouldn’t let Kaichen lose control of himself like that again…</p>
<p>The side of the bed was empty. My sticky body had been cleaned, and the dirty bed sheets and blankets were now spotless.</p>
<p>Kaichen must have tidied up everything while I was asleep. If that’s the case, he should’ve just stayed by my side until I woke up. There must have been something urgent that he had to attend to.</p>
<p>With a twinge of regret, I stretched and went to the window to take in the enchanting beauty of the garden.</p>
<p><em>‘The poison that could cause mental breakdowns and loss of reason forced me to do such a terrible thing…’</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t until a day later that I could think about what Kaichen had told me calmly.</p>
<p>For a fleeting moment, I had the thought of destroying everything and making those people feel the same pain that I felt.</p>
<p>“Princess Exchetra…”</p>
<p>Everything that happened in Acrab was Momalhaut’s fault, but it was Princess Exchetra who orchestrated everything by using him.</p>
<p>It was Antares who poisoned me, but he was already dead. Did he try to make this type of poison from scratch? Could it be that Exchetra ordered for it to be made?</p>
<p><em>‘There’s no way Exchetra would create such a difficult and complex misunderstanding for me when I’m not even an important character in the original story,’</em> I thought to myself.</p>
<p>But, based on my experience in the North, I knew that Exchetra was meticulous, detailed, and deliberate. She viewed everything that happened in Acrab as some sort of “experiment.” If that was the case, then I had unknowingly become a pawn in her game.</p>
<p>I had originally thought that Dalia was just a minor character with little importance, but it seemed she may have been a valuable test subject for Exchetra.</p>
<p>Even if I had bad luck, I never thought it would come to this. If I had possessed someone, I never would have chosen Dalia, someone who had been imprisoned in time magic for a hundred years.</p>
<p>Destiny can be a tricky thing. If I had known what was going to happen, would I have gone insane? Surely, I never would have become a medium of time magic, knowing everything.</p>
<p>‘<em>My goodness, if that’s really the case, what a grand method of committing su!c!de,’</em> I thought to myself.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Exchetra who was behind everything that had happened to me. Regardless of Dalia’s intentions, it was Exchetra who turned Acrab into a huge laboratory for her experiments.</p>
<p>I never wanted Exchetra to have peace.</p>
<p>“Ha… still, I did a good job of confessing it all,” I said to myself.</p>
<p>As expected, Kaichen knew the secret I had hidden for so long. But, even so, he was always warm and caring towards me. He tried to comfort me, saying that it wasn’t my fault. He was a foolishly kind person.</p>
<p>After stretching and washing up, I prepared myself to head out. My heart felt lighter than before.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Las asked as I headed out of the mansion alone.</p>
<p>“I heard that an old friend came over, so I wanted to meet him for a while. You don’t have to follow me,” I replied.</p>
<p>But Las was insistent. “Acrab has a lot of visitors now, unlike before. It’s dangerous to go alone.”</p>
<p>“I’m a wizard, though?” I pointed out.</p>
<p>“No matter what, it’s not dignified for a noble to go alone! Now, everyone will recognize you even if you just pass by,” Las nagged.</p>
<p>It was true that I was now easily recognizable everywhere I went, not just in Acrab but in Heulin as well. My unique physical features, such as my black hair, dark eyes, and fair skin, made me stand out in a crowd.</p>
<p>My dark eyes were said to be so dark that they looked like they were dyed with squid ink, a rarity even in the empire. This was in contrast to Kaichen’s blonde hair and tan skin, which made him stand out as well.</p>
