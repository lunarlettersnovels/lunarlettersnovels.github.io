<p><strong>Chapter 67</strong></p>
<p>Looking at Angel made my heart feel heavy. Had this little kid trembled in fear of death this whole time without anyone to turn to? I pulled him to me into a hug and gently stroked his hair. “No,” I said, “Trust me on this, okay? You are not going to die. I won’t let you.”</p>
<p>I knew that I the current situation was grim and Kaichen and I might not succeed but I wanted to comfort this little kid. I had a duty to this land. I would try anything to save them. Besides, having Kaichen by my side made me feel better. Knowing that he would try to sort this situation out with me gave me courage and hope. I glanced at Kaichen.</p>
<p>Angel had stopped crying by the time Mimi returned to the living room with hot, scalding tea. She poured a cup for Kaichen and me. I hadn’t ever hoped that I would be here in the mansion drinking fine tea ever again.</p>
<p>“Angel told me a little about what is going on here. Tell me about the situation here.” Mimi smiled softly. Her expression then turned somber as she explained everything happening in Acrab.</p>
<p>The situation in Acrab was worse than I had expected. Half the population had already caught the disease and were suffering. Although everybody maintained distance and reduced their time outside of their homes, the number of people catching the disease only increased. I could make out some details though. That this wasn’t really an epidemic that was spreading but there might be someone who was poisoning people.</p>
<p>The more I listened to the explanation, the more similarities I could find in the current situation and the Garten incident in the original novel. It seemed the story had somehow changed. The Garten incident was happening in Acrab now. <em>But why? </em>I couldn’t come up with a possible explanation. The only thing I could think about was that I was a glitch in this world. Dalia was supposed to have died but I am alive in her body. But it was just too big a conclusion to jump into without proper evidence.</p>
<p>This was a disruption of the original story. I had a bad feeling about this. If the plotline was changing on its own, there was no way the ending would be good. Mimi left the living room with Angel, who was still sniffling. Kaichen and I didn’t start talking about the situation immediately. This was too uch to process.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an epidemic. It was worse. People are fearful right now, and the Momalhaut forces are hiding in Acrab spreading this poison. But I felt like I knew the cause and the end for this commotion.</p>
<p>“Teacher, what do you think about the whole thing?”</p>
<p>“It’s certain.”</p>
<p>“I think so, too. I think the symptoms are similar too. As expected, it’s probably Momalhaut’s doing.”</p>
<p>“To be exact, this is the work of a magician named Antares.”</p>
<p>I blinked at the name. The name was familiar to me. I remembered everything I had read. I mulled over the name Antares with a sip of tea for a while. <em>The black magician! </em>I frowned. Then I sighed. It was true. The Garten situation was actually taking place in Acrab because the cause of the Garten incident was a black magician named Antares.</p>
<p>“Is it his poison that made me sick?” Kaichen didn’t have to respond. I was sure of it. “Every poison has an antidote. We can save the citizens of Acrab! But I guess we can’t really do anything to stop the rumors since it has already spread too far.” I frowned. “His Highness told us to hurry. I think the Imperial palace might already have given the order to block Acrab!” I looked at Kaichen.</p>
<p>He looked calm but he didn’t deny what I had said. I was right! He couldn’t tell me because I was the countess, leader of Acrab. I knew that Julius had talked briefly with Kaichen before we left. Maybe he had told him then.</p>
<p><em>So Acrab is already blocked…. </em>Acrab would receive no aid. The people would fight amongst themselves for scraps of food and succumb to the disease. <em>We need to do something! </em>The Imperial palace might send soldiers to slaughter the people of Acrab and burn the city to the ground to stop the spread of disease thinking this was an epidemic. <em>I am not going to let that happen! </em>I leaned back on the sofa and pressed my temples. My eyes throbbed. I needed time to think.</p>
<p>“Dalia,” called Kaichen softly, pulling me out of my thoughts to the present.</p>
<p>“Yes?” I answered without opening my eyes. I felt Kaichen’s gaze on me.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t answer that question. <em>How could I ever be okay with something like this going on? </em>I looked at Kaichen through half-open eyes. He still looked cold and indifferent and maybe a little stubborn. But there was worry in his eyes.</p>
<p><em>Why does he always look so cold and intimidating? </em>If he smiled occasionally, he would definitely be a heartthrob of many. No doubt about it. The thought made me upset.</p>
<p>He is my teacher. If he became the heartthrob of many and women courted him, I would not be able to learn magic properly. Maybe he should just appear cold and indifferent. Maybe he shouldn’t really smile. That was better.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” I said wearily.</p>
<p>“Being back here.”</p>
<p>“Um… There is no reason not to be okay. This is my… home.” I smiled at him and closed my eyes. If I said I wasn’t okay, then I would have to explain why. I just didn’t have the energy to explain everything. I closed my eyes again. I didn’t know if I would be able to tell him the truth even in another hundred years.</p>
