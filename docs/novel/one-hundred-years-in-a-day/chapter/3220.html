            <h3><strong>Chapter 304</strong></h3>
<p>While I was dumbfounded,  Julius continued explaining without even opening his eyes.</p>
<p>“He came as Suran’s Minister of Foreign Affairs by appearance, and when he arrived, he claimed the status of a Grand Duke. Yanghwa… no, if Princess Yanghwa hadn’t told me, I would have believed what they said.”</p>
<p>“He hid his status and made such a request… Does he have a reason for hiding his identity?”</p>
<p>“He’s confident that with the Princess by my side, I would have known his status.”</p>
<p>Otherwise, they couldn’t make such demands so confidently.</p>
<p>Above all, Suran was still across the sea from the Eastern Continent to the outside world. Others didn’t think that Suran and Kalhai were on the same continent, so their request was nothing short of audacious, almost disregarding the Empire.</p>
<p>Only Julius, who knows everything, is in trouble.</p>
<p>“It’s… I have a headache.”</p>
<p>Before he could even grieve, there was another person he needed to deal with. No wonder he had looked so worn and tired.</p>
<p>Jungyeonhae, Yanghwa’s oldest brother, was currently reigning as the Emperor of Suran. Yanghwa admired her brother for his benevolence as Emperor.</p>
<p>I wondered what kind of man he was, but he seemed too formidable to approach just out of curiosity.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, he came after receiving my letter, not his sister’s letter.”</p>
<p>“At least we avoided war.”</p>
<p>“I guess so…”</p>
<p>Looking at Julius, it seemed there was something I didn’t know again.</p>
<p>Honestly, what series of events was unfolding one after another? With one issue already overwhelming to solve, many problems awaited resolution.</p>
<p>“As for the Time Magic, I’ll research it with Master. I don’t know what Princess Exchetra is plotting, but I think there might be a connection, considering she has used Time Magic three times.”</p>
<p>“… Huh… Alright, go ahead.”</p>
<p>As Julius gave his permission, I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Lately, I’ve been doubting if I’m in my right mind.”</p>
<p>In a tired voice, Julius covered his face with both hands. He always smiled brightly and acted cool. This side to him was unfamiliar to him.</p>
<p>Kaichen glanced at Julius without a change in his expression and said, “Do you need to be in your right mind?”</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>“You don’t even look normal anyway, so just live like a madman.”</p>
<p>The tone was dismissive, as if saying why he was agonizing over it.</p>
<p>With an oddly straightforward and strange answer, Julius first made a foolish expression, then burst into laughter after a while. Perhaps at his breaking point, Julius laughed for a long time as if shaking something off.</p>
<p>My heart feels heavy, and it must be complicated for Kaichen, too.</p>
<p>But the one who had the hardest time among us was undoubtedly Julius.</p>
<p>He had responsibilities and a status to uphold. Even though he was grieving the loss of his family and not being able to protect them, he couldn’t rest or mourn at all. He had to face a new situation now.</p>
<p>Now that he knew the cold reality and hidden truth, living as a madman might be the best option for Julius, as Kaichen suggested.</p>
<p>Whether it was a comforting or a serious answer, I didn’t know.</p>
<p>Julius hurriedly left, saying he needed to talk to the Suran Emperor again.</p>
<p>He also didn’t forget to insist on keeping the Time Magic research as discreet as possible. It was inevitable since researching it openly would attract unnecessary attention.</p>
<p>I rested my legs on the sofa, turned my body sideways, and leaned on Kaichen’s arm. I could feel his muscles underneath my back. He hasn’t stopped swinging a sword at night when there was nothing to do.</p>
<p>“Master, the drug that Princess Yanghwa suffered from… Do those Mana Dregs also have the nature of Time Magic?”</p>
<p>While I assisted Kaichen in research, I couldn’t keep up with new learnings, so Kaichen researched alone.</p>
<p>The Mana Dregs from Yanghwa’s body were so powerful that even with advanced healing magic, it would take about a week to recover, which was highly dangerous.</p>
<p>When I heard about it, I couldn’t help but think of a zombie horde she coils control at will. How terrifying.</p>
<p>If Exchetra were a transmigrated person like me, then she knew modern culture. Such a scenario was possible. There was nothing she couldn’t do.</p>
<p>Above all, a magic seal that prevents the use of magic exists. strictly speaking, it was a mana-control sphere. Or, it would be more apt to call it a mana <em>restraint</em>.</p>
<p>Though not present in this world, it was an item that always appeared in other fantasy novels or comics I had read. Considering Exchetra had read enough fantasy novels, she likely had a reasonably extensive knowledge of popular tropes.</p>
<p>She would have used that knowledge to create a plan to eliminate Kaichen, the biggest obstacle.</p>
<p>After contemplating my question, Kaichen pressed my forehead firmly and replied.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case?”</p>
<p>“I think it won’t be easy to recover without healing magic on the level of the master of the Magic Tower. What if innocent citizens are poisoned and turned into a zombie horde?”</p>
