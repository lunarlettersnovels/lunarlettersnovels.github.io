            <p><strong>Chapter 166</strong></p>
<p>Sympathizing with the poor servants, I read the remaining letters as quickly as possible. Then, I got up and went into the office to pen replies. They were all letters of polite refusal because I didn’t feel like sending a lack rose emblem with these invitations. I didn’t know the senders properly enough to meet them personally.</p>
<p>It was not until after all the servants were sent back that we could finally have a quick lunch. I ate a hearty lunch since I had slept in and had skipped breakfast. Mimi, recalling the sick and pale Dalia of the past, watched with great satisfaction as I ate with gusto. It was quite burdensome to have her watch me as I ate but it had been going on for two years, so I was used to it.</p>
<p>After my stomach was delightfully full, I hurried to the drawing room where Countess Vega was already waiting for me. <em>Oh, how I wanted to take a leisurely walk while digesting my food!</em> I opened the door to the drawing room, still longing for a quiet life where no one would visit me.</p>
<p>Countess Vega* was the lord of a neighboring estate between Acrab and the Mencar Mountains. Once a horde of thieves appeared in the Mencar Mountains and an unfortunate incident occurred in Acrab, so the relationship between the two estates had almost been damaged. But thanks to Kaichen’s handling of the mines and the thieves, I was able to patch up the alliance between the two estates and make peace with Countess Vega. In order to maintain a good relationship among estates, it was essential for the two parties to provide assistance in times of need. Fortunately, everything was smoothly resolved.</p>
<p><em>*T/N: the translator has made an error regarding the gender. The only heir to the Vega family should be a female, hence we have changed it to Countess Vega. Apologies to the readers!</em></p>
<p>Countess Vega, like me, had inherited the title of ‘Count’ early after losing her parents. Because of Acrab’s situation and deteriorating economy of her own estate, she had had to turn his back on Acrab. Lars had felt sorry for her. Dalia was in a pitiful state too. But Vega’s estate didn’t have a fixed income, so she had suffered great loss in keeping her place afloat.</p>
<p>Vega’s estate and Acrab had always been on good terms in the past. So, Countess Vega and Dalia signed a contract to discount the total rates for accommodation and restaurant fees used by the merchants moving into the estate instead of charging tolls. With that alone, Acrab saw significant profits. Vega also enjoyed an income as the merchants, who had been discouraged from traveling due to high toll charges and the bandits, were finally able to move through Vega to Acrab which earned the estate a profit.</p>
<p><em>As far as I know, there haven’t been any recent problems regarding the merchants. So why is she here?</em></p>
<p>This was the second time I was meeting Countess Vega, whom I had mostly communicated through letters. The first, of course, was when we exchanged contracts and signed them. At that time, we barely had time for a proper conversation as there was so much to do to fix the problems in our own estates.</p>
<p>It was surprising that Countess Vega had come to visit me in Heulin. Last time we met, we had hastily departed after signing the contract. Countess Vega was a person with brown hair, warm green eyes, and a gentle smile. It was easy to lower one’s guard and feel safe in her presence, but she could actually be very cold-blooded and practical when needed. Her voice, which was firm and striking, was different from her gentle and warm appearance.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Countess Vega. I didn’t know you were coming to Heulin.”</p>
<p>Perhaps she was in deep thought because she was startled by my words even though I had opened the door rather loudly before entering. She jumped up from her seat and bowed hastily to me.</p>
<p>“I should’ve informed you in advance. I’m sorry for visiting on such short notice.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be sorry about. Please sit down. Just moments ago, I was hoping to find a place to sit and rest with a cup of tea. It seems like I can finally have that.” I smiled. I gestured for her to sit back down. Countess Vega looked relieved.</p>
<p>Mimi served tea and cookies, which I had made for Kaichen. The chocolate stuff cookies looked so velvety and moist that I had almost named them ‘Accidentally Moist Chocolate’. I had made it while recalling the sweets I had eaten in my previous life.</p>
<p>I lifted a cup of tea to my lips and exchanged formal greetings with Countess Vega. She looked as though she had something difficult to talk about. She was troubled.</p>
<p>“Our parents were close friends. We can’t guarantee that this will be true for us, but we’re still neighbors. So, if ever you need assistance, just let us know,” I said.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I can’t say I can help with everything. But even if there is a problem I can’t help with, I am still willing to listen. Seeing how we both had to take on the estate after our parents passed away and had our own share of problems, I can definitely listen.” I gave her a patient smile. Countess Vega nervously clasped her hands as if she had made up her mind. Her clasped hands were trembling slightly.</p>
<p>“Countess… I know you are favored by Your Majesty-”</p>
<p>I blinked in surprise. <em>Favored? </em>It sounded absurd to me, so I opened my mouth to say something, but Countess Vega wasn’t finished yet.</p>
<p>“-Considering the selfish requests I made with Acrab in the past,” said Countess Vega hurriedly. “I know that it is shameful of me to request something again… but I have no one to turn to.”</p>
