<p>“Haa…… what the hell are you!”</p>
<p>Dalia giggled. “Master. I’ve never done anything like this before, but I’m glad you like it,” she said, beaming up at him.</p>
<p>It was her first time. And she already did so well.</p>
<p>He would believe such a thing if she weren’t staring at him with innocent eyes and smirking with his cu!m still on her lips. But there’s no reason not to believe it.</p>
<p>“Next time, don’t do it. I don’t want to make it hard for you,” he commanded.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t hard at all,” she said.</p>
<p>Kaichen slid his pants up and helped her to her feet. He reached over and wiped the cu!m from the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>He felt incredibly full to know he would spend the rest of his life with this lovely woman.</p>
<p>The corners of her mouth were red. He almost tore it open, but still, she said it wasn’t hard. He looked at his concealed gro!n. He was acting irrationally.</p>
<p>“I like the look on your face, Master.”</p>
<p>She blushed slightly and averted her gaze. Moments ago, she was nonchalant about her inappropriate behavior. Dalia’s eyes widened as he planted a light kiss on her lips.</p>
<p>“Master, are you kissing me knowing what I just ate with this mouth?”</p>
<p>“It’s mine anyway.”</p>
<p>“…Isn’t that even weirder?”</p>
<p>Kaichen pondered the question. If it were nectar that came from Dalia’s body, he would swallow and suck on it without hesitation.</p>
<p>“And you swallowed it,” he said.</p>
<p>“It was yours, Master. If it were mine, I would have… ugh, no.” she said, scrunching her face. She stuck out her tongue. “We’re going to be late; let’s get cleaned up and get out of here!”</p>
<p>He loved how insistent she was that she rinsed her mouth before he could kiss her.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The Emperor of the Suran Empire, Jungyeonhae, was a man who made you feel awe.</p>
<p>The first thing that came to mind when I saw him step out of the carriage and open the door with Yanghwa was a pine tree. A graceful and beautiful pine tree, standing steadfast.</p>
<p>His bronze-colored hair, which could be mistaken for red in the light, fell to his waist.</p>
<p>He wore wide-legged pants and a round-neck, sleeveless top, not unlike the traditional clothing of the Suran Empire. The gold necklaces and leather jewelry with unique patterns were distinctive, but it was refreshing not to see them overdone.</p>
<p>It was similar to the Middle Eastern Arab look of my previous life but also had a hint of ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>Most importantly, his sleeveless arms were covered in tattoos, which, according to Yanghwa, is an imperial tradition and history that only the heir to the throne can have. This meant the emperor was the only man in Suran with tattoos on both arms.</p>
<p><em>‘I can’t believe he’s wearing it so openly, and no one on this side knows he’s the emperor.’</em></p>
<p>This was only possible because they knew Suran as the eastern continent across the sea, but they knew none of its culture or knowledge.</p>
<p>The fuchsia color of his elongated eyelids, large nose, and firmly angled jaw caused me to admire him for a moment.</p>
<p>Very briefly, of course. Very briefly.</p>
<p>I smiled brightly and led them on, though I felt uncomfortable with the Suran emperor’s steady gaze, never looking elsewhere. Kaichen sighed, unable to fully relieve the heat from the feast, but he didn’t show displeasure as much as the other party.</p>
<p>I decided it was better to eat before I said anything unseemly. Soon, the table was filled with dishes enchanted to stay hot.</p>
<p>“Was this all made by Dalia?!”</p>
<p>“Of course, Princess.”</p>
<p>“This is the best!”</p>
<p>They don’t say you can eat with your eyes for nothing. When Yanghwa, who particularly enjoyed my cooking, clapped her hands and jumped for joy, Jungyeonhae glanced at her and pulled out a chair.</p>
<p>“Yanghwa.”</p>
<p>It was a soft voice, completely different from the self-introduction he had given at the mansion door. He called her by name, clasped his hands, and gestured for Yanghwa to sit down.</p>
<p>And I thought to myself. ‘<em>Ah, this guy… maybe he’s just an easygoing guy who cares a lot about his little sister.’</em></p>
<p>“It’s melting in your mouth… ha…….”</p>
<p>I smiled with satisfaction as I watched Yanghwa spew out one compliment after another with ecstatic eyes.</p>
<p>I put so much effort into this dish that I poured my soul into it. It would be a shame if she didn’t react like that.</p>
<p>Unlike Yanghwa’s boisterous eating, the two men ate so quietly that not even the sound of their chewing could be heard.</p>
<p>If they were alone, Kaichen would have nodded and said something about how delicious it was, but he was more silent than usual. Perhaps it was because he was conscious of Jungyeonhae.</p>
<p>He didn’t say a word except to glance at Yanghwa. She was eagerly eating. Kaichen had perfect manners that could have been written into a textbook, but Fuchsia was no slouch.</p>
<p>Every move he made with the meat was elegant. I don’t know if using the word classy to describe people is appropriate, but that’s exactly what came to mind when I saw Yanghwa’s brother. His regalness was palpable even from his broad shoulders, and his natural grace oozed from him.</p>
<p>The silence was stifling, but I finished the meal, accepting Yanghwa’s enthusiastic praise.</p>
