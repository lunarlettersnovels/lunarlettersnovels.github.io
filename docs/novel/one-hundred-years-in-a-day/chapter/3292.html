<p><strong>Chapter 231</strong></p>
<p>For some reason, his honest answers embarrassed me. “Only you would fall for me.”</p>
<p>“You always underestimate yourself.”</p>
<p>“My self-esteem might go up if you keep calling me pretty.”</p>
<p>As I leaned my head against his shoulder while smiling, Kaichen flinched a little but quickly changed his posture so I’d be comfortable. This man was still surprised by my touch, even though he was okay doing it himself!</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>“I feel like I kept calling you pretty last night.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” I stood up suddenly, clenched my fist while blushing, and glared at Kaichen, but he was smiling, which was unusual for him.</p>
<p>He looked up arrogantly. “Wasn’t it enough?”</p>
<p>My heart fluttered whenever he spoke to me like he was actually became my teacher sometimes. He was crazy sexy. He tilted his head slowly and opened a few buttons at the top of his shirt to reveal his skin.</p>
<p>“If it was, I could tell you more.”</p>
<p>“Are you crazy?!” I was so surprised at Kaichen’s teasing side he never showed before that I took a step back.</p>
<p>As he finally laughed out loud, I hid behind a sofa, stuck my eyes and complained. “Is it fun to tease me?”</p>
<p>“You show such a cute reaction.”</p>
<p>“Ah…. Honestly… Ha…” I bit my lips. I blushed as I was reminded of what happened.</p>
<p>His laughter was so ecstatic that I was hoping it’d even show up in my dream so I had no choice but to keep looking at him. Kaichen covered his mouth and looked at me so lovingly.</p>
<p>“Dalia.” Kaichen called me with the sweetest voice. “Come here.” He said it like an order, but his voice was so pleasant.</p>
<p>I flinched but I got up. My body reacted to Kaichen like it had no honour or pride. I can’t help but run to him when he calls. I feel like I’m losing, but my desire for him was too strong.</p>
<p>That moment, Kaichen got up. I thought something might have happened in the mansion as his face became stern, but then he grabbed my hand and whispered. “Teacher’s here.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hamal the Great Wiseman was a legendary figure in the world of magic, renowned for his vast knowledge and unparalleled mastery of the arcane arts. Even before Kaichen’s time, he had earned the title of ‘the Great Wiseman’, and anyone who spoke of him did so with reverence.</p>
<p>Despite his reputation, I had never met Hamal in person. It had been a long time since I had been with Kaichen, but Hamal had remained holed up in the magic tower, lost in his research. Even when major events like the activation of forbidden time magic or Kaichen’s own transformation had occurred, he had remained aloof and uninterested.</p>
<p>When Kaichen had taken me on as a student, the whole magic tower had been abuzz with excitement, but Hamal himself had remained silent. It was rare for him to take an interest in anything.</p>
<p>Kaichen had held my hand nervously as we waited for his teacher to arrive, but I couldn’t discern what was making him so anxious. Was he not happy to see his old mentor again? Or had he done something to upset him?</p>
<p>As I pondered this, a shower of white light cascaded down upon us, like sand in an hourglass. Slowly, it coalesced into the form of a man. I realized at once that this was Hamal’s doing–pure magic, of a kind I’d never seen before. I’d met many wizards in my time, but none like him.</p>
<p>Each wizard had their own unique power, and most were shades of blue. Julius’s power, for instance, was pure light blue, like the clear sky. But the most common hue was a branch of blue. Dark and clear blue were both rare and beautiful, in their own way. Kaichen’s golden power was said to be exceptionally rare.</p>
<p>Those who didn’t have blue magic often had their own unique spells. Kaichen, for instance, was adept at most forms of magic, but was especially skilled in moving and barrier magic.</p>
<p><em>‘But this is the first time I’ve seen white magic.’ </em>I gazed at Hamal in wonder. His appearance had been unlike anything I’d ever seen before–not like Kaichen’s abrupt, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it entrances.</p>
<p>“Hm,” said Hamal, brushing himself off even though there was nothing on his clothes. His white beard hung down to his bellybutton, and his hair was long and white, tied back in a ponytail. He held a cane made from the wood of an ancient tree–a magic cane, no doubt. “It’s been a while,” he said, “and it feels a bit awkward, to be honest.”</p>
