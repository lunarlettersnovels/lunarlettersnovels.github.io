            <p><strong>Chapter 215 R 18</strong></p>
<p>He looked so er*tic…</p>
<p>Kaichen had lost all reason, far exceeding what I had ever expected. Still, I had no idea that movement magic could be used in a moment like this.</p>
<p><em>‘This is really crazy…’</em></p>
<p>I let out a breath and reached out to hug him, but Kaichen grabbed my hand tightly and pressed it to the bed.</p>
<p>My back arched as the force of his thrusts pressed down on my thighs. Our interlocked bodies quivered with anticipation, as he plunged deeper into my heat.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s intense gaze swept over my body, leaving me feeling exposed and vulnerable.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell who was making the guttural sounds; was it him, or was it me, staring at him with longing eyes and gripping our entwined hands tightly?</p>
<p>It didn’t matter.</p>
<p>Kaichen paused, pulling out before sliding back in, slow and deliberate.</p>
<p>My heart pounded in my chest. The sound of flesh on flesh filled the air, as waves of pleasure coursed through my body.</p>
<p>He thrust in and out with powerful, relentless strokes.</p>
<p>“Ah! Uh, ha! Ah!”</p>
<p>“Dalia… Dalia,” he breathed, his gaze locked on mine.</p>
<p>I couldn’t contain my excitement as he roughly pushed me deeper, his rough exhales sending shivers down my spine.</p>
<p>His golden hair was slick with sweat, and the sight of him biting his lip and clenching his teeth was almost too much to bear. I was on the brink of ecstasy.</p>
<p>As my toes tingled with pleasure that rose deep into my lungs, an indescribable satisfaction filled me.</p>
<p>“Haa, ngh! Kaichen, ahh!”</p>
<p>I climaxed with a trembling voice, writhing in ecstasy as I tightened around his masculinity.</p>
<p>“Dalia, kngh…”</p>
<p>Kaichen let out a groan as I tightened, thrusting deeper into me. With a hot release, Kaichen ejaculated and I felt the lingering aftertaste as he pulsed inside me several more times.</p>
<p>The sound of wetness filled the air as our bodies melded together, becoming one in ecstasy.</p>
<p>Kaichen showered my cheeks with kisses, his lips trailing over my reddened eyes and heavy sweat before biting my earlobe.</p>
<p>“Haa…ha, Master…”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>His kisses didn’t even stop as I called out to him. My body was yearning for more even as he filled me tightly.</p>
<p>And with a smile, I knew I couldn’t stop after just one taste.</p>
<p>Kaichen lifted his head and looked at me, as if sensing my thoughts, and I jokingly remarked, “No, Master…you’re so different in bed. So different from your usual stoic face…I was fooled, fooled.”</p>
<p>With a smirk, Kaichen brought his lips to the nape of my neck, igniting my desire once more.</p>
<p>“You don’t know,” he murmured, trailing kisses along the sensitive junction of my neck and shoulders, leaving a trail of fiery hickeys in his wake. A hint of triumph curled at the edges of his lips as he pulled back to gaze at me.</p>
<p>“Since when did you hold yourself back?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>With a slick, wet sound, he withdrew from me, and a rush of liquid spilled from my body. The sensation was strange, and I felt a dizzying urge to push, as if I were ur*nating. But the flow soon stopped.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s gaze was intense as he lifted my calf, pressing kisses to my thigh and darting out his tongue to lick me. My cheeks burned with embarrassment, even as my body thrummed with pleasure.</p>
<p>His hands roamed restlessly over the insides of my thighs, rubbing gently against my pelvic bone. He looked up at me, his eyes dark and mysterious, before lowering his gaze once more.</p>
<p>A hint of savagery tugged at the corners of his lips, as if he were hiding some sinister intention. “I don’t know,” he murmured, “maybe since the beginning.”</p>
<p>His tongue traced a lazy path up my knee, slowly making its way to the hollow of my ankle. The sight of him looking at me with half-lidded eyes as he licked me made me squirm with desire. His touch was growing more urgent, more impatient.</p>
<p>Every inch of his wet, bronze body was er*tic in the aftermath of our bath, and I couldn’t help but wonder if he felt the same way about me. I didn’t know how to express that I wasn’t willing to let him go easily.</p>
<p>He bit his lip, his virile form still standing at attention, eager to be reunited with my willing body. He leisurely grasped my ankle, relishing in the taste of my skin as he licked and sucked.</p>
<p>“…Master, do you know that you’re too erotic?”</p>
<p>“As much as you?”</p>
<p>His lips curled into a sly smile as he took control, flipping me over onto my stomach.</p>
<p>As I became aware of my new position, I turned my head and pressed my body against him, biting his neck in a frenzy of desire.</p>
<p>“I learnt it all from you.”</p>
<p>I gasped as he filled me, effortlessly sliding into my welcoming body as if we had never parted.</p>
<p>“Hng… ah, ugh…”</p>
<p>“Ha, hu…”</p>
<p>I could feel the taut muscles of his body pressed against mine, the sound of his low breathing and twitching muscles driving me wild.</p>
<p>I turned around, my body writhing in pleasure as he persistently hit that one spot, driving me to the brink of ecstasy.</p>
