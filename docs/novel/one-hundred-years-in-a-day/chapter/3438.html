<p><strong>Chapter 85</strong></p>
<p>“It seems like he’s addicted to a drug similar to yours,” said Kaichen. The drug that had affected me had evoked deep-rooted emotions and hallucinations. It seemed Jamie was suffering the same. He longed and cried for his dead wife. Did he gamble to forget his sadness as well? I hurried out of the house. I couldn’t deal with this right now. I felt exhausted.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop for today,” offered Kaichen.</p>
<p>“What? No!” I said, “We still have three more houses to visit for today.”</p>
<p>“No. We stop here today,” said Kaichen, firmly. ‘You don’t look well.” Kaichen grabbed at my wrist and pulled me to him. It was just a casual thing to do and yet, my heart pounded.</p>
<p>“But, Teacher…”</p>
<p>“Teacher can demand a lot of things from the disciple. This is one such instance,” said Kaichen, looking at me. He looked determined as though there was no place for argument at all. He walked on, holding my hand and pulling me with him. <em>What was up with him?</em></p>
<p>My hands clasped in his felt hot. I wondered if it was normal for the body temperature to be this high. I tried to shake off his hand thinking he must have clasped it and forgotten about it. But he held my hand firmly. I walked as though swept by an unstoppable force. I was curious why he was like this. Had I done something wrong to make him grab my hand and hurry away?</p>
<p>I looked at the hand that was holding mine and looked at him. But his face was turned forwards. I couldn’t make out anything of his expression. <em>I have to let go of his hand. People are watching me. Do I want to be gossiped about even more? I had to have some dignity as a Countess.</em></p>
<p>But another part of my mind whispered. <em>It’s alright. Your image is already ruined. What difference would this make? Why do you even care what they think about you?</em></p>
<p><em>D*mn! </em>I looked around. The people who recognized me looked at me with surprise in their eyes. Kaichen was wearing a robe so it must be difficult for them to see who he was. Great! There will be no misunderstandings at least. Also, I had been dragged around like this (albeit more aggressively) because of my debt before. So, this was nothing new.</p>
<p>But I wanted the people to see the changed me. Granted it would come as a shock for them to see someone transformed overnight. I tried ti calm down and walked faster so that I matched Kaichen’s stride. .</p>
<p>“Teacher, are we going home?”</p>
<p>He didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“Teacher, are you trying to comfort me?”</p>
<p>He still didn’t respond. I figured if he wasn’t saying no vehemently, his silence answered in affirmative. That’s just how he was. He always had his words ready whenever he wanted to reject or refute something but when he acknowledged something, he usually kept his mouth shut. He was strange that way. I felt a lump form in my throat and my chest. I was touched by his kindness. My discomfort melted away. Kaichen, the savior, was still saving me from disgrace. I didn’t understand why he still stuck by Julius though.</p>
<p>“Teacher, I want to ask you something.”</p>
<p>“Don’t.”</p>
<p>“What is your relationship with the Crown Prince? Is he just a dear friend?”</p>
<p>“He is someone who was taught by the same Teacher as me. And we grew up together.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh, so it’s true that he is one of Teacher’s few friends.”</p>
<p>Kaichen slowed down a little. It was now a little easier to walk. I was having a hard time walking so fast. I smiled and swung my hand that held his back and forth. Kaichen’s eyebrows twitched. The tips of his ears were red. <em>Why is he embarrassed now? He was the one who grabbed my hands in the first place! </em> I wondered if he grabbed it under an impulse and was looking for the right moment to let it go.</p>
<p>I smiled at the thought. That would be just like him. He was so adorable! <em>You are out of your mind, Dalia! </em>However, the devil in my heart jumped for joy. This was an opportunity to tease him. I looked straight ahead and hummed as I walked. I then moved my hand so that my fingers interlocked with his.</p>
<p>Kaichen gasped in surprise. I pretended not to hear. I continued humming and swinging our interlocked hands as we walked. I tried to ignore his gaze. I heard a grunt. The veins on his neck were visible. He seemed restless. He stopped walking.</p>
<p>His hand was hotter than it was before. <em>Does he have a fever? </em>I wondered if he was falling sick. Then I saw him glare at me. Uh-oh, maybe I had teased him too much and now he was angry. He unclasped his fingers from between mind and held my hand like before. I guess interlocking our hands made him feel uncomfortable. <em>I didn’t think about that. I shouldn’t have done that. </em>Even if Kaichen is an adult man and a powerful archmage, friend to the crown prince, I realized that he had had no experience holding hands with women.</p>
