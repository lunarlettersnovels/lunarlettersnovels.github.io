            <p><strong>Chapter 244</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to incorporate movement magic once more this time, but Kaichen forcefully pressed me against the wall beside the window and continued his actions.</p>
<p>“Ah! M-mas… Ah, ha!”</p>
<p>“Ha, Dalia… Dalia.”</p>
<p>Biting and licking my shoulder, he thrust into me like a ferocious beast. As I held onto him with excitement, he groaned and put his weight on me, relentlessly moving inside.</p>
<p>There might have been a Tenebre outside who hadn’t left yet, but he still couldn’t control himself… Well, since it was a newly constructed lab, it was soundproofed.</p>
<p>But just having one door open made me feel exhilarated. Even amidst the pleasure, I sensed Kaichen watching me as though I would dissolve away. Intense pleasure flowed through me, almost making me feel like I might melt and perish.</p>
<p>His pulsating length penetrated me deeply, accompanied by our sweet m*ans.</p>
<p>“Ugh… Kngh… ha, haa…”</p>
<p>I released my grip on his shoulder, leaving behind a firm bite mark, and contentedly gazed at him before planting a habitual kiss. He ej@cul@ted, his white fluid trickling out, before he brought his lips to mine. Clutching his sweaty back tightly, we engaged in a tender and affectionate kiss.</p>
<p>With damp strands of hair, Kaichen bit his lower lip, and the scene shifted once more. Kaichen sat us on a bed in the laboratory, while caressing my bottom. His pen!sthat was throbbing after expelling everything, began to harden once again.</p>
<p>I knew it wouldn’t end after just one round.</p>
<p>“Master, aren’t you ashamed to employ movement magic in this manner?”</p>
<p>“Why should I be ashamed?”</p>
<p>“This kind of magic…”</p>
<p>“It’s magic meant to be utilized.”</p>
<p>“…I bet no one employs it during intimate moments, correct?” When I pouted, Kaichen chuckled.</p>
<p>He nibbled and grazed my earlobe, then whispered to me. “I’m simply channeling my abundant mana in a manner that pleases me.”</p>
<p>With a teasing caress, he shifted his hips once again. His fully erect pillar filled my insides once more. I m0aned and hugged him closer.</p>
<p>“Ha… Master, I believe it’s not just your mana that’s overflowing…”</p>
<p>“I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p>
<p>Kaichen laughed and snapped his fingers, disrobing himself completely.</p>
<p>Now it was my turn to release my mana.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>To fully understand magic research through reading, I spent a day watching and learning Kaichen’s research myself, and for the remaining two days, I devoted my energy to researching the purple magic residue with him.</p>
<p>A week passed in an instant like that, and as soon as Hamal’s healing magic finished, Yanghwa finally woke up sane.</p>
<p>I knew that she had already been insane when we met at Sharatan, so I thought that it would be possible to have a proper conversation now.</p>
<p>But for some reason, Yanghwa screamed at people and seldom came out of her futon. When I entered, she even wanted to start a fight and passed out.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I was banned from approaching her until she calmed down.</p>
<p><em>‘Her magic… this seems to be an unusual reaction, so I think it would be best not to step foot in the area for the time being.’</em></p>
<p>After Hamal said that, Kaichen confidently entered Yanghwa’s room.</p>
<p>This d*mn Yanghwa girl rejected everyone in the mansion and allowed only Kaichen in. It was annoying, but fine!</p>
<p>Without realizing that I had started calling her ‘Yanghwa girl’ instead of Ja Yanghwa, I glared at Yanghwa’s door.</p>
<p>Kaichen had been grappling with a vexing situation recently.</p>
<p>He had put his magic research, which he had diligently pursued alongside Dalia, on hold to attend to Ja Yanghwa’s needs daily. He had taken over his master Hamal’s responsibilities, working to alleviate her severe opium addiction and the enigmatic magic coursing through her body.</p>
<p>Restoring her body, extracting traces of opium, and nurturing her back to health provided some solace. It was the closest thing to a peaceful night’s rest he could hope for.</p>
<p>“Why should I be the one to do this?”</p>
<p>“That girl said it would be fine if it were you.”</p>
<p>“…Isn’t this what Master started? Please see it through to the end.”</p>
<p>“I want to, but I fear she may have a violent reaction when I’m face to face with her.”</p>
<p>“Yet, we can’t just leave her to starve, can we?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Kaichen, all you need to do is bring her meals and remove the remnants of opium. Please.”</p>
<p>He had to complete his master’s work. It troubled him, but he agreed to the task because he knew Dalia held a particular concern for Yanghwa’s addiction.</p>
<p>However, another issue surfaced.</p>
<p>“Why… Why can’t I do it?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Why must Master be the one to do this?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“What is Mr. Hamal doing? Why does Yanghwa… Why does she only desire Master?”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t desire him, per se. It’s just that my magical power gives her some sense of reassurance…”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with her – why is she comforted by your power?”</p>
