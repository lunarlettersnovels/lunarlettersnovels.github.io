            <p><strong>Chapter 77</strong></p>
<p>He was annoyed when Julius asked for the bench that Dalia had made for him. He shouldn’t have been but he was. He wasn’t sure how the word ‘mine’ popped into his head. It was so sudden and subconscious.  He didn’t know why he felt so crappy.</p>
<p>“Don’t ever say that again,” said Kaichen, “Don’t ever say that you will turn the sword on her. Not even as a joke.”</p>
<p>Julius looked at him, deciding whether he should smirk or act surprised.</p>
<p>“Even just thinking about it makes me feel sh*tty.”</p>
<p>“Kaichen….”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear it,” he said. “If she has a problem, I will take care of it. You won’t have to get involved. It won’t come to that. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Kaichen knew Julius wasn’t someone to lay low. But Kaichen couldn’t tell him to do as he pleased, like he usually did. Turn a sword at her? Kill Dalia? It made him feel protective, irritated that he felt that way and made his heart pound.</p>
<p>It was difficult to believe that she was the only thing he could think of. <em>Damn it! </em>It will be another sleepless night. Kaichen pressed his temples and closed his eyes with a sigh.</p>
<p>“She is my disciple, no matter what. She is my responsibility.”</p>
<p>“And here I thought she was the only one who was poisoned.”</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and tried to calm his breathing.</p>
<p>“The Imperial knights will be leaving for Acrab soon,” said Julius, “The one who is leading them is Asta. I am sure you know that he is also my sister’s henchman. You should be able to negotiate well. Acrab has a lot of resources and it has mines too. The mines lead to the eastern continent.”</p>
<p>Kaichen nodded. He had noticed and observed Acrab’s topographical advantage. It was at the eastern edge of the Empire that no one paid any attention to. It was far from the capital and craftsmen gathered to this place for exactly that reason. Acrab was also connected to the eastern mountain ranges that the Empire had not reached yet.</p>
<p>The east was assumed to be a different continent, entirely. It was assumed it could only be reached by sailing through the seas. It turned out that there was another way. Considering the tremendous benefit of possible future trade exchanges, it was of enormous importance to Julius, the future Emperor.</p>
<p>“Try to buy me some time,” said Julius, “Hold out as long as you can. If I can find evidence that proves that it is not a contagious disease, I will do everything I can to persuade His Majesty.”</p>
<p>In the end, it was up to him. He knew how difficult it was to convince the emperor. He was almost glad that it was left to Julius to do that. Kaichen nodded and was finally able to cut off the communication. He still felt like Julius was staring at him narrow-eyed. He got up from his seat. Julius sure was good at tormenting people early in the morning.</p>
<p>Kaichen stared at the uncomfortable bed. He was having trouble sleeping which was why he had accepted Julius’ communication request. He glared at his bed. He knew that not everything could be tailored to his taste. He needed to adapt. He sighed. Perhaps he was finding it difficult because he never went to other people’s houses and Dalia had tended to him when he hadn’t even asked for it. Was he becoming used to her presence?</p>
<p>Knowing he couldn’t sleep; he went outside to cool off. He saw Dalia just then, seated at a bench and shouting away swear words at the sky. She was the last person he wanted to see right now but that did nothing to calm his racing heart.</p>
<p><em>“As expected, it’s a love-hate relationship, isn’t it? Your first love suddenly appeared in front of you and your hatred and your resolve was shaken. She won your heart.”</em></p>
<p>Kaichen tried to push Julius out of his mind and watched Dalia. While she let out swear words, the face that looked up at the sky was lonely. He took a step towards her without thinking. <em>Damn it!</em></p>
<p>I hated her. I <em>believed </em>that I hated her. He had thought he hated, loathed and resented her. That there would never be a place in his heart for her. How then is this possible? How is it that his frustration and annoyance disappeared whenever he looked at her? She looked at him and smiled boldly.</p>
<p>He hadn’t ever been able to touch another person but he had reached out for her wrists before he even had time to register what he was doing. He could smell the cool, woody scent of hers. It was in the mansion. It was back in the Willow House. It was everywhere. The scent made him feel like she was everywhere he went.</p>
