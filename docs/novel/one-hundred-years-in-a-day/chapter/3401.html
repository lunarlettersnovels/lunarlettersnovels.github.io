<p><strong>Chapter 122</strong></p>
<p>The bracelet on my wrist chimed. Even with my eyes closed, I knew it was Kaichen and allowed my mana to flow into it.</p>
<p>“Teacher,” I acknowledged. I had a handkerchief over my eyes and forehead and couldn’t see him but I knew that his holographic figure must have appeared in the air.</p>
<p>[Are you sick?]</p>
<p>He must have had another reason for calling. I hesitated. “It’s… motion sickness. I am also surprised. I didn’t even know I had motion sickness.” He had asked me to come with him through teleportation magic. I was embarrassed.</p>
<p>[Where are you?]</p>
<p>Kaichen had consistently asked me the same question for two years. When the commotion in Acrab had subsided, he had imbued the bracelets with all sorts of magical protection. He had put some magical features into it too. Communication was one of them.</p>
<p>Any magician would covet an accessory like this. It was more of a weapon than an accessory. Kaichen had made Acrab his home in these two years but he had been away frequently to take care of Julius’ affairs. He had almost always contacted me through the bracelets.</p>
<p>“Teacher, did you take care of your business? You already there, right?” I knew he had arrived. I was just trying to change the subject.</p>
<p>[I am asking again. Where are you?]</p>
<p>“I’m on the road.”</p>
<p>[Tell me the coordinates.]</p>
<p>“Do you intend to come and get me? If you keep doing things for me, I might become dependent on you!”</p>
<p>Kaichen was always there for me whenever I needed him. He had to help Julius, and he always helped me. I wonder how he did everything! If I had known I would be putting so much burden on him, I would have managed the estate while I was trapped in the time magic. I regretted reading endlessly that time but not applying myself properly. Regrets clouded my mind. It wouldn’t have mattered though. They world would have returned to the same estate no matter what I did to improve it.</p>
<p>My magical ability had increased drastically. The mines were in development. Acrab was recuperating and regrowing. Acrab’s craftsmen had become smarter. They joined the Acrab Craftsmen Association and created their own trademark for stability and security.</p>
<p>I had suggested it in the first place. But I had been worried at the beginning. I didn’t know if the eccentric craftsmen would entertain the idea of signing up. But they had surprisingly obliged. Maybe the economic collapse of Acrab had shown them the dangers of working alone. I had taken up the position as the president of the association and proceeded with the branding.</p>
<p>I had chosen a thorned black rose as the logo, which, I might add, looked rather fetching. I reorganized and changed the emblem of Acrab Merchant Organization, too. It was much easier to manage it under the association. The sales would be made under the brand of Acrab as a whole while crediting individual craftsmen. My plan was successful and the craftsmen worked on their crafts diligently when they didn’t have to worry about sales and collapse of the estate.</p>
<p>[Dalia…]</p>
<p>Kaichen sounded annoyed. It was nice to hear him call out my name. I smiled at the thought that he must be frowning at me. I had been so busy these two years that I had not found any time to spend with him and confess about how I felt about him. The little time we had was spent with him strictly teaching me magic. Other than that, Julius needed him and he would always be gone. Their relationship was only that of a teacher and a disciple at the moment.</p>
<p>“Teacher, will you pick me up if I tell you where I am?” I pouted. If this went on, I would really get very dependent on him.</p>
<p>[How brazen…]</p>
<p>Even though he complained, he always granted my requests. I knew he would always listen to me. It was refreshing and I felt more comfortable with him.</p>
<p>The communication was cut off. I hadn’t told him the coordinates yet. I regretted not telling him. Who knows when he will call back?</p>
<p>“Why are you so stubborn and make everyone exhausted?”</p>
<p>I was so startled by the voice that I jumped up from my chair. The handkerchief that was on my face fluttered down. I frowned at the sudden sunlight now hurting my eyes. My mouth fell open as I saw Kaichen standing in front of me, brighter than the dazzling sunlight.</p>
<p>“Teacher! How did you know where I was? I haven’t even given you the coordinates!” He glanced at the bracelets on my wrists. Perhaps these accessories weren’t only meant for protection. Kaichen did not deny it. I had complained before about something like this, and he had promised to use something like this only for emergencies. I never thought the bracelets could also be used for real-time location tracking.</p></div>
