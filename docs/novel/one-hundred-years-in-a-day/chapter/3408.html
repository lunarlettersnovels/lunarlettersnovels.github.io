<p><strong>Chapter 115</strong></p>
<p>“Ah, yes!” Following his lead as he walked, I thought about how to organize my mind full of confusion.  But, I could only think about it, but it was hard to actually find a way. Kaichen had become a completely different person and it was to the extent that I kept asking myself if he had gone crazy. Kaichen, who had been silent for a while, asked me as if he had suddenly remembered something.</p>
<p>“I heard that in order to revive the territory, the mines that have stopped must be redeveloped. Have you thought of a way?”</p>
<p>“In order to subdue monsters, I have to hire mercenaries, but there is a complicated history with the Mercenary Association, so hiring them directly will be difficult, so I’m still thinking about it.”</p>
<p>“Did you say there are many monsters in the mine?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, so after learning magic from you, I think I’ll do subjugation myself.” I sneakily told him to teach me some attack magic, but Kaichen didn’t say that he would teach me, he just quietly nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Do you know what kind of monsters there are?”</p>
<p>“We’ve had about 100 middle-level mercenaries repel them once a week, so I don’t think there are any powerful monsters. According to the report, it seems the monsters that act as a group are inhabiting it.”</p>
<p>“Then there is a high probability that there will be rock monsters too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve heard that they’re tough-skinned and tricky, but they’re going around alone, so they are worth the fight. The materials they drop after being knocked down are also quite expensive.”</p>
<p>Even in the Mercenary Association, subjugating the monsters in the Acrab Mine would have been a good place to work. Although the association head broke the contract because he was petty, the materials that came out of monsters after defeating them were all expensive magic materials.</p>
<p>It is said that the previous Count Alshine gave the mercenaries all the materials that came out after subjugating the monsters in that way to build trust. Then what? The president of the association is petty!</p>
<p>After all, Acrab is a production city. Killing monsters and things they dropped was used not only as a magic material but also as a production material, so handling it right away was advantageous.  I grumbled about my relationship with the Mercenary Association, the bandits of the Mencar Mountains, and Count Vega.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, everything was messed up because of my parents who eloped. I want to talk to him, but it will take some time. Grandfather… so, I have a feeling that talking with the head of the Mercenary Association will not work.”</p>
<p>He was a man who pushed his granddaughter to the edge of a cliff just because his daughter died. Even if I didn’t see him it was obvious how much of an old-fashioned mind he would have. I was more troubled by the hunch that he was not someone I could deal with only by talking. Besides, as before, I couldn’t even sign a contract through Count Vega, so it was just frustrating.</p>
<p><em>‘As expected, I have no choice but to do it myself.’ </em>I glanced at Kaichen. Judging from his actions now, he seems like he will do anything, so I think he will teach me a few attack magic.</p>
<p>“If you teach me so that I can subdue monsters, I think I will be able to solve it for now…” When I spoke ambiguously, Kaichen said with an expressionless face,</p>
<p>“I’ll teach you magic. But it’s dangerous for you to start subjugating monsters right away, so I’ll take care of it.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Did you say bandits from the Mencar Mountains? His Highness the Crown Prince said that their sudden appearance was suspicious.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“I’ll check.” I couldn’t even respond to his mouth dropping statement, so Kaichen looked at me and said the same words as before,</p>
<p>“Again, what a stupid expression.” His low-pitched voice, contrary to what he said, was extremely sweet. It was so warm, so hot, it was so dazzling that I closed my eyes without realizing it, and it felt like blood was rushing to my head. It is said that when a person changes suddenly like this, they are going to die soon.</p>
<p>“Teacher.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Are you sick?”</p>
<p>“…I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you so nice to me?” Kaichen flinched and stopped walking. And the eyes looking at me seemed to say, <em>‘Yeah, she is this kind of person.’</em> Blinking my eyes wide, waiting for an answer, he answered with a short sigh,</p>
<p>“Because you are my disciple.”</p>
<p>“Are you this nice to anyone if they’re a disciple?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, since you’re the only disciple I have.” Kaichen said and started walking again. As we walked together on the familiar road to the mansion, I asked, ignoring my tickling heart.</p>
<p>“Then will you be this nice to your next disciple?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure”</p>
<p>“Yes? You will be, right?”</p>
<p>“I have no intention of having a new disciple.” After saying that, Kaichen looked at the mansion. We had arrived before we knew it and then turned to me. My body winced by itself.</p>
<p>“Stop talking nonsense and go in and rest.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You are my only disciple, and you will always be. I have no intention of making any disciples other than you.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s bothersome.” After answering lightly, he opened the door that no longer made a squeaking noise and pushed me in.</p>
<p>“What about you, teacher? Aren’t you coming in?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say I would take care of it instead?” <em>You mean you’re doing that right now?</em> I reached out to grab him, but Kaichen slammed the mansion’s gate shut.</p>
<p>“Go in and rest. I’m telling you again, you need to take a complete rest.” I nodded unconsciously at his fierce words. Then Kaichen disappeared, scattering golden magic. His eyes were surprisingly warm.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s because it’s his first time having a disciple?” There is no way to know, but I think I can revive Acrab more easily than I thought.</p>
