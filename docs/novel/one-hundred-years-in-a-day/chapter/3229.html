            <h3><strong>Chapter 295</strong></h3>
<p>He frowned. He hated not sticking to a schedule. Thinking so, he turned his back and went to the room where she was being tortured.</p>
<p>As he strained his eyes, his body stiffened.</p>
<p>Never before had he felt a fear so deep that his body would freeze. The only time he had experienced this was with Princess Exchetra.</p>
<p>Only in front of her Exchetra, who held all of him in her grasp, did his feelings and weakness slip, bringing him down to his knees.</p>
<p>His impassiveness and reluctance to display his emotions was why he stood by Exchetra. But his trembling fingertips betrayed his immense fear.</p>
<p>At the end of the long corridor, where nothing could be seen, was a haunting presence that scared him.</p>
<p>His hair stood on end, and a shiver ran down his spine. The cold sweat on his back was a primal warning to escape danger.</p>
<p>Thud, thud… The sound of footsteps, like someone was stepping on a puddle of water, made Asta unconsciously bite his cheek and move his body.</p>
<p>As soon as he retreated, a black spear was thrust down to where he had been standing a moment ago.</p>
<p>“I hear her favored servant has a keen sense.”</p>
<p>Her tone was casual. Her voice was hoarse and unpleasant to the ears, but her words were bright and lively.</p>
<p>Asta’s body trembled.</p>
<p>Each time she took a step, the surroundings seemed to darken further. Perhaps it must be because of the black rose petals surrounding her frame as if protecting its master.</p>
<p>Asta swiftly drew the sword hanging from his waist. He was a magic knight who used magic and swordsmanship, but he wasn’t as outstanding as Julius.</p>
<p>Still, he couldn’t just sit idly without using his abilities.</p>
<p>He didn’t let his guard down, thinking of the pitch-black spear that had appeared out of thin air and pierced the ground a moment ago.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Huh? You don’t know when you see it?”</p>
<p>Dalia tilted her head slightly.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to kill you all,” she said. Calm and composed, her words were cruel beyond measure.</p>
<p>“Why do you look at me like that? What I endured was worse than this,” she continued.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you know and still followed?”</p>
<p>“How was I supposed to know? Did you warn me that I would be tortured if I followed?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Do you know how much it hurt? If it weren’t for me, I would have died for sure.”</p>
<p>“But you didn’t die, did you?”</p>
<p>Dalia opened her eyes wide for a moment and then burst into laughter, clutching her stomach.</p>
<p>Asta didn’t understand why she was laughing. No, he couldn’t even understand how she was standing there unscathed.</p>
<p>The only thing he knew was that he had to get out of this place as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Or else he would die.</p>
<p>At that instinctive threat, Asta felt the hand holding his sword begin to sweat.</p>
<p>“Can I do anything I want as long as I don’t die?”</p>
<p>Asta remained silent.</p>
<p>“At first, I didn’t know why you didn’t kill me right away and instead made me suffer. But now I think I understand. You called it entertainment, right? <em>She</em> just wanted to play with me,” she continued.</p>
<p>Her voice echoed in the dark corridor. “Surely she thought that way. Because she’s so skilled, even if she were to play with me a little, I’m no threat at all.”</p>
<p>As he looked into the piercing eyes that narrowed, Asta bit his lip.</p>
<p>Could a speckle under folded eyes look this terrifying?</p>
<p>Why did the pale skin look so chillingly pale?</p>
<p>When he realized that the pitch-black pupils were even darker than the surrounding darkness and didn’t hold any delight at all, Asta felt the excruciating pain tearing apart his right thigh.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>He staggered to straighten his body. As he looked at the torn thigh pierced by the pitch-black spear that had suddenly appeared from thin air, he clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>Dalia didn’t hold back. She was just contemplating how to kill him.</p>
<p>Looking at the magic spear she created without prior action, Asta realized she could kill him as easily as breathing. It was almost absurd how she stayed quiet and hadn’t rebelled once earlier.</p>
<p>The sword he held in his hand felt like a toy. It would probably feel that way to her.</p>
<p>“I won’t kill you, just as that woman didn’t kill me.”</p>
<p>Dalia endured the throbbing pain. She slowly approached with her wet boots. Her stumbling steps were abnormal, but she didn’t seem to feel any pain as she slowly came closer to Asta.</p>
<p>“Pass on my gratitude.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Thanks to you, I was able to regain my senses.”</p>
<p>As Dalia passed by without looking back, she muttered lightly, <em>‘Oh, this annoys me a bit, so I’ll seek revenge.’</em></p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>Asta finally screamed as the thin spears, like thorns, pierced his arm, which was holding the sword.</p>
<p>Collapsed and biting his lips, Asta took out a scroll from his bosom. At the same time, the magic-created black spears stuck in his arms and legs disappeared.</p>
<p><em>‘How… in the world…?’</em></p>
<p>This was the first time he had heard of Dalia Alshine having such a terrifying ability. Even if she had become the disciple of the Great Mage Kaichen, she couldn’t become so powerful in such a short time.</p>
<p>He had been caught and tortured as if he were a small rodent. Despite being a disciple of the Archmage, he had thought of her as an ordinary woman.</p>
<p>So when Princess Exchetra paid attention to Dalia, he found it strange for the first time. He had heard that, like Princess Exchetra, she could see the future. But overtime, he didn’t see that ability in her.</p>
<p>Exchetra had said with a smile: “She doesn’t know anything. She didn’t read it… There’s no way she can know the future.”</p>
<p>So, she was excluded from the list of threats. Exchetra also saw her existence as no more than an amusement, so it was only natural.</p>
<p>However, the Dalia Alshine he had just witnessed was definitely not ordinary. With this level of ability, she should be on par with Prince Julius and Archmage Kaichen.</p>
