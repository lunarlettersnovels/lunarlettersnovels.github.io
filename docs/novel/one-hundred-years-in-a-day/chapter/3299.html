            <p><strong>Chapter 224</strong></p>
<p>She had no idea about her location or the passage of time in this place. The mansion had all the necessary provisions, but there were no windows or doors for an escape.</p>
<p>Desperately searching for a way out, she cried out, but her pleas remained unanswered. She was trapped, and there seemed to be no exit.</p>
<p>Yanghwa was puzzled about how the food supply was replenished, considering there was no entrance or exit. Nonetheless, the only food available was fruit, which made her feel like she was back in her childhood days when her family owned cattle.</p>
<p>Days went by without any distinction between day or night, and Yanghwa’s mental state deteriorated steadily. Occasionally, she found candy instead of fruit, which was peculiar but a pleasant surprise. Despite the strangeness, she had to keep it in her mouth to feel human and not like an animal.</p>
<p>Yanghwa remembered her childhood days when her older brothers would call her to wash her hands after playing in the dirt. Eating the candy reminded her of her beloved siblings and deceased parents, and she hoped to see them again.</p>
<p>Her craving for candy increased, and she knew that it was the only way to avoid feeling like livestock. She longed to go back home, see her brothers and sisters, and reunite with her parents.</p>
<p>Yanghwa’s mind was consumed by the thought of candy. She repeated the word over and over again until it lost its meaning. She scratched at the walls with her fingernails, desperate for something to distract her from the incessant craving.</p>
<p>But the more she scratched, the more she felt like she was losing her mind. Her body trembled uncontrollably, and she collapsed to the ground, foaming at the mouth. It was a terrifying sight, one that reminded her of the livestock in her childhood barn.</p>
<p>She knew something was wrong, but she couldn’t stop thinking about the candy. It flickered in front of her eyes, a tantalizing temptation that she couldn’t resist.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a man appeared before her. He was breathtakingly beautiful, with an air of danger that made her heart race. He took her out of the livestock cage and let her feel the cool breeze, giving her clean water to drink and allowing her to dip her feet in a babbling stream.</p>
<p>As Yanghwa regained her strength, the man told her that two years had passed since the day she had been imprisoned. He revealed that the person responsible for her captivity was the head of Momalhaut, and he offered to help her take revenge.</p>
<p>Yanghwa listened intently as the man spoke, feeling a glimmer of hope in her heart. For the first time in years, she allowed herself to dream of a future where she was free.</p>
<p>But as the man watched her search for candy, he warned her that it was bad for her body and that she needed to cut it out of her life slowly. Despite his warning, he held out a pouch full of the addictive substance.</p>
<p>Yanghwa nodded her head obediently, but inside, she knew that she was addicted. She could feel the eerie magic coursing through her body, making her stomach churn and her head throb.</p>
<p>After two years of captivity, Yanghwa wasn’t sure if she could trust her own senses anymore</p>
<p>More than that, Yanghwa firmly believed that the benefactor who saved her from the terrible place couldn’t be a bad person.</p>
<p>‘Do you know who she is?’ Yanghwa asked, her curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>‘Her name is Dalia Alshine. Around the same time you were kidnapped two years ago, a forbidden magic called time magic manifested in Acrab. They seemed to consider you a good test subject.’</p>
<p>‘Ah…’ Yanghwa muttered, surprised and disturbed by the information.</p>
<p>‘Even though she touched something taboo, she lied to the people saying that she was harmed by Momalhaut. It seems that the imperial family is using Momalhaut to solidify their unity.’</p>
<p>‘How could they do that… Do they not value the people?’</p>
<p>‘It’s because they need the support of the people. They create the villains themselves so that they can be manipulated easily. After some investigation, we found out that Count Alshine belongs to Momalhaut. She is under the protection of the Crown Prince. Maybe she could have been involved with the Crown Prince.’</p>
<p>‘I can’t believe it. He… He seemed like a man who cared for the people…’ Yanghwa trailed off, feeling disillusioned.</p>
<p>‘You won’t really know a person just by their rumors,’ the benefactor reminded her.</p>
<p>‘What… should I do?’ Yanghwa asked, feeling lost.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, Yanghwa decided to listen to the benefactor and headed for Sharatan. She posed as a stranger from the Eastern Continent who wanted to settle down in the Kalhai Empire with her funds. She introduced herself as someone with scars after being captured by a wicked nobleman, which helped her cover up her true identity.</p>
<p>Despite her disguise, she struggled with her addiction to candy, feeling like she would die if she didn’t eat it every night. During her stay in Sharatan, she became close to Azel, a kind and gentle person who sensed her weakness and helped take care of her.</p>
<p>Yanghwa felt a warm feeling from Azel, unlike anyone she had met before. While she could only sense the slightest bit of emotion from people who had more magic than normal people, like Rosa, Azel was different.</p>
