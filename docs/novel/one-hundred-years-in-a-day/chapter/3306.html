            <p><strong>Chapter 217</strong></p>
<p>I had no choice but to go out with Las and two more knights. “The accessories crafted by the artisans of Acrab are selling well lately,” Las said as we walked. “There’s quite an increase in the number of people who come here because they want to get them early.”</p>
<p>“Oh… it’s amazing that we get to go to a corner like this,” I said, taking in the sights and sounds of the bustling city.</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to the Count’s fame in Heulin,” Las said, a note of excitement in his voice.</p>
<p>I shrugged, watching the bustling street. “Even if I stay still, Acrab will continue to grow.”</p>
<p>It was a place where individualistic oddballs gathered. Those who couldn’t keep up would naturally fall behind. And with the competitive spirit and drive of its inhabitants, it was no surprise that the city was thriving.</p>
<p>If the road to the Suran Empire is ever opened up, Acrab will become even bigger. I couldn’t help but wonder if I should expand my own territory, but the thought of greed didn’t sit well with me.</p>
<p>Just then, I heard a familiar and nervous voice coming from a nearby carpentry shop. “I told you time and time again to hammer closer to that area!”</p>
<p>“So—sorry.”</p>
<p>I smiled and ran towards the shop, where I found my old friend Hanmer being scolded by the shop owner.</p>
<p>“Your wish came true, Hanmer!” I exclaimed, and the surprised look on his face made me laugh.</p>
<p>“Oh… oh? Are you Dalia?!”</p>
<p>“How dare you speak to the lord that way, you punk!” Haram slapped him on the back of his head fiercely. Oh, that’s got to hurt.</p>
<p>Hanmer rubbed the back of his head, his eyes bulging in surprise, much like Azel’s the day before. As he took in the sight of Las and the knights following me, he quickly dropped his hammer.</p>
<p>“Forgive my rudeness, my lord!” he begged, bowing deeply.</p>
<p>I laughed, waving him off. “No harm done, Hanmer. And you too, Haram. No need to be so hard on him.”</p>
<p>Haram looked confused, his eyes flitting between me and Hanmer. “How do you know each other, Count? This boy just arrived in Acrab not long ago…”</p>
<p>“We met in Sharatan. I was being treated by a master healer,” I explained, glancing at Las. His expression had grown dark as he listened to our exchange.</p>
<p>It seemed that every time I mentioned my poisoning to the people of Acrab, they reacted in much the same way.</p>
<p>“Hanmer was always singing Haram’s praises,” I continued, smiling. “He said he wanted to come to Acrab and learn from her.”</p>
<p>Haram’s expression turned sour. “Respect? He would complain to me all the time about his disappointment, saying that her skills were inferior to those of a female carpenter he had met…”</p>
<p>“Ah,” I said, understanding.</p>
<p>“I’m teaching him like this because he keeps complaining that he wants to meet her again and learn from her. I’ve never heard of a better carpenter than me in my entire life, and this was a young woman,” Haram grumbled, clearly hurt by the comparison.</p>
<p>Hanmer’s face grew darker and darker as his mentor spoke, but I couldn’t help but chuckle at the absurdity of the situation.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but smile at Hanmer as he flinched under my gaze. He turned to Haram, pleading with her.</p>
<p>“The girl I was talking about…she’s the lord.”</p>
<p>Haram’s eyes widened in shock. “What?”</p>
<p>“The lord often visited my carpentry shop. I was making something special for her. You even gave me some advice,” Hanmer explained, his voice cracking with emotion.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but laugh, scratching my cheek. “Ahaha! Come to think of it, I was supposed to meet Azel, but I must have forgotten.”</p>
<p>Haram’s face turned red. I quickly made my exit, not wanting to get caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>“Azel said she would pass on the remaining work to the person who took over the fruit shop in Sharatan and she went there for a while. If you want to meet her, you’ll have to go to Sharatan,” Hanmer called out from behind me.</p>
<p>It was all a lie, but it served its purpose.</p>
<p>“Looks like the movement magic circle connecting Sharatan and Acrab is complete,” I mused aloud.</p>
<p>“Yes, they must’ve arrived after the magic circle was complete,” my companion replied.</p>
<p>“I’ve wanted to make a deal with Sharatan since the beginning, so this is good,” I said, thinking about the potential for trade. There were so many fresh fruits and other goods in Sharatan that Acrab lacked, and I had long wanted to do business with them. But the distance had always been a hindrance. With the new magic circle, however, that obstacle was now gone. I couldn’t wait to see the fruits of my labor.</p>
<p>I couldn’t shake the feeling of excitement as I headed towards the movement magic circle. I had no specific reason for visiting Sharatan, but the thought of surprising Kaichen with fresh green apples from the neighboring town made my heart race.</p>
<p>Las, my companion, shook his head in disapproval. “You shouldn’t just go around making impulsive decisions like this,” he scolded.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t help the smirk that spread across my face. “It’ll be a quick trip, in and out,” I reassured him.</p>
<p>As we stepped into the magic circle, I felt a rush of energy surround me. The guards at the circle greeted us with nods before activating the spell. In an instant, we were transported to Sharatan.</p>
<p>The sights and sounds of the bustling town filled my senses. The smell of fresh fruit wafted in the air, making my mouth water. I couldn’t wait to get my hands on those green apples for Kaichen’s toast.</p>
