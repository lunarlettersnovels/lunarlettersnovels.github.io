            <h3><strong>Chapter 345</strong></h3>
<p>In the end, I headed to the square at the intersection leading to Countess Alshine’s mansion, which was located in Heulin.</p>
<p>I couldn’t find the bustling scene of people that was always there.</p>
<p>Since it was always daytime, I didn’t know how much time had passed. I must have spent several days running around Heulin from corner to corner.</p>
<p>I didn’t feel hungry, and I couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p>I couldn’t precisely determine what it was, but it was clear that this space drove people insane.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>I collapsed on the ground. The sky was still clear, but the bright sunlight reminded me of unpleasant memories. Why on earth was it such clear weather?</p>
<p>“No, no.”</p>
<p>I shook my head, trying to deny it. I didn’t want to articulate the terrible reason that came to mind.</p>
<p>“He’ll come to rescue me.”</p>
<p>Kaichen won’t let me go.</p>
<p>“My savior has outstanding abilities.”</p>
<p>I laughed, imagining Kaichen’s face.</p>
<p>His face, which was smiling, suddenly twisted as he reached out to me with a desperate expression, calling out my name…</p>
<p>‘Dalia—-!’</p>
<p>My smiling face froze stiffly.</p>
<p>Why do I remember his agonizing expression more instead of his smiling face?</p>
<p>I don’t want to think about it right now. I closed my eyes again.</p>
<p>Should I just sleep a little? Will Kaichen come to rescue me if I sleep and wake up? Can I sleep well?</p>
<p>How long should I wait?</p>
<p>How much time has passed?</p>
<p>How much longer do I have to wait?</p>
<p>I opened my eyes. The clear sky made it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>I comforted myself that this was fine, but the sticky black mass under my feet slowly consumed me like a swamp.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>With a short gasp, my eyes began to hurt as if they were going to fall out. I crouched down and gasped for breath.</p>
<p>An animalistic sob escapes my lips. It wasn’t a cry but a groan of pain.</p>
<p>I wanted to think positively, but my brain, accustomed to the worst, quickly filled my mind with negative thoughts.</p>
<p>“Damn it! Please save me! Please save me! Please save me!”</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why me again?</p>
<p>I heard an unpleasant ringing in my ears, and my head vibrated like it would explode.</p>
<p>“Get me out of here!”</p>
<p>My voice was a clear cry. Something I’d said before, so many times. It rang so loudly that I wondered if the vibrations would blow my body apart.</p>
<p>I have to hold on. I have to wait for Kaichen to come to my rescue.</p>
<p>But it hurt more than I thought it would.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…</p>
<p>The medium trapped in time magic wasn’t affected. The enchantment, triggered by the medium’s wishes, merely placed a certain radius under its influence.</p>
<p>Exchetra wanted to drastically shrink the sphere of influence of time magic so that it would only apply to me.</p>
<p>To do so, she chose Heulin as the setting and used instead of the wishes of the medium, the driving force of the time magic this time was the caster, her.</p>
<p>A genius was a genius. No matter how long she had studied and experimented with forbidden magic, she had never succeeded so perfectly.</p>
<p>Exchetra knew that I, who had survived as a medium of time magic in the North, could enter it even if I couldn’t use my magic.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s when Exchetra drastically modified her plan.</p>
<p>The original target of the time magic would have been Kaichen, who was the only one capable of breaking it, but after I broke it in the north, she must have changed her plans.</p>
<p>Maybe she created the Forbidden Magic Circle because she was worried that mages would combine their powers to break through it. Or maybe she’s just this to hide her abilities?</p>
<p>‘Ugh… insane, but insanely smart.’</p>
<p>I was no Exchetra and could never follow her thoughts.</p>
<p>Exetra always had a meticulous plan, but the country’s presence in the middle was a variable. This added a lot of extra work, but in the end, Exchetra accomplished her goal.</p>
<p>I don’t know how much time has passed or how much longer I’ll be trapped.</p>
<p>I had to breathe, breathe. I have to keep thinking. Anything goes.</p>
<p>Run, stupid run.</p>
<p>I have to hold on.</p>
<p>What about the passage of time here? Is it like in Acrab, where you spend a hundred years, and it’s only one day outside?</p>
<p>I walk out of here, and it could be a hundred years outside.</p>
<p>Oh, that’s the worst.</p>
<p>I don’t even expect time to flow the same outside and inside the magic. The mad Exchetra wouldn’t be so generous.</p>
<p>As I thought frantically, my body’s trembling stopped, though only slightly. I stood up, drenched in a cold sweat. I tried to think as hopefully as possible, but I could barely breathe.</p>
<p>She couldn’t be crazy again.</p>
<p>“You say that as if you’re not crazy.”</p>
<p>I don’t even know if I’m sane anymore, to be honest.</p>
<p>I let out a grunt of pain and pushed myself up. I can’t stay still.</p>
