            <h3><strong>Chapter 334</strong></h3>
<p>Kaichen’s warm, almost hot embrace quickly calmed my nerves.</p>
<p>Unlike me, who rambled on and on, Kaichen understood my mood and thoughts with just a few words. He knew me better than anyone.</p>
<p>Just as I was afraid of losing him, he was afraid of losing me.</p>
<p>“Let’s have two cats.”</p>
<p>All the while, Kaichen mumbled something about the future that I couldn’t forget with a smile.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help it. This was the only man who could make me angry, cry, and eventually laugh.</p>
<p>It was an absurd reality. I wasn’t a good person, more like an evil entity, but Kaichen still whispered to me that he liked and loved me.</p>
<p>So what if I was selfish? So what if I was sinful?</p>
<p>I was the sum of all those things, and he said he loved me for that.</p>
<p>No regrets, no reluctance. He instilled courage in a coward like me.</p>
<p>‘Master, aren’t you afraid of me? I have strange black magic; I kill people without thinking. I have many sins, and I’m just…’</p>
<p>‘Do you think I’m scared of you?’</p>
<p>‘Well, not really, but… I thought you might be a little shaken up because it’s not like it wasn’t true to begin with…’</p>
<p>‘You call yourself a genius all the time, but at times like this, you’re just an idiot.’</p>
<p>‘What?!’</p>
<p>‘If you want to kill a bunch of people and get away with it, I’ll help you get away faster than anyone else. If you want to destroy the Empire, I’ll try to talk you out of it, but I’ll probably help you.’</p>
<p>‘…?’</p>
<p>‘But don’t learn black magic. I don’t want your pleasant scent to disappear.’</p>
<p>‘Master, is it okay to be an archmage?’</p>
<p>‘If the woman I love wishes it… I have no heart to refuse. I can only help her as she wishes.’</p>
<p>‘Awww! My heart…!’</p>
<p>‘Would you abandon me if I said that?’</p>
<p>‘Are you insane? If Master wants to conquer the continent, I’ll be at the forefront of it and wipe it out.’</p>
<p>‘Remember that. I love you, not just parts of you.’</p>
<p>My palate was sweet. It was sweet like he’d poured a whole barrel of honey into my mouth.</p>
<p>When I thought about all the times Kaichen soothed me, I felt like I would cry, but this time, I hugged his waist tightly.</p>
<p>A low laugh was heard above my head. His bright smile, which I wanted to keep forever, came to mind, and the corners of his mouth naturally went up as I buried my face into his chest. Kaichen gently stroked my hair, not caring that it became disheveled.</p>
<p>Ah, crazy. I’m so happy.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The Imperial Palace altar was astonishingly opulent and magnificent.</p>
<p>I was struck by the staircase that rose so high it seemed to touch the sky. It reminded me of an Egyptian pyramid, albeit without the pointed peak. From the top of the golden altar, people on the ground looked like ants.</p>
<p>Where had I seen something like this before?</p>
<p>‘Mayan civilization? Maybe I’ve seen it in one of those documentaries.’</p>
<p>It resembled something I’d glimpsed in movies about ancient civilizations—so grand, colorful, and imposing that it could have been a setting for a mythical dragon’s descent.</p>
<p>The surrounding area was densely packed with people except for the path leading to the stairs. The space around the altar, where all the empire’s nobles congregated, was solemn.</p>
<p>Unlike the usual boisterous atmosphere of a typical ball or party, this ritual was sacred, and even the usually arrogant demeanor was subdued.</p>
<p>When I asked about the breathtaking altar and how something so immense remained hidden, Julius shrugged and nodded toward Kaichen.</p>
<p>One of Kaichen’s duties was putting up a barrier concealing the altar.</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes at Julius.</p>
<p>“Just how much are you exploiting Master?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Barrier missions are Kaichen’s primary responsibility for the Empire.”</p>
<p>“I beg to differ. Given how you rush to Master’s aid whenever something arises, I suspect the barrier missions are just a cover for numerous additional tasks.”</p>
<p>“… Countess, I hate to contradict you, but Kaichen’s contributions don’t match his abilities.”</p>
<p>“No, I refuse to accept that. He’s overworked, and I expect you to respect his working hours.”</p>
<p>Julius gave my shoulder a firm squeeze in response to my stern words. “The Countess sometimes forgets,” he remarked.</p>
<p>“Forgets what?”</p>
<p>“That I am the Crown Prince.”</p>
<p>“Of course not, Your Highness. How could I forget?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the tone. You must watch how you address a prince.”</p>
<p>“Understood, Your Highness… Where I come from, this kind of pressure is called bullying.”</p>
<p>Julius’s serious expression faltered at the unfamiliar term, and he scratched his head.</p>
<p>“Bullying…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it exists.”</p>
<p>“I’m not familiar with the term, but… it doesn’t sound favorable, and I hope it’s not some profanity I don’t understand?”</p>
<p>“How could I say such a thing to His Highness?”</p>
<p>“You’re starting to sound more like Kaichen, and that’s not necessarily a good thing.”</p>
<p>“They say love makes you resemble each other.”</p>
