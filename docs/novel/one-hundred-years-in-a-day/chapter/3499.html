            <p><strong>Chapter 25</strong></p>
<p><em>I need money. Will he give me some money if I ask? </em>The dish I made which held my future by a thread was… a simple toast. French toast topped with fine sugar, bought from Acrab, which was also one of Kaichen’s favorite. Of course, I didn’t ask him! I knew it from the original novel because Julius kept teasing him about it.</p>
<p>I put it on the table and returned to my room. I headed to the bathroom which was attached to the room. After taking a shower, I changed into my pajamas and laid down on the bed. <em>I am so tired. </em>My hands were still shaking, and I felt nauseous. I had tried vomiting in the bathroom, but there was nothing left to throw up. I felt so weary but was afraid to sleep because of the nightmares.</p>
<p><em>But this isn’t Acrab… m</em>aybe <em>I won’t have those nightmares</em> here…. I closed my eyes and drifted slowly to sleep.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The woman walked through the halls of the magnificent imperial palace. She was elegantly dressed in fine jewelries worn beautifully without being excessive. She looked divine with straight, blue hair that reached down to her waist. She had cold, blue eyes. The woman, tall and lean, stopped.</p>
<p>“Sister, did you sleep alright?”</p>
<p>“It’s impossible to not be at peace in the quiet imperial palace. You look chirpy. Any good news from last night?” Her voice was soft and kind.</p>
<p>“It’s not even that good of a news. But I am relieved that the forbidden magic of Acrab has been broken.”</p>
<p>“His Majesty’s illness is getting worse these days… forbidden magic. Was it Momalhout’s doing?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. But I think so. I think it is the work of Momalhout that is disturbing the empire.” The woman who had been waving her fan, folded it and smiled. “I wonder why it was Acrab. Do you have any idea why the magic was used against Acrab?”</p>
<p>“You’re asking me as if I know something.”</p>
<p>“No way. My sister is the wisest person in the whole empire, so I just assumed you would know about Momalhout’s wicked plans.”</p>
<p>“That’s an overstatement! There are things I don’t know…… I am always embarrassed to be complimented by you. A mighty magic knight.”</p>
<p>“I was just telling the truth,” said Julius. He shrugged his shoulders and directed a bright smile at her. The woman looked at him with cold blue eyes. The woman knew his smile was fake.</p>
<p>“I have work to do, so I’m in a hurry. I will meet you later.”</p>
<p>“Have a good day, sister.”</p>
<p>“You too, Julius.”</p>
<p>The woman who passed Julius, walked as gracefully as before, undisturbed. Her steps, neither slow nor fast, were light and graceful. When she arrived at the study, the guards greeted her, she passed them and turned her back on the stack of documents. Standing by a widely open window, the woman clenched the fan she was holding in her hand.</p>
<p>“Asta.” A masked man appeared like a shadow to the quiet call.</p>
<p>“Master. May the blue dragon’s protection continue-”</p>
<p>“Enough. Didn’t I tell you not to greet me like that?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t presume to disrespect the princess by not greeting formally when called.”</p>
<p>“I told you not to. Just tell me about Acrab. Seeing Julius soured my mood.”</p>
<p>She pulled a chair and sat down, pressing her forehead as if she could feel a headache forming. She seemed to relax. She seemed more comfortable with the masked man.</p>
<p>“As we expected, Kaichen Tenebre broke Acrab’s magic. It took quite a while, so it was hard to even for the Archmage.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… It really took more time than expected. What next?”</p>
<p>“It was as the Master predicted. The day after the spell was broken, Kaichen Tenebre left Acrab with Countess Alshine.”</p>
<p>The hand that had been knocking on the desk stopped abruptly. “I’m sure they went to the magic tower.”</p>
<p>“They did not go to the magic tower.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details, but the direction they went was not towards the magic tower. It was after they came out of Acrab, so I couldn’t find out anymore because I thought I’d get caught by him if I approached more closely.”</p>
<p>“Which direction?”</p>
<p>“They headed to the south.”</p>
<p>With a short sigh, the woman pressed her temples again. She frowned. “If it is the south, they might be headed to Kaichen Tenebre’s house.”</p>
<p>“Shall I follow them?”</p>
<p>“No, you’ll definitely be caught. Let them be.” Stroking the fan decorated with peacock feathers, the woman lowered her eyes. “Even if he is an Archmage, he won’t be able to figure out anything about Acrab’s forbidden magic, so we don’t have to worry.”</p>
<p>“Did you take care of the mage?” asked the woman.</p>
<p>“Yes, I took care of him right after he cast the magic.”</p>
<p>“Do not leave anyone involved alive. You must have brought the magic spell he used, right?”</p>
<p>At the request of the woman, the masked Asta handed her a roll of parchment. The woman slowly put down the fan and opened the scroll. A cold smile formed on her face.</p>
<p>“This is why magic is bound to be solid. He was a pretty talented mage, but it’s a pity. Should I have kept him alive?”</p>
<p>“His magic power was depleting, so even if I had saved him, you would not have been able to use him.”</p>
<p>“That’s a pity.”</p>
