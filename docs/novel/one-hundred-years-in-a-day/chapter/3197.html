            <h3><strong>Chapter 327</strong></h3>
<p>I buried my face in his arms, embarrassed that I had let myself be so vulnerable yesterday. I heard a low chuckle, but I thought, I really have nothing to be ashamed of now.</p>
<p>“How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>He asked me, his low voice echoing in my barely drowsy mind, one hand still lazily stroking my hair.</p>
<p>I wondered if the soothing touch was meant to lull me back to sleep, but I had slept so soundly that it didn’t really matter.</p>
<p>“Good,” I said, not lying. Kaichen’s body was warm, and it felt good to hold him.</p>
<p>It was warmer in my bedroom compared to the rest of the house. Wrapped in a futon and nestled in his warm embrace, I worried I might start sweating.</p>
<p>Oh, is that why we’re taking off our clothes?</p>
<p>I nodded eagerly as I touched his bare back. He seemed surprised at my touch but didn’t pull away. I deeply sighed, savoring the comfort I didn’t want to wake up from.</p>
<p>His body flinched again, sensing my breath. A low sigh emanated from above.</p>
<p>“Don’t be naughty.”</p>
<p>My hand, which had been soothingly stroking his hair, finally dropped to his shoulder. I giggled inwardly at the firm grip. His genuine reaction was amusing, but I also appreciated that he wouldn’t let go.</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The hand around my waist tightened, and I could feel his hot breath on my shoulder. Something warm burned deep in my lungs as I inhaled his familiar scent.</p>
<p>Caught in the heat, I was trapped by his intoxicatingly sweet scent. I remained still as he called out to me in his wickedly sweet voice, determined to keep me here.</p>
<p>I didn’t even move as I felt his firm, hot hands stroke my back. After what seemed like an eternity, Kaichen buried his nose in the nape of my neck and pressed his lips to mine.</p>
<p>“There’s something I need to tell you.”</p>
<p>His voice was incredibly low, but I could hear the affection in it. I pressed my cheek against his chest to stifle a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>If I stood still and soaked up the sun, I would start sweating. Strangely, my body temperature is lower than everyone else’s, so this felt just right. Normally, I’d be wringing my hands in the heat.</p>
<p>Partly, it’s because I’m lying on a thick mat in the shade, shielded from the heat unlike the people running around. The breeze from the sky is cool. Although summer is on its way, having lived in Sharatan before, the current weather doesn’t seem all that hot to me.</p>
<p>“Countess, you should eat.”</p>
<p>Angel, who had been well trained by Barristan, now looked quite proper as he offered a basket of sandwiches to me.</p>
<p>I hadn’t seen Angel lately, as I was busy with travel and research. I heard he had been studying to learn how to be a servant, and the once newspaper-delivering boy now looked dignified in his regular clothes.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because he had been growing up, but Angel, already very tall, had become even taller.</p>
<p>Is it okay to grow so much all of a sudden? I’m seriously worried about his knees.</p>
<p>“I have no appetite. Angel, you eat,” I said.</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to eat a Countess’ meal…”</p>
<p>The way he looks at the sandwich while saying that reveals his immaturity. Still, a few months of education can change one’s life.</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes and smirked. Angel caught my gaze, blushed, and bowed his head low.</p>
<p>“Countess, do not mock me. I was an honor student during my education,” he protested lightly.</p>
<p>“Hmm… I don’t trust you.”</p>
<p>“That’s because you’ve been so easy on me, Countess.”</p>
<p>“Let’s say that’s true. You can really eat if you’re hungry. I won’t tell Barristan.”</p>
<p>Angel sighed openly and sat down on his butt a short distance away from me. It’s already bad manners to sit next to a master like that, but I made it easy on him.</p>
<p>Well, it was me Angel was serving, and Angel said he wouldn’t serve anyone but me, so I thought, what does it matter? It was out of character for me to be so stern like Barristan.</p>
<p>“What are you worried about? You don’t look happy.”</p>
<p>Angel shoved the sandwich into his mouth without hesitation. He may have grown up, but he was definitely still a kid. It was adorable how he perked up at me with the corner of his mouth raised, asking questions.</p>
<p>He stretched, yawned, and bent one leg, resting his elbow on his knee while rubbing his chin.</p>
<p>“Angel, you said I was comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Countess.”</p>
<p>“Do you… know what you’ve been telling me, day in and day out, that I’m a drunk and a gambling addict?”</p>
<p>“Me?!”</p>
<p>Angel exclaimed, spitting out the sandwich he was eating in surprise. It was cute to see his eyes widen in innocence.</p>
<p>I recalled how Angel used to greet me every day, one of the few people in a hundred years I could call meaningful. At first, I wondered if he was repeating the same words like a parrot, but no matter where I went or where we met, Angel would greet me.</p>
<p>No two parrots are the same.</p>
<p>Angel never showed a hint of pity towards me that I had always seen in others. To him, I must have been a “poor” Countess as he lived day in and day out just to feed his siblings.</p>
