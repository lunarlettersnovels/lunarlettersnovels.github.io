            <h3><strong>Chapter 260</strong></h3>
<p>Thirdly, I need to handle this situation with care. It might be the best approach, but my mind, currently fogged and disinterested in a conflict, isn’t working properly. Barristan, remember what I told you? I warned you that they would isolate me discreetly.” Barristan had assured me that things would be fine while I contemplated returning to social activities. Unfortunately, my expectations were way off, and Lamia’s actions unfolded exactly as I predicted.</p>
<p>“Why the silence? Have you lost your ability to chat like before?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s because she has no one to back her up. Without the Archmage’s support, she’s pretty much insignificant.”</p>
<p>Observing the two through blurry eyes, I pursed my lips. It wasn’t due to a sore throat or nervousness; it was an involuntary reaction. I realized I couldn’t let this slide without a response. Whether it turned into a major issue or not, I resolved to go with the second option.</p>
<p>“Are you familiar with the term ‘willfully ignorant’?”</p>
<p>“Hah! Do you think I’m uneducated?”</p>
<p>Yanghwa, who had been sitting quietly with a serene smile, finally spoke up. Deep dimples etched into her cheeks, her lovely smile gave me a slightly unsettling feeling.</p>
<p>“Foolish and lacking wisdom – that’s the essence of it. Ignorance is something one should beware of.”</p>
<p>“……!?”</p>
<p>“Especially as a lady, you ought to be acquainted with that term.” Yanghwa raised her neatly placed hand from her knee and softly stroked her teacup. “There’s no more fitting description for someone like the Lady.”</p>
<p>“What?! What on earth are you saying?!”</p>
<p>“I believe you understood perfectly. What else could it be but that? Perhaps ‘beastly’ would have been more suitable?”</p>
<p>“Goodness! Lady Sorel! What’s she saying? Is this real?”</p>
<p>“It’s true! His Highness the Prince recently entrusted a princess from a foreign land to a viscount… She’s just as ignorant and uncouth!”</p>
<p>Enraged, Lamia glared at Yanghwa, her eyes almost popping out, her anger causing her to tremble. Yet, despite the circumstances, Yanghwa maintained proper posture, undeniably the noblewoman who had experienced high society for a long time. Her words lacked decorum, but her posture exuded nobility.</p>
<p>Although her words weren’t exactly polite, they did maintain a degree of propriety. However, the tension between their escalating voices and the murmuring audience fostered a hostile atmosphere.</p>
<p>Even with the numerical disadvantage, Yanghwa still smiled while confidently lifting her chin.</p>
<p>“I’ve not misspoken. As far as I’m aware, the Empire doesn’t have such social norms as you suggested.”</p>
<p>“How could a foreign princess know that? This is the Kalhai Empire! Quit pretending to be knowledgeable!”</p>
<p>“You’re meddling needlessly, Your Highness. Given that you’re a princess from a remote continent, maintaining friendly relations with a rural lord, your standards are quite… unimpressive. Still, we will treat you with the respect befitting a noblewoman. I suggest you leave it at that.”</p>
<p>“Oh my! How intimidating.”</p>
<p>Yanghwa covered her mouth with both hands lightly, and her doe-like eyes widened as she scanned her surroundings. This behavior brought to mind the words I had advised her when she disembarked from the carriage.</p>
<p><em>‘Could it be…?’</em></p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn’t have been passive, watching the situation unfold with my clouded mind. I should have intervened earlier, taking on Lamia and Dubonnet. Considering all that had transpired since Yanghwa’s arrival in the Callheim Empire, I realized I needed to empower her. She was excessively innocent, overly pure; everyone regarded her as nothing but virtuous. If I wished to shield her from malicious individuals, this was the sole approach.</p>
<p>Even if a snake changes its skin, it remains a snake. Should I partake in gatherings within the social circle where several continued to sneer at Yanghwa, I had to be prepared for any outcome. Hence, I had earnestly imparted my counsel to her.</p>
<p><em>“So, you have to confront them in a group with a commanding demeanor, and act arrogantly until they are embarrassed. That’s roughly what ‘starting a spat’ means.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Okay. I’ll stir up trouble.”</em></p>
<p><em>“What if someone incited the Princess like that? Then you’d swiftly put the plan into action.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Plan?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes, let’s start with Plan A. Check the surroundings; if there’s a substantial audience, it’s a favorable situation. Begin by antagonizing the other person with words, then provoke them into slapping you once. If, despite that, they remain passive, you could even strike yourself and make it look like they did it. However, timing is crucial, given there are onlookers.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ah, timing… got it.”</em></p>
<p><em>“And you should cry. Your Highness, even if you sob loudly, your dignity won’t suffer. It might even be more convincing. Cry while pointing out their actions.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Right, I need to cry.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Understand? This strategy is all about timing. Getting slapped would be ideal, but as long as there’s an impression of being mistreated, it doesn’t matter.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Dalia is clever. How does she know so much?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Experiences, you know… I’ve encountered quite a lot.”</em></p>
<p>I had also elaborated extensively on leading them to a secluded spot for Plan B, showcasing their difference in power, and then employing intimidation. However, the present scenario undoubtedly warranted Plan A.</p>
<p>Though numerous people were present, they were predominantly Lamia and Dubonnet’s supporters. And while many nobles observed from a distance, they seemed unlikely to step forward as witnesses in case complications arose later.</p>
