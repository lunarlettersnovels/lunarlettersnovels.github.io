            <p><strong>Chapter 61</strong></p>
<p>I felt like I had succeeded in a very arduous goal. I felt so happy right now. Regardless of anything, the fact that Kaichen had acknowledged and recognized me made me all warm and fuzzy. <em>I am going to stick right next to him forever…</em></p>
<p>Even if I completed this novel with a happy ending, I wanted things to remain like this. I wanted to live peacefully with him. I always had an image of enjoying the rural life alone. I always pictured myself alone. Was it because I had accepted that there would be no one with me? Or was it because I knew that nobody would ever understand my loneliness and pain?</p>
<p>I was lonely from the moment I arrived in this novel and realized I was neither the protagonist, nor someone important or likable. I was trapped in a world which was under a spell for a hundred years. It made me despair. I hadn’t afforded myself the luxury of wishing someone to like and understand me.</p>
<p>So, I had decided I would help Julius until he became an emperor and quietly disappear into a peaceful life in the country for the rest of my life. <em>Well… that was what I had planned until…</em></p>
<p>I looked at Kaichen, who was quietly biting the siron and looking at the yellow willow leaves swaying in the wind. I wanted to freeze this moment and preserve it. I wished it would always be like. I wanted to stay here in this tranquil moment with a little anxiety gnawing at my heart.</p>
<p>Couldn’t I just tell him everything? Kaichen was a serious and strict man, but he would never abandon me no matter how ugly my truth was. Would he understand me? I had committed a hefty crime. Could he really brush that away and be with me? I wanted to tell him. I didn’t expect him to understand me, but I wanted somebody to tell me that it was okay. That everything would be okay.</p>
<p>I wanted to share it with someone in the hopes that the burden would be lighter on me. I remembered tat day when I was struggling with the symptoms of addiction, Kaichen had comforted me and told me that everything would be okay. That I will be alright.</p>
<p>I wanted to pour out my secrets and hear him say the same. That it was going to be alright. <em>Am I greedy in wishing that? </em>I sat there debating for and against the idea until eventually I couldn’t really tell him. Kaichen had just acknowledged me and accepted me as his disciple, I didn’t want that to be ruined. Human being are desperate creatures. I was used to his cold indifference and harsh words, but the warmth he had shown me today made me want more of it. I didn’t want him to revert back to his cold self towards me again.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help it. My heart fluttered whenever he looked at me with that warmth in his eyes. Besides, I didn’t want to ruin this tranquil and peaceful moment we shared together. I wanted to keep this moment with me. <em>Next time when I have a chance to tell him, I won’t avoid it.</em></p>
<p>I organized my thoughts and tried to lie back down on the bench. A golden butterfly flew by. Kaichen was obsessed with gold, I guessed.</p>
<p>“A magic letter.”</p>
<p>Each wizard had a different shape of receiving a magic letter. Julius’ was, obviously, of blazing blue flames. Kaichen’s was a gold butterfly. It was adorable that a cold, towering Kaichen had such an amiable messenger form. Kaichen seemed to avert my gaze.</p>
<p>“Your messenger… is very much like you.”</p>
<p>Kaichen glanced at me. The butterfly landed on his index finger before dissolving into gold powder and spitting out a parchment. It was so fascinating. This was my first time seeing a magic message. It was entrancing. In this world, letter could be sent by anyone via the Magic Association for a price. However, magical messages could be sent only by registered wizards. Usually, it’s in the form of a round spere of light that flies to the person and disperses. Kaichen’s was beautiful. It, however, consumed mana so I was surprised when Kaichen opted for magic messages. Usually, he likes to keep his mana consumption to the minimum and doesn’t care for fancy messengers.</p>
<p>However, sending magical messages was very convenient. The messages get delivered to great distances and really fast. <em>But it costs a lot of money…</em>. Great wizards usually stored a part of their mana on objects which they use to communicate, like the ring Kaichen uses to communicate with Julius. It was much like a video call. I was curious. If it was Julius, he would have just communicated through Kaichen’s ring, so who could have sent a magic letter?</p>
<p>“It’s for you,” said Kaichen.</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>Kaichen handed me the parchment. I accepted it. I recalled telling Angel, whom I had entrusted with the management of the mansion before leaving Acrab, that he could send a letter and address it to Kaichen in emergencies.</p>
