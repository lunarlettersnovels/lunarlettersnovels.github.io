            <p><b>Chapter 9</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mickey couldn’t go out of the house because he was weak and always needed expensive medicine. So, even though Mimi’s salary wasn’t that little, they still had to live poorly. And just recently, she had heard Mickey wasn’t feeling well… In fact, with this condition, the child would only last about a week at most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the medicine that could save the child costs a lot of money, so Mimi had no choice but to suffer in despair. The reason why Mickey’s condition worsened was because of Dalia, who had fired all servants from the mansion. Fired from her position as a maid and now jobless, Mimi couldn’t earn money to pay for medicine, and as a result, Mickey’s condition deteriorated rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t have Dalia’s memories. But don’t people usually absorb all the memories of the person they transmigrated into at times like this?! D*mn you Dalia, I’m running around trying to clean up the mess you made</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It feels unfair, but there was nothing I could do. Because I was Dalia now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimi was a sweet and good maid. She was always diligent, frugal, and a woman who loved her younger brother. Dalia seemed to have liked her quite a bit, too. Because she gave her generous severance pay when she was fired. Of course, that was also something I overheard while listening to Las, who runs a restaurant and bar at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wandered the bleak, small front yard in front of Mimi’s house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss…..?” The occupant, who had opened the door with swollen eyes, was certainly surprised with my unannounced visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I waved awkwardly, Mimi pursed her lips and teared up. She was quite a miserable sight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was trapped in time magic, I had spied Mimi countless of times through the cracks in the window, holding her brother’s hand and crying. And over that long period, I’ve managed to save Mickey countless times. It has come to the point that I’ve become proficient with it and I can now treat him even with my eyes closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The library of the Acrab was very spacious and enormous. Such knowledge was made possible by the numerous master craftsmen who lived in Acrab. It is even rumored to be comparable to that of the Imperial Palace Library of the Kalhai Empire. And because I had more than enough time trapped in time magic… I had read all the books in the library of Acrab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss, how did you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimi quickly wiped the tears that fell from her face and ran towards me to open the gate. Of course, I was able to jump over the gate that was only about up to my waist, but… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard Mickey’s health got worse?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For m-miss to come here…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimi couldn’t finish her sentence. Still, she didn’t resent me. Because I gave her a lot of severance pay when she was fired, so she probably had enough money to live until she could get a new job. However, Mimi had entrusted Mickey to a ‘skillful’ doctor, gave him all of her severance pay, and of course, only realized it too late it had all been a scam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a person is forced to a corner, they are bound to overthink. Rather than resenting the fraud doctor, she thought it would have been better if she hadn’t been fired from her job in the first place. Mimi blamed Dalia like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I soon learned that Dalia’s reason for firing all the people in the mansion was to pay the taxes herself, instead of the people living in her territory. When the maids and other servants who blamed Dalia knew about this, they were overcome with shame for their unfair resentment for their old master.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now, Mimi welcomed me but she couldn’t make eye contact properly.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she didn’t resent me now, her past actions had made her feel ashamed towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, such one-sided dismissal is bound to be an object of resentment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understood the minds of people like Mimi. Especially, when the generous severance pay was swindled, she would have needed someone to blame. Dalia was a gambler and a drunkard, a good enough subject for resentment. The only thing Dalia, despite being a trainwreck, did well was paying taxes on behalf of people who lived on her territory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was some medicine left in the mansion so I brought it here. It might be able to save Mickey.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bowed my head and wrapped my arm around Mimi’s back, and asked her to go inside. She tried to say something with her round eyes and slightly trembling mouth, but I opened the door and went into the room where Mickey was. How many times do you think I’ve been here? Even without guidance, I knew where Mickey’s room was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Mickey exhaling hot breaths with a pale complexion as if he would lose air soon, I smiled. I have experienced numerous failures to save this young boy. And everytime, it was agonizing to see Mickey suffering from medicine’s failure, even though I knew he would return to his original state when the day resets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was almost like a human experiment, but I wanted to save this child. I couldn’t dwell too much on whether my way had been humane or not. Else, I would be driven to insanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone asked me how I was after being trapped for a hundred years, could I proudly say, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I haven’t gone mad?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many things I didn’t want to recall during that period of time; I’ve done a lot of horrible things that I couldn’t tell others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a person’s loneliness reaches its peak, they become vicious. Just as Mimi blamed me instead of the quack doctor, I, too, also reasoned that I needed an object to blame and vent my anger on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terrible memories I wanted to hide have been a fraction of a hundred years, but they brought to me a big change: I no longer felt human emotions like being ‘humane’. I just pretend to feel it. Like helping Angel or saving Mickey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As memories I had buried deeper than the darkness of the abyss began to slip from the abscess of my mind, Mimi’s call brought me back to my senses. </span></p>
