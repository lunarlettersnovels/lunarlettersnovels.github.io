            <p><strong>Chapter 86</strong></p>
<p>His beautiful bronze skin was flustered and red. His forehead was beaded with sweat. He closed his eyes and swept his hands through his hair. Perhaps he was taking a deep breath to calm himself. His chest rose and subsided in rhythm. I watched him and forgot to breathe.</p>
<p>He was like a painting. A gorgeous, breath-taking painting. I swallowed and stared at him. Kaichen noticed me looking and glared at me a while longer before muttering, “Damn it!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Teacher!” I reached out, but it was too late. He has already disappeared from the middle of the street with the teleportation magic.</p>
<p>After standing there in a daze, I burst into nervous laughter recalling his reactions. “Why is he so cute?” I muttered. <em>I am really losing my mind! </em>Although he looked angry, I knew he was shy and he couldn’t stand feeling embarrassed. He was so flustered he used magic to disappear! I couldn’t hold back my laughter at that. Considering the situation in Acrab right now, I shouldn’t be laughing but this was just too funny.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I made my way home after a good, hearty laugh. We had only inspected two patients from two households for today and we were able to analyse the nature of the poison to some extent. The poison was undoubtedly similar to the one I was given but it certainly had more narcotics that made the people behave crazy and wild. The situation was grim but because of what happened with Kaichen, I wasn’t as depressed as I expected to be.</p>
<p>I headed to the bridge I used to visit frequently in the past. Whenever I approached this bridge, I felt like jumping off it. But the stream wasn’t even deep enough. Even if I were to jump, I wouldn’t even drown. I did jump from it before when I was trapped. Right now, I feel tranquil and at peace. This was new. I had come a long way.</p>
<p>“Countess Alshine,” called someone. I had been daydreaming as I watched the stream flowing down the bridge. I turned around at the unfamiliar voice and saw a neatly dressed man with a kind face looking my way. He placed his right palm on his chest and bowed respectfully.</p>
<p>“Nice to see you again.”</p>
<p>I blinked and looked at the man closely. He was a stranger. I had never seen him before in my life. But maybe Dalia had known him before I possessed her body. He certainly seemed to know her well.</p>
<p>“Is something the matter?” he asked.</p>
<p>I had tried to pretend to not know him but there was something about his swept dark brown hair and gentle eyes that bothered me. The man approached me, narrowing the distance between us while I tried not to flinch. I maintained my composure and looked back at the stream.</p>
<p>“I am glad that you are safe. I was worried. You weren’t here in Acrab so I searched for you for a while.”</p>
<p>“Why were you looking for me?” I asked. He looked genuinely concerned. Maybe he was a loyal follower of the Alshine family. However, it bothered me that he looked on edge and stressed. It was certainly giving out red flags.</p>
<p><em>Who is he? </em>I wondered. <em>Someone Dalia owed money to? Someone she met at the gambling house? He doesn’t really look like a gambler…. </em>He certainly wasn’t local to Acrab because I knew everyone in Acrab. <em>Is he a merchant? No… something’s wrong…</em></p>
<p>“Did the Archmage Kaichen heal you?” he asked. “You look well.” His voice didn’t give away anything. Gentle eyes and dark brown hair. But the eyes looking at me were red. <em>Red eyes…. </em>My head throbbed. I thought I saw those eyes somewhere. Suddenly I felt nauseous and dizzy. I had taken my medicine on time. But the sight of this man triggered my symptoms. I hid my hand. I didn’t want him to see it. The man smiled nastily.</p>
<p>“Seems like you haven’t healed completely.” His smile was evil. I backed away from him. He leaned on the bridge as though it didn’t matter to him. “I can’t be bothered by him again. I need to get the subject of my experiment back.”</p>
<p>“Get lost!” I shouted. “I am no one’s subject for experiment.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you the medium for forbidden magic?” He chuckled. “I chose you. I was the one who comforted the countess during her darkest days. Have you already forgotten?”</p>
<p><em>What a load of rubbish!</em> I glared at him. The man’s eyes turned even redder than before. <em>I am dead! </em>The man smirked at me and my vision turned black.</p>
<p>I had wondered, more than once, how we could find the black magician Antares. I hadn’t known he would appear in front of me so casually. <em>Was it his plan? Had he been watching us? He appeared exactly at a time when I was no longer with Kaichen. </em>It must have been a coincidence! I teased Kaichen and Kaichen had disappeared. I hoped that Kaichen had reached the castle safely as I fell into the darkness. This kind of darkness and despair was too familiar to me now. It didn’t scare me anymore.</p>
