            <h3><strong>Chapter 317</strong></h3>
<p>“…Is that a myth?”</p>
<p>These were my first words after Jungyeonhae’s story ended. Norse and Greek mythology naturally came to mind.</p>
<p>“You could say so.”</p>
<p>Jungyeonhae did not deny it.</p>
<p>According to the story, the world had once perished due to the sorrow of the blue dragon, and the history created by the surviving humans was documented in the books of history.</p>
<p>The story of Teramedeo’s beginning was something unheard of in Kalhai. This is probably because as thousands of years passed, the western continent where the Kalhai Empire was located was constantly at war, and countries were repeatedly established and destroyed.</p>
<p>There was no way the story of the beginning could have been conveyed properly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Suran Empire was different. Although it was not a country that had been around since the start of Teramedeo, its royal lineage had changed only once until now.</p>
<p>Suran Empire alone was a country boasting an over-thousand-year history, so it was natural.</p>
<p>“I may not know the birth of the world, but I can agree to some extent that the birth of the continent and life on this land was from the dragon’s breath.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that… the most absurd thing? You mean dragons created humans in the first place?”</p>
<p>“Suran’s murals often contain images that are believed to be dragons. Traces of dragons are often found in the ruins of ancient countries, and I am not stupid enough to deny that.”</p>
<p>I nodded awkwardly at Jungyeonhae’s firmness.</p>
<p>No one here is as certain about the existence of dragons as I am. In the novel, there was no mention of dragons. I thought there might be some connection because the title included Blue Dragon.</p>
<p>Wait, there is definitely a blue dragon… Four dragons were born, but three died, and only the blue dragon was alive.</p>
<p>In that case, I seemed to have some idea why the title is “The Protector of the Blue Dragon, Julius.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t be sure, but if the story Jungyeonhae told is true, there is a high probability that Julius could hear the voice of the Blue Dragon. After all, he is the protagonist.</p>
<p>“This story… does it have something to do with time magic?”</p>
<p>It’s not like he suddenly showed off the tattoos on his arm and talked about mythology on a whim. An explanation for time magic, Julius’s request, and the truth passed down in Suran’s long history…</p>
<p>There was a reason for all these things.</p>
<p>Jungyeonhae rolled his eyes smoothly and, for some reason, looked at the Kaichen, who was unusually quiet today.</p>
<p>“The Blue Dragon’s scales… there is a way to summon the vanished Blue Dragon.”</p>
<p>I blinked my eyes wide. It was a more absurd statement than the cheesy mythological story, and I wasn’t sure how to react to it.</p>
<p>“He flew into the sky. I don’t know how long ago it was, but you’re saying we can summon something almost like a god?”</p>
<p>A method to summon the Blue Dragon, which was akin to a deity often found in fantasy novels? It was so absurd that my jaw opened in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Why on earth do you have that? No, I mean…  Why on earth do you know how to summon a god? Why leave something like that behind, knowing it could get into the wrong hands?”</p>
<p>In disbelief, I poured out my words, which sounded like an argument and demanding an explanation. Jungyeonhae responded by brushing his arm and answering.</p>
<p>“I guess it’s a kind of mercy left behind by the blue dragon before disappearing. “Because in the east of the divided continent, he left only one way to call him, and in the west, he left someone who could hear his voice.”</p>
<p>“What…”</p>
<p>“This is something only conveyed to the Emperor of Suran. This is the method.”</p>
<p>The tattoos on both arms, filled with strange characters and drawings, now looked different. What I thought was just a unique tattoo now appeared terrifying enough to cause panic.</p>
<p>To casually show such a dangerous thing!</p>
<p>“Only those of our family lineage, becoming an emperor, can inherit this.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“However, even if you inherit it, it doesn’t mean everyone can read it. It’s said that only one person over several generations can read it.”</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes and looked at the  Jungyeonhae. Since he brought up this story, he could read the inherited tattoo.</p>
<p>“Just because you can read it doesn’t mean you can summon the Blue Dragon easily. The conditions are strict,” he said.</p>
<p>“…Is this related to time magic?”</p>
<p>“You’re quite perceptive.”</p>
<p>Jungyeonhae extended his hand to me and opened three fingers. “There are three conditions,” he began.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“First, break the taboo three times that will overshadow the beauty of the world. To be precise, there must be three incidents that will overshadow the beauty of the world.”</p>
<p>The time magic that occurred three times in my mind came to mind. One condition was fulfilled.</p>
<p>“Second, the land must be stained with blood due to cruel deaths. To put it accurately, when the land is filled with sorrow to the point where the sky sheds tears.”</p>
<p>Listening to this point, I thought the Blue Dragon, who had shown mercy, might have told us not to summon him any longer. Seeing my puzzled face, Jungyeonhae shrugged and folded the last finger.</p>
<p>“Then, what’s the third?”</p>
<p>he looked at Kaichen and slowly said, “We need a divine incarnation of magic.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The Gold Dragon, who sacrificed himself for the Blue Dragon and became magic. Even though it became magic, its will remains. To eventually comfort the sorrowful Blue Dragon.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“We need the existence of a divine incarnation. His sacrifice is the last condition.”</p>
