            <p><strong>Chapter 131</strong></p>
<p>However, that was the original Julius I had read about, the one I was talking with was a little different.  This was the biggest change from the original story. He should have at least three women he was close with according to the original novel. I had asked Kaichen about it. From what he told me, Julius had been the same playboy he was in the original novel, but now he had stopped being promiscuous since his coronation as the Crown Prince.</p>
<p><em>It’s strange. The Ruler of the Back-alley World, the Queen of the Night, a princess from the eastern continent, and the precious daughter of a duke should be the ones hounding him. </em>There was a fierce battle between enthusiastic readers about who he would be with. Other things were fun, but seeing Julius entangled with women with very different personalities was simply exciting. The heroine was a matter of particular concern among the readers. I didn’t know who he would end up with, so even I used to say, “Just be happy with your Kaichen.”</p>
<p>The three formidable women weren’t just romantic interests to Julius, they were very strong supporters of the Crown Prince. They all were fierce and powerful. Their assistance was essential for Julius to succeed as the emperor.</p>
<p>[Everyone in high society is waiting for your debut. A ball will be held for your upcoming birthday, so the stage has already been decided.]</p>
<p>“Huh? Why wasn’t I told anything about this? A ball?!”</p>
<p>[I did tell Kaichen about it. You are to attend the ball in ten days’ time.]</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear about it.”</p>
<p>[There is no way he forgot. Which means, he deliberately withheld the information.] Julius shook his head. [It is clear what he was thinking.]</p>
<p>“That he doesn’t like crowded places like the ball?”</p>
<p>[No, because… forget it for now. Anyway, you must attend, so be prepared. It would be better if you are accompanied by Kaichen.]</p>
<p>“Will the teacher want to accompany me?” There was nothing better than to attend a ball by the Archmage Kaichen’s side to establish a solid foothold in high society. But Kaichen hated balls and crowds. Maybe that was why he didn’t tell me about it.</p>
<p>Julius grinned wickedly. [He will attend. Show him the dress you’re going to wear for the ball. No, rather I’ll send you a dress myself.]</p>
<p>“A dress?”</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>“Oh, come on. Why should I show my dress to the teacher?”</p>
<p>Julius looked at me like I was a fool. He shrugged. [Well, he is a teacher who cares about his disciple, so if he wants to protect you from other men’s nasty gaze, won’t he step in?]</p>
<p>I imagined Kaichen’s displeased gaze. It was possible. He kept nagging at me endlessly to not be so frivolous. He might follow just to make sure I don’t trample on my dress and fall face down.</p>
<p>When I said this to Julius, he nodded. He told me to keep some things in mind while staying here in the capital then cut off the communication. I stared blankly in the air for a while. It felt like so many things had happened in such a short amount of time. Even though the only thing I ever did was to watch Kaichen as he made his wand.</p>
<p><em>A marriage proposal? Proposal to make a wand together means…. </em>It was so shocking. I now understand why he had looked so resigned and stormed off.</p>
<p><em>“Forget it, I’m a fool for thinking too much about it,” </em>he had said.</p>
<p>He could have just told me what it meant. <em>If he had told me, would I have canceled the proposal?</em> I did want to be with him for the rest of my life. I was sure I didn’t want anyone else to be with him. I had assumed we would be living as a teacher and disciple all our lives. But… if possible, I do want to be the person he loves and would want to love him back. I wanted to tell him I liked him.</p>
<p>But how is the relationship between me and Kaichen now? <em>It’s not like we have something going on, but I can’t say that we are an ordinary teacher and disciple, either. It’s somewhat hard to pin down. He seems to cherish me too much….</em></p>
<p>That was the problem. I didn’t know if he cherished me because I was his first disciple or because…</p>
<p>According to Julius, as a loyal informant, Kaichen devoted himself to research as a devotee of magic. Even when Julius indulged in courtships, Kaichen did not participate. He had never held hands with someone. When I thought about my previous life where I loved dating, I assumed it would make me his senior in such things. I had more experience in that regard.</p>
<p>“I’m stressed out!” I hated being confused. I had never made a move, but he was always so busy, and I didn’t even know if he liked me. I liked the current friendly Kaichen to the aloof and mean one he had been in the past, but I was afraid that if I made a move and he didn’t like it, I would lose the friendship we presently have. Love made me a coward.</p>
<p>“I should sleep for now.” trying not to think of my throbbing head and my grave mistake of the day, I lay down on my bed. The pillow smelled familiar.</p>
