            <h3>Chapter 346</h3>
<p>The familiar sight of the square brought back fresh memories.</p>
<p><em>“Dalia, you won.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I can live well now.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Even though you won.”</em></p>
<p>It was the time when I first thought he might like me.</p>
<p>No, maybe even before that. If there was a moment of certainty, it was probably then. When we came to Heulin, we did something that felt like a “date” for the first time.</p>
<p>Here, at this square, he sparred with Chushinik for me. You confidently said you’d win after I told you not to lose because I feared someone else might take me away.</p>
<p>It was the first time. It was a moment of courage.</p>
<p>The day I decided I wanted to confess to Kaichen. This was the moment and place where I made that decision.</p>
<p>My mind, once filled with negative thoughts, was now covered with warm memories. I could barely catch my breath.</p>
<p>“Ugh… h-huh, ugh…”</p>
<p>A tingling pain spread through my body, and my chest ached. I thought I could handle the pain by now, but it was unbearable. My whole body felt like it was being crushed by a tremendous pain that couldn’t be described with words.</p>
<p>My knees buckled weakly under the crushing, throbbing pain.</p>
<p>“Ugh, aaaaah—!”</p>
<p>I screamed. How, how could I be okay?</p>
<p>There’s no way I can endure this. It’s different from the hundred years when I didn’t know anything. Without Kaichen by my side, I can’t survive at all.</p>
<p>Tears streamed down, revealing the fragility of this moment.</p>
<p>I wanted to win. Just once, I wanted to win. I’m just a supporting character, but wouldn’t be great if I became the main character? I thought it could happen as long as I thought positively.</p>
<p>But, of course, life doesn’t bend to our thoughts. I sighed.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>It’s terrifying. In this empty place where there’s no one but me and the clear sky—where the only thing I can hear is my breathing.</p>
<p>What else could be more cruel than this reality I’m facing?</p>
<p>“…Lovely child.”</p>
<p>My breath caught in my throat as the unfamiliar voice vibrated in my head. The voice felt like it would tear me apart, and I screamed. My back bent. Even though I covered my ears, the ringing didn’t stop.</p>
<p>“…pitiful child, who sees the world more beautifully than anyone else… So, to you… I shall… give you…”</p>
<p>I couldn’t hear properly what was being said.</p>
<p>I only desperately wished it would stop. It felt like not just my eardrums but my brain would burst. No, my whole body felt like it would burst.</p>
<p>“Ah, augh! Huh, aaaaargh!”</p>
<p>It was another scream of agony, different from the one I had shouted until my throat went hoarse. My throat hurt from pain. The floor, wet with tears, was now soaked with blood. I couldn’t tell if I was vomiting or bleeding.</p>
<p>“…. Lovely child… cherish… the blessing… of… now.”</p>
<p>That was the end of the dreadful ringing.</p>
<p>My trembling body collapsed in an instant. I remained sprawled on the ground without the strength to move a finger. Despite the clammy sweat covering my body, thankfully, the pain was no longer there.</p>
<p>Strangely, apart from the sticky feeling from the sweat, I felt surprisingly refreshed. It felt odd, as if the blood from earlier was an illusion.</p>
<p>“What… was that just now?”</p>
<p>I looked around with hazy eyes, trying to turn my tired head, but there was no way to know. It seemed like someone’s voice, a memory, or perhaps some divine intervention.</p>
<p>“Haah…”</p>
<p>I felt like I was dying, but now, the overwhelmingly sad and painful feeling was gone, and I regained a bit of composure.</p>
<p>Taking deep breaths, I slowly got up this time.</p>
<p>“Ha! Surely, it wasn’t the voice of the blue dragon or something.”</p>
<p>I muttered and stopped abruptly. An awkward silence enveloped me. It was silent since no one else was around, but I had the illusion that someone was watching me.</p>
<p>After futilely scanning the surroundings, I swallowed dry saliva.</p>
<p>“I think… it said it would… give me something….”</p>
<p>I scanned the square. It was still empty, with no signs of life. I frowned. Given the situation, I couldn’t help but laugh. Have I gone crazy?</p>
<p>Perhaps because I had regained some composure, suddenly something sparked inside my head—another way to break the time magic.</p>
<p>I wondered why I hadn’t thought of this method before.</p>
<p>“If I break the crystal… I might be able to leave.”</p>
<p>I remembered that I could use magic even within the space of time magic. If it didn’t work out, I might sink halfway into the black swamp, but…</p>
<p>Swallowing my saliva, I reached out into the empty space.</p>
<p>My trembling hand was stark pale. But I didn’t have the confidence to endure anymore. Although it had only been a few days.</p>
<p>This time felt more hellish than the hundred years I was trapped in Acrab. Now that I know about love, there was no way I wouldn’t go crazy.</p>
<p>I miss Kaichen. I can’t live a single day without him.</p>
<p>I came to a resolute conclusion.</p>
<p><em>“Dalia, my Dalia.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I love you—not just parts of you.”</em></p>
<p>A man who vowed to save me. A desperate man who had already saved me many times and continued to promise to do so.</p>
