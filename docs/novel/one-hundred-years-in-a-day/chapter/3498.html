            <p><strong>Chapter 26</strong></p>
<p>The woman put the scroll aside and put her hands together. “Don’t forget that this is just the beginning, Asta.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Tell Momalhout to do nothing and just lay low for now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>“Whatever it may be, it seems like for the time being we can be at peace.”</p>
<p>As the woman smiled with satisfaction, Asta disappeared without leaving a trace, just like when he had first appeared. The woman, who was alone now, leaned slowly against the chair, glancing at the piled documents.</p>
<p>“I just have to continue like this…… Julius, I will not lose to you.” Unlike the cold smile on a pure and beautiful face, her blue eyes were full of passion.</p>
<p>Akshetra Kalhai, Imperial princess and stepsister to Julius. Until Julius’s existence was revealed to the world, she was the Crown Princess and the sole heir to the throne. The unfortunate princess who was deprived of everything and who was qualified to receive protection of the blue dragon would not give up.</p>
<p>“It is me who will become the Emperor, Julius.” There was a fear no one knew about in her boiling desire, but Akshetra lightly pressed her forehead and picked up the documents to do her work.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I woke up to the sound of birds chirping. Instead of feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, my head throbbed in protest. I rubbed my eyes and frowned. The chirping was really getting annoying now. <em>Today’s breakfast will be grilled bird meat if these birds don’t shut up!</em></p>
<p>After forcing myself to get up from the bed, I opened the window. The sun hadn’t risen yet and dawn was just emerging. The fact that finally I had fallen asleep only to wake up to the birds screaming made me very angry. I really wanted to grill them. <em>Why do birds have to chirp so early and so loudly? </em>Normally, I would have screamed so loudly to scare the birds away from the window but when I saw the yellow roses in full bloom in the yard and the rustling willow tree by the pond, I could not scream.</p>
<p><em>This is not Acrab</em>, I reminded myself. <em>This is Kaichen’s house. Kaichen, my teacher. </em>Even if it was just temporary. My head throbbed and I felt nauseous. I was also very hungry.</p>
<p><em>This is getting serious. </em>A throbbing head, trembling hands, nausea, and now insomnia. I entertained myself with the thought of whether I should take up alcohol again just to be rid of these symptoms. I wasn’t reliant on alcohol like Dalia, but her body and its withdrawal symptoms were making me crazy.</p>
<p><em>Dalia, d*mn you Dalia! Why the hell did you have to do this to yourself? What was so unbearable that you had to get to this state? </em>I cursed her as I asked the unanswerable question. I yawned and stretched. I couldn’t go back to sleep anyway, and there was nothing to do in this empty room. I decided to take a walk near the house, which I wasn’t able to do yesterday.</p>
<p><em>Should I take some books with me too? </em>It would be the perfect time to read the book that Kaichen had given me. It was still dark, but it didn’t matter. I could use magic to create a small light. The cool air soothed my throbbing head a little.</p>
<p><em>If the original story goes on, nothing special will happen for the next three months. But after that… </em>I sighed deeply, recalling the original story that I had thought about for the thousandth time.<em> Will I be able to get my alcoholic body back to normal in three months? Or will treatment be better in this case?</em></p>
<p>While trapped in time magic, I never imagined that this body’s addiction to alcohol would be so serious. When I felt my hands tremble if I didn’t drink for a day, I just thought that it would get better. However, after returning to reality outside of time magic, I realized that this body was in an even worse condition than I had imagined it to be.</p>
<p>I had thought that my trembling hands were the only problem, but all kinds of symptoms started to manifest. <em>How can I overcome this? </em>It was fortunate that I believed that it was possible for me to survive without resorting to alcohol. However, I felt so anxious that my physical health deteriorated every day. If this goes on, and if I am unable to cope with it, I might start searching for alcohol soon.</p>
<p>“I must make the cure.” I spat out the words of determination, passed the yard, and laid down on a pretty meadow full of wildflowers. A small sphere of light that I had made with magic floated over me. It was brighter than a lamp and I didn’t need to hold it on my palms to be able to read. Everything was set. I could begin reading the book.</p>
<p><em>Hmm… It’s really not that different from making Mickey’s medicine. The efficacy of the medicine is also something to consider, but I need to know the symptoms of the disease in detail.</em> I didn’t think it’s going to be very difficult because I had already made the medicine that treated Mickey’s disease, which wasn’t yet identified.</p>
<p>I had read so many books before that it didn’t take me long to complete the book that Kaichen had given me. After finishing reading it, I covered my face with the book. <em>Treatment for Alcoholism… I might need Kaichen’s help…. </em>But I was someone who knew all the medical books and herbal medicine of Acrab. Maybe I can do it.</p>
