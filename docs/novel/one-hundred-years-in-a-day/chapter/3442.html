            <p><strong>Chapter 81</strong></p>
<p>How many times have I killed them? I remember everything. No matter how many times I reminded myself that they were alive now and the time magic was broken, it didn’t make it any easier for me. I had taken my medicine, but my hands still trembled. It wasn’t because of alcoholism anymore. I clenched and unclenched my fists.</p>
<p>I stood at the door trying to heave deep breaths and calm myself. Kaichen, normally, would have asked me why I was being late but right now he waited silently beside me, giving me space. I swallowed and unclenched my fists and walked inside.</p>
<p>Victor. He was a diligent young man who lived alone. He had inherited the grocery store from his parents in the central shopping district in Acrab. He had a timid personality and a crush on Rush, the blacksmith. He was never able to confess. When you have a hundred years to live with no way out, you notice things about people. I use to observe him when he went red in the face whenever Rush walked by him.</p>
<p>But invasion of privacy was wrong. Just because I was lonely doesn’t mean I get to spy on people like it wasn’t a sin. I had acted like a psychopath. I had experimented on people and caused their deaths. I had stalked people of Acrab just because I had nothing to do. <em>I am sorry Victor.</em></p>
<p>The guilt ravaged at me constantly. It was why I would never be able to get over the guilt of my actions enough to be friendly with the people of Acrab anymore.</p>
<p>When I opened the door, the air was musty inside the house. It smelled like a dump. Those who lived alone had no choice. When they fell sick, they couldn’t even take care of themselves so how could they clean their space. I glanced around the living room. Rotten fruit lined the selves. Old clothes were strewn on the floor.</p>
<p>“Teacher!” I exclaimed remembering Kaichen was here with me. “Don’t come in! It smells terrible in here. This must be horrible for you. I am so sorry.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright,” said Kaichen. “It’s a patient’s house. I am not here to judge.”</p>
<p>“No! You will get dirty.” Kaichen frowned and stood at the door, looking at me. He then entered the house without protest. He had mysophobia, so I was greatly worried. He scowled. <em>I did tell you not to come in.</em></p>
<p>What is the probability that someone like Kaichen, who has mysophobia, would enter a house like this? I have never seen him going to other people’s houses. Ever. I felt sorry for him and tried to push him out of the door. Victor was messy and a bit lazy. He wasn’t the cleanest person but the disease must have affected him so much that he had simply left the place to rot.</p>
<p>I tried to usher Kaichen out of the door, but he didn’t budge. He grimaced but stayed put. He looked at me with a determined face.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” he asked. It must have been a shock to him. Kaichen stared at me in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “I have a strong stomach.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying this is something you can tolerate if you have a strong stomach?”</p>
<p>“To some extent. Teacher, it’s hard to bear it, right? Go out. I’m good at cleaning, so I’ll call you after I clean it up.”</p>
<p>“Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Why should you clean this place?” he asked in disbelief.</p>
<p><em>Then how are you going to last in here? </em>I tried to usher him outside once again but he wouldn’t budge at all. He looked annoyed. He stretched a hand in the sir and muttered something. A golden, glittery light scattered around the room. The effect was quick. Did he use this magic to keep the Willow House always clean? No wonder it was always neat. It must consume a lot of mana but Kaichen looked unfazed. <em>Whoa, he isn’t called the archmage for nothing.</em></p>
<p>“How on earth can you endure this?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Forget it.”</p>
<p>The air had been purified. The cobwebs and dirt had been swished away. Everything looked clean. Well… almost everything. The clothes had to be cleaned by hand. It was still on the floor. But the room didn’t smell anymore.</p>
<p>“Were you very surprised?” I asked. “Teacher, most men who live alone seem to live like this.”</p>
