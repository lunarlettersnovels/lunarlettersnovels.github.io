<h3><strong>Chapter 299</strong></h3>
<p><em>“Master, can you think that the person I was from back then and now are different?’</em></p>
<p>He assumed it was jealousy about the forgotten past. It seemed cute, and because of that, he nodded as if he understood.</p>
<p>But Dalia <em>truly </em>was a different person.</p>
<p>Kaichen couldn’t help but be flustered but tried his best to maintain composure.</p>
<p>Dalia, who usually told long stories, summarized the content, clearing her throat and finishing with a deep exhale. She looked somewhat relieved.</p>
<p>It was beyond flustering; her unexpected revelation was shocking to the point where words didn’t come. Only his furrowed brows conveyed his current state of mind.</p>
<p>He felt strangely weak despite recovering his mana in the Willow House for nearly ten days. It was as if he ran out of mana again!</p>
<p>“Uhm… that’s it.”</p>
<p>As if saying there was nothing more to discuss, Dalia sighed deeply and looked more relieved than earlier.</p>
<p>She didn’t look like she lost her mind due to the agony and pain of her imprisonment. She had even asked him to listen carefully.</p>
<p>They had to consider her mental state seriously. After all, they said truly insane people didn’t even know they were crazy…</p>
<p>But what if Dalia wasn’t crazy and everything she said was true? The conflicting emotions swirled in his mind.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s brows furrowed deeper.</p>
<p>“It’s… it’s hard to believe, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>It was difficult.</p>
<p>But, despite his true feelings, the words that came out were surprisingly light, adding to the already bewildering situation.</p>
<p>“It must be true if you said it,” he said.</p>
<p>No matter how great his love for her was, fully believing Dalia’s words was still challenging. However, she had no reason to fabricate such a bizarre story.</p>
<p>He briefly wondered if she had been brainwashed after being captured by Exchetra, but the words that came out of Dalia’s mouth were not something that would benefit that person in any way.</p>
<p>His confused mind was overloaded as if he encountered a complex magical formula.</p>
<p>“Why… why do you look so displeased, then?” Dalia asked, peering up at him.</p>
<p>“Anyone would look like this when faced with such a truth,” he replied honestly.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see…”</p>
<p>“Believing and understanding are quite different.”</p>
<p>“Indeed… it is.”</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>Kaichen glanced at Dalia, who looked unusually low and sulky. His mind felt dizzy as if a storm had just passed, but taking a deep breath made him feel a bit clearer.</p>
<p>This world was part of a story. Julius is the protagonist, Exchetra is the antagonist, and he is the protagonist’s friend…</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>his</em> Dalia sitting in front of him died while reading the story and entered the body of the original ‘Dalia.’</p>
<p><em>‘Am I going crazy?’</em></p>
<p>The information was too absurd to accept readily; it would take quite some time to process.</p>
<p>“Are you disappointed because I’m not the Dalia you knew, Master? No, I wonder if you’re scared… It would have been better if I was your first love, even if I don’t remember, rather than be someone else entirely…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“It’s not a lie. I didn’t deceive you, Master… When another soul enters a body, they usually hide it at first. Besides, it’s a story that’s hard to believe from the start…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Even if I had told you the truth as soon as we met, you wouldn’t have believed me.”</p>
<p>It was the truth. His first impression of Dalia wasn’t good.</p>
<p>The sight of him running around excitedly while crying on a rainy day was so different from the child I remembered from my childhood that I had no idea if he was the same person.</p>
<p>He remembered her running happily in the rain. It was so different from the young Dalia he knew. He couldn’t recognize her as the same person.</p>
<p>Moreover, Dalia was a medium for time magic, and under the influence of the Ohabdok poison, her mental state was extremely unstable.</p>
<p>No matter what she said to him, he wouldn’t have listened in that situation. If she had said something honest, he would have immediately labeled Dalia insane.</p>
<p>In any case, a medium for time magic would likely be shunned and wouldn’t have lived long. Regardless of Dalia’s intentions, they would have taken her to the Magic Tower for Time Magic research.</p>
<p>Then, she probably would have been abandoned in Acrab.</p>
<p>Ironically, he might have felt a sense of satisfaction recalling the past. At that time, his feelings of dislike towards Dalia were stronger.</p>
<p>“Haven’t I told you before?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I must have told you to be proud.”</p>
<p>Kaichen recalled what might have happened to Dalia and he had chills without realizing it. He was relieved that it didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Rather than sorting out his complicated thoughts, he decided it was more important to relieve his beloved partner’s anxiety.</p>
<p>What could be more important than that?</p>
<p>“You’re the last person I’ll ever love,” he said.</p>
<p>Dalia looked startled, and then her shoulders slumped. “Ah…”</p>
<p>“The fact that you’re that person in my heart will never change,” he said. Dalia remained silent, her eyes doe-eyed. “There’s nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p>She looked about to burst into tears. He realized every time she was anxious, that casual smile appeared.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, seeing her blushing fair face and pursed lips was lovely.</p>
<p>Did it matter if she was another soul or if someone wrote this world?</p>
<p>The woman he came to love was that new soul, and this world was where they could live together.</p>
