            <p><strong>Chapter 343</strong></p>
<p>It was that moment.</p>
<p>The sensation of magic that had naturally flowed through his body was no longer there. It wasn’t magic exhaustion.</p>
<p>He had only experienced the overwhelming sense of powerlessness, from toe to head, only once in his lifetime.</p>
<p>He saw Dalia’s eyes aimed towards the sky and, even without feeling it, knew from the horrifying and repulsive smell alone.</p>
<p>The same magic circle they had seen in the north was drawn in the sky.</p>
<p>Dalia, looking at the sky, blinking nervously.</p>
<p>A purple circle enveloped her.</p>
<p>He couldn’t feel or detect what it was, but he could guess just from Dalia’s expression.</p>
<p>This couldn’t be happening.</p>
<p>With all his strength, as he extended his arm, blood gushed out as if his insides were being twisted.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stop his face from contorting with despair.</p>
<p>The moment their eyes met, Dalia conjured up her bright smile as if it were the last time she would ever show it, a lovely smile that she always wore whether joking, joyful, or whispering words of love.</p>
<p>Though the words didn’t escape her lips, it was clear to him as her smile faded away.</p>
<p>“Dalia—-!”</p>
<p>But he couldn’t reach her. He didn’t even manage to grasp her; just barely touched her.</p>
<p>“Ahaha! Haha, ahaha, haha!”</p>
<p>The sound of laughter rang out.</p>
<p>His hand trembled violently, grasping at nothing. The laughter, almost sinister, mocked him relentlessly. He forced his chin up with effort and turned his head.</p>
<p>Exchetra laughed with indescribable joy and happiness. As if she had longed for this moment.</p>
<p>His body felt heavy. Kaichen opened his trembling fist. This feeling… it was a sense of helplessness he had felt before.</p>
<p>His heavy head and body sank, screams erupted, and his movements were chaotic. He coughed violently, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Even with efforts to protect himself from such a height, there was no way he could escape unharmed.</p>
<p>With magic rendered useless, all the barriers protecting his body vanished. The unfamiliar air felt stale, and his skin prickled with tension.</p>
<p>Breathing became difficult.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>‘Dalia? Why couldn’t I reach her? I… what have I done?’</p>
<p>‘I will fight with the Princess, so you must never go near her.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>‘Because it’s dangerous. If you get hurt, I won’t be able to concentrate.’</p>
<p>‘Master, you said you’d sacrifice yourself…’</p>
<p>‘It’s not certain, but that’s not an option I can choose. So, I intend to find another way.’</p>
<p>‘No, I don’t want to. We can stop the blue dragon from being summoned.’</p>
<p>‘If she does summon the blue dragon, I’ll ask Julius to plead with him to bring me back.</p>
<p>‘… What if you won’t come back?’</p>
<p>‘I’ll be back.’</p>
<p>‘What if the Princess tries to use you as a hostage for a deal? What if the blue dragon wants you?’</p>
<p>‘Then I will ask the blue dragon for a favor.’</p>
<p>‘It’s all just possibilities. Master… I can’t. I don’t want to.’</p>
<p>‘Dalia.’</p>
<p>‘Master, why are you like this? Why do you decide everything on your own?’</p>
<p>‘Because I will be with you. I have no intention of dying, I promise.’</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>‘We have to live in the willow tree house together. I will never die before then.’</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Dalia.”</p>
<p>‘… Even after surviving, you can’t die.’</p>
<p>‘I will never die before you.’</p>
<p>He made a promise.</p>
<p>However, it was a promise that Kaichen himself would not die. Nothing in that promise said Dalia would not disappear from his presence first.</p>
<p>Why? Why did he think that?</p>
<p>Why was he so sure that Dalia would stay there forever?</p>
<p>He blinked his eyes slowly and clenched his outstretched hand, but nothing changed He was still empty-handed.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be attributed to carelessness. He had made countless assumptions. He had anticipated a situation where he couldn’t use magic initially.</p>
<p>But the idea of Dalia disappearing wasn’t within the realm of possibilities.</p>
<p>He hadn’t anticipated Dalia being the target of Exchetra. It was the one thing missing from his countless assumptions.</p>
<p>Why, why hadn’t he thought of that? Why did he think that only Dalia would be okay?</p>
<p>“Oh, my God, this is so exciting! What’s with that expression? Sad? Tortured? Huh? Tell me, what are you feeling? Tell me quickly!”</p>
<p>Her doll-like blue eyes, which could hold nothing else, held ecstatic pleasure. It was the first time he had ever seen Exchetra’s true emotions.</p>
<p>At the same time, Kaichen felt the weight of the magic pressing him down disappear The magic circle had also worked on Exchetra, and there was no terrible stench from her.</p>
<p>It made him realize how she had been hiding her powers all this time. The magic circle that banned magic had been perfected long ago.</p>
<p>They had only experimented with expanding its influence in the northern Hoiore; they hadn’t experimented with magic itself.</p>
<p>“Ah, haha, ahahaha! This is the best! Wasn’t it worth the wait? Desperate? Are you despairing? How does it feel to lose the person you love right before your eyes? What are you thinking now? Huh? Tell me, tell me. Hehe… Kyaahaha! Show me more. Want to cry? I like it when you scream, too!”</p>
<p>The grim expression, the sparkling eyes, and the unbridled excitement as she exhaled hot breath.</p>
<p>Exchetra was rejoicing like a child.</p>
<p>It seemed as if she didn’t care about whatever came next.</p>
<p>She was insane. This woman had been crazy from the beginning.</p>
<p>She had played him from start to finish and never won.</p>
<p>The realization hit him like a ton of bricks.</p>
<p>“Kaichen!”</p>
<p>Julius came running, his sword dripping with blood.</p>
<p>Behind him, Damian and Duran rushed forward, pointing their blades at Exchetra.</p>
<p>Exchetra showed no fear and laughed incessantly. She hugged herself, pointed at Kaichen, and laughed maniacally.</p>
