            <p><strong>Chapter 136</strong></p>
<p>It was like that today as well. He saw so many men looking at her as she walked down the street. Her smile and her enthusiasm caught the eye of men and women alike. Whenever he saw someone staring at her longingly, he gritted his teeth and hid her without her noticing. Then continued when he was sure they were gone. He found his own behavior ridiculous especially since he himself was infested with the dirtiest and ugliest desires.</p>
<p>While suppressing that l*st, he responded to the voice calling him ‘Teacher’. He wanted her to call him over and over again. He wished that she would continue to seek and need him like that. He wanted to kiss the plump, soft lips that brushed his fingertips when he wiped the breadcrumbs from her lips. He looked at her with desire in his heart.</p>
<p>His desires did not know any end and only became darker and darker as time passed. No matter how difficult each day was for him, he didn’t want to be separated from her. She didn’t know how obsessed he was with her.</p>
<p>“Teacher?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Dessert has arrived. Hurry up and eat, it won’t taste good when it’s cold.” Dalia even held up her fork to Kaichen.</p>
<p>Kaichen now knows that Dalia doesn’t like sweets very much. She grasped his taste and made sweet desserts every time, but he noticed that she rarely touched them. She just watched him eat with a big smile. He swallowed a laugh and picked up his fork.</p>
<p>A loud voice came from the entrance. “I said I want the seat with the best view! I can pay you, so why are you holding me back?”</p>
<p>“I am sorry, Miss. All tables with a view are already booked. There are simply no seats available. I am afraid you will need to wait—”</p>
<p>“Do you even know who I am? Get out of the way!”</p>
<p>“I am sorry.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you double the money, so clear one table as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Kaichen, who hated such commotion, frowned. But Dalia was curiously glancing at the entrance.</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Teacher,” she said half-heartedly without even looking at him. Her attention was focused on the entrance.</p>
<p>“I think I told you not to get distracted while eating.”</p>
<p>“I’m done eating.”</p>
<p>“There’s dessert left.”</p>
<p>“I gave it to you, Teacher. You can have my share.”</p>
<p>“I am not eating it.”</p>
<p>“But you like this sweet.”</p>
<p>“I already said that I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>Only then did her eyes waver from the entrance and focus on him. Her deep black eyes were full of doubt and confusion. Her eyes seemed to question why he was acting like this suddenly. But Kaichen clamped his mouth shut and didn’t say anything. Dalia slowly lifted her fork and took a bite of the dessert. She rested her chin in her hands and looked at him.</p>
<p>“You aren’t eating it because it’s not very sweet, right?”</p>
<p>It was absurd, but he didn’t answer her. She tapped the plate with her fork. “Teacher, you know you’re more like a child than I am,” she began, to Kaichen’s incredulity.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your taste is like that. You are a very picky eater, and you like everything sweet, just like a child. Even now, you are complaining about the food.”</p>
<p>“I’m just aware of what I like and dislike,” he explained.</p>
<p>“Adults can tolerate things they don’t like.”</p>
<p>“Why do I have to tolerate something when I don’t like it?”</p>
<p>“See?”</p>
<p>“If I don’t like something, I don’t have to put up with it, alright?”</p>
<p>Perhaps because his voice was sharp, she looked at him perplexed. She then slammed the table and laughed out loud. “Then, does it matter if someone else gets hurt because Teacher can’t put up with the things he doesn’t like?” she said.</p>
<p>Kaichen frowned. “The point of the conversation is different. There is a difference between expressing what I like clearly and hurting others,” he said.</p>
<p>“How is it different?”</p>
<p>“Asserting your opinion while hurting or bothering others in the process is childish. It’s like a child having a tantrum.”</p>
<p>“Ah, then you can clearly express what you like, but you are an ‘adult’, so you try to make sure you don’t trouble or hurt others in the process.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Kaichen looked at her questioningly.</p>
<p>The corners of her lips curled up into a smile. “Then, as an adult, bothering others and continuing to argue would be very impudent. What a shame!” said Dalia so loudly that everybody could hear it even from across the room.</p>
<p>“What?!” As if she knew it was meant for her, a sharp voice responded from the entrance.</p>
<p>Kaichen sighed inwardly. It occurred to him that Dalia had involved herself in a fight. He had thought she was blabbering, but she had meant it for the noblewoman who was making a fuss.</p>
<p>Although it seemed that she doesn’t normally care at all about other people’s affairs, Dalia always stepped forward in these kinds of situations. In the past two years, the same had happened countless times in Acrab. It happened so often that people gossiped about it. Rumors were that since she had stopped drinking and gambling, she now let off steam by picking unnecessary fights.</p>
