            <h3><strong>Chapter 314</strong></h3>
<p>Tea was prepared for the Emperor of Suran. Although not a favorite in the Suran Empire, Yanghwa mentioned that her big brother liked it. There were also three-tiered trays full of sweet desserts that Yanghwa liked.</p>
<p>I served Yanghwa’s favorite cake on a plate and pushed Kaichen’s favorite dessert before him. Although Kaichen’s eyebrows twitched slightly, he did not refuse.</p>
<p>As Jungyeonhae sipped his tea with a calm smile, he finally spoke up. “You said you want to use Yanghwa.”</p>
<p>“Ye-yes?”</p>
<p>I almost spat out the tea. It was a close call, but I managed not to embarrass myself in front of the Emperor of a neighboring country.</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>Kaichen clicked his tongue and took the tea from my hand. After setting it down, he pulled out a handkerchief and carefully dabbed at my lips. There was nothing more to hide since we welcomed the guests together, so I gladly accepted his touch.</p>
<p>I laughed awkwardly and looked at Jungyeonhae with a reassuring smile.</p>
<p>“To be precise, I did not want to use the princess, but I wanted to receive help using her position in the Suran Empire.”</p>
<p>“The princess’s help… are you the Countess of Kalhai?”</p>
<p>“There is no greater than if we can establish relations with the Suran Empire.”</p>
<p>“Establish relations…… with a country on the eastern continent across the sea?”</p>
<p>“Because we are ignorant of what they do. And for the first time, a delegation of envoys came from Suran.”</p>
<p>I smiled briefly as Jungyeonhae’s hand holding the teacup twitched. It was the kind of smile that Julius had said was a little off-putting. The emperor of Suran looked at me as if figuring out what I was up to.</p>
<p>“As I heard… It’s interesting.”</p>
<p>I wondered what story he had heard and from whom, but I didn’t ask. Yanghwa and Julius were the only culprits I could think of.</p>
<p>Jungyeonhae looked at Yanghwa eating the cake with cream on her lips. His expression softened as if he remembered something.</p>
<p>“Although I don’t like it… Yanghwa has received some help, so I will lend you my imperial status as needed in the future.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s…”</p>
<p>I hesitated momentarily whether it was fine to mention the land connected at the eastern end of Acrab. My mind was full of thoughts about Exchetra, and I was an outsider, even more in political matters. I couldn’t speak hastily.</p>
<p>I trust Yanghwa, but I knew little about Jungyeonhae, so it was better not to talk about significant matters.</p>
<p>And the fact that he was lending the position of the Imperial family, not the position of the Imperial Princess, seemed like he wanted to repay the favor but didn’t feel like helping too much.</p>
<p><em>‘I can’t let such a valuable connection slip away so easily.’</em></p>
<p>Yanghwa readily agreed to let me use her. I had her permission.</p>
<p>“It was a big deal. The Imperial Princess was in grave danger… Even if we met by  coincidence, I can only imagine how things would have turned out if I hadn’t found her.”</p>
<p>Yanhwa, who had been quietly eating her cake, lifted her hand to cup her cheek and nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right! It would have been serious if I hadn’t met Dalia. She was the only one who could have cured me.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. It was a plot against me. But it turned out to be a fortunate encounter for me and the Imperial Princess.”</p>
<p>Yanghwa’s eyes were wistful as she reminisced. She stared off into space for a moment before pursing her lips and nodding heavily.</p>
<p>“Dalia is my savior. She was there for me when I was only filled with fear.”</p>
<p>I gently smiled at Yanghwa. I served her a new cake, urging her to eat more.</p>
<p>“But still, aren’t we fortunate? That we were able to find your precious youngest one safely. Um… so, in the future, as needed… what was it?”</p>
<p>I smoked, and Jungyeonhae’s expression stiffened for the first time. Seeing his stern face, I couldn’t help but think that he might not be just an emperor. His sudden change in expression created such pressure that I had to swallow.</p>
<p>“Ha, this is really interesting.”</p>
<p>He smirked. Even though his words were muttered, they were audible. He had no intention of hiding anything.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re expecting, but… if it’s interesting, then… fine.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I will use my authority as the Emperor of Suran to grant you whatever you wish, as long as it does not harm the Empire.”</p>
<p>It was a dignified statement. In the face of such regalness, I realized I had stepped overboard. Although cold sweat ran down my spine, I continued to smile as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“It’s not anything big and won’t harm the Suran Empire either, so please rest assured.”</p>
