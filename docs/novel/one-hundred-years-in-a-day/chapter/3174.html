            <h3>Chapter 350</h3>
<p>Maybe it was just a wild dream.</p>
<p>As I blinked my damp eyes absentmindedly, I felt the grip of a warm hand tighten. I turned my head and saw Kaichen, whose eyes were wetter than mine, already awake and looking at me.</p>
<p>I slowly turned my body and hugged him.</p>
<p>What does it matter what happened to the blue dragon in the myth? The man in front of me, looking at me with anxious and tearful eyes, is more important.</p>
<p>From his wretched appearance, I could easily tell how much pain and suffering he had endured over the past six months after losing me in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>The usually composed Kaichen had cried in the crowded square, which said it all.</p>
<p>“I thought it was a dream,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m real.”</p>
<p>“…I knew it because your hand was cold.”</p>
<p>When I squeezed his hand, Kaichen lowered his sunken eyes. “In my dreams… you were crying out for me to come and save you, so I couldn’t sleep,” he murmured.</p>
<p>“When that happens, just tell yourself you’ll definitely come to save me,” I replied.</p>
<p>“I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to.”</p>
<p>“Were you anxious?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Looking at his gaunt face, he clearly hadn’t been eating properly. I felt any words I said would be useless. I could vividly picture him unable to eat or sleep, trembling with anxiety because of his helplessness.</p>
<p>“I’m here now,” I said to him softly.</p>
<p>“You are.”</p>
<p>“It’s not good for just one person to struggle alone.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I should save you too, Master.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“What’s the point of having a capable student if they are just useless?”</p>
<p>Kaichen weakly laughed. The anxiety in his eyes faded a little. “You’ve already saved me countless times,” he said.</p>
<p>“This is the first time.”</p>
<p>“… When you came to my side—you saved my entire life.”</p>
<p>My hand twitched at his words.</p>
<p>His gaze dripped with affection, and he spoke cheesy words without hesitation. This wounded man was earnestly expressing his feelings to avoid being hurt again.</p>
<p>His earlobes were obviously turning red. It made my heart tickle.</p>
<p>“I guess there’s no choice. I’ll have to stay with you forever.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Anything you want.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kaichen gently smiled and pulled me by the waist. Although he looked weak, his arms holding me were still strong.</p>
<p>He whispered softly as I nestled against his chest and wrapped my arms around his back.</p>
<p>“Let’s do anything, Dalia.”</p>
<p>“… Master.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>His arms, wrapped around my waist, twitched at my sudden words. Rather, his whole body shuddered. He pulled back slightly, an incredulous expression on his face, before letting out a snort of laughter.</p>
<p>“You really… I can’t ever let my guard down.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Why do you always manage to get one step ahead?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Kaichen let out a rare laugh and tightened his grip around my waist.</p>
<p>The anxiety in his eyes was no longer there. Instead, they were filled with abundant affection and a solid determination, as firm as a vow.</p>
<p>As we locked eyes, he leaned down and kissed me. When his lips, pressed tightly, parted with a smacking sound, he didn’t break our gaze.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I love you, Dalia.”</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>“My Dalia… never leave me again.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really… Stop it, mmph!”</p>
<p>I was about to tell him to stop because I felt like I was going to die of embarrassment, but my words were cut off as he covered my mouth.</p>
<p>His rough and chapped lips touched mine, cutting off anything I wanted to say. It was as if he was determined to plant all his spoken love into me.</p>
<p>I had been waiting for this for so long.</p>
<p>I had bravely and fearfully fought my way through. It had been so hard and painful. I thought I might never feel his warmth again.</p>
<p>I loved this strong yet tender man who whispered his love to me despite his trembling anxiety and fear of not wanting to lose me again.</p>
<p>My heart swelled even more than before.</p>
<p>I had lost, truly. The one who loves first always loses.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to make the first move. People might say there’s no winning or losing in love, but I never wanted to win against this man, so I had no choice but to lose.</p>
<p>What’s the use of winning against such a lovely man?</p>
<p>If I’m satisfied and happy, that’s enough.</p>
<p>If, at the moment of death, I can say that a hundred years passed like a day and it was a truly satisfying life, that’s enough.</p>
<p>I was so happy that life seemed to pass like a blur. But it feels like I could live even longer.</p>
<p>“Master, even cats are better off as couples, right?”</p>
<p>Kaichen smiled as I pressed my lips against his. He bit my lower lip gently.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Though it wasn’t exactly how I had planned after being reincarnated into this world, I think I’ve wrapped things up peacefully.</p>
<p>I had never managed to defeat Exchetra. I was weak and not the protagonist. I was just an ordinary supporting character, but at least I was determined not to give up on the one I loved.</p>
<p>So what if I couldn’t win?</p>
<p>At least no one was sacrificed.</p>
<p>Exchetra’s plan succeeded, but it wasn’t the ending she desired. She achieved what she wanted, but I also achieved what I desired. So, it wasn’t a complete defeat.</p>
<p>I can’t laugh and talk about winning, but I don’t need to shed tears over losing either.</p>
<p>This is enough. I wanted to become a monster to defeat a monster, but it wasn’t possible. Humans, after all, remain human.</p>
<p>If I had become a monster, someone else would have had to become a monster to defeat me. The cycle of evil would endlessly repeat that way.</p>
<p>I didn’t become a monster, nor did I defeat one, but I succeeded in protecting my loved ones from the monster, which makes me just an ordinary person.</p>
<p>The story is over.</p>
<p>The moment checkmate was declared, Exchetra’s game was over, but the King did not fall.</p>
<p>The King was not alone. There was a Queen who protected it, along with Bishops and Knights.</p>
<p>Because I was not alone, I didn’t taste complete ‘defeat.’</p>
<p>Humans rise again despite setbacks and despair. Because they see the beauty of the world, they walk a different path from monsters.</p>
<p>Because I didn’t lose hope, I was able to save Kaichen.</p>
<p>During that long century, when the clear sky split open and the rain poured down—the single ray of light warmly embraced my lonely, desolate self with its brilliant, beautiful, golden glow.</p>
<p>How could I not love it?</p>
<p>“Master.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Do you know how long I waited for you?”</p>
<p>I loved him from the moment we first met.</p>
<p>I could confidently say I came to this world to love him because he took everything from me at first sight.</p>
<p>I don’t feel regret. I only wish I could give more.</p>
<p>Kaichen gently stroked my cheek as he remembered the words I spoke were from our first meeting.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m sorry for making you wait.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’ll love you as much as I made you wait.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“In fact, I plan to love you even more.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really… What is that? How long do you plan us to live?”</p>
<p>As I pouted my lips in the heat of the moment, his pleasant voice chuckled softly. Despite my embarrassment, I blushed and laughed along with him.</p>
<p>“I want to tell the Dalia, who I ignored during our first meeting in that rainy Acrab—that now, Dalia is loved so much that the lonely century was worth it.”</p>
