            <p><strong>Chapter 105</strong></p>
<p>“Why do you always think like that?” said Kaichen, chuckling.</p>
<p>“Because the High Bank is a place of secrecy and strict confidentiality with very meticulous security! And if he is giving me this key to the safe kept in that bank, I figured it might be his slush fund.”</p>
<p>“I am amazed at you,” he said, trying to hold back his smile. “It’s funny you think Julius is someone who would hoard money and raise a slush fund. Does he come off as such a person to you?”</p>
<p>“It’s… not that. I didn’t mean it that way but… any human being would have something like that for emergencies if they could afford it. I thought maybe….” My words slowly tapered away when I saw Kaichen smiling so openly without a hindrance.</p>
<p>“Well, anything is possible,” I said finally.</p>
<p>Kaichen seemed to be enjoying this. He looked at me with that smile on his face as though I was the most amusing thing he had found in this world.</p>
<p>“Are you worried that you might accidentally get your hands on the Crown Prince’s slush fund and use it all?”</p>
<p>“Obviously!” I said. “I know that the Crown Prince isn’t that kind of person but as I said anything is possible, Besides, I feel uncomfortable using other people’s money…”</p>
<p>I had debts all over the place. I had debts I needed to repay in Acrab. I also have debts to repay to the count of the neighbouring city. I thought that selling my assets would have been enough to pay my debts but…</p>
<p>In order for the Acrab merchants to trade, they had to pass through the neighbouring territories. Until now, the passage had been free of charge without any taxation or fees. But the neighbouring count had reiterated that all of it had been on credit. I had wanted to let loose a lot of swear words but figured that it wouldn’t do any good for my image. Instead, I had asked them to show me proof of such an agreement since my father was dead, I couldn’t confirm it with him. I knew that the neighbouring count was just making this thing up to trick Acrab while it was in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I couldn’t go into more debt. I couldn’t use money from Julius’ ‘slush fund’ or whatever it was. I didn’t know what terms and conditions would come with it. I would never be able to repay it.</p>
<p>“Are you going to refuse it even if I say you earned it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what His Highness wants from me but I am still much burdened by my other debts. I don’t think I will be able to pay it back. So, no. I can’t take this money.”</p>
<p>“You could take it as compensation for the damage done by the empire on your city.”</p>
<p>“Acrab suffered from the damage done by Momalhaut, but with your help, thankfully, the damage was significantly small. I am rather indebted to you.”</p>
<p>“Momalhaut is an enemy to the empire. Julius is trying to compensate the damage that was done by the enemy to destroy the empire. Acrab is sheltered under the empire, is it not? There is no reason to decline this compensation.”</p>
<p>“Hm,” I said, “Still… I can’t.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. It’s mine, not Julius’.”</p>
<p>“What?!” I looked at Kaichen. He jutted out his chin and gestured towards the envelope containing the key.</p>
<p>“But Teacher!”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to borrow Julius’ money either. God knows he can be endlessly annoying. So, I decided I would lend you mine.”</p>
<p>“But… I can’t become so much more in debt.”</p>
<p>Kaichen raised his eyebrows. “You did say you were indebted to me because I helped save Acrab. What’s the difference in being more indebted?” Kaichen crossed his legs and looked at me arrogantly. I looked at him and then at the key. He kept smiling.</p>
<p>“Take it and pay me back slowly. It’s not like you will be running away. Just pay me back slowly by my side.”</p>
<p>This reminded me of some drama I had watched in my past life where a heroine became indebted to the man and had to live by his side for the rest of her life. I had found such dramas very stupid. But when I was in the same situation, it felt… different. Kaichen was asking me to stay by his side!</p>
<p>I had said I would serve him for the rest of my life if he accepted me as his disciple. My feelings were completely different now. I wanted to be by his side. My face flushed and my heart fluttered.</p>
<p>“I will need a lot of money,” I said.</p>
<p>He nodded. “I know,” he replied, smiling.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of debts to repay.”</p>
<p>“I know that, too.”</p>
<p>“I tried living a frugal life because I didn’t really have any money but I am quite extravagant when I do have money to spend.”</p>
<p>“I expected nothing less.”</p>
<p>“Even if I stay with you for the rest of my life, I may not be able to pay you back.”</p>
<p>Kaichen looked at me with that smile and his eyebrows raised. His eyes looked at me questioningly. I smiled back and pulled out the key from the envelope and held it in my hands. What would it be like to spend the rest of my life with him? Was it better to owe a lot to one person than owe to many?</p>
<p>“I will borrow money while serving as Teacher’s disciple for the rest of my life then…”</p>
<p>You should seize an opportunity when you can. An opportunity to settle my debts. An opportunity to move forward. A chance to be with the person you love for the rest of your life.</p>
