            <h3><strong>Chapter 311</strong></h3>
<p>Even when they weren’t speaking, Dalia asked to make wands together. Even if she didn’t know what it meant.</p>
<p>She was the first to confess her love. It was a confession that Kaichen was sure he would always remember, one that had brought him a fullness of happiness he would never know again. In that a garden of yellow roses.</p>
<p>Like a sprinter, Dalia didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>Even the first time he and Dalia made love, she started it by flirting with him to the point he was dizzy. And just like that, he’d lost the game to her.</p>
<p>The Kalhai Empire was not very gender-blind. It was a meritocracy where you could do anything if you were capable, but as a man, he had never taken the initiative with Dalia. It made him wonder if he should have acted more decisively.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he didn’t like her taking the initiative and bossing him around.</p>
<p>How she rolled her eyes and smiled was sexy enough to make his stomach clench. When she bit her bottom lip out of habit, it made him want to drag her to a deserted place and kiss her blindly.</p>
<p>But Dalia would always be the first to step forward. She would put her arms around him, trapping him. She kissed him wantonly, sat on his lap shamelessly, and giggled at his flustered reactions.</p>
<p>She was adorable.</p>
<p>However, he wanted to propose first, at least. Given the circumstances, he wanted to make sure that when all was said and done, it would be a truly moving proposal that would make her cry with happiness.</p>
<p>Growing up in Magic Tower, he didn’t know much about the world but heard people talk about proposals. He had to get it right.</p>
<p>He wanted to tell her that he envisioned a future where they could spend the rest of their lives together in a willow house, just as she wanted it. To stay by her side until she was that old.</p>
<p>Kaichen gripped her chin and plunged his tongue inside Dalia’s mouth. At his eagerness, she opened her mouth even wider and pressed herself against him.</p>
<p>Searing heat and sweet saliva almost scalded him. Her face, full of bliss, almost threatened to unravel him.</p>
<p>With hooded eyes, he grabbed her waist as her knees began to buckle. He licked her lips ruefully. He glanced down at his lower body, which was pulsing with desire despite his constant feelings of self-doubt.</p>
<p>He had to tell her someday that even one small act could drive someone insane.</p>
<p>“Master…”</p>
<p>Hearing the coquettish voice, Kaichen lightly brushed her cheek.</p>
<p>Her pink cheeks didn’t feel warm, even though they were feverish. Her temperature was unusually low, but he was glad he had a higher body temperature than everyone else. At least he could keep her warm when they were stuck like this.</p>
<p>“I’m reinvigorated each day.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Kaichen leaned down and kissed Dalia’s temple, unable to contain his desire. He listened to the words slide across her lips and kissed the mole under her eye.</p>
<p>Then, her eyes fluttered open. Glittering and hazy. He wanted to forsake the dinner party and lock her somewhere away.</p>
<p>“Master, my feelings for you are growing stronger every day, and I’m worried that it will explode, but I know it won’t. Because love is something you can’t calculate, something you can’t understand…”</p>
<p>Kaichen remained silent, listening.</p>
<p>“I’m honest because I want to let you know a little bit of my heart, and I want you to know this great love is being renewed each day,” she said. “You know what, I want you to look at me. I want you to feel my love and love me this much.”</p>
<p>Dalia’s words slammed into his heart. Kaichen felt his throat close up. His heart beat so fast, and his blood raced like crazy.</p>
<p>“I’m begging for Master’s love like that.”</p>
<p>Kaichen clamped his mouth shut as he felt her hand on his cheek. His clenched jaw was stiff.</p>
<p>How could she dare bring herself to kneel? Not hiding her feelings, her desires.</p>
<p>Dalia lifted the corners of her mouth and smiled. “As terrible as I am, you’re still going to like me, aren’t you?” she asked.</p>
<p>Kaichen couldn’t help but laugh at the impudent question. Where was the begging from moments ago? The corners of her mouth similarly quirked up in amusement, and her dark eyes sparkled as she looked at him.</p>
<p>“Yes, I lost,” he admitted.</p>
<p>Dalia looked at him quizzically. “What?”</p>
<p>“Your question has already been answered.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“So, just do what you want.”</p>
<p>What does it matter if someone goes first? It doesn’t make her any less lovely.</p>
<p>Kaichen sincerely wondered if there was any way he could cancel the dinner with the Emperor of the Suran Empire. It was too sweet to let her go as it was.</p>
<p>“Ahh… I’d rather go straight to bed as it is…”</p>
<p>Dalia dropped from his arms and laughed while on her knees.</p>
<p>“Dalia?”</p>
<p>“Master, I’ll take care of this for you.”</p>
<p><em>What. </em>He frowned at her incomprehensible words, but then he felt a hand unbuckle his pants.</p>
<p>“Dalia!”</p>
<p>“Uhm, yes, Master.”</p>
<p>She blinked and looked up, her face feigning innocence. There was nothing innocent about the way her tongue stuck out and licked her lips or the way she pulled his underwear down to reveal my c0ck.</p>
<p>“Don’t. You don’t have to.”</p>
<p>“I’m doing it because I want to.”</p>
<p>“You do that to me—!”</p>
