            <h3><strong>Chapter 328</strong></h3>
<p>“Yeah, you did, and every time I tell you I’ve quit drinking, you tell me that’s not going to happen… and when I tell you I don’t gamble, you ask me what else I’m going to do…” I said.</p>
<p>Angel looks flustered. “Me, you mean..?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you.”</p>
<p>I saw only a snippet, but it was heartening to see Angel living so earnestly. He was the first person to reach out to me when I was alone.</p>
<p>“Angel, this time, I’m going to Huelin by myself.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“Mimi and you are staying here.”</p>
<p>Angel, who had now completely dropped the sandwich from his hand, asked what that meant.</p>
<p>I hadn’t intended to separate the two of them in the first place, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I shouldn’t have brought them along.</p>
<p>Mimi was once a trauma to me, but now we were close enough. Besides, she has a little brother, Mickey, to protect. Not to mention Angel.</p>
<p>Currently, Huelin is bustling with preparations for the Foundation Festival, which is set to occur once every five years. Before the festival, I had come to Acrab to attend to some business.</p>
<p>In reality, my visit was more about clearing my mind and heart.</p>
<p>Exchetra’s audacious plan had sent chills down my spine, angered me, and cast a shadow over everyone’s lives.</p>
<p>Once Exchetra’s plan became known, the primary concern on everyone’s minds was the timing of its execution. When the remaining conditions could be fulfilled. The day when Exchetra would trace her magic circle across the entire Kalhai Empire using Time Magic.</p>
<p>That was the day.</p>
<p>As we gathered to discuss matters before leaving Huelin, Julius spoke.</p>
<p>“Every five years, there’s a ceremony at the imperial palace altar where we offer a prayer for our nation’s founding. It’s in honor of our ancestors and for the prosperity of the empire…”</p>
<p>“Is there anything special about that?”</p>
<p>“There’s a solar eclipse. The ceremony is held once every five years on the day of the eclipse.”</p>
<p>“What…?! How do you know there’s an eclipse? There’s no observatory or anything here… Damn! Is it magic?!”</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s what they’re after. There’s nothing in this world that can’t be done with magic.”</p>
<p>Weird mythology was irritating enough, but an eclipse that could freeze me to death! Although annoyed, it seemed highly probable that Exetra would do something during the Founding Festival. Momalhout also appeared to be making some strange moves.</p>
<p>Julius was doing his best to limit the crowd at the ceremony, but he could do little since he couldn’t halt it for no apparent reason. It wasn’t a frequent event, occurring only once every five years. The festival was huge, drawing massive crowds to Huelin, not just to witness the remarkable eclipse but also to partake in the grand celebration.</p>
<p>Kaichen sought Hamal’s help, urging him to gather mages from the Tower to protect the citizens of Huelin on the day of the eclipse. They couldn’t prevent it, so their focus was on defense.</p>
<p>Exchetra didn’t even bother to stop Julius, who was running around frantically. This indifference might be because the royal family member performing the founding prayer ceremony was Princess Exchetra herself.</p>
<p>I sighed. “It’s just a little vacation, no big deal,” I told him, snapping out of my thoughts.</p>
<p>“Just like this, out of the blue?”</p>
<p>“Yes, suddenly. I felt like giving myself a vacation.”</p>
<p>“Countess.”</p>
<p>“Angel, just listen to me. If you’re worried about me, you should be.”</p>
<p>Angel seemed to have a lot to say, but I waved my hand in the air. I didn’t want to talk anymore. I had enough time to think about it. I exhaled with a little difficulty, my face tired.</p>
<p>Four days had passed, but instead of becoming more organized, my thoughts were growing more complex. I knew I had to make a decision, but it wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult, really.”</p>
<p>In the end, I knew I was fooling myself. There’s only one answer, so what am I worrying about?</p>
<p>The Founding Festival, a day I had hoped would never come, finally arrived.</p>
<p>After gathering my scattered thoughts and leaving Mimi and Angel behind in Acrab, I had a very busy day preparing for the impending battle. Yet, despite all the hustle and bustle, it felt like nothing more than scared people scrambling around.</p>
<p>Am I being too skeptical? The situation just seemed grim from this side.</p>
<p>Uncertain about what would unfold, Julius hastily sent Yanghwa back to the Suran Empire along with Jungyeonhae. Of course, he also handed Jungyeonhae a bold plan addressed to the emperor of the Suran Empire, expressing his desire to establish formal diplomatic relations in the future.</p>
<p>While Julius wore a smile and insisted on personally delivering it to the emperor, Jungyeonhae’s expression was far from cheerful. He responded, “I will <em>selflessly</em> convey your will to the emperor.”</p>
<p>The word ‘selfless’ seemed to carry a venomous edge, and when Jungyeonhae spoke it, his eyes gleamed with a certain intensity.</p>
