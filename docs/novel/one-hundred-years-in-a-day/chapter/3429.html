            <p><strong>Chapter 94</strong></p>
<p>They might be hired mercenaries or trained Momalhaut forces. Either way it didn’t matter to Kaichen.</p>
<p>“If you value your life, bring her out.” His voice sounded so cold and dangerous that it could have frozen everything around him. Kaichen’s words echoed through the small village. No one moved.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to? I see,” said Kaichen. He had never hated the Momalhuat more than right at that moment. He had long wanted to deal with their leader. They claimed to fight for independence but they always fought dirty. They exploited poor and desperate people and acted rashly outside of the law. Their actions didn’t really indicate that their intentions were righteous. That was why Kaichen hated them so much. He wondered how many of them were actually fighting for independence and how many just wanted to cause trouble. Most wanted the latter, it would seem.</p>
<p>“You also want to die by being the most annoying, don’t you?” Their swords were held out towards Kaichen. They clustered in front of the tall building behind them. Kaichen would feel Dalia’s magic pulsating from there. He also felt the large-scale magic that was put in place to prevent him from entering. It was done well, albeit clumsily. He wanted to get rid of everyone in one fell swoop but Dalia would be inside that building.</p>
<p>Kaichen was annoyed and displeased. The thing that annoyed him the most was that he was unable to check Dalia’s condition right at that moment. Kaichen struck the ground once with his wand.</p>
<p>A thunderous sound accompanied the lighting. It swooped down from the sky and struck his wand and scattered around. The screams didn’t last long. Kaichen took a step forward. He didn’t even glance at the bodies that had been burnt to crisp by the lightning. He had given them a choice.</p>
<p>The closer he got to the building, the more he could feel Dalia’s unstable magic. He also saw an eerie red aura directed towards him. It was the same sinister magic he had felt a long time ago.</p>
<p>Kaichen recalled Antares, when they had been in the same magic tower. Antares hadn’t been into black magic in his young years. He had dark brown hair and gentle eyes. Although, his shaggy bangs had always given him a gloomy look. He had shown promising talent in potion-making. He had been a very determined magician and improved his craft and ascended to the upper floors of the tower.</p>
<p>But his talent was only that. Potion-making was a very difficult field and not much sought after. One had to first learn herbology and medicine to even begin making potions. One also had to learn immense control regarding the magic one used. Antares had mastered those. Once he reached a limit, he had no more steps to take. He had started feeling insecure with other magicians, especially Kaichen. Kaichen had studied every kind of magic. He had been very smart and could absorb new knowledge very fast. He had also dabbled in black magic solely to learn about the craft.</p>
<p>But Antares began studying the dark side of potion-making. Potions that could harm people and never came back from that. It had been a foolish thing to do. He had become corrupted. Kaichen instead had learnt what he wanted to and then left it at that. Kaichen hated the dark and ugly side of the mana that was revealed while learning black magic. He hated the smell of gutter which accompanied anyone indulging in black magic.</p>
<p><em>“Can’t you see it as individuality? I can’t believe the mana smells… it’s something I’ve never heard of.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But it does.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hmm…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Teacher, do you think I am lying?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I know that you don’t lie. However, there is simply no way to prove whether a mana smells. I mean, would you believe something just because someone said it when there was no other way to prove it?”</em></p>
<p>Kaichen was convinced by his teacher’s words. He couldn’t really prove it anyway so it was logical for others to not believe him. He had tried to ignore the smell but it lingered. His nose stung with the small whenever Antares was nearby. That was what he could smell at that moment as he approached the building. A very strong smell of the gutter.</p>
<p>“Kaichen, we meet again,” said Antares, appearing at the entrance. “And as always, you are here to stand in my path.”</p>
<p>“Standing in your path?” Kaichen scoffed. “You don’t even deserve to stand behind me.”</p>
<p>“You <em>arrogant</em> bastard! Do you really think you are a god just because the world supports you?! Just because you have a little bit of shiny talent…”</p>
<p>“A little?” Kaichen continued closing the distance between himself and Antares. “I don’t think I would call my talent ‘little’ if I were you.” Kaichen smirked.</p>
<p>Antares scowled. His face crumbled in disgust. His red eyes flashed and his eerie, reddish mana became stronger. It was a magic that cursed anyone who came into contact but as Kaichen walked towards him, the red mana touching gold became powdered dust and flew away. Each magic was similar. The cursed one that Antares used and the golden one Kaichen used to protect himself from the curse. The only difference was the purpose for which the magics were used. Both required to be fed by enormous amount of mana to stay active.</p>
