            <h3><strong>Chapter 326</strong></h3>
<p>“It’s okay, don’t cry. Alright? Don’t cry….”</p>
<p>Kaichen nervously cupped my cheeks, wiped away the tears, and lightly kissed my forehead. But that doesn’t stop the tears.</p>
<p>His hands, whether stroking my back or cupping my cheek, are so careful and gentle, as if touching fragile glass. It makes my heart ache even more.</p>
<p>How can I not protect a man like this?</p>
<p>I can’t give him up. I can sympathize with the blue dragon being miserably lonely for thousands of years, but I can’t surrender what’s mine.</p>
<p>I don’t want to lose this wonderful man, even if he is the embodiment of a golden dragon meant for a blue dragon.</p>
<p>“Heuk… nghh… Master….”</p>
<p>“Yes, Dalia, I’m here, I’m here.”</p>
<p>“Black…I’m… sorry… ugh… sorry… nggh!”</p>
<p>My words were barely audible through ragged breathing. Kaichen gently kissed my trembling lips, not minding my sudden apology.</p>
<p>I don’t know what’s happening. I try to bite my lip out of habit, but his fingers slip between my lips, gently brushing them before kissing the corner of my eye again.</p>
<p>He understands my feelings right now. Clinging to him is the best I can do at the moment.</p>
<p>I can’t let go.</p>
<p>I know I should let go to protect him, but I also know that Exchetra wants to keep the blue dragon to sacrifice Kaichen.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t Kaichen be safer if he disappeared somewhere? Maybe he could vanish from Exchetra’s sight.</p>
<p>He knows he could, but the words won’t come out. Not because of the blue dragon’s loneliness.</p>
<p>But because I’m lonely. I’m alone without him.</p>
<p>Because I love him.</p>
<p>Because he is my everything.</p>
<p>“Dalia, I’m not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>“… ahh.”</p>
<p>“What are you so afraid of?”</p>
<p>Kaichen would have heard the myth of the blue dragon and known before I did. He’s smart. He knew more about magic than I did.</p>
<p>There’s no way he couldn’t have realized that if he opened a map of the Kalhai Empire and connected the places where time magic happened, it would form an equilateral triangle. Equilateral triangles are the basis for drawing magic circles.</p>
<p>He remained silent because he had already decided to stay by my side and protect Julius.</p>
<p>“I’m not going anywhere without you.”</p>
<p>“Heuk… ugh, sorry, ah… sorry, sorry…”</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>Kaichen gently lifted my head. His were eyes tender and sweet like honey. His eyes, holding the warmth of the sun, curved into a gentle smile.</p>
<p>“We will live together in the willow house.”</p>
<p>“… heuk… ”</p>
<p>“I like black cats.”</p>
<p>My face twisted into a messy sob. Just when I thought things couldn’t get any more difficult.</p>
<p><em>“Master, we must have a cat someday,”</em></p>
<p>I recalled the words we had shared while dreaming about our future together. He must have remembered those words.</p>
<p>Kaichen held me tightly as I sobbed. His comforting touch stroked my hair and patted my back. He whispered in my ear, and I clutched the hem of his shirt, unwilling to let go.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a flower garden in the yard. We could enjoy cool fruit on the patio when the weather is nice. Two cats would be lovely. Building a fence would be a nice touch. What should we plant in our garden?</p>
<p>As Kaichen stroked my back, he whispered plans for our future until I fell asleep from crying.</p>
<p>His words served as a balm, soothing me as he outlined our life together.</p>
<p>My frightened mind, lost in deep darkness, gradually warmed from the inside out, like standing in front of a bright sun. Relief washed over me, and my anxiety melted away.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell if it was my heart or his that was pounding, but the erratic thumping assured me he was by my side and I wasn’t alone.</p>
<p>Gradually, my body warmed as if his warmth was melting into me. My body relaxed and eyes closed, but I held onto him.</p>
<p>“Sweet dreams, my dear Dalia.”</p>
<p>As if by magic, I dreamt of an overwhelming happiness I felt like I could die.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I thought I would wake up to a familiar ceiling and cozy sheets, or else I wouldn’t have had such a sweet dream.</p>
<p>However, upon opening my eyes, I saw something I’d seen many times before: smooth flesh. It didn’t take me long to realize that the brown, firm skin belonged to someone’s chest.</p>
<p>Feeling a bit stuffy and unable to move easily, I blinked repeatedly. I must have passed out in the study, and Kaichen must have carried me to my bedroom.</p>
<p>I quickly opened my eyes, still feeling a bit stiff, and then heard a chuckle overhead. Surprised, I raised my head and locked eyes with Kaichen, who was looking down at me.</p>
<p>“You’re being cute…“</p>
<p>What? Me?</p>
<p>I stared back, and the arm holding me tightly slid up to stroke my hair. An unnecessary rush of embarrassment washed over me as I realized I had slept in Kaichen’s arms. It’s not the first time, but for some reason, I felt so reassured.</p>
<p>“Master, why are you here?”</p>
<p>His voice sounded lower than usual. When I looked at him with bleary eyes, Kaichen answered, still stroking my hair.</p>
<p>“Because you don’t seem to want to be alone.”</p>
<p>“…I didn’t say that…”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t want to be alone.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Nothing to say then.</p>
<p>The truth was, no matter how good a dream I had, waking up alone, staring at a familiar ceiling, would still bring strange thoughts. Waking up unexpectedly in Kaichen’s arms was more relieving than I expected.</p>
