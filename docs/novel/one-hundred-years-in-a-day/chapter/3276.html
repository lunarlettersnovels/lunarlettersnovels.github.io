            <p><strong>Chapter 247</strong></p>
<p>Kaichen was dumbfounded. Dalia was so flustered that she was making no sense. But even so, she was so cute that he couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>“Wh-why are you laughing?! You’re making fun of me! Am I funny?!”</p>
<p>Kaichen tugged at their gripped hands and pulled her towards him. He hugged Dalia tightly, even as she pursed her lips.</p>
<p>“I knew you were going to do something like this… Hng, do you think you can just get away with this?”</p>
<p>Kaichen laughed lowly. “You’re so cute when you’re jealous.”</p>
<p>Dalia’s shoulders stiffened in his arms. She knew that Kaichen was right, and she hated it.</p>
<p>“I got g-goosebumps. Master, I think my fingers are bending because you’re so cheesy.”</p>
<p>“I’ll straighten all your fingers for you, so shall we go to your room?”</p>
<p>Dalia tried to escape from his arms, but Kaichen only hugged her tighter.</p>
<p>“Dalia, I only have you,” he said. “I’ll only look at you, so don’t avoid me anymore.”</p>
<p>Dalia slowly nodded, her face still red.</p>
<p>Kaichen smiled and patted her on the back. “Good girl.”</p>
<p>He glanced out the window and sighed. It was a pity that it was still daytime, but he didn’t care. He wanted Dalia right now. Would Dalia see him as a crazy perv3rt if she read his thoughts?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I didn’t make a deliberate effort to avoid Kaichen for an entire week. It was more like I couldn’t bring myself to face him, feeling ugly and consumed by jealousy over his attention towards Yanghwa and her treatment needs.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I didn’t hold back my complaints. I let my dissatisfaction be known. But as time went on and Kaichen spent more and more time with Yanghwa, I found myself unable to speak up, drowning in anxiety. Mentally, I cursed Yanghwa, but then I caught sight of my reflection in a window and a wave of shame washed over me.</p>
<p>Gosh, I looked hideous.</p>
<p>Yanghwa had suffered at the hands of terrible people and was struggling with an addiction to opium. She genuinely needed help. Meanwhile, my jealousy was just plain silly.</p>
<p><em>‘She avoids people because she can sense their magic.’</em></p>
<p>So, when I thought about it without my jealousy goggles on, I realized why Yanghwa allowed only Kaichen to get close. And did that realization make my behavior even more embarrassing.</p>
<p>A cough escaped me as I recalled my own foolishness.</p>
<p>I sought comfort in Kaichen’s arms, trying to hide my embarrassment, but he saw right through me. He smiled and reassured me, “No need to be jealous anymore.” The atmosphere got a bit awkward, though. But before we could dwell on it, Julius stormed in, as per usual.</p>
<p>Kaichen made this annoyed click with his tongue when he noticed the shiny ring on my finger. He muttered some curse under his breath, like “f!cking b@stard.”</p>
<p>I squinted at him, curious about his reaction, and figured I might as well give the magic communication thing a shot. I activated the seal and connected with Julius. I was met with his scream.</p>
<p>[Why on Earth didn’t you talk things out properly with Kaichen?! Your actions messed everything up!]</p>
<p>Julius went off, but then he saw Kaichen right there, next to me, and he shut up quickly. It was pretty obvious they were keeping something from me.</p>
<p>So, I put two and two together. Kaichen had decided to stop taking care of Yanghwa because I kept avoiding him.</p>
<p>Kaichen, cool as ever, spoke up. “I don’t think you understand who you’re talking to.”</p>
<p>[She’s in a tough spot. Can’t you keep looking after her until we can contact Suran’s emperor?] Julius pleaded, looking at me, not Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking me, Your Highness? I can’t even get near the princess, let alone take care of her,” I responded.</p>
<p>[Because I don’t think Kaichen would say no if you asked.] Julius replied, as if forgetting that Kaichen was standing right there.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s eyebrows furrowed, and he shot a piercing glare at Julius. But the prince didn’t care and kept pleading with me.</p>
<p>[I know any help you can provide will be limited, but please, I’m begging you. If there was any other option, I wouldn’t resort to this. You know me, right?]</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Even Julius, the crown prince himself, was willing to humble himself for Yanghwa. That’s how valuable she was.</p>
<p>Out of all the female leads from the original work that I had encountered, she was the only one, and she was Julius’s ally.</p>
<p>Letting out a soft sigh, I stole a glance at Kaichen and nodded.</p>
<p>“How can I disobey Your Highness’s orders? I made a promise to te Master, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p>[That’s why I appreciate you.] Julius beamed with gratitude.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, you don’t have to appreciate her like that,” Kaichen interrupted, immediately wiping the smile off Julius’s face.</p>
<p>After ending the call with Julius, I listened as Kaichen shared the details of his conversation with Yanghwa. His cold treatment of her sparked a tinge of sympathy within me. I mean, could someone really be that indifferent? But that compassion was tiny, like a speck of ant poop.</p>
<p>“Master, you were cold to her because of me, and for that… I’m hap—no, you went too far.”</p>
<p>My heart felt like it might burst, and I nearly bit my tongue a few times, but I mustered the courage to firmly hold Kaichen’s hand as I spoke.</p>
<p>“Because Master loves me as his partner. And as for Yanghwa… no, I’ll make sure I understand your care for Princess Suran.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be jealous anymore.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t want that.”</p>
