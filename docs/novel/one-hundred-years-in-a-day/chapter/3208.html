            <h3><strong>Chapter 316</strong></h3>
<p>Jungyeonhae casually revealed the tattoos on both arms. There were hieroglyphics and illustrations.</p>
<p>In Suran, the tattoos were passed from Emperor to Emperor. Only the person with the highest status had them. Perhaps to make the ruler of the nation even more striking.</p>
<p>‘Teramedeo’ was the name of the continent Kaichen mentioned in passing at some point. It was unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>The beginning of that continent.</p>
<p>Hearing those extraordinary words, I straightened my already tense back. I suspected that Jungyeonhae’s story was about the hidden secret of this world.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was only the clear blue sky and the vast seas. Life naturally flourished in the pure and clean world.</p>
<p>Creatures were born into the sky and sea that encompassed the world. They had strong, majestic wings to soar through the sky and tough, smooth scales to navigate the seas.</p>
<p>They loved the sky and embraced the sea, marveling at the beauty of the world.</p>
<p>Later, some called them dragons, and others called them wyverns.</p>
<p>The four cherished each other. They spent peaceful days basking in the world’s beauty, occasionally playing pranks, and taking long naps.</p>
<p>One day, the blue-scaled dragon, who immensely loved the sky, said, “I want more people to see the beauty of the world.”</p>
<p>The blue-scaled dragon flew to the sky with a clear smile. In response, the green and red-scaled dragon willingly devoted their bodies to be part of the world. Lying side by side, holding hands, the bodies of the two dragons formed a firm ground that could support the sea.</p>
<p>The blue-scaled dragon marveled at the vast land that filled with the world.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah, it’s beautiful!’</em></p>
<p>The blue-scaled dragon wandered under the sky and on the land that filled the sea</p>
<p>With his admiration, various greenery sprung from the earth and hot flames soared. Changes began to emerge. The blue-scaled dragon removed the clear clouds of the sky and scattered them all over the land. Then, all kinds of furry beasts born from clouds began to run on the land..</p>
<p><em>‘Lovely creatures.’</em></p>
<p>The creatures born from the clouds evolved according to the environment.</p>
<p>With joy, the blue-scaled dragon, once again, roamed the clear sky above the land.</p>
<p>However, the blue-scaled dragon was disappointed by their inability to recognize the beauty of the world and life iitself. The blue-scaled dragon, wandering in the sky and shedding tears, shed his scales and created a delicate life that recognize beauty.</p>
<p>The fallen scales on the ground, enriched by the tears shed by the blue-scaled dragon, gave rise to a “human.” A being that could think and appreciate the world’s beauty, though its fur was not as luxurious.</p>
<p>Watching the newly born human, the blue-scaled dragon stopped shedding tears and rejoiced. However, they were more fragile than other creations. They easily died and became prey for the earlier-born creatures.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah, pitiful children. What should I do with them?’</em></p>
<p>Knowing that even his tears could harm them, the blue-scaled dragon sighed, suppressing his wailing.</p>
<p>Then, the gold-scaled dragon spoke.”I will help them survive so they can feel the world’s beauty.”</p>
<p>Like the other two dragons who dedicated their bodies to creating the land, the gold-scaled dragon spewed out a brilliant light, dissolving into a special mist.</p>
<p>The blue-scaled dragon felt the golden-scaled dragon, which became the atmosphere where a special force could be felt, and he subtly revealed a way for humans to use it.</p>
<p>As the wind blew, humans grew, and the atmosphere with a special force was soon called ‘magic.’</p>
<p>The blue-scaled dragon was pleased, seemingly remembering the gold-scaled dragon.</p>
<p>Humans felt the presence of the blue-scaled dragon protecting them and regarded him as a deity, respecting and praying on a designated day, thanking for the beauty of the world.</p>
<p>The blue-scaled dragon was pleased.</p>
<p>Thus, in honor of the dedication of the two dragons, their names were used to name the land Teramedeo, and on the day of thanksgiving, people were encouraged to express their gratitude to them.</p>
<p>The blue-scaled dragon enjoyed watching humans and was happy about the changes in the world.</p>
<p>However, as the number of humans increased, they began to fight, shedding blood on the beautiful land.</p>
<p>As always, the blue-scaled dragon roamed the sky with tears in his eyes, trying to stop him, but no one heard his voice anymore.</p>
<p>Blood formed a puddle on the bodies of their precious friends, and they used the power that was given to them to kill each other. Eventually, the corpses of humans formed a mountain, and the blue-scaled dragon could not bear the sadness.</p>
<p>The sea flooded, rain poured from the sky, and gusty winds blew.</p>
<p>He felt even more sorry for the people who could no longer hear him and were praying for them to be saved and for his anger to calm down.</p>
<p>But the blue-scaled dragon never felt anger.</p>
<p><em>‘Why do they not understand? Why can’t they hear my wishes?’</em></p>
<p>The blue-scaled dragon was endlessly saddened by the sight of those who used the magic power given by their precious friend to commit slaughter and cast a shadow on the beauty of the world.</p>
<p>After a while, there were few humans left on the earth.</p>
<p>An overwhelming storm blocked the hands of the two dragons that had joined, and the surviving humans were divided into two sides.</p>
<p>It was a pity that they were separated, but no one could hear him anymore. The blue-scaled dragon roamed the sky, shedding its last drop of tears and flying off to a distant place where no one could find it.</p>
<p>He said that one day, if someone heard his voice, he would share the world’s beauty.</p>
<p>Like his friends, the three dragons before him, he would sacrifice his body and leave a final gift to the world.</p>
