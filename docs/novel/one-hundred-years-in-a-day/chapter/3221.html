            <h3><strong>Chapter 303</strong></h3>
<p>I could feel life in my legs return a little as I unconsciously used magic on the brink of death.</p>
<p>It seemed like I had turned back the time before my legs were broken. I was able to turn back time on a specific area.</p>
<p>Was that even possible? After realizing it, I cautiously attempted it again, but there was no result.</p>
<p>Perhaps, driven by the desire to live, I had instinctively used such magic.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, my ruined legs could recover from their extreme injuries with Hamal’s healing magic.</p>
<p>“Well, so I think. Master mentioned it before, right? Since I’ve accumulated Time Magic while trapped inside Acrab, I would be more talented in Time Magic than anyone else. That’s the truth.”</p>
<p>“…. Time Magic is forbidden from being used and studied.”</p>
<p>“I know. But I can’t die protecting that…” I murmured, my lips puckering into a pout, “I don’t want to die…”</p>
<p>“Well done,” said Kacihen. He sighed briefly and stroked my head.</p>
<p>Speaking confidently about using forbidden magic before the Crown Prince felt wrong, but Julius didn’t reprimand me.</p>
<p>“What does it mean to have mastered Time Magic?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It means I can infuse Time Magic into my mana.”</p>
<p>It didn’t flow out as naturally as it did when I used it unconsciously. Still, because my magic power was unique, putting Time Magic into ordinary magic wasn’t challenging.</p>
<p>“It’s not that different from the outside,  but Time Magic can’t be easily undone.”</p>
<p>“Cannot be undone?”</p>
<p>“For example, if I attack and get injured, regular healing magic won’t be able to treat it.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details, but… it looks like that. Either the recovery is slow, or it doesn’t happen.”</p>
<p>Kaichen frowned, his lips pursed as if lost in thought.</p>
<p>“You can’t use travel or communication magic if you’re in a place attacked by Time Magic.”</p>
<p>“Attacked by magic?”</p>
<p>“If attacked by my mana”</p>
<p>It’s my mana, not the magic itself.</p>
<p>I witnessed those who attempted to use teleportation magic to escape from me meet a futile end. Despite their frantic efforts, they couldn’t move fast enough, and communication spells were useless.</p>
<p>“It seems to be the nature of mana. Time Magic is considered one of the most forbidden, and there’s nothing known about it… It won’t be easy to figure out the reason.”</p>
<p>“My mana had traces of Time Magic previously, but it’s different from mana from Time Magic itself. I thought it had Time Magic properties because I was trapped under the Time Magic in Acrab,” I explained.  “Things like this never happened before. So honestly… I don’t even know how it ended up like this.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s something unconscious? I thought there was nothing more to investigate about becoming a medium…  Because you were the only one who survived after being affected by Time Magic. “It could be that your entire body was affected, excluding your mana.”</p>
<p>It was a plausible statement. Was the original Dalia like this? The question naturally followed.</p>
<p>For some reason, it felt like she wasn’t. As if Kaichen was thinking the same thing, he pressed his temples, raised his head, and looked at Julius.</p>
<p>“It’s probably better to conduct proper research.”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous. It’s magic that’s not only prohibited in the empire but is also taboo on the continent. They already demand an explanation for why Time Magic has manifested three times in our empire…”</p>
<p>Julius sighed as if troubled. The dark circles under his eyes seemed to deepen.</p>
<p>I tilted my head. “Who’s demanding an explanation?” I asked.</p>
<p>If it’s the Kalhai Empire, demanding an explanation for anything related to forbidden Time Magic on the continent was challenging. Apart from Suran, every kingdom, except a few small ones and free nations, had been subjugated by the Kalhai Empire.</p>
<p>No nation on the continent had enough audacity to confidently demand an explanation from the Kalhai Empire.</p>
<p>“It’s Suran.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Julius sighed, leaning back on the sofa. Suppressing fatigue, he pressed his eyes as if holding back exhaustion.</p>
<p>“A messenger from Suran arrived while you were asleep. After learning about what happened in Turbeau, they formally requested an explanation for the three incidents of Time Magic within the Empire.”</p>
<p>How did Julius, laden with sadness, handle the Suran messenger?</p>
<p>I could understand why Yanghwa was beside Julius, holding his hand while he was struggling.</p>
<p>The two were destined to be together one way or another.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, many things happened while I was asleep. The summary I heard from Yanghwa was simply not enough.</p>
<p>“What? Who’s coming as a messenger from the Suran Empire?”</p>
<p>My mouth fell open involuntarily.</p>
<p>Even if it was the first formal messenger from Suran, how could they confidently request an explanation like that? But upon hearing the envoy’s name, I nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>“The Emperor… His Majesty came personally?!” I quickly swallowed my dry saliva and shook my head.</p>
<p>Was that even possible? Would the Emperor of a country come as a messenger? Moreover, to a country he had not visited often and had just established diplomatic relations with?</p>
