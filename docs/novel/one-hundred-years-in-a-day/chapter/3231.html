            <h3><strong>Chapter 293</strong></h3>
<p>My heart has already burned to ashes, so why does hurt so much? The continuous agony left me in a haze.</p>
<p>I remembered waiting for a hundred years in Acrab. How I imagined Kaichen when I closed my eyes, eagerly awaiting for him, was completely different from the image of him.</p>
<p>I waited for him, with vague expectations of what he would look like.</p>
<p>In the end, the dreamified version was different from the real person. I realized that I was waiting for the real Kaichen, not the Great Mage Kaichen, whom I loved.</p>
<p>It was causing the piercing pain in my heart.</p>
<p>Why was that? I was waiting for him like Acrab, hoping to be saved from danger, yet why did my heart ache like this?</p>
<p>Is the choice I’ve made now the right one? Then, what should I do?</p>
<p><em>‘It’s your destiny, isn’t it? You have to choose.’</em></p>
<p>It was a terrible answer. Nevertheless, I listented to it.</p>
<p><em>‘Are you just going to keep waiting?’</em></p>
<p>I laughed. I heard someone mumbling something in response to my laughter.</p>
<p>Having experienced Kaichen’s death countless times in my dreams, I watched his death without being able to lift a finger every time.</p>
<p>I could only cry endlessly, knowing that I could do nothing to save the one I loved, my everything.</p>
<p><em>“The fate of supporting roles may change, but the fate of the protagonist remains unchanged.”</em></p>
<p>It was annoying, but at this moment, I remembered what the woman said.</p>
<p>I vaguely knew it as well. That’s why I could naturally imagine the ending where Julius became the Emperor where Kaichen dies. I remembered what I had decided to do: to help Julius become emperor to the end of this novel.</p>
<p>By making that decision, the fate of ‘Dalia Alshine’ changed.</p>
<p>A mere supporting role, ‘Dalia,’ became the Great Mage’s disciple, became friends with the main character, the Crown Prince, and became connected with the female protagonist.</p>
<p>I don’t like the idea of conforming to fate.</p>
<p>In my previous life, I was on the side that believed, ‘I must pioneer my destiny.’ I often heard sayings like ‘it’s unfortunate to be born poor’ while drinking in a social gathering.</p>
<p><em>‘Isn’t it enough to make a decent living and enjoy what you want to do?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘If you’re born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you can do whatever you want. You don’t have to grovel to a company boss.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Wouldn’t it be boring to be able to do anything? Isn’t the idea of having a predetermined destiny from birth… mundane? It would be nice to have some fun.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘You’re too carefree that it’s a problem. You said you were sexually harassed not long ago, right? When you were cursing and throwing a fit.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Hahaha! That jerk got fired from the company. I reported him.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘What? He was your boss!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘It happened once or twice. When the lunatic wouldn’t stop, I thought, why should I bother with someone’s temper? These days, there are plenty of mini recording devices and cameras available, so it’s easy.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…Aren’t you in an awkward position at your company?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Do I need to feel awkward? They’re the ones who didn’t listen to the warning. I don’t care about what people around me say.</em>’</p>
<p><em>‘Ah~ Why is my fate so difficult? If I were born with a personality like yours, I’d at least try to change my fate.’</em></p>
<p>Recalling a conversation with a friend who had always sung about wanting to be born rich, I bit my tongue.</p>
<p>Yes, I did have such a personality.</p>
<p>I hoped to enjoy the present while not conforming to fate and lived that way. I was receiving a decent salary for my age, and I was in an environment where I could enjoy my leisure time. I also received recognition for using my abilities to the fullest.</p>
<p>However, after my sudden death, when I transmigrated into the characters of a novel I was reading, I spent a long time alone. During that time,I promised myself that I would abandon the story and live a comfortable lif.</p>
<p>But was that really the conclusion I had in mind?</p>
<p>Could it be that I unconsciously adapted to become Dalia Alshine, a character in the novel, to live as a character in this world?  Was the Opahdok poison in Dalia’s body affecting my soul as well?</p>
<p>The more questions I asked, the more I couldn’t help but laugh. I heard men talking as they were torturing me with a droning noise from above.</p>
<p>I had been wrong from the start. Just because the protagonist of this novel, Julius, became the emperor didn’t mean my life would be complete.</p>
<p>I had already become ‘Dalia,’ and the fate originally intended for the real ‘Dalia’ was already twisted.</p>
<p>The person who holds Kaichen dear and is most afraid of him dying is me, even though I am Dahlia Alshine. I finally realized.</p>
<p><em>‘I feel so terrible.’</em></p>
<p>Muttering a bitter curse under my breath, I slowly raised my eyelids. I stared blankly at the two men who looked at me as if I was crazy.</p>
<p>I should have done it my way from the beginning. Why was I following the flow of the novel?</p>
<p>My decision was wrong from the beginning.</p>
<p>There was no need to hide.</p>
<p>There was no need for me to silently submit to this world that Exchetra had been working behind the scenes and trying to destroy.</p>
