            <p><strong>Chapter 118</strong></p>
<p>“Asta, come here.” Asta silently got up from his seat. Akshetra stroked his cheek. His skin was so soft it was hard to believe it belonged to a man. Her fingertips lowered to his neck.</p>
<p>“Mm.” It felt like her lower body was already quivering. She stuck out her tongue and moistened her lips. She placed her hands on the nape of his neck. He hugged her without a word.</p>
<p>Contrary to how soft and pretty his face was, the body that embraced her was broad and muscular. She wrapped her arms around his neck and let out a hot breath. She bit his earlobe gently. Her body trembled. Akshetra lowered her head and whispered in his ear. “Let’s go to bed.”</p>
<p>Her voice did not hide her passion. Even though it was midday and the sun was high up in the sky dazzling her colorful garden, she did not care. She wanted him. Asta opened the door connected to the study and carried her inside. There was only one large bed in that antechamber.</p>
<p>It was placed there so one could rest if one was tired from working in the study all night. But Akshetra had another use for it.</p>
<p>“Mm….” Akshetra teased his neck. She did not hide her arousal. Laying down on the bed, she watched Asta breathing raggedly. She pulled him and he leaned over her without hesitation. Their hot lips met. Asta expressionlessly followed her guidance. His soft tongue slid between her hastily opened lips.</p>
<p>“Haah.” His thing was already touching her thigh and it was becoming hard. Generally, Asta was unyielding and unaffected by anything but when Akshetra initiated this, his defenses fell apart. She quite liked that. His tongue, which was familiar to her mouth, teased the roof of her mouth.</p>
<p>His soft, moist tongue made her impatient. Asta rolled his tongue and rubbed the tip of her lips. Akshetra gladly obliged. As they kissed, he shuddered and lifted the hem of her dress.</p>
<p>“Haah.” She exhaled through her slightly opened lips. Asta pecked and sucked on her lips and lifted her slightly. He looked at her questioningly as though asking for permission. His lips twitched. He was falling apart. Akshetra smiled.</p>
<p>“Just do it,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“I am sorry.” Asta always apologized for no reason at all whenever they were in the middle of something like this. His lips came down rougher than before. His tongue was frantic inside her mouth, going in and out. Akshetra stroked his head as if praising him for the act.</p>
<p>His kiss became deep and hurried. His tongue went wild inside her mouth. His movements became chaotic. He raised the hem of her dress up to her pelvis and pulled off her underwear. The hand that caressed the inside of her thigh made her gasp.</p>
<p>“Mm… ahh.” With one of his hands tightly clasping her waist to him, Akshetra spread her legs wide apart. Asta moved closer but his lips still coveted her mouth. His hand on her inner thigh moved closer to her sensitive parts now that her legs were open.</p>
<p>“Ahh!” He played with her mouth and sucked at her lips. Their breathing came in gasps. His fingers which stroked her thigh suddenly plunged inside her.</p>
<p>“Hng… ahh!” Akshetra m*aned. Asta’s breath was hot on her skin. His eyes were red. His hands sent her reeling. He moved his fingers inside her as he chewed on her lips softly, careful not to hurt her.</p>
<p>His finger stroked her between her legs and trailed to her enlarged cl*t. Akshetra shuddered and held him close as he squeezed and rubbed at her most sensitive part. His fingers moved more vigorously and the heat in her body rose to an extreme. He slid another finger inside her, digging deeper.</p>
<p>“Uggghh! Ahhh!” Her legs trembled. She couldn’t withhold her m*ans any longer. Asta leaned over her and buried his face on the nape of her neck. His arms clasped her waist tightly against him. His fingers inside her opened her up. Her juice flowed out.</p>
<p>“Ahh-ah! Uggnhh!” Her m*ans came in waves as liquid gushed out of her lower body. Asta’s lips touched the nape of her neck. He licked it and kissed and sucked at it. But his fingers never stopped. His lips soon trailed to her ear and he slid his finger out from within her.</p>
