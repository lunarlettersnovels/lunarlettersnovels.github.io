            <p><strong>Chapter 60</strong></p>
<p>The question must have been a very personal one to Kaichen. I wondered why he wanted to know exactly but couldn’t think of anything. I could tell him everything about anything except what he had just asked me. I just couldn’t do it.</p>
<p>I licked my dry lips. My mouth felt dry. “Why do you want to know?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because…,” he said, cautiously, “it looks like you don’t really want to go back to Acrab.”</p>
<p>“I… don’t want to go back,” I said. Kaichen looked at me silently. His gaze gently urged me to answer him. I gulped several times to help with my dry throat and mouth. “Do you have any secret that you wouldn’t want anyone to know?” I asked.</p>
<p>He didn’t respond. “Everyone has something they can’t talk about,” I continued. “It’s the same for me too.” It wasn’t a convincing answer. And I know it sounded forced. But Kaichen looked at me and nodded as though he understood what I was trying to say. He turned his gaze away from me. I felt like I could finally breathe.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to go,” he said, “You are always welcome to stay here.”</p>
<p>He said it in a very indifferent tone like usual. But his words were kind. He could offer that kindness because he didn’t know the future, but I knew it. I had read it.</p>
<p>“Teacher…,” I said reluctantly, “Can I come here even if you aren’t present?”</p>
<p>“Do as you please.”</p>
<p>“Really? Can I come here whenever I want?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You can do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>“Teacher… can I be your official student?”</p>
<p>I had to try my luck. Perhaps another ‘do whatever you want’ could actually make my day. Kaichen raised his eyebrows and pressed on his temples as though he had a headache.</p>
<p>“Do you really want that?” he asked. I jumped. That was something I hadn’t expected. I had expected displeasure and rejection from him. Kaichen was a bundle full of surprises today.</p>
<p>“Yes!” I nodded earnestly. “I really want that.”</p>
<p>Kaichen sighed and looked at me. “Then it’s done.”</p>
<p>It would be an understatement to say that I jumped for joy. One year. I had thought it would take me that long, even longer to become his disciple. It was an ordeal of monumental difficulty because Kaichen had never taken a disciple.</p>
<p>He was picky, sensitive, indifferent, cold and hated interacting with people. But no one could surpass him in his skills regarding magic. Which was why I had decided that I would do anything possible: beg, lie, cook, clean, steal, murder… maybe not murder, to become his disciple. It was the reason why I had volunteered to go with him. I had volunteered to cook and do chores in the hopes that my wish would be fulfilled.</p>
<p><em>Finally! </em>This was a pleasant surprise… more of a shock. Kaichen accepted me as his official disciple!</p>
<p>“Really?” I asked, still not able to believe it. “Please tell me this is real…. Teacher, from henceforth, I am your official disciple. Do you really mean that?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>
<p>“Then do I have permission to tell anyone who asks that I am your disciple? Can I be called your student when I get the certificate from the Magic Association?”</p>
<p>“Whatever….”</p>
<p>“Then, teacher!” I started murmuring gibberish. This was so shocking. Kaichen looked tired but he made no move to leave. I hurriedly took out a piece of parchment and a pen out of my bag. I always carried pen and parchment in case I had to jot something down. I wrote on it and handed it to Kaichen. He looked at me with a questioning look and took the piece of parchment and read it. Then he chuckled.</p>
<p><em>Oh gosh! He is laughing!!! </em>I couldn’t believe it. My mouth fell open, my eyes wide. He took the pen from my hand and wrote something in return and handed me the parchment.</p>
<p>I took the parchment with trembling hands. My heart raced. I read the words on the parchment again and again to make sure this was not a dream. I could see Kaichen’s neat and graceful writing under my messy ones.</p>
<p><em>Disciple certificate</em></p>
<p><em>I acknowledge that Dalia Alshine is the only student of Kaichen Tenebre on the continent.</em></p>
<p><em>– Kaichen Tenebre: I agree</em></p>
<p>His name, his affirmative ‘I agree’ and his signature glowed a golden color. It was a magical binding statement. This could never be forged or revoked. This had become a magical binding certificate infused with his mana.</p>
<p>“Are you happy now?” he asked.</p>
<p>As though he had never chuckled. He returned to his intimidating, cold expression with some difficulty. But his eyes shone warmly. Holding the certificate close to me I nodded, and I laughed.</p>
<p>“I am your official student now!” I said happily, “I will follow your steps forever.”</p>
<p>“Oh god… Not for the rest of my life…”</p>
<p>I smiled. “Yes! For the rest of your life. Forever!” I rolled up the parchment and tied it carefully with a string. I then cast a protective magic on it to prevent it from any damage. Kaichen raised an eyebrow at the use of magic, but I smiled brightly at him and placed the parchment carefully in my bag.</p>
<p>I thought he wanted to say something more, but he turned his head away. I noticed that the tip of his ears had turned a little red. I giggled and was finally able to relax. I felt for the first time that my life was going in the right direction, that everything was going to be alright. The prerequisite for a perfect, happy life had been achieved.</p>
