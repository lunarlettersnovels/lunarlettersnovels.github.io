        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 252</strong></p>
<p>She remembered all the talks she had with that person, making them someone she really didn’t want to meet.</p>
<p>It hurt when she used her words to point out her weak spots and show her suspicious side.</p>
<p>No, it hurt just seeing that person.</p>
<p>Even though she was kind of lost, the pain she felt was obvious, and it was tough for her to deal with it.</p>
<p>But after Kaichen left, that person showed up.</p>
<p>Yanghwa didn’t say anything, but Dalia kept talking and saying strange things, like how all the food she had eaten was made by Dalia herself.</p>
<p><em>‘That… was really good, though.’</em></p>
<p>Since coming to the Kalhai Empire, she hadn’t had such delicious food. It actually tasted even better than the food she bought with her own money.</p>
<p>They started bringing things like sweet treats that melted in her mouth, but then she began to see dishes she missed from her home country, one by one.</p>
<p>Dalia always talked to herself and only stayed for a short time before leaving.</p>
<p>She said to tell her if she wanted something to eat, but Yanghwa didn’t have the courage to face her directly.</p>
<p>Even though she was hiding under the blanket, there was a tingling pain that pricked her skin that made it hard to get out.</p>
<p>So, Yanghwa picked up a pen to write, but strangely enough, she didn’t know how to write the imperial script.</p>
<p>She had learned the language from a young age and knew how to use it naturally, but avoided writing because it was bothersome, and chose to play outside instead.</p>
<p>Yanghwa cried as she scribbled <em>‘I want to eat poached rice’ </em>in the Suran language.</p>
<p>It was a dish she hadn’t eaten for a long time and almost forgot about.</p>
<p>White rice, light but flavorful soup, and side dishes with different seasonings mixed in.</p>
<p>Her mother always enjoyed cooking, and her father liked gathering all the siblings to eat together.</p>
<p>Yanghwa really loved the times when the whole family laughed together. Now that her beloved parents were gone, those times could never come back.</p>
<p>Then, when she saw Dalia come in without knocking, she quickly jumped into bed. Thinking this had happened before, she wondered why Dalia didn’t knock.</p>
<p>Dalia spoke as she pulled the familiar blanket over herself. “I brought you a Suran dish.”</p>
<p>Her body shivered involuntarily. Maybe Dalia had secretly read what She wrote on that piece of paper earlier.</p>
<p>Her movements slowed down on their own. Wondering if it was true, she subconsciously sniffed the air.</p>
<p>“You know that Suran food doesn’t taste good when it cools down, right?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“There’s even grilled mackerel in soybean soup.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I can’t resist.”</p>
<p>Dalia sat down on the sofa as usual and opened a book that looked difficult to read.</p>
<p>Yanghwa peeked at the table and saw that there really was Suran cuisine she had missed.</p>
<p>The pain that had made her skin tingle and brought her to tears was still there, but the food she wanted to eat made her nose tingle.</p>
<p>Almost instinctively, Yanghwa woke up and sat on the sofa.</p>
<p>As she came closer, a pain more intense than what she felt under the covers emerged.</p>
<p>It hurt.</p>
<p>Dalia Alshine’s special power, which she could sense without even seeing it, was extremely painful.</p>
<p>She used chopsticks to pick up a side dish and then a spoon to eat the hot rice.</p>
<p>Her nose tingled and her vision became blurry.</p>
<p>This person, who caused her pain and she wanted to avoid, why was the dish they made, the food from her home country that she missed so much, so delicious?</p>
<p>Why did it have to be this person who cooked the food she longed for?</p>
<p>Yanghwa sniffed and took a bite of food.</p>
<p>“…Then I’ll pretend.”</p>
<p>Dalia said that after seeing her quickly stuff her mouth without chewing properly.</p>
<p>Ignoring their comments, she forgot how she looked and ate absentmindedly.</p>
<p>Holding a glass of water in front of her, she turned her gaze back to her book.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her tears fell. Yanghwa didn’t know why she started crying.</p>
<p>Was it because she thought of her family or because she missed her hometown? Maybe it was because she had been through so many difficulties recently.</p>
<p>Her tears wouldn’t stop anyway, so she sniffled while shoving food into her mouth. Even though she didn’t need to force herself to eat, she just wanted to eat everything.</p>
<p>She couldn’t stop even though she knew it would make her feel terrible.</p>
<p>When she finished eating, she noticed that if Dalia had followed her usual routine, she would have had enough time to leave the room, but she had been reading the same chapter for several minutes now.</p>
<p>A wave of sadness washed over her.</p>
<p><em>‘Why you?’</em></p>
<p>Someone with such a strong power that only caused bone-deep pain.</p>
<p><em>‘Why on earth were you being so kind to me?’</em></p>
<p>Finally, Yanghwa understood why she didn’t want to meet Dalia.</p>
<p>This person was different from her. They could be warm and caring towards others despite their own terrible pain.</p>
<p><em>‘I’ll support you no matter what. Don’t be afraid, Yanghwa.’</em></p>
<p>They were strong enough to offer help without hesitation.</p>
<p>Yanghwa felt both jealous and scared of them at the same time. It was impressive to see how well they were doing despite their own challenges.</p>
<p>She couldn’t hold back her tears any longer. The sorrowful cries she let out held all the sadness she had been holding inside.</p>
<p>It was regret for her foolish behavior, longing for her family, and the deep loneliness she had felt for so long.</p>
<p>She had to tell her about the times she laughed under the blanket while listening to Dalia talk to herself in a kind voice. She also had to talk about Rosa’s sacrifice.</p>
<p>Would Dalia believe her if she told her that they were locked up in the same place as livestock?</p>
