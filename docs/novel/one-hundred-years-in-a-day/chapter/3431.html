            <p><strong>Chapter 92</strong></p>
<p>He had never followed him, but there were times when he went looking for him because he never came back on time. He had walked in on him doing the deed multiple times. Julius honestly knew no shame! The act of touching another person’s skin felt disgusting to Kaichen.</p>
<p>But why? Why is it that when he saw Dalia, his ‘thing’ reacted? He had never felt his desires getting so extreme. But now, every day was difficult. He had always been in control. He knew that his feelings for her were something he needed to acknowledge and he would. It wasn’t like he was in denial but his body always betrayed him.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t do to tell her about his feelings and hope she felt the same. Relationships should be built on mutual trust and affection. He wanted to be sure how she felt about him before he confessed anything.</p>
<p><em>And here I am acting like a dog in heat! I am not even young enough to be swayed by desires, so why? I have to be patient. I have to work on myself. </em>It was a shameful thing for him to admit that just holding hands with her caused him to be like this. She had been humming and waving. She looked so adorable. He had wanted to just grab her and kiss her.</p>
<p><em>“It’s said that love turns one into a fool. Kaichen, isn’t that anger of yours love?” </em>Julius had once asked when Kaichen had confessed his hatred towards Dalia in the past.</p>
<p>He had ignored and dismissed Julius because he had loathed and hated Dalia so much at that time. But he realized now that Julius’ words had been true.</p>
<p>He was a fool. He was surely acting like one. The greatest fool in the world. His body and mind had been taken over by her thoughts. His rationality struggled to seize control. He was trying not to fall for her. That was the only shred of pride he had left.</p>
<p>He let out a sigh and washed his face with cold water. He ran his fingers through his wet hair. He walked out of the washroom and opened the windows in the room to let in some air. The weather in Acrab was always sunny. It had been like this since the day he arrived here. The image of Dalia smiling and waving to him came to his mind.</p>
<p>“I am hopeless,” he muttered. The sunny, nice weather reminded him of her face. Was there nothing he could do without recalling her smile? He frowned and stretched his hand out. The golden mana melted from his hand. This only happened when the magic he had placed permanently on something was interrupted.</p>
<p>He remembered the magic he had placed on Sharatan’s house. But if something had happened there, the reaction would have been different. There was only one answer.</p>
<p>“Tsk.” He clicked his tongue and moved to the garden in a heartbeat. He stretched out his hands toward the perfect sky and watched his magic.</p>
<p>A translucent golden barrier surrounded the entirety of Acrab. There were numerous interruptions, but that was normal. There were several things he had casted permanent spell on but they were all limited to a fixed place… except Dalia’s bracelets.</p>
<p>She wouldn’t have disappeared without a word. She should have been back by now. He felt restless and worried. He had made it on impulse so that her suffering could be lessened.</p>
<p>It had been a gift. A magical symbol connecting a teacher and a disciple. He had hoped to establish some form of connection with her. It had been a harmless act fueled by his complex feelings for her. He had felt pathetic and shameful for being impulsive but right now it felt like he had done the right thing. He could find her by the bracelets if anything was wrong.</p>
<p><em>Where is she? What happened? </em>He gritted his teeth. There was a commotion outside the mansion. Kaichen did not have the time to inform or explain to anybody. He analyzed the magic he had gathered from the bracelet. Barrier magic was used along with teleportation magic.</p>
<p>Since there was no contact between the two, she must have been… locked up somewhere. He didn’t want to think of the alternative. He was worried about her safety. She was in a place where his magic couldn’t reach easily.</p>
<p><em>I should have made it so that I could be connected with the bracelet no matter where she went. I should have thought about it.</em> He felt regret and frustration clouding his mind. He kept thinking he should have added some protection when making the mana crystals so she could have had some help to escape. <em>I am sorry Dalia… please… please let her be safe.</em></p>
