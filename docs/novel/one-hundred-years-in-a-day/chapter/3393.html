            <p><strong>Chapter 130</strong></p>
<p>“He didn’t tell me! No, what you said just now… The same magic wand?”</p>
<p>[Yeah, the same magic wand. Would it be used as a marriage proposal for nothing? It’s because two magicians share the same wand.]</p>
<p>My mouth fell open. I closed my eyes to restrain my anxiety. I extended my hand forward. Kaichen had said that whenever you want to use your wand, you just need to think about it while using your mana and it would appear in your hands. It was Kaichen who had made the wand, I hadn’t really done anything. However, when I clenched my outstretched hands, black rose petals fell from it and began to scatter just like it happened with Kaichen. <em>F*uck!</em></p>
<p>[Hahaha!] I could hear Julius’s laughter. That laughter wasn’t much different from my own a while ago when I was rolling on the sofa and giggling my head off.</p>
<p>“Really… if only I could have known about this before…”</p>
<p>I never, never would have suggested it. Why did Kaichen even agree to it? He should have told me! Being taciturn had its limit! A marriage proposal… even if I was clueless, there was no way in hell he didn’t know about it. So why had he accepted? Why? <em>How far is he planning to go for me, his disciple? That b*stard!</em></p>
<p>He should have a limit even for his disciple. I felt like I was wrong about him being the perfect lover. If he did this much for his disciple, I would go crazy with jealousy!</p>
<p>[Hahahaha!] Julius was still laughing. He wheezed. [Fluttering flower petals? I guess it’s the same for Kaichen, except with golden flowers. It’s a pity I couldn’t see it! You really don’t disappoint.]</p>
<p><em>Please, I wish I could disappoint you. </em>I hated to see him laugh while holding his stomach. He was practically breathless from laughing. To think that he is the main character… such a waste! I wanted to cut off the communication. Unfortunately, I wasn’t Kaichen. I was a powerless countess, while he was the Crown prince. I could not do something so rude.</p>
<p><em>But unlike Kaichen, I need a wand!</em> A wand is absolutely necessary for precise mana control. Although I had a talent for controlling mana that was superior to that of an average magician, it was difficult because the concentration and amount of my mana were higher and stronger than that of an ordinary person. To balance it, I needed a wand! But will I always need to show my flying petals every time I want to use my wand?</p>
<p>It was unbelievable that now Kaichen’s mana and my mana had taken the same form. He had told me that the mana takes the form it is meant to be. Which part of these fluttering petals match him? The lonely black petals fluttered in the air around me. They looked so opposite to Kaichen’s which was golden and warm. Mine looked like something dreary out of a fairytale.</p>
<p>[Is that why Kaichen isn’t answering me? I understand that you didn’t know the meaning, but you should be more careful with your words, Countess. Unlike Acrab, Heulin is a dangerous place where a single world can ruin the whole family.]</p>
<p>“Then why did you call me to such a dangerous place?”</p>
<p>[There was no choice. I had to invite you. If you came here, I knew Kaichen would follow you.]</p>
<p>I remembered Julius contacting Kaichen every day. Kaichen spent his days in Acrab to help me with the estate. I did not even care to hide my bitter expression anymore.</p>
<p>“It’s because I’m more precious to my teacher than Your Highness. Because his love for his disciple is great.”</p>
<p>[I have spent many years with Kaichen. I’ll still have the upper hand.] Julius teased.</p>
<p>“In any case, I hope you will provide protection if I am in such a dangerous situation as you described? You invited me here, after all.”</p>
<p>[But your teacher will protect you even if I don’t.]</p>
<p>“Still, the power of Your Highness is absolute in the imperial capital. I plan to walk with my head held high knowing that the Crown Prince got my back.”</p>
<p>[Haha! If you really think that’s true, then you don’t know anything about Kaichen.] Julius muttered as though he was amused.</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe he said that! There was no one who knew more about Kaichen than me. I spent the last two years learning from him. I even knew about the type of food he liked and disliked, the clothes he felt comfortable in and what he hated the most in other people!</p>
<p>Julius used to talk about his past with Kaichen. The fights they fought together and quests they completed with each other. But I had read the original novel, so I knew about these already. Julius might actually be my biggest rival. In fact, Kaichen rarely showed any interest in women in the book that readers often shipped him together with Julius.</p>
<p>“Stop clinging to the teacher. Why don’t you just get engaged, Your Highness?”</p>
<p>[Because women are fighting over me so fiercely. I am here keeping the peace.]</p>
<p><em>Don’t make me laugh, you playboy! </em>I knew Julius didn’t want to commit. He had always gone around with everyone and refused to settle down. Of course, in the book, he would eventually meet someone he falls in love with. But right now, his love life was like a hurricane. However, it was commendable that he didn’t seek to hurt the women he spent time with. He always made his stance clear and let them choose to be with him of their own free will.</p>
