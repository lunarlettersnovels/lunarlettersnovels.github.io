            <p><strong>Chapter 250</strong></p>
<p>“I brought some Suran food.”</p>
<p>I said to her as she tried to pull the blanket over herself.</p>
<p>Her movements slowed down as she wrapped herself in the blanket, trembling greatly.</p>
<p>“You know that poached eggs don’t taste good when they cool down, right?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“There’s even grilled mackerel in miso soup.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You can’t help it, so what.”</p>
<p>I swallowed my laughter as I stared at Yanghwa, who had her mouth slightly open.</p>
<p>What a cute little creature!</p>
<p>I set the tray of food down on the sofa table. Pretending to be nonchalant, I unfolded a spell book and leaned back on the sofa, only to find that a wriggling little creature was sitting on the sofa before I knew it.</p>
<p>I gently raised the spell book and covered my mouth. I couldn’t hide the corners of her mouth any longer.</p>
<p>For Yanghwa, poached eggs were a local dish she hadn’t eaten in years, and she probably only could taste it a few times recently because of me.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine how much she would’ve wanted to eat this.</p>
<p>In addition, this cute little creature had a lot of appetite, a characteristic of the original female lead candidate.</p>
<p>She was a glutton comparable to Kaichen, who easily finished five meals a day and every dessert.</p>
<p>As someone who hadn’t eaten food in a few years, I felt that it was worthwhile as a chef for her to eat everything, but somewhere in my heart I felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yanghwa in the original work wasn’t such a glutton.</p>
<p>Although she liked to eat, she was just as adorable, and like Kaichen, was a character with the taste of a child with a sweet tooth.</p>
<p><em>‘What on earth happened….’</em></p>
<p>After running away from home, she came to the Kalhai Empire and still hadn’t opened her mouth about what had transpired.</p>
<p>Numerous questions remained, such as how she came into contact with opium, what she suffered from, what it was, and when she was saved by Asta.</p>
<p>Julius said that we should build friendships with them because they would definitely help when establishing diplomatic relations with the Suran Empire.</p>
<p>That sounded a bit cold and callous.</p>
<p>A lot of people must have taken advantage of this little girl already, and it pricked at my conscience because we seemed to be trying to use it too.</p>
<p><em>‘We shouldn’t approach her that way, but getting help… Yanghwa likes Julius, so I have to step in and help….’</em></p>
<p>I didn’t see it, but it must be.</p>
<p>Was she just a candidate for the female lead? At least until the part I read, I felt something like love in the air between the two of them.</p>
<p>But, what about Julius now?</p>
<p>Isn’t he just a rotten guy who just wants to build friendships and take advantage of them?</p>
<p><em>‘The main character is… Would that work?’</em></p>
<p>I opened my eyes and slowly lowered the book that was covering my mouth.</p>
<p>I sniffed and saw Yanghwa, who was stuffing rice into her cheeks like a squirrel.</p>
<p>“…Then I’ll pretend.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Her two big eyes looked like they were about to cry.</p>
<p>It was to the point where I couldn’t tell whether she was eating her nose or the food I had cooked.</p>
<p>“Hu… woo… kuh….”</p>
<p>I carefully closed my book as I watched the perfectly grilled mackerel stuffed into her mouth, seasoned with expensive salt, and cooked  with fire magic that was close to divine.</p>
<p>Eventually, her large dark-brown eyes fluttered, and her tears started to flow.</p>
<p>Even as she shed her tears, Yanghwa didn’t stop eating.</p>
<p>The sight was so pitiful that I was about to offer some comforting words, but then I stopped and opened the book again.</p>
<p>At times like this, it seemed better to pretend to be nonchalant.</p>
<p>I don’t know what happened, but any consolation would be useless for the despair that accumulated over the years and the tears that were flowing with sadness.</p>
<p>I kept reading the spell book but I couldn’t even get to the next chapter.</p>
<p>I didn’t even look at her, except when I poured water and handed her a glass.</p>
<p>I waited patiently for her to finish her meal.</p>
<p>I don’t even know how much time passed. Yanghwa put down her chopsticks, and I closed the magic book that I only read one page of.</p>
<p>Yanghwa was still crying, her face contorted.</p>
<p>She blew her nose with a nearby napkin, one by one, and she spoke to me for the first time.</p>
<p>“Sniff… Thank … you… huk, for the meal…”</p>
<p>I think she inhaled it all.</p>
<p>I felt sorry for Yanghwa, but I wasn’t moved at all.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you enjoyed your meal.”</p>
<p>I smiled broadly, moving my facial muscles as far as I could so as not to make her feel awkward.</p>
<p>As Yanghwa shed tears, she looked at me blankly, and then buried her face in her lap and cried like a child.</p>
<p>“Hngggg! Huk… Arghhh!”</p>
<p>This was unexpected, so I got up in a panic and walked over to give her an awkward pat on the back.</p>
<p>Then she sniffed loudly and glanced at me, then hugged me and sobbed with tears and snot all over.</p>
<p>“Huh! Keuk! Urghhh!”</p>
<p>She cried so desperately that I couldn’t shake her off. It was as if all the energy from food she ate before was used for crying.</p>
<p>I awkwardly gave her a hug, patted her on the back, and even stroked her hair, and then stared blankly into space.</p>
<p>How far was she pushed to the edge of the cliff for her to cry like this?</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered what happened within the time magic that I had spent a hundred years in.</p>
<p>I thought about the time when I stood in the garden, bleeding all over myself as I smashed everything in the mansion.</p>
<p>No matter what I did, ‘today’ would start again anyway, and I wouldn’t be able to escape.</p>
<p>I cried and cried as I hit the garden floor in unbearable loneliness and solitude.</p>
<p>I cried and cried, but the tears wouldn’t stop.</p>
<p>It was even before I went crazy.</p>
<p>Maybe that was how my mind broke down.</p>
<p>There was no other reason for crying like that.</p>
