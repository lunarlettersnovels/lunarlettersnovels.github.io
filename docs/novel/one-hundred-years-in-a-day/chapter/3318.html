            <p><strong>Chapter 205</strong></p>
<p>I listened to Kaichen as he enlarged the map, acting like he was explaining to a kindergartener, but then, I frowned at the last question.</p>
<p>“That must definitely be the sea… oh!</p>
<p>My mouth hung open. The old map that Haram brought was a limited map of the Acrab region, but the map magically created by Kaichen showed the entire continent. Acrab of the Kalhai Empire was located at the eastern end of the continent. Of course, there had to be an ocean beyond the gold mines.</p>
<p>However, what Kaichen was pointing to wasn’t the ocean, but a thin stretch of land that connected the continents.</p>
<p><em>‘What is this!’</em></p>
<p>I was so surprised that my eyes widened and my mouth hung open.</p>
<p>“Was the wall pierced through?”</p>
<p>Kaichen looked away from me and asked Haram. The question of whether it was pierced or not must have meant whether the wall leading to the other continent was broken down.</p>
<p><em>‘The eastern continent across the sea? No, it’s not the eastern continent. A country just to the east… I didn’t expect this at all.’</em></p>
<p>I had read the original work, so I thought I would know everything about the world map. I knew that the eastern continent across the sea resembled East Asian culture in my previous life.</p>
<p>Since trade was actively conducted through ships, the culture of the eastern continent was not unfamiliar to the empire. However, it took time to travel, and there was a sense of distance from the other continents, so instead of a country, it was called the ‘eastern continent’.</p>
<p>To think that the eastern continent was not located on a faraway continent across the sea but belonged to the same continent as the Empire in the first place.</p>
<p>“It was pierced through. There was a cliff. I… I saw a forest. It was foggy, but it was clearly a forest. It stretched out very far. It must have been land!”</p>
<p>Haram couldn’t hide his excitement and a noise escaped him. It was such a great discovery that it made the old craftsman so excited. Of course, if there was land where the sea should be, wouldn’t it be such a great and exciting discovery?</p>
<p>“I’d like to hire a small number of people to pave the way.”  Kaichen said, disintegrating the magic map with his hand.</p>
<p>I slightly closed my gaping mouth and stared at Kaichen. “Master, how long have you known about this?” I asked. Kaichen remained silent.</p>
<p>“Did you know since the beginning?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you helped speed up the development?”</p>
<p>“It’s because you needed it.”</p>
<p>“Killing two birds with one stone…?”</p>
<p>Kaichen was a little displeased to receive such a look from me. “The ancient documents were discovered a long time ago. Had it been known to the world earlier, Acrab would have become a battlefield. I couldn’t let that happen. So, I kept it a secret from you,” he explained.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say anything, though?” I said.</p>
<p>“I decided that it would benefit Acrab greatly to be able to interact with the east through land travel, so it would be better to proceed quietly.”</p>
<p>“Okay. But I didn’t need an explanation from you.”</p>
<p>Even as I said that, I continued to squint my eyes at him. Kaichen let out a deep sigh and turned head to face Haram.</p>
<p>“I will go and check it myself. His Highness already knows, so we mustn’t make a fuss and proceed more secretly than now.”</p>
<p>“Ah, understood!”</p>
<p>Haram nodded his head, then bowed deeply and quickly left the office. He seemed to have noticed that the atmosphere had changed. That old man had good sense.</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>After Haram left, Kaichen leaned over the desk and called out to me in a low voice. His voice was soft and sweet, and I almost burst out into a shiver.</p>
<p>“Why are you angry?”</p>
<p>I didn’t look at him. “I’m not angry.”</p>
<p>“Is it because I kept it a secret?”</p>
<p>“That’s the thing. Master manages to fool me everytime…”</p>
<p>“I’ve never fooled you.” Kaichen propped up the desk with one hand and gently stroked my hair with the other. “I just didn’t want you to be in danger.”</p>
<p>Hearing his sweet whispers, I looked away while singing the Korean national anthem in my head. His fatally handsome face and sweet voice was magic that could make anyone forgive him. Yes, he was bewitching me with magic.  If it wasn’t for that, there’s no way that my heart would melt easily, considering that he kept a huge matter from the very beginning.</p>
<p>“Master, you can’t just solve things like this on your own every time,” I firmly said, looking at him.</p>
<p>“… Are you still going to be angry?”</p>
<p>I let out a deep sigh. Kaichen caressed my hair, not knowing what else to do. It was difficult to remain mad.</p>
<p><em>‘Yes, keeping this a secret was a good call. Considering something this big, even a small leak in information would quickly become dangerous. Acrab could become a bloodbath. I guess that’s why he had no choice.’</em></p>
<p>My sly, treacherous heart was defending Kaichen before I knew it. I pouted at him. “Why do you think I’m mad? I’m just disappointed… irritated.”</p>
<p>When I scratched the bottom of his chin as if tickling him, he smiled as if he hadn’t been restless in the first place. Perhaps I am a <em>fool.</em></p>
<p>“I won’t hide things from you anymore.”</p>
<p>His words seemed sincere. Kaichen smiled, raised his body and lightly stroked my hair before turning away. He seemed to know how to deal with me now, so he was being cheeky.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, Dalia.”</p>
<p>Then, there was me who jumped up and ran to hold his hand as he leaned at the door of the office, reaching out to me.</p>
<p>I think I like him more than he likes me. There’s a saying that the person who falls in love more, loses. That thought came to me when I saw Kaichen holding my hand tightly as he was smiling amusedly.</p>
<p>So what if I like him more? I wanted to be the only one he was smiling at.</p>
