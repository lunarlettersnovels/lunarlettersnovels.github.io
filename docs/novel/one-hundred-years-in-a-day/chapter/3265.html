            <p><strong>Chapter 258</strong></p>
<p>Kaichen responded curtly with an icy gaze, as if a froststorm were brewing, and then turned his head away. Duran seemed quite flustered, probably thinking he had made a huge mistake, as it was clear that Kaichen wasn’t in a good mood.</p>
<p>Truly a pure-hearted youth.</p>
<p>“Master has been feeling down lately due to some difficulties in his research. It’s not because of you, Duke, so you don’t need to worry.”</p>
<p>“Still, I have been very rude.”</p>
<p>Duran offered a sincere apology and then lingered for a moment with an air of elegance, exchanging a few more words before excusing himself from my presence.</p>
<p>He had conducted himself with such grace, even after being rejected for a date. He maintained his manners until the very end.</p>
<p>“Dalia, you can be ruthless,” Yanghwa quipped from beside me.</p>
<p>My eyes widened. “Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Did you really have to reject him so bluntly? You could have at least gone for a garden tour with him.”</p>
<p>As I sat back down, I glanced briefly at Kaichen and responded to Yanghwa’s words.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t want to give anyone the wrong impression with my actions. Besides, it’s not just Duran who might misinterpret my ambiguous behavior and feel hurt.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I’m not sure.”</p>
<p>“See, it’s because I don’t want to create unnecessary misunderstandings with someone I like. And I don’t want to raise unwarranted expectations from someone who acts as courteously as Duran.”</p>
<p>With a smile, I looked at Kaichen, and he folded his arms. He hadn’t said a word from the beginning, but his jealousy had been clearly visible.</p>
<p>“Right, Master?”</p>
<p>He sighed. “… Yes.”</p>
<p>Kaichen seemed to realize that his recent actions had not been very rational and let out another sigh before standing up. Brushing his hair back, he briefly excused himself and asked to leave the room.</p>
<p>“Kaichen, where are you suddenly going?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Well, maybe it’s time for some self-reflection?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yanghwa tilted her head with a playful expression, pondering what to eat from the remaining three-tier dessert tray.</p>
<p>As I watched Kaichen walking in the direction Duran had gone, a strange warmth spread through my chest, causing my lips to curl upwards involuntarily.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as if Kaichen had said anything particularly sweet or performed any heart-fluttering actions that would make my face flush.</p>
<p>Whether it was because of female intuition or simply a hunch, I couldn’t tell. However, after the strange interactions I had with Daiman and Duran at the previous ball, I now understood the reason I had tried so hard to distance myself from them.</p>
<p>Kaichen was not very adept at expressing emotions. While his sudden displays of affectionate gestures surprised me, he was still uncomfortable and inexperienced with interacting with others.</p>
<p>Although I had improved significantly in this regard, for others, I wasn’t that different from how I used to be. Meanwhile, Kaichen still exuded an aura of aloofness and coldness, making it difficult for others to approach him.</p>
<p><em>‘Thanks to that, no women dare to approach him… but…’</em></p>
<p>Kaichen was changing. Just as he had regretted his childish behavior driven by jealousy towards Duran earlier and had gone to apologize, he was slowly becoming more open to interacting with others.</p>
<p>It was a good growth, but I felt uncomfortable and couldn’t openly raise my arms and welcome it. I was filled with regret to show people the treasure that I only wanted to keep to myself.</p>
<p>Even though I knew that this was a really childish thought, my desire for monopoly and ownership only grew.</p>
<p>“It seems I was the childish one,” I sighed.</p>
<p>“Really? All of a sudden?” Yanghwa asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m always acting like a child. Throw tantrums if I want to and I want to be stubborn without getting scolded too much.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like it.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>In an unexpected response, Yanghwa answered while munching on a cookie.</p>
<p>“Children can’t take responsibility for their actions. They always need protectors, and they have limited capabilities to do things on their own. So, I don’t like acting like a child.”</p>
<p>Kaichen replied curtly, his gaze icy as if a frost storm was brewing. Then he turned his head away. Duran appeared quite flustered, probably thinking he had committed a significant error. It was evident that Kaichen was not in a good mood.</p>
<p>A genuinely pure-hearted youth.</p>
<p>“Master has been feeling down lately due to some research difficulties. It’s not because of you, Duke, so you don’t need to worry.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, I have been rude.”</p>
<p>Duran offered a heartfelt apology and then lingered gracefully for a moment, exchanging a few more words before excusing himself from my presence.</p>
<p>He displayed such grace even after I rejected his proposal. He upheld his manners right to the end.</p>
<p>“Dalia, you can be ruthless,” Yanghwa joked from my side.</p>
<p>My eyes widened. “What?”</p>
<p>“Did you need to reject him so bluntly? You could have at least accepted a garden tour with him.”</p>
<p>As I settled back down, I briefly glanced at Kaichen and replied to Yanghwa’s observations.</p>
<p>“Well, I wouldn’t want to convey the wrong impression with my actions. Besides, it’s not only Duran who might misunderstand my unclear behavior and feel hurt.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I’m doubtful.”</p>
<p>“That’s because I wouldn’t want to create unnecessary misunderstandings with someone I have affection for. Additionally, I’d rather not raise unwarranted expectations from someone who conducts himself as courteously as Duran.”</p>
<p>I looked at Kaichen with a smile, and he crossed his arms. He hadn’t spoken a word since the beginning, but his jealousy was palpable.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that right, Master?”</p>
<p>He sighed. “… Yes.”</p>
<p>Kaichen seemed to recognize that his recent behavior lacked rationality and heaved another sigh before standing up. Brushing his hair back, he briefly excused himself and requested to leave the room.</p>
<p>“Kaichen, where are you suddenly off to?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s time for some self-reflection.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yanghwa tilted her head with a playful expression, contemplating which treat to choose from the remaining dessert tray with multiple tiers.</p>
<p>I observed Kaichen walking in the direction Duran had taken—an odd warmth spread through my chest, causing my lips to involuntarily curl upwards.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as if Kaichen had said something particularly endearing or given me a heart-fluttering gesture that would make me blush.</p>
<p>Whether it was due to feminine intuition or simply a hunch, I couldn’t discern. However, after the peculiar interactions I’d experienced with Daiman and Duran at the prior ball, I now understood why I had maintained a certain distance from them.</p>
<p>Kaichen was not skilled in expressing his emotions. Even though his sudden affectionate gestures surprised me, he still appeared uneasy and unskilled in social interactions.</p>
<p>While I had made considerable progress in this aspect, to others, I wasn’t all that different from how I used to be. Meanwhile, Kaichen continued to exude an aura of aloofness and chilliness, making him unapproachable.</p>
<p>‘Thanks to that, no women dare to approach him… but…’</p>
<p>Kaichen was changing. Just as he had regretted his childish actions driven by jealousy toward Duran earlier and had extended an apology, he was gradually becoming more open to engaging with others.</p>
<p>It was undoubtedly positive growth, but I felt disconcerted and couldn’t openly embrace and welcome it. I was consumed by remorse at the thought of displaying the treasure I was inclined to keep exclusively for myself to the world.</p>
<p>Despite the childishness of this sentiment, my desire for exclusivity and ownership only grew.</p>
<p>“It appears I’ve been the childish one,” I sighed.</p>
<p>“Really? Out of nowhere?” Yanghwa inquired.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m always behaving like a child. I throw tantrums when I please, and I enjoy being stubborn with only little reprimand.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like it.”</p>
<p>“Why’s that?”</p>
<p>Yanghwa replied while munching on a cookie. Her blunt answer was unexpected.</p>
<p>“Youngsters can’t take responsibility for their actions. They always need protectors, and they have limited capabilities to do things on their own. So, I don’t like acting like a child.”</p>
<p>“…Your Highness, you’re quite mature.”</p>
<p>“Dahlia, we only have a two-year age difference.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s true…”</p>
<p>Yanghwa, who used to be a small and precious being, now seemed like a sturdy large dog.</p>
<p>In the first place, if Yanghwa were the main character, there was no way she would only be small and cute.</p>
<p>Being the main character’s companion was difficult, especially in a male-oriented fantasy novel. And even more so, she was the main character from a foreign empire.</p>
<p>‘Clearly… she recovered quickly from that terrible incident.’</p>
<p>Despite fleeing and coming to the Kalhai Empire and experiencing many hardships, Yanghwa hadn’t lost her innocence and cheerful demeanor. Just that alone was already quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Nothing was as impressive as a heart that doesn’t break.</p>
<p>“Oh my! Oh my~ I wonder who this could be~?”</p>
<p>As I lifted the teacup, my arm jolted slightly.</p>
<p>It was a typical line one might have heard once in a while in novels and comics, but I couldn’t help but wonder why noble heiresses always appeared saying these lines.</p>
<p>The reason was simple – they had to start an argument from the first sentence; otherwise, they wouldn’t be true to their character. And, of course, they would rather die than say something nice.</p>
<p>I turned slowly and saw Lamia approaching me with the young noble ladies.</p>
<p>Her fluttering feather fan, opulent dress, and glittering, luxurious jewelry were enough to blind anyone who looked at her.</p>
<p>Yes, she was pretty. I acknowledged that. However, considering the purpose behind the grand garden party at the Manuwell Duchy, such extravagant attire was inappropriate.</p>
<p>“I’ve been to the north, so I rarely have time. It seems that the news of the Empire is very slow for the Marquis of Sorel,” I replied.</p>
