            <p><strong>Chapter 213</strong></p>
<p>I had known from the moment I set out on this journey that Kaichen would be the one to sweep me away, he was skillful despite his lack of experience. But my body was alight with unfamiliar sensations, and I couldn’t help but wonder what was to come.</p>
<p>He was eager, his excitement palpable as his hardness pressed against me, yet he remained patient. His focus was on my lips, his tongue and teeth teasing and tasting as my own excitement began to mount.</p>
<p>His touch was incredible, but I couldn’t help but notice that he had yet to touch himself where it mattered most. Was he hesitating, even now, after claiming he wouldn’t let me go?</p>
<p>‘<em>This kind of opportunity doesn’t come easily,’</em> I thought to myself.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, I reached out a hand to his domineering length. He flinched at my touch, biting his lower lip, but I pretended not to notice. I couldn’t understand why he would hesitate, not now, so I wrapped my hand around him, my fingers exploring his thick, protruding veins.</p>
<p>I felt him let out a breath, his lips pulling away from mine as I lowered my head to stare at the magnificent sight before me.</p>
<p>“Master, I think this…is a little too much,” I breathed.</p>
<p>Kaichen laughed, a deep rumble that sent shivers down my spine. “You like it though?” he asked, a hint of amusement in his voice.</p>
<p>“Um…I do, but it’s also too much,” I replied, my mind reeling at the realization that this man, who always appeared so stoic and reserved in his neat robes, had such a beast hidden within him.</p>
<p>He was sexy, and I couldn’t help but wonder what other surprises he had in store for me. Just imagining it made me excited, and I tightened my grip.</p>
<p>He let out a small m*an as he rested his forehead on my shoulder. I rubbed it gently and moved my hand up and down, causing water to splash.</p>
<p>As I touched the slit on his tip with my finger, Kaichen bit me hard on the shoulder. He had a habit of biting when he was excited.</p>
<p>“Ha… Dalia,” he m*aned.</p>
<p>I gripped his shaft and quickly moved my hand up and down, while his hand, which had been caressing my back, grabbed my mounds. Kaichen clicked his tongue and snapped his fingers as his clothes bothered him.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Our clothes disappeared without any warning. He used magic to take them off, feeling it was a waste of time to take each piece off one by one. He began rubbing my peaks in circular motions. My n!pples stood upright and trembled with anticipation. It was a natural reaction, knowing the pleasure his hand gave me.</p>
<p>“Dalia,” he said, his rough voice cracking a little.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Do it more,” he begged.</p>
<p>The length in my hand twitched. As I moved my hand up and down again, Kaichen momentarily stopped rubbing my are*la and lightly caressed my bre*sts. My back shuddered at the ticklish feeling. I wished he would touch me a little more strongly.</p>
<p>“Ngh…”</p>
<p>He pressed his lips to the nape of my neck, the sensation sending shivers down my spine. Then, his fingers tightened around my n!pple, eliciting a gasp from my lips.</p>
<p>But just as the pleasure was reaching its peak, his touch abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>The sound of water splashing echoed in the air as he shifted, raising my knees. I couldn’t help but gaze hungrily at his body, heated from the bath, as if I wanted to devour him whole.</p>
<p>“You really… make me feel embarrassed,” he murmured.</p>
<p>“Hmm, maybe I do. Ha, Master’s troubled face is so… hm, cute,” I teased.</p>
<p>“Get a grip,” he retorted, trying to keep his composure.</p>
<p>“Haa, what?”</p>
<p>“You’re always…”</p>
<p>His hand slipped lower, gripping my hip and pulling me closer. He caressed it in a circular motion before moving inward.</p>
<p>My s*x, already slick with desire, welcomed his touch eagerly, as if it had been waiting for him. He traced slow circles over my sensitive spot, making me gasp.</p>
<p>“Every time you do that, I feel like I can’t control myself,” I whispered breathily.</p>
<p>He let out a low growl, his chest rising and falling heavily with each breath. His gaze was fixed on my breasts, as if they were a tasty treat within reach.</p>
<p>My knees shook, and if not for his grip on my thigh, I would have crumpled. I clung to him tightly. He caught one of my breasts between his lips and tantalized it with his tongue.</p>
<p>“Ha! Ack!”</p>
<p>At the same time, while he rubbed my clit, his middle finger slipped downwards, gently rubbing my entrance.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long. His finger on my opening entered like he was stabbing me. I hugged his head tighter at the unfamiliar feeling of his fingers.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…”</p>
<p>The sound of him suckling my nipples echoed strangely in the bathtub. The sound made my hair stand on end. He crooked his fingers inside me as he pricked and stirred my insides. My sensitive body sucked his finger in before he put in a second one.</p>
<p>“Ngh, Master…”</p>
<p>I was getting anxious since I knew of the pleasure of his manhood… A more intense, heavy sensation of his p*nis filling my lower abdomen. I wanted that. I put a hand on Kaichen’s head and grabbed his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Haa… ah, faster…”</p>
<p>My nipples tingled as he suckled them before he pulled away. The golden eyes that looked up at me were hazy.</p>
