            <p><strong>Chapter 27</strong></p>
<p>It’s not that I was unaware of the effects of alcoholism, but Dalia’s body had reached such a level of addiction that her body was unable to function without alcohol. The withdrawal symptoms kept becoming severe and I was afraid it was going to get worse.</p>
<p>“Will he help me?” I mumbled to myself and sighed. Soon it was bright enough that I didn’t need the sphere of light anymore. I rolled around on the grass for a while and sat up.</p>
<p><em>I need to be positive. </em>“Besides, he would hardly want his one and only disciple to die of alcoholism. If I persuade him a little, I know he will help,” I said aloud to myself.</p>
<p>My condition had become worse than what I had expected. But I still had three months before the incident foretold in the original story could come to pass. I just have to make the cure before that and improve my physical health. It wouldn’t be easy but there was no other way.</p>
<p><em>I will keep addressing him as ‘teacher’. Who knows that he might eventually get used to it and accept me as his official disciple?</em></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>If I could sum up my duties and my relationship to Kaichen, it would be ‘temporary disciple to the archmage’ on the surface, while also being his research subject and a capable maid.</p>
<p>Sitting on my bed, I recalled the past week. First, Kaichen had come home in such a long time that he didn’t emerge from the safety of his room for four whole days. When I prepared the first breakfast and saw that it had been left untouched, I opened his bedroom door to offer the food. I enquired whether he could spare some money so that I could buy some ingredients for better food. Upon which, he looked at me with deep contempt and threw a bag of gold coins at me and threatened to throw me out if I ever came to his room without being summoned. Granted I should have knocked (which I had forgotten to do, yet again), but did I really deserve to be looked at with so much loathing?</p>
<p>While repeating to myself that I needed to learn to knock, I walked to the nearby village with gold coins in my pocket. Sharatan was the southernmost village in the Empire. It looked completely different from Acrab, which was towards the east.</p>
<p>Due to its unique terrain, Acrab had only two roads to Hwangdo Island, one of which passed through the rugged Mencar Mountains. It used to be a very steep road, but in recent years it had been overrun with thieves, who stole all of the goods from merchants of Acrab.</p>
<p>The other way was a detour to the south, which took longer than crossing the mountain range, and the cost of passage was expensive as well. So, going that way was a loss for the merchants. Since both routes posed problems, I had no choice but to put a hold on the travelling merchants till I found a solution. <em>I am so unlucky all the time.</em></p>
<p>I looked at the Sharatan village. It wasn’t as big as Acrab, obviously, but it was big for a village and had decent shops and taverns. The peculiar thing I found out about this village was that it was warm all year, so everyone wore light clothes. I, having been cold in Kaichen’s house, had opted for a thick robe thinking it would be cold here. Great! Now I felt like an outsider. My whole outfit screamed ‘outsider’, in fact.</p>
<p>People were very tan in Sharatan village. They had brown skin. I now realized why Kaichen’s complexion was copper-colored. In the original novel, it was briefly mentioned that he was from the southern part of the country.</p>
<p>“Mister, this is delicious! What is it made of?”</p>
<p>“You have good taste! It’s a desert-scorpion, grilled over a direct fire with Sharatan’s special seasoning sauce!”</p>
<p>It was savory and sweet and had a tangy, spicy taste which lingered in my mouth deliciously. The flesh was plump and juicy. I had never tasted anything of this sort in Acrab.</p>
<p>I barfed. A pity that my body couldn’t digest anything delicious. “I am so sorry,” I apologized hastily, “This is really delicious. I would eat it every day if I could, but I am not feeling very well right now, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“If you aren’t feeling well, maybe you should see a doctor.”</p>
<p>I paid for the food and waved to the shopkeeper as I walked away trying to avoid his concerned gaze studying my face. I had lost my appetite now. No matter what I tried, I felt queasy and nauseous. I gave up on tasting the various delicious food here. I couldn’t digest it anyway, so what was even the point?</p>
<p>I went to the furniture store next, cursing Dalia in my mind for being a drunkard that she was. I didn’t really need to buy too much but I was getting tired and lonely of the empty room. I at least needed a desk and a chair, and maybe a few other things to study and make my potion.</p>
<p>“You want to make a custom order?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s a desk that looks like this, can you make it for me?” I asked, showing the owner of the store a blueprint that I had drawn myself. “I can explain everything in detail if you have any questions.”</p>
<p>“This is curiously a very detailed drawing. It won’t be difficult to make,” the owner looked at me. “But if you can draw it in so much detail, I am sure you can even make it yourself.”</p>
<p>“I am not well, so I don’t have the strength to make it myself.”</p>
<p>The owner nodded and agreed to make it, probably because I looked so sickly and exhausted after having walked all the way to the village.</p>
<p>“Seeing how fair you are, you don’t seem to be from around here.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I am visiting an acquaintance. I will be staying here for a while.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t really hear about anyone arriving in the village lately.” The owner looked at me, suspicion clouding his gaze.</p>
<p>I pulled down the hood low over my head. “It is a bit far from here. He doesn’t like associating with people.”</p>
<p>“What a recluse and a nerd.”</p>
<p>I laughed out loud. I had heard so many nicknames for Kaichen but ‘nerd’ was a first. And where was the lie? He was a nerd <em>and </em>a recluse.</p>
