            <p><strong>Chapter 30</strong></p>
<p>Kaichen had realized that his body was in a much worse condition than he had initially expected. He suffered from depletion of his mana. It was good that he had returned home instead of going to the magic tower.</p>
<p>Even after sleeping for four full days, he was still exhausted. He hadn’t recovered fully but this would do for now. If he hadn’t come back and rested, it could have been fatal. It would take time to restore his mana. The magic he used to break the time magic in Acrab had taken its toll on his body.</p>
<p>Kaichen had chosen to build his house in the forest where no other people could find it easily. He had also created a magical circle around it so that the space was infused with recovery magic. It was his resting place and also a place where he could hide from others in the continent. Although that might be contestable now, since he wasn’t alone in living here. There was someone else who felt it okay to casually open his bedroom without knocking. Even after his outburst, she had just softly smiled without seeming surprised.</p>
<p>It stumped him. <em>How does she just casually open the door to a man’s room? </em>Even if she had been trapped and alone for a hundred years, it would be embarrassing to open the door to a man’s room unannounced, especially for a woman. <em>Is it because she doesn’t see me as a man? </em>The thought didn’t make him happy.</p>
<p>He frowned and tried to brush off the thought. He felt the mana building within and around his body. It wasn’t a complete recovery, but it was working. He liked the food she cooked. It was better than the Imperial Palace Chef’s for starters. He restrained himself from pouncing on the food because she always watched him as he ate to gauge what he liked. Her gaze was always curious, and persistent.</p>
<p><em>Why aren’t you eating? </em>He wanted to ask. They had eaten together during the trip here. But every time she made him breakfast; it was only him who ate while she watched. She had transformed the kitchen that he had maybe visited only around five times in his entire life. He didn’t want to admit it, but it definitely felt more homely and comfortable. He didn’t need to go to the village to eat anymore and she always made things that he liked.</p>
<p>“Teacher! The soil in the yard is good. Can I plant vegetables there?”</p>
<p>“How is it? I made it to suit your taste.”</p>
<p>“I know you like it, but you don’t want to admit it! You think I don’t know?”</p>
<p>Endless questions! Just a week, maybe two that they had spent together, and Dalia already knew all about his taste. His mysophobia that Julius said was serious was nothing to worry about with Dalia. She cleaned everything spotlessly. Not a speck of dust anywhere.</p>
<p>Kaichen was curious in the beginning but now he was sure. There was always a scent of rose emanating in the house from the time she came. It seemed she was concocting something with the yellow roses blooming outside the house. <em>How many talents does she possess? What else did she learn for a hundred years? </em>He didn’t want to admit it, but he was in awe. Of course, he would never mention it aloud.</p>
<p><em>Why the hell do I not mind when she changes things in the house? </em>Kaichen wondered. He had always been a stickler when it came to his house and his space but curiously, he seemed to like it when she changed things around here.</p>
<p>He always heard her downstairs from early in the morning to late at night. Always busily moving around. <em>Does this woman even sleep? </em>He had wondered more than once.</p>
<p>One day when he went downstairs and saw her, her complexion looked very pale, and she looked ragged. But he was reminded of painful childhood memories, so he didn’t pry. He wanted to distance himself from her as much as possible.</p>
<p>He only viewed her as his subject for research, so he spent a while in the morning to ask her about the hundred years she had spent in the time magic and what she could tell him about the forbidden magic.</p>
<p>He loathed even that interaction. So, he suggested that she write her experiences in the time magic in a report and give it to him. He looked at her haggard and fatigued face but didn’t think much of it because Dalia’s reputation as an alcoholic preceded her. Besides, she had said she was quitting drinking, so he found no reason to worry.</p>
<p>“Aaaaah! Aargh!” A piercing scream cut through the quiet one morning. When he rushed to her room, he found that her hands were cut and dripping with blood. Shattered mirror glasses were everywhere. She was kneeling on the ground with her hands pressed tightly against her ears and her eyes tightly closed. Her body was shaking uncontrollably. She then started scratching her skin as though she wanted to tear them away from her body.</p>
