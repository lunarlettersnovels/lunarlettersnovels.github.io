            <h3><strong>Chapter 262</strong></h3>
<p>“Chushinik! Call for the counselor immediately!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>Upon receiving Julius’s command, Chushinik hurried to leave, but the owner of the house, Duke Drenice, directed Duran instead.</p>
<p>“No, Your Majesty. Duran! Hurry and go fetch Victor!”</p>
<p>He must be the resident physician of the Manuwell family.</p>
<p>“What… Countess, what’s happening!” Julius, showing rare anger, shouted without hiding his frustration.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Your Majesty. It’s because I didn’t properly attend to Princess Yanghwa…”</p>
<p>“Ugh… Dalia didn’t, she… Ugh… No… She did that!”</p>
<p>Yanghwa had been an exemplary student, diligent and meticulous in following instructions.</p>
<p>All eyes turned to Lamia, who trembled as she found herself singled out in the crowd. The tense throng of ladies surrounding the agitated Lamia, and Princess Yanghwa caught in the middle.</p>
<p><em>‘Getting caught up just by the scene!’</em></p>
<p>Despite that, it seemed oddly fitting that she was standing in the midst of all this.</p>
<p>Yanghwa now sniffled and began to whimper. Her acting was so remarkable that it could win both the Academy Awards and the Oscars.</p>
<p>Was this really acting? It even made me, who knew everything, raise an eyebrow; for those unaware of the situation, it must have been even more perplexing.</p>
<p>“I, I’m not! Your Majesty… Oh, it’s a misunderstanding!”</p>
<p>Lamia naturally protested, but Julius paid no attention.</p>
<p>From what could be seen at a distance, it seemed like everyone was tormenting Yanghwa. Regardless, Lamia Sorel’s reputation in social circles wasn’t favorable, even if she was seen as a flower of high society.</p>
<p><em>‘It looks like even her own side won’t defend her.’</em></p>
<p>Already, those who had assessed the situation, like Dubonnet, and those who had just realized, all stepped back without hesitation, bowing their heads as if their lives depended on it.</p>
<p>While it was a courtesy to have the Crown Prince before them, their attitude conveyed that this situation had nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>Their camaraderie was lighter than a dandelion seed in the wind.</p>
<p>“Tell me what I misunderstood.”</p>
<p>Julius’s cold expression and tone made Lamia tremble and her lips quiver.</p>
<p>“Everything… I haven’t… I haven’t hit the princess, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Princess? Is there a princess here?”</p>
<p>“Ah… Well, that… um…”</p>
<p>“The Lady knew it was the Princess, but still slapped her, didn’t she?”</p>
<p>“No! No, Your Majesty! I… It’s not like that…”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear it right now.” Julius knelt down and handed a handkerchief to Yanghwa, who was still shedding tears. “We’ll hear the details in private. Chushinik, escort the Lady.”</p>
<p>Faced with Julius’s resolute demeanor that didn’t leave room for Lamia’s explanations, I stopped patting Yanghwa’s back.</p>
<p>As I turned my head, I felt a hand gently encircling my shoulders. I noticed Kaichen giving me a slightly annoyed look.</p>
<p>“Get up already.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Because I had been kneeling, a tiny amount of moisture had seeped into the hem of my dress.</p>
<p>The dark blue dress was thick that the wetness wasn’t visible, but it was still uncomfortable to knelt on the ground.</p>
<p>Mimi had suggested wearing several layers of clothing underneath the dress for incidents like this. I disliked that idea and had worn only an underskirt.</p>
<p>As I stood up, nudged by Kaichen’s support, Lamia’s eyes widened as she was led away by Chushinik, as if under arrest.</p>
<p>“This, this can’t be…!” With that final scream, Lamia left.</p>
<p>Soon, Victor, the resident physician of the Manuwell dukedom, arrived. Yanghwa sat in a chair, receiving treatment with Julius’s support.</p>
<p>When they suggested that she should avoid her favorite sweet dessert for a while, as it might worsen the situation, she burst into tears again. This time, it seemed genuinely sorrowful.</p>
<p>Seeing Lady Dubonnet and other guests still bowing their heads like criminals, a sigh escaped my lips.</p>
<p>I approached Dubonnet slowly.</p>
<p>If this happened every time I attended a party or social event, it would be quite troublesome. I just wanted to exchange greetings, get to know some faces, and build connections, but this kind of chaos wasn’t my style.</p>
<p>However, ignoring women who had been part of high society for a long time wouldn’t be polite either.</p>
<p>Could we establish a relationship where we supported each other?</p>
<p>“Lady Tally,” I said.</p>
<p>“How can I help you…?”</p>
<p>Dubonnet raised her head, meeting my gaze directly.</p>
<p>She was certainly smarter than Lamia and had a strong sense of pride. Moreover, she knew how to assess situations and when to bow her head if needed.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve wronged you. We didn’t have a reason to embarrass each other like this, did we?”</p>
<p>“What are you trying to say exactly?”</p>
<p>“Just that we should get along.” I brushed aside my bangs with a satisfied smile. “There’s nothing wrong with that, right? Getting along.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Well then, enjoy the party. Thanks for coming to say hello first.”</p>
<p>Dubonnet’s expression subtly changed as I suggested leaving. While she might not have wanted to reconcile with Lamia after their confrontation today, she didn’t have much of a choice.</p>
<p>Overlooking minor disagreements and moving forward was part of high society etiquette.</p>
<p>I waved my hand lightly and turned to approach Yanghwa, who was grumbling to herself in the reception room.</p>
<p>Lamia and Dubonnet had passed like a storm, but dealing with Yanghwa would be the most challenging.</p>
<p><em>‘This is why not everyone can be a leading lady.’</em></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Naturally, since we couldn’t enjoy the party anymore, we left and returned to the mansion.</p>
<p>Duke Manuwell and Daimon stayed behind, as they couldn’t properly conclude the party they had meticulously prepared. As for the guests who were affected, Duran accompanied us back.</p>
