            <p><strong>Chapter 257</strong></p>
<p>“But you wouldn’t feel this way in the Black Rose Garden, huh?”</p>
<p>“How so? That place is beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I don’t know… Maybe…”</p>
<p>Perhaps there was no sense of mental calm and healing in that place. Maybe a party in the gloomy, overgrown, thorny Black Rose Garden wouldn’t attract anyone. It might be more fitting for a Halloween party.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have the right ambiance,” I said.</p>
<p>“The Black Rose Garden against the backdrop of a grand castle is sexy and alluring. That’s not a typical ambiance,” Yanghwa replied.</p>
<p>“Where did you learn that?”</p>
<p>“… Daliah, I’m not a child.”</p>
<p>‘How can anyone believe those words while you got cream on your lips?’ I narrowed my eyes and retrieved a handkerchief to wipe off the cream. “I don’t have any friends to invite,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m here! I’m here!”</p>
<p>“Um… Then we can skip the party and have tea time. Just the two of us.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, that sounds boring.”</p>
<p>The playful banter continued, mingling with the scent of lavender and the garden’s serenity.</p>
<p>“Don’t get too close to Azel, seriously,” I sighed deeply, propping my elbow on the table and resting my chin on my hand.</p>
<p>The three-tiered dessert tray filled with sweets was something Kaichen, who liked sugary treats, and Yanghwa, who had a sweet tooth, would enjoy.</p>
<p>I didn’t have much appetite because of the tight-fitting dress I was wearing. Regardless, I decided to enjoy the moment in leisure.</p>
<p>“Archmage! When did you arrive?” At that moment, a bright and cheerful voice rang out.</p>
<p>Judging from Kaichen’s subtly annoyed expression, I was sure the one calling me with a voice too loud for the occasion was the second son of Duke Manuwell, Duran.</p>
<p>I’d only seen him once and heard rumors of his popularity among women. He has it all with his highly handsome looks, pleasant smile, soft speech, impeccable manners, and promising future as the deputy commander of the Imperial Prince’s Guard.</p>
<p>Plus, his family was a rare ducal family in the empire, so it was almost impossible for him not to be popular. A newspaper had once conducted a humorous survey to determine the empire’s top five most eligible bachelors, and Duran confidently secured second place.</p>
<p>Considering that Julius, the Crown Prince with everything perfect about him, took the first place, I could grasp just how famous Duran was.</p>
<p>‘Daiman was third, Kaichen was fourth, and Chushinik was fifth.’ It was a rather silly survey, but Julius had teased Kaichen with it, even rolling on the floor laughing.</p>
<p>The rankings weren’t funny, but he laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world. He had teased Kaichen so much for ranking fourth.</p>
<p>Kaichen must have been conscious of his strong position. Moreover, they meticulously listed the reasons: not interested in women, cold towards women, intimidating, not affectionate, and so on.</p>
<p>Since the survey aimed to determine the best potential grooms, these reasons made sense. All those reasons had been valid until he met me, so Kaichen couldn’t refute them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it wasn’t strange to call Duran a second Julius. He was perfect in every aspect. Perhaps that was why, since my debut in the social scene, Kaichen strangely focused on Duran.</p>
<p>It was such a trivial ranking. Whichever way you looked at it, Kaichen was first.</p>
<p>Regardless, I couldn’t ignore him as he came to greet me, so I stood up from my seat and greeted him lightly. “We arrived just a little while ago. The garden is magnificent. Thank you for inviting me, Duke Duran.”</p>
<p>“It’s an honor just to have you here. If I had known you were coming, I would have greeted you myself… What a shame,” he replied.</p>
<p>“It’s all right. You must be busy with party preparations. There’s no need for that.”</p>
<p>“My older brother has taken care of all the preparations. My only duty is to stand guard… From now on, I’m free!”</p>
<p>“Ah… is that so? Well then, Duke, I hope you have a great time with your friends too.”</p>
<p>“Since I can see my friends often, I can spend time with them anytime. So today, I thought I’d spend time with someone else.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then I hope you have a wonderful time with that person.”</p>
<p>Duran smiled softly. Thinking that a smile like his was heartwarming, I was about to sit back down when he gently extended his hand toward his chest.</p>
<p>As his vibrant green hair swayed gently, mingling with the subtle scent of lavender in the air, I felt a sense of tranquility.</p>
<p>“If you’re still up for a garden tour, would you grant me the pleasure of guiding you, Countess?”</p>
<p>He slightly bowed, hand resting on his chest, and his long eyelashes so gracefully lowered that his request felt incredibly polite. Beside me, I heard Yanghwa’s characteristic remark, “Oh my, oh dear!” and I could feel Kaichen’s intense gaze burning into the back of my head.</p>
<p>‘The person he wants to have a good time with… is me.’</p>
<p>I realized why Kaichen had been so concerned about Duran. Was I that oblivious? Perhaps I had been so fixated on the attention I received from the young women who admired me rather than being attentive to other men.</p>
<p>Considering how annoyed I had been over the past week due to the jealousy I felt for Yanghwa, who was nursing her injuries, what would Kaichen feel when facing Duran, who so openly expressed his feelings, as if to say, “I like you!”?</p>
<p>It must be awful.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Duke. I want to explore the garden with my Master,” I replied as politely as I could.</p>
<p>“Ah… ah! Oh no, I must greet the Archmage now.”</p>
<p>As if only now realizing that Kaichen was here, he hastily saluted him with an awkward bow.</p>
