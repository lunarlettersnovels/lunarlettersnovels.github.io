            <h3><strong>Chapter 280</strong></h3>
<p>My thoughts had faded away, and I lost consciousness.</p>
<p>The next time I woke up, I was in a dream. I sighed deeply as I surveyed the familiar surroundings. I didn’t want to have this dream again. The familiar setting and the pungent smell made me furrow my brow.</p>
<p>Knowing what was about to happen made the pit of my stomach drop.</p>
<p>“We’ve caught the demon! Burn her! Burn her alive!”</p>
<p>“I can never forgive her… She’s not even human!”</p>
<p>“But… She’s a countess….”</p>
<p>“A Countess? Have you not seen what that demon has done?!”</p>
<p>“Lady Dalia would never do such things…”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you seen it with your own eyes, and you still say that? Demon or possessed, we must k!ll her!”</p>
<p>They were right. I had committed unspeakable crimes, so it didn’t matter if I was a demon or possesed by one, I deserved to die for the abominations I comitted.</p>
<p>I let out a wry laugh and found a corner to sit in. There was no way to escape from here anyway.</p>
<p>They would set this place on fire, and I would slowly lose my life while going through the agony of being burned alive. Dying from suffocating in toxic gas wasn’t pleasant either.</p>
<p>However, if I had to choose between burning or suffocating to death, I would choose the latter. Burning to death was horrific.</p>
<p>Crash! The sound echoed in the sparse room, and the ceiling collapsed.</p>
<p>I considered letting it fall on me so that I would lose consciousness. But this was a dream. The only thing I could do right now was to feel the agony until I choked to death.</p>
<p>There was a sudden banging noise as if someone was breaking down the door.</p>
<p>“Dalia!”</p>
<p>What… That couldn’t be… The voice calling my name… It was familiar.</p>
<p>But he<em> couldn’t</em> be in this dream… He should<em> never</em> appear in this dream. But seeing Kaichen break through the door and enter made my mouth opened in horror.</p>
<p>This couldn’t be happening!</p>
<p>It was the memory a hundred years that I had hidden most carefully. I was cautious not to let him find out, even if it were a dream.</p>
<p>How could he appear here?</p>
<p>Stricken, I just stood there with my mouth agape, and Kaichen, with trembling golden eyes, rushed towards me.</p>
<p>He held me in his arms; his embrace felt warmer than a raging fire. Unlike when I burned to death, the heat that spread to my spine was unbearable.</p>
<p>“I thought I had lost you.”</p>
<p>Whenever I regained consciousness and looked around, I found myself in that familiar room. It was a monotonous repetition. I wanted to assure him that he need not worry, as no matter how much I suffered, I wouldn’t die.</p>
<p>I had many things I wished to say, but for some reason, I couldn’t utter a word.</p>
<p>“To think you’re trying to save a demon!”</p>
<p>“Let’s k!ll her! k!ll them together!”</p>
<p>Something came flying through the broken door.</p>
<p>Even in the confined space where I was trapped, flames had already begun to rise. It now felt like I might burn to death rather than suffocate in the toxic gas.</p>
<p>When the object that had flown in hit the wall and shattered, liquid spilled out. The flames grew fiercer as they came into contact with it. It was alcohol with an extremely high alcohol content.</p>
<p>It was truly disgusting; it had never helped me from the beginning.</p>
<p>Kaichen held me tightly, shielding me from the flying debris. “Don’t worry, Dalia. I will protect you, no matter what.”</p>
<p>Normally, those words would make my heart race, and I would smile ruefully. But the current situation was different. Even though it was a dream, I didn’t want it. I wanted to push him away from me, but he wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>Then, Kaichen held my shoulders and gently pushed me back, softly kissing my forehead. His smiling face was beautiful, and I was captivated.</p>
<p>Thump. I suddenly became aware of a golden aura surrounding my body.</p>
<p>Thump. I realized my back was drenched, and I saw Kaichen’s back, also soaked, engulfed in the raging flames.</p>
<p>Thump. A shiver ran down my spine. Why? Why is this happening?!</p>
<p>I was relieved that I wasn’t hurt, but it felt like my heart would explode as I witnessed Kaichen facing the people’s anger all alone, smiling as if it were okay.</p>
<p>Breathing became difficult. Had I become intoxicated by the toxic gas? I wondered if I would suffocate soon, but my consciousness didn’t fade.</p>
<p>Why is my chest so tight? Why are you… Why?</p>
<p>How painful it must be to burn to death, how unbearable it must feel! <em>Thump!</em> Why are you saving me? We could leave together! <em>Thump! </em>Why would you make such a choice when you’re a powerful wizard? Why on earth?</p>
<p><em>Thump, thump!</em> I pounded on the golden barrier surrounding me as if trying to break it, but it remained intact. I could only watch Kaichen accept the flames as if he were accepting his fate. A scream tore out from my lips.</p>
<p>Why couldn’t I even make a sound? My voice didn’t come out as if it were tightly held by someone else.</p>
<p>I felt dizzy. My breath… I couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>Moans of agony escaped my lips, and the world briefly went dark.</p>
