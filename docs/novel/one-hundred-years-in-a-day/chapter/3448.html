            <p><strong>Chapter 75</strong></p>
<p>“They all look like something a princess would wear.” I shook my head as I pulled on my pants and buttoned the shirt. As I folded up my sleeves, I saw the bracelets Kaichen had given me. They made no sound. They were so light I wouldn’t even have known they were there. Suddenly the room felt too stuffy so I unbuttoned the first two buttons on the top of my shirt to free my neck. I stood in front of the mirror, examining myself. I was satisfied. I had gained weight and for once my body looked healthy and nice. I didn’t look like I was a corpse anymore.</p>
<p>“For once I’m in great shape!” I murmured in the mirror. Dalia was indeed beautiful. When I possessed her body for the first time, I used to stare at it in the mirror for a long while before going for a shower. Of course, it was the initial shock of finding myself in a different body but also feeling sorry for what Dalia had become and what she could have been.</p>
<p>A big chest, narrow waist, wide pelvis and plump hips. Every time I looked at myself or Dalia, I was amazed. I reminded myself that it was my body now but sometimes, it didn’t feel like it.</p>
<p><em>It’s my body now! </em>I reemphasized. I tried to erase my past life from my mind. I was satisfied and happy with my current body and my present life. Just unbuttoning a few buttons made me feel like I was confident about my body. I looked at myself, smiled and decided to head out. I picked up my bag and suddenly a thought crossed my mind.</p>
<p><em>Why didn’t I choose to wear loose clothes like I usually do? Why is my heart fluttering so much? You are crazy! </em>I scolded myself. Just then my eyes met Kaichen’s. I was reminded of first dates when I used to be all fluttery and nervous and cared to look pretty from head to toe. I was on my way to deal with a traumatic event happening in the state, so why care about how I dress?</p>
<p>There was no turning back anyway. So, I straightened, braced myself and approached Kaichen. His eyebrows went up as he looked at me. I was so nervous. The hair in front which used to be messy but at least covered half my vision and protected me somehow was gone. I could see him very clearly and he could see me. His intense gaze was difficult. <em>Get a hold of yourself! You are supposed to be bold and shameless! </em>I raised the corners of my mouth into a smile.</p>
<p>“Teacher, I am a little late, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>“That’s alright,” he said, “Did you cut your hair?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! It’s getting very hot, isn’t it? I couldn’t bear to have them fall on my face anymore.” That was a lie. But it served the purpose. Kaichen stared at me a little longer. Our eyes met. He quickly turned away. I wondered what would happen if we just looked at each other’s eyes a little longer. But I felt relieved that he averted his gaze. It was making me nervous.</p>
<p>“Then, shall we go?” I asked brightly. The cheery demeanor was inappropriate for someone going to see sick people but I didn’t know what to do. Kaichen took the lead without a word. I watched his back. His blonde hair was even more dazzling today.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Kaichen looked at Julius’ floating form in the air through the magical communication tool. He didn’t speak but narrowed his holographic eyes at Kaichen, sighing occasionally and shaking his head.</p>
<p>“What is it exactly?” asked Kaichen, annoyed.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“If you have something to say, say it,” said Kaichen. “If not, this is a waste of magic.” He fumbled for the ring on his hand to cut off the communication but Julius spoke.</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare cut me off,” said Julius. “Are you really going to accept her as your disciple? You said it was just a temporary thing.”</p>
<p>“I’ve said it three times already that yes, I am accepting her as my disciple.”</p>
<p>“It’s just… hard to believe,” said Julius with a chuckle. He muttered something to himself. Kaichen was annoyed that his habit of talking to himself was still intact.</p>
<p>“What’s so hard to believe?” said Kaichen indifferently, as though it didn’t matter to him either way.</p>
<p>Julius spread three fingers in the air. “First of all, it is just unbelievable for <em>you </em>to take anyone as a disciple. You didn’t want anyone at all. You hated interacting with people. You said they would be a nuisance when it came to your magic research.”</p>
<p>“Dalia has talent,” said Kaichen. “She woke her mana herself. You and I both know that was close to impossible until she did it.”</p>
<p>“Wow,” said Julius mockingly. “It is so weird to hear compliments from your mouth.” Julius curled another finger. “Anyway, second point, the person you just happen to accept into your tutelage is Countess Alshine of all people you could have picked!”</p>
<p>Kaichen didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“You hated her, didn’t you?” asked Julius. “That’s what you told me.”</p>
<p>Kaichen crossed his arms across his chest. “I have changed my mind. Is that so shocking?”</p>
<p>“As expected,” said Julius, “It’s a love-hate relationship, isn’t it? Your first love suddenly appeared in front of you and your hatred and your resolve was shaken. She won your heart.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that!” said Kaichen.</p>
<p>“That’s exactly how I see it. I mean love and hate can mess up a person so I guess I understand.”</p>
