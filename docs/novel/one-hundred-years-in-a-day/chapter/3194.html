            <h3><strong>Chapter 330</strong></h3>
<p><em>‘Well… he would have told me to wear it even if it was hot as hell.’</em></p>
<p>It was the day of the founding festival, and as I had to be there, donning the robes with various protective features was a necessity. No one knew what Exchetra would do.</p>
<p>Despite all the worry and anxiety, I surprisingly felt calm as the day arrived.</p>
<p>After all, this was Exchetra’s chessboard, and we were mere pawns moved at her discretion. No matter how hard I tried to fight, I couldn’t catch up with her. She had been preparing for a very long time.</p>
<p>That was the fundamental difference between me and Exchetra. I couldn’t keep up with her p[pace, and unlike me, she had a sharp mind.</p>
<p>However, I wasn’t ready to throw in the towel; I couldn’t let things go her way forever.</p>
<p>“Master!”</p>
<p>I waved enthusiastically at Kaichen, who looked magnificent in his gold-embroidered robes. It had been a while since I saw his magnificent robe. Come to think of it, wasn’t the first time I saw it during the time I confessed?</p>
<p>I smiled, recalling that day. I leaped to my feet and grabbed his arm. Kaichen’s eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p>“You’re going to fall over,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m not a kid,” I replied, pouting.</p>
<p>“Even adults fall when they run down the stairs three steps at a time.”</p>
<p>“It’s because I can’t wait to come near Master.”</p>
<p>Kaichen sighed. After a brief moment, he raised his hand to run his fingers through my hair, then lowered it when he saw my locks were styled in beautiful waves.</p>
<p>“My hair is beautiful today so please don’t ruin it.”</p>
<p>“OKay.”</p>
<p>The corners of his mouth twitched. I wanted to joke about it, but the carriage approached just in time, so I climbed in.</p>
<p>As soon as we left the mansion, I looked out the window and saw a huge crowd. A yearly festival would be big and colorful, but I couldn’t imagine the splendor of a festival held once every five years.</p>
<p>There were so many people from all over the empire; it’s no wonder. It lasted for a month, but there was only one day when the eclipse began, and on the same day the prayer ceremony was held.</p>
<p>So that was today, and since it was the highlight of the festival, it drew the largest crowd in the month.</p>
<p>The good news was that the sidewalks were separated from the carriage paths, and only nobles were allowed to enter the Imperial Palace altar where the prayer ceremony occurred.</p>
<p>I was worried that the roads would be packed with carriages, and we’d be stuck in traffic, but luckily that didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Usually, the nobles attending the ceremony go to a ball at the palace the night before and then stay overnight in the palace’s private villa. Some nobles who have mansions in Heulin would go home that night and come directly to the altar the next day. Still, most would choose to spend the night in the private villa.</p>
<p>The reason given was that it was necessary to show respect to the previous royalty.</p>
<p>When I first heard such a tradition from Julius, I gave him a rotten smile and said it was nonsense. Julius shook his head in reply.</p>
<p>Of course, Kaichen and I didn’t go to the ball. With the uncertainty and anxiety of what would happen at the festival, we couldn’t afford to be at the Imperial Palace. More aptly put, the villain’s lair.</p>
<p>Julius understood, and many nobles who followed him were also absent from the ball. As a result, there was a lot of uneasy behavior in this year’s Founding Festival.</p>
<p>Julius and Kaichen had heard of the Fouding Festival, but turns out,  it was their first time attending. This was understandable, considering that Julius had just become the Crown Prince.</p>
<p>Normally, the Crown Prince would perform the prayer ceremony, but since Julius had never been to a Founding Festival before, the experienced Princess Exchetra would perform the ceremony.</p>
<p>He insisted that it couldn’t be changed, even by the aristocrats on Julius’ side.</p>
<p>At the very least, the prayer ceremony at the imperial altar on the eclipse is sacred, and there can be no mistakes. If the prayer ends without any accidents, then the Kalhai Empire’s next five years will be secure.</p>
<p>Julius’ expression as he shared the news was one of resignation. When I asked him why he believed in such a thing, he mentioned that the current emperor had made a mistake in the past during a prayer ritual and lost Julius.</p>
<p>It was a misunderstanding that occurred as history was twisted, distorted, and interrupted amid numerous wars.</p>
<p>The prayer ceremony performed at the Founding Festival was not intended to honor the previous royalty, nor was it intended to bring disaster to the Kalhai Empire if a mistake was made. Anyone who knows the truth knows that the prayer ritual is for the Blue Dragon.</p>
<p>Exchetra wanted to test if she could hear the voice of the Blue Dragon. She would use this ritual to summon the Blue Dragon.</p>
<p>The thought made me feel apprehensive.</p>
<p>“Why is your expression like that again?” Kaichen said, breaking me from my thoughts.</p>
<p>“Wh-what? What’s wrong with my face?” I replied.</p>
<p>“You look like you’d rather see a cockroach.”</p>
<p>“Master, you know I have an aversion to their many legs..”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Kaichen said with a nonchalant face.</p>
<p>“That’s exactly what your expression looks like right now.”</p>
