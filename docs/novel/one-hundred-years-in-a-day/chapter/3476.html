            <p><strong>Chapter 48</strong></p>
<p>“The ingredients from Dalia’s blood were not common. You can’t find it just anywhere. Isn’t there only one person capable of collecting these ingredients and combining them into a highly efficient poison?”</p>
<p>“Anteresse?” Julius muttered with a solemn face. His face was stiff, and his attitude wasn’t his signature cheery self. Kaichen swatted Julius’ hand from his shoulders and scowled at the name.</p>
<p>“If he is involved, it will not end with Dalia alone.”</p>
<p>Julius nodded. “That was why I had to come personally. If that is true, you and I both know who could have planned this.”</p>
<p>Kaichen nodded. “Dalia would have been a good subject for their experiment to test all ingredients at once.”</p>
<p>“I think so, too. I am just glad she didn’t go entirely crazy.”</p>
<p>Kaichen couldn’t share his relief. <em>Did she really not go crazy? </em>There were a lot of questions in his mind but as Julius said, it was indeed a relief that she was alive. Kaichen was surprised at that thought and turned to Julius highly annoyed.</p>
<p>“If you just wanted to check, you could have waited. Why did you follow us?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… because I wanted to. It seemed like you two were having so much fun together.” Julius turned to kaichen with a smirk. “And how could I have missed this? You being swayed by her. Wouldn’t miss it for the world.”</p>
<p>Kaichen rolled his eyes at Julius, and turned to look at Dalia, who had moved to a different store and was having yet another conversation with the vendor of the shop. Kaichen thought Julius and Dalia were similar in their ability to annoy him to no end.</p>
<p>“By the way, what does she mean by ‘teacher’?” asked Julius.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Did you accept the Countess as your disciple?”</p>
<p>“It’s just temporary.”</p>
<p>“Now this is really surprising! I don’t think my heart can handle any more surprises.” Julius looked at Dalia, then at Kaichen. “What did I tell you about being swayed? The most powerful archmage who had never, I repeat, NEVER, accepted anyone as a disciple has finally done it! Countess Alshine must be really powerful! Do-er of the impossible.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing like that.”</p>
<p>“You must have taken her as your disciple since you are interested in her ability.”</p>
<p>“It’s just something temporary.”</p>
<p>“Hm… ‘temporary’. Even if it is temporary, you gave her the authority to mention you as her teacher.”</p>
<p>It was always a norm for any wizard to reveal the name of their teacher. It helped them establish themselves in the magical hierarchy. Kaichen and Julius were disciples of Matabju. Only the two of them were ever accepted as the disciple of Matabju on the continent.</p>
<p>Julius had never taken a disciple. He was the Crown Prince so it would be a complicated process. And Kaichen had never wanted to. He was the strongest archmage in the continent, but he wasn’t a people person.</p>
<p>Numerous people had sought to become Kaichen’s disciples, but he had never coe out of his lab on the top floor of the pagoda. When people had pestered him, he had retreated to his house which no one knew about except Julius, and now Dalia. He would disappear at lengths at a time. Sometimes for weeks, maybe months.</p>
<p>Even if he was temporary, Julius immediately wanted to run to the top of the tower and tell his teacher Hamal, that Kaichen had now become a teacher.</p>
<p>Julius wanted to run to his teacher and tell him that the great recluse, kaichen, had finally found a disciple. Kaichen anticipated this. “You better not,” he said.</p>
<p>“What?” said Julius, innocently.</p>
<p>“If you tell anyone, I will disappear to a place where even you cannot find me ever again.” Kaichen smiled an evil smile. “You need my help solving this problem.”</p>
<p>“Is that a threat?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it is.”</p>
<p>“You are so mean,” said Julius, “I am just glad you have a student.”</p>
<p>“I know how ‘glad’ you are. Always trying to find a reason to pull my leg at any possible moment.”</p>
<p>Julius smiled, nudging Kaichen on the shoulder. “Tell me. Countess Alshine is your first love, isn’t she? I can’t believe you accepted her as your disciple. What were you even thinking?”</p>
<p>“She isn’t my ‘first love’.”</p>
<p>“I remember you bawling your eyes out every night thinking about her. You were frustrated, then sad and wrote hundreds of love letters…”</p>
<p>“Just shut up!” said Kaichen, shoving Julius away from him. “You can blabber to yourself; I am going to disappear right now.” For god measure, he also summoned some magic lights.</p>
<p>Julius waved his hands. “Alright. Alright,” he said hurriedly, “Don’t leave. I need you. I won’t do it again.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t true and Kaichen knew it. Julius was the Crown Prince and his sheepishness had not changed. He was always the troublemaker. People using honorifics didn’t change that. He just smiled and brushed it away.</p>
<p>“Teacher!” said Dalia, panting and running towards them. “Don’t leave me here!” She had seen kaichen summon magic and had assumed he was leaving.</p>
<p>Kaichen had a strong urge to disappear to somewhere where no one knew him. And he did just that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Kaichen’s mood suddenly took a plunge when Julius impeded in the middle. I glanced cautiously from the shops to where he was standing with Julius. The displeasure was clear on his face.</p>
<p><em>If I annoy him even more, it would be hazardous</em>. I saw Julius giggle and look towards me. Kaichen’s face stiffened and he looked at Julius with a murderous gaze. He then summoned his magic and disappeared.</p>
<p>“Countess, did you hear what he just said?”</p>
<p>“I thought he told you to shut up.”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess you have a good ear.” Julius glanced awkwardly at me. “Then did you hear what I said?”</p>
