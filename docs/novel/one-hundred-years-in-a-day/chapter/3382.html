<p><strong>Chapter 141</strong></p>
<p><em>Why is he so angry? </em>I realized Kaichen was suddenly in a very bad mood. Unlike me who fights more with words, Kaichen was sensitive and prickly. He didn’t tolerate nonsense. He wasn’t easily offended, and he hated fights because it was a nuisance. I was actually surprised to see him stepping in as if he was ready for a fight. It was scary when he was really offended or angry.</p>
<p>“I know this might seem discourteous. But I do insist that there is a much more polite way of turning down someone who was only requesting for some understanding,” said Chushinick.</p>
<p>“If you know this is discourteous, and you have already been turned down, why are you trying to drag it out when someone has clearly refused your ‘request’?”</p>
<p>Chushinick seemed at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“You talked about basic aristocratic manners. Where did you learn the manners of a nobleman who comes to a public place, barges in and demands someone leave from the table when they aren’t done with their food?” said Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Is it okay for someone to intrude on other people’s time and ‘request’ for an understanding and drag it out if they refuse? Forcing them to accept a reward for your ‘request’ and demanding they be polite as they refuse is something done by aristocrats?” asked Kaichen icily.</p>
<p>Chushinick was speechless. I thought they would recognize Kaichen but I was surprised none of them did. He had only changed the color of his hair and eyes. How was it possible that they didn’t recognize him at all? He looked the same anyway. Chushinick clenched his fists as if his pride had been hurt by Kaichen’s words. But Kaichen wasn’t finished yet.</p>
<p>“There seems to be a misunderstanding so only one person should apologize?” he continued. “How do you know there has been a misunderstanding? You just arrived now. Have you even considered the fact that maybe you don’t know the whole situation? Or are noblemen exempted from thinking critically?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you being a little too harsh?” said Chushinick, raising his voice.</p>
<p>It was intimidating enough for me, but Kaichen didn’t even blink. “I had heard that you were a loyal and trustworthy hound by the Crown Prince’s side. But you just seem like a silly bear cub that sways where the wind blows.”</p>
<p>“What?! Are you trying to pick a fight with me?’ thundered Chushinick, no longer able to restrain his anger.</p>
<p>I stepped in, not wanting to make Kaichen angrier. “Look, you came here insisting that there was a misunderstanding. But we were never really asked to show our understanding in the first place. She barged in here and started shouting at us,” I said, trying to explain the situation.</p>
<p>“Are you lying again?! I can’t trust your nonsense anymore!”</p>
<p>“Ha, you really are so rude. Calling me a liar when this woman barged in and demanded we leave the place!”</p>
<p>“Lady Sorel wouldn’t do something like that!” Chushinick, who had already fallen for Lamia’s tears, refused to listen. I felt frustrated. I wanted to take back my opinion of him. He wasn’t honest and just, he was just gullible and lacked a brain. Kaichen was right. He was just a silly bear cub.</p>
<p>“You don’t seem to be able to understand human language, so that’s enough,” said Kaichen to Chushinick.</p>
<p>“T-Teacher,” I stammered.</p>
<p>“Dalia,” said Kaichen firmly. My shoulders drooped and I stepped aside. I had started the fight because I couldn’t stand injustice. But maybe I had also wanted to avenge Kaichen for Lamia’s lies of the past. It was a fight I had started but ended up getting Kaichen involved.</p>
<p>As things got messier, I clutched at Kaichen’s sleeve. This wasn’t Acrab. This was Heulin. I had no power here. Marquis Sorel was an important noble who was powerful enough to leave a dent on Julius’ power if he wanted. As my excitement and mischief faded, my heart felt heavy.</p>
<p><em>I have been so foolish! </em>I felt guilty and sorry for dragging Kaichen into this. He always took care of my mess. He is the Archmage and he has a disciple like me, who always creates trouble.</p>
<p>“Don’t make that face,” he said.</p>
<p>“I should have just let it slide,” I said regretfully.</p>
<p>“And if you had?”</p>
<p>“There wouldn’t have been a fight like this.”</p>
<p>“Even if you had held back, that woman would have gone to another table and done the same thing,” he said.</p>
<p>I thought he didn’t remember her, but it seems he did. I couldn’t help but feel a little knot of jealousy in my stomach.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Teacher. I get in trouble every time… I am so pathetic.” For the two years we had been together in Acrab, Kaichen had always been by my side. Maybe that was why I had become so dependent and taken everything for granted.</p>
