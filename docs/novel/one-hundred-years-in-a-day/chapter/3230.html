            <h3><strong>Chapter 294</strong></h3>
<p>Because it was so obvious and mundane, Exchetra said I was just entertainment to her. I, too, had the same thought.</p>
<p>Maybe I read too many novels.</p>
<p>Whether it was a reincarnation novel or a comic, it was all the same. I thought I had to do the same. I thought I had to follow the original story.</p>
<p>As if it were a rule or something.</p>
<p>“Are you insane?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, damn it. I told you to release it today…”</p>
<p>“Would she survive if you do?”</p>
<p>“That’s why I said do it in moderation!”</p>
<p>“Did I?! Am I the only one who did it?!”</p>
<p>Their words, which had been murmured, gradually became more apparent.</p>
<p>“First, let’s untie her arms and legs. If we just dump her anywhere, who’s going to come and rescue her?”</p>
<p>“Tsk… this woman has no luck.”</p>
<p>After all, I was taken by their leader. I couldn’t help but sneer at that.</p>
<p>What if they were knights of the imperial palace? I felt whatever conscience I had left, which I thought would be challenging to deal with, disappear entirely.</p>
<p>My suspicion that it was a hideout was correct.</p>
<p>The gruesome things tightly bound on my hands and feet fell off with a clatter.</p>
<p>“…Ah… cough!”</p>
<p>When I tried to clear my throat, something hot surged up. It was blackened and charred and came out along with bloody phlegm.</p>
<p>I stared at it in a daze.</p>
<p>For the first time, I was thankful that I had learned magic from Kaichen. If not, I wouldn’t have known what the blackened and charred lump that I had vomited up was.</p>
<p>“Ah… haha! Amazing.”</p>
<p>I was filled with pure admiration. Since I had nightmares whenever I closed my eyes, all I could think about was what Exchetra had done to my body while I was unconscious.</p>
<p>“What is this?!”</p>
<p>“Are you dying?”</p>
<p>The men exclaimed as if in disgust. I ignored them as they took hesitant steps backward.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and flexed my fingers. Fortunately, I could move reasonably well except for my left leg, which I couldn’t feel.</p>
<p>My trembling body brought me intense pain even when I breathed, but I was able to endure these three days because it was nothing to the pain when I spent a century suffering all kinds of torture.</p>
<p>I slowly got up and grabbed the charred lump I had vomited out. The squishy lump seemed to wriggle, making it look grotesque.</p>
<p>How long had I been carrying this in my body? To the point of it being this charred.</p>
<p>Kaichen said that he had completely removed all the toxins from the venom using the antidote.</p>
<p>But since it was an extremely toxic and a special poison with five venoms mixed that could turn any man insane, he repeatedly emphasized that I had to keep taking the antidote.</p>
<p><em>‘Fool, you could have just told me honestly.’</em></p>
<p>Kaichen knew about the presence of the black lump in my body. He knew it needed to be removed for my body to completely return to normal.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t remove it.</p>
<p>It’s not that he didn’t know how; he probably didn’t remove it because it might risk shattering my sanity. He chose to detoxify it as much as possible and keep it a secret from me because he valued me.</p>
<p>But after Exchetra found out that it was still in my body, she used her hand again. Hoping for the horrific poison that tormented me for a hundred years to seize me again.</p>
<p>I knew she was a terrific woman, but I couldn’t help but admire her anew.</p>
<p>You don’t miss a single detail.</p>
<p>Kwaack! Pow!</p>
<p>Without hesitation, I clenched my fist tightly, and the blackened lump burst.</p>
<p>I had wondered from the beginning why I couldn’t use magic properly. I could sense my mana, but it wouldn’t move as I wished.</p>
<p>Looking back, Kaichen said that for magic to work, a wizard’s mental state had to support it. You couldn’t use magic with a shattered mind.</p>
<p>My mental state was so wrecked seeing Kaichen’s death. Despite having the magic to run away, I had become a fool who couldn’t use magic.</p>
<p>Exchetra bound me up like this without even using much force.</p>
<p><em>‘Haha… What’s all this?’</em></p>
<p>There was no point in cursing myself, although I was indeed a d@mn idiot. I blinked my eyes slowly.</p>
<p>I glanced at the black lump that had splattered everywhere, looking like black blood. This <em>thing</em> was inside my body for a century and even a few more.</p>
<p>I don’t know how I was able to spit it out on my own, but at least there was nothing left in my body that would devour my sanity.</p>
<p>My body hurt terribly, but my mind was clearer than ever.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and exhaled. I felt the pain as my lungs shrank, but the corners of my mouth naturally curled up due to the clear mind.</p>
<p>I raised the hand covered in black blood. A pleasant breeze swept through, and I casually wiped the blood off my clothes. I stuck out my tongue and licked my lower lip.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it too princess-like to wait quietly to be rescued at a time like this?”</p>
<p>As I whispered, black rose petals fluttered in the wind.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Asta sensed Turbuea’s time magic was broken and returned to the hideout to free Dalia Alshine.</p>
<p>It was a shabby house set up by the Momalhaut faction to deceive the onlooker’s eyes.</p>
<p>Although it looked run-down on the outside, the vast underground space connected to it was, in reality, the largest Momolhot hiding place in Huelin.</p>
<p>There was only one entrance in the form of a dilapidated house, but there were several exits with imbued teleportation magic that allowed you to leave.</p>
<p>Asta opened the basement door and walked through the hallway to carry out her given orders, and Asta felt strange. Almost eerie.</p>
<p>He should be dragging Dalia Alshine out with him.</p>
