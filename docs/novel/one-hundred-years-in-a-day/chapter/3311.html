            <p><strong>Chapter 212</strong></p>
<p>When Kaichen raised his other hand with a serious expression at the strong wave of magic that seemed to contaminate the world around us, I slowly parted my lips.</p>
<p>“It’s alright, Master,” I said.</p>
<p>Kaichen didn’t respond, but instead, golden light shimmered through my blurry vision.</p>
<p>I remembered that even in the darkness, he came to save me. I know that even if the black magic swallowed the brilliant golden light, his light would never go out.</p>
<p>I saw Kaichen covering my cheek and wiping away my bloody tears.</p>
<p><em>‘Still, let me protect you,</em>’ I thought.</p>
<p>Soon, the magical energy that looked like it was swallowing everything up disappeared in a fog. The screaming and ringing in my ears were gone.</p>
<p>I let out a heavy, cold breath, trying to suppress how terrible I felt. I put my hand over Kaichen’s and nuzzled my cheek into the palm of his hand and closed my eyes. My cold body clamored for just a little bit of his warmth.</p>
<p>“Stay by my side, Master,” I said.</p>
<p>My face might have looked ugly with tears of blood. He could even break out in cold sweat if he smelled it-get goosebumps at my ominous magical energy. Still, it was alright. This man would stay by my side no matter what. No matter how ugly I became, he wouldn’t go back on his word of protecting me.</p>
<p>“Master… Please hug me.”</p>
<p>At my request for a hug, Kaichen hugged me tightly without a word. I felt so touched that the tip of my nose felt cold, so I wrapped myself around his back. Bu then, Kaichen groaned as I wrapped my legs around his waist like an octopus.</p>
<p>“Master, I want to wash up,” I said. I felt uncomfortable with my face stained with bloody tears and my body drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p>I could hear Kaichen sigh above my head. “What on earth are you asking us to do,” he said.</p>
<p>“Move, please,” I said. “Then, should we wash up together?”</p>
<p>“Dalia,” he said.</p>
<p>“You said you’d stay by my side,” I reminded him as I buried my face in his chest and mumbled.</p>
<p>Kaichen let out another sigh over the top of my head. I was being childish, but I could hear his heart thump, and I felt like I was about to let out a giggle. His heart, that had been chilled to the bone in the north, had melted.</p>
<p>Kaichen stood up without difficulty as I clung on to him. As I wrapped my arms around his neck and laughed like an idiot, Kaichen clicked his tongue slowly.</p>
<p>“You seem to be the only child here,” he said, as he headed towards the bathroom. The nape of his neck had subtly turned red.</p>
<p>As the sound of flowing water filled the room, I clung to Kaichen, not wanting to let go. He hugged me back and we both soaked in the bathtub together.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to take your clothes off?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll just let it be,” Kaichen replied, frowning and looking away.</p>
<p>As I allowed the hot water to melt away the cold in my body, I noticed that the nape of Kaichen’s neck was still red as he entered the water, allowing his clothes to become wet.</p>
<p>“Master, you can at least perform magic that takes people’s clothes off,” I said, playfully.</p>
<p>He tightened his grip on my waist and my wet clothes clung to my body, revealing my curves.</p>
<p>I leaned in and kissed his blushing nape lovingly, “We’re supposed to wash up together. Who even wears clothes while bathing?”</p>
<p>“Dalia, why are you always…” Kaichen stopped himself halfway, hurriedly pulling his gaze away from me and gently biting his lower lip.</p>
<p>“It won’t end with just washing up,” he said in a low, menacing tone. He was warning me to stop and be quiet.</p>
<p>But I didn’t stop, instead I leaned in closer and whispered, “Master, if I really only wanted to wash up, would I have come in here together with you?”</p>
<p>I placed my lips on the nape of his stiff, red neck and used my tongue, making him groan. Kaichen’s hand that was wrapped around my waist twitched and tightened. It seemed that he was trying to be patient again, as he didn’t push me away or remove his hand from my waist.</p>
<p>Even when we first slept together in the north, Kaichen had been patient with me. I couldn’t understand why he always acted that way. The kisses grew deeper.</p>
<p>“Haa,” Kaichen breathed, his warm breath blowing against my skin. I could feel him becoming ar*used under me, even though he was still wearing wet clothes.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to rush things or push me too far, even though I could feel his desire through his clothes. He had always put my needs before his own, even back when I discovered the truth and was in shock.</p>
<p><em>‘You’re foolishly kind,’</em> I thought to myself.</p>
<p>I knew that in the original story, Kaichen had no interest in his lover and never hugged her, even though she was a germaphobe and was often with the promiscuous Julius.</p>
<p>Perhaps that day in the north was his first time as well… I couldn’t believe how skilled he was in bed.</p>
<p>Kaichen licked my plump bre*sts. He hugged me around my waist, and grabbed my chin with one hand. His golden eyes were burning with passion.</p>
<p>“This time… I won’t hold back,” he growled, his words meant for me alone.</p>
<p>Kaichen lifted my chin and attacked my lips, swallowing me whole. His soft tongue slipped between my parted lips, as if he had been waiting for this moment. He invaded my mouth without hesitation, his tongue wrapping around mine and sucking it.</p>
<p>“Ngh,” I m*aned, unable to catch my breath.</p>
<p>A soft m*an escaped my lips. Kaichen’s hands danced along my back, each touch igniting a flurry of goosebumps that tingled along my spine. His fingers traced patterns along my skin, as if he were counting each vertebrae one by one.</p>
<p>My body trembled beneath his touch, and even as his lips met mine in a searing kiss, I could sense the hint of a smile playing on his lips.</p>
