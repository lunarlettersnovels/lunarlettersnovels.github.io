            <h3><strong>Chapter 323</strong></h3>
<p>I felt irritated the whole time I was forced to read the book. The worldbuilding was ridiculous, and the protagonist’s unconditional ‘kindness’ made my insides churn.</p>
<p>It was quite long, and with prequels, it took longer to read than I had initially thought. It was boring and irritating. But I had to endure it because, when I went to school, I had to chat and laugh with friends who excitedly talked about it.</p>
<p>But now, how should I accept being ‘Exchetra,’ a character and villain from the novel?</p>
<p>The worries didn’t last as long as I thought.</p>
<p>I transmigrated at the point when Exchetra secretly started gathering the rebellion force called ‘Momalhaut’ to kill the protagonist Julius. Moreover, she discovered a way to rapidly increase magical power using forbidden dark magic.</p>
<p>Black magic sucks the magical energy naturally possessed by humans and was taboo to the extent that even black magicians were reluctant to use it. Exchetra had no talent for magic, but rather than give up, she broke the taboo for her strength.</p>
<p>Momalhaut, both dangerous and useful like a double-edged sword, was a great help to Exchetra in the original work. ‘Exchetra’ had already learned black magic as the head of Momalhaut by hiding her identity.</p>
<p>Now that I am Exchetra, would Julius have the same happy ending in the book?</p>
<p>Not at all. It was too late to change the course. Exchetra had crossed an irreversible river.</p>
<p>If only I had come on the day Julius was born… no, even if that happened, would I have spared him?</p>
<p>A sly smile escaped. No, I wouldn’t have.</p>
<p>The Exchetra in her memories had once said she wouldn’t let others handle her affairs, but she handed the task of the assassination of the newborn Julius to someone else.</p>
<p>Despite being half-blooded siblings, she couldn’t bring herself to kill her newborn brother directly.</p>
<p>Pathetic.</p>
<p>Exchetra looked to her mother, if it were me, I would have killed him herself.</p>
<p>A chill passed through my body. I closed my eyes lightly.</p>
<p>Killing a person in the world doesn’t immediately become a ‘crime.’</p>
<p><em>‘Do you want to kill someone?’</em></p>
<p>Yes, madly. I want to see them kneeling at my feet, begging with tears and snot, desperately begging for their lives.</p>
<p>In the original story, Exchetra ultimately met a tragic death at the hands of Julius. I don’t have thoughts of dying like that.</p>
<p>It would be an easy task to find and kill him, still just a newborn baby. So, wouldn’t it be better just to kill him now?</p>
<p>That’s true. But I wanted to see it.</p>
<p>I wanted to see him, the sickeningly ‘kind’ one, on his knees, crying and begging for his life.</p>
<p>It’s not worth doing it right away; it would be futile. That fulfilling end would be nowhere to be seen. I want to experience a greater and more ecstatic sensation rather than fulfilling immediate impulses and feeling a petty thrill.</p>
<p>‘I will become the emperor.’</p>
<p>The desire of ‘Exchetra’ came to mind. So, as she fervently wished, I would adhere to the role.</p>
<p>My past life as Guwon was a monotonous and colorless existence. In this life, I would make myself joyful, vivid, and diverse.</p>
<p>A few years later, when the grown Julius reclaimed his status and became the crown prince, my long-awaited expectation had come true.</p>
<p>“Sister… do you want to become the emperor?” A young Julius asked me.</p>
<p>I quirked a brow at him and smiled. “Why are you asking such a thing?” I replied.</p>
<p>“Although I have become the Crown Prince, this position was originally yours.”</p>
<p>“You… think you took what was mine.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Why? Why do you think that way?”</p>
<p>“… Because my sister was here before me.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, Julius,” I laughed.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Why are you so kind… If you don’t think that it’s yours, you will lose all the precious people who care about you.”</p>
<p>“What… are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“If you want to protect something precious, you must become more ruthless. It’ll be more interesting for both of us when I deal with you.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness…?”</p>
<p>“Will you be stupid and foolish like your father, or kind and worrisome like your mother?” I pondered out loud, then looked at him. “Be more cunning, Julius. To grow, you need to. Don’t disappoint me, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>I was excited to see the future. A thrilling sensation spread to every fingertip, and my throat felt dry. Having eagerly prepared for a long time, I finally saw this face.</p>
<p>I smiled contentedly, gently patting Julius’s shoulder, and gracefully walked away.</p>
<p>It would be great if everyone had faces twisted like that!</p>
