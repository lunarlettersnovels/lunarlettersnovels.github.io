            <h3><strong>Chapter 283</strong></h3>
<p>I no longer wanted to open my eyes. Countless times, I had witnessed Kaichen attempting to save me, only to watch him die before my eyes, and it drained me of the will to shed tears.</p>
<p>Could this be a dream? Could my anxiety conjure up such a vivid nightmare?</p>
<p>Ironically, my initial doubts stemmed from a desire to avoid witnessing Kaichen’s death in my dreams, even though I knew it was just a dream.</p>
<p>I knew it was a dream, yet it was excruciating to endure.</p>
<p>I cried, wailed, resented, and cursed, but nothing ever changed.</p>
<p>Kaichen always stood before me, vowing to protect me and reassuring me not to worry.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Stop saving me.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>I’m not worth saving.</p>
<p>Please, please, Master.</p>
<p>During this desperate plea for relief, I finally woke up from the nightmare, more terrifying than anything I could imagine. It was as though my mind, sinking into that abyss, was forcibly pulled back to reality.</p>
<p>“Ugh… Cough! Ugh…!”</p>
<p>As repulsive as it was, I vomited everything I could onto the ground. Judging by the sight before me, I may have even vomited blood. I lacked the strength to lift a finger.</p>
<p>I believed I had drifted into sleep due to the cold, but it seemed that something had been done to my body. This was probably why I had such a grotesque dream.</p>
<p>The first things I faintly saw through my blurred vision were gruesome torture devices.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah… How horrifying.’</em></p>
<p>In my previous life, I had indulged in all sorts of manga, novels, animations, and movies, regardless of the genre. I didn’t have any particular aversions, except for one – gore.</p>
<p>The lines were blurry. I’d watched some zombie movies, but I felt that real horror was an entirely different beast.</p>
<p>The sight of gruesome murderers and torture devices that made your skin crawl was something I couldn’t stomach. I’d much prefer a horror story with ghosts any day. While my stomach wasn’t easily turned, I had always loathed such brutality.</p>
<p>So, my memories from the last hundred years may be what I find horrifying.</p>
<p>Seeing numerous torture devices in front of me made me consider that my taste in genres might be responsible for this.</p>
<p>I wonder if I’m completely sane in my current state.</p>
<p>“Have you had a good dream?”</p>
<p>An elegant tone and a dignified voice. It was Princess Exchetra, known for her grace and poise.</p>
<p>I raised my gaze, which had been fixed on the grim devices. Only then did my hazy vision clear, revealing Exchetra seated on a chair with crossed legs.</p>
<p>“…Thanks to you, yes.”</p>
<p>I had screamed and cried in my dream, leaving my voice hoarse.</p>
<p>I steadied my trembling hands on the floor and stood up. Metal grates enclosed the room, but I could lean my back against them and sit down properly to face Exchetra.</p>
<p>Exchetra remained silent, watching me until I adjusted my posture. Her unwavering gaze made me uneasy.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Getting up and sitting against my back shouldn’t be this difficult. I let out a quiet sigh and raised my head.</p>
<p>“You’re quite resilient, aren’t you?” Exchetra commented.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look intimidating.”</p>
<p>“You even maintain courtesy in this situation.”</p>
<p>“Because you’re a princess.”</p>
<p>Since everyone had brought me here, openly showcasing me to all, they probably wouldn’t kill me. Just that fact alone allowed me to relax a little.</p>
<p>I was okay with whatever happened as long as Kaichen didn’t die. I couldn’t allow that horrifying dream to become a reality.</p>
<p>Feeling the throbbing pain in my dry throat, I swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“If the opportunity arises, I’d like to have a calm conversation.”</p>
<p>“I have no intention of casually chatting with Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? I’m not so sure.” Exchetra chuckled softly and rested her elbow on her elegantly crossed knees, her hand supporting her chin.</p>
<p>Every move she made exuded elegance to the point of absurdity. Even in this grim and dark place, she didn’t let her guard down.</p>
<p>“You must have many questions, right?”</p>
<p>She taunted me, and I bit my lip.</p>
<p>I wanted to inquire about her secrets, the extent of her knowledge of this world, and her accomplices, but she wouldn’t spill everything just because I asked.</p>
<p>“I suppose you won’t tell me?”</p>
<p>“How about you start first?”</p>
<p>“… It seems you’re not going to reveal anything.”</p>
<p>“I keep my promises. Even if it’s a pact made with a mere worm.”</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed, and her lips curled. With her beautiful face, she looked enticing when she smiled that way.</p>
<p>“How about it? I might reveal something <em>very </em>valuable.”</p>
<p>I suddenly recalled the story of Eve, who couldn’t resist the serpent’s temptation to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>Although I wasn’t religious, it was a story that appeared frequently in various media, making it rare for people not to know it.</p>
<p>Eve fell for Satan’s trick. Faced with Satan’s seductive words, how much did Eve agonize?</p>
