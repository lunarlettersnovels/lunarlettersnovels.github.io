<h3><strong>Chapter 272</strong></h3>
<p>In any case, this situation was an inescapable trap. The decision to send Asta alone was a glaring indication that a trap had been set. So, it seemed wisest to comply obediently. Struggling would only lead to an unsightly and perilous outcome.</p>
<p>Even Prince Julius couldn’t deter Asta from coming to me, so there was no reason to believe a mere Countess could. As it had come to this, I found myself somewhat relieved that Kaichen wasn’t at my side. If he were here, he wouldn’t have merely stood by and allowed me to be dragged away in such a manner.</p>
<p>I pondered if he might have erected a barrier to prevent Asta from entering the mansion in the first place. If not, perhaps he would obstruct any potential escape routes.</p>
<p>Asta calmly observed me trailing behind him and then opened the carriage door.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I recalled the information about Lamia’s demise in this very carriage after she entered it. There was no guarantee that a similar fate wouldn’t befall me. I hesitated for a moment but came to the realization that there was no way back while standing on this bridge with no retreat.</p>
<p><em>‘She truly is a formidable individual.’</em></p>
<p>I sighed while Asta remained expressionless, merely clutching the carriage door. As I got in, I heard the door closed with a solid click.</p>
<p>I glanced at Asta, who had joined me inside the carriage. His beauty rivaled that of Walter. Other people would surely stare at him in admiration. As I silently observed him, sitting with an air of poise and composure, I couldn’t help but think he exuded an aura reminiscent of Exetra.</p>
<p>Not in terms of appearance but in his demeanor.</p>
<p>“You bear a striking resemblance to the Princess.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Has anyone ever told you that?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Do you not wish to talk with me?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Is this a trap?”</p>
<p>As I blurted out whatever came to mind in response to his silence, he shifted his gaze toward me. Thanks to that, our eyes finally locked.</p>
<p>“You know this is a trap, and yet you’re going along with it?”</p>
<p>His voice was smooth and pleasing to the ear. It was so soft and melodious that I couldn’t help but think he could be a voice actor. It sounded pretty different from how it was outside compared to within the confines of the enclosed carriage.</p>
<p>“There’s no way out, and you’ve prepared thoroughly, haven’t you? On the Princess’s orders?”</p>
<p>I chuckled, lifting the corner of my mouth, and Asta still met my inquiry with his unyielding expression.</p>
<p>“If there’s no escape, why follow along, even knowing it’s a trap? If there’s no way out, you should seek one. Correct?”</p>
<p>Asta turned his gaze away without uttering a word. His distant stare seemed to fixate on empty space. He slowly blinked his long eyelashes.</p>
<p>“If there’s no way out, she’ll create one.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“She knows it’s a trap, but instead of obediently following along, she’ll forge her path.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“That’s the distinction between you and <em>her</em>.”</p>
<p>It felt like an answer signaling me to refrain from further conversation.</p>
<p>“I just asked about your thoughts.”</p>
<p>I blinked and asked again, but Asta continued with his vacant gaze, diverting his eyes from me.</p>
<p>“You don’t require my thoughts.”</p>
<p>Asta said this and remained silent. I, too, had no intention of speaking with him any further. He provided an entirely different response, almost as if he were a spokesperson for Exetra.</p>
<p>She would fashion a route where none existed.</p>
<p>She would never tread a path that was obviously a trap.</p>
<p>I couldn’t even muster a response to what felt like a taunting gesture.</p>
<p>It was like gazing upon a black-and-white chessboard. Similar to Lamia, who was bound and helpless, akin to one of the chess pieces, I felt like I was one of Asta’s pawns.</p>
<p>No, it was certain. I was a pawn in Princess Exchetra’s game. But whether I would be employed and discarded like Lamia, or be something else – something more significant like a bishop or knight, remained uncertain.</p>
<p>It appeared that Princess Exchetra was conveying to me that I held no greater importance.</p>
<p>It was unjust, and my pride hurt, but I reasoned it might be entirely plausible from Exchetra’s perspective, particularly when she has a potent dark mage and a knowledgeable transmigrator by her side.</p>
<p><em>‘How pitiful.’</em></p>
<p>I gently closed my eyes. Once again, my head throbbed, and the unpleasant ringing in my ears returned. Pressing my eyes shut as if to stifle the throbbing, I resolved not to waste any more time on this apparent trap.</p>
<p>Even if the piece was a pawn, its movements could determine victory or defeat, and in chess, bishops, and knights bore distinct values depending on the circumstance.</p>
<p>Perhaps, I might be the rook, the second most potent piece after the queen, or even the queen herself, poised to declare checkmate.</p>
<p>I contemplated how to utilize the trap into which I had willingly ventured, all the while calmly recalling the memories that surfaced.</p>
<p>In doing so, I peered out of the carriage. Naturally, the carriage wasn’t en route to the palace but to some other destination.</p>
<p>Since it was a trap that they hadn’t bothered to conceal from the outset, there was no need for them to veil their destination either.</p>
<p>I needed to focus on not becoming the first casualty rather than pondering how to manipulate them.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The place we arrived at was a rundown house.</p>
<p>After entering what appeared to be an ordinary home, we proceeded down a passage leading underground.</p>
<p>To think that such a vast space existed beneath Huelin.</p>
<p>Was this Princess Exchetra’s secret hideout?</p>
<p>Upon reaching a certain room, even though I had cautioned them earlier not to lay a hand on me, they forcibly thrust me into a cell enclosed by metal bars.</p></div>
