            <p><strong>Chapter 240</strong></p>
<p>Seeing them tremble with red faces, the notion didn’t seem too far off.</p>
<p>Kaichen tsked in annoyance upon seeing them like that. He produced a book out of thin air and threw it at them.</p>
<p>“This is a summary of theories related to dangerous poisons discovered in Acrab. There are many studies I couldn’t complete due to lack of time, but…”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it! I have plenty of time!” one of them exclaimed.</p>
<p>“No, I’ll do it! Medicine manufacturing is my specialty!” another argued.</p>
<p>“Drugs may be your specialty, but I excel at combinations! Leave it to me!” a third chimed in.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget, I’m the best when it comes to ingredient analysis!” a fourth one added.</p>
<p>“Everyone, calm down! I have the most time!”</p>
<p>At that moment, I finally understood.</p>
<p>Why hadn’t they chosen the same path as Anteresse and remained in the Mage Tower, despite Kaichen’s attempts to persuade them to leave?</p>
<p>These people were obsessed with magic, just like Kaichen—a bunch of magic geeks.</p>
<p>Rather than feeling inferior to the incredible genius, they were perverts who relished the opportunity to pick up Kaichen’s crumbs and conduct research.</p>
<p>“I hope the results won’t disappoint,” Kaichen remarked as he opened the door and gestured for me to enter.</p>
<p>Once inside, they completely forgot about our presence and engaged in a heated discussion.</p>
<p>“We should closely examine the ingredients of poisonous plants that align with the poison theory. And this part here presents new symptoms when five drugs are combined.”</p>
<p>“The ingredients of the antidote are also intriguing. Who came up with this? It’s astonishing that this combination works. We need finer control… I want to try combining them right away.”</p>
<p>“The same goes for ohapdok. If five types of poisonous plants can be mixed like this, couldn’t we mix three or even more? It’s not just this poison; other poisons as well.”</p>
<p>“The ingredients of these drugs are different yet strangely similar. Despite their completely different properties, they all have one thing in common: poison. If that’s the case, could we create a drug similar to those made from five herbs?”</p>
<p>“Great idea. Let’s not waste any more time; let’s go to the lab right away…”</p>
<p>Those were the last words I heard before the door closed, shutting us out from the outside world. Kaichen’s room, which I had grown accustomed to over the past three days, came back into view.</p>
<p>I released Kaichen’s hand and sat by the window, offering a clear view of the outside.</p>
<p>“Master, how did you know to come here?” I asked, curious about his sudden appearance. Although he could easily track my whereabouts, I wanted to hear it from him this time.</p>
<p>Kaichen replied, his face displaying annoyance, “My master told me.”</p>
<p>Normally, he would have known through the bracelet, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at it. However, this time, he gave me a straightforward answer.</p>
<p>Smiling with a slight twitch of my lips, feeling relieved that he had saved me from a difficult situation, I watched as Kaichen settled himself on the pristine sofa and spoke.</p>
<p>“Why did you come here?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to help Master, so I was searching for a book on magic research. Mr. Hamal said I would find what I was looking for here.”</p>
<p>“…Did you find it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, just as expected, the laboratory in your Mage Tower is incredible.”</p>
<p>Merely looking around, one would think it was a sanctuary of books. The room itself was a magical space, expanding in size based on the owner’s magical power.</p>
<p>Before I arrived, I worried slightly about getting lost among the numerous rooms. However, Kaichen’s room resembled an expansive studio. A simple bed rested on one side of the round room, while a door on the other side led to the bathroom and toilet. The remaining space was filled with bookshelves that stretched into the sky, accompanied by a desk.</p>
<p>Given the layout, I wondered how one would retrieve books without knowing floating magic. But when I sat down at the central desk, a scroll automatically unfurled. If I wrote the book’s content or title on the scroll, it would fly to my desk on its own.</p>
<p>Initially unaware of this enchantment, I floated up, searching through the books one by one. As I stared at the seemingly endless bookshelf, contemplating how I would ever find anything, Hamal kindly informed me of the search mechanism. By the third day, it became effortless to locate the books.</p>
<p>The magic reminded me of the electronic search system in the public library from my past life, so I searched not only for magical research but also for many other books on magic that I desired to learn from.</p>
<p>“Did Master spend his childhood here?” I asked, picturing a young Kaichen running around and engrossed in reading magic books. The corner of my lips curled up in a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>“The bookshelf wouldn’t have been so high back then, right?”</p>
<p>“Nor was it low,” he replied.</p>
<p>Imagining a young Kaichen amidst magic books, I found amusement in my thoughts. Suddenly, I remembered a passage in his diary where he cursed Julius for not allowing him to bid farewell to a cat.</p>
<p>That memory seemed to linger throughout his childhood.</p>
<p>“Master, do you like cats?”</p>
<p>“You…” he began, his eyebrows twitching as he turned his head away. He jumped up and went over to the bed, momentarily forgetting about the diary.</p>
<p>I smiled and asked once more, “Hmm? Master, do you like cats?”</p>
<p>“You’re being annoying.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that why you held a grudge against His Highness for such a long time?”</p>
<p>“…Hah, there you go again…”</p>
<p>“Hey, I just saw it because it was there. There was no warning telling me not to read it.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kaichen clicked his tongue and perused the old, worn-out diary. Then he stopped and clenched his fist.</p>
<p>Unable to recall what he had written in his youth, he skimmed through the later entries and became tense.</p>
<p>Finally, he closed the diary and turned his gaze towards me.</p>
<p>“…Did you read everything?”</p>
<p>He was likely referring to the latest entry.</p>
<p>Sitting by the window, I swung my legs playfully.</p>
<p>“Hmm… And what if I did?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Is ‘that woman’ in there referring to me?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
