            <p><strong>Chapter 83</strong></p>
<p>While Kaichen was checking Victor’s blood, I checked his body. Victor was undernourished. It was expected. He had no one who could look after him in his illness. God knows when he had last eaten! The symptoms were brutal and nourishment was needed. But it was hard to do it alone. Ls had said it was a horrifying disease that even observing it made one feel helpless and terrified. My symptoms had been the same. But Kaichen had cared for me then. The fact that I was the most addicted to the poison and the alcohol and I was recovering game me hope for these people.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” I asked.</p>
<p>“There is more poison of the narcotic substance that stimulates the latent nature.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so…” What does he mean by latent nature? Is he saying the poison made this guy lazy?</p>
<p>“How different is it from my condition?”</p>
<p>“It’s similar.”</p>
<p>“Will the same antidote work?”</p>
<p>“It’s only a small amount, so it’s possible.”</p>
<p>I brought out a vial of diluted antidote. It was weaker than the one I took. I unplugged the vial and poured it into Victor’s open mouth. He tried to spit it out but I held his mouth close urging him to swallow it. After he gulped it down, he coughed. He struggled. His flailing arms almost hit me, but Kaichen blocked it with a stick.</p>
<p><em>Where the hell did he get that from? </em>I wonder ho much Kaichen hated Victor to even attempt to block the swing with a stick when he didn’t even want to touch him. I turned away and held back my laugh. I didn’t want him to see I was trying hard not to smile at that. I wiped ma hands on my pants. Some medicine had spilled on my arms. The stickiness remained. I felt icky. Suddenly a white handkerchief was thrust in front of my face.</p>
<p>“Use it,” said Kaichen.</p>
<p>He truly was a germophobe. He didn’t even carry a bag. Where did he get these things from? How much space does his robe have? Wat else is in there? I had a lot of questions.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said. Kaichen used magic to wet the handkerchief and handed it to me. The corners of my lips twitched. I was trying so hard not to smile. He wouldn’t like it. <em>This is a serious matter. We are at a patient’s house! Why in hell am I enjoying this?</em></p>
<p>My nervousness and fear at having to face the people of Acrab had disappeared a little. Maybe it was because Victor was unconscious but the terrible memories didn’t bother me too much. In fact, I was able to think about the good memories I had in Acrab. <em>It’s probably because of Kaichen next to me</em>. He could have abandoned me and ran. He could have chosen to not follow me here<em>. </em>But he stayed by me, patient and calm.</p>
<p><em>Did Julius give him a special order? </em>There was never a moment when Kaichen endured something without Julius’ request. Perhaps he had ordered Kaichen to solve Acrab’s problem. I wiped my hands clean and we left Victor’s house.</p>
<p>Even though Kaichen had purified the air by magic, I still felt relieved breathing fresh air outside. It had been a shock, alright. Even if someone lived alone, how could anyone be so messy? I was embarrassed to face Kaichen but I didn’t show it.</p>
<p>Victor had no chance with Rush. No one would want to live with someone so filthy who couldn’t clean after himself. No one deserved that. I would be grateful if Victor’s one-sided romance remained just that, one-sided.</p>
<p>“Teacher…if we continue, will you be okay?”</p>
<p>“If not, will you be able to do it alone?”</p>
<p>“No way. How can I do it without Teacher?”</p>
<p>“You just need to check the patient, draw blood and bring it to me.”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t know how to draw blood properly. I think it would be better for Teacher to do it himself.”</p>
<p>“Must I?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you also ask me to put the barrier too?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Do you realize how shameless you are?”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course. That’s my specialty.” I laughed playfully. It was good to talk to him so casually. Besides, I knew he wouldn’t let me go alone. Ah, it felt good.</p>
<p>“Teacher, I was actually afraid to meet the people here.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s an emotional issue. I have committed a great sin against the people of Acrab while I was trapped in the time magic.” I didn’t want to go into details. I wanted this to be enough for him to choose to stay by my side for now.</p>
<p>“That’s… I can’t tell you everything. Not yet. I am not ready.” I prayed that would be enough for now. I had promised myself to keep my secret to myself because it was horrifying and yet, I had almost blurted it out to this man. He made me so comfortable and less lonely. He was the only one who had broken through my guarded self.</p>
<p>“I just… need more time.”</p>
<p>“That’s alright. Take your time,” he said. I could feel his eyes on me and I knew he was concerned. I was relieved and worried. What would he think of me after this? What would he assume I did? Would he wonder if I had killed someone?</p>
<p><em>It would be better if he thought that… when I reveal it to him finally, it wouldn’t come as a shock.</em></p>
<p>I took a deep breath to steady myself as we reached Jamie’s house. This was our second stop. Jamie had lost his wife and raised his two kids alone. He worked really hard but I sometimes ran into him at the gambling place. Jamie was the type to gamble away half of his earnings in the heat of the moment.</p>
