<p><strong>Chapter 203</strong></p>
<p>“Great! Let’s attend this.”</p>
<p>Barristan placed the garden party invitation from the Duke of Manuwell in a luxurious box on another desk instead of the usual tray, and handed me another letter. It was a letter with a familiar black rose seal.</p>
<p>“It’s from the Acrab Artisan Association?” I asked curiously.</p>
<p>Barristan nodded. “It came several times while you were in the North,” he replied.</p>
<p>“Ah? Is that so? Was it something urgent?”</p>
<p>I tilted my head and opened the letter. If it was really something urgent, they could’ve sent a magic letter, so it didn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p><strong>「Count, I heard that you were not in Heulin. If you see this letter, I’d like you to hear out Acrab as soon as possible. I think we’ve made a great discovery at the estate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>– Haram, Vice President of the Acrab Artisan Association.」</strong></p>
<p>The contents of the letter were simple, but since they said that they had made a great discovery, I wanted to go immediately.</p>
<p>“What could it be… was there news of something unusual happening in Acrab?” I asked, feeling apprehensive.</p>
<p>“I didn’t receive news about that.”</p>
<p>I rested my chin on my hands and shook the letter before rising out of my seat. “I’ll be back. It’s time for me to change my mindset for a while,” I said.</p>
<p>I was sincere in telling Julius to get stronger. If I stayed still like this, I’d lose to Princess Exchetra. She was after Kaichen, and by the end of the fight, I might end up with the same fate as Sheliak.</p>
<p>It’s a terrible ending that I didn’t even want to think about.</p>
<p>I had to change for Kaichen, who now had an achilles heel because of me. In order to do that, I had to face my adversaries.</p>
<p><em>‘That memory… I have to accept it.’</em></p>
<p>If that happens, I’ll be able to pour out everything. Kaichen won’t be sad  and worried anymore. I firmly believe he won’t leave after knowing my secret… Yes, Kaichen won’t throw me away.</p>
<p>My saviour wanted to save my heart just as he answered the prayer I longed for.</p>
<p>“Ah! Master, where are you?”</p>
<p>I left the office valiantly and searched for Kaichen.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>With Kaichen’s help, I returned to Acrab after two months. It wasn’t much different from before.</p>
<p>“Count!”</p>
<p>During the two years I spent learning magic from Kaichen, the people of Acrab also became very familiar with magic. It was partly because I used magic everywhere, but perhaps mostly due to Kaichen appearing out of nowhere, going <em>‘Look here! Look there!</em>’ like Hong Gil-dong*.</p>
<p><strong>*Hong Gil-dong is a famous Korean thief from the Joseon dynasty.</strong></p>
<p>They weren’t too surprised even though Kaichen and I suddenly appeared in the garden of the mansion.</p>
<p>I looked at Las, who welcomed us and thought,<em> ‘Aren’t you being too careless?’</em></p>
<p>They wouldn’t even know that we came in with movement magic. I tried to be polite as I nagged. “Las… why is the commander of the Alshine Knights so unresponsive?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you supposed to be surprised if you see someone suddenly appear? It’s different from last time. Acrab may be targeted by many people.”</p>
<p>After the Hoiore incident in the North, I felt that the nobles on Exchetra’s side were evil and vicious. I cautiously looked around. Out of Kaichen, Julius and me, I was, unfortunately, the easiest target. There was a likelihood that nobles were after me and I decided to stay vigilant.</p>
<p>“…There’s a barrier by Mr Kaichen in the Alshine Mansion, so no one can enter with movement magic without permission,” Las said.</p>
<p>My eyes widened. “It’s the first I’m hearing of this.”</p>
<p>“I gave you documents for the approval of barrier magic, though.”</p>
<p>I looked at Kaichen. He spoke calmly, without a hint of remorse.</p>
<p>“When we were rolling on the sofa, I was allowed to do whatever I wanted,” he said.</p>
<p>As I narrowed my eyes at him, I seemed to vaguely remember our conversation. <em>‘Did you really just casually ask me that you would put such a strong barrier on the mansion…?’</em></p>
<p>“The documents-”</p>
<p>“You gave your seal very willingly.”</p>
<p>There <em>was</em> a time when it was so busy and hectic that I couldn’t do anything anymore, and I stretched tiredly on the sofa. It must have been that moment. It was two days ago…</p>
<p><em>‘How could you have asked such an important matter in just those two days?’</em></p>
<p>I awkwardly smiled and cleared my throat. “Ye- yes. As expected, Master’s barrier is reassuring. There’s no need to be vigilant.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, I was able to squash down my fearful thoughts because of what Kaichen did. I entered the castle, feeling a bit better.</p>
<p>It was different from when we left; Acrab welcomed us with a clear spring. Thanks to the gardener with strong craftsmanship, the garden of the Alshine Mansion was beautiful enough to be envied. Black roses were in full bloom, creating a mysterious and dreamy atmosphere. I thought that black roses would create a lonely and gloomy atmosphere in the castle, but under the sunlight they were elegant and alluring.</p>
