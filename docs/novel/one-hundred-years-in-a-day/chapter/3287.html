            <p><strong>Chapter 236</strong></p>
<p>There were plenty of magic books in the Mage Tower, so there was no need to go to the Imperial Palace Library. I recalled Hamal, the owner of the Mage Tower, from just a moment ago.</p>
<p>Kaichen seldom allowed me to go to the Mage Tower, so I thought it would be better to ask Hamal himself. Yanghwa needed about a week of treatment to wake up, so I thought of improving my magical abilities that I’d been putting off during this period. Since so many terrible things had happened moments ago, I needed to sharpen my skills.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it made me feel like I was doing something great, which put a happy expression on my face. Flicking my forehead a little painfully, Kaichen spoke.</p>
<p>“What are you up to now?” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m not up to anything. I was thinking of something amazing,” I replied quickly.</p>
<p>“…Your expression looks like you’re plotting something.”</p>
<p>“Master, you said before that I look good with any expression.”</p>
<p>“I never said that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you never said that before.”</p>
<p>He shot me an absurd look, but I grinned and quickly ran past him and left the room.</p>
<p>Hamal gladly took me to the Mage Tower. Kaichen, who said before that he didn’t want to do it, spent all his time there without even leaving the laboratory ever since the research started. Because of that, I was able to enter and exit the Mage Tower without Kaichen butting in.</p>
<p>Hamal, who had to visit Count Alshine of Heulin every day for Yanghwa’s medical treatment, always took me directly to the Mage Tower, just as a benevolent grandfather would take his granddaughter to the library. Then, around sunset, he would come to pick me up, and he held out his wrinkled hand to escort me back, looking at me like a granddaughter as I poked my nose into books.</p>
<p>As a result of spending time in the magic tower for three days, thanks to Hamal’s kindness, I was able to find a book about the details of magic research.</p>
<p>The room I used to find the research book in the Mage Tower was the one Hamal guided me to, and it was the room that Kaichen had been using since his childhood.</p>
<p>I called it a room, but since the Mage Tower reserved one floor for each room, it was actually the entire floor. Moreover, it was special because it was the top floor of the Mage Tower, which could only be used by those who had the title ‘Tenebre’.</p>
<p><em>‘Am I allowed to go in without permission?’ </em>I had asked Hamal.</p>
<p><em>‘It should be no problem since you have the bracelet.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Still… a person my level can’t enter…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘In the Mage Tower, Kaichen has the most spell books. Use the power you have to get what you want. If you don’t use it, can that be called strength?’</em></p>
<p>As he said that, Hamal looked at the bracelet on my wrist for a long time before disappearing with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, thanks to the time I spent reading and walking around Kaichen’s room for three days, I was able to get results and had some time to spare.</p>
<p>As I leisurely took a look around the place where Kaichen spent his childhood, I began to doubt whether this place full of books was really the place where a child lived.</p>
<p>I guess I’m truly not a nerd. Were all geniuses like this?</p>
<p>I thought that Kaichen’s childhood was unique, but I suddenly remembered that even in cartoons and movies, the child prodigies often lived like this, like a cliché. In addition, Kaichen was the main character’s friend and was a person with protagonist abilities.</p>
<p>The corner of my mouth twitched when I recalled the first part of &lt;The Protector of the Blue Dragon, Julius&gt;. He fought well with Julius and grew up cute.</p>
<p>There were many books, and it must’ve been unused for a long time, but seeing as there wasn’t a single speck of dust there, it was definitely the room Kaichen used.</p>
<p>Looking around the room full of his traces, I opened my eyes blearily. ‘Still, he might be secretly keeping some embarrassing memories from his childhood.’</p>
<p>I opened the drawers at the bottom of the bookshelf, looked at all the places surrounded by books, and looked at the top of the tall bookshelf that my arm couldn’t even reach. I looked under the sofa and under the bed.</p>
<p>However, there wasn’t even a speck of dust, and it was enough to make me want to say it was all fake.</p>
<p>“This man… He’s so uninteresting.”</p>
<p>Even though I knew he was like this, how could he go without even one flaw? It was when I was lying on the bed with that thought in mind. When I buried my face into the soft pillow, I felt something under it and put my hand inside. I felt something hard.</p>
<p><em>‘I found it!’</em> I jumped up and took it out. It was a very thin, worn-out book.</p>
<p>I tilted my head. The old book was so worn out that it didn’t seem like it belonged to the neat Kaichen.</p>
<p>It was rare for Kaichen not to use preservation magic, so I wondered what kind of book it was that he cherished so much. There was nothing written on the front cover, and I swallowed before opening the book.</p>
<p>《Julius is an idiot. He doesn’t know how to do even easy things properly, and after trying a few times, he finally succeeded. That made him excited and proud. It’s useless for him to boast in front of me who succeeded in one go. Whenever I see him do that, I’m convinced he’s an idiot.》</p>
<p>《The cat that Julius took in is following me quite a bit now. It feels like it was just yesterday when it held its tail up straight and scratched around. It’s nice to see it wriggling around. Sometimes it seems that Julius also knows how to do good things, though he’s an idiot.》</p>
