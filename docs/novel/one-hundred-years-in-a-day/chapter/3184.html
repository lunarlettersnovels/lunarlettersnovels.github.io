            <h3>Chapter 340</h3>
<p>Looking up from below, the purple sphere at Exhetra’s fingertips looked so enormous that it seemed as if it would block the sky.</p>
<p>As I rapidly ascended the stairs, sweating dripped onto the ground, one thing I was sure of was that Exchetra wouldn’t attack me until I reached her.</p>
<p>I don’t know what she was hoping for, but she must not have wanted me to approach, or she would have attacked sooner. It was an arrogant and unlucky act to the end.</p>
<p>“Ugh… Huff… Urgh… Haa…”</p>
<p>Sweat streamed down my chin. I grasped my knees and breathed heavily. My legs trembled like a newborn giraffe’s.</p>
<p>“Well done, Dalia.”</p>
<p>Exchetra’s congratulatory words sounded benevolent. There was no doubt my ears were playing tricks on me.</p>
<p>My thoughts had become rougher since fighting Exchetra, but I was generally rough-spoken anyway. If anything, I had become more restrained since transmigrating.</p>
<p>When I saw her smiling, I wanted to curse at her, but I refrained. I felt like even if I hurled all sorts of insults at her, it wouldn’t faze her.</p>
<p>“I hope it was worth the effort.”</p>
<p>I wiped the flowing sweat off my palm and straightened my bent waist.</p>
<p>Although I wanted to lie down and rest immediately, I bit down on the flesh in my mouth. My stamina was already at its limit.</p>
<p>Even amidst this, I saw the purple sphere growing larger. Seeing it up close made me feel an eerie sensation that made my hair stand on end. It was not something to take lightly.</p>
<p>“It’s a magic circle.”</p>
<p>The magic circle that I identified while spreading out the map of the Kalhai Empire.</p>
<p>The mana enlarging the sphere came from the three points of the equilateral triangle I drew. I didn’t know what it was for, but it was certain that time magic was used to create this sphere.</p>
<p>I reached out my hand instinctively.</p>
<p>Exchetra’s expression stiffened for the first time as the black petals fluttered clearly in the wind.</p>
<p>Pulling out my staff wasn’t intentional. For some reason, I felt like I wouldn’t have a chance to do it later if I didn’t do it now. It was as if someone told me I had to do it.</p>
<p>“Not that I see it up close… it’s even more impressive.”</p>
<p>“Put that away, drop the act. How long are you going to pretend?”</p>
<p>Exchetra smiled as if she had thrown away her mask. Even though the corners of her mouth were upturned and her eyes were closed, her pupils were as cold as ice.</p>
<p>It was the eyes of a doll that felt no emotion at all.</p>
<p>“Interesting.”</p>
<p>The words she uttered with a sneer were short. “Whatever you’re planning, it’s best not to do it. It’s already too late.”</p>
<p>The languid and light tone was completely different from the noble princess’s tone I had known, but it felt even more out of place. That might have been her original voice, but it felt so unfamiliar that it seemed awkward.</p>
<p>Looking at the black rose petals swirling around me, Exchetra slowly lowered the hand that had been reaching toward the sphere.</p>
<p>It seemed that it was too late. The sphere was already close to completion, and the absorption of magic power was noticeably decreasing.</p>
<p>“Curious about what I’m preparing?” she asked, taunting me.</p>
<p>“You don’t seem inclined to tell.”</p>
<p>“Why? If you’re curious, I’d be willing to tell you.”</p>
<p>Exchetra sat down on the central platform of the altar.</p>
<p>As she casually removed the veil loosely draped over her head and shook her head lightly, her blue hair flowed down. Her attitude was devoid of seriousness, and it felt like the present moment was a joke.</p>
<p>“What exactly are you planning?”</p>
<p>Legs crossed, her gaze directed at me was filled with interest. Like a young child who had discovered an interesting toy.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Well…”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You guys probably had that kind of thought, right?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“That I’m going to summon the blue dragon.”</p>
<p>My heart throbbed as if struck by lightning. Even though there was no way she could hear it, Exchetra’s laughter sounded louder.</p>
<p>“And then… I would have proposed a deal to the blue dragon using Kaichen, the avatar of the golden dragon trapped in time magic, right?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Because the blue dragon, who loved the beauty of the lonely world, would miss its sacrificed friend.”</p>
<p>My fingertips trembled as if stabbed by a needle. I wanted to calm my pounding heart, but right now, the only way to avoid talking nonsense was to chew on the flesh in my mouth.</p>
<p>“Just thinking?”</p>
<p>Exchetra flicked away a pebble rolling on the ground at the obvious mockery. I looked at the pebble rolling towards me. It felt pathetic, as if it had become me right now.</p>
<p>Exchetra said, “Actually, I considered that too. But… it seemed too obvious.”</p>
<p>“… So? Didn’t you say you’d tell me? What are you planning, exactly?”</p>
<p>“Haha, impatient, aren’t you? How stupid and immature.”</p>
<p>Da.mn. I don’t know how old you are in this life, but I’ve lived a hundred and thirty years combined!</p>
<p>“The original Exchetra, in this ritual, summoned the blue dragon by sacrificing Kaichen just as you thought. After all, he was of royal blood. However, it became a variable that Exchetra couldn’t understand the voice of the blue dragon. She also didn’t know the final condition. But Julius, who could hear the sorrowful voice of the blue dragon mourning Kaichen’s sacrifice, was different.”</p>
