            <h3><strong>Chapter 296</strong></h3>
<p>Since Dalia had also survived time magic, she had the unique ability to render time magic ineffective, making her even more threatening.</p>
<p><em>‘Damn it…’</em></p>
<p>Asta’s hands trembled as he tore the scroll apart.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because his arms and legs were pierced and painful but because of the tremendous mana he sensed from her.</p>
<p>A suffocating magical power that seemed to suppress the very air he breathed, even reaching his lungs, controlling the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mana that makes fear palpable—something Asta hadn’t felt since Princess Exchetra. It wasn’t a matter of quantity but the weight of her magical power.</p>
<p>For the first time, Asta felt fear, and he knew he would have met his end just a moment ago if it hadn’t been for her mercy.</p>
<p>How would he convey this story to Princess Exchetra?</p>
<p>Asta closed his eyes as he felt the terrifying screams echoing through the corridor.</p>
<p>In any case, the largest hiding place for Momalhaut in Heulin was destroyed now, that much was certain.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Thank you… for waiting.”</p>
<p>I lowered my head in a daze as I heard Kaichen’s words.</p>
<p>My body, covered in blood, felt uncomfortable. It was somewhat embarrassing to be embraced by Kaichen in this state.</p>
<p>I felt my shoulder soaking in moisture. Kaichen was crying for me.</p>
<p>Instead of apologizing for not coming to rescue me earlier, he thanked me for escaping by myself.</p>
<p>It was surprisingly warm.</p>
<p>I wondered if he could feel my heart pounding, but his heart seemed to pound even more intensely than mine, making me smile lightly.</p>
<p>“Master, I killed that person.”</p>
<p>“…I’m sure you had a reason to do so.”</p>
<p>“I… I made up my mind not to hurt people again.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“But, if I didn’t kill him… I would have died.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“If I die, you’ll be sad, Master.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“So there was nothing I could do.”</p>
<p>“Thank you…”</p>
<p>“Is it too much like an excuse?”</p>
<p>I felt a bit embarrassed. Then Kaichen, who had buried his face in my shoulder, held my shoulders and lifted my head.</p>
<p>“If you hadn’t killed him, I would have.”</p>
<p>“…Master, do you also kill people?”</p>
<p>“Haa.” Kaichen looked at my blood-stained face and carefully wiped my face with his sleeve. “I’m not a sage,” he replied.</p>
<p>“…Well, I guess you’re right.”</p>
<p>“I’m not kind enough to spare those who harm me.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you didn’t kill me just because I caused trouble.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Have you ever killed someone for such reasons…?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>At Kaichen’s silence, I couldn’t help but burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Liar. Kaichen doesn’t just kill people for such reasons. If he were that kind of person, the golden magic enveloping me wouldn’t be so warm.</p>
<p>I exhaled a breath. I told him I wandered through the underground, killing every remnant of the Momalhaut.</p>
<p>“This place is… bigger than I thought. After I captured one of them and questioned them, I found out it’s Momalhaut’s largest hideout in Heulin. In case it might be useful to you, I spared a few lives over there…”</p>
<p>As I mumbled on, Kaichen brushed her wet hair without responding</p>
<p>Because of the bloodstains, I wanted to wash up right away, but I couldn’t tell him to stop as he continued to caress my cheeks and hair.</p>
<p>Due to the tears, Kaichen’s eyes were red.</p>
<p>Blinking my eyes, I gazed blankly at Kaichen. “Master, you mustn’t hate me,” I pleaded.</p>
<p>“…I won’t,” he said.</p>
<p>“You mustn’t be scared of me.”</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>“You like me, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You’ll keep liking me, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I was wrong. Even if you can’t understand, please continue to be with me.”</p>
<p>“…Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>I burst into laughter at his automatic reply.</p>
<p>I had so much to say. I had to tell Kaichen everything.</p>
<p>The truth is that I’m not Dalia, whom you’ve watched with love and hate for a long time. The truth is that I’m a soul from another world and this world is from a book I read.</p>
<p>Even if I said all of that, his heart wouldn’t change. His shaking golden eyes were telling me so.</p>
<p>I was afraid I might crumble, so I held his shoulders. He was as scared as I was, just like I feared his death the most.</p>
<p>“Master, I want to rest for a while,” I said. Everything was becoming light.</p>
<p>“Rest,” he said.</p>
<p>“Hold me, please.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Holding onto his warm and broad chest, I closed my eyes as if waking up from a long, long nightmare.</p>
<p>Although only a few days had passed, it felt like centuries.</p>
<p>I waited so long for you. I’ve waited more desperately these past few days than when I was trapped inside the time magic.</p>
<p>I missed you. I wanted to see you.</p>
<p>I can’t survive a single day without seeing you.</p>
<p>I must tell you these thoughts, too.</p>
<p>I smiled and let go of all inhibitions. A dizzying pain rushed over me like a tide, and I blacked out.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I had a long nightmare and couldn’t sleep well while I was in captivity.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why I slept without any dreams, and when I opened my eyes, surprisingly, 15 days had passed.</p>
<p>I heard about it from Yanghwa, who had been panicking, scolding me for not waking up and making her worry.</p>
<p>I stared blankly at the ceiling. Unconsciously, I traced the familiar pattern on my bedroom ceiling and sat up to clear my parched throat.</p>
<p>As I raised the glass on the nightstand to drink, I felt a sensation of clarity wash over me.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that my body was perfectly fine. I thought one of my legs might be forever crippled, but they told me that they had poured mana into my damaged body with the utmost care for a whole week.</p>
