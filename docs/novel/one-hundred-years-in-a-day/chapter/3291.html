            <p><strong>Chapter 232</strong></p>
<p>He had the look of a typical grandfather wizard from Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Hamal, who smiled kindly as if he could embrace everything in the world, spoke as he looked at the nervous Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Looks like you’ve grown up well, kid. Do you finally understand now?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, Master. There are still many things that cannot be explained by formulas, but I think I will learn more with time.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s a relief.”</p>
<p>As the conversation continued, full of riddles that I couldn’t understand, Hamal looked at Kaichen fondly. I could feel the warm affection in his eyes.</p>
<p>Soon after, Hamal approached me with his staff.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while, Count Alshine.”</p>
<p>I thought he would be friendly, but Hamal unexpectedly greeted me politely. I was taken aback, but quickly let go of Kaichen’s hand and bowed to match his formality.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to meet the great sage Hamal.”</p>
<p>When I welcomed him with a smile, Hamal smiled softly and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“I heard the story from His Highness. Could you please tell me about it?”</p>
<p>I was wondering if there was something he wanted to share with Kaichen, but Hamal said he would look at Yanghwa as soon as he arrived. When I glanced at Kaichen, he quietly nodded, and I felt strangely nervous as I led Hamal into the room where Yanghwa was.</p>
<p>It reminded me of the meeting between Dalia and Kaichen when they were young, which kept bothering me. I guessed that Hamal probably met her at that time. However, it was a past I no longer remember. Should I subtly ask Hamal about it?</p>
<p>My worries did not last long. Hamal, who was watching Yanghwa, put down his staff, stretched out his hand, and started emitting white magic. Hamal was checking Yanghwa’s body in a completely opposite way from Kaichen. White magic covered her entire tiny body, which appeared like a cocoon.</p>
<p>As I stared blankly at the magical cocoon that covered her body so thickly that she couldn’t even be seen, the cocoon gradually turned purple. I didn’t usually dislike purple that much, but I hated how the purple dyed her pure white cocoon.</p>
<p>Kaichen approached Hamal, frowning.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that she was addicted to opium?” Hamal said.</p>
<p>“…The ingredient was undoubtedly opium.”</p>
<p>“Take it and check it again.”</p>
<p>Kaichen pursed his lips and reached for her cocoon. Then, golden magic extended from both of his hands and enveloped the purple substance that colored the cocoon. The color of the cocoon became white, but soon began to turn purple again. The purple substance dyeing Hamal’s white magic poured out endlessly from Yanghwa’s body.</p>
<p>Kaichen extracted it and quickly disappeared using movement magic, probably headed for the magic laboratory on the first floor. I watched with a stupid face as my mouth hung slightly open, then inched closer to Hamal.</p>
<p>“It’s not… opium?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I heard you learned magic from Kaichen.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes! Master teaches me all the time.”</p>
<p>“Then, what does this look like to you?”</p>
<p>The corners of Hamal’s eyes wrinkled, and he pointed at the cocoon with a gentle smile. He didn’t even move the cocoon made of white magic that wrapped Yanghwa up, but it looked like he was pulling out the bad stuff.</p>
<p>Was it a method to find out about her condition? Was he treating her while checking on her condition?</p>
<p>“Is this a treatment?” I asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Hoho. You weren’t surprised to see it, so I thought you’d already heard of it, but I guess that wasn’t the case.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s not?”</p>
<p>“It’s similar.”</p>
<p>Hamal picked up his cane and brought a chair to sit down on. “To be precise, she is recovering,” he said.</p>
<p>“Recovering?”</p>
<p>“I am helping her body recover on its own. We’re getting rid of the bad parts and trying to quickly get things back to normal.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>It reminded me of something like an automatic recovery system I had seen in manhwa. In fact, assisting the body’s immunity to enable rapid recovery was a common theme in manhwas.</p>
<p>I quietly nodded and looked at the magic cocoon curiously. “I heard that this cocoon can be said to be a layer of sap where the best healing magic continues to be activated.”</p>
<p>“It’s similar.”</p>
<p>“It must consume a lot of mana.”</p>
<p>“It’s the only magic I’m good at, so it takes relatively little magic.”</p>
<p>I nodded and examined the cocoon closely.</p>
<p>I definitely heard that Hamal was a magician specializing in healing magic. Was fixing or attaching a broken arm possible with his healing magic?</p>
<p>There were so many great rumors about Hamal, the great sage and owner of the Magic Tower, that it was a bit difficult to determine which ones were real and which were false. However, after seeing this kind of healing magic in person, I knew one thing. Rumors related to healing magic were absolutely not false.</p>
