            <p><strong>Chapter 111</strong></p>
<p>“Countess Alshine is still recovering from the damage she suffered in the time magic,” said Julius. “It would be better to give her some time.” Kaichen looked at him. Julius slightly shook his head at his friend, gesturing to him to not interrupt. “I think it would be better to decide on a place later. It would also work to reiterate the generosity and gratitude of the royal family towards the people. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Hm.” Akshetra pondered that for a while. She nodded. “I hope it won’t be too long till we get to meet the countess.”</p>
<p>Julius smiled brightly. He told her that he would take care of the arrangements as well. After bidding farewell, Julius almost dragged Kaichen out of the Rodren palace. It was only after they passed the snapdragon did Kaichen shake of his arm from Julius’ grip.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>“What is it now?” asked Julius, seeing his friend glaring at him. “Do you want me to call the countess here right now and serve her on a platter to the imperial family? You know how my sister is! She has already noticed that you are going out of your way to protect the countess.”</p>
<p>Kaichen didn’t respond. “Look, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to protect the countess or are you declaring to the world that she is yours?”</p>
<p>Kaichen sighed and lowered his head to look at the ground. “Did I make it that obvious?”</p>
<p>“Kaichen, you took her in as your disciple when you have taken no disciples at all in the past. You then accepted the call from the imperial family meant for her. You are being really reckless with your words with my sister. Who wouldn’t notice it?” said Julius. “I know, right now, that’s the only thing that matters to you. You want to keep her safe. But you need to tread carefully.”</p>
<p>Julius let out a sigh and ran his fingers through his hair. Kaichen was victorious but he had almost shown his weakness. Anybody could use that against him.</p>
<p>“It’s alright,” said Julius. “Don’t look so sad. We have avoided it for now. But she will definitely want to meet the countess. Till now, she was a medium so the magicians were after her to study her. But now my sister has her sight onto her. I am sure the Momalhaut will target her more than ever. We will have to be prepared.”</p>
<p>The connection between Akshetra and Momalhaut was a known fact but they didn’t really have concrete evidence to convict her. She was the Princess and she was powerful. She had taken the reins of the kingdom when the emperor had been useless in his duties. Even if the emperor cared for Julius, he only took advice on matters of the kingdom from his sister. She could always confront Julius and he wouldn’t have anything to fight her with. It was a disadvantageous fight.</p>
<p>The commotion in Acrab hadn’t done so much damage. The craftsmen were disappointed but they wouldn’t revolt against the empire. The majority of them were Kalhai Empire citizens. If this had happened somewhere else like Garten where the majority of the citizens were people of the Old Kingdom, it would have been a disaster.</p>
<p><em>Momalhaut’s power would have increased significantly. </em>The thought sent a shiver down his back. He slapped Kaichen playfully on the back. “Come on. There is no way out of this. The only way out is through. We need to be strong enough to not be defeated even if we have to go against them.”</p>
<p>“You just make sure the countess becomes stronger too. So, she won’t be swayed like before.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I can….” He didn’t continue. Julius knew his friend had intended to say more but now he looked like he wanted to run and hide somewhere where no one could reach him. He must want to hide her somewhere safe.</p>
<p>“I will give you some time. Just prepare for any possibility. Countess Alshine is already receiving attention from some powerful people.”</p>
<p>Julius laughed out loud hearing Kaichen sigh in frustration.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Kaichen ended up giving me the key to his safe, Julius told me everything. He told me he was trying to compensate me for the damage caused by Princess Akshetra. Acrab required money to recover. In addition to the compensation from the imperial family, Julius wanted to give me the funds from his personal safe.</p>
<p>However, Kaichen had refused. He was of the opinion that a teacher was responsible for his disciple’s life. So, he offered his key which was how it ended up with me. While telling me this, Julius tried to hold back his laughter but Kaichen scowled. I awkwardly thanked Julius before the communication was cut off. Julius had wanted to talk with Kaichen a little more but Kaichen had refused.</p>
<p>After a short, tired sigh, Kaichen asked me about my plans for the future.</p>
<p>“I have to manage the land first. I don’t want the people of Acrab to suffer even more,” I had told him.</p>
<p>“After that?”</p>
<p>“I want to learn proper magic from you. I don’t want to be helpless ever again.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“Um… When Acrab becomes a better place then I want to live comfortably.”</p>
<p>Kaichen nodded. He had left saying he would be back soon. He disappeared with his teleportation magic. I stared at the empty spot where he had been moments before.</p>
<p>“Well, I never thought he would cherish his one and only disciple this much.” I wondered if this was how it felt to be recognized and acknowledged. It was great to receive Kaichen’s approval but it felt a little awkward. I had different feelings for him.</p>
<p>The more he acknowledged and cared for me as his disciple, the more difficult it felt for me to confess about the feelings I felt for him. Sometimes, it felt like he was drawing a line which I couldn’t cross. <em>Well… there is time. I will approach him slowly. Maybe he has never been in a relationship before.</em></p>
