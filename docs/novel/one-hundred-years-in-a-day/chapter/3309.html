<p>His manhood, visible through the slit between his legs, was glistening with a slick sheen. I couldn’t tell if it was prec*m or water droplets, but his member was so hard that his veins were throbbing. He was ready to enter me at any moment.</p>
<p>Kaichen bit his lip, grasping his shaft with one hand.</p>
<p>“Hng.”</p>
<p>He let out a guttural moan as he withdrew his fingers that had been readying me. I was primed and ready, so I reached out and guided the head to my entrance.</p>
<p>“Dal- ugh… Dalia.”</p>
<p>He encircled my waist with his arms as if he couldn’t quite bring himself to do it yet, but he sat down and tensed his thighs. The head pressed against my entrance.</p>
<p>“Uh… Ha…”</p>
<p>A m*an escaped my lips. My passage struggled to accommodate his serpentine member, straining with tension. I pressed my forehead to his shoulder and bit my lip.</p>
<p>“You’ll hurt yourself if you continue like that,” he warned.</p>
<p>“Uck… N-no,” I murmured.</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Faster… haa, okay? Master… uhh, faster.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t wait any longer. Impatient and yearning, I descended upon him with force. I could feel him pushing through my narrow opening.</p>
<p>“Haa.”</p>
<p>“Hng… ah, uck.”</p>
<p>Kaichen let out a groan as he roughly grasped my waist.</p>
<p>His manh*od, buried deep within me, seemed to struggle against the constriction of my inner walls. The furrowed lines on his forehead were a testament to the difficulty he was facing.</p>
<p>Not wanting to cause him discomfort, Kaichen pressed his lips to mine, cupping my chin and cheek with one hand. He gently nibbled at my bottom lip before delving into my mouth, his tongue dancing with mine.</p>
<p>The kiss alleviated the tension down below, and Kaichen pulled me onto his lap.</p>
<p>“Ah..!”</p>
<p>I let out a muffled m*an as my mouth was consumed by the kiss.</p>
<p>“Ohh…”</p>
<p>I exhaled heavily as he pulled away. He stroked my back and massaged my butt*cks to soothe my quivering body. His manhood, embedded within me, twitched, eager to move at any moment.</p>
<p>It felt incredible to have him fully inside of me. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes as I surrendered to him, but Kaichen quickly licked them away.</p>
<p>He panted and caught his breath, sweat beading on his skin from the heat of the bath or the excitement.</p>
<p>“Ha… ha, I feel like I’m being devoured…”</p>
<p>He laughed at my murmured words, his shoulders shaking with mirth. His manhood shifted slightly inside of me, making my vision swim.</p>
<p>I pouted and glared at him as he teased me. He held me tightly around the waist and whispered into my ear.</p>
<p>“Because your face looks delicious.”</p>
<p>What? That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s chest rose and fell as I tried to protest. But as if he had had his fill, he lifted me up by the waist.</p>
<p>His engorged manh*od thrust against my inner walls, sending shivers down my spine. With eyes wide open, I clutched Kaichen’s shoulder tightly as he lowered me by the waist, then raised me again and again.</p>
<p>“Ha! Ah… ah, ah! W-oh, wait… ah, there-ngh!”</p>
<p>A wave of pleasure washed over me, from the tips of my toes to the crown of my head. My hand on Kaichen’s shoulder soon wrapped around his neck as I convulsed helplessly.</p>
<p>Water splashed wildly as he pushed deeper inside of me. Obscene sounds echoed throughout the bathtub.</p>
<p>My waist was moving in perfect sync with his movements as he thrust into me. I could feel my lower abdomen clench.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>All the while, I could hear Kaichen’s groans. Even in the midst of the dizzying excitement, the sound of his ar*usal made it all the hotter.</p>
<p>“Oh, Master, ah, it feels good… ngh, it feels good. Ah!”</p>
<p>“Ha, yes… more, say that it feels good, haa.. Say it.”</p>
<p>“Ngh, it feels good… hng, ah, it feels good. I like it.. More… ah!”</p>
<p>The steamy bath was filled with muffled sounds.</p>
<p>I hugged Kaichen with blurry eyes and pushed my hips against his. The sensation of his length penetrating me was both exhilarating and overwhelming. I couldn’t help but feel as though I was on the brink of losing all sense of self.</p>
<p>Heat coursed through my veins, making me feel as though I was about to combust. The water in the bathtub splashed wildly with each movement, and I couldn’t tell whether it was sweat or water that coated my skin, leaving me feeling slick and slippery.</p>
<p>The sound of Kaichen’s low, ragged breathing sent shivers down my spine.</p>
<p>“Oh, oh… more, ha…”</p>
<p>My body ached for him. I begged for more with every fiber of my being.</p>
<p>As the sound of water echoed around us, Kaichen stood up, still holding me tightly.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>I trembled as I felt him even deeper inside me and clung to him for dear life. He stared at me with fierce intensity as he gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>“Master…?”</p>
<p>I looked up at him, confused as to why he had stopped, but he let out a breath and pressed his lips to mine with a fierce urgency.</p>
<p>Poof-</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt a soft blanket beneath me and my surroundings changed.</p>
<p>“Hu-ack!”</p>
<p>I struggled in shock, but Kaichen looked nonchalant as he began to move his hips shallowly, still in a seated position.</p>
<p>“Ha! M-master…! What… ah, ugh.”</p>
<p>“This time, haa, I said… I wouldn’t hold back.”</p>
<p>His cracked voice and rough breathing were unfamiliar, but his glistening eyes were alight with l*st. He licked his lips as if he were holding a sweet fruit in front of his eyes.</p></div>
