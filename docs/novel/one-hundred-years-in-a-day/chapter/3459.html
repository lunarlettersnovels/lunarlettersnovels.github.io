<p>“I’ve never seen a bed as hard as this,” said Julius. “Hm… Is this a siron? Oh! Let’s see! Do you eat it while sitting here? So, I guess this isn’t a bed and an outdoor table? No, since it’s a chair I guess it’s a…? What in the world is this?” Julius looked at the bench with great interest. The somber face from a while before was completely replaced by wonderment.</p>
<p>“Just looking at it makes me feel relaxed,” said Julius with sparkling eyes. Kaichen sighed and looked away. “Give this to me. It would be perfect for the palace gardens.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Kaichen even before I could utter a word. “I don’t want to.” I looked at Kaichen in surprise. “It’s mine,” he said.</p>
<p>Well, the bench was actually mine. But Kaichen directed a fierce glance at me. He was asking me not to say anything. He might burn my student certificate, so I obeyed. <em>What in the world does he want me to do?</em></p>
<p>“It’s yours?” asked Julius, finding it hard to believe. Kaichen however nodded briskly.</p>
<p>The bench was nothing precious and it was easy to make. Hammering and sawing it took a bit of energy and strength but assembling it was fairly easy.  However, I had made it with extra care and attention. The surface was smooth, and it was comfortable. Kaichen was picky, and I wanted to gain his approval to become his official disciple. But I hadn’t known that Kaichen would be this stubborn for a bench. <em>I could always make another…</em></p>
<p>I didn’t understand why Kaichen wanted to hold onto the bench. He knew I could make another one, if need be.</p>
<p>“Where did you have it made?” asked Julius, “Order one for me, too.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be able to do that,” said Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“They don’t make it anymore.”</p>
<p>“What? Even if the crown prince requested it? How do you know the makers? Are you close to them?” Julius narrowed his eyes and looked at Kaichen.</p>
<p>Kaichen frowned. He glanced at me. <em>Why? </em>I thought. <em>What do you need me to do now?</em> His gaze seemed to indicate to me to stay put. <em>What should I tell Julius if he asks me? </em>I could hardly tell him that I made it after what Kaichen had said to him. I could hardly tell him that I could make one more, but Kaichen doesn’t want me to.</p>
<p>I felt really confused with Kaichen’s behavior. But if I spoke up, would he take away my certificate. I couldn’t have that happen.</p>
<p>“The maker isn’t here anymore. He is traveling as we speak.” I looked at Kaichen. It seemed he was having a hard time coming up with lies. <em>Does he ever lie?</em></p>
<p>Julius seemed to notice something was amiss. He looked at me as though asking me what was going one. My mouth was dry. “The maker left. He said he wanted to stay with his granddaughter for the rest of his life. We gave him some money for travel and other expenses, and he gave us this bench.”</p>
<p>“Really? A shame!” said Julius, “Where is he traveling to? I might be able to order it from his new place.”</p>
<p>I maintained the same expression. A little slip and all this would fall apart. “We went across the sea to the East Continent,” I lied. “He said his granddaughter lives there now.”</p>
<p>“How in the world was he able to find such information from the East continent?”</p>
<p>“Sharatan is a place where all kinds of merchants pass by. I guess a merchant who might have traveled to the East Continent saw a familiar face and told him.”</p>
<p>“How did that merchant know about his granddaughter?”</p>
<p>“How should I know?” I said, “That’s what the old carpenter said. I mean it doesn’t really matter. He is really old. He might not even have so many days left in this world. I think he just grabbed at whatever hope he found to hold onto his granddaughter.”</p>
<p>Julius was quiet. “I am so sorry, Your Highness,” I said, “The maker left for the East. He said something about making this bench according to some designs and information from a merchant who visited the village.”</p>
<p>Julius scratched his chin and looked at me. It seemed he was trying to confirm whether my words were true or lies. The corners of his mouth rose up in a smile. He looked at Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Is that true?” he asked.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” said Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Are Countess Alshine’s words true?” asked Julius calmly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Kaichen reluctantly. He stared daggers at me. I shrugged and turned away.</p>
<p>It felt unfair. I had helped him out and now he looked at me so accusingly. <em>Why is he mad? </em>I scowled.</p>
<p>“What a shame… can I come here often to rest on it?” asked Julius.</p>
<p>Kaichen grimaced. I guess things weren’t going as well as he had planned. <em>What was wrong with him? </em>I wondered. Kaichen was actually acting strange.</p>
<p>“I think I have a blueprint… which I completely forgot about,” said Kaichen.</p>
<p>“I thought you said he left, and no one knows how to make it?” said Julius, narrowing his eyes.</p>
<p>“I am pretty sure I can find it.”</p>
<p>“So, the maker gave the bench as a gift to you along with a blueprint?”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t that make a really special gift?”</p>
<p>“Kaichen… you are acting really weird today.”</p></div>
