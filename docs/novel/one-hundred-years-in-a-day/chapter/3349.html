            <p><strong>Chapter 174</strong></p>
<p>The importance of Hoiore was a known fact to all the citizens of the empire. The same could be said about snowstorms.</p>
<p>“Did someone steal the relief supplies?”</p>
<p>“Yes, this is an act by Momalhaut,” Julius answered with a grave look on his face.</p>
<p>Julius was said to have been investigating this for the past three months; about why the relief supplies had yet to arrive, and why the news had come directly from the lord of Hoiore.</p>
<p>“The people who I thought were on my side were actually Momalhaut’s spies. They skillfully intercepted information and stole the supplies right under my nose.”</p>
<p>It was the consequence of putting too much trust into people he thought were his own. Julius was honest and just, causing him to have firm trust in those who had once given him faith. Although he did not trust easily, once that trust had been earned, he wouldn’t doubt it.</p>
<p>He was such a typical protagonist. Of course, such honesty and integrity makes him an easy target for betrayal. However, I don’t hold that against him.</p>
<p>“If this had happened to me, I would’ve hit him,” I said, trying to offer any semblance of comfort. However, feelings of doubt lingered. “Why did they steal the relief supplies? Does Momalhaut gain something from putting Hoiore in danger?”</p>
<p>“There <em>is </em>something big to gain.” The answer came from Chushinik, who had been silent and unnoticeable so far.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by big…?”</p>
<p>“It’s public appeal.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?” I tilted his head at the irrelevant answer.</p>
<p>Chushinik clasped his hands together and had a rather serious look on his face. It made the atmosphere even heavier, but it was fine since it suited the conversation.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I can say this but… there was a time when His Highness Julius wandered the empire as a disciple of Matabju and rescued the people before he regained his position as the crown prince.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of it.”</p>
<p>It would seem better to say that I’d read it, instead of hearing about it. It was the first part of the original work ‘The Protector of the Blue Dragon, Julius’. Julius, the main character, travelled through the empire with his comrade Kaichen as a disciple of the Great Wizard and made a name by saving the people.</p>
<p>The incident that started it all…</p>
<p>My eyes widened suddenly at what had come to mind.</p>
<p>Chushinik nodded as if my thoughts were right. “It was when His Highness aided the northern land Hoiore during a snowstorm, that he made his name known to the Empire and began to gain the trust of the people.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remembered the chapter in that novel. Many incidents had happened under that chapter.</p>
<p>Natural disasters could not be prevented by human power, but Julius magically paved a path for those trapped in the snowstorm and made houses out of snow with magic to keep themselves warm until the rescue team came.</p>
<p>Of course, Kaichen also contributed greatly, but Julius, who ran to help without hesitation, made more of an impression on them. It was also natural that Julius was the one to persuade Kaichen into rescuing people in the first place. The people were more likely to notice someone who would willingly sacrifice himself.</p>
<p>It was surprising that an unknown wizard was a disciple of Matabju, but soon after, it was revealed that he was the only prince of the empire who was thought to be dead long ago, and everyone began to sing praises for him.</p>
<p>It was well-known that the benevolent and charitable princess Exchetra had been devoted to the Empire for a long time. However, rather than the elusive Exchetra who was out of reach, the devoted Julius, who could be seen and touched, caught the eye of the people. It was the moment when Exchetra’s stable throne was shaken.</p>
<p>“You just need to reveal that Momalhaut stole the supplies from Hoiore. It’s not as if public support for His Highness is only limited to the north…”</p>
<p>“Although the climate of the northern region is extreme, it is also rich in resources as they have rare medicinal herbs and beasts in the snow. There are also more people living there than you think.”</p>
<p>“…So what? What does that have to do with the public’s support for His Highness? It’s true that it’s not everything, you know.” His brows wrinkled at the ridiculous words.</p>
<p>The milk in my hands turned cold. Kaichen took the glass of milk from me. It was cold, so if I drank it, it would only make me freeze. I just fidgeted and didn’t ask for it back.</p>
<p>“I’m ashamed to say this, but half of the people who supported me were locals who were rescued,” said Julius with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>It was then when I realised what he would lose if everything went wrong.</p>
<p>“Providing relief to areas that need this kind of help is also what strengthens their support,” Julius continued.</p>
<p>“Then… if it goes wrong in Hoiore and the truth is revealed to the Empire, will trust for His Highness fall?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That is probably what they’re aiming for.” He bit his lip hard.</p>
<p>Princess Exchetra was frustratingly capable.  Whether it was regarding the incident in Acrab, or anything else, she planned and executed everything thoroughly without leaving a single gap. If Julius were to lose the public’s support, she wouldn’t miss that small spark – she would ignite it.</p>
