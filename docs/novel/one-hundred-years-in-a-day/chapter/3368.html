            <p><strong>Chapter 155</strong></p>
<p>The viscount’s eyes widened. It wasn’t only him. Everyone around had fallen silent and now looked at us. I looked at Kaichen with my eyes wide open. <em>Was I imagining things? Or did he put particular emphasis on ‘with me’?</em></p>
<p>“However, we are still glad for the extra information you provided. Perhaps we will visit the restaurant together again,” said Kaichen with a stiff face. Perhaps he had sensed Kaichen’s hostility, the viscount scurried away.</p>
<p><em>Goodbye, Viscount</em>. I had heard that stress is worse for hair loss. I hoped he would lose the remaining hair on his head for how uncomfortable he had made me. I was relieved that the conversation was finally over. Now that Kaichen was by my side again, the ones who had approached me before complimenting me on my beauty had scattered away.</p>
<p><em>Indeed… No one can stand before this handsomeness. </em>It was a very good shield. I sneakily moved closer to Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Teacher, how do you know sons of Duke Manuvell?” I asked him.</p>
<p>“I met them briefly in the past,” he replied.</p>
<p>“He said something about you teaching him, but Teacher you said that I was your first and only disciple.”</p>
<p>“I only answered Daiman’s question once.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Seems like that became a lesson for Daiman, then. So, in the end, you taught him something even if you didn’t know. Doesn’t that make you his teacher too?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“But it seems like Mr. Daiman had the intention of learning from you.”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to pick a fight with me?” asked Kaichen, eyebrow twitching.</p>
<p>I grinned. “Isn’t it obvious? I am jealous. I guess I am not the first disciple of yours like I thought.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Why? I can’t even be jealous?” Kaichen smiled and nudged his chin forward telling me to go on.</p>
<p>“You promised you wouldn’t leave my side, and yet… Why were you greeting them so warmly? I thought you were sick. Hm… was that on purpose?” I continued.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“After hearing them drool about you teaching them, I thought I was deceived. You said I was your first and last disciple.”</p>
<p>“And I stand corrected. That was the truth.”</p>
<p>“It didn’t seem like that to me. You were so kind and welcoming to your other ‘students’. You don’t even know them that well if what you say is to be believed.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Kaichen smirked. I pretended to be upset but he just looked at me and grinned. He pulled me to the terrace where tables were laid out. There was no one else there. Julius was still talking to Duke Drenis.</p>
<p>Everyone was either dancing or chatting with their friends. It was a very informal gathering. It was my first time attending a ball. I found it full of unfamiliar and fascinating things. But it was not much different from what I had imagined. The only thing was that it was even more flashy than I had expected.</p>
<p>“So was I,” said Kaichen out of the blue.</p>
<p>“What?” I said as I tilted my head to take a gulp of juice to quench my thirst. Although we were taking a break from the crowd in this corner, many eyes were still on us. I thought I was well adapted by now with him speaking out of context but that seemed to be untrue.</p>
<p>“What?” I asked again. Kaichen took the empty juice glass from my hand and handed me another one.</p>
<p>“I was jealous, too.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Maybe more so than I expected.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“It was very unpleasant.” His words had shocked me so much that I accidentally dropped the glass in my hand.</p>
<p>Kaichen caught it before it smashed on the floor. But the juice from the glass splashed on him. Kaichen looked at me without wavering. He was his easy, confident self.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” he asked, looking at me with concern. “Do you not feel well?”</p>
<p><em>Why am I so on edge? </em>I nodded at him. His intense gaze on me made my heart race. I blushed bright red. The man didn’t know when he dropped sudden bombs to give me a heart attack.</p>
<p>“T-Teacher… the juice. I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. Don’t worry. This will dry in a second.” He placed the glass on the table and picked up a tissue to wipe at his robe. While he did that, his eyes were on me. It never left my face. His golden eyes did not waver, and I felt even more flustered than before. His intense gaze made me feel naked.</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” I said in a hurry. My mind wasn’t working. His hand reached out to me and my shoulders stiffened. He tucked a stray hair behind my ear.</p>
<p>“If you don’t feel very well, we could head back,” he said.</p>
<p>I almost nodded at his suggestion and then vigorously shook my head. <em>Head back?! No way! I have to keep my wits if I want to be able to go through with my plans!</em></p>
<p>I looked up at him. Kaichen was still trying to arrange my messy hair into place. I laughed. “Teacher. I am alright. But you have to stay by my side no matter what. I don’t want creeps to approach me again.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
