            <h3><strong>Chapter 269</strong></h3>
<p>Frustrated and aggrieved, but most likely filled with anger, Lamia Sorel would have returned to the mansion with thoughts of revenge in her mind. Nevertheless, her unexpected death hinted that this incident would not end as a mere provocation.</p>
<p>[…Damn, the Marquis of Sorel heard about what happened at the party and came looking for answers. He’s demanding to see Countess Alshine. This is madness.]</p>
<p>“… Are they saying that Dalia was behind the attack and the poison?”</p>
<p>[It seems like that’s what they suspect, as the Princess, who is not well-established in this empire, has no power to attack. They believe Countess Alshine was involved since she was the one protecting the Princess.]</p>
<p>“That’s something you…! Ugh.”</p>
<p>Kaichen had been about to speak but stopped himself, realizing the absurdity of what he was about to say. Despite not getting any breeze all day, a chilly wind had finally picked up as night fell.</p>
<p>He irritably brushed his hair away from his face and continued, “Are they planning to stage such a ridiculous drama? Exchetra… What about her?”</p>
<p>Julius couldn’t hide his awkward expression in response to Kaichen’s statement. [They probably want to take advantage of the situation. The circumstances aren’t favorable, and we need to determine what poison was used, so I hope you can come here.]</p>
<p>“If I do it, it won’t be considered a proper verification, especially concerning my relationship with Dalia.”</p>
<p>[Ah…”]</p>
<p>“Summon the Master, Julius.”</p>
<p>[And you? What about Countess Alshine…?]</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of it myself. They seem to want to make a big deal out of this incident, so… we shouldn’t give them any openings.”</p>
<p>Julius sighed deeply. He must be feeling quite overwhelmed by today’s events, especially considering the newfound emotions he had discovered earlier. Still, Kaichen had no time to worry about Julius’s feelings.</p>
<p>With furrowed brows and his temples firmly pressed, Kaichen said, “Confirm the type of poison used, and issue a wanted notice. Find out where Lamia Sorel was last seen while she was still alive.”</p>
<p>Kaichen cut off the communication, irritatedly running his fingers through his hair. Surveying the dark surroundings, he quickly organized the tasks he needed to handle immediately. His thoughts and actions were so fast that they could be measured in seconds. As long as the issue was related to Dalia.</p>
<p>Before the sense of futility could return, Kaichen swiftly cast a teleportation spell to his destination.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Even though I had expected him to return late, Kaichen didn’t come back that night.</p>
<p><em>‘Had he become so angry that he chose to spend the entire night away? Still, couldn’t he have at least informed me that he would be staying out?’</em></p>
<p>The air in the room grew colder, almost chilling, as if to emphasize his absence. It was just one night. I started to feel so disheartened.</p>
<p>Staring at the early morning spring sunlight, I suddenly burst into laughter. I felt so pitiful for feeling this way.</p>
<p>With just a bit of magic in the bracelet that never left my wrist, Kaichen’s face would instantly appear in the air. Yet, I remained silent in his room, holding onto the last shreds of my pride.</p>
<p>Because I wanted to see him, because I wanted to speak to him directly.</p>
<p>I repeated these almost indefensible reasons to myself several times as I left Kaichen’s bedroom. Despite everything, I began to ponder why Kaichen had stayed out without a word. There must have been another reason for his silence.</p>
<p>Could he have met another woman? I didn’t entertain such suspicions at all. It was a ridiculous thought.</p>
<p>“Perhaps… Should I talk to him? Could something urgent have happened?”</p>
<p>My guess was confirmed when I saw the anxious face of Barristan, who was rushing toward me. He usually placed great importance on etiquette and manners, even being cautious when walking too fast, so it was evident that something urgent had occurred.</p>
<p>“Countess!”</p>
<p>“Why are you in a rush, Barristan? What’s the emergency?”</p>
<p>“They sent knights from the palace.”</p>
<p>“At this hour?”</p>
<p>Barristan nodded gravely. Seeing my bewildered expression, Barristan looked somewhat surprised and said, “Perhaps… Don’t you know yet?”</p>
<p>“…Know what?”</p>
<p>“Yesterday evening, Lady Lamia Sorel was attacked and lost her life.”</p>
<p>“What… What?”</p>
<p>The words were so surreal that I dumbfoundedly asked again. It seemed that Barristan finally realized that I didn’t know anything, as he began explaining the series of events calmly.</p>
<p>“His Highness the Prince offered a pardon for what happened at the party and released Lady Sorel. He even apologized for the misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>After Julius learned the truth, he would probably apologize politely for taking Lamia without any proof. It made sense because he was responsible for peace in the Empire and treated guests with respect.</p>
<p>This incident was purely his responsibility. I knew that no matter what happened, Julius would handle it.</p>
<p>As the protagonist, Julius showed impeccable manners. He also promised to provide appropriate compensation, understanding that a mere apology wouldn’t placate Lamia.</p>
