            <p><strong>Chapter 249</strong></p>
<p><em>‘That’s true. She could just be refusing my food. She doesn’t have an appetite anyway.’</em></p>
<p>When I was about to leave the lab thinking I shouldn’t bother, Kaichen put down his things and turned around.</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“If it’s really hard and you want to give up, tell me.”</p>
<p>“Then will Master step forward?”</p>
<p>“It’s better than you having a hard time.”</p>
<p>As he said that, he licked his lips with a grin.</p>
<p>“It’s not that hard yet. It’s only been two days. I was just complaining. As usual.”</p>
<p>Kaichen raised his chin slightly and crossed his arms. <em>‘Okay, do it till the end,’</em> his face seemed to say. How inconsiderate. He left the lab soon after.</p>
<p>Recently, Kaichen had become so cool that it was getting burdensome.</p>
<p>My heart pounded, my face was hot, and my sides felt ticklish.</p>
<p>He spit out cringey and cheesy words casually, but it didn’t feel like that at all.</p>
<p>It made my fingers curl… in a different way. I was so shy that I wanted to escape to anywhere, even the bedroom.</p>
<p><em>‘This is serious.’</em></p>
<p>This was a serious, incurable disease. I stroked my chin with a rather solemn expression on my face.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>I hadn’t seen Yanghwa properly for two days, but even without seeing her, I could feel that her body was now better.</p>
<p>I brought her five meals a day every day, and if she was bored, I made dessert that she would like.</p>
<p>Instead of staying in Yanghwa’s room for thirty minutes or ten minutes at the least, I chose to go in and out on my whim.</p>
<p>Maybe that was why I was surprised that she was startled to see me opening the door and entering. I could see her running to the bed and hiding under the blanket.</p>
<p><em>‘Hm, that was cute.’</em></p>
<p>I really felt sorry for Yanghwa, but it felt like taking in and raising a stray cat that was shy.</p>
<p>After checking the time with a small smile, I slowly headed towards the kitchen.</p>
<p>In the original work, the cuisine of the Suran Empire, which Yanghwa and Julius enjoyed eating, was similar to Korean food, which didn’t often appear in fantasy novels like this.</p>
<p>Of course, I was the only one who could cook that. Thanks to that, I spent most of my time in the kitchen.</p>
<p>It made me think once again that if I learned properly, I would be really good at cooking.</p>
<p>“How is the Count so good at Eastern Continent cuisine?”</p>
<p>“I read it in a book.”</p>
<p>“Which book?”</p>
<p>“Um… I don’t remember. It was a very detailed book…”</p>
<p>“Please remember! I, too! I-if I could read that…”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I really can’t remember. I’ll just let you watch me, so you can think of it as learning it over my shoulder.”</p>
<p>“Th-thank… How do I…”</p>
<p>“Then do you want to leave?”</p>
<p>“I will gratefully take a look.”</p>
<p>When I came to the kitchen to make Yanghwa’s afternoon meal, progress was slower than usual with the main chef sticking to me from morning.</p>
<p>He was a well-known chef in Heulin. Barristan nagged me to hire the people who worked in the mansion at least by myself, but I didn’t know how to judge people, so I told him that I could only trust him, the butler, Barristan.</p>
<p>Not many people lived here, but when I asked if it was too many, Barristan said firmly.</p>
<p><em>‘You said you don’t like crowds, so I only hired the minimum number of people.’</em></p>
<p>Still, when I said that there were too many people, he said something like, ‘If you reduce the number of people further, the count’s face will be lost.’ I had no choice but to accept it.</p>
<p>The chef in charge of the meals was also one of those who were hired. As the main chef of the mansion, it was said that he only cooks meals for nobles.</p>
<p>Speaking of nobles, it was only me and Kaichen in this mansion, but then it was almost like playing and eating.</p>
<p>Then, when I served Princess Ja Yanghwa at the mansion, he seemed to be overjoyed at the thought of being able to cook at last, but he didn’t know how to cook poached eggs, so I ended up doing it.</p>
<p>When Kaichen stayed at the mansion, I often prepared his meals, so I was taking away the job of the main chef, so I thought he’d be very embarrassed considering his position.</p>
<p>Especially since when Kaichen wasn’t called by Julius, he stayed with me at the mansion almost every day.</p>
<p><em>‘But I can’t help it.’</em></p>
<p>Barristan sternly said that nobles never cook by themselves, but when he said that he would stop if I brought someone who could cook better than me, he kept his mouth shut and gave up.</p>
<p>I am the one who trained for 100 years in Acrab, where the best artisans in the empire live.</p>
<p>There could be no one better than me!</p>
<p>“Oh, oh! There it is!”</p>
<p>That’s how the main chef got to watch Yanghwa’s meal-making process right next to me.</p>
<p>It was quite annoying for him to be fawning over me, and even a tad bit burdensome, so it took some time to complete. As soon as I finished, I quickly grabbed the tray of food and ran out of the kitchen, not wanting him to ask any more questions.</p>
<p>Still, he looked like he would stick to me again during dinner preparations.</p>
<p>As I thought of kicking him out of the kitchen if he got too annoying, I suddenly opened Yanghwa’s door.</p>
<p>“Hick!”</p>
<p>Sure enough, Yanghwa, who had been fidgeting in front of the desk as if she was doing something again, jumped up and dived into the bed.</p>
