            <h3></h3>
<p>It was comical to see her shaking and biting her fingernails. She asks endless questions with fixed answers, and the bags under her eyes are puffy.</p>
<p>I knew why this woman was behaving this way. Memories naturally surfaced in my mind, explaining it to me.</p>
<p>This world lacked the convenience of modern life, such as cars and people using magic. It was an unpleasant world ruled by emperors and such things. However, I had to adapt to this somewhat troublesome and annoying world and accept that this small body was ‘me.’</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it wasn’t so bad. If I were to become an emperor later, it would be satisfying.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I calmly explored Exchetra’s memories and who she would become. Imitating someone wasn’t challenging.</p>
<p>It wasn’t much different from my previous life, where I hid my true nature and acted ordinary.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Everyone found it difficult to raise their heads in my presence, and no one could utter a word properly.</p>
<p>Even if my mother was a concubine, they knew she was the only woman who bore the emperor’s child, and that child held the position of the Crown Princess.</p>
<p>“That crazy woman…! How… How!”</p>
<p>I watched as a precious plate, recently brought from a distant expedition by some marquis, flew and shattered into pieces on the floor.</p>
<p>It was clear that if things continued like this, everything in the gorgeous room would be ruined.</p>
<p>I knew why her mother was venting her anger like this. While her power as a consort was strong, she was still a consort. The empress, the primary wife, was openly alive, and the emperor loved the empress dearly.</p>
<p>Unlike my mother, a concubine the emperor was forced to marry because he needed her family’s power for political reasons.</p>
<p>Then she had a child.</p>
<p>I knew that my mother had spent all this time trying to make sure the Empress was sterile, doing everything she could to prevent her from becoming pregnant.</p>
<p>She hadn’t realized that every palace maid loved the Empress as much as the Emperor. Racked with guilt, one of the maids secretly stole the poison from my mother’s hand, and the woman was now running wild and angry as a result.</p>
<p>If it were up to me, I wouldn’t have enlisted the help of others. Something important—I would have done it myself.</p>
<p>In any case, I knew that the Empress’s pregnancy was not good for me. The child wasn’t born yet, but the emperor had already declared that this child would inherit the throne.</p>
<p>Most of the aristocracy rebelled against the emperor’s words, as they were their mother’s people and valued their ability to run things on behalf of the foolish emperor.</p>
<p>“Ah, Exchetra! Come quickly.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I came to pay my respects and inquire about the recent matters…”.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m sure you’ve done a good job, but come here and look at this.”</p>
<p>“Did you write a poem?”</p>
<p>“It’s a name. It’s your brother’s name.”</p>
<p>I hid a sneer behind a stiffened expression and checked the letters.</p>
<p>Despite being a foolish and dull emperor, his writing was decent. His handwriting was so good that it was impossible to copy. Just like a worm can roll, there was one thing the Emperor was good at.</p>
<p>It was a little funny to think that this pathetic man was my father.</p>
<p>“Julius… Is that correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s your younger brother. No doubt! Because in a surprising dream last night, I saw a gigantic blue dragon surrounding the palace!”</p>
<p>“A blue dragon… I see.”</p>
<p>“I must go and show it to the Empress at once.”</p>
<p>If my mother discovered that the emperor had already named the child months before its birth, the palace would likely be in chaos again.</p>
<p>As I watched the foolish emperor leave, I stamped the emperor’s seal on the parchment I had carried with me.</p>
<p>The storm that had swept through the East had claimed many victims, and it was a very important item on the agenda to provide them with relief supplies and compensation.</p>
<p>Although the nobles always complained about the amount, I set a reasonably high figure, knowing that helping more during such times would ensure their support in the future.</p>
<p>The nobles had always supported my ideas but didn’t like the idea of less money for themselves.</p>
<p>They are pigs, blinded by immediate riches and selfish. Do they not realize that public opinion is not easily gained but easily lost?</p>
<p>When they couldn’t agree, they said they would abide by the opinion of the useless Emperor.</p>
<p>The corners of my mouth went up.</p>
<p>Did they know that the emperor was oblivious to the fact that a storm in the East in the first place and that there were victims wandering the streets displaced from their homes?</p>
<p>He was just living like a fool. Naming a child who was even half a year from being born.</p>
<p>I suddenly wondered why my mother loved such a man.</p>
<p>It would be much more comfortable and better to use him like this without seeking love from him.</p>
