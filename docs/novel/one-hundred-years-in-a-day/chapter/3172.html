            <h3>Chapter 352 – Epilogue pt.2</h3>
<p>Julius felt a twist in his gut at the peaceful and leisurely scene and the relaxed person before him. He was buried in paperwork, with his aides’ constant demands for immediate solutions making his ears bleed.</p>
<p>“I just… want to rest…”</p>
<p>But what came out was a tired, melancholic complaint.</p>
<p>Dalia, startled, put down the black cat she was holding. She approached readily, blinking her large eyes as she observed Julius’s complexion.</p>
<p>“You don’t look well. Did something happen?”</p>
<p>Two more cats trotted over to her. One cat brushed against his legs, its tail swaying, almost like a dog showing affection.</p>
<p>Dalia often laughed, calling them “dog-cats.” His mood worsened. His nose prickled for no reason.</p>
<p>“Are you… crying?”</p>
<p>Julius didn’t respond to Dalia’s bewildered voice. He heard the meowing of cats at his feet. And he sensed a bit of magic.</p>
<p>A shadow fell over the cats, indicating the other person living here had appeared.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>That harsh voice sounded almost comforting. He thought he was losing his mind.</p>
<p>“Master… His Highness… no, His Majesty is crying.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Their bewildered voices made his nose prickle even more.</p>
<p>Julius couldn’t hold on to the two people who abandoned him. He wanted to ask for help, but he couldn’t forget the Kaichen’s desolate state from when Dalia was missing.</p>
<p>The two of them had already given him so much.</p>
<p>How much had they helped him reach his current position? How could he ask for more help now?</p>
<p>If he had a bit of shame, he couldn’t ask for more.</p>
<p>Yet, the two of them had said to contact them if he needed anything while they stayed at the Willow house. But he couldn’t bring himself to contact them first.</p>
<p>He genuinely wished for the happiness of the two who had secluded themselves.</p>
<p>Kaichen, who hadn’t known joy or happiness since childhood, had said Dalia was his happiness.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>But after holding out for so long, feeling lonely and desolate to the point of death, he finally came here.</p>
<p>Seeing Kaichen speak so harshly to him, his friend, who was crying out of hardship made Julius question why he had held back.</p>
<p>“Master, you know that word is forbidden.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>The words “crazy” and “insane” were banned between them. This was because of Exchetra, whom they didn’t even want to think about.</p>
<p>Julius sniffled.</p>
<p>“So, what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>According to legend, one could hear the voice of the blue dragon. Or perhaps receive its blessing.</p>
<p>Julius didn’t fully believe Dalia’s words. He was supposed to be the protagonist, so why was it Kaichen who was happy?</p>
<p>Kaichen, not Julius, seemed to be receiving the blessing of the blue dragon.</p>
<p>Julius felt unfair. Although he had recently developed a good relationship with Yanghwa, they couldn’t meet often.</p>
<p>It would be nice if they could communicate frequently, but every time he called, the face that appeared was that da!mned Emperor Jungyeonhae. If not him, it was another one of Yanghwa’s family members.</p>
<p>Yanghwa’s communication stone was more often with her siblings than with her.</p>
<p>Julius rubbed his sore nose and spoke.</p>
<p>“Help me.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t say he missed them. Long-time friends would understand without him saying it.</p>
<p>Dalia burst into laughter at Julius’s words, and even Kaichen chuckled.</p>
<p>Although he felt slightly mocked, it wasn’t entirely unpleasant. He had endured enough and tried his best.</p>
<p>He was so exhausted that he had no choice but to ask for help. Thinking back, Julius had never been alone since he was a child.</p>
<p>Someone had always been there to help and be with him.</p>
<p>He was abandoned at birth but was luckily found and taken in. Despite tough times, he met Hamal and became his disciple, and soon after, he was with Kaichen.</p>
<p>An emperor might be great, but a great empire couldn’t be built by an emperor alone.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m going to die from exhaustion.”</p>
<p>He mumbled, adding to his previous statement. He felt neither shame nor disgrace. Admitting his weakness wasn’t embarrassing.</p>
<p>Instead, knowing there were people to help him strengthened his resolve and made him stand taller. Thinking this way made Julius feel even more confident.</p>
<p>He decided to visit this quiet, comfortable place more often. The Willow House was certainly a place of healing.</p>
<p>“Did you cry because you were tired?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Are you a child?”</p>
<p>“I’m the emperor now. I even had my coronation.”</p>
<p>“Does His Majesty the Emperor show his tears so easily?”</p>
<p>“Consider yourself lucky to witness it.”</p>
<p>His tears dried up as he spoke, and a smile formed on his face. While he was proud of asking for help, he felt a bit embarrassed about crying.</p>
<p>Dalia suggested they have a meal first, while Kaichen called him foolish.</p>
<p>Being with these familiar people seemed to wash away his accumulated fatigue. It was worth leaving behind the mountain of paperwork to come here.</p>
<p>“Stop overthinking and just come earlier next time.</p>
<p>Thinking too much is also a flaw. To two people who will always be on his side, ‘debt’ was such a cold word.</p>
<p>This place was not only a refuge for them but also a home where he had someone precious.</p>
<p>A place where family and friends were.</p>
<p>Unlike the endlessly cold and lonely palace, he realized anew that there was warmth and somewhere to lean on.</p>
<p>Dalia had said that in &lt;The Blessing of the Blue Dragon, Julius&gt;, he would lose Kaichen, become emperor, and find his version of happiness.</p>
<p>He couldn’t think of that as happiness. Even if he had a loving partner by his side and ascended to the throne to protect his people, could that life truly be happy?</p>
<p>The Blue Dragon felt joy in the beauty of the world through his friends’ sacrifices, but in the end, didn’t he cry from loneliness and sorrow?</p>
<p>Though he had lost too much and was currently exhausted, it was better now, not having lost anyone dear.</p>
<p>He had become emperor almost by default, but he was glad that Kaichen hadn’t sacrificed himself and that Dalia had returned safely.</p>
<p>“Ah, Master! Before we go out, you must set up the automatic watering spell in the vegetable garden.”</p>
<p>“Just pack your bag properly. Don’t forget anything again.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a child.”</p>
<p>“You’re a kid-adult.”</p>
<p>Julius felt his earlier annoyance vanish for some reason, replaced by a swelling pride in his chest.</p>
<p>He hadn’t received the blessing nor heard the voice of the Blue Dragon. He was a half-fledged emperor, but he was satisfied.</p>
<p>How to describe it?</p>
<p>The place where the two of them stayed was so peaceful that it could blow away all his frustrations. It was warm and cozy enough to bring him to tears.</p>
<p>It was happiness.</p>
<p><strong>The End.</strong></p>
