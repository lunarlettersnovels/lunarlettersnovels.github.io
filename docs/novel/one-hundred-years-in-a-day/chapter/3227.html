            <h3><strong>Chapter 297</strong></h3>
<p>Kaichen hadn’t left my side until I recovered.</p>
<p>When the one-week recovery spell ended, finally relieved and eventually collapsed.</p>
<p>I heard from the other Tenebres that his body was already devastated when he came to rescue me.</p>
<p>I asked, “So, where’s Master now?”</p>
<p>“I heard he’s sleeping at home. They said he needs to sleep to recover.”</p>
<p>I soon learned why Kaichen had become exhausted.</p>
<p>Time magic was cast in Turbeau in the West, and he depleted his mana, destroying it.</p>
<p>Hamal took his fallen disciple to the Willow House. The fact that Hamal took him there himself meant that it was the best place for Kaichen’s recovery.</p>
<p>I can’t believe I fainted without thought in his arms without knowing his condition. I should have at least checked his complexion.</p>
<p>I sighed deeply and slowly got up. Hamal’s magic was remarkably perfect. There were no scars on my body. I felt a relentless hunger surge, but first, I wanted to go to the Willow House where Kaichen was resting.</p>
<p>I wanted to see for myself if he was really safe.</p>
<p>Knock.</p>
<p>As I tried to remember where I had put the scroll Kaichen had given me to go to the Willow House, I opened the door, and my eyes met someone who I didn’t expect.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“How are you?”</p>
<p>I had considered tearing the scroll and going to Willow House just awhile ago. But seeing Kaichen suddenly appear, and ask how I was, I found myself giggling.</p>
<p>“I’m completely fine.”</p>
<p>Seeing me laugh, Kaichen also smiled slightly.</p>
<p>“What’s so good that you’re laughing like that?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I thought of you, Master, and you came,” I said, beaming up at him.</p>
<p>He slowly approached me and gestured to the bed. He was telling me to go back under the covers.</p>
<p>Silently, I lay back down on the bed and pull the sheets over me. Kaichen sat where I had been sitting earlier.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt somewhere?”</p>
<p>“No, really, I’m perfectly fine. The master of the Magic Tower is truly amazing. I didn’t know I’d recover this well without any scars.”</p>
<p>“It’s your resilience.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Master’s magic only helps the body in self-healing.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>Naturally, I thought of the white robe that had covered Yanghwa. I felt a sense of embarrassment again at the thought that I had been in that state without being able to do anything.</p>
<p>“Your recovery ability is strong enough that your could heal without leaving a scar.”</p>
<p>“Is that a good thing?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>At my question, Kaichen’s eyebrow twitched for a moment. I think there was some other reason, but no other words came out.</p>
<p>“It’s not a bad thing, right?” I asked again.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Kaichen replied.</p>
<p>“Then that’s a relief. I wondered what would happen if I get scars on my body.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Master, you like my skin as smooth as white jade, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“What are you…?”</p>
<p>“I mean, don’t take it too seriously.”</p>
<p>I made a slightly teasing remark with a hint of sincerity, maintaining a calm expression. As I did, I subtly grabbed Kaichen’s hand.</p>
<p>The gaze of his golden eyes, looking down at me with a sense of unease, shook ever so slightly. I could tell he was feeling guilty for not coming to save me sooner.</p>
<p>Kaichen must have thoroughly examined my body until Hamal arrived. He would have seen every pain I experienced.</p>
<p>“At first, I waited for Master to come and rescue me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But then I thought, I’m the apprentice of a Archmage. I can use magic, but I felt worried about the aftermath. It felt foolish just to sit there and take it quietly.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“More than anything, I’ve always thought I shouldn’t harm others because I have a heavy sin on my conscience. But that’s not the case.”</p>
<p>He looked solemn at my words. I reached for his cheek. The warmth that radiated through my palm was as comforting as ever.</p>
<p>“I felt that I had to live when I thought you would surely suffer when you see me hurting. But even if I was hurt, I had to be strong. I have to think of you.”</p>
<p>Kaichen remained silent, his eyes gazed at me steadily.</p>
<p>“So, I made up my mind.”</p>
<p>I finally let go of the heavy guilt that had weighed down my chest. Ignoring what had happened and not confronting it head-on wouldn’t be the solution.</p>
<p>I needed to rise above it. To return to my former self.</p>
<p>“Master, I’ll protect you so that you don’t get hurt or feel sad.”</p>
<p>Whether it’s me or you. I’m determined to protect <em>us.</em></p>
<p>“Master…” Looking at Kaichen, who seemed slightly surprised, I gently caressed his cheek and said, “There’s one more secret I haven’t told you.”</p>
<p>Although I said there was a secret, Kaichen nodded, seemingly indifferent. It was as if he were telling me to go ahead and say anything, so my heart warmed.</p>
<p>Exchetra said I could change my destiny because I was a supporting character, but that’s just part of the world’s design. In the end, I am the main character of my own life.</p>
<p><em>‘Well, if I’m the main character, I wonder if my life will turn into an angsty romance novel.’</em></p>
<p>But if we were to take into account everything that happened when I was stuck in the Time Magic to now, it felt more like a gritty drama than a romantic comedy.</p>
