            <p><strong>Chapter 239</strong></p>
<p>When I turned my head to look at her, she greeted me with an embarrassed smile.</p>
<p>“Call me Saveli. I really wanted to meet you. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>Although she was shy, she seemed to be the most normal of them all.</p>
<p>“My name is Dalia Alshine.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t wearing a dress, but she bent her knees slightly and bowed her head to be as polite as possible.</p>
<p>Having the title of ‘Tenebre’ was like that of a duke in the empire.</p>
<p>“You’re really pretty! How can I get myself a disciple like this? What a waste for Kaichen!” Michelle said with a fuss.</p>
<p>Her freckled face was very cute and lovely, and I felt embarrassed over nothing.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I heard that the speed at which you learned magic is also excellent. Just how smart are you if you learned from Kaichen, who can’t even explain things properly?”</p>
<p>Olganos licked his lips and stared at me.</p>
<p>It was a really greedy look.</p>
<p>“She’s his precious talent.” One rebutted, “Do you have enough mental strength to overcome the side effects of time magic? It’s a waste for Kaichen,” Jirata grumbled, not hiding his dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>He seemed to be about the same age as Kaichen, but since he had entered the Mage Tower at the age of five, they must have bumped into each other often.</p>
<p>“Kaichen has always been greedy. I’m so jealous…,” Nene looked at me with sad, glazed eyes. The greedy look in her eyes was similar to Olganos’, but a little more pitiful.</p>
<p>Surrounded by all the muttering until I felt dizzy, I couldn’t help but wish for Hamal to come quickly.</p>
<p><em>‘Wizards, after all… are all weirdos.’</em></p>
<p>Deciding that none of them were normal, I awkwardly laughed and tried to turn the doorknob to get back into Kaichen’s room.</p>
<p>However, when I moved, Saveli smiled and blocked my retreat.</p>
<p>After finding the diary under the pillow, I thought that was the reason Kaichen stopped me from going to the Mage Tower. I giggled, thinking he was cute, but I must have guessed wrong.</p>
<p>Kaichen barred me from going to the Mage Tower to protect me from them. Lest I be captured and studied by these greedy people.</p>
<p><em>‘Master! I was wrong!’</em></p>
<p>I shouldn’t have come out of Kaichen’s room.</p>
<p>Unauthorized people weren’t allowed to enter other people’s laboratories. Why did they wait so long in front of the door?</p>
<p>Michelle, Nene, and Saveli were women, so they were all the more frightening when they didn’t care about proximity and came closer.</p>
<p>It reminded me of the fact that mages, regardless of gender, were just crazy people.</p>
<p>I was a mage too, but I wasn’t like this.</p>
<p>I kept repeating to myself that this was normal and wondered how to get out of it.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to see this… What are you doing, Dalia?”</p>
<p>“M-master!”</p>
<p>Usually, I wasn’t the type to be intimidated anywhere. However, I couldn’t even shout at them and just trembled because this place was the Mage Tower, and the people surrounding me were the real power behind the Mage Tower with the title of Tenebre.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was a weak count who knew how to recognize power.</p>
<p>Kaichen looked at me like I was pathetic, then slowly turned his gaze to look at the four Tenebres and one reserve Tenebre who were surrounding me.</p>
<p>When their eyes met one by one, they each took a step away from me and shrugged their shoulders.</p>
<p>These people had completely different looks compared to just a moment ago.</p>
<p>“What business do you have with my disciple?”</p>
<p>It was an emotionless voice, neither cold nor hot.</p>
<p>Kaichen ran a hand through his hair with an annoyed expression and stood tall, slightly lifting his chin. At his arrogant behavior, the five mages flinched at the same time.</p>
<p>“No, that… Recently, someone kept coming in here… I knew you were here…”</p>
<p>“Because the Lord of the Mage Tower personally brought her in…”</p>
<p>“So, I was just going to take a look at her. There’s no other reason.”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Kaichen. We were just… curious, so all we did was take a look.”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Mr. Kaichen.”</p>
<p>Watching them hurriedly spit out excuses and blink at me, I immediately understood the hierarchy here. Maybe I didn’t have to conform to the power of the Tenebre. The person at the top of that power was in my hands, so why did I have to bend over backwards?</p>
<p><em>‘I thought they’d be equal because they’re the same Tenebre.’</em> But looking at their attitude now, it seems that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>“Dalia, come here.”</p>
<p>Speaking shortly, Kaichen held out his hand to me. I ran to him like a dog being called by its owner. Kaichen, who saved me from a crisis, was really cool. At this moment, I felt like I was Kaichen’s pet dog.</p>
<p><em>‘Am I Kaichen’s pet right now?’</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, the memory of agreeing to be Kaichen’s pet (or whatever) if he saved me came to mind, so I smiled and grabbed his hand. A gasp was heard. I didn’t know if it was because I held hands with Kaichen, or if it was because Kaichen let someone hold his hand. Whatever it was, it was clear that they all looked at me and Kaichen with shocked expressions.</p>
<p>“Can you all afford to be interested in other people’s disciples?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“With skills like yours?”</p>
<p>“…Ugh!”</p>
<p>Ah, this was a little rude, even for me. Kaichen cared less about wizards with the same ‘Tenebre’ title than the ants crawling on the side of the road, and he didn’t treat them as equals. I wondered what would happen if they walked down the same path as Anteresse, with inferiority complexes and obsessed with envy.</p>
