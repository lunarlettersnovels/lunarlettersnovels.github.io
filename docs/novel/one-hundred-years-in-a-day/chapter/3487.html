            <p><strong>Chapter 37</strong></p>
<p>Kaichen didn’t respond. Julius was befuddled. Why would Kaichen turn to making colorless food rather than making potions as usual. But he wasn’t one to complain. He liked that his friend was trying new things. Julius smiled and looked at the large bowl.</p>
<p>“I knew you had a great grudge against the Countess, but I never thought you would take revenge by using her as a subject for your poisonous porridge experiment. Well done!”</p>
<p>“I am not saying, have some restraint but we need her for now. She is the medium for the magic, and she may have been in contact with the Momalhaut,” said Julius. He laughed out loud and slapped kaichen’s back. “That’s enough. You can stop making this gruel. Looking at the Countess, I thought she would die. It’s troublesome if she dies. Don’t kill her yet.”</p>
<p>Julius took the ladle from Kaichen’s hand and put it down. He then steered Kaichen back to the living room. Seeing Kaichen’s darkened expression, Julius thought maybe he was having second thoughts on revenge.</p>
<p>“I have a lot to ask the Countess,” said Julius, “My sister hasn’t made any move as of yet, but it only feels like the calm before a storm.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. So, please stop torturing the Countess and take care of her properly. We need to investigate the forbidden magic, right?’</p>
<p>Kaichen didn’t respond. “If she hasn’t joined hands with Momalhaut, we could turn her to our side,” Julius urged. “If she has spent a hundred years learning magic, then imagine what other things she must have learnt!” Julius looked at Kaichen. He still didn’t respond. “Kaichen?” he called.</p>
<p>Kaichen sighed. “It was supposed to be porridge,” he finally said.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Julius.</p>
<p>“I was trying to make porridge for Dahlia because she was sick. It is not a poison.”</p>
<p>Julius was taken aback. <em>Are they on first name basis already? </em>The black liquid from the Countess’ mouth was definitely this ‘porridge’. So, kaichen has been feeding this to her so that she can be healthy again. Julius sighed. If Kaichen was stepping into the kitchen to cook, then her condition might really be very bad.</p>
<p>Julius remembered Kaichen who grew up with him at the magic tower when they were young. He would always chastise Julius for getting a cold saying he should have protected his mana better. He would call him weak for not taking care of his mana. The same Kaichen was taking care of her? Kaichen never ever made food for himself but he was trying hard to cook so that he could nurse her back to health. He narrowed his eyes and looked at Kaichen. Kaichen wasn’t someone who would lie.</p>
<p>“So you were really… trying to make a porridge?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“You’re were not trying to kill her?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Did you feed this to the Countess?”</p>
<p>“Yes, because she needs nutrition.”</p>
<p>Julius suddenly felt sympathy for the Countess who had passed out. Even though he disliked her because his friend had been hurt by her, he really couldn’t imagine her eating this porridge with a straight face.</p>
<p>“Kaichen…”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Have you tasted this porridge while making it?”</p>
<p>“I have not.”</p>
<p>“Why? Why not taste it to see how it is?”</p>
<p>“Because getting the nutrients she needs is more important. Do I really need to care so much for taste?”</p>
<p>“The food needs to be edible before anything else.” <em>Kaichen is arguing about taste while he is the one who is the most picky when it comes to food. </em>Julius sighed. He did not want the Countess to die before he could talk to her. Kaichen’s heart was in the right place. He had made an effort to cook to nurse her back to health, but he had little to no experience with cooking.</p>
<p>“If you want her to get healthy, you’d better stop feeding her that porridge.”</p>
<p>“She liked it.”</p>
<p>“Ah……” Julius had no choice but to sigh. <em>Is she repenting for her mistake by going out of line to eat and praise him for this revolting thing? Does she regret the past? </em>He wondered.</p>
<p>People change. And it had been a long time. They had been children. Maybe she had a long time to reflect on her mistakes. Julius felt moved and shook his head softly. He had to stop this terrible cruelty that was going on under the guise of ‘porridge’.</p>
<p>This was clearly torture. She didn’t have the heart to tell Kaichen that his ‘porridge’ was disgusting. Julius determined to step in and put an end to this and solve the conflicting feelings of the two people involved.</p>
<p>“A sick patient cannot eat everything.”</p>
<p>“She ate it deliciously,” said Kaichen. “She liked the porridge I made.”</p>
<p>Julius felt so much pity for the Countess. “But a person can’t just keep eating one type of food for every meal,” said Julius. “How about making another kind of porridge? A new recipe, maybe?”</p>
<p>Kaichen didn’t respond. She seemed to be thinking. Julius pushed on. “I know of a good nutritious recipe,” he said hurriedly. “It is healthy and nutritious, and she will be up in no time!”</p>
<p>Julius knew Kaichen. He was always quiet and listened to people. And he was a practical person. As long as something had a function, kaichen would listen to it attentively. He had never been very stubborn when it came to good ideas. And this was as good an idea as any, contrary to his poison porridge.</p>
