            <p><strong>Chapter 68</strong></p>
<p>“I’ve noticed this before…,” he said, in a low voice. I imagined how it must feel to fall asleep to that voice reading aloud. Maybe then I would be able to sleep without any nightmares. “You are good at lying.”</p>
<p>That jolted me awake. “What? No!” I said, “I have never lied before.”</p>
<p>“That is a lie, too.”</p>
<p>“It’s true!”</p>
<p>“That, too.”</p>
<p>I looked at him, perplexed. “When did you get into the habit of lying every time you open your mouth?” he asked.</p>
<p><em>Is he picking a fight with me? </em>I glanced at him, but he just looked as indifferent as before. His golden eyes looking at me so intently made me nervous.</p>
<p>“How can you not trust your own disciple?” I asked, incredulously.</p>
<p>“You were very good at lying to His Highness.”</p>
<p>“Well, you asked for help.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Even though your eyes were busy signaling me to come to your aid?”</p>
<p>“Maybe you just made an assumption on your own.”</p>
<p>“Hm… didn’t you lie to him too in the beginning? You didn’t tell him I made the bench. You concocted some lie about the maker leaving to somewhere ‘far away’.”</p>
<p>Well, I guess I struck a nerve. Kaichen sighed and closed his eyes. He turned away. He took a while and then turned back to me. “Wasn’t it mine anyway since it was my area around my house?”</p>
<p>So, that was how it was going to be. Fine! I don’t know why I was even arguing with him over something as trivial in the first place. But if I stepped back now, I would be practically admitting that I was a liar. No way!</p>
<p>“It might be,” I said, “But you still lied. I am the one who made it and you didn’t tell him that. I made that bench. I put it there. That doesn’t mean you own it!”</p>
<p>“As long and I own that land and that house, everything in it belongs to me.”</p>
<p>“That sounds just too far-fetched.”</p>
<p>“But I’m the one who made it, so I have the right to choose the owner. Just because I put it there “That is just too doesn’t mean it’s yours, does it?”</p>
<p>“As long as it’s in my house, everything in it belongs to me.”</p>
<p>“Is not that too farfetched?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“I was living there these three months. Just because I lived in the house. Do I belong to you then?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I was flabbergasted. My mouth hung open. He answered that so brazenly without batting an eye. He seemed like he was trying not to smile. <em>Why am I the one who is embarrassed at this? </em>I wondered, flustered. He calls me brazen but he is even more shameless than me.</p>
<p>I sighed. “I wasn’t lying when I said I am okay. Not entirely at least.” What in the world did he expect to hear when he asked such a question at such a time? I wasn’t entirely okay but having Kaichen by my side made me feel at ease.</p>
<p>“I have the medicine which is helping me heal. I have become quite healthy compared to the time I left from here, and…,” I paused. “And… you are here with me. So, it’s not that bad.” I looked at him. “So, isn’t this enough to say that I am actually feeling okay?”</p>
<p>Kaichen looked at me with his intense gaze and nodded. “I understand.” Was he satisfied with the answer? Will it be bothersome to ask him? He looked satisfied but you never knew with Kaichen. You never could guess what went on in his mind.</p>
<p>“Teacher, do you know what Antares looks like?”</p>
<p>“I do remember, but I don’t think he’ll be hiding here as himself. He will have disguised himself.”</p>
<p>“Is there a way to look for people who might have changed their appearance?”</p>
<p>“Hm… Antares is skilled enough to not be noticed. Besides, he might have changed his appearance without magic. It’s hard to find him if he does that.”</p>
<p>I thought about why it was so difficult to track someone who might have just dyed their hair. Then I realized that there were artifacts and potions which could change appearances without directly using magic. When magic wasn’t used directly to maintain the changed appearance, it was difficult to know who might be in disguise.</p>
<p>Kaichen could recognize people using magic to maintain their changed appearance, but Antares was a very skilled at potions as well. It would be difficult to spot him. I also had to think of other things that could go wrong. We couldn’t just go into this recklessly. <em>There is only one way…</em></p>
<p>I looked at Kaichen, just to find out that he had been studying my face. I smiled to reassure him that I was alright. But Kaichen’s expression grew darker. I stood up from the sofa, pretending that I had noticed nothing.</p>
<p>“Teacher, first and foremost, we better take today off. We need to rest. Tomorrow, let’s look around the city and try to figure out a way.”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s do that.” Kaichen agreed.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I asked Mimi to show Kaichen to the guest room. Hopefully, Mimi and Angel had cleaned the guest room as well. She seemed to have. She bowed and led Kaichen away happily.</p>
<p>I walked to my room. I swung open the door to my room. This room had been my prison and my private space for a hundred years when I was trapped in the time magic. I half expected the alcohol bottles to be lying about the floor. But the door swung open to a neat and clean room. No bottles. No dust. Only a citrusy and musky scent wafted from the room which calmed me. A cool breeze was blowing in through the open windows. I dropped my bag onto the sofa and looked around the changed room.</p>
<p><em>Are you okay? </em>Kaichen had asked. I wasn’t okay. Not at all. I didn’t want to be back here. This was a place I was trapped in for a hundred years. I never wished to come back.</p>
