            <p><strong>Chapter 164</strong></p>
<p>Dalia worked so hard on her research that after two days of going at it, she looked pale and skinny.</p>
<p>“Research is great, but you need to take breaks in between.”</p>
<p>“Ah… perhaps I should. I have been too focused…”</p>
<p>“Tsk. It’s because your body is weak. I should at least make some invigorating food to feed you with.”</p>
<p>“Are you… trying to kill me?”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>
<p>“I will exercise a lot! Invigorating my body is my specialty. I will take good care of it so don’t worry, Teacher.”</p>
<p>“Hm…”</p>
<p>“I am really very healthy. I already feel so strong! Haha!”</p>
<p>Kaichen was not a good cook. There were not many things that he couldn’t do. So, he felt that cooking was something he could do well, too, like everything else. He felt that it was rewarding to watch someone enjoy the food he made. It was an expression of his affection.</p>
<p>‘T-teacher, what is this training?”</p>
<p>“This is not a training.”</p>
<p>“Then, what is it?!”</p>
<p>“You said you wanted to get some air.”</p>
<p>“I did say that… But floating like this in the sky? It was not what I… expected.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you wished you could fly?”</p>
<p>“Um… yeah… that was indeed what I said.”</p>
<p>“Do you not like it?”</p>
<p>“No, no, it’s not that. I just… it’s my first time doing something like this, it’s a little scary. Just hold me tighter, please.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I won’t let you fall.”</p>
<p>Dalia quietly murmured, “Let’s stop this hugging and flying into the sky without any safety harness.”</p>
<p>When she told him to stop, he listened to her and immediately let go. Although, every time she shrieked and trembled, his arms came around her tightly. She was afraid of heights. But secretly, he loved how she felt in his arms when he embraced her. Thinking about it, he felt like his actions weren’t much different from the wicked thoughts he always had.</p>
<p>Kaichen sighed. “You drive me crazy.”</p>
<p>Using one hand, Kaichen wiped his face. He could not help but smile. Every time he closed his eyes, only her face came to his mind. He wanted to express his feelings to her, but he didn’t know how.</p>
<p>Today, she looked exceptionally beautiful. Her smile enraptured anyone who looked at her. He wanted to imprint that smile in his mind. He wanted to keep it for himself. He wanted to hide it somewhere only he could see. He wanted to hold her, envelop her in his arms.</p>
<p><em>Dalia… Dalia, you wouldn’t understand. You confessed to me first, but with this, you are forever mine. I will never let go of your hand.</em></p>
<p>Kaichen closed his eyes and opened it slowly. He looked up at the night sky and smiled. <em>You came to me… you chose me. </em>He had dealt with magic his whole life and yet, Dalia felt like the most magical person in the entire world. It was a beautiful feeling.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I woke up feeling like everything that had happened had been a dream. On the way back home, I had fallen asleep. Mimi, as usual, had woken up early and was bustling around the mansion. It was more noisy than usual.</p>
<p>“Are we having guests over?” I asked, rubbing my sleepy eyes. I yawned.</p>
<p>Mimi combed my frizzy, tangled hair. “According to Baristan, those guests are here to invite you to their party after seeing you at the ball yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Just thinking about it sounds so bothersome.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but this is a necessary process of being a part of Heulin. It is good to make connections and establish yourself as Countess Alshine.”</p>
<p>“I don’t even want to do that.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you would do it for the sake of the Crown Prince, if nothing else?”</p>
<p>Mimi was quick-witted and she knew the purpose with which I had arrived here. I let out a sigh as she brought out clothes for me to wear. “You never know. You might even find friends who you might actually like. Don’t be so pessimistic even before you try, Countess,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’m not really… interested in making <em>friends</em>.”</p>
<p>“If you continue to be this alone, you will soon feel very lonely and bitter,” said Mimi worriedly.</p>
<p>As I watched her, I put on my clothes and checked my reflection in the mirror. My usual comfortable shirt and pants were my favorite attire to wear in the mansion. Nothing was particularly different from Acrab here. If anything had changed, it was my debut in Heulin and my relationship with Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Why are you smiling like that?” asked Mimi.</p>
<p>“Huh? Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like that! That exactly looks like the smile you had on your face when you won big in gambling once in the past…”</p>
<p>“What are you even talking about? You know I don’t gamble anymore. You said I will feel lonely and bitter, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. All you do is stay all day in the mansion or lock yourself in and do your strange research…”</p>
<p>“I am not lonely. I have Teacher.” When I thought of him, my lips curled up in a smile.</p>
<p>Mimi narrowed her eyes. “Are you saying that you have Mr. Kaichen so you don’t need to worry about your difficulties in making new friends?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Mimi,” I said. “Thanks to Teacher, I can skip this once on socializing and start another time.”</p>
<p>“God! Countess and Mr. Kaichen… you both will just say everything is good and do nothing about it.” Mimi shook her head.</p>
<p>During these past two years, Mimi had seen and heard us and could easily figure out my feelings. She was the closest to me, so it wasn’t surprising that she knew how I felt about Kaichen.</p>
