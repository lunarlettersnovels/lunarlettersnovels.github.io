            <p><strong>Chapter 104</strong></p>
<p>“You need to fix your bad habit of entering someone’s room without knocking,” he said while eating.</p>
<p>I looked at him. He put down the empty bowl on the table. “It’s plain rude to do that. Also, how can a woman casually enter a room where a man is staying?”</p>
<p>“I don’t enter any man’s room. Just you.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying I am not a man?”</p>
<p>“What? No! I just… meant…,” I fumbled for words. How do I put into words that I trusted him completely? I also wanted to say I was worried about him. “I would never do that with others. It’s because you are my teacher and it’s comfortable.”</p>
<p>I saw his face harden slightly. <em>Did I say something wrong? Why was he asking me so many questions anyway?</em></p>
<p>“There is no way teacher is like just anyone,” I said, trying to repair the damage I had done. Was he annoyed I had been in his room and was watching him sleep? It bothered me. “I heard that you helped me a lot while I was unconscious. Can I ask what happened?” I collected the empty plates and stacked them on the tray. I pulled the bell-rope to call the servants. Most days nobody ever came when I did that but today, of all days, Mimi was there in a second.</p>
<p>“Mimi, can you bring us some tea?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, Countess.”</p>
<p>Mimi left. Kaichen leaned back on the sofa and stayed silent. I slightly opened the windows for some ventilation. Mimi appeared at the door again. She walked over to the table and placed the tray and poured a cup of the sweet, aromatic black tea. I pulled a cup towards me.</p>
<p>“Do you know Princess Akshetra?” asked Kaichen suddenly.</p>
<p>I almost spat out the tea I was sipping. I nodded.</p>
<p>“The battle for the throne between Prince Julius and Princess Akshetra had been going on secretly and steadily. I had speculated that she might have joined hands with Momalhaut. This incident has made it clear.”</p>
<p>“Have you got any evidence?”</p>
<p>“If I did, I wouldn’t be sitting here.” Kaichen let out a sigh. “The forbidden magic cast upon Acrab and the commotion about the whole plague situation. It was all settled as Momalhaut’s scheme.”</p>
<p>“By Julius?”</p>
<p>“No. princess Akshetra.”</p>
<p>I was amazed by the princess. I had never met her but she was meticulous. Whenever something led to her, she cut it off cleanly. It was admirable but it also made me wary of her.</p>
<p>“Hm…,” I mumbled. “Even if we can’t prove anything relating to the time magic. We still have Antares! He created that poison that affected me and the whole of Acrab. You caught him! He can be a witness. I am sure he will blurt out the truth if we– “</p>
<p>“He’s dead.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>I had expected it. Somewhere in my mind I had known he had killed him. Kaichen appeared calm. He got up slowly and rummaged through some paper on his desk. He seemed to find what he was looking for. He walked to me and held it out to me.</p>
<p>“Antares is dead. Without witnesses, of course, I can’t link this case to Princess Akshetra,” he said.</p>
<p>I accepted the sealed envelope he held towards me. “What is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Julius Prince told me to give it to you.”</p>
<p>I opened the letter. It read:</p>
<p>「I feel sorry for the series of commotions that took place in Acrab and the damage that has been done to you. We can’t catch the culprit for doing so right now, but I swear I’ll eradicate them soon. I may need your help, so I hope you are safe and sound. I hope this will be of comfort to you who have suffered.</p>
<p>P.S. I secretly hope that you will become the new Black Rose of the Empire.</p>
<p>– Julius, Countess Alshine’s strong supporter. 」</p>
<p>I read the second to last line once again. The letter felt very informal and personal. As expected of Julius. He was friendly with everybody.</p>
<p><em>Both of them must have gone crazy!</em></p>
<p>Kaichen was acting all strange today and Julius had sent a very strange letter. <em>What the hell is ‘Black Rose of the Empire’? </em>I never heard about it even in the novel.</p>
<p>There was the rumour that Count Alshine’s garden in Acrab was filled with black roses. Right now, those roses were just buds and they hadn’t bloomed. But that was just some sort of exoticisation that people did. The roses were just roses. Besides, just because we had a garden of black roses didn’t mean I was a black rose.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because of the Alshine lineage. Ours was the only family who had black hair and black eyes.  It wasn’t very common in the empire. Black eyes and black hair were very rare in this world. People didn’t dislike it but it was considered unusual for someone to have it.</p>
<p>“Do you know what the letter is talking about?”</p>
<p>“Roughly”</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to take this?”</p>
<p>“As you please,” Kaichen said, drinking his tea gracefully.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to make of that. I looked at the small key that was in the envelope with the letter. My eyes widened in surprise as I saw the unique engraving on the key.</p>
<p>“Is this the High Bank key?!”</p>
<p>“I suppose so.”</p>
<p>“Why is he giving this to me…? Could it be His Highness’ slush fund?!” Was it the secret hoard of money that I heard a lot about? I put the key gingerly into the envelope. I folded the letter neatly and put it in my pocket. I returned the envelope with the key to Kaichen. He burst out laughing.</p>
<p>He leaned back on the sofa, laughing. He looked so carefree and striking that it took my breath away.</p>
