            <p><strong>Chapter 152</strong></p>
<p>The banquet hall, which was buzzing, suddenly became quiet and everyone focused on Dalia. When a woman has been neglected and deemed invisible and shows up dressed beautifully, people find her even more exquisite than before. The main character entering a ball is no less than a hero’s appearance in a movie. It is very important and shows more about a person’s position, appearance, and current atmosphere at once.</p>
<p>The reason I suddenly thought of this was because I heard a shout from a servant who served drinks.</p>
<p>“Oh my, that person is…!”</p>
<p>“She is more beautiful than I’ve heard.”</p>
<p>“Oh my God, she is with Sir Tenebre…”</p>
<p>When a hall is filled with countless people whispering and gossiping, the room sounds like a roar of overwhelming sound. I could see them holding their fans to shield their mouths, but I could still hear what they said.</p>
<p>Kaichen, who was used to such whisperings and numerous gazes focusing on him, walked casually forward. But I wasn’t so lucky. I felt ashamed. I still didn’t feel comfortable being looked at by so many people.</p>
<p>“Oh… welcome, Countess Alshine!”</p>
<p>Julius was laughing and talking with people around him, but when he saw me, he greeted me amiably. Even more eyes now focused on me. It was uncommon for the Crown Prince to greet someone first with their title unless the Crown prince felt close with them. Naturally, many people were curious.</p>
<p>“Kaichen, you’re here, too! Tomorrow the sun will rise in the west.” Julius pretended to be surprised to see Kaichen even though he knew all about my plan.</p>
<p>Kaichen let go of my hand and bowed respectfully to Julius. “I greet the Crown Prince. May the Blue Dragon be with you.”</p>
<p>It was a greeting that I had read so many times in the original novel. I tried to curtsy to pay my respects. “Subject of the Empire greets the Crown Prince. May the blue dragon be with you.”</p>
<p>I lowered my eyes slightly, and bent my knee at a certain angle, as was proper. It was the most difficult etiquette I had had to learn so far. It was also the most annoying. Everything had to be done in moderation otherwise it would be taken as an insult.</p>
<p>“May the breath of the blue dragon reach you,” Julius responded.</p>
<p>I had read about that response a lot in the original novel, too. However, hearing it for the first time, in person, felt different. Just as well, because my legs were cramping. I straightened my knees and stood up straight.</p>
<p>“That’s enough curtsy. It feels awkward,” said Julius with a smile. He approached Kaichen and patted him on the shoulders. “I don’t know how long it’s been since I’ve seen you here!” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s been a decade.”</p>
<p>“Haha! It’s already been that long! I don’t think you’re here to celebrate my birthday, though. Is it because of Countess Alshine?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Julius laughed loudly at his brisk answers. However, Julius was the only one having a laugh at the banquet hall. Everyone had gathered around them now and they all looked at Kaichen as though they were either shocked or surprised to see him here. The murmur grew louder and louder. Although I was very sure Julius knew about how the atmosphere had changed, he pretended as if everything was alright.</p>
<p>“Thanks to the Countess, I get to see a friend who’s so adamant to not attend birthday balls!”</p>
<p>“Thanks to me?! I feel like Teacher is just afraid to let me outside because I might make a fool of myself. I guess I have to work harder to prove my capabilities,” I said, trying to be friendly.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s eyebrows twitched, but he did not respond. I think it was because he knew that those words were meant for others to hear. <em>It was good to practice on what I planned to say with Julius.</em></p>
<p>While in my own world, reading novels and watching anime, I wondered what was so rude about talking directly or doing away with unnecessary etiquettes. It was, for obvious reasons, so difficult for me to remember everything in this world. Julius, frequently, shook his head and mumbled that I was impossible. He eventually gave up on teaching me and told me to speak as little as possible at the banquet. That was fine by me!</p>
<p>“I think that just being Kaichen’s favorite disciple is already a great fortune for the Empire, but you’re working even harder! You are too greedy.”</p>
<p>“If I want to be of help to Your Highness, shouldn’t that be the case?” we had a friendly conversation while also making sure we leaked enough information for the guests to put two and two together.</p>
<p>The goal was to convey that I was Kaichen disciple, chosen by him, and also someone close to Julius, who himself is a disciple of the magic tower and a magic swordsman, not to mention, the Crown Prince of the Empire. It was also to communicate that I was a person of significance and not to be trifled with. Julius had said this would make my social life a little easier in the future.</p>
<p>After a while, the man, who had been talking with Julius, slowly approached us. “Your Highness, please don’t hog her all to yourself and introduce her to us, too. Everyone is curious.” He was neatly dressed and wore glasses. He looked very intellectual and scholarly.</p>
