<p><strong>Chapter 49</strong></p>
<p>“What? Not really. Why? What did you say? He seemed angry.”</p>
<p>“Oh, as long as you didn’t hear it, that’s alright. I guess you will have to walk back to the cabin. So sorry about that. Will you be okay with that?”</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised with how Julius talked to me. It felt so different from when he talked to Kaichen. He was polite and formal. But the protagonist in the original novel did talk formally when greeting others. And… I had heard what Julius had said to Kaichen.</p>
<p>“The way Count Alshine looks at you is strange. An unnatural relationship between teacher and student. What do you think?” That was what Julius had said to Kaichen.</p>
<p><em>What does he mean by ‘strange’? If I get hate from Kaichen because of this, are you going to take responsibility Mr. Main Character? We have only just begun to talk properly. </em>I sighed. I hadn’t even carried my magical bag. How was I going to carry everything back?</p>
<p>“Well, it can’t be helped,” I said, “I guess I will go rent a carriage.”</p>
<p>“I was wondering what you were buying. I see that it’s all ingredients for cooking. Are you going to make Kaichen cook?”</p>
<p>“Um… as a disciple, I must treat my teacher to delicious food. In fact, I am ashamed to say that I asked him to accept me as a disciple in exchange for anything I could do to serve him.”</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>“Fortunately, he likes my cooking. I was able to become his <em>temporary </em>student.” I emphasized the word ‘temporary’.</p>
<p>This world that I am in revolves around the protagonist, Julius. So, naturally, I had to please him and get on his good side. So, I smiled at him and decided to praise his friend, Kaichen, to the skies.</p>
<p>Julius was loyal to Kaichen. They were childhood friends. So I thought if I complimented Kaichen, he would think positively of me.</p>
<p>“Oh…you are the only person that has such a positive opinion of Kaichen,” said Julius, “Usually, people just avoid him and with good reason. He doesn’t take warmly to anybody at all.”</p>
<p>I pasted a smile on my face. “The reason why people are like that is because they only approach him for something they need,” I said, “And if he refuses, they judge him. But I know that teacher has a very warm heart and cares about everyone deeply.” I praised Kaichen as I rented a wagon and loaded up my things.</p>
<p>I was too tired to see Julius’ gaze full of mischief. I bought a cool drink to moisten my throat and hopped on the wagon. Julius, calmly, followed me.</p>
<p>“I assume you like Kaichen?” he said in a secretive voice.</p>
<p>I almost dropped the drink I was holding. Julius was like one of those kids in school who deliberately asked you what you thought of the guy in the other class to get you to admit to things.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I didn’t spill much of my drink. As I wiped my hands, I wondered what to respond to his question. I must not overreact. <em>Maybe he is just asking me if I like Kaichen as a general human being.</em></p>
<p>“Of course,” I said and nodded.</p>
<p>Julius excitedly clapped his hands. It was only then that I recalled what Kaichen had called me. ‘Frivolous’. I guess this was how I was. I decided to reflect on my own actions from now on.</p>
<p>After that was sorted, I had to listen to Julius’ childhood stories. I was sick of it after a while. But who would dare say that to the Crown Prince? I knew about his childhood. I was interested only when he described his time with Kaichen because it wasn’t described in detail in the book.</p>
<p>After the wagon reached Kaichen’s house, I got off the wagon and sighed. “Your Highness, as much as I love your stories,” I said, “I have to move these things so I might not be able to listen.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that is simple,” said Julius, “Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Julius wriggled his fingers and a blue magical light appeared. The light surrounded the luggage and then everything disappeared. “And I thought all this time, you had a real hobby of traveling in a wagon.”</p>
<p>Julius laughed. I could see why Kaichen was so annoyed by him. I was reminded that he was also a student along with Kaichen. He was a powerful wizard. His cheery and laid-back attitude fooled everyone. I realized that it would be a mistake to underestimate this man. But… he could have teleported us and saved us a ride!</p>
<p>“There isn’t a lot of chances I get to ride a wagon and relax,” said Julius jokingly.</p>
<p>A sarcastic retort crept up to my lips, but I suppressed it. When I went inside the house, I felt calmer. Kaichen was in the living room, reading a book. Having spent time with Julius, I definitely preferred Kaichen more.</p>
<p>“Teacher!” I was relieved to see him. I thought my ears would bleed if I listened to any more of Julius’ stories. Hopefully, Kaichen won’t leave abruptly from here like he did before. “Teacher, are you hungry? I’ll prepare a meal fast.”</p>
<p>“Me too! I want to eat too!” added Julius.</p></div>
