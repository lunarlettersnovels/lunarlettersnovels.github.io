            <p><strong>Chapter 151</strong></p>
<p>I heard him chuckle. “Yeah, I know.”</p>
<p>My heart raced at his cocky answer. <em>Have I ever loved someone so much in my past life?</em> Kaichen is a character in a novel, and Dalia, whom I possessed, is also a character in the novel, but this is reality at least for the both of us at this moment. <em>Why am I obsessed with him?</em></p>
<p>“Hm… I have always been really pretty, too. It’s just that I don’t dress up, but I am beautiful. It’s just that I don’t brag about it.” I felt so embarrassed after blurting that out that I wanted to disappear. Then I heard his laughter.</p>
<p>“I know that too,” he said.</p>
<p>I gave up on saying anything more. If I kept at it, I might make a bigger fool of myself. I had worked hard for this the entire week. I didn’t want to ruin it. My plan was meticulously based on the information gathered through Julius. I couldn’t fail even before I started. <em>I’m going to confess today and put this to an end, for better or for worse!</em></p>
<p>I had a good hunch about today. He told me I was pretty and escorted me despite hating crowded places.</p>
<p>When I had told Julius that I intended to confess to Kaichen, he had laughed for a while and then gave me serious advice to put my plan into action. As the main character, he had a big heart. I felt a bit sorry for thinking that he was a little arrogant. Thanks to Julius’ help, the plan to ‘confess successfully to Kaichen’ began today.</p>
<p>As we walked down the road to the ballroom, I racked my brains to break the ice. I should say something…</p>
<p>“Teacher, I heard the party will end around evening.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, on his whim, he suddenly moved the time to lunch and said he wanted to finish it early.”</p>
<p>“Right, His Highness… He is so capricious.” <em>I’m sorry, Your Highness</em>.</p>
<p>“Well, yes. And it cost double the budget, too.”</p>
<p>“It cost twice as much because they used the most gorgeous West Amelia Palace, instead of the ballroom in Senil, the crown prince’s palace.”</p>
<p>I smiled awkwardly and decided to shut my mouth before I said something stupid. Julius had changed the timing and the venue for me. He felt that the Amelia Palace would be the perfect place to confess to Kaichen. Amelia palace was said to be the prettiest at sunset, so the ball would also be finished in the evening.</p>
<p><em>It was a bit strange to insist on ending the ball even though I said we could get out on our own. </em>But Julius had insisted, and I had agreed with a big smile. I was very grateful for his burdensome positive attitude at the time, but I started to have some doubts after hearing Kaichen’s words.</p>
<p><em>“Hm… a yellow rose garden will work well, right? There is a very nice yellow rose garden in the Amelia Palace’s backyard in the Imperial Palace. It’s a place His majesty loves, so by magic, roses bloom all year round. I think it would be better than going to Kaichen’s house and making roses bloom by magic.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But it’s the Imperial Palace. How could I use the Imperial Palace for personal reasons? Amelia Palace…”</em></p>
<p><em>‘It’s the palace my mother used. No one is using it now. But it’s true that going without any business is a little…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes, see? So, it’s better we go to the Willow House…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Maybe I can announce a birthday ball at Amelia Palace?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Is that possible?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I can ask my father. If I tell him that I want to spend my birthday at my mother’s palace, he won’t say no.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But that’s troublesome for you…”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, because I am willing to help for the sake of my friend’s love.”</em></p>
<p>On second thought, I think it wasn’t for the love of his friend. Maybe he just wanted to watch us and have a laugh. <em>Damn, I feel foolish now. </em>But it was too late to make changes to the plan. As Kaichen said, it cost twice as much, and the time had been changed just for my sake. So, the plan must succeed.</p>
<p>“Teacher, you really can’t leave my side today.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>“No matter what.”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Kaichen said. It was a relief. It would be troublesome if something came up and he left on short notice. It would ruin everything. This confession was supposed to happen at sunset. I was so nervous that my palms started sweating and I tried to distract myself by thinking about other things. We finally reached the entrance of Amelia Palace.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>What I felt while reading the scene about the entrance to the ball in the novel was a kind of catharsis.</p>
