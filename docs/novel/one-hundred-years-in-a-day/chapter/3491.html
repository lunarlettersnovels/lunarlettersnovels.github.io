            <p><strong>Chapter 33</strong></p>
<p>“It was because the method was wrong, your combination was correct,” he explained. “There are countless ways to make magic cures. The specific magic cure can be completed by combining it in a way which matches the property of the medicinal ingredients used. So, you better learn it properly.”</p>
<p>I stared at Kaichen, perplexed. Was he finally teaching me how to make magical cures after so much resistance?</p>
<p>“When mixing a medicine with a cold property, you need to mix it with about a third of the mana,” he continued. “But when you mix two ingredients with cold and hot property, you need to add more mana.” He looked at me. “The reason you kept failing was because you couldn’t control the amount of mana used.”</p>
<p>I blinked as I listened to him explaining everything calmly. I was still confused. <em>Why is Kaichen, who doesn’t want me as a disciple at all and doesn’t want to teach me, calmly explaining things about magical cures? </em>I wondered what had made him change his mind. I listened to him attentively and nodded.</p>
<p>“So that’s what happened!” I exclaimed. “I did think there would be several combinations but didn’t know it would depend on the property of the ingredients!”</p>
<p>“When you feel better again, I will give you a book on how to make mixtures,” he said. “If you read it, you will be able to understand it easily.”</p>
<p><em>He is going to give me another book on…. </em>I wondered whether Kaichen had hit his head somewhere. I remembered him vaguely helping me when I had collapsed but I couldn’t remember the whole thing. <em>Did something happen? </em>I frowned at the thought. I had experienced memory loss when I possessed Dalia’s body. I had to accept it when I found out that it was a symptom of alcoholism.</p>
<p><em>Is it a temporary memory loss? It probably has to do with severe alcoholism. </em>I didn’t know whether it was the privilege of being transmigrated to another world or if Dalia indeed had sharp memory. Thanks to it, I never forgot what I saw or read so it helped me a great deal when learning about various fields. The painful memories, though, was entirely another matter altogether. This good-for-nothing body had just that advantage.</p>
<p>“Teacher, are you accepting me as an official student?” I asked, cautiously.</p>
<p>At my question, he went quiet for a while. And then he scowled. “You are a ‘temporary’ disciple, but I don’t want to be an incompetent teacher. So, I am teaching you.”</p>
<p>“So, you indeed are accepting me as a temporary disciple at least?!” He looked displeased with himself, but he didn’t deny it. He looked adorable so I laughed.</p>
<p>My body didn’t get any better but my relationship with Kaichen improved. At least I felt like it did. Kaichen had left three bottles of the medicine on my desk and left the room. He left without saying anything further, so I thought that he had nursed me back to health to the best of his abilities. I laid back and buried my face in the pillow.</p>
<p>“Ugh……I’m hungry.”</p>
<p>The medicine Kaichen had made (the one I had intended to make) was to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms to some extent. So, it did help with the trembling and nausea. It was meant to help me eat and not vomit later. If a body is deprived of nutrients, it becomes weaker. So, the medicine was supposed to help me when I ate food to restore my health.</p>
<p>Trembling hands hindered my day-to-day life, so I mixed the medicine to reduce the trembling as much as I could. But whenever I had a headache, I couldn’t mix the medicine with the one I took for headaches because it conflicted with the gastrointestinal effects. I needed to develop my stamina to be able to take both medicines together.</p>
<p>The medicine I took really helped with the nausea and since I had barely eaten food these past few days, my body wanted nutrients. I was really hungry now. <em>I don’t have the energy to cook, though. </em>Maybe I could crawl to the kitchen and eat some fruits I had bought last time. <em>How long was I asleep?</em></p>
<p>While I was busy thinking all these things, Kaichen knocked the door and entered. I tried to wriggle out of the blanket before kicking it off and sat up and awkwardly looked at him. Kaichen looked at me with his cold, golden eyes and I blushed. <em>What is wrong with me?! </em>I was bold and brazen, never embarrassed with something as silly as an eye contact! I pulled the blanket back with trembling hands. Thankfully, Kaichen didn’t make any comments. He let out a short sigh and held out the tray towards me.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” I asked looking at the tray with a bowl on it.</p>
<p>“Food,” he said, “You created a recipe for such an effective medicine, but it is not going to be of any use if your body doesn’t get the nutrients that it needs.”</p>
<p>“So, this porridge is for me?” I asked slowly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said. “I made it with ingredients that would provide necessary nutrients.”</p>
<p>“You made it yourself?!” I exclaimed with more gusto than necessary.</p>
<p>“Why? Is there a problem?” he asked, looking annoyed.</p>
<p>“What? You made it yourself?”</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>I thought I was brazen and bold but I was stumped for words. I had never before cared whether I had annoyed him with whatever I did. I would just direct a smile. But this was…</p>
