            <p><strong>Chapter 28</strong></p>
<p>I paid the price for my things and told the owner that I would come pick them up later. I really needed to purchase a change of clothes. I was surprised at the way the people in the village treated me. They were always polite and kind. Perhaps many merchants passed through here, and they were no strangers to outsiders. I was really grateful for it.</p>
<p>It was completely different from Acrab where eccentrics like Kaichen lived. People were always suspicious of outsiders in Acrab. The craftsmen always assumed the foreigners and travelers might steal their art and technique. Acrab was full of craftsmen from all over the empire who had unique trades. It was understandable for them to feel protective of their techniques, but it was still rude. They were like the dwarves from a fantasy novel, convinced that their skill was the best in the entire world while treating others as though they were less than them. In contrast, people in Sharatan, were very pleasant.</p>
<p>Because of Acrab’s attitude towards outsiders, they depended on merchant group run by Count Alshine to trade their goods outside of Acrab. Due to their eccentric nature, nobody wanted to trade with them personally.</p>
<p>I continued to explore Sharatan. “Wow! This is really fresh! Can I buy a box?”</p>
<p>“Are you having a party? Since you are an outsider, I must tell you that if you buy a lot of these, they will go bad in the hot weather.”</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you! But that’s alright, I will buy a box.”</p>
<p>I bought a few snacks and some ingredients at the food section of the market. I had learnt freezing magic and had managed to make something like a refrigerator. It wasn’t particularly difficult. I intended to convert a box into a refrigerator to store the food when I reached back to Kaichen’s. Only a small box. I didn’t want to change the atmosphere of his house.</p>
<p>“What do you call this?”</p>
<p>“It’s a blue apple, Sharatan specialty. It’s juicy and sweet as sugar. It’s a little expensive, but it’s a fruit that nobles like.”</p>
<p>I squinted at the blue apple. For some reason, its blue color reminded me of the main character, Julius. He had blue hair. He was the man I must approach if I wanted this novel to come to an end so that I could live my life peacefully.</p>
<p>“I will take five.”</p>
<p>Despite its blue color, which gave away a feeling of it being cold and maybe bitter, it was exceptionally sweet. It would be perfect for Kaichen. I put the fruits in my bag with a smile. I walked around.</p>
<p>I wasn’t feeling very well but buying things for the house was exciting. I liked how Sharatan was so lively and bustling with people. It was so opposite to Acrab. At times, it made me forget about Acrab completely and it eased the guilt weighing on my mind. By the time I was done with my shopping and reached home, it was already midnight.</p>
<p>I looked at Kaichen’s room. No light shone from under the door. I remembered his contempt and anger from this morning, so I turned away and walked to the kitchen. Kaichen stayed inside his room and didn’t come out. I started working on the kitchen. When I was done with that, I decorated my room with the furniture I had bought.</p>
<p>After wandering around Sharatan for a few days, I became familiar with the place. I even became friendly with the people there and greeted them every time I saw them. It was partly because of my open and brazen personality. Many were surprised by my fair skin and black hair. My health deteriorated day by day and I felt bloated all the time.</p>
<p><em>“Why are your eyes so sunken? Are you taking good care of yourself? You’ve been buying so many ingredients, and yet your face is still so white.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Why don’t you go see a doctor? Your face looks so pale it feels like you’re about to die soon.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Dalia! Why are you sitting on the ground? Are you dizzy again? Didn’t I tell you to go see a doctor?”</em></p>
<p>Store owners and villagers alike threw words of caution and concern at me since I had become fairly close to them in these few days. They were so kind, but I didn’t have the heart to tell them that I was suffering because I was a recovering alcoholic. I just smiled at their concerns for me and thanked them.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what Kaichen did in his room all day and night. But when he came out after four days, he took one look at me and said, “What is this? Even a day-old corpse would look better than you!” I took it to mean that he was worried about me in his own way.</p>
<p>A week passed. I couldn’t get out of my bed. I blinked at the sunrise because it was too bright. My condition seemed to worsen day by day. The trembling of my hands and feet were so extreme that I couldn’t function normally. I sat up slowly and dragged myself to the bathroom. I washed my face with cold water, but my mind was still hazy, and I felt very weak. I looked in the mirror, horrified.</p>
<p>I hadn’t been able to sleep because of insomnia and nightmares, therefore, Dalia’s body had deteriorated even more. Her face looked back at me in the mirror with rough, pale skin, frizzy hair and sunken eyes with huge dark circles underneath.</p>
<p><em>What the heck?! </em>I cursed at Dalia. <em>This is all your fault! Why in hell do I have to suffer like this all because of you? </em>My anger flared and bubbled. I impulsively punched the mirror.</p>
<p>The loud shatter rang through the quiet room. Broken glasses scattered everywhere. Blood dripped from my hands. But my frustration didn’t go away. The pain made me even more angry. I knew that I was being irrational, but it didn’t matter at the moment. I was so angry. I didn’t even get to choose a body. <em>Why? Why do I have to go through so many hardships? Why in hell did I transmigrate into this damned novel in this d*mned body?!</em></p>
