            <p><strong>Chapter 228</strong></p>
<p>Exchetra lifted the pen while chuckling.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the mansion remained largely unchanged, even after Yanghwa arrived. However, Kaichen had to put her under sleep magic since apparently, she would scream like a banshee every time she woke up, much to everyone’s chagrin. So, Julius and Kaichen agreed to keep her asleep until the Great Wiseman, Hamal, arrived.</p>
<p>After sweating profusely from Sharatan, I decided to take a cold bath before dinner. The tub was so large that it felt like swimming in it. I couldn’t help but think that adding a swimming pool to the mansion wouldn’t be a bad idea.</p>
<p>With a happy laugh, I casually dried my hair and put on a robe before leaving the bathroom. That’s when I noticed Kaichen sitting on the sofa as if he belonged there. He seemed quite relaxed, holding his magical book as if it was his own room.</p>
<p>“This is my room,” I reminded him, feeling cheeky.</p>
<p>“What’s the problem?” he asked, still engrossed in his book.</p>
<p>“You told me to knock before coming in. How can you just come in while I’m taking a bath?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a different situation?” he said, looking up at me with a small smile. I couldn’t help but chuckle at his response, realizing that our relationship was still in the early stages, and that my previous intrusion into his personal space was not the same as his current presence in my room.</p>
<p>I let out a soft groan as I approached Kaichen, water dripping from my hair. His eyebrow arched as I smiled at him with my eyes. “What are you grinning about?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I know you like it when I smile,” I replied, my lips curving upwards. Despite his initial resistance, I knew that Kaichen would become a wild animal when we were in bed together.</p>
<p>I sat down on his lap, the thin robe barely covering my legs, a deliberate attempt to tempt him. Kaichen sighed when he noticed that I was wearing nothing underneath, but I could see the deMastere flicker in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Master, you seem a little too eager,” I teased, giggling as his hands instinctively wrapped around my waist and I held onto his neck.</p>
<p>“We have a guest in the mansion. You can’t just come like this,” I warned.</p>
<p>“I didn’t come through the door, so it’s fine,” he replied.</p>
<p>“They’ll still know,” I countered, my eyes narrowing. Despite the fact that most people knew about our relationship, we enjoyed pretending to be sneaking around.</p>
<p>Kaichen brushed my hair, his magic drying it instantly. He then ran his fingers over my cheek and neck, sending shivers down my spine.</p>
<p>“You’ll catch a cold,” Kaichen scolded me.</p>
<p>“It was too hot today,” I explained, shrugging off his concern.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you before, your low body temperature makes you more susceptible to catching a cold,” he reminded me.</p>
<p>I knew that the poison in my body prevented me from catching a cold easily, but I liked the fact that Kaichen was always concerned about my well-being.</p>
<p>Before he could say anything else, I leaned in and kissed him, pushing my tongue into his mouth. He hesitated for a moment before his tongue eagerly intertwined with mine.</p>
<p>As I m*aned and sucked on his tongue more aggressively, Kaichen’s hands found their way inside my loosely tied robe. His hot touch against my cold skin sent shivers down my spine, making me feel like I was burning up.</p>
<p>He bit down on my lower lip, clearly displeased with how cold I was. I opened my eyes to see his bloodshot gaze, his patient demeanor giving way to a more primal desire.</p>
<p>I didn’t know when I had turned on his switch, but as I looked at him, I knew that Kaichen was done being patient.</p>
<p>He touched my breast through the fabric of my robe and pulled me closer to him. I felt a rush of desire wash over me as I responded to his touch. Our intimacy was always passionate, but Kaichen never lost control.</p>
<p>‘<em>This is new</em>,’ I thought as I lowered my arms from around his neck and gently pushed against his back. Our kiss was hot and intense, and I couldn’t help but stare into his golden eyes, which were hazy with passion. I deepened the kiss, running my tongue over his lips and allowing him to suck on it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he lifted me up and placed me on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Ha…”he sighed.</p>
<p>“Master, why are you-”</p>
<p>I gasped as he continued to kiss me, his lips moving down my neck and over my collarbone. He caressed my shoulders and his fingers trailed over my body, igniting my passion even further.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to care about leaving marks on my skin. At first, I was worried about how I would wear dresses with these marks, but Kaichen’s magic always did wonders. It was a shame that he didn’t leave any marks, but then again, he would occasionally leave some on my breast or thigh, which would make me laugh.</p>
