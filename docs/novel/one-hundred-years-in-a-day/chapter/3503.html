            <p><strong>Chapter 21</strong></p>
<p>It was a warm and beautiful house. It was hard to even imagine that the cold and indifferent Kaichen lived here. After arriving home, he seemed to relax a bit. He looked so comfortable here that eventually it became clear that this was where he belonged. I wanted to laugh but I thought he might really kick me out to fend for myself out there in the wilderness.</p>
<p>“You can use the second room on the second floor,” said Kaichen.</p>
<p>Unlike the exterior, where the house seemed to be one with nature, the interior was warm, neat and clean. I could not see a grain of dust. Somehow, it suited Kaichen very well. The interior has a few items of need and didn’t waste space unnecessarily.</p>
<p>After reaching the room which Kaichen had designated for me, I burst out laughing. “This has really exceeded my expectations!”</p>
<p>It would have been nice to go to the magic tower, but I had never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would come to his house. And his house was nothing less than something out of a fairy tale. The room was empty with only a bed. Maybe he didn’t have many guests visiting him, if at all.</p>
<p>It was ridiculously empty, and it suited his personality perfectly. “It’s really different from what I would have imagined,” I chuckled.</p>
<p>Cold-hearted Archmage with severe mysophobia. Kaichen, in the novel, was always faithful to the protagonist. He always rescued Julius from crisis. It was difficult to see how Kaichen actually was. I didn’t know his personality well. After travelling with him for a week, I learnt a lot about him.</p>
<p>Kaichen, unlike how he looked, was a man who liked sweets. The original novel always showed him as someone who was picky about his food, so I paid a lot of attention while cooking. Kaichen ate well generally but he had some foods that she wouldn’t touch at all and he made no effort to hide it. I observed him for a while and learnt that he hated carrots but liked meat, and he loved fish. He had enjoyed the black rabbit stew that I had made, but I was sure he loved the fish I caught from the river because he didn’t spare anything. I had tried cooking various dishes to gauge his taste.</p>
<p>Kaichen had once smiled, out of the blue, when he tasted the pancakes I had packed in my magic bag. <em>That was cute…</em>. As a cook, I wanted to find out everything about what he liked.</p>
<p>I threw my bag on the floor and laid on the bed. I wanted to soak myself in warm water and relax but I felt so tired that I was unwilling to get up. My feet throbbed and I felt sleepy. I had overworked myself and sleeping outside had never been comfortable.</p>
<p>“Ah… It’s just the beginning, but I’m already so tired.”</p>
<p>This was all because of the low stamina of this body. Dalia was a woman of a noble household who grew up rich and spoiled. I didn’t have memories of her, but I could tell by looking at her body… my body. Her skin was soft, her muscles were nonexistent, and her hands didn’t have calluses. But she was beautiful. A typical kind of beauty.</p>
<p>“As expected, I need to build up my stamina first.”</p>
<p>The only thing that didn’t work in the time magic was my effort to increase my stamina. No matter how much I exercised; my body would return to its original state the next day. It was the same with swordplay or any other physically exerting sport I attempted. It was one of the reasons why my withdrawal symptoms were so hard to manage.</p>
<p>“Should I really have seen a doctor?” I muttered to myself. I sat up in bed abruptly, rubbing my eyes. “Why do I need a doctor when an Archmage is right next to me?” All I had to do was ask him to come up with a magic cure to help with the tremors. If there was no such cure, I could ask him to borrow some books on magic and medicine and make it myself. I had a fair knowledge about magical cures since I had spent the last hundred years trying to learn them.</p>
<p>There only books I could find in Acrab were on production technology and I had no choice but to learn to make different medicines on my own. There had been limited books on herbal medicine but none on magical cures! As if Acrab was rejecting magic, there were no books on magic in the city no matter where I looked. It was very strange.</p>
<p>“This is an Archmage’s house, there is no way he doesn’t have books on magic!” I dragged my body out of the bed and left the room. Trying to remember the outlook of the house, I tried to remember where his room might be. I headed to the end of the corridor at the second floor and opened the door to the room at the far end.</p>
