            <p><strong>Chapter 76</strong></p>
<p>Kaichen really had a very strong urge to cut off this annoying conversation. Julius was really very talkative for a crown prince. He should have been guarding his tongue. But Kaichen resisted his urge. He knew he would suffer even more in the future if he hung up here. He will never hear the end of this.</p>
<p>“The third point is that this could turn into something that would be disastrous.”</p>
<p>Kaichen raised a questioning eyebrow.</p>
<p>“How far are you going to trust her?” asked Julius.</p>
<p>It was a very stupid question but logical, nonetheless. Julius was a crown prince and he was sharp despite his appearance and his talkative habit.</p>
<p>Kaichen clicked his tongue. “What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“I have told you before that there is no evidence that she might be conspiring with the Momalhaut but there is no evidence to prove she isn’t, as well.”</p>
<p>“She was poisoned by them,” Kaichen pointed out.</p>
<p>“Maybe she wants us to think she was poisoned. Maybe it’s a trap.”</p>
<p>“And why would she do that? Why would she willingly take a poison that destroys her life and her state. Acrab is her territory.”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said Julius, “And it has been known to everyone that she has let it go to hell before. Wouldn’t she do it again?”</p>
<p>“Julius…”</p>
<p>“I really can’t believe how ardently you are defending her right now.”</p>
<p>Kaichen pressed his temples. He glared at Julius. <em>How was he defending her? </em>“I am not defending her. I am just pointing out valid reasons that might prove that she isn’t really with the Momalhaut and we can trust her.”</p>
<p>Julius smirked. “That surprises me so much,” he said. “Look. I know you. We grew up together. When you are obsessed with something or someone, no matter if it is for love or hate, you don’t see anything else at all. Whether you loved her or hated her, you have been constantly thinking about Countess Alshine all these years.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Julius.”</p>
<p>“Look at you now,” continued Julius. “Where is the cold and distant archmage who abhorred interacting with people?”</p>
<p>His words struck a nerve. Kaichen was quiet. This was why he hated getting close to people. They knew too much about him and used it against him. Julius was the most annoying of them all.</p>
<p>“What do you mean to say?” asked Kaichen.</p>
<p>“I am just saying, be careful,” said Julius, “Don’t get too deep into it. If, by any chance, she turns out to be conspiring with Momalhaut and if this turns out to be a trap, I will turn my sword on her to protect you my dear friend.”</p>
<p>That bothered Kaichen. The ‘turning his sword on her’ really bothered him more than he could actually say. Kaichen had been so sensitive and irritable these past few days. His house was filled with traces of her. His stomach churned every time he thought about her. The image of her smiling and waving. Whenever he closed his eyes, her face came to mind.</p>
<p>He had wanted, more than once, to tuck her hair behind her ears that kept falling onto her face. Whenever the wind rustled and blew the hair away from her face, her smile and her eyes made his heart pound. He longed for her at night.</p>
<p>Whenever he tried sleeping, her face would come to mind and he would feel so many intense emotions. He would feel a heat in his belly and his heart tried to beat out his chest. When he opened his eyes, he was always at a loss at the stiffening in his lower body.</p>
<p>Kaichen had felt confused at first because this had never happened to him. He knew that this would happen at some point in his life. He was a man. But he still couldn’t hide his shame and embarrassment. He did not want to hold and stroke it.  It was painful. He felt even more ashamed to do it when he knew the source of it was Dalia.</p>
<p>He would take a cold shower to get rid of it. The swollen member begged to be stroked for release. It l*sted after Dalia. It was so absurd that it rendered him speechless. He could not believe himself that he was l*sting after Dalia when she had been the person who had made him resolve that he wouldn’t be involved in any long-term relationships.</p>
<p>Accepting her as a disciple had been a little test on his part. He even applauded himself when he saw her happy with that wide smile. He had praised himself saying it was a good decision. It was all that was. He was still trying to deny and ignore his feelings towards her and Julius breaking it to him didn’t help.</p>
