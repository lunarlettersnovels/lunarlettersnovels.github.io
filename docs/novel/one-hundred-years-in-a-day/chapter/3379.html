            <p><strong>Chapter 144</strong></p>
<p>As I chuckled, covering my mouth with my hands, Kaichen frowned. “I’ve never done that,” he said.</p>
<p>“I guess you have always been smug,” I replied.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“The Crown Prince will be nagging you now.”</p>
<p>“If he is someone who will be crushed just because he has been humiliated like this, he is not going to be of any help to His Highness anyway.”</p>
<p>“Um… that’s right… but…”</p>
<p>He had just been chosen as the Crown Prince’s escort. He must have been happy until he was defeated so brutally. Anyone would feel embarrassed if they were humiliated before they even got to enjoy their new title. But Kaichen didn’t mind trampling on the growing sprout.</p>
<p>I opened my bleary eyes and glanced at Kaichen. He was still very upset from the restaurant and the duel. Normally, it wouldn’t come to this, because it was bothersome for him to get involved, but this time he had involved himself in the mess I had created instead of taking care of it after like in the past.</p>
<p>Kaichen crossed his arms as if he didn’t like the way I was looking at him.</p>
<p>“Do you hate Lord Chushinik that much?” I asked cautiously.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You don’t think he deserves to be the personal guard of the Crown Prince?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Teacher… let the Crown Prince choose who he wants to keep by his side.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Shaking my head, I said, “I understand you want to protect His Highness, but this is more than necessary. If you don’t allow him to choose his people, when is he going to become independent from you?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“I’m right, aren’t I? You’re not happy that there’s someone else around His Highness without your permission. That’s why you were so angry in the restaurant.”</p>
<p>His dearest childhood friend. Kaichen ran around not being afraid of water or fire to help Julius since childhood. I was convinced this was the reason he had been so upset..</p>
<p>“You… That’s the only thing you could think of?” he said.</p>
<p>I blinked at him owlishly. “Yes? Why?” I answered, at a loss.</p>
<p>“Never mind. I’ll be just wasting my breath.”</p>
<p>“Even if the teacher talks about it for a week, it won’t be as bad as me talking throughout the day. If talking like this was wasting your breath, then I would be dead already.”</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Yes, teacher!” I said cheerfully.</p>
<p>Kaichen looked stern. He raised his chin a little and said, “If you keep rambling, I’ll leave you behind.”</p>
<p>“Ah! You can’t do that! My leg hurts.” I smiled cheekily and grabbed Kaichen’s sleeve. Kaichen glanced at my hand holding the sleeve of his shirt, but he didn’t tell me to let go of it. I wanted to hold hands with him like in the day, but there were many eyes around and it would be awkward to hold hands while returning with mobile magic, so I swallowed my desire. My fingers twitched.</p>
<p>“E-Excuse me!” called a voice. The area was now very crowded because of the duel. Lamia hurriedly ran towards us. She looked disheveled and embarrassed. Behind her, I could see Chushinick standing there in bewilderment.</p>
<p>“I-It’s been a while. I didn’t recognize you properly and behaved disrespectfully. I am very sorry,” Lamia said.</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“I heard that you often come to Heulin, but I was heartbroken that I couldn’t see you for a long time. What a fateful coincidence to meet like this…”</p>
<p>My eyes widened at the absurdity.  A while ago she was being very bold and fighting over nothing. But now she was here pretending to be shy and timid. I was appalled at her shamelessness.</p>
<p>I thought that if she found out that it was Kaichen, she would be ashamed and hide in a corner, but I didn’t expect it to turn out like this. Was she trying to get Kaichen once again? <em>If that’s really the case, she is a real piece of work.</em></p>
<p>It’s not like anything happened between the two. Lamia was trying to court him in the past and Kaichen had brutally rejected her. It was not something that could be mended by trying again.</p>
<p>If it was me, I would not have been able to converse with him so boldly after the incident. But seeing her, it seemed like she had either forgotten about it or buried it deep inside. She looked like she was having a shy reunion with her ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>“You know there’s a birthday ball for the Crown Prince, right? I heard you’re staying in Heulin, so I’m sure you’ll be there! Anyone will want to be escorted by Mr. Kaichen.”</p>
<p><em>Not everyone, just you</em>.</p>
<p>Lamia intertwined her slender hands together and blushed, looking up at him.  “I-If it’s okay with you, you can send flowers to the Marquis Sorel mansion with an invitation… Oh, my! What am I saying.!”</p>
