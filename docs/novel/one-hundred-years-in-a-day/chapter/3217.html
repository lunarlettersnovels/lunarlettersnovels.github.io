<h3><strong>Chapter 307</strong></h3>
<p>“Why me?” I asked.</p>
<p>His Highness requested an official explanation from Julius for the three occurrences of forbidden time magic in the Kalhai Empire. They set up a meeting a week ago to discuss it.</p>
<p>So why on earth did he want to meet me?</p>
<p>“I told big brother about you!” Yanghwa answered with a beam.</p>
<p>“Oh… um… what…?” I replied back hesitantly.</p>
<p>“You saved me. I told him you wanted to use me.”</p>
<p>I closed my eyes slowly as an unbidden memory crept up my mind. Sometime back, while I was caring for Yanghwa, I felt uneasy. It felt like getting close to her meant using her. I had said those words because of that discomfort.</p>
<p><em>“For example: What do you think will happen if I try to take advantage of the princess’s position?”</em></p>
<p><em>“If you suddenly become close to the Suran Empire—you’re asking me how that feels?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes. It’s like trying to take advantage of you. Don’t you feel bad?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I can’t say no.”</em></p>
<p>It was all assumption and small talk. Still, Yanghwa had readily agreed. Even though she knew she was being used, she had accepted it readily, saying it was okay since she received help.</p>
<p>This woman… I feel uneasy.</p>
<p>“Did you say I want to take advantage of Your Highness’s position…?”</p>
<p>“Yes! I didn’t think I could help you because I had no work around the palace, so I asked my brother for help. <em>“There’s nothing your big brother can’t do, so he’ll do anything for you!”</em> Right?”</p>
<p>Yanghwa spoke with great pride, chest puffed up. She cleared her throat as if asking for praise, but she was so obnoxious that I wanted to give her a good scolding instead.</p>
<p>It was clear that Jungyeonhae didn’t call me because he wanted to help. Who would help someone who openly wants to use his precious youngest sister?!</p>
<p>He must have wanted me to be dragged to him immediately. But rather than letting out his murderous inner thoughts, he smiled and told his sister she wanted to meet me in person.</p>
<p>“…I’m quite busy right now…”</p>
<p>“No! His Highness hates people who break promises!”</p>
<p>“A promise is willingly made by two parties. It’s not something only one side believes in. That doesn’t make it a promise.”</p>
<p>“I talked a lot about you… I tried my best…  I told him you’re my favorite person… I was bragging…”</p>
<p>Yangwha’s eyes glistened. She grabbed my clothes, looking at me with a stricken face, her lips pursed. “And His Highness Julius also said it would be nice for you to meet older brother,” she added.</p>
<p>“What?! His Highness the Prince?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“He asked me to convey the message since he’s busy and couldn’t do it himself.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>There’s a communication stone even if he doesn’t tell in person. Although Julius’s shallow tricks were quite evident, I held my tongue.</p>
<p>“He suggested having dinner together tonight! He said he wanted to try your cooking… Can’t it be done?”</p>
<p>I sighed and pressed my forehead with my hand. It’s awkward enough to have a conversation, and now, serving a meal. Wasn’t he coming here to express gratitude? Do I have to apologize?</p>
<p>Compared to Yanghwa, the precious youngest princess of the vast empire, I might just be a Countess, but still, I am a noble.</p>
<p>But when will there be another situation where I serve a meal personally to the Emperor of the Suran Empire? More than anything, the fact that Julius personally suggested a meeting means I have some business to attend to with Jungyeonhae.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to, but reluctantly, I nodded.</p>
<p>“Alright. The envoys are staying at the palace, so…” I started when Yanghwa suddenly interrupted.</p>
<p>“His Highness said he’s coming here!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Should I accept this as an honor, or should I consider it rude for someone to come without even giving a notice?</p>
<p>Yanghwa, bouncing with joy, tightly held onto my hand. Her innocent laughter was so pure that it washed away all the cluttered thoughts in my mind, momentarily at least.</p>
<p>“I’ve often heard from my sisters that I’m foolish. So, I don’t know what difficulties you’re facing right now.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“The Young Lady I fought with at the garden party died. You were taken away and came back horribly injured… … I feel like it’s all because I acted like a fool… … I was scared.”</p>
<p>“It’s not Your Highness’s fault.”</p>
<p>“Everyone says that, but my conscience doesn’t agree. You were in pain, and I couldn’t do anything. Even if I knew that meeting my older brother would lead to a big scolding, I immediately rushed over and asked for help… because it was all I could do.”</p>
<p>Did Yanghwa go that far? I had no idea.</p>
<p>We couldn’t have a proper conversation these days. The moment I saw her after I recuperated, I thought she must have been sick with worry and cried a lot.</p>
<p>“His Highness Julius, Dalia, and Lord Kaichan are all very precious to me. I want to be of help. Even if I’m from a foolish country… If being a princess can help, then so be it.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“As much as I can… <em>I hope it’s worth it.”</em></p>
<p>Yanghwa whispered the last few words. Although it wasn’t appropriate to show such formality, it felt right this moment. I raised my hand and gently stroked Yanghwa’s head.</p>
<p>“Are you so moved that your nose is stuffed, Your Highness?”</p>
<p>I smiled. Indeed, Yanghwa was Julius’s greatest ally. Being the protagonist meant being Julius’s companion. It provided greater strength than anything else.</p>
