            <h3>Chapter 339</h3>
<p>Glancing around the altar, I saw the zombie hordes attacking each other aimlessly. Groups of figures in black attire were scattered about, likely belonging to the Momalhaut faction.</p>
<p>The aristocrats-turned-zombies weren’t being attacked. They seemed to be spared for some reason.</p>
<p>Was there some kind of mark?</p>
<p>The short violet tentacles had all disappeared, and at the end of the altar, a purple spherical shape was forming.</p>
<p>It seemed like preparation for an ominous magic spell. Though invisible, I could feel terrifying magical power converging into the purple sphere from three directions.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the three territories where time magic manifested.</p>
<p>I momentarily wondered if Acrab was unscathed. But I shake off the complicated worries.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>There was a scream, and clashing metal armor was heard. Julius stood at the forefront with his blue hair fluttering.</p>
<p>“Exchetra! To commit such atrocities…!”</p>
<p>No matter how much one expected it, seeing it in person was different.</p>
<p>Julius made a pained expression. His hand clutching the sword was trembling. I heightened my five senses a few times and could see Julius’s expression in detail, even from afar.</p>
<p>Beside him were the Duke of Manuwell and his sons, Daiman and Duran.</p>
<p>How would Kaichen react if he found out that the spectators of the ceremony, who were thought to be the safest, were actually at the heart of danger?</p>
<p>‘No one knew that Exchetra had been increasing her magic power in a wicked way.’</p>
<p>At Julius’ words, Exchetra, standing at the end of the altar, spoke.</p>
<p>“Brother, what’s the standard for atrocity?”</p>
<p>Even though she was so far away that only her silhouette could be seen, her voice sounded as clear as if she were speaking right next to me.</p>
<p>“These things! These miserable and horrible deeds are what define atrocity! Doing what human beings cannot!”</p>
<p>“Haha.”</p>
<p>It was a short laugh. Not a laughter that felt like amusement. Like a flower blooming at her fingertips, the purple sphere grew.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. It doesn’t feel miserable or… horrible. However, if you think so, then it must be.”</p>
<p>Her speech felt somewhat sluggish.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the knights who came with Julius were brandishing their swords to restrain the zombies running amok in all directions.</p>
<p>“The notion that humans cannot commit such acts is wrong, Julius. It’s precisely because we’re human that we can commit these atrocious deeds.”</p>
<p>Her slightly whispering tone almost felt gentle, as if imparting new knowledge.</p>
<p>“Killing one’s kind is what humans excel at, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Julius tightened his grip on the sword, seemingly taken aback. However, he couldn’t think of a retort to her words and remained silent.</p>
<p>Seems like he was speechless. After all, Exchetra’s words weren’t entirely wrong.</p>
<p>‘That bastard is still as righteous as always.’</p>
<p>I left the righteous Julius behind and maneuvered as close to the altar as possible. I dispelled the concealment magic. It was pointless to waste mana when Exchetra would undoubtedly sense it.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, that thing has drained them of both magic and vitality! Killing it will end things!”</p>
<p>The zombie hordes, addicted to narcotics and mixed poisons, could be saved since they could be detoxified.</p>
<p>The other Tenebres were engrossed in research to the point they almost coughed blood. They worked day and night to thoroughly analyze the components of the mixed poison and further upgrade the antidote I created.</p>
<p>With Hamal’s help, they discovered a way to temporarily relieve drug addiction. What we produced was a mixed potion.</p>
<p>Olganos analyzed the five ingredients, Nene chose the ingredients to combine for the most effective mix, and Michelle stayed up all night for a full week to prepare it.</p>
<p>It could be considered a labor of blood, sweat, and tears. Mass production was impossible, but since its effects were so remarkable that just one drop could provide temporary relief, we could produce enough medicine to save thousands of citizens in a short time.</p>
<p>However, the situation was different for the nobles gathered at the altar.</p>
<p>Although they were raging due to the mixed poison, their life force had bottomed out from having all their magic drained by Exchetra.</p>
<p>Even if we administered the antidote, it would only calm them; they were going to die anyway. In fact, some of them were already collapsing to the ground.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget, Your Majesty! The most important thing today is to save as many people as possible!”</p>
<p>I shouted a little coldly at Julius, who was shocked by my words that suggested killing civilians.</p>
<p>Today, I was using up all the stamina I would use in my lifetime as I avoided the nobles of the zombie hordes rushing towards me. If it weren’t for those drugged attackers, I would have undoubtedly been caught in the fray. I truly had no talent for fighting with my body.</p>
<p>Although I wanted to push them all away with magic, there were many watching eyes. It would have been possible if it had only been Julius, but behind him were the Imperial Guard and the Palace Knights.</p>
<p>Even the words I just uttered shouldn’t have been said.</p>
<p>It was natural, considering that those who had turned were the nobles, the empire’s backbone.</p>
<p>What can I do? I’ll just have to bear with it. Merely refraining from directly killing them was the most I could do.</p>
<p>I lifted my foot onto the steps looming before me, gritting my teeth at the dark staircase.</p>
