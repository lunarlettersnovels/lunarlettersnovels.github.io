            <p><strong>Chapter 171</strong></p>
<p>Most noble families supported Akshetra, but she made an effort to ensnare the social butterflies and treated them special so that they went out and praised her as the Princess. It ultimately built her image while placing her in the position of authority.</p>
<p>“However, there is a rumor that the Archmage and Countess Alshine do not just have a regular teacher and student relationship.”</p>
<p>“I heard that rumor too. It’s a special relationship, so the Archmage escorted the Countess to the ball.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that can’t be!” Lamia, who had been rejected by Kaichen in the past, retorted. Her face turned red.</p>
<p>“Kaichen just cherishes her because she is his very first disciple. Have you ever seen him take an interest in a woman?”</p>
<p>“But… the way he looked at her at the ball was more than just looking at a disciple. It was clear to everyone who saw it…,” said Devonette, daughter of Marquis Talley.</p>
<p>She loved reading fairy tales and romance dramas, but now she seemed to be satisfied with the brewing drama between the Archmage and his disciple.</p>
<p>“Devonette! Do you only look at the revered Archmage with such probing eyes? That’s indecent!” said Lamia.</p>
<p>Lamia was overreacting but Akshetra watched them with amusement. It was easy to understand that Archmage and his disciple had something special between them.</p>
<p><em>No way… Kaichen. I never thought…</em></p>
<p>Akshetra knew that Kaichen in the original novel hated Dalia Alshine, but he couldn’t hate her completely because she was also his first love. The present Dalia wasn’t the old Dalia. <em>Is that why Kaichen expressed his love, took her in as his disciple and helped her a lot? </em>Akshetra wondered. <em>It was probably not going to go the way it had in the original novel.</em></p>
<p>The relationship between them had probably changed after Dalia’s survival and Acrab’s renewal. With that alone, the novel had moved into a new direction. Akshetra liked the current developments.</p>
<p>“This is very strange. Why is Lamia reacting like this? Don’t tell me you still have feelings for the Archmage.”</p>
<p>“What are you even talking about?!”</p>
<p>As the situation gradually turned into a childish battle, Akshetra intervened with a low hollow cough. The two ladies flinched but they kept their mouths shut.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we should be arguing about their relationship, whatever it may be,” said Akshetra. “Countess Alshine’s debut in the social world was a success, anyhow. Aren’t you two supposed to be active too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Princess.”</p>
<p>The two ladies took their leave and left in haste.</p>
<p>Thinking that she might not have seen him, Asta came out of the shadows and poured a cup of tea for Akshetra.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter to her if Dalia was active in the social world. No matter how active she was, no matter how strong she was, she was nothing. Akshetra took a sip of the tea and tilted her head.</p>
<p>“So, did you notice?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she grabbed the musician and questioned her, as expected.”</p>
<p>“Of course, she did.”</p>
<p>“Princess, is it necessary that we let her know we are watching?”</p>
<p>Akshetra glanced at Asta. Unlike his neat and muscular appearance, with shoulder-length dark brown hair, his thin jawline and long, rich eyelashes, he looked prettier than the girls who just had tea a moment ago.</p>
<p>“It is certainly more fun that way,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“If you don’t know your opponent with certainty, there is no point dealing with them.”</p>
<p>“Princess, isn’t your opponent Prince Julius?”</p>
<p>“Yes. In the end, he is. However, I am curious about that child. She went out of her way to help Julius.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“She has certainly grabbed my attention now.”</p>
<p>Akshetra took another sip of the tea and put the teacup down on the table. “How’s it going with Hoiore?”</p>
<p>“It is going smoothly.”</p>
<p>“Asta, there is such a saying: ‘Give me the flesh and take the bones’.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“In Acrab, we gave away our flesh. The damage was great. Julius has not yet cleared the path to the eastern countries, but as soon as Countess Alshine’s power grows, he will reach out. It’s not far.”</p>
<p>“Shall we prepare?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to make it impossible for him to reach out. However, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to be prepared just in case. You can’t be satisfied with just one plan. That child…”</p>
<p>Akshetra slowly rose from her seat. “ Kaichen is like a bone in the meat. We will have to remove that bone if we want to reach Julius.”</p>
<p>Akshetra smiled deeply, gripped the hem of her dress and left the palace. Asta followed her.</p>
<p>“If the bone is gone, no matter how much stronger Julius is, he will be soft.”</p>
