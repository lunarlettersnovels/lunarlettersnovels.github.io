            <p><strong>Chapter 29</strong></p>
<p>“Aaaaa!” A piercing headache stabbed so painfully that it felt as though it would split my head apart. Memories came rushing but they were blurred and flickering. I bit my lips and stumbled out of the bathroom. I knew that this was a part of the withdrawal symptoms but there was nothing I could do to fix it.</p>
<p>I had tried everything. When Kaichen was cooped up in his room, I had read the book and tried all kinds of experiments and mixtures. I had used my own knowledge and tried everything in the medical book. Nothing worked. The symptoms were all so diverse that I couldn’t make a proper cure. Unfortunately, I was running out of time. It wasn’t the same as when I was trapped in the time magic and could start over the next day when something went wrong with the medicine I made for Mickey.</p>
<p>There had been plenty of time, and I observed Mickey as a third party. And… as terrible as it sounded, I had a subject to experiment on who would be returned as he was the next day. I couldn’t experiment on my own body because I only had one. And it wouldn’t be returned to me. What if it made the symptoms worse?</p>
<p>I didn’t know it would be so frustrating to be unable to save myself. I felt guilty for using a small boy to experiment on. I was horrible!</p>
<p>“Aargh!” I felt dizzy and couldn’t stand upright. I fell on my knee. Cold sweat dripped from my forehead. I felt as though my pores were on fire. My vision blurred, and all I could see was Mickey’s miserable face and his convulsing body.</p>
<p><em>It’s just a hallucination, </em>I told myself. <em>It’s just a hallucination. Mickey is not here…. </em>Holding onto that shred of rationality, I tried to recall the contents of the book. <em>Hallucination was one of the symptoms associated with withdrawal from alcohol. </em>Even though I knew all that, horrible memories and visions blurred my sight. I could not bear to see them. I could not stand hearing them scream. All the despair and resentment.</p>
<p>“—lia!” I shut my eyes. I thought that I heard someone calling me.</p>
<p>My whole body ached and itched. I felt as if bugs were gnawing on my skin. My lips were parched and dry. I bit my lips and scratched my skin. The pain didn’t go away. I kept seeing horrible things even with closed eyes. I wanted to gouge my eyes out. I was going to do just that, but I felt someone holding down my hands. I struggled and heard someone calling distantly, amidst all the screams and resentment ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>“Dalia!” A low voice called.</p>
<p><em>Dalia… Dalia… that is my name! </em>I flinched as I heard the name from among the screams. I struggled to free myself to scratch my skin to soothe the burn, to tear my skin away. But something held down my arms. I could taste blood between my lips. It was so painful. Everything hurt. “Why are you stopping me?” I screamed and sobbed. I didn’t know whether I was saying it aloud or my mind was ringing again. “It’s so painful.”</p>
<p>“Dalia. Get a hold of yourself! Open your eyes.”</p>
<p><em>Open my eyes? </em>“I would see the horrible things again,” I screamed. I didn’t know if I was screaming in reality or only in my head. “I don’t want to see. I want to gouge my eyes out. Please.”</p>
<p>“Stop it. Calm down, Dalia.”</p>
<p>I don’t know who I was begging with, but I cried and begged. It must be in my mind. “I don’t want to die. Please,” I cried. “Please don’t let me die.”</p>
<p>“I’ll help you,” said the voice, “So, stop it now.” A warm, calm energy filled my heart.</p>
<p>I could feel my skin being soothed. The itching subsided. The headache disappeared. My eyes didn’t throb anymore. I felt that this was all unlikely. <em>Is this another hallucination?</em> But the screams in my mind had stopped. The voices, the despair, the visions, everything stopped.</p>
<p>“Open your eyes, Dalia. It’s okay now.” The low voice sounded exhausted. It brought me back to my senses. My mind slowly cleared and all I could think was, <em>Ah, this is crazy!</em></p>
<p>I should have expected this. Dalia’s alcoholism was very severe. I knew that the withdrawal symptoms would get worse. Hallucinations, impulsive behavior, irrational thinking were all symptoms that were normal in this case. I was not prepared for the horrible visions. The memories of experiencing those horrible things were something no one should be subjected to.</p>
<p>Alcoholism was more horrible than I expected. I had thought of asking Kaichen for help, but I didn’t have the courage to intrude upon him. I had tried to make the cure myself. I had avoided asking him. I opened my eyes slowly. Kaichen’s face came into view. He was holding me down, maybe thinking I would try to gouge out my eyes again.</p>
<p>“Teacher…,” I mumbled. Kaichen’s eyebrows twitched in annoyance but he didn’t tell me off like he usually did.</p>
<p>“I tried… I couldn’t make the cure. Can… you help?” I winced. “If you could… I would be grateful.” I tried to smile but only winced because of the pain in my mouth. I stammered but the words wouldn’t come out properly. Eventually, I let out a dry laugh and winced again.</p>
<p>“You fool!” Kaichen reached out a hand and placed it on my forehead. The world turned black. But it was a soft darkness that enveloped all in a warm tranquility. There were no hallucinations, no screams. I felt safe and relaxed for the first time and drifted off to sleep.</p>
