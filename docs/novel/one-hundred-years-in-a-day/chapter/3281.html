            <p><strong>Chapter 242 – R 18</strong></p>
<p>My body was tense in a different way than before. His lips slowly descended onto me, stayed on the bridge of my nose, then slid down and gently landed on my cheek. My eyes trembled. He smiled and kissed the mole under my eye as well.</p>
<p>The golden eyes, which were all over me, saw me trembling like a hamster in front of a dragon.</p>
<p>“Now I’m having the last love I’ll ever have in my life,” he whispered in a voice so sweet that I wanted to record it and hear it every day.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes at his words. They were like honey, to the point where I wondered if they would melt away like this. Hearing the simple words “I like you” gave me such a thrill. Since he liked sweet desserts, I wondered if his brain had really changed to be like that. How could the proud Kaichen say such a thing?</p>
<p>Along with his low-pitched laugh, his lips covered mine happily as if they had finally found a place to settle down on. I felt a sense of stability, feeling his arms firmly embracing my waist so that I wouldn’t fall, sitting by the window, wrapped around the back of my neck. There was his familiar scent and the relief that this person is mine.</p>
<p>I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him. Kaichen was cold and emotionless. It was natural for him to look down on people, but he bent down for me to meet his gaze and whispered his love for me sweetly, without any pride. Undaunted by a lover who was jealous of her past self, who she couldn’t remember like a child, he gave me another chance to fall for him.</p>
<p>Licking my lips that were shiny with saliva, I spoke. “Ha… Master, we must live with a cat next time.”</p>
<p>“…Shut up.”</p>
<p>I giggled as if I wasn’t jealous and depressed in the first place. Biting playfully at our interlocking lips again, Kaichen ferociously twisted his tongue with mine. Gently rubbing the tender flesh of my mouth, he wrapped his tongue around mine and sucked on it. The sloppy, wet kisses became more er0tic.</p>
<p>He swallowed my saliva and held my waist before spreading my legs open. It was a gesture with a clear purpose. He groaned lowly with our lips pressed against each other. When did he look at me so fiercely, with his lips pulling apart from mine, even with silvery threads of saliva? His red-hot lips were shiny.</p>
<p>I could already feel his pillar standing tall inside his robe. Looking at the veins straining from his neck, I kissed his lips softly. “You don’t want one? Then let’s raise two. Cats need to have partners so they won’t be lonely.”</p>
<p>Kaichen sighed, letting out m0ans and low growls. His voice was lower than before, as if he was suppressing something. “Even if I say no, why are you asking?”</p>
<p>“Um…Even though you say you don’t like it, don’t you listen to everything I say?” I closed my eyes and licked my lips with a smirk. Kaichen laughed and pushed me further towards the window.</p>
<p>Pressing down on my lower back, he brought his lips to the nape of my neck. His hands were in a hurry to unbutton my shirt. As he wrapped the fine golden thread between his fingers, the unbuttoned shirt came off. My exposed skin and soft breasts couldn’t be contained by my underg@rments and welcomed him.</p>
<p>He licked my collarbone, leaving a pale pink mark. I could feel a bulge stood upright under where I straddled him.</p>
<p>He wanted to take off my shirt and bite his n!pples, but Kaichen was impatient and only sucked on my soft flesh with my shirt open halfway. He gently touched my tender chest. As if savoring my soft mounds, his touch was careful, but the strength of his grip was so strong that my hips trembled. It was already damp down there. Because he was so in-tune with my body, it was as if he knew that I was already wet. He bit his lower lip as he poked me with his bulge. Even though he knew everything, he pretended not to, and didn’t even give me what I wanted.</p>
<p>After sucking on my nipple, he gently licked around it and sucked on the other side. “Master,” I whispered. I couldn’t stand it any longer, so I ground against him with my legs wrapped around his waist, and his shoulders shook as he laughed. He was so mean. He usually gave me whatever I wanted, but why was he so mean only at times like this?</p>
<p>As if he had decided to stop playing around, he touched the n!pple that was waiting to be caressed by his tongue. He then took my peak in one bite and completely covered it with his mouth. Him licking over my are0la and biting my n!pple was rough and dizzying. I threw my head back in pleasure.</p>
<p>As he used one hand to unbutton his pants to take them off, he slightly raised his eyes, aware of me wrapped around his waist. I looked down at him, and our eyes met. “Ah…” Kaichen took my breasts out of his mouth, then stuck out his tongue to tease my nipples.</p>
<p>As I watched his rough caress, heat rushed to my face until my ears turned red. I closed my eyes tightly involuntarily when he smiled. Maybe it was because we were at the Mage Tower where he grew up. Only, he seemed more mischievous today.</p>
<p>Kaichen stopped taking off his pants and lightly snapped his fingers. Magic wasn’t learned for this, but wasn’t it fun to use while having sex? My undergarments disappeared in an instant, making me feel cool. Even though my bra disappeared, my shirt was still on. I narrowed my eyes. “Um, Master… Is this something you like?”</p>
