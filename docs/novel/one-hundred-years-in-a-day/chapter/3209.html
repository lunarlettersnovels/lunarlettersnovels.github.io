            <h3><strong>Chapter 315</strong></h3>
<p>Jungyeonhae hadn’t revealed himself as the emperor, but we both knew I knew his real status.</p>
<p>Still, no one at the table addressed ‘Your Majesty’ for Jungyeonhae or showed him courtesy as expected for an emperor. This is because he came as the head of Suran’s envoy, not as Yanghwa’s big brother. It was his intention to hide his status until he left this place.</p>
<p>As the conversation about Yanghwa concluded, the atmosphere became noticeably lighter. Jungyeonhae didn’t seem to show much interest unless it involved Yanghwa. As expected.</p>
<p>The conversation mostly revolved around pleasant things during Yanghwa’s stay, and I occasionally threw in light talk to maintain the flow.</p>
<p>“By the way, I heard you’ve overcome the taboo.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right. They call it a ‘Time Magic medium’ around here.”</p>
<p>My eyes widened, and I looked toward Kaichen. He didn’t seem shocked, as if he already knew something beforehand. Perhaps Julius told him something. No, actually… he didn’t even pay attention to Jungyeonhae tonight. It almost seemed as if he had already met him before.</p>
<p>Did he meet  Jungyeonhae with Julius?</p>
<p>If not, they might have met separately. After all, if there were anyone who could explain Time Magic the best to the emperor of Suran, it would be Kaichen.</p>
<p>“In Suran, we call them the sacrificial lambs of taboos. There aren’t many records in history, but those who survived without being sacrificed were called ‘Those who overcome the taboo.'”</p>
<p>“Oh… I see.”</p>
<p>Apparently, magic wasn’t as prevalent in the Suran Empire as in the Kalhai Empire, so it made sense that they would call it something as abstract as a legend rather than something practical as a medium.</p>
<p>“So I heard there are people who can break the taboo and openly use it as their power. This was the answer I was given when I asked for the three occurrences of Time Magic in this land.”</p>
<p>“It’s true… It’s not something you can stop.”</p>
<p>Jungyeonhae crossed his legs and placed his hands on his lap. It was a graceful gesture, but the mocking smile on his face made me feel unsettled.</p>
<p>“The ancestors made it taboo for a reason. In Suran, we do not dare to covet forbidden things because we know their horrors.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But here, it’s too easy to access what we consider forbidden magic. There are even texts detailing plausible ways to learn it if you’re curious enough… Can you still call it forbidden?”</p>
<p>I blinked my eyes slowly. Listening to Jungyeonhae’s sudden rant or criticism made me feel strange.</p>
<p>In Suran’s terms, I am merely a medium for time magic, someone who has overcome taboos. I don’t understand why I should be hearing these words from him.</p>
<p>Could it be that Julius was secretly listening to this conversation? If not, is Jungyeonhae blaming Kaichen?</p>
<p>“I don’t intend to get involved in whatever you’re doing here, but since we’re on the same continent, I can’t pass this matter lightly.”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“What’s with that expression? Do you think I don’t know that you people from Kalhai also have a continent?”</p>
<p>Gritting my teeth, I held both hands tightly under the table. My palms were damp with cold sweat. This was so different from when I had the nerve to ask for a promise.</p>
<p>Now, Jungyeonhae was speaking as the Emperor of the Suran Empire, not as Yanghwa’s big brother.</p>
<p>Kaichen had a subtle frown but did not refute Jungyeonhae’s words. It was unlike him. I became more convinced that the two of them had met before.</p>
<p>“The Prince of the Kalhai Empire asked me to tell you about the hidden history of the continent that was passed down to the Emperor of Suran.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know there was a hidden history, but I understood how absurd the request was. It was an unreasonable demand. Unlike Kaichen, I was just a noble and, if anything, the ‘one who overcame taboos’, as Jungyeonhae mentioned.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I intuitively knew I should hear this if Julius asked Jungyeonhae for this information.</p>
<p>The secrets of the continent that I, the only one who could wield time magic, the only one who had survived becoming a medium, the only one who could wield time magic, needed to know.</p>
<p>Seeing my nervousness, Jungyeonhae extended his arms, showing the tattoos adorning his limbs.</p>
<p>“I will tell you the beginning of Teramedeo.”</p>
