            <p><strong>Chapter 246</strong></p>
<p>“The person who brought you, the fallen princess, is Count Alshine, the owner of this mansion. It was my master, the owner of the mage tower, who saved you from opium addiction. It was not me, but Prince Julius, who took measures so that you could be treated here as you would be in Suran.”</p>
<p>Ja Yanghwa didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“As requested by everyone, I came to remove the remnants of the opium left in your body.”</p>
<p>Ja Yanghwa still didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“It’s fortunate that you’re not afraid of my magical power, but please think again about who were the ones who saved you and act accordingly. I hope you don’t act irresponsibly, just like how you left Suran.”</p>
<p>Kaichen let out a short sigh and walked past Ja Yanghwa, who looked like she would start crying any moment.</p>
<p>“Then, finish your meal.”</p>
<p>Before the door closed, he heard a small sob, but he turned away. He didn’t have to comfort her. He put up with a lot in a week. He didn’t even have Dalia.</p>
<p>Kaichen frowned as he watched Dalia pacing at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p>She should’ve told him that she was jealous with her usual shamelessness, so why was she dragging her feet like that?</p>
<p>He really didn’t know what she was thinking.</p>
<p>Kaichen clicked his tongue shortly and teleported to the magic laboratory on the first floor. He wanted to immediately soothe Dalia and hug her, but he had to report to Julius that he mercilessly spat cold words at Ja Yanghwa a moment ago.</p>
<p>He put some mana into his ring, and Julius waved lightly, looking tired.</p>
<p>[What’s the matter? How is she?]</p>
<p>Julius was automatically asking about Ja Yanghwa. If he really were, he should’ve come to check her out himself.</p>
<p>“As of today, the treatment is completely over. I won’t be taking care of her anymore, so Your Highness will take care of it.”</p>
<p>[What are you talking about! She said she can’t help it because she only wants you!]</p>
<p>“I still don’t want to.”</p>
<p>[Kaichen, you have to make friends with her. Won’t she be of help when discussing diplomatic relations with the Suran Empire? It was you who said that.]</p>
<p>“It’s not me who establishes the state relations. So, you can be the one to build friendships.”</p>
<p>[Are you really going to be like this? I would if I could! What should I do when she’s shaking and crying just by looking at anyone who isn’t you!]</p>
<p>Kaichen ran a hand through his hair in annoyance before opening his eyes wildly.</p>
<p>“I don’t care whether you cry and beg, or tremble and pray that you want us to be close. Don’t mix me up with her anymore, Julius. I haven’t had a proper conversation with Dalia for the past week because of you annoying people.”</p>
<p>He cut off communication without any regret.</p>
<p>Kaichen thought that he had done Julius enough favors for the week. He just worked for a week serving a woman who was afraid of people and avoided them. She didn’t have any other problems.</p>
<p>He didn’t hate that Ja Yanghwa would follow him around when he entered her room, like a trained puppy. He thought of the willow house and the pitiful ducks he raised by the lake.</p>
<p>He was like that until Dalia’s reaction.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>He sighed deeply and thought about Dalia. Perhaps she still thought that he hadn’t come out of Ja Yanghwa’s room. She might’ve been hanging around nearby.</p>
<p>She was pretty cute like that too, but he didn’t want to make her feel uncomfortable like this. More than anything, he couldn’t stand it himself any longer.</p>
<p>Kaichen appeared in front of Dalia with movement magic. Dalia, who had been gnawing at her lips restlessly, stepped back in surprise.</p>
<p>He held her hand tightly to prevent her from running away. When he laced his fingers, worried that she might shake him off, her pale face blushed as she averted her eyes.</p>
<p>“What, what is it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think what you’re doing will work anymore.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You’re avoiding me.”</p>
<p>“… I- I’m not avoiding you.”</p>
<p>Dalia looked away with a pout. She knew she was being obvious, but she couldn’t help it. She was jealous of the other woman, and she didn’t want to hide it.</p>
<p>Kaichen suppressed his laughter as he spoke. “You’re avoiding me.”</p>
<p>“I… said I wasn’t.”</p>
<p>“Do you think you’re good at lying?”</p>
<p>Dalia sighed and bit her lip. “Aish, it’s because Master only sees her!”</p>
<p>Kaichen couldn’t help but smile. Dalia’s jealousy was so cute, and it made him want to hug her right away.</p>
<p>“Be with me more! Why, why… I didn’t even get… Mealtimes… A m-man and a woman, alone in a room! Huh?! Oh?! Y-you can’t do that!”</p>
<p>Her face was so red that it was almost purple. She couldn’t even make eye contact with him, and she raised her free hand to cover her face.</p>
<p>“Ha… Fu-… You like someone small and cute, right? Master likes… cats… too, so that kind of person is prettier to you…?”</p>
