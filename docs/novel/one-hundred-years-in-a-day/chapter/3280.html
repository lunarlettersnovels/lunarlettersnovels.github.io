            <p><strong>Chapter 243</strong></p>
<p>“Hm. I’ve never thought about it.”</p>
<p>“Ha… You’re lying.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be something I like starting from today.” After he slightly pulled away from my body, he looked at me and smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>I was offended by his laid-back attitude, but it was a dazzling smile, so I laughed along. He licked the pit of the stomach and tickled my navel that dipped inwards. I muffled a groan. My body grew hotter and hotter as he licked every nook and cranny.</p>
<p>“Ngh… ah, ah!”</p>
<p>His lips, which had been licking and rubbing my belly button in a circular motion, gradually descended to my pelvis. He wrapped his hand around the inside of my thigh and draped my leg over his shoulder. My bare heat entered his field of vision.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, master… Ha, ngh!” He lifted my thighs and pressed them to his back as he buried his face into my lower body. With my back against the window, my body trembled at the touch of his moist tongue. My eyes flashed as his tongue rubbed against my hardened clit0ris.</p>
<p>I could feel myself getting wetter. Every time he flicked his tongue, I grew even more damp. Pleasure welled up, heading towards a climax. “Aah! Ha, n-no… Hng, stop….” I gripped him through his hair and pushed him away, but he wouldn’t budge. Instead, he sucked even more intensely than when he sucked on my bre@sts, making l3wd sounds.</p>
<p>His lips went straight to my gaping entrance. He rubbed the insides of my thighs lightly and pushed them upwards more, which strained my back, but I couldn’t think about any discomfort. I closed my eyes tightly as he licked and swallowed my dripping wetness as if he was swallowing sweet fruit juice.</p>
<p>He must be crazy. How could he do such an embarrassing thing without being really crazy? “Ha, ugh… Maste- ah! Stop, ha….” I pleaded with him in between moans. As he licked and sucked at my entrance, he suddenly stuck out his tongue into me. “Ahh!”</p>
<p>My thighs, which were heavily draped over him, trembled. When I climaxed just by that, I was so ashamed that I felt like I was going to die of ecstasy. Raising his head, Kaichen wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. His eyes crinkled when he smiled. “Of course, whatever you want… I’m willing to listen to anything.”</p>
<p>I was frustrated, but at the same time liked the way he smiled satisfyingly at me. I was a week for his sweet talk.. I didn’t know when he stripped, but he was already dripping with pr3cum. His pants were off halfway, and he put one of my legs on his shoulder as I sat on the windowsill. He rubbed himself against my entrance.</p>
<p>My heat, slippery with saliva and fluids, swelled up as if it would swallow him just by lightly rubbing his tip. At his trembling lower body, my eyes clouded over and my toes curled. “Tell me what you want next.” I bit my lip as he nudged at my entrance while stroking himself.</p>
<p>He wasn’t usually like this… why did he have a different personality during s3x? But I didn’t dislike this part of him… rather, it was exciting. Kaichen now was different from his usual stoic and calm appearance. As I gasped, he stuck his tongue out to lick the fresh saliva that flowed down my lips.</p>
<p>He looked down at me. I looked up back at him fiercely, and he smiled as I rolled my eyes. “I like doing what Master wants….” I realized with Kaichen, my fighting spirit could burn. Kaichen chuckled and pushed the tip of his thumb into my mouth.</p>
<p>His mushroom tip gently pushed through my loose entrance.</p>
<p>“Nggh…!”</p>
<p>“Ha, it’s hot….” The place where he’d been licking and caressing with his tongue was now filled with his thick length. I could feel my inner walls pulsing and clinging tightly to his pen!s, as if it knew that it would bring him extreme pleasure.</p>
<p>My lower abdomen felt warm. I could see Kaichen’s face darken. I liked it when his eyes slowly closed and opened as he let out a hot breath, and his eyes gradually glazed over with l!st. Kaichen let out a satisfied breath, parting his lips slightly as he reached the end of my tight heat. Seeing his red face, my insides naturally clenched.</p>
<p>“Oh… Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Master, that face, haa… ngh, is really… hck!” He was cheating. I swallowed my unfinished words. Kaichen frowned but moved his hips gently. “Relax.”</p>
<p>“Ha, Master… Too, ugh, too big.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t bear to say that just seeing Kaichen’s expression of pleasure made my lower body tighten with excitement. He looked so sexy. But it seemed that my words turned him on, and he grew bigger, which felt tighter inside me.</p>
<p>“Hnngh!”</p>
<p>I looked at him in shock. Kaichen’s eyebrows twitched, and he pulled out slowly before sharply thrusting in as an answer.</p>
<p>When we started, I was sitting on the windowsill, but now I was practically being lifted by Kaichen. The only thing leaning against the window was my waist. My back was aching, but I forgot all about it. I grabbed his shoulders each time his blunt, hot tip reached inside me.</p>
<p>“Ah, ack! Ha, ah!”</p>
<p>He thrusted mercilessly. He held the back of my head to keep me from hitting the window, lifted my thighs and wrapped them around his hips tightly.</p>
<p>“Haa!”</p>
<p>Feeling a sense of deja vu, I wrapped my arms around his neck as my eyes widened.</p>
