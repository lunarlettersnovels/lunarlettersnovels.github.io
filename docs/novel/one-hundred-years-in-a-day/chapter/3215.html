            <h3><strong>Chapter 309</strong></h3>
<p>I recalled Kaichen showing interest in my occasional remarks about my past life as I spoke. He seemed to quite like the term ‘healing.’</p>
<p>In this world, it refers to the magic used to recover one’s body, but back in my old world, they used it to describe taking it easy and relaxing. Resting to heal the mind. Since then, he would seriously say to me, “Dalia, let’s go for healing.” How amusing it was!</p>
<p>Kaichen continued to gaze at me intently with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I have to wash up and get ready now…” I said.</p>
<p>I glanced back. The chefs couldn’t bring themselves to touch the perfectly prepared dishes. They busily discussed among themselves with notebooks in hand, nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>I approached Kaichen, narrowed my eyes, and said, “Shall we wash up together?”</p>
<p>Kaichen lifted his hand and covered my face in response to my whispered question.</p>
<p>“Dalia, you…”</p>
<p>Kaichen didn’t finish his sentence as he pressed his face against mine. He lightly placed his arm around my waist, cast a familiar teleportation spell, and suddenly, we were in my private bathroom.</p>
<p>“What have I told you not to do in public?” Once we were alone, Kaichen’s stern voice reached my ears.</p>
<p>I smiled cheekily. “I forget about the trivial things,” I replied.</p>
<p>“It was you who brought that up.”</p>
<p>“Okay, so my mouth is the problem. If you want to scold me, go ahead.”</p>
<p>I pouted my lips towards him as if saying, “Go ahead, scold me!” Kaichen’s grip on my waist tightened. His body close to me was slightly heated, but he was still annoyed.</p>
<p>I wrapped my arms around his neck, thinking about how to make him feel better. Although it was childish, I didn’t feel embarrassed at all. In front of Kaichen, I didn’t mind doing anything.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he looked at me with affectionate eyes. So even when my lips were met with rejection, I didn’t mind at all.</p>
<p>“Master, why are you really in a bad mood?”</p>
<p>If he won’t do it, then I will. I kissed his cheek with a smooching sound. Still, the wrinkles on Kaichen’s forehead didn’t disappear.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What? Master?”</p>
<p>When I kissed his nose and chin, Kaichen sighed briefly, slightly bending his waist to make it easier for me. Despite his annoyance, his movements were irresistibly cute. He didn’t dislike the kisses.</p>
<p>Feeling more at ease, I kissed his forehead, and when I aimed for his lips, he closed his eyes with a soft sigh. A low murmur filled with desire escaped through Kaichen’s tightly sealed lips. He opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Looking at the golden eyes filled with desire, I blinked widely, pretending not to notice anything. Now, if he didn’t explain the reason for his irritation, I was determined not to do anything else. Finally, Kaichen let out a short sigh and spoke.</p>
<p>“I heard you’re cooking for the Emperor of Suran.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Leaning against the bathroom wall, Kaichen smoothly shifted our positions. He placed me between his legs. Although awkwardly trapped between his stretched thighs, his firm hands around my waist strangely felt cozy.</p>
<p>I enjoyed being held by Kaichen like this. I looked at Kaichen’s face, which was deeply furrowed in thought.</p>
<p>“Why do you have to cook for that person yourself?”</p>
<p>While I hesitated, Kaichen, who had been pondering for a short while, finally spoke openly about the reason, and I took a breath. I scanned Kaichen’s face.</p>
<p>“Master, are you irritated because I cooked for the Emperor of Suran?” I asked.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“So… it’s not that someone irritated you, but you were annoyed after hearing that story and came to check on me.”</p>
<p>“…Yes. It’s even more irritating seeing it in person,” he finally opened up.</p>
<p>“Did I work too hard?”</p>
<p>“Was there a need to pour in such sincerity?”</p>
<p>“Well… I thought…”</p>
<p>“Are you looking forward to dining with that guy?”</p>
<p>But Master, I put in more effort because you were looking at me. I couldn’t utter the words. First of all, why does he think he’s not joining us for dinner tonight?</p>
<p>Yanghwa and Jungyeonhae are our guests for tonight’s dinner. Kaichen and I will be the hosts. Even though we hadn’t officially declared marriage or our status as lovers, considering we live together in the same mansion, I didn’t want to welcome Jungyeonhae alone.</p>
<p>This man, who was glaring at me with jealousy while pressing his forehead, was agitated by the fact that I cooked for someone else.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh, he’s so cute like this.’</em></p>
<p>I felt like punching the air. Otherwise, I would bite him all over.</p>
<p>“Master, you should eat too…”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Because there’s a lot happening recently, we could only have light meals. Of course, the menu is elaborate since it’s for the Emperor of Suran, but still, I made it with you in mind.”</p>
<p>“…I’m part of the dinner party? What?”</p>
<p>With a slightly embarrassed expression, Kaichen pressed his lips together.</p>
<p>I felt his hand, firmly supporting my waist, stiffening. I ran my thumb over Kaichen’s smooth, slightly reddish skin, closed my eyes, and smiled.</p>
