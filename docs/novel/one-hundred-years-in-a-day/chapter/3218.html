            <h3><strong>Chapter 306</strong></h3>
<p><strong>《Information on the Sociopath, Exchetra》</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>A transmigrator who read the novel to the end.</em></li>
<li><em>There is a high possibility that she transmigrated from the very start of the plot.</em></li>
<li><em>She knows how to use time magic.</em></li>
<li><em>Head of the Momalhaut faction.</em></li>
<li><em>Exceptionally cunning.</em></li>
<li><em>Considers Kaichen as the biggest obstacle.</em></li>
<li><em>Personality is the worst. Probably antisocial? She might be clinically insane.</em></li>
<li><em>She aims to make everyone miserable if she can’t get the throne for herself. (However, it doesn’t seem like she’s desperate to become the emperor.)</em></li>
<li><em>Asta seems to be the only person to like her for who she is.</em></li>
<li><em>She might possess unmeasurable, formidable magical abilities besides Time Magic.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I looked down and tapped my pen on the paper. I gently brushed the elegant quill across the bridge of my nose as I contemplated whether I missed any important detail.</p>
<p><em>‘What’s the goal? The ultimate goal… What is she aiming for?’</em></p>
<p>Although I’ve been wracking my brain for days trying to figure out Exchetra’s plan, I haven’t discovered anything. Despite making a grand announcement that I’d become a monster, there wasn’t anything I could do now. It was a bit embarrassing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Held the citizens of Heulin hostage. (The drugs have probably spread. The extent: unknown.)</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all I’ve managed to find out. Knowing that there were hostages involved was something we already knew on our side.</p>
<p>Still, my shoulders were, and my heart pounded anxiously. Exchetra didn’t seem to put much effort into capturing citizens just to hold them hostage. My intuition was saying something else.</p>
<p>Tap, tap, tap.</p>
<p>The pen punctuated the same spot on the paper. Any moment, and it would pierce through, blending with the ink. While I was absentminded, the door to the study suddenly creaked open, and Yanghwa rushed inside.</p>
<p>“Dalia!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Startled by the sudden entrance, I quickly hid the paper inside the drawer, which proved useless since Yanghwa didn’t care about such things. She ran towards me and hugged me tightly.</p>
<p>Today, she wore a sleeveless tank top and wide-leg pants. A wide belt was tied around her waist. Her bob had cute side braids tied by a thin golden thread with a little bell tied at the end. She was fully dressed in the regalia of the Suran Empire.</p>
<p>The bell made a twinkling sound every time she moved. It reminded her too much of the collar around Maxim’s neck…</p>
<p><em>‘Hmm, no. Yanghwa isn’t a dog.’</em></p>
<p>I erased the rude thoughts from my mind and grabbed Yanghwa’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” I asked.</p>
<p>I spent the past few days researching time magic in the laboratory with Kaichen and pondering Exchetra’s plan in my spare time. Therefore, I could only briefly see Yanghwa a few days ago. I haven’t spent time with her even after a week has passed.</p>
<p>She wasn’t much different from Maxim, who followed me around. It didn’t help that various misfortunes prevented us from having a proper conversation since the fiasco at the garden party.</p>
<p>Julius acknowledged her as a princess, and with the official envoys from the Suran Empire visiting the youngest princess of her Suran Empire, Yanghwa now held a completely different power.</p>
<p>Except for Julius, none of the nobles knew about the real identity of the chief envoy. If he knew he was the great emperor of the mighty Suran Empire and Yanghwa’s big brother, it would cause alarm.</p>
<p>But because of that, there was no need to worry about being ignored like at the garden party. Moreover, Yanghwa didn’t have to mope around in bed, missing her family anymore.</p>
<p><em>‘It doesn’t seem like she’s fallen in love with Julius yet.’</em></p>
<p>Of course, Julius was already in love, and Yanghwa seemed to have some affection for him.</p>
<p>She is the heroine. And if the main character’s fate doesn’t change, she will someday reunite with Julius and become a couple. Yanghwa’s heart also perked up considerably as she comforted Julius, who had recently become weak.</p>
<p>Although I can’t believe everything that Exchetra says, there is no doubt that no one can stop the plot from proceeding as it should…</p>
<p>I’ve also felt similar feelings several times.</p>
<p>Even if the flow of events is different, everything will naturally gravitate towards Julius’s destiny. Exchetra knew that and probably manipulated things in a way that would benefit her.</p>
<p><em>‘That’s why Julius is immobile now.’</em></p>
<p>Another unfortunate example was Princess Dia Grande of the Duke of Manuwell.</p>
<p>They said she was missing, but considering Exchetra, who treated everyone as “pawns” to be used and discarded— she would never have left her alive. She was meticulous and a perfectionist who showed no flaws but had a cruel temperament that showed no mercy.</p>
<p>I patted Yanghwa’s shoulder while I was absent-mindedly thinking about something else. Yanghwa made a dissatisfied expression, puffing out her cheeks and shouting.</p>
<p>“Dalia!”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t hear me again!”</p>
<p>I smiled awkwardly and avoided eye contact. Yanghwa squinted her eyes and lightly poked my side.</p>
<p>“His Highness wants to see Dalia!”</p>
<p>“Oh, His Highness’s older brother wants to see me… What?” I blinked, not fully grasping what Yanghwa said.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Who was looking for me…?”</p>
<p>I asked with a foolish look. Yanghwa looked at me with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>Until a moment ago, I was deeply absorbed in thoughts about Yanghwa’s impressive older brother, who was also the Emperor of the Suran Empire, so I was even more shocked.</p>
