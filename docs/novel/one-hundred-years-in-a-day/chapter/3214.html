            <h3><strong>Chapter 310</strong></h3>
<p>“Of course, you’ll be there to greet the guests.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m already with Master. Do you think I should greet the guests alone or… with someone else?”</p>
<p>As I spoke my thoughts out loud, Kaichen stared at me in a daze for a moment before raising the hand supporting my waist. He grabbed my long black hair and pulled it hard.</p>
<p>“Uh!”</p>
<p>I let out a giggle that broke the mood. I pressed my lips together and braced myself for the feel of his warm tongue roughly sliding in. I felt myself float away for a moment, and then I switched places with Kaichen.</p>
<p>I almost laughed again at the way my back was now pressed against the bathroom wall, but I swallowed it down as he bit my lower lip in a slightly painful way.</p>
<p>It was adorable how he sometimes displayed his frustration like this when possessive thoughts haunt him.</p>
<p>Oh, this is too much. Am I lovesick?</p>
<p>I love him so much that it feels good every time. But strangely, my heart still grows a little bigger with each moment. What they say about love not having a scale or a size is true. Indeed, my love for him grows every day.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for a nobleman to host a dinner party in his mansion and invite guests. If they had a spouse at the time, they would greet their guests with their wife or husband or sometimes with their fiancé.</p>
<p>It was a tradition among the nobility. The person they introduced is someone they would spend the rest of their life with. If asking a wizard to forge a wand together was a marriage proposal, so was introducing a noble together at a dinner party.</p>
<p>So, Kaichen was so hot and bothered because I had implied something of a marriage proposal. Although a mage, he was more familiar with the manners and traditions of the nobility than I was.</p>
<p>He understood what I meant immediately. However, he was a little dazed and confused at first.</p>
<p>“Hah… hah… wait… wait!”</p>
<p>I felt warmth creeping towards the top of my head.</p>
<p>Kacihen embraced me so tightly that I could barely breathe. His arms wrapped around me as if he was refusing a single gap between our heated bodies.</p>
<p>I buried my face in his chest. It was nice to feel her firm torso and his strong arms wrapped around me, but seriously, his grip was so strong that I wondered if I was going to suffocate to death.</p>
<p>“You turn me on way too much every time,” he whispered.</p>
<p>I blinked. My heart beat loudly against my chest. “Please tell me you’re being honest,” I said, my throat hoarse.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m being too honest.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you don’t resist?”</p>
<p>“I don’t, and that’s why I’m more angry, because your honesty makes me act like a madman.”</p>
<p>His voice was low, and when I lifted my head to check his face, his grip tightened, making it impossible to move. I could feel his warmth seep in through my skin.</p>
<p>“…I can’t believe you’re always ahead of the curve, and I’m pathetic for being jealous over something so small,” Kaicchen said.</p>
<p>I stopped squirming. I let out an even breath and listened to him quietly. I could feel his heart pounding unsteadily against my chest. I love him being a madman and being jealous and possessive.</p>
<p>But what did he mean with his words? Kaichen often looked at me and said he couldn’t understand me, but did he realize he just said the most incomprehensible thing?</p>
<p>“There’s no one else but you.”</p>
<p>I tried to devise some reassuring words, but as if he could see through my thoughts, Kaichen locked his lips with mine before I could get the words out.</p>
<p>This time, he pinned me down with his arms and leaned in deeply. It was a careful, tender kiss that sent chills down my spine.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Kaichen was stunned as he heard Dalia casually propose to him. He realized that all the time he had spent suppressing his anger while watching her sweat and cook for another man was for naught.</p>
<p>“Of course, you’ll be there to greet the guests.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a polite request, nor did she whisper it. It was a bold declaration. He panicked because it was too obvious and blamed himself for not thinking of it first.</p>
<p>The only person in the world who could make him flustered was Dalia, but even if he was smart, he got caught every time in her net. It was unfair how her words that came out of nowhere reduced him to a trembling mess.</p>
<p>Her easy-going demeanor and the way her affection penetrated his heart left him breathless and overwhelmed. He wondered if she’d ever felt this way with another man besides him.</p>
<p>What kind of man had she met before, and did she marry him?</p>
<p>He wanted to ask so many things, but he couldn’t let those ugly thoughts slide. Thus, his lips remained shut.</p>
<p>He gently bit down on her full lower lip. He skimmed her tongue over her teeth, and their tongues curled against each other in a dance.</p>
<p>Dalia loved to kiss. She squeezed him with her sweet breath every time, even on the bed. She was so casual with it that even a rough kiss would make him laugh. It made him impatient.</p>
