            <p><strong>Chapter 196</strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t the only chance of a lifetime. Although we became lovers after that confession, I still felt it was just unfair that we just shared our first kiss. If I missed this moment, there wouldn’t be a next time soon..  If there was, it would be in the distant future. Kaichen was generous when it came to hugging but for some reason, he wasn’t with kissing.</p>
<p>Now that he seemed to go by instinct instead of reason, I took the opportunity to seduce him. But I didn’t have to come clean about that.</p>
<p>“What on earth… What…”</p>
<p>Kaichen muttered incomprehensibly. He looked suspicious of me, as if I couldn’t be trusted. I blinked at him and smiled. He narrowed his eyes when I stuck my tongue out and licked my lips.</p>
<p>“Master, you’re not giving up after we’ve come this far… right?”</p>
<p>It was an obvious provocation.</p>
<p>“Your body still hasn’t recovered-”</p>
<p>Kaichen began. I quickly interrupted him.</p>
<p>“I’m healthy!”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you feel like throwing up just now?”</p>
<p>“Master, when did I say something like that?”</p>
<p>“…Hah, you’re shameless.”</p>
<p>“That’s my only strong point.”</p>
<p>Even after saying that, he was still hesitant. His shaking eyes reflected his conflicted heart. Still, it was a little funny that his hands were still caressing my waist, contradicting what he said. I hugged him fast, thinking that my hot body would cool down if he dragged on like this.</p>
<p>“Master, no matter how brazen I am, isn’t it a little too much to beg for a hug? We’re lovers…” I told him honestly. Kaichen’s eyes widened. “Am I the only one who wants it?” I urged on.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Am I the only one who wants to sleep with you?” I said again when he answered in silence. A bout of nervousness crept inside of me.</p>
<p>“What…”</p>
<p>I felt frustrated. “Am I the only one who wants to have se-”</p>
<p>He hurriedly covered my lips. Normally, it would be his large hands covering my mouth and even my nose, but it seems in haste, all rational thought flew from him and he covered my lips with his instead. A low groan came from him. Maybe the reins on his self-control were finally snapping.</p>
<p>His hands that were caressing my waist brazenly lifted the hem of my clothes without hesitation. I flinched at his hot touch on my bare skin. He kissed me, more desperate than before. My head was woozy. My body, warm, as pulses of electricity spread through my whole system.</p>
<p>“Ah… Mmm.”</p>
<p>As if he was drinking sweet juice, the sal!va that flowed into his mouth went down his throat with a gulp. This… primal kiss, which was so different from his usual stoic behaviour, induced a hot excitement in me and made my toes curl in reflex. It turns out that a man could become a different person all together in bed.</p>
<p>As I grinded my body against his, a low m*an escaped him as he sucked on my tongue. His hands that were caressing my waist and stomach softly, cupped my chest roughly. His fingers found their prize underneath my br@  and twisted my sensitive nub.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>He broke the kiss and looked at me. My vision was blurry from the thrilling pleasure.  I was surprised that despite losing weight because of no appetite, my peaks were still sensitive and brought me pleasure.</p>
<p>“Wha-what!”</p>
<p>My eyes widened, my face was warm, and I let out a m*an so l*wd I couldn’t believe it came out of my own mouth. The corners of Kaichen’s lips turned upwards, different from how he was seducing me.</p>
<p>He was driving me mad. It was a smirk that was overflowing with provocativeness. His eyes – and even how he stuck out his tongue to lick his lips – everything was insanely sexy. I could feel that his body was hotter than usual, as if he was burning.</p>
<p>“W-wait… Master, hold… hold on…”</p>
<p>I was aghast at how sensitive my body was feeling with his every touch. In my previous life, I had often been asked by my partners whether I felt any s*xual desire. I did, but it wasn’t that <em>much…</em></p>
<p>I forgot one core fact.  Compared to my own body, Dalia’s body probably didn’t have many experiences with love making. Perhaps, she hasn’t even had her first time yet. This made my eyes widen in panic.</p>
<p>Seeing my flustered state, Kaichen bit my earlobe. “You’re not telling me to stop now, right?” he murmured slowly, his eyes dark.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>His fingers teased my nub again, and my whole body tingled. I couldn’t understand how pleasure felt so good that it made me dizzy. At one point, my underwear was gone, and I could feel the air touch my warm core that was so wet. Leaving me no chance to comprehend the situation, his warm palm touched my bare skin and caressed my mound and stiff peaks.</p>
<p>“No, ah… So-I didn’t mean that, ah!”</p>
<p>“Dalia, I asked you to stop <em>before</em>.”</p>
<p>“Hnng… Master, please slow down…”</p>
<p>He bit my earlobe again and licked my neck. I hadn’t noticed that his shirt had come undone, revealing his chest. Everything was hazy as his touch was too distracting and my body too sensitive.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s hands roamed from my round shoulders to the curve of my stomach and to my heaving mounds again. With one hand, he pinched and twisted my n!pples, while the other went down my lower body and undressed me. Suddenly, his lips moved towards the peak that he’d been harassing with his left hand.</p>
