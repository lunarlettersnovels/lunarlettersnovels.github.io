            <p><strong>Chapter 132</strong></p>
<p>I raised my head and smelled it again. It was my favorite scent. The cool, wood scent that I so liked. The one I made in Acrab constantly. The fragrance came from the pillows here.</p>
<p>I turned and looked around the room. The structure of the bedroom, which I had not noticed before, certainly felt familiar. It looked like my room I had tried hard to decorate in the Willow House. It was no wonder Kaichen had seemed so at home here</p>
<p>“No way…” I foolishly smiled, shook my head and snuggled into the blanket. My heart was pounding. <em>It’s not really what I think it is. There was no way. </em>Did Kaichen decorate this room for me? That was just unbelievable, not to mention impossible. But the bedding smelled of the fragrance I so loved. I recalled the many times I had grumbled to him that I wanted to go back to Willow House…</p>
<p><em>“You always put me in such trouble.”</em></p>
<p>Kaichen was right. I did put him in so much trouble constantly. I had insisted on making a magic wand together. Was that what troubled him? Then why didn’t he just say so?</p>
<p>I thought about it. He could have refused. But he didn’t. <em>Does he like me too? </em>That was crazy! There were so many questions and no straight answers. My heart fluttered like a middle-school girl with a crush. I bit my lips and closed my eyes. Just entertaining the notion that this might not be one-sided made me tremble.</p>
<p><em>No, no. It’s Kaichen. Just… since I’m his disciple, maybe it’s because he thinks of me as his favorite disciple. </em>Like a coward, I kept thinking about anything but that. It was a defense mechanism. Because if I was only assuming things and he did not like me back, I did not want to get hurt.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The next day, I went out to see the most spectacular city in the Empire. Angel and Mimi, who were supposed to go with me, refused outright. They said they wanted to learn from Baristan on how to serve their master better. Angel’s eyes twinkled with admiration as he followed Baristan. He said he wanted to learn everything so he could be a good servant and make his siblings proud. I was so proud of him that I told him I was going to give him a gift when we returned to Acrab.</p>
<p>Angel was ecstatic. But when he noticed that Baristan, standing next to us, cleared his throat, he said, “I am fine, Countess.”</p>
<p>He was so innocent and adorable. Mimi worked even harder from the maids here. She was a quick learner and was very meticulous with her work.</p>
<p><em>Mickey also seems to be doing well in Acrab. </em>I used to find it very distressing to be near the two of them. But I have gotten used to it now. Mimi’s loyalty definitely helped with my trauma.</p>
<p>When both refused to go sightseeing with me, Kaichen and I were the only ones standing at the front door and looking at each other awkwardly. I felt flustered. I hadn’t slept well thinking about what had happened. I wanted to get some fresh air and organize my thoughts. <em>Why did I have to face him alone right now?</em></p>
<p>I let out a groan and glanced at him. He didn’t even look at me. Perhaps he felt awkward because of yesterday’s incident too. <em>I shouldn’t have come out so early. </em>Maybe he hated seeing me right now. He looked reluctant.</p>
<p>“Teacher, if you don’t want to go, I can go by myself,” I offered.</p>
<p>“You don’t even know the way,” he said bluntly.</p>
<p>“I am good with directions. I have a map.”</p>
<p>“No, you are not.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “Even if I lose my way, I can ask people around me.”</p>
<p>Kaichen sighed. “I told you not to follow people you don’t know.”</p>
<p>I had heard him say that many times. His voice sounded so cold that it was scary to look at him. I just lowered my head.</p>
<p>Why was this so complicated? I didn’t want to leave this hanging. It was uncomfortable enough. If I leave like this, I will be even more confused than before. I had decided to go out for fresh air, but this hinted at another unpleasant experience.</p>
<p>“Teacher, are you still mad at me?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You are trying not to look at me.”</p>
<p>He didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“Teacher?” Kaichen did not turn his head to look at me. He didn’t look at me at all. I moved closer to him. I was stubborn, too. In the end Kaichen gave in and glared at me.</p>
