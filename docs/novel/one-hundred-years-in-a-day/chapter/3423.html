<p><strong>Chapter 100</strong></p>
<p>Fearing that her daughter and her status would diminish, Akshetra’s mother had stolen the new-born baby in the beginning of the novel. She couldn’t bring herself to kill Julius so she had dumped him in the slums.</p>
<p>The Empress had been so bereaved that she had died as a consequence. The emperor was saddened and became lax in the affairs of the empire. Akshetra had taken the reins of the empire at a very young age. When Julius returned one day, the emperor had stripped her of the title and made him the Crown prince. She must have felt betrayed after doing so much for the kingdom.</p>
<p>Akshetra hadn’t taken things in stride and never shown any contrary reaction. I had assumed she was just a supporting character who had been thrown in the story to support Julius’ narrative. She hadn’t reappeared until the Guarten commotion when I had read the novel.</p>
<p><em>Fool! </em>I felt like such a fool. The person who had any reason to hate Julius was Akshetra. She had lost everything. She had lost the title she had been given as her birthright. She had worked for the empire and yet, had been betrayed of her title. Why had I ever assumed Akshetra had just been scared and let go of the whole thing?</p>
<p>The interpretation was up to the reader but in this case, I had just ignored Akshetra as unimportant. I hadn’t even given a thought about her. I might have heard Julius talk about his sister at some point but I must have been caught up in my own affairs that I hadn’t listened.</p>
<p>I sighed. At least I know now. This will give me time to come up with a way to help Julius. Because he has to take over the throne for me to live comfortably in this world. Otherwise, there won’t be any peace.</p>
<p>If Julius didn’t become the emperor, the Kaichen would have to be on his beck and call. He will never be free of the responsibilities. I wanted to be with him. I didn’t want to be alone anymore. For us to be happy together, we needed to help Julius fulfil his ending in this story.</p>
<p><em>Wish we could just ignore everything and live a secluded, peaceful life in the Willow House! </em>But I knew Kaichen by now. He would not turn a blind eye when Julius needs him. Maybe Kaichen went to negotiate with Akshetra. Maybe he knows about her. Julius didn’t have so much power yet. Akshetra knew more about the empire. She had run it in his absence. She knew things he didn’t.</p>
<p>Julius might have won some support from a number of people but Akshetra had taken care of the empire since a very young age. The nobles trusted her and saw her as the most capable one. She could make the nobles turn their back on Julius and the empire. I hadn’t known her in the novel but I had certainly seen her name appear often in newspapers and books while I was trapped in time magic.</p>
<p>She had taught herself matters of the state at the age of six on behalf of the incompetent emperor. The benevolent Crown princess had single handedly taken care of the affairs of the entire empire. Her title of ‘crown princess’ might have been taken away but the things she had done to keep the empire afloat had been admirable and respectable. Her charisma and capability were undeniable. A woman who had had to mature beyond her age with a brilliant mind was the enemy of the protagonist.</p>
<p>The throne was the core of the novel. I felt stuffy thinking about all this. I heard the door squeak open. I could smell the scent of a rose. It didn’t take long for me to understand the familiar yet so unfamiliar scent was Kaichen. I wanted to greet him but it would be too awkward so I pretended to be asleep.</p>
<p>I felt a hand on my forehead checking my temperature. A sigh from him. I felt his hands stroking my hair and tucking back the stray strands of hair behind me ears. I was in disbelief. I wanted to open my eyes just to make sure this was really the Kaichen I knew. His touch was warm on my skin.</p>
<p>“Dalia…,” said Kaichen in a low voice. His voice sounded cold in contrast to the warm hands stroking my cheeks. His voice was full of strange worries. I felt my heart pound. I suddenly couldn’t breathe. I should have opened my eyes and greeted him! I felt a hand on my chest.</p>
<p>“Dalia,” he said again. I wanted to see him. Just as I opened my eyes, I felt his mana course through his hand and into my heart. The warm golden mana spread from the place he touched to every nook and cranny of my body. It lulled me and I felt myself relax. My pounding heart calmed, and my thoughts were peaceful. They must have fed me an antidote before but he must have detoxified the remaining poison in my body like this.</p>
