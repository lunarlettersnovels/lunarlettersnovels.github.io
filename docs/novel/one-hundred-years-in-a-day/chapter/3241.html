            <h3><strong>Chapter 282</strong></h3>
<p>Trapped in such cruel circumstances, I had no choice but to beg and plead again and again.</p>
<p>I confessed that I had never experienced a moment of peace. I was lying when I said I was fine. I hadn’t forgotten a thing. I didn’t deserve happiness. So, please, just spare this person. Oh, please.</p>
<p>It was a prayer that slipped from my lips.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Exchetra looked down at the trembling body without much concern, the corners of her mouth rising to a smirk.</p>
<p>It had been worth the long hours and dedication she had put into making Dalia Alshine addicted to Ohapdok poison. Although she had originally intended to use the drug and then discard Dalia as a mere test subject, the fact that she was still alive had led to quite a successful result.</p>
<p>She didn’t like the stiff chair, but she sat down, crossing her legs, and watched Dalia struggling in the steel cage, writhing in pain, which she found quite satisfying.</p>
<p>“Even if there’s not much poison left, it’s not easy to eliminate it. It seems to go well with the newly created opium. She’s going to have a proper fit.”</p>
<p>“Do you know what you’re doing?”</p>
<p>“I certainly do. I didn’t expect Dalia Alshine to escape from the Ohapdok poison. They even made an antidote.”</p>
<p>Exchetra laughed briefly, even in an unfavorable situation.</p>
<p>“The Ohapdok I first used on Dalia Alshine had a new effect: it caused a complete loss of reason when a person gets addicted to all five poisons. But initially, it was quite inconvenient having to thoroughly torture her to break her mind.”</p>
<p>“That’s why you don’t use it anymore.”</p>
<p>“Because the gains are not worth the time.”</p>
<p>So she had thought about drugs.</p>
<p>She had experimented with using Ohapdok poison on Dalia Alshine, treating it as a test to see if she could make her addicted to alcohol, but it took too long to fully addict her.</p>
<p>She had known that the event would eventually happen, and she had considered her a good target to test the drug. She had never dreamt that the subject would become a transmigrated individual like her.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she had invested considerable time and effort in Dalia.</p>
<p>She thought it would be easier to manipulate her by creating the opium itself with magic rather than with the opium ingredients.</p>
<p>So, she created an opium that made the user addicted to self-harm.</p>
<p>It was another achievement she had made after the time magic in Acrab.</p>
<p>“Why did you kidnap Countess Alshine this time?”</p>
<p>Exchetra looked at Asta, who had been unusually talkative today, and slowly reached out. She gently brushed Asta’s downturned cheek with her palm and put her lips near his ears as if what she was about to say was a secret.</p>
<p>“It’s interesting, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Of course, she hadn’t brought Dalia Alshine in solely for her amusement, but to Exchetra, she was just a large chess piece necessary for her grand plan. A friend as dull as everyday life and a very small amusement.</p>
<p>“Watching her squirm is interesting.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Since I gave her opium, she’s probably stuck in a bad dream. Sadly, I can’t offer her a happier one.”</p>
<p>Exchetra talked to Dalia through the steel bars, even though Dalia couldn’t hear her. She was disappointed that she couldn’t torment her as much as before.</p>
<p>Dalia was hunched over, crying, trembling, biting her lips until they bled, and moaning like she might stop breathing any second. She was in a lot of pain.</p>
<p>For Exchetra, it was a kind of fun.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it funny? Sometimes, you just have to accept things instead of looking for hidden meanings.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“It’s because you’re so foolish…”</p>
<p>Exchetra kept to herself the fact that they were both from another world. At the same time, she touched Asta’s neck as he bowed before her with an unreadable expression.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking these questions?” She looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t seeing her in that state make you feel sorry for her?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Did you get attached to her during your time in the carriage with her?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then please explain why you’re acting differently in front of me.”</p>
<p>Even though her hands felt warm on his neck and cheek, her words were kind, but her eyes were as cold as ice. Asta didn’t flinch, and he spoke.</p>
<p>“Because I thought you were enjoying the game too much.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really…?”</p>
<p>“I’m concerned that the princess’s view on the future may change due to too much amusement.”</p>
<p>Exchetra chuckled at Asta’s honest words. In response, Asta bowed even deeper, and Exchetra didn’t resist as he moved closer.</p>
<p>A man more beautiful and graceful than most women.</p>
<p>She licked her lips. Exchetra wrapped her arm around Asta’s neck, leaving behind Dalia writhing in pain as if she might not last much longer, and turned her gaze to the man before her.</p>
<p>“This is a spectacle.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I never get tired of this game.”</p>
<p>She offered her lips willingly, and Asta’s gaze, captivating like a wild beast, turned predatory.</p>
<p>She felt a thrilling shiver as desire passed through their parted lips. Exchetra inhaled deeply. She didn’t stop Asta as he gently wiped away the silver strands that hung sweetly between her lips.</p>
<p>She believed quite some time had passed. She stood up and looked at Dalia, who was on the floor, barely breathing and looking like she couldn’t hang on much longer.</p>
<p>“Awaken. Since we’re enjoying this game… I want to see a face filled with even more despair.”</p>
<p>The game was just getting started.</p>
