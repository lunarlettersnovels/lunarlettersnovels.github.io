            <h3><strong>Chapter 286</strong></h3>
<p>“[… What?]</p>
<p>“I only managed to break through after three days. I needed the other Tenebre’s assistance because my mana was lacking.”</p>
<p>[… What kind of absurd statement is that? You got help because you lacked magic?]</p>
<p>“I’m looking for the medium. The magic this time… feels very strange.”</p>
<p>[What… No, Turbeau, wait! Just wait! What on earth is that all about!]</p>
<p>Kaichen struggled to maintain the magical connection through the communication stone, and he abruptly ended the call with Julius.</p>
<p>His mind raced with anxiety and impatience while his body felt incredibly weighed down.</p>
<p>His magic had been drained to the point he almost collapsed, and all he wanted was to close his eyes immediately. But if he were to give in now, he would need at least a week, if not longer, to recover his magical energy.</p>
<p>He briefly felt Michelle’s gaze on him, but he chose to ignore it. His body was desperately in need of rest. The moment he relaxed, it felt like he might lose consciousness.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, he wiped the damp strands of hair from his forehead. He had never felt so exhausted and powerless in his entire life.</p>
<p>Kaichen took slow, measured steps as he passed through the gates of Turbeau.</p>
<p>The town’s population was small, but it was always bustling with activity. Trudeau was known for its shepherds, people gathering at the riding arena, and those taming wild horses.</p>
<p>However, the place he entered after passing through the gates was entirely different from the familiar scene he had known.</p>
<p>Kaichen had been to Turbeau with Julius several times. Julius had brought him here to introduce him to the town’s people, even his friends who had been comrades during his days as a beggar.</p>
<p>Livestock were raised everywhere in Turbeau, which had deterred Kaichen from visiting often due to the unpleasant smell of animal waste and dirty streets. But whenever Julius came to Turbeau, he transformed from a prince into the “human” Julius.</p>
<p>For Julius, this place was not just a town; it was his hometown, his home, and the people he introduced were like family to him.</p>
<p>Julius lost his mother the moment he was born, and he had to navigate his early years under the threat of his half-sister. While his father celebrated his birth, he kept searching for a trace of the beloved queen in the grown Julius.</p>
<p>The royal palace was magnificent and grand, but it was a lonely place, an endlessly cold place to Julius. This was why his attachment to Turbeau was strong.</p>
<p>No matter what their enemies’ ill intentions are, the mere existence of time magic being cast in Turbeau was enough to shake Julius.</p>
<p>Kaichen steadfastly ignored the communication attempts from Julius through the ring.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“Is this… a city? People live here, right?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that time magic differs from place to place, but even so… ”</p>
<p>The other Teneberes talked with low and disturbed voices behind him. Kaichen slowly closed his eyes. His breathing quickened, and his head throbbed. He had an overwhelming desire to close his eyes and sleep immediately.</p>
<p>His mind and body were trying to escape from reality, so he opened his eyes again.</p>
<p>Turbeau had lost its former vitality. Not a single person could be seen on the once-bustling streets. The old buildings looked as though they might crumble with a mere gust of wind, and the ground was overgrown with wild grass, not much different from the other side of the city wall.</p>
<p>It felt as though a considerable amount of time had passed. Turbeau had transformed into a ruin.</p>
<p>“Did time pass quickly…?”</p>
<p>Hearing Olganos’ question, Kaichen clenched his fists and quickened his pace. <em>‘If time had sped up, then the medium…’</em> He remembered how Dalia endured a hundred years with her sanity intact.</p>
<p>Destroying the Time Magic in Turbeau was challenging because so much time had passed in this space.</p>
<p>“Find the medium,” his voice commanded with a slight shake to it.</p>
<p>Although startled, the four individuals focused their magic on searching for the medium. Saveli, with the most magical power, activated the magic circle, but there were no other living beings in sight.</p>
<p>“No medium?”</p>
<p>“Does it make sense that there’s no one here?”</p>
<p>“If there’s no medium, how did they maintain the time magic?”</p>
<p>Kaichen had an ominous feeling. He led his heavy body towards the center of Turbeau.</p>
<p>Not far from the city’s center, Renia, the younger sister of Julius, lived with their mother, Lydan.</p>
<p>The neat single-family house had been purchased with the money Julius had earned after entering the mage tower, and the well-maintained garden was always adorned with beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>The small front door cracked open as they approached, revealing the cat, who hadn’t said goodbye to him. It offered a gentle meow towards him.</p>
<p>Renia often spoke of her dreams of running a flower shop when she grew up. She planned to use the money she earned to take care of the sick cat. She always smiled and expressed her eagerness to grow up quickly.</p>
<p>After Julius became a prince, had visited her less frequently, and there had been a few occasions when she cried and expressed her disappointment.</p>
<p>And so, she longed to grow up even faster.</p>
