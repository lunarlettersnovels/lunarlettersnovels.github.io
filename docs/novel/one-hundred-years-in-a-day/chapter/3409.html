            <p><strong>Chapter 114</strong></p>
<p>“No, because forbidden magic only affects the medium.”</p>
<p>Lars made a surprised face, then suddenly said with a distorted face,</p>
<p>“Then, as rumored, the Countess…… Did you become a medium? They say that if you become a Medium, you’ll end up as a total wreck…” It has not been announced properly so I didn’t know there was already a rumor going around. Kaichen and Julius said that everything became known unexpectedly, but they did not say that it had spread throughout the empire.</p>
<p>“Teacher helped. I was away for a while, right? That’s when I got some treatment.” I spat it out as if it was a trivial matter, but Las’ expression was still distorted.</p>
<p>“We… really without knowing anything…”</p>
<p>“No! No, of course, you didn’t know. Because I didn’t tell you.” His tears were about to start pouring out, so I groaned and stood up. I heard the information I needed, so there was no need to stay longer.</p>
<p>“Miss… No, Countess…”</p>
<p>“Then Las, I’ll come again!” I squinted and looked at Lrs, but it seemed like he was going to hold onto me, so I waved and hurried out of the restaurant.</p>
<p>“Ah…” But when I left the restaurant, I was taken aback to see the locals of Acrab buzzing around me. No wonder I could feel so many eyes on me when I came to the store. They must have gathered one by one to see me.</p>
<p><em>‘This is not good.’ </em>There is no one that I’m unfamiliar with. I remember the names, faces, family relations, and everything else of over three thousand Acrab residents. Even what I did to them. It can never be pleasant to be surrounded and looked at by them like this.</p>
<p>“Hu… Huu…” When I took a deep breath as much as possible and said <em>‘It’s okay’</em> in my mind many times, Jenny, who I was familiar with, approached me, wrangling her hands.</p>
<p>“Countess… You know, dad is healthy now.” When I looked up, I could see Jamie standing awkwardly holding Jenny’s younger brother. I gently patted Jenny’s head and smiled.</p>
<p>“Good for you Jenny, you don’t have to worry about your dad anymore.”</p>
<p>“Dad said it was all thanks to the Countess,” Said Jenny and took a flower out of her arms. The flower that was crushed in the child’s arms was a small dandelion flower. Seeing the pretty yellow flower, I carefully accepted it and sent Jenny back.</p>
<p>Holding the flower that the child had given me in my hands, I glanced at the people gathered around me. My eyes throbbed as if they were telling me not to forget. My heartbeat uneasily and my breath became rapid.</p>
<p>The friendly gaze towards me was burdensome. I had become better but it was still too much for me. Besides, just a few days ago, I had to witness a terrible memory vividly. I came out thinking that it would be okay, but when I was surrounded like this, my body showed signs of anxiety. <em>‘Ah, this is really annoying.’</em> Isn’t this what it’s like to not be able to do as you want? When I wondered if I was going to repeat the same thing as before, golden magic flashed in front of me.</p>
<p>“Why are you out already?” It was such a sweet remark that I doubted if it really was the voice I knew. Kaichen appeared in front of me in an instant and reached out to me staring at my face. He ruffled my hair lightly and said slowly,</p>
<p>“What a stupid expression.” It’s because I was so surprised. I held the dandelion flower that Jenny gave me in one hand and looked up at him quietly. Kaichen looked at me without saying a word, then patted the top of my head and turned his back. At that time, the gazes of the people surrounding me were blocked. It was thanks to Kaichen’s large body.</p>
<p><em>‘What is this exactly?’ </em>I was surprised at how Kaichen, who disappeared and suddenly appeared, knew I was here, but I was even more surprised at how he didn’t mind receiving attention on my behalf even though he didn’t like to appear in front of people.</p>
<p>“I believe I told you not to act like this.” At Kaichen’s brief words, the gathered crowd flinched and tensed up.</p>
<p>“B-but… We wanted to say thank you,” said someone. I stared at Kaichen’s wide back and thought hard about what the hell happened.</p>
<p>“I told you to say thank you through a letter.”</p>
<p>“But…!”</p>
<p>“I also said that there are no buts.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Do you guys want to make the lord who has barely recovered fall ill again?” The surrounding air cooled down. The people gathered seemed to have a lot to say, but one by one, they reluctantly left. Over Kaichen’s shoulder, I could see Jenny waving her hand lightly. Exactly what did Kaichen tell to the people of Acrab? Raising my head, I couldn’t contain my curiosity and looking at Kaichen’s back I asked,</p>
<p>“Teacher, what did you say to people?”</p>
<p>“Not much… I told them to not bother you.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The lord needs stability, so I told them not to say thank you or apologize or anything.” As I blinked my eyes and tilted my head, Kaichen suddenly looked at me again and put his hand on my head.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details, but you… you find people here uncomfortable.” Then he turned his head. When I didn’t respond to him saying that he did it for me, Kaichen twitched his eyebrows and asked, “Should we go?”</p>
