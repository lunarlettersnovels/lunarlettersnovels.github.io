            <h3><strong>Chapter 344</strong></h3>
<p>Exchetra’s demeanor was far from normal. There was no hint of fear, even in a space devoid of magic, where everything was lost.</p>
<p>It was inevitable. She had won.</p>
<p>Kaichen couldn’t muster any expression amidst the vibrations echoing in his ears. Julius was calling out for him nearby, but he couldn’t easily regain his composure.</p>
<p>The price paid for being toyed by a crazy person was too high.</p>
<p>He was the loser. Though they had both lost everything, she was the one who had achieved her goal.</p>
<p>Slowly, he opened his hands.</p>
<p>They were still empty.</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>The eclipse was slowly radiating light as if it was all over.</p>
<p>The darkness that had covered it dissipated, letting the sun shine through, but the magic circles carved into the sky remained.</p>
<p>The eclipse was over, but he still felt blinded by the magic circle eclipse.</p>
<p>He was unable to use magic.</p>
<p>“Kaichen! Snap out of it, da!mn it!”</p>
<p>​​”Da… Dalia….”</p>
<p>No words came out.</p>
<p>Dalia was trapped in time magic.</p>
<p>How did time magic work? How was it reduced just a moment ago? To understand, he had to mobilize magic. But he still couldn’t use it.</p>
<p>Why did Dalia disappear? Where did she go?</p>
<p>He couldn’t feel Dalia’s presence nor the magic from the bracelet he gave her.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Once out of Heulin, he could use magic But instinctively, he knew. That crazy woman wouldn’t have used such an easy way.</p>
<p><em>‘Dalia is here. Trapped here, right in front of me.’</em></p>
<p>In this space, he couldn’t use magic. Although she was within reach, he couldn’t touch or go near her.</p>
<p>He wanted to save her; he knew how, but he couldn’t.</p>
<p>Kaichen could only show the despair Exchetra had so desperately hoped for.</p>
<p>“Don’t kill her. You can’t kill her. Only after I save Dalia… only then…”</p>
<p>Ignoring my murmurs, Julius approached Exchetra, his lips trembling.</p>
<p>This incident wiped out the main force of Momalhaut, and their leader was captured. She was also sealed with the magic circle she unleashed. Moreover, many nobles died.</p>
<p>She would no longer be protected as a princess.</p>
<p>There was nothing more she could do.</p>
<p>Yet she was smiling. It wasn’t that she couldn’t do anything, but that she no longer wanted to do anything.</p>
<p>It was an attitude of contentment, having already done everything.</p>
<p>Anger surged at her arrogant attitude, but Kaichen swallowed hard.</p>
<p>There’s a way.</p>
<p>There must be a way.</p>
<p>“I’ll wait.”</p>
<p>Dalia smiled softly and said so. As if believing that he would come to save her again.</p>
<p>So, he couldn’t collapse like this. It was hard to breathe as if his lungs were abandoning their functions, but he had to endure it.</p>
<p>Because it was all he had.</p>
<p>“I will come to rescue you like that day.”</p>
<p>That’s what he said.</p>
<p>This was the twist.</p>
<p>Although she had been targeting Kaichen without hesitation, Exchetra final goal was me.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed like she was targeting Julius, then Kaichen, summoning the blue dragon, but ultimately, it was me.</p>
<p>Not the bishop, not the knight, not even the queen.</p>
<p>I was the “king” chosen by the crazy woman.</p>
<p>It was absurd, but considering the insane words of that woman, it was strangely understandable. She wanted to hear the despair and screams.</p>
<p>She was not in her right mind. She had so many problems in her brain that even calling her crazy was an understatement. She was so despicable that no matter how many disgusting insults I knew, it would be insufficient.</p>
<p>How could such a person be a transmigrator?</p>
<p>God is too much. Or was it the blue dragon’s doing?</p>
<p>I sighed. I looked around as I took hesitant steps.</p>
<p>The scenery was familiar, but no one was present. It was clear that I was trapped in time magic, but this was something new.</p>
<p>Did it pull all of Heulin into the time magic, not just my body?</p>
<p>A pebble snagged my toe.</p>
<p>I thought about picking it up but remembered Exchetra’s actions at the top of the altar and stopped.</p>
<p>I can’t even kick a pebble now. I didn’t want to imitate the actions of the crazy woman at all.</p>
<p>“Hmm… It’s definitely time magic, but…”</p>
<p>Something was different.</p>
<p>If time magic had been activated in Heulin, the whole area would have been affected. Even the countless people visible until a moment ago should have been swept up in the aftermath of this magic.</p>
<p>If this really was inside time magic, then I was undoubtedly the medium for this time magic.</p>
<p>The place was Heulin.</p>
<p>But why couldn’t I see any people? No, I couldn’t feel any living creatures.</p>
<p>It felt like visiting the set of a movie. I searched Heulin like a crazy person but still couldn’t see a single ant.</p>
