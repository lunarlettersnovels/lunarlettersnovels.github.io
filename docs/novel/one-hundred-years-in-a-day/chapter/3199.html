            <h3><strong>Chapter 325</strong></h3>
<p>I looked down at the map of the Empire that occupied half of the desk.</p>
<p>With a red pen, I circled Acrab, Hoiore, and Turbeau. I tried connecting them one by one with lines. A perfect equilateral triangle emerged.</p>
<p>I blinked my eyes slowly and set the pen down.</p>
<p>“Is it a coincidence?”</p>
<p>I bit my lip as Exchetra’s twisted smile came to mind. That woman, leaving things to chance? Not a chance.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be a coincidence that ‘Heulin’ was written in the center of the equilateral triangle, alongside the towering castle.</p>
<p>She surely had another plan besides fulfilling the three conditions. Exchetra, having read the entire book, couldn’t have overlooked the flow of the story.</p>
<p>Once Blue Dragon was summoned, Julius would hear the dragon’s voice. Exchetra wouldn’t be able to defeat him while under the protection of the Blue Dragon.</p>
<p>From that point on, it wouldn’t be a power struggle.</p>
<p>Exchetra had constantly used time magic and experimented with poison.</p>
<p>The first, the experiment might be the poison on me. In the North, it seemed like an experiment related to a magic circle that could restrain Kaichen. In the West, it had something to do with the medium.</p>
<p>I wondered what purpose she had in mind while experimenting with time magic.</p>
<p>What did she want?</p>
<p>Even after hearing the myth, I instinctively felt that summoning the Blue Dragon might not be the answer.</p>
<p>Our encounters were few, and the time we spent conversing was short, but her empty eyes and the cruel smile were vivid.</p>
<p>Thud! I collapsed to the floor. My hand gripping the desk fell weakly. My legs lost strength, and I couldn’t get up.</p>
<p>“I knew you were foolish, but you’re truly… your thoughts are unbelievably simple,” I chided myself.</p>
<p>Despite countless efforts and attempts to stand up and run forward, Exchetra was always far ahead of me.</p>
<p>The sight of Kaichen facing numerous deaths in front of me flashed through my mind.  There was nothing more horrific than that reality.</p>
<p>Exchetra never intended to summon the Blue Dragon from the beginning.</p>
<p>Instead of sacrificing Kaichen, she sought a way to restrain him, to prevent him from being completely sacrificed.  To prevent the Blue Dragon from bestowing protection upon Julius.</p>
<p>The Blue Dragon longed for friends who sacrificed themselves for him. The conditions pointed to how his friends sacrificed themselves to call him.</p>
<p>The Blue Dragon was lonely.</p>
<p>Even though many knew of its existence, they couldn’t hear his voice. Only then did it long for friends who sacrificed themselves for him.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Anyone would do, please. Please, if only you listen to me.</p>
<p>The Blue Dragon and I were the same. We both longed for the centuries and thousands of years that passed in solitude.</p>
<p>When the wish is finally fulfilled, and the Blue Dragon summoned, what choice would the Blue Dragon make upon seeing Kaichen?</p>
<p>My eyes hurt. I thought I had overcome the pain, but why did the pain persist?</p>
<p>I became scared. A feeling of horror engulfed me.</p>
<p>Could I really protect Kaichen? Could I defeat Exchetra? Could I turn away the earnest wish of the Blue Dragon?</p>
<p>Me, who shared the same feelings.</p>
<p>“Uh… Ugh…”</p>
<p>I groaned in pain, and tears streamed down my face. It was hard to breathe. Bent over in agony, I put a hand on my chest.</p>
<p>“Dalia!”</p>
<p>I heard the door open with a thud, and there was Kaichen rushing to me. As always, he was there when I needed him the most.</p>
<p>He gently wrapped his arms around my shoulders and comforted me without asking anything.</p>
<p>How could I…</p>
<p>How could I protect him?</p>
<p>How could I turn away that miserable loneliness and beg him to stay by my side?</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry,” he said.</p>
<p>Why are you saying that? There’s nothing to be sorry about. You didn’t do anything wrong.</p>
