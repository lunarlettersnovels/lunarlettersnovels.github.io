<div class="sc-1sp3zau-0 fYCOwC sc-d4f3hw-0 iATlLz">
<div class="sc-1ye87qi-0 irEdXD">The people gathered around the corpse, not even flinching at the news of someone’s death, didn’t seem entirely normal.<p></p>
<p>Of course, Kaichen didn’t consider himself entirely normal either, as he had thought of entrusting the body to them when he heard the possibility of a corpse related to the Ohapdok poison.</p>
<p>“If we can’t open it, it might be tricky.”</p>
<p>“Still, considering what we found not too long ago, there might be an unexpected discovery.”</p>
<p>Kacihen watched as they mumbled among themselves, perhaps discussing valuable research findings.</p>
<p>Though they all held titles within the Tenebre, the difference in their abilities was as stark as night and day compared to Kaichen. While Kaichen was a jack of all trades, excelling in every form of magic, the others in Tenebre were not. From the outset, they aimed to excel at least in one field rather than trying to surpass the monstrous Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Oh? When did you arrive?” Jirata, who had spent the longest time in the magic tower, asked while shaking out his hair as if he had just taken a shower.</p>
<p>“I haven’t even finished my previous research yet. Don’t tell me you’re here to dump more work on me?”</p>
<p>Kaichen smiled as Jirata scrutinized him, a look that seemed as if it could strip him naked. They were accustomed to receiving whatever he threw at them, devoid of pride or intelligence, but Tenebre was undoubtedly different from other magicians.</p>
<p>Dozens of magicians had succumbed to jealousy and desire, following the path of a dark sorcerer. By choosing a different path from them, they had earned the title of “Tenebre.”</p>
<p>Initially, Kaichen had felt quite annoyed to be considered on the same level as those fools, but Dalia, who had met with them, laughed heartily and said,</p>
<p><em>“They didn’t give in to jealousy; instead, their determination was ignited when they faced an insurmountable wall in the form of the great Master Kaichen.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Determination?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes, in any case, they all want to surpass you in at least one field. They could have pursued strength through dark magic, like Antares.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Isn’t it simply that they haven’t become fools?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Not everyone is as exceptional as you, Master. They openly envy and compete with you, yet they don’t let their pride stand in the way of learning.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…Is it even right to receive instruction from the object of your jealousy?”</em></p>
<p><em>“You might not understand… hmm, that’s right. It’s true. They love magic so much that they want to know more, even if it means discarding their pride.”</em></p>
<p>Kaichen seemed to understand what Dalia had said.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Why are you smiling… in such a creepy way? What… what’s going on?”</p>
<p>Jirata’s anxious expression made Kacihen realize he had been silently staring. “I’d like to hear about the research results,” he said, snapping out of his thoughts.</p>
<p>“You… are you insane… no, what… have you been brainwashed?”</p>
<p>Not only Jirata but also the others stopped their discussions and stared at Kaichen with bewildered expressions.</p>
<p>Kaichen stepped forward without flinching, walking over documents scattered on the floor, and sat on one side of the sofa.</p>
<p>The Tenebres swallowed their dry saliva and wondered how to react to Kaichen. Saveli hesitantly extended a pile of papers, neatly organized on one side, which contained the research results related to Ohapdok.</p>
<p>Kaichen immediately fixed his gaze on the papers while Jirata, still wiping his wet hair, asked, “What’s going on? What’s happening?”</p>
<p>“He came to ask us to examine a corpse that seems to have been affected by Ohapdok poison. I thought he’d go right away… I don’t know.” Michelle shook her head vigorously, muttering half-heartedly.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy? Did your mana explode?”</p>
<p>“Maybe mana has finally taken over the brain.”</p>
<p>Olganos and Nene spoke with serious faces. It was comical how they both whispered to each other, although they knew their conversation could be heard clearly.</p>
<p>“Kaichen, who seemed like he would never change, has also changed,” Saveli commented, still holding the warm teacup in her hands.</p>
<p>Michelle frowned at Saveli’s arrogant tone. “You’re still rude.”</p>
<p>Remembering the precious flask she had thoughtlessly left behind, Michelle shook her head ruefully. “But normally, you’d just complain about the mess and disappear. Sitting on the couch, who knows what germs might lurk there…”</p></div>
