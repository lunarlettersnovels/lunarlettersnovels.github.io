            <p><strong>Chapter 237</strong></p>
<p>《Master showed us the ancient documents. When I asked if he could decipher it, he was very happy. Would he like it if I asked him if I could read other things?》</p>
<p>《D*mn it. Julius found a new owner of the cat without telling me. I couldn’t even say goodbye.》</p>
<p>《Julius laughed at me again, saying that I didn’t know how to play. He can’t even use movement magic properly himself. It seems that all he knows is to find a new owner for the cat. That d*mn bastard.》</p>
<p>《It thundered last night. Julius came into my bed and insisted on sleeping with me. He was so annoying that I wanted to immediately kick him out, but he reminded me of the trembling cat that was sent away without even saying goodbye.》</p>
<p>《Recently, as he’s been more immersed in the sword instead of magic, Julius looks more unhappy.》</p>
<p>《I made a cane. Seeing Julius holding his stomach and laughing, I felt an inexplicable feeling. It was the same feeling that I had with that cat. Damn you, bast*rd.》</p>
<p>《Master believed in the saying that magical powers have scents. My conscience was pricked by Master’s words, who believed that I didn’t lie. But I lied that it was Julius who broke Master’s teacup.》</p>
<p>《Julius teased me, saying that I didn’t know how to play games again. It seemed that he forgot that he fell from the Mage Tower window while swinging his sword-shaped staff. Stupid bastard.》</p>
<p>《Teacher asked me to go out with him, saying that he wanted to personally check the contents of the ancient documents. It’ll be my first time outside, so I’ll have to learn about the ‘games’ that Julius talked about. Then he won’t be proud and say that I don’t know that either. That damn bastard. Watch out.》</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell exactly when it was because the date wasn’t written down, but it was definitely a diary written by Kaichen when he was a child. Kaichen was extremely cute as a child.</p>
<p><em>‘Did he really like cats that much?’</em></p>
<p>I rolled around on the bed and giggled until tears came out.</p>
<p>The diary was mostly about cursing Julius along with what happened on that particular day. Then, in the last entry, Kaichen went out for the first time in his life.</p>
<p>I didn’t even know how old he was since the date wasn’t written in the diary. Anyway, the diary ended there.</p>
<p>I turned to the next page, wondering if he had written after returning from his outing. Then, after a few pages, the next entry appeared.</p>
<p>《I threw Julius out the Mage Tower window when he asked me if I knew about games. Who wouldn’t know? I know about games, but I don’t want to think about it. D*mn, I don’t want to think about it but it keeps popping up in my mind.》</p>
<p>It probably hadn’t been long since he returned from his outing at the time of writing this. It was just a guess, but there wasn’t a big difference in handwriting from the previous entries.</p>
<p>《Disgusting. That child’s words play over and over in my head. Now, I can’t stand dirty things.》</p>
<p>《The more I think about it, the angrier I get. The fact that you came to me first, the fact that you smiled first, the fact that you offered me your hand first. I hate it, I hate that annoying child.》</p>
<p>《That damn Julius is said to be the prince of the empire. It would be difficult for a guy who doesn’t know how to do anything to survive properly in the Imperial Palace. I’m annoyed, but I should help him. If so, will I ever get to meet her?》</p>
<p>《I heard the news. It’s said that she grew up to be beautiful and kind, so her future is expected. It must all be a lie; it must be a theatre play. I’m still haunted by that memory… That shameless woman.》</p>
<p>In the final entry, the neat handwriting changed to that of the now familiar Kaichen, who became an adult.</p>
<p>《Julius said time magic manifested in Acrab. I heard the news that your parents died, but how do you feel as these things happen one after another? I should be thrilled to think that your shameless face will be overshadowed by sadness, but I feel uncomfortable. Will you remember me after destroying the magic? Even if you remember… Or if you forgot… I think I’d still feel angry.》</p>
<p>Every time he thought about <em>her</em>; every few years he wrote about Dalia in his diary.</p>
<p>I felt strange when I saw the last article that he probably wrote right before I transmigrated into this world.</p>
<p>Kaichen definitely met Dalia as a child, but it seems clear that it ended badly.</p>
<p>After that, he loathed, hated, and despised her, but after reading the diary, it wasn’t necessarily only hatred.</p>
<p>From Kaichen’s point of view, Dalia was someone who didn’t remember him.</p>
<p>It was because I went crazy in the original story. And now, I have no memories of the previous Dalia.</p>
<p>Was Kaichen angry when he saw that I didn’t remember him? I thought he would be.</p>
<p><em>Sniffle-</em></p>
<p>I am Dalia now, but the Dalia whom Kaichen met and liked when he was young wasn’t me… To think that I’m jealous of myself.</p>
<p>It was funny. But, if Kaichen didn’t just hate Dalia, but also harbored a small crush on her, then it meant that he had liked Dalia for a long time, so I couldn’t help but care.</p>
<p>“His first love… Hmm.”</p>
<p>My man’s first love is me, but in actuality, it wasn’t me.</p>
<p>So, for some reason, I felt strange that I was bitter for no reason. I licked my lips and put the diary under the pillow again. I stretched and yawned.</p>
<p>It seemed that there would be no more hidden secrets from Kaichen other than this diary.</p>
<p>Of course, I learned a lot from this alone. Kaichen was better at swearing than expected, liked cats, respected his teacher Hamal, and cared for Julius even though he thought very little of him.</p>
<p>I glanced outside through the window attached to the room. It was a great height. To throw Julius out from a place like this, friendship was truly mysterious.</p>
<p>Humming, I went out. I brought the books that I was looking for, as well as the ones I wanted to study after.</p>
<p>It seemed that I wouldn’t have to come to the Mage Tower any longer.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, I opened the door. Countless eyes widened and flinched at the same time.</p>
