            <p><strong>Chapter 227</strong></p>
<p>Exchetra had abducted all the female lead candidates who were scheduled to meet Julius at the right time and kept them locked away in a mansion accessible only by magic.</p>
<p>She couldn’t kill Dalia Alshine at the time since the fate of the characters always followed the original story. Therefore, she chose to only prevent Julius from meeting her. However, her perspective changed once she discovered that Dalia Alshine was alive and that the future could be altered if nobody had significant influence over Julius’ fate.</p>
<p>Exchetra had no qualms about killing the two other female lead candidates, but she couldn’t do the same to Yanghwa. It was because she was the real heroine who would eventually connect with Julius.</p>
<p>“Is she an incredible person?” someone asked.</p>
<p>“She’s the one who will give Julius the great force and power of Suran,” came her answer.</p>
<p>“Then why did we let her go?”</p>
<p>“It’s because they will inevitably meet.”</p>
<p>Asta remained silent.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you? There are things that must happen. She and Julius must meet. Although it can be delayed… it cannot be stopped forever,” Exchetra said with a hint of resignation in her voice.</p>
<p>Her companion remained silent, seeming to contemplate the situation.</p>
<p>“What, it’d be a lot of fun to see them think about why Count Alshine sent them Ja Yanghwa,” Exchetra added, trying to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>Shifting her attention to Acrab’s development, Exchetra considered the impact of Kaichen’s magic on the region’s prosperity. Gold-related products had been pouring out of Acrab for some time, indicating the construction of a gold mine. This boded well for Julius’ future plans to pave the way for the Suran Empire.</p>
<p>But in order to accomplish this, he needed the help of a particular individual – Ja Yanghwa. If Exchetra were to prevent their meeting, she knew there would be consequences. This was Julius’ story, after all, and if she disrupted the destined romance, the story would come to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>However, Exchetra didn’t feel like she could kill Ja Yanghwa like the other female lead candidates. There was something different about her role in the story.</p>
<p>So instead, she’s going to resort to drugging and brainwashing the two of them in the future. However, Exchetra wasn’t sure how effective it would be, especially given Ja Yanghwa’s ability to sense magic.</p>
<p>“Then, what do you think of doing? Are you going to let the crown prince interact with the Suran Empire?” Asta asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to come up with another plan. There’s still a lot of time left before the path to Suran opens up.”</p>
<p>“Have you come up with any plans?”</p>
<p>Exchetra focused on her paperwork, her quill hovering over the page as she considered her options.</p>
<p>Countless plans had been simulated in her mind since she was young, but the appearance of Dalia Alshine had changed everything. The girl’s foolish behavior made it difficult to believe she was a transmigrator, although it could be the typical attitude of a tansmigrated person.</p>
<p>Despite her wariness, Dalia was led by her emotions and acted selflessly, even though she regretted it. She believed in the contents of the original work and knew it was a trap, yet she had brought Ja Yanghwa with her anyway.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t hurt to inform the Suran Empire that Princess Ja Yanghwa is here. If she falls for the prince and make people misunderstand by pretending that she’s addicted to drugs, they’ll never be able to establish a friendly relationship.”</p>
<p>“But if they clear the misunderstanding…”</p>
<p>“It’s only a temporary setback. We’re buying time for the next operation. It would be nice if Ja Yanghwa obeyed fate and took Julius’s soul away…” Exchetra chuckled as she flipped to the next page of the document.</p>
<p>To Exchetra, Ja Yanghwa’s existence was nothing more than a temporary obstacle in Julius’s path. Although they had let her go first, taking the power of Suran hadn’t caused a significant setback to the plan.</p>
<p><em>‘Don’t drive yourself into a corner too much. Even worms wriggle when you step on them…’</em> Exchetra mused, imagining the shattered and crumbled face of the one who had made her dream of hope.</p>
<p>Asta silently watched Exchetra work expressionlessly. After a while of hearing the sound of the quill moving, Exchetra suddenly spoke.</p>
<p>“Asta, what if Julius becomes emperor in the end, regardless of what I do?”</p>
<p>“I will follow the princess’s decision.”</p>
<p>“But if that happens…”</p>
<p>Exchetra paused, putting down her quill and slamming her hand on the desk before snapping her fingers. “You won’t let him be a happy emperor, will you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it will be done according to the princess’s wishes.”</p>
<p>Exchetra knew that Dalia Alshine was just a character who appeared briefly in the novel. But as the main antagonist, she couldn’t help but wonder if her own fate could be changed.</p>
<p>What if her destiny was different from that of Dalia Alshine?</p>
<p>In response to her own thoughts, Exchetra laughed cruelly with bright eyes.</p>
<p><em>‘Well, if that’s the case, I’ll just have to twist her fate around to make it a sad ending.’</em></p>
