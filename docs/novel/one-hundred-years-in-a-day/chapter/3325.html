            <p><strong>Chapter 198</strong></p>
<p>It was scandalous how much my body reacted to his voice, but it just showed how much I liked Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Dalia.”</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>“Am I the only one who wants this?”</p>
<p>If I refused him here, he would definitely stop. He was someone who would do anything for me rather than follow his own desires…</p>
<p><em>‘Oh, God…’</em></p>
<p>I didn’t know I would be conflicted beyond belief. My eyes glanced back at his member. His stiff pen!s was standing proud, looking fierce as if it wanted to ram itself into me. It wasn’t something I could call gentle…</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I couldn’t resist Kaichen. I wanted to be <em>one</em> with him.</p>
<p>“I want it too…”</p>
<p>Kaichen brought his face closer, kissing my forehead and cheeks at my answer. His smooth naked body laid over mine as if we were already one from the beginning.</p>
<p>His hand reached downwards and touched my wetness. When bit my lip in embarrassment and turned my head, he immediately pressed his lips onto mine.  With his other hand, he supported his body with his elbow and stroked my hair, as if telling me not to be nervous.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s thick fingers touched my wet petals. The experience was so new that it startled me and I flinched. Sensing my nervousness, he stroked my hair and gently kissed my cheeks, nose and lips.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes at his tender touch and relaxed. I m*aned as he rubbed my folds covered in wetness. After a while, his finger experimentally slid into my slippery, aching hole. It felt strange, and yet I was anticipating more.</p>
<p>“Ah…” I sighed as his finger slowly dug deeper. Kaichen continued kissing my face tenderly.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Just breathe and relax…” he whispered.</p>
<p>“Ah… hng.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. You’re doing good.”</p>
<p>Kaichen’s lips curved upwards, as if he was proud of me. His hardness poked my thigh, but he moved carefully so as not to scare or hurt me.</p>
<p>His fingers moved inside me, pushing, and curling upwards, stimulating my walls as I breathed and trembled beneath him. Soon, another finger entered. His kisses soothed me and this time it wasn’t difficult for another finger to enter me. A third one wouldn’t even be a problem.</p>
<p>But with Kaichen’s thing… the future was bleak.</p>
<p>My thoughts were cut as I heard a squelch from his finger stimulating my core. I was so wet.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Soon, a third finger entered. This time, my walls protested and tightened around his fingers. I spread my legs wider, wanting him to explore me deeper and wrapped my arms around his neck. He dove down for my lips and sucked hard on my tongue that it made a sound.</p>
<p>“Hnng! Ha Ma-master…”</p>
<p>“Haah…”</p>
<p>Kaichen’s lips detached from mine and his hot breath fell on my cheek and he focused on scissoring his three fingers inside me. My waist unconsciously moved with the rhythm, following the motion of his fingers pushing in and out. A m*an escaped my lips as the strangeness gave to pleasure. Kaichen’s breathing became rougher at the sounds coming from my lips. My core trembled and felt like it was melting. His fingers pushed upwards and moved a little faster. Kaichen lowered his face and took my moving mound into his mouth.</p>
<p>“Ack!”</p>
<p>My vision was blurry as he bit my nipple with his teeth and sucked it. His tongue swirled over my peak. He already figured that my chest was very sensitive, and all my nerves were concentrated in that place so he took advantage of it.</p>
<p>The er*tic sounds of my wetness echoed. His fingers touched a point that made my toes curl. I was lost to my heightened senses, my sensitive body.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>I could feel the height of my pleasure just from his fingers alone.  As he swept his tongue around my peak and moved his fingers in me, I couldn’t think of anything but call for him through my m*ans.</p>
<p>“Ah, Master!”</p>
<p>The build up was making me feel anxious, desperate and out of it. I pushed his head away that had been sucking on my mound. He looked at me with dark eyes.</p>
<p>“Hah… Master, ah…”</p>
<p>“Tell me what you want.”</p>
<p>“…Ha! Ah!”</p>
<p>His fingers that had been digging inside me slipped out. My eagerness to ask him to stop was quickly replaced by a feeling of emptiness. My back shook subconsciously.</p>
<p>Kaichen slowly got up. His angrily stiff dick was leaking from the tip, showing how much he had suffered until now. He was no different from me.</p>
<p>He positioned himself so that his tip loosely touched my aching entrance. I gasped. He rubbed his manhood across my wet petals softly, purposely tantalizing me as his tip teased my entrance and escaped again.</p>
<p>“Master, ah… ah…”</p>
<p>“Say it, Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what…?”</p>
<p>Kaichen kept his mouth shut tight. He wanted to hear me say that I wanted him wholly. Even though he wanted to enter me immediately, he was patient and cared for me until the end. It was as if he was giving me one last chance. If I didn’t like it, I had to tell him now.</p>
<p>How was this man not greedy even in this situation?</p>
<p>How hard did he fall for me?</p>
