        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 256</strong></p>
<p>I couldn’t understand Exchetra’s mind entirely and felt uneasy inside. I became frustrated with my lack of knowledge and closed my eyes tightly.</p>
<p>Even a tiny thought brought numerous possibilities—ideas like ‘Maybe this way’ and ‘Maybe that way’ cluttered my mind.</p>
<p>Though I knew that was what Exchetra and the fused one desired, I had developed a habit of considering the worst outcomes after the terrible ordeal in the northern lands.</p>
<p>There could be terrible consequences, like losing Kaichen and thinking that made it impossible not to ponder such thoughts.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I couldn’t grasp her intentions.</p>
<p>Why did Yanghwa get kidnapped, placed in a strange location, subjected to dru!g addiction, and use superficial measures to create misunderstandings that wouldn’t last with the Suran Empire? I couldn’t understand it at all.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was sure Exchetra was thoroughly enjoying it. As if playing an amusing game, moving chess pieces. It felt like she was delighting in prodding and watching startled reactions.</p>
<p><em>‘How despicable.’</em></p>
<p>My eyes felt strained for no apparent reason, so I pressed my temples.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling unwell?” I thought Kaichen was focused on his book, but he noticed my darkening expression and asked.</p>
<p>I lowered my hand, suspecting he might be concerned, and opened my eyes. “Hmm… I’m already tired from thinking about enjoying the party. You know I don’t like this kind of thing,” I replied.</p>
<p>His persistent golden eyes seemed skeptical, as if not believing my words. I wrinkled my nose. He finally looked away only after I had repeated my reassurance six times.</p>
<p>I realized I needed to be alone with my thoughts. With Kaichen picking up on my anxiety like a ghost, it was futile to think when he was around. I didn’t want to indulge in unnecessary worries. I couldn’t reveal all the complexities of this situation.</p>
<p>Looking out the window, I saw the distant Manuwell Dukedom.</p>
<p>Having failed to find his beloved daughter, Duke Manuwell found it painful to stay near where she disappeared. As a result, he moved to the outskirts. And as if he believed his daughter would return one day, he expanded and beautified the lavender garden, once a symbol of the dukedom, even more than before.</p>
<p>All for her eventual return.</p>
<p>That wasn’t enough; every year, grieving for his missing daughter, the duke held a garden party in the lavender garden.</p>
<p>Even though it wasn’t the palace, the event had grown so large that nobles from Heulin, living near the capital, attended.</p>
<p>The garden party, stretching from a warm afternoon to night, was a refreshing event where one could casually enjoy light meals, stroll through the gardens, and appreciate music. It would be easy since it wasn’t too formal.</p>
<p><em>‘Don’t feel uncomfortable. Enjoy the party with Yanghwa,’ </em>I remembered Julius’s words.</p>
<p>I didn’t particularly dislike parties. I had some reservations about overly formal atmospheres, but it was bearable.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s just people who make it uncomfortable, after all.’</em></p>
<p>People were the ones causing discomfort. Their gazes, whether admiring or filled with negativity, made it difficult. Dealing with people in a place filled with pretense was tiring and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The carriage stopped, and Kaichen got off, extending his hand.</p>
<p>I wondered if he would lift me by the waist again and twirl me around. As I looked at him briefly, he chuckled and gestured lightly.</p>
<p>“Feeling self-conscious?”</p>
<p>“I’m not. It’s… It’s just embarrassing.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” he nodded. “So it’s something you dislike.”</p>
<p>“Really! I didn’t say I dislike it.”</p>
<p>“Your expression says otherwise…”</p>
<p>“Does it show?”</p>
<p>Kaichen’s eyes narrowed as he looked at me. As I raised the corners of my mouth, he responded with a raised brow and a slight nudge with his finger.</p>
<p>“I appreciate positive gestures. I just said it’s embarrassing,” I said. Before I could give Kaichen time to reply, I turned my head towards Yanghwa.</p>
<p>“Princess, you haven’t forgotten my advice, have you?” I said.</p>
<p>“Of course not!” Yanghwa eagerly replied.</p>
<p>“If any problems arise…”</p>
<p>“Find Daliah, find Kaichen, find His Highness the Prince.”</p>
<p>“If someone causes trouble…”</p>
<p>“See if anyone’s around, then follow the plan.”</p>
<p>“If there’s a pervert…”</p>
<p>“Give them a warning!”</p>
<p>It was an intense way of influencing her thoughts.</p>
<p>I felt proud of having taught her so well, so I straightened my shoulders and smiled with satisfaction. Although Kaichen gave me a doubtful look, wondering what I had taught her, it was fine.</p>
<p>When it came to handling incidents, Julius would be responsible anyway.</p>
<p>The Manuwell Duke’s garden was vast, thanks to its location on the capital’s outskirts. Seriously, it was enormous beyond imagination. It was even larger than a soccer field.</p>
<p>Lavender flowers bloomed profusely in some areas, and there were also leisurely paths. While there were no flowers in the spaces for light dining, dancing, or enjoying tea, the faint scent of lavender wafted in the air, which was pleasant.</p>
<p>It was a relief, easing the stress from my overactive thoughts. Lavender was indeed delightful to the senses.</p>
<p>Feeling mentally calm, I sat inconspicuously and sipped herbal tea, basking in the warm sunlight. Due to the garden’s expanse, there wasn’t the typical intense focus of attention that one would find at a regular ball, and I found this to be satisfying.</p>
<p>Julius was right – it wasn’t uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“A party like this is nice,” I said, savoring the soothing herbal tea and smiling contentedly. It felt like the stress was melting away.</p>
<p>“Ah, it feels like the stress is just melting away.” Yanghwa echoed my thoughts as she enjoyed her dessert. “It would be fun to have a party in the Rose Garden in Acrab,” she continued.</p>
