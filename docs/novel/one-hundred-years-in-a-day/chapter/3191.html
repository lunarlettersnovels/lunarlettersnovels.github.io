            <h3><strong>Chapter 333</strong></h3>
<p>I was scared. So scared that I felt anxious and nervous if I didn’t think about something. I was scared that the memory of the pain I had already overcome would come back.</p>
<p>“Dalia,” Kaichen called me, his voice softer.</p>
<p>What is the weight of my sins? In this ambiguous reality, where there are no victims and yet everyone is a victim, I was tormented again and again.</p>
<p>No matter how many times I washed my hands, they were still stained with red blood. Even though I believed I had moved on, the phantom pain in my eyes reminded me not to forget.</p>
<p>When I was imprisoned and tortured, when I killed my enemies underground, there was no hesitation. On the contrary, I felt exhilarated and clear-headed.</p>
<p>Before I came here, I couldn’t believe I lived in a world where killing resulted in an instant jail sentence.</p>
<p>A hundred years. Time that will remain even after a person’s life is over. That time changed me. Even if that horrible thing hadn’t happened for a hundred years, I siitll would have changed.</p>
<p>As time passes, people change.</p>
<p>“Why should I continue to be good when my sin has returned and is trying to take someone dear to me away from me? Master, I’m not good, and I’ve been wrong from the moment I transmigrated into this crappy world.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You know what they say about sacrificing for the greater good? That’s nonsense.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Even if it means the deaths of tens of thousands of people in Heulin, I’ll choose one person. You, Master! Over tens of thousands of strangers.”</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>“No! I only want one, and I’m not being greedy. It’s just you, Master. You say I only need you, why!”</p>
<p>I thought I’d gotten it all out, but the lump in my throat wouldn’t let up. I jerked away from Kaichen’s hand on my shoulder and let out a scream.</p>
<p>I bit down hard on my lip to force my eyes open. If I didn’t, I felt like I was going to burst into tears. I glared at Kaichen in frustration, and he looked down at me wordlessly.  Warm enough to melt the gibberish words inside me.</p>
<p>“Dalia, there’s something I need to tell you,” he looked at me steadily and slowly held me in his arms. ‘I’m thinking of making a… sacrifice.’</p>
<p>His words rang in my ears, and for a moment, I thought I was dreaming.</p>
<p>“There are many other ways… Master… Master, what if it goes wrong? I can’t live without you!”</p>
<p>My chest felt like it was burning. I imagined a future without Kaichen and the thought of it frightened me so much that it hurt.</p>
<p>As I spit out my frustration, Kaichen wordlessly reached for my hand. This time, I couldn’t bring myself to shake his hand away, so I clenched my fist and trembled.</p>
<p>Kaichen gently cupped my cold cheeks. There were no tears, but my face looked like a mess anyway. My face, reflected in his warm eyes, was white with fear.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I put so much responsibility on you.”</p>
<p>A low voice filled my empty chest.</p>
<p>“Dalia, my… Dalia.”</p>
<p>The way he said my name always took my breath away. He said it out of possessiveness, but there was also extreme love in it.</p>
<p>Kaichen looked at me with so much warmth and love in his eyes that my heart would burst. I stared at him, forgetting to breathe.</p>
<p>What a beautiful smile. I never knew this man could smile like this.</p>
<p>“Where would I go without you?”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you promise me?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I don’t intend to leave you alone either. You know that my sacrifice isn’t forced. I made a choice. To be with you. Not to sacrifice a cow for the greater good.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Because I am sacrificing for you.”</p>
<p>I bit my lip hard. Kaichen gently brushed his thumb across my lips. When I saw his eyelashes calmly lowered, I couldn’t bring myself to say anything.</p>
<p>The touch of his lips against mine made my heart race. I could feel my empty chest fill with warmth.</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>I remained silent.</p>
<p>“I intend to save you again, just like that day.”</p>
<p>Kaichen wrapped his arms around my shoulders and stroked my hair until my emotions calmed down. As if soothing a crying child.</p>
