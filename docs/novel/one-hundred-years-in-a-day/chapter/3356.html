            <p><strong>Chapter 167</strong></p>
<p>She lowered his head, trying to suppress whatever she was struggling with.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. Whatever happened in the past is in the past. Besides, we already cleared everything. Countess Vega, please feel free to speak your mind.”</p>
<p>Most people who are fidgety and restless have reached the edge of their rationality. I remembered the fear that flashed through her eyes – it was the same fear I felt when I was trapped in time. She was helpless and she was desperate for any solution at all. I slowly got up from my seat and approached Countess Vega. I had no experience in comforting people. But I tried my best to pat her on the hand. Maybe if someone had been there to comfort me when I needed it the most, I would have turned out different.</p>
<p>“Sheliak, it’s okay. It will be better to talk it out. You can talk to me.” Perhaps it was because I had called her by his name, Sheliak looked a little relieved. She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“I—I have a dear friend. We grew up together. He is my closest friend. He is the very esteemed son of Viscount Hoiore in the north. He was not very fortunate when it came to physical health, so he often stayed at our estate to recuperate. He always did his best to help me in difficult times. I haven’t been able to contact him for three months now.”</p>
<p>“Do you fear that he may be hurt or extremely sick?”</p>
<p>Sheliak shook her head. “If he was sick, his butler would have called me. However… there hasn’t been any sort of communication at all. No matter what means I use to contact him, I can’t reach him. Magic communication doesn’t work. And any messenger I send doesn’t return.”</p>
<p>I patted her trembling shoulders. “The place Hoiore resides in, it protects people from the icy mountains, doesn’t it? It is also a border area. It is unlikely to lose contact entirely that way…”</p>
<p>“Right?! That is what I thought too! But it’s been like that for three months now. I don’t have many friends and those that I did tell, didn’t take me seriously. Everyone said that he might be deliberately avoiding any kind of communication with me…”</p>
<p>I did not have to know more to understand that this person Sheliak talked about was her lover. It was no wonder she was restless and on the brink of falling apart with worry. It was obvious that people expected it to be a simple break-up if the other person avoided contact so suddenly.</p>
<p>That explanation was strange though. If it was the case, magic communication would be rejected but, in this instance, it didn’t work at all. There was no way a magic communication would be inaccessible, unless… someone tampered with it deliberately.</p>
<p><em>Something is not right, </em>I thought.</p>
<p>Sheliak was frowning and trying to hold back her tears. “I think something is amiss. If there is a problem in the north, it is bound to blow up. But…”</p>
<p>“Hoiore Estate is a cold place all year round,” continued Countess Vega. “He always came to Vega estate in winter because the cold is especially extreme during that time. Those winters were too harsh for him… if anything happens to him, I…”</p>
<p>She was usually so stoic and emotionless. Getting all soft and vulnerable for the people one loves seemed to be a universal thing. If I was in her place, I would be the same. Perhaps my consolation wasn’t really working because Sheliak burst into tears. She must have been truly desperate and barely holding himself together, came all this way to plead with me even though we weren’t close at all.</p>
<p>Sheliak was a provincial aristocrat who did not have a proper mansion in Heulin, so I let her stay in my mansion for the time being. Shee declined profusely, so I tried to convince her that it was only for the purpose of finding out more information regarding the case. Fortunately, that seemed to work. She bowed deeply and thanked me for my kindness.</p>
<p><em>I was also a provincial nobleman just a while ago</em>. Had it not been for Kaichen and Julius, I would not have even set foot in Heulin, let alone own a mansion. Therefore, having connections was important.</p>
<p>The sun was already setting by the time I persuaded her to take a rest and showed her room. It felt like the day went by so quickly because I had slept late. Today was the only day that felt wholesome and happy. I felt it was very unfair that the day was ending fast, and I didn’t have the time to spend it with Kaichen. But I was very curious now to investigate the incident in the north.</p>
<p>Since Kaichen still wasn’t back, I decided to stop by the Magic Association. By today, my face was familiar to everyone in Heulin after the ball, so I used some appearance altering magic that Kaichen had taught me.</p>
<p>“Can I use the telecommunication contact?”</p>
<p>Heulin’s magic association was huge. Although it was a bit far from the Wizard tower, it was in the most densely populated area and was the headquarters of the association.</p>
<p>Magic marbles floating in the air illuminated the inside of the association building. The magic marble, which stored all the sights that come into view as images, acted like a sort of CCTV. It was a very complicated formula and consumed a lot of magic power, so it was usually installed only in the room where the aristocratic family kept their wealth in a safe.</p>
<p>In the Magic Association, however, the marble balls were everywhere, almost in every room. It almost felt as though they fulfilled the function of showing off rather than of security.</p>
<p>“Prices vary depending on distance. Where do you want to contact?” The friendly association staff asked me.</p>
<p>“Viscount Hoiore of the North.”</p>
<p>“All of the Northern Territories are currently unreachable due to unstable communication conditions.” The answer came automatically.</p>
<p>“Is there a reason?”</p>
<p>“It is a sudden anomaly, and we are currently investigating it. Unfortunately, we will have to wait to find out. My apologies.” It was an expression of sincere apology for not being able to show off her proud magical abilities.</p>
