            <p><strong>Chapter 233</strong></p>
<p>“Then, this strange purple thing must be opium from Yanghwa’s body. Ah, Master has gone to check again, so maybe it isn’t…”</p>
<p>“Do you think that this is opium, a type of drug?”</p>
<p>Hamal kept asking me questions. I wasn’t sure why he was interrogating me. It wasn’t like we were playing a game of riddles or 20 questions. But he persisted, as if he already knew the answer and was only testing me.</p>
<p>I did my best to examine the purple substance on the cocoon. It gave me a creepy, disgusting feeling, like contamination that was staining clean healing magic. Kaichen had felt something similar before, and he had described it as the filthiest thing he had ever smelled.</p>
<p>The magical power surrounding the purple substance reminded him of the magic circle that prevented him from using magic in the north.</p>
<p>“Could this be magic?” I asked, hoping to get some clarity from Hamal.</p>
<p>Hamal smiled softly, and even I, who didn’t know him well, could easily see that he agreed.</p>
<p>I frowned, realizing that if it was purple magic, it belonged to the wizard under Princess Exchetra, who was aiming for Kaichen. An unknown sorcerer, he was a black magician who had similar magical abilities to Kaichen and knew all kinds of terrible magic. It occurred to me that the information about Exchetra’s lackey wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“Is it possible to confuse magic with opium? If not… Was magic mixed in when the opium was made?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Can Yanghwa recover?”</p>
<p>“She can recover.”</p>
<p>Hamal, who didn’t answer the first question, replied about her recovery.</p>
<p>Looking at the cocoon, which was now two-thirds covered in purple magic, I bit my lip. My knowledge was narrow, and there were too many things I didn’t know. I only made uncertain guesses every time, and I didn’t predict anything properly.</p>
<p>“You seem to have lost all of your old memories,” Hamal said.</p>
<p>I suddenly felt nervous. “Ah… yes, I’m sorry. The memory of meeting the great sage… I seem to have lost it.”</p>
<p>“You can just call me Hamal. You used to call me Grandpa.”</p>
<p>“Gra… s-sorry.”</p>
<p>“Hoho! Weren’t you young. It was at a time when you didn’t even know who I was.”</p>
<p>I met him without knowing his identity. What kind of story did we have? I was curious, but it was embarrassing to ask, so I only smiled awkwardly and said nothing else.</p>
<p>A moment of silence followed, and this time, Hamal spoke first.</p>
<p>“About Kaichen. What would you like to do… with that kid?” Hamal asked me.</p>
<p>I was taken aback by the question. “Huh?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hold his hand because there was something you wanted to do?”</p>
<p>“Kaichen was an innocent child. He grew up studying magic in the Mage’s Tower being oblivious about the world and even less about people. I was always worried about that.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I could tell immediately that he is no longer the child I cared for. Children grow up. Just like you have.”</p>
<p>I did not immediately understand what Hamal was saying. Hamal was something like a wise man, teacher, or something in a fantasy world, who used simple words but made you ponder about the hidden meaning to them.</p>
<p>“So, I grew curious. What did you want to do with Kaichen, since you were holding hands?” Hamal pressed.</p>
<p>I remembered holding hands with Kaichen the first time we met. It wasn’t a physical gesture, but rather a symbol of our connection. Normally, I would have joked about it, but for some reason, I felt like if I didn’t answer this question seriously, Kaichen would be taken away.</p>
<p>I sighed, feeling a bit annoyed that I had to explain myself to Hamal, but I knew I owed him an answer. He was Kaichen’s teacher, the great sage, and the master of the tower. He was like Kaichen’s parent after all.</p>
<p>“Do you know where Master hides in? I call it the Willow House.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I’m staying here because I have work to do, but I want to live in the willow tree house with Master. I will live happily with Master until my hair turns white and my skin sags with wrinkles.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I want to do that, so I held Master’s hand. I want to live happily. Master is essential to my happiness.”</p>
<p>I smiled and answered confidently. It was embarrassing to admit, but it was true.</p>
<p>“Does Kaichen feel the same way?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t talked to Master properly yet. Even so… I believe we’ll stay together.”</p>
