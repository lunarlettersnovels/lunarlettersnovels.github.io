            <p><strong>Chapter 110</strong></p>
<p>She looked at Kaichen regretfully. She had an excellent eye for spotting potential in people. She should have seen through Kaichen’s ability and his extraordinary talent. It was natural for those who had ambition to want powerful people on their side. Akshetra was no different. Kaichen, on the other hand, had not taken a side yet. Julius was worried. It would be a great damage to him if Kaichen complied with the princess.</p>
<p><em>There is no way Kaichen will turn his back on me, </em>thought Julius. <em>But what if he did it for Countess Alshine?! He is a madman in love. He could do anything. </em>Julius stared at Kaichen who was completely unaware of his friend’s concerns. Kaichen would never turn his back on his friend. He had had so many opportunities and yet he had stayed.</p>
<p>Julius thought, not for the first time, that Akshetra was more worthy than him to take the place of the emperor. If he hadn’t come across her cruelty he would have happily stepped down and let her be the ruler.</p>
<p>Kaichen knew Akshetra and how cruel she could be if she wanted to. But Julius still worried. He knew his friend wasn’t someone who bothered about other people. If Akshetra gave him what he wanted, Julius thought he might turn sides. It wasn’t that Julius didn’t trust Kaichen. It was just that he knew Kaichen was a very practical man. Besides, people did crazy things for love. Julius’ worries were understandable.</p>
<p>“There is nothing to regret,” said Kaichen. “Unless you continue harming Acrab then you will face the full force of my power.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to fight me too?” asked Akshetra.</p>
<p>“That depends on you.”</p>
<p>Akshetra’s easy smile disappeared from her face at Kaichen’s words. It was a warning. The coldness in her stare to freeze the air in the room, and yet Kaichen did not budge.</p>
<p>“I am telling you for the last time,” said Kaichen. “Please take your hands off Acrab.”</p>
<p>“What if I don’t?”</p>
<p>“I already told you,” said Kaichen. “I will do everything in my power to defend it.”</p>
<p>Julius was shocked. He turned to look at Kaichen. He had thought that he followed Kaichen needlessly. But now, his heart soared. His worries were put at ease. Kaichen would never join Akshetra.</p>
<p>He felt foolish and selfish to be feeling happy at a time like this. He felt thankful to this madman and countess Alshine. <em>Kaichen would never join hands with someone who had been involved in harming Countess Alshine.</em></p>
<p>It also meant that Acrab and Countess Alshine had suffered too much of a damage for kaichen to feel so strongly about it. The countess suffered from the poisoning, as did half of Acrab. She had been trapped in time magic before that. She must have gone through unimaginable pain. Julius was surprised to find her still sane after going through so much.</p>
<p>“It is funny that you are provoking me for a fight,” said Akshetra. “I wonder why Acrab is so precious to you. Why are you obsessed with the place?” She smiled again. “What are you hiding there?” Akshetra’s cold blue eyes shone. She tapped the armrest of the sofa with her fingernails. “Or, are you trying to protect something? Someone?” Akshetra raised an eyebrow. “Countess Alshine is safe, is she not? Even though the time magic made her suffer so much, she is alive and well in her estate. That, in itself, is very fascinating.”</p>
<p>Aksetra’s smile deepened. “I will do as you want. If the epidemic does not continue to spread, them the empire is safe. There will be no reason for me to target Acrab.”</p>
<p>Akshetra raised a hand and propped her chin on it. “Only… Countess Alshine and her estate has suffered so much damage. Whatever should I do to help?” she asked, in mock worry. “I heard the countess has been having a difficult time.”</p>
<p>“That’s just a rumour,” said Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Hm,” she said. ‘I think it’s true. I heard she finds it hard to manage her land.”</p>
<p>“It is not bad to the extent that the Imperial Princess has to worry.”</p>
<p>“But the fact remains that my ‘mistake’ has posed a great threat to Acrab, isn’t that so? I must compensate for the damage.”</p>
<p>“There is no need,” said Kaichen, refusing to back down.</p>
<p>“Are you the Lord of Acrab?”</p>
<p>Julius didn’t like where this was heading. He saw Kaichen clench his fist. “The countess might, of course, ask for help,” he interrupted hurriedly. “I would like to meet her personally and apologize to her for all this mess. I can apologize on behalf of the whole family.”</p>
<p>“You?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Julius. “It won’t look good if you went out of your way to apologize to the people of Acrab. It may undermine the dignity of the Imperial family. Leave that to me.”</p>
<p>“Hm. I don’t want to burden you, little brother,” she said. “Won’t the dignity of the Imperial family be undermined if the Crown Prince himself is seen apologizing to the countess?”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” said Julius, trying to diffuse the situation. “I can’t compare myself to you! I will also take care of the compensation. I will make sure I give a proper reward on behalf of you. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Akshetra looked displeased at Julius’ intervention but she couldn’t risk taking on the trouble and having her name smeared.</p>
