            <p><strong>Chapter 139</strong></p>
<p>It was absurd and untrue. He didn’t go out of his way to explain. He didn’t feel like he needed to. He had done nothing. Kaichen stopped going to parties and balls after that day. After he surpassed his master and achieved the title of Archmage, the rumors slowly disappeared. But Kaichen never forgot that day.</p>
<p>The last person he ever wanted to see in his lifetime was in front of him. More so, she was acting up against Dalia, the person he cherished the most.</p>
<p><em>This is going to be a pain in the neck. </em>Lamia hadn’t yet looked at Kaichen. If she did, she would make it worse by digging up past resentments.</p>
<p>“Will you please get up now if you are done eating?” said Lamia Sorel, pretending to be polite in the presence of company, “It’s so considerate of you. I can even reward you for your kindness.”</p>
<p>Dalia rolled her eyes. Kaichen noticed that she had been unusually quiet until now. Her eyes twinkled and the corners of her lips curled up. Kaichen sighed inwardly. That look meant more trouble. Something surprising and unexpected happened when she looked like that. Her cheeks were turning red like a child who had found an interesting toy.</p>
<p><em>Tsk, of all things… </em>It seems that her curiosity was piqued. At times like this, he knew she never gave up. Instead, he gave up on the idea of stopping her. He will have to figure out how to clean up this mess with the daughter of Marquis Sorel.</p>
<p>In the end, people supported those who were close to them. If Dalia picked a fight, he would back her up. <em>I have nothing to say even if they call me a crazy bastard. </em>Kaichen smiled. He shook his head and watched Dalia preparing for her next move. She had a very evil smile on her face. It was fitting. <em>I, a madman, in love with her, the absolute madwoman.</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At first, I assumed that the woman shouting at the entrance was just a haughty noble. When she came up to me, I saw that she was quite pretty. God was good at balancing things. He balanced her beauty by giving her a rotten personality. I didn’t even know who she was. I was just enjoying the fight when I heard a man approach her.</p>
<p>“Lady Sorel?” he called.</p>
<p>“Oh, Sir Petral.”</p>
<p>I thought I had been struck by lightning. I remembered these characters from the original novel. Lamia Sorel, the only daughter of Marquis Sorel. She had been involved in that nasty debacle with Kaichen when he had called her ‘an animal in heat’ and ‘filthy’. I glanced at Kaichen, but he appeared so carefree as though he didn’t mind the situation at all.</p>
<p>“Will you please get up now if you are done eating? It’s so considerate of you. I can even reward you for your kindness.” I was not fooled. That backhanded politeness reeked of nothing but humiliation. She was trying to act nice and polite because of the man beside her. He seemed to be her new toy.</p>
<p><em>I never thought I’d meet them like this! </em>Unlike Lamia, who was a negative character, the man beside her was a knight who was loyal to Julius. Chushinick Petral was Julius’ guard and absolutely loyal to him. He had a gentle and kind temperament.</p>
<p><em>I can’t believe that such a man suddenly appeared as Lamia’s partner in a place like this</em>. The original novel was already twisted but this was absurd! Still, he wore a ring with the emblem of Julius’ empire, so perhaps he was still the same person. I had recently heard vaguely that they were recruiting the Crown Prince’s escort officers.</p>
<p><em>Hmm… This is going to be fun.  </em>Chushinick, a simple young man who became the Crown Prince’s guard, and an arrogant Marquis’ daughter. I didn’t know how they ended up together, but I wasn’t going to take this sitting down. I also needed to get revenge for the time rumors accused Kaichen of harassing her when he had done nothing.</p>
<p>I smiled and thought about how to lead the current fight to victory. I didn’t even look at Kaichen. Besides, he didn’t seem to have any intention of stopping me.</p>
<p><em>Did he really not remember her? </em>No matter how indifferent Kaichen was to others, it was hard to believe that he didn’t remember this woman. <em>It’s better if he doesn’t remember, </em>I decided. I felt better knowing Kaichen didn’t remember any woman at all.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” I said politely. “Maybe you got the wrong person. I haven’t finished with my dinner. I am just about to order dessert, actually.”</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>“I think you must be mistaken.”</p>
<p>“What about?!”</p>
<p>“I never intended to leave out of consideration. Rather, I am a little offended that you so rudely interrupted my precious time when I am not even done eating.”</p>
