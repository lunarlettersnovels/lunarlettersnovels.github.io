<p><strong>Chapter 145</strong></p>
<p>Kaichen didn’t even say anything, but she blushed bright red. I could feel my hands clenching tightly at Kaichen’s sleeve. <em>Sending flowers?! </em>  I didn’t feel good. I felt awful. From the moment I knew who Lamia was, the uneasiness had risen in my chest. My heart felt heavy.</p>
<p>“Never mind. I know that Mr. Kaichen hates such procedures and formalities. I will be happy to just see you attending in person.”</p>
<p>If I put everything that had happened so far aside and look at Lamia, she almost looked innocent and pretty. But I knew she was spouting nonsense. I didn’t want to point fingers and let her be with her own lifestyle without judgment. But if her target was Kaichen, then it was an altogether different story. As if she was determined to test my patience, Lamia covered her mouth and smiled, then gently touched Kaichen’s arm.</p>
<p>“Oh, my! I said something embarrassing again…”</p>
<p>“Huh, Teacher? You have got something on here.” I tilted my head and brushed at the place where Lamia had touched Kaichen’s arm a while ago. It was rude, I know. I pretended to clean Kaichen’s arm as though her touch had somehow tainted him. Lamia’s eyes widened as she watched me. I felt petty because she sneered instead.</p>
<p>I gently pulled Kaichen away and hid him from Lamia’s sight. Lamia calmly took a step to the side and stood next to Kaichen again. It was childish, but I took another step in front of her and obscured her view.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” she asked.</p>
<p>I squared my shoulders and said, “I was afraid that dust would get on my teacher.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you see that we’re talking?”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you talking to yourself?”</p>
<p>“W-What?!”</p>
<p>“I mean you were chattering by yourself. I didn’t hear anyone else speak… just you.” As I smiled softly, Lamia’s face turned red, but she didn’t back down.</p>
<p>“We have a lot to talk about since we met after a long time. Would you please step aside?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Do you lack the ability to understand words?” she asked in mock politeness. “Do you want me to repeat it once again?”</p>
<p>She sounded so polite. She was like a different person altogether from the one in the restaurant. Maybe because I called Kaichen ‘teacher’ and she knew I was with him; she was being polite. But even if she had turned the intensity of her rudeness down, she was still the same person.</p>
<p>“Oh my! You have me all figured out, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You even know about the abilities I… lack.” I smirked at her. She looked enraged. I knew she would have shouted at me then, but she glanced at Kaichen. I turned to Kaichen. He looked indifferent so I didn’t know what he was thinking about.</p>
<p>I was annoyed at being unable to shake off Lamia. Kaichen did nothing wrong, but I felt annoyed at him for standing there silently. “Teacher, let’s head back,” I said, trying to keep the vexation from my voice.</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Come on, let <em>us</em> go.” I glared at Lamia while emphasizing the word ‘us’. I grabbed Kaichen’s arm and pulled him with me. Kaichen flinched but I had no intention of letting him go. Lamia’s eyes widened in fury as I pulled Kaichen with me. I glanced at her smugly.</p>
<p><em>Look, I can do this, too. </em>This is the privilege of a disciple. Lamia’s face turned red and she clenched her fists.</p>
<p>“Teacher! Let’s go!”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know what he was thinking about, but he followed me stiffly. His arm was so stiff as I pulled on it. I realized he was feeling uncomfortable. I felt conflicted. <em>Was this too much? </em>I felt a little regret at acting so hastily because I wanted to win against Lamia. But Lamia was still staring. I didn’t want to let go of his arm in front of her. I hurriedly dragged Kaichen through the crowd and headed for a dark alleyway.</p>
<p>“Dalia!” I thought that I had done something wrong from the way he called my name.</p>
<p>“Yes, teacher?” I said nervously.</p>
<p>There was not a single person in sight. It seemed that I kept walking even after we left the square and entered the alley. It wasn’t until I came back to my senses that I realized I was still holding onto his arm. I let him go and looked around. I couldn’t raise my head to look at Kaichen.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Teacher.”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>“She… seemed like your acquaintance, but I was too rude.”</p>
<p>“She is not my acquaintance,” he said without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Then why did you keep listening to her talk, pardon my words, crap?”Jealousy really makes people so ugly. I felt embarrassed.</p>
<p>“I was just listening in to know how far she would ramble on.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because she didn’t seem to be in her right mind.”</p>
<p>“And would you have listened to her till the end?”</p>
