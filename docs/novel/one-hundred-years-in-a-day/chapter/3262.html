            <h3><strong>Chapter 261</strong></h3>
<p>“But do you understand why I called you both fools?”</p>
<p>“Ha! Again with this…!”</p>
<p>“Calm yourself, Lady Sorel!”</p>
<p>Yanghwa, poised to execute the plan, grinned broadly and lightly scratched Lamia’s temper. She leaned against the table, her chin cradled in both hands.</p>
<p>“His Highness the prince didn’t ‘entrust’ a princess from the same continent to a count; he <em>tasked </em>Count Alshine with treating the Princess of the Suran Empire in accordance with her status.”</p>
<p>“What are you implying?”</p>
<p>“Lady Sorel, please regain your composure!”</p>
<p>“Could a person from high society truly remain ignorant of how the empire operates? Are you genuinely a gem of high society? I’m not just any noblewoman; I’m part of the imperial family of the Suran Empire. I’m not a mere guest from the East; I’m an envoy from the Suran Empire, sent to establish diplomatic ties with the Kalhai Empire.”</p>
<p>For the first time, I grasped that her adorable aegyo could also appear threatening.</p>
<p>“Ha! This is utterly absurd… Do you think I’d be frightened if you hadn’t uttered that nonsense? Why isn’t the countess saying anything? Do you find this amusing?!”</p>
<p>It felt as if Yanghwa had gained the upper hand, causing the tension to naturally revert back to me. Lamia clenched her fist and directed an intense glare my way, while I blinked and shrugged.</p>
<p>“What should I say?”</p>
<p>“I believe you think you can penetrate high society even without acknowledging me. It’s quite amusing, really. Bringing a woman who prattles about being a princess from an unheard-of nation, tarnishing Kaichen’s reputation with rumors, and so on…”</p>
<p>An exasperated sigh slipped from me. Once more, I felt like I understood why Lamia, who failed to become a proper antagonist, faded away in the original tale. She followed Yanghwa’s lead. Young and inexperienced, she struggled to distinguish truth from falsehood, wrapped up in her own thoughts and lacking deep insight.</p>
<p>Thus, despite her humiliating dismissal, she would likely revert to clinging to Kaichen. Regardless, Lamia was too naive and vanished early on, fading into obscurity.</p>
<p>What was slightly surprising was that even though I thought we were both fools since they hung out together, Dubonnet had her lips tightly pressed, her pale face a stark contrast. She probably knew more about the kingdom’s situation and had a brighter head on her shoulders than Lamia did.</p>
<p>She must have heard about the news of the Princess from the Suran Empire. However, she apparently hadn’t thought that innocent and seemingly naive Yanghwa could be that ‘Princess’. The cluster of women around them had similar expressions of unease.</p>
<p>Several young women had mirrored Dubonnet’s change in expression.</p>
<p>“Questioning my Master’s honor? I’ve never heard such rumors.”</p>
<p>“You too! Ugh… So crude…”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Dubonnet jumped in surprise as Lamia suddenly stood up and slammed the table. Yanghwa and I blinked in astonishment, watching her. Yanghwa got up from her seat, her lips curling as she approached Lamia, almost like she was offering a remedy.</p>
<p>“Why so angry? Does Kaichen and Dahlia being in love bother you?”</p>
<p>“That’s not it! Being with such a lowly woman… How dare they!”</p>
<p>“Kaichen chose her, and you’re calling her lowly. Isn’t that even more disrespectful~”</p>
<p>Lamia’s hands trembled at Yanghwa’s casual attitude as she approached, seeming like she intended to slap her. I wondered if I had taught her too strongly. It didn’t need to escalate like this…</p>
<p>“S-Sorel Youngae… Please calm down. You seem really upset.”</p>
<p>Dubonnet tried to calm Lamia, but it didn’t work. Seeing that, other young women who were watching jumped in to stop them, getting involved like in a fight.</p>
<p>‘What’s happening?’</p>
<p>I thought, taking a deep breath. Just before things could turn physical, I stood up from my seat.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>A weak cry from Yanghwa echoed. At the same time, Dubonnet’s face went from pale to bluish. She wasn’t looking at where the scream came from; she was staring directly behind me.</p>
<p>But without checking what Dubonnet saw, I gathered up my dress and maneuvered through the group of young women to get to Yanghwa.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, are you okay?”</p>
<p>Yanghwa was sitting on the floor, her cheek red as if she’d been slapped. Her eyes were fixed sharply on Lamia, her gaze intense.</p>
<p>I swallowed hard, squinting as I watched Yanghwa. I used my hands to reassure her.</p>
<p>Among the surprised Lamia and the confused young women around her, I emerged. Before me were Kaichen, Julius, Chushinik, and the host of the evening’s event, Duke Drenice Manuwell, with his two sons. I had a strange feeling in my throat. Could this really be happening…?</p>
<p>I hoped not. Still, despite my efforts to hold back Yanghwa, she seemed to give in.</p>
<p>“Ahhh! Ugh! K-kuek! Huuueeeng!”</p>
<p>Unlike when she had glared at Lamia with wide eyes, Yanghwa’s big, dark eyes now had teardrops that welled up and trickled down. Suddenly, she collapsed onto the grass-covered ground, crying uncontrollably. Everyone around her was surprised, frozen in shock.</p>
<p><em>‘This can’t be real, right…?’</em></p>
<p>Quickly adjusting my position to offer support, I sat down beside Yanghwa, my face showing surprise. Gently, I comforted her.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, I’m sorry this upset you… It’s okay. I didn’t handle things well.”</p>
<p>“Huuueeeng… Huik… Kkuik! Huuueeeng!”</p>
<p>As a twenty-two-year-old adult, Yanghwa didn’t seem embarrassed as she wiped her nose and let her tears flow. Sometimes her body trembled as she struggled to breathe. She truly looked heartbroken.</p>
