            <p><strong>Chapter 253</strong></p>
<p>That there was no one else there and that she really thought she was turning into one too.</p>
<p>In fact, she had only eaten fruit there, so the food here was really amazing. Even if it wasn’t cooked by her, it was the best.</p>
<p>Yanghwa thought about it continuously, crying even more as Dalia patted her back in a comforting way.</p>
<p>If she said that she felt like she was dying and that she was really scared, would this person hug her silently like this even then?</p>
<p>“It’s okay, you’re safe now… Yanghwa.”</p>
<p>Just like when she first reached out to help, like Rosa, who was the only one to help after they arrived in this place, Dalia repeated herself over and over again.</p>
<p>Yanghwa felt exhausted and her consciousness began to fade, but she suddenly became curious.</p>
<p>How could someone with so much pain in their heart cry and comfort someone else?</p>
<p>What had they gone through to have the power that caused them such terrible pain?</p>
<p>Feeling something akin to a mother’s gentle touch, Yanghwa sniffled and drifted into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>She had a feeling that she would only have good dreams.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In my previous life, there was a time when I took care of my friend’s dog, albeit only briefly. One day, she suddenly said that she quit her company and wanted to come back after enjoying a trip abroad, so she asked me to take care of her dog in the meantime. It was on her bucket list.</p>
<p>Originally, her parents in her hometown liked dogs and she wanted to leave her dog to them, but a sudden car accident made it impossible.</p>
<p>I had raised a dog before when I was young, and she said that I was the most reliable person for the job because I had a regular commuting schedule.</p>
<p>I already liked going for a walk with my dog, but after taking care of my friend’s dog, I also enjoyed going to dog cafes.</p>
<p>The dog’s name was Maximoff. His nickname was Maxim.</p>
<p>I still don’t know why she gave the Welsh corgi that name, but Maxim was a very sweet puppy.</p>
<p>Maxim had short legs and a plump butt. It liked to act cute and was smart, so I never had problems with it.</p>
<p>For nearly half a year, it was taken care of with the utmost sincerity since it was away from its owner. How lonely it must’ve been being in the care of a stranger.</p>
<p>I wondered if it was stressed out from missing its owner, so I even woke up at dawn and made video calls to make sure that Maxim wasn’t lonely.</p>
<p>Half a year later, my friend, who had enjoyed her overseas trip to the fullest, hugged Maxim tightly and tried to take it back.</p>
<p>However, as if responding to my affection, Maxim whined and didn’t want to leave my side. I forcibly sent Maxim to its owner as my tears fell.</p>
<p>And that night I laid in bed in tears and stayed up all night. While looking at the pictures of Maxim taken for the past half year.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even funny, but the reason why I suddenly remembered the memories with Maxim was because of Ja Yanghwa chasing me with her twinkling, big, brown eyes.</p>
<p>“Umm… Princess? Why….”</p>
<p>“I thought it might help!”</p>
<p>“A bath?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and stared into space for a moment. When I lowered my gaze again, Yanghwa was taking off her clothes with a wide smile.</p>
<p>She was about to grab a towel and push my back.</p>
<p>“Why is the princess trying to wait on me!”</p>
<p>“Oh? Then… Should I wait outside?”</p>
<p>There seems to be no other option in the head of this small and precious creature other than to go into the bath together.</p>
<p>When Yanghwa drained her tears and runny nose of two months, she was completely at a loss.</p>
<p>She recognized me as her new master, and like Maxim, followed me around wagging her tail and acting cute.</p>
<p>My heart when ‘ack!’ She was so cute and lovable that I wanted to hold her. Just like Maxim at that time, I started to coo at her without even realizing it!</p>
<p>“Princess, at times like this, I’m saying that we should take a bath together.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Then let’s do it together! I want to take a bath with Dalia!”</p>
<p><em>‘Oh, dear! Adorable!’ </em>I bit my lip and closed my eyes tightly.</p>
<p>When Yanghwa smiled, the dimples on her cheeks deepened and the fats under her eyes came out, showing her lovely smile.</p>
<p>I had been suffering from this deadly cuteness and loveliness for two months already.</p>
<p>Seeing me feeling troubled, Kaichen exclaimed with a dissatisfied expression, “You seem like you like it, so what?” while feeling annoyed.</p>
<p>Julius silently gave me a thumbs up and patted me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>His expression was really annoying, so I subtly told Yanghwa not to be friendly with the crown prince.</p>
<p>Needless to say, she listened to me so well that even when Julius spoke to her, she didn’t answer, hiding behind me and staring, which made it even more difficult.</p>
<p>Splash- splash-</p>
<p>Watching Yanghwa playing with water like a kid, I kept thinking about how to treat that innocent child.</p>
<p>“Princess, if you want to do something with me now, you have to ask me to join you, not help me do it.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I understand.”</p>
<p>“Because you’re not waiting on me.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“In the Kalhai Empire, no one can tell the princess to wait on her.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You have to remember this.”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>Yanghwa nodded her head broadly and smiled. She answered me well, but it wasn’t very reliable.</p>
<p>My worry grew like a mountain. There was a reason why I was so apprehensive. Tomorrow would be the day I had to attend the garden party to be held at the Manuwell Mansion.</p>
<p><em>[An envoy from the Suran Empire will come soon. They’re not just common upper-class people, they’re the real deal. You know how big this is, right? I don’t know if my sister is coming herself, or if she’s coming after receiving my call. So, we must treat Princess Yanghwa with utmost respect. Please.]</em></p>
