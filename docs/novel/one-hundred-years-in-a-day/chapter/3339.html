            <p><strong>Chapter 184</strong></p>
<p>Walter shouted furiously at my blunt words. “Don’t try to make me feel guilty! Isn’t it the same as  saying I’m already dead even if I’m still breathing.. If I were to save them, I would die! No more… no more! I wouldn’t be able to see Sheliak!”</p>
<p>I looked at him placidly. “But even if you don’t destroy the magic, you can’t see Sheliak either, right?” Walter remained silent. I continued, “Do you hold any hope that you’ll be able to see her when you can’t even leave this place?”</p>
<p>“… If I’m alive won’t she be able to see me!”</p>
<p>People became foolish and desperate in the face of death. Either because they were scared, or they were in a hurry. I raised my head and looked straight at Walter.</p>
<p>“No one can enter this place,” I slowly said.</p>
<p>“But, you-”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I already tell you? I’m a <em>victim</em> of time magic – just like you. That’s why I was able to come in. But… Sheliak isn’t one, right?”</p>
<p>Walter didn’t seem convinced. “In the end, you’re asking me to sacrifice myself.”</p>
<p>“I said that it was your choice,” I replied. Then in a hardened voice, I asked, “Then, do you want Sheliak to experience being trapped in time magic just so she can come here?”</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous!”</p>
<p>Enraged, Walter jumped out of his seat and slammed his fists on the table. He closed his eyes and shook his head. He was terrified just thinking about it.</p>
<p>“Such, such… such a terrifying thing… how could she…”</p>
<p>I watched sympathetically. I, too, once held a little, fragile hope that someone would come to rescue me.  But besides that, I had extraordinary mental strength thanks to my advantage of a second life. I had maintained time magic for a hundred years without breaking because of it.</p>
<p>However, Walter was different. Born weak and with only a few days left to live, he was unstable, both in mind and body. Even if he didn’t have a few days left to live, he’d be as bad as the other mediums if the time magic was broken.</p>
<p>He spoke as if he had a choice, but his pale face and his ragged breathing whenever he was furious showed that his mental and physical strength were at their limit.</p>
<p>I gauged the situation at hand. Three months. That was the limit of time he could maintain with his mental power.</p>
<p>Walter was still in a deadlock. He was torn and confused, unwilling to give himself up. I slowly rose from my seat and soothingly patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Walter, communication magic and telekinesis are currently impossible in Hoiore. Do you have any idea how worried Sheliak is?” I said.</p>
<p>“…Hahhh…”</p>
<p>“Should I lie to her and remain mum about you?”</p>
<p>Tears fell from Walter’s brown eyes. “I… I’d like to say my goodbyes to her first…” he mumbled.</p>
<p>Indeed, a mention of a special person can change someone’s mind. Walter swayed back and forth, his spirit was crumbling, but his words were sincere. He wanted to die valiantly without regrets before he died.</p>
<p><em>‘From the very beginning, he held out until someone came to save him…’</em></p>
<p>My nose prickled unconsciously. For some reason, it felt personal. Walter must’ve waited eagerly just like I had waited for Kaichen every day, preparing portraits of criminals, and preparing myself to say goodbye. No matter how much I wanted to live, I didn’t want to live in a frozen place just to achieve immortality.</p>
<p>I composed myself and approached him. “I’m sorry for asking this, but… after telling her your goodbyes, is it alright if I investigate you as a medium?” I asked.</p>
<p>Walter nodded his head.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the video-storing magic I learned from Kaichen to use for pranks, finally had a purpose and could be used for Walter. I turned around, walked to a corner, all the while trying to hold back my tears as Walter said his goodbyes.</p>
<p>After he said his farewells, I temporarily placed the video in the communication seat ring given to me by Julius. Walter looked at me.</p>
<p>“What should I do next?” he asked in a tight voice.</p>
<p>I coughed loudly and held out my hand. “I’m not as gentle as Master, so I’m not very good at it, but I’m going to take a look at your body. Relax and don’t move even if you feel strange,” I said.</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>I grabbed his hand after telling him to lean back comfortably on the sofa. Walter’s hands were as cold as mine. It felt a little strange since I had only ever held Kaichen’s warm hands. I closed my eyes slowly and poured my magic into Walter’s body, erasing other thoughts.</p>
<p><em>‘Pour in the magic and feel it naturally. If he’s affected by time magic, there should be something dark and listless, just like I had…”</em></p>
<p>My brows scrunched in concentration as my magic attempted to infiltrate Walter’s body.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Walter let out a short moan at the unfamiliar sensation, but not to the point that it felt intrusive.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah, found it! It’s the time magic crystal appears when a person becomes a medium. Judging by the fact that it’s so small… the size seems proportional to the time spent in the time magic space.’</em></p>
<p>I initially rejoiced. Then I felt something strange when I examined his body, as I recalled the time I examined my own body with Kaichen at the willow house.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh? What is this? It’s a familiar sensation…’</em></p>
<p>The closer I moved my mana, the worse he felt.</p>
