            <h3><strong>Chapter 276</strong></h3>
<p>“Right now? Shouldn’t we at least check first…”</p>
<p>“If we enter the area of time magic, time might flow differently from the outside. You haven’t forgotten Acrab, have you?”</p>
<p>Kaichen pressed and released his temple while closing and opening his eyes. “There’s a magic seal that can prevent the use of magic. Saveli, follow me.”</p>
<p>“Ah… Yes!”</p>
<p>“And you, stop doing as you please—”</p>
<p>“JIrata, you too.”</p>
<p>Jirata, who had been about to express his anger, tightly sealed his lips.</p>
<p>Kaichen noticed that Jirata was approaching him, muttering about how Kaichen shouldn’t be doing whatever he pleased and bossing him around to come along. Although his words and actions differed, he ignored them as he had to focus on the matter at hand.</p>
<p>Saveli shyly approached, blushing and bowing deeply. She seemed like someone with an unrequited crush in front of their love interest. But Kaichen merely glanced at her.</p>
<p>While she hadn’t officially received the title of “Tenebre” yet, Saveli’s skill in creating magic seals surpassed the other four Tenebres. Moreover, she was a bigger magic enthusiast than they were. Her shyness wasn’t due to the human “Kaichen” but rather the magic power possessed by the Archmage Kaichen.</p>
<p>If he had to pick the least <em>normal</em> person, it would undoubtedly be Saveli.</p>
<p>Kaichen wanted to act alone if possible, but he didn’t know if he would be unable to use magic again or if another unique situation would arise like before. So he decided to take the two of them with him. In his view, this was the most appropriate team to handle the current situation.</p>
<p>As soon as Kaichen heard the words “time magic,” he had to erase thoughts of Dalia forcefully.</p>
<p>“I can’t… send her to a place like that again.”</p>
<p>Even though it was an inappropriate response to the situation, he had no other words to say. Kaichen didn’t want to push Dalia into the realm of time magic as he had done in Hoiore.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he also thought that the magic seal that had blocked the magic might not exist this time.</p>
<p>After all, Jirata had detected the magic in Hoiore, which Kaichen couldn’t. This time, Kaichen assumed there would be no magic seal to block it.</p>
<p>“Report separately to His Majesty.”</p>
<p>He gave the order and cast the teleportation spell before Michele, still in a daze. Before Michelle could reply, Kaichen cast teleportation magic as Jirata recited the precise coordinates.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>With Jirata and Saveli on either side, Kaichen moved forward and looked at the thick castle walls that came into view. He rubbed his temple.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious, but… we’ve come to counter time magic, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“Then, there’s no reason for me to be here if Saveli isn’t aware…?”</p>
<p>As someone with a talent for magic detection, Jirata was also quite skilled in tracking magic. The purpose of bringing him along was more for tracking than detection.</p>
<p>Kaichen briefly explained the situation and also described the magic seal that had prevented magic usage in Hoiole.</p>
<p>“A magic seal that prevents the use of magic… just hearing about it irritates me.”</p>
<p>For a mage, magic was everything. Creating a magic seal that prevented its use was likely the work of another mage.</p>
<p>However, among mages, there was an unspoken rule that they avoided creating magic that would affect other mages’ magic, even if it was an attack on the opponent.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a strict rule, but any mage, regardless of who created it, could use magic that had been calculated, understood, and whose principles were known. This was one of the reasons magic had developed as it had.</p>
<p>However, if a mage were to create magic that targeted other mages themselves, they could also become the target.</p>
<p>“Is it lack of fear or something else…” Saveli pondered deeply, her expression growing solemn as she spoke. “He might be a magician uninterested in magic. He may be someone who doesn’t mind using magic but wouldn’t care if he lost it…”</p>
<p>“You’re talking about a Magic Knight?”</p>
<p>Jirata asked, scanning his surroundings before posing the question.</p>
<p>At the mention of a Magiknight, Kaichen naturally thought of Julius, who was renowned for his exceptional talent in both magic and swordsmanship. While he excelled more in swordsmanship when it came to talent, his abilities as a magician couldn’t be ignored. If he had continued to focus solely on magic, he could have easily earned the title of ‘Tenebre.’</p>
