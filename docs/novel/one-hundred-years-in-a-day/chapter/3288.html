            <p><strong>Chapter 235</strong></p>
<p>Hamal quietly raised his staff towards the cocoon, covered in purple magic, and recited something lowly.</p>
<p>The pure white magic sparkled and scattered around like the first time, and then the purple magic residue slowly floated into the air before it slowly evaporated. It was a purification magic that was as good as his healing magic.</p>
<p>Wounds inflicted by evil showed completely different symptoms from ordinary poisons, and even antidotes couldn’t cure them. If it wasn’t the priest’s treatment, it was cured only after cleansing the wound with purification magic.</p>
<p>That was why the magic that ordinary wizards, who usually made money by hunting monsters with mercenaries, learned was purification magic.</p>
<p>Hamal said that he matched well enough with the magic that it was as easy as breathing. Hamal was a wizard specializing in the healing system, like a priest. Of course, it wasn’t that he couldn’t do other magic, so he must have been a great wizard before Kaichen.</p>
<p><em>‘The remnants of the black magician magic… It must have been removed with purification magic.’</em></p>
<p>I was wondering about how to get rid of that purple mass of magic, and purification magic seemed to be the solution. I had never seen Kaichen use healing-type magic like Hamal.</p>
<p>I had a realization that purification magic would be essential in dealing with black magicians, who were one of Exchetra’s strongest cards. Yanghwa wouldn’t be the only person to become addicted to opium and black magic like this and need treatment. According to Julius, Kaichen said he was “unable” to cure Yanghwa. It wasn’t that he couldn’t do it, but rather that he lacked confidence in his abilities.</p>
<p>Should I learn purification magic as well?</p>
<p>“I’ll inform His Highness. Kaichen… Would you like to research a way to counter this?” Hamal said, breaking me from my train of thoughts.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that Master’s specialty?” Kaichen shot back.</p>
<p>“Heh heh, you’re acting like you can’t do it.”</p>
<p>“It’s not something I can do.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying you won’t even try?”</p>
<p>“Master… I don’t want to endure disgusting things while studying.”</p>
<p>“Among the things you’ve experienced in the world, there must have been things you didn’t like and things you liked. Even if you didn’t like it at first, weren’t you able to put up with it once you started it?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“It’s research for other people, not for yourself, and you’re still refusing?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Kaichen glared at Hamal and gritted his teeth. Then, he slowly turned to look at me and sighed before lowering the hand that covered his nose and mouth. He frowned so much that wrinkles appeared between his brows, and he looked like he was about to argue. However, instead of arguing, Kaichen spoke resignedly.</p>
<p>“Do you like testing me like this all the time?”</p>
<p>“Watching you grow is one of my life’s joys.” As he said that, Hamal threw the glass bottle containing the purple magic remnants over to Kaichen.</p>
<p>Kaichen levitated the glass bottle and inspected it closely before setting it down on the table. He seemed lost in thought as he stared at the remnants of the black magician’s magic.</p>
<p>Hamal chuckled and banged his staff on the floor, causing the white cocoon to fade into a powder of light. The figure of the foreign woman was revealed, breathing peacefully with a calm expression. It seemed that Hamal’s magic had worked as her complexion was much better than before.</p>
<p>“I’ll come back tomorrow. A week of proper treatment should completely eliminate the remnants of the opium.”</p>
<p>“Th-thank you…”</p>
<p>On behalf of Kaichen, who didn’t answer, I bowed my head to thank him.</p>
<p>Hamal smiled softly and disappeared, emitting a misty powder of light, just like when he had appeared.</p>
<p>As I turned to Kaichen, I saw him looking nervous, which was unusual. It was a bit strange to see my master being pushed around by his own master, Hamal.</p>
<p>I wanted to help Kaichen with his research, but he refused.</p>
<p>“Master, I will help you with your research!”</p>
<p>“Stop it.”</p>
<p>“Why? You said you couldn’t do it because it smelled disgusting. I can’t smell anything, so I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>“…Isn’t it strange to you that I can smell magic?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why? Should it be strange?”</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes wide and tilted my head, Kaichen smiled and messed up my hair. It was a pretty hairstyle, so I shot Kaichen with a dissatisfied look.</p>
<p>“Normally, no one can smell magic,” he said.</p>
<p>“Um… Master is the genius of the century. There’s nothing strange about having a special ability. Rather, isn’t it more wonderful if you have abilities that are different from others?” I replied.</p>
<p>“What a stupid thing to say,” he retorted.</p>
<p>“Master, have you forgotten? I am a genius myself,” I said with a playful wink.</p>
<p>Kaichen then flicked a finger on my forehead, and I rubbed it while smiling brightly. Even though I offered to help him with his research, Kaichen was always the one to step in and assist me whenever I was struggling.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but wonder how he learned to understand other people’s magical abilities. Although there were limited magic books in Acrab’s library, I had read and studied countless books that Kaichen had brought me.</p>
<p>He read, memorized, and understood everything, but he had no interest in that kind of field, so he brushed many things off. Kaichen never forced me to learn things I wasn’t interested in, and I appreciated that.</p>
<p>As I pondered where I could find more resources to learn about magic, I thought about asking Julius for a pass to the imperial library. If that didn’t work out, maybe the Magic Association could help. Or perhaps, the mage tower could hold the answers I was seeking.</p>
