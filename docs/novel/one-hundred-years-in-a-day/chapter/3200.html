            <h3><strong>Chapter 324</strong></h3>
<p>I hummed as I thought about what would happen in the future. It didn’t matter if variables arose.</p>
<p>Unlike Exchetra, I wouldn’t rely on anyone. I wouldn’t make mistakes. I wouldn’t let my guard down.</p>
<p>Only now did I recall what fate had befallen my parents, who had only looked at me with fearful eyes.</p>
<p>I burst into laughter loudly. I didn’t know why this memory had come up now, but my composure remained unshaken.</p>
<p>I simply nodded with a brief, satisfied smile.</p>
<p>“You’ve been saved.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I scrutinized the paper containing newly added information about Exchetra.</p>
<p>Though glaring at the paper wouldn’t change anything, I did it out of frustration, hoping it might help me vent some steam.</p>
<p>Lately, an overwhelming amount of information had flooded in, leaving my thoughts in disarray. I decided to organize them on paper, and this was the result. Some details were added, and others were modified based on what I heard from Jungyeonhae.</p>
<p>It only complicated things, and my head throbbed.</p>
<p>“Ah… Finally found the purpose, but…”</p>
<p>Now that I knew, the frustration seemed to intensify. There was no solution that immediately came to mind. The thoughts of Kaichen also added to the frustration.</p>
<p>Although I confidently declared in front of Jungyeonhae that such a thing wouldn’t happen, uneasiness lingered.</p>
<p>Kaichen had heard everything from Julius already. His nonchalant attitude reflected that, but the slight surprise in his eyes when he heard my words was unexpected.</p>
<p>Why did he look at me like that?</p>
<p>Did he think I’d give up on him?</p>
<p>Regardless, I was a bit annoyed.</p>
<p>Not only at Kaichen for not telling me the truth immediately but also at myself for not being able to say “It’s okay” after learning everything.</p>
<p>Why didn’t I finish reading the entire story? Just because of that little payment issue. How much did it cost, really?</p>
<p>If I had paid for the preview, I would have known everything and been prepared.</p>
<p>I regretted the same thing over and over again until I finally gave up. Digging into past events wouldn’t yield any results.</p>
<p>I needed to focus on preventing Kaichen’s sacrifice and the second condition.</p>
<p>Exchetra knew how to summon the Blue Dragon. Let the beauty of the world be overshadowed three times. Three instances of time magic came to mind.</p>
<p>Considering the effort and meticulous planning Exchetra put into fulfilling these conditions, there surely was more to it.</p>
<p>Time magic was the most effective way to distort the world. But the blue dragon doesn’t want his precious friend to be used that way.</p>
<p>The second condition was “when the land is filled with sorrow to the point where the sky sheds tears.”</p>
<p>Humans, who drenched the land with blood, were once destroyed by the tears of a sorrowful blue dragon. The two other dragons also sacrificed themselves to become ‘Earth’.</p>
<p>The conditions were all related to the dragons sacrificing themselves for the blue dragon.</p>
<p>The third condition involved the sacrifice of the golden dragon’s incarnation.</p>
<p>My forehead creased in thought.</p>
<p>It might have appeared in the sequel, somewhere else, or was mentioned in the book. Exchetra would have uncovered all the related clues before the Kaichen’s final sacrifice.</p>
<p>Was Julius becoming emperor a gift that the blue dragon said he would give to the person who could listen to his voice?</p>
<p>What does Exchetra want to do by summoning the blue dragon?</p>
<p>Even if she sacrificed Kaichen, it wouldn’t be much different from the original ending. Julius would overcome the death of his precious friend, become emperor, and ultimately meet a happy ending.</p>
<p>The main character will have a happy ending. This was what happened in the original plot, anyway.</p>
<p>“Why, then?”</p>
<p>I pondered so deeply that I almost felt steam rising from my head.</p>
<p>Acrab, Hoiore and Turbeau. Time magic in the East, North, and West. It was undoubtedly the first condition. What else was there?</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>I pressed my eyes tightly and searched for the map of the Kalhai Empire in the study.</p>
<p>Something heavy was weighing on my chest. My breath was tight, and my throat parched. Thoughts gradually melted away. My hands were sweating. I was fraught with unease.</p>
