            <h3><strong>Chapter 284</strong></h3>
<p>Like the way I am now.</p>
<p>“No point in asking why you do this, right? You obviously enjoy causing misery.”</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I need to ask about your plan. I just realized something.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“After thinking about it a bit, I believe I understand. I feel pretty foolish too. Can’t believe it took me this long to figure it out.”</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and exhaled. It felt like my lungs were collapsing. Breathing was hard. My body, which typically had a slightly lower temperature, was burning up to an incredible degree. I’m in terrible shape.</p>
<p>When Eve first tasted the forbidden fruit, she might have felt immense happiness. But because the price of that happiness was too high, she couldn’t help but resent Satan, who had deceived her.</p>
<p>Oh, I’ve committed a grave sin.</p>
<p>I wallowed in self-loathing and tried to wash away my sins, but humans had already been abandoned by God and entered a world of sin and corruption, influenced by Satan’s deceptions.</p>
<p>I’d never been to church, so I couldn’t possibly know the true Bible stories. I might have seen interpretations that wildly distorted the stories through novels, comics, and animation and thought they were authentic.</p>
<p>But when a shocking story is etched into your mind, you can’t think of anything else.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I was so captivated by the story that I fell into the ‘story’ itself without even thinking about understanding where it began, what the truth was, and why I ended up here.</p>
<p>After a terrible dream and knowing that awful torture was probably waiting for me soon, when I saw Exchetra sitting in front of me, a thought finally struck me.</p>
<p>Why was Exchetra so interested in me?</p>
<p>It wasn’t because she wanted to gain control over Kaichen or get rid of him that she set an obvious trap like this and brought me here.</p>
<p>The reason they put so much effort and attention into this, going to the trouble of bringing out the deep darkness I had hidden away and coming to watch me tremble in fear, finally occurred to me.</p>
<p>“I imagine it was enjoyable for you, watching me struggle and squirm.”</p>
<p>“It was quite entertaining.”</p>
<p>“So, when did you start?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>The reason could be that I had become an important person to Julius and Kaichen. However, if that were the case, she wouldn’t have exposed herself to me in this manner.</p>
<p>Exchetra was cautious, meticulous, and self-assured, which made her more skilled at planning ahead and perfecting her plans than anyone else.</p>
<p>The moment I opened my eyes and saw Exchetra through a dizzy haze, I felt that one of the questions I had been worrying about until now was answered.</p>
<p>I was convinced when I saw her looking down at me with cold eyes and a triumphant smirk.</p>
<p>“When did you possess that body?”</p>
<p>Exchetra didn’t help a transmigrated person. Exchetra <em>is</em> the transmigrator. That’s why she could plan more skillfully and execute more perfectly than anyone else.</p>
<p>She must knew everything to the end and worse, she transmigrated into the body of the princess.</p>
<p>“I guess you’re very stupid.”</p>
<p>Exchetra didn’t hide her amusement.</p>
<p>She revealed her presence to the bard and encouraged me to feel even more uneasy by sharing the anthem of our country.</p>
<p>Exchetra knew.</p>
<p>She must have guessed that I was a transmigrator after seeing that Dalia Alshine, who should have died, survived and became Kaichen’s disciple.</p>
<p>I don’t know how I finally became convinced, but since her actions were always unstoppable, I would have realized soon enough. In any case, she must be older than me.</p>
<p>“I was disappointed that you didn’t even realize after all the hints I dropped.”</p>
<p>“If you’re a transmgirator, then.. why?”</p>
<p>“Why I’m still a villain?”</p>
<p>The dignified tone changed in an instant. It should have been her natural tone, but it seemed rather odd, to my surprise.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it because Julius is the protagonist?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the truth? Eventually, Julius… will become the emperor.”</p>
<p>Exchetra burst into laughter at my unequivocal statement.</p>
<p>I was appalled by the bright and cheerful appearance that I wasn’t used to seeing. It was artificial, making me even more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Ironically, her captivating and imposing demeanor seemed to be her true self.</p>
<p>“You should still do your best, don’t you think? Even if you transmigrated into the body of a villain and seek reform… will your fate really change?”</p>
<p>“It will change. I didn’t die…”</p>
<p>“That’s because you’re a supporting character.”</p>
<p>My body involuntarily shivered at her cold words. With no saliva to swallow, I awaited Exchetra’s next words.</p>
<p>“As you say, Julius is the protagonist, so he will become the emperor. My role is to create adversity and hardship in that process.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I knew you were foolish, but you… think so simplistically, it’s almost pitiful.”</p>
<p>“… What?”</p>
<p>“Do you believe that if Julius becomes emperor, the novel will end with a happy ending?” Exchetra smiled at the surprised look at my face.</p>
<p>“Here’s some more news for you, my dear. Even if the fates of side characters change, the main character’s destiny stays the same.”</p>
<p>Exchetra narrowed her eyes and reached her long fingers out. Her hand touched the iron bars, making lines as she spoke slowly.</p>
<p>“So, is your beloved master a star of the story, or is he just a supporting character?”</p>
