            <p><strong>Chapter 175</strong></p>
<p>However, a new problem came to my mind. It was clear that this plan was devised with the help of another transmigration. It was difficult to come up with such a plan without knowing Julius’ past, who supported him, as well as his personality in great detail.</p>
<p><em>‘Then, this plan must be for Julius to leave for Hoiore and fail in his quest…’</em></p>
<p>“Your Highness is still going to Hoiore despite knowing all of that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The people are waiting for help,” was his straightforward answer.</p>
<p>What a frustrating protagonist. Even with knowing what he would lose if he failed, he was willing to step into a place where neither telekinesis nor magic worked.</p>
<p>Gnawing on his lips, he looked back at Kaichen. By humbly accepting the situation, it meant that Julius had already been aware of it. If so, it meant the same for Kaichen.</p>
<p><em>‘Only me. It was only me who didn’t know.’</em></p>
<p>My sense of helplessness came rushing back. This mysterious snowstorm, the northern region where magic didn’t work. We were knowingly walking into a trap for the people enduring the cold and waiting for rescue without relief supplies.</p>
<p>‘<em>Because he’s a righteous protagonist…’</em></p>
<p>I tried to think. This rescue mission could not fail. Support for Julius came from the public. Without support from the public, his position would be shaken. Most of the nobles supported Princess Exchetra. The people knew her to be kind and benevolent. So, if the public’s support was lost, the scales of power would be tipped over to one side.</p>
<p><em>‘That can’t happen.’</em></p>
<p>Julius had to be the emperor. Just like in the novel I read, ‘Julius’ Tale of Becoming Emperor’.</p>
<p>Although I didn’t know how he became an emperor, Julius becoming one <em>had</em> to come true. As Kaichen helps Julius become emperor, I will stand by Kaichen’s side doing the same. Hiding in Kaichen’s shadow, inconspicuous as possible; that would be my first plan.</p>
<p><em>‘But we’ve been caught.’ </em>I had been discovered. Another transmigrator. Hiding was useless and trying to do so would only look ridiculous. My cowardice was laughable.</p>
<p>“Could you… explain a little bit more about the Hoiore situation?” I asked. It was no use lamenting over things that happened. I had to help somehow.</p>
<p>We were treated like chess pieces on the board. Our enemies must be arrogantly looking down at us from above, moving the chess pieces to their dance. My mind went cold as if I was hit by a violent snowstorm.</p>
<p>But no matter who the rival was, I had a hundred years’ worth of knowledge and experience. Above all else, being an <em>otaku</em> from my past life couldn’t be underestimated either. I’d also accumulated knowledge through several disaster films.</p>
<p>Desperately pulling myself together with clenched fists, I felt Kaichen sigh next to me. I ignored Kaichen, who was telling me to stay still through his eyes.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The northern lands of the Kalhai Empire were vast. The end of the northern region was full of icy mountains. Beyond that, wild people called ‘yetis’ lived there, who often invaded the south.</p>
<p>Hoiore, a city smaller than Acrab, was on the eastern end. The entire northern estate was also named such. Although it was called the Hoiore ‘territory’, there was only a small piece of land akin to a baron’s estate.</p>
<p>“Still, the entire northern region belongs to you, right?”</p>
<p>The Viscount of Hoiore, who had to fight the extreme cold, was a nobleman far from any power struggle in the capital. He had to protect the people and look out for yetis. Fortunately, the Empire sent relief supplies every winter in praise of Hoiore, who protected the border. They were not poor either, for they used herbs, animal fur, meat and bones found in their precious mountains as resources.</p>
<p>Even if the city was small, they had everything they could need.</p>
<p>It was also a place where mainly cold magic wizards were stationed, so it was strange that a situation like this had occurred. Thus, it was strange why no one knew anything until the communication was cut off and telekinesis stopped working.</p>
<p>What terrible situation could have happened?</p>
<p>With numerous thoughts, we gradually got closer to Hoiore. The closer we got to the city, the more I couldn’t open my eyes due to the worsening snowstorm. It came to the point, I couldn’t move my lips or my limbs and soon enough, my feet gave beneath me. Kaichen had to drag me along using a blanket as a sled.</p>
<p>“Ha, I’m embarrassed…” I mumbled.</p>
<p>Then I wondered, what was this blanket made of so that it didn’t even get wet? Why was it waterproof?</p>
<p>Without showing any signs of difficulty, Kaichen wrapped me in the blanket and tied it up tightly so I wouldn’t fall off. He dragged the blanket like a sled and would turn around occasionally to check on me.</p>
<p>I could hear Julius boisterous laughter. “This is really amazing! The Count really likes Kaichen, doesn’t she? She doesn’t want to be Kaichen’s disciple, does she?”</p>
<p>Julius’ teasing made my face flush in shame. It was because we didn’t look like lovers to anyone. I do like Kaichen! But what could I do? I couldn’t take a step further in this biting cold.</p>
<p>When I caught Kaichen’s gaze, who looked like he was feeling sorry for me, I felt so embarrassed that I wanted to hide in a mousehole.</p>
