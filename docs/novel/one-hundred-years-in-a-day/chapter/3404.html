            <p><strong>Chapter 119</strong></p>
<p>“Princess…,” whispered Asta. His face was buried into her neck. Akshetra felt his hardness and desperation in his voice. She stroked his hair.</p>
<p>“I told you, just do it. Don’t hold back.” Whenever they did this, Asta always asked for her permission even when she had already given it. He always asked her if he could. He always restrained himself even when their bodies were overlapped and heated. All his ministration of caressing, kissing and playing with his fingers were to widen her entrance to receive him. She was already familiar with him. Even when his member was hard and about to burst, he held back asking her for her permission.</p>
<p>He moved and positioned himself at her entrance. He entered her in one swift motion. “Aaaah, Hnng.” She felt fulfilled as his thick member filled her insides.</p>
<p>Asta groaned and loosened his arms around her waist. He lowered his body and raised her slightly. His eyes lowered to where they were joined. It was a l*wd sight. But his eyes always filled with worry at the sight and a hint of affection. He always made sure he was careful not to hurt his master. Akshetra hoped he would let go and move but she waited for him to be comfortable.</p>
<p>“Asta,” she whispered his name, trying to urge him on. His eyes slowly rose to look at her. His gaze was full of l*st.</p>
<p>“You can move now,” she said. Asta grabbed her thighs gently. Akshetra’s waist tightened with anticipation.</p>
<p>Asta’s emotions overflowed in his eyes. Akshetra smiled. This was the only place where Asta let down his guard and his defenses fell apart. Asta bit his lower lip and pushed his thick member inside her fiercely. When the tip hit her insides, she gasped and shuddered. She felt satisfied with this familiar feeling. Her waist quivered. His manh*od moved roughly inside her and slid out a little.</p>
<p>“Ohh, ahhh! Yes!” His blue eyes looked dreamy. She trembled with pleasure and the feeling of him inside her. Her lower body let out fluids to lubricate the entrance. A low m*an flowed from Asta’s lips. The sound made Akshetra ecstatic and it gave her strength.</p>
<p>“Ngghh!” he m*aned.</p>
<p>“Hah, Ahhh! Ahh!” Akshetra wrapped her legs around Asta’s waist and stretched out her hands. Asta leaned down and she wrapped her arms around his neck. As he dug deep into her, a feeling of pleasure overwhelmed her.</p>
<p>“Haa… Ahhh. Asta… harder! Harder!” She hugged him tight. Asta trembled. His movement became rougher. He shut his eyes as he moved. Beads of sweat dotted his skin.</p>
<p>“Ahh, Ahhh! Haaahhh!” Her whole body trembled in pleasure. She m*aned at the sensation of being pounded, veins bulged on Asta’s neck. His jaws stiffened. There was no way to slow down now. His thrusts increased in rhythm; their bodies crashed together. His face didn’t show much emotion but he wrinkled his forehead and clenched his teeth and gr*aned in pleasure.</p>
<p>Her relationship with Asta wasn’t in the original story. This relationship they had was entirely her own creation. Destiny flowed around Julius as he was the protagonist. She could do anything as long as it didn’t change the flow of the story around him.</p>
<p>Akshetra closed her eyes as her body headed towards climax. She thought of her future. If Dalia was a possessor like her and she managed to become a disciple to Kaichen, then perhaps she had a chance too. <em>Then the end of the novel probably might have changed. </em>She looked forward to meeting Dalia Alshine one day.</p>
<p>It is natural for time to flow. But there was a difference between knowing it and fighting for one’s goal rather than plunging into the fight unknowingly. Akshetra didn’t want to die. She wanted to be the emperor. The obvious ending was boring and unfair.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>“Princess… hahhh. Ahhh!” As though he knew her mind was wandering, his throbbing member thrust even harder. When she was about to climax, she called out his name.</p>
<p>“Asta! More! Ahhh!” As his manh*od pierced her, Akshetra let out a sweet m*an.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><strong>Two years later.</strong></p>
<p>Rattle— rattle— I was not used to the rattling of the carriage that shook vigorously, so I held back my vomit that threatened to erupt.</p>
