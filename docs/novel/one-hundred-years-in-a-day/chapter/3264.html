            <p><strong>Chapter 259</strong></p>
<p>“Wasn’t that story from two months ago? Anyone listening would think the Viscount stayed in the northern territories for three months,” Lamia replied with a beat.</p>
<p>“What happened in the North wasn’t a small matter. I lost track of time because I had much to study with my Master. Wizards don’t have much time on their hands.”</p>
<p>“… I’m concerned that Lord Kaichen is being bothered.” After saying that, Lamia sharply raised her eyebrows and, without waiting for permission, sat down across from me.</p>
<p>Beside Lamia, an heiress had also taken a seat. She seemed to be the rumored Dubonnet Tally from her demeanor and appearance.</p>
<p>The young ladies they had brought stood behind Lamia and Dubonnet like they were ready to fight, brandishing themselves like shields.</p>
<p>Perhaps because they were seated at the same table as them, Yanghwa, who was fervently focusing on her dessert, put down the fork she was holding.</p>
<p>It seemed dessert time was over.</p>
<p>‘Involving her might make things awkward,’ I thought, glancing at Yanghwa. My gaze shifted back to Lamia, who looked aggressive.</p>
<p>I wanted Yanghwa to enjoy and appreciate the Empire’s culture during this party. Getting her tangled in the fierce social battles of this society isn’t considered comfortable or enjoyable.</p>
<p>I glanced at her and subtly gestured for her to keep calm. It would be better if she was with Kaichen than here. But even though she understood my implied message, Yanghwa didn’t budge. Her smile remained wide.</p>
<p>“I have concerns that Lord Kaichen might not know the rules of the social world,” Lamia interrupted. “When attending a party, you should greet the social figures first.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Even in the social world, there’s a hierarchy. Given your late debut as a viscountess, you might not be familiar with it, but you do understand the distinction between superiors and subordinates, right?”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>
<p>“Or… could it be that you still don’t know who’s who in the social world?”</p>
<p>Lamia opened her fan with a snap and covered her mouth. It seemed like an action to hide a wicked smile.</p>
<p>Just say one word, please, Dalia. Just one word!</p>
<p>“Oh my, you forgot one more thing, Miss Sorel.”</p>
<p>“How could I forget? I need to compose myself. Hohoho!”</p>
<p>With an elegant gesture, Lamia extended her hand. She executed so well that if I didn’t know, I might’ve believed she genuinely forgot.</p>
<p>“There’s a social gathering at the Echo Salon once a month. It’s a time for light conversation and shopping over tea. Naturally, the youngest member of the social circle should organize it.”</p>
<p>Lamia and Dubonnet continued to converse with me, having a light exchange.</p>
<p>“Of course, the youngest one should cover all the costs for that day’s gathering. In Heulin, no noble who can’t host such a small-scale social event exists.”</p>
<p>“If a noble can’t even manage that, she doesn’t deserve to reside in Heulin, right?”</p>
<p>I blinked dumbfoundedly. Was this a play? No, it was more like a movie.</p>
<p>It felt akin to watching a film starring renowned actors receiving awards at the Academy ceremony. I was so astonished that my thoughts ceased.</p>
<p>In novels or comics, the heroine would triumph with splendid charisma in such situations. These scenes offered readers catharsis and exhilaration, leaving them satisfied.</p>
<p>‘I need to show that kind of attitude now…’</p>
<p>Whether in my past or present life, there were always those who divided people into ranks and acted like close-minded individuals.</p>
<p>I anticipated this would be even more pronounced in a hierarchical society like this. Even though Julius, the Crown Prince, behaves and speaks gracefully, I, on the other hand, kept stumbling. Lamia and Dubonnet’s attitudes, though scornful, appeared natural.</p>
<p>‘If those rules truly exist, it’s a bit bothersome.’</p>
<p>While trapped in time magic, I’d spent a hundred years experiencing unimaginable horrors. I’d tangled with the ruthless Princess Exchetra and witnessed Walter’s death firsthand in the North. Now, I tried to predict and prepare for the future while my heart ached for Yanghwa.</p>
<p>To me, “battle” meant that.</p>
<p>So when Lamia and Dubonnet made calculated gestures, taunting me with their banter, it didn’t feel like a “battle” at all. I had no energy. I almost felt apologetic.</p>
<p>“Are you capable of it? Surely, money isn’t an issue for the Countess. Oh, by the way, I heard you stayed in Heulin due to His Highness’s consideration. Was that indeed true?”</p>
<p>“No matter how impressive a mansion is, how could you stay there? It’s infamous, a place with a sinister reputation. They claim ghosts appear and such.”</p>
<p>“My, my! His Highness’s provision of such residence already displayed ample loyalty. Otherwise, would a rural lord dare come to Heulin?”</p>
<p>“Hohoho! Miss Sorel is correct. The Viscount’s territory lies far to the east of the Empire. It’s a dwelling solely for eccentrics.”</p>
<p>Laughter erupted, and the young ladies behind them joined in. What an audience! It was as though they followed a script individually.</p>
<p>Yet, letting this continue didn’t align with my temperament, and I felt apologetic to Yanghwa. I pondered how to respond.</p>
<p>I wanted to laugh it off or let it slide casually. This approach might work now, but it could exacerbate matters later. The original Lamia was a persistent character, after all.</p>
<p>Another option was to address Julius and Kaichen on my behalf firmly. However, this approach also had its drawbacks. Unintentional minor disputes could escalate into significant power struggles.</p>
<p>The Sorel Viscount was a faction supporting Princess Exchetra, so the chance of it spiraling into a major conflict was relatively high.</p>
