            <p><strong>Chapter 195</strong></p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>At the lips that briefly touched and left mine, a regretful <em>‘Is this the end?!’</em> burst out of me before I knew it. It was an innocent peck and not a <em>kiss..</em>. Of course, I couldn’t help but feel like it was a shame. When I slowly opened my eyes, I saw his gold eyes that were deeper than usual.</p>
<p>“Ah-”</p>
<p>My lips parted willingly. His hand roughly wrapped around the nape of my neck as his lips landed on my face a second time. This time, he was a little rougher than the first. Just like how a child tried sweet candy for the first time and begged for more, Kaichen was impatiently greedy for my lips. As if he didn’t know it would be this sweet.</p>
<p>A soft tongue pushed in between my lips and swept through my mouth. My body trembled as he wrapped and twisted his tongue around mine. It wasn’t a shy kiss of a child. The soft yet rough texture of his tongue felt insanely good. His movements were so passionate and wild that I wondered where that mournful person from a while ago went.</p>
<p>“Haa! Hmh…”</p>
<p>The sound of our kiss sounded l*wd. He tasted every corner of my mouth, as if he was going to swallow me up.  A strange moan escaped my lips. Before I knew it, I was grabbing onto his collar. My body felt warm. It trembled as Kaichen bit my lips.</p>
<p>“Ah… hnng-”</p>
<p>I felt a hand touching my cheek. It then went down to the nape of my neck. His hand that was caressing the back of my neck stopped at my collarbone. His rough, calloused fingers gently swept over my hard bones. My stomach shuddered at his touch.</p>
<p>I was crazy. This was really… There was no way I could become this excited from a kiss alone.</p>
<p>Kaichen didn’t even ask me why I cried, or what had happened there ever since I woke up. He was still keeping his promise to me from two years ago when I asked him to wait. He was ever silent and patient, even if I couldn’t tell him about the terrible things that had happened to me for a hundred years.</p>
<p>If it were me, what would it be like? What would I think if Kaichen was in pain, alone, and he didn’t tell me?</p>
<p><em>‘It’d be terrible…’ </em>I would’ve also hated myself for not being able to help the person I cared for.</p>
<p>I grabbed him by the collar and hugged him. my whole body was enveloped in his. His fingers touching my collarbone didn’t travel down further, but instead held my face again. He pressed himself to me tightly as he licked the sal!va from my lips.</p>
<p>His rough movements remained, as if they were trying to dig up a secret that I couldn’t confide anyone in. It was an unbelievably desperate and persistent kiss from Kaichen, who was usually cold and calm. Our lips interlocked and he repeatedly tasted the tip of my tongue. When I responded to his gestures in kind, the arms that were wrapped around my waist twitched and tightened.</p>
<p>His tongue delved deeper into mine to explore the inside of my mouth. I involuntarily made a sound.</p>
<p>“Hnng…”</p>
<p>My body twisted involuntarily as a m*an escaped me. It happened because I couldn’t stand the sensation in my lower stomach, and I ended up rubbing my body to his as I was held in his arms.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s lips finally pulled away. As I opened my trembling eyes, I saw his hesitant face. His bright, golden eyes were dark. A tremble passed through me with his eyes that were full of passion. It felt dizzying. I felt I could faint in his arms. The distance between us was so close that I could touch the tip of his nose.</p>
<p>“Haa… I… Master.” I exhaled hotly and spoke without avoiding his gaze. “What I said… just now. I want to change it a little.”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>Kaichen’s voice dropped extremely, making it several times lower than usual. My whole body trembled in response to his voice. I smiled bashfully as I looked into his eyes of blazing l*st.</p>
<p>“I’ll give my entire body and heart to Master.”</p>
<p><em>‘So, you can do whatever you want now.’</em> I wanted to say, but his eyes that were about to eat me whole stopped me.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>A heavy sigh escaped his lips that had been obsessively devouring mine a moment ago. He hugged my body tighter. My warm forehead touched his shoulder.</p>
<p>Kaichen buried his head at the crook of my neck and spoke dumbfoundedly, “Why on earth are you… Why on earth…”</p>
<p>There was a muffled sigh. His hot breath touched the skin on my neck. It might’ve been intentional, but even if it wasn’t, my heated body felt so stimulated that I trembled.</p>
<p>“Master…”</p>
<p>I called for him anxiously, but Kaichen didn’t kiss me as he did before. <em>‘You aren’t going to leave me alone after kissing me like that, are you?’</em> I felt terrible. It would be akin to confirming our relationship was just of a master and his pupil, nothing more.</p>
<p>As if he had noticed my fierce thoughts, Kaichen, who had his face buried in my shoulder, narrowed his eyes at me.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid?” he said.</p>
<p>“Of what?”</p>
<p>“… Don’t pretend you don’t know. How could you say something like that as if it’s nothing?’</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything terrible…” I said, licking my lips. “It was a once-in-a-lifetime confession. I didn’t want to let go of Master.”</p>
