<p><strong>Chapter 229</strong></p>
<p>With each touch, I became more and more aroused, my breathing quickening as he played with my n!pple. Normally, he would tease me until I begged for more, but tonight he seemed in a hurry, his mouth moving over my body with increasing urgency.</p>
<p>As he pushed down on my cl!t, I m*aned with pleasure, arching my back and reveling in the sensations he was creating.</p>
<p>Kaichen unzipped his pants and took out his member. My eyes widened at its size, which I still couldn’t get used to. He replaced his finger with his tip, and even with just a short amount of touching, I was already wet.</p>
<p>“Ma-master!” I exclaimed, but Kaichen ignored me as he stared at my face. He put one of my legs on his shoulder and took a heavy breath. With the sound of his teeth clenching, he inserted two fingers into me all at once.</p>
<p>I thought he would just get inside me immediately, but he couldn’t bear to hurt me so he held down his craving. He kissed my shivering thigh and bit it, leaving a mark. I shivered as Kaichen was so different from his usual self.</p>
<p>“Ha… Ma-master. Just why… are you so…. Ah! Hm!” I asked him, confused.</p>
<p>“I felt like, ha…. You could’ve become like that,” he replied.</p>
<p>“Ah, ha! What…! Are you…!” I didn’t understand what he meant by ‘like that woman’.</p>
<p>“Like that woman, ha. I thought you could’ve become like her,” he explained as he increased the number of fingers inside me to try and stretch me. Kaichen quickly fingered me as he spoke.</p>
<p>I realized he was talking about Yanghwa and imagining me like her. Yanghwa, who was under the influence of poison, reminded Kaichen of me when we first met. It wasn’t unfamiliar, but I didn’t think Kaichen would think like that.</p>
<p>If I wasn’t under the influence of poison, but under the influence of alcohol addiction or other drugs, my life would’ve been different. If I were doing drugs for a hundred years, even the Great Wiseman, Kaichen’s teacher, wouldn’t have been able to do anything. Kaichen probably thought of that and got scared.</p>
<p>As his member came in without warning, I took a deep breath. It was quite stiff as there wasn’t as much touching beforehand. “AH! Hut! Uh…..!” I cried out. The pen!s  that came in roughly stayed a bit as the inside was still quite narrow. Kaichen also frowned.</p>
<p>There was more pleasure than pain, but he had rushed it, so I couldn’t untighten my lower stomach. Kaichen seemed to notice that I was nervous, so he kissed the inside of my thigh. He slowly rubbed my clitoris again, which helped me ease up.</p>
<p>As I eased up, his head suddenly thrust itself in. “Ah! Hut!” I cried out, but he kept kissing my shivering thigh like he was trying to calm me. The wet sound was loud, but there were sparkles in my eyes.</p>
<p>“Ha… It’s so narrow,” he said, sounding like he decided to let his craving take over his sanity. He grabbed my thigh, pulled out his pen!s, and thrusted it in again. “Hut! Ah! …Ma-master, ah!” I m*aned out in pleasure.</p>
<p>“Just, ha, thinking about, whew, how you could’ve become like that… makes me angry,” he said, his thrusts getting rougher. It reminded me that s3x with him until now was done under his care.</p>
<p>Thanks to the position we were in, he was coming in so deep that it felt like electricity. I could feel the heat reach the top of my head. Normally, Kaichen would smile softly and tease me with his smile.</p>
<p>I couldn’t have guessed that his anxiety that I could’ve become like Yanghwa would make him explode like this.</p>
<p>It might be scaring Kaichen that it could possibly become my future. Thinking about this, it made me feel a bit sorry for Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Ah…! Master, ah…. Hm!”</p>
<p>I reached out. Even while he was going wild, my habit surfaces. I wanted to lock hands.</p>
<p>“I, I don’t like it…. Ah! This position…. is too much”</p>
<p>I wanted to hug him. As I looked at him longingly, his member that was coming in deep stopped. Hot matter filled inside me. He had came as I was asking him to hug me.</p>
<p>I brushed his hair and turned around with his penis inside me. He lowered the leg that was on his shoulder. The room was filled with the scent of passion and intimacy as he frowned and looked down at me.</p>
<p>“… Ha.”</p>
<p>He sighed and then covered his eyes. I got up and embraced him, almost m0aning with his manh00d still filling me up.</p>
<p>“I’m fine and I will be fine.”</p>
<p>He remained silent, and I slowly took his hand away from his eyes. As I held his hot hand hard, Kaichen kissed my cheek a few times and then hugged me tight.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for being so greedy and sleeping with you,’ he softly said.</p>
<p>“I also seduced you for my own desires, so it’s okay.”</p>
