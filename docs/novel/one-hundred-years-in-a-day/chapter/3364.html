            <p><strong>Chapter 159</strong></p>
<p><em>Of course… the original Dalia was supposed to be dead at this point. </em>Akshetra’s eyes made me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Haha! Sister,” interrupted Julius. “Countess Alshine only entered the social world today, so please give her a little rest.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s right. I am being inconsiderate.”</p>
<p>Julius had noticed me getting distressed and came to my rescue. Akshetra smiled at me and walked slowly towards the nobles who approached to greet her. I quietly bowed my head as she left.</p>
<p>“Please set aside some time for a proper conversation. Enjoy the rest of your time, Countess.” I stared blankly at the back of the princess Akshetra.</p>
<p>“My sister is very interested in you.”</p>
<p>“W-Why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know for sure, but I think it’s probably because you survived the forbidden magic. And the fact that you became Kaichen’s disciple. One way or another, you are at the center of the social world right now.”</p>
<p>I didn’t want to be at the center. Excessive attention is bound to lead to disaster. I just wanted to work and help by hiding in the shadow of Kaichen. However, becoming a disciple of Kaichen caught more attention than I had expected.</p>
<p>“The Princess… she is more charismatic than your Highness,” I couldn’t help but say.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I thought I was being crushed by the pressure.”</p>
<p>“Haha! Everyone who sees her for the first time says so. But I don’t really know.”</p>
<p>I trembled. I guess the main character is called the main character for a reason. Julius seemed very unaffected by the Princess.</p>
<p>“How about you teacher?” When I peeked at Kaichen standing beside me with an expressionless face, Julius smirked.</p>
<p>“Kaichen was about to start a fight right away, let alone be overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>All I could do was curl my tail and tremble. It felt a little unfair. But Julius was the one who would face Akshetra head-on, so it must be for the best. <em>I just need to be careful…</em></p>
<p>From afar, I watched Princess Akshetra greet the nobles, then glanced out of large window. The thrill of meeting with the villain hadn’t taken long but it already felt as though hours had passed. I sighed. Kaichen handed me a glass of orange juice. My mouth was dry after meeting Akshetra. I drank the juice in one large gulp.</p>
<p>“Shall we head back?” Kaichen asked again. Golden eyes, examining my complexion, made my tight lungs inflate again. It was as if I could breathe freely again, and my stiff body relaxed. <em>Ah, it’s those eyes…</em></p>
<p>“Teacher, I want to take a walk.” I led Kaichen out of the banquet hall and headed for the backyard. A completely different kind of nervousness enveloped my body now. It was so cold that my breath steamed. As soon as we entered the backyard, the air turned warm again.</p>
<p>Looking at the beautiful yellow rose garden in full bloom, I could see why Julius strongly recommended it. <em>It’s a really pretty place.</em></p>
<p>The yellow rose was not a very significant flower with meaning in the language of the flowers. However, it always reminded me of Kaichen. His warm golden eyes and hair. His brilliant gold aura and magic. They always reminded me of a golden rose. Kaichen’s house also had yellow rose bushes, and the willow tree also had yellow leaves. At sunset, yellow petals and willow leaves looked golden. So, I wanted to confess my feelings in the yellow rose garden that symbolized him to me.</p>
<p><em>He doesn’t particularly like yellow. It’s just that his magical power is similar to yellow, so he’s familiar with it. It’s okay though. It suits Teacher well. But… will it make him happy?</em></p>
<p>A yellow rose garden and flying rose petals. Between them Kaichen looked like a picturesque painting. Aside from the desire to make a memorable confession, I chose this place because I wanted to see him between the yellow roses. Even if the confession went downhill and I got rejected, I would still have a beautiful memory to hold on to.</p>
<p>As I walked silently through the rose garden, Kaichen sighed beside me and touched the robe he was wearing. I was curious about how it was locked all the way to the end of the neck without any buttons. But now I saw that it did have a button! The button looked like a small golden bean, so it was hard to see because it overlapped with the embroidery. Perhaps it was because the backyard, which was managed by magic, was hot and stuffy, he loosened the front of his robe. Unlike me, he had too much body heat.</p>
<p>Inside the robe, he was bare skinned. I couldn’t not hide my smile. I felt like a pervert with a very dirty mind. That said, Kaichen looked fabulous.</p>
<p>“Teacher, it seems that your body has improved a lot since you started practicing swordsmanship. You are like a sculpture now.”</p>
<p>“And I see you have become even more brazen to say such things without hesitation.”</p>
<p>“Huh, I’m being honest.”</p>
<p>“You should be embarrassed instead.” He swept away the bangs that covered his eyebrows. The weather was unbearable, and beads of sweat formed on his forehead. He was really sensitive to heat.</p>
