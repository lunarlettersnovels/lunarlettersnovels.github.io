            <p><strong>Chapter 197</strong></p>
<p>“Ah, w-wait! Ahh!”</p>
<p>The feeling of my sensitive peak taken by his hot mouth felt indescribably delicious. His soft tongue licked and circled my n!pples. My toes curled and I arched my back. My body twisted as I clutched the bedsheets, feeling dizzy from the stimulation.</p>
<p>“Hnng!”</p>
<p>Only one of my peaks was being stimulated. How cruel. My other n!pple was untouched, stiffening as if it was asking to be touched as well. I craved it. I wanted him to touch the other side too. He bade his time, knowing how well that would infuriate me.</p>
<p>I irritatingly reached out a hand to grab his wrist. I could feel his chuckle, but I couldn’t even feel embarrassed. My whole body was hot with anticipation that all rational thoughts had gone out of my mind.</p>
<p>His lips that had been biting, sucking and tormenting me, finally left. He cupped my mounds and massaged them. My bre@sts couldn’t fully fit in Kaichen’s large hands. My fleshy chest felt good in his hands.</p>
<p>He stared down at me. It felt like I was being caressed by his gaze. The next moment I could feel that my clothes were taken away and thrown onto the floor. My wet underwear had long been of no use.</p>
<p>“…M-master…”</p>
<p>I called out to him anxiously. My lower regions felt tingly. I was embarrassed at my body’s honest reaction that I couldn’t keep the confident attitude I had initially.</p>
<p>As I rubbed my legs together, Kaichen’s gaze that was fixed downwards, travelled up my body. His eyes were gleaming. A dark desire rose up within him. He leant down and slowly spread my legs open. This movement caused a sigh to come out of my lips.</p>
<p>“Haah… Master…”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>His voice uncharacteristically cracked as he answered.</p>
<p>“I feel… strange. It feels hot wherever you touch me…” I said with hooded eyes. Kaichen didn’t respond. “It’s strange… but I want more, and it’s so embarrassing…. I like it so much.”</p>
<p>It was obvious my brain had malfunctioned because of the heat. Otherwise, there was no way I would say such things under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Kaichen gritted his teeth and closed his eyes for a moment. Exhaling slowly, he reached out and peeled off the piece of clothing I had. I could feel his body tense and slightly trembling.</p>
<p>The vulnerability that I felt as I laid naked beneath him was overpowered by the intense anticipation for pleasure. I could feel my wetness slowly drip from my core at the knowledge of what was going to happen next.</p>
<p>As I laid there naked with my legs spread apart, Kaichen was still clothed.</p>
<p>“…You too.”</p>
<p>I reached out as I spoke. Kaichen understood my intentions immediately. He let out a short breath and roughly discarded his clothes. His solid, muscular body was a sight I had seen before, nevertheless, it elicited a thrilling sensation in my core. His tan skin and hard, sinewy muscles stood out. He had a beautiful body.</p>
<p>Who would dare say that this man was merely a powerful wizard?</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Kaichen’s eyes narrowed as he looked at me. When I saw his naked upper body, my mouth couldn’t help but water. I was shameless and he was torn between incredulity and self-control.</p>
<p>“Ha… you, really-”</p>
<p>Kaichen bursted into laughter and looked at me resignedly. As if at his wit’s end, he ran a hand through his hair. It was clear that he was holding back his intense desire as he looked down. His eyes were darker than usual. I heard the sound of his pants unbuckling. My eyes drifted to his sculpted abs. I felt the urge to touch it at least once. But then-</p>
<p><em>Gasp! </em>I closed my eyes tightly. I rubbed my eyes and opened them again. I covered my mouth with trembling hands and quickly closed my legs. Kaichen’s eyebrows twitched at the sudden change as he looked at me.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“No, er, I… see a snake.”</p>
<p>Kaichen remained silent.</p>
<p>“There’s no way. Woah! Am I too excited… I must be seeing things.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. I really must be seeing things. My disease may have returned. I bit my lower lip and glanced at his d!ck again. <em>Dear lord!</em></p>
<p>Kaichen was merely staring at me, patiently waiting for me to digest this scene. My eyes landed on his manhood. I wanted it to wilt under my gaze, but it stood proudly. There was no hallucination.</p>
<p>My eyes shook. I looked at him pleadingly. “Master… will I die today?”</p>
<p>Kaichen exhaled a long breath. “No.”</p>
<p>“Please save me.”</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>Kaichen slowly leaned towards me. He cradled my face as he pressed my thighs down with one hand. The tension put a strain on my legs, but the skin contact was fantastic.</p>
<p>“It was you who seduced me first…” he whispered, his voice low and barely controlled.</p>
<p>I gasped. “I must be going crazy…”</p>
<p>“You’ll be fine. I know your mind better than you do.”</p>
<p>“But… but, Master!” I looked up at him with pitiful eyes. “That… that’s too much! If it’s that big… I’ll die!”</p>
<p>“Shh, Dalia.”</p>
<p>Kaichen pecked my lips, but the devil was smirking as he did so. His lips tenderly kissed my earlobe and he whispered, “I wasn’t the only one who wanted it.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Am I the only one who wants to have <em>s*x?</em>”</p>
<p>He repeated, growling into my ear. My skin pricked. At his low, seductive voice, the excitement that had been dormant for a while grew tenfold.</p>
