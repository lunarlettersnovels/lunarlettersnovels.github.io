<p><strong>Chapter 70</strong></p>
<p>I spent a hundred years trapped in time magic accumulating mana. In the end my magic became closely related to time and became incompatible with teleportation magic. Writing down the complicated formula Kaichen had given me, I was determined to try once again. I gathered the magical energy that was condensed all over my body into my palm.</p>
<p>“Seems like your mana is like you,” Kaichen had once said.</p>
<p>“Is that a compliment?”</p>
<p>“Think of it as you please.”</p>
<p>“I’m asking because it didn’t sound like a compliment.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen this kind of mana before.”</p>
<p>“Is that a good thing or a bad thing?”</p>
<p>“Think about it on your own and decide.”</p>
<p>“I’m asking because I know very little.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to play with words.”</p>
<p>“Yes, teacher.”</p>
<p>Kaichen had warned me about showing my magic in front of others. He said they might take it as a form of black magic. When I asked the reason for it he got annoyed to do whatever I wanted if I wanted magicians surrounding and bullying me. I nodded and decided to listen to him.</p>
<p>“It is true that your mana was accumulated in a way that is completely different from ordinary people, but considering the state and location of a particular magic, your mana is likely to be specialized in time magic,” he had explained.</p>
<p>“I’m doomed. Time magic is forbidden magic!”</p>
<p>“That’s also true, but because of its opposite nature it’s not compatible with teleportation magic, so you won’t be able to use it.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, you specialize in teleportation magic, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“Then, if I just follow you, there will be no problem.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to use me as a means of transportation?”</p>
<p>“Me? You are treating your disciple too harshly.”</p>
<p>“You are not my disciple.”</p>
<p>I had smiled sweetly at him and he had turned away. But in the evening, he handed me the scroll for the teleportation magic. It seemed he did care about me in his own way. He might appear cold and indifferent all the time but his actions said the opposite. He was so adorable.</p>
<p>Anyway, I had gathered an enormous amount of mana in the hundred years, close to what ordinary magicians managed in their lifetime. The density of my mana was four times higher. There was a limitation of me not being able to use teleportation magic but there was also the fact that my magic specialized in tie magic. I knew only basic magic for now but I think it’s good considering I was a self-taught magician who did better than most.</p>
<p>I walked through the foggy garden at dawn to enjoy the cool and crisp morning air. The fresh air calmed my mind. It was a habit. Even at the willow house, I used to get up at dawn to take a walk. Willow House…</p>
<p>When I had first named Kaichen’s house as The Willow House, I had giggled. Kaichen had looked at me with disdain and asked how could I name other people’s houses as I pleased? Well, there was nothing else to call the house. Willow House fit right it. I felt very attached to that house to just call it ‘Kaichen’s House’ and I couldn’t very well call it ‘Our House’. Whenever I thought of his house as our house, my face heated up and I felt fluttery in my stomach.</p>
<p>Suddenly I imagined sitting next to him on the bench and I realized that I wouldn’t mind spending the rest of my life in that way.</p>
<p>“Have I gone crazy?” I shook my head. To spend the rest of my life with Kaichen who had the pickiest eating habits and sensitive personality?! But when I thought about the Willow House in the sunlight, it didn’t seem <em>that </em>implausible. I could imagine us sitting side by side on the bench and eating fruits and just talking.</p>
<p>“Aargh!” I felt all fluttery. I wondered if the withdrawal symptoms were back. Was I hallucinating again? I sat on the ben in the middle of the rose garden and took a deep breath to calm myself. I felt refreshed but I was still tingly with thoughts of Kaichen. <em>This isn’t the time to be thinking about things like that!</em></p>
<p>I looked up at the sky. It wasn’t going to lighten yet. I could still see the stars twinkling. Whenever I looked up at the sky full of stars in Willow House, I was wracked with guilt thinking about the citizens of Acrab. I always knew that I had to protect and repay them.</p>
<p>“One life per star.” I blinked. A star fell. I had never thought I would see a shooting star in the morning. But how was that possible?</p>
<p>“One life per star,” I muttered again and the stars poured down like a meteor shower. <em>What was even happening?!</em></p>
<p>“Are you kidding me?” I shouted up at the sky. I wondered if there was a god who was playing a prank on me. As though to mock me more, the stars continued dazzling up the sky in a meteor shower. I should have been happy and enchanted with something rare like this happening. But the only thing I could think of were the citizens of Acrab dying if I wasn’t able to come up with something to save them.</p></div>
