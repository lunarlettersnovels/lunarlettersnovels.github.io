            <h3><strong>Chapter 335</strong></h3>
<p>Julius looked skeptical, but my last remark elicited a begrudging smile. I chuckled, shook my head, and watched Julius go about his duties for the day.</p>
<p>It was a lighthearted exchange to alleviate the tension, but Julius and I were concerned about Kaichen.</p>
<p>The usual protective circle encompassed the vast Imperial Palace, including the Imperial Altar, each layered barrier serving a different purpose.</p>
<p>Kaichen maintained an ever-present protective magic on his body, and the same magic was engraved on my bracelet. Even the Imperial Palace Barrier relied on a magic circle crafted by Kaichen himself, sustained by his mana.</p>
<p>With over a dozen always-active spells fueled by his monstrous magical power, it was something we could never achieve alone.</p>
<p>Today, the barrier was confined to the Imperial Altar rather than the entire palace, making it thicker and more potent.</p>
<p>Though a wizard as formidable as Exchetra, capable of rivaling Kaichen, would likely notice the alteration, she couldn’t counteract it.</p>
<p>I stood amidst a sea of nobles, alone.</p>
<p>Hamal and the five Tenebres supposedly guarded the city of Heulin.</p>
<p>Other wizards from the Magic Association were stationed throughout Heulin, while Julius deployed his knights to maintain control.</p>
<p>Probably utilizing drugs, magical residues, and a concoction of poisons—ideal for combating the zombie hordes, likely addicted to such mixtures.</p>
<p>No one… was permitted to leave the city under any circumstances.</p>
<p>It was a sacrifice, but it was a decision to confine the situation to Heulin alone—a minor sacrifice for the greater good, as they say.</p>
<p>If asked about justice, there would be no definitive answer. However, Julius refused to sacrifice anyone unnecessarily.</p>
<p>It was natural for him to prioritize his people above all else. Yet, he made the choice he believed would minimize damage, perhaps even save the entire empire, even if it meant sacrificing the citizens of Heulin.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the sacrifice would be minimal.</p>
<p>There was no need to inquire about the toll this decision took on Julius. As a righteous and noble protagonist, he always wanted to save everyone.</p>
<p>Moreover, having already lost two people close to him, the decision must have crushed him, and he hadn’t properly healed yet.</p>
<p>I wanted to offer words of comfort, but I knew nothing I could say would ease his burden, so I remained silent.</p>
<p>My trail of thoughts was broken by the arrival of the heroine of the day.</p>
<p>Exchetra, draped in a sheer blue gown with a floor-length pale blue veil, glided toward the altar with measured steps.</p>
<p>Her movements were so silent it seemed as though she walked on air, with only the faint rustle of her veil and gown audible.</p>
<p>Though the veil obscured her face, the piercing gaze I felt as she passed by unmistakably belonged to Exchetra.</p>
<p>I had a sense she wore a wicked smile beneath the veil.</p>
<p>Her hands were not clasped together, and she walked with the poise of someone divinely guided.</p>
<p>It resembled a sacred ritual. She almost appeared saintly.</p>
<p>Despite her resemblance to a cockroach, her demeanor exuded elegance, and I reluctantly admitted that it suited her.</p>
<p>I resisted the urge to praise Exchetra, though my subconscious couldn’t help but admire her every move.</p>
<p>Gritting my teeth in frustration, I glared at Exchetra as she ascended the stairs, repeating to myself like a mantra that she was someone to be defeated.</p>
<p>Just when the climb seemed endless, she reached the summit.</p>
<p>My mouth was dry with nervousness, and I wiped my sweaty palms on my robes, clenching them into fists.</p>
<p>The once-clear and sunny sky began to cloud over. Slowly, I looked up, and the bright sun was enveloped in darkness.</p>
<p>It was a flawless total solar eclipse.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Observing Exchetra’s approach to the end of the altar, I couldn’t deny the nobility in her stance. Though her expression was hidden, her posture exuded natural dignity.</p>
<p>Despite bruising my pride, I had to concede—she was undeniably impressive.</p>
<p>I pondered why she had chosen the path of villainy. She could have been a great figure if she had aided Julius, even without being the emperor.</p>
<p>Or was her ambition solely focused on becoming emperor?</p>
<p><em>‘What drives someone from Korea to seek such power?’ </em>I thought, unaware of her past life and the experiences that fueled her greed.</p>
<p>The world grew darker by the moment.</p>
<p>I had never witnessed such a clear total solar eclipse in my two lives. The sight of the sun completely shrouded was both ominous and breathtaking.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a tremendous force shook the air. Its weight and malevolence were palpable, causing my breath to hitch as if someone had gripped my throat.</p>
<p>Though I lacked any special ability to detect magic, the monstrous mana was unmistakable even to me.</p>
