            <p><strong>Chapter 88</strong></p>
<p>Kaichen could probably maintain the barrier for a few weeks. He has grown even stronger than that incident years ago. Perhaps he could even maintain it longer. Thinking of Kaichen doing his best for me made me feel touched.</p>
<p>I wasn’t in a situation to be admiring kaichen but my stomach was fluttery. It was so reassuring having Kaichen on my side. I felt that I was safe as long as he was in Acrab. Kaichen had said so. He had said he would help me. He had said the people of Acrab would be okay too. I realized that I trusted him.</p>
<p>I wondered how long it had been since I had fainted. The day seemed to have passed quickly but I couldn’t be sure. My hands shook and my heart pounded. It was time for my medicine. I had it in my bag but I couldn’t risk showing the antidote to Antares. He must not know otherwise he might come up with another shitty poison to harm the people of Acrab.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he didn’t seem to have such a high opinion of me. Most likely he thought I was the same drunkard he had known before because he hadn’t taken away the bag at my waist. As I thought of ways to take my medicine without him knowing, a hand pulled me roughly and pushed me onto a chair.</p>
<p>“Ow!” I bumped my knee on something and a splitting pain travelled up my spine. The men didn’t care. They pulled my hand roughly behind and tied me to the chair. <em>Wait till I have an opportunity, I will make you all pay! </em>I seethed.</p>
<p>The pain didn’t faze me. I had been through countless types of pain, most of them I inflicted upon myself in those hundred years. But it still hurts. It’s funny how human bodies can go through so much pain and still feel pain.</p>
<p>“Can’t you at least be decent?” I complained. There was no response. Only sceptical glances. “Didn’t you take me with you because you needed me? If anything happens, I refuse to cooperate. Not like I will cooperate with you even now. You just lost your chance even further.”</p>
<p>Something slammed at the back of my head. I spat out and scowled. I was hit again. This time I felt dizzy. I decided that it was better to keep my mouth shut than be beaten to death. I decided to just stay still. If I had, maybe I wouldn’t have been hit.</p>
<p>I was worried but not scared. It wasn’t pleasant that my symptoms seemed to be returning without the medicine but Kaichen had said that I wouldn’t have those hallucinations anymore. I should trust his judgement. My hands were shaking and my head hurt. My eyes itched. But all in all, it was bearable. As long as there were no hallucinations, I could handle this. <em>Why does he want to kidnap me though? </em>I wondered. <em>What is he up to?</em></p>
<p>“Seems like you are not afraid.”</p>
<p>I licked my lips, pretending to be surprised at the familiar husky voice. “Oh, I am petrified. Can’t you see I am shaking? Are you going to kill me? You don’t have a grudge against me, do you?”</p>
<p>“Not against you but certainly against the man who is connected to you.”</p>
<p>“Who do you mean?”</p>
<p>“What is your relationship with Archmage Kaichen?” Antares asked. “I saw you walk hand in hand so don’t even try to deny it.”</p>
<p>So, he was watching us. Perhaps his men had been around, disguised and cursing us. But why does he care anyway?</p>
<p>“We don’t have any kind of relationship. At least not that I know of.”</p>
<p>“You expect me to believe that?”</p>
<p>“Well, to be completely honest, I have been trying to woo him because he looks kind of handsome.”</p>
<p>Antares looked at me doubtfully.</p>
<p>“It’s true!” I insisted. “He is my type, you know.” I had no idea what might be going on in the head of Antares but if I told him Kaichen had accepted me as his disciple. He would know I could use magic. That wouldn’t be good. I would lose any chance of freedom at all.</p>
<p>“So, I forced him to hold my hand. He is mad about magic, obsessed, if you ask me. He wanted to study me for the little stunt you pulled casting the forbidden magic in Acrab. So, I told him I would cooperate with his studies if he would hold my hand. He has mysophobia. Still, he obliged. Isn’t that amazing?” I smiled. “You saw the rest, if you were watching. He couldn’t stand it any longer so he disappeared. What did the relationship look like to you?”</p>
<p>I hope my lie works. I was grateful I could be so brazen. My imagination and shamelessly placed words might just help me escape. Who knew I could lie so convincingly?</p>
<p>“What’s so great about that man for you to be chasing him?”</p>
<p>“I told you, he is handsome. Just my type. He’s got a great body too. I peeked when he wasn’t looking.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Antares laughed. <em>Did he think I was crazy? </em>My head throbbed and I was just blabbering. It seemed I talked a lot when I was upset. But a lie with a little bit of truth can be very strong. It sounded sincere enough to me.</p>
<p>“How are you not crazy? All those who become mediums end up mad and useless.”</p>
<p>“Do I seem normal to you?”</p>
<p>Antares was quiet. I was waiting for him to respond. If I didn’t know what he was thinking, I couldn’t concoct more lies. “Tell me,” I urged. “Do I seem normal to you?”</p>
<p>“You certainly sound half-crazy to me.”</p>
