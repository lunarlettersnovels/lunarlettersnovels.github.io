            <h3>Chapter 349</h3>
<p>“I came because I was tired of waiting,” Dalia said.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Master, I was worried you might be hurt.”</p>
<p>“….You did… well.”</p>
<p>“What’s with that look?”</p>
<p>“…Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Ahh! You’ve ruined your handsome face.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry….”</p>
<p>“Did you wait long?”</p>
<p>He wanted to say no, but his mouth wouldn’t cooperate.</p>
<p>He should have said it was okay, that she did well breaking the time magic herself, and that he was proud of her. But his throat was tight.</p>
<p>Tears moistened her delicate shoulders. He barely managed to say, “Yes…”</p>
<p>He had waited a long time. Every day felt like he would really die. Every day without Dahlia was dreadful.</p>
<p>“Each day… felt like a hundred years.”</p>
<p>A cold hand wrapped around his waist and gently pushed his shoulder. He didn’t want the embrace to end, but his trembling body yearned for the face he missed so much.</p>
<p>Dalia was smiling, tears streaming down her face.</p>
<p>As if the Dalia in pain from his dreams were all fantasies, the Dalia in front of him smiled beautifully, soothing his heart.</p>
<p>The chilly hand gently wiped away the tears, soothing the burning heat on his cheeks. He didn’t know how much he had missed this touch.</p>
<p>He thought he would never see it again. He thought he had lost her.</p>
<p>Kaichen slowly closed his eyes. As if whispering to him like a dream, Dalia comforted him.</p>
<p>“Even though I’ve never lived a hundred years?”</p>
<p>Dalia, who joked about her pain, was braver and stronger than him. From the beginning, he wasn’t the savior. Dalia was the one who knew how to stand up on her own.</p>
<p>Rather, it was Kaichen himself who was saved by her strong spirit and warm heart.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah—Dalia, my Dalia.’</em></p>
<p>His tears streamed down from overflowing joy.</p>
<p>‘I’ll definitely say it soon. That your love makes me happy.’</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>After escaping from the time magic, I was startled to know six months had passed. I thought only a few days had gone by.</p>
<p>If I had just resigned and waited to be rescued, I would have met an old, motionless Kaichen.</p>
<p>After calming and consoling the crying Kaichen in the square, I returned to the mansion, where I had to comfort and reassure Angel and Mimi, who were weeping. And even had to awkwardly pat Baristan’s back, who was shedding tears at a very rare moment.</p>
<p>I laid Kaichen on the bed, who was almost like a corpse. He still couldn’t fall asleep easily. He tightly held my hand, seeming uneasy.</p>
<p>Eventually, I had to lie down next to him, holding him tightly in my arms. I patted him until relief and sleep took over.</p>
<p>I was also exhausted and had reached my limit. But there was much more to be done, and I tried to get up, but Kaichen held onto my waist tightly.</p>
<p>I missed his warm embrace, so I gave in and closed my eyes.</p>
<p>Feeling tired and with no strength in my body, I fell into a slumber, although some unease remained. Then, I had a strange dream.</p>
<p>A blue dragon about the length of my forearm was crying in front of me. Then, the dragon, which was dripping tears, sighed in pity and smiled happily when I petted it, which made me laugh.</p>
<p>Seeing it fluttering its wings like a fly made me laugh, and the blue dragon turned as red as if it had become a red dragon and even snorted.</p>
<p>We played like that for a while.</p>
<p>As I opened my eyes dimly, feeling like I was being judged by the dragon’s gaze. I felt annoyed and gave it a gentle tap, and it cried again as if wronged.</p>
<p>I tried to soothe it until it gave up. it pouted its long snout, stopped, and started pouting right in front of my eyes again. Although it was annoying, I felt like I had to look after it, so I played with it for a while longer.</p>
<p>The blue dragon, showing off its sparkling appearance, flapped its wings, wrapped its wrist around mine, and grinned.</p>
<p>I thought this was some kind of joke, but the blue dragon soon flew through the sky with a bright golden light and a happy smile.</p>
<p>Although I felt like something had slipped away, it wasn’t bad. I didn’t like seeing the blue dragon cry.</p>
<p>The dragon circled around me for a while, then flew up into the sky, emitting a brilliant light.</p>
<p>I reached out my hand without realizing it, but I couldn’t catch it. I felt refreshed because it wasn’t that bothersome anymore, but still, my nose tingled for some reason.</p>
<p>I felt that the blue dragon would not cry anymore. I don’t know what the twinkling light was, but I thought it wouldn’t be lonely because it was there.</p>
<p>‘I’m glad, young dragon. Thank God.’</p>
<p>I shouted towards the sky several times. I don’t really know what I’m glad about, but I kept saying it with tears in my eyes as if I had become the blue dragon myself.</p>
<p>When I awoke, my eyes were a bit damp.</p>
<p>Then I knew for sure. The protection given by the blue dragon had disappeared.</p>
<p><em>‘Has it found the remaining consciousness of the golden dragon…? They went up together. That must be it.’</em></p>
<p>I really don’t know the truth. Nevertheless, I decided to believe what I saw in my dream.</p>
