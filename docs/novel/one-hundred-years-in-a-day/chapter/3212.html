            <h3><strong>Chapter 312 – R.18</strong></h3>
<p>Dalia smirked lasciviously and ignored his comment. She stroked his pole a few times, then stuck her tongue out and licked his shaft.</p>
<p>All words of refusal went out the window. He sucked in a breath, shocked at her obscene behavior. The sight of her full, red lips and slick tongue licking her throbbing member left him speechless. His hair stood on its end.</p>
<p>Dalia nibbled at the prec1um on his shaft as she was savoring it. Her tongue flicked and licked her pole, teasing. Then, she slowly opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Stop. Dalia, don’t…”</p>
<p>It was hot. He was stunned. Her lips parted and swallowed his hard c0ck whol. She grimaced as if she couldn’t handle all his length, so she grabbed her member with one hand and dug her head deeper.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>His hands balled into fists at the dizzying stimulation. The wet, hot mouth felt similar and also very different from when he was inside her. Just the sight of Dalia on her knees, her face contorted in focus, forcibly swallowing his c0ck made him want to cu!m right then and there.</p>
<p>He felt my throbbing balls swell even more, and Dalia used her free hand to steady herself on his thigh. Her tongue moved lazily, wrapping around the head. She sucked lightly on it, making him twitch.</p>
<p>“Hmph… haah…”</p>
<p>He gritted my teeth, and her eyes were wide, examining his reaction. She couldn’t take him all to the root, so she gave him a disgruntled look and sucked him hard.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. The sensation of her squeezing lips on his c0ck melted him. His hands involuntarily wrapped around her bobbing head.</p>
<p>He had to be patient. Patient. Or else he would come.</p>
<p>But then her mouth made a wet sound, and she moved her head fast. With her lips around his length snuggly, Dalia bobbed up and down his shaft.</p>
<p>Naturally, he couldn’t have asked her to do this, but how could he have known she would kneel, suck him, and act as if it was delicious?</p>
<p><em>‘In her past life…’</em></p>
<p>Kacihen gritted his teeth. his jealousy of her other life, which he didn’t know about, threatened to explode.</p>
<p>Did she suck someone else the way she did now? He frowned. Even if she had, she was a different person then.</p>
<p>He knew that. But…</p>
<p>The hand stroking her hair gripped the back of her head firmly. Dalia flinched and lifted her eyes at him in question. She didn’t avert her eyes. He could tell she was feeling flirtatious, and the edges of her lips pulled into a smirk.</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted by her behavior. Her mouth was dripping with saliva that she couldn’t swallow. He wiped her cheeks, stroked her chin, and glared at her.</p>
<p>He had no intention of asking Dalia to suck his anyway. Not now, not ever. So he wanted to take advantage of the opportunity and watch her without missing a beat.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>The faster Dalia’s head moved, the more his stomach clenched. It felt insufficient. He wanted to shove it deep into her mouth roughly.</p>
<p>He could feel his member scrape across her lips and the roof of her mouth. Her cheeks puffed as he slowly pushed inside her. He could feel her teeth grazing his shaft, and his lower stomach would heat up with chills of pleasure.</p>
<p>When she licked and nibbled at his glans with her tongue, he gritted his teeth to gain a sense of control.</p>
<p>Dalia stared at his face as if to gauge his reaction. He wanted her to swallow his cu!m. It was a dirty, dirty desire.</p>
<p>He chewed his bottom lip as he endured, his waist twitching and his hands gripping his thighs. The corners of his mouth were stretched tight; it looked as if the slightest movement would tear them apart.</p>
<p>Dalia was beautiful. Hot and wet and making le!wd noises as she sucked on his c0ck. She was so pretty that he could forgive her for sucking clumsily.</p>
<p>He never thought someone would suck his pen!s. She was good at it, however clumsy. It wouldn’t feel this ecstatic otherwise.</p>
<p>“Ah… Ah…”</p>
<p>It felt so d@amn good.</p>
<p>He was jealous of the people who shared her body in her previous life, but he was also relieved that he was the only one with Dalia now. As Dalia pressed her lips together and sucked hard, he came inside her mouth.</p>
<p>“Mmmm……!”</p>
<p>He grabbed her cheeks and pushed her away, but she held on to his legs and wouldn’t let go of his throbbing, spurting c0ck.</p>
<p>Gulp-</p>
<p>“Dalia!”</p>
<p>He was startled by the loud swallowing sound that echoed through the bathroom, and this time she obeyed. Puck! She slid a finger between her parted lips. She swallowed about half of his cu!m and spat a small amount.</p>
<p>“Why the hell… would you swallow that!”</p>
<p>“I wanted to know what it tasted like.”</p>
<p>Kaichen rubbed her jaw, which was tingling. Dalia grinned sheepishly. He knew she was acting out of character, but he never thought she would go as far as to suck his c0ck and swallow his seed.</p>
