<p>When I reached back home, Kaichen was outside. “Teacher! Have you been waiting for me?” I asked brightly, partly teasing and partly wishing he had. I waved at him and jumped past the yellow rose bush.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you out too often these days?” he asked, displeased.</p>
<p>I thought I heard it wrong. I stopped waving at him. His voice was serious and dangerous. But I was confused. “What?”</p>
<p>“Are you studying at all?” he asked, “I am pretty sure I told you that there will be an exam tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Oh… that. Of course!” I said, “I finished reading them.”</p>
<p>“Reading alone isn’t enough,” he said, “I told you to memorize everything.”</p>
<p>“Of course! Don’t people memorize everything when they read it once?” I asked, now confused more than ever.</p>
<p>Kaichen looked shocked and amazed. He was definitely thinking, <em>you have that kind of ability? </em>I realized most people didn’t really memorize everything they read just once.</p>
<p>“I told you,” I said, “most teachers would have gotten jealous except you.” I winked at Kaichen. He scowled. I didn’t think he liked the way I had complimented him. “Are you worried that I keep going out?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing like that.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you hanging out here?”</p>
<p>Kaichen seemed embarrassed. Perhaps he had no explanation, or he didn’t want to voice it out loud. I guessed he hadn’t expected me to ask so bluntly.</p>
<p>I held my laughter and patted my bag. “I have made something really nice,” I said, “I was going to show you when I was done setting it up but it’s still good that you are here.” I decided not to push him further for an explanation on why he was out in the yard. I doubted he would obligingly answer anyway. He might just get irritated.</p>
<p>“Please give me a moment,” I said, and ran into the house to fetch a knife and a plate. Kaichen’s gaze followed me. I ignored it and approached the willow tree near the pond. A stray yellow willow leaf swayed in the wind. The view was so beautiful. The yellow color of the leaves painted everything gold. Kaichen’s house as a whole and the area around it was very dazzling. Yellow trees, yellow rose bushes…</p>
<p>There was also a red wizard’s cape that had beautiful gold embroidery on the hood. I have never seen Kaichen wear it. <em>He seems to like golden colored things… a lot. </em>Kaichen’s mana was golden, too. His golden hair and golden eyes distinguished him. Everything about him was as precious as gold.</p>
<p>I took the bench out of my magic bag. I didn’t forget to cast ‘lightweight’ magic on the bench otherwise it would be too heavy to lift. In woodworking, Hanmer had helped me, and I avoided telling him that I could do it myself because I didn’t want to reveal myself as Kaichen’s student. It would have caused too much ruckus. But right now, right here, I had no such qualms.</p>
<p>I lifted the bench and put it down by the willow tree. I had trimmed the space under the willow-tree to get rid of the wild bushes and to make the ground even.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” asked Kaichen.</p>
<p>I had already measured the place right next to the pond. The bench fit there perfectly. “It’s a bench.” I said. “You can sit here, eat delicious food, take a nap, or just rest…”</p>
<p>Kaichen looked disapprovingly at me as if I had disobeyed his orders. I dusted the bench and sat there. “It’s a beautiful place,” I said, “Besides, if you sit here, you can even feed your ducks while you relax.”</p>
<p>Kaichen raised his eyebrows. I knew very well how much he cared about those ducks.</p>
<p>“I read in the book that if you become one with nature, you can gather more magic,” I said.</p>
<p>“It definitely is easier to use magic that way,” he said.</p>
<p>“Same thing…”</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>He looked interested in explaining more but wanted to uphold his aloof demeanor. I could see he was having trouble doing that.</p>
<p>“Oh, just come on. Sit here,” I said and pulled at the hem of his robe. “Sometimes, it’s okay to relax and rest.”</p>
<p>If he wanted to, he could have resisted but he sat beside me. <em>He wanted to sit here. </em>He wanted to act all cold and distant from the outside, but internally, he wanted something else. I couldn’t help but smile a little.</p>
<p>I took the plate I had brought from inside the house and placed it beside me on the bench. I took out a siron out of my bag. It was heavy but I had again used the lightweight magic on it.</p>
<p>“Did you use lightweight magic for that too?” asked Kaichen.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well… lightweight magic is usually used for construction purposes. You know… to move large rocks and things.”</p>
<p>“I know,” I said, “But if I am not wrong, it is also the basic magic that one learns after learning to gather mana.”</p></div>
