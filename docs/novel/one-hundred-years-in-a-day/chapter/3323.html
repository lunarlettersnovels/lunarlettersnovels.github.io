            <p><strong>Chapter 200</strong></p>
<p>I felt emptiness before he strongly pushed inside me at once. The moment he started thrusted in and out of me, my mouth hung open as I drew in a long breath.</p>
<p>“I.. haa… definitely asked you to – Hng!”</p>
<p>“Ahh! Ha… ah! Ack!”</p>
<p>Kaichen said something incoherently, but I could only respond in m*ans. The sound of his skin hitting mine overlapped with the sound of my flowing wetness. It sounded scandalous, but I couldn’t care less. It felt amazing.</p>
<p>Kaichen leaned forward with one arm on the mattress and the other held my thigh. He was breathing heavily as he repeatedly slammed in and out of me.  His brows were drawn together; his face a picture of concentration as he roughly pounded into me that I was left breathless. I could see just how patient he had tried to be. He was considerate until the very end. Even after sheathing himself all the way in, he stayed still, waiting for me to get used to his large size.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my hands grabbed and twisted the sheets as I felt immense pleasure through my entire body overcoming the pain from earlier. I couldn’t think of anything but the sensation of our bodies joined together.</p>
<p>In my haze, I suddenly wonder:<em> ‘was s*x always this amazing?’</em></p>
<p>His hot body dripped with sweat, and his length was being coated in our wetness as he moved. My insides that had a difficult time accepting him first was now squirming and constricting his length in, as if it couldn’t bear to part with him.</p>
<p>“Ahh…! Ahh! Mhm!!”</p>
<p>Wild m*ans came out of my mouth that made me wonder if it was really my voice. As my voice grew louder, Kaichen’s movements grew rougher. There was only the sounds of our wet nether regions slapping against each other and the sighs and m*ans that came out of our mouths.</p>
<p>My toes curled and my lower belly tingled. It felt too much. Kaichen persistently hit a pleasurable spot inside me where he had stimulated with his fingers before. Just as I was about to forget breathing, he halted his rough movements and went painfully  slow.</p>
<p>I felt like I was going to go insane. Was it possible to die in pure ecstasy?</p>
<p>I hadn’t noticed that my mouth had long fallen open, or that I was squirming beneath him, my body asking for more and more.</p>
<p>“Haa… Dalia… Dalia.”</p>
<p>Kaichen’s low voice called to me. I slightly teared up as pain and pleasure intermingled and I was overwhelmed by the sensations. And yet, I didn’t want him to stop. The sound of his body slapping against mine and our joined lower regions creating er*tic sounds felt wonderful.</p>
<p>I was drowning in pleasure to the point that I felt my soul leave my body when suddenly, a thrilling feeling gathered in my lower belly and washed over my entire body.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah! Huhh… Kaichen!”</p>
<p>My hands reached out towards his forearms, clawing at him. Climax came at me like an electrocution. My back arched, my fingers and toes curled and my thighs and inner walls tightened around him. In response, Kaichen’s lower abdomen throbbed and he spread my legs farther to pound deeply into me.</p>
<p>Kaichen drew in a breath as he trembled. He didn’t anticipate the pleasure when I suddenly tightened around him, and not able to hold it much longer, he came shortly after me. His seed spilled inside me and at the end of his climax his thrusts turned shallow and slow.</p>
<p>His blurry eyes were now focusing on me, as if reason finally returned to him. Breathing hard, he leaned down towards me as my eyes started to droop.</p>
<p>“… I’m sorry,” he suddenly said.</p>
<p><em>‘You have nothing to be sorry about.’</em> I wanted to say that, but I didn’t have the energy to move my lips.</p>
<p>My body was still recovering. Kaichen was worried about that from the very beginning. I was the one who owed him apology, since I cheekily encouraged him. He reached out to wipe some of my tears away and he tenderly kissed me under my eyes, right on my mole.</p>
<p>“What you said… everything,” he said. I looked at him confusedly. When I remained silent, he continued, “I can’t refuse you. Even so, I should’ve held it in.”</p>
<p>He brushed my cheek. He was regretful that he wasn’t able to hold back, but his eyes told another story… It seems like this man wasn’t still satisfied after just one round!</p>
<p>“…Ah…”</p>
<p>As if my thoughts were proven true, I felt his pillar throb and grow once more. I looked at him owlishly, almost in panic.</p>
<p>“Master, it’s me who’s sorry.”</p>
<p>I quickly begged for forgiveness with a hoarse voice. Kaichen merely smirked in reply. He lightly kissed my lips as he slowly pulled out. I sighed as he pulled out, and I could feel a considerable amount of fluid flow out.</p>
<p>“I will only feel sorry once for a sick person.”</p>
<p>After he spoke, Kaichen turned away from me, as if to reign his temptations in. Guilt weighed heavily on my chest. It was me who seduced and instigated him, but after doing it once, I ran away with my tail between my legs.</p>
<p>My stamina, which was usually bad, was even worse now. My limp body didn’t even have the strength to lift a finger. I wasn’t even certain about the future.</p>
<p>While I was contemplating, Kaichen threw his pants on and went to the attached bathroom. I wanted to get up and put something on, feeling embarrassed to be lying naked on the bed, but I had no energy to move, and I just blinked at the ceiling.</p>
