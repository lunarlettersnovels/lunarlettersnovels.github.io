            <p><strong>Chapter 109</strong></p>
<p>A few days later, Kaichen arrived at the palace. After exchanging greetings (mostly by Julius) and a curt nod from Kaichen, they headed to the Rodren castle where the princess stayed. It was by far the most impressive part of the palace.</p>
<p>When they entered the garden, a strong scent tickled their noses. The colourful and dazzling snapdragons clustered around the palace. Julius was familiar with this so he passed by without a thought. Meanwhile Kaichen sighed at the unfamiliar scenery.</p>
<p>“Is the princess colour blind?” He asked. He pressed his temple and walked along.</p>
<p>Julius didn’t say anything. He hoped the princess wouldn’t hear of this.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. But maybe she likes it like this. With too many colours.”</p>
<p>Kaichen had asked it without malice. He was genuinely curious. The bombardment of colours in the garden really left anyone reeling. After passing the colourful garden, they were escorted by a maid into the drawing room, where Princess Akshetra was already waiting.</p>
<p>The drawing room was entirely made of glass with a view of the garden outside. Kaichen grimaced but restrained himself from showing his dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>“I greet the imperial princess,” said Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Sister, how have you been?” asked Julius. She hadn’t turned around to look at them even when she knew they had entered the drawing room. She looked so beautiful that she was almost inhuman.</p>
<p>“You must be busy and yet you came by to greet me,” said Akshetra. She meant it. She had thought only Kaichen was coming to see her. She hadn’t known Julius would have accompanied him.</p>
<p>Julius smiled and sat down on the sofa. “I came because Kaichen is very shy,” he said. “I accompanied him so that his shyness wouldn’t be taken as rudeness. Would that be a problem?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” said Princess Akshetra. “You are always welcome. I know that you both have learnt under the same teacher and grew up together. You are practically brothers, isn’t that true?”</p>
<p>Julius smiled politely. But he knew she meant it as a mockery of him who had grown up outside of the palace. He was an outsider. Akshetra was very talented at making an insult seem like a compliment. And Julius had believed that for the longest time. He had looked up to her as a kind sister who accepted and welcomed him. It didn’t take long before that illusion broke.</p>
<p>“Julius said you wanted to see me?” She turned to Kaichen.</p>
<p>Kaichen’s title demanded respect. No matter how powerful one was, everyone treaded carefully when conversing with Kaichen. No one spoke to him as informally as the Princess had just done. Even the emperor was afraid of Kaichen and what it would mean for him to pick a fight with the Archmage. Julius was amazed at Akshetra. She was a woman afraid of nobody. She indeed was born to be a monarch.</p>
<p>“I will not tarry around. I know everything.” Kaichen didn’t beat around the bush as usual. He was curt and straightforward. “I hope you will stop at this. There is no need to drag this forward.”</p>
<p>Akshetra raised the corners of her lips in a smile. That smile sent a chill down Julius’ back.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand. What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Kaichen was calm. “I know about Acrab.”</p>
<p>Akshetra’s smile deepened. Julius instantly regretted accompanying Kaichen.</p>
<p>“Are you talking about the epidemic?” asked Akshetra. “Or, are you talking about the fact that you almost incited a fight against the Imperial family?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t exactly a fight,” said Kaichen. “I had no such intention. But I realized that the decision of the Imperial family to send knights to slaughter innocent people wasn’t a very diplomatic move as well.”</p>
<p>“And are you qualified enough to point fingers at the Imperial family?”</p>
<p>“The people have the right to speak,” said Kaichen. “And as rulers, the Imperial family must listen to the voice of the people they govern. But is the Imperial family really listening?”</p>
<p>“You do know there will be no end if you start listening to every little thing that people ask of you?”</p>
<p>“I think as leaders, that is a ridiculous thing to say,” said Kaichen. “The point is not about where things begin and end. I guess you already know and admit that the Imperial family’s decision here is not feasible. You must already be aware that there is no epidemic in Acrab.”</p>
<p>They looked at each other unwaveringly. Either of them not wanting to back down. Kaichen was calm and collected. Julius sat awkwardly between this battle of wits. But he knew that Kaichen had won this particular battle.</p>
<p>“Indeed, everyone deserves praise. You… what a waste.”</p>
<p>Julius flinched and looked at Akshetra.</p>
