            <h3><strong>Chapter 332</strong></h3>
<p>“Dalia?”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>I exclaimed, startled by the touch on my shoulder. Kaichen, who looked even more surprised than me, quickly arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>My heart skipped a beat. I was heavily distracted and lost in thought again. The scenery was unfamiliar. I had gotten out of the carriage and was walking along with Kaichen, lost in my thoughts.</p>
<p>Kaichen brushed my hair back. His face looked worried.</p>
<p>This is my fault. On such an important and anxiety-inducing day, I was more distracted than usual. I keep my head down, unable to make eye contact, and I hear a heavy sigh from above me.</p>
<p>I felt bad for making Kaichen worry when he already had a lot to think about. He’s got enough on his plate today, even without me.</p>
<p>I sighed. My mind and body were moving completely out of control.</p>
<p>Kaichen grabbed my wrist and pulled me to walk with him. His long legs stretched out before him as he walked, dragging me along. I had to walk fast to keep up with him.</p>
<p>I wanted to complain, but the sight of Kaichen’s broad back and his stature made me realize he was slightly angry.</p>
<p>The tip of my nose tingled as I looked at the red badge attached to his fluttering robe.</p>
<p>Oh, what am I doing?</p>
<p>The garden looked like something out of a movie. The plants were taller than a person. I felt like I was in a maze.</p>
<p>“Dalia, if you have something to say, say it.”</p>
<p>Kaichen, who had dragged me there, spoke fiercely as he tightened his grip on my wrist. His brow furrowed, and his lips set in a straight line, proving his anger.</p>
<p>I could tell by how he was squeezing my wrist, something he wouldn’t normally or couldn’t do. It hurt, but for some reason, it felt strangely reassuring right now.</p>
<p>“I, uh… I don’t really have anything to say.”</p>
<p>One of Kaichen’s eyebrows shot up as I blurted out the words. His intense eyes stared at me as if they could pierce through me.</p>
<p>My heart sank, until finally I raised a white flag. With just one look from Kaichen, I crumbled.</p>
<p>“Do it.”</p>
<p>It was a command.</p>
<p>Kaichen was a man who knew how to be affectionate with cold words that sounded like commands. So I guess what he wanted to say was: “If you’re worried about something today, I want you to tell me about it.”</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, that’s pretty… warm. This man is—</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>He said my name urgently. His voice was thick and low, and there was a hint of impatience in it that I recognized.</p>
<p>My tingling wrist still hurt. Slowly, I raised my head and found him staring at me, his eyes filled with worry and impatience.</p>
<p>“I’m scared.”</p>
<p>I blurted out the answer slowly, my mind racing with all sorts of thoughts. “So much that I thought I’d rather be trapped in Time Magic with you, Master.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Because then I wouldn’t have to lose you.”</p>
<p>“Dalia…”</p>
<p>“You would call my name every day.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Even if… has no future.”</p>
<p>I’m terrified of losing you that much.</p>
<p>I squeezed my heart. I feel hollow like there’s a hole in my chest.</p>
<p>At my words, Kaichen released his grip on my wrist. His fingertips trembled slightly at the red marks left behind.  It wasn’t painful; it only slightly tingled. He didn’t use enough force to hurt me. The marks were there because I have very fair skin.</p>
<p>“The truth is, I’m not a very nice person.,” I continued.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t mind if everyone in Heulin died. It will be shocking, but you will be <em>safe</em>.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I don’t care as long as <em>my</em> people are okay. I’m a selfish person. You know it, Master. I’m a terrible  person who has done some very cruel things, even if they never happened.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But being good doesn’t make my sins go away. Oh, it makes me feel less guilty, but it doesn’t erase the sins I committed,” I looked at him solemnly.</p>
<p>“I feel like… the sins I committed are coming back to haunt me now.”</p>
<p>I pretended to be okay, to understand, but it was far from that. It wasn’t okay, and I didn’t understand.</p>
