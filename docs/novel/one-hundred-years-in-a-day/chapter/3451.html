            <p><strong>Chapter 72</strong></p>
<p>I never thought the day would come when I saw him smile like this. It was a smile without any worries, without limit. It was warm and golden just like the sun shining on my back. It was more enchanting than the meteor shower I had seen. It illuminated everything around him.</p>
<p>My face heated up and my heart pounded. I swallowed. My lips were dry. My stomach was fluttering. I almost panicked. Was this a hallucination? But I took my medicine.</p>
<p>“Dalia, remember that I am by your side,” he said. I was speechless. “Answer me,” he said again, looking at me with that sweet smile.</p>
<p>I managed to nod. “A teacher doesn’t use honorifics with a disciple,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I croaked out.</p>
<p>“A teacher will ask you to do a lot of things and he expects obedience.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“And… the disciple shouldn’t keep a secret from their teacher.”</p>
<p>I stopped. I looked at him. But he looked back calmly. The smile was gone. I thought it was an illusion created by my deranged brain.</p>
<p>“Dalia…,” he urged.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Kaichen held my wrist comfortingly. “No secrets,” he said, “What did you do in Acrab when you were trapped in the time magic?”</p>
<p>His voice was gentle and calm. It wasn’t a question to force an answer out of you. It was just a tentative and gentle nudge. I could listen to his voice all day and all night. It made me want to blurt everything out. I wanted to be heard. I wondered if Archmage Kaichen imbued his voice with magic. Was he doing it now?</p>
<p>He looked at me unwaveringly. “Dalia?”</p>
<p>“Yes, teacher.”</p>
<p>“Tell me,” he said gently.</p>
<p>“Well, I… learnt magic and read books. I also learnt some production techniques for…”</p>
<p>“Not that.” He didn’t speak any formal language. It seemed he was going to abide by his words to speak informally to me. In other circumstances, that would have made me happy.</p>
<p>“Tell me what is making you suffer so much, “he asked.</p>
<p>“I… there is no such thing.”</p>
<p>“Dalia, no secrets.”</p>
<p>His hands tightened a little on my wrist. I frowned and looked down. He loosened his grip on my wrist as though he hadn’t known what he was doing. He didn’t want to cause me pain. He wanted to know what happened to help me.</p>
<p>I looked at him and wondered how I could escape from this situation. <em>D*mn, I wasn’t prepared! I didn’t mean to be swayed by his smile. </em>I had imagined that after being accepted as a disciple, I could learn some magic, hide away and live a peaceful life. But… Kaichen was adamant. He usually didn’t show any interest whatsoever towards anyone. This was… surprising, to say the least.</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” I squeaked. <em>Why are you calling me so sweetly? </em>Should I just tell him? I debated with myself. My heart pounded. I wanted to tell him but at the same time I couldn’t. I felt very distressed. I wanted to pour everything and lean on him but…</p>
<p>“What’s making you suffer?” Kaichen asked again. I knew he wouldn’t back down until he got an answer.</p>
<p>I sighed. ‘Teacher… is it okay if I take some time to think?”</p>
<p>Kaichen raised those d*mned eyebrows again. “I just need time to prepare myself to confess my secret to you.”</p>
<p>Kaichen waited silently. I couldn’t look at him. I wondered what was going in his mind. <em>Was he angry? </em>Although I lowered my head, I could still feel his gaze on me. His golden eyes blazed. I counted to seven in my mind waiting for him to let it go. I wanted to wriggle and run off from here. In my defense, how many people could escape from the Archmage once you had caught his attention? None, that was the answer.</p>
<p>I glanced at my other hand, the one he wasn’t holding. I could see the delicate golden bracelet properly for the first time. I didn’t know what it would represent. These bracelets. But it was said that when a magician accepted a disciple, they would offer a token as proof. I wondered if this was the token. Does this prove that I am the first official disciple of Archmage Kaichen?</p>
<p>“And if I wait?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“If I wait patiently, will you be able to tell me your secret someday?” His voice was calm. I hadn’t thought about it. I had just blurted it out because I felt backed into a corner. It had ended up being a promise.</p>
<p>“I… want to do that,” I murmured and realized it to be true. I did want to share my secret with him, in my own time. “I too hope that a day will come when I can tell you everything.”</p>
<p>I was always thrown off-guard with Kaichen. Whenever he spoke softly to me and his clear golden eyes shone warmly, I lost my head. I became weak. “Um… teacher? How long are you going to hold my hand? I am a little shy….” Kaichen let go of my hand, frowning.</p>
<p>“So, you do know how to be shy.” He returned to his usual grumbling self. His slightly reddened ears and his eyes made him look even more adorable. It tugged at my heart.</p>
