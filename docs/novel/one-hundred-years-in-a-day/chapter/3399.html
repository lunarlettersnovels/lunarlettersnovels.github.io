<p><strong>Chapter 124</strong></p>
<p>“I don’t mind your suggestion that I might have need of it in the future,” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh….” I burst out laughing. Kaichen’s lips twitched and he flicked a finger at my forehead. I was smiling like a fool.</p>
<p>“Rather than thinking about a wand for me, think about what kind of wand you would use.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Kaichen. “I think it’s time for you to have a wand.”</p>
<p>I had never thought about making a wand. “I haven’t really thought about it. It might be difficult to carry around every time,” I said.</p>
<p>“You can make it just big enough to fit in your pocket.”</p>
<p>“But then that would look boring!”</p>
<p>“Do you think magic wands are for fun?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean it that way.”</p>
<p>“It’s not something you can make in any way you want. It is formed according to an individual’s aptitude.”</p>
<p>I smiled and removed his hand which still covered my face. “Is that why the Crown Prince’s wand is a sword?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Mana represents a person. So, the wand is formed according to that.”</p>
<p>I almost laughed at his words. That meant his heart was as pure as the yellow rose which hadn’t bloomed yet. Does that mean his golden magic is pure as well? His wand was also said to be very large and heavy. It seemed as if things that are really pure are never really light. And now his wand was broken and he was empty-handed.</p>
<p>“Then, teacher, let’s make it together!” I could make it now since I could control my mana on my own. And Kaichen had broken his. He needed to teach me to make a wand anyway, so it wasn’t a bad idea to make it together.</p>
<p>“No,” said Kaichen abruptly.</p>
<p>“What? Why?” I hadn’t expected him to refuse outright. I pouted and grabbed the hem of his robe.</p>
<p>“It’s bothersome.”</p>
<p>“Stop saying it’s bothersome and make a wand with me. Yes?” Looking up at him, I pleaded. Kaichen clicked his tongue and turned his head away. I could see his bronze skin reddening. He was always weak to my suggestions. He still hated interacting too much with people, but I was always his exception. I noticed that a year later than we met.</p>
<p>He didn’t get angry or annoyed at me for touching him directly. It didn’t matter even when he was in a messy place. Kaichen seemed like someone who cared for his disciple more than expected of him. He certainly seemed like the type of person who likes to take care of others. Was that why he didn’t mind cleaning after Julius? Maybe that’s why he didn’t want to have a disciple before.</p>
<p>“Mr. Kaichen! Everything is ready!” Mimi came running just when Kaichen was going to say something.</p>
<p>I did not get an answer from him as Mimi came over running and sweaty. I could always ask later. When we reach the capital city, Heulin, I will be able to spend more time with Kaichen. Thinking about that, I let go of the hem of his robe.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Imperial Capital Heulin. It was a huge city full of historical buildings of the Kalhai Empire as well as considered the headquarters of all important associations. It was a city that was aptly called- ‘heart of the empire’. So, it was obviously a residential area for powerful nobles. I would have wondered about how they managed their own estate while they stayed here, but something similar had happened to me. So, now I know.</p>
<p><em>“If I leave, who will manage Acrab?”</em></p>
<p><em>“You can just hire someone and put them in charge. Is Acrab suffering from a manpower shortage to such an extent that it cannot hire someone like that?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, it’s nothing like that. But…”</em></p>
<p><em>“You can leave someone in charge and check the important documents yourself using transfer magic. It is expensive, but you can also have a teleportation magic circle installed to come and go.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Is that …what everyone does?”</em></p>
<p><em>“All the nobles living in Heulin are like that.”</em></p>
<p>Julius had not laughed at me but he had looked at me pitifully and explained the system of leaving a deputy in charge. He occasionally glanced at Kaichen standing silently next to him as though wondering what Kaichen was teaching me if I didn’t even know this much. So, I had entrusted the management of Acrab to the vice president of the Acrab Craftsmen Association, then left for Heulin.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s time for Acrab to spread its wings, so I wanted to manage Acrab myself. I had not wanted to go. But the people of Acrab and those I had put in charge had told me not to worry and to go ahead. I hadn’t known they had been so eager to send me away. I felt a little bad but I wasn’t planning to live my whole life in Acrab, so I agreed.</p>
<p>Julius, who called me to Heulin, said he would prepare everything as long as I agreed to visit. I had consented happily, but now that I had arrived, I regretted everything.</p>
<p>“Oh my! I never thought I’d live in the capital in a house as big as the Alshine estate of Acrab..”</p>
<p>“It’s like a palace, Countess!” exclaimed Mimi. I sighed deeply looking at how excited Mimi and Angel were. I only wanted a quiet life with a simple house. This was fit for a queen. All thanks to the courtesy of the Crown Prince.</p>
