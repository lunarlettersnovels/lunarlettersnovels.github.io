            <h3><strong>Chapter 331</strong></h3>
<p>I thought I was just in a terrible mood, but apparently, the thought of Exchetra had already become worse than a cockroach.</p>
<p>I wondered if it was obvious, but then I realized that Kaichen could pick up on the slightest change in my facial expression. Still, I awkwardly kept my expression straight.</p>
<p>Kaichen knew that my emotions were running wild these days as if I had just hit puberty. I smiled awkwardly, and he avoided eye contact, not saying anything else.</p>
<p>I felt like sighing, but I knew he’d ask me why I was sighing again, so I held it in.</p>
<p>Doesn’t this guy understand what it means to worry? Am I the only one feeling nervous right now?</p>
<p>I wanted to clench my jaw, snap at him, and ask him a question, but I lacked the courage. If it was anyone else, I could. But it was Kaichen.</p>
<p>I pouted my lips and rested my head against the carriage wall, casually gazing out the window at the sky. The solar eclipse will happen today, but strangely, the sky was cloudless and clear. The sun was shining brilliantly.</p>
<p>I’m not a fan of this kind of weather. I prefer rainy days.  Walking in the rain may be challenging and wet, but it always makes me feel good because it reminds me of the day I was saved.</p>
<p>After a hundred years of sunny days and nights, I craved more variety. And then on a particular day filled with dark skies and inclement weather as if something ominous was about to happen—Kaichen came to me.</p>
<p>So, summer in Heulin, with no rainy season and only months of “sunny” days, brings back uncomfortable memories for me.</p>
<p>Compared to Heulin, Acrab has a rainy season in the summer, so it rains a lot. Despite being part of the same empire, the weather was vastly different due to the large landmass.</p>
<p>Heulin, where the imperial palace is located, experiences four seasons: hot in summer and cool in winter. But for people from other parts of the world, it’s a calm climate that might make them laugh.</p>
<p>No storms, no heavy snowfalls. Heulin is the safest and most tranquil city in the Empire.</p>
<p>Nobles choose to live in Heulin not just for power and wealth but also for the desire to live in peace and tranquility in mild weather.</p>
<p>Moreover, Heulin boasts infrastructures that utilize magic, making it the most magical city in the Empire. The presence of various associations’ headquarters and the imperial palace contributes to its convenience.</p>
<p><em>‘But, alas, big cities… aren’t always great.’</em></p>
<p>Developed cities are undoubtedly convenient, but they are also noisy and prone to accidents due to the large population.</p>
<p>In my previous life, I didn’t like living in Seoul either. So, I headed to the countryside, where housing prices were cheaper, and I could find a decent house for rent. It was quiet, yet everything was accessible.</p>
<p>Since it was not too far from Seoul, commuting was easy with my car. But the downside was the annoying traffic jam in the evenings when everyone was trying to get out of Seoul. I’m too greedy to want everything to be perfect.</p>
<p>When this is all over, I’d like to live in the comfort of my willow house with Kaichen.</p>
<p>Acrab was a nice, quiet place to live, but I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life there. After all, I had already lived there a hundred years…</p>
<p>I moistened my dry lips with nervousness and blinked.</p>
<p>All I could see was a sunny day, and I thought that my mind was truly in a state of disarray today. I bit down hard on my bottom lip on habit.</p>
<p>No more thoughts.</p>
<p>Luckily, the carriage stopped just in time. In my daze, I realized we had passed the imperial palace, and I could see it in the distance.</p>
<p><em>‘Come to think of it… What’s the Emperor doing?’</em></p>
<p>I had almost forgotten that the main conflict in the novel is a power struggle for the imperial throne.</p>
<p>He couldn’t support his beloved child, Julius. But even so, there was no trace of the emperor at all.</p>
<p><em>‘Just what… did Exchetra do?’</em></p>
<p>There was no way that Exchetra, a talented schemer, would have ignored the emperor with more power than her. Nor would she have killed him out of the blue.</p>
<p>The part I read didn’t go into detail, but apparently, the Emperor had to do something to pass the throne. It had to be the will of the current Emperor, so Exchetra wouldn’t have been able to take over on her own accord.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it was clear that the current Emperor wanted Julius to become the Emperor.</p>
<p>The persistent worries in my head were beginning to feel like poison.</p>
<p><em>‘Hmph… will…’</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, I wondered what the author of the book was thinking.</p>
<p>He must have a twisted personality. It’s ridiculous to think that Kaichen was the incarnation of the golden dragon. The novel shouldn’t even be named after the Blue Dragon! It should be more ‘Kaichen protecting Julius.’</p>
<p>“Dalia.”</p>
<p>As a twist at the end, does it make sense to say that Kaichen’s crazy mana is actually because he’s the incarnation of the golden dragon from this world’s mythology?</p>
<p>Even if the author did a bit of foreshadowing… I still get annoyed. After all, I’m not a reader anymore, but his lover. The last thing I want to see is for him to get hurt.</p>
