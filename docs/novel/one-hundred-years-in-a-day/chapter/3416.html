            <p><strong>Chapter 107</strong></p>
<p>“Do you happen to know anything about Countess Alshine?” Julius asked.</p>
<p>“Who doesn’t? Dalia Alshine, Count of Acrab, the city of craftsmen,” Bart replied.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“The drunkard. The crazy woman who throws her life away in gambling. The unbloomed Black Rose. The Fallen Crow. She is known by a lot of names.”</p>
<p>Julius was quiet.</p>
<p>“In High society, Countess Alshine is seen as a prey. People like whining and yapping about her sorry circumstance. And now she had been accepted as the sole disciple of the Archmage. Everybody is talking about it.”</p>
<p>Julius was lost in thought. Although she wasn’t in a very good condition right now because of the poison and the commotion in Acrab, it was obvious that she was powerful and beautiful enough to be called the flower of the empire. Perhaps if she regains her health and assimilates with other nobles…</p>
<p>Her friendly attitude made her very diplomatic. She was indeed attractive and many would be lining up as suitors to court her when things return to normal. Julius wondered what kaichen would do then.</p>
<p>Kaichen will want to keep her hidden in Acrab. <em>No, he would take her with him to his house in the middle of nowhere and keep her hidden from the public eye. </em>Julius had teased Kaichen about falling in love with her. It seemed Kaichen really had. He had fallen in love with her so deeply it was almost annoying.</p>
<p>“Maybe he will take another disciple. He took in someone like her, didn’t he? It’s worth a shot!” said Bart in all earnestness.</p>
<p>Julius burst out laughing. Kaichen taking any other disciple than Dalia? Fat chance of that happening!</p>
<p>“Quit it, Bart,” said Julius. “Kaichen dislikes people. He treats them all like annoyances in his life.”</p>
<p>“But the Countess…”</p>
<p>“I guess there are always exceptions to everything.”</p>
<p>“But that is very difficult to believe. Why her?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? Kaichen is human after all.” Julius knew. Kaichen had been alone so long that maybe he wanted someone by his side now. He wanted to hold onto her as long as he could. Julius shook his head.</p>
<p>“This conversation is over, Bart,” said Julius. “What did His Majesty say?”</p>
<p>“His Majesty seemed perplexed and confused,” said Bart. “He must be afraid that if he chooses to send the knights then the Magic Tower might step into the fight.”</p>
<p>“Obviously,” said Julius. “It wouldn’t matter to the magicians whose side they are on. Kaichen is a very important asset to them. They will undoubtedly step in, afraid to lose Kaichen.”</p>
<p>Julius knew that if the Imperial palace sent the knights, this scuffle would turn into a full-fledged civil war. Julius got up from his seat, pressing his throbbing head. “I should see my sister,” he said.</p>
<p>“She will pretend that she has no idea whatsoever about this.”</p>
<p>“But she surely wouldn’t want a civil war,” said Julius. “She would want to avoid this fight with the Magic Tower too.” Julius saw the ring on the middle finger of his right-hand flicker.</p>
<p>Bart’s eyes twinkled. He knew who was calling. Julius infused the magic into the ring. “Kaichen, what in hell do you think you are doing?”</p>
<p><em>[I have to meet princess Akshetra.]</em></p>
<p>Julius was speechless. He knew kaichen was always straightforward and didn’t bother with the pleasantries but in a situation like this, it would have been great to receive some explanation.</p>
<p>“What in the crazy hell are you talking about?”</p>
<p><em>[I don’t want to waste my time with the Imperial Palace. I decided that it would be best to negotiate with the main culprit.]</em></p>
<p>“Do you think that would be so easy?”</p>
<p><em>[I think it’s easier than convincing the emperor that it’s poison, and not an epidemic that had spread in Acrab?]</em></p>
<p>Julius frowned. Kaichen was right but still…</p>
<p>“And what other crazy things do you have planned, if I may ask? Was it not enough that you received the call from the Imperial Palace on behalf of the countess? That alone has caused quite a stir.”</p>
<p>The official call from the Imperial Palace must be received by the ruler of the specific territory, or in their absence, their spouses or children or next of kin could take their place. Countess Alshine was unmarried, she had no children of her own and no blood relatives present. Technically, she should have received the call herself.</p>
<p>It was exactly why Julius had gone personally to inform countess Alshine about the state of Acrab when she was staying at Kaichen’s house because there was no one, not even countess Alshine herself, at Acrab to give a call from the Imperial Palace. Kaichen receiving the call on behalf of her was a very big deal. Julius wondered if Kaichen knew about the kind of trouble he had caused.</p>
<p><em>[Dalia was not able to receive it. There was no one else. The knights would have been sent to slaughter all the people in Acrab. Am I wrong?]</em></p>
<p>Julius sighed. He wasn’t wrong. Julius knew that the call had been just formality. The knights would have been sent to Acrab anyway. But Julius also knew that it was princess Akshetra, not the emperor, who had caused this situation. Julius called her ‘sister’ but he didn’t share the sentiment the word afforded.</p>
<p>“Do you think you can have a conversation with her?”</p>
<p><em>[Weren’t you also on your way to see her?]</em></p>
<p>“Yes… but.” Julius sighed. “I will meet her and talk to her about it. You can—”</p>
<p><em>[No, I’ll take care of it]</em></p>
<p>Kaichen still looked indifferent and cold like he always did. But Julius noticed that it was different this time. Julius could feel that there was anger in him. He had never seen Kaichen like this. Julius could see that Kaichen was so angry to the extent that he couldn’t comprehend how he was feeling.</p>
<p>“Bart, you are dismissed,” said Julius. Bart hesitated. He seemed to want to say something to Kaichen and then lowered his head and left.</p>
<p>Julius sat down on a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. “What are you so angry about?” They might have just met as disciples to the same teacher but they had grown up together. Julius considered Kaichen a brother. And despite what Kaichen said, he cared for Julius too. He never refused when Julius needed help. They were brothers and they knew when something was bothering each other.</p>
