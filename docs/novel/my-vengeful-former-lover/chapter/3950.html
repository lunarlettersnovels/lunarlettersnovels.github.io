            <p><strong>Chapter 93</strong></p>
<p>His hands were going faster and made squelching noises inside of her. The sounds were so shameful that Deatrice wanted to hide her face.</p>
<p>When Lucius took out his fingers, they were dripping wet with her lewd juices. Glancing at her as she closed her eyes, he noticed that her pearl white earrings were such a huge contrast to her beet-red skin.</p>
<p>He re-inserted his fingers and played with her erogenous areas until she climaxed.</p>
<p>Deatrice exhaled, gasping for breath, lying in bed as she listened to the pounding of her heart and felt the pleasurable sensation coursing through her body.</p>
<p>Then something poked at her entrance once more.</p>
<p>“What? Why are you—”</p>
<p>Lucius’ finger was slowly rubbing her again.</p>
<p>She wanted to get up, but the climax left her drowsy and weak. What’s more, she couldn’t move freely because he was pressing on her waist.</p>
<p>He slipped a finger into the wet hole and whispered in a low voice. “You’re still too tight, I won’t be able to enter without it being painful. I need to loosen you up a bit more.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Lucius pushed a second finger inside of her.</p>
<p>Deatrice’s breathing grew ragged as he started thrusting them inside her, massaging her sensitive muscles as they started contracting around his fingers. He wondered what it would feel like to have her soft and smooth inner walls wrapped around his appendage.</p>
<p>He was already at his rock-hard limit. If this went on for longer, he felt like he would burst and the urge to bury his member in her wet little hole became even stronger.</p>
<p>But upon seeing that Deatrice was already in this state just by using two of his fingers, he wondered if she would react more intensely once he penetrated her.</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t want to frighten her, so he lowered her head and covered her eyes so she wouldn’t see his throbbing shaft.</p>
<p>However, Deatrice, feeling his fingers leave her vag!na, opened her mouth and spoke.</p>
<p>“Let me see.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“I want to see…” She uttered, her voice coming out like a seductive whisper. Lucius saw her face riddled with ecstasy from all of his stimulation and it brought Lucius more satisfaction than ever.</p>
<p>Resisting the urge to place a kiss on her face, he slowly unzipped his pants and pulled out his pen!s.</p>
<p>To an innocent woman, finding its appearance strange would be normal since they haven’t seen anything like it before. Therefore, he was a bit apprehensive thinking it might leave a bad impression on her.</p>
<p>But Deatrice came closer. She lifted her body and stretched out her hand.</p>
<p><em>Is she going to touch it?</em></p>
<p>Astonished, Lucius pulled his body back a little.</p>
<p>“What…”</p>
<p>It was such an ambiguous question.</p>
<p>The tip of his member already had some pre-cum leaking out of it as he forcefully held back his excitement. Contrary to his handsome face, Deatrice really did think his newly exposed flesh was large but weird. Though, if she was to be a bit more honest, Deatrice thought it was kind of ugly at first glance.</p>
<p>Still, she reached out her hand without hesitation.</p>
<p>The feel of someone else’s touch on one’s sensitive areas was such a thrill and it provoked Lucius even further. Carefully grabbing his genitals, Deatrice caught a glimpse of his face, eyes closed and looking as if it was in pain.</p>
<p>Deatrice never could’ve imagined she could drive him to this extent with just him feeling the softness of her hands.</p>
<p>He shifted his hips closer, and Lucius instantly felt pleasurable friction as the movement thrust his member closer to her face. She rubbed her palms against the tip, feeling his own wetness against her fingers.</p>
<p>“Hold it tighter.”</p>
<p>A very low and groaning voice commanded. Then he suddenly shifted their positions and placed her on top of him.</p>
<p>He reached down, wrapped a palm around her hand that was still holding her member, and moved it up and down—basically stroking himself. Deatrice was a little startled by the way he tried to masturbate in earnest as he used her hands.</p>
<p>“Lucius…”</p>
<p>He hid his face in her neck, saying, “Call me Lucy.”</p>
<p>He had asked her to call him ‘Lucy’ once before, but back then she thought he was simply making fun of their past. But now, seeing that he asked to be called by his nickname while masturbating, Deatrice blushed. The nickname seemed to be quite important to him.</p>
<p>“Ugh…” He looked up and moaned, “say it.”</p>
<p>Hearing his low moan and heavy breathing caused another shiver in her body and she felt her insides clenching. She couldn’t understand how it was so… sexy.</p>
<p>Deatrice suddenly felt that she too wanted to appeal to Lucius to call her ‘Dee’ as well. He would often write a letter beginning with ‘To my beloved Dee’ when he was in a very good mood, although, he never called her by that name out loud,</p>
<p>His hips moved harder and rougher.</p>
<p>Even though she struggled in enduring the strength of his forceful thrusts, she liked the feeling of sharing something private and intimate with him.</p>
