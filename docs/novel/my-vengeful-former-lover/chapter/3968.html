            <p><strong>Chapter 75</strong></p>
<p>When she said nothing, his gaze deepened.</p>
<p>“Deatrice.”</p>
<p>“I just—”</p>
<p>“It’s useless even if you do this.” he cut her off coldly.</p>
<p>Feeling powerlessness overwhelm her, Deatrice simply decided to listen to what he had to say.</p>
<p>Lucius uttered calmly, “Whatever you do for this place, even if you dedicate yourself to me, you’ll just end up getting hurt and receiving nothing in return as I do not have the intention of prolonging my marriage with you.”</p>
<p>The finality and firmness of his tone brook no room for discussion. But like a fool, Deatrice asked with a shaky voice.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>On the other hand, he looked down at her indifferently.</p>
<p>“From the beginning, I had planned to annul my marriage with you a year after the estate is given to me and I’d blame you for its failure. Perhaps, because you had an affair? Or perhaps you were too lazy to do anything and therefore, unfit to manage my home?”</p>
<p>Deatrice inhaled sharply.</p>
<p>He was going to give her a societal death! The most insulting thing for a highborn like her and he knows that!</p>
<p>“Dixie knows, even my attendant knows.” he continued, “That no matter the reason, you will be kicked out of this manor one way or another and that will be the end of our little marriage. ”</p>
<p>“Why…”</p>
<p>Her eyebrows drew together, unable to comprehend his abrupt change of attitude.</p>
<p>“Why so sudden…”</p>
<p>He had just asked for a handkerchief from her and even muttered an apology before he passed out. Sure, she may have clashed with him from time to time, but she didn’t think that he would take things too far. Not to this extent.</p>
<p>Deatrice kept her mouth shut, trying to keep her dignity from crumbling in front of him. It became clear to her that he wasn’t saying this simply because he wanted to hurt her and his words didn’t occur to him out of thin air. It has been there all the time, it was just that she didn’t know.</p>
<p>That’s why he said he wouldn’t sleep with her. He didn’t give her permission to manage his affairs because he wanted to portray her incompetence.</p>
<p>She calmed herself and asked, “Why?”</p>
<p>“As you may know, my situation isn’t that good. No matter how many territories I receive, not everyone will recognize me as a proper noble. Political activities should’ve been a good starting point in consolidating my position, but your father opposes me.”</p>
<p>Lucius explained, his expressionless face unchanging. “However, the Duke’s position isn’t what it used to be and he’s aware of it. Sooner or later he would remarry and have a son, and after that, he would cut ties with us completely. It’s obvious that the only benefit I gain from being married to you ends with this one estate.”</p>
<p>His words dug into her chest like a searing hot knife.</p>
<p>“One estate is far from enough, but the war is already over and I can’t conquer any more land. Furthermore, I’m stuck to the emperor’s side like a hunting lapdog. So I concluded that getting married to a lady with a similarly powerful background is the most convenient solution for me.”</p>
<p>This time, it no longer felt as if he stabbed her in the chest, but as if he threw her into a bottomless cliff.</p>
<p><em>Helplessness.</em></p>
<p>Just as when her father forbade her to marry the Fenry’s bastard child six years ago, and again when he ordered her to marry him to save his neck.</p>
<p>Deatrice felt like a ragdoll being tossed and turned, unable to decide her fate for the sake of others’ wealth and fame. How easy it is for him to throw her away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sharp pain passed through her.</p>
<p><em>“This ring was originally meant to be Dixie’s, but I stole it.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The ruby on this ring… I wanted you to have it because it resembles my eyes. A testament to my oath that I shall always look after you. To always protect and cherish you…”</em></p>
<p><em>“My love, will you marry me?”</em></p>
<p>It felt like she was being pierced by pins and needles for every word he spoke a long time ago.</p>
<p><em>Your expression looked exactly just like my father’s…</em></p>
<p><em>You loved me, you’re not just anyone else to me. How could you do this?</em></p>
<p>The heat of betrayal warmed her eyes and she buried her face in her hands, but no tears came out and her fingers became icy cold. When she clenched her fists, she recovered herself from her sorry-looking position and looked at him.</p>
<p>Lucius stared into her blue-gray eyes and pretended nothing was wrong.</p>
<p>“What?” he asked.</p>
<p>It’s that indifferent <em>‘what’ </em>again.</p>
<p>Lucius thought to himself that he wouldn’t know what to do if Deatrice exploded as she did before. He didn’t have to confidence to deny that he was doing it for revenge as he did back then.</p>
<p>It wasn’t, at least before. But he made a decision and it evolved into revenge. As per Dixie’s words once, he’s a stinky and an unchangeable bastard. But that’s good, he didn’t want Deatrice to see him as a good person any longer.</p>
<p>It’s a choice he has to make for a better future for himself.</p>
<p>“Why are you telling this to me?” she asked.</p>
<p>Her voice was a bit cold, which shouldn’t come as a surprise to Lucius, but still surprised him all the same. He was silent for a moment, then he responded coolly with an unwavering gaze.</p>
<p>“Even if I tell you, it will change nothing.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think I deserve to know?”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you this so you can prepare for it. Even the emperor sides with me and says that there is no need to continue my marriage with you, so don’t try to change my mind about the annulment.”</p>
<p>Red irises met with blue-gray ones in silent contest. Eventually, Lucius spoke again.</p>
<p>“I’ll stay with you for a little while, but in the end, even the Duke won’t be able to help you. The longer you stand alone, the longer our fight will be. And regarding other matters…” he paused to look at her, “Just prepare for it in advance. You can buy some properties in another country and form connections there. Do whatever you want with the money allocated to you.”</p>
