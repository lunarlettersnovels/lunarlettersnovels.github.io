            <p><strong>Chapter 168</strong></p>
<p>“I’m so tired of this.” Deatrice sighed behind the cold marble.</p>
<p>Lucius stood in front of her and handed her champagne. He gave it out of habit, but then he remembered that the sweet liquor was not Deatrice’s preference.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Deatrice needed the closest drink to calm her nerves, even if it didn’t suit her taste.</p>
<p>She drank the alcohol she had been handed and said, “Everyone is so obvious. They’ll be watching us like hawks and drag our names in the mud.”</p>
<p>It was their third social event since the start of the season. The first was the opera at Elston, the second was the wedding anniversary of the Winkets, and the third was the engagement today of the first daughter of Count Hayes and the first son of Marquis Borger.</p>
<p>At first, she was careful to bring up Fredhi’s name to Lucius. But after that, it wasn’t as difficult the second time around. As soon as the meeting was over that day, Deatrice was drearily in front of the dressing table for a long time and muttered.</p>
<p>“Damn it, Fredhi Joel Ballencar.”</p>
<p>One couldn’t count how many times she had called Fredhi out like this after hearing some of the nobles’ annoying words. She was suffocated from all the stares and the strangely heated atmosphere.</p>
<p>Deatrice, who had lived amongst the society for the longest time, had never been this blatant and coarse with her words. Of course, she could still feel the excitement of society after the announcement of her marriage to Lucius, but she was so distracted at the time that she didn’t have time to face such a reaction.</p>
<p>But now, with the desire and interest gradually building up, she would come to know the feelings that came to their faces.</p>
<p>It was as if everyone was holding her in the palm of their hands, shouting to Fredhi Ballencar to tell him that they wanted him to claim her and provide entertainment for the high echelons of society.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she sighed and apologized.</p>
<p>If there is someone who’s having a harder time than her, it was Lucius.</p>
<p>The people were comparing Lucius and Fredhi as if they were choosing a racehorse. Deatrice was in a position where she can ultimately choose between the two men, but Lucius was in a position that only awaits to be chosen or be insulted by his wife.</p>
<p>Lucius was her husband, and they were already wed, so it would be understandable if she chose him. But choosing the Fredhi was reasonable too.</p>
<p>Why? Simply because he is a prince. What fool would throw an opportunity to become part of royalty?</p>
<p>Lucius smiled, hiding Deatrice from people’s eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. It’s very encouraging to me that you’re now spouting that name hatefully.”</p>
<p>Even jokingly, Lucius replied in a relaxed manner. In fact, Lucius, unlike Deatrice, seemed to be going through this whole situation without much agitation.</p>
<p>He had never been annoyed or sensitive, even by mistake, and he was always considerate of her as he is now and hid her from people’s eyes as much as possible. It was not once or twice that Deatrice was embarrassed because she seemed to be emotional by herself, while he handled things more maturely.</p>
<p>Even now, after the joke, he didn’t seem to care much about Fredhi. He looked through the people and shook his head as if he had figured out what he had to do and soon kissed her, saying regretfully, “I think I have to go now. If you’re really tired, go inside first.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine. I’m not a child anymore.”</p>
<p>“Will you truly be fine?” He asked, bowing his head, and trying to make eye contact with her.</p>
<p>Deatrice replied, nodding slowly.</p>
<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s just that I’m too sensitive. Besides, their wagging tongues must be tired by now.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if that will happen, but I’ll pray for you.”</p>
<p>“To which god? You don’t even pray.”</p>
<p>“That’s why my prayers are even more valuable. They might see it as a form of repenting and grant my wish.”</p>
<p>The kiss he gave on the cheek was playful and soft. Deatrice looked up for a moment and looked at Lucius’s face, who looked drowsy, and then admired his face.</p>
<p>Under the orange chandelier light, Lucius’s blonde hair looked brilliant and seemed as if it would melt like golden light. Even when she first examined him carefully, he was like a beacon that enraptured her.</p>
<p>She had secretly listened to the stories that her cousin had been talking about, then she impulsively called out a nickname that her cousin unwittingly called him before.</p>
<p>“Angel.”</p>
<p>Lucius laughed a little, embarrassed by the unexpected call. “What’s with that nickname?”</p>
<p><em>That moment when your face changed from a bored expression to a smiling one, you shone like a dazzling figure in the midst of a ballroom, and I had wanted to call you that name at that moment that I had even dreamed of it.</em></p>
<p>This little memory of hers had slipped her mind, but she was glad she recalled it now. Instead of answering lengthily, Deatrice simply said.</p>
<p>“Well… You praying only for me makes you feel like my own angel.”</p>
<p>“It’s kind of romantic.”</p>
<p>He took her hand and left a deep kiss on her palm. It was a kiss over the gloves, but it was enough to tickle the inside of the palm and heat the back of her neck. Deatrice suppressed the urge to hold him for a moment, but soon she saw the gesture of a man urging him from across the street, she relaxed her hands.</p>
<p>“Go, Lucy. They are calling for you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try to come back early.”</p>
<p>Lucius let go of Deatrice’s hand that he was holding. He turned and went toward the man.</p>
<p>Deatrice drew away from the pillar of the cold marble, glancing at Lucius’ back, striding away.</p>
<p>It was time to go to war again.</p>
