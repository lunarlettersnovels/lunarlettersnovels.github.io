            <p><strong>Chapter 155</strong></p>
<p>Dixie’s voice was hoarse from crying as she spoke. Deatrice bent down to pick up the wedding ring that had fallen to the floor and handed it over to her friend. As Dixie’s gaze briefly touched Deatrice’s hand, the latter passed the ring over to her. Dixie couldn’t help but let out a small laugh as she looked at the ruby ring and the wedding ring on her hand.</p>
<p>“It seems like he finally found it,” she said, her voice tinged with amusement.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Deatrice furrowed her brow in confusion.</p>
<p>“My brother,” Dixie explained. “He sent me a letter asking about the ring. He wanted to know where the one you had thrown away is.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Deatrice hid her hands, and a moment of jealousy and contempt passed across Dixie’s face.</p>
<p>“How does it feel to have it all? Whether you’re harsh to him or not, my brother has always been devoted. After it was revealed that he was an illegitimate child, he was cautious about asking anything about his mother or household chores. Then he said, ‘I’m shameless’ and persistently asked where the ring was. He said the ring was important as if it contained some meaning. But I remember that you sent the ring in an envelope without adding anything, and I think that the ring meant nothing but your cruelty and indifference.”</p>
<p>Deatrice had no defense against those accusations. She knew that it wasn’t just the ring; the fault lay with her for not letting Dixie know sooner, when things had started to spiral out of control. She struggled to calm herself, feeling her face flush and her throat grow sore as she finally spoke up.</p>
<p>“I know I can’t excuse my actions back then. I was cruel and mean.”</p>
<p>“Why, but still, brother said he loves you?”</p>
<p>“Lucius is…”</p>
<p>“Shut up. Stop talking. I’m not interested anyway.”</p>
<p>Suppressing her rage, Dixie turned her head away. She had been suppressing the feeling of wanting to smash everything. Had she been alone, she would have been freer.</p>
<p>Dixie inflated her thorns to get rid of Deatrice.</p>
<p>“Why do you stay by my side while hearing this? Do you want to see how happy you are by looking at me? or to tell someone else?”</p>
<p>In fact, so did some of Dixie’s closest friends. At first, they comforted and helped her with both her emotions and feelings, but as the infidelity continued to happen repeatedly, their attitudes began to shift. They told her that this was now her fate, something she simply had to endure and live with. When Dixie wasn’t around, they would refer to her as “poor and pitiable thing,” a name that stung deeply.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, they would subtly boast about their own husbands, praising them for their lack of affairs despite not having much ability. It was a small but sharp dig at Dixie, a reminder of what she had lost and what they still had. Dixie felt isolated and alone, betrayed not just by her husband but by the friends she had turned to for solace.</p>
<p>Dixie realized that. It might be the first one or two, but someone’s repeated misfortune now plays no role other than defining her as such a person. Now Dixie is just a wife with a cheating husband. Before that, how happy and affectionate they were became meaningless.</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me?”</p>
<p>Deatrice asked Dixie, who was lost in thought. Dixie laughed at the nonsense as if it was absurd.</p>
<p>“How should I believe in you?”</p>
<p>As if realizing that obvious thing, Deatrice pondered for a while, then knelt down in front of Dixie and motioned for her to lift the hem of her skirt. Dixie wasn’t bleeding thankfully, and she didn’t know what to do with the bruises, Dixie did as she was told and held out her injured leg.</p>
<p>Dixie’s annoyance quickly dissipated as Deatrice closed her eyes and muttered something under her breath. Suddenly, a white light emanated from her hand and enveloped Dixie’s bruised leg, causing her to forget about Raymond’s affair for a moment.</p>
<p>The scars and pain from the impact vanished as if they had been washed away, and Dixie felt her body grow lighter. It was undoubtedly a manifestation of the gods. She stared in awe at Deatrice, realizing that she held a great secret within her.</p>
<p>“W-what is this…”</p>
<p>Stuttering, she tried to ask for an explanation, but Deatrice only laughed softly.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling more at ease now? It’s like we’re holding each other’s secrets, right?”</p>
<p>Then she said such reckless words. Could it be that the secret that her husband had an affair and that she was born with divine power weighed the same?</p>
<p>Even if the former was revealed, Dixie would only lose face a little, but in the latter case, she would be punished by being summoned and punished by all the nobles and stand in trial in the temple.</p>
