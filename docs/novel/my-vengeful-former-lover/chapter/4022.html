            <p><b>Chapter 21</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she didn’t reply, Charlie More spoke again. “Have you heard the news about me? That Mr. Sid, whom I was engaged to, failed his business and went into exile.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course she knew. It had already happened at least half a year ago that it could hardly be identified as ‘news’ anymore. During that time, Deatrice had to go to the count’s mansion to comfort Charlie More even though they weren’t even that close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was because her aunt, Victoria, was so ill back then so she couldn’t properly console and manage her daughter who wasn’t in her right frame of mind. Deatrice would be inside her room and see her jumping on her bed like a crazed woman, saying how she desperately needed to see Mr. Sid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if reminiscing those bitter times, Charlie took a handkerchief and wiped her nonexistent tears in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that time, my heart felt like it was going to break, but hearing your story gave me a lot of strength. You’re also getting married to the lover you broke up with six years ago. Therefore, I think that my Mr. Sid might come back to me again someday.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t tell me…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Deatrice did not say her thoughts out loud was more of the fact that she was surprised rather than her being considerate. She didn’t expect for Charlie to still be thinking of him even after months had passed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doesn’t she realize how ridiculous she would appear because of that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I and Lucius—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, yes. I am aware, you and Sir Elliot are a special case. I’m just hoping that something special like that will happen to me too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, you are planning to wait for him?” she asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, didn’t you wait for Sir Elliot?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A contemptuous expression pasted itself on Deatrice’s face. “Do you think I’ve been waiting for him all these years with lingering regrets? I was already engaged! Don’t tell me you thought I was with Fredhi while yearning for another man?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stupid expression revealed itself on Charlie More’s face that indicated she really didn’t understand what the problem was. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s wrong with that? Why even try to hide the truth even though it’s just the two of us? Either way, no one would blame you. You’ve ended up marrying him soon, anyways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Charlene More.” Deatrice interrupted sternly. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You—!”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face went pale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew that Charlie More wasn’t the only one at fault, but she couldn’t bear to think that everyone else was thinking the same way—that when Fredhi sacrificed his life for her father’s sake, the public had questioned her loyalty behind closed doors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlie More couldn’t keep up with Deatrice’s sudden anger and her eyes widened in surprise. Hearing the commotion, Victoria hastily drove the designer out of the room and approached where Deatrice was. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s with all this racket? You’re not kids, and we’re in public!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mother, I—!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No.” She cut off her daughter’s words, “Deatrice, you answer me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Deatrice kept her mouth shut and didn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her mind, she surmised that Charlie would soon become impatient, and Victoria would listen to her side and then judge the situation from her perspective. Then, they would tell her to leave this place. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I must say, it’s not exactly a bad outcome…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Victoria, who watched Deatrice pursing her lips into a thin line, kicked her daughter out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait outside, Charlie.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No buts! Leave us be for a few moments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victoria led Charlie out the door herself and closed it on her way back. Then she turned around. Deatrice rolled her body helplessly on her sofa, wearing only her thin underwear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victoria didn’t know what’s going on, but she knew that the only time Deatrice had been curled up like this was during the death of her sister, Amelia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She soon sat down next to her to comfort her own niece.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she was just an aunt in status, Victoria was the only person who could fill the void in Deatrice’s heart from time to time after her mother died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is the problem, child? Did something happen?” Asking affectionately as if she never nagged, Victoria pulled Deatrice and leaned her against her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, there’s nothing wrong.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as soon as Deatrice said those words, she started leaning on Victoria’s shoulder, and her aunt could sense her dispirited behavior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was rare, and Victoria instinctively realized that perhaps there was something wrong with this marriage from Deatrice’s strange demeanor. “Is this marriage an order from the emperor?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deatrice lifted her head and looked at her aunt in astonishment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victoria smiled bitterly and pulled Deatrice into a hug. “It’s quite obvious just by seeing the look on your face, which was rare for a bride to have right before marriage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She broke off their embrace and looked into her eyes. “Besides, your father is seldom quiet, and I found it peculiar given how he previously opposed your relationship. Others might say your father finally gave up on everything, but we both know that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> man is not the type to yield so easily…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Poor Deatrice… It would have been better had it been a person without any prior ties to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deatrice had always hated her aunt’s somewhat irksome voice. But today, she felt oddly comforted by it.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have been better if it was a person who had zero ties to her.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius had pretended to be okay the whole time since they started this charade, pretending that there was no past between them. But the fact that he proposed to her in a temple and not anywhere else, was a sign that he didn’t dismiss the past as simply nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps he even chose that place out of spite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, that was it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, what about the conversation they had on the carriage afterwards? Wasn’t that another indication of his resentment? Perhaps he had only wanted to remind her about all the faults she had done and the hurt they had caused him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This marriage could easily be his ploy to get his revenge on her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she became more depressed, Victoria hugged her even tighter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She further rested her weight against Victoria’s bosom, entrusting herself completely to her aunt’s care. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been a long time since she had another hand stroking her hair so tenderly…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not worry too much, child. Even if Lucius did hurt you, it will only last for a short while. Anger will not persist for too long, and marriage is the one that lasts for a lifetime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continued, “Sooner or later, the two would have to set aside your differences and learn to live together in harmony. The things that you regard today as major obstacles would only tend to become more trivial as time passes by. So, just for the meantime… endure, alright?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just for the meantime.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deatrice memorized her aunt Victoria’s spell, even though she truly couldn’t imagine the two of them fully reconciling in the future. She could only hope that one day, their subtle war of unnerving each other would soon come to an end.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mmm. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just for the meantime—</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—I will endure.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She promised herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
