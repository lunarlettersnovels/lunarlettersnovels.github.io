            <p><strong>Chapter 218</strong></p>
<p>Lucius fell apart after she left.</p>
<p>The only certain thing was that it took him some time to recover.</p>
<p>Of course, for a few months, he locked himself in the mansion, throwing and catching a ball against the wall alone, clumsily playing the piano that he rarely played, and after throwing away a book, spending hours staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Unlike six years ago when he did the same but stayed in his room for months, this time he came out in just a week.</p>
<p>“I guess I got used to being rejected the second time.”</p>
<p>He muttered sarcastically, but Lucius had to admit that things were different now. Unlike back then, when he could learn and socialize without responsibilities, now his shoulders were burdened with various responsibilities.</p>
<p>He woke up and glanced at the dim garden landscape for a moment before getting up. Another tedious morning had arrived. He mechanically got up, put on a robe over his bare body, and stepped outside the bed.</p>
<p>Papers and clothes, thrown carelessly, greeted his feet.</p>
<p>After locking the door and shutting himself in for a week, Lucius’ room seemed to be perceived as a restricted area by the servants. No one came in, and it only became more chaotic.</p>
<p>“You should fix that habit. You’re subtly sloppy, always throwing your clothes on the floor.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he remembered what Deatrice had said. At the same time, the warmth he had felt from her back then rushed to him like a gust of wind. It was painful, as if his heart was melting, but still, he didn’t collapse.</p>
<p>Because there had been too many moments like this since she left.</p>
<p>When there was no tableware on the spot where she always sat in the dining room, when the book she used to read was not on the small table in the living room, when her wine-colored cloak was not visible when she left the front door.</p>
<p>As many memories overlaid with their moments together, there were just as many in her absence. And that was true even though Lucius had secluded himself to a remote place, away from the couple’s room where they had spent the most time together.</p>
<p>The wounds, akin to accumulating small losses, showed no signs of diminishing.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was that not-so-casual letter.</p>
<p>Lucius directed his gaze to a crumpled piece of paper rolling around his room, like any other document. Even without looking at the contents of the letter, he could recite every word.</p>
<p>[“To Lucius,</p>
<p>Please dispose of all remaining belongings soon.</p>
<p>If you dispose of them immediately, people will surely become suspicious. Wait until the verdict is over. Don’t clear out my things, even if you find them unpleasant to look at. People believe I went for treatment because of illness anyway.</p>
<p>If you really can’t stand it and want to quickly get rid of my belongings, just inform the emperor that you agree to annul the marriage.</p>
<p>I think the fastest and quietest way to end all of this is for you to agree to the annulment. But it won’t be an easy decision. I’m not trying to rush you. I just want to say that if you do, I want to speak about my reputation there. I’m okay with whatever you say. If you claim I was negligent in managing the mansion, avoided sharing a bed with you, acted immorally, it’s fine.</p>
<p>I don’t have any intention of going back there anymore. So, my reputation there doesn’t matter at all.”</p>
<p>So, do as you see fit. Feel free to ruin me to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>Well then, I hope you are doing well.]</p>
<p>Short and dry.</p>
<p>Unlike the letters that seemed almost designed to hurt him, this one was different from six years ago. Back then, he had desperately wished for even a short note from her, but the letters he received only caused more pain and offered no comfort.</p>
<p>After their last meeting, Deatrice had disappeared somewhere. In the letter, she asked him to write to her, inform people that she had gone for treatment, handle the annulment quietly, and requested Lucius to allow Rosalynn to come and pick up some of her belongings.</p>
<p>After reading the letter, Lucius couldn’t help but think of the maid who had served by Deatrice’s side as if she were a confidante.</p>
<p>‘Ah, so they exchanged messages all this time.’</p>
<p>Hurrying upstairs to the room they used to share, Lucius saw Rosalynn packing Deatrice’s belongings into about four trunks.</p>
<p>As soon as she saw Lucius standing by the door, Rosalynn bent her knees slightly and greeted him.</p>
<p>However, Lucius had no energy to welcome the greeting. He stood crookedly, looking at a small trunk contemplating whether a few sets of clothes would fit inside.</p>
<p>“She said she’s leaving completely. Is this all you’re taking? Or do you plan to carry her belongings over the course of a few days?”</p>
<p>In response to his disdainful remark, Rosalynn politely bowed and replied.</p>
<p>“Madam said anything that can be worn immediately will suffice. Since she won’t be going into society, there’s no need for extravagant clothes.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, you could have taken care of it at the ducal estate. Was it necessary to come all the way here and make a mess?”</p>
<p>“I’ll make sure to handle it as quickly as possible without causing inconvenience.”</p>
