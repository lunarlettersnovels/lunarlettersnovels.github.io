            <p><strong>Chapter 122</strong></p>
<p>It didn’t make sense. But already, it seemed that this knight in front of her knew better. Still, it was because she felt his stern determination. Deatrice, receiving a baby horse from her knight at the entrance of the raining forest, felt bizarre. It might cause issue that would not be exactly good for Atkins.</p>
<p>A clear, sweet, clear voice echoed through the forest briefly. A laughter erupted.</p>
<p>After losing her composure for a while, Deatrice pulled back her robe. Her pale cheeks had just turned a little red from laughter. “Do you know what you did was extortion?”</p>
<p>“Huh?” The bewildered man asked in a sullen voice, indicating he did not understand at all.</p>
<p>“When did you leave for war?”</p>
<p>“It would be four years ago.”</p>
<p>“And when did you come back from the war?”</p>
<p>“Two years ago.”</p>
<p>“Right. War is what makes people emotional. The man you know must have said he would give you what you wanted, drunk on the feeling of your imminent departure and the possibility of never returning. But did you ever wonder how the man must’ve felt when you suddenly showed up to ask for a horse after all these years?”</p>
<p>His brows furrowed, perplexed by a simple situation that she turned into something more complicated.</p>
<p>“But I don’t doubt his sincerity.” The young man said in a confident voice.</p>
<p>Deatrice had been together with him for only a while, but she had a rough idea that Atkins would have done it. With a smile, she fastened her robe and turned her back toward the mansion. Rosalynn could be seen waiting from afar, just in case.</p>
<p>The young man who was quietly watching her walk away narrowed as he ran. “So are you not going to accept it? Because what I’m doing is extortion?”</p>
<p>“There are many <em>other reasons</em> other than that.”</p>
<p>“Because of your and my position?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” She nodded and looked at him with a raised brow, “And I can say that an attitude like this coming from a knight is quite arrogant.”</p>
<p>“Our status is out of our control, but I can prove it’s not extortion.”</p>
<p>“Sir Atkins.”</p>
<p>“…but it’s just a pony…” Atkins said in a very earnest tone. If he could, maybe he would even pout. “It’s not even a horse yet, just a really tiny pony. It’s only been a short while since it was born.”</p>
<p>He spoke as if it is a very important matter, trying his best to convince her. As if it being a pony could be an excuse. Because of the meaning contained within, Deatrice did not respond in any way until she arrived at the manor.</p>
<p>As they got closer, the young man’s determination slowly faded. Eventually he calmed down, already giving up everything and focusing only on escorting her. When the unwet stone steps left marks on the lady’s soiled shoes, she said. “I will receive it.”</p>
<p>Atkins raised his head.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Looking down at the young man’s clear and unadulterated gaze from a few steps up, Deatrice wondered if the manner of him explaining his insistence that she accept the foal, was him trying to explain himself. That she accept him as well.</p>
<p>“I will receive the pony, but only on the condition that I pay for it.” She saw that he was about to protest so she quickly added, “If you don’t agree, then don’t bring it here.”</p>
<p>“I… agree to your terms.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful. Thank you, Sir Atkins.” Deatrice looked down at Atkins for a moment, then turned around and went up to the mansion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>News that Deatrice had bought a pony from Atkins soon reached Lucius’ ears as well. As soon as Lucius heard the story, he burst into laughter, but the laughter was so nerve-wracking that the servant mumbled things fearfully without realizing it.</p>
<p><em>“The pony looked quite smart and very strong.”</em></p>
<p>But Lucius didn’t care whether that foal was destined to die soon or was to be reborn as the world’s greatest horse. He was just annoyed. He was exhausted by himself, who was always shaken by such things. Honestly speaking, he was simply jealous.</p>
<p>It would not have been so annoying if she had received a pony as a gift.</p>
<p>But Deatrice paid for the foal, and Atkins said that he received it. So, what the hell were they playing at?</p>
<p>Lucius became nervous, put down the papers he was looking at, then got up and went out to the terrace. A cool autumn breeze blew through his hair.</p>
<p>When they got to Dixie’s mansion, Lucius sniggered at Atkins as he looked around for quality horses that he couldn’t afford. He wouldn’t be able to give her something of that caliber. But in the end, Atkins managed to give her a pony, not a horse. And that small pony seemed to have a hidden meaning between them even though she paid for it.</p>
<p><em>Damn.</em></p>
<p>Lucius swallowed a curse word that threatened to escape his through. He ruffled his golden hair and sat down. The woman he loved was a cold woman.</p>
<p>During their first dinner with Wilton, Lucius clearly made a confession where he practically stated that he loves her. He had looked straight into her eyes then, to convey the sincerity in his eyes.</p>
<p>It’s easy enough for even an idiot to understand, so there’s nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>But she completely ignored the confession and was now flirting with a greenhorn. How was he supposed to take this? Could it be that the woman really has no heart for him?</p>
<p>“No. It can’t be.” Lucius clenched his teeth and muttered.</p>
<p>In the time she spent with her, Lucius could only vaguely guess her heart. There was evidence that words could not explain. The air between them when there were only the two of them, the fleeting softness in her gaze, and the calm gray eyes looking up at his eyes when there was nothing to say.</p>
<p>“You need to go now. Count Wilton is coming soon.”</p>
