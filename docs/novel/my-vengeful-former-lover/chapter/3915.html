            <p><strong>Chapter 128</strong></p>
<p><em>Maybe he isn’t in the study and really went out?</em></p>
<p>Just as she was about to turn around, thunder struck.</p>
<p>For a moment, the room lit up, and because of that, Deatrice was able to see a cravat that had fallen beside the desk.</p>
<p>“…Lucius?” She quickly noticed it was his. He had a habit of taking his clothes off when he’s a little frustrated.</p>
<p>Deatrice called his name and entered. She only went inside the adjoining room, but somehow felt certain that he was here. As she got a little closer, she saw that the door leading to the room Lucius had used before was open.</p>
<p>When she pushed against it, a dark yet seemingly short passage appeared. However, she couldn’t get it to fully open as it didn’t slide easily, as if it was caught in something. As she struggled to use her strength, thunder rang once more, and the door suddenly became lighter. The room that opened with a loud sound was still dark, but the study was the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Rain poured through the open window and white curtains fluttered about. Papers had gone flying through the air and there were some that had been drenched by the downpour. There was also the whistling wind, torn clothes, torn chairs, and Lucius sitting on top of it.</p>
<p>He was crying and breathing messily in the chaotic room.</p>
<p><em>“…Lucy.”</em></p>
<p>She mumbled quietly.</p>
<p>Mixed with the sound of rain, her voice sounded somewhat bizarre. Cold raindrops rushed into the room through the open window. Deatrice forced her body to walk forward and lock the window. As the sound of the rain receded, she could hear Lucius’ voice better.</p>
<p>The sound of his ragged breathing and suppressed groaning was like an animal caught in a trap and the tenor of it felt like it was grabbing her ankle to drag her elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, Deatrice kept her calm and walked towards him.</p>
<p>“Lucius.”</p>
<p>She called him, in a voice clearer than before. But he clasped his hands tighter on the white cloth he held and covered his face, as if he couldn’t hear anything. Eventually, Deatrice put a hand on Lucius’ cheek and lifted his face.</p>
<p>“Lucius, look at me.”</p>
<p>His hair was damp with rain and sweat, his cheeks were stained with lines of tears, and his eyes were glossy and blurry. With his unfocused eyes, Lucius looked at Deatrice.</p>
<p>Lucius, who had been observing the features of her face with blank eyes for a while, seemed to recognize her at that moment.</p>
<p>“Dee.”</p>
<p>He called her by the nickname he had once asked for.</p>
<p>However, it was more like a piece of her rather than her nickname. Deatrice wiped Lucius’ wet cheeks. “Yes, it’s me, Lucius.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you finally came.”</p>
<p>He breathed a sigh of relief and pulled her closer, as if he had waited for a long time. Thanks to that, Deatrice sat on the floor, and as if aiming for it, Lucius dove into her arms.</p>
<p>“D… D—<em>my Dee</em>.”</p>
<p>Mumbling the same thing, he gave a peck on her face and at the back of her hand and Deatrice felt her body sinking more and more. Like some weight had been lifted from just those two kisses.</p>
<p>Occasionally he would say something like, ‘How did you get here?’ or ‘It must have been rough.’</p>
<p>He kissed her again and again.</p>
<p>There were kisses that lasted for a fraction of a second, and then there were kisses that were exploratory that felt like he was confirming her existence. Deatrice pushed him away, but he pulled her back like a trap she couldn’t get out of.</p>
<p>“Dee.”</p>
<p>Burying his face between the nape of her neck, he barely exhaled and called her back. He took off her robe and kissed her bare arms one after another, down to her fingertips and, for a moment, he buried his face in her hands and remained still.</p>
<p>“Dee, I—” he stammered.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m scared.”</p>
<p>His words hung heavily in the air.</p>
<p>Deatrice wanted to ask what was so frightening, but her words didn’t come out because they were caught inside her throat. Instead, she wiped his messy blonde hair with her hand.</p>
<p>With the feel of her fingers on his head, Lucius closed his eyes. It was then that he realized that all his gestures were caused by anxiety and that the reason he kissed her was to restore his sanity.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be scared, Lucy.”</p>
<p>When she barely spoke aloud, he stubbornly responded. “…you know nothing.”</p>
<p>“No, I know. It’s all gone. you are right in front of me now.”</p>
<p>He looked at her with vacant eyes, as if he couldn’t understand her words. Instead of explaining further, she closed her eyes and kissed him. She didn’t know why but at that moment, kissing him felt like what he needed most—and giving him what he needed the most was the most important thing right now.</p>
<p>He acted like a man deprived of water and was instantly absorbed in the kiss. He coveted her tenaciously that she was fiercely out of breath. When she felt like she was going to burst from his passion, she had to stop because he needed to take a break too.</p>
<p>“No, don’t do that. Breathe for me, Lucius.”</p>
<p>He was stunned at her somewhat coercive voice and then nodded his head. When their lips met again, he was a little cautious as he looked into her eyes. When he kissed her and bit her lip without realizing it, he pulled his body behind her and apologized to her.</p>
<p>“Sorry. I didn’t do that on purpose—”</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>Deatrice spoke briefly, grabbed his neck, leaned back, and climbed onto his body. Lucius instinctively wrapped his hands around her waist and steadied her.</p>
<p>She could feel his body heat up between her thighs.</p>
<p>“Dee…”</p>
