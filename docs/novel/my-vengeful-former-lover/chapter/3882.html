            <p> </p>
<p><strong>Chapter 161</strong></p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>Lucius looked into her face for a long time and then suddenly asked. “We haven’t seen each other in a long time, do you still think I’m handsome?”</p>
<p>She laughed at the playful question. She often imagined what their reunion would be like, but she didn’t know that it would start with such a ridiculous conversation.</p>
<p>Deatrice nodded, holding back a faint smile, “Yes. I still think you’re handsome.”</p>
<p>She stared at his features a few seconds longer and praised him, lightly tapping on his nose bridge, “Your nose is high, and your eyes are deep. Who would dare not like you?”</p>
<p>Lucius smiled.</p>
<p>“I missed you,” he uttered, eyes filled with eagerness. Her butterfly-like touch on his face made him tingle and he finally grabbed her hand and kissed her. The feeling of her soft fingers on his lips was strange.</p>
<p>“I wanted to see you,” he continued. “Every day, I read and re-read the letters you sent me. There were times when I felt like I wanted to write another letter and chase after you when your reply came late. But it felt like I was trying too hard, so I didn’t.”</p>
<p>Whispering, he looked at her as he slowly raised his eyes to meet her gaze. From that angle, his eyebrows were lifted, revealing the bright red of his eyes. It was always mysterious whenever she saw that appearance.</p>
<p>“Deatrice, tell me. Say the words you wrote in the letter with your voice.”</p>
<p>“What do you want to hear?”</p>
<p>“That you love me. I’ve been reading your letters every day, waiting for your reply. I want to hear you say it, tell me that you love me.” As he spoke, he knelt down in front of her and wrapped his arms around her waist, resting his face on her thigh. Through the thin fabric of her nightgown and blanket, she could feel the warmth of his face. His firm nose and hot, soft lips pressed against her skin.</p>
<p>Deatrice awkwardly lifted Lucius’s head which was bent.</p>
<p>“I love you, Lucius.”</p>
<p>It was a phrase he had not heard her say in years and it sounded awkward when she said it. Maybe that’s why there was no reply from Lucius.</p>
<p>Deatrice felt the awkward silence that followed and looked around nervously. Then, she felt a slow and gentle touch around her waist. She could feel Lucius’ hand slowly moving down her curves. His touch was unmistakably romantic and she knew that her confession had stirred something in him.</p>
<p>“Lucy,” Deatrice called him in an embarrassed voice.</p>
<p>He looked up. His hands were so rough, but when he raised his head, his eyes were as gentle as a soft breeze. He asked, flexibly controlling the atmosphere that enveloped them, “You don’t like it?”</p>
<p>His hand went to her thighs. There was no hesitation whatsoever when he pushed up the hem of her skirt. However, Deatrice, stopped his advances thinking that he should not be doing this as soon as he came back.</p>
<p>“No, Lucius.”</p>
<p>She had been so worried about meeting him after so long. She didn’t even know if he was injured or unwell anywhere on his body.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was aware of her hesitation because Lucius started backing down. The man who had been impatiently fondling her thigh has now lowered his hand, knelt down, and asked helplessly.</p>
<p>“Is it really not possible? Even if I do it gently?”</p>
<p>“It’s morning, Lucius.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and let out a sigh, “Mmm.”</p>
<p>Then he kissed her exposed knee. Deatrice thought that Lucius wouldn’t be able to resist, but he stepped back. However, he kissed the inside of her bent knee and looked up at her with a tempting gaze.</p>
<p>“Well, if you say so, then I won’t do it. But I want to do something good for you.”</p>
<p>Deatrice had no idea what his lips following her inner thigh meant. She blushed and pushed him away.</p>
<p>“I don’t like this kind of thing,” she said.</p>
<p>“You don’t like anything you haven’t tried yet,” he replied.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll still hate it even if I try it,” she responded.</p>
<p>“Everyone says that at first,” he replied. He tried to seduce the woman in any way possible, like an immoral man who wants to have his way with her.</p>
<p>The heat was rising and she was also somewhat getting excited. Her throat was dry and her heart was beating faster. Deatrice leaned back against the chair’s backrest, and Lucius knelt in front of her, looking up at her.</p>
<p>“It won’t be so bad, Dee.”</p>
<p>The idea that this should not be done eventually collapsed in anticipation of excitement. Lucius rolled up the hem of her nightgown a little higher. Rubbing his cheek on her thigh, Lucius inhaled the delicate scent of her skin. The tip of his nose was still cold and it jolted Deatrice into pleasure when it made contact with her skin.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad I just woke up.”</p>
<p>He murmured, enjoying her tender flesh. He went further inside, leaving a trail of small kisses as he came closer. Deatrice blushed as she felt guilty about spreading her legs to him so early in the morning. This wasn’t something a responsible lady should do.</p>
<p>Lucius glanced at her reddened face and smiled heartwarmingly.</p>
<p>“If you keep on making that face, I just might get even more excited.”</p>
<p>“D-don’t.”</p>
<p>“You said you love me.”</p>
<p>To her chagrin, he brought it up again. Deatrice said, pushing him weakly on the shoulder. “I didn’t mean it this way.”</p>
<p>“I’m not holding it over you. It’s just that, I can’t stay still after hearing such words from you.”</p>
