            <p><strong>Chapter 129</strong></p>
<p>As she acted proactively, Lucius kept checking her face, as if he had to ascertain that he was really holding Deatrice.</p>
<p>To somewhat alleviate his inner turmoil, Deatrice answered him when he called her name like that. “Yes, it’s me.”</p>
<p>But then he asked so suddenly.</p>
<p>“Do you love me?”</p>
<p>Deatrice couldn’t speak for a moment. Now that she thought of it, six years ago, he also asked this question. He clung to her anxiously and asked as he tried to kiss her.</p>
<p><em>“Did you really love me?”</em></p>
<p>Maybe a part of him was still stuck at that moment when she had coldly abandoned him.</p>
<p>“What about you?” she countered.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Do you love me?”</p>
<p><em>Do you still love me even though I did that to you?</em></p>
<p>He did not answer, but he didn’t seem to actively avoid the question either. Rather, his red eyes that stared at her seemed to say, ‘Answer me first, and I’ll tell you.’</p>
<p>Finally, Deatrice narrowed her brows and answered in embarrassment. “I cannot answer you now.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because…” However, she couldn’t think of any excuses, and she had no intention of leading him on when he still seemed stuck in the past. She didn’t want to give him false hope.</p>
<p>When she didn’t answer, a more certain kind of disappointment spread in his eyes. He uttered directly, “You’re always like that. You never give me any kind of assurance.”</p>
<p>It was he, not her, who had been the difficult one six years ago. That’s why she found his words unacceptable and raised her voice.</p>
<p>“You said we should get married, then we got married. You said to date and we started dating. You wanted a kiss, so I gave you one… What exactly do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You’re always…” His voice trailed and she scoffed. “You don’t have anything to say, right?”</p>
<p>When she intervened sarcastically, he struggled to choose his words, but he still managed to say something at least.</p>
<p>“No, I have. It’s just that you always put me in a hard position.”</p>
<p>“You’re not that different.”</p>
<p>“No. You’re much more, you act like you’ve been thinking all day about how to make me suffer the most.”</p>
<p>Affronted, Deatrice felt her anger rising.</p>
<p>“When did I even do that?” She thought he wouldn’t be able to answer, but he opened his mouth with an expression that indicated he had a lot to say about the issue.</p>
<p>She went to kiss him again, but Lucius tried to push her away for the first time, dissatisfied with her way of distracting him from the argument with this tactic.</p>
<p>However, when Deatrice took off her clothes, all of his resistance vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>What was left were the thin slips one could barely even call clothes. Lucius stared at her exposed body like he was seeing it for the first time. But at this moment, it felt like he was staring at her far longer than before. Like he was committing this sight of her to memory.</p>
<p>“Lucius.” Deatrice, embarrassed by his tenacious gaze, called his name as if to nudge him. Lucius obeyed and buried his face into her exposed chest.</p>
<p>The window was closed, but the room was still filled of cold air and the tip of her pale chest stood stiffly as it felt the temperature dip. Lucius’ lips pressed against her chest and rested his ear on them to feel the frantic beating of her heart.</p>
<p>But unlike the frigid air surrounding them, his mouth was hot.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Deatrice let out a short moan and patted his shoulder. As her knees gradually weakened, Lucius supported her body with his arm enveloping her waist. She clenched his thin shirt.</p>
<p>He slightly bit the pink tip and licked it, stimulating her and sending a jolt in her nether regions. As she surrendered herself to his hands, she remembered the last time she had spent the night with him.</p>
<p><em>I thought I’d never sleep with him again</em>.</p>
<p>Deatrice cut off that train of thought. Truth be told, she liked entwining her body with him. No complications, just the two of them focusing on their bodies and the pleasure they derive from the other’s lips.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>Lucius’s hand slid slowly under her slip. When he saw the flush slowly creeping from her neck to her disheveled face, he felt a certain kind of pleasure filling him up. His fingers didn’t last long before he had her underwear down to her pelvis. As Deatrice laid down on the carpet, her hair became scattered across the floor.</p>
<p>That view aroused him.</p>
<p>The small piece of clothing slid further down her thighs, her knees, then to her ankles in a slow and agonizing manner. When he paused to look at her, she gave a little kick to remove the underwear from her feet. Lucius felt stimulated by that little gesture of hers.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he grabbed her ankle and placed it on his thigh. Since their distance was so short, Deatrice was naturally forced to bend her knees upward.</p>
<p>Her face turned red as her nether regions became exposed because her thighs were spread open. She lowered her slip, which had come down near her belly, in an attempt to cover the bottom. Lucius lowered his head and rubbed her butt cheeks, kissing the inside of her knees and thighs.</p>
<p>The feeling of his defined chin and hardened muscles rubbing against the tenderness of her flesh did strange things to her body. She should’ve felt offended by whatever was happening, but why was she excited instead.</p>
<p>Closing his eyes, Lucius’ touches became slow and docile.</p>
<p><em>“Dee.”</em></p>
<p>It was such a short syllable, yet it was uttered so softly it almost melted her insides.</p>
<p>At the sound of Lucius’ implicit request, the blush on Deatrice’s face heated up even more.</p>
<p>“I love you,” he said.</p>
<p>It was something she never thought he would say anymore. Deatrice thought he might just be using the moment to move her into saying it back.</p>
<p>The thing is, if she heard that a while back, she would’ve felt a pang of pain. But now? It didn’t hurt at all.</p>
<p>He rubbed her feet that was on his thigh and Deatrice let out a slow breath. She saw his face grimacing at her, then felt something hot and soft rubbing against her feet beneath the fabric.</p>
