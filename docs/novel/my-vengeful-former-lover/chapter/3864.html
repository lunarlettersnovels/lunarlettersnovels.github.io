            <p><strong>Chapter 179</strong></p>
<p>“I was talking nonsense. This is so delicious. I don’t have much of an appetite in the morning, so I said some silly things.”</p>
<p>“Well, would you like another cup?”</p>
<p>“If you allow me, I’d like to drink all that’s in the teapot.”</p>
<p>“Then go ahead.”</p>
<p>With a nonchalant spin, Lucius poured tea into his cup himself and brought it to his lips.</p>
<p>While Deatrice was away, Lucius still held the teapot. He covered himself loosely with the blanket he had been using, and awkwardly filled the cup, and it was both amusing and pitiful. But now, Deatrice had returned, and he put the teapot away, showing some leniency to himself.</p>
<p>“You should have come a little earlier. I almost finished it.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? There’s still more than half left. Did you intentionally eat late?”</p>
<p>At that, a mischievous grin spread across his face, revealing a playful side of him that Deatrice found both amusing and endearing. It was moments like these that made her heart flutter with affection for him. She couldn’t deny the fact that she was completely captivated by Lucius.</p>
<p>Deatrice stood there, gazing at him, and couldn’t resist the temptation to run her fingers through his tousled hair. However, as he moved to embrace her waist, she gently pushed him away, worried about her clothes getting wrinkled.</p>
<p>“My clothes will be all rumpled. I have to go pray in a little while,” she said, trying to maintain her composure.</p>
<p>“That communal prayer? Isn’t it amusing, that tradition? Praying for a successful hunt that we don’t even need.”</p>
<p>“It’s a ritual to wish for blessings in the coming year. I’ll also pray for you to return unharmed. Still, do you find it funny?”</p>
<p>With a playful twinkle in her eye, she imitated a stern teacher, placing her hand on her hip as she looked at his adorable face. “If you think that way, maybe this time I should get down on my knees and pray all day,” she teased.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Always be careful with your words if you don’t want to incur punishment,” Lucius responded playfully.</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
<p>Taking his ungloved hand, she kissed it, and Lucius, playing the role of a knight, stood up to wash himself. Deatrice briefly closed her eyes and prayed as he disappeared.</p>
<p>Her heartfelt wish was for him not to get hurt.</p>
<p>However, a few hours later, Deatrice’s prayer returned with an ominous answer.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After Frederick returned from scouting the area with Lucius’s knights, he proposed something to the emperor.</p>
<p>“How about trying to capture them with firearms this time?” he said, with an arrogant tone.</p>
<p>Knowing that Lucius was distressed by the sound of gunfire, Deatrice reacted as soon as she heard his words.</p>
<p>“But they are supposed to be ceremonial prey; capturing them with firearms is not appropriate.”</p>
<p>Her raised voice drew the attention of those around them. Frederick asked with a puzzled expression, “What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it enough to kill them no matter how we capture them? Using a gun would be a cleaner method,” Frederick said confidently.</p>
<p>Sitting on his throne, the emperor pondered momentarily and eventually nodded. He, too, preferred guns over bows or swords.</p>
<p>“You’re right. Let’s try capturing them with firearms this time,” he replied indifferently as if it was an inconsequential decision.</p>
<p>Deatrice clenched her fist in frustration. Lucius became afraid of gunshots and thunder because of his battles. Yet, here he was, speaking so nonchalantly about using guns. With her emotions simmering and her eyes half-lowered, someone reached out and took her hand.</p>
<p>As she lifted her head, she saw Lucius, still smiling as if he found it amusing.</p>
<p>“Are you laughing?” she asked sharply, and without hesitation, Lucius kissed the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>“Because you’re cute,” he replied.</p>
<p>“This is not a time to laugh. How are you so nonchalant about it?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll catch plenty of plump and meaty ones to make you happy.”</p>
<p>“Lucius.”</p>
<p>But Lucius didn’t respond to her call or look back at her. After waiting for the emperor’s attire, he immediately left with the sound of departure, heading towards the forest. Deatrice instinctively brought her hands together to pray, but she soon realized how her prayers had been answered before and lowered her hands.</p>
<p>She chose to believe in Lucius’s words, “Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The forest was covered in white from the snow that had fallen overnight, making it even harder to gauge the distance. The target animals stood out more in the snow. Still, Lucius struggled to focus due to the continuous sound of gunshots echoing through the entire forest, making him sensitive and unable to perform at his best.</p>
<p>“That saying, ‘too happy, becomes clumsy,’ is spot on,” he thought.</p>
<p>The uneventful scouting time had exhausted him mentally, and he could not help but think of Deatrice, who had been overly lovely since morning, further distracting him, and causing him to reveal his vulnerabilities.</p>
