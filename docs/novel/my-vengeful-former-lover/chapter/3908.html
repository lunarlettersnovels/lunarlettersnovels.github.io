            <p><strong>Chapter 135</strong></p>
<p>Skillfully plunging his tongue inside her mouth, he slowly explored her taste once more. Warm and soft, making him feel a tingly sensation. He let his tongue glide over her pearly teeth, then licked and sucked on her bottom lip.</p>
<p>They breathed through each other’s mouths, but Lucius stopped abruptly. Then he stared at her hotly for a good second before he hungrily dove back to kiss her.</p>
<p>Deatrice cupped his face with her palm. But soon enough, her arms were already wrapping around his neck and his hands were possessively embracing her delicate waist.</p>
<p>“Will you be alright?” Lucius broke off the kiss again to ask and distanced himself from her. “Are you doing this because you feel sorry for me?”</p>
<p>“You said you didn’t mind?”</p>
<p>She didn’t raise her voice, but it sounded a bit harsh. Husky, even.</p>
<p>Lucius felt strange. “I don’t mind, but that’s not good for you. You shouldn’t act this way just because you find someone pitiful.”</p>
<p>“But I’m only like this to you,” she said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I said,” her voice, like a small whisper of the night, made the nape of his neck shiver, “I’m only this way towards you.”</p>
<p>Her message wasn’t quite as direct as he had hoped, but it was enough for him. He bowed his head again to kiss her and took off her clothes, ignoring the fact that they had just been coveting each other all night.</p>
<p>The sun was rising and the servants that waited on them behind that door were very much aware of what transpired last night. Of course, the servants of this morning would know too.</p>
<p>Deatrice saw the scars on his body. There was one that looked like a piercing in his upper eyebrows, a long scar on his forearm, and another scar on his thigh that looked like a knife had deeply stabbed it.</p>
<p>“Divine powers can’t fix them.” As he said that, he gently grabbed her hand which had unknowingly moved over to touch his scar.</p>
<p>When he held her in his arms, Deatrice thought it felt so good to be hugged by his strong and firm body. She buried her face around his collarbone for a moment, but quickly pulled out her hand again and placed her hand on the scar on his eyebrow.</p>
<p>Soon a string of white light flowed out of her fingers.</p>
<p>Lucius’ face hardened and he grabbed her hand, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“…you said it can’t be healed by divine powers.”</p>
<p>“Don’t do it,” he breathed out, forcing himself to not tighten his grip on her wrist, “You’ll get hurt.”</p>
<p>“I won’t. Your wounds are nearly healed.” She laughed at his childish, stubborn remarks. After seeing her not taking his words seriously, his expression turned grave as he lifted her face with his index finger to meet his eyes.</p>
<p>“No. Swear to the gods that even if I’m dying in front of you, you won’t do it.”</p>
<p>Her chest felt constricted by the profoundness in his gaze, but she couldn’t just agree with his words. “There’s no way I won’t do it when you’re dying in front of me.”</p>
<p>“Can you swear it for me, hm?”</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t hurt as much as you think.”</p>
<p>“I don’t even want the tip of your hair to be hurt, what more with this?”</p>
<p>After saying that, he embraced her. Deatrice thought that the warmth created by their entangled naked bodies felt so cozy. Even if they were to talk nonsense, it felt like everything would still make sense.</p>
<p>“I think you’re needed elsewhere.” She suddenly said.</p>
<p>Deatrice was concerned because this was the third time that Lucius ignored the knock on the door. He took her hand, displeased because he felt like she was trying to escape from him. If it was up to him, he would keep her here forever.</p>
<p>“I am not.”</p>
<p>With that, he dug into her a little more.</p>
<p>Deatrice pulled up her duvet and covered her body before his kiss developed into something more passionate. “But you need to.”</p>
<p>He stopped when she said that. He didn’t answer for a moment and looked up at Deatrice’s gray eyes. Those eyes looked like they were fog that hid the mysteries of her soul.</p>
<p>Is what they are sharing now love or are they just spur-of-the-moment feelings?</p>
<p>If he went out and came back, would they still be like this? Or will this just be another passing memory like it had been many times over?</p>
<p>He’s afraid things would turn out like that again.</p>
<p>“They’re waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“…alright.” He stood up at her successive prompts and muttered softly after holding her tight for the last time. “Ah. I really don’t want to go.”</p>
<p>However, because it was her order and nobody else’s, Lucius gave Deatrice a lingering kiss on the forehead then finally got up and left.</p>
<p>“I will go.”</p>
<p>The words ‘Be safe,’ were already at the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p>But Deatrice couldn’t say them out loud.</p>
