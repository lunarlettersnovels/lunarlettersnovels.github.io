            <p><strong>Chapter 224</strong></p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>The knight, who came unexpectedly in response to the order, entered the study and greeted with an astonished voice.</p>
<p>He knew that Tom was supposed to be the most loyal of the bunch, sticking by Lucius’s side and serving him like a loyal servant.</p>
<p>But Lucius had no hesitation in questioning the man’s loyalty.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, I just need a report of his activities for the next week.”</p>
<p>“Understood, sire.”</p>
<p>There’s no denying the clarity of that order. The knight eventually bowed and left.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tom, unaware of all this, was contemplating when and how he would bring the prepared evidence and witnesses to the master, making it appear natural.</p>
<p>He wanted to bring it immediately and have the trial open, but it seemed that would draw attention… What should he do?</p>
<p>In the end, Tom gave himself a week. Since it was an important matter, he explained that he needed to investigate thoroughly and quickly, but secretly began preparing for how to approach the master.</p>
<p>He occasionally checked if there were any new items in the market to invest in, and sometimes dealt with investors.</p>
<p>And with the time left, he wrote letters to Deatrice and, if there was more time, went to a good dessert shop to eat the cake he wanted.</p>
<p>Of course, Tom had no idea that his nightly routine became nightly reports on his master’s desk.</p>
<p>After a week passed, early in the morning, Tom gathered the documents containing the evidence and witness list he had prepared, along with detailed information about the judge who would preside over the trial, and headed to Lucius’s study.</p>
<p>Lucius was sitting at his desk, looking immaculate as always, processing papers.</p>
<p>“Master.”</p>
<p>Tom called out to him cautiously, and with a proud look on his face, he lined up the papers he brought with him.</p>
<p>“Our investigation has confirmed that everything Elena Anise said is true. We have secured letters exchanged between Bella Anise and Connor Fenry, as well as the priest who officiated their marriage. We have enough evidence now, but it seems we also need documents proving the Marquis’s involvement. Fortunately, it looks like the trial will be presided over by Kevin Coles, who isn’t particularly fond of the duke.If not him, we also have the paperwork on who will take over here. I’ve got someone who can prove that the Duke bought Elena Anise a mansion and a costume shop, and I’ve even got a list of people who took money from the Duke to slow down the investigation into Bella Anise, so I think that’s enough to tie him in. Plus, I’ve got testimony that the Duke confirmed Connor Fenry’s injuries…”</p>
<p>“Injury?”</p>
<p>Lucius interjected as if he was hearing about it for the first time. Tom quickly realized he’d left something out, and made amends.</p>
<p>“Oh, I forgot to mention. At the time when Bella Anise and Connor Fenry got married… Connor Fenry injured his leg. He had a limp, which was mentioned by the priest, and I suppose the duke heard about it and compared their injuries to see if it was Connor or Chris Fenley who had married Bella Anise.”</p>
<p>Finishing his lengthy explanation, Tom looked at Lucius with a sense of pride. Lucius, who had been examining the documents Tom laid out, spoke with a dry tone.</p>
<p>“You’ve found out quite a lot.”</p>
<p>It was an oddly enthusiastic tone for praise, but Tom willingly took it as a compliment.</p>
<p>“Oh, well.”</p>
<p>“No, really. We had only a week, and… to find out so thoroughly is impressive.”</p>
<p>Tom responded earnestly, suppressing a rising smile. Lucius, after reviewing the documents for a while, spoke with a measured tone.</p>
<p>“I used a lot of people this time. It’s a very important job.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Lucius asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,”</p>
<p>“Anything else you haven’t told me? Like that injury of Connor Fenry or something similar?”</p>
<p>Lucius asked in a teasing tone, lifting the corners of his mouth. Tom vigorously shook his head.</p>
<p>“No. I’ve reported everything.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Tom sensed a strange undercurrent in the air. Maybe he was onto something.</p>
<p>Then his eyes fell on the desk. There, on the cluttered desk, was a pile of papers labeled Tom Wilson. How long has that been there? What’s on it?</p>
<p>Slowly, sweat began to trickle down Tom’s back.</p>
<p>What if those words weren’t compliments, but warnings about something? What if his master had sensed something was amiss and was investigating his behavior these past few days…</p>
<p>Tom swallowed hard at the rising tension.</p>
<p>Had he even realized that he’d sent a letter to Deatrice?</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t seem to notice Tom’s gaze land on the paper. No, it looked like he’d held it out for him to see. Tom clenched and unclenched his fists and squeezed his eyes shut.</p>
<p>“Master.”</p>
<p>But Lucius couldn’t wait to hear more. He’d held out too long. When Lucius jumped to his feet, Tom thought he was going to punch him, and his shoulders tensed and his eyes closed instinctively.</p>
<p>But Lucius just brushed past him. His footsteps grew more distant as he left the room. Tom stood still, dumbfounded, and suddenly began to run after Lucius. It was a little overwhelming to keep up with the fast, distant footsteps. Tom ran as fast as he could to catch up with his master.</p>
<p>“Master.”</p>
<p>“Move.”</p>
<p>Lucius ordered, his face wiped clean of all smiles.</p>
<p>With a face that lacked a trace of a smile, Lucius issued the order. Tom’s persistent pleas had no room for tolerance.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do it on purpose!”</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t pay attention to his ramblings, and opened the door to Tom’s room.</p>
<p>Several times, Tom tried to stop him, but it was to no avail. Lucius had been suppressing this urge for a long time.</p>
<p>Ignoring Tom, he stormed into Tom’s room. Tom tried to block Lucius several times, but there was no effective countermeasure. Lucius acted as if possessed, tearing apart Tom’s room. He threw the blanket, overturned the mattress, and searched underneath his bed.</p>
<p>Tom was thrown against the wall a few times while trying to intervene, had no choice but to watch the clothes and papers fluttering behind him.</p>
<p>In the midst of the chaos, a document with ‘Tom Wilson’ written on it caught Lucius’ eye. At least, that’s how it seemed. Tom’s room was now a mess, with clothes and documents scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>“Lucius rummaged through the desk drawers, throwing everything unfolded aside that wasn’t what he was looking for. Finally, when he forcefully unlocked the last drawer, Lucius stopped abruptly, staring at a familiar handwriting on a letter.</p>
<p>[Deatrice.]</p>
