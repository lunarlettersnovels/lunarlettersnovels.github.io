            <p><strong>Chapter 188 (R18)</strong></p>
<p>“Do you know? Your neck and the area behind your ears are sensitive.”</p>
<p>He spoke in a lowered voice, and as he did, his hand slipped around her waist from behind, following the curve of her back. As he pulled her loose and boxy sleepwear, her soft and elastic breasts were revealed.</p>
<p>Lucius skillfully explored her body, flicking his fingers over her nipples in a way he knew would bring her pleasure. He knew exactly how to bring her arousal to life, and her body quickly responded as intended.</p>
<p>“Lucy… ah.”</p>
<p>Her body felt heavier than usual today. Lucius’s solid form seemed even larger as he remained unyielding on top of her.</p>
<p>The only space Deatrice was allowed was within his embrace. Her hands, once released, gripped his shoulders. His hands handled her breasts roughly as if playing with a toy. He alternated between gentle caresses and pinching her nipples, even teasingly trapping them between his fingers.</p>
<p>As her arousal intensified, her lower body grew increasingly damp. Lucius’s heavy breaths brushed against her skin, right above her. Her hardened nipples seemed to reach out as if seeking something.</p>
<p>Looking down, she saw her breasts cupped in Lucius’s large hands. Her tense body repeatedly lifted her hips, pushing her chest further into his hands.</p>
<p>It was as though she’s begging him to s*ck them.</p>
<p>Deatrice’s face flushed. Indeed, Lucius had the same thought, as he pressed his forehead against hers. Lucius, who had been playfully pinching her breasts, spoke in a low voice that sent shivers down her spine.</p>
<p>“It’s quite fun to touch them. Soft and plump, especially here, so perky as if they’re asking to be put in someone’s mouth…”</p>
<p>His whispered words tickled her ear, cascading down to her waist. Her body trembled involuntarily, even though she hadn’t intended it. Lucius, pinching her nipples with a somewhat rough touch, soon lowered his body and placed one in his mouth.</p>
<p>But unlike before, when he had gently licked and teased, he held it between his teeth and bit down.</p>
<p>“Lucius!”</p>
<p>With a surprised cry, Deatrice called out his name. Lucius shifted one of his legs, spreading hers apart. He pushed his weight down, the relentless pressure against her lower regions mirroring the torment he had inflicted on her breasts.</p>
<p>“Ugh… ah.”</p>
<p>As soon as he pressed against her panties, wetness seeped out. Deatrice tried to follow the breathing techniques she had learned when dealing with him, attempting to steady herself. But her hands involuntarily covered her face, and her lower body squirmed between her chest and legs, unsure of how to react.</p>
<p>Above her panties, Lucius continued to manipulate the sensitive pearl of pleasure, just as he had tormented her breasts before. He alternated between brushing lightly over the thin fabric and gently rolling it between his fingers.</p>
<p>“Mmm, ah, uhh… haah…”</p>
<p>Lucius nibbled and caressed her breasts as if playfully tickling her. Unable to contain herself, Deatrice let out soft moans that sounded like pleas. Her mind felt fragmented as if it was gradually disappearing.</p>
<p>Vague pleasure lingered around her waist area.</p>
<p>Then, his fingers dampened the fabric and entered her entrance. Deatrice gasped for air. Lucius roughly removed her panties, his sweat-dampened forehead brushing against her chest. His hair fell in disarray just beneath his chin.</p>
<p>“Haah.”</p>
<p>“Ah… uhh…”</p>
<p>His low groans echoed in her ears. Deatrice clenched her teeth, listening to a voice that didn’t seem like her own escape through her lips. She endured the sensation of his fingers relentlessly pressing against the moist entrance.</p>
<p>Lucius’s fingers that entered her hole stretched out. The pace was much faster than before, incomparable to their previous encounters. As if engaged in intercourse, his teasing fingers drove Deatrice to the brink.</p>
<p>He playfully expanded his fingers within her, as if toying with the stretched entrance. The tightly pressed entrance gradually opened, allowing cool air to rush in. She screamed and struggled to escape, writhing beneath him.</p>
<p>“Ugh, Lucy… stop, let’s stop.”</p>
<p>Intentionally, Lucius lifted his body, creating a gap between them. As she flipped over, a sound like a ‘pop’ followed, and his fingers withdrew from her depths.</p>
<p>Deatrice, feeling a sense of wanting to stop the dripping sensation, turned over and crawled upwards. Lucius observed her movements as if appreciating how her beautiful buttocks moved enticingly.</p>
<p>He appeared composed, but his mind was a boiling cauldron. Excitement and suppressed emotions mixed and surged within his chest. He was resisting the urge to unleash all these feelings onto Deatrice’s body.</p>
<p><strong>‘Be gentle.’</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘Don’t be too aggressive.’</strong></p>
<p>Despite making such promises to himself, the stimulation overwhelmed him.</p>
<p>Lucius gripped Deatrice’s escaping hips and thrust back into her. Since he had been teasing her with his fingers just moments ago, finding his way was not difficult. She was soaking wet, the flow of her fluids guiding his member in effortlessly.</p>
