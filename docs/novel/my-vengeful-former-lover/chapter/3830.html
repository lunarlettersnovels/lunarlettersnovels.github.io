            <p><strong>Chapter 213</strong></p>
<p>“Deatrice!”</p>
<p>Strength drained from her body. The duke mercilessly grabbed her shoulders and shook her, and Deatrice, as if clinging to her only lifeline, held onto the backrest of the sofa.</p>
<p>“I’ll accept the punishment for what I’ve done. But when you think about it, all of this is just a misunderstanding. It’s a pity that Lucius ended up like that, but wouldn’t it be okay if he was born noble enough to not cause such misunderstanding in the first place? I didn’t do it on purpose, and I didn’t know. Is it fair for you to blame it all on me?”</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t that make sense?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I can’t know whether what Father is saying right now is true or not. So, I’ll proceed based on the assumption that you are lying. Of course, this could also be a mistake. But repaying a mistake with another mistake, is that so wrong?”</p>
<p>“You’re insane. How can you not know what crime it is to your father? Insulting a noble is a serious offense. Moreover, considering what happened to Lucius afterward… Do you really want to see your father’s head roll? You think you can live well without any guilt after that?”</p>
<p>“Father’s head won’t roll. You are someone who saves himself even if it takes drawing his sword against a noble knight of the empire. But I will ensure you won’t be able to set foot in the world of living nobles again.”</p>
<p>The duke scanned his daughter’s determined face. No matter how much he look for traces of his obedient daughter, it felt like she was a stranger to him right now.</p>
<p>And in that realization, Deatrice felt a strange sense of liberation.</p>
<p>The fact that the duke despised her seemed better than him showing affection. Whether he read that sentiment in her eyes, the duke gave up on persuading her and pushed her away.</p>
<p>With her legs giving way, Deatrice collapsed onto the floor.</p>
<p>The determination that had held on until she delivered her message and beyond vanished completely. She could no longer control her body or raise her voice.</p>
<p>Several attempts to withstand the overwhelming numbness collapsed. Deatrice slumped to the ground.</p>
<p>She remained that way for days.</p>
<p>She could feel numerous people coming and going in the room, tending to her. However, Deatrice, with her face buried in the pillow, rejected any touch, pleading to be left alone.</p>
<p>“Please, just leave me alone.”</p>
<p>She had said that so many times. However, it seemed like they all regarded it as nothing more than a feverish tantrum.</p>
<p>Attendants continued to wipe her feverish body and administered medicine. Of course, she had no strength to resist their touch.</p>
<p>Her condition was deteriorating, and the pain was unbearable. As if the wounded soul couldn’t endure it, her body seemed to bear the weight of that responsibility.</p>
<p>Days passed with nothing but suffering. She couldn’t speak or think for several days.</p>
<p>But still, whenever she unexpectedly regained consciousness, it was when the maids mentioned Lucius’s name.</p>
<p>“Madam, Lucius Elliot has arrived.”</p>
<p>During her illness, she had longed to see him so much.</p>
<p>She imagined diving into his cool embrace, kneeling, and brushing her cheek against his thigh. Lucius would gaze down at her fallen form with a pitiful and loving expression.</p>
<p>Warmth and affection would descend on her like sunlight. Then, a slow hand would sweep over her head. Even though it hurt so much, he would still pity her and forgive her, wouldn’t he? If she stumbled through apologies and confessed all her sins…</p>
<p>‘Sorry, please forgive me.’</p>
<p>But as her thoughts reached once again to that ‘sin,’ someone’s heart seemed to be squeezed in pain.</p>
<p>“I can’t see him.”</p>
<p>She stubbornly turned away while the maid, looking embarrassed, kneeled and placed her hand on the lady’s forehead, checking her fever. Muttering with difficulty, the maid said, “But he’s been visiting every day for several days now.”</p>
<p>“I still can’t see him.”</p>
<p>Wearily repeating the same words, she closed her eyes again. And after that, she rejected him several more times.</p>
<p>Amidst the pain, she was certain he must have learned everything by now. Tom must have revealed all the facts, and by now, he would resent and hate her.</p>
<p>He was likely searching for her to unleash that hatred.</p>
<p>However, as her body gradually improved, and sanity returned, Deatrice began to think that perhaps Lucius still didn’t know the truth. If he had come in anger, having heard only her refusal, he wouldn’t have withdrawn so easily.</p>
<p>‘Hasn’t Tom told him yet? Then why is he coming?’</p>
<p>Lying on the bed, she thought dully. She couldn’t understand why he was coming out like that. Then, her mind touched upon their last parting.</p>
<p>“You said you wanted to seek revenge against Deatrice.” The emperor reminded him. He leaned in and said, “And I granted that revenge, Elliot. That is the true reward I bestowed upon you, don’t you see?”</p>
<p>With the emperor’s arrogant voice echoing in her memory, she recalled the chaotic moment when Lucius, broken and defeated, had reached out to her.</p>
<p>“Dee, let me explain.”</p>
<p>“Sorry. I was wrong.”</p>
<p>But she pushed him away and fled without explaining anything, unable to withstand the overwhelming pressure and the weight of the truth. And since then, time had passed without any explanation.</p>
