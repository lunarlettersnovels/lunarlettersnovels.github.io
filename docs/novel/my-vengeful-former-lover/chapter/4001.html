            <p><strong>Chapter 42</strong></p>
<p>What Lucius wanted was for Deatrice to keep to herself, pretend to be sick, and then be gradually forgotten by the people around them. But what if she truly reflected on her past and gave him a genuine apology? Even the ‘Lucius’ who doesn’t love her would be able to forgive her, right?</p>
<p>Deatrice got up from her bed, put on her slippers, and asked the maid who was preparing breakfast.</p>
<p>“Where is Lucius?”</p>
<p>The maid was startled by her voice and became a little weary of her question, but she recovered quickly and responded in a polite manner. “The master is out riding, madam. He will be inspecting the estate afterwards.”</p>
<p>“Oh, is there anything else?”</p>
<p>“None, madam.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Deatrice answered. She lowered her eyes and glanced at the floor. Soon, she felt how the room had quietened significantly.</p>
<p>The maid’s gaze focused on her, and Deatrice raised her hand to cover her face. The servant suddenly appeared nervous about her actions. Carefully, she approached, “Madam, are you alright? Do you feel ill?”</p>
<p>“No, don’t worry. I’m just…” Deatrice sighed and lifted her head.</p>
<p>Her pale cheeks and eyes were bathed in the morning light, making her look lonely and pitiful. “I’m just worried that I’ve been bothering Lucius too much lately. I guess, I must’ve done it unknowingly because I was too pressured to do well right after I moved here.”</p>
<p>She wiped the tears that flowed down her cheeks and touched her wedding ring wistfully. “It doesn’t actually matter to me if I’m doing something or nothing, but if I can’t even do a simple task, people will think poorly of me and that would extend to Lucius too. I love him too much; I don’t want to make him look bad in front of others.”</p>
<p>“Oh, madam…”</p>
<p>Convinced by her acting, the maid soon knelt at her feet and took her hand. “Don’t cry. I’m sure the master knows your heart’s good intentions.”</p>
<p>Deatrice nodded lightly. “I know, and he has shown his love for me even when we’re arguing or whenever I’m acting recklessly. That’s why I’m even more determined to do something for him…”</p>
<p>She let out a sniffle, “I just want to help my husband. Is that so wrong?”</p>
<p>“Poor madam.” the maid consoled, feeling touched. “What’s there to cry about? You can just help him starting now.”</p>
<p>“But how? Lucius has told me to not do anything.”</p>
<p>Oftentimes, Deatrice’s gray eyes appeared cold and unfeeling. But they could sometimes be very alluring, just like now.</p>
<p>Enveloped by sympathy, the maid continued comforting her without ever realizing that she was reacting exactly just as Deatrice had wished for.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, madam. The master will be immensely pleased even if you simply ate together with him. Greeting him when he comes back or sending him off is also a good way to express your feelings.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then… Can we have lunch together today?” Suddenly, Deatrice frowned and sighed regretfully, “I don’t think it’s possible. Lucius is very busy, we might not see each other until tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Sensing her mood turning downcast once more, the maid hastily said. “Not to worry madam! After inspecting the estate, the lord usually stops by the manor, so he will probably be here later. I’ll notify you when he’s back.”</p>
<p>Her face brightened a little and she uttered a soft ‘thank you’ in response.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry, now. Please wait here while I call for Miss Rosalynn.”</p>
<p>“Mn.”</p>
<p>The maid smiled, and she had only left after making sure that the madam was okay.</p>
<p>With only her left alone in the room, Deatrice slowly wiped away her tears.</p>
<p>Of course, she wasn’t naive enough to think that these tears were enough to grant her the position that she wanted. But for the meantime, it was enough. She wanted to move the servants’ hearts and sway their opinion of her. She will not let things go his way.</p>
<p>Deatrice wanted to see him get in trouble because of her, and her little scheme proved to be effective.</p>
<p>The madam’s tears and the reason behind them had spread rumors among the servants and their attitude towards her softened a little. When Lucius had a meal with her, he also noticed this subtle change and he looked at her intently. However, Deatrice ignored his gaze and continued eating her food in peace.</p>
<p>The grilled quail, salad, and all kinds of food laid out today were quite tasty. Thinking she was having a proper meal for the first time, she sliced a thin piece of meat and put it in her mouth.</p>
<p>It was the first time they saw each other again after ‘that’ conversation. It was because Deatrice had been half locked up in the room the whole time and had avoided meeting him. She didn’t want to see him until she had made up her mind to mess with him like she was doing now.</p>
<p>In the end, Lucius opened his mouth first. “Are you feeling well?”</p>
<p>She replied with a calm face. “Of course. I’m feeling better already and much more comfortable now that I don’t have to suffer from the wedding preparations. Thank you for your concern.”</p>
<p>“Really?” he replied, “Are you taking your medicine?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>How can I not take them? Your attendant watches me like a dog and won’t leave until I finish drinking those awful concoctions.</em></p>
<p>But Deatrice held down the words on her tongue and smiled.</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t want to think too deeply about her actions and simply thought that Deatrice’s cool mood was due to the constant medication and the mild season. “I’m glad that you’re doing good.”</p>
<p>“What about you? Still too busy with work?”</p>
<p>“Mn. It has always been like that—endless reports on my desk, and then training with my men who hardly ever listens to me.”</p>
<p>Lucius remembered how his subordinates begged him to introduce his wife to them when he had the chance and was moved. But he hesitated, thinking she wouldn’t be interested at all.</p>
<p>Smiling, he tried to bring back his focus to his meal when he heard a friendly voice. “I’ve heard the stories of you and your knights and learned that you’ve been with them for so long. Since the war, perhaps? Then, you must be very close to them…”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>She continued, pretending not to see Lucius’ bewildered face. “I’m just very curious. I feel like wanting to hear stories about all those hurdles you went through with them.”</p>
<p>At that moment, doubt filled Lucius’ eyes.</p>
