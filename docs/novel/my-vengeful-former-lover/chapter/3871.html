            <p><strong>Chapter 172</strong></p>
<p>Even the unshakable Emperor showed signs of hesitation, so there was no need to explain the impact of the prince’s words. All the nobles confirmed the truth of what they heard and looked around at each other.</p>
<p>“So, Second Prince, are you saying that you will offer me Panimer’s sword?” The Emperor still asked even though he knew it was highly unlikely.</p>
<p>At that moment, the prince smiled as if he had succeeded in his plan.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, my words may have caused a misunderstanding.” He lowered the sword and raised his head to look at the emperor. “Of course, I cannot offer the sword itself as Panimer’s sword is a sword of oath. Once a contract is made, the oath cannot be broken unless the owner dies. Even if I force this weapon on the Emperor, Panimer will become as good as a useless decoration.”</p>
<p>So, everything he had said before was just a scheme to declare that the sword solely belongs to him. The Emperor played along and acted if he was greedy for something he never even wanted in the first place.</p>
<p>Even so, he had underestimated the aspirations of this young man who had been waiting so long for this day.</p>
<p>Frederick politely bowed again and took the sword. “I simply want to offer my assistance since I heard of your struggles against the monsters, Your Majesty. It’s a simple gift, but I hope it will be useful.”</p>
<p>“Simple?”</p>
<p>The Emperor also recognized the prince’s intentions. He got up with an arrogant attitude and held Frederick’s hands that were holding the sword.</p>
<p>“Where else could such a valuable gift be found? You are under no obligation to do such a thing, yet you understand the pain that the empire is going through as if it were your own! Isn’t this the spirit of a great hero?”</p>
<p>Yes, he’ll play along. He was curious of the stage the prince wanted to set, even though he kind of predicted what it may be, and resumed speaking.</p>
<p>“Come, come here by my side! Soon enough, we shall hear all about your noble exploits in the war against the demons in Galaba.” With that, he poured a precious drink and raised the glass to his subjects, “I want to offer a toast to the new hero, Frederick!”</p>
<p>Then the nobleman who had been guarding the Emperor’s side shouted in unison.</p>
<p>“For the hero, Frederick!”</p>
<p>Soon, everyone raised their glasses and repeated the chant. It was like the beginning of a childish play.</p>
<p>Two long hours had passed since the Emperor disappeared with Frederick, presumably for a lengthy discussion.</p>
<p>A messenger arrived at their table, “The Emperor is looking for you.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who had been beside Deatrice the whole time as he comforted her, sat up as soon as he heard the message. But the Emperor’s messenger shook his head, indicating that Lucius was not the intended recipient.</p>
<p>“Lady Louisen,” the messenger stressed and Deatrice stiffened. “The Emperor is waiting.”</p>
<p><em>It was Lady Louisen, not Marchioness Elliot…</em></p>
<p>Her already weary face had become nearly indistinguishable from the whiteness of the dress she was wearing. Annoyed and impatient, Lucius asked on her behalf.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>The messenger side-eyed him and spoke.</p>
<p>“We must not make the Emperor wait for too long. If you’re worried, why don’t you come along with us? So,” he moved to one side and bowed as his arms gestured forward, “shall we depart?”</p>
<p>Deatrice felt as if she were being choked by the urgency and lowered her head.</p>
<p>“Pease wait a moment.”</p>
<p>Even if she was sought under the name of the Emperor, it was glaringly obvious who was standing behind this person.</p>
<p>Perhaps Fredhi had pleaded with the Emperor to meet with her as the latter would want to observe the prince’s reactions. He might even listen to the Fredhi’s words and give in to his requests.</p>
<p>Would Frederick say the things written in the letter?</p>
<p>Although her hands trembled when she thought about the reunion she would have to face, in a way, it was fortunate that things turned out this way.</p>
<p>Deatrice had been tense, wondering what to say, as she stood at the ballroom and waited for Frederick to approach her in front of everyone’s scrutinizing gaze, right beside Lucius.</p>
<p>If Frederick were to ask:</p>
<p><em>“Did you not receive my letter the last time?”</em></p>
<p>What should she say? Should she feign ignorance?</p>
<p>Fredhi had always enjoyed the attention he received and didn’t hesitate to do things that made others uncomfortable to elevate himself even higher. Because of this, Deatrice was genuinely concerned for him. However, Fredhi seemed to have changed after surviving a close call with death and asked to meet through the Emperor.</p>
<p>Deatrice couldn’t deny that rather than avoiding the situation, it was better to meet with Fredhi as soon as possible to resolve the situation. She only had to clearly state that she was happy with her marriage to Lucius and that she didn’t want to ruin their bliss.</p>
<p>When they entered the reception room, they saw the Emperor touching Panimer’s sword. Frederick was smoking as he stared at the approaching pair.</p>
<p>Deatrice ignored Frederick’s gaze on the right side of her profile and knelt with Lucius to greet the Emperor.</p>
<p>The Emperor handed the sword to Lucius and asked him to inspect it.</p>
<p>Lucius briefly examined it and complimented its beauty. His unenthusiastic response meant that he knew that this conversation was just a steppingstone to push back the conversation to the most pressing issue at the moment.</p>
<p>Frederick smirked.</p>
<p>The Emperor laughed, “Is that all? What do you think about its other qualities, such as not being able to change its owner unless that person dies?”</p>
<p>Lucius thought it was unnecessary and its other qualities does not warrant it to be regarded as mythical.</p>
<p>“Unnecessary and undeserving title. Other people consider it a sword that knows honour…” the prince eyed Lucius from his periphery,</p>
<p>“Perhaps the honour it recognizes… isn’t all that impressive.”</p>
