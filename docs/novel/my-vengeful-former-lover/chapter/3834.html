            <p><strong>Chapter 209</strong></p>
<p>The candle flickered in the wind. Deatrice slowly stood up and faced the now aged Bella, no, Elena Anise.</p>
<p>“I was worried you might have forgotten me. Fortunately, it seems like you remember.”</p>
<p>“H-How did you…?”</p>
<p>“My father’s money bought this mansion; would I not know? Can we discuss this? I understand it’s late at night, but I hope for your cooperation.”</p>
<p>Elena blushed and then slowly bent her knees.</p>
<p>“Please come inside, my lady.”</p>
<p>Leading her to the drawing room, Anise shook the pile of things toward the servant, instructing him to bring this and that.</p>
<p>She asked for the fireplace to be rekindled, the most precious tea prepared, and various desserts recited, even checking Deatrice’s reaction to see if there was anything not to her taste.</p>
<p>Realizing that Elena might continue preparing a full late-night feast, Deatrice raised her hand to stop and requested only tea. Elena exaggeratedly bowed her head and bit her lip.</p>
<p>Deatrice was confused whether Anise’s excessive service was out of guilt or if it was the manner she had learned as a noblewoman. It was perplexing.</p>
<p>“So… what brings you on such a late night?”</p>
<p>Six years ago, Elena had ruined a person’s life with her well-played acting skills, but now, faced with an unprepared situation, she couldn’t appear so skillful.</p>
<p>Deatrice fumbled with the teacup. She struggled to restrain the desire to blame this woman for all the dreadful events.</p>
<p>“Why did you do it?” She blurted out, and looked at Elena in the eye.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“No, there’s no need to answer that. It was surely for money, so let me ask you another. Did my father really know that you were not Bella Anise from the beginning?”</p>
<p>At that moment, her face turned pale. Elena, with her whitened face, struggled to deny.</p>
<p>“I–I don’t know what you’re talking about…”</p>
<p>“Oh, please.”</p>
<p>Frustrated by the evasive response, Deatrice pressed her temples with her fingers, feeling a throbbing headache.</p>
<p>“That kind of acting was effective six years ago. You fooled a lot of people, heck, the entire empire. But there is no one here except you and me. No one to appreciate your acting. So just answer me honestly. I came to the mansion you live in at this late hour. Did you think I wouldn’t know the simple fact that you were Bella Anise’s sister?”</p>
<p>“My lady…”</p>
<p>“Answer. Did my father know, and did he ask you to act, or did he find you living in Hasto and brought you here?”</p>
<p>“Your… Your Grace… Oh, please, my lady. I cannot say anything.”</p>
<p>Faced with the relentless questioning, Aniseseemed lost in thought, perhaps recalling the deal made years ago, or the duke’s threats. She pleaded with Deatrice. Sensing that more significant coercion was needed, Deatrice thundered.</p>
<p>“Do I have to bring knights with me, dishonoring nobility, to make you speak? Must a sword be at your throat for you to reveal the truth?”</p>
<p>“Oh, please, my lady. Have mercy. This is my territory. If you knew what have I sacrificed to obtain this place!”</p>
<p>Sacrifice? Deatrice twisted her face, wondering how this woman could utter such words.</p>
<p>“You are not the one who sacrificed anything. Some people… someone… struggled for six years, risked his life on the battlefield and lost everything.”</p>
<p>It seemed Anise realized the identity of the person Deatrice talked about.</p>
<p>Looking at her shocked expression, Deatrice felt disdain and anger for the woman who had discarded her nephew and left him to bleed for six years.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of Lucius’s honor restoration, this woman’s testimony was crucial.</p>
<p>To tug at the frayed edges of Anise’s emotions, Deatrice spoke.</p>
<p>“You must have been aware of Lucius and my connection back then. He is now my husband, and there’s nothing in the world I cherish more. Now that I’ve discovered my father’s role in his downfall, you can imagine how I feel. Allow me to express the anguish I feel upon realizing that the most precious moments of the person I love were callously and senselessly ruined.”</p>
<p>“Your testimony holds the key to unraveling all of this now. So, tell me. How far did my father’s knowledge and instructions extend? I guarantee the safety of your mansion. You stand to lose nothing. I swear on my honor.”</p>
<p>After much hesitation, Anise finally spoke.</p>
<p>“At that time, I was also leading a difficult life. It was an immediate situation where I had to sell myself. I heard the news of my sister’s funeral and thought I could at least gain something to repay my debts. So, I went to that house. That’s where I found the letter…”</p>
<p>“– my sister had been expelled from the estate a long time ago, making a common mistake that women often make. However, it wasn’t peaceful after she left. Soon after, our household collapsed because of my father’s debt. I knew my sister was raising a child alone, and I vaguely sensed the high status of the child’s father, but I didn’t know it could turn into money. Then, using the items my sister left behind, I discovered that my nephew–”</p>
<p>The word seemed difficult for her to say, and after a pause, she forced the words out.</p>
<p>“My sister’s child…”</p>
<p>Anise stopped for a moment, glanced at Deatrice, and then continued reluctantly.</p>
<p>“My sister’s child was engaged to the lady. I initially went to the count to ask for money without revealing the fact that my nephew is illegitimate. But I was chased away without meeting anyone important. So, I went to the duke…”</p>
