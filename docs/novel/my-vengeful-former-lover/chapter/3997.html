            <p><strong>Chapter 46</strong></p>
<p>Because the location of the training grounds was on the mountainside, the carriage ride on the way there was too bumpy. Deatrice suffered a lot and had felt dizzy multiple times, but she couldn’t get out.</p>
<p>She chose this, after all, so she had to endure.</p>
<p>When she sat in front of the gray building and listened to the men’s gruff voices and their swords clanging against each other, she was instantly reminded of Rosalynn’s words and felt worried.</p>
<p><em>“I also managed to get a glimpse of his face once. It looked so cold it felt like he could freeze me to death with a single glance.”</em></p>
<p>She had decided to disturb Lucius today, but right now she hesitated, thinking it might spark another exhausting war of nerves between the two of them.</p>
<p>After deliberating for some time, Deatrice told Rosalynn that she would go for a walk around the area by herself. Partly to get some air and get rid of this annoying motion sickness, but mostly to prepare for the fight that just might be coming after her little stunt.</p>
<p>Birds chirped loudly, and there were the occasional squeaking sounds of small animals. Because of the shade of the trees, the mountain air felt cool against her skin.</p>
<p>Walking down the slope, wearing a light dress and gazing at the lush greenery; Deatrice actually felt refreshed, her headache subsiding a little. She felt anticipation when she imagined how Lucius’ expression would look when he saw her.</p>
<p><em>Right.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s go back now and disturb him.</em></p>
<p>A fleeting thought passed through her mind: that she was simply doing this because she was bored and had nothing else to do instead of it being for the sake of revenge.</p>
<p>She abruptly shook her head and quickly erased those doubts.</p>
<p>As she was about to continue forward, she suddenly heard a cry. But rather than a loud weeping, it sounded more like a suppressed sob and Deatrice wondered who it was.</p>
<p>She walked cautiously, planning to take a peek at the person’s face. Soon, she found a man by the creek, washing a bundle of thick clothes with his face dripping with tears.</p>
<p>He had a pretty face with his dark blue hair. Judging by his appearance, he seemed like someone who had just passed his puberty.</p>
<p>Normally, she would have just walked away, but since the men’s clothes were familiar uniforms, Deatrice simply remained standing there.</p>
<p>When he finally looked up and saw her figure a short distance away, he was almost startled to death. He quickly stood up and wiped his tears.</p>
<p>“How did you find this place? Are you lost?” he asked with wide eyes.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Deatrice asked.</p>
<p>“Why are you crying?”</p>
<p>The man’s face lit up, but then his expression turned despondent once more.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, it’s nothing. But… my mother…” his voice croaked. He couldn’t hold back his tears and it streamed back down onto his cheeks.</p>
<p>Seeing him crying so sadly, Deatrice thought that his mother had passed away.</p>
<p>He hurriedly wiped his cheeks with palms all wrinkled after being soaked in the water too long. “My mother sent me a letter, saying she wanted to see me. Her health isn’t good these days, so—<em>sniff</em>—I’m just a little worried…”</p>
<p>Deatrice stared at his face filled with snots and tears.</p>
<p>“A ‘little’?”</p>
<p>Embarrassed, his reply came a little too quickly. “I-I’m just the type of person who cries a lot.”</p>
<p>She chuckled, feeling as if she was talking to a younger brother, and with the corners of her lips raised nicely, her face had that quality to it that appeared quite different from her usual cold face.</p>
<p>The man looked at her smiling face, charmed. “M-my name is Jerry Atkins. Pardon me, but… may I ask what your name is?”</p>
<p>It was common for names to be exchanged in situations where they are interested in the other party, whether it be solely as a friend or something more.</p>
<p>Silence fell at the end of his words.</p>
<p>Deatrice had already seen his cute and vulnerable side so she thought there was nothing wrong with letting him know. But at the same time, since he was a member of the Knights of Lucius, it was obvious that he would be terrified once he knew her identity and would apologize that he didn’t recognize her sooner.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to go through a situation that would just happen a little later anyway. Therefore, Deatrice smiled slightly and responded politely.</p>
<p>“I need to go.”</p>
<p>Atkins blushed and nodded.</p>
<p>She was about to walk away, when she abruptly stopped and turned back to ask him. “If you want to see your mother, why not take a leave of absence? Don’t they allow it under these kinds of circumstances?”</p>
<p>“They do.” he said, then added weakly, “But it has only been a short while since I came back…”</p>
<p>“So? Don’t you still need to go?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“To your mother.”</p>
<p>Deatrice uttered, as clearly as possible, “The future is full of uncertainties. If you’re this worried and crying for her sake, I think it’s only right to go and see her.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>Atkins’ eyes accidentally met with Deatrice’s unswerving gaze and the rest of his words were swallowed back into his throat. Then, he nodded his head obediently and said, “Yes, I understand.”</p>
<p>Deatrice smiled, thinking he was still too pure and naive.</p>
<p>Then she left.</p>
