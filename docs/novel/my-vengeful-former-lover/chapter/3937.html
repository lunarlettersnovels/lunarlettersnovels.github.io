            <p><strong>Chapter 106</strong></p>
<p>It was obviously a joke, but Deatrice’s shoulder’s stiffened when she heard the subject she had been consciously trying to avoid during her stay here.</p>
<p>Lucius, who was sitting on the sofa and watching Deatrice, also went silent. A momentary surge of guilt and discomfort flooded his nerves. Going by their strange reactions, Raymond realized he may have touched upon a sensitive topic for the couple.</p>
<p>Privy to the knowledge that her brother’s marriage would only last for less than a year, Dixie blushed at her husband’s mistake. She swiftly rang her bell as a distraction. However, her maid mistook the bell for Young Master Philip’s late meal and subsequently came into the parlor with the food.</p>
<p>When Dixie smelled the dish, her stomach became upset and there came her severe morning sickness. Holding back her nausea, she covered her nose and got up from her seat, shouting.</p>
<p>“How could you bring Philip’s food here?! You know how sensitive I am to that smell!”</p>
<p>When his mother yelled his name and became angry, the child opened his eyes and looked at her. Soon, the nanny came in and hugged Philip, taking him away. The servant bent her knees in guilt and Dixie beckoned her to get out.</p>
<p>Her stomach was already upset. Even after the servant had left, she kept her hand against the wall, face white, as she resisted nausea.</p>
<p>Servants were accustomed to asking for permission from the guests. After that, they opened the windows wide for added ventilation. Deatrice moved Dixie closer to her and wrapped her arms around the latter’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“You should go back to your room.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Hurry.”</p>
<p>At Deatrice’s urging, Dixie withdrew from the wall. Raymond bowed his head in gratitude and Deatrice smiled back, then she supported Dixie out of the living room.</p>
<p>Assisting the pregnant woman up the stairs, Deatrice felt her hatred for her starting to disappear.</p>
<p>When Lucius confessed that Dixie also knew about their imminent separation, Deatrice was outraged. But now that she had seen how different Dixie was as a mother and wife, her dislike for her started to vanish.</p>
<p>She thought to herself that Dixie was only a human being, and at the same time, also another person who had nothing to do with her life after she left. Whatever her soon-to-be former sister-in-law would do in the future no longer had anything to do with her.</p>
<p>She would already be far, far away from here for anything to matter, anyway.</p>
<p>Deatrice thought while staying with Dixie as she changed her clothes and climbed onto the bed. Deatrice reached out her hand so naturally that Dixie didn’t realize that their relationship was awkward a few days ago—nay, moments ago— for them to hold hands so intimately.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Dixie still clasped her hand.</p>
<p>“Shall I say a prayer?” Deatrice closed her eyes and brought Dixie’s hand to her mouth and said a prayer. Dixie thought that hearing Deatrice reciting prayers in the old language felt strangely comforting.</p>
<p>“I heard that my brother was injured. You must have been very surprised. Deatrice.”</p>
<p>After a brief prayer, Dixie opened her closed eyes and spoke. Deatrice answered with a smile on her lips. “Yes. He made me wait all night. I prayed the whole time for him to come back safely. But when he came back, he fell into my arms.”</p>
<p>With Deatrice describing it, Dixie could picture out what happened in her head.</p>
<p>Although Lucius and Deatrice didn’t display affectionate glances or say sweet words when they arrived, Dixie instinctively noticed that their relationship had become more intimate. She could see it in the nuances of their actions.</p>
<p>They may look like they were keeping their distance from each other, but it still felt like they were so much closer, like something was binding them together that wasn’t previously there.</p>
<p>Dixie speculated that the incident in which Lucius was injured probably had a profound effect on their relationship. It seems that Deatrice had mistaken Lucius ’weakness when he was in pain, for love.</p>
<p>She felt pity for the beautiful woman in front of her. “I believe my brother managed to return safely due to your prayers. Ah, right. Do you want to put your hand on my stomach?”</p>
<p>“My hand?”</p>
<p>“To feel the baby’s movement. It is good if you are to pray for a child as well. So, will you?”</p>
<p>Deatrice did not respond, but Dixie gladly took Deatrice’s hand and placed it on her stomach.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because she was overcome with excitement, but Dixie really wasn’t yet at the stage where she could feel the baby kicking aggressively. But when Deatrice’s hand made contact with her belly, she felt something moving ever so softly against her palm. Then little by little, it grew in strength until it tickled her skin.</p>
<p>Dixie knew that feeling those was such a comfort, that’s why she recommended it.</p>
<p>Deatrice smiled faintly, closed his eyes for a moment, and said her prayers.</p>
<p>Dixie, who had learned the ancient language intermittently, could not understand exactly what Deatrice was saying, but she could roughly understand words such as ‘new’, ‘life’, and ‘blessing’. She also understood ‘Huipus’, which was the holy name of her son, Philip.</p>
<p>Dixie’s eyes widened in surprise that Deatrice knew his name.</p>
<p>“Deatrice?”</p>
<p>Deatrice only smiled softly, “Philip will be sad if I only pray for the new baby.”</p>
<p>Those words made her sound like a family. Dixie suddenly thought that just as Deatrice had prayed for Lucius, she might’ve also prayed for her little family seeing that she already knows her son’s holy name. A name she hadn’t revealed.</p>
<p>As a devout believer, Deatrice might have not missed a single time of prayer that may have included her family…</p>
<p>She had always treated Deatrice as nothing more than a woman who would disappear in a year. This was also the reason why she decided to be a little nicer to her, even if she had to do it on a superficial level.</p>
<p>Realizing the gap between them, Dixie felt a slight sense of guilt, which was further intensified by her pregnancy.</p>
