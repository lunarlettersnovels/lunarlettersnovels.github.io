            <p><strong>Chapter 231</strong></p>
<p>She was a small woman with long black hair and a plump body.</p>
<p>“Oh, black hair, huh? Miss Vivian also has dark hair like mine,” she said, remembering Brian’s words as soon as she saw her.</p>
<p>Even when no one could easily attach words to a stranger like Deatrice, Brian said so. “Come to think of it, the new teacher seems quite similar to Miss Vivian.”</p>
<p>“He’s probably coming to marry Miss Vivian.”</p>
<p>Deatrice recalled another remark Brian had made a few days ago. At that time, he had brushed it off according to the absurd reactions of people. But if that was really the reason why the Emperor sent Lucius here…</p>
<p>Seeing the unfamiliar woman holding Lucius’s hand was so bizarre that she couldn’t easily tear her eyes away.</p>
<p>“Madam… No, Miss. Here’s your things.”</p>
<p>The knight handed the basket full of butter to her absent-minded hand. The knight frowned as if embarrassed, alternating between Lucius and Deatrice, then finally followed Lucius.</p>
<p>Deatrice watched Lucius, who was left alone, talking to the strange woman. She squinted her eyes and when Lucius spoke to her, the woman, with a pitiful expression, clasped her hands together and replied with “What?” Unable to take her eyes off him, Deatrice saw the knight carrying the child and gesturing to the temple.</p>
<p>The father of the child, who was doing guard duty, also nodded continuously in greeting before starting to run towards the temple. People exclaimed in admiration towards Lucius, who appeared like a protagonist from a fairy tale, saving the child and even sparing a glance for the distressed Lady Boviki.</p>
<p>But amidst all this, Deatrice was remembering Lucius’s urgent words.</p>
<p>“Are you insane?”</p>
<p>She remained in place, numbly watching until Lucius and Lady Boviki disappeared into the carriage. It occurred to her belatedly that she should have fled as soon as she saw him. How could she dare?</p>
<p>He was there. Running towards her with worry…</p>
<p>Deatrice bowed her head. Emotions that she had tried so hard to suppress rushed over her like a flood, but she held them back. It was simply an unexpected reunion.</p>
<p>Ever since she heard the news that he was coming to Ponto, Deatrice had vowed never to encounter him. But that vow became meaningless the moment he arrived.</p>
<p>It had been so long since she last saw him. Still handsome, but there seemed to be deeper lines of suffering around his eyes. Deatrice quickly reached out to touch where he had vanished. As expected, there was nothing… Every moment had vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>“Are you insane? Doing something like this again.”</p>
<p>Those words repeated in her mind over and over. The tone was filled with the same concern and bewilderment as before. But at the same time, Deatrice knew exactly how it all ended.</p>
<p>“Why are you just standing there? Aren’t you going to pack up and leave?”</p>
<p>His dry tone and the sight of him leaving without any lingering attachment.</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s really over now.”</p>
<p>Deatrice muttered to herself. It was truly over now.</p>
<p>However, Lucius had a different perspective from Deatrice in that moment.</p>
<p>He considered that perhaps this wasn’t the end of it all.</p>
<p>Watching Deatrice’s surprised expression and her blank stares, as if confirming her longing, Lucius was sure. Despite her departure, something remained alive within her, deep in her heart.</p>
<p>Sure, Deatrice’s suspicions, derived from the letter she sent to Tom, hinted at it. She hadn’t left him in disgust. All the words spoken in the duke’s reception room were merely aimed at pushing him away.</p>
<p>But the crucial point wasn’t why she did what she did, but rather whether what lingered in her heart was strong enough to withstand everything.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you how surprised I was. It’s never happened before.”</p>
<p>As Lucius was lost in thought in the carriage, Lady Boviki went on about the incident’s impact.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard stories lately about poor folks deliberately rushing carriages to demand money, so I guess my heart moved defensively without me realizing it. My father always said I was too naive, and that I should never show such vulnerability to those beneath me. Besides, when the carriage changed direction, I bumped shoulders with someone, and the outside noise was unsettling. Perhaps my guards spoke to the child’s father in that manner because they had heard such ominous rumors. They’re usually kind people.”</p>
<p>She seemed to be making excuses, embarrassed by her hesitation over the child’s life. Meanwhile, Lucius’s presence in the carriage added warmth, and her layered dresses contained the heat and excitement.</p>
<p>Vivian tried fanning herself to cool down her heated palms. At that moment, Lucius’s gaze shifted to her. It was only then that Vivian realized her actions might have been misinterpreted as a plea for attention, causing her face to flush.</p>
<p>Lucius’s red eyes briefly scanned Vivian’s face.</p>
<p>“In any case, I think it was a compassionate decision to show the child to the priest.”</p>
<p>He spoke in a gentle tone. In fact, he felt somewhat grateful to the woman in front of him. The cost of treatment at the temple was quite high, so it wasn’t an easy decision to make. If Lady Boviki had insisted on taking the child to a priest, Deatrice would have continued to worry about the child’s injuries.</p>
<p>So how could he not be thankful for Lady Boviki’s decision to quickly take the child to the temple to be seen by a priest?</p>
<p>“Oh, it was nothing. After all, it was because of me that the child got hurt. Besides, the guard said his rib was broken, so with such a serious injury, how could I not send him to a priest?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if it caused you trouble.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, that’s not what I meant…” Vivian blushed and even waved her hands. “I was just impressed by how well you knew about injuries. Are all knights like that?”</p>
<p>Lucius quietly smiled at the somewhat clumsy question, intending to continue the conversation.</p>
