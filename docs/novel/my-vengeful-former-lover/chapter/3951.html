            <p><strong>Chapter 92</strong></p>
<p>He may have said not to think too deeply about what might happen, but they still had to weigh things twice, even thrice. However, his warmth and his caresses called to her like a moth to a flame, making her feel a tenderness she had not once felt for the six years he had been gone from her life.</p>
<p>Deatrice pulled him closer and pressed their lips together—this was her answer to his unspoken question.</p>
<p>The kiss that followed was shorter than the first, just enough to slightly quell the growing heat in the pit of their bellies and leave them wanting for more.</p>
<p>Deatrice’s naked body had been touched multiple times when she was being bathed and dressed, but <em>that </em>and Lucius’ touch were entire worlds apart.</p>
<p>He was a man that made her feel like a woman in every sense of the word. His large hands dwarfed her own, and the strength that hid behind them made her feel safe in his arms.</p>
<p>The tension in Lucius’ body became more prominent and Deatrice could feel him making the effort to not hurt her with his grip. As Lucius’s hand caressed her waist, a piercing sensation unknowingly prodded at her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>Already in disarray, their clothes barely covered anything now. Initially, Lucius gestured for her to raise her arms so he could undress her, but he stopped when his attention was caught by the supple breasts that teased him to no end.</p>
<p>The moon didn’t help, as it shed its light to illuminate the tantalizing pinkness of her nipples, begging to be ravaged.</p>
<p><em>This woman’s body is too… </em>He closed his eyes and reined in his beastly desires.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time he’d seen a naked woman. Knights would usually pay prostitutes to spend the night with them and have the fun of their life because they could be dead the next day.</p>
<p>Lucius was startled at first, to the point he would leave the tent and smoke outside. But as time passed, he learned to ignore it and made himself comfortable in his makeshift bed when two or more couples f*cked right next to him.</p>
<p>Occasionally, there were those courageous women who wouldn’t leave after they were done with their ‘services’ and sneak into his side when they saw Lucius’ face.</p>
<p>He had nervously pushed them back numerous times and told them to leave him alone, but during the process, he had come to learn what the female body looked like.</p>
<p>But the woman in front of him was something else, full in all of the right places. Her bulging breasts with those stiff nipples and the delicate curve of her waist made his member harden even more.</p>
<p>“Who bathes you?” he suddenly spat out.</p>
<p>Deatrice looked at him with furrowed brows, confused as to why he would ask a nonsensical question.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the moonlight, her skin shone a milky white and every bit of an ethereal goddess. Lucius couldn’t resist kissing her forehead and licking it gently with his tongue.</p>
<p>He whispered.</p>
<p>“From now on, you bathe by yourself. The servants might have lewd thoughts just by looking at your body. Or,” he paused and looked at her, “I can help you instead.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be absurd. Unlike you, everyone else doesn’t have such indecent minds.”</p>
<p>“It only means they hide it better.” Lucius, whose nose was dangerously close to her breasts, couldn’t bear it anymore and bit her pink bud.</p>
<p><em>“Ah!”</em></p>
<p>She arched her back, bringing her chest closer for him to feast upon, and her thighs clamped together. Deatrice felt herself moistening down there.</p>
<p>She wrapped her hands around his hair and tugged, letting him know that she was feeling the pleasure.</p>
<p>Lucius wanted to continue teasing her, but then he pressed his chin against Deatrice’s belly and kissed it afterward. He lowered his hand and pulled at her flimsy nightclothes.</p>
<p>From being drowsy, Deatrice’s body tensed noticeably. She increased the pressure of her grip on his arm and Lucius slipped a finger through her thin underwear.</p>
<p>His finger was immediately drenched by her wetness, and he could feel her inner walls clenching. The softness of her nether lips was the most intimate place he had ever touched, and he gritted his teeth, willing himself to be more patient.</p>
<p>Deatrice’s nail dug deep into Lucius’s arm.</p>
<p>“Ah… ah!”</p>
<p>Lucius fondled her breasts and rubbed the clitoris hidden between her folds. Deatrice showed a pained expression and Lucius decreased the strength of his rubbing. Instead, he cupped her labia and kneaded her sensitive spots with his palms.</p>
<p>The feeling of his big hands touching her most private place terrified Deatrice. Her face turned red as his hand touched her pelvis.</p>
<p>“W-what… What are you…”</p>
<p>Lucius stole a glance at her.</p>
<p>A flushed expression, chest heaving up and down heavily, and small beads of sweat running between the valley of her breasts—he cursed inwardly. He pressed down on her thighs, caressing them slowly.</p>
<p>His blatant rubbing made Deatrice’s nether regions even wetter. Blushing, she struggled to grab his hand to make him stop. But with every flick of his finger, her attempts were thwarted and she could only tilt her head back and moan.</p>
