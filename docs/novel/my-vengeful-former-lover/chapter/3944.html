            <p><strong>Chapter 99</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it already time for our meals?</em></p>
<p>After checking the time, Deatrice got up and went down to the dining room. After the banquet, Lucius continued to have dinner together with her. He didn’t do anything special, but no matter how busy he was, he would always make time for it.</p>
<p>Deatrice realized now that there was no point in asking Lucius why he was doing this. She just thought that he was doing this because it was helping him in his plans to show he was the good partner between them.</p>
<p>Thinking that she would never die of old age in this mansion with him, she felt more at ease when she thought that there was an end to her little life. But whenever a sudden and cold wind tickled her, she remembered the night when she slept on his arm and made eye contact with him numerous times.</p>
<p>“You’re here.”</p>
<p>The face in her memory was sitting at the end of the table as she glanced up from the ground. Deatrice knew in her head that he was the same person, but at the same time, she couldn’t shake the thought that the person he was then and the person he is today are vastly different people.</p>
<p>What’s clear is that, the ‘him’ during that night very much felt like her ‘Lucy’ from six years ago. But now he was simply Lucius. Although he sometimes becomes Lucy, most of the time he treats her like Lucius.</p>
<p>As she sat down with those inane thoughts, the food arrived. Starting with light dishes, Deatrice slowly ate the food that was served. Lucius suddenly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Dixie sent us a letter today.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” he answered in a flat tone, “She’s bearing another child.”</p>
<p>Although Deatrice isn’t related to this child by blood, it was still her nephew by law and Lucius’ blood relative. However, when he discussed his sister’s pregnancy, his voice was cold as if he was discussing the matters of a stranger.</p>
<p>Looking back, sometimes he really did act terribly callous. Deatrice thought that he probably wouldn’t be so kind to his own child, especially if it was hers.</p>
<p>She drew a picture of what she would have been like if she had conceived that night. Maybe he would either calmly tell her to abort it or accuse her of infidelity… She lost her appetite just by thinking about it.</p>
<p>Deatrice said, putting down her knife and fork. “We should go and visit her then.”</p>
<p>“Yes. You should choose the gift.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“It would appear more sincere if you picked one yourself for your sister-in-law’s pregnancy gift.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m busy as well. If you are truly unable to choose, just tell Tom to arrange it.”</p>
<p>After the banquet, Deatrice had nothing to do. She nodded her head politely. “Alright, I’ll make sure to choose a suitable one.”</p>
<p>“I’ll send several catalogs to your room, so you don’t have to worry. Oh, and…” Lucius said with a small smile, “From now on, I want you to take over the manor’s internal affairs.”</p>
<p>At his unexpected words, Deatrice’s gaze was skeptical.</p>
<p>“Are you alright with this?”</p>
<p>“It would be unnatural if you’re not the one doing it. There are many rumors that Pekka’s slogan and this banquet was successful thanks to you.”</p>
<p>He raised the corners of his mouth and smiled charmingly. “From the moment I entrusted the relief work to you anyway, I knew that inevitably I had to entrust the mansion under your care as well.”</p>
<p>Deatrice wondered if she should thank him for that.</p>
<p>Lucius’ handsome face was looking at her, seemingly hoping for something. But soon, he bowed his head and continued eating.</p>
<p>Deatrice stared at his blonde hair and said, “Then, it would be difficult to find fault with me now.”</p>
<p>The place was teeming with servants, but she didn’t hesitate with her words. Lucius wasn’t surprised. He didn’t expect her to be careful with him either way and responded calmly.</p>
<p>“I know.” he sipped some of his wine, “Then will you have an affair for me?”</p>
<p>At his words, Deatrice could feel the shock and astonishment emanating from the servants who heard. Lucius just smiled complacently, uncaring about the onlookers’ thoughts.</p>
<p><em>He only thinks of winning.</em></p>
<p>Deatrice narrowed her eyes and gazed at him with distaste, but she kept her mouth shut. However, she thought in her mind that it might really be beneficial for her to start a new relationship with someone else.</p>
<p>After all, when their marriage is annulled, she planned to spend the rest of her life in a temple in Alhen. Saying her prayers and doing the same thing every day wasn’t that much different from her present life. Her food and clothing will be scarce, but if she donates all of the money that Lucius had given her to the temple, they probably wouldn’t treat her too badly.</p>
<p>Thus, before committing herself to a lifetime of near seclusion, it wouldn’t be bad to enjoy the company of someone who doesn’t have hidden motives or impure intentions.</p>
<p>Someone who isn’t Lucius.</p>
<p>She pondered his suggestion seriously.</p>
<p>After spending one night with Lucius, her heart longed for love yet there was no love for it to receive. It just made her feel emptier more than ever and it filled her head with strange thoughts.</p>
<p><em>If I am to follow his suggestion, who should I choose as my partner?</em></p>
<p>Her forehead slightly creased together in contemplation and glanced at every man in the dining room. But wherever she looked, there was no one up to par with Lucius.</p>
<p>In terms of appearance, Lucius stood out even in the capital, so it felt like she was looking for a needle in a haystack and no one caught her attention even back then.</p>
<p>It would be fun if she could flirt with them comfortably, but it would be best if they at least looked… pleasing to the eyes.</p>
<p>Deatrice’s bored gaze moved and suddenly stopped at Atkins who stood  in front of the door. She tilted her head, lost in her thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Hmm.</em></p>
<p>He would do just fine. He might be young, but Atkins was much better compared to others.</p>
<p>There were a lot of ladies who had affairs with their guards, so if everyone found out about her relationship with the knight, they wouldn’t be too surprised.</p>
<p>Deatrice smirked as she pictured herself kissing Atkins—</p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p>She shook her head. No one else should be a victim in her marriage with Lucius. Her conscience wouldn’t be able to stand it if she ruined the poor knight’s life.</p>
