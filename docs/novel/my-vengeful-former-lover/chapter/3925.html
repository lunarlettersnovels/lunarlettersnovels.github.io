            <p><strong>Chapter 118</strong></p>
<p>Lucius thought about it for some time and not long afterward, he remembered a letter from the Empress and Wilton that came a few days earlier. He jumped up, found the letter he had discarded somewhere, and eventually sent an affirmative reply to what should’ve been a response of rejection.</p>
<p>All because of the owner of those gray eyes, who now looked at him with fierce anger. Naturally, he was also aware that she knew what he said was just an excuse.</p>
<p>“Lucius.”</p>
<p>She called his name harshly.</p>
<p>But Lucius simply smiled sweetly. He let go of the arrow and it whizzed through the air before it hit the target dead on.</p>
<p>Deatrice said as she brushed her hair ruffled by the wind.</p>
<p>“You know of that man’s and my father’s friendship. I wonder what would happen if he suddenly heard through Wilton that we stayed in separate rooms and would soon annul our marriage?”</p>
<p>He paused and raised a brow, holding one more arrow and looking back at her as if he had just changed his mind. “If you’re here to request that we sleep together in the same room, you should’ve just said so earlier.”</p>
<p>Her figure, clad in a green dress and her dark curly hair scattered about, was like a faun romping out in the wilds.</p>
<p>Does she know how beautiful she is when she’s angry? The sky darkened because it must’ve felt her fury. Like her soul was connected to it.</p>
<p>Lucius spoke slowly, suppressing the desire to surrender to her beauty. “So have you thought about it?”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>With languid eyes, he said calmly, “When I asked you to date me.”</p>
<p><em>Scum.</em></p>
<p>Deatrice clenched her fist. It was so ridiculous she couldn’t even speak.</p>
<p>Was he insane? He invited strangers to their place to create a situation where they had no choice but to share a room together.</p>
<p><em>So, what about our relationship?</em></p>
<p>At this point, Deatrice was already seething with rage. She pulled an arrow out of his quiver, grabbed his collar, and pointed the arrowhead against his crotch.</p>
<p>“I did whatever you asked me to do because I was told to do it. Get married? I obeyed. An annulment? Fine, I’ll agree.” she suddenly pushed the arrow closer to his nether region, “But if you still have the basic sense of humanity, you shouldn’t push me into an abyss because of your lust.”</p>
<p>Red eyes stared down at her with no reaction to the sudden threat to his crown jewels. There seemed to be no rebellion or remorse for her words at all. Rather, he moved even closer to her like he couldn’t feel a weapon pointed against him.</p>
<p>The tip penetrated through his clothes and lightly grazed his skin.</p>
<p>“After that night, you have always appeared in my dreams.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You don’t know the terrible feeling I have to endure every morning.” His warm hand touched the arrow and ran his fingers down to her hand.</p>
<p>Deatrice glared at him, trying not to loosen her grip on the shaft.</p>
<p>“So, are you threatening me right now because you really wanted to be close to me?”</p>
<p>Then he laughed.</p>
<p>As he burst into delighted laughter, the arrow that shifted towards his neck didn’t faze him in the slightest. Eventually, she lowered her hand in exasperation.</p>
<p>Lucius wiped the blood from the nape of his neck.</p>
<p>“My love is so naive. Do you think I would do something you really hate? I can easily move into your room if I wanted to, why would I need an irrelevant outsider’s help?”</p>
<p>She raised her eyes, scrutinizing him, but at the same time, she couldn’t help but be shaken by his words since they felt like a surprise to her.</p>
<p>Looking back, his stubbornness started when they were in the Bell’s mansion. As he was kicked out of her room, didn’t he dare kiss her on the forehead? He was the one who smiled after saying she was cute back then.</p>
<p>But looking at Lucius now, grinning at her with his own blood dripping down the nape of his neck, his smile seemed to be insignificant and borderline sinister.</p>
<p><em>Bastard.</em></p>
<p>Not so long ago, she thought she was somehow holding onto his leash. But little did she know that a leash was meaningless to a rabid dog.</p>
<p>Deatrice threw the bloody arrow at his feet.</p>
<p>Lucius dipped his right hand in his blood and turned around to watch her stomp back into the manor.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The war hero and master of the house had a pretty deep cut on the neck. Coincidentally, the lady was seen washing her bloody hands in a nearby fountain.</p>
<p>Although several servants saw this spectacle, the couple swiftly ended the rumors by saying they would sleep in the same bedroom.</p>
<p>The bed in Deatrice’s room was replaced with a much larger one and some of Lucius’ luggage had already found its way inside her wardrobe. After fussing over the place for a while, the redecoration was finished.</p>
<p>The servants looked at the lady, who was strangely silent, and then to the master stiffly standing next to her with a bandage around his neck.</p>
<p>It was odd, to say the least. Fortunately, the master’s moving in can be considered a peaceful affair.</p>
<p>Separated by a changing screen, they donned their nightwear and then lay on the bed. Even if nobody was there to monitor their every move, they subconsciously maintained their neat appearance.</p>
<p>Lucius even laughed as he noticed her moving rigidly. But soon after, he realized he was in the same bed with her for the first time after that fateful night and was unable to move.</p>
<p>And it was the same with Deatrice.</p>
