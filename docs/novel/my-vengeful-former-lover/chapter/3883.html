            <p><strong>Chapter 160</strong></p>
<p>At a time like this, who wouldn’t wonder the look on her face when she heard that her dead fiancé would become king in five years?</p>
<p><em>Now, look at the face of the woman who blew every chance in search of love.</em></p>
<p>Everyone thought so.</p>
<p>From that day onwards, articles about Deatrice were slowly adorning the front pages of newspapers. Their efforts to somehow link the prince and her, who has been living in the duke’s house for several months, with the prince, can be said to be genius.</p>
<p>Some even recall Lucius and Deatrice, who seemed estranged from each other at the duke’s wedding, and in fact, did not know about Fredhi’s survival from this time, maybe Fredhi contacted the duke or Deatrice first. So, they guessed.</p>
<p>As expected, after the publication of the article, several pieces emerged to refute it. These counter-articles emphasized that the prince couldn’t possibly harbor any goodwill towards the duke, who had caused him so much pain.</p>
<p>Moreover, they argued that it was highly unlikely that he wouldn’t have contacted her before reaching out to the duke.</p>
<p>They pointed out that it was time to pay more attention to diplomacy with Galaba, not the enemy triangle.</p>
<p>Through a series of events, the duke chose to return Deatrice to Northum. It was because she could not be displayed openly at the duke’s house where his guests came one after another.</p>
<p>Not for the sake of her own daughter, but for the fatal mistake of the duke, which people remembered whenever they saw her.</p>
<p>She immediately packed her things and boarded the carriage back to Northum.</p>
<p>Winter had set in, and with it came the preparations for the social season in Northum. Despite the late hour, Deatrice’s servants, including Rosalynn and Tom, who had been dispatched to attend to Northum’s affairs during their extended stay at the Duke’s residence, came out to the hall to greet her.</p>
<p>Perhaps everyone had heard that Fredhi was alive, and their attitude towards her was a little awkward. Rosalynn was looking at her with her eyes already filled with concerns and said her words. Deatrice went up to her room after briefly thanking the people who had been taking care of the mansion well despite the owner’s absence.</p>
<p>The room was so intact that it was not felt that it had been left empty for four months, and perhaps that’s why Lucius’ absence couldn’t be felt more than that.</p>
<p>Before changing her clothes, Deatrice took out Lucius’ letters from her luggage, kissed it, and prayed briefly.</p>
<p><em>‘Please send him back to me.’</em></p>
<p>She felt the rustle of the paper on the tip of her lips.</p>
<p>Whether it was because of her fervent prayers or because she thought he had made it all right, two days later, early in the morning, Lucius returned with the knights.</p>
<p>Deatrice awoke with a rumble, and looked out her window to realize that he had truly returned.</p>
<p>As soon as she identified the crowd of the knights, she tucked her feet into her slippers and went out wearing only a robe over her nightgown. The maids who met her in the hallway stopped and stepped aside when they saw her running.</p>
<p>As Deatrice ascended the stairs, she caught sight of a striking blonde with a handsome face, still clad in his uniform. It was clear that he had just returned.</p>
<p><em>‘Lucy.’</em></p>
<p>Deatrice wasn’t sure if she had spoken her thoughts out loud or not, but she knew that as soon as Lucius arrived, she was awakened to his presence. With a sudden burst of energy, she flew down the stairs, leaving behind a few pieces of her wardrobe, and leaped into Lucius’s arms.</p>
<p>His arms were wide and, above all, warm. Enough to forget the chill of a winter morning.</p>
<p>“Lucius.”</p>
<p>Now, what she said was definitely right.</p>
<p>She too could hear her voice quivering terribly.</p>
<p>“I missed you.” Lucius answered her call and took her in his arms and kissed her on the forehead. His soft lips touched her cheeks and even her lips. ‘Me too,’ she whispered back and hugged him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[To Lucius.</p>
<p>It’s a night where I’ll feel like an idiot no matter what I say.</p>
<p>Since I received your letter last time, all my language is out of order.</p>
<p>No matter what I think about, it feels like it has been cut in half and its meaning is empty. You said you dedicate yourself to me, but I think if there is anyone who has been deprived of something, it is me.</p>
<p>Lucy. Will the day come when I can answer your noble heart?</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean I don’t love you. To be sure, I love you.</p>
<p>But I don’t know. Why do I keep feeling like something is missing?</p>
<p>You gave me a ring and said I don’t have to carry the burden of the past. I didn’t mention the word forgiveness, just in case my language would set our place, but your eyes were saying it.</p>
<p>That you forgive me.</p>
<p>But how can I accept your kindness when I haven’t really asked for forgiveness. Sorry for being a coward. And I apologize for everything I did six years ago.</p>
<p>I miss you. I am plagued by thoughts and feelings that I dare not describe in a few words.</p>
<p>If I could meet you, Lucy, how nice it would be if I met you right now. I fall asleep imagining riding a horse to you.</p>
<p>Your Deatrice.]</p>
