            <p><strong>Chapter 167</strong></p>
<p>Deatrice looked up at his eyes a little arrogantly and then slapped his wrist with a glove she hadn’t yet put on. Lucius hesitated a little, then he soon put his hand away and she whispered, slipping her hand seamlessly into the glove, “Don’t think you can get away with this by acting pitiful. But just know that you’ll be scolded by me for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p>Should he be sad or happy about that?</p>
<p>In any case, the word “rest of your life” was mentioned, so Lucius was a bit pleased by that and smiled, albeit awkwardly.</p>
<p>When they left, they were obviously sitting across from each other, but when they arrived, she was already resting her head on his shoulder. She wasn’t the kind of girl who would fall asleep anywhere and let her hair get messy, but when she was with him, Deatrice felt comfortable enough to let her guard down.</p>
<p>“Did I sleep like this?”</p>
<p>Deatrice stood up in shock and touched her hair. Lucius helped her with a hand gesture and straightened her slightly disheveled hair.</p>
<p>“You sleep too much these days. Perhaps you are pregnant?” he uttered a bit expectantly.</p>
<p>“What?” At that, her busy hand flashed to a stop. Deatrice, who hastily counted the days with her fingers, let out a deep breath and shook her head. “No.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” his expression fell. “But you slept in the living room last time…”</p>
<p>“How many times should I tell you that I was writing a letter and not sleeping?”</p>
<p>“Why are you acting so shy right now—”</p>
<p>“Lucius!”</p>
<p>The corner of Lucius’s mouth went up as he made fun of the frightened woman. However, it was true that the expression on her face remained in her heart. At the mention of a child, her features became contemplative, and she started counting the days to see if it was possible.</p>
<p>Obviously, before marriage, she used to mention wanting to have a child. However, that wish was thwarted when she reunited with a vengeance-filled Lucius. Now, when mentioned in passing that she might be pregnant, her face turned pale in denial.</p>
<p>That was pretty hard to watch. Especially since he knew it was because he had hurt her. This only goes to show that their relationship isn’t yet as stable as it seems and there were still lingering fears in her heart.</p>
<p><em>If she is truly pregnant…</em></p>
<p>One of the lawyers he sought legal advice from had uttered as soon as he heard the problems that Lucius brought up.</p>
<p><em>“If a child is conceived, it would be difficult to break the marriage between the two of you. Even if she wanted to get away, she would have to think of the child’s welfare first.”</em></p>
<p>He was repulsed by the idea. But he was haunted by the fact that he might lose her to the ghost of that damn prince ever since he heard the news.</p>
<p>Getting her pregnant was the easiest way to ensure that he wouldn’t lose her outright.</p>
<p>It was difficult to overcome the urge when he knew he shouldn’t even think about it in the first place. The very notion of using a child to shackle her to him was disgusting, but at the same time, he had to admit that it was somewhat tempting.</p>
<p>But in a world where even a child can be removed from the womb by medicine and other methods, he couldn’t even berate her if she chose that path.</p>
<p>“Dee.”</p>
<p>Lucius called her impulsively, wanting her to get out of the carriage first. Deatrice just turned her head and looked at him.</p>
<p>Lucius tried to smile and whispered three words.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p><em>Nothing is more precious than you. I can’t stand it if I were to lose you again</em>.</p>
<p>It was a blessing, of course, to have words that could replace his clingy mind. She answered with a light smile.</p>
<p>“I know. I do love you too, Lucy.”</p>
<p>It assured him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was no longer a secret that the second prince of Galaba had returned alive with Panimer’s sword. Therefore, society was expecting Deatrice’s return all this time. This news was pushed out of the top of the list only when there was a brief water crisis in the capital and the mansions of the nobles were flooded. But soon after, the season began and it resurfaced as the hottest gossip again.</p>
<p>“Rumors regarding that couple won’t settle down even after they have gotten married.”</p>
<p>“I know, right? It’s been the same even back when they were dating.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they aren’t the perfect pair.”</p>
<p>“But when she was with the prince, she was always at peace, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s nice and not boring. I wonder how they will overcome this hardship…”</p>
<p>Mrs. Florander fanned briefly, and the nobles who were present were silent for a moment, as if they had time to pick their own cards before each game.</p>
<p>The ‘hardship’ they referred to was divided into two according to their position. It was about whether the prince would claim that the couple’s marriage was invalid because their engagement had not been officially rescinded. The other would be to either convince or force the pair to have an annulment, and then he would naturally claim Deatrice once she was a single woman.</p>
<p>It is more reasonable that the prince might choose the latter approach, but the former will also be an interesting sight. Of course, there was a hidden third option and that was to make Deatrice a widow. But none were courageous enough to voice out such words.</p>
<p>“I think the lady will get pregnant.”</p>
<p>“I think so too.”</p>
<p>“If that happens, the prince will have no choice but to give up.”</p>
<p>“But will they really come up to the capital?”</p>
<p>A naive, noble lady asked. No matter how much she thought about it, she thought that a couple who had no children to strengthen their bond would not come and face this hardship head on.</p>
<p>But someone quickly criticized the stupid remark, and the lady quickly dropped her tail.</p>
<p>“Of course! There is no way that the emperor’s most trusted man will not be attending the emperor’s birthday.”</p>
<p>“Ah… right.”</p>
<p>“What about the prince?”</p>
<p>“Well, he might want to boast about his sword.”</p>
<p>“Then the three of them will finally meet.”</p>
<p>“With the prince and the knight’s position completely reversed.”</p>
<p>A woman stuck between a former fiancée who was thought to be dead and current husband. Now, all three of them would be reunited in one setting. Who wouldn’t want to look forward to such an intriguing affair? Even a passing dog would wander around the palace if it heard the rumor.</p>
