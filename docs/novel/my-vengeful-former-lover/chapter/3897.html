            <p><strong>Chapter 146</strong></p>
<p>Because the bride-to-be is so busy, she wasn’t able to spend much time with Deatrice. While the two of them were talking in the lady’s room, several dogs came to her feet, dividing her attention, along with the many other people who would knock on her door from time to time. But she, as if she had something adamant to say, was unmoved by these interruptions and continued conversing with Deatrice like nothing happened.</p>
<p>“…so I hope things won’t get awkward between us.” The lady stated her point at the end.</p>
<p>“While it is true that I will step in as your mother, I will not even pretend to be close to you or fight covertly with you, as some others do, since I have no intention in taking your shares. We will reside in different regions anyway and will not see each other very often. I do not know what light you view me in because of my statements but know that I am no coward. I only wish that we do not needlessly strain each other in the future. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>It was a pretty direct statement.</p>
<p>Deatrice was silent for a moment and looked at the puppy sleeping in front of the window. It was because Deatrice also had a topic she was hesitant about how to bring out.</p>
<p>Deatrice, who dithered a little, started to speak.</p>
<p>“Around three months ago, my father sent me a maid. By any chance, is she yours?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Do you know nothing about this?”</p>
<p>As if taken aback by the sudden remark, the lady blushed for a moment and then shook her head. She wondered if she meant infidelity, but while she was embarrassed, she seemed to admit her denial was the truth.</p>
<p>“No, I know. Yes, that is my maid.”</p>
<p>“Then you must have heard why he sent that maid to me.”</p>
<p>“He did not tell me in detail. But…” The lady frowned as if she was embarrassed, but soon she covered her face and said, “I know what she did.”</p>
<p>It was an honest answer, so Deatrice stayed silent.</p>
<p>With that, she could somehow picture what kind of person this lady is. Not easily offended and does not like to lie. She isn’t a very curious person either.</p>
<p>Of course, Deatrice was not in a position to make any judgments about her father’s decision, but somehow, she felt fortunate to have a person like this chosen as the future duchess.</p>
<p>When Deatrice didn’t answer anything, the lady dragged out her words in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“If you are worried about her speaking out of line, have no fear. She must have just said it to me because I am her lady, and I am not a light-mouthed person. I’ve been careful enough there.”</p>
<p>Her words strayed as if she was feeling a bit guilty. Deatrice smiled and shook her head.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to worry. I am just asking to make sure.”</p>
<p>“Make sure?”</p>
<p>“If you know about me and my father’s situation.”</p>
<p>In short, it was a question that may sound a bit rude because it was like she was digging for the lady’s influence on her father.</p>
<p>The lady blushed for a moment. It seemed that she was also the type of person who wears her heart on her sleeves.</p>
<p>“James—<em>pardon</em>. The duke doesn’t really talk about you and is usually just quiet. I don’t feel upset about it. I would not fancy my past being talked about either. So, you don’t have to worry that I might learn secrets about you. Even if I found out about something, I wouldn’t gossip about it nor would I use them against you.</p>
<p>Deatrice smiled and lightly bowed her head.</p>
<p>“I am pleased that the woman my father will be marrying is you.”</p>
<p>At the sudden remark, the lady showed a confused expression, but she soon relaxed her face and held out her hand with a weak smile. It wasn’t common for women to shake hands, but Deatrice was happy to take her hand.</p>
<p>The woman’s hands felt pleasantly warm.</p>
<p>Probably because she was holding the puppy all the time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On one side, Lucius is having the most uncomfortable night of his life.</p>
<p>As it was a duke’s marriage, many nobles, especially the duke’s relatives who were dissatisfied with his marriage with Deatrice, gathered together and every step he took was met with contempt.</p>
<p>He had to force himself to sit down because he had something to discuss with an acquaintance, but seeing those selfish glances directed his way made him inwardly seethe.</p>
<p>If only they had the guts to raise their hands in objection to the marriage that the emperor arranged like how they raise their chin in disdain at him today, maybe they would’ve accomplished something.</p>
<p>But no, they can only babble behind those wine glasses after a long time like the cowards they are.</p>
<p>In the end, Lucius couldn’t stand the irritation and asked to be excused from the table to get some fresh air. Then he got up from his seat and went outside.</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>Passing through the crowded corridors, Lucius suddenly thought that it would be better to find Deatrice instead. Seeing her face right now sounds much more appealing than getting some fresh air.</p>
<p>He changed his trajectory from the balcony and turned to climb the stairs, but the person coming out of the hallway on the right did not notice him and bumped into him.</p>
<p>Lucius quickly apologized and picked up the glasses that fell on the floor.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” he uttered as he turned around while extending the glasses to the other person.</p>
<p>“Thanks…”</p>
<p>However, as soon as the other saw Lucius, she stiffened.</p>
<p>The familiar hateful expression that he had received all day before was also on her face. Not wanting to exhaust himself with unnecessary arguments, Lucius gave a short laugh and tried to turn around to leave, but an urgent hand grabbed him from behind.</p>
<p>“Sir Elliott, I am Sophie Willaden. If it is possible, I’d like to have a short chat with you.”</p>
<p>The surname Willaden was one used by priests. Lucius frowned and was still a little dumbfounded as to why this particular priest disliked him, but he readily nodded his head and came down the stairs.</p>
<p>“You may talk.”</p>
<p>Noticing they were still surrounded by noisy people, she continued, “I wish for us to be in another place. It’s about the lady.”</p>
<p>Well, she’s caught him at the duke’s wedding. So, of course, she would want to talk about the duke’s daughter.</p>
<p>Lucius steadily moved ahead and led the priestess in the direction where no one could overhear them.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he didn’t really expect her to tell him any meaningful stories. Like a man obligated to put up with a fight in order to smoothen things out as much as possible, he intended to simply listen as she says her piece and then leave as quickly as he could.</p>
