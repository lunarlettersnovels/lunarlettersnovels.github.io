            <p><strong>Chapter 152</strong></p>
<p>Soon, his soft lips touched her cheek, comforting her. She closed her eyes and those lips soon slid down from her cheeks to her soft lips.</p>
<p>Deatrice parted her lips and apologized, “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Lucius smiled as he peered into her face at close range.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be.”</p>
<p>However, Deatrice’s heavy heart was not relieved by his softened attitude, and she poured out a confession.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to make you anxious. I just don’t understand myself either. I was feeling uncertain that it made me so uncomfortable. That maybe I’m doing you wrong—”</p>
<p>“Dee.”</p>
<p>Her words were sweet, and Lucius half wished to die.</p>
<p>He felt sorry for being so stubborn and leaving her alone for two days without any explanation. And now, he has to go again soon.</p>
<p>He would definitely come back without any big deal, but it was clear that he had meaninglessly wasted precious time.</p>
<p>Lucius took out the ring in his pocket abruptly.</p>
<p>Before he opened the door, he had promised himself not to be impulsive. But when it comes to her, he felt like none of his plans ever really came to fruition. He knelt with a sentimental thought that he had no choice but to surrender in front of her all the time.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t let this be a burden for you. Still, I want to tell you that if you’re carrying the weight of the past, you don’t have to. The past is nothing compared to what you mean to me now.”</p>
<p>Fragments of emotion flashed across Deatrice’s face.</p>
<p>On the surface, it looked as if she was force-fed food that she didn’t like. Others could easily interpret it as a negative reaction, but those who stayed by her side long enough could tell that it was her unique expression when she was moved.</p>
<p>Lucius smiled lovingly and kissed her hand. Her immature appearance, which is rare for Deatrice, could not be any prettier than this.</p>
<p>“This is that ring?” She uttered softly and took the ring from his palm. Lucius remembered the time they had an argument and blushed a little.</p>
<p>“You guessed it?”</p>
<p>“A bit, but I really wasn’t sure if you would give it back to me. These past two days, I thought you’d thrown it in the bushes somewhere.”</p>
<p>“What did you view me as?”</p>
<p>When he frowned, she smiled and stroked his eyebrows. Holding down the thin fingertips that tickled his face for a while, he said with a sigh. “Actually, I have to go.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“A work trip.”</p>
<p>“Work trip?”</p>
<p>Those two words made her feel uncomfortable again. Was that why the emperor took him away and talked to him earlier? Perhaps she thought that the emperor did not know anything about Galaba and Frederick. Then, will Lucius fight Fredhi?</p>
<p>“To where?”</p>
<p>Deatrice asked, unable to hide her anxious tone. Lucius put his finger between her fingers as he smiled mischievously.</p>
<p>“To Capod. There are only monsters there, so there’s nothing to worry about. The emperor said he would bring reinforcements soon after.”</p>
<p>Capod was the exact opposite of Galaba. With a sigh of relief, Deatrice nodded her head. But she couldn’t believe it when she saw Lucius getting up and packing his things, so she couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“Are you leaving now?”</p>
<p>He nodded his head as if he had no choice but to go. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! Who only prepares for the departure in half a day and just goes?”</p>
<p>“Since the emperor came here directly himself, there is nothing I can do about it. Maybe it’s an urgent matter.” Lucius replied in a docile and loyal tone to coax her.</p>
<p>But Deatrice couldn’t stand the emperor using him in this unpredictable manner. If he wasn’t an illegitimate child, the emperor wouldn’t dare treat him like this.</p>
<p>A simple knighthood would not have been enough to repay the debt he incurred after Lucius saved him.</p>
<p>As she bit her lip and looked down, he stopped packing his things and lifted her face with a smile. Then, after staring deeply into her eyes for a long time, he said quietly.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>It was a sudden confession.</p>
<p>At a moment like this, she didn’t know how to react, so Deatrice was even more surprised. She pursed her lips, pressured that she had to say something in reply after such a statement. But Lucius stopped her and engulfed her small frame in his strong arms.</p>
<p>“Not now, respond after I’ve returned. When your heart is ready, and your feelings have grown stronger.”</p>
<p>They have already been married and the nights they had spent together made him more determined. It didn’t really matter if she wouldn’t say the same exact words back. He can wait.</p>
<p>But as soon as he comes back, he wanted to receive her most genuine and unfiltered answer.</p>
