            <p><strong>Chapter 45</strong></p>
<p>As soon as the unrestrained servant went out, the room immediately became quiet.</p>
<p>Lucius glanced at the bed of roses through the glass of his closed window. As it was summer, those flowers blossomed vibrantly and the fragrance they suffused had only become even stronger.</p>
<p><em>Why is her smell so similar to that garden?</em></p>
<p>It didn’t look like she had been walking in the garden for long periods of time for her clothes to soak in all of its scent. So, could it be that her terrace is always open, and that was how the smell of roses had permeated her body?</p>
<p>Lucius narrowed his eyebrows and was immersed in useless thoughts when suddenly, a brunette maid holding a wicker basket appeared.</p>
<p>Then, she began plucking some roses.</p>
<p>Seeing that only the most beautiful flowers with healthy-looking petals were selected, it must be because she was preparing it for the bath water. At that moment, Lucius felt as if the riddle in his head had been solved.</p>
<p><em>So, the scent from her body came from her bath…</em></p>
<p>The window was still closed and there was nothing but hot air across his skin, but it felt like her scent was dominating his senses once more.</p>
<p>At the same time, his thoughts wandered.</p>
<p>Touch of her lips against his cheek, her body that touched him closely, and her waist that can be embraced with one hand, the few strands of hair running along her face, and her slender neck…</p>
<p>Lucius scowled.</p>
<p>Annoyed at himself for reliving the memories, he vigorously shook his head.</p>
<p>But it was futile.</p>
<p>After seeing the maid picking flower petals, strange pictures kept popping up in his head—a maid cleaning rose petals, scattering them inside the bathtub and pouring perfume afterwards…</p>
<p>Then, the image of Deatrice’s delicate body gradually lowering itself into the bathwater caused him to curse out loud.</p>
<p><em>Why am I thinking of this? I’m not even horny!</em></p>
<p>However, the imagination started, he could no longer stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>The sensation of holding Deatrice’s twisted ankle during their wedding reminded him that he saw the pale skin of her legs under her skirt. He didn’t think much of it at the time, but why now, did it feel as if he was on fire?</p>
<p>That night after their wedding, even in his drunkenness, he could clearly recall Deatrice wearing those flimsy nightclothes. He could see the hazy outline of her shapely body when it was exposed by the candles behind her.</p>
<p>Now, Lucius’ roving mind imagined her to be wearing the exact same thing as she slowly soaked herself into that rose-scented bath water. Those petals clung to her smooth shoulders and a few of them slowly slid down from her collarbone onto her bulging chest.</p>
<p>He felt like a pervert, but he simply couldn’t stop himself from imagining. He couldn’t.</p>
<p>The smell of roses finally pervaded into his study and another image of Deatrice passionately kissing him instantly surfaced in his head.</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>It’s been a long time since he had an erection just by imagining something that had never actually happened, and Lucius finally had no choice but to hit his head against the desk.</p>
<p>He also had to get rid of the thought of that brunette maid wiping every inch of Deatrice’s naked body with a towel…</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile…</p>
<p>Presently, Deatrice had her hair braided, and was reading a book with one elbow resting on a desk. Warm sunlight illuminated the inside, and the pleasant smell of garden roses subtly permeated within the room.</p>
<p>Before, she felt terrible about the fact that the only things she got from this marriage were the ring and this room. But now, she would be lying if she said she wasn’t attached to it.</p>
<p>This room was smaller and less dazzling than her room back at her paternal home, but it had its own charm.</p>
<p>“Is it done?” Deatrice spoke and raised her head to look at her maidservant.</p>
<p>Rosalynn looked outside through the window, nodded her head, then grabbed Deatrice’s gloves and hat from a coat rack. She silently placed a glove on her mistress’s hand, but she paused.</p>
<p>Eyes half-closed, Deatrice could see Rosalynn’s expression and recognized that she was hesitating.</p>
<p>“What is it? Just say it.”</p>
<p>As if waiting for her words, Rosalynn raised her head with a face full of worry. “M’lady, must you go today?”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“I overheard servants gossiping. They said that Sir Elliot—<em>no</em>—the master hasn’t been himself for the past two days. He had always been friendly, so the servants were flustered seeing him acting so differently.”</p>
<p>Rosalynn lowered her voice, “I also managed to get a glimpse of his face once. It looked so cold it felt like he could freeze me to death with a single glance.”</p>
<p>“Oh? I didn’t hear anything about that.”</p>
<p>Rosalynn nodded. “Yes. They also say it doesn’t even look like a problem from his territories or his knights…”</p>
<p>And what else could the cause be if not for ‘that’?</p>
<p><em>Did he figure out my intentions? </em>Deatrice bowed her head while pondering Rosalynn’s unfinished words.</p>
<p>Except for the territory and the knights in Lucius’ life, all that was left was the manor. And aside from him (and his sister), the only one who could mess with that place was Deatrice.</p>
<p>Of course, Deatrice knew she did nothing wrong in the past two days, but she thought it was suspicious that he was avoiding meeting with her.</p>
<p>“What if it’s really because of me? I need to set things straight.”</p>
<p>“But if you suddenly visit the Knights Templar without prior notice, won’t he be mad?”</p>
<p>Deatrice smiled brightly and giggled, “It’s romantic and sweet, why on <em>earth</em> would he be mad?”</p>
<p>That smile showed her unbending stubbornness.</p>
<p>Although she hadn’t made a fuss these days, Rosalynn knew better than anyone that Deatrice was planning something twisted. Probably because of the ill-treatment she had received here, and the feelings of heartache from having to lower her stature in order to face him.</p>
<p>With her mistress’s actions justified in her heart, Rosalynn decisively tied the hat on Deatrice with a thick blue ribbon.Taking a step back, she saw Deatrice grabbing her parasol and sauntered her way out the door, then she subsequently trailed behind her.</p>
<p>They brought small tokens and snacks with them to be given to those knights and put them in the carriage. Even if her husband was the commander of the Knights Templar, women shouldn’t show up there unannounced as it would be deemed very unladylike.</p>
<p>But Deatrice thought it would be very fitting for her to go there, especially since these knights had already been through a life and death battle with him, so it shouldn’t be that big of a big deal.</p>
<p>Moreover, she wanted to see Lucius with a confused look on his face.</p>
<p>When she arrived, it wasn’t so easy to get in. But that didn’t stop her from walking straight forward without even a pause in her steps.</p>
