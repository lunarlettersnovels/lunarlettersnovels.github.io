            <p><strong>Chapter 61</strong></p>
<p>“Compared to what you’ve experienced, all I can say is that it was peaceful.” Deatrice didn’t want to exaggerate and say that she was tormented. “So, does this mean you would constantly leave the house for the time being?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, until a conclusion is reached or if there’s something worth reporting. You’ll be free to go out tomorrow, so don’t be afraid. Just follow my orders, and I suggest a knight to protect you temporarily.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he passed by her and opened the door.</p>
<p>He had answered everything she asked and Lucius seemed convinced that she had come to him because of today’s confinement.</p>
<p>Deatrice subsequently went out as well.</p>
<p>She followed Lucius back down the lobby and as soon as a few knights saw Lucius’ face, they stopped whatever they were doing and stood in attention.</p>
<p>Deatrice was still two steps above the stairs than Lucius, but she looked at them from the same eye-level as him.</p>
<p>One by one, Lucius introduced the knights to Deatrice.</p>
<p>“This is Vice Commander, Joseph Spencer. The three behind him are Matthew Pinter, Gordon Selby, and Jerry Atkins. They are the people who will protect and escort you starting tomorrow.”</p>
<p>When he finished speaking, the knights greeted her and bowed.</p>
<p>But Deatrice remained silent for a while without receiving their salutations. Even at a time when Lucius had to fight the infested monsters, she still had her doubts.</p>
<p><em>Would they really just protect her only? No other hidden agenda?</em></p>
<p>Deatrice grabbed Lucius’ sleeve and pulled it. “We need to talk.”</p>
<p>“So suddenly?”</p>
<p>Even as he said so, he was pulled along without much resistance. Deatrice went into an empty pantry and closed the door.</p>
<p>Lucius said, looking curiously at the food stored in the tightly packed shelves. “I didn’t know there was a place like this in our home—”</p>
<p>“You! What in the world are you planning?”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes at him and Lucius stared back at her with a languid gaze.</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie to me, I saw them back at the training grounds. Why would you hand over these knights when they play an important role in your squad? Do you think I’m stupid?”</p>
<p>“I have no intention of lying. Yes, they are important people, but that’s exactly why I’m giving them to you. ”</p>
<p>Deatrice’s face turned grave. “What will happen to you if you don’t have them with you?”</p>
<p>Despite her seriousness, Lucius had a somewhat bored countenance.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your concern, but being short of four people isn’t enough to make my knights as miserable as you make them seem. Furthermore, it’s not an exaggerated number. Almost everyone keeps this number of guards by their side at times like this. So don’t be stubborn and just accept it.”</p>
<p>She still protested.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to have four people to protect me. You’ve already increased the number of guards protecting the manor anyway.”</p>
<p>“Defending the manor is different from your guard’s priority of protecting you at all costs.”</p>
<p>“Lucius.” Deatrice called out his name with a sigh.</p>
<p>Lucius had no intention of making concessions in this matter anyway, so he just stood tall, half-listening to her call. But Deatrice’s tone was enough to shake him.</p>
<p>“Don’t think too much. I’m just worried that you’ll get hurt under my watch and I’d have to feel guilty over it.” Lucius said, seemingly in an exasperated manner.</p>
<p>“Why would you even feel guilty?”</p>
<p>“You’d get hurt because of me.”</p>
<p>Lucius suddenly frowned and pursed his lips. His red eyes darkened as if he had realized the identity of something disturbing.</p>
<p>He asked in a low, disconcerting voice.</p>
<p>“Are you worried for me?”</p>
<p>Despite his rapid switch in attitude, she wasn’t all surprised and simply focused on convincing him.</p>
<p>“You go out hunting monsters, but I’m stuck here…”</p>
<p>However, Lucius was no longer interested in her words. His thoughts had only been confirmed when he looked into her eyes and analyzed her face.</p>
<p>He murmured lowly, “Do you really think you can unsettle me with a simple word of concern?”</p>
<p>Deatrice was immediately confused.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Do you think that I like you?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t keep up with the flow of conversation. Why would worrying mean that she wanted his affection? He even spoke as if Deatrice was taking advantage of that matter to get close to him!</p>
<p>Lost for words, Deatrice just stared at him with a dumb expression. “What on earth are you going on about?”</p>
<p>“Because the way you’re behaving right now is the same as when I was courting you.” Lucius looked at her with a half-lidded gaze. “Is this your scheme? To gain the upper hand in our relationship and make me fall in love with you again by acting so concerned over me?”</p>
<p>Hip red eyes narrowed into slits, piercing her with his gaze.</p>
<p>Deatrice bit her lip and swallowed the words that were about to come out of her mouth. But she was still confused.</p>
<p><em>His ears are red…</em></p>
<p>For a moment, it occurred to her that she could use it as ammunition and fight back. But it was a double-edged sword, she didn’t know the outcome if he truly confirmed his desires for her.</p>
<p>Deatrice tried to lower her voice, as if to placate him.</p>
<p>“I never thought of that, Lucius. I’m just worried about you. I wouldn’t oppose it if the four of them take turns protecting me, but only two at a time. The other two can stay back at the Templar and attend to other more important matters while waiting for their turn.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Also,” she added, “don’t be so mean if you feel like you’ve got the upper hand. You never know, your conclusions just might be wrong…”</p>
<p>Then she giggled.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like it would make any sense to continue talking. Therefore, Deatrice opened the door and left. However, she still felt bitter because she was just being genuinely worried about him.</p>
<p><em>He wouldn’t easily change his mind either way.</em></p>
