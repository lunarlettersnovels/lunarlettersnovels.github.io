        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 130</strong></p>
<p>A rush of heat rose as her inner walls tightened so abruptly.</p>
<p>Lucius’ forehead touched her knee and his soft blonde hair scattered in front of his eyes. He slowly lowered his hand to the inside of her thigh, down to the crumpled silk slip. He spread her legs apart and Deatrice turned her head.</p>
<p>His fingers touched that sensitive place between her legs and, for her, it felt embarrassing to let him feel the state of her womanhood.</p>
<p>He whispered to her ear, “You’re wet.”</p>
<p>There was a small puddle of smooth liquid below them. Lucius rubbed his finger, pressing it near the entrance where her liquids flowed out. Deatrice’s heart was beating loudly. Without notice, his fingers pried her entrance open.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Deatrice let out a short moan, both out of pleasure and a tinge of pain.</p>
<p>“Shh. I’m sorry,” He apologized for the urgency and turned his head to tenderly kiss her thigh, but he didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>Lucius became a little persistent again. He suckled on her flesh and left bite marks on her skin. Since Deatrice already had a bit of lovemaking experience, she was more sensitive now to the touch that stimulated her senses.</p>
<p>He played with her nipples with his thumb and used the fingers on his other hand to penetrate her inner walls.</p>
<p><em>In, and out.</em></p>
<p>“Uh, ha.”</p>
<p>The sound of heavy rain hitting the windows was deafening. But her moan echoed clearly through the air just as heat rising between them became more prominent. She could feel it, her wetness tightening and loosening whenever he moved. It even wrapped tightly around his finger as if it was sucking it.</p>
<p>Lucius unconsciously took out his shaft and started stroking himself as she watched. His hand rubbed slowly over his member while he used the other one to finger-f*ck her.</p>
<p>He rubbed her glans and caressed her thighs.</p>
<p>Deatrice didn’t know what to do with the mind-numbing pleasure she was feeling and could only stretch her hands to him.</p>
<p>Lucius immediately stopped masturbating and gently took her hand into his palm, which still wet from the fluids leaking out of his tip. He climbed over her, pressing her hand down to her floor, and was engulfed in the vile feeling that he was defiling her.</p>
<p>His shadow drew over her.</p>
<p>“Can I put it in?”</p>
<p>Moonlight came through the window and illuminated his side profile, those red eyes clearly visible over the darkened background above him.</p>
<p>Deatrice looked up at him blankly, still reeling from the remnants of the bliss she felt.</p>
<p>He looked at her intently, waiting for her answer, then his eyebrows frowned slightly in impatience. As Deatrice opened her mouth to answer him, Lucius kissed her hastily as if he had succumbed to her subtle stimulation.</p>
<p>He asked a question and kissed her when she was just about to respond.</p>
<p>Her twin peaks rubbed against his hard chest. He was still wearing his clothes, so the added friction of the fabric swept the tip and stimulated her even further.</p>
<p>Lucius grabbed his appendage and took a position between her legs. Although she was still dizzy from the kiss, she could feel his large glans making contact with her opening.</p>
<p>She shook her head and said, “I don’t think it will go in.”</p>
<p>To which he only chuckled lowly.</p>
<p>“It went in last time.”</p>
<p>“But this time—<em>ah!</em>”</p>
<p>Lightly ignoring her grumblings, Lucius shoved his penis inside her swollen petals. The hole widened to accommodate his girth, then quickly became snug like it wanted to stifle him.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah… ha…”</p>
<p>Deatrice groaned and lifted her head. Lucius kissed her sweetly on the neck where he left his mark, enjoying this brief moment of supreme pleasure of their long-awaited bonding.</p>
<p>She sighed and buried her head in his chest.</p>
<p>“I-it hurts. D-do it a bit more… slowly…”</p>
<p>It was very sad that she barely spoke up and asked for a favor. He knew then he had been inconsiderate in penetrating her before she was fully aroused. He wanted to do her favor and slowed down accordingly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was too slow he might as well have not been moving. He couldn’t stay in a pace like this forever.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Dee.” Lucius apologized and pulled his waist back slightly, then thrust it back in.</p>
<p>At the sudden and deep invasion, she cried out, not knowing what to do. Deatrice was the type of person who would learn something without much difficulty once she tried it, but it didn’t seem like she would get used to his body inside of her anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>Had he been this strong last time?</em></p>
<p>Lucius gradually increased his speed.</p>
<p>Both Lucius and Deatrice’s minds were slowly becoming distant. Her back hurt because of the pressure against her body. Lucius buried his face into her neck, biting her tender flesh and letting out a deep moan.</p>
<p><em>Ugh, uh…</em></p>
<p><em>Ah… ah…</em></p>
<p><em>Ha…</em></p>
<p>Moan after moan came out of their mouths. The bottom of the squeaky pillar was about to burn with the heat from the friction caused by their bodies.</p>
<p>Deatrice put her fingernails on Lucius’s arm, not surprised by the high-pitched cry that came out of her mouth. As her fingernails scratched, traces remained on Lucius’ arm. It turned red and started to bleed a little.</p>
<p>However, it was nothing compared to redness all over Deatrice’s naked body.</p>
<p><em>“Lu-lucy.”</em></p>
<p>Her lewd water was dripping all the way down to her buttocks. She could hear Lucius panting as he neared his own climax. Deatrice never knew a man could be so erotic just by listening to them. Then, she felt him stiffen with tension.</p>
<p>Lucius released his essence with a pained groan and collapsed.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>After emptying his seed into her, he rested his face on her belly and hugged her waist for some time. She, too, kept her silence, exhaling her breath until her heated body cooled.</p>
<p>Deatrice lowered her hand and touched Lucius’ hair that was damp with sweat. Soon, the rain soon stopped, and the lightning and thunder disappeared as well. She watched the sun rise faintly and fell asleep.</p>
<p>There were no regrets.</p>
<p>Because there was no particular reason for sleeping with him. It was just that he kept kissing her, so Deatrice decided to be bare and simply let things be.</p>
