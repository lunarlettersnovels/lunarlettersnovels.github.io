            <p><strong>Chapter 240</strong></p>
<p>Her infatuation seemed utterly trivial in comparison to their tale.</p>
<p>It felt like watching a tragic drama unfold—a woman who had to leave the man she loved, and a man who, despite the unforgivable act committed by her father, still loved her.</p>
<p>That’s when the rumors about Lucius’s marriage, which had caused such a stir not only in the Empire but even in Galaba, came back to her. Six years ago, they had been lovers. Torn apart by circumstances, only to reunite and marry—considering that, it was unlikely that this latest ordeal would tear them apart so easily.</p>
<p>“So, did you come all the way to Pontos to find your wife?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not it. The Emperor doesn’t know that Deatrice is here. I knew, but I didn’t come here to act on that knowledge. I’m ashamed to ask this, but please keep everything I’ve told you a secret.”</p>
<p>Vivian frowned in confusion.</p>
<p>“You didn’t come here to do anything? Then why did you act the way you did with me? Wasn’t it because you wanted to see your wife? Or was it just a moment of impulse?”</p>
<p>Lucius looked momentarily taken aback. He seemed defensive, as if she had struck a nerve, but he quickly drew a clear line between them.</p>
<p>“I admit I made a mistake with you, my lady, but I don’t think I’ve done anything so wrong that I need to confess my entire heart toward Deatrice.”</p>
<p>Vivian’s face flushed with anger this time.</p>
<p>“Do you believe that confessing your feelings is a punishment for your mistakes, my lord?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what you’re trying to say.”</p>
<p>“I’m advising you to make up your mind. Decide whether you came here to see your wife or if all of this was simply at the Emperor’s command. But if you used me without any real intention of meeting her, you should know that’s shameful.”</p>
<p>With that, Vivian stood up. She gave a slight bow and left the estate, mounting her horse and returning to the marquisate. Lucius watched her departing figure with a brief, bitter laugh.</p>
<p>“Advising me to make up my mind?”</p>
<p>Had he truly acted so foolishly that he deserved such advice from someone so young?</p>
<p>Of course, it was true that he hadn’t begged her to come back, nor had he gone to confront her. It was true that, despite still harboring feelings for Deatrice, he was preparing to leave without seeing her. And it was undeniable that he had resorted to using another woman to gauge her feelings—a lowly, despicable act.</p>
<p>After all that, was it too late to say, “I didn’t come here to take action”?</p>
<p>Lucius closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead. He felt utterly exhausted. Ever since Deatrice left, he had felt an overwhelming sense of helplessness looming before him.</p>
<p>“Commander.”</p>
<p>A knight’s hesitant voice came with a knock on the door. Lucius sighed and told him to enter.</p>
<p>“Um… here….”</p>
<p>The knight fumbled over his words as he placed a small envelope on the table. Sensing something amiss, Lucius frowned and gestured for the knight to explain.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Well….”</p>
<p>The knight hesitated for a long moment, struggling to find the right words, before finally managing to speak.</p>
<p>“My lady came by. She asked me to give this to you.”</p>
<p>“Deatrice was here?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Of all times, now.</p>
<p>The marquis’s daughter might have seen her coming here. What if she misunderstood? Lucius hurried to leave, as if to chase after her, but his gaze instinctively fell on the white envelope still sitting on the desk.</p>
<p>“…You may go.”</p>
<p>The envelope bulged slightly, as if it held a small item. Lucius didn’t need to open it to guess what was inside. After a moment of hesitation, he reached out, and two rings fell into his palm.</p>
<p>A wedding ring and an engagement ring.</p>
<p>The sight of them made him let out a bitter, almost nervous laugh, but then he clenched his fist.</p>
<p>He was exhausted. The thought of her abandoning him like this once again was unbearable, but what was worse was the familiar pain in his chest, just like when he had first received the rings back.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>Deatrice spent a long time in the woods.</p>
<p>It had been so long since she had free time that everyone had made plans to go into town, causing a ruckus from the night before. They talked about how they could catch a piano recital or a play if they just traveled a bit further, and they even extended an invitation to Deatrice, but she declined with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’m tired. I think I’ll rest for a change.”</p>
<p>In truth, she was tired. Just being in the same territory as Lucius made her uneasy. In this ruined land, where the protection of the estate was no longer functional, Lucius’s knights were a rare presence, and they quickly became the center of attention.</p>
<p>Every day, people brought her the latest gossip about Lucius, as if there was nothing else worth discussing.</p>
