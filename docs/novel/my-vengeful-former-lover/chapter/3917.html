            <p><strong>Chapter 126</strong></p>
<p>Lucius knew she would be alright—no. Rather, he knew exactly that she would pretend to be alright until the very end. That’s why he was trying to stop it, but it was impossible to subdue Deatrice with her current temperament, so Lucius eventually gave up.</p>
<p>Even though he won’t be able to decipher her mind, Lucius watched Deatrice as his knight guided them. Of course, there was no change in Deatrice’s complexion. Rather, she even looked around with curious eyes.</p>
<p>“But if you’re just explaining things in words and theory, I’m afraid I won’t understand. May I try shooting an actual weapon? But if the materials are not enough, we can just skip it…”</p>
<p>“No, it is enough, m’lady.” The knight replied earnestly. “Do you want to do it with the gun I’m holding?”</p>
<p>Deatrice, who was watching, thought that Lucius’ objection to her seeing monsters’ death would continue at this point. Unexpectedly, he remained quiet. Looking back, his handsome face was looking straight ahead without much change.</p>
<p>He must have given up.</p>
<p>Lucius was about to turn his head with a smile, but at that moment, a loud gunshot rang in his ears and his body stiffened unnaturally. He thought it was an illusion, but the sound of gunshots in succession made it clearer it was real.</p>
<p>It was a characteristic gesture occupied by fear.</p>
<p>Seeing his behavior like that for the first time, Deatrice was inwardly shocked. Like a child who had first witnessed her powerful father’s sudden frailty.</p>
<p>“As you said, it seems that it isn’t really affected, especially if I shoot somewhere that isn’t its weakness.”</p>
<p>“So it’s probably easier to kill it with a sword than a gun…”</p>
<p>Lucius quickly shook his head, his following movements responding naturally with his stiffened posture. He took a step forward and, after that, maintained a calm attitude even in the face of those gunshots.</p>
<p>As if he was able to act calmly after long practice, he skillfully concealed his weaknesses that were revealed for a short while.</p>
<p>Had she not witnessed it with her own eyes, Deatrice would’ve never known Lucius was afraid of guns.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day was getting colder.</p>
<p>The forest, which seemed to be always filled with the energy of life, became a little quieter and the soil a little deeper in color.</p>
<p>Deatrice was outside the terrace wearing a shawl woven with beautiful patterns. Moisture in the air was so thick it felt like it would pour out at any moment.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t it look like it’s going to rain heavily?” The new maid looked up at the sky in different positions with a hand awning beside her, as if she could tell when it’s going to rain if she glanced at the sky in a certain angle.</p>
<p>Deatrice, looking at Natalie like that, suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you cold?”</p>
<p>She even wore a shawl, but the maid dressed the same way she did during summer.</p>
<p>Natalie shrugged her shoulders naturally and then responded. “I’ve been told that I had a lot of heat in my body since I was little and, according to my mother, that was why I had frequent fevers. Even now, I get sick once in the summer, but fine during the winter season. Anyways, the master was looking for you earlier…”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“It’s the wedding soon, he asked me how your preparations are going.”</p>
<p>“It’s not my wedding, why do I need to prepare for him?”</p>
<p>“That’s why he said you don’t seem to be preparing anything at all. Then he frowned for a while and then told me to go.”</p>
<p>Deatrice laughed shortly.</p>
<p>It was funny that Natalie told the truth straight away, and above all, Lucius, who cared about such things, was funny too.</p>
<p>After Wilton went home, autumn came quickly. The harvest was coming soon, and the manor was very busy with preparations for the new season. Deatrice was also taking a bit of a rest now, but she looked at the documents about the estate for a long time.</p>
<p>Deatrice didn’t have a lot of work lately, so she’s definitely not busier than Lucius. However, he somehow still found the time to call her maid to ask what she’ll wear for the upcoming wedding.</p>
<p>“Next time he calls you again, just tell him that I will take care of myself enough not to degrade the dignity of the family.”</p>
<p>“Yes, m’lady.”</p>
<p>Natalie bowed her head to answer. After a moment, she slowly raised her head to look at Deatrice. Before that gaze could be prolonged, Deatrice had no choice but to respond.</p>
<p>“What?” Deatrice finally asked.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“You usually look at me like that when you have a request. What is it this time?”</p>
<p>Then Natalie smiled shyly and said, “Well, actually, I was just wondering if I could be an hour late after my lunch break. Warren said he’d like to see me for a minute…”</p>
<p>“I thought you two just met each other this morning. He wants to see you again?”</p>
<p>“Of course! We miss each other all the time.” Natalie murmured in a semi-depressed state, perhaps thinking of ‘him’ again in the interim as she spoke with a rare enthusiasm. “When I don’t see him, I think about him…”</p>
<p>Deatrice felt that Natalie was cute and smiled. Rosalynn was very dissatisfied with Natalie, who was supposed to take care of Deatrice whenever she was busy but ended up neglecting her work because she was preoccupied with the person she was dating.</p>
<p>In fact, Deatrice was like that too.</p>
<p>“You can go now, there’s nothing else left for you to do. There’s also not much time before lunch.”</p>
<p>“Can I really do that?” her eyes gleamed, “Thank you, m’lady!”</p>
