            <p><strong>Chapter 258</strong></p>
<p>“Lucius,” she called softly.</p>
<p>He responded with a quiet, “Yes?”</p>
<p>After a long hesitation, Deatrice finally asked, “Who are those people outside?”</p>
<p>“People outside?”</p>
<p>Lucius seemed genuinely puzzled, as if he had no idea what she was referring to.</p>
<p>“The guards. Why do I need them?”</p>
<p>Lucius’ voice turned a little evasive, his tone hinting at discomfort.</p>
<p>“Ah, those. It’s only two guards, is it really bothering you that much?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that it’s bothering me… It just startled me. I wondered if something had happened.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>Lucius noticed her cautious tone, realizing she was carefully choosing her words. He shifted uncomfortably, like a boy caught doing something wrong, trying to buy time before he finally admitted the truth.</p>
<p>“There’s really nothing going on.”</p>
<p>“Then why?” she pressed.</p>
<p>With a playful hint to his voice, though still somewhat hesitant, he finally said, “To be honest… you’re locked up.”</p>
<p>“Locked up?”</p>
<p>The last thing he should’ve expected was for her to take it lightly.</p>
<p>She stared at him in disbelief, and sensing her reaction, Lucius quickly tried to explain, his tone turning more urgent.</p>
<p>“I know how this sounds. But if you understand how I feel, you’ll get it.”</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying you’ve imprisoned me?”</p>
<p>Lucius winced at the word, finding it distasteful. He turned towards her more seriously, adopting a persuasive tone as he responded.</p>
<p>Lucius let out a small sigh of relief, his smile growing wider as Deatrice reluctantly agreed.</p>
<p>“Last night, you asked me to let you go, remember? And I told you I couldn’t. The conversation didn’t really come to an end. After watching you sleep in my arms, I couldn’t stop thinking. Positive thoughts, sure, but I kept picturing you running off again—like you did to Ponto. You slipped out of the Duke’s estate so easily, and I realized how simple it would be for you to leave this house as well. You’re a mistress here, so you could just ask the coachman to take you to any station and disappear.”</p>
<p>“Lucius,” Deatrice interrupted, her tone exasperated, as if his words were too absurd to entertain. Her voice snapped him out of his spiraling thoughts, and he forced a smile as he turned to her.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I spent all night thinking about that. So, unless you’re planning to drive me crazy, just stay with me for a month.”</p>
<p>“Lucius.”</p>
<p>She called his name again, more sternly this time. “I understand how you feel, but this… This won’t help any of us.”</p>
<p>He laughed softly, almost defeated. “You sound like a proper teacher now. I suppose three months of being tutored has really rubbed off on you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t change the subject. You know this is ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already compromised as much as I can.”</p>
<p>“By locking me up?” she asked incredulously.</p>
<p>“You’re free to go wherever you like. See whoever you want. So, technically, it’s not imprisonment.”</p>
<p>Deatrice fell silent, and sensing her hesitation, Lucius’ voice softened. “Just one month. After that, they’ll be gone. Honestly, I could’ve arranged it so you’d never even notice the guards. The fact that you can see them is proof that I’m not trying to deceive you.”</p>
<p>Correction—Lucius was far from clumsy. He was calculating and thorough. Even his insane reasoning was delivered with a frightening degree of logic.</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>Deatrice’s head pounded. She knew she should tell him how wrong it was for a husband to keep his wife under surveillance, that this was a violation of her freedom. Yet as she looked at him, her resolve slowly weakened. She found herself thinking about how desperate he must have been to go to such lengths.</p>
<p>It was only for a month, after all. And she had made mistakes too.</p>
<p>Lucius, sensing her wavering, peppered her face and hands with gentle kisses, pleading like a child, “Please? Please, just for a month?”</p>
<p>In the end, Deatrice couldn’t hold out any longer. His tickling touch made her burst into laughter, and she finally pushed his hands away, signaling her surrender.</p>
<p>“Alright,” she said softly.</p>
<p>“Really?” Lucius’ face lit up with a triumphant smile, his earlier tension dissolving as he gazed down at her.</p>
<p>“But not for a month,” she added, a glint of defiance returning to her eyes. “Three weeks. That’s all.”</p>
<p>Reducing his request by a week was the last shred of control she clung to, a final assertion of her independence. Lucius, now straddling her, smiled down at her with undeniable charm, his earlier anxiety fading away.</p>
<p>“As you wish,” he said, and then, with renewed passion, showered her with kisses as if she had granted him the world.</p>
<p>Yet, even after three weeks passed, the guards assigned to watch over Deatrice never left her side. Three weeks turned into a month, and then two, and the promise of freedom remained unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Lucius had his reasons, of course.</p>
<p>Ethan Vander, the son of Filbert Vander, who had almost been dragged away and executed like a dog in front of people, had come to the territory in a rage upon hearing that Lucius was becoming a duke.</p>
<p>He invaded the territory with knights, vowing to kill Lucius himself, as if on a suicide mission. Naturally, Lucius’s knights annihilated them, but somehow, at the last moment, they failed to capture the ringleader, Ethan Vander.</p>
