            <p><strong>Chapter 189 (R18)</strong></p>
<p>“Hnn.”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah!”</p>
<p>As Lucius suddenly thrust deeper, Deatrice let out a deep moan. Her trembling back was visible. Lucius gently held her slender waist and kissed her back.</p>
<p>“Shh, Dee. You need to relax.”</p>
<p>The sudden forcefulness made it feel like the object might be pulled out entirely. Amidst the flashing white lights in his mind, Lucius managed to speak softly to Deatrice. She gripped the sheets tightly and barely contained her moans.</p>
<p>“Lucy, Lucius.”</p>
<p>Even her reproach sounded sweet. Lucius was consumed by a feeling of owning her completely. Connected below, their entwined bodies, and her reception of his sensations. Everything belonged solely to him, without any intrusion, even her resentment.</p>
<p>“Sorry. I’ll go slowly. So, relax, okay?”</p>
<p>But even as he spoke, Lucius was nipping at the nape of Deatrice’s neck. His kisses lingered near the nape, tracing the path of his breath. His thrusting from the forcefully gripped hole slowed, pulling out slightly before gently entering again.</p>
<p>“Lucy, just a moment.”</p>
<p>Lucius’s descending hand was firmly pressed against the bulging flesh next to her hole. It was like a massage, an attempt to soothe the tension. But it only deepened her embarrassment.</p>
<p>Here she was, bent over like an animal in heat, accepting him.</p>
<p>The most terrifying part was that she didn’t entirely hate it.</p>
<p>Exactly as Lucius said, Deatrice’s back was incredibly sensitive. Even when her maids tightened her corset, they would be extra careful around her back. Just the act of someone breathing behind her or merely talking would send tingling sensations down her spine, causing her entire body to shiver.</p>
<p>Her back was so sensitive that even the slightest touch elicited a reaction. With Lucius’s firm body pressing against her, his warm breath cascading over her back, she was trembling even without much action.</p>
<p>Despite her unpreparedness, Lucius’s thrusts grew stronger. His head was pounding white, and her moans were growing louder.</p>
<p>“Lucy. Mm, ah, Lu, ah, ahh!”</p>
<p>With each thrust, her moans flowed out. The sound of their flesh colliding and the resonance of bones and flesh echoed noisily. She was constantly tightening around him, unable to overcome the force of his thrusts.</p>
<p>Bent over and receiving him in such a manner was fulfilling yet painfully frustrating.</p>
<p>Lucius’s thrusting pace quickened even further. He pulled out long and then plunged deep without a moment’s pause. Every time, she felt like collapsing. Yet, his relentless force pushed her into a rhythm of accepting him, leaving her no other option.</p>
<p>“I want to escape. It feels like I’m going to die.”</p>
<p>It was too intense, too overwhelming. With every motion, she felt his firm body against hers. It was an incessant pounding that left her on the brink of breaking. As her mind drifted away, Lucius held her tightly and thrust deeply.</p>
<p>Between her trembling thighs, a mixture of Lucius’s semen and her own fluids trickled.</p>
<p>Finally, it was over.</p>
<p>Deatrice, drenched in sweat, released a ragged breath. Tears flowed unceasingly, and her body continued to shiver slightly. Lucius’s member was still inside her.</p>
<p>She wanted to push him away, to get him out, but she was too weak. So, she remained still, nestled in his embrace.</p>
<p>However, she realized her mistake soon after. Lucius’s member was growing hard again inside her. It expanded, filling her up once more. Panicking, Deatrice tried to push him away.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>“Just wait, I’ll pull out.”</p>
<p>“Lucius!”</p>
<p>But Lucius didn’t pull out. He sweetly kissed her, then gently lowered her onto her back while remaining connected. Although Deatrice hesitated at the renewed act, Lucius smiled more charmingly than ever.</p>
<p>And then, holding her waist, he slowly withdrew his member and thrust back in.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“See? I really pulled out.”</p>
<p>He wore a sly yet beautifully captivating smile. Deatrice felt like she was dying, so she tightly shut her eyes. The night seemed never-ending.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even after a relentlessly long night, morning came. Deatrice struggled to open her eyes, her naked body curling under the covers. Her entire body ached as if she’d been trampled by someone.</p>
<p>And, of course, she knew exactly who that “someone” was.</p>
<p>“This is insane. Truly insane.”</p>
<p>Deatrice spat out resentful words, casting her gaze at the spot where Lucius had been lying during the night. Of course, it had been vacant for a long time.</p>
<p>It was midday, and Lucius had left early in the morning for the palace to attend to his duties. How many hours had she slept?</p>
<p>Deatrice’s thoughts turned to him, worried, but more than that, she was resentful towards him for not allowing her a moment’s rest.</p>
<p>“Dee.”</p>
<p>“You should look here, Dee.”</p>
<p>That nickname now sent shivers down her spine. Yesterday, he had tormented her relentlessly, calling her “Dee” over and over again.</p>
<p>Whenever she tried to sleep, he woke her with intense excitement and longing, starting the cycle of torment anew.</p>
<p>“Open your eyes, Dee.”</p>
<p>“Lift your hips a bit more, Dee.”</p>
<p><em>That damn “Dee,” “Dee,” “Dee.” </em>She thought.</p>
<p>Later, when she begged him to let her sleep, he pressed his chin firmly against her chest, wearing an ecstatic smile, and said, “Just one more time, Dee.”</p>
