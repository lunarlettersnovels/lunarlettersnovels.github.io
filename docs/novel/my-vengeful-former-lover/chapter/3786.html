            <p><strong>Chapter 260</strong></p>
<p>Seeing Filbert Vander’s hair, which had turned completely white in the few months she hadn’t seen him, Deatrice couldn’t help but feel a pang of pity. But she knew how dangerous it would be to show sympathy, so she forced herself to remain calm.</p>
<p>‘I called you in to tell you to leave.’</p>
<p>Deatrice said in a cold voice that revealed almost no emotion.</p>
<p>‘There’s nothing I can do for you. You know that coming here puts a great burden on me.’</p>
<p>Filbert, with a distressed expression, couldn’t easily open his mouth and finally spoke, gripping his hands on his knees.</p>
<p>‘I know how much trouble my son and I have caused you. But I can’t just sit and do nothing while Ethan is executed. I think you understand how I feel.’</p>
<p>‘…’</p>
<p>“I know how reckless Ethan was. But he is my only child. I can’t even imagine a life without him. Deatrice, please. Tell me how I can save Ethan.”</p>
<p>“Why did you let him do such a thing?”</p>
<p>Unable to hold back, Deatrice turned and shouted.</p>
<p>“Do you really expect me to believe you didn’t know? If you had contacted me the day Ethan disappeared, this wouldn’t have happened. Or did you really believe Ethan would succeed?”</p>
<p>Filbert wiped his regretful face with his hand.</p>
<p>“Please don’t blame me, Deatrice. I know my selfishness. But we had our own reasons. Although I didn’t mention it, after Ethan was stabbed that day, he had considerable difficulty using his arm. The priest said even divine power couldn’t help. They couldn’t guarantee it would return to normal. Imagine how he felt, becoming disabled in an instant. But I swear, I didn’t think Ethan went for revenge from the start. By the time I realized some knights had disappeared with him, it was too late.”</p>
<p>Seeing how tormented he already looked, Deatrice didn’t mention how cowardly his actions seemed now. But she couldn’t help but feel contempt for his attitude, coming to her only after Ethan was captured, and asking her to save Ethan’s life instead of apologizing to Lucius.</p>
<p>“As I said before, there’s nothing I can do. And I don’t think I should.”</p>
<p>“Deatrice.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t care when my father was in such a state and ran away. Do you think I would now suddenly ask to save Ethan’s life?”</p>
<p>“At least speak to Lucius…”</p>
<p>“We’ve already been lenient enough. We supported the claim that Ethan’s crime had nothing to do with the Vander family. Consider that a blessing.”</p>
<p>Filbert Vander, who had been silent for a while, seemed to finally realize that no one could save his son. With a sorrowful face, he spoke as if giving up.</p>
<p>“Then let me see him one last time.”</p>
<p>“Uncle.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying I can’t even see my son before he dies?”</p>
<p>“Visits are not allowed for those awaiting execution. You know that.”</p>
<p>“Deatrice. You know Ethan. You know better than anyone that he wasn’t a bad person. Especially to you, he was always kind. Your relationship was always good. Are you not at all saddened by his death?”</p>
<p>“No matter what you say, it won’t change anything.”</p>
<p>“Please, Deatrice. I’m begging you. Let me see Ethan.”</p>
<p>Finally breaking down, Filbert knelt in front of her and wept. The breath of a parent facing their child’s death was heavy. Deatrice, almost stepping forward to comfort him, clenched her fists and stepped back.</p>
<p>For a long time, the room was filled only with Filbert Vander’s bitter sobs.</p>
<p>Rubbing her throbbing head, Deatrice finally sighed and spoke.</p>
<p>“If you have something to say, I’ll pass it on. Write a letter and leave it with the butler. That’s all I can do for you.”</p>
<p>With that, Deatrice brushed past the tearful Filbert Vander and went up to her room. She stayed there, not even turning on the lights as the day turned to night, until Lucius came in and she realized she had been sitting in the dark, lost in thought.</p>
<p>“Deatrice? What are you doing there?”</p>
<p>Deatrice, snapping out of her daze at Lucius’s voice, responded with a deliberately calm voice.</p>
<p>“Oh, I must have dozed off.”</p>
<p>“So early? Are you okay? You’re not sick, are you?”</p>
<p>“Sick? I’ve been inside the house all day. What could make me sick?”</p>
<p>Lucius brought a candle closer to Deatrice’s face, as if to check her condition. The bright light illuminated her. Her round forehead, pale cheeks, and the sleepy smile she forced. Lucius quietly observed her and then took her hand.</p>
<p>Even this summer, her hand was as cold as ice.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“It seems I shouldn’t have suggested you meet him.”</p>
<p>Despite her efforts to appear fine, Lucius seemed to have detected the source of her hidden discomfort. Deatrice wondered if she was simply clumsy or if Lucius had a special talent for understanding her.</p>
<p>Deatrice reached out and hugged Lucius, hiding her face from view. Lucius gently patted her back, as if to comfort her.</p>
<p>The reason she had met Filbert Vander so suddenly was largely due to Lucius’s long persuasion the previous night. Perhaps he had noticed her constantly standing by the window, looking at Vander’s carriage, and made the suggestion. Regardless of the reason, it didn’t change the fact that Lucius was compassionate.</p>
<p>She suddenly realized that she, like others, was taking advantage of Lucius’s kind nature. Still hugging him, Deatrice spoke.</p>
<p>“I feel ashamed to ask you this, but could you deliver Filbert Vander’s letter to Ethan?”</p>
