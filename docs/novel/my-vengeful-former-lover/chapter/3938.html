            <p><strong>Chapter 105</strong></p>
<p>When Philip heard his name, his eyes widened and he grabbed at the hem of his mother’s skirt. Dixie smiled softly and stroked his head.</p>
<p>Raymond pulled her closer and kissed the top of her head. “My wife started having morning sickness these days. It breaks my heart every time I see her struggling.”</p>
<p>His brown eyes gleamed with affection and pity for his wife.</p>
<p>With a loving look, Dixie kissed Raymond on the cheek and the two exchanged intimate glances for a moment. Above their heads was a portrait of the Bell family, as is often the case with family homes.</p>
<p>Dixie sat while holding Phillip and Raymond stood a bit behind them, looking dignified and protective with one hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>As Deatrice’s gaze widened at the portrait, Raymond smiled and joked.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t it look quite realistic? I paid a bit extra to make it possible. Imagine how it would’ve looked if beautiful people like you and Lucius were painted instead?”</p>
<p>Deatrice laughed at the words that were hard to reply to. Anyone looking at it could see that Raymond’s portrait was definitely beautified by a point or two. Knowing it was rude, she didn’t say anything much.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you pay a bit too much? You look almost like a different person.” Fortunately, Lucius cut their conversation short.</p>
<p>“It looks the same to me.” Dixie smiled widely, protecting her husband from her brother’s mischievous remarks. “If it looks good in your eyes, then I guess this portrait is passable.” She said.</p>
<p>Watching the friendly banter between siblings, Deatrice clasped her hands together and it drew their attention.</p>
<p>“Right… I brought some presents. Where should I put them?”</p>
<p>“Oh, put it in the living room.”</p>
<p>As the attendants entered, they carried a lot of items with them. When Philip realized that many of those were for him, he screamed and quickly tailed the servants into the living room. Dixie blinked at the nanny, signaling the latter to bring back the boy before he gets hurt or if he breaks something.</p>
<p>“Why did you buy so much?”</p>
<p>Deatrice didn’t want to disappoint the child by not seeing the items, so she discouraged the nanny from taking Philip back.</p>
<p>She answered, “Well, Lucius told me to pay special attention. Oh, and if it’s Philip’s, it’s okay to fetch him after he opens his gifts. Once I know what he likes, I can bring a better gift next time.”</p>
<p>“Will that be alright? He’s…” Dixie said, glancing at her son, “not that calm.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. It’ll be alright.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Dixie gave Deatrice a short hug and a peck on the cheek, expressing her gratitude.</p>
<p>In the living room, Raymond and Lucius were seated first. They talked briefly about the meeting between the nobles and what conclusion they’d reach. Their discussion ended when Philip suddenly jumped into his father’s lap and settled there.</p>
<p>Raymond kissed the child’s head and whispered something to his ear in a familiar manner. Philip sometimes spoke gibberish, so Raymond would translate them for Lucius so he could understand the boy’s story.</p>
<p>Deatrice had been watching Lucius from the moment she entered the living room. She could see how often a practiced smile appeared on Lucius’s face as he listened.</p>
<p><em>As expected, Lucius isn’t very fond of children.</em></p>
<p>Deatrice pondered and then concluded as if knowing that could possibly mean something to her. But of course, it didn’t really matter since she wouldn’t have a child with him.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was no way she could do <em>that thing</em> again with Lucius unless she was demented.</p>
<p>So, no.</p>
<p>Absolutely no chance for them to have a child together.</p>
<p>But Deatrice still inevitably felt a bit hurt by his cold attitude. Sensing her own stupidity, she blushed and sat down while fanning herself lightly.</p>
<p>“Oh my, what are these?”</p>
<p>There were quite a lot of gifts piling up in one corner of the room.</p>
<p>Deatrice thought that since precious things are hard to find, it seems like they are competing with quantity. She said calmly.</p>
<p>“It is said that no matter how much you try, there is nothing excessive about gifts for mothers and children. Not just during the first time, because second pregnancy is also equally very important.”</p>
<p>She moved closer to the pile and continued, “I brought some medicines and supplies necessary for pregnancy. But now that I think about it, you must’ve already had them in your possession. Now, I feel troubled that I may have increased your inventory for nothing.”</p>
<p>“Not at all.” Raymond waved it off, “In fact, I’m worried about not having enough of them. When she was pregnant with Philip, my wife suffered so much, but my mother-in-law—”</p>
<p>“Dear.”</p>
<p>Dixie quietly stopped Raymond from talking about her mother.</p>
<p><em>Frida Fenry.</em></p>
<p>Raymond looked back at his wife’s face with her folded arms and realized that he shouldn’t have broached the subject.</p>
<p>“Ah…” he looked at Lucius and Deatrice’s faces alternately. “Thank you, anyway.”</p>
<p>Deciding to intervene and disperse the awkward atmosphere, Dixie bowed her head to Deatrice. “Not to worry, Deatrice. Frankly speaking, I am truly in need of those medicines.”</p>
<p>Raymond then added. “We also have a gift for Philip. Now, Philip, you’ve been waiting a long time. Do you want to see our gift for you?”</p>
<p>Little Philip looked up at his father with anticipation in his eyes.</p>
<p>Raymond smiled kindly and took out a gift. Only Dixie’s voice echoed in the drawing room as she instructed the servants to bring out to move the pile as well as Philip’s excited chatter.</p>
<p>Raymond, who had always had envy for high noblemen, felt his liking for Deatrice increase as she had brought carefully selected gifts for his family.</p>
<p>“It is very burdensome to receive so much. I’m thinking of paying it back later when you get pregnant.” He said with a teasing smile on his face.</p>
