        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 94</strong></p>
<p>His movements became wilder as he gradually came close to a climax and Deatrice could hear his raspy breaths tickling her eardrums. She felt a sense of superiority in knowing that the pleasure he was feeling by caused by her own doing.</p>
<p>She would alternately loosen and tighten her grip on his shaft, further fueling his arousal as sweat slowly escaped his pores, covering his muscles with a shimmer that made Deatrice have the urge to lick them off his body.</p>
<p>After a few more thrusts, he finally erupted with a moan. The warm white liquid squirted from his tip and some of it fell on her face and breasts.</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry.”</p>
<p>However, his face looked far from being apologetic. Seeing his semen so lewdly placed on her body only served to arouse him even more as he narrowed his red eyes at her.</p>
<p>He wiped them away with fingers, teasing her as he did so. Lucius had even lightly brushed a finger against her apex, making Deatrice blush furiously and push him away.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Can you do that too?”</p>
<p>She looked blankly at him.</p>
<p>“What you did with your hands just now, do the same for your little hole.”</p>
<p>“Stop talking about… about <em>that </em>hole!” She was mortified, but he laughed it off as if he couldn’t resist her lovely reactions. Upon seeing the languidly satisfied smile on his face, Deatrice’s words died inside her throat.</p>
<p>Lucius slowly laid her back against the mattress.</p>
<p>His hand wandered lower and lower until it stopped right before her entrance. Then he touched those nether lips that begged to be touched by him once more. His fingertips played with her and made her writhe on the palm of his hands.</p>
<p>“Lucius, will you keep on playing—<em>ah!</em>!”</p>
<p>“Why does your body always smell so good…”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>When she showed a perplexed expression, Lucius smirked and lowered his face until it was in front of her swollen entrance. He pressed his nose closer to her labia and inhaled, “Did you put perfume in here too? Otherwise, there’s no way it would be this fragrant.”</p>
<p>He pulled out his fingers that had just been inside and licked them while maintaining eye contact with her.</p>
<p>Before Deatrice’s mind could process what he did, she felt something rigid against her entrance.</p>
<p>Lucius slowly pierced her insides with his penis.</p>
<p>His large girth against her tight and narrow opening made it a painful experience for her. Even though she had already spilled enough water to soak up their buttocks, it still wasn’t enough to accommodate his member.</p>
<p>The moment he entered, he moaned as he felt her walls constricting tightly around him.</p>
<p>“Deatrice?” he called out when he saw that she was barely moving, “Deatrice, breathe…”</p>
<p>Lucius placed a feather-light kiss on her face, wanting to remove the pained expression on her face.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. The pain will be gone soon. Just breathe, okay?” He pleaded, but Deatrice couldn’t find it in herself to breathe as she felt that she was so full of him. When Lucius started pushing deeper inside of her, Deatrice felt even more overwhelmed.</p>
<p><em>Stop.</em></p>
<p><em>Stop.</em></p>
<p>Deatrice begged inside her head, but she couldn’t speak.</p>
<p>She twisted her body, wanting to escape, her nails digging into his arm as he supported her. Feeling a greater stimulation from the pain, Lucius shut his eyes and grabbed her waist with one hand. Then he hugged her.</p>
<p>“It’s all in.”</p>
<p>Lucius remained unmoving as he was inside her, simply hugging her as he heard the frantic pounding of her chest.</p>
<p>Deatrice herself couldn’t believe that his big thingy could fit her. She wanted to touch the place where they had joined together to confirm for herself, but when she had touched herself, she abruptly shuddered at the jolt of pleasure when her fingers made contact.</p>
<p>“Don’t… don’t do it.”</p>
<p>She finally said in a hoarse and wisp-like voice.</p>
<p>Lucius felt goosebumps at hearing her voice like that and he suppressed her desire to kiss her again. Rivulets of sweat streamed towards his waistline as he, with much difficulty, resisted ramming his hips against her.</p>
<p>But Lucius spoke softly, uttering with all the patience he could muster, “Then, how long do you want us to stay like this? All night?”</p>
<p>For him, it was a promise that he would endure if it made her uncomfortable, but Deatrice heard differently. To her, it sounded more like a threat.</p>
<p>She frowned, and then winced at the pain. She thought to herself that she would rather get it over and done with as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“No, but… make it quick.”</p>
<p>He nodded, “Then, I’ll start moving…”</p>
<p>But as soon as he moved, she immediately regretted what she had said.</p>
<p>Goosebumps rose, along with the searing pain of his appendage stretching and scratching her inner wall. But Lucius moved slowly, considerate of the fact that this was her first as a result of gathering willpower to repel his burning desire.</p>
<p><em>Thud, thud, thud…</em></p>
<p><em>Creak.</em></p>
<p>The bed was holding her body, but Deatrice felt she was dragged down endlessly by his constant pounding. As her arms swung wildly, Lucius caught them and pinned them above her head.</p>
<p>Suddenly feeling dominated by him, Deatrice unwittingly became excited and moaned. Lucius mistook it for a cry of pain. He dragged his finger to the place he had stimulated her earlier and another moan escaped her lips as she felt a burst of pleasure.</p>
<p><em>“Ha… urgh… uh.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ugh…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ah!”</em></p>
<p>Wet, slopping noises could be heard and carnal desire enveloped the room.</p>
<p>Her whole body felt hot all over, and her mind became muddled with every jerk of his hips. It felt like every nerve in her lower region was alive as it magnified every sensation that she felt. Gradually, she felt Lucius increase his speed and his pounding started becoming intense.</p>
<p>She felt something building up inside her.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh… Ha… wait—<em>ah!</em>”</p>
<p>He wasn’t going to stop, not when her insides clung onto him so tightly that he felt she was already so close to the edge.</p>
<p>Deatrice thought she was going crazy. Her gasps became louder and louder, and they soon became cries of pleasure.</p>
<p>Lucius groaned and propped his arms on both sides of her face, trapping her in between. Deatrice felt something hot filling her insides in waves.</p>
<p>And then it came.</p>
<p>An explosion of pleasure bombarded her senses as she felt her own release. Closing her eyes, she was soon swept to oblivion by the billowing feel of ecstasy.</p>
