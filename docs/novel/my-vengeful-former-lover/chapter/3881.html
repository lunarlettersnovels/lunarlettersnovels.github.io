            <p><strong>Chapter 162</strong></p>
<p>“But how can anyone do this—<em>ah!</em>”</p>
<p>Lucius’ fingertips pressed against her underwear. Her underwear clung to her skin as it became wet with every stroke. His face came closer and closer, eyes filled with lust and anticipation. “I’ve been too selfish.”</p>
<p>“It’s the same now—<em>oh, my…</em>”</p>
<p>Deatrice couldn’t finish her words properly and groaned.</p>
<p>She could pretend not to care all she wanted, but the truth was that she also missed his touch. She felt his fingers roll her underwear sideways and, without taking it off properly, he hooked it in place with his finger and stared intently at her exposed wetness.</p>
<p>She shuddered and tried closing her legs to hide from the hotness of his gaze. Then, he pulled at her thigh a little more and her secret place was now mere inches from his face.</p>
<p>She could feel her walls clenching with tension after every passing second.</p>
<p>Seeing it become even wetter the longer he stared, Lucius’ gaze became much more persistent. “I want to devour you, right now…”</p>
<p>He inhaled deeply, and while he spoke Deatrice could feel the warmth of his breath and it sent shivers down her spine.</p>
<p>“I really don’t want to say dirty things in front of you.”</p>
<p>He didn’t do much and just looked at her, but Deatrice suddenly wished his big, strong hands would caress her inside a little more. With that particular thought, her mind was filled with the shame of her own indecency.</p>
<p>The fact that he kept saying words like those, and he could practically see the inside of her soul with her legs apart like that…</p>
<p>She tried to curl her legs to block his view, but with one push, Lucius’ face was already kissing the inside of her mid-thigh. He placed a finger at her entrance and lightly touched it.</p>
<p>Deatrice could feel the tautness on her knees and the curling of her toes became tighter with that contact. The tension was getting too much for her.</p>
<p>He pressed his finger against her sopping wet hole and fondled her lips, spreading them apart to get a clearer view of what it hid between them.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>She yelped briefly because the cold air was suddenly felt in a place it shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>Lucius’s nose poked between her legs. He parted his mouth and he licked lightly at her clitoris. It was such a tingling and distracting feeling. Stimulating her with his slippery tongue, Lucius applied pressure to his fingers that were poking at her entrance. Deatrice moved her bottom backward to escape, but he only tightened his grip on her thigh with his other hand.</p>
<p>Her little hole was damp and she could feel Lucius’s fingers start to penetrate her.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>Her thighs trembled as she felt the strength leave her body.</p>
<p>He licked her underneath in such a slow, affectionate manner that her whole body trembled and he groaned. His tongue pressed into the hole and licked every bit of the inside he could reach. Then he alternated them with kisses and soft sucking.</p>
<p>“So good…”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Her groan snapped off. She never imagined he would do anything like this. The feeling of his tongue lapping at her intimate areas was soft and hot and it made her so weak. She was practically putty in his grasp.</p>
<p>As he pushed her shoulder downwards against the bed, Deatrice shook her head. However, he didn’t think about stopping now.</p>
<p>“That’s enough—<em>mmngf!</em>” She muffled her scream with her palm as he abruptly pushed his tongue inside without warning. Then he licked her again and it was unbearably hot.</p>
<p>He was rubbing her beads with his rough thumb, which made him more distracted. She dug her fingernails into his shoulders as he kissed her nether lips and played with them continuously. Panting, she could only let out small gasps and breaths.</p>
<p>“Hngh… ha… <em>Ahh!</em>”</p>
<p>An unbearable pleasure almost melted her backbone.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure she didn’t want to know. Now that she knew he could do this, something seemed to have changed forever. Deatrice grabbed him with a trembling body in the surging waves of pleasure. Her back was arched as her expression contorted in pleasure as she faced the ceiling.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, she pushed his face deeper into her entrance.</p>
<p>Even after her climax, Lucius gave a long, sticky lick under her and devoured everything she had to offer. As he looked at her exhausted face colored with pleasure and the sweat covering her body, he thought there was nothing more beautiful than this.</p>
<p>“My love.”</p>
<p>Deatrice looked down at him between her legs, feeling tired.</p>
<p>Was he serious about not putting it in?</p>
<p>Lucius, who was looking at her dotingly, soon got up and wiped her clean with a wet towel. The pleasure hasn’t completely left yet, so her body trembled when he pressed it against the cloth.</p>
<p>Lucius gave her a short kiss on the cheek and forehead whenever this happened. He could feel the corners of his mouth rising joyfully.</p>
<p>“What if I don’t say I love you again?” she said out of the blue.</p>
<p>He stiffened for a moment and soon realized the meaning and relaxed.</p>
<p>She continued, pushing him in spite of herself. “There aren’t many people who say they love you and simply do… this.”</p>
<p>“And here you are.”</p>
<p>“Lucius.”</p>
<p>He burst into laughter and hugged her tightly as she said his name in a drawn-out manner. Then he took off his heavy uniform and disappeared behind the screen. Deatrice called him out of nowhere while he was organizing his badly prepared night clothes.</p>
<p>“Lucy.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>His answer was heard over the screen. Deatrice hesitated for a moment and asked. “…why don’t we start painting portraits now?”</p>
<p>“Portrait? Oh, Wilton did say he’d pay for it. ” He remembered what she was referring to and agreed, “Okay. Do you have an artist in mind?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t found anyone yet.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m fine with anyone as long as you like them.” Then he paused and corrected himself, “As long as you like<em> their art</em>.”</p>
<p>Coming up to her again and kissing her head, Lucius shortly went into the bathroom to wash.</p>
<p>Perhaps he didn’t put as much meaning into the portrait as she’d thought. Mhm. It’s not a big deal. Deatrice thought she shouldn’t be disappointed by his nonchalant and ambiguous reaction to her suggestion.</p>
<p>But to her, paintings symbolized the harmony of the home and that meant a lot to her now.</p>
