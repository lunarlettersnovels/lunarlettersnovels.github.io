            <p><strong>Chapter 256</strong></p>
<p>Each time Deatrice moved her tongue, Lucius’s body tensed involuntarily. She quickly realized that he wanted to move inside her mouth the same way he did when he pleasured himself. </p>
<p>There was no more space to take him deeper, but she forced herself to lower her head as much as possible, filling her mouth with his length. The feeling of his flesh pressing against the sensitive inner lining of her mouth was strange.</p>
<p>Lucius gripped her shoulder tightly, only to release it in a rush, as if afraid of hurting her. The fact that he was so desperate for her excited her.</p>
<p>“Dee…”</p>
<p>His voice barely managed to call out her name, strained with a pleading tone. Deatrice quickened her pace in response. Lucius’s hands, pale and trembling, gripped the bedsheets before he suddenly pulled her away, forcing her to stop. The reason was clear. He wanted to be inside her now.</p>
<p>Summoning a courage she didn’t know she had, Deatrice avoided his hands and instead climbed atop him of her own accord.</p>
<p>“Deatrice,” he called her name, surprise flickering across his handsome face. She wrapped her arms around his neck, kissing him, while her other hand slipped off her undergarments. Her excitement from earlier had left her wet. Lucius must have realized she intended to take control because his hand slid down to check how wet she was.</p>
<p>“Not yet… it’s not enough,” he said, lifting his lips from hers as if concerned. But Deatrice felt ready. She was burning with the desire to please him above all else. The moment she grasped his hardness and aligned it with herself, a thrill shot through her. Kissing Lucius’s flushed face, she slowly lowered herself onto him.</p>
<p>“Hngh… Uhn.”</p>
<p>There was a sharp pain as she lowered herself, perhaps because she wasn’t wet enough. The position—coming down from above—made it press even deeper inside her. Yet, that only heightened the sensation of his skin rubbing against hers. Lucius tilted his head back as his hand moved roughly against her lower body. Deatrice let out a sharp moan, jerking her hips as if to avoid his touch.</p>
<p>“God… Deatrice.”</p>
<p>His hips instinctively bucked upward, pushing into her. In response, Deatrice pulled her waist back, almost as if she was trying to escape.</p>
<p>“Lucius. Slowly,” she whispered, wrapping her other arm around his neck.</p>
<p>Lucius struggled to hold back, forcing himself to control his movements. His hand tentatively reached up to caress her breast.</p>
<p>But it was agonizingly slow. Deatrice awkwardly grasped his shoulders, trying to move her body, thrusting up and down. Yet every time his length entered deeply, pressing at unfamiliar angles, she tensed up and froze, her trembling thighs barely able to hold herself upright. Watching her strain to push further inside, Lucius felt a mix of sympathy and desire—he couldn’t hold back any longer.</p>
<p>Finally, he grabbed her hips and began thrusting upward. Deatrice, who had been trying to prepare herself and take things slowly, was overwhelmed by the sudden, intense stimulation.</p>
<p>“L-Luci—uhh, uhn… Lucius… haah.”</p>
<p>Her body rocked uncontrollably with each thrust. The only thing she could cling to was Lucius, yet he was the very source of her shaking. She couldn’t hold onto him any more than she could stop the trembling. Seeing how much she was struggling, Lucius gently laid her back down on the bed, taking control as he moved his hips with renewed intensity.</p>
<p>“Ah! Haah… ungh, ahh!”</p>
<p>Lost in the waves of pleasure crashing over them, they both surrendered to their instincts, exploring each other desperately. Deatrice’s breasts bounced with the rhythm of his thrusts. Lucius leaned down, biting into the soft flesh as he pounded into her.</p>
<p>“Nngh… haah.”</p>
<p>He climaxed soon after, releasing himself deep inside her. It had been a long time apart, and the amount he spilled was thick and copious. Lucius remained inside her, embracing her as her body gradually calmed. He stroked her, soothing her as he wiped away the tears that had unknowingly fallen down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Dee.”</p>
<p>It was a long while before he spoke again, his voice low as their eyes met.</p>
<p>“Please, don’t ever say you’ll leave me again.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She gazed at him through her tear-filled eyes, unable to look away. His lips pressed tenderly against her eyelids, the kiss filled with quiet pleading. How could she refuse him? She nodded, the gesture small but sincere. She no longer wanted to hurt him.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>The next morning, she awoke with a feeling as if she’d had a wonderful dream. Something akin to a room filled with gold, or the fluttering wings of a fairy.</p>
<p>Lucius was already gone, and Deatrice, relishing the rare, soft feel of smooth lingerie against her bare skin, basked in the bright, leisurely early afternoon.</p>
<p>She sat on a chair, pulling her knees to her chest, pondering what to do next.</p>
<p>However, when a maid brought her a late breakfast, a group of dark-clad guards visible through the door caught her attention.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Why are there so many guards outside the door?”</p>
