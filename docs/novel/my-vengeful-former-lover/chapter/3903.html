            <p><strong>Chapter 140</strong></p>
<p>“What are you doing? Why can’t you even close a drawer properly?”</p>
<p>“It’s because you suddenly came in.”</p>
<p>“But this is almost like my room now too. Should I knock then?” He chuckled lightly and joked, “Unless you’re hiding something?”</p>
<p>She said nothing for a moment. Meanwhile, Lucius put his lips on her injured finger and blew as if she would get better if he did that.</p>
<p>Noticing that she didn’t answer, Lucius shifted his gaze back to her. “What? Why aren’t you answering? Are you really hiding something?”</p>
<p>Without even realizing it, the lie just rolled off her tongue.</p>
<p>“Your present.” She smiled, “You bought a bunch of presents last time. I have to return the favor.”</p>
<p>A look of curiosity and joy passed across Lucius’ face.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Deatrice put a ‘hush’ finger to her lips and answered. “I’ll give it to you when it’s done.”</p>
<p>“Like last time, you’re making them by yourself?”</p>
<p>“That’s how it’s supposed to be.”</p>
<p>“If it means getting your fingers hurt like this, then don’t do it.” After clicking his tongue, Lucius rang a bell and had an attendant bring some ointment and bandages. He took her to the couch, sat her down, and wrapped the bandage around her finger with a disapproving gaze.</p>
<p>“You get sick and hurt often.”</p>
<p>“I don’t.”</p>
<p>“You were hurt not too long ago.” And then, Lucius stroked the back of her left hand. She had been hit by a stone while kissing him on the way home from Dixie’s house. Thankfully, it did not leave a scar.</p>
<p>Embarrassed, she lowered her eyes. It was then that she remembered what he had said.</p>
<p>“Are you embarrassed that you got hurt?”</p>
<p>It felt as if a part of her heart had been stabbed. She doubted that maybe the rejection he felt now was just the same as back then. She didn’t know the reason why she liked him and was not sure that she would stay with him.</p>
<p>Lucius asked as she lowered her head and seemed to be lost in her wandering thoughts.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>When she replied so directly, the corners of his lips lifted playfully. “Don’t you like me too much? But I have to leave soon and I won’t be able to see you for a while, so what will you do?”</p>
<p>“To where?”</p>
<p>“Rondini, there were monster sightings.”</p>
<p>The sudden statement took her by surprise. The memory of him collapsing into her arms, pale and wounded, was still so vivid for her. His body was hot and heavy as blood painted the floor red.</p>
<p>Lucius’ voice softened as if he had noticed the faint fear in her expression.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to worry about. The dungeons there are smaller in scale and monsters from those are usually weaker too.” He kissed her on the forehead, “I’ll finish it as soon as possible and arrive at the duke’s residence on time.”</p>
<p>Deatrice placed her cheek to his for a short moment before burying her face into his neck, asking.</p>
<p>“Then we’ll see each other at the duke’s mansion?”</p>
<p>“Probably.”</p>
<p>“When are you leaving?”</p>
<p>“In two days’ time.</p>
<p>When his date of departure was earlier than expected, she furrowed her eyebrows. The duke’s wedding was still a little over a month away.</p>
<p>When she didn’t answer, he continuously reassured her that he was safe by saying how many knights he was bringing with him and that most of their time would be spent on traveling rather than actually fighting those monsters.</p>
<p>At least, Deatrice thought he was reassuring her. Until his words got longer and longer, and she wondered if there was a different meaning behind his words.</p>
<p>“They say the scenery on the way from Rondini to the duke’s house is very beautiful and how Rochelle’s waterfalls are ethereally breathtaking. I’m thinking of stopping by if I have time, so it’s almost just like a trip. You really don’t have to worry.”</p>
<p>After that, Lucius resumed talking about famous places on his itinerary, such as the small artificial island in Shettle, the Benia Mountains, etc.</p>
<p>He didn’t say anything outright about being sorry that he had to go sightseeing without her, but Deatrice thought that maybe he secretly wanted her to go with him. She rolled her eyes for a moment, then asked cautiously.</p>
<p>“Should I go with you?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“You said that the working hours are not long anyway and it’s more like a trip. Then, can I go too?”</p>
<p>His face immediately brightened, like a child being handed his favorite toy. But he tried to mask his expression again and pretended to refuse.</p>
<p>“No, it’s dangerous. Besides, it would be boring, and it would be hard to move with the knights.”</p>
<p>“I’m alright with that.”</p>
<p>“You are alright?”</p>
<p>She suppressed a laugh and nodded, “Yes. I can’t really let you enjoy the sights alone, can I? I want to see the beautiful waterfalls in Rochelle too.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>Lucius couldn’t bear to speak after that. He blamed himself for showing that he wanted her to go together. Perhaps having read such a sense of guilt, Deatrice pressed her lips to his with a smile. “Let’s go together.”</p>
<p>When he didn’t answer, the kiss deepened a little.</p>
<p>As he lowered his head in a bit of concentration, Deatrice spoke again as she parted her lips.</p>
<p>“Let’s go together, alright?”</p>
<p>In the end, Lucius had no choice but to nod and kiss her.</p>
<p>And this was how their honeymoon, which was long overdue, was set.</p>
