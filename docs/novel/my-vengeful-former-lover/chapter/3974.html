            <p><strong>Chapter 69</strong></p>
<p>For the past two weeks, Lucius had dealt with an endless barrage of monsters from left and right, narrowing his search for the source until he was left with only a few possible choices.</p>
<p>Before him now was the dungeon suspected to have harbored all those monsters days prior. There were also findings that revealed how it might also possess a core. This makes this place the most dangerous and specific preparations were made just for this expedition.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what the researchers deduced and concluded based on stories of the ancient past when dragons run amok with magic. It was also said a holy sword of the Empire was sealed onto the ground and put them to eternal sleep.</p>
<p>There were still monsters in Alhen, but they pale in comparison to the legendary dragons of old.</p>
<p>Seeing as how everything they said was based on mere superstitions and rumors, the search wasn’t taken seriously by everyone. There were some that had been trapped here on more than one occasion and still said it was dangerous, but most of the researchers said there was no real need for worry because the monster’s core had died immediately.</p>
<p>This was the most probable reason because the core dying out would mean that the dungeon’s structure collapsed from its huge burst of energy that led to an earthquake which caused numerous monsters trapped inside to escape.</p>
<p>With the thought that all the hard work they’ve been putting on for a whole month was finally coming to an end, everyone went into the dungeon excitedly.</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been for Lucius’ stern instructions to thoroughly prepare down to the last detail, all of them would’ve torn the investigatory reports to shreds as soon as they had their hands on them.</p>
<p>Still, they did their job and surmised a dungeon of this size could only have a maximum of 5 floors.</p>
<p>After thoroughly examining the third floor, all they saw were slimes that looked like little monsters—insignificant things. Nothing else was found from the fourth basement down to the fifth.</p>
<p>“We’re going to go to a pub later, what about you, Commander?” One of the knights, who was slowly preparing himself for all possible obstacles, asked the commander.</p>
<p>Lucius answered with a frown, “I need to go back early.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Is the commander bailing on us?”</p>
<p>A knight mischievously asked, then another one playfully smacked him on the back.</p>
<p>“If it were me, I’d also choose a fragrant wife than a smelly bastard like you any day.”</p>
<p>Everyone gave a teasing remark after the other and deep, booming waves of laughter resounded within the enclosed walls of the dungeon. Lucius strengthened his grip on the sword he was holding and felt the handkerchief against his skin.</p>
<p>“Be quiet and focus.” He responded bluntly. However, Lucius couldn’t help but recall the sensation of how it felt to hold her hand right before he left.</p>
<p>Wearing clothes that seemed like they would melt from the slightest touch as her body exuded the scent of roses; the peaceful aura that surrounded her face when she smiled made his defenses against her crumble.</p>
<p><em>“Take care, and don’t get hurt…”</em></p>
<p>He had buried his face into her neck back then, thinking how his resolve and ambitions were slowly falling apart. A heavy question weighed on him.</p>
<p>If one day these feelings deepened—</p>
<p>—<em>could he give up everything for her?</em></p>
<p>He shook his head and put himself on alert. It was then that he heard a shout.</p>
<p>“Commander, there’s something here!”</p>
<p>And with that, the ground began to quake, and the knight leaders bellowed as the walls violently shook.</p>
<p>“Keep calm! Ready your weapons!”</p>
<p>“Assume battle positions!”</p>
<p>The ceiling collapsed and large debris started falling. The men protected themselves with their swords and evasion techniques, and successfully retreated from the area. But the ground was still shaking.</p>
<p>Another shout was heard.</p>
<p>“Commander, I think you should see this!”</p>
<p>Lucius nodded to the vice-commander and moved as the earthquake grew stronger. He was thrown several times against the wall, and when he led his body to where he assumed the voice came from, he saw several pillars resembling a temple.</p>
<p>“Report!” he ordered.</p>
<p>“Look, over there!”</p>
<p>Following the direction to where the knight was pointing, the ground shook once more, but it was at a more regular interval. As if the dungeon was alive and breathing.</p>
<p>Raising his arms to destroy falling debris, Lucius saw something wriggling behind a fog of dust. Something that occupied a large piece of ground squirming underneath the broken concrete.</p>
<p>“Shit! What’s that?!”</p>
<p>The knight who came with Lucius cursed out loud.</p>
<p>A monster, practically the size of the dungeon, was staring back at them with a sinister gaze.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>While praying, Deatrice turned to the sound of the door opening. But when Atkins was unable to deliver the news she wanted, she shook her head and turned her back to him, placing the thumbs of her crossed hands against her lips.</p>
<p>After keeping her silence, she spoke.</p>
<p>“It’s already been two days. How come there’s still no news…”</p>
<p>Atkins stood there, not knowing what to say, but he did try comforting her with a few words, “It won’t be too long, madam. Almost all of the collapsed entrance has been cleared, so he should be out soon. However, the priests outside the dungeon are expecting there might be a few casualties…”</p>
<p>Deatrice’s eyebrows furrowed. “Is there not a single one who can tell me what happened in there?”</p>
<p> </p>
