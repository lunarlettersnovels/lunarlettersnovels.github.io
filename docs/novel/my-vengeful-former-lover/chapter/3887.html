            <p><strong>Chapter 156</strong></p>
<p>“Are you in your right mind?” Dixie asked without realizing. “Why are you showing me this?”</p>
<p>They’re in a situation where they don’t have good feelings for each other. Dixie had never shown enough faith to be told these secrets. Deatrice laughed a little at Dixie’s serious eyes.</p>
<p>“Lucius knows about this too.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think he’s in the same position as me?”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to reassure you. I will never tell anyone what I saw today.”</p>
<p>“Everyone knows that it’s an affair anyway. I heard those rumors and misunderstood that you were spreading them, so now, now this secret, huh? What will you do if I babble around?”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll think of it again.”</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>She was just blown away by the calm reply. She pretended to be smart, but then made such a stupid and impulsive mistake, thinking that all the rumors she had heard about the marquess’ intelligence must have been lies.</p>
<p>Dixie hurriedly lowered the hem of her skirt to hide them, feeling that the mere sight of her washed, healed legs was revealing a great secret she had just learned.</p>
<p>Deatrice smiled and continued.</p>
<p>“I just have half of this divine power anyway. Because there are many restrictions. Of course, there are many cases where inexperienced people become true priests after training, but in my case, this inexperience only helped to keep me from becoming a priest.”</p>
<p>“How did my brother come to know about this?”</p>
<p>“Same case like yours. He came back that day covered in blood, but I couldn’t hide it. There is no priest, and it will not stop bleeding. So, I treated him.”</p>
<p>“So, did he wake up and confess his love to you?” She asked sarcastically, but Deatrice just shook her head with a smile.</p>
<p>“No. When he woke up, he immediately asked me to annul the marriage.”</p>
<p>“…Well, no matter what, now the two of you can’t live without each other.”</p>
<p>Responding brusquely, Dixie looked elsewhere. She knew that in reality that it must have been much more complicated than that, but she didn’t want to hear any more about her happy brother and Deatrice.</p>
<p>The momentary surprise was gone, and now her reality, a gloomy, miserable one, hung over Dixie’s face.</p>
<p>In the dark warehouse, only candles burned endlessly with silence. Dixie looked at the flickering candles and the swaying shadows, and involuntarily let out a strange sound.</p>
<p>“Perhaps… Can you get rid of a child with divine power?”</p>
<p>Dixie, the one who spoke, was also surprised. It was the first time she knew that she had these thoughts. She, of course, stared hatefully at her protruding belly in her mirror, although there were a few dimly recollections of her having eye contact with herself.</p>
<p>Still, the thought of wanting the child to disappear… No, has she never really thought of that?</p>
<p>Dixie sat with a heavy heart, her mind consumed by the night she had spent with Raymond, the endless war they had waged against each other, and the constant feeling of being insulted. It was as though her stomach had been replaced with a void that even the joys of life couldn’t fill.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a wave of fear and unease swept over Dixie, and she found herself clinging to Raymond, her body trembling with chills. But to her surprise, it was not his voice that she heard. Instead, a calm and unfamiliar voice answered her.</p>
<p>“Well. I’ve never done it, so I don’t know.”</p>
<p>And that carefree attitude allowed Dixie to be more stubborn. Dixie demanded as firmly as she had thought so many times.</p>
<p>“Then give it a try on me now.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Dixie led Deatrice’s hand and put it on her stomach.</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Do it.”</p>
<p>Eventually, Deatrice slowly corrected her posture, put her hand on her stomach and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>She could feel the white light enveloping her stomach. Deatrice’s low voice murmured words, and by then Dixie had to close her eyes tightly. But it wasn’t long before Dixie realized that the holy words she chanted were prayers of blessing, which she had uttered before at Dixie’s house, laying on her bed.</p>
<p>[I wish you and your lovely child good health and happiness forever.]</p>
<p>Dixie frowned and cried for a long time with her head hanging.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“I know that all of this is my responsibility anyway.”</p>
<p>Dixie’s eyes showed seriousness, as if she was counting the challenges ahead. She put her hand on her own big belly and said she would make the decision for herself and her child in the future, whatever the cost.</p>
<p>And, saying that she would leave later, she politely asked Deatrice to leave first.</p>
<p>It might have been the first time that she seemed uneasy, but now there was no reason for Deatrice to refuse the request, so in the end, she returned to the room as told, and there was no news about Dixie after that.</p>
