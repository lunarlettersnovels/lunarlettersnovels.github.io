            <p><strong>Chapter 145</strong></p>
<p>Lucius and Deatrice arrived at the duke’s place four days before the wedding.</p>
<p>During the two-week-long trip, both had a free and enjoyable time. That’s why even though they’d arrived at the duke’s residence for official business, for a moment, they felt as if they had simply arrived at their next tourist destination.</p>
<p>However, as soon as they were guided by an attendant and entered the mansion, the duke, as well as the soon-to-be Duchess of Elbarra and former Marchioness of Troy, came out to meet them.</p>
<p>The pleasant vacation air that accompanied their journey dissipated the moment they met and was replaced by pasted smiles.</p>
<p>The duke lightly embraced his daughter and spoke after shaking Lucius’ hands. “The both of you look well. I heard you have been circling the neighborhood?”</p>
<p>Deatrice lightly kissed her father on the cheek as she was accustomed to and exchanged a short hug with the former Marchioness of Troy who was standing behind him.</p>
<p>“Lucius and I did not have the luxury of time for a honeymoon. So, when he was in a situation where he had to go Rondini’s for a long time, rather than going alone, he begged me to go with him.”</p>
<p>“If you came from Rondini then you must have passed through Chapolla!” The former Marchioness of Troy exclaimed in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>Chapolla was the oldest temple in the empire. She may have said this probably because she knew of Deatrice’s interests. However, they didn’t actually visit the place because Lucius had no interest in that particular temple whatsoever.</p>
<p>Still, Deatrice calmly nodded and replied, “Of course. It is as wondrous as what I’ve heard.”</p>
<p>She had no qualms about telling a little lie. After all, this short conversation they were having now was just a formality, and rather than prolonging the agony by telling the truth, it was enough to just reply in the most convenient way possible.</p>
<p>Lucius’ gaze briefly touched Deatrice’s person and the obvious lie she’d just said.</p>
<p>“Right, will the two of you leave for a vacation after the wedding?” he interjected, stepping between them with a familiar social smile on his face.</p>
<p>The former Marchioness of Troy blushed and the duke shook his hand that had her palm in it, donning a stiff smile on his face. “I would not like to do something that’s not fitting for my age.”</p>
<p>“Well.” Lucius gave an assessing eye over the duke’s body, “It may be a bit difficult, but I still think it’s a good opportunity for the two of you to become closer—”</p>
<p>“You’re young, so why don’t you do it instead?” The duke cut off his words and turned around. “Now, about that trip, let’s go inside and talk some more.”</p>
<p>It was three days before his wedding and most of the important guests were already in his mansion, yet the duke was not prudent enough to set aside a table for them to avoid these guests. The words ‘talk some more’ will just be scattered in the wind the moment he meets someone else with more power and influence.</p>
<p>Deatrice, Lucius, and even the former Marchioness of Troy knew it.</p>
<p>How could Deatrice—or anyone else for that matter—think that the future Duchess who was only ten years older than her, had fallen in love with her father and had become one of those ‘who couldn’t afford to travel’? She was still an ex-Marchioness with some wealth to her name, after all.</p>
<p>She glanced sideways.</p>
<p>However, as soon as the future Duchess entered the hall, she picked up a small puppy that greeted her and introduced her to Deatrice.</p>
<p>“She’s already seven this year and gave birth to five puppies not long ago. Would you like to see them? You may take them if you want.”</p>
<p>At the same time, she lifted the puppy’s paw and waved it to greet her like a human.</p>
<p>Deatrice was not as interested in the woman her father chose for his marriage but seeing her holding a dog like this reminded her of the rumors she had heard about her without realizing it.</p>
<p>The rumors say that this woman got married for the first time more than ten years ago and, since losing a child in an accident three years ago, she always had about thirty dogs at home. Then, after her husband fell ill and died recently, she happened to be associated with the duke and became engaged to him.</p>
<p>At one time, she became quite famous for her beautiful looks and great background as a virgin, but after the death of her son and the loss of her husband, she received more reviews as a pitiful and somehow unfortunate woman.</p>
<p>People talked about why the duke chose such an unfortunate woman. But considering the fact that she has no children, is still of noble lineage, and is related to the royal family of the neighboring country of Alhen meant that her future child with the duke can gain a right of succession to the throne.</p>
<p>Hence, all the misfortune this woman experienced weighs little in comparison to the benefits that her father would receive, hence his decision to wed the rumored widow with bad luck. Her father isn’t superstitious, to begin with anyways.</p>
<p>However, he will most definitely not be pleased by the dogs that his new wife will bring in.</p>
