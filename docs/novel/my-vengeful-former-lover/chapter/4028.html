            <p><strong>Chapter 15</strong></p>
<p>“No matter what, I will definitely marry you, so you don’t have to worry about that. Besides, no matter how angry my sister gets, her nature is inherently good. She won’t make things difficult for us.”</p>
<p>“I know Belle is a good person. I was just asking if you were putting off the marriage because she disagrees…”</p>
<p>“Really? I didn’t know you thought of Dixie quite positively.”</p>
<p>Towards Lucius’ words, Deatrice went silent for a moment before answering.</p>
<p>“I’ve always felt sorry for her. She had to marry in a hurry because of… what happened.” she shook her head. “Not to mention, at the last ball, Belle had gotten mad in my stead.”</p>
<p>“She got mad?”</p>
<p>Lucius did not expect this kind of development.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Deatrice nodded. “Because Eva Way called me ‘cursed’ because of the way my fiancées would meet misfortune one after the other and how the next one would be unlucky as well. It was then that Belle got angry and told her to stop.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Eva Way must’ve been disappointed. She would have loved to see what would happen if you met a new lover, but she’s bound to be disappointed since you’re getting married to the first one.”</p>
<p>Although he responded casually on the outside, Lucius’ insides became cold with contempt for Eva Way.</p>
<p>That woman had always been jealous of Deatrice and would talk about her behind her back. Especially during the time when she was engaged for the second time to the second prince of Galaba.</p>
<p>Eva Way was the one who was the most vocal on the side criticizing Lucius’ and Deatrice’s relationship, she had even surveyed to see how people reacted last time. During that time, Lucius had remained silent because he himself couldn’t understand Deatrice’s actions at all, and why she chose Fredhi.</p>
<p>But now that he was with her again, not a peep could be heard from that gossipy woman as of yet.</p>
<p>In fact, Eva Way’s influence was practically nonexistent during the most recent gatherings hosted by dignified individuals. However, it was like she always had the need to be provocative with a drink on her hand at all times and chit chat with other people.</p>
<p>As a result, for the more unsavory get-togethers, Way’s presence still made itself known.</p>
<p><em>“It’s a really funny reunion between them. Not even romantic in the slightest. It is a combination of low-quality empathy and comfort between two people who are trying to salvage what is already destroyed.”</em></p>
<p>She would say.</p>
<p>Lucius thought to himself.</p>
<p><em>Hm. Perhaps now is the time for Eva Way’s downfall.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, he felt a gaze from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Lucius recollected himself from his thoughts, combed Deatrice’s tangled hair with his fingers and kissed her forehead.</p>
<p>Deatrice’s body became rigid.</p>
<p>She had been playing along with him for two months already, but she still can’t seem to get used to being touched like this.</p>
<p>Lucius suddenly felt the urge to bite her cheek to punish her, but quickly shrugged off the thought by putting on a languid smile and chuckled, “So jumpy.”</p>
<p>“You’re just too sudden.” Deatrice said while pretending to be calm. Registering the implications of his actions, she asked, “Who is it?”</p>
<p>“Lady Saint Elle, on your right.”</p>
<p>“Just like a ghost.”</p>
<p>“Who? Me or Lady Saint Elle?”</p>
<p>Deatrice said something else without answering his question. “Just answer me, when are you going to propose?”</p>
<p>Lucius replied in a sickly sweet voice. “No need to rush, sweetheart. I’ll do it soon.”</p>
<p>“And when exactly is ‘soon’?”</p>
<p>“Won’t it be even more exciting if I don’t tell you?” He whispered with an enigmatic smile.</p>
<p>Deatrice noticed that he wasn’t going to answer.</p>
<p><em>What’s the reason for his delay, then?</em></p>
<p>She frowned because she didn’t understand, but just then, she recalled the words she heard at the ball.</p>
<p><em>“I’ve heard rumors of him having an affair with Berry Spirt these days.”</em></p>
<p>She wondered if the rumors were true.</p>
<p>If they were, it was possible that Lucius was dragging out the marriage because he didn’t want to end things with her.</p>
<p>Deatrice’s mind had already gone through numerous situations wherein the legal wives were insulted because of their husband’s infidelity.</p>
<p><em>Well, she ‘is’ pretty. So…</em> Deatrice thought.</p>
<p>Berry Spirt, daughter of a southern baroness, had already lost her aristocratic status. But it didn’t matter that much because she was very wealthy. On top of it all, she was a lovable girl that had a good upbringing, quite famous in the social circles for her lively personality and friendly demeanor.</p>
<p>She definitely would’ve treated Lucius well, no matter what his past was.</p>
<p>The thought that Lucius might’ve given his heart to such a light-hearted girl was not a far-fetched reality. It was highly likely that it was true.</p>
<p><em>Then, our marriage would simply be a loveless one.</em></p>
<p>Deatrice muttered inside her heart.</p>
<p>It was unreasonable of her to expect Lucius to remain faithful to her when they don’t even have feelings for each other. Perhaps, he might even have scandals like other men stuck in unwanted arranged marriages.</p>
<p>Many ladies had probably fantasized about marrying Lucius, but here she was, already wanting to get as far away from their engagement as soon as the opportunity presented itself.</p>
<p>Deatrice was already constructing scenarios in her head where she would suffer at the hands of his numerous mistresses during their marriage, when Lucius abruptly pulled her up.</p>
<p>He flicked a finger on Deatrice’s forehead, which had already creased into a frown. “Don’t overthink too much about my proposal. I’ll make sure you’ll be satisfied.”</p>
<p>He answered confidently.</p>
<p>Deatrice wanted to ask who exactly would be satisfied between the two of them, when Lucius promptly bowed his head and kissed the outer corner of her eye. Her eyelids fluttered, and she had no choice but to close them.</p>
<p>She could sense it.</p>
<p>His kiss, though hollow and detached coming from his lips, still made her feel warm and sweet.</p>
