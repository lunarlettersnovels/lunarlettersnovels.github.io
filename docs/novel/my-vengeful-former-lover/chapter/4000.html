            <p><strong>Chapter 43</strong></p>
<p>Deatrice was largely uninterested in others’ affairs and that didn’t change much even after she became his lover. When they were dating, she didn’t pay much attention to what he did like knowing the social clubs he went to or who were the friends he had made.</p>
<p>As Lucius glanced at her without saying a word, she spoke in a slightly trembling voice, as if reading into his suspicions.</p>
<p>“I know I’ve been indifferent all this time. But as you said, we are a couple, and we have to nurture a good relationship with each other.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Skepticism still remained on his face.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m reminded of the fact that I shouldn’t have to always rely on you, and you shouldn’t be the only one putting in the effort.”</p>
<p>Maybe he should’ve remained dubious of her intentions even after she had said those words. However, Lucius trusted his own judgment and fell into the illusion that he knew her all too well.</p>
<p>To him, Deatrice was still the inexperienced lover of six years ago and the arrogant daughter of a duke. He thought that she wasn’t the kind of woman who would do such a troublesome thing with hidden intentions because it was beneath her.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she must’ve given up because she was also tired of fighting with him.</p>
<p>Therefore, Lucius’ doubts were dispelled, and he believed Deatrice’s words.</p>
<p>He lowered his guard and began talking about the Knights Templar, what kind of men they were, and some major things that happened on the battlefield. He chose the topics he assumed that ladies and young girls liked the most.</p>
<p>While speaking, Lucius would check Deatrice’s reaction from time to time and found that she was still listening to him without showing any signs of boredom. Because of this, it naturally led him to delve deeper into his storytelling and even discussed with her heavy subjects such as territories as well as the future direction of his knights.</p>
<p>In this regard, Deatrice actually gave some pretty helpful advice.</p>
<p>Lucius barely even realized that they were walking further away from the table when all of a sudden, her hand touched his cheek and he finally saw that they were already near the main entrance.</p>
<p>Deatrice gave him a radiant smile, “Come back safely.”</p>
<p><em>She was seeing him off…</em></p>
<p>Soon, she lifted her heels and pulled his head lower. Then she kissed him on the cheek.</p>
<p>Lucius felt the soft touch of her lips and soon, her scent and warmth engulfed his senses. He tried to place his hand on her waist out of habit, but then he abruptly clenched his fists.</p>
<p>“What is this…” He said with a frown.</p>
<p>She blinked twice, signaling him to look around. It was only due to that small gaze that he realized she had done this because the servants’ gazes were pinned on them.</p>
<p>He should play along and give them a natural performance like he usually does, like showing her a loving smile and being affectionate with his actions.</p>
<p>But it didn’t work out the way he wanted.</p>
<p>After several attempts, his face remained stiff, and his smile was awkward to say the least. He could only blurt out three words without his usual flattery.</p>
<p>“Sure, I will.”</p>
<p>But as he closed the door and went down the stairs, Lucius thought about her brief kiss and how natural it felt to want to grab her by the waist.</p>
<p><em>Like how they were six years ago.</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Deatrice watched Lucius moving away and muttered to herself.</p>
<p>“Fool.”</p>
<p>She simply wanted to upgrade her acting to another level to better deceive others, she just didn’t expect that even Lucius would fall for it.</p>
<p><em>Hm…</em></p>
<p>It must be possible for him to accept her, even if she had changed so quickly without rhyme or reason. He must’ve concluded that there was no real reason for her to get revenge.</p>
<p>Mhm. He didn’t take into account that possibility at all.</p>
<p><em>Well, there’s nothing really bad about it if he chose to believe me.</em></p>
<p>Deatrice thought, and then waved her hands to his back with a smile, like the loving wife that most people expected of her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It’s been some time since Deatrice’s ‘kind revenge’ began. The couple ate together every day now and talked about how each other’s day went.</p>
<p>He would speak about knights and estates; she would talk about books she had read and her leisurely walks. No one would initiate to probe further into a deeper topic, but anyway, this type of conversation was comforting to the both of them.</p>
<p>Lucius quickly adapted to these harmless changes.</p>
<p>Deatrice also felt that the servants looked at her differently day by day and thought that things were going smoothly according to her plan. But at the same time, when the relationship between him and her was going so well, she felt confused.</p>
<p>Did she really want revenge or a genuine restoration of their marriage?</p>
<p>At one point in time, Lucius was feeling puzzled as well, so he had told her this during one of their meals and Deatrice recalled it at this moment.</p>
<p><em>“If you’re unsure of a relationship, then—”</em></p>
<p>She inhaled sharply.</p>
<p>He was respectful to her and even publicly wooed her, but Deatrice still felt uncertain at times and pushed him away.</p>
<p>Like what was happening right now. Lucius, with the sweetest face in the world, was kneeling at her feet and holding her hand, saying, “If you’re confused, we can just kiss.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Just let our lips touch ever so lightly. It’s not too difficult.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” At his absurd suggestion, Deatrice put her hand against his chest and pushed him away.</p>
<p>But with the graceful smile still plastered on his handsome face, Lucius appeared confident. For him, rather than a gimmick, it felt like some plausible theory that he would be able to reach her now.</p>
<p><em>If you’re unsure of a relationship, then go for a kiss…</em></p>
<p>He continued persuading her, “How about this. If we feel nothing even after we kiss each other, I won’t bother you anymore. Isn’t that a wonderful opportunity to push me out completely?”</p>
<p>“But kissing on the lips is something you do with a person you love.” she hesitated, “On top of that, the two of us are in a pretend marriage. I can barely even call you a friend.”</p>
<p>“A pretend marriage still means we’re married. Therefore, it isn’t so wrong to kiss my lawfully wedded wife, right? Besides, we’re the only ones here…”</p>
<p>Lucius said as servants took elusive glances at them from inconspicuous locations.</p>
