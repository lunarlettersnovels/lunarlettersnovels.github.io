            <p><strong>Chapter 247</strong></p>
<p>“Will Sir Elliot really execute the Duke?”</p>
<p>This question, which had suddenly become a hot topic, was causing quite a stir not just in the Empire but also in Galaba. In Ponto, where Lucius had visited, the talk was even more intense, and as a result, Deatrice was forced to endure the students’ endless debates day after day.</p>
<p>The students would gather near the terrace of the room where Deatrice stayed, sitting in groups and looking out over the garden as they discussed.</p>
<p>“Surely, he wouldn’t go so far as to behead his father-in-law, would he?”</p>
<p>“He might. The Duke insulted his mother and father, and thanks to him, Lucius spent six years barely surviving on the battlefield. Of course, he’d want revenge.”</p>
<p>“But then, what about the Duke’s daughter, the one he married?”</p>
<p>“They’ll probably find a way to annul the marriage. I wouldn’t be able to stay with him if I were in her shoes.”</p>
<p>As one student shuddered at the thought, another propped their chin on their hand and mused romantically.</p>
<p>“But the Lady and Sir Elliott were so close. What if their love hasn’t faded? Then it would be hard for him to kill the Duke, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>“But the newspaper said the Lady left the estate some time ago, claiming she was going away to recuperate.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Everyone made brief sounds of contemplation. Deatrice, meanwhile, tapped the flower buds in a vase and swallowed all her worries inside. The bright summer sun shone down on Deatrice’s face, oblivious to her inner turmoil.</p>
<p>“What’s there to think about? She left. Sir Elliott probably sent her away because he didn’t want to be around her anymore.”</p>
<p>“Or maybe it’s not that at all. Perhaps the Duke is hiding the Lady, planning to use her as leverage in negotiations!”</p>
<p>With that, the playful students began quoting lines from a popular play that had recently been making the rounds.</p>
<p>“Devil! Return my wife to me.”</p>
<p>“Here, I have brought the water from Tempest’s spring!”</p>
<p>“Use this love potion to revive my wife. I will give my life in exchange.”</p>
<p>Laughter, the distinct sound of girls’ giggles, followed as they mimicked the play’s scenes. As the lively reenactment continued behind her, Deatrice focused on tidying her bed. A short knock came at the door.</p>
<p>“Miss Fram, Priestess Sophie is here to see you.”</p>
<p>There was nothing surprising about it; Sophie frequently checked in on her to see how she was doing. Deatrice went out to the garden, where Sophie waited for her. However, that day, Sophie looked unusually troubled. When Deatrice found her praying near the fountain statue, Sophie’s face stiffened as soon as she saw her, and she seemed distracted throughout their conversation.</p>
<p>Deatrice had a premonition that Sophie was about to deliver bad news. And sure enough, Sophie soon informed her that the Duke was waiting for her in town.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. It seems the Duke found out about your whereabouts because of me. He said there’s something he absolutely must discuss with you.”</p>
<p>It was obvious that it would be about Lucius.</p>
<p>Deatrice already felt weary at the thought, but she didn’t want to burden Sophie unnecessarily, so she decided not to avoid the meeting. After quickly getting ready, she headed to the inn where the Duke was waiting.</p>
<p>The place was swarming with the Duke’s knights from when she arrived. As soon as they saw Deatrice, they bowed and led her to where the Duke was.</p>
<p>Even the best inn in the area seemed beneath the Duke’s standards.</p>
<p>He sat rigidly, as if even touching anything in the room was unpleasant, his gaze sweeping around in irritation. But when his eyes landed on his daughter’s appearance, he seemed momentarily stunned into silence.</p>
<p>Deatrice knew how she must look to him. She was dressed plainly, like a servant, in a simple gown with none of the usual formality.</p>
<p>In the past, the Duke’s gaze would have made her cheeks burn with shame, a constant pressure to present a perfect image to her father driving her actions. But now, she couldn’t care less.</p>
<p>“I heard you were looking for me,” Deatrice said quietly as she took a seat across from him. The Duke remained silent for a moment, leaning on his cane as if lost for words. Finally, he sighed and spoke.</p>
<p>“I believe you already have an idea why I’ve come to see you.”</p>
<p>His voice was low, almost pleading, as if trying to elicit sympathy from her. He spoke without shame about the humiliation he had suffered.</p>
<p>“Lucius is relentless. You must have heard about Filbert. He gathered people and almost had him executed. They say Filbert’s son was stabbed in his arms and legs. How can a man be so brutal? You know Filbert. He was at my wedding, at yours. You even stayed at his house for almost a year when you were younger. And yet…”</p>
<p>“Just say what you need to say, Father.” Deatrice interrupted coldly.</p>
<p>The Duke, momentarily stunned by her icy tone, looked at her with a hurt expression.</p>
<p>“Have you lost all affection for me? Your father is speaking, and Filbert was nothing but kind to you. Even if you think nothing of me, what did he ever do to deserve this? But I suppose you’ll say it’s justified. I didn’t want to come to you either.”</p>
<p>“But here you are.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“And now you’ll start talking about Lucius again. I’m tired of all of these, Father. Do you still see me as a jewel to be traded whenever it suits you?”</p>
<p>“What else could I do?” the Duke snapped in frustration.</p>
<p>“After what happened in Galaba a year ago, I have few knights left. Lucius has successfully cut off all my support. I’m nothing but a weak old man now. Losing my lands is only a matter of time. Will you only regret it after you see my head roll?”</p>
<p>“Just endure it,” Deatrice said coldly, not blinking.</p>
<p>“I told you before, you need to face the consequences of what you’ve done.”</p>
<p>“Ungrateful wretch,” the Duke spat, his voice filled with disgust. Deatrice no longer believed anything meaningful would come from this conversation, so she stood up to leave. But then the Duke spoke again.</p>
<p>“I said I would relinquish the duchy.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You called me cold-blooded, but even I am not without guilt for the innocent lives lost because of me.”</p>
<p>“The duchy will be Lucius’s either way,” Deatrice replied without hesitation.</p>
