            <p><strong>Chapter 250</strong></p>
<p>Everything was the same as before she left. The only difference was that now, Lucius would get out of bed first and settle on the sofa.</p>
<p>Naturally, their once effortless physical affection had also noticeably decreased. Furthermore, Lucius seemed overly cautious about every touch between them. Even when an escort was inevitable, he often acted strangely.</p>
<p>Whenever she placed her hand on his arm, as was customary, he would stare at it as if it were something out of place.</p>
<p>“Lucius.”</p>
<p>Even now, he stared at her hand until that call broke the moment, and he awkwardly turned his head. Deatrice, watching the side of his face as he turned, only adjusted her posture and looked ahead after the attendant instructed them to wait.</p>
<p>They were currently waiting in the hallway in front of the Emperor’s chamber to meet him. Today was the day the Duke would officially swear to transfer his title to Lucius.</p>
<p>Several nobles and relatives of the Duke, who took this matter seriously, were already inside, performing their duties as witnesses. The Duke likely received a sacred ritual from hours earlier, preparing for the vow he would carry in his heart.</p>
<p>In contrast, Lucius’ role would end once he completed the ceremony in the Emperor’s chamber and engraved the seal on the inside of his wrist.</p>
<p>“Sir Elliot, Lady Elliot.”</p>
<p>The attendant informed them that it was their turn.</p>
<p>As soon as Deatrice and Lucius entered, they knelt and bowed to the Emperor.</p>
<p>The room was lavishly decorated, with the ceiling and pillars adorned in gold. On the ceiling was a depiction of a hunting scene from the myth of Wikeburg, and behind the Emperor’s throne stood two statues of Sedanskel, the symbol of the Empire, gazing down upon them.</p>
<p>The Emperor stood below them and spoke in a grave voice.</p>
<p>“Duke Luyden, today you are here to officially transfer the title of Duke to your son-in-law, Lucius Elliot. Is that correct?”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>The Duke answered, stepping forward. A low murmur of discontent rippled through parts of the room. It was likely coming from the Duke’s relatives, still unable to fully come to terms with the situation.</p>
<p><em>Will they continue to act like this even after Lucius inherits the dukedom?</em> Deatrice wondered, disgusted.</p>
<p>She was certain they would.</p>
<p>After all, Lucius was merely “inheriting” the title. He would receive it without disturbing the long-standing roots that upheld the duchy. People would use tradition as an excuse to wage political battles, weakening his authority. Had Lucius claimed the title through conquest, none of this would have been necessary.</p>
<p>“Lucius Elliot.”</p>
<p>At the Emperor’s call, Lucius stepped forward. A priest touched Lucius’ forehead with holy water and began to recite a chant. A brilliant light erupted from the priest’s hand, etching the ceremonial mark inside Lucius’ wrist.</p>
<p>Lucius knelt and recited his vow of submission before the Emperor, pledging his loyalty to both the gods and the empire.</p>
<p>“I, Lucius Elliot, swear to devote my body to the empire before the all-seeing eyes of Wikeburg. No sorrow shall harden my body, and my heart shall cease to beat only for the empire.”</p>
<p>“The empire will never forget your devotion. Both of you, rise now.”</p>
<p>At the Emperor’s command, Lucius and the Duke rose together. The Duke extended his hand, and Lucius bent to kiss the ring symbolizing the title.</p>
<p>Deatrice, watching the long, tedious ceremony from a step back, glanced at the Emperor, who looked as bored as she felt.</p>
<p><em>What does the Emperor really think about all this?</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t because Lucius had saved the Emperor’s life that he had been given so much power. It was precisely because Lucius had come from such a lowly background. The Emperor had supported him just enough to use him as he saw fit. Now that Lucius was becoming a Duke, the Emperor could no longer treat him the same way.</p>
<p>He would no longer be able to push around a knight he had once exploited. Surely, the Emperor wasn’t thrilled about that. Especially after that night when Lucius revealed his secret—when he accused the Emperor of seeking revenge on Deatrice.</p>
<p>Since then, their relationship had grown undeniably strained.</p>
<p>What had Lucius done to make the Emperor accept his inheritance of the dukedom so easily?</p>
<p>Looking back on it, Deatrice wondered what the Emperor thought of all this.</p>
<p>The reason he had given Lucius so much support wasn’t because Lucius had saved his life, but because he came from such a lowly background. He had used Lucius for all he was worth, giving him just enough power to be useful. But now that Lucius was about to become a duke, the Emperor wouldn’t be able to treat him the same way anymore.</p>
<p>No longer being able to control the knight he had so easily manipulated before wouldn’t have been a pleasant feeling. And after that night when Lucius had exposed his secret, claiming he didn’t want revenge on Deatrice, it seemed their relationship had seriously soured.</p>
<p>What had Lucius done to make the Emperor so easily accept him inheriting the title of duke?</p>
