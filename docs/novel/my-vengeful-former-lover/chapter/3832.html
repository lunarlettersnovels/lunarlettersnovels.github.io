            <p><strong>Chapter 211</strong></p>
<p>Appearing in hastily thrown-together attire, the duke, as if just roused from sleep, displayed evident displeasure at being disturbed.</p>
<p>“You rode through the rain, soaking wet, causing such a scene to reach here. What in the world are you thinking? Didn’t you recently shoot at the prince, only to be expelled from the palace? Is this some kind of lingering rebellion? What’s dissatisfying you?”</p>
<p>The duke, in an unusually raised voice, scolded Deatrice, who remained silent. Unable to tolerate it any longer, she raised her hands to cover her face.</p>
<p>“Speak up. You already called and roused me at this hour.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Is it because of the prince? Rumor has it he’s so desperate to have you back, even after being shot, that he’s willing to overlook it all. Is that bothering you? Are you afraid of parting ways with Lucius again?”</p>
<p>Knowing that Deatrice’s emotions revolved solely around Lucius, the duke was well aware that this incident was most likely related to him. The moment Deatrice informed him, without any prior consultation, that she had received a proposal was genuinely shocking.</p>
<p>Without ever considering Lucius Fenry was a match for Deatrice, the duke, in a fit of rage, forbade her from going out again, insisting that she wouldn’t meet Lucius a second time.</p>
<p>At that time, Deatrice remained silent for a while, eventually stating that “marriage is a matter for the parties involved” and that “if father insisted on such a matter, I have no choice but to resort to old methods.”</p>
<p>With these words, she leaped off the terrace.</p>
<p>As the height of this floor prevented severe injuries, she only broke her leg. However, had the fall been from a slightly greater height, it could have been much worse. The duke, not wanting news of his daughter jumping from the terrace due to a man to spread, immediately summoned a clergyman to treat her.</p>
<p>Since that day, Deatrice and Lucius openly acknowledged their engagement, keeping no secrets from those around them.</p>
<p>“Why on earth are you like that when you say you’re not going to like the marriage with Lucius and you’re going to live and die? It is natural for a couple to celebrate their first night together. Even if your father meddled a bit, things went better for both of you. You’ve been ignoring my calls for months.”</p>
<p>The duke told her, talking about her first night with Lucius when he sent an attendant to check if they had consummated the wedding. From that day on, Deatrice has not talked to her father.</p>
<p>The duke, appearing somewhat bitter and disappointed implied that he was tired of their problems, spoke with his tongue clucked.</p>
<p>For him, witnessing a couple who caused an uproar by threatening to annul their marriage at that time, now potentially heading towards separation, felt quite tedious.</p>
<p>Although he felt sorry for his only daughter, who had come this far in distress, the duke believed he had to make it clear that he could not help. There was simply no reason for the duke to oppose this matter, which would undoubtedly involve the prince and even the emperor.</p>
<p>He had always been more interested in his daughter’s status than her happiness.</p>
<p>There was no need for him to intervene when the situation would resolve itself. If it caused pain for a while now, with time, he was confident that Deatrice would bear no resentment toward him soon.</p>
<p>Just as he forced the couple’s first night together, it was a matter of time before everything fell into place. Deatrice and Lucius love each other now</p>
<p>“If you came because of the prince, then go back. There’s nothing I can do about it. In the end, it will go the way the emperor and the prince want. Moreover, it’s not all that bad for you. Originally, your marriage was regrettable. Even though you received the emperor’s favor and a title, Lucius is just a bastard. But look at the prince. He promised to become queen without my help.</p>
<p>So, calm your mind and watch how things unfold. Of course, if you want, you can stay here for a few days until the situation is resolved. Act wisely, Deatrice, and don’t let your past passion lead you to make rash decisions again.”</p>
<p>“What kind of trouble did I cause?”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, don’t act recklessly. Anyway, you’re my daughter, and I care for you more than you think. Just remember that, okay?”</p>
<p>While saying this, the duke sat beside her, laying his hand on her back as if consoling her, appearing like an affectionate father.</p>
<p>She stared blankly at his hand, thinking that if there had been any energy left and something sharp nearby, she would have willingly used it to pierce the duke’s hand. He made her nauseous.</p>
<p>How could a person be like this?</p>
<p>Lucius, just a bastard? Who was the one responsible for making him that way? How could he talk so casually about it, knowing all the facts? Had the duke ever felt remorse once in his life, even a fleeting moment, for turning Lucius’ time into a hell worse than death? Did he ever recall the wasted time that could have been avoided?</p>
<p>As far as Deatrice could remember, he hadn’t.</p>
<p>When Lucius returned as a knight, the duke reacted as if an annoying obstacle had appeared again.</p>
<p>The duke expressed annoyance like Lucius’ return was as bothersome as when he had been made a bastard. Even before a proper verdict, he insisted they should get rid of him.</p>
<p>Deatrice pulled her hand away from the duke and stood up. The duke appeared confused and muttered, “What’s happening with you?”</p>
