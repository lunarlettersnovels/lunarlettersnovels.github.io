            <p><strong>Chapter 204</strong></p>
<p>It was a persona the emperor brought out when he needed to show a greater level of loyalty from Lucius, a creation of the emperor’s making.</p>
<p>“Over the past year, you’ve endured quite a lot.”</p>
<p>The emperor struggled to speak.</p>
<p>“Especially since the appearance of the monsters, I’ve been pushing you hard as the only weapon I have at my disposal, just as much as I have pushed myself.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But you’ve always responded to my excessive expectations without fault. Your knights have handled the monsters effectively with their well-honed skills. Of course, it was fortunate that no dangerous monsters came out, damaging the seals. Nevertheless, I cannot deny the greatness of your efforts. So now, I’m considering giving you a greater role. Putting down your sword, standing completely by my side. What do you think?”</p>
<p>Putting down his sword meant that Lucius would stand in the heart of power, with no further dangers to face. The reward was more significant than he had expected. However, he felt no particular enthusiasm. After all, it wasn’t something he had desired.</p>
<p>Lucius nodded, bowing his head slightly.</p>
<p>“I’m grateful for your generous acknowledgment of my modest contributions, but if I were to put down my sword, who would deal with the monsters?”</p>
<p>The emperor chuckled lightly as if he were making a jest.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that what Frederick is for?”</p>
<p>It was a playful tone, and Lucius bowed his head as if he hadn’t understood the underlying meaning.</p>
<p>“But isn’t the prince a man of Galaba? He is just a stranger.”</p>
<p>“We are all just strangers. “Sometimes, a pact made with someone who seems like a stranger to you is more certain than anything else.”</p>
<p>“A pact?”</p>
<p>When he asked again, pretending to be innocent, the emperor frowned as if he was bored.</p>
<p>“Cut the act. Everyone knows the monsters infiltrated my empire because of the prince’s sword. They even attacked other nations to get at my country. It took a lot of effort to cover it up. But the prince acted arrogantly without knowing any of it.”</p>
<p>The emperor, appearing uncomfortable, paused as if the harsh tobacco was giving him a headache. After a moment, he continued. While he talked, Lucius watched the cigar between the large gems on the emperor’s ring.</p>
<p>“But the prince hasn’t committed any wrongs. He proposed a pact first. He said that if you give him one thing, he’ll promise never to use Panimer’s sword against the Empire. It’s a covenant made with the clergy’s approval. If he breaks it, they’ll kill him, and I wouldn’t mind. What can’t you give? He is not asking for anything significant.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Give up the lady, Lucius.”</p>
<p>Those simple words made Lucius grip the edge of his chair.</p>
<p>He had been imagining that moment ever since he came here, or rather, he had been imagining this moment since he knew Frederick was alive. However, hearing it in person was several times more devastating than imagining it in his head.</p>
<p>It felt unreal. He had been busy investigating the emperor’s secrets, and he didn’t expect this conversation would arrive too soon.</p>
<p>What made those words particularly horrifying was that the emperor referred to Deatrice as the lady, not his wife. It was as if their marriage never existed, as if what they had done was not a marriage but just a fleeting love that vanished in an instant.</p>
<p>Lucius forced himself to relax his stiffened grip, and he replied sincerely.</p>
<p>“Deatrice is my wife. We love each other, and nothing can break our marriage. Didn’t you say so yourself? No matter what happens, I intend to continue our marriage.”</p>
<p>“But that marriage was ultimately ordered by me, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>The emperor said as if unable to understand.</p>
<p>“I’m not telling you to rebel against a simple order I’ve given. It’s not a story about unnecessary rebellion. If you signed an agreement with the lady and her father, it will be obvious that the marriage is null from the beginning. Didn’t you know that such marriages don’t hold in the Holy Land, Lucius?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Just annul it and get married again.”</p>
<p>“Lucius…”</p>
<p>The emperor called his name in a tone of regret when Lucius remained unresponsive.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand you. What is the reason for being so stubborn? Didn’t you hate Deatrice from the beginning? As hatred turns into love, love may cool down again. It won’t take that long. Besides, there are a lot of women. And if that’s not the case and you’re taking this stance to increase the value of the reward I’m giving you, then I’d say that’s a pretty foolish decision. The more you act like this, the more disappointed I become.”</p>
<p>“Respected Majesty,”</p>
<p>Lucius opened his mouth, digging into the emperor’s words.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty says that love changes easily, but doesn’t the emperor also have unchanging love?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>The emperor’s eyes narrowed, scrutinizing Lucius as he bowed his head even more.</p>
<p>“It’s your affection for princess Effi, isn’t it? You haven’t changed a bit since her death. You’ve left everything untouched in her room.”</p>
<p>Suddenly mentioning princess Effi seemed to make the emperor uncomfortable, and he responded, though not with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“It’s family affection towards Effi. Can you compare that to affection for a woman?”</p>
<p>“I dare not doubt that sentiment. However, I happened to come across something that could tarnish princess Effi’s honor.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
