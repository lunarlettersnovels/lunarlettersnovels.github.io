            <p><strong>Chapter 18</strong></p>
<p>After having been revealed to be an illegitimate child, Lucius did not step out of the house and Deatrice didn’t contact him either.</p>
<p>Looking back, she realized it was cowardly of her to do that.</p>
<p>It should’ve been just right for her to say hello or even drop a greeting card at the very least, but she didn’t. At that time, she was too self-absorbed to even care about other people’s feelings—too distracted by Lucius’ betrayal and how it made her suffer.</p>
<p><em>How could he have fooled me like that? After all this time, why did he not say anything about his origins?</em></p>
<p>The Deatrice who had cared too much about her reputation and social life would usually think those words to herself.</p>
<p>There were times she’d wondered how Lucius fared, but rumors of him were enough to let her know. After all, people talk about his trial every day and their speculations about his uncertain future, so it was easy to catch wind of his current situation.</p>
<p>After the trial was over, some say that he would leave for Hasto with his birth mother, others say that he would become a naval officer, but one thing they all had in common was that they all agreed that his relationship with Miss Louisen had truly ended.</p>
<p>Given his current standing, how could he dare to go and find her? Deatrice was disappointed with all that she’d heard. She also didn’t expect Lucius to come to her.</p>
<p>But he did.</p>
<p>On one early morning, he threw away all of his pride and came to her. <em>During the day she had gone to the temple to pray.</em></p>
<p>As per usual, the prayer room was like an ice field. But Lucius didn’t mind as he calmly kneeled on the platform underneath the light of dawn.</p>
<p><em>Waiting…</em></p>
<p>In a span of a few days, he had suffered from severe facial injuries. It was alright if she didn’t see him because she felt like her resentment towards him was justified. But now that she had seen him in this state—affection, mixed with pity and sympathy, washed over her like erratic waves.</p>
<p>Deatrice had only quietly glanced at his side profile.</p>
<p>Lucius closed his eyes without moving another muscle, and then suddenly opened his mouth. “Why did you not come and find me?”</p>
<p>His pained and nonplussed voice echoed.</p>
<p><em>A voice that found it hard to comprehend Deatrice’s silence.</em></p>
<p>She looked away, “I thought you wanted to be alone.”</p>
<p>“I needed you.” he replied.</p>
<p>Lucius’ face was serious, but he could not mask the wounded expression on his face, nor could he hide the slight tremor in his voice.</p>
<p>He got up from his seat and walked towards her. But when he made that sudden movement, she unconsciously took a step backwards.</p>
<p>As she retreated, he halted his steps as a look of hurt crossed his features.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p><em>Why are you avoiding me?</em></p>
<p>Deatrice became agitated because she didn’t do that on purpose either. “I don’t know. I just—”</p>
<p>“Are you <em>that </em>repulsed by me?”</p>
<p>“You know it’s not like that.” she hurriedly explained herself. “I’m just flustered that I met you here—”</p>
<p>“Deatrice.” He called out in a low voice.</p>
<p>Deatrice thought he would be offended by how selfish she had been, but instead, he said something she did not expect.</p>
<p>“Run away with me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He softened his tone.</p>
<p>“I already have a small mansion that I inherited. It won’t be taken away even if I lose in court. Once I sell this property and we manage to flee to another country, you would be able to live in my care without lacking anything. So, please—”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Lucius…” she called his name in a tired voice, as if she didn’t hear him suggesting that they run away together. “Are you truly going to lose in court? Is that why you’re doing this?”</p>
<p>Lucius glanced down, his complexion turning slightly pale at the word ‘trial’.</p>
<p>“…the evidence on Bella Anise’s side is particularly convincing. If things keep going like this, I might be removed from the household as punishment.” The crestfallen tone of his voice made it seem as if he had lost everything.</p>
<p>Deatrice stared at his pathetic figure without a word. She had heard the rumors, so she knew the odds of him winning the trial were slim.</p>
<p>Because he was fighting against the law.</p>
<p>Illegitimate children were frowned upon and were sentenced by the court to exile or placed in the military forces. Judging by these predicaments, it comes as no surprise that they would have no right to inherit any properties of their unwedded parents.</p>
<p>But even if that was the case, deep down, Deatrice wished he would have some kind of fortuitous encounter that would help him escape this tricky situation.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>The attitude he was showing right now, wanting to run away and almost to the point of crying, from the probability of losing made him appear like a failure and a big joke. Lucius offering to elope was supposed to show the grand gesture of his love for her, but it had only managed to portray his weakness.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>It is said that to have true love is to accept even the ugliest parts of your lover, but Deatrice, who has always only seen the reliable and handsome figure of Lucius, could not stand his current lowly appearance.</p>
<p>Lucius’ gaze sharpened at the question, clearly disturbed. “Do you really think I really fooled you?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that.” she shook her head. “What I meant was, why didn’t you tell me you lived in another house until you were six?”</p>
