            <p><strong>Chapter 91</strong></p>
<p>“Should we kiss, Deatrice?” He said, oblivious to the turmoil his words incited within Deatrice.</p>
<p>Looking into his eyes, she saw him staring back at her as if his eyes were caressing her soul. “Does that mean you’ll sleep with me?”</p>
<p>Lucius lowered his head, cupped the back of Deatrice’s head with his large hand, and whispered with an alluring tone. “Yes.”</p>
<p>Then his lips descended upon hers, and all of his tenacious deliberation about their annulment came to a screeching halt when he felt the suppleness of her skin.</p>
<p>The timing between his answer and the kiss felt so natural that Deatrice was deeply enthralled and unconsciously wrapped her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>Their kiss was the epitome of soft and gentle.</p>
<p>His wet tongue pried her lips open and gave a tentative lick to her tongue, a string of saliva in between as he parted for a moment. Then he quickly dove back, their kisses soothing yet slowly increasing in intensity. They explored each other’s mouths, feeling those hot breaths against their own.</p>
<p>Deatrice was gradually being pushed by Lucius to the brink as he rested some of his weight against her, enough for her to feel the contours of his muscles and for him to feel her twin peaks against his chest. Excitement flashed in their eyes as they gasped for breath.</p>
<p>There was this tremor in Deatrice’s heart as she felt his tender touch after all those years.</p>
<p>He had kissed her often in the past, but it was vastly different from today. Before, it was restrained and patient like he wanted to tell her something more but couldn’t…</p>
<p>Lucius gently laid her head on a pillow, stroking her hair with the back of his fingers, and put his other hand on her exposed thigh. Deatrice jolted slightly and gasped at the tingling feeling. With her abrupt motion, her loose straps slid all the way down, revealing her voluptuous breasts and the slender curve of her shoulders.</p>
<p>Lucius’ eyes immediately stared at the pink peaks that came into view.</p>
<p>Deatrice felt utterly embarrassed and the desire to cover his eyes grew stronger by the minute.</p>
<p>But she wondered if he knew how he made her feel. Did he know that his desire was so contagious that it affected her too? Or did this only mean she had coveted him from the very beginning and her own arousal stemmed from suppressing her desires?</p>
<p>Lucius’ lips glistened and became noticeably redder. He uttered, “Did you hate it—<em>no</em>. Do you hate it?”</p>
<p>“If I do?”</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed, “Don’t play with me.”</p>
<p>Deatrice had the urge to caress his frowning face. She maneuvered his hand around her thigh without hiding her intentions of being a little more mischievous.</p>
<p>He took hold of her wrist as he stepped back from her, trying to keep himself from positioning his body in between her legs.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>She heard him ask, and Deatrice responded in a light manner.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop.”</p>
<p>As if he had been stabbed by an awl, Lucius paused, and then a chuckle came out of his throat. His handsome face immediately showed faux signs of distress and confusion, “Am I doing too badly then?”</p>
<p>Deatrice held back her laughter and looked back at him with a sullen and disappointed gaze.</p>
<p>But of course, Lucius knew he was a good kisser, and he couldn’t help but laugh out loud this time. When he saw her smiling too, he buried his face into her collarbones and exhaled, his warm breath causing shivers to erupt all over her neck.</p>
<p>He spoke in a low voice. “Sleep with me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Are you surprised?”</p>
<p>“No,” she whispered back, “I knew about your filthy desires long before.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think you wouldn’t realize it either. We were simply pulling wool over the other’s eyes rather unsuccessfully.”</p>
<p>Deatrice felt strange.</p>
<p>The feeling of him clinging to her arms and simply being docile gave her conflicting emotions since he had just hurled abusive words at her not too long ago.</p>
<p>Her voice came out colder than she intended, “You told me before that even if I begged—”</p>
<p>“Let’s not think too deeply about things right now.” He cut off her words and Deatrice simply mumbled a sound of approval.</p>
<p>Moonlight set the night aglow, revealing the messy bed sheets beneath their bodies. As Deatrice remained silent, Lucius pressed his nose against her neck and inhaled her sweet scent.</p>
<p>The next moment, Deatrice felt something wet and warm make contact with her skin. She clenched her thighs in response.</p>
<p>Lucius peppered her neck with small kisses and savored her taste with his tongue from her collarbone to that sensitive spot behind her ear. At certain times, he would playfully nip at them.</p>
<p>When he grabbed her waist, his fingers unintentionally dug into her skin and Deatrice yelped at the sudden pain.</p>
<p>“It hurts.”</p>
<p>Lucius eased the pressure on his fingers, but his wandering tongue did not stop in the slightest. With him lowering himself on her, Deatrice could see his shirt clinging to his back muscles and was mesmerized by the sheer masculinity of it.</p>
<p>She clutched the fabric and lightly tugged it as if telling him to remove it.</p>
<p>Sensing her intentions, Lucius stared intensely at her, and then obediently took off his shirt. Him on his knees and her trapped between his thighs, he looked so domineering that all she wanted to do was to surrender.</p>
<p>He gazed down at her naked upper body and then at her eyes, a thinly veiled question in his eyes.</p>
<p><em>Are you sure?</em></p>
<p>Deatrice thought for a moment.</p>
<p><em>Was she really alright with giving in to her desires?</em></p>
