            <p><strong>Chapter 123</strong></p>
<p>When he did not come out from behind the half-open curtain, the servant followed in a slightly restless voice.</p>
<p>“M’lord?”</p>
<p>Lucius barely picked himself up when he went back to his room. “Right, where’s Deatrice?”</p>
<p>“The madam said she is getting ready. She might be finished with her preparations anytime now.”</p>
<p>Lucius nodded his head lightly, immediately opening the door to meet with the guest.</p>
<p>The servant’s eyes could see that the master’s hair was disheveled, but soon he thoughtfully considered that it would be better for the lady to tidy him up. Couples usually resolve misunderstandings when their bodies touch each other, after all.</p>
<p>Lucius went up two steps at a time and quickly arrived at Deatrice’s roo—no, <em>their </em>room. There, he saw Deatrice putting on a light-colored necklace and Lucius leaned against the door as he watched her clasp it behind her nape.</p>
<p>At first, he didn’t think much of it, but when he took a closer look, he realized that the things she wore—the clothes and accessories—were things she already owned before they got married. The allowance he had given her should’ve been a substantial amount, so why wear old goods?</p>
<p>Come to think of it, he hadn’t seen merchants deliver feminine products since they got married. The things that arrived were almost always new furnishings or decorations for the manor. Lucius couldn’t understand why Deatrice was acting like she had no money like that, so he furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>Of course, all the things she had when she was still unmarried were naturally priceless items. But he, too, is now in a position where he can give her things like that as well.</p>
<p>But she didn’t use money from him at all, except for when she bought a pony from that knight.</p>
<p>Again, his thoughts came back to that damn horse.</p>
<p>Lucius swallowed the annoyance back into his throat. Leaning against the doorway, he reached out to Deatrice as she walked towards him.</p>
<p>She was accustomed to putting her hand over his arm, but when she suddenly noticed his messy hair, she reached out. The moment when the couple was about to make contact, Lucius avoided her touch.</p>
<p>With her hand dangling in the air, she said, “…ah. Your hair is a bit messy.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it myself.” He ruffled his hair a few times impatiently with those words. It looked better than before, but the nobles who went to the temple usually paid more attention to their appearance, opting to look more formal. However, Deatrice didn’t comment on that.</p>
<p>Because when she placed her hand on his arm, she realized he was nervous. And that he wasn’t feeling well.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Count Wilton was already waiting downstairs.</p>
<p>The reason they departed for the temple today is simple. First, Wilton said that he wanted to inspect the monster that appeared last time, and the second was that Lucius asked to go together with him.</p>
<p>However, Lucius seemed quite uncomfortable on the way there. Perhaps Wilton had noticed this, so he advised him to ride a horse to improve his mood.</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t deny that he was in a bad mood. He thanked him for his consideration and got on the horse prepared for him afterward.</p>
<p>As soon as Wilton got into the carriage, he said a brief prayer and closed his eyes. In the silence, Deatrice thought about Lucius. She thought that maybe the reason Lucius was in a bad mood was due to the lone fact they were going to a temple.</p>
<p>The exact same temple where she abandoned him and the place where he proposed to her.</p>
<p>Deatrice recollected the short conversation they had had.</p>
<p><em>“I don’t think you said anything. The more people do that, the more they reveal their lies.”</em></p>
<p>At the time, she really didn’t know it was going to be like this.</p>
<p><em>“I’ve had no one in my heart but her for the longest time.”</em></p>
<p>He, who was so cold to her, had managed to utter those words. She repeated it again in her head. Maybe this was the chance Lucius had given her. If she asked him if he also held similar feelings for him, or, perhaps, clarified the meaning behind his supposed confession.</p>
<p>Deatrice sighed internally. She couldn’t imagine that all of the problems that threatened her would be romantically resolved.</p>
<p>“Deatrice.”</p>
<p>Wilton woke her from her thoughts.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Because Wilton called her like a daughter, she answered in kind. But with Wilton’s subsequent words, Deatrice regretted it.</p>
<p>“I was told that the duke’s letter was not answered at all.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I know you have a special affection for your mother, but I’m sure you already know that she accepted your engagement with the prince to prevent your father from remarrying. Since your marriage with Sir Elliot, whom he had a problem with, had already tarnished his reputation, then rumors will spread even more if it was known that he had an affair with a noblewoman. Which is crucial if your husband is eyeing his position. Of course, this treatment may feel like abandoning you, but—”</p>
<p>“Is my father’s marriage decided?”</p>
<p>Deatrice interrupted the count from talking and asked, unable to listen to his nonsense any longer. Then, as if her prediction was correct, she could see the change in Wilton’s complexion.</p>
<p>“You’re still as quick-witted as you used to be.”</p>
<p>It was just a guess, but Deatrice was momentarily surprised by her father’s decisiveness. “Of course, I will attend the wedding if that’s what you’re worried about. Tell him he doesn’t have to persuade me.”</p>
<p>“Hm. Don’t be too disappointed.”</p>
<p>Deatrice smiled slightly, “I already know that.”</p>
