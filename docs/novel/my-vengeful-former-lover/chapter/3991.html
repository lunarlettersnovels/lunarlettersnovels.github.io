            <p><strong>Chapter 52</strong></p>
<p>Lucius managed to come back only when their meal was almost over.</p>
<p>He strode inside unhesitatingly. When Lucius saw his sister and Berry Spurt sitting at the table, he calmly greeted them without showing any signs of surprise and apologized for being a little late.</p>
<p>He spoke. “Long time no see, Miss Spurt. Have you been well?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. And you…” her voice trailed off. “Ah, right, you’ve definitely been well these past few days.” Berry Spurt spoke with a hint of embarrassment, always forgetting that the person in front of her was now a married man.</p>
<p>Lucius smiled softly, then turned his head to look at his sister. “Dixie, how did you become acquainted with Miss Spurt? And what about Roy?”</p>
<p>She giggled. “Haven’t I already told you in the letter I sent? Miss Spurt and I became friends a few months ago.”</p>
<p>“Really? And you chose to deepen your friendship with her in your brother’s house?” he replied with a questioning brow.</p>
<p>Dixie laughed at his teasing remark. “Why? Are you sad that we’re interrupting your honeymoon?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I’m more than happy to see you here.” He didn’t exactly mean it, but when his handsome face smiled, it appeared to them like he was expressing his feelings sincerely.</p>
<p>Deatrice took a sip of her wine, looking intently at her sister-in-law’s face.</p>
<p>Catching her gaze, Dixie uttered all of a sudden. “Give me some time tomorrow.”</p>
<p>When Lucius looked at her with an inquisitive gaze, she added, switching her gaze from Deatrice to Miss Spurt, “The two of us are going out together tomorrow. Since we’re guests, shouldn’t it make sense for the owner to come with us?”</p>
<p>Lucius sat on a vacant seat and leaned against its back, “Where do you plan on going?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure yet.” she gave a pondering look. Then she glanced at him, “Why don’t you be our guide? I heard that you and your wife have already toured the area.”</p>
<p>Lucius suddenly raised his gaze and looked at his wife.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until she met with his red eyes that Deatrice realized that this was the first time he had looked at her this whole evening.</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, then said in a low voice. “Alright. It’s summer, so it’d be nice to go boating by the lakes and exploring the forests nearby.”</p>
<p>“Great! Then let’s do that.”</p>
<p>“That sounds nice!” Dixie and Miss Spurt answered in chorus.</p>
<p>When Deatrice didn’t say anything, Dixie Bell glanced at her with her eyebrows raised. Looking to ask if she was really alright with this arrangement.</p>
<p>Deatrice smiled, nodded her head, and delicately took another sip of her wine.</p>
<p>Even if all of these were not to her liking, she had no choice but to follow.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they had brief conversations about paintings, famous novels, and the overall situation about society. Moving to the guest room, they played a popular card game and spent the rest of the evening playing the piano. Berry Spurt had a good voice and sang quite beautifully, even Deatrice herself sang for a few minutes.</p>
<p>When Dixie felt sleepy, she stood up and told them she would retire to her room. Since her friend was about to leave, Spurt had to leave as well. Soon, there were only two people left in the drawing room.</p>
<p>Lucius and Deatrice.</p>
<p>An awkward atmosphere covered them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because of her actions, but because Lucius stood ramrod straight and kept avoiding her gaze.</p>
<p>The candle flickered, illuminating his impeccable blonde hair.</p>
<p>Lucius shook his head out of the blue. He opened his mouth, then hesitated, until he ultimately said, “Were you surprised because of Dixie?”</p>
<p>“Hm. Not because of Dixie.”</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p><em>You know who.</em></p>
<p>Deatrice thought to herself as she tilted her head and looked at Lucius, who had his eyebrow quirked up slightly as he looked back at her.</p>
<p>Feeling incredulous, he asked. “Don’t tell me… Is it because of Spurt?”</p>
<p>“I know what happened between you and her.”</p>
<p>“We only ever talked about work. I have nothing in common with her.” He answered in a flustered and bewildered tone. But like a man who was unfairly accused, Lucius uttered in defense. “And even if something really happened between us, what is it to you?”</p>
<p>Deatrice had some rebuttal to that.</p>
<p>She could pour out replies like how ridiculous it would be if rumors spread that he cheated on her with Spurt. A ‘loving husband’ like him would look like a clown.</p>
<p>But even if they had an argument like this, she was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p><em>But wait a minute.</em></p>
<p>What if… he confessed that he desired her? She couldn’t imagine what would happen after <em>that </em>admission.</p>
<p>Deatrice persevered and calmly addressed the matter.</p>
<p>“Even if your relationship with Berry Spurt isn’t a big deal to you, the presence of those rumors meant that people are paying attention to her. What’s more, Dixie brought her here. Do you have any idea what that implies?”</p>
<p>He shrugged, “Maybe she just wanted to annoy you.” Then he turned his head away.</p>
<p>Deatrice abruptly got up from the piano stool, walked over to him, and grabbed his wrist. Lucius looked down in astonishment.</p>
<p>She whispered as she bored into his widened eyes. “Be honest, Lucius, did you tell Dixie about my condition and the truth behind this marriage?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Dixie seems to know something. Are sure that—” she pulled his wrist down.</p>
<p>His hand suddenly came closer to her waist, and Lucius had to clench his fist to avoid the impulse of involuntarily grabbing her. His jaw tightened, thinking that the color of her eyes looking down at him was darker than usual.</p>
<p>One end of Deatrice’s lips rose up.</p>
<p>“—you did not tell Dixie to annoy me?” She mimicked his words.</p>
<p>Lucius looked up at Deatrice with force in his chin and pushed her away.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t.”</p>
<p>She brushed off her wrinkled clothes as she had been pushed aside and said in an indifferent voice. “If that’s the case, then sleep with me tonight.”</p>
