            <p><strong>Chapter 111</strong></p>
<p>“Where is the letter?”</p>
<p>Raising her head, Rosalynn placed the letter in front of her. “It was sent from the Temple of DeVille, m’lady.”</p>
<p>“DeVille?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It seems to be the answer you asked me to find.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>With a brief exclamation, Deatrice picked up the letter.</p>
<p>At the time she wrote this anonymous letter to the temple of Alhen with her story, she was having a conundrum while looking for a place to stay after the incoming annulment.</p>
<p>She introduced herself as a lady of the Empire who had a bit of divinity and had suffered a lot of guilt for hiding her powers until now.  She promised that after the affairs of the Empire were sorted out, she wanted to entrust her well-being to the temple and live as a priestess.</p>
<p>The temple’s reply to her message was in the letter before her.</p>
<p>Deatrice hesitated a little, then opened it.</p>
<p>To summarize the contents, they say they welcome the return of souls the gods have lost with open arms at any time, saying how glad they were that she had the courage to take this step. They finished it by expressing their gratitude for the generous donation she offered, saying that she must’ve suffered greatly while hiding her divine powers.</p>
<p>Deatrice looked at the letter for the longest time, chin in hand, then she hid it deep inside her desk drawer.</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t return.</p>
<p>Well, he was kicked out so he couldn’t really come back a second time and embarrass himself again.</p>
<p>But even if she didn’t ask for any news about Lucius, she would eventually hear about him. Because everyone, from the maid delivering her breakfast to the maid arranging her accessories, would give her updates unsolicited.</p>
<p>Hence, Deatrice knew that he didn’t go out yesterday and chose to read a book in the library instead. Then he spent the night at the pool table drinking brandy and playing billiards with Raymond.</p>
<p>Another maid noticed Lucius must have been waiting for Deatrice in his study yesterday and said, “Whenever he heard someone coming and going, he would look up and check to see who it was. I remember him looking slightly disappointed when he saw me instead and lowered his head again. I told him you were in your room, and he just said he knew. The Marquis stayed in the study for a while, then left after Lord Bell came and asked to play billiards with him.”</p>
<p>The explanation was too long, so Deatrice simply nodded her head half-heartedly.</p>
<p>Seeing the maid constantly checking Deatrice’s face while fixing her clothes, it seems like their situation last night was a big deal to her.</p>
<p>The servants of Northum didn’t even care about them using different rooms the whole time. Looking at the servants here, who weren’t very used to it, Deatrice realized how harmonious the relationship is between Raymond and Dixie. They probably stayed in the same room all the time and didn’t sleep a single day apart when they were at home.</p>
<p>She also found that these days, the younger the couple, the more they should sleep in the same bed as a rule.</p>
<p>Deatrice imagined how surprised this maid would be if she suddenly announced that she and Lucius mostly used different rooms. Perhaps she’ll be at a loss on what to do.</p>
<p>While her mind was elsewhere, Deatrice put the lavender water in her mouth and spit it out.</p>
<p>Light salads and sandwiches were on the luncheon menu, and eggs and bacon were the heaviest foods on the table. She thought to herself that there was no place for Philip at this luncheon.</p>
<p>After sipping brandy and playing billiards until late at night, she was expecting a slightly haggard appearance, but Lucius showed up in the dining room without a trace of tiredness in his brows, as if he had assimilated into the homely atmosphere of Bellute’s mansion.</p>
<p>After going through yesterday’s events, Dixie avoided meeting her in many ways thinking that Deatrice would be uncomfortable, thankfully it didn’t ruin the atmosphere of the luncheon. It was Lucius and Raymond who mainly led the conversation, and the relaxed atmosphere emanating from their mischievous conversation soon made even tensed Dixie to loosen up.</p>
<p>“Lady Elliot, did you know?” Raymond said with a playful smile to Deatrice. “Lucius was pretty crazy when he was at the academy and often missed classes. If he felt bored, he would sit crookedly at the back of the class and cut down a tree that came out of nowhere.”</p>
<p>“A tree?”</p>
<p>She had to pretend she didn’t know, but this is the kind of story she’d heard tiredly when she was with him six years ago. Lucius’ mistakes and negligence that they heard at every dinner party seemed so fun at the time, but now it was grating to her ears.</p>
