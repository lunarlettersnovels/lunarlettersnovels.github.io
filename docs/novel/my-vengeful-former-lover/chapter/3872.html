            <p><strong>Chapter 171</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, Prince Frederick Ballencar must be treading the same path that Lucius took a year ago.</p>
<p>The paved road of pure white Lethana stretches from the main gate to the large doors of the palace. At the end of this path, he would make a brief oath of allegiance to the statue of Dias, receive solemn greetings from the knights, and enter the door connected to this hall.</p>
<p>The huge marble door, which could accommodate three to four horses side by side, gave a strange sense of expectation and intimidation as it loomed over his figure.</p>
<p>After a brief moment of emotion, the man straightened his back and, with the loud cry of the courtier, the door smoothly opened.</p>
<p>“Prince of Galaba, Frederick Ballencar has arrived!”</p>
<p>As the door opened, the orange illumination pouring through the gap in the door was the first thing that greeted him as the unique fragrance of the banquet hall overwhelmed his sense of smell. The light shone on his figure, revealing his features to the guests below, and curious glances were fixated on him.</p>
<p>Murmurs started until they no longer bothered to hide, they were talking about him so openly.</p>
<p>“He really came.”</p>
<p>“Is that the sword? It’s smaller than I thought…”</p>
<p>“Is that the same prince I knew? It looks like he’s changed a lot.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. His face seems completely different.”</p>
<p>“I feel like he has become more serious.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s understandable. It would be difficult not to change after going through such hardships.”</p>
<p>“In my eyes, he looks more admirable.”</p>
<p>The prince’s figure overlapped with one of Lucius’ memories. He still remembered the gaze and faces of the nobles that stared down at him as if he were prey at that time. However, he knew nothing about how Deatrice looked at him that time because he purposely did not look in her direction.</p>
<p>He had a general idea of where she was, but other than knowing she was standing next to a rather large man, he didn’t know anything else.</p>
<p>Even when he reached where the Emperor was, he had only vaguely recognized the white lace dress she was wearing simply because it was within the scope of his peripheral vision.</p>
<p>But the expression she had, he did not know.</p>
<p>After a few days of agonizing, the man who had been troubling his head finally appeared. The difference between this time and before was that… he was paying attention to Deatrice’s reaction.</p>
<p>That was why he saw her gray pupils tremble lightly underneath her thin eyebrows, her cheeks turned pale, and the muscles of her jaws looked very tense.</p>
<p><em>…why?</em></p>
<p>Lucius thought to himself.</p>
<p>Why was she so unsettled? What’s the big deal about that guy?</p>
<p>Even if Lucius had no ill feelings towards the prince, he was convinced that this man was utterly boring because there’s nothing else noteworthy about him other than his status.</p>
<p>His large stature, slightly tanned skin, and refined features may be tolerable to the eyes; but his attitude of trying to appear numb to the attention he was receiving right now and the arrogant expression he was trying to hide behind that nonchalance… Lucius knew all too well the power of the sword he brought was ordinary, the most perfect quality resembling the person who has brought it to the palace today.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was even more puzzling. Aside from being royalty, he truly could not see any other outstanding qualities. Even if it was his father’s command, he couldn’t understand why Deatrice who was once engaged to him seemed so taken with him.</p>
<p>While he was gone, what kind of conversation did that man have with Deatrice?</p>
<p>Did he tell her about the lighters he had collected all this time and subsequently confessed that adding her into his life would provide greater significance to his existence? However, that awkward feeling was quickly dispelled as soon as Deatrice found his hand and held it tightly.</p>
<p>His worries dispersed instantly.</p>
<p>“Lucius.”</p>
<p>As if a warm breeze had blown in, he came to his senses with her calling his name. Lucius fixed Deatrice’s small hand and leaned her against him, “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I feel dizzy,” her forehead creased a little bit. “I think I drank too much earlier.”</p>
<p>“Does it hurt somewhere else?”</p>
<p>As they whispered a few short conversations, the prince approached the Emperor and eventually kneeled in front of him.</p>
<p>“Galaba’s second prince, Frederick Ballencar, greets the sun of the empire. Apologies for my long absence.”</p>
<p>Black hair flowed down to the prince’s nose as he bowed. The Emperor pretended not to understand the young man’s carefully worded phrase ‘long absence’ even though everyone gathered there knew the reason behind it was the choice the emperor made years ago.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s been a long time,” the Emperor maintained his arrogant tone with his curt greeting. “Is that the sword?”</p>
<p>Cutting off what should have been a lengthy greeting, the Emperor pointed to the object in the prince’s hands that was wrapped in silk. Frederick gave a short smile and stood up in a dignified manner.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” He kneeled and presented the sword above with his two hands, “This is the sword of the legendary warrior, Panimer.”</p>
<p>Many of the empire’s nobles frowned, but Frederick lowered the wrapped sword and deftly untied the silk, revealing its beautiful blue gem-like appearance. Many people forgot their words and exclaimed with admiration.</p>
<p>“It’s beautiful!”</p>
<p>“It looks like it was made by weaving together the ocean waves. How breathtaking!”</p>
<p>“According to the legend, it’s made of the ore that Powell brought down.”</p>
<p>Giving the audience plenty of time to admire the sword, Frederick proudly smiled as he enjoyed the limelight and said, “I present this humble gift to His Majesty, the Emperor.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
