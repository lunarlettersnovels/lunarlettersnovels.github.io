            <p><strong>Chapter 136</strong></p>
<p>Tom Wilson quickly noticed that the atmosphere in the mansion had changed after returning. Aside from the appearance of rugs he had never seen before and the new luxurious furniture and paintings, it felt like the manor had finally come to life after having been dealt with a feminine touch.</p>
<p>The people working seemed to have become a little calmer than before and he felt like his feet were immersed in the softness of every step he took.</p>
<p>Probably because of the new carpets along the halls…</p>
<p>He thought that things felt different because he had been away for a long time or because the seasons have changed. But when he saw the sunlight coming in from the windows and illuminating the dark rooms from before as well as the subtle scent of well-maintained flowers in the air—he knew his initial assumption was wrong.</p>
<p><em>‘It seems like things have completely changed while I wasn’t around.’</em></p>
<p>Even just looking at the slightest corner that had a vase with freshly-cut flowers, he could feel that the mansion had completely fallen into Deatrice’s hands. Unless everyone obeyed her will, nothing would’ve changed to this degree.</p>
<p><em>‘Why is she working so hard when she’s going to leave soon?’</em></p>
<p>With that in mind, Tom went to his master’s study with his reports. He opened the door thinking that he would like the master to be happy after seeing the report he prepared without hesitation and the wealth he had grown so far.</p>
<p>“Hm?” For a moment, the attendant felt like he had entered the wrong room. But looking back at the door, he knew it was supposed to be here. He saw a servant pass by and asked, “The master, where is he?”</p>
<p>The servant looked at him weirdly.</p>
<p>“He… should be in the Knight’s templar at this time of the day.”</p>
<p>“No, not that.” Tom gestured towards the room, “His things… Why is this room empty?”</p>
<p>“Oh, he lives upstairs with his wife. It’s been quite a while.”</p>
<p>“They share a room now?”</p>
<p>“Yes. They are very close.” After saying that, the servant told him everything that had happened so far. Tom felt a great sense of betrayal and grabbed his head.</p>
<p>A certain realization hit him.</p>
<p><em>‘So, he sent me away for this?’</em></p>
<p>After returning from the capital, the relationship between the two of them seemed turbidly ambiguous, but Tom thought it would just dissipate. Another fact was they had an appointment in Dixie’s house and the attendant thought that those flickering interests would be utterly destroyed by the master’s sister since the latter hated Deatrice for years.</p>
<p>Besides, during the times before he left for his mission, the atmosphere between the two was very awkward. So, when Lucius told him to go somewhere, Tom didn’t think much deeper into it. He instantly agreed and vacated the mansion.</p>
<p>How did things turn this way?</p>
<p>Looking back, Tom could only think that the reason Lucius had sent him in the first place was to share a room with her without his objections.</p>
<p>Tom waited for Lucius, obsessed with the idea that he was the only remaining loyalist.</p>
<p><em>‘Don’t be swayed by emotions! How far do you think this will go? Don’t you think the Madame and the Duke are getting what they want with what you’re doing?! Master, you’re being played!’</em></p>
<p>While practicing these words, he waited for his master. Unfortunately, Lucius went straight to find his wife as soon as he returned.</p>
<p>“Where is Deatrice?”</p>
<p>The butler standing next to him replied in a familiar manner, “The madam went to the house of Baroness Montagu.”</p>
<p>“Hm… That’s quite a distance from here.”</p>
<p>“Yes, m’lord. The madam said she will return late tonight.”</p>
<p>The moment Lucius heard those words, disappointment filled his features. Tom thought that the master’s face was so easy to read.</p>
<p>Feeling someone behind him, Lucius turned around and saw Tom standing there.</p>
<p>“Ah, Tom. You’ve returned.”</p>
<p>Tom greeted him familiarly and Lucius said as he began walking towards the study, “Did you bring the necessary documents? I received a report halfway through and heard you had some difficulties along the way.”</p>
<p>“I left it in the library,” the attendant answered. “By the way…”</p>
<p><em>I heard you’ve joined rooms with Deatrice…?</em></p>
<p>The question was stuck in his throat, but he didn’t want to seem too hasty, so Tom endured it.</p>
<p>“What?” Lucius followed up after his voice trailed.</p>
<p>“There are many reports. You’ll probably have to stay in the library later than usual.”</p>
<p>“Ah, right.”</p>
<p>Lucius quickly returned to his usual demeanor. He checked the paperwork and took care of the things from his end. There wasn’t much difference from before, except the way he looked out the window like he was waiting for something made him look like a dog.</p>
<p>A dog waiting for his owner to come home.</p>
<p>Shortly after sunset, when Deatrice’s carriage could be seen, Lucius put down the papers he was looking at and went out to meet his wife.</p>
<p>“Deatrice.”</p>
<p>The gentle expression on his face, the affection they had on their faces, and the way they naturally touched each other’s bodies… Tom sensed that something very important had changed between them and he quickly realized that this change felt like an anchor fastened securely on the ocean floor.</p>
<p>Something that would never be easily shaken, be it strong winds or torrential rain.</p>
<p>Eventually, Tom decided not to say the words he was practicing earlier. In his mind, he still believed that his master was being used. And yet, he didn’t expect that witnessing something one late afternoon would shake and challenge this deeply rooted belief of his.</p>
<p>He saw Deatrice pick up Lucius’ cravat that had fallen on the sofa in the living room and kissed it as she looked at him, the slight smile on her lips revealing she understood why it was there. Tom knew as well, the master likes taking off his cravat when it starts bothering him and would throw it away somewhere in the vicinity.</p>
<p><em>And that kiss…</em></p>
<p>It was clear as the setting sun.</p>
<p>That was a kiss that carried deep affection for someone they hold dear.</p>
<p><em>[To be continued…]</em></p>
