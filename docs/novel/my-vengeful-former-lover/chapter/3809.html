            <p><strong>Chapter 234</strong></p>
<p>Throughout their rounds, Lucius regained his affectionate demeanor. There were moments when he seemed to maintain a slight distance, but Vivian attributed this to his sense of duty not to get involved with maidens due to his marriage, and she found his consideration even more admirable.</p>
<p>“This is a free soup kitchen. It’s mainly run by the temple and nearby girls’ schools. Our family provides the ingredients. But lately, it’s been tough, and the quality of the food has declined. Fortunately, thanks to the relief supplies brought in recently, it has improved a lot.”</p>
<p>“It’s operated by girls’ schools?”</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s a girls’ school operated jointly by Viscount Oskjak, Baron Morton, and the Rasme Temple. It’s a school that operates abundantly thanks to the donations of esteemed individuals. So, the students and teachers there are enthusiastic about local volunteering, aiming to repay what they’ve received.”</p>
<p>“They come here to volunteer every weekend?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Vivian felt confused if she had mentioned specific timing like weekends, but soon she nodded. Lucius, who had been glancing around with a thoughtful gaze, suddenly seemed to recall something and smiled down at Vivian.</p>
<p>“Then Miss Yeongae will also come to volunteer with me on weekends.”</p>
<p>Instantly captivated by his smile, Vivian nodded her head without even hearing what Lucius was saying.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Really, it can’t be easy for a young lady of nobility to do something like this.”</p>
<p>“We’re together, what’s so hard about that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed. Well then. It seems more meaningful to be with other volunteers and deliver food to the needy.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>While it naturally added that she would be volunteering with the girls from the school, Vivian didn’t seem to notice. She was too absorbed in the thought of Lucius being a compassionate man who cared deeply for the less fortunate, neglecting to pay attention to other details.</p>
<p>“Then, see you then. I have to go back to the restoration site.”</p>
<p>With a smooth smile, Lucius bid farewell, and Vivian, though slightly taken aback by the earlier departure than expected, soon made a neat farewell that didn’t violate etiquette.</p>
<p>Before finally turning away, Lucius gave a slight smile, as if reminding her of their agreement. For a girl newly smitten with love, that brief smile alone was enough to get her through the week.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“So, it’s been decided that this weekend, Miss Vivian Boviki, And Sir Lucius Elliot will be volunteering together. They expressed their appreciation for our efforts and expressed their desire to emulate the spirit of serving the community.”</p>
<p>Principal Anita conveyed these words with her characteristic kind smile, scanning the teachers. Though everyone slightly nodded and tried to maintain composure, there was an unseen energy among them, indicating their excitement.</p>
<p>Anita warned against getting too excited in such a manner with a stern voice, but in reality, even Anita herself was somewhat reminded of the fact that they would be accompanying nobles, so her warning didn’t seem very meaningful.</p>
<p>“Make sure everyone takes care of themselves and avoids any behavior that may be deemed disrespectful or improper. Understood?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mrs. Anita.”</p>
<p>After respectfully bidding farewell, the teachers soon turned back to the children at Anita’s permission. It was only after people dispersed a bit that Anita noticed Deatrice standing quietly with a pale face.</p>
<p>“Miss Fram, are you alright?”</p>
<p>At the consecutive call, Deatrice finally looked up. Anita approached with a concerned expression, reaching out to hold her arm.</p>
<p>Miss Fram, the woman with striking gray eyes, came to stay at the school one day when Sister Sophie Willaden brought her. From the first glance, the woman exuded an impression of having fled from somewhere, often staring blankly into space without even recognizing her own name.</p>
<p>Anita was more displeased with teachers who hesitated and acted slowly than anyone else, but she found it hard to dislike the woman before her. It wasn’t just because she was a rare beauty, but also because of her impeccable manners, well-groomed speech, and an aura of refinement that emanated from her every move.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was a noble lady who had fled from the empire for some reason, a thought shared not only by Anita but by everyone who saw Deatrice at the school.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Miss Fram?”</p>
<p>There was a crack in her facade, as if she didn’t know what expression to wear. Deatrice hesitated for a moment, as if unsure whether to smile or frown, before bowing her head slightly, giving a greeting, and leaving.</p>
<p>Anita stared at the door through which Deatrice had exited for a long time, feeling like she had just witnessed the expression of someone on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>She wanted to say she couldn’t help it, but the truth was she could have. She had plenty of opportunities to escape. She could have touched her forehead as if in pain, wandered the corridors, or told Principal Anita she couldn’t participate in the weekend volunteering due to some excuse.</p>
<p>But Deatrice didn’t do that. More accurately, she didn’t want to. Since the last time she saw him fleetingly, Lucius’s face had occupied her mind. Even when she tried to forget, his image lingered like dust floating in sunlight, impossible to erase.</p>
<p>“Are you insane?”</p>
<p>Deatrice couldn’t stop thinking about the way his hand clenched tightly around hers to keep the energy from leaking out, and the way he looked at her.</p>
<p>In fact, Sophie had come late last night.</p>
<p>Sophie briefly greeted others and immediately sought out Deatrice. With a face full of worry, Sophie asked to speak with her alone. It seemed as though Sophie had already heard the news that Lucius would be volunteering over the weekend.</p>
