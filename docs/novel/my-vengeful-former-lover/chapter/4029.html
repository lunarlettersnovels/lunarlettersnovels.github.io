            <p><strong>Chapter 14</strong></p>
<p>At a different location, Deatrice was fighting a one-woman battle.</p>
<p>It was because all her relatives, who were none the wiser that this marriage was dictated by the emperor, had come knocking on her door at least once and preached about how selfish she was.</p>
<p><em>“Can’t you see how important this time is to your father? Your marriage is the last chance to turn this crisis around! Why are you playing love games with that illegitimate child?!”</em></p>
<p><em>“So selfish!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Deatrice must have gone mad!”</em></p>
<p>Failing to convince her, the grown-ups in the house caused a commotion outside. They were hoping for sympathy, but other people believed that the love between Deatrice and Lucius was genuine.</p>
<p>Which only angered the noisy relatives to the point of fainting.</p>
<p>However, hearing similar words for the past few days from people who were only clinging onto the duke for his wealth and status, Deatrice felt very insulted. Moreover, ‘throwing the bait’—the term Lucius used to refer to their meetings to keep people talking about them—was done strictly according to his schedule.</p>
<p>After getting nagged all morning, she had an appointment with him in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Once again, the public’s attention was drawn to them even if they hid from curious gazes. Just as it had always been when they were younger,</p>
<p>Suddenly feeling choked, Deatrice leaned on Lucius’ shoulder and lifted her head.</p>
<p>“Is something the matter?” Lucius looked back at her with a genial smile and held her hand.</p>
<p>It was impossible for there to be no one keeping eyes on their person, so they had to perform this act of being in love at all times. Lucius even said that gestures like these were the most important aspects to deceive people.</p>
<p>Deatrice also agreed that these kinds of actions were the easiest to be noticed by others. Although she was a bit of a socialite before, she didn’t like being scrutinized wherever she went, and sitting in the middle of the crowd and performing such a play made her uncomfortable.</p>
<p>She voiced her thoughts.</p>
<p>“Until when are we going to do this?”</p>
<p>He smiled charismatically and tucked some stray hairs behind her ear. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>It was just a simple touch performed for the sake of keeping up appearances. Deatrice couldn’t detect a shred of affection from his finger.</p>
<p>“When are you going to propose to me?” she pressed.</p>
<p>Then he laughed.</p>
<p>This time, it was genuine laughter.</p>
<p><em>“Propose?”</em></p>
<p>But Deatrice was dead serious.</p>
<p>“I heard that the emperor told us to get married as soon as possible. But you’ve already wasted your time like this for two months.”</p>
<p>“Why the rush?” he asked slyly with one eyebrow raised. “Are you that excited to be wedded to me?”</p>
<p>Deatrice felt slightly annoyed at his behavior when he demonstrated that he didn’t care that much about her situation.</p>
<p>She furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>“I’m tired of putting up a farce for everyone to see. My relatives even come to my home to fuss over everything I do. I’d rather get married now and then quickly end this relationship as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Then,” he started, “what’s the duke doing when you’re the one suffering for his wrongdoings?”</p>
<p>Her father was directly involved in all of this, which is why he was also aware of their current arrangements because of the emperor’s orders.</p>
<p>Lucius had asked in a carefree manner, but Deatrice felt a little awkward since she felt uncomfortable hearing anything related to the duke coming from his mouth. Her father had destroyed his future, after all.</p>
<p>“My father thinks it is just right to not intervene. If he did, he said people might be suspicious.”</p>
<p>“If he doesn’t step in, given our past, wouldn’t that be more suspicious?” Lucius answered, looking elsewhere as if he was bored.</p>
<p>Deatrice wondered if he would show hostility towards the duke, but he seemed rather uninterested.</p>
<p>Looking at his naturally flowing, radiant blonde hair and a slightly stiff posture; she suddenly realized that she had no idea how Lucius had successfully returned from the war.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem like the ferocious type because of his elegant looks. Perhaps he may have been athletically-inclined six years ago and liked to compete, but it didn’t occur to her that he would have any interest in getting blood on his hands—even if it was just hunting for wild animals.</p>
<p>But now, he must’ve killed as many people as his scar suggested and Deatrice found that hard to believe.</p>
<p>Feeling her gaze on him, Lucius turned around and asked. “What are you looking at?”</p>
<p>“Jus—<em>nothing</em>.” Deatrice wanted to ask him how he got such a scar, but she didn’t want to appear concerned for him, so she simply changed her words. “By the way, I heard Belle went to you.”</p>
<p>Lucius, finding the name slightly unfamiliar, frowned.</p>
<p>“Ah, right. She did, and she was very angry.” He realized a while later that she was referring to his sister, Dixie. “You know she doesn’t like you very much.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I asked. I’m just worried something might go wrong with this marriage if anyone opposes it.”</p>
<p>Lucius laughed again.</p>
<p>To him, it was funny how she spoke as if she was too anxious to be married to him.</p>
