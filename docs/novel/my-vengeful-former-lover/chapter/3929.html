            <p><strong>Chapter 114</strong></p>
<p>He pulled his face closer and whispered breathily against her ear. “Do you want to do <em>that</em> with me?”</p>
<p>Deatrice felt his breath against her neck and glared at him. But when he pulled back, she thought he looked like utter bullshit with his handsome face posing so triumphantly. It was so ridiculous that Deatrice couldn’t even get angry.</p>
<p>She thought it would be best to just push him away, but the force holding her down prevented her from getting up. As he blocked her escape, he became a little more stealthy in his approach.</p>
<p>“It was good. That day, you and me.”</p>
<p>“You really have gone crazy. No matter how blind we are, there are people watching us in a place like this.”</p>
<p>“Who would dare watch the affairs of their lord and lady?” Lucius momentarily straightened his posture and yelled, “Nobody is allowed to come near here and disturb us.”</p>
<p>It was an order that a spoiled young master would usually give. But despite such stupid orders given in such a haughty manner, the servants steadily moved away.  Lucius raised the corners of his mouth upside down and smiled innocently.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the area to be deserted. Deatrice looked up at Lucius without resisting. When she saw his hard body and stubborn face, she realized that struggling would do nothing but provoke him further.</p>
<p>If she was silent, he would soon be relieved.</p>
<p>With that in mind, her gray eyes stared at him lowly. However, Lucius used the thick and sweet air of the last summer as a shield and calmly followed her curves and looked down. Pursuing a round forehead, a tall nose, and a beauty that he had seen for a long time, but never worn out, Lucius gradually became quieter.</p>
<p>It was easy for her to notice that he wasn’t quiet because of his indifference. She knew that he had succumbed to lust and became docile again, as he had been on their first night.</p>
<p>“Lucius.”</p>
<p>She called him out of disbelief, but Lucius closed his eyes and kissed her as if he took her words as a signal to continue.</p>
<p>Their lips clashed.</p>
<p>It was a passionate kiss against the setting summer and did not even give her a chance to breathe. The sultry air left behind by the passing wind penetrated the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>If she was honest with herself, his kiss felt good.</p>
<p>Deatrice slowly melted into the pleasure that Lucius gave her. His hand slowly stroked her thigh and climbed up her waist wearing a tight corset. Still, she felt intoxicated by his vivid touch and the way he moved before her eyes. But at the same time, hatred for him also surged.</p>
<p>Lucius’ presence felt overwhelming as he kissed the tip of her earlobe and slowly licked the delicate slope of her neck. His lips descended the collarbone and touched the soft mounds on her chest.</p>
<p>She was obsessed with the thought of wanting to do him harm by scratching him with her fingernails, but her hands were tightly grasped in his hand. Even when she used all of her strength, she barely reached the joint of his finger.</p>
<p>Deatrice twisted her body to escape, then slammed the back of her hand against a jagged stone.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>It was a painful cry.</p>
<p>Afterward, Lucius’ body slackened and Deatrice, who pushed him off her, stood up and checked the back of her hand. The wound was aching, and a little blood was oozing out. Lucius exhaled sharply when he saw her wound and took her hand.</p>
<p>She shook his hand away, but before there was any significant struggle, Lucius grabbed her hand again. This time, he added more force so she couldn’t resist.</p>
<p>His hair was all tousled because of their heated kiss. Frowning slightly, Lucius glanced at the wound, pulling out a handkerchief and wrapping it around her hand. When Deatrice saw the handkerchief, she thought it looked quite familiar.</p>
<p>White and embroidered with red roses… This was what she had given him back then when his safety on the expedition was uncertain.</p>
<p>Deatrice recognized her belongings and smiled.</p>
<p>Lucius lifted her chin to look at him. “Why?”</p>
<p>She did not answer. He still had the handkerchief she gave her, and she couldn’t say she found it funny that it reappeared at this very moment. But even if she didn’t speak, he looked at her with his serene eyes and spoke,</p>
<p>“Are you embarrassed that you got hurt by making it clear that you don’t like the situation?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It was a statement that deliberately stimulated her pride. As Deatrice glared at him coldly, Lucius smiled at her as if he never set a wall against her, then raised his body and extended his hand towards her.</p>
<p>She ignored his outstretched hand and got up by herself.</p>
<p>Lucius, whose knees were bent halfway, and his arm extended in front of him, tidied up her disheveled attire and uttered with disappointment, “Do you still have the appetite to eat?”</p>
<p>But it was laced with a somewhat cold tone.</p>
<p>Deatrice got into the carriage and followed after Lucius who had become calm again. He had his head bowed the whole time as he thought about his words and about the wall they set against each other.</p>
<p><em>“Would you like to date me?”</em></p>
<p>The words were mocking. Scathing, even.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that he was married to her, they had long since been unable to bear the sharp words hurtled by the other. It seemed absurd for them to start dating again.</p>
<p>But that night, Deatrice sat for a while, idly stroking her lips with her cold fingertips.</p>
<p>It was both a long and short journey for the two of them.</p>
