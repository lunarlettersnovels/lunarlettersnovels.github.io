            <p><strong>Chapter 65</strong></p>
<p>Tom returned to reality and hurriedly shook his head in response.</p>
<p>“No, you are correct. I am thinking about what to do for the welfare of those residents who fled from Pekka. I don’t have much experience in these kinds of things, but you do, so…”</p>
<p>His face became a bit easier to stomach as time went on. While conversing, he knew right away that the skills Deatrice had accumulated while running the duke’s house could be helpful in managing the estate and other affairs, but he refused to wholeheartedly acknowledge her capabilities.</p>
<p>He could, however, pretend to. After all, he was here to ask for help and the least he could do was fake it.</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been for the master’s order, he would have dealt with it without asking for help. Making this request from her, he felt a little cowardly.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it just yesterday that he promised he would become the number one contributor in kicking this woman out? Why was he cooperating with her now?</p>
<p>Of course, there was no change in the desire to get rid of her, but the guilt towards the woman in front of him who knew nothing about it was clearly entrenched in his heart, unlike yesterday.</p>
<p><em>There’s no other way.</em></p>
<p><em>Although a relationship has arisen and I seem to be taking petty revenge on her, I am bound to abandon this woman for the sake of my master’s plight, just as this woman had once forsaken my master for her own plight.</em></p>
<p>With that in mind, Tom calmed himself and his face gradually became colder.</p>
<p>“…so please help me in this matter. As you know, the welfare of the people who have been attacked by monsters is our top priority……”</p>
<p>“What about the budget?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Deatrice said while looking at the papers near him, “Are those related to this case?”</p>
<p>He then brought the documents to her.</p>
<p>Deatrice went over them with movements that suggested she was all too familiar with tasks like these. Although the way she looked at the documents was different, when Tom glanced at her and saw her head bowed and with a distant attitude, he thought it resembled that of his master.</p>
<p>“The budget is to be borne by Earl Miller and His Majesty the Emperor with a ratio of about seven to three from a total amount of two million shillings. The number and duration we have to accommodate is…”</p>
<p>With Tom’s voice as the background, Deatrice silently went over the papers.</p>
<p>Asking for a different document every time she looked at each document was similar to Lucius. Before long, papers began to pile up on the narrow table. Hours later, as the sun went far beyond the horizon, even Tom was tired of explaining things.</p>
<p>Deatrice had braided her hair during the time and had only drunk a couple cups of tea, but she was still focused, handing over papers and ordering Tom to do this and explain that.</p>
<p>She discussed the location of the tent, budgeting including the manpower to be mobilized, how to distribute food, and how to receive and receive relief supplies for the young residents of Pekka and decided one by one.</p>
<p>Because the budgeting was done quickly and tactfully, the rest could be decided without much difficulty. Tom felt he was dictated on everything and felt compelled to acknowledge her experience but he resisted.</p>
<p>He simply said.</p>
<p>“Then, I will deal with it according to your instructions and report back as soon as I can.”</p>
<p>Deatrice was too unfocused to actually hear what he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tom grabbed the pile of papers, putting the ones with her suggestions on top, and was about to leave when she suddenly called him.</p>
<p>“Wilson.”</p>
<p>“Yes, m’lady?”</p>
<p>“Can… Can I go there too?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Deatrice uttered with a sigh, “Everyone else is doing something—even coming back all bruised and bloodied—but I’m just here pointlessly picking up flowers and that frustrates me.”</p>
<p>He stared at her with an indiscernible look for a moment.</p>
<p>Tom had always insisted that this woman had other plans behind her back. But when he interacted with her today, even he found it hard to believe his own claims.</p>
<p>No matter how much experience she has, she shouldn’t have been able to handle the explosive work that bombarded her today and then sustain it for a long time. The way she acted seemed desperate, as if starved.</p>
<p>Tom thought that Deatrice must’ve been so frustrated when she came here and couldn’t find anything to do. From being too busy at her paternal home, to doing nothing here must’ve been disorienting for her. Then when she had been given a sliver of something to do, she grabbed onto it like her life depended on it.</p>
<p>Tom didn’t know everything about Deatrice, but he was able to infer a few things easily just by judging her today.</p>
<p>After hesitating, he finally nodded.</p>
<p>“You are the organizer behind this event. So, do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>It was a bit of an impulsive response and he didn’t even take into account what his master’s answer may be, which made him want to take his words back. But then, Tom saw Deatrice’s lips slowly curve into an arc and it felt as if he had lifted a heavy burden off her chest.</p>
<p>The words were immediately swallowed back into his throat.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lucius turned his head while holding a towel soaked in blood.</p>
<p>“Deatrice is doing <em>what?</em>” It was a tone that went from surprise to incredulity.</p>
<p>The servant who reported this to him answered with a little bewilderment upon seeing Lucius’ frown. “They have been doing this for a while now. They go out every day and directly help the refugees.”</p>
<p>The servant didn’t exactly know why he was so defensive on behalf of the lady, but he still spoke fervently.</p>
<p>“She takes note of the situation every day, and all the refugees and officials seemed to be satisfied, saying that they had become more comfortable after the madam’s arrival. Besides, she is so hardworking…”</p>
<p>Mentioning where Deatrice was today and then what she did in that place, and saying she didn’t even rest that much before doing her next task… As he continued his words, the creases on Lucius’ forehead deepened.</p>
<p>It was Lucius who said that he would attach four knights, including the vice-commander, for Deatrice, who was only in the house. But Deatrice is helping the refugees as she travels to and from Pekka’s estate, where danger may arise at any time.</p>
<p>“Is she treating me like a fool?”</p>
<p><em>Or is Deatrice being naive?</em></p>
<p>At this point, he became dubious.</p>
<p><em>Was he being concerned, or was he just thinking negatively about the consequences of her being there?</em></p>
<p>Of course, in his mind, all human beings are idiots. Doesn’t matter that he may be one as well if he generalized like that, because upon seeing that she was daring enough to ignore the dangers of that place, Deatrice just might be one—an idiot.</p>
<p>“Tsk. How can those bastards [escort knights] not even inform me about this huge matter—.” Lucius bowed his head as he muttered expletives underneath his breath.</p>
<p>No matter where he looked, his raging anger did not go away.</p>
<p>The unsuspecting knights, who didn’t know they were being cursed to hell by their commander: <em>“Achoo!”</em></p>
