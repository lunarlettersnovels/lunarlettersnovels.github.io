            <p><strong>Chapter 76</strong></p>
<p>“You dare feel sorry for me?”</p>
<p>Lucius frowned at the taut expression on her face and the frosty edge of her voice. Even at this point, she was still concerned about her image?</p>
<p>“Yes, I feel sorry for you. Because if you don’t prepare at all, your life is sure to be miserable. So—”</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth!” she yelled at him, “You feel sorry for <em>me </em>for a life that <em>you </em>will put me through?”</p>
<p>“Deatrice—”</p>
<p>“No! Don’t you dare say my name.” She warned as she took a step back. She suffered while healing his wounds and this is how he repays her?</p>
<p>She had even dreamed of growing old with him in this mansion, and while she struggled between him and her pride, Deatrice believed that everything would turn out all right in the end. That if she tried and endured, things would change.</p>
<p>Just as her Aunt Victoria told her.</p>
<p>But she never expected Lucius had already set up his mind to go against her right from the beginning.</p>
<p>With the audacity to pity her and warn her as if that could ease her mind, Deatrice felt contempt for him overflowing in waves that made her numb like no poison ever could.</p>
<p>She managed to breathe out a few words.</p>
<p>“…how did I come to like someone like you…”</p>
<p>If it had been visible, Deatrice would’ve seen the version of her who loved him so foolishly disperse ever so slowly along with the last of her words, as if the poison that had plagued her for so long had been purged from her being.</p>
<p>Her gaze hardened, then she left the room.</p>
<p>But Lucius did not move from where he was, remaining as still as ever.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Deatrice didn’t leave her room for the next two days.</p>
<p>Lucius would wander near her quarters, but that didn’t mean his face was thick enough to open the door and speak to her.</p>
<p>While she stayed in her room, a modest banquet was held to commemorate and congratulate the knights for their hard work. Count Miller also came to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>It could have been that she didn’t come out to reveal his face to the knights, but Lucius knew that Deatrice would eventually come out of the room, at least for the time being when the Count and Countess were present because she had always valued her image.</p>
<p>However, she still did not appear even after the couple arrived and specifically waited for her in her parlor.</p>
<p>Rosalynn stood by the sofa where the Count and his wife were sitting and spoke politely.</p>
<p>“My lady is not feeling well and offers her apologies for not being able to present herself in person. However, she does hope that the Count and Countess Miller had a lovely time here. Please excuse me.” she bowed respectfully and left.</p>
<p>Their expressions hardened quite a bit.</p>
<p>Lucius opened his mouth to mediate. “I was grievously injured last time and it surprised my wife so much that she had fallen ill. She still hasn’t recovered yet, but I’m sure she would’ve loved to welcome you herself.”</p>
<p>Of course, his words weren’t sincere and were simply excuses.</p>
<p>It was more of a reminder to them that he had been injured because of the troubles in the Count’s lands.</p>
<p>“Such a pity. We had long wanted to gaze upon the most famous couple of the capital, only to fall short today.” The countess, who recognized the hidden implications behind his words, skillfully hid her displeasure with an amiable smile. “By the way, I heard a priest came over two days ago. Why is she still sick now?”</p>
<p>“Because my wife doesn’t like relying on divine power.”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course. That is wise.”</p>
<p>The countess nodded repeatedly in understanding.</p>
<p>“In modern aristocratic societies, there is a tendency to abuse the power of divine power. In that regard, I admire the late duchess where, despite having such a serious illness, she rarely made use of divine powers.”</p>
<p>The countess spoke out of respect. However, when Lucius heard about the duchess, he failed to manage his expression and the countess concluded that her words were too conservative to win the sympathy of a young and not-so-noble man.</p>
<p>Perhaps the first subjects they have chosen had gone amiss, their following conversations went back and forth between ambiguous topics and shallow arguments and never actually reached any meaningful discourse.</p>
<p>It was a huge, missed opportunity for Lucius, who had hoped to impress Count Miller. But instead of paying attention to their conversation, Lucius’ thoughts were occupied by that woman who had locked herself in her room.</p>
<p><em>What is she even doing inside there? I do hope she’s not truly sick…</em></p>
<p>He began to worry about all other insignificant things.</p>
<p>Finally, the next afternoon, Lucius made up his mind to satisfy his curiosity and knocked on Deatrice’s door.</p>
<p>“Dea—”</p>
<p>His voice fell halfway. Unable to speak another word because of her one particular request.</p>
<p><em>“Don’t you dare say my name.”</em></p>
<p>Lucius closed his mouth and stared at the door, trying to relieve tension in the muscles on his nape.</p>
<p>“…it’s me. I have something to tell you.”</p>
<p><em>No answer.</em></p>
<p>If she chose not to answer all of his calls, he would have to call Rosalynn and ask her to deliver the message. Well, given the situation, he was sure that this would be the one to most likely happen.</p>
<p>Lucius had come directly to show his sincerity. To express in person that he was wrong and that he was sorry…</p>
<p><em>Stupid bastard.</em></p>
<p>Raising his head forcefully, Lucius grimaced at his delusional thoughts. As he was about to turn around and leave, he heard the door open.</p>
