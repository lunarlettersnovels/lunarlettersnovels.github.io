            <p><strong>Chapter 220</strong></p>
<p>From Elena’s perspective, she had no choice but to do that.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Deatrice left her house, a group of knights rushed in, taking Elena away and locking her in a room in some inn.</p>
<p>No matter how much she knocked on the door, there was no response, and the windows were tightly closed. After a long period of trembling in fear, she heard a natural voice saying, ‘Lady Anise, someone has come to propose negotiations.’</p>
<p>When Elena opened the door, a young man looked at her with a sullen expression. Before Elena could figure out why she was suddenly brought in, the man took the lead.</p>
<p>“Considering the unexpected situation, you must have been surprised. I am Tom Wilson, who serves as an aide to Lord Lucius Eliott. I apologize for bringing you here from the mansion in such a hurry. However, the lady had to meet the Duke immediately, and in order to prevent any harm to Lady Anise due to the Duke’s sudden anger, we had to bring her here urgently. I hope you understand.”</p>
<p>With that, Elena asked with a pale face, “Are you saying the Duke might kill me?”</p>
<p>Tom nodded arrogantly, as if asking if she didn’t know.</p>
<p>“Yes, precisely that. If you think about it for a moment, you should know. We need the your testimony, and the Duke needs your silence. Isn’t it easy to imagine that he might take your life to obtain that? So, please refrain from causing disturbances like earlier. After all, we are doing our best to save the your life.”</p>
<p>Tom spoke with a mocking attitude throughout, as if he had never learned any other way to talk, even though he looked gentle.</p>
<p>“In addition, please cooperate while we gather your testimony. If you do not testify, we plan to arrest you for impersonation. However, if you cooperate willingly, we can help you cover up all the crimes. Anyway, since you’ve already committed impersonation, there will be a trial for that, but in the end, the you won’t lose anything. I promise.”</p>
<p>How could you refuse his words that cleverly mix sticks and carrots?</p>
<p>Feeling guilty for the suffering innocent people had endured because of her, Elena wanted to apologize. In the end, she had no choice but to sign the document willingly agreeing to testify.</p>
<p>And she hasn’t heard from him in months after that. Tom, who had left Elena unattended at a remote inn, only contacted her a week ago to inform her that she had to appear in front of Lucius.</p>
<p>He came with strange conditions.</p>
<p>All of this was on the condition that Elena Anise should be the one to reveal her sin, unable to bear her guilt in her later years.</p>
<p>“Then what about Lady Deatrice?”</p>
<p>Elena, who thought everything would have been revealed long ago, was so surprised that she asked.</p>
<p>Deatrice’s own father had made her husband that way, and now they order Elena to confess her connivance to the duke herself?</p>
<p>When Deatrice was mentioned, Tom’s face darkened for the first time.</p>
<p>“The lady… has left. She said if she stayed, she would be an obstacle to the master. If the truth is revealed, revenge against the Duke is inevitable. She said it would be difficult if she remained.”</p>
<p>Tom emphasized that all of this should be kept strictly confidential from the master, especially any mention of the lady.</p>
<p>Thinking back to when she met the lady a few months ago, Elena recalled the lady knocking on the door of her mansion at midnight, looking fragile as if she couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>“So, you can vaguely guess how I feel now that I know the truth… that my father caused Lucius’ downfall. How my most beloved person’s precious time was so desperately ruined for no reason.”</p>
<p>At that time, the lady seemed to be in more pain than anyone else, sympathizing with the truth and the time lost by Lucius Elliot.</p>
<p>Elena expected the lady to confess the truth and apologize to her husband in a similar way.</p>
<p>But in the end, even such a person couldn’t endure it and fled.</p>
<p>Well, she might have left for him, but Elena quickly understood the situation. Afraid of the inevitable sense of betrayal and anger that would follow her confession, the lady left.</p>
<p>Although the details were unknown, Elena couldn’t help but feel sorry for Lucius, who looked much more pitiful in her eyes. Considering all the weight of the upcoming truths and the fact that his wife had left him, Elena sympathized with him.</p>
<p>However, unexpectedly, Lucius showed no strong reaction even after meeting his “birth mother” for the first time in six years. He treated her with a somewhat boring attitude, but still politely. Elena hesitated in front of his strange affection.</p>
<p>“I’m aware of the news during that time. It must have been really tough… Life. Even in the midst of all that, you managed to seize an opportunity and come back successfully.”</p>
<p>Lucius only gave a slight smile and didn’t offer any significant response. Elena, feeling a shiver at his oddly affectionate eyes, finally spoke.</p>
<p>“I know my visit was sudden. I’m sure you knew it would come sooner or later. I hesitated a lot about whether to come or not. But… I couldn’t live in silence anymore.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I came to confess my sins.”</p>
