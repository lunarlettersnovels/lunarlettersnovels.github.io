            <p>“Don’t think too much about it, Lucius. I talked with Angelica today and she seemed like a good person. She’s all right,” smiled Tiana.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then that’s a relief, but… more than that, I am thinking about how I still don’t know much about Rael.”</p>
<p>“Even though he is your brother, you can’t know everything about him. I am the same way with Lennox. Rael must have a reason to hide her.”</p>
<p>“Does he? He must…”</p>
<p>Tiana felt sorry for Lucius, whose face was sunken. Maybe it’s more so because they had a sad feeling of distance than normal brothers. Because they thought so much about each other that they didn’t talk about personal matters. This also might be something that Rael didn’t really want to let Lucius know. Later on, if he makes some definite progress, he might tell him.</p>
<p>Tiana changed the subject with a bright voice to lighten the mood, fearing that she might have given him unnecessary trouble. “Oh, and that was my first time seeing him smile like that. I was so shocked at the way he smiled at Angelica.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I didn’t know because I’ve only seen his expressionless face, but he looks great smiling. Even if he smiled like that regularly, other women might become fond of him.”</p>
<p>“My brother’s smiling face is that likable?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Of course, he looks great now, but if he smiled more comfortably, I think that would make him look better… Lucius?”</p>
<p>Somehow, she gave him a stiff look, and he was staring at her with sharp, narrow eyes. Lucius, who approached Tiana as she was startled by the changed mood, reached out a hand and wrapped it around her waist.</p>
<p>“Does my brother… look good?”</p>
<p>“Uh, when I looked at him objectively, he was handsome. So…”</p>
<p>“So you think my brother is attractive.”</p>
<p>“Lucius…”</p>
<p>Lucius’s face, which came closer to hers, was somehow a little different. Inside the sharp look, a fire in his eyes was lit. It was just the way he looked at her and acted at night, but he talked a little more than normal.</p>
<p><em>Don’t tell me he is jealous. Because I said that Rael looks great? No, I said it objectively, but I just wanted to change the mood, but you’re responding like this here?</em> she thought.</p>
<p>“Lucius, are you… jealous right now?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you thought like that toward my brother.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s just something I said after seeing him. He is handsome, but it’s just an objective opinion, and to me, you’re much more attractive.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, do you indeed think that? I don’t really want to hear you compliment other men.”</p>
<p>Seeing him pout his lips, he was definitely jealous. She had tried to change the subject by complimenting Rael but hadn’t expected it to result in Lucius becoming jealous. The way he acted a little absurd and jealous was so cute that Tiana laughed. <em>What on earth am I going to do with this man?</em> She would have never thought that he’d be jealous of Rael.</p>
<p>No, perhaps it’s because of Rael. Lucius was the one she trusted the most and the one she’s closest to, and if she thought another man looked good, he could be jealous. This might even be his strange self-consciousness.</p>
<p>She leaned against his close body and put her arms around his neck. She kissed him, then he held her in his arms and sat on the table.</p>
<p>“The way I think of Rael is the same way you respect and trust him. I do think he is good-looking, but that’s just…”</p>
<p>“Don’t think about him, no matter what. The same goes for other men.”</p>
<p>“You’re surprisingly jealous, Lucius.”</p>
<p>“I am limited to you. If you said you’re thinking of another man… I don’t think I can bear that.”</p>
<p>“You can’t stop me.” Tiana burst into laughter at his serious talk and kissed him again. After kissing him deeper than she had earlier, she said, slightly moving away from him, “You are the one I love. There is no one else but you, Lucius.”</p>
<p>“It’s the same for me. Tiana, you are my one true love.” Again, he rushed in to kiss her, violently opening his mouth. His hand carefully grabbed her thigh, as Tiana was barely holding on to his squeezing chest.</p>
<p>Tiana shoved him and shouted quietly in surprise, “Lucius, this is the dining room!”</p>
<p>“I know…”</p>
<p>“No more of this. It’s better in the…”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I can hold it in any longer. I don’t want to let you go, even for a second.”</p>
<p>“No, but… I said no! Let’s just go to our room and…”</p>
<p>“Now, I want to do it. It is just the two of us here, and no one will come. Can’t we…?”</p>
<p>Tiana didn’t know what to do as Lucius stared at her with desperation in his eyes. However, it was too much in the dining room. She tried to reject him, but his kiss poured down on her again.</p>
<p>“What if someone outside hears us?”</p>
<p>“No one will hear. Everyone left after Warren earlier. They won’t return for a while. So… leave it to me, Tiana.”</p>
<p>“Lucius…”</p>
<p>His passionate eyes and anxious voice forced her to leave her body to him. Tiana slowly closed her eyes, feeling his heart beating and his tongue penetrating between her lips.</p>
