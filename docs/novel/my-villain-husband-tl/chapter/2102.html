            <p>“Tiana… When did you get here?”</p>
<p>The voice slowly calling her name was fatigued. Tiana could feel his hands around her waist squeezing harder.</p>
<p>“A little while ago.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you wake me?”</p>
<p>“I thought you were tired, so I was going to wake you up later. Are you okay? You can sleep more if you’re really tired.”</p>
<p>“No… I’m fine.”</p>
<p>His light breath touched the back of her neck. Squinting at the documents in Tiana’s other hand while she stroked his hair, he said,</p>
<p>“You… saw that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, this? Only the first part. I was curious since it’s related to the Sinadelli incident, so I took a look at it.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t see the back part?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t. I was about to, but then you woke up.”</p>
<p>“Oh, okay…”</p>
<p>Tiana looked at him, who was staring calmly at the papers and felt weird. Why was the back part so important? She stopped patting Lucius’s head and took the documents. And when she tried to flip it to the back page, his big hand blocked her.</p>
<p>“Lucius?”</p>
<p>“I’m getting hungry. Aren’t you, Tiana?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah I am, but…”</p>
<p>“Then let’s head to the dining room.”</p>
<p>Naturally taking the papers from her hand, he threw them onto his desk before lifting Tiana by the waist. Surprised, she put her arms around his neck and smiled quietly, and he left the office at a quick pace.</p>
<p>“Lucius. Let me down. I can walk.”</p>
<p>“Nope. I want to carry you all the way to the dining room.”</p>
<p>“No, then everyone will see us like this.”</p>
<p>“So what? I’ll barely get to see you today. I don’t want to be apart.”</p>
<p>“Lucius…”</p>
<p>He placed a kiss on her forehead and smiled softly. Tiana sighed helplessly, seeing that it didn’t look like he’d set her down. If you do this, I’ll be stuck. How are you so aggressive these days? she thought. That was good and all, but sometimes it was embarrassing when he acted like this regardless of their location.</p>
<p>They came down to the dining room, and he ate while receiving hot glares from the servants. Tiana hated that Lucius ignored the gazes and ate as if nothing had happened, but she had no choice but to just get over it as he smiled with his pretty gold eyes shining.</p>
<p>By now she had completely forgotten about the part of the documents that he had blocked her from reading.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later. Tiana helped Lucius get dressed as he got ready to go out after breakfast. In the meantime, a few times before he went out, she combed his hair, chose his coat, and dressed him, but perhaps he liked it so much, lately, he has been asking her to do it every morning.</p>
<p>After arranging his slightly disheveled hair and putting on the coat she’d pre-selected, Lucius smiled happily and hugged her at the waist.</p>
<p>“Thanks again, Tiana.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. You look great today, my husband.”</p>
<p>“I want to remain together like this. I don’t want to go.”</p>
<p>“Suck it up. You’re going to Sinadelli today too, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Though I might be a tad bit late today. You can have dinner without me.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>With a nod, she snapped a brooch onto his coat; its two-sword design went well with his black coat. As Tiana stared at him, checking to see if everything was fixed, Lucius smiled and kissed her.</p>
<p>“Tiana, did you say you’re meeting Viscountess Garnett and Baron Evett June today?”</p>
<p>“Yes. They said they’re visiting later this afternoon. Oh, and thanks for telling Evett.”</p>
<p>After the tea party a few days ago, Tiana had talked with Viscountess Garnett and set a date for her to visit. She had also scheduled it with Evett, but the date was earlier than she’d expected. As she found out, it seemed that Lucius had told the Baron about her.</p>
<p>He shook his head with gratitude.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Since you and the Viscountess got along well, I think he would have been fine with it even without my telling him. I guess he’d heard about you from her.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? But still, it’s because you told him that I’ll be able to be at ease later when they come by.”</p>
<p>“You will be fine.”</p>
<p>Tiana kissed him lightly on the cheek. As they slowly parted from each other, Lucius, staring sadly at her, kissed her once more, then went on his way.</p>
<p>Having a sweet time every morning, was the privilege of newlyweds. Later as time went by, they wouldn’t be newlyweds anymore, but she wanted to stay with Lucius like newlyweds for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>She saw him off, then headed to the office. There were some documents to prepare for the conversation between Viscountess Garnett and Baron Evett, who will visit in the afternoon.</p>
<p>She called Warren to help her prepare the documents: The ratio of her shares to the amount to be invested, the distribution of profits, etc. Tiana got a headache from just scanning through everything. She tried several types of jobs to make a living but never expected she’d be running an investment company.</p>
<p>Lucius had said that he wouldn’t care if she failed, but still, it would be fun to give it a try. In particular, she hoped that the aristocrats’ investments made some profit.</p>
