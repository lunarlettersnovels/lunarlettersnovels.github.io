            <p><b>Chapter 33 – Will You Marry Me?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lucius, your eyes. They shine so brightly whether it’s day or night. They’re wonderful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lucius?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Tiana.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, her heart felt suddenly heavy when she heard his voice called out on her with such sorrow. Concerned, she shifted her steps back to him but Lucius began walking toward her and continued speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first time… we met, you didn’t use the parasol. No matter how many times the maid tried handing it back to you, you just kept standing in the sun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana stopped walking midway, blinded by the intense look of his golden eyes moving closer and closer to her. She has no choice but to wait for him as she couldn’t move a muscle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A while later, you, who had been reluctant to take the parasol, looked up at the sky, and I couldn’t take my eyes off you. It felt like I had lost all my senses watching how your eyes sparkle with pure joy of just simply looking up in the sky. Today I feel like I did then… How can such a mundane act of yours disarm a man such as myself, is beyond me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Tiana’s feet were glued to the ground, the beating of her heart suddenly depended on Lucius’ every word as if her life was hanging on each thread of emotions he was ready to confess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he stopped. Tiana sighed abruptly in protest; he was so near yet so far from her. Then, Lucius carefully pulled something out of his breast pocket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Lucius took hold of the luxurious black box in his hand, he took a deep breath for a moment and then approached her again slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I still remember the day when, looking at the same sky, you gazed upon me with your sorrowful eyes. I’ll never forget how you made me feel, I couldn’t understand it but… Even then, you said the same thing. That my one-of-a-kind eyes are wonderful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Lucius”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that moment, I finally recognize what I want through your eyes. You are the one.  If you are, wouldn’t you look past all of my transgressions? If you are, wouldn’t you stay by my side smiling just like you are now? Someone with such eyes drowning me towards the purity of your soul… I wanted you by my side.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking two steps in stride, Lucius then carefully opened the lid of the black box with a slightly nervous expression on his face but a very determined heart. With no more words to utter, he stared at her fervently, anticipating for what was to come. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the box is a ring with an enormous and brilliantly sparkling jewel, reminiscent of a diamond but with a bit of gray and bluish tinge. Tiana has never seen such preciousness in her life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stood there, beautifully frozen, starkly comparable with the unexpected ring in front of her. She blinked several times before staring back at those golden eyes that she loves so much. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the gracious man speaks again with so much sincerity in his voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““Tiana, will you… marry me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana drew a sharp breath. She hasn’t been breathing well throughout the time he approached her. She felt her heart was about to explode with so much emotion she was feeling all at once. She found her hand covering the gape of her mouth. The unpredictability of the situation surprised her to the core, in a very good way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could he? A ring? A proposal? It was like a fantasy: the way Lucius, in his striking pose, held the box in front of her with such softness and resolve in his eyes. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Am I dreaming? My love has proposed to me… He’s holding a ring…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her hands trembled uncontrollably, as the pounding of her heart and the suddenness of the duke’s action made her unable to process what transpired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, she wanted to scream ‘yes,’ and allow him to put on that marvelous ring on her finger, but how could she? Astonished, shaking, and overwhelmed—the mixed emotions were making it impossible to compose herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh… is this too much? Is the ring unnecessary?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to read the meaning of Tiana’s stillness, Lucius’ face turned blue and he lowered the box slowly, thinking perhaps Tiana had rejected him.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Hey! No! Never!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want it! Give it! Please give it to me!” Atlas, Tiana found her voice again after much inner struggle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, that’s not what I meant. You’re right. The ring is perfect. Uh, sorry! I’m a bit shocked, so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failing to keep her exhilaration at bay, she spoke too fast that she didn’t even know what she’d said. She felt a burning heat concentrating on her cheeks that she placed her still shaking hands on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I’ll take the ring, but this proposal is way too exciting!” She said, embarrassed that her greediness might show amidst such intoxicating feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius looked at Tiana, with his hopes up even though he couldn’t make out what she was saying. The color on her face that she futilely attempted to hide said it all though, so he concentrated on that and ignored all the gibberish she uttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing that she was not making any sense and to talk more would be fruitless, Tiana finally shut up. She then mustered her courage to bring forth what was truly in her heart through her eyes as she gazed upon him with sincerity, and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally understanding and confirming Tiana’s feelings, Lucius eagerly removed the ring from the box. He took another step forward, gently lifted Tiana’s left hand, and lovingly slid the ring onto her wedding finger.</span></p>
