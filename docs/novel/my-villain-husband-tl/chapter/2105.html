            <p>As they walked through a glass door, they saw a large garden and a small building made of glass. When they entered the door held open by a waiting servant, an unusual scene unfolded.</p>
<p>“Oh my…”</p>
<p>“Wow… This place is nice…”</p>
<p>The overall glass space had many plants, just like the cafe Tiana had seen in Sinadelli the other day. Many kinds of plants were seen as if the small botanical garden had been moved here, and there was something unusual about them.</p>
<p>“These pots and bowls… were they all made here?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. They were all made by my family.”</p>
<p>All of the plants, densely packed into pots and bowls, were unique. From rare-shaped flower pots which were not available on the market to uniquely designed bowls. Just what you’d expect from a family running a pottery business.</p>
<p>Looking outside that, there was evidence of meticulous care. Angelica smiled proudly after looking at Tiana and Alexandra’s astounded reactions. Just from the look in her eyes, Tiana could see how much labor had gone into caring for this space.</p>
<p>“My goodness, they’re all amazing. So unique-looking and pretty. They’re really to my liking, but a lot of these I haven’t seen at your family’s stores.”</p>
<p>“They’re made personally, so some of these we do not sell and some are in the process of launching. But since most of them will be sold on the market soon, you’ll be able to see them shortly.”</p>
<p>“I’m relieved to hear that. If I can, I’d like to reserve some,” said Alexandra.</p>
<p>“For you two, I can certainly do that. Please let me know if there’s anything you like.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Alexandra smiled excitedly at Angelica’s words. Tiana and Angelica burst out laughing as she paced around the wide space, taking mental photos of this and that.</p>
<p>The moment their gazes met, she said shyly to Tiana,</p>
<p>“Let me know if you want anything, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. It’s just that I love everything. I’m curious how your family comes up with these designs.”</p>
<p>“Your words are too kind. I think it’s because the potters in my family are good. Though it’s a problem that they all work so diligently.”</p>
<p>From the looks of her humble attitude of speaking, she was prideful of the potters. Perhaps Angelica trusted the potters, Tiana was a little surprised because Angelica looked the same as when she had seen the products.</p>
<p>As Tiana had seen her detached appearance a lot in the original story, she had no idea she had this side to her. Although she became an empress and worked with Rael and gained vitality, she seemed to be indifferent and bothered by anything until around the middle of the story.</p>
<p>Maybe this was who she really was now. Had something happened because of the Verne family’s business before the original story? It had been well taken care of, but it might have affected her.</p>
<p>‘There might be something going on from now.’</p>
<p>Looking at the family’s current condition, they still seemed fine, but a problem might occur after the launch of their new product. Angelica’s detached attitude in the original story was appealing, but Tiana had felt sorry to see her like that.  It was saddening that Tiana might not be able to see the way her eyes used to glisten again.</p>
<p>While she was wondering what to do, Alexandra finished up looking around. The three women moved aside as the maids brought out some tea.</p>
<p>And they were served dessert to go along with their fragrant black tea. The tea and dessert were delicious, but the pretty teacups and bowls stole Tiana’s attention, so she couldn’t stop looking at them.</p>
<p>Since she was constantly admiring, Angelica, who was relieved, sent a servant to bring two large boxes.</p>
<p>“I want to thank you again for coming. And this is what I’ve prepared to repay you for what happened last time. I hope you like it.”</p>
<p>After looking at the boxes on the table, Tiana and Alexandra promptly untied the ribbons with anticipation. Inside the boxes were uniquely designed tea sets, bowls, and accessories.</p>
<p>“Oh my… This is wonderful! These are your newly launched products?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We’ve proudly launched these after a painstaking process. I’ve prepared separate gifts for the both of you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much. I really love them, but I think it would be a waste to use them.”</p>
<p>The slightly different colored, differently designed tea sets were lovely. The more Tiana looked at the designs as well as the quality, the more she liked them. Alexandra was also looking at them with glistening eyes, so it was clear that these products would cause a great sensation when they were released.</p>
<p>Relieved, Angelica said while smiling at their positive reactions,</p>
<p>“As pottery products are made on the premise of being used, I just hope you’ll use them a lot.  The children couldn’t be happier if you use them often. Of course, so would I and my family’s potters.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I won’t miss out on tea time from now on.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Angelica smiled again at their positive reactions. While continuing a casual conversation, Alexandra, who was seen hesitating, asked carefully,</p>
<p>“Angelica. I’ve heard this rumor; by chance have you heard it too?”</p>
<p>“What rumor?”</p>
<p>“That you and Emperor Rael… are in a relationship.”</p>
<p>“Whaaaa?”</p>
<p>In mere seconds, the once smiling face had turned into a frown.</p>
