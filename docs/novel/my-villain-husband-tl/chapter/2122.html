            <p>After Alexandra left, Tiana went over the data about the aristocrats until Lucius came. She was slowly looking through the vast amount of information, but nothing really caught her eye.</p>
<p>With her mind still set on Evett’s café, she threw the others aside and decided to do something else. Now it was time for the commoners to choose a candidate among the aristocrats to invest in.</p>
<p>“First, we’ll send relief supplies to the nearest children’s home; I hope there’s a space for the commoners to apply for and receive the subsidies themselves.”</p>
<p>If so, that meant that Tiana needed an office for the grant work. Thinking about not only work but other duties in the future, an office was necessary. There wouldn’t be any problems with finances, but it would be good to discuss it with Lucius first. And get some advice on where it would be good to make an office.</p>
<p>She wrote it down on her to-do list, went on with the rest of her work, so time was spent well. Before she knew it, she saw the sunset through the window, so she stretched and got up from the chair.</p>
<p>And with perfect timing, Inabel let her know that Lucius had arrived. Leaving the office and heading downstairs, she saw him walking in.</p>
<p>“Lucius!”</p>
<p>Tiana hadn’t seen her husband for half the day. As she quickly approached him for a hug, he smiled and embraced her.</p>
<p>“Come here. How was work?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It was fine. Didn’t you work a lot today, Tiana?”</p>
<p>“Nope. I did what I could. Oh, Alexandra dropped by this afternoon.”</p>
<p>Lucius perked his eyebrow, “Alexandra?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. She was worried about what happened, so she came to visit. It was good to see her and talk with her after such a long time.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. I’m glad you enjoyed seeing her.”</p>
<p>With a smile on his face, he kissed Tiana on the cheek. Removing his coat for him and handing it to a maid, they immediately headed to the dining room as it was time for dinner.</p>
<p>They sat down, and as the food was coming out Tiana talked about the conversation she had had with Alexandra. Listening carefully, Lucius stiffened his face slightly and muttered, “Baron Evett June…”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Do you know him?” Tiana asked.</p>
<p>“We exchanged looks when I reserved our seats at the café a few days ago. I’ve never met him in person, but I’ve heard about him through people here and there.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? Alexandra told me he was a good guy. What do you think of him?”</p>
<p>Lucius paused before speaking. “He doesn’t have a bad reputation among the aristocrats. As Alexandra said, he is kind and gentle, but when it comes to the café business, he is like a different person.”</p>
<p>“I guess he takes his business seriously.”</p>
<p>Half the reason for his going independent was the café business. Having heard it like this again, Lucius seemed to have an idea of what kind of person Evett was. Thinking for a while, he took a sip of water and brought it up as if he had suddenly thought of it and asked, “Remember the last time we saw Kenil? We saw him with Viscount Grassel and Lona.”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. You mean the guy who was the director of the botanical garden?”</p>
<p>Kenil, who is also Lona’s secretary. The whole time Tiana looked around the botanical garden, there’d been a strange atmosphere around Lona.</p>
<p>“Evett June is Kenil’s younger brother,” said Lucius.</p>
<p>“Huh? Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Kenil’s parents had three children. The oldest one married Viscount Garnett, and the middle one was baronized. The youngest was also baronized, but left the family home soon after.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>So Kenil wasn’t the oldest. From his stern, grumpy personality, Tiana had thought he was an only child or the oldest, but she hadn’t expected Viscountess Garnett to be the oldest. So Evett was the youngest.</p>
<p>“I heard from Kenil that Evett has always liked flowers and tea. And they also say that he has a lot of knowledge about them, so that’s why he decided to turn his passion into a café business. Even the reservation was possible thanks to Kenil introducing me to him,” added Lucius.</p>
<p>“I’m wondering if I should make him my first investment if he’s a good person. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“You mean Evett’s café business?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I really loved it when we went, and if the atmosphere is all right, I’ll invest in it and hopefully help him expand the business. And I think it will be great if he opens a few more branches, even in the capital.”</p>
<p>Lucius thought about it for a moment. He made the same slightly stiffened face she’d seen earlier. Was there a problem? While Tiana stared at him with a strange look on her face, Lucius said, grinning and nodding, “I think that will be okay. It’s promising, and Evett’s reputation is not bad, so I think it’ll be a good first investment.”</p>
<p>“I was going to decide after meeting him in person. Alexandra finally said that she’s having a tea party soon, and she said she invited Viscountess Garnett, so I was thinking I can meet with him then and talk.”</p>
<p>“I can arrange a meeting with him.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’ll be a good idea to be too direct. I want to slowly inform him about my business ventures; to do so, I want to proceed behind the scenes by meeting Viscountess Garnett rather than doing your plan.”</p>
<p>If Lucius or Tiana took action, she could call Evett in person without meeting Viscountess Garnett through Alexandra. That would be convenient, but if she were to do that it’ll catch the attention of other aristocrats.</p>
<p>Settling in the capital right after marriage, almost every aristocrat was watching the grand duchy. One single action had caused great reactions, which stressed her out. So if it’s possible she wanted to let Evett know about her business at a later date.</p>
