            <p><strong>Chapter 70 – The Moon’s Blessing</strong></p>
<p>After suppressing a sigh, Tiana said to him something that had just popped into her head.</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry about your last visit. You came to see me, but we couldn’t really talk much and you had to leave.”</p>
<p>“No need to apologize. Besides, I got to talk to your father, so it was good. Are you getting along well with your brother?”</p>
<p>“Not sure if it’s going well, but we seem to be getting along. Though it does get awkward at times.”</p>
<p>“What a relief. Time will iron out the awkward moments too.”</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>
<p>When she got off the swing and tried to stand up, Lucius blocked her from moving and bent in front of her. While he held her hand, the bright moonlight poured down over his head. The sight of his fluttering gold eyes and him kissing the back of her hand was beautiful, like a dream.</p>
<p>“Actually, I haven’t been able to come here for a few days, so I came to see you even if I am a bit late. I heard that you haven’t been feeling well, so… I wanted to see if you’re alright?”</p>
<p>“Who did you hear that from?”</p>
<p>“I heard it from one of your close maids.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>A while back when she had discovered the duchess’ ledger, Inabel probably had relayed to Lucius about her crying and feeling depressed. She certainly had been disturbed at that time, but not anymore. Although it hurts to look at it from time to time, she was going to bring it to the grand duchy because it was such a precious item. That ledger was her mother’s medium, the mother she couldn’t meet in this life, or ever again. Every time she looked at it, she felt affectionate and wanted to keep it.</p>
<p>With her a little subdued and silent, Lucius looked at her with a more worried look. Feeling worried, he grabbed Tiana’s hand.</p>
<p>“If you’re uneasy about the wedding… is there something I can do?” He asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I was told that a bride who is about to get married would have a lot of psychological anxiety because she longs for her pre-marriage life. Is that right?”</p>
<p>Tiana saw a glimpse of anxiety on his face looking at her with nervous eyes.</p>
<p>“No! Who said that to you?”</p>
<p>“Alexandra. She said that before a wedding, women have lots of psychological pressures.”</p>
<p><em>I knew it</em>, Tiana thought.</p>
<p>She had anticipated something small, but why did Alexandra have to tell him all of that? Or was it that she hasn’t even married yet? Tiana knew that Lucius’ sister was younger than her, but how could she know so much? Either way, she’ll have to correct Lucius, who had a big misunderstanding. She sighed and grabbed his hand.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. I wasn’t feeling like myself a few days ago, but that was because of something else; it’s not that I’m anxious or worried about marrying you.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Of course. Why would I be worried or uneasy about marrying you? Obviously, I’m worried that I’ll have a lot of responsibilities as your wife, but that’s one thing. It’s not like I’m nervous or worried about my marriage to you.”</p>
<p>Of course, she was worried about becoming the grand duchess but she didn’t really have any other marriage-related concerns. Why would she worry knowing that it would reduce the time that she should be enjoying? Her marriage to him would be happiness itself. Similar to modern times, there seemed to be an unstable psychological state for brides before marriage, which was not the case for Tiana. Shouldn’t she be happy to be able to see Lucius’ face every day when she wakes up and every night before falling to sleep? To hell with the worries and anxiety. Tiana wanted to yell out the words ‘I feel great!’</p>
<p>Even with her sincere heart, the anxiety was not erased from his face as if her words were not enough. She let go of his hand, grabbed both his cheeks, and pulled him in, taking him by surprise.</p>
<p>“Lucius.”</p>
<p>The space between them was so little, they could feel each other’s breath. When Tiana slightly tilted her head down to look into his wide-open, gold eyes, he looked at her without a word.</p>
<p>“I accepted your proposal to me. And I also proposed to you. Did you forget about that?”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>“If I were anxious and uneasy about marrying you, would I tell you to marry me?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to have a lot of new things in my life, and it’s going to be different and hectic. But there’s nothing to worry about because you’ll be by my side.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“Rather, I will be full of happiness and anticipation. Don’t you feel the same way?”</p>
<p>“I do. I feel the same way, Tiana.”</p>
<p>When he finally said this with confidence, Tiana was relieved. He let go of his anxious expression and smiled. His shy smile forced her hand to hold his face tighter without realizing it. His red lips and smile were clearly visible under the night sky.</p>
<p><em>Eh, screw it!</em> Tiana kissed his tempting lips on impulse.</p>
<p>It was for a second, but their lips definitely touched. Lucius, totally shocked, stared at her with eyes as wide as the moon. Red was filling his face, and somehow Tiana thought her temperature was rising, so she laughed.</p>
<p>“I was originally planning to do that tomorrow, but since the moon is watching us, I did it in advance. The kiss of oath.”</p>
<p>Since he was speechless, she continued speaking.</p>
<p>“You know, because the moon officiated, our kiss has been legitimized. As a bride and groom to—”</p>
<p>“Tiana.”</p>
<p>The serious look in Lucius’ eyes gradually became deeper. It was an impulsive kiss, so she had barely glossed over his lips, but for some reason, she was shier of his eyes, which began to bear a little heat.</p>
<p>It was good to have had the nerve, but how should she deal with what came after? While the silence hammocked between them, having rolled her head, Tiana quickly rose up when she saw the tilted moon.</p>
<p>“It’s getting late. You have to go, if you don’t plan on being late for the wedding tomorrow…”</p>
<p>“Tiana.”</p>
<p>As she was about to walk past him, Lucius wrapped his arms around her and pulled her to him. Surprising Tiana by the instant force, he hugged her waist as if he would never let go.</p>
<p>Before she could say anything, he placed his lips over hers. Different from the peck earlier, this kiss was long and deep. Tiana closed her eyes slowly, feeling his lips against hers.</p>
<p>The moon behind Lucius seemed to smile at them.</p>
