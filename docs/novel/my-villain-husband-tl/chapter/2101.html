            <p>“Are you going to use the name of the investment business owner as it is?”</p>
<p>“Well… I don’t mind announcing it, but is it better to use an alias? I don’t want to be a nuisance.”</p>
<p>“I think it will be fine if you use an alias for the time being. It will be announced someday, but it hasn’t been that long since your return to society, so it will be a little difficult for you if the business name is known, madam.”</p>
<p>“That is correct. Then what will be a good name?”</p>
<p>Even though she’s using an alias, if the company gets enough investors, the news will be bound to spread like wildfire. She’ll wait until later to announce herself as the owner. Still, she doesn’t know if she can hold out for a long time if she’s blocked by the grand duchy.</p>
<p>Picking up a pen, Tiana thought about what to write in the blank space next to the <em>Name of the Business Owner</em>. Should I modify my name? Quick-witted people might catch on to me. Then what’s a good name? she thought. I want something that has meaning. Since this is my first business.</p>
<p>“Hmmm…”</p>
<p>“Have you decided, madam?”</p>
<p>She thought it over for a long time, then slowly wrote in the blank space after deciding: <em>T&amp;L Co.</em> The first initials of Tiana and Lucius. It was a simple and easy business name.</p>
<p>“I did it.”</p>
<p>“Looks like you used the initials from your name and Lord Lucius’ name, madam. Good idea.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Like I said, I wanted it to be meaningful. It’s thanks to Lucius that I was able to start this business, so I wanted to include his name.”</p>
<p>“He will be so happy.”</p>
<p>Tiana smiled at Warren and finished writing the contract. Then she spent the rest of the morning preparing other related materials.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After a non-stop busy morning, Tiana ate a small breakfast. Viscount Garnett and Baron Evett would be visiting soon, so she returned to her room to get ready.</p>
<p>“Find something neat and not too flashy.”</p>
<p>“Sure will, Lady Tiana. And I will get accessories to match it.”</p>
<p>As it was a business-related meeting, it seemed that a quiet and calm atmosphere would be right rather than something glamorous. Upon hearing her, Jane soon brought the accessories she chose with her dress.</p>
<p>A dark navy dress with sapphire jewels. She had a good eye for fashion. Jane smiled proudly when Tiana nodded positively. Thanks to the maids’ fast hands, who soon started preparing alongside Jane, Tiana was able to get dressed up in no time.</p>
<p>Knock knock.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>Warren entered.</p>
<p>“Viscountess Garnett and Baron Evett have arrived, madam.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’ll be there soon.”</p>
<p>Perfect timing. She thanked the maids and Jane for their hard work and quickly left the room. Arriving on the first floor, Tiana greeted the two guests who’d finally arrived.</p>
<p>“Welcome. Viscountess Garnett, Baron Evett.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for inviting us, Your Highness Grand Duchess Tiana. This is my younger brother.”</p>
<p>“It is an honor to meet you, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Evett.”</p>
<p>When she extended her hand, he grabbed it with a nervous face. Brown hair and red eyes. He resembled the Viscountess, but Tiana was surprised to see his body stronger than expected. He was taller and looked more muscular than Kenil. She didn’t want to be prejudiced against him, but a man like that liked flower tea?</p>
<p>Leaving behind the unexpected twist, she led the two to the living room. Tiana smiled when she saw that they couldn’t relax while they looked around the spacious living room curiously.</p>
<p>“There is no need to be nervous. Just be comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Your Highness. I can’t calm myself since I never thought I’d meet the Grand Duchess.”</p>
<p>“It’s the same place where normal people live. It isn’t anything special, so please make yourselves at home.”</p>
<p>“Yes… But even when we came in through the entrance the garden was splendid, and so is this interior. Indeed a grand mansion.”</p>
<p>Evett continued to admire the mansion while looking around the living room. His sister sitting next to him gestured for him to calm down, but even her eyes were rolling around in awe.</p>
<p>“By the way, the atmosphere is different from what I thought.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Obviously, it’s a splendid mansion. And the garden is well-decorated. But, how can I say it… I expected it to have a chilly atmosphere, but it’s rather warm.”</p>
<p>“Warm?”</p>
<p>Tiana’s head tilted at Evett’s comment. Did he say warm? She seemed to know what a chilly environment was, but it was unexpected for him to call it warm. The Grand Duke’s mansion itself was not bright, and the interior was decorated with calm colors rather than bright ones. It was not warm but cold.</p>
<p>Recently, bright decorations had been brought in little by little, but nothing had changed noticeably yet.</p>
<p>Looking at Tiana, who was agonizing, he nodded slowly and said,</p>
<p>“I think it’s because of you, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“…because of me?”</p>
