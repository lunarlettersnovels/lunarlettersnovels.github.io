            <p><strong>Chapter 69 – Reconnected</strong></p>
<p>“I heard that the wedding is in two weeks.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, yes.”</p>
<p>“I’m late, but congratulations.”</p>
<p>“Thanks L—uh…” Tiana’s lips clamped shut at his deep gaze. Would it be appropriate to call him ‘Lenno’, now that he was in front of her, or by his full name?</p>
<p>Seeing her hesitation and trying to ease the mood, Lennox spoke up.</p>
<p>“You can call me what you did earlier. Call me Lenno.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Father explained your situation to me. I’m beyond happy that you remembered my nickname from before. So, please continue to call me that.”</p>
<p>“Alright then…Lenno.” She nodded and called him by his nickname.</p>
<p>Lenno’s face which had been stiff up until now finally relaxed, and Tiana could see an unrestrained smile on his face. When she saw his dimples, she calmed her heart that was about to burst out from inside.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t he so cute?</em> <em>Lucius, Lennox, and the others are all so lovely, but what did the previous possessor not like so much about me?</em> she thought. <em>It’s so strange to think that someone out there really does not like me. For now, let’s resolve these complicated situations first and do as I was about to do.</em></p>
<p>But as she was holding her teacup, a slightly anxious feeling settled in her chest.</p>
<p>“Lenno.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it will be hard for you to forget the past, but I’ll say it like this, I want to apologize for all of the things I’ve done to you. It put a lot of unnecessary stress on you and I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“…Tiana.”</p>
<p>“It may sound strange, but I hope you see from now on that everything I do is real. In the meantime, I… I want to erase your bad memories of me. Though I don’t think I can just cover the past like that. But I just want you to shake off that memory with who I am now.”</p>
<p>He was still speechless so she continued.</p>
<p>“After the wedding, I’ll be leaving and moving to the grand duchy, but it doesn’t mean that we’ll stop seeing each other. I’ll also ask Lucius for his understanding. All of my memory hasn’t come back to me yet, but I want to spend time with you again, as proper siblings.”</p>
<p>To Tiana, Lennox was her first and only younger brother. The possessor, who was gone anyway, had thrown her out. Now all they had to do was restore their broken relationship. She had no intention of continuing on with the original story. So, she knew it would be better if she tried to make amends in the relationships that were ruined by the possessor.</p>
<p>Most of all, Tiana really liked Lennox. Aside from Lucius and Rose, Angelica and Rael were her favorites, but it seemed like that would change from today onwards.</p>
<p>While waiting for Lennox to say something, she looked him in the eyes. He gazed at her for a long time before nodding with a bright smile.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to have you back, big sis.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Treating his sister with sincerity, Lennox approached Tiana without any resistance. During her remaining time in the mansion, the two spent every single day together. There were still some awkward moments, but they knew they’ll get better with time. Therefore, they just patiently took things slow.</p>
<p>It was the night before the wedding. Coming out to the garden after eating dinner, Tiana sat on the swing she had found a few days ago and looked up at the bright, shining moon.</p>
<p>“So, tomorrow is the big day.”</p>
<p>It was two months since the possessor left. At the end of this long but short journey, tomorrow she was finally marrying Lucius. She hadn’t expected for something good to happen, here in these modern times, let alone meet someone and fall in love. At the same time, the hardships she faced, played back in fragments in her mind. But now the troubles were over! From now on, there would be much more to do, but even if it’s hard on her body, she could bear it. No matter how much work she had to do, she would enjoy her newlywed life for the next year. In marriage, the first year is the most important. Of course, with Lucius, Tiana hoped to spend her whole life happy, but the best time to enjoy it is when a couple is newly married.</p>
<p>Somehow the moon seemed brighter today, perhaps it’s a sign wishing her a happy married life. Tiana wanted to ask the moon for a favor.</p>
<p>“Oh, beautiful moon, I have a favor to ask. Please make us the happiest couple in the world. I want to make Lucius happy, so please help me with that.”</p>
<p>After putting her hands together for prayer, right when she was about to say, ‘Watch over us,’ a familiar voice cut her off.</p>
<p>“Please watch over us.”</p>
<p>She jerked before turning to look at him. He had appeared out of the blue without making a sound.</p>
<p>“…Lucius?”</p>
<p>“So that Tiana and I can have the happiest times of our lives.”</p>
<p>A soft smile decorated his face. His exceptionally shiny, gold eyes resembled the moonlight behind him, forcing Tiana to stare at him dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Why are you here, Lucius?”</p>
<p>When she asked this after making a bewildered face at him, he just laughed and answered.</p>
<p>“I came because I missed you.”</p>
<p>These were true words from his heart. There was no lie on that grinning face. He had been saying that to Tiana ever since that day he dried her hair for her. Was this Alexandra’s influence? The effects of the advice she had given him were apparent.</p>
