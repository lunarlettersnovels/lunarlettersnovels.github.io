            <p><b>Chapter 7 – The Unexpected Visitor</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consequences of the accident are fading. Daily life has become much better. She meets Edwin at the restaurant, where he sits at a lavish table. As she sits down, he smiles at her, “I hope you enjoy it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because she needs to eat healthily, no greasy food is served on the platter. The duke’s head chef exerted his utmost best to prepare a good meal for her because she was coming to the restaurant to eat for the first time since the accident, allowing her to delight in scrumptious appetizers. It has been a very long time since she had had a meal that was prepared just for her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the meal, she has tea with Edwin. She takes a sip of the tea and studies Edwin from across the table. During her recuperation, he had come to see her every morning, always leaving as abruptly as he came and giving no chance for a chat. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He must be really busy being a Duke of the empire, but he always makes time and comes by to greet me every morning.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He never says much, only checks to see that her condition is getting better. He did not want to be a bother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wanted to allow her time to adapt and recover. She was beginning to adjust to life here faster than she had thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwin puts down his teacup and asks her in a soft voice as if he felt her gaze. “Are you feeling better now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I’m feeling a lot better now after getting a lot of rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad. Still, the after-effects are going to last a while because it was a major accident. Don’t push yourself too much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I won’t. Thank you for your concern,” she paused, “father.” It still feels so strange to utter the word. She couldn’t call him ‘Edwin’ like the others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wears a look of surprise as if he did not expect her to call him ‘father.’ She smiles awkwardly and looks away from him. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is he looking at me that way? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she had lost her memory, she was still his daughter, Tiana. There should be nothing wrong with calling him ‘father.’ She asks herself, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was their relationship so bad that she didn’t call him father? He has been really sweet to me.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was never enough time to see him. However, she could see that despite his being unable to express himself properly, he was a kind and loving father.  She did not have a father to call her own and because of that, she was happy to be able to call someone father. She hoped she was not getting ahead of herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I… Am I not supposed to call your father? Should I rather call you by your name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh no. Why would you ask such a thing? You are my daughter, so of course, you should call me father.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I was wondering, because of how you reacted to it.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m just really happy and I think it’s fortunate that you woke up. I am glad I can talk to you like this again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She nods her head with a smile. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He really has a way with words. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was something wrong and she knew it. His expression earlier did not match his words. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He must be hiding something</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Feeling it wasn’t the right time to start digging, she shrugs it off her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakfast continued with a tinge of awkward silence. She is thinking of what to say when a knock on the door breaks the silence and Alfred, the butler, came in. He seems in a hurry, unease evident in his eyes. When he sees her, he hesitates but he speaks up anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Grace, there…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a guest for the lady, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A guest?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is this unscheduled visitor? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is not the only one bewildered by the sudden visit. Edwin’s face sports a frown, “Who is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is the Grand Duke, Your Grace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Grace the Grand Duke? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as she knew, there was only one grand duke in the empire. That would be Lucius, the man who was to be her husband. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh goodness, he is here to see me?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She knew they would be meeting someday, but didn’t think it would be so soon. She is taken back by the sudden turn of events; however, she feels gladness sweep her heart. She is able to see him in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She desperately tries to stop her lips curling into a smile. She would have to contain herself. They didn’t know that she knew who Lucius was, because of her supposed memory loss. It would be strange to see her become excited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She tries to hide her smile from them. Alfred sees this and quickly assumes she is trying to hide her bewilderedness and proceeds to explain about Lucius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His Grace, the Grand Duke is my lady’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alfred.” Edwin rises from his seat and regards the butler with a threatening stare, shaking his head at him. “Tiana, go up to your room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why?” She wonders what had prompted the action. He was ruining her chance to meet Lucius. She stands up, follows Edwin, waiting for an answer. His eyes have softened now, but she can still glimpse the hard lines of a frown on his forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s still too early for you to meet guests. I’ll tell His Grace to excuse you, so you can go to your room now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll explain it to you later, just please go up now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes… I’ll do as you say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A myriad of questions swirled in her head. She watches the backs of Edwin and Alfred hurriedly strut to the parlor. She follows Inabelle who was there to wait on her into her room. Outside her room, Inabelle is waiting for her. She feels uncomfortable not knowing what is going on but enters her room with Inabelle.</span></p>
