            <p>Something about that place had really caught Tiana’s eye. She didn’t expect his café business to be ‘Laurent’. While Tiana was shocked at the unexpected revelation, Alexandra’s voice raised. “The branch will start to expand soon. Well, it’s just getting popular, so it’s a good idea to take this opportunity to increase the number of branches. Apparently, Evett is putting all his attention on that because it’s his first business since he became independent.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“However, with his assets, it is difficult to expand, so he is looking for investors, but I guess it is not easy.”</p>
<p>“How so? Productivity is good, and it’s starting to gain popularity, so if it grows a little bit, he’ll be able to make a profit soon,” Tiana said.</p>
<p>“That’s good. It sounds like a good product. However, no matter how profitable the product is, it will be hard to find investors. I’m not sure how it would be for a marquis or an earl, but he is a baron.”</p>
<p>“Oh… You’re saying it’s a problem because of his low status?” asked Tiana.</p>
<p>Another classic case of ‘class difference’. Tiana had been expecting this, but it felt much different actually hearing it. There were so many problems not only among commoners but even among aristocrats.</p>
<p>When she sighed quietly as her brows were forced to frown, Alexandra continued, “There are many ‘classes’ among aristocrats who are similar. It’s even more so because the aristocracy itself is a closed class.”</p>
<p>“In terms of power and property, these are aspects that place importance on the rules. Because they don’t like change or broken rules.” Tiana added.</p>
<p>“Right. Since they’re that kind of group there is also a lot of discrimination between statuses. Counts have a small estate or have some property, but barons often only have a title, so they don’t get treated like aristocrats.”</p>
<p>“No matter how low an aristocrat is…”</p>
<p>Some people wonder how he is different from a knight, but he’s a noble who can definitely inherit a title. Since he is a low-ranking aristocrat with no assets, people ignore him because they don’t have much to do with him. I don’t know why they do that.”</p>
<p>Alexandra shook her head as if she didn’t like them, and took a sip of cold tea. Tiana thought there would be some discrimination, but seeing her reaction, there seemed to be a lot of it.</p>
<p>Seeing her talk like that, Alexandra didn’t seem like one to discriminate. Tiana calmly looked at her, then carefully said, “Are you okay with low-ranking aristocrats?”</p>
<p>“Of course. They are the same aristocrats. I don’t want to only look at people’s class ranking. The important thing is a person’s personality and heart.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I also think like that. Then do you happen to know what kind of person Evett is?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never met him in person, but I heard he has a soft personality. He was the second child in his family, but he did not want to fight for his successor, so he chose to become an independent baron and was awarded the title of the current baron,” spoke Alexandra. Tiana nodded and Alexandra continued, “He likes flowers and tea so much that he started a flower tea business. They said he knows more about it than ordinary women. I heard that the reason he went independent was that he wanted to run his own café business.”</p>
<p>There’s nothing harder than doing what you like as work, and even if you try to do it independently, you’re definitely really passionate about that business. He didn’t seem like a bad person.</p>
<p>Tiana could believe it since the information came from Alexandra, but she certainly wanted to meet the man in person and decide for herself. How could there not be a way to meet him? As she was thinking about it, Alexandra said, looking at Tiana’s face, “Don’t tell me you’re about to invest in Evett’s business.”</p>
<p>“Yes. That time I went to ‘Laurent’ I was so impressed, and Evett’s reputation doesn’t seem bad either. I’m wondering if I should meet him first before making a decision, but I don’t have a way to meet him…”</p>
<p>“I know a way! You can’t meet him right away, but I think I can connect you to him,” said Alexandra.</p>
<p>“Oh? Really?”</p>
<p>As soon as Tiana asked again at the unexpected good news, Alexandra happily nodded. “This is great! Actually, I had another reason for coming here. You start your social activities soon, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. My wound is almost healed and stable, so I thought I’d start soon.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought, so I brought an invitation. I really want to host a party for you as you start your new life.”</p>
<p>“Oh, what an honor. Thank you, Alexandra. What kind of party?” asked Tiana.</p>
<p>Spring is in full swing, so I thought it would be nice to have a tea party in my garden. I’m still making the invitation list, but I think I can invite Evett’s sister.”</p>
<p>“His sister?”</p>
<p>So he had a sister. Surely she would be the bridge to Evett. And she might know a lot about him, so Tiana would be able to hear some information about him and his business in detail.</p>
<p>“Evett’s sister is Viscountess Garnett. I’ve talked to her a few times at parties, so I’ll be able to bring it up to her,” said Alexandra.</p>
<p>“Is that so? It won’t cause a stir?”</p>
<p>Alexandra smiled. “Never. Rather, she’d be delighted. Don’t worry, she is a good person.”</p>
<p>“That’s a relief.”</p>
<p>What a coincidence that everything had lined up like this. Somehow it seemed like Tiana would meet Evett soon, so she was looking forward to meeting him. Because she wanted to meet and decide on her first investment. She really hoped he was a good person like Alexandra had said.</p>
