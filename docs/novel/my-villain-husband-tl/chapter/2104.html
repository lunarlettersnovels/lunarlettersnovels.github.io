            <p>Surprised by the atmosphere that had changed in the blink of an eye, Tiana looked at Angelica. Even Alexandra winced at Angelica’s unexpected reaction. Fixing her face after seeing everyone’s reaction, Angelica said,</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I was a bit shocked at the sudden topic.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. I was expecting that. We were surprised as well. Seeing your reaction, I guess you didn’t know about the rumor.”</p>
<p>“Huh…? How did the rumor come about?”</p>
<p>“Remember at the tea party? I heard that you and Rael were seen together on that day.”</p>
<p>“Oh… At that time…”</p>
<p>She nodded solemnly, perhaps remembering what had happened that day. Seeing her sighing a little, Alexandra asked her,</p>
<p>“Is it true? You and Rael are–”</p>
<p>“No. I did indeed see him that day, but it’s not the truth.”</p>
<p>Alexandra narrowed her eyebrows after seeing her say that so boldly.</p>
<p>“I heard that the two of you looked happy together… And you even hugged Rose as Rael smiled at you holding his pet.”</p>
<p>“It’s true that I did hug Rose. But I did it after getting his permission, and I am not sure if… Emperor Rael looked at me like that.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“It was very sudden that we even saw each other, and I was nervous, so I couldn’t have noticed him looking at me in a certain way. I’m not sure who it was that they saw, but it might be a mistake that he smiled…”</p>
<p>“Hmmm… That may be so. Since I only heard about it through the rumor. If you don’t think it was you involved, then it must not have been you. Someone must have mistaken you for someone else.”</p>
<p>“That’s definitely it.”</p>
<p>When Tiana saw Angelica, who was confident in her statement, and Alexandra nodding positively, she laughed inside. No, but it’s true. Because I, too, definitely saw her.</p>
<p>I don’t know what she’s talking about, but I saw her and the Emperor. I guess I didn’t hear the conversation, but from a distance, the mood wasn’t bad enough to say you two were lovers, she thought.</p>
<p>Alexandra’s face looked at ease as if her curiosity had been solved. Then she looked at Angelica and said,</p>
<p>“I just wanted to check if it was something that couldn’t be overlooked. Sorry if I was rude.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. I would do the same thing.”</p>
<p>“Then that day was the first time you met my brother? It wasn’t on purpose?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We met by accident. At that time, I was just taking a stroll in a nearby garden. There were some big trees and the view was nice, so I stayed there, then a random cat came by; a little while later he appeared from the thicket. I, too, was taken aback.”</p>
<p>“Ah-ha… Well, my brother Rael does like to go around by himself. It’s not once or twice that he suddenly appears without warning and surprises people because he goes around like that.”</p>
<p>Alexandra shook her head as if she couldn’t stop him. When Angelica laughed at her action, Alexandra suddenly asked,</p>
<p>“You said that Rael gave you permission to hug Rose?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes… She was whining so much that I worried about what to do, but he told me that it was okay if I wanted to pick her up and hug her.”</p>
<p>“Hmmph… So, he permitted you that easily? He isn’t that kind of person…”</p>
<p>“I was shocked, too. Because I heard he’s really protective of his pet.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm…”</p>
<p>Listening to her story, Alexandra quietly observed her. It looked like she was curious if there was a reason for Rael to have done that. Angelica, who made an awkward face at her deep gaze, suddenly said something she remembered.</p>
<p>“Oh! He probably did it because he knows that I adore cats. I used to own one. He knew that, but I think he thought I was more considerate of cats than others…”</p>
<p>“….my brother knew that you used to have a cat?”</p>
<p>“Huh…? Yes. And what it looked like. Though I don’t know how he knows that…”</p>
<p>“Hmmm… That’s an interesting story.”</p>
<p>Alexandra, who had had a slightly blank look, looked closely at Angelica with a strange look. How can siblings be so alike? Even Lucius had made the same face when Tiana had inquired about the two.</p>
<p>Until now, Angelica had been hardly noticeable, so she was probably thinking about what kind of contact point there was between the two. If Rael knew that Angelica used to have a cat, he must be that much interested in her, but from when had he been interested in her?</p>
<p>“Well, I can ask my brother later. I don’t think he’ll tell me, but if I bug him about it, he will. By the way Angelica.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Alexandra, who had been agonizing for a long time, roughly concluded and called Angelica’s name. Then she said, smiling at her curious stare,</p>
<p>“How was it meeting my brother? From what I’ve heard, he’s curious about you; how about you?”</p>
<p>“Oh…. uh, well… We met very suddenly, and actually I’ve never thought about him until now. It feels like he and I are from different worlds…”</p>
<p>Alexandra nodded after watching her talk awkwardly with her eyebrows narrowed. Well, that was her stance on the situation. Since there weren’t any females who tried to easily approach Rael’s personality or the energy he emitted, to Angelica he might have been a distant person.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s how my brother is. But still, don’t you have a first impression or something? How was it?”</p>
