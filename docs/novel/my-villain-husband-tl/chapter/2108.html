        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“Ma’am, there are more invitations.”</p>
<p>“More? I sure am getting a lot of them.”</p>
<p>Tiana sighed as she looked at all the invitations Warren had brought in. A few days after successfully attending Alexandra’s tea party, the number of invitations from some of the attendees had increased. There were already so many stacked on the desk, so there wasn’t enough room for other documents on top of the never-ending invitations.</p>
<p>“I am glad to be invited, but I can’t even make it to all of them, and… how am I supposed to choose?”</p>
<p>She studied the crests stamped on each family’s invitation. She had received more than she’d originally thought. The families were of course aristocrats, with some being neutralists and some being empiricists.</p>
<p>The neutralist families probably had sent theirs because Tiana had sided with Angelica against those bullies, but she hadn’t expected anything from the empiricist families.</p>
<p>She thought there would be some hostility since she had chased off the Whigette girl, but it didn’t seem so. Should I take this as me making a good impression at the tea party? she thought.</p>
<p>As she was opening each one of the stacked invitations, Warren smiled faintly, looking at the worried look on her face, and said,</p>
<p>“I think it’s because your reputation was so good at the last tea party.”</p>
<p>“I was worried I had looked too nervous, but I guess I was all right. Seeing that all of the invitations are coming in.”</p>
<p>“I heard that Her Royal Highness Alexandra was very satisfied. Though there was a problem that occurred, you did a great job, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that big of a deal, but Alexandra really made me feel better.”</p>
<p>“But isn’t it because you left such a good impression on the others that you’ve received so many invitations like this?”</p>
<p>“Fair point.”</p>
<p>The results in front of her were the undeniable truth. Though it was all because of her impressive behavior, the well-known rumors had still played a part in that. So this is how the works of Marquess Calvino shines. As expected, the answer was to prepare in advance.</p>
<p>This was the result of the original rumors about the ‘old’ Tiana disappearing and rumors about the current Tiana having spread. It wasn’t intentional, but the news of the accident in Sinadelli and what had happened at the tea party have meshed together.</p>
<p>“Next time, how about attending a larger-sized party?”</p>
<p>“I am still trying to go to smaller parties. I just started my social activities, and I have other things to do.”</p>
<p>Warren nodded at her words and asked,</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, did you become acquainted with Viscountess Garnett?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Fortunately, it went well at the tea party, so I’m thinking of inviting Baron Evett June over here soon. I’ll have to be quiet about it since I don’t want everyone to know about it.”</p>
<p>“I will get it prepared.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>After Warren stepped away, Tiana thought things over while going through the invitations again. The pile is thick, but which one should I attend, she thought. Like she had said to Warren, attending a big party seemed like it’d be difficult, so she selected invitations mainly for smaller ones.</p>
<p>Thank goodness she had read the data on the aristocrats she’d received from Lucius a few days ago. There was some information about the aristocrats in Tiana’s memory, but the detailed information had been prepared by him, so it was easy to grasp just by looking at the families’ crests and names.</p>
<p>The families included in the data were almost identical to those who had sent invitations, so they could be chosen without difficulty.</p>
<p>“Huh? This…”</p>
<p>She was looking at the next invitation when she somehow noticed there was a familiar crest stamped on it: A sky-blue lark-shaped one. If her memory was correct, this was from Angelica’s family, the Vernes.</p>
<p>Quickly tearing open the envelope, it was indeed an invitation from Angelica. Written in neat letters, it said that she would like to thank Tiana for what had happened at the tea party and prepare a spot for the reward she had mentioned at the time.</p>
<p><em>I’ve arranged a spot for Grand Duchess Tiana and Empress Alexandra. If you are unable to attend, please just accept my gratitude.</em></p>
<p>Tiana could feel Angelica’s heart from the cleanly written invitation. Receiving an invitation from a party host. How touching.</p>
<p>“Seeing her send me something like this, I guess her family’s new product has launched.”</p>
<p>Tiana had heard that the Vernes’ plans were delayed due to their situation, so she thought that it would be difficult for them to manage, but fortunately, the problem about the new product seemed to have been solved. Then there was no reason not to accept this invitation.</p>
<p>Feeling excited, she pulled out a sheet of paper and started writing her response.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Alexandra, come here.”</p>
<p>Two days later, Alexandra visited Tiana early on the morning of Angelica’s tea party. Entering the living room and taking a seat, she said with a sorrowful face,</p>
<p>“Sorry for coming so early, Tiana. Is Lucius gone?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He had breakfast and left right away. Today he went to Sinadelli.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? The restoration work has been underway since the accident, so I guess he went to inspect it. He must have a lot on his mind since he is in charge of overseeing it.”</p>
<p>“I guess he is making some progress in the restoration. What a coincidence he’s become the one in charge at the location of the accident, but he is working hard because he wants to oversee it until it’s completed.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like him,”</p>
<p>Alexandra said, laughing and nodding, well aware of Lucius’s personality. Sipping a cup of tea brought in by a maid, she quietly started to talk.</p>
<p>“My reason for coming so early is so we can go the Vernes’ mansion together. And I have something to say before we go.”</p>
<p>“Something to say?”</p>
<p>“I’ll say it first, but I guess everyone was impressed by what you did at the tea party last time. Defeating the bully and protecting Angelica.”</p>
<p>“Defeating…?”</p>
<p>It made it sound like Tiana had gotten rid of a villain or something. It was more of just chasing her away, but it was that other girl who had run away. Sighing lightly, Alexandra smirked and continued.</p>
