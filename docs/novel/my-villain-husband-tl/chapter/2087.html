            <p>Angelica said slowly, swallowing once with a face that looked the most nervous she had ever looked.</p>
<p>“Even if we open a tea party at my family’s mansion, many people curious about the rumor will come. Of course, explaining that is also important, but I would like to focus more on resolving misunderstandings about my family’s business and launching our new products.”</p>
<p>“I see. So, what’s on your mind?”</p>
<p>“After we finish explaining this rumor and our business, we’re going to introduce our new products on the spot.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. They consist of tea sets and small dessert saucers. You prepared a tea party, and if you show them on the spot, there would be no need for more promotion.”</p>
<p>“Right, but I think the key is to turn those who come to hear about the rumor into customers. As it is our family product, they will be of some interest, but I don’t think it will lead to them purchasing anything. It won’t be widely promoted. Word will spread here and there, but it will be hard to expect a booming reaction.”</p>
<p>“So, that’s why you need my help?”</p>
<p>Tiana looked into Angelica’s eyes, who was calmly explaining. And she could see the sweat dripping down Angelica’s forehead. After a deep breath, she continued.</p>
<p>“If you attend the tea party, I think I can draw their attention, Your Highness. All you would have to say is that you are looking forward to the new products.”</p>
<p>“Interest in the products will definitely go up. Attention is a bonus. In other words, you’re asking me to be your promoter.”</p>
<p>“…Yes!”</p>
<p>“Hmmmn..”</p>
<p>Tiana thought about it as she watched Angelica’s fidgety hands on her lap. It wasn’t a difficult favor. It was something Tiana could do in her position, and it was within the range she had expected.</p>
<p>Attending a tea party wasn’t that big of a deal and it was not difficult to attend and talk a little about her expectations of the new products. As long as she came out in person, she would be tested for her perspective, but Count Verne’s new product was a design that anyone would be tempted by, so she didn’t worry about it. But she too believed in her perspective.</p>
<p>“I know it’s beyond the subject and a rude request, but I dare to ask you this because of the kindness that you’ve shown me so far, Your Highness. Could you come to my tea party…?”</p>
<p>Tiana could feel the tension rising in Angelica’s voice. Even though she had said it after putting a lot of strength in her neck, she couldn’t hide her trembling fingertips. Tiana couldn’t believe she was this nervous. She hadn’t seemed this way even during her encounter with Rael.</p>
<p>Anyway, our female protagonist had asked earnestly, so Tiana didn’t think she could reject it. Would it be fine since it was a difficult favor? Glancing at Lucius, he too seemed to be thinking the same thing, so the two looked at each other and nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>That was his way of giving her permission to do as she was thinking. In return, she smiled and said to Angelica who was slightly lowering her head,</p>
<p>“Sounds good. I will attend.”</p>
<p>“Huh…? R-really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I will attend the tea party to commemorate the launch of the new products by Count Verne.”</p>
<p>“Oh… Thank— Th-thank you so much…”</p>
<p>Perhaps Angelica was now relieved at her words, she let out a long gust of air as her body slumped in relaxation. Tiana could tell how worried she had been just by her watery eyes and cramped voice.</p>
<p>Still looking down at her shaky hands, she smiled and said,</p>
<p>“Even if you hadn’t asked me, I still wanted to attend the tea party. I was looking forward to the introduction of your new products. But if I do go, I may be a burden to you and your father because Lucius and I are like guarantors of the products.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Don’t worry about that part, your Highness. We will prepare thoroughly so as not to put pressure on you two. Of course, I can say that the completeness of this new product is also the best among all the products released so far.”</p>
<p>“I know that because Alexandra and I were the first to receive them. You can confidently say that the product is good.”</p>
<p>“…thank you.”</p>
<p>A new product had been prepared by the Vernes. Since it was close to perfection, no way it could easily be overlooked. So, Tiana expressed to her to fight through the roadblocks.</p>
<p>Would her words give Angelica strength? It was then that she could see a smile on her face. There was confidence contained in the rising corners of her mouth and her clear sky-blue eyes. Tiana had known that they would form a good bond.</p>
<p>“So, when is the expected date of the tea party?”</p>
<p>“I’m almost done with the preparations, so I’ll have it as soon as possible; within a week.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. Definitely, after this week, the rumors will start spreading again.”</p>
<p>This week was the time when the rumors were the highest, as it was said that Rael would disappear for a few days. Things should be fine after this week if only she had the tea party as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“It has to be within the next week. It would be a good idea to send out as many invitations as you can. With no regard for factions. Meanwhile, I’ll spread the word. If I tell Empress Alexandra, she will gladly help you, so I’m sure many aristocrats will know about the tea party.”</p>
<p>“I would be thankful if you did that for me, but is it okay?”</p>
<p>“Sure, it will be fine. Because actually Empress Alexandra and I were the first ones to like the products. She will definitely be helpful.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’m so glad.”</p>
<p>The two smiled brightly at each other. Then, Tiana’s smile faded, and she said to Angelica, who now looked completely relieved,</p>
<p>“But there is one condition.”</p>
