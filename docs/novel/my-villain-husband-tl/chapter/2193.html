        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><b>Chapter 22 – The Anticipated</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two individual letters were sent to both the Grand Duke and Marquis Calvino’s residences to inform them of the intended visit. Fortunately, a reply shortly arrived; Marquis Calvino didn’t seem to sound eager, but he accepted the invite nonetheless, however reluctantly. They agreed to meet at the Grand Duke’s in two days and it wasn’t long before the anticipated had arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re all ready to go, my lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Inabelle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once her hair was done, Tiana stood up and took the parasol from Inabelle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her half-tied, long hair was still an unfamiliar sight, but upon looking at the mirror, the ornament adorning it caught her eye very well. It was butterfly-shaped, sitting on the locks with ample little flowers in surrounding, looking as if it’d fly away anytime soon. The combination of yellow and blue suited Tiana’s liking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She opened her door, and daintily went to the ground floor where Edwin and Alfred were waiting along with a carriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alfred, who had been busily instructing the other servants at the moment, paused as their eyes met and smiled in greeting. “The carriage is ready, young lady. And oh my…you look extremely beautiful.” He commented with an astonished regard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Alfred.” She gently perked, confidently. “I’m sorry I’m late, father. Did you wait long?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that met her words was shocked silence; an eerie stretch across the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father?” She walked a little hastily towards Edwin. He looked somehow frozen, and she tilted her head in confusion as a response. From behind, a thunderous laugh from Alfred erupted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It must be because the Duke hasn’t seen you like this in a while, my lady. There wasn’t much of a chance to when you fell ill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh…is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana had been bedridden for two weeks. Dressing-up wasn’t largely required in case it stressed her condition, so it definitely had been a long time since. Though, she wasn’t much familiar with the previous Tiana’s habits, and it occurred like a mental breakthrough that encounters like these must’ve been rare, as the woman didn’t even find it necessary to meet Lucius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Tiana was excited. It had been quite some time since she’d gone out in the company of someone else. After enchantedly waking up in her new body, she was appalled at most seeing Edwin the first time around. For her to go out with a ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">father</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ when she formerly had none, was something Tiana and her dreams never even stumbled upon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt beyond blessed, thinking of this man as her father; middle-aged yet dazzling, dressed in a modest and crisp black suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say he was astounded was an understatement. Edwin continued to stare in surprise, and the gaze left her embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, she smiled shyly even as her face reddened from the attention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You look very pretty. I nearly didn’t recognize you— no, you were always pretty. But seeing you now in this splendor, you’ve become beautiful.” Edwin said finally, all with a proud smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, father. You flatter me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, Truly. Especially that hairpiece, it looks dazzling on you, my dear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right? I loved it the moment it captured my eye. Do I look okay?” She asked consciously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes…very pretty.” Edwin responded lovingly, though his gaze seemed slightly sorrowful as it lingered on her butterfly pin. It seemed like he had more to say but defiance triumphed, so he turned away instead, shaking his head lightly. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, father.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Alfred’s assistance, Tiana entered the carriage and sat opposite of Edwin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please, have a safe trip.” Alfred noted before closing the carriage door. The father and daughter soon departed as the servants gave the last of their greetings.</span></p>
