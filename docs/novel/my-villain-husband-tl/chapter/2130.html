            <p><strong>Chapter 85 – For the Children</strong></p>
<p>“With Lucius?”</p>
<p>The unexpected suggestion took her off guard and she stared at Lennox. He nodded and continued.</p>
<p>“I heard that he sorted out everything after the accident. And dad told me that Lord Lucius assigned an additional number of people to restore the scene of the accident. He delivered relief supplies for the children who survived, and sent donations and supplies to the botanical garden and orphanage.”</p>
<p>“Lucius… He did all that?”</p>
<p>She knew that he had sent relief funds to the surviving children, but not about the supplies to the botanical garden and orphanage. <em>Was it because of what I said… </em>Tiana had told Lucius that she wanted to go back there in the future. Was he trying to restore the garden after what she had said? If he was, she didn’t know how she would thank him. He always did things that she could never even think of.</p>
<p>Tiana’s heart filled with overwhelming joy and she sat quietly for a minute till Lennox spoke again.</p>
<p>“I was also shocked when I heard about it, but if he cares that much, I’m positive he will think of additional things to do.”</p>
<p>“Additional things?”</p>
<p>“Like what you said. The part about the surviving children, doing something so that kind of accident never happens again. In fact, there are a lot more children, just like them, in other places too.”</p>
<p>“Right. I know they aren’t the only ones.”</p>
<p>She knew that there were children who were discriminated against based on their nationality and status, and more who died in unfortunate accidents. Tiana wanted to do something for them. It may not be possible to do it for all those children in the world, but it could be if she expanded the horizon step by step. Her idea may end up as a simple relief effort, or it may develop in several ways. Whatever it bloomed into, it would take an enormous amount of money. And if there was one thing she had a lot of, it was money.</p>
<p>“Of course, there may be some societal and technical difficulties in implementing them, and there will be budget problems. But if you discuss those things with Lord Lucius, you can come up with a way to do it.”</p>
<p>“I have a budget, much more than enough,” replied Tiana.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. So that’s not an issue. Thanks, Lenno!” Happy because of the brilliant idea he had given her, she grabbed both of his hands, expressing her gratitude. He stared at her, bewildered and confused as to what she was so happy about, but she didn’t give him much time to think about it. “Thanks to you, I think I’ve found a solution to what I had been thinking about all day. Discussing it with Lucius will certainly be a great idea. Thank you so much.”</p>
<p>Lennox relaxed at her words and smiled softly. “It’s nothing. I’m just glad I could help.”</p>
<p><em>I’ll definitely talk about it with Lucius when he gets here. </em>Tiana sorted out the thoughts in her head, and for the remaining time, drank tea with Lennox.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After Lennox left, around dinner time, Lucius returned. Tiana welcomed him with a hug, which he reciprocated by smiling brightly and hugging her tighter.</p>
<p>“Did something happen? You seem to be in high spirits,” Lucius said.</p>
<p>“Kind of. Oh, Lennox came by earlier. He was worried about what had happened during our trip, so he came to see me,” replied Tiana.</p>
<p>“I see, he must have heard the news from your father. Well, the news did spread all the way to the imperial palace. It may even make its way to the capital.”</p>
<p>“I guess so. It seems inevitable at this point.”</p>
<p>Talking, they went to the dining room. As soon as they were seated, their meal was served.</p>
<p>“Lucius, there is something I want to discuss with you.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” inquired Lucius.</p>
<p>“On another note, I think it’ll be a long story, so can I tell you after we’ve eaten?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Smiling with joy, he burst into a small laugh as he stared at her. While she looked at him strangely, he cut a small piece of meat and held it out to her on a fork.</p>
<p>“You’ve clearly anxious to tell me. Don’t worry, I’ll listen to every single detail, no matter how long it takes. But right now, you should eat. You haven’t taken a single bite.”</p>
<p>“Oh… yeah, I’m eating now.”</p>
<p>“Try this one first. It’s the best part.”</p>
<p>“Thanks…”</p>
<p>Unable to do much under his stare, she took the bite he offered into her mouth and quickly turned her head to the other side, embarrassed as she chewed vigorously. She couldn’t focus much on the taste because she could still feel his eyes on her. Where did he learn that? He kept feeding her and she ate her meal but couldn’t concentrate on it.</p>
<p>After finally finishing dinner, Tiana sat down with him on the living room couch to have their discussion. Warren brought out fresh, cleansing tea for them, and Lucius signaled to him without even lifting a finger. He understood and left the room along with the other servants. Now with only the two of them in the room, they could talk comfortably.</p>
<p>“What do you want to discuss, Tiana?”</p>
<p>“First of all, I’d like to thank you. I heard that you dispatched workers to restore the garden, and also sent relief funds and supplies to the orphanage.”</p>
<p>“I just fulfilled my responsibilities by helping in sorting everything out. The relief funds were delivered for the welfare of the affected people,” said Lucius.</p>
<p>“Did you do all of that because of what I said?” Tiana asked.</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“I said I wanted to go there again.”</p>
<p>“So do I. With you.”</p>
<p>“Lucius…”</p>
<p>Looking at his gentle smile, as if he had done nothing special, warmth spread in her heart. The knowledge of having a man who put her first before anything else, made her incredibly grateful and happy about his deep consideration.</p>
