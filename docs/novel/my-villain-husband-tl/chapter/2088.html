            <p>“My strength?”</p>
<p>When Tiana looked at Angelica, wondering what her words meant, she continued with a slightly nervous face.</p>
<p>“My family wants to celebrate the release of this new product, so we are going to have a tea party. And I plan on addressing the rumors and explaining about our previous products.”</p>
<p>“An explanation for the products you’ve done before… Those are the products which were disturbed by the Whigettes.”</p>
<p>“Yes. So, you knew.”</p>
<p>“I heard about it from Lucius. But how can you explain that? I heard that it couldn’t be revealed that it was the Whigettes’ wrongdoing because there wasn’t any evidence. Did you find any evidence?”</p>
<p>If Angelica can explain that, Count Verne will be able to regain his status. Had she really found a clue to the solution?</p>
<p>After hearing Levisia’s words, she said, nodding with a serious look on her face,</p>
<p>“Yes. We found the artisan that ran off and who was responsible for the products. Based on the testimony, we will find out that he was instigated by Count Whigette.”</p>
<p>“Really? Fortunately, you found a witness”</p>
<p>It had been said that the artisan had gone missing, but fortunately, he had been found. If he becomes a witness, he will not be able to escape from Count Whigette’s side. As she was smiling with joy, Lucius, who had been listening quietly next to them, said,</p>
<p>“…Angelica, how did you find the artisan who had gone missing?”</p>
<p>Somehow, he was looking at Angelica with a suspicious look on his face. At his sharp glare, she nervously opened her mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“Oh, right. The truth is my father inquired here and there about the rumor. He was hidden somewhere much further than father had thought, so it took some time, but you can say that he got caught with his tail sticking out.”</p>
<p>“…I see. Count—”</p>
<p>“Lucius, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Listening to her, he muttered and became lost in thought. Was there something strange about Count Verne going out to find the artisan who had gone missing? His narrowed eyebrows were prominent.</p>
<p>He was seriously thinking about something, so Tiana had called him out of concern, and soon he shook his head and said,</p>
<p>“No. I heard that it’s almost impossible to find missing artisans, but he seems to have done it with no trouble. That’s a relief.”</p>
<p>“…it is, right? Such a relief.”</p>
<p>Tiana smiled back and laughed at him. She thought he had a different question, but he didn’t seem like he would voice it here easily.</p>
<p>Was it because Angelica was here? For now, she decided that she’d ask him when they were alone, then she turned to Angelica.</p>
<p>“It’s good that he found the witness, but will that artisan testify so easily? He was instigated by the Whigettes.”</p>
<p>“Because that person’s lifeline is already in our hands. He already said that he would testify, and just in case he tries to run away we have eyes all over him.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, Father prepared evidence about the corruption that has been committed by the Whigettes which disturbed our business endeavors. If we have that and the witness, I think it will be possible to explain everything.”</p>
<p>“You’ve gathered as much physical evidence as we can. With that, it definitely looks possible.”</p>
<p>Tiana didn’t know in detail, but Count Verne must have gritted his teeth and collected evidence. She hadn’t expected him to collect all of this evidence at once. Proper physical evidence and the new product. With that much, Angelica could explain enough.</p>
<p>Perhaps she too was thinking that since her face was full of confidence. Anyone could tell just by her brightly shining eyes. Because it was much different than the look she had a few days ago.</p>
<p>It seemed she had prepared enough to strike back, but why did she need Tiana’s strength? It would only be the power of her current status.</p>
<p>“It looks like you have prepared enough to some extent, but what do you mean by you need my strength? I think it’s possible with just your father.”</p>
<p>“Oh, uh…”</p>
<p>Tiana and Lucius had their gazes locked on Angelica. In a broad sense, what she really needed was the ‘strength of the grand duchy’. A strength that was possible not through Tiana alone but with Lucius as well. Tiana had been asked a favor, so she would step up, but she needed Lucius’s permission since it was a matter regarding the grand duchy.</p>
<p>He was probably thinking the same thing, as his eyes looking at her were more serious than earlier. No matter how well they thought about this request from the female protagonist, they had to think about it first before accepting it. Because she was the female protagonist and not some random person, they had to be even more careful. Because being close to each other was separate from giving direct help.</p>
