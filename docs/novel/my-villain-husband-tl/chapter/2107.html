            <p>“I didn’t want to get involved with her because I don’t like her, and I left her alone because she’s too much of a hassle. I thought it was a little too much at the tea party, so I was thinking about what to do, and I was grateful that you took over.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t even realize how I just threw myself out there…”</p>
<p>“Either way, it’s done now. What you said to her was quite impressive, and I guess I am not the only one who feels this way. Are you receiving lots of invitations these days?”</p>
<p>“Yes. They’ve been piling up every day.”</p>
<p>“I knew it, just as I expected,”</p>
<p>said Alexandra, nodding positively.</p>
<p>“I guess what happened then has spread. The word spread fast.”</p>
<p>“How did it spread so fast that I’m getting so many invitations? All I did was push that bully away.”</p>
<p>“That’s the important thing. If you think about your current position. It’s like you, the representative of aristocratic women, have killed one of the empiricists.”</p>
<p>“Killed…”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to make it political, but that’s a big point no matter what. As a Grand Duchess in her first return to society, that left a deep impression on the empiricist families.”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that’s what it looked like. It wasn’t that hard to pay attention to Tiana, who was already reputed as the Grand Duchess. Even if she weren’t, she was still in a position that couldn’t help but attract the attention of others.</p>
<p>Tiana didn’t regret anything about wanting to help Angelica, but she was thinking she should have thought a little more about the situation.</p>
<p>“It’s a good thing. From now, you’ll be so busy your head will spin, but you will be able to find a good spot in society.”</p>
<p>“That’d be good if it happens, but I feel a bit odd. Oh, and I’m curious that many invitations came from not only neutralist families but also empiricist families. Why is that? I didn’t think I’d get invitations from them.”</p>
<p>“The Whigettes have been going around a lot. They’ve been recognized for their business, but they are not a very prestigious family and have had problems with that girl’s unusual behavior, so she’s been seen as a pain in the neck.”</p>
<p>“I can see that.”</p>
<p>The empiricist aristocrats can’t be too delightful about what she did. Meanwhile, it’s because of that girl that problems have occurred in the Whigettes’ social activities. Her so-called friends have left her side, and she probably won’t be socially active for a while.”</p>
<p>The bully’s current situation seemed much worse than what Tiana had thought. Well, now it seemed like Tiana knew what she had been doing to Angelica.</p>
<p>She had had it coming to her. At the same time no one had tried to help her, and seeing that they had turned a blind eye to her meant she was being punished for what she’d done.</p>
<p>“And this would be a common thought for all the wives and daughters, regardless of their faction.”</p>
<p>“What would?”</p>
<p>“That you haven’t had much of a center in socializing. As you know, the empress’s throne is empty, and there’s me and the empress dowager, but we are an exception. So we cannot be the center of socializing.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? It’s possible for you.”</p>
<p>It was Alexandra who was actually active and invigorating social activities. She was also leading the trend in many ways because she had a good sense of beauty in her main attributes, clothes, and other places.</p>
<p>However, firmly shaking her head, apparently, she thought otherwise.</p>
<p>“No matter how much I go around doing this and that to my heart’s content, I can’t become the center through that. The same goes for the empress dowager. Because from now I won’t even continue to maintain this position, and I might leave the country.”</p>
<p>“Because you’re getting married?”</p>
<p>“Right. Well, uh, if possible I want to find my soulmate within the kingdom, but if I can’t I’ll try elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“You really must be searching.”</p>
<p>“The world is vast, with lots of men available. I want to find someone I can settle down with. Just like you and my brother.”</p>
<p>“I hope you do. I’ll be cheering.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Alexandra, who smiled pleasantly, blushed. She continued, purposely clearing her throat as if feeling bashful.</p>
<p>Every now and then the empress dowager makes an appearance to socialize, but she feels the same way I do. Without an empress to fill the throne, she’s trying to balance things out, but she can’t be the center because she tends to be a little biased.”</p>
<p>“I’d be the same way. First of all, I was a member of an aristocratic family, and now I’m the wife of Lucius, the representative. And my mother-in-law is the empress dowager. I don’t think I can be the center either, because it’s easy for me to be biased toward that side.”</p>
<p>“You’re different, Tiana. You’re just getting started now, and from now you will change based on the kind of behavior you display, so it’s still possible for you to be in the center. Everyone who attended the last tea party will feel that way. Won’t you be able to integrate everyone?”</p>
<p>“Integrate?”</p>
<p>“The active ones right now want comfortable social activities that they can enjoy. Even though politics cannot completely disappear when socializing, they want it to be neutralized to some extent.  Because dark and heavy moods don’t go well with women’s socializing.”</p>
<p>“That is correct.”</p>
<p>To put it simply, Alexandra’s words meant that the social circle as a whole was standing due to the current imperial power issue, and the complicated factional quarrels were continuing, so Tiana could be the one to neutralize and balance it.</p>
<p>She would do it if she could because it was necessary and she had her position. But was she able to do such an important thing? Soon, Angelica will be recognized as the queen, but did Tiana really have to be the one to stand up?</p>
<p>She had already received the attention, and somehow everyone seemed to be looking forward to it… What should she do?</p>
<p>Seeing Tiana struggling with a frowning face, Alexandra smiled and said,</p>
<p>“Don’t take it too seriously. Think about it; there is still some time.”</p>
<p>“Uh… I will do that. I am a bit worried.”</p>
<p>“Of course you are. It is not an easy task. By chance, if you ever need my help, tell me. Whether it be advice or whatever, I’ll listen.”</p>
<p>“All right. Thank you.”</p>
<p>After their talk finished, Tiana’s throat felt dry, so she called in a maid to have another cup of tea. A while later, Alexandra spoke again as she was drinking warm tea again.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s right. There was something else.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s regarding Angelica, who we’re going to see today.”</p>
<p>“Angelica?”</p>
<p>What about Angelica? Other than at the tea party, they hadn’t had any other point of contact. With Tiana staring at her with curiosity, Alexandra brought it up.</p>
<p>“By chance, Tiana… do you know there’s a rumor going around that Angelica and Emperor Rael are an item?”</p>
<p>“Huh… Wait, what?”</p>
