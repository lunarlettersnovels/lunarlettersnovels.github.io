            <p>Tiana couldn’t find an ounce of dishonesty in her earnest face. If so, then there was nothing about Rael and Angelica’s encounter that would even suggest that they were engaged.</p>
<p>Tiana waited around just in case, but it remained that way. Well, it was also strange that something had progressed in that short period.</p>
<p><em>Was it Tiffany who started the rumor? </em>Tiana wanted to slap her in the back of the head if she ever saw her.</p>
<p>Now that she has futilely confirmed the facts, she felt like she was losing her energy. Looking at Lucius, he looked comfortable as if he had resolved all his curiosities. He smiled back at her when she smiled at him.</p>
<p><em>Oh, there was one more thing –</em></p>
<p>“Then how come you haven’t attended any social gatherings this past week?”</p>
<p>“I have been busy trying to resolve a problem with our soon-to-be-released product.”</p>
<p>“Your father seems to be busy as well; is that also because of the new product?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Father is putting his life and career on the line for this new product. I haven’t had time to go out because I have been helping with his work.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see…”</p>
<p>In the end, it was a business problem. If the launch of the new product restored the count’s trust and the business was likely to regain its position again, he couldn’t help but cling on to it.</p>
<p>The family business was an inevitable part of Angelica’s life. Because working for the survival of the business was more important than going to social gatherings. And of all times it just coincided with the timing of the rumor spreading.</p>
<p>“I knew your situation. I was worried, but now I know it was just because of business.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I unintentionally worried you.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine. But what are you planning to do about the rumor? It’s spreading like wildfire.”</p>
<p>“I have to explain myself. I don’t know who on earth started it, but the truth is I have to correct it.”</p>
<p>Tiana felt worried after seeing her say that with a stern look on her face. It wouldn’t be easy to correct it as it had already spread to all corners of the city.</p>
<p>“I heard that Tiffany Tiban is the one who started it. I think she was the one who saw you that day.”</p>
<p>“If it’s Tiffany, then…”</p>
<p>“You know her, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I know her quite well. Indeed, she was the one who started that rumor about me.”</p>
<p>Angelica’s eyebrows twitched as if she did not like her. Narrowing her eyebrows again, she said after a deep sigh,</p>
<p>“No, rather it may be a good thing that Tifanny witnessed it. I can’t begin to imagine what would happen if it were Whigette.”</p>
<p>“Uhh, I heard that she already knows about the rumor and that she is going around gossiping about you, Angelica. Would she have heard it first since she has a close relationship with Tiffany?”</p>
<p>“That is possible. Anyway… They are people who cannot sit still.”</p>
<p>She nodded with a blank look on her face. Tiana stared at her as she sighed long and deeply one more time. Since she was the center of the rumor, of course, she would get entangled with various people, but why did the others have to talk badly about her? Tiana could feel her distress.</p>
<p>The jaded mood from earlier loosened up as they conversed. After seeing that she hadn’t touched her tea once since they started talking, she told her maid to bring her a fresh pot. When Tiana saw her whispering something, she tilted her head and looked at Angelica.</p>
<p>The maid returned a little later with fresh tea. After she set the teacups on the table Tiana could figure out what Angelica had whispered earlier.</p>
<p>“This… looks similar to the tea set I got last time; by chance is it your new product?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is correct. Since you’re here, I wanted to show you the finished product.”</p>
<p>She nodded with a bashful look on her face. The tea set certainly was unique and pretty. There was black tea in the cup, but even that went very well with everything. As expected, flower tea or black tea went well with this tea set.</p>
<p>When Tiana glanced at Lucius, she could tell that he was surprised by the admiration on his face.</p>
<p>“How is it, Lucius? It’s similar to the present we received last time; isn’t it pretty?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s lovely. It’s worth Count Verne putting his life and career on the line. If it’s released at the right time, I think it will bring a positive response from the buyers.”</p>
<p>“Right? The timing has to be right…”</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be bad timing now that the bad rumors about Angelica are spreading? But it seemed like it would take a long time to explain herself and wait it out until it fizzes away.</p>
<p>As Tiana wondered if there was a good way to resolve it, the hesitant Angelica said to her,</p>
<p>“Hey, if you don’t mind can I borrow your strength, Grand Duchess Your Highness?”</p>
