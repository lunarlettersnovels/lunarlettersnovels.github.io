            <p>The moment Tiana gasped, Rose, who had been in front of her, bolted out from the grass. While debating whether she should follow her, Tiana saw the cat approaching Angelica, and stared quietly while hiding herself in the tall grass.</p>
<p><em>Meow!</em></p>
<p>“Oh my! There is a cat here.” Angelica, who was standing in front of a tree in the middle of the yard, made a welcoming face after discovering the cat. Approaching Rose with no hesitation, she kneeled down and carefully petted her. “Where did you come from? You’re such a pretty cat.”</p>
<p><em>Meow!</em></p>
<p>“Can I touch you? Where is your favorite place?” Rose, sniffing Angelica’s fingertips, accepted her soft hands. Angelica burst into laughter when the cat left her body in her hands as if in a good mood. “Does it feel good? Should I do it some more?”</p>
<p><em>Meow!</em></p>
<p>“All right. You’re telling me not to stop, right?”</p>
<p>While Rose purred and whined, Angelica kept petting her. It seemed normal for her to touch every corner of the cat to see where she liked it. Angelica usually liked animals, and it was said that she raised a cat in the original story. So maybe that was why she looked so normal and comfortable while petting Rose. But wasn’t Rose being a bit too friendly?</p>
<p>Even in the original story, she followed Angelica around often, but now was their first time meeting, and she still acted the same way. Somehow Tiana felt a bit hurt as it seemed like Rose liked Angelica much more. But Tiana let it slide since it was Angelica. Anyhow, Tiana was now seeing Angelica and Rose together. She had never expected this to happen.</p>
<p>Did Rose follow Angelica’s scent all the way here? How amazing that the cat was able to sense her from so far away. But what was the reason for bringing Tiana along? As Tiana was agonizing over that question, Angelica hugged Rose and stood up. When she looked down at the cat held comfortably in her arms, she stroked her head.</p>
<p>“The color of your fur and eyes… They somehow seem a bit familiar. It’s like I’ve heard from somewhere that this kind of cat exists…”</p>
<p>When Angelica muttered that and narrowed her forehead while staring at Rose, she jumped out of her arms. Leaving her behind and scurrying to the thicket, Rose made a louder cry than earlier.</p>
<p>Right then, a man popped out of the grass; a man with black hair and deep red eyes. The familiar figure was Rael.</p>
<p><em>Meow!</em></p>
<p>After Rose welcomed her owner and approached him, Rael lifted her into his arms and stared expressionlessly at Angelica. With her eyes shifting back and forth between the cat and Rael, Angelica was in shock. Rael’s eyebrows flinched as he watched her eyes grow bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Not even Tiana realized that she had her hand over her mouth at the scene unfolding in front of her.</p>
<p><em>Rael has appeared here? </em>Angelica wasn’t the only one surprised at his out-of-the-blue appearance. Tiana was just as shocked as her. The original story hadn’t even started yet, but they’re already meeting like this. What in the world is going to happen now?</p>
<p>Tiana panicked at the confusing situation, but for now, she tried her best to suppress the shriek that was about to come through her lips and carefully kept her eyes on the two people.</p>
<p>An awkward silence fell between Angelica and Rael. And Rose cried out between the two calmly staring at one another.</p>
<p>Rael had no expression on his face, but somehow he was looking at Angelica with a bizarre look in his eyes, and Angelica only stared blankly, too shocked from his appearance to even move. Rose, studying the two not doing anything, jumped out from Rael’s arms and approached Angelica again.</p>
<p><em>Meow!</em></p>
<p>“Oh, uh… Rose, my baby, wait…”</p>
<p>“No, hold on…”</p>
<p>Angelica was embarrassed and didn’t know what to do after watching Rose jump and hang from her leg. Rose’s sharp claws kept hanging from the hem of her dress, and Angelica wondered what to do as she looked down at the cat.</p>
<p>Rael, watching the cat’s behavior, let out a sigh and said to Angelica, “That’s a sign to hug her. She’ll rip your dress if you don’t hug her right now.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but…”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, just hug her. She’s a stubborn one, so she won’t let go until you do it.”</p>
<p>“Okay, thank you…”</p>
<p>“There’s no reason to thank me. That’s just how she is.”</p>
<p>Angelica, nodding at his permission, carefully picked Rose up again. When she saw the cat being timid in her arms, she let out a small laugh.</p>
<p>“So, she’s still following you… “ Rael mumbled to himself after seeing how comfortable Rose was. And perhaps Angelica heard what he said, she gazed at him with a strange look.</p>
<p>“Nothing. I guess you like cats. You look comfortable hugging her.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right. I had one before,” said Angelica.</p>
<p>“Right, that’s right. It was a black cat, completely different from Rose.”</p>
<p>“How do you…”</p>
<p>She was shocked at his unexpected comment. How did he know about the cat that Angelica used to have? Nothing was known about that cat until the two of them confirmed their feelings for each other in the original book.</p>
<p>When Angelica looked at him with suspicion, he grinned and said, “Well, I just happened to know. I know who you are.”</p>
<p>“You know me? How…”</p>
<p>“As the emperor, shouldn’t I know all of the counts’ daughters? You are Angelica del Verne.”</p>
