            <p>How could it be because of her? She stared at him for a few seconds, wondering what that meant, then, Evett carefully opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“Even in an overly-flashy and dull environment, somehow it feels like the atmosphere is neutralizing when I see you. How should I explain this…?”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying she brightens the mood?”</p>
<p>“Right, that’s it. That is right. It feels bright and warm, I mean the energy surrounding you, Grand Duchess Tiana.”</p>
<p>“Oh, is that so? I didn’t even know…”</p>
<p>So to sum it up, Evett feels bright, warm energy from her, is that correct? Tiana was unsure. When viewed objectively, wasn’t it just a calm mood? She didn’t think her presence would give off a bright and warm feeling.</p>
<p>And even though she was present here, she doubted that she had such effect in this huge mansion; this enormous mansion.</p>
<p>As Tiana’s face was stuck in a state of disbelief, Evett, perhaps realizing something, hurriedly rummaged his brain for something to say.</p>
<p>“I apologize. I’ve said some strange words to you, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“No, no. It’s fine. Uh, I’ll just take it as a compliment. It is a compliment, right?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>Tiana cracked a smile after seeing him nod his head firmly. Anyway, it was just a compliment because she looked bright. Should I end it here, since it’s nothing malicious? Tiana thought.</p>
<p>After a short silence, they soon started talking in earnest with the tea served by the maids. She had purposely prepared the flower tea she’d bought in Sinadelli last time, and thankfully Evett’s reaction to it was good, signaling that he liked it.</p>
<p>Seeing him savor the scent while drinking it, she could tell he really liked it. Tiana almost burst out into laughter at how cute he looked with his large frame holding a tiny teacup with steam rising over his face.</p>
<p>After a few sips, she set her teacup down and asked,</p>
<p>“Does it taste right? I’m sure you’re familiar with the flower tea you’ve made, but I was worried in my own way.”</p>
<p>“It is really delicious. I think it’s even better than the way I do mine.”</p>
<p>“No way! Still, I’m nowhere compared to you. Yours was really delicious when I had it at your café last time.”</p>
<p>“This is the flower tea you bought at the time? This isn’t enough, Your Highness. I guess I was so shocked to receive an order from you that I was out of my mind. I wanted to give you and Lord Lucius a gift.”</p>
<p>Tiana shook her head at him, who looked sad, and said,</p>
<p>“No, no. I didn’t want to make you worry that much. Lucius probably just wanted to casually drop by. In that regard, you handled it well. And if the product is this good, it was a good idea for me to buy it in person. Later on, I really want to go and buy it myself again.”</p>
<p>“Thank you…,”</p>
<p>he replied in a sort of gloomy voice while slightly bowing shyly. Garnett, who stood next to him, stared with a pleased face.</p>
<p>They had talked in a comfortable atmosphere for a while, and when it felt stale, Tiana gestured to Warren with her eyes. Having stood there waiting and holding a contract, he approached her and gave it to her.</p>
<p>“I made a contract ahead of time, would you look at it?”</p>
<p>“Uh, before that, there was something else I wanted to ask about.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“So… you’ve decided to invest in me?”</p>
<p>Asking hesitantly, Evett looked at Tiana with shaky eyes. Even Garnett next to him had a curious look on her face. Tiana replied with a smile at the two people who were focused on her.</p>
<p>“I see the possibility. It’d be a waste for me to just let you go. I thought about what it’d be like if I invested in you since you have a high value with your product and I think it’s trendy too.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much for that. But there are so many high-profiting businesses with products like mine; how come you’re starting with mine? And as you know I am a baron. With your investment, Your Highness, my café would welcome people with higher statuses…”</p>
<p>“They’re making enough business profits without me. But you are different, Baron Evett. We can imagine how much your business will expand in the future, depending on how much support I provide. If I invest in something, I want to do it where help is needed.”</p>
<p>Among the count, the marquess, and even the duke, many aristocrats ran a business. But theirs had already expanded to higher levels and brought in profits. If Tiana says she’s investing in their business, she would be welcomed, but that’d be it. Investing alongside such greedy people, she would see a big profit, but that’s not what she wanted. Where’s the fun in just standing motionlessly watching the money flow in?</p>
<p>The purpose of an investment for the common people was to provide relief and cultivate talent, while investment for the aristocrats was to reduce the clunky backlash and narrow the tight class gap between businesses.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be more fun to watch your business grow from the bottom up, instead of watching something that was already a success?</p>
<p>“I was satisfied with the way you ran your business, Baron Evett, and I think it would be perfect to expand your branches.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about the issues related to expanding. I’ve been planning to open my first café since I became independent. But I can’t make up for the expansion expenses with the money I have now. So I searched for several investors, but no one gave me a thing, due to my status.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“In the middle of my wondering about a good way to go about it, I received word about your idea, Your Highness. It was such a ridiculous proposal that I thought it was a dream. But it started to become a reality a few days ago when you reached out to me.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t lying about the contract. Should I show proof so that you can believe me more? I came to do it by meeting various possibilities and conditions I thought of, but in fact, there is one very important reason.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
