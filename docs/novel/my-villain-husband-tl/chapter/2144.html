            <p><strong>Chapter 71 – Married</strong></p>
<p>“Your Excellency, Tiana is ready.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>In the waiting room of the Imperial Palace Cathedral, dressed in a black tuxedo, Edwin stood up at Alfred’s voice. He took a deep breath trying to flush out the nervousness and left the waiting room. Right before the ceremony, the corridor was filled with bustling court servants constantly moving here and there. Meanwhile, the guests entered the main ceremony one by one.</p>
<p>Edwin thought it felt bizarre as he passed by and saw so many people chatting merrily while slowly headed towards their seats. Everyone sincerely congratulated Tiana and Lucius on their wedding and marveled over the beautiful weather. The clear blue sky looked translucent in the bright burning sun. The glistening sun rays made the decorations sparkle. The chirping birds were daintier than usual as if they were celebrating the wedding too.</p>
<p>Edwin arrived at the bride’s waiting room and wiped the sweat off from his palms before knocking on the door. Hesitating and trying his best not to choke up, as Alfred stood waiting behind him, he knocked twice.</p>
<p>Not a moment later, a reply came from inside and he entered the room. Upon seeing Edwin, Alexandra, who was inside the room with Tiana, moved to the other side to reveal Tiana standing behind her with a smile on her face. After taking one glance at her adorned in her sparkling wedding dress, he froze, stunned at the beautiful sight in front of him. Wearing a thin veil over her face, Tiana shyly approached him, flushing under his twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>Wanting to give the father and daughter a minute, Alexandra left the room and closed the door behind her, smiling contently at the first reaction her masterpiece had gotten. The completed dress really was the perfect fit for Tiana.</p>
<p>With only the two of them in the room, an awkward silence fell as they didn’t know what to do or say next. Edwin couldn’t stop himself from getting teary-eyed at the sight of his daughter. Perhaps it was the color of the dress, but her silver eyes looked more intense today. A fondness passed over his face, looking at her clear, brilliant eyes. How could they look so alike? She looked exactly the same as her mother, before she passed away.</p>
<p>“You look beautiful. Your mother… would’ve been ecstatic.”</p>
<p>“Daddy…”</p>
<p>If Tiana’s mother were alive to share this moment, it would’ve been perfect. She would’ve seen her daughter all grown up, met her wonderful husband, and blessed her marriage. Edwin’s heart has been broken with regret over the years, but he couldn’t shed tears on such a good day. He suppressed his overwhelming emotions by clenching his jaw tightly. Tiana too subdued her sadness as she saw the redness in his eyes. She gently grabbed his hands to gain his attention.</p>
<p>“I know we don’t have much time left, but I’ve been wanting to say this.” She beamed up at him. “Thank you for raising me, Daddy. I love you so much.”</p>
<p>The words he had never heard but always wanted to hear, and the words she had always wanted to say but hadn’t quite found the right time. Tears finally fell from his eyes that he couldn’t stop as his daughter gazed at him with deep affection.</p>
<p>Seeing him shed tears for the first time ever, Tiana was quite shocked for a second, but then she carefully embraced him. The warm hug calmed her nervousness and she hoped it would do the same for him.</p>
<p>“Please come visit often. Just because I’m getting married, doesn’t mean I’m not still your daughter. I’ll always be your little girl.”</p>
<p>He nodded at her, his eyes filled with pure love for her.</p>
<p>“And don’t worry about me Daddy, I know I’ll be happy with Lucius. You be happy too.”</p>
<p>It was not that difficult to accept his existence as her father, but on the other hand, the awkwardness didn’t completely go away. However, she knew a lot about him. Her brusque father who rarely, if ever, expressed his feelings. Despite that, he was someone who had kept trying endlessly to narrow the gap between himself and her. Feeling the warmth of his arms, Tiana now felt things weren’t awkward at all. The person, the family who will stand by her side forever. Having accepted it like that, it felt like the stifling feeling disappeared in a snap.</p>
<p>Knock.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, Madame. It’s about time for the ceremony to start.”</p>
<p>They let go of each other at the sound of Alfred’s voice from outside the door and wiped their eyes. Having gained his composure back, Edwin stopped Tiana as she turned to make her way outside.</p>
<p>“I’m proud of you”</p>
<p>Just four words, but they made her heart swell in her chest till it felt like it would burst with love for him.</p>
<p>Walking out of the room holding hands, they headed to the main ceremony, alongside Alfred. Edwin, who met Lucius at the entrance, left Tiana’s hand to him, and entered the ceremony. Lucius grabbed her hand, who couldn’t take her eyes off of Edwin’s back, and looked at her with a soft smile on his face. Tiana also smiled brightly in response.</p>
<p>Soon after, soft music started playing, announcing the start of the ceremony.</p>
