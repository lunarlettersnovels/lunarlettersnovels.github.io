            <p><b>Chapter 31 – Over the Moon</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As their synchronous footsteps became the only sound to be heard in the hallway for quite some time, Lucius, who had been ahead, suddenly stopped. Tiana, while enjoying herself tremendously as she watched the sun shining through the windows, noticed the strange way Lucius paused and looked at her. With a dark expression on his face, he met her eyes. She wondered what changed and thought with little confidence in herself that she did something wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius looked at her with such eyes that can make her heart skip a bit and said in a low voice, “I apologize for bringing you here so suddenly. I wanted to show you around the residence, but… you didn’t like it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? I did. I never said I didn’t like it. What made you think that?” Tiana was quick to correct his observation. She had been enjoying herself immensely; there’s no truth in what he was saying to her right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This whole time you haven’t said a word, so it seems like you are upset at me for forcing you out like this.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never! That’s not true. I was so caught up watching you that I couldn’t say a word. My love, you have no idea how even your backside takes my breath away that I can be lost in my own thoughts just thinking of you.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that she was distracted by the crest on his collar and began to wander with dark thoughts in her head that made her forget her surroundings for a bit. She willed  herself against it though and her thoughts were back with nothing but Lucius in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t drag her out of the house; he is a perfect escort all throughout their pleasant walk, so there’s no way that she could be upset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She shook her head with such insistence that Lucius’ observation of her was wrong.  She even looked intently in his unsure eyes and as frustration engulfed her. She decided that she needed to do something more to convince him. She wouldn’t allow him to think strangely of the way she’s acting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No way, Lucius. Rather, I thank you for being with me.” The thickness of sincerity in her voice is very evident. Lucius must believe him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was honestly surprised and pleased when you said that you’d tour me around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really?”  Lucius felt relieved somehow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course! I was just admiring how the weather seems to be agreeing with our outing today. Look and feel the sunlight, so warm and great.”  Tiana was happy that she could see him believing her. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you, seeing that I must have looked foolish in front of Your Highness. My naive behavior caused you trouble.” Tiana smiled nervously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your apology is unnecessary.” Lucius smiled back. “Now that you mention it, you are right. The weather is splendid today. The sun is marvelous as its ray brings more color in your skin.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius’ desire was to reach out for Tiana’s cheek and feel if the warmth that he felt inside matches the softness of her touch, but instead he contents himself by reaching out to the sunlight beaming through the window. He smiled gently, feeling a warm glow that does not only come from outside but within him as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could someone’s smile be genuinely joyful that it made Tiana’s heart race with happiness that equals his. Her only hope is that the pounding of her heart will not betray her in revealing the feeling of ecstasy that she couldn’t escape from any more. They spent a lot of time together until it’s time to go back home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All smiles on their faces, she committed Lucius twinkling eyes in her memory and decided that time is not to be wasted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That garden I saw earlier was really nice, could you show me around the mansion?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, Tiana. It’s a place we’re going to spend a lot of time together, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will. Thank you, Lucius.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They faced each other briefly, with smiles reaching the very depths of their eyes.  Lucius, then, slowly walked ahead of her again as she followed joyfully.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could drown with such overflowing feeling of euphoria just simply having the idea that they will be living their post wedding life here. Oh, she’s looking forward until such a day comes.</span></p>
