            <p><b>Chapter 25 – </b><b>Curbing the Rumors</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a woman who’s been through a lot, especially facing individuals like yourself. Do you think I’m going to blink at something like this? Never. This is only the beginning, get prepared.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana grinned, and Marquis Calvino’s eyebrows twitched in return. The corners of his lips spasmed, itching to sound something out. However, Tiana was quick to intone. “Thanks to heaven’s blessing, I wasn’t scathed so badly. If you were so worried about me, I think it’s a relief to mention that I was able to keep myself safe. I appreciate the concern, but I’m sorry to bother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was all an attitude, of course. Tiana was kept safe by bestowed luck and familial care. Marquis Calvino’s worries didn’t even bypass.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your concern didn’t serve anything to me at all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She wanted to say, but in the scenario, it was impossible. Instead, Tiana chose to swallow those words all while gently saying: “I’m sure you were drastically worried, and I can’t help but admire  that effort. It must’ve been the unease of thinking the wedlock would halt to continue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the implication wasn’t as obvious at face-value, Marquis seemed to be at high anxiety. His lips were sewn, tightly shut as though he had not expected her spouting answer. Marquis looked at Tiana gently and managed to reply in a barely audible voice. “You seem to be getting better, I was perturbed by the news regarding your memory. You do look nothing like you did before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That must’ve been some incomplete gossip you’ve heard. I’ve indeed lost my memory, but it was only partial; distant like the past. It doesn’t affect anything within my scope now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…That is what you have, contrary to rumors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Such baseless rumor as that is bound to circulate against the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That meant I was quick to believe in gossip?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You immediately accepted the gossip as part of the possibility. I understand having limited time to do anything with late information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our Duke’s territory has not been able to stop the rumors from spreading quickly because of exactly that; the lack of time. I am not hesitant to take responsibility for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is there any other way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, he had changed his posture as though intently listening to the story that was carefully unfolding. Confronted with the sharp look, Tiana turned to give Edwin a slight glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwin nodded in response and smiled softly. She took that as a ticket to talk to Marquis all the same. “I would like to discuss that. There is an existing alternative to safe marriage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alternative? There’s already been a rumor in the general society that this marriage is arduous in truth. Are you implying there’s a way to reverse the situation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Definitely. This misfortune will turn into a blessing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I am all-ears for your alternative then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All throughout the exchange, Tiana exuded confidence the same time Marquis looked to her in interest. It was time to get to the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone’s gaze was focused on her inside the overawe of the drawing room. She initially felt nervous by the surrounding intensity of the stares, but quickly calmed down upon catching Lucius’ undisturbed one; gentle and soothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana straightened her back and slowly began. “If we prioritized to abate this rumor, it may be promising to spread another, more powerful one; deemed to overwhelm the previous. This time of course, it’s credible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the rumor?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana began reading her account as if it had already spread. “Miss Celeste, who had been involved in such a sizable accident, is fortunately, completely fine. Although she had lost a part of her memory, she’s gotten a lot better nonetheless. Even better than before, at most.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you think this will solve the problem? Rumors are nothing but— rumors. Cover them poorly once, and the repercussions will only get bigger. It’s a large price to pay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marquis plastered a suspicious look, disappointment was all that etched his front. It pressed Tiana, who professionally answered with a grin. “I don’t ultimately mean solving the case with baseless rumors, that’d only serve ignorance. I need to create reasons to support the claims, and those can only be constructed by everyone else in here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a direct indication of the circumstances that may be connected to the rumors. If we deliver vivid information, people will have to believe these rumors as nothing but valid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Go on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Tiana explained her proposal in all seriousness, the board grew more attentive by the second. She radiated a smile at Marquis, all while taking a sip of the cold tea situated on the table. It was a bit bland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyebrows furrowed unconsciously at the taste— or lack thereof. Tiana eyed a jar of honey, and tried to reach out. In a sudden, the jar slid towards her for an easy grasp; done by Lucius of all people. It was thoughtful of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, your highness,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…It’s nothing.” He smiled back in gratitude, though shyly. Tiana caught his ears turning red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She carried on pouring some honey into her teacup, stirred the liquor with a fine spoon, and took another sip. This time, it tasted just right. Unbeknownst to them, Edwin and Marquis looked at the pair and their odd trade a tad strangely.</span></p>
