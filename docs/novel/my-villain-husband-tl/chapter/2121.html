            <p>Lucius smiled softly, and said as if he knew what she was thinking, “Got it. Take it slow since there’s nothing to rush about. It will wear you out if you talk about your business too early. I’ll set it aside so that no one knows about it.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Lucius. What are you going to do now that you know everything?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Just keep doing what you’re doing. I’ll help out whenever I can. And it’s not like I’m giving you anything big.”</p>
<p>“It’s big enough…”</p>
<p>“If you feel like it’s a burden, you don’t have to do it. But I believe you’ll be the best.”</p>
<p>Getting up from his seat, Lucius walked over to Tiana and grabbed her hand; she stood up. She leaned against his chest, smiling gently as she gently squeezed her waist.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a little overconfident in me? What if all this blows up in my face?” Tiana asked.</p>
<p>“That is not likely. And so what if you fail? It’s your job, and I’ll just clean it up.”</p>
<p>“Even if it all goes under?”</p>
<p>“Still it won’t be a big blow to the grand duchy. And don’t worry, I can take care of everything from my end.”</p>
<p>Tiana almost laughed at his overconfident smile. Indeed, it was a business founded with money left over after expenses, so if it’s all wasted there wouldn’t be any damage to him nor the grand duchy. Tiana was able to check him and his wealth. He really was the most powerful husband. What happens if she really turns him into a villain?</p>
<p>Tiana left the dining room and went up to the bedroom, imagining that it would be surprisingly fun.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A few days later, she received an invitation to Alexandra’s next tea party: The day after tomorrow at 2 p.m. She had to prepare for it properly as it would be her first social gathering since the wedding. There was plenty of time.</p>
<p>Since she had a lot of dresses made by Alexandra, she could just choose one of them and hopefully some accessories to match it. Tiana called Jane to bring in some dresses and accessories to look at. As she was trying to choose the right ones, Jane carefully said, “Madam. Is there a theme for the empress’s tea party?”</p>
<p>“Well, she said it will be held in a garden since the spring weather is nice.”</p>
<p>“Then how about this dress?” She picked one of the hanging dresses and showed it to Tiana. The bright yellow dress was beautiful with a light purple flower pattern and small jewels. Staring at it calmly, Jane spoke in a voice louder than earlier. “If it’s held in a garden, then that means you won’t have a reason to go indoors, madam. This dress here, I think it’ll be beautiful when the sun hits it. It goes well with your hair color.”</p>
<p>“It’s not too loud?”</p>
<p>“Never. Rather, it’s perfect for the garden tea party because it gives a bright feeling. And I heard that this time the party is planned for you by the empress herself. You’re like the main character, so it’s natural that you shine the most.”</p>
<p>“All right…”</p>
<p>Tiana felt a bit awkward when Jane said that the party was for her. Even though the tea party marked Tiana’s return to society, Alexandra was the host. But even though she tried to reject the invitation, somehow her words were lost at the sight of Jane and the maids who seemed more determined than ever.</p>
<p>It was her first time seeing Jane so active and everyone wanted to dress her, but they seemed to be holding back because there were no proper orders. Tiana eventually nodded as she agonized over their anticipated eyes.</p>
<p>“Good. I’ll wear this dress. Can you choose some accessories that go well with it?”</p>
<p>“Oh… yes, madam! Leave it to me! Bring all the accessories!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lady Jane!”</p>
<p>As soon as Tiana finished talking, Jane smiled and called in the other maids as if they’d been waiting this entire time. The excited maids, moving busily with happy faces, brought out accessories. The way Tiana picked and chose accessories to see which matched with the dress was somehow cute as someone was heard giggling faintly.</p>
<p>“Lady Jane, how about this necklace?”</p>
<p>“That one is too loud. And the stones are too small.”</p>
<p>“Lady Jane, I think these earrings are nice.”</p>
<p>“That color is nice. Set it aside.”</p>
<p>“Lady Jane, look at this ring and this bracelet.”</p>
<p>Looking at the potential items piled up one or two at a time, it seemed like it would take a long time. Tiana could only wear one of each kind of accessory, so was there a point in setting aside so many?</p>
<p>Still, she was a little happy to look at the maids who were seriously engaged. Seeing them work so hard for her, Tiana felt like she’d finally been recognized as a hostess by all of them. They were the most lively faces she had ever seen. Maybe because it was their duty? They were really diligent.</p>
<p>By the time the potential accessories had been selected, Warren had opened the door and entered. Tiana, looking at the butlers following behind him holding all types of boxes, asked, “What is all this?”</p>
<p>“Lord Lucius will tell you about this soon, madam.”</p>
<p>“Lucius? He is here?”</p>
<p>Isn’t it too early to come back home from work? She looked at Warren with a bizarre expression, but he just smiled, not even telling the other butlers to wait.</p>
<p>Not too long after the last person holding a box came, Lucius really did enter the room. Surprised, Tiana approached him, and a bouquet suddenly popped out in front of her.</p>
<p>“Happy birthday, Tiana.”</p>
