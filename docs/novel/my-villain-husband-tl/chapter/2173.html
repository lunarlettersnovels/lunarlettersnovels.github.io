        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><b>Chapter 42 – Unspoken Accident </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandra lowered her head slightly with her eyes still wide opened and said, “You don’t drink coffee?”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? No… not that often. Why do you ask? That, uh… I like black tea more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Liar,” the princess said in a stern voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No… I’m not lying.” Tiana wanted to refute Alexandra’s claim but she couldn’t find the words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unconvinced, Alexandra looked at Tiana and the teacup containing black tea, back and forth several times, until she finally bit her lip.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Did the old Tiana like coffee? Not black tea?’ </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the accident, she had been served nothing but black tea that it never crossed her mind to drink or even request for coffee. If Alexandra gave black tea as a gift, she must have enjoyed drinking it herself. Seeing her bizarre reaction though, Tiana concluded that the princess preferred coffee. At least she learned new knowledge about the old Tiana: she enjoyed drinking coffee.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I’ll keep that in mind.’ </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the steamy tea cooled down, Tiana looked down at the teacup pitifully until Alexandra, when their eyes met, suddenly blurted out:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you feel okay when you wake up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? I just feel normal when I do…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Which do you like better: sandwiches or bagels?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like them both…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you often take walks?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once in the morning, at lunch, and in the evening…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How many sugar cubes do you put in your tea!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just one…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana felt like she was being interrogated profusely with the twenty questions that were being thrown her way rapidly. The more she answered, the more Alexandra’s eyes became watery and red as if she was about to cry, until she finally burst into tears and said, “So heartless… to me… I said I wanted an iced americano… even if I freeze to death…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Um… what?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know I’m talking strangely, but I’ve waited so long. Why just now… Why did you come back so late?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana stared blankly at Alexandra who was now sobbing, torn between the sorrow that she could hear in the princess’ cry and the part when she heard or misheard her say, iced americano and freezing to death. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this world, which is far from being similar to modern times, there are cold drinks or coffee with ice, but there is no such thing as ‘iced americano’. What’s more peculiar is the princess’ knowledge of such drink that only modern people know about? </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait, did the old Tiana use that word? </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana had her suspicions but didn’t really know if there was a possibility that maybe she was not the only one possessed in this story. What if she was the one who didn’t know the original story? She couldn’t believe Alexandra had exposed modern knowledge so carelessly. Even those who didn’t know anything would have suspicions that they were different from modern times, but could they have acted so recklessly? What kind of person would do that? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana’s heart raced; she needed more information. If Alexandra was the one who could give her answers, she would not miss this chance. She has doubts, and with that, she must act with caution but she is sure to seize the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana began to speak in a comforting voice. She must make sure that Alexandra calms down before she continues with the conversation. Also, it was disheartening to watch the princess in so much tears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her Royal Highness…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the princess seemed to be inconsolable, Tiana got up from her seat and approached her carefully. She then pulled out a handkerchief, took a seat next to Alexandra, and wiped her tears away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I… Was I too harsh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In what way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just the way you spoke and… It was strange.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandra was grateful for having her tears wiped away but this made her even cry harder.  Tiana wanted to get closer and even reach out to Alexandra to give her a comforting hug but she couldn’t. All the princess could do was cry. Still, she was determined to continue the conversation as she wiped Alexandra’s tears away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What was it that I said?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The princess was touched by Tiana’s concern; she liked that Tiana seemed to be genuinely perturbed about her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re the same… You told me to get out of here and you said you couldn’t understand why I was here…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…And?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I sat here… drinking the black tea…. and you said you’ve never drunk black tea before, and…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You told me you were dead…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes grew wide. Preposterous! Did the previous Tiana really say such things? It only meant she knew this place was in a novel. In such situation, who could retain their own sanity? Tiana understood that she may have wanted to deny the reality she was caught in, but how could she act so severe towards the characters in the novel?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a myriad of thoughts spiraled in her head, she took a deep breath. The fact that Tiana had been possessed by another person may have been true, but whoever that was, was already gone. Nonetheless, the damage has been done and now she didn’t know what to do to fix the mess it left behind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she was left with no choice but to understand, carry the burdens. But at this point, she was starting to get a little scared of meeting new people… What if she behaved the same way to others besides Alexandra? Thinking of such possibility, she felt a headache coming, but her trail of thoughts were interrupted by a sniffle. She returned to her senses and looked at the princess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t cry. I guess my mind was wandering off for a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard… that you had knocked your head… And I understood that, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My head?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two years ago, your carriage rolled over and you hit your head… That’s what happened.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">An accident two years ago? </span></i></p>
