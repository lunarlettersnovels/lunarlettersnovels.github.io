            <p>Angelica kept her mouth shut, and the Whigette girl said after secretly looking around to see if she felt that the mood of the others watching was not bad, “I heard your new product will be delayed, so I guess you can come to the tea party like this, huh? Oh, did you come here to promote it yourself? How could… You must be having a hard time. Seeing that you can’t even enjoy your time at a tea party.”</p>
<p>Her ability to sneak sarcastic remarks at Angelica’s situation was artful. She was doing that on purpose, right? Everyone at the tea party had their attention on them. She’s saying that because she thinks she can win in this favorable mood.</p>
<p>She spoke softly because all eyes were on her, but in the end, she really meant, y<em>ou should</em> <em>have stayed at home, locked in your room; why did you have to come out here and ruin the mood? </em>Angelica, having heard her speak, stiffened her angry face and balled her fists tightly, but couldn’t say a word.</p>
<p>Even if she were to respond, she was alone, and the two others were backing Whigette. There was nothing she could do since the mood around them had been ruined.</p>
<p>Tiana couldn’t stand the irritation when she saw Angelica, who bit her lip and lowered her head gradually, and the Whigette girl, who was standing triumphantly. She really didn’t like the look of the side character, who would disappear soon. What was she doing to the main character?</p>
<p>Even though she wasn’t in this story, Angelica, the protagonist of the original story, would overcome it well, but Tiana couldn’t bear seeing this happen right in front of her eyes. She turned and headed toward the four of them.</p>
<p>“Tiana?”</p>
<p>Ignoring Alexandra’s call, she walked past the fountain and approached the ones arguing. The Whigette girl and Angelica’s eyes widened as if they were embarrassed by her sudden approach. She smiled slightly at Angelica, who met her eyes, and said to the Whigette girl, “So, are you saying Her Royal Highness sent the wrong person an invite?”</p>
<p>“Huh, what?”</p>
<p>“You spoke as if she really didn’t have to come here. She’s Her Royal Highness’s rightful guest, and it’s up to her to decide if she’s going to attend, so why would you care about that?”</p>
<p>“No, I felt sorry for her for not having a good time after…”</p>
<p>Perhaps bewildered by Tiana’s sudden budding in, the Whigette girl couldn’t finish her sentence. The way she frantically rolled her eyes around with a rigid face made Tiana laugh inside.</p>
<p>“It’s a matter of her personal preference how she wants to enjoy her time. Does she really need to show off that she’s having a good time? As this tea party is held in a garden, she can admire many attractions alone. It seemed to me that she was enjoying this tea party leisurely, looking at the details without showing much emotion.”</p>
<p>Until earlier, Angelica had been interested in the fountain’s small statues. And before that, she had enjoyed the fresh scent and delicious taste of black tea. Seeing that the shattered teacup still had remnants of tea, she must have been sitting by the fountain. Who would pick on someone who was enjoying their time alone?</p>
<p>“And you seem to know enough about the Verne family’s situation, but was that important that you had to bring it up here?”</p>
<p>“I was just worried because I heard her situation was not good…”</p>
<p>“Then shouldn’t we take the time to comfort and welcome the ones who attended the event because of bad circumstances? Angelica did her best to respond to Her Royal Highness’s invitation, but what you did was unnecessary; are you judging her?”</p>
<p>“No, I wasn’t trying to do that. What would I say about that…?”</p>
<p>The Whigette girl, embarrassed by Tiana’s words, hurriedly hung her head. Tiana hadn’t expected the tables to turn like this. The bully searched around for a way to escape, but just like earlier, no one stepped up. A few people here and there avoided her embarrassing eyes or pretended not to know her.</p>
<p>Before long, even the two girls behind her backed away, and as Tiana was now on Angelica’s side, the bully was getting a taste of her own medicine.</p>
<p>Tiana couldn’t believe no one was on the girl’s side. Now she knew why this wasn’t in the original story. Because the Whigette girl was nothing but a boring extra.</p>
<p>In the end, she made a tearful face. As she bowed her head gradually, Tiana said, sucking her teeth, “That’s right. I don’t know if it’s right for you to say that Angelica shouldn’t be here. Did you really have to do that to reveal her situation? Of all places?”</p>
<p>Whigette couldn’t utter a reply.</p>
<p>“Especially since Her Royal Highness had given us this wonderful tea party in her garden, the one who is ruining the mood… looks a little different to me. ”</p>
<p>When cold stares fell on the bully, her head wilted even more. Tiana somehow seemed to have stepped in and defeated a small villain, but she felt much relieved because her frustration had subsided.</p>
<p>She wasn’t actually a villain. Had Tiana left the situation alone, the bully would have eventually disappeared, but she was satisfied that she’d done something for Angelica. Could she get some cool points for this?</p>
<p>Looking over at the Whigette girl again, she had lifted her wilted head and a frozen look was spread all over her face. The way she looked at Tiana with a surprised look was not so bad, and Tiana smiled without realizing it.</p>
