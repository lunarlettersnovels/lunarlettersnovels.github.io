            <p><b>Chapter 13 – Creating a Twist</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could feel everyone watching her. Even if she pretended not to notice, she could feel their eyes settle on every move she made. She thought it was because she was much different from the Tiana they all knew, but it was different. They seemed to be reassuring her, with their almost pitiful expressions, nudging her to be hopeful. Their faces were encouraging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her memories were gone and she was a different person. She had accepted her fate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to what she had read in the novel, Tiana was not a very nice person. She was different now. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘She must have been possessed after the wreck’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is what people thought. There was no other explanation that would fit into the scheme. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no accident in the novel. If Tiana did not have one, then this is not supposed to happen. There must be a mistake somewhere, she thought, patting her greasy head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the marriage is postponed, or the marriage itself goes wrong, it will be quite a problem fitting with the original story. Tiana and Lucius have to get married without any conflict, and a year later, the two main characters will meet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius is a threat to the male protagonist, Rael. Rael was emperor, but he had very little support. Since there was no empress and he had no children from his loins, the imperial power was unstable and wavering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when Lucius got married and established power, it was natural that his strength was concentrated on him. The Duke of Celeste was one of the leading nobles standing against the emperor, making things easy for Lucius. Rael decided to marry to counter Lucius’ growing power. To stabilize his power, he weds Angelica, the heroine. Tiana and Lucius’ marriage provided the cause for the two protagonists to meet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She sighs deeply and feels Inabelle staring at her. She stands at the door and stops to hear anything. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were trying to stop me from meeting him. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she didn’t plan to leave her room and meet him, now would be a great opportunity, but she didn’t think she would see him. They will meet each other someday anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she stared out the window, frustrated, Inabelle called her with intent in her face. She said, stepping a little in front of the stationary door, “Go outside. I think it is right that you meet him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why all of a sudden? You won’t try to stop me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was given an order, so I couldn’t help it earlier. I think you should meet the Grand Duke.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is you who gets married. I know that the butler and the maid are worried, but I think when there is a problem like this one, the parties should meet more in person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was surprised at Inabelle’s unexpected words. She was thinking of her more than she thought. Inabelle glances at the door, “There is a maid outside, but I’ll try to persuade her. I’m sure she will not allow you to meet the Grand Duke like this. But you know your relationship better than anyone else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The relationship between me and the Grand Duke? We are not just engaged?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. You don’t remember now, but… Before the engagement, you were lovers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius and I were lovers? No, Tiana and Lucius? </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the novel, the two were only involved because of the contract arrangement between both families. It turned out that Lucius loved Tiana, but it wasn’t the same for Tiana, because she loved Rael, not Lucius.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, they were lovers? This does not tally with the contents of the novel. What the hell just happened?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You mean me and the Grand Duke were lovers?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, my lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inabelle did not sound as though she was lying. If her words were indeed true, she had to confirm it. To stay idle would be unwise. She passed Inabelle by the door and tried to open it, but it was unbudging. Outside the room, Roena was guarding. Convincing her was not going to be easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she appealed, Roena might grant her access, but there wasn’t enough time. Her eyes dart between the door and the large window and she turns away from the door. The windows are large enough for one or two people. She opens the window and balances on the wide railings. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the door is locked, you can always find a different route.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She sets her feet on the frame of the window while Inabelle stands on the lookout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My lady, be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her room is on the third floor, and there is a terrace next to it. The structure on the wall is wide enough to walk on, so she can safely climb over to the terrace. She carefully climbs away from her room and finds an emergency ladder sitting on a side of the terrace. At the foot of the ladder is a road that leads directly to the garden. She looks up at Inabelle’s astonished face with her eyes slightly leaning out of their sockets. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was I too hasty? If I don’t move fast, Lucius might leave. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had just learned something new about Lucius’ and Tiana’s relationship and she was going to test it. He was her favorite character from the novel, this foreign truth sparked a delight in her heart. If she did not do this now, there would be no other opportunity. Their two families were no ordinary family and the marriage would not be broken so easily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana must have been possessed to pass on an opportunity to marry her best friend and have a blissful life, she thought. Why would anyone not want that? Isn’t it the destiny of a person who has an instinct to create a twist in the story?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing alone at the entrance to the garden, Lucius hesitates. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will I be able to see her shadow on the window again today?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Be careful, my lady!” An urgent voice calls from above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the maid’s gaze, he sees Tiana walking on the railing and passing over to the terrace. Without fear, Tiana climbs down the emergency ladder connected to the balcony. As soon as her feet touch the ground, she runs toward the garden.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did she use the window? She looks like a very skilled thief.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius goes to meet her. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m out, so what now?” She raises her hands in the air in exasperation. She is overwhelmed by the vast garden. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Duke sure has a wonderful garden.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She wipes sweat off her face and takes a deep breath, feeling faint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Goodness!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flowers in full bloom seem to be enjoying the fragrant spring as they move with the breeze. The petals flying in the air captivate her attention. She reaches out and catches one. Under the dazzling sun, the pale yellow petals change their color.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a flower with such petals? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wondered.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Forsythia? No, it was a little rounder and smaller than this. Was there such a flower that changes its color with sunlight?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking around, there were many similar flowers. Forsythia, Rhododendron, Tulip, Dandelion… Red pansy and peony were also there, but she didn’t know the name of this one. However, she was used to the strange yellow shimmering in the sunlight.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where have I seen this color? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It isn’t a common shade, though it is similar to yellow, and when exposed to the sun’s rays, it glimmers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gold…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debris of sunlight passes through the thin petals like a generous sprinkle of gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the thin, gold leaf-like petals, she thought about where she saw this color. The more she looked at it, the more familiar it seemed. The wind came then and blew the petals in her hands, making them swirl all around her. As she stares at the hovering petals, she suddenly hears a man’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tiana.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the flying petals, she sees first his dark hair and eyes as golden as the sun. The gold shines brightly in the sunlight. They were eyes like a lake of melted gold, deep as if without impurities. She began to feel a warmth creep up within her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minute her eyes lock with those familiar eyes, she can tell just who it is. </span></p>
