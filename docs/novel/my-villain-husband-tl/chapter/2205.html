            <p><b>Chapter 10 – A Blessing in Disguise</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius’s gaze made him thirsty, but Edwin could not think of reaching for a cup. He knew who he was referring to. He swallowed saliva thinking about it. He had thought that he might bring him up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Marquis Calvino, his maternal grandfather and head of the aristocracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they were of the same aristocratic group, Marquis Calvino was the head of the hard-liners, and Edwin, the head of the moderate. They have confronted each other since the days when the current emperor was a prince. The marquis would never hesitate to use any means as long as he got the result he desired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between the two was not good, it was obvious. If Edwin, who hates conflict, hadn’t intervened, it would have been a mess already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This marriage had been Marquis Calvino’s method to repair the rift, and take control. The marquis, who was usually keeping an eye on Edwin, saw him moving back and forth between the emperor and Lucius and decided to make the first move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the marriage between the two families became known, the goal was already half achieved. Edwin, noticing the marquis’ intentions, could not easily refuse the marriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he had refused the marriage, Emperor Rael would have been pressured by the marquis. It was a difficult task for Rael, who was still weak, to handle the marquis alone. He would rather be a shield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could he have known an accident would happen and take away Tiana’s memories? He had never thought things would get this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius was not convinced of Edwin’s decision to delay the wedding. If he tried to postpone the wedding, Marquis Calvino wouldn’t stand still. He would be pressured, so he had to close the deal on the marriage as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even then, Edwin did not care about the marquis. For him, Tiana’s comfort came first. It was possible that her condition would deteriorate after the wedding. For this reason, Tiana’s recovery was necessary to prevent any problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of silence between the two, Lucius speaks when he sees Edwin’s dark face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand. Duke Celeste. First of all, I will inform my grandfather about the news of her accident. I think it will be good to make clear the facts. And I will share your opinions with him as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised, Edwin hurriedly raises his head. Lucius gets up from his seat and says to a nervous Edwin, “We cannot overlook what you have said, especially since we are looking towards marriage without any problems. I can’t predict the outcome, but I will pass on your opinion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He waves a hand in the air, “After that, you must solve this problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, Your Grace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had thought he would say it was impossible, but he had accepted the delay of the wedding and promised to deliver it to the marquis as well. He was surprised and happy. This was for him a big win. He had almost given up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wish for her quick recovery. I will get back to you soon.” Lucius shakes his head at Edwin who is trying to follow him outside the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alfred, who had been tense during the conversation lets out a sigh and Edwin sinks heavily into a chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you alright, Your Grace?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m alright. I can take all the responsibility. Didn’t you feel it too? That I can’t send that child, Tiana, like this now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, but as His Grace has said, Marquis Calvino will not accept this easily.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, but I had to try my best.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t know what Lucius had been thinking when he decided to take his side, but anyway, he had a reason to do business with the marquis now. That alone was enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwin looks at the cold tea on the table and pours himself a cup. After taking a sip, he places the cup down and asks, “How is Tiana’s condition these days?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From observance, she is doing much better than she was before the accident.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before she lost her memory?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, how about the Tiana two years ago?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Different than she was a child?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She is now as she was when she was a child.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so?” Slowly reaching out and drinking a sip of fresh tea, he closes his eyes for a moment. “She might have… come back to normal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two accidents inflicted pain toward Tiana. The first accident two years ago brought misfortune to the duke, but this accident might be different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This accident must be a miracle.</span></p>
