            <p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>At the sudden celebration, Tiana didn’t realize she was blankly staring at Lucius. Birthday? Her birthday had passed a long time ago. <em>Don’t tell me he is celebrating now. Then all of these boxes are presents</em>, she thought. The celebration was sudden, but why were there so many boxes that looked like presents? After receiving a bouquet, she searched for an answer to all this.</p>
<p>“Are you celebrating my birthday?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m really late, but I really wanted to celebrate it. I’ve planned a celebration for your birthday and your return to society.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I am truly happy, but I’m not sure what to do since I didn’t expect all this. Then all of these boxes are…”</p>
<p>“Yes, they are presents.”</p>
<p>All of them? At least twenty butlers were standing in a row on either side. A total of twenty-two to be exact. Then that meant there were twenty-two boxes.</p>
<p>“You said these are all presents, but why are there so many?” asked Tiana.</p>
<p>“Uh… I wanted to celebrate all of your birthdays that have passed up until this year.”</p>
<p>“All of my birthdays? Up until this year?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“So you bought twenty-two presents? That must have cost a lot of money…”</p>
<p>“For you, this is nothing.” Lucius smiled shyly but happily, blushing his cheeks and blinking his honey-like golden eyes.</p>
<p><em>Here is an angel of the world. Everything that he does is amazing. I can’t believe he is such a nice husband. How is that smile shady? Writer, what have you done to my good husband? How dare you turn a man like him into a villain? </em>For the first time in a while, a grudge against the writer of the original story broiled within her. Tiana wanted to grab whoever they were by the collar.</p>
<p>Tiana was happy about the presents, but she really loved the bouquet that Lucius had given her. It was very remarkable to see roses of various colors blooming beautifully in one bouquet. More than anything, she especially loved that the entire room was filled with the scent from them. The flowers somehow looked familiar.</p>
<p>“These flowers are beautiful. And the scent is deep. But they look a little familiar…” she said.</p>
<p>“You’re right. Those are the flowers the kids were selling.”</p>
<p>“What?! Really? But how…? I thought the fire in the garden burned the rest of the flowers…”</p>
<p>“I guess there were a few left in the greenhouse. I went back there after hearing the news that all of the kids had recovered and gone back to work; the little girl made these herself. She said she grew them. Not her brother…”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much. I don’t know if I can accept them like this.”</p>
<p>“She told me that she isn’t as good as her brother, but she wanted to give you something that she grew. I took them because I wanted to deliver them to you.”</p>
<p>“These are pretty enough. I’ll send her a gift later on.”</p>
<p>“She will be really happy…”</p>
<p>Tiana smiled at Lucius who was smiling brightly at her and slightly buried her face in the bouquet. The rich scent of the flowers rose to her nose. Their overall scent was lighter and slightly different than the small bouquet Tiana had received the other day, but she somehow liked them more.</p>
<p>Though it was a shame that there weren’t any blue roses, the one that the young girl’s brother had grown. Tiana hoped one day that she would be able to see it.</p>
<p>After spending a few minutes admiring the flowers, she was shocked to see the butlers still standing, waiting. Curious as to why they were still standing, she wondered if she should tell them to put the boxes down.</p>
<p>“Put the boxes over on that table.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>
<p>At Tiana’s words, all of the butlers put the boxes on the table one by one. Looking at the tower of presents, Tiana, curious about the contents, asked Lucius, “What on earth did you buy for me?”</p>
<p>“Take a look for yourself.” He, who grabbed her hand, pulled her over to the table. The butlers who had put all the boxes down stepped aside, and Warren, who approached, opened all the boxes with the butlers after receiving a glance from Lucius.</p>
<p>The shocked maids babbled amongst one another as they too crowded around. The items in the boxes were all beautiful, shiny accessories: necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets, etc. Everyone’s eyes were wide open at the dazzling jewels. How much did it all cost?</p>
<p>How could Lucius have bought all of these all at once? Tiana’s jaw remained dropped. As she stared at Lucius, shocked, he was looking at her triumphantly.</p>
<p>“These all fit you so well, Tiana. I only chose a few for now; they all look okay?”</p>
<p>“Of course they are all beautiful, but it’s way too much, Lucius.”</p>
<p>“You think so? Alexandra said that she has this much. I thought it might not be enough, so she told me to buy some more. Should I cancel the order?”</p>
<p>“There’s… more?”</p>
<p>This wasn’t all of it? Tiana stared at him, surprised that more presents were coming, but she was speechless as Lucius had a look on his face like he didn’t know what to do. It seemed that he had gotten more advice from Alexandra; Tiana couldn’t believe he had done this much shopping.</p>
<p>How was she supposed to accept all of this? She was frugal enough that she didn’t have many accessories of her own. But still, for the daughter of a duke it wasn’t that much; was this Lucius’ way of making her realize that? How much did Alexandra have to say that this was not enough?</p>
<p>Tiana thought it over, but no matter how much Lucius said these were gifts, she felt sorry for him, but when she tried to tell him to cancel the rest, Jane carefully stepped forward and said, “Well, with all due respect, the little accessories you have now are old, madam. So we need to place an additional order in addition to what Lord Lucius has bought.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Am I lacking that much?”</p>
