            <p><strong>Chapter 51 – Roses with a Hint of Lavender</strong></p>
<p>“You look like you can do a good job drying me off.” Lucius said, quietly staring as Tiana handed him the towel. When she looked embarrassed by the sudden remark, he blushed and turned his head away.</p>
<p>“I apologize. It was a joke.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>Tiana was surprised by Lucius’ behaviour. She felt as though her heart was going to burst out of her chest. Did he know how to tell jokes like that? Who taught him how to tell such jokes? Alexandra?</p>
<p>She laughed at how cute he looked with his head hanging down and his ears a delicate shade of red. She wondered who she was going to deal with in the future, if this is who she responded to a simple joke.</p>
<p>She wanted to get married and live happily ever after. Was that possible? Seeing his still flustered face, she pushed that thought to the back of her mind and nodded to the towel in his hand.</p>
<p>“Come on, dry your hair off. You’ll catch a cold otherwise.”</p>
<p>Lucius dried his hair with slightly trembling hands.</p>
<p>Looking at how slowly dried his hair, Tiana’s urges to take over grew stronger. At the rate his hands were moving, his hair would never be dry.</p>
<p>Tiana approached Lucius, and gently took the towel away.</p>
<p>“Tiana?” Lucius looked down at her, confused.</p>
<p>“Take a seat.” Tiana stood behind a chair. “It won’t dry if you do it like that.”</p>
<p>Taken aback, he flinched and stepped back, but she cupped his face and wrapped the towel around his head so he couldn’t run away. As her hand swept through his hair, each lock caressed her fingers. Tiana began carefully rubbing his hair, marvelling at the scent that wafted up towards her nostrils.</p>
<p>“Your hair is quite soft. Better than mine… I’m jealous.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not.” Lucius gently grabbed the tip of Tiana’s hair. “Your hair is much more beautiful… It’s better.”</p>
<p>Tiana looked into his eyes as he smiled gently, embarrassment reddening her cheeks. She averted her gaze and fixed her eyes on Lucius’ head instead.</p>
<p>Its fragrance came up and tickled the tip of her nose. The light smell of flowers along with the refreshing feeling made her feel like her clouded mind was becoming clear. She draped the towel around his shoulders and began combing her fingers through the black strands. Lucius took good care of his hair, that was for certain.</p>
<p>“What products do you use? It smells like…” Tiana gave her hand a quick sniff, “Roses with a hint of lavender.”</p>
<p>“I am not sure.” Lucius reached out to run a hand lightly through her hair. “Why, do you wish for your hair to smell the same?” He hesitated for a moment, a faint blush tainting his ears. “After we get married… Your hair will smell the same way.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Same… W-w-we’ll use the same one.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Lucius’ pupils mirrored an embarrassed Tiana. Somehow, she was suffocated by the appearance of his deep golden eyes that held a calm heat, much different than earlier.</p>
<p>Fazed, Tiana’s hands unconsciously froze, dropping the towel on the floor. She gasped; she felt as though she was running out of breath, but Lucius wouldn’t let go of her. His quiet breathing touched her neck, and suddenly, she felt something strange ignite within her body.</p>
<p>The way he looked at her from a distance—the tip of their noses almost brushing against each other—felt different from before. He was no longer timid. If back then he had been an innocent sheep, now he felt like one who has been completely sheared.</p>
<p>Realizing she had been staring at Lucius’ mesmerizing orbs all this time, Tiana turned her gaze and cleared her throat. “Oh… Is that so? They make it for ladies, too, so I don’t think we’ll use the same kind.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>It was not common for men and women to share the same products. Those for men tended to have a stronger scent of herbs and spices, whilst those for women were softer and more floral. She couldn’t help but wonder if Lucius was, in fact, using something designed for women.</p>
<p>Perhaps he hadn’t thought that far as his face showed slight disappointment when he heard her words.</p>
