            <p><b>Chapter 23 – Unfortunate Soul</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thick and saturnine silence enveloped the carriage while Tiana sat confused. It had been 10 minutes since the departure, yet not a single word has been uttered all throughout. At the moment, she could only wish for even the slightest bit of experience with talking to a father. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of conversations did daughters normally have with their fathers anyway? She could ask if he had eaten, but they did exactly that together this morning. She could comment on the weather, but it was clearly a beautiful, bright day with not a single, gloomy cloud in sight; that would seem insincere. Tiana ached for a casual conversation, but had absolutely no idea on how and where to start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uncomfortable silence persisted, and just as she was about to open her mouth in an attempt to break the stillness, the carriage suddenly came to a halt, disorienting the pair for a second or two. Edwin, who had been looking at Tiana, instantly turned his gaze to the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the coachmen approached them, quickly rushing over. Edwin opened the window and asked, utterly vexed. “What’s going on?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The road ahead is blocked, sir. An accident seemed to have happened in the area. The man replied cautiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An accident?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. A carriage had overturned trying to avoid a commoner girl, but she took the wrong step and fell into the river…unfortunately, she passed on immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana swiveled to face her own window in an instant, curiosity looming over her entirety upon hearing the news. A crowd could be seen gathered on the bridge above the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a glance, she could tell the bridge had been too narrow for the girl to have gotten out of, resulting in her demise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current does not look to be strong, but there are many large rocks…it’s very untimely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I agree. Was the girl very young?” Edwin questioned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. I didn’t see the corpse up-close, but she looked to have a small build. I could guess the girl was no more than 10 years old.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, dear. She was just a child.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in this world accidents were unavoidable. It wasn’t a far cry from the modern car accident, for the forlorn remained, seeing as the victim was very young.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you alright?” Edwin asked with sympathy as Tiana couldn’t take her gape away from the bridge. She replied with a reaffirming nod, daintily smiling. “Is it impossible to pass through?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are clearing away the broken parts disassembled from the carriage, so it will probably take some time, my lady. At the moment, some are trying to deal with the victims.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwin grew astute and said. “The 2nd Police Department should be in charge of this area. Proceed to the magistrate immediately and relay the news. Tell them not to deal with this situation sloppily just because it is a commoner’s life at hand.” He instructed sharply. “Did the people inside the carriage pass as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, sir. Only boxes of heavy items occupied the carriage. But the coachman was woefully crushed underneath.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see.” He said, thoughtful and solemn. “Inform them to raise a report on the deceased child and coachman. If both or any of the two had a family, quickly delineate to them the same way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coachman hurriedly walked towards the frontline after receiving his detailed order. All the while, Tiana directed her stare back to Edwin intently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a strict note, Edwin did not have to take on the responsibility for this accident. Granted it was unfortunate, but wholly unforeseen still; she had thought praying for them was the best honor she could give. But seeing how Edwin had cared for the scenario and its casualties, she couldn’t help but be stunned at this unexpected side to him. Edwin may have done so in the pursuit of giving justice to the cmmoners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana admired him for this unwarranted supervision. He looked to be willing to pay for the damages, as well as provide compensations to the ill-fated families in connection to the deaths.  He may be what they call a Noblesse Oblige.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep in thought, she thinks that it’s likely not the first time Edwin handled things this way. Even their own coachman seemed accustomed to taking care of things out of their instantaneous authority. He was a one sophisticated father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfamiliar with his daughter’s look of esteem, Edwin looked away, while Tiana swallowed down words harder to express than they are said. Recognizing how his ears turned red in embarrassment, she failed to hold back a faint grin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He coughed in response. “We might take a little while longer, but I suppose it’s best to take another route. This isn’t a problem as we are still good on time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, okay.” She replied in agreement, nodding along. Edwin commanded another  one of their coachmen to start the tread on, and they were off abruptly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group changed their direction, going through a side road; where for a long time, Tiana affixed her eyes at the dreary bridge and the water beneath as they passed through densely growing trees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could see the lifeless little girl’s body being lifted and moved between the structure and the people huddling around the river. In a final glimpse, she caught sight of small, shoe-cladded feet peeking through the yellow cloth used to cover the cold corpse.</span></p>
