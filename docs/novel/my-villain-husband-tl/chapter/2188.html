            <p><b>Chapter 27 – Resolution (II)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listening to your suggestion, it doesn’t exactly sound bad. In fact, it’s very good. If the young lady ought to stay in the city, the Duke will exceptionally feel relieved, and it’ll be easier to receive news then. His highness will also find it convenient.” Marquis announced. “I believe this is a good way to solve the problem. I am fully onboard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana beamed, “Thank you for your generous support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But if that’s the case, then you surely will have a lot of things on your plate, Miss. I am worried that it may put you under immense pressure. Especially with social activities…there are many things you will need to beware of.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my, please don’t worry about me. I have his highness by my side, the support of my father, and you, so I have nothing to be afraid of. In fact, after losing my memory, I feel refreshed and ready to take on anything.” She replied confidently, in a glow that was as fresh as her declaration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marquis looked on with barely-hidden bewilderment. “If so, then that’s a relief.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since everyone else is expected to support me, all I have to do is work hard. Please, don’t worry. It is my duty to prove how perfectly I can carry out the role as lady of the house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And I look forward to it.” Marquis nodded indifferently, smiling softly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the conversation approached the inevitable end, Marquis Calvino melted into his chair gradually, visibly relaxed. “Let’s proceed with the date we had set on before. If there are any costs incurred for the preparation of the wedding, we shall pay. All you need to do is take care of your health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am aware that this is a wedding confined to happen once in a lifetime, therefore, I will pay special attention to make sure it’s a great one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for your consideration, Marquis. We too will do our part with immense responsibility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As both sides resolved in agreement, the atmosphere lightened down into a more slackened feel. Meticulous event-planning is all that’s left, treading on to continue with the fixed date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delighted with overcoming her largest hurdle yet, Tiana sipped her tea happily. Her schedule afterwards would be hectic; with the wedding preparations and everything in between. But for now, she had convinced Marquis, and that was one victory reserved for today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t help but feel smug for rushing-up things to meet the original date as mentioned in the story. Tiana felt an extreme sense of glee envisioning herself and Lucius sauntering down the aisle. She was proud of herself for finding a husband here once and for all. Especially so as she couldn’t find one in the real world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marquis Calvino glanced her way as she continued to indulge on the freshly-brewed tea. “I am excited for your wedding dress. I’m sure it’ll serve beauty and elegance as expected. Don’t you agree, Duke?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I am sure. I too am looking forward to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you inquired about the designs for the dress yet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have done that a long time ago. In fact, there is a list brought by the salon.” Edwin relayed proudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, is that so? I hope the day comes sooner.” Marquis lightly grinned, in a way that was quite difficult to tell whether genuine or pretentious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was surprised at the fact that there existed lists of designs from previous enquiries, which meant she only needed to choose amongst them. As expected of a noble family’s daughter, they hand-picked and ordered the dresses themselves. Not that she was complaining.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait a second, if I’m having my dress made, will Lucius also have his suit the same way? My dress is of importance, but so is Lucius’s suit. Seeing my husband in a snappy suit will be the perfect finale for such an astounding wedding. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana thought with her heart throbbing in admiration, picturing</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius in a well-made suit. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband in a tuxedo. I don’t think I’ll have any regrets dying upon seeing him in it…But now that we’re about to wed, I don’t want to die at all. This will definitely be a happily, ever after.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of positive thoughts ran through her head like a carriage race. In this light, Tiana couldn’t help but look at Lucius, demurely smiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smile only known to the two of them, but alighting enough to melt her heart. Tiana fell dazed, gazing at him in fascination. He continued to stare back just as intently, golden eyes shining brightly like a carefully-kept heirloom. It only served to enclasp Tiana, absorbing her into the wonderful feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius spoke suddenly, interrupting her thoughts. “I shall escort the lady around the mansion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana looked at him, astonished by this offer. Marquis nodded his head in approval. “Alright. I guess it’ll be appropriate for both of you to have a look around all before the wedding day. Please, spend some time alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have a look around, Tiana. And I shall be leaving her in your care, your highness.” Edwin said, agreeing. She was thankful that the men were letting her follow along, but wondered why it was done so abruptly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana did initially want to look around the manor herself, as she didn’t think Lucius would recommend so. She couldn’t help feeling floored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius got up from his seat, walking towards the door, a butler in waiting immediately welcomed the action. He turned to look at Tiana before leaving the room with what seemed to be a familiar gaze. She understood the signal and followed him out briskly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a last glance to the drawing-room behind her, Tiana sensed a lurking strangeness in the ambiance between Edwin Celeste and Marquis Calvino.</span></p>
