            <p>“That I seriously love the flower tea you’ve developed. I’m not lying when I say I drink about three cups a day. Everyone here knows. How much I love this flower tea.”</p>
<p>Upon Evett turning to Warren and the maids, they were nodding diligently as if her words were correct. This really was the truth. Because these days she drank only tea after breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Not much of the tea Tiana had bought was left because of this.</p>
<p>She hoped to get things started quickly. If a branch in the capital were built first, she would go on the grand opening day and buy a whole batch.</p>
<p>When she proudly held up her teacup and spoke, Evett burst into laughter as he looked at her with a puzzled face. And he said, smiling as if he knew her words were true,</p>
<p>“Okay. I believe you, Your Highness. Now that you’ve said it like that. Actually, I really wanted to know the reason for your investment. I apologize for changing the subject so abruptly.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay. It is natural for you to be curious. Because you definitely have to know the reason for you to feel more comfortable about this.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your consideration.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. Then shall we proceed with the contract?”</p>
<p>Thanks to Evett’s now solved curiosity, the contract viewing went well without any problems. Evett, who looked over it meticulously, asked with a bizarre look,</p>
<p>“So you’re using an alias. T&amp;L Co., that’s an unusual name.”</p>
<p>“Yes, because some annoying problems may occur if I use my real name. I’ll use this alias for the time being. I tried to be unique about it, but is it weird?”</p>
<p>“Never. It is an unusual name, but the nuance is good. It’s like an exotic name not seen in the empire; I think it’ll make for a good protector.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, you’re right. People may think that it’s not owned by anyone here. It would be better to hide that identity.”</p>
<p>Tiana wasn’t sure if anyone else’s business in the empire went by such a name, but she was certain that it wasn’t a common name in this empire. Thinking about it now, she might not reveal herself for a while.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that the investment for branch expansion will be fully supported, with the stake being 40% and the profit distribution being 8:2 per branch?”</p>
<p>“That is correct.”</p>
<p>“With all due respect, I wonder if it’s too much for me. You actually pay all the money after that, but there won’t be much left for you to take, Your Highness”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then what is a plausible amount?”</p>
<p>“50% stake, and a profit distribution of 7:3.”</p>
<p>“Hmmmm… I’ll settle for a 45% stake with a profit distribution of 8:2. Instead, I will not touch management rights. Please treat me well as this is my first investment. I am investing in my own way, so please don’t worry and accept it.”</p>
<p>Evett thought about it for a moment, then he nodded and said,</p>
<p>“Okay. I’m sorry that I feel like I’m only receiving too much.”</p>
<p>“There is nothing to be sorry for. I’m doing it because I want to do it for you. Oh, if I were to add a condition, I hope the first branch will be in the capital. That way I can go as the first customer to buy all the tea that I want.”</p>
<p>“Haha. Okay, Your Highness. I’ll see that the first name on the customer guest list is yours.”</p>
<p>“That would be splendid.”</p>
<p>Tiana smiled in response to him smiling pleasantly. After completing the contract, they spent the rest of the time talking leisurely. He, drinking the new tea that Tiana had bought, looked down at the teacup and asked,</p>
<p>“This teacup, it’s very pretty. It’s unique, but it has a strange charm that catches the eye.”</p>
<p>“I know, right? This is my favorite teacup set.”</p>
<p>“By chance could you let me know where it is from, Your Highness?”</p>
<p>“It’s made by the Vernes family. I received it as a gift from Angelica Vernes; she said it will be launching soon, so you can buy it when it comes out.”</p>
<p>“I see. Are these bowls also from the Vernes?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The other day, Tiana had received teacups and bowls from Angelica, who had sent them because she thought they would go well with flower tea. They certainly were pretty enough to catch anyone’s eye. Tiana was a bit proud that they had been a good choice.</p>
<p>Looking closely at the teacups and bowls, Evett continued to speak with admiration.</p>
<p>“These are really elaborate and meticulous works of art. Yet, still able to function as they’re supposed to. The teacups especially go well with flower tea.”</p>
<p>“I know, right? They are also good for black tea, but they feel more appropriate when I drink flower tea. I think it’s because they are a little different from other teacups, in terms of design.”</p>
<p>“…I think it’d be nice if I could use these teacups and bowls in my café.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, that’s a good idea.”</p>
<p>Tiana nodded at the words Evett blurted out. It definitely would be nice if he could use them at his café. Especially, he thought they would go well with the atmosphere there.</p>
<p>“You said that these will be launching soon? What if we could buy them in bulk on the grand opening of the first branch?”</p>
<p>“If you want, I can contact Angelica Vernes. We’d better make a reservation for bulk purchases.”</p>
<p>“I’d appreciate it if you’d do that. Please let me know when you do, Your Highness. I want to visit the Verne estate in person and express my gratitude.”</p>
<p>“I sure will.”</p>
<p>Tiana nodded at Evett, who desperately asked for the favor. He seemed to really like the Vernes’ products. How good Tiana must have felt that she’d gotten another chance to contact Angelica again. It felt good that she would be able to help her again.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, Angelica Vernes…”</p>
<p>Viscountess Garnett, who, sitting next to Evett, also admired the teacup, carefully brought something up.</p>
<p>“Isn’t she the one who’s in a relationship with Emperor Rael?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Really?”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>Evett stared at her in total shock. So, the viscountess had heard the rumor, too. It definitely must be going around quickly. Sighing inside, Tiana was going to say something in response, but the viscountess soon dropped another bomb.</p>
<p>“They even said that they’re getting engaged soon.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>Wait, getting engaged!?</p>
