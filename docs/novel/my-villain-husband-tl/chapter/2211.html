            <p><b>Chapter 4 – Reborn</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, uh…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wants to ask the thrilled housekeeper what was going on, but feeling a little strange about it, she dismisses the idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, she realizes they have been speaking Korean which would mean she was not in a foreign country. The first maids eyes were, however green, a strange eye color for a Korean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m so glad you are awake, Lady Tiana.” The first maid thrilled and excited grabs her hand tenderly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is shocked by the sudden contact, “Who?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did my owner already give me a name? Or is that his dead daughter’s name? Wait… She just said she is glad I am awake as if I have been gone for a while. What kind of household is this?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She opens her mouth to speak to the housekeeper who is looking at her. “What did you just call me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pardon?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My name is… Tiana?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, my lady!” The maid’s face goes pale. Astonished, she turns to the butler. The butler makes eye contact and approaches with a stern face. “My lady, do you not remember the housekeeper, Roena?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, umm, I…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you, do you not recognize me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The butler goes pale like the housekeeper. The two exchange a glance, and the butler shouts hurriedly, “Bring the emergency contact stone! We must let the Duke know immediately!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, yes!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The butler follows the running maids. The housekeeper, who is holding her hand, cautions the remaining servants who had begun to murmur. “Quiet now. Everyone except Inabelle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But, Ms. Roena…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hush please!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servants bow their heads once and leave the room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Housekeeper…” Inabelle calls in a trembling voice, looking like she is about to cry. She looks just the same age as her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t cry, Inabelle. You are going to scare the lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her words seem to have only made it worse, because then, Inabelle breaks down completely and begins to weep uncontrollably. When she notices Roena and her lady watching her, she tries her best to quell her tears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The housekeeper sighs gently when she sees Inabelle and turns around to look into her eyes. Roena’s hands against hers feel warm and comforting. Her green eyes stare at her sadly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My Lady. Do you really not remember me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t. I’m sorry. I’m not sure what’s going on right now.” She was feeling confused and just needed answers. “So my name is Tiana. Is that right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, the butler from earlier, the duke he said he needed to contact is…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your father, my lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My father?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh my god, my father is a duke? Do Dukes still exist in Korea? Dukes are only found in foreign countries or novels like The Dangerous Situation of the Emperor or…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait… No way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My lady?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I sit to think about it, that would mean…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She holds her breath and turns to Roena. “What is my father’s name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Grace, Duke Edwin Quinn Celeste.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, I would be…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are Tiana Quinn Celeste, daughter of the Duke, my lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Goodness!” She could not help but exclaim. She is stunned with realization, then in flashes, she remembers what had happened to her. It was like being hit in the head with a sledgehammer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What…” She says and for the first time, she notices the big mirror sitting elegantly in a corner. She stares at her reflection, bewildered and astounded. Those unique silver-gray eyes. The dark hair. The expensive clothing. Everything was beginning to piece together sensibly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was reborn as Tiana?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why hadn’t she thought of it earlier? She had read the book many times before losing consciousness. She had reacted to the story and was emotionally involved with its progression. She had commented about Tiana Quinn Celeste, the poor woman who was killed by her beloved villain husband, but who turned out to be the real villain.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am Tiana? Am I really in The Dangerous Situation of the Emperor, reborn as a character? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She bites the inside of her mouth, deliberately avoiding the curious gaze of Roena and Inabelle. This was way too vivid to be considered a dream.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sort of thing only happens in dreams. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She remembers holding onto volume two of the book in her arms before she blacked out, Lucius’ face decorating its front cover. Having read the side story that concentrated on Lucius, she wondered why she had been reborn as Tiana of all the characters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she is gazing into space, the bedroom door opens with a loud noise introducing a tall man with the butler by his side. Roena and Inabelle by her side quickly take a step back and bow. They looked bewildered at the sudden appearance, and she could not take her eyes off them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he cautiously approaches her, she realizes fast that he is Tiana’s father. Like Tiana, he sported dark indigo hair and blue eyes like the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He comes close to her bed, “Tiana.” </span></p>
