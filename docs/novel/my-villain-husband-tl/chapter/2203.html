            <p><b>Chapter 12 – Troubled Hearts (II)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lately, Lucius has been busy, so he couldn’t come often. He had been here a month ago to see her. Every time he came, her hair was the first thing that caught his attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has the best view of the center of the garden, from the window in her room. He stares vacantly at her closed window, hoping she would open it and see him. He would be so happy to see her, but he knew he would be sad if she looked away immediately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana had become a completely different person in that accident two years ago. This time, she had lost her memory again. Lucius does not know what he would do if he is once again rejected by Tiana. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will she scream that she doesn’t want to see me? Maybe she will once again look at me with contempt.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He remembers her indifferent eyes and it breaks his heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she kept rejecting him, Lucius couldn’t leave. He didn’t want to leave. Lucius did not want to abandon hope. He wanted to believe in the hope of that little smile that she shows him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My Lady, would you like some tea?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving Inabelle, who tries to read her countenance, she sits in her bed thinking about what had happened in the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, what were they hiding? Is it possible that the marriage has been decided? She didn’t think so, but what else would make Lucius visit? A lot was going on that she did not know. If the wedding was close, they would have mentioned it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were probably trying not to bother her. It was however too obvious that everyone was hiding something.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She beckons to Inabelle at the door. “Nabel. Can I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, my lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Grand Duke has come to see me and I do not know him. Do you have any idea why he came to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“About that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My father did not let me see him. Do you know why?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eeer…” Inabelle feels she is trapped and avoids her gaze. She is Tiana’s personal maid. She would know better than anyone what had happened to Tiana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you think he did that so I would not make a mistake because of my lost memories? It is so annoying that I do not know what is going on. The Grand Duke is a respectable man, but I’m worried that I have put my father in a difficult position.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My lady…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m so sorry that everyone seems to be in trouble because of me. This is why I need to know what is going on.” She tries to keep tears from clouding her sight. Without her memories, she wants to try her best and not be a bother. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, Inabelle replies, “You and Your Majesty are engaged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Engaged? So, are there any wedding plans?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. Originally, you are to be wedded in mid-May, in two months. But the lady was in an accident. Perhaps the reason the Grand Duke visited is because of the wedding date.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, their conversation would end well. She was satisfied with her maid’s reply. The date fits with what she had read in the novel. The wedding would have been the same if she hadn’t been in an accident. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why will they discuss the date of the wedding without me? No matter how much of my memories I have lost, it isn’t right.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family of the Duke of Celeste was famous, and Tiana, the young Celeste, was also widely known. The news that she suffered an accident from a fall would have been known to the empire by now. Perhaps the fact that she lost her memories had spread. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the novel, the wedding was magnificent. Lucius and Tiana’s marriage was such that no one would not know of the empire. However, the news that Young Lady, who is about to marry, has lost her memory, would count as a fault.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is he hiding something about the marriage from me? It is right that he explains the situation clearly to Lucius.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she did not have Tiana’s memories, she knew she had to let the Duke know that there was nothing wrong with getting married to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knows there is more to it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why she wasn’t allowed to meet Lucius. The reason why he had to postpone the marriage.</span></p>
