            <p><strong>Chapter 17 – To be a Bride of May</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a shame, truly, how this man was such an angel, save for the white wings and golden halo, yet only received harsh comments from the readers. She couldn’t help but mentally thank the dreadful Tiana for switching bodies. She quickly reaches out and grasps onto the petal as it flies in the air. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Lucius. My name is Tiana Quinn Celeste and it is quite lovely to meet you,” she curtsies.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s make our relationship end on a happy note</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she promises herself, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will make sure it has one because I am forever captured by you. Thank you author,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she whispers in her mind. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for making such a man my husband. I can’t wait to become his wife. When exactly does that happen though</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she wonders as a smile creeps to her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that thought, she was reminded of one of the significant obstacles she must overcome before her dream to wed this man is realized: her father—Edwin; he needed to be convinced to let the wedding happen. He has disapproved of Lucius meeting his daughter today so he must have no intention of furthering the wedding plans. Perhaps he was even considering cancelling the entire thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius looks onto her blankly as she asks, “I guess you came to see me but my father stopped you right? He has been so worried about me since the incident so I am sorry that you were denied.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is alright,” he replies, “it hasn’t been long since the accident so his reaction is understandable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did your conversation go well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. I could tell that the Duke is deeply concerned about your wellbeing. I came with the intention of asking after you and also to speak about our marriage. I was taken aback when he gave me the most unexpected reply.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What did father say…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He wishes to postpone the marriage for a little while,” Lucius says softly.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew it,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she thinks. It was within her expectations that her father would cease the coming marriage; gladly, he only resorted to a delay. Even then, such news didn’t ring sweet to her ears. She must find a way for the wedding to come into being, maybe not on the same date but some time around then. Only after she accomplishes such feat would Angelica and Rael be able to proceed with their wedding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since dates and seasons in the book resembled that of the real world, May would be the better choice, if not best, to tie the knot in this world as well. There is the saying, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“bride of May,”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and since Angelica and Rael consciously choose the same date as Tiana and Lucius’ wedding in spring a year later, the date mustn’t pass May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The critical motivation behind the wedding’s postponement was the condition of her body; thus, the strings rest around her fingers. Once the two are married, they will have moved to Lucius’ main estate in the emperor’s territory. However, consequent to the accident which caused the loss of her memory, her father became distressed over her security if she leaves his side</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a reasonable fear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can fully relate to how the Duke must be feeling. Since his one and only daughter has been through such a terrible thing, he must be worried,” expresses Lucius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s alright!” She exclaims before he can say anything else, but earned a raised brow from Lucius. He questions, bewildered at her sudden outburst, “Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her confidence unwavered. She states boldly, “I will convince my father.” If his reason for delaying the wedding was out of concern for her wellbeing, there exists a way to convince him otherwise. In fact, there were plenty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius looked rather worried at her optimism; it was as if she was full of certainty. “But I doubt the Duke will change his mind so easily…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not worry. My body is healed, I am able to move around now, and my condition isn’t as bad. If the problem is regarding my memory, time will fix that. Also, I have a proposal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confusion knits his eyebrows together as a frown marrs his face. “A proposal?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father is worried that I would have to leave home and move far away to the Emperor’s territory and spend my time alone there. Didn’t you get that impression during your conversation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I definitely sensed that he was worried about your condition and how it may change,” Lucius replies as he digests her words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So as long as I don’t move far away, we can proceed with the marriage without any issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That would provide a solution to the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, I would require your help and approval.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My help?” Once more, confusion swathed his gorgeous features. He seemed to have a difficult time comprehending this unexpected conversation. </span></p>
