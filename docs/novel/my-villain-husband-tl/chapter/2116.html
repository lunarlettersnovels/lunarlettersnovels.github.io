            <p>A few young girls could be seen arguing in front of the fountain. One stood in front of a group of three.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the familiar face, it was Angelica. Something had happened as there was a broken teacup near her feet. Staring at the other three girls with an angry face–different from her usual indifferent look–she said, “Can you repeat what you just said?”</p>
<p>Tiana was shocked at her rather angry complexion. She hadn’t expected to see Angelica like that at their first encounter with each other. The three girls looked embarrassed as her face twisted even angrier.</p>
<p>“Why are you so sensitive like that?”</p>
<p>“Right. You just take one word and…”</p>
<p>One of the other girls, who were wary of the growing attention, stepped forward. Standing firmly like the captain of the group, she was unshaken by Angelica’s glare.</p>
<p>“Angelica, we were just talking about the quality of the products that we were gifted from your family. But did you really have to shatter the teacup like this?”</p>
<p>“Frankly speaking, indeed, the quality of the products from your family is not good, right? We were only speaking the truth, but there is no reason for you to break the teacup and raise your voice at us,” said the purple-haired girl, speaking confidently as if she’d done nothing wrong. On the contrary, Angelica, who looked at her quietly, opened her mouth in a rebuttal manner.</p>
<p>“I can’t let go of what I just heard, regardless of the quality of my family’s products. We are struggling to sell even poor-quality products since we lost all our money. How could you say such a thing?”</p>
<p>“Oh my, when did I say such a thing? All I said was ‘they must be going through hard times, so they have to sell those kinds of products to support the family with my fullest sincerity.”</p>
<p>“You are quite the orator. That clearly wasn’t what you just said,” retorted Angelica.</p>
<p>“Well. That’s exactly what I said. Is it not?”</p>
<p>“It’s not.”</p>
<p>“Angelica strangely misheard what Whigette said.”</p>
<p>The Whigette girl, backed by the other ones, snorted and said confidently, “These two say no, and I don’t know if anyone else heard me say that. Did anyone hear me?”</p>
<p>There wasn’t a single reply from the people standing around watching them. Shrugging her shoulders after looking around, she stared at Angelica with a sly look on her face.</p>
<p>“There’s no one to prove it, so I think you misheard what I said. Or it seems you misunderstood it. I only said it out of concern, but I am a little sad now.”</p>
<p>“Whigette, please don’t feel too bad. I think Angelica is feeling more sensitive than normal.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. She just said it out of concern for Angelica… She’s probably been under a lot of stress lately.”</p>
<p>Angelica’s face hardened at the sarcastic remarks from the two other girls. It was very unpleasant to look at ‘team captain Whigette’, who seemed to be in the highest position of the three as if she was suing Angelica for not saying anything.</p>
<p>As there was no one around to listen to their conversation, it was obvious that they were trying to corner her on purpose. Of course, it was natural to encounter one or two girls like them; ones who’d pick a fight with the lead character.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a similar scene in the original story. But Tiana couldn’t remember her name. Seeing that she couldn’t recall her name, the Whigette girl seemed like an extra who hadn’t appeared in the original story.</p>
<p>Anyway, Tiana felt sorry for Angelica, who seemed to be holding back. Even though the girl wanted to retort, there was no one around to back her up. And Tiana couldn’t meddle even if she wanted to help, so she wondered what to do.</p>
<p>“There they go again. I’m so tired of them.” Alexandra, standing next to Tiana, sucked her teeth and Tiana asked after seeing them talking.</p>
<p>“Do you know about them?”</p>
<p>“A little. We aren’t close, but I know they’re famous. Especially the one from the Whigette family. Her family is rivals with Angelica’s family, so she can’t stand looking at her like that,” replied Alexandra.</p>
<p>“Oh really? They were talking about some product earlier; is it because their families are rivals?”</p>
<p>“Both families run a pottery business, and their respective business groups are different. Neutralism and empiricism…”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see…”</p>
<p>Indeed, that was reason enough to start a fight. The two families ran the same kind of business, and of all things the style of running their businesses was different, so it was inevitable that they’d bump heads at some point. But in the original story did the female protagonist’s family have a rival?</p>
<p>Tiana knew that Angelica’s family ran a pottery business in the original story, but this was her first time learning that she had a rival. The Whigette family was an empiricist one. Given the fact that this wasn’t in the original story, something must have happened before the original story. Since the timeframe now was prior to that of the original story, the two families might be in the middle of a rivalry.</p>
<p><em>Angelica’s attitude is a bit weird.</em></p>
<p>The Angelica from the original story didn’t hold back like that. Even though it was a pain, she responded to all of the approaching fights and arguments. But having seen her in a way that she normally didn’t behave, things with her family before and after the story seemed very different.</p>
