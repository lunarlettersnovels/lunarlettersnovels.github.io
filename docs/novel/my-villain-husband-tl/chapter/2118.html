            <p>Looking closely at the guest list, there was one name that stood out among the rest: ‘Angelica del Verne’. Without a doubt, it was the name of the original story’s female protagonist. How in the world did she get invited? Then, Tiana would be able to see her today!</p>
<p>There was still some time left until the original story started, so she couldn’t think too much about it, but she couldn’t wait because she didn’t think she’d meet her this way. Regardless of when the original story began, if Tiana would socialize now, she is likely to meet Angelica.</p>
<p>Angelica wasn’t active as a count’s daughter, but since she’s been socially active from time to time, they might be able to meet more often than Tiana had thought. Today’s event marks the first day they can meet.</p>
<p>Just thinking about how she can finally see the sky-blue eyes and blond hair described in the original story made her heart race with anticipation like the first time she had met Lucius. In fact, Tiana’s third favorite was Angelica.</p>
<p>She even liked her nonchalant personality which was different from protagonists in other novels she has read, and it was exciting to see Angelica meet Rael and open her heart to him.</p>
<p>If possible, Tiana wanted to become close with Angelica. Since she had been able to see in the original story how Rael and Angelica met, she also wanted to see their smiling faces together. Well, they had had the same feelings for one another, so they should have been married by now.</p>
<p>Considering the next episode that came up after Tiana had lost her memory, she still wanted to watch it. Though now she is fortunate enough to be able to see the final scene here.</p>
<p>It was weird for Tiana to be staring blankly at the guest list, so Alexandra asked with a strange face, “What’s wrong? Is there someone you’re worried about?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. It’s just that there are more guests than I expected,” she replied.</p>
<p>“It isn’t that much. It’s around 30 people. There will be much more than this at later parties.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right. My head is still not straight since this is my first return to society in such a long time.”</p>
<p>“Well, your memory hasn’t all returned, right? You’ll be fine, so just take your time and don’t worry. I’ll be by your side. Whatever happens, I’ll take care of it,” assured Alexandra.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Tiana was thankful for Alexandra’s consideration. She was helping out a lot, especially with things about Lucius and with Tiana’s dress. What had happened before would have hurt Alexandra a lot, but Tiana was grateful that she just accepted it as if nothing had happened. It was easy to have a friend like that. Tiana wanted to keep this relationship with her as long as possible.</p>
<p>Having spent some time chitchatting about this and that, it came time for the tea party to start. Tiana was about to go to the garden first, but she left the room with Alexandra five minutes before the opening.</p>
<p>Coming out through the hallway into the spacious garden, she could see the other wives and daughters gathered around. They were walking together, with everyone’s attention on them, and standing in the middle of the crowd, Alexandra marked the start of the tea party.</p>
<p>“Thank you, everyone, for attending the party. The spring weather is perfect for an event like this. I hope you all have a wonderful time.”</p>
<p>At the same time Alexandra ended her short greeting, a song began playing from one side of the garden. The garden was bright and full of spring energy. And calm music on a warm sunny day; a perfect start to the tea party.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Welcome, grand duchess. I am Count Adolte’s…”</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to finally meet you, grand duchess. I am Marquess Tyraine’s…”</p>
<p>“Grand duchess. I am…”</p>
<p>Tiana tried to maintain a stiff face as she accepted the never-ending wave of greetings. After the tea party started, the wives and daughters who were looking around for a while soon rushed to greet her.</p>
<p>She sighed quietly when she saw the people sitting in their seats get pushed out of the way by the ones approaching her. What Alexandra had said earlier was definitely true.</p>
<p>No matter how new the rumors spread, she didn’t think they’d approach her so easily. Her prediction was more wrong than she’d thought. Rather, she was a little puzzled to see people really fretting about what had happened.</p>
<p>Alexandra, only staring and smiling, didn’t help out one bit after seeing Tiana buried in the crowd of wives and daughters. Thankfully, some servants brought out tea after a little while. When Tiana was thinking about which table in the garden to sit at, Alexandra came to her and dragged her away.</p>
<p>“Tiana, sit here.”</p>
<p>She brought her to a table in the center and sat her down in the middle chair. When Tiana saw her sitting next to her pretending not to know, she said in a small voice, “You’re supposed to sit here, Alexandra.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not. This is your seat. Today’s tea party was prepared for you.”</p>
<p>“Still, the host has to sit in the mid—”</p>
<p>“Though I am the host, you are the main guest. Don’t worry; just accept my gift to you.”</p>
<p>Tiana sighed again as Alexandra winked at her. She was thankful for her generosity, but this kind of gift was a bit embarrassing.</p>
<p>As the two sat down, so did the others who were looking at them. Each of the five tables had six chairs. The very center table where Tiana and Alexandra were sitting had four empty chairs.</p>
<p>Two women and two girls, who were timing each other, sat there, and those who gave them a disappointing look sat at the rest of the tables.</p>
