            <p><strong>Chapter 74 – Lovely Mornings</strong></p>
<p>“Mmmm . . .” Tiana, wrinkling her forehead, opened her eyes at the sunrays peering in through the curtains. Turning her heavy body over, she could immediately see Lucius’s face wrapped around her arms, reflecting warmth and satisfaction even in his sleep.</p>
<p>Tiana could not hide the smile that gradually grew on her face at the sight of him. This moment to her seemed surreal. She had never expected to live such a moment like the ones written about in romance novels.</p>
<p>She carefully stroked his face and slowly shifted her eyes down, gazing at his body. Last night she had smiled in satisfaction and buried her face in this body even at the sight of his clearly visible scars. This man was now her husband from today onward. Oh, how the stars had smiled upon her . . . that her first love became her husband.</p>
<p>Tiana wanted to compliment herself for her triumphant feat. “Now I get to see this every single day . . . ,” she said, tracing his sleeping face with her fingers.</p>
<p>Was this what women who were married to celebrities felt like in the modern world? Was it any different? If it were not happening to her, she would say it was near impossible in the real world. This thought made her happier and more excited for the future.</p>
<p>Finally, he was her husband, so from this moment, there was only one thing she could do: make him walk the righteous path and not the villain’s path. Tiana would now have a lot of things to do: find social activities, see the male and female leads of the original story, and build a foundation for her husband’s flowery road.</p>
<p>Time flew as she lost herself in thought. Sunrays cascaded down onto Lucius’s face, much stronger than earlier. After a slight toss and turn, he slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Did you sleep well, Lucius?”</p>
<p>“Tiana . . .” Staring blankly at his wife for a moment, he blinked a few times and soon smiled, hugging her.</p>
<p>As soon as Tiana buried herself into his warm arms, she could hear the beating of his heart.</p>
<p>“I thought I was dreaming, but you’re really right next to me.”</p>
<p>“It is not a dream. Did you already forget about yesterday?” teased Tiana.</p>
<p>“No, I will never forget that. It’s just that this situation . . . is so unbelievable. I am so glad.”</p>
<p>“Me too. I also thought this was a dream when I woke up earlier. If it’s such a realistic dream, I hope I don’t wake up.”</p>
<p>Was this the powerful connection of a couple who had just been married the previous day? As they stared into one another’s eyes, Lucius suddenly burst out laughing. From this moment on, it seemed to him, they would be happy just by making eye contact.</p>
<p>Tiana enjoyed a leisurely morning in his arms.</p>
<p>Feeling the warmth from her body, Lucius said while touching her face, “Are you . . . feeling okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m okay. I’m feeling a little heavy, but it’s a good heavy.”</p>
<p>“Are you able to move around?”</p>
<p>“Yes, why?”</p>
<p>Lucius cracked a smile while carefully scanning her body with his eyes.</p>
<p>“If you’re feeling okay, then shall we go take a trip somewhere or something?”</p>
<p>“A trip?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but not a trip, more like an outing. There’s a nearby small city with great scenery. I’ve got some time off, so I think it will be good for us two to get away for a couple of days . . . you know, to celebrate our marriage.”</p>
<p>“Us two . . . to celebrate our marriage?” Tiana was surprised at the random suggestion.</p>
<p>During these times people had honeymoons, but that wasn’t so common here, and since she would have so much to do from here on out, the thought of it had completely slipped her mind.</p>
<p><em>What did he mean by a wedding celebration trip?</em> It would be a trip to a nearby city, so it would not really be considered as traveling. Still Tiana was surprised that Lucius thought of it first and brought it up like this.</p>
<p>“You will soon start working as the lady of the house and will be busy with your social activities, so I thought it would be good to go away for a while. I also want to relax with you while we’re on vacation.”</p>
<p>“Lucius . . .”</p>
<p>“Do you not want to?”</p>
<p>Tiana hastily shook her head and gave him a big hug, smiling widely at his consideration. “No, no, it’s not that! I’m very happy you thought of it. I want to do it, Lucius. Thank you.”</p>
<p>All right—Tiana decided—no matter how much work she had to do, she could still enjoy these activities and feelings of newlyweds too. She could not reject such a thing, nor miss it for any reason. For the sake of Lucius, who had thoughtfully considered her by suggesting this activity in the first place, she had to accept it. And gladly she would, as it only came once in a lifetime—only once could they be newlyweds.</p>
<p>She kissed him on the cheek, and he smiled shyly and kissed her back.</p>
<p>“I can’t wait . . . our first trip together, just the two of us.”</p>
<p>“Me too, Tiana.”</p>
<p>“What kind of place is it?”</p>
<p>“Let’s just leave it as a pleasurable mystery for now, till we get there.”</p>
<p>“Hmm . . . whatever you say, husband!” Tiana said laughing.</p>
<p>A faint mischievous energy was in the air, and Lucius joined her in invigorating laughter.</p>
