            <p><strong>Chapter 88 – The Sweetest Reward (II)</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Cross-class selective welfare program</em>… so you’re thinking of expanding the program to not just commoners but to aristocrats as well? But the aristocrats wouldn’t be happy with the welfare,” Tiana said.</p>
<p>Welfare was pointless for wealthy aristocrats because it was an attack on their self-pride to receive help from someone, they wouldn’t welcome it.</p>
<p>“But they would be with investments. They don’t like receiving help for no reason, but they do like a reason to receive an investment. Truth be told, they don’t dislike receiving support. Rather, they like it but cannot express it openly since they have to save face,” replied Lucius.</p>
<p>“That’s duplicitous.” Tiana’s nose wrinkled.</p>
<p>“It’s inevitable. It’s a class trait among aristocrats.” He replied with a faint smile after seeing Tiana’s disapproving face. “It would be fine for them if they were to choose between those who needed business investments, not for survival, like the common people do, or those who want investment or need it from the lower-class aristocracy.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure that’s a good idea because that’s not just for the general welfare, but an investment,” said Tiana.</p>
<p>“Yes, with reasonable attention and support given to the aristocracy, there will probably be little or no dissatisfaction.”</p>
<p>“But then it’d become a ‘cross-class selective welfare investment program’.”</p>
<p>“No matter what, that’s how it has to be.”</p>
<p>Nodding her head, Tiana looked at Lucius and sighed. The name of the business had gotten a lot longer and bigger. She had only planned to call it a ‘social welfare program’, but what now? It was fortunate that she had not lost her original purpose, although she might have to invest for the aristocrats too. It was better than running the program with a problem and getting hit by backlash. Rather, to do it to where the aristocrats don’t talk about it at all, it was best to have no problems from the beginning. Tiana was glad she’d found a solution somehow. This was also thanks to Lucius. Had he not given her advice, she wouldn’t have thought of it alone. She gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek to express her gratitude.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Lucius. I would’ve missed a huge detail were it not for you.”</p>
<p>“You’re really thanking me?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Had I done it without you, the problem we’ve already resolved would definitely have occurred. So, thank you,” smiled Tiana.</p>
<p>His smile filled with mischief in under ten seconds and her mood lightened.</p>
<p>“Then… I want a proper reward.”</p>
<p>“A proper reward?” she asked.</p>
<p>“This…” he gestured towards his cheek “isn’t enough to satisfy me.”</p>
<p>Tiana squealed in surprise as he grabbed her and jumped up from the sofa in a sudden movement. She clung to his neck. Rushing out of the living room, he strode past the shocked servants and headed up the stairs. Warren, who encountered them in the hallway, made a surprised face for an instant, then immediately corrected his expression and followed Lucius. Upon arriving at the bedroom door, Warren opened the door for them, and Lucius stepped inside with her still in his arms.</p>
<p>“Don’t let anyone in until I call you tomorrow.” He instructed Warren.</p>
<p>“Will do, sir.”</p>
<p>Warren nodded at Lucius’ order, closed the door and went out, taking the waiting maids with him. With the two of them left alone in the room, Lucius walked slowly to the bed and carefully laid Tiana down. Kneeling next to her, he brushed a hand over her cheek and kissed her forehead, nose, making her giggle.</p>
<p>“I want a better reward. I want all the rewards you can give me,” Lucius spoke.</p>
<p>“Good. I will give you… my sweetest reward.”</p>
<p>“Tiana.”</p>
<p>She kissed him on his lips, looking into his heated golden eyes. Then she closed her eyes slowly, feeling his hot tongue penetrating her mouth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Tiana…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It’s morning. You have to get up now.”</p>
<p>“Just a little more…”</p>
<p>Tiana opened her eyes slightly at Lucius’ sweet morning voice and dug her face into his arms. One of the good things she had observed after marriage was that the morning time, which was always hard to endure, was no longer hard at all. Lucius was there when she opened her eyes, and she was always happy to spend a relaxing morning in his arms. It was more than just enjoyment. How happy she was to be able to see his dazzling figure every morning. Her handsome lover, no, husband. Tiana felt the heat from his chest as she laid on him, and as she opened her eyes again, Lucius smiled and softly caressed her face.</p>
<p>“Then just a little bit? Rest a bit more, then eat breakfast.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sounds good.”</p>
<p>“You’re very tired.”</p>
<p>“Not really…I just like this moment. I want to be with you just a bit more. Because if I get up, I won’t be able to see you until this evening.”</p>
<p>“Tiana.”</p>
<p>She opened her eyes to a slightly rugged voice and looked at him, and he looked at her fondly. She smiled at him and kissed him. “You want another reward like yesterday?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I haven’t done anything to deserve an award today,” replied Lucius.</p>
<p>“Do you always need to do grand gestures for me to reward you? You always protect me, so you have every reason to be rewarded, and I want to do something good for you.”</p>
<p>“I want to reward you, too. I don’t want to just receive,” Lucius said.</p>
<p>“Then can I tell you what I want today?” smiled Tiana.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait.” Tiana’s lips covered his as she wondered about it. If it were anything like last night, she couldn’t wait to see.</p>
