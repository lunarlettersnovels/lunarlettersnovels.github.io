            <p><b>Chapter 41 – Strange Sputter</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement of Alexandra’s arrival sent a shocking wave of astonishing and confusing thoughts to Tiana. It hadn’t been long since the royal empress’ letter arrived. She must have prepared for her visit as soon as she sent it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana, still perplexed, jumped up from where she was seated to greet Alexandra outside the door, but as she turned toward the entrance, she came face to face with the princess, who was already inside the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her rich red hair fluttered down to her chest and her big green eyes glistened spotlessly like jewels while looking at her intently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the two royals eyed each other warily, Tiana could see the surprised look on her servants’ faces as Alexandra barged in with the court ladies following behind. Time seemed to freeze along with everybody in the room. The stillness of both their beauty and the regal way they assess each other couldn’t hide the turmoil that was wreaking havoc in Tiana’s heart. She wasn’t prepared for this meeting and it was driving her crazy.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Why?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Why did she have to come right away unexpectedly? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alfred was the first to regain his composure and address the imperial princess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll… bring some tea. Please have a seat, Her Royal Highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calming the chaotic mood of the room, he sent away the servants and court ladies who were crowded at the door and politely led the princess into the inner living room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana stoled a quick glance at Alfred as she slowly shuffled her way inside. Alfred, in turn, winked at her, in assurance, from an unclamped distance, before quietly closing the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not knowing what to do, the two ladies sat down awkwardly, making very small movements so as not to make attention to themselves. With only the wiggling of their fingers, Tiana couldn’t gauge when was the right moment to say her greeting, so she merely contented herself into sitting quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would you like to sit here, Your Highness?” Alfred, tasting the grave discomfort in the air,  guided Alexandra to a better seat. Stepping back to where Alfred was ushering her, her lips remained sealed; her eyes glued to Tiana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana could feel those probing eyes on her like a sharp laser beam cutting through the hardest diamond. Trying hard not to break under pressure, instead of avoiding Alexandra’s gaze, she meets it head on, only to regret it. It definitely felt like a collision was brewing in the horizon, and she was on the losing end of it.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s like she’s reading me… What do I do now?’ </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her thoughts were racing; she must think fast. Alexandra knew about Tiana’s accident and that she has lost her memory because of it. Now that she introduced herself, Alexandra has the advantage over her. The princess knew the ‘Tiana’ from two years ago and the Tiana she was facing right now. Nonetheless, this could still work to give her an upper hand, since Alexandra could tell her about Tiana that she has no knowledge of. And the best place to start for now was to figure out how to initiate a conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock, knock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come in.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, Alfred returned with the tea—a much needed distraction. She noticed the green teacups that she had never seen before. Even the smell of black tea was deeper and stronger than usual. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puzzled, she stared at Alfred, looking for an answer to her unasked question. Alfred seemed to understand, as he spoke carefully after glancing at Alexandra. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been such a long time since Her Royal Highness has visited us, so I brought the black tea that you two like. This tea set, on the other hand, is a gift from me.” After ensuring that everything was in order, Alfred signaled the maids to leave the living room so that the two ladies could enjoy their time together, alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without acknowledging Alfred after he had spoken, Tiana only concentrated into inspecting the fine green teacup and the strong-scented reddish-black tea.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I see, he chose these on purpose. I knew it; he is so meticulous. I wonder though why he just brought these out only now? Did he also receive them as a gift?’ </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noticed how the teacups are delicately yet luxurious designed. It was perfectly suitable for the exquisite tea poured into it. She even liked the deep aroma of the reddish black tea that seemed to tickle her nose, which she scratched unconsciously as her mouth watered with such earthy fragrant. She grew thirsty, yet she fought the urge to reach for it and drink the tea in front of her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Tiana, Alexandra retreated from gazing upon her host as now her eyes are glued to the teacup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana noticed the slight surprise in the princess’ expression as her green eyes seemed to shake in disgust for being presented with such beverage. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What’s wrong with her? Does she hate black tea? But earlier Alfred had said the tea that ‘you two’ like…’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana continued to observe Alexandra’s reaction, wondering if Alfred—meticulous Alfred— made a mistake this time and served them the wrong kind of tea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Alexandra, without looking up to meet her curious stare, slowly opened her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This… isn’t coffee.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me?” Tiana was perplexed, clueless of what she meant. </span></p>
