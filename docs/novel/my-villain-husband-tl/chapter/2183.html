            <p><b>Chapter 32 – Grandeur Places</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tour the entire dukes’ estate is nothing for the fainted heart. It will take months, possibly years before a person can have a grasp of how huge the mansion is and the neighboring structures built around it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana has already seen the living room, dining room, public library, even Lucius’ office, study, and bedroom. The enormous interior of the mansion makes one feel miniature and insignificant. Even the way out of it is quite an adventure to do with the endless corridor interconnecting countless rooms where dozens of servants can be seen busying themselves in their endless daily chores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, there were several structures behind the mansion where knights gather themselves while on the side are premises assigned as servants’ residence.  Yet, the space in between seems to be infinite in its vastness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius, seeing Tiana’s eagerness in their excursion, assured his companion that she can have all the time she needs in the future to see more of the place. Tiana appreciated his consideration and sensibility to understand her excitement yet refused to indulge in it. He just ushered her instead to go around the mansion for a little bit more of sightseeing before taking a breather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, they ended up in their final destination for the day, the garden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh…! What in the world!”  Tiana exclaimed, unable to control herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It isn’t like the garden is just a part of duke’s mansion. It’s more of, the garden is the highlight of the whole estate and the mansion was just placed there as an afterthought. The garden is not merely spacious and beautiful, it is breathtaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana was so overwhelmed for nothing compared to it, not even those she had seen in illustrations and her imagination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flowers, greens, and even the inessential bushes are thoughtfully planted and arranged in between the elegant sculptures and landscapes. The burst of colors  is subtle to the eyes but has the power to bring out bright colors of emotions to those who come and see. Even the trees stood in confidence between the fences with not a single leaf wilting under the heat of scorching sun. They stood there, like knights ready to defend the garden’s visitors of vibrant-colored butterflies and carefree bees that are roaming around their place of refuge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana was captivated by such mesmerizing beauty that she couldn’t take her eyes off such a picturesque sanctuary.  She never thought that she could find such well kept and managed treasure in the duke’s mansion considering there isn’t any lady of the house. It was so unlike the duke’s personality to have one such enchanting hideaway. It was disappointing that she cannot add anything anymore to such grandeur of a garden but having one made her feel great nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, she would be given full authority as the lady of the house on how to manage this garden in the future, but she didn’t want to touch it anymore as it was already perfect. To think of the duke as the gardener was absurd but the atmosphere of the garden suited the grand duke’s mansion to a tee that she would be very pleased to meet with the gardeners later on. For now, she contented herself into not rushing out of such wonderful display of enchanting vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana smiled brightly as she saw Lucius looking at her gazing upon the garden. He must be having the time of his life knowing that he has made such grand impression on her with such magnificent charm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s beautiful, Lucius.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weather seemed to be cooperating with them, allowing them to circle around the path to take a closer look and even enjoy the scents of the flowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding her hair fluttering in the wind, Tiana was looking at a cloud in the blue sky when a shadow fell over her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The weather is nice, but the sunlight is pretty hot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before she knew it, he carefully held a parasol over her head; the one he had received from a maid. Touched by the warm look in his eyes, she accepted it and smiled shyly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I apologize. I was a bit overly excited about all this. Let’s just stop here since the weather and sunlight feel good… And thanks for the parasol.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s nothing. You look amazing. When you’re happy, I’m happy, Tiana.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you like the sun, Lucius? For me, when the weather is nice like this I want to walk around without a parasol, but the maids don’t usually allow me to. Oh, but I’m not complaining about you, Lucius. I really thank you for bringing it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I already knew that,” he said hurriedly, frantically nodding his head. He turned his eyes away, angling himself far from Tiana’s face as it hides behind the parasol. He shields himself against her soft eyes while feeling the heat that crept up his face and made him turn bright red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana, oblivious of how much impact she’s making with the duke, walked slowly while twirling the handle of the parasol. Several steps in, she felt the absence of a companion following her so she turned around. She found him just standing several feet away from her, watching her intently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even from a distance, his golden eyes glistened under the sunlight, shining more than usual. It felt as though he was right in front of her, showering her with adoration that sends inexplicable pleasure in her spine. Tiana smiled unwittingly.</span></p>
