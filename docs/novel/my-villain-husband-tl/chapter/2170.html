            <p><b>Chapter 45 – Sparkles and Glitters</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana was mystified. Every time she moved, the sparkles at the hem of the dress glittered brilliantly; perhaps Alexandra had instructed for the highest quality silk fabric to be used because the rest of the dress cascaded down like water flowing serenely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandra smiled at Tiana. “I still have much to do on this dress,” she said eagerly, “but you already look marvelous. Imagine how gorgeous you will be once I finish it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana was still awe-struck by the silvery dress. “It’s so beautiful,” she managed to utter, “I love the way it drapes over my body. It feels so comfortable and just right!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Feels good?” Alexandra asked, pleased, “It covers you without making you feel trapped. It’s a very rare fabric, made from silk extracted from the silkworms. Do you know the silkworms are fed silver?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really?!” asked Tiana, astonished, turning towards Alexandra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be exact,” said Alexandra, smiling, “the silkworms are fed a herbal medicine called Silvering.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh…” said Tiana. That made more sense. Otherwise, Tiana was questioning how such small worms could eat metals like silver. There was no way their tiny mouth could manage that. But it still amazed her that there was such a herb called silvering. She thought it rather sounded like those cure-for-all gibberish. She wondered if there was something called ‘goldering’ as well.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If one was a cure-for-all, the other would be the poison</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she mused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t tell me there is a ‘goldering’ as well,” she said smiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!” Alexandra looked surprised. “How did you know?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this for real? Or is she just pulling my leg? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana thought. She had asked meaning to be funny and hadn’t expected for such a thing to exist. The writers of this world must have felt smart setting things up in this way. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How cliché, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she thought. Normally, gold would be the cure-for-all and silver would be the poison. It was interesting that the concepts were flipped around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even Rael wears robes made from silk produced by the silkworms that ate goldering,” explained Alexandra, “Both herbs are rare. The silks are extracted only twice a year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it really alright to use such a rarity on me?” asked Tiana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Definitely!” said Alexandra with conviction, “His Majesty made it clear that I can use whatever I want. So I will use whatever passes my fancy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right,” agreed Tiana, not intending to cross her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when the former Emperor was alive, there was no one who could stop Alexandra from doing whatever she wished. Being an only daughter, Alexandra grew up in freedom and luxury. Emperor Rael, who currently was in power, doted on her, as did Lucius because she was their only sister. So it was natural for Alexandra to be stubborn, albeit a little self-centered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I desperately wanted to use this silk as soon as possible,” said Alexandra fondly, “It is in a much better condition than the one last year! I found a perfect color for you and Lucius and got right to work.” She added enthusiastically, “Do you want to see how glamorous Lucius’ robe is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure,” Tiana obliged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana didn’t dislike Alexandra for being self-centered, though. Sometimes, she was annoyed, but she liked Alexandra’s confidence. Despite everything, Alexandra was meticulous in her work, caring and surprisingly soft-hearted. She had come all the way to see Tiana and cried when she finally saw her, which showed how much she cared for her. Tiana thought she was blessed in more ways than one. She had a good husband, a good family, and a good friend. All these things were something she never had before. Perhaps that’s why Tiana felt a bitterness in her heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait here a moment,” said Alexandra as she placed a mannequin near her. She brought out something wrapped in black cloth from the piled-up garments and other bric-a-brac. She unwrapped the black covering and held a brilliant gold robe, which she draped over the mannequin. It was so resplendent that Tiana stared at it with reverence and admiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana didn’t have the words to describe the beauty that was before her. She wondered how Alexandra managed to design something so beautiful from a bundle of silk. Was she possessed as well? But she had graduated from Fashion Design School with the highest honor. It made sense for her to be so talented. The border from the collar to the arms and to the legs were embroidered colourfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could you stand here for a second?” asked Alexandra as she pulled Tiana to stand next to the mannequin. She stared at the two robes for a length of time and nodded heaving a deep sigh. “Just what I expected,” she said, exasperated, “I have to see you both in person wearing the robe. It’s just not the same staring at a mannequin. Can you two come by my place next time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There isn’t much time,” said Alexandra hurriedly, “I need to fix your dress first. Trim it a bit more. But I need to modify his robe too. It is convenient and quicker for me if you both come to my place.”</span></p>
