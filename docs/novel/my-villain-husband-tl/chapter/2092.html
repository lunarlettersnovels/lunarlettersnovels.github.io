            <p>“…with you?”</p>
<p>At his unexpected words, she stared at him, shocked. He was especially aggressive today. And he had a lot more to say than usual. Was it because it’s someone he knew? Perhaps Count Verne has a good reputation for him.</p>
<p>Tiana was thankful for him wanting to join her, but seeing his different-than-usual attitude made her think something strange about him. Alexandra, who also probably thought he seemed weird, said with an odd look on her face,</p>
<p>“You’re going, too? How come?”</p>
<p>“I’m curious about the Verne family’s situation. Count Verne has also heard the rumors, but it’s strange seeing that there isn’t any developing news. So, I think I should go check on him.”</p>
<p>“I know that you and he have a friendly relationship, but I didn’t think you’d step up like this.”</p>
<p>“You are worried about Angelica, too, and it’s also simply because of your curiosity. A count is a trustworthy person. Is there really a problem with me going with you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a problem, but…”</p>
<p>Shifting her eyes back and forth between Tiana and Lucius, Alexandra said with a sigh,</p>
<p>“Tiana going by herself is one thing, but you joining her is the problem, Lucius. It’s fine if you go as stealthily as possible so as to not attract any attention; if the word gets out, however, everyone will start talking about it.”</p>
<p>Definitely, since the Vernes were neutralists and Lucius and Tiana were nobles, there may be a misunderstanding that they were trying to get involved with them politically. The grand duchy was the backbone of the aristocracy</p>
<p>Perhaps also thinking that way, Lucius continued.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, we’ll keep a low profile. And Count Verne is surprisingly stubborn and has a strong-willed personality, so if such a rumor gets around, he won’t move on from it easily. Because he isn’t someone to fall for something if he’s being appeased.”</p>
<p>It sounded like Lucius had already tried to coax him once.</p>
<p>“Have some aristocrats tried to appease him?”</p>
<p>“…is a strong, reliable man with a likable personality. I didn’t do it directly, but I’ve talked about it with him a few times.”</p>
<p>“But then he turned around and rejected you.”</p>
<p>“…he is stubborn when it comes to his beliefs…”</p>
<p>Tiana refrained from bursting into laughter after seeing him roll his eyes. Oh, how cute he looked when his ears turned red in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Surprisingly competent and greedy. She didn’t think he’d seduce other faction’s aristocrats. As far as she knew, he was not interested in the throne, so she thought the faction was just being maintained by Marquess Calvino, but that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>Well, in order for him to have a stable position as a Grand Duke, the formation of the aristocrats who supported him had to be good.</p>
<p>On the surface of the aristocratic group, Marquess Calvino was mentioned as being the representative and active, but not all members of that group followed him well.</p>
<p>There was also the position of Lucius’ maternal grandfather, and he didn’t stop his actions, so the other members were just watching, except for a few nobles who followed Marquess Calvin well. The backbone was as far as Lucius.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, he might have been building himself up well. Tiana was surprised that he knew how to coax people. Well, how else did they become a couple?</p>
<p>Alexandra, after listening to him talk, stared at him and said with a shocked expression,</p>
<p>“Lucius, now that I look at it you were doing everything behind our backs?”</p>
<p>“You’re quite greedy, Lucius,” said Tiana.</p>
<p>“No! I—Uh, well…”</p>
<p>The two women eventually burst out laughing watching him frantically think of what to say next. Alexandra laughed even harder at the sight of his bright red face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Much time had passed after they ate lunch in Alexandra’s palace. Tiana, her face hidden from the bright sunlight, took a little stroll around the palace with Lucius.</p>
<p>They almost couldn’t see anyone except for the servants passing by in the halls.</p>
<p>“Some reason it seems like not many people are here.”</p>
<p>“It’s probably this way because it’s time for each department to have its meeting.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? I guess they all have their meetings at this time.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. The sleepiest time is after lunch. I can imagine them all nodding off during their meetings.”</p>
<p>Tiana asked, smiling at this comment,</p>
<p>“Do you also get sleepy during yours?”</p>
<p>“I don’t. However, there are a few who doze off because they eat too much for lunch.”</p>
<p>“You definitely get drowsy after a full, warm meal.”</p>
<p>“It may also be because of the warmness of the meeting halls. The building is always maintained at the right temperature because of a warm spell.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? Interesting.”</p>
<p>Warmth spell. That is possible since this is definitely a world where magic exists. Now that I think of it, I think I’ve seen something similar to that in the Grand Duke’s mansion, too. I think it was in the living room or bedroom, thought Tiana.</p>
<p>They continued to walk while leisurely talking. Since they had been busy with their own affairs, they could take a walk together for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p>Their conversation wasn’t anything special, but it was good to spend a cozy time together. As they talked and walked, they soon reached the palace’s entrance. They were walking toward where the carriage was waiting when they heard a familiar voice from behind them.</p>
<p>“Tiana!”</p>
<p>“Lennox!”</p>
<p>His curly hair bounced around as he quickly ran toward the couple. While Tiana, unfamiliar with what he was wearing, stared at the blood-red robe he had on instead of the normal suit he had worn last time, he said in a welcoming voice,</p>
<p>“I saw you through the tower window walking. Oh, Your Highness Lord Lucius. Pardon me for my rudeness. I should have greeted you first, sir.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Lennox,”</p>
<p>said an embarrassed Lucius shaking his head at the sight of him bowing. Somehow, it was strange that his expression seemed stiff, but Lucius didn’t care much because he was glad to see Lennox after such a long time.</p>
<p>“Did you two have some business in the royal palace?”</p>
