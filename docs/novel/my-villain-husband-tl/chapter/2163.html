            <p><strong>Chapter 52 – Destiny’s Choice</strong></p>
<p>His expression, as if his brazenness has dissipated into thin air, seemed to imply that the timid Lucius had returned.</p>
<p>Tiana barely suppressed a laugh; she cleared her throat once more and picked up the towel. But when she saw his face slowly darken as his hands fell, she laughed and said, “There might be a product with the same scent for ladies.”</p>
<p>At her words, Lucius’ grim expression unfolded, and Tiana couldn’t help but chuckle at the way he gradually regained his complexion. It looked like he was about to run out this instant and buy the product with the same scent as his.</p>
<p>“I’ll style it for you, if you want.” She dropped the towel onto the table next to her as Lucius sat back down on the chair.</p>
<p>The silk-like hair didn’t once get caught in her fingers as she combed through. Her current hair, the hair that didn’t belong to her, was also soft and hung down towards her waist. Her real hair was nothing like this. No matter how time and effort she put into taming her hair, the bizarre texture had remained the same. It never grew properly, so it had been hard to get it down to her shoulders.</p>
<p>“This texture is amazing,” she complimented.</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It looks much better than mine.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not. Yours is better,” Lucius insisted.</p>
<p>“Yours is better, Lucius.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not.”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. So we both have good hair.” Tiana laughed at his unyielding attitude.</p>
<p>If she hadn’t been possessed, would she be as confident as she was now in front of Lucius?</p>
<p>Her body, too, was different. She had more curves, her elbows and knees did not stick out, and she was taller. Not that she had any issues with her real-life appearance, but she would not have the confidence to face Lucius when it came to them sharing a bed together.</p>
<p>Though, Tiana also knew that if she had crossed over with her body, she would have likely landed on her feet elsewhere. Whilst she would have likely never met Lucius, there were other people she could meet. And if she fell in love with someone else, maybe she would not have felt such immense pressure to look good in front of a noble. Maybe she might not have met anyone at all but would go on to live a full life as an independent woman.</p>
<p>For her to land in this body and be with Lucius, it was pure luck.</p>
<p>Given the choice between staying there and going home, she knew that she would stay behind. Because though it was greedy, she had no thoughts of going back to her normal life.</p>
<p>The original Tiana and the current Tiana seemed to have a lot in common, but she had to work hard on her behalf, especially now that she was a noble with responsibilities.</p>
<p>Tiana once again breathed in the floral scent of Lucius’ hair, bringing her out of her thoughts and grounding her back into the reality she found herself in.</p>
<p>Lucius spun round in his chair, reached his hand out. He cupped Tiana’s cheek and smiled softly at her, “I really like the way your hair smells.”</p>
<p>At the unexpected gesture, Tiana’s body involuntarily flinched. When she withdrew in surprise, Lucius grabbed her waist and slowly kissed the top of her head. Tiana’s cheeks instantly turned crimson. When her eyes met Lucius’ tantalizing orbs, she melted under his gaze.</p>
<p>Tiana wondered where he had learned all these tricks. Her feeble heart couldn’t take too much. Where was his sudden change in attitude coming from? It was only a few minutes ago he was blushing after making a joke. Was he gradually coming out of his shell? Tiana had no idea.</p>
<p>When Tiana reached to cover her blushing face, he grabbed her hand and clasped it with his. With a gentle smile that hung on his lips, he said, “Next time… we can use the same scent.”</p>
<p><em>He must be out of his mind</em>, Tiana thought.</p>
<p>Tiana may not be married yet, and she may be trying to stop this version of Lucius from becoming the villain, but that did not mean she could not enjoy these little moments between them.</p>
