            <p><strong>Chapter 77 – Happiness will Certainly Come</strong></p>
<p>The café, which wasn’t too far away, was filled with many types of flowers. From the flowers at the entrance to those displayed inside empty glass bottles all over the café, they made a beautiful ambiance.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was indeed a famous place since it seemed like every table was occupied. Thankfully, Tiana was still able to get a seat at one of the empty tables.</p>
<p>The café, divided into treelike partitions, had a round glass ceiling filled with trees and flowers, so it was as if she had come into a small botanical garden.</p>
<p>Lucius, who was looking at her, smiled softly as Tiana immersed herself in the comfortable, peaceful atmosphere of the natural ambiance.</p>
<p>“How is it? Good, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, very good. Thank you, Lucius. How did you find out about such a place?”</p>
<p>“I am glad you like it, Tiana. I heard that the flower tea menu changes with the seasons and the desserts are popular too. They say you can also try the rare flower tea if you come at the right time.”</p>
<p>“Really? I’m curious about it now.”</p>
<p>Tiana could not believe she could drink flower tea. This café that specialized in flower tea intrigued her. Maybe it was because of the impact of the city’s main business.</p>
<p><em>I wish there was a place like this in the capital.</em></p>
<p>There had to be at least one, right? A café with an ambiance like this would go well with the trendy setting of the capital.</p>
<p>The interior of the café also looked great because it showed certain focal points. While it wasn’t too fancy, it didn’t look old-fashioned either. It was formal but had a natural atmosphere that attracted plenty of people.</p>
<p>Probably for that reason, at least half of the customers in the café were tourists. She saw that though there were a lot of nobles in the place, there were also ordinary citizens dining. Being in a place where two social classes could mesh harmoniously was quite impressive to her.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the wait. Here are your desserts and tea.”</p>
<p>While Tiana was looking around, the tea and desserts she’d ordered had arrived. There was a glass teapot, a teacup, and a covered bowl on a moving tray.</p>
<p>“It’s our special of the month, marigold tea.”</p>
<p>The glass teapot was filled with bright yellow marigold petals. The attendant poured the thickly brewed flower tea into the teacup, and the scent lingered over the table.</p>
<p>“And this is our dessert set called ‘spring flower,’” the server said, removing the lid from the plate to reveal various types of small desserts.</p>
<p>There were pink macarons, financiers, cannoli, and muffins. The bright colors, as the name “spring flower” suggested, were delightful to see.</p>
<p>“Lord Lucius, Lady Tiana . . . it is an honor for us that you visited our main location. Please have a good and comfortable time.”</p>
<p>After a brief greeting, the server stepped away. However, Tiana noticed that somehow she knew who they were. As she looked at Lucius with surprise, his eyes moved to the side, avoiding her stare.</p>
<p>“By chance . . . did you order this ahead of time?”</p>
<p>“On our way through the streets, I thought it’d be nice if we stopped by. I heard that it’s hard to find a seat if you don’t make a reservation, so . . . I made a reservation earlier.”</p>
<p>“Lucius . . .”</p>
<p><em>This man</em>, she thought. <em>This is all part of his plan.</em></p>
<p>He’d reserved the table and brought her here as part of his plan.</p>
<p>She noticed that their server’s outfit was different from the others, and the manager seemed to have come out himself when he knew they were there. She had assumed they’d gotten lucky for getting a seat inside, but now she knew that it wasn’t just luck.</p>
<p>“When did you make a reservation?”</p>
<p>“About a month ago.”</p>
<p>“What? So this trip . . . you’ve been planning it since then?”</p>
<p>“Yeah . . .”</p>
<p>Seeing him look away again made Tiana snort.</p>
<p><em>A month ago? So he had been planning this even before the wedding. What should I do with this guy?</em> she thought.</p>
<p>She couldn’t be happier that he’d prepared all this for her. Tiana, blushing, looked into Lucius’s eyes, admiring him as he smiled shyly. She could feel his warm heart through his eyes that were now looking at her sincerely.</p>
<p>“Thank you . . . Really, I am so happy.”</p>
<p>“If you are happy, I am happy. It’s worth all the preparation.”</p>
<p>“Lucius . . .”</p>
<p>“Drink your tea before it gets cold, and eat the dessert too.”</p>
<p>“All right . . . Drink yours too.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>He lifted the teacup slowly and took a sip. The marigold petals slightly floating in the yellow teapot resembled the color of his eyes.</p>
<p>Taking a sip of her own tea, Tiana felt its pleasant scent and taste calmly spread all over her.</p>
<p><em>Come to think of it—what was that marigold phrase?</em> she thought. She was pondering it when her eyes met Lucius, who was already eating his dessert.</p>
<p>“It even tastes good on this financier. Try it, Tiana.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“How is the cannoli? The vanilla one tastes good.”</p>
<p>“I want to try it too.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>At Tiana’s request, Lucius picked it up with his fork and carefully offered his hand toward her. As she opened her mouth, the sweet vanilla stimulated her taste buds. They smiled at one another. A thought came to her, the marigold phrase.</p>
<p><em>Happiness will certainly come.</em></p>
<p>The phrase fits perfectly with Tiana and Lucius right now.</p>
