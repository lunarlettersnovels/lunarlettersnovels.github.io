            <p><strong>Chapter 72 – The Newlyweds</strong></p>
<p>“The bride and groom may enter.”</p>
<p>Both of them entered the ceremony at the minister’s cue. Roaring applause from the guests echoed in the hall upon seeing them together. The sparkling dress made Tiana look more splendid and graceful than any other bride they had ever seen. Alexandra, after seeing how good they looked together, grinned and applauded as well. As Tiana and Lucius approached the podium where the minister was standing, Edwin watched the beautiful couple from the very front row.</p>
<p>After they stepped right under the chandelier that was shining down brightly from above, the minister looked at the couple and started the ceremony.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to be the officiant of this wedding today. Two people who have lived such different lives, will now live alongside one another. I pray that you two are successful in creating a happy life.”</p>
<p>Continuing his sermon, he signaled the priest. He approached carefully with a box containing the rings. The minister began to read the vows.</p>
<p>“Lucius Eyal Rederick, do you take Tiana Quinn Celeste to be your wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do you part?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“Tiana Quinn Celeste, do you take Lucius Eyal Rederick to be your wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do you part?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“We have confirmed that you two agree with each other’s statements in the vows, with myself along with all of the guests as your witnesses.”</p>
<p>Lucius took a large, shiny diamond ring from the box delivered by the priest and put it on Tiana’s finger. Tiana also took the other dazzling ring from the box and slid it onto his finger.</p>
<p>They made eye contact and she smiled, waiting for his next move. He lifted her veil with slightly shaky hands and smiled back at her. Lowering his head, he kissed her softly on her red lips.</p>
<p>Watching their lovely interaction, the minister smiled and announced loudly.</p>
<p>“I now pronounce you husband and wife. May God shed his light on—”</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>In the middle of him speaking, the guests shot up out of their chairs and cheered to congratulate the newlyweds’ holy matrimony.</p>
<p>Edwin couldn’t take his eyes off the couple smiling happily at one another. Rael, who had been clapping with a big satisfied look on his face, bent down to pick up Rose from the ground. The smile didn’t leave his face as he barely blocked the bird, who seemed to want to fly over to the newlyweds at any moment. Marquess Calvino, who had been looking at Edwin with a disapproving face, also had a reluctant smile on his face, staring at the happy couple.</p>
<p>The wedding of Lucius and Tiana, which had stirred up the empire, was concluded safely.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Tiana relaxed as she dipped her body into the warm water and leaned back in the tub. Arriving at the grand duchy at night after a hectic reception at the palace, she slowly recounted what had happened today.</p>
<p>“A magnificent wedding, a magnificent reception…”</p>
<p>After having successfully finished the wedding ceremony, the following reception was also fun. She hadn’t expected to see Rael in the front row, but he was Lucius’ brother and the emperor. No one could stop him. Since more guests had attended than she’d thought, she couldn’t remember all of them, but she wanted to meet the empress dowager and thank her. Tiana had been bewildered since she hadn’t expected the empress dowager to attend the reception, but it had been good talking to her, and she had seemed like a great person. Especially since she hadn’t found anything particularly bothering. Perhaps it was true that she was feeling weak since she hadn’t been able to stay at the reception until the end, but they had made a promise to meet on a later date.</p>
<p>“That’s how she was, but surprisingly, she was a girl with a smile.”</p>
<p>As she soaked herself in hot water, she felt tired, like she was about to fall asleep. Having been so busy and not being able to sit even for a moment at the ceremony and reception, it was indeed a tiring day. But soon she recalled feeling the atmosphere of the unfamiliar bathroom. Everything was finished, and she had moved to the grand duchy, and now she was the lady of the house.</p>
<p>And tonight, she would spend her first night with Lucius.</p>
<p>It was the final step for the bride and groom after the wedding. After the maids had backed away and left Tiana alone in the bathroom, she accepted that she had a surprisingly calm first night.</p>
<p>“Lucius and I are newlyweds. The first step is spending the first night together. That way we can say we’re truly a married couple!”</p>
<p>It was only natural to do so after having a formal wedding. From now on in this marriage, nothing will be left out. But she was still a little anxious. She’s never been alone with a man, let alone in a relationship with one, and now she was married and about to have their first night together.</p>
<p>Holding hands, kissing; everything first she’s ever done has been with Lucius.</p>
<p>“Obviously I was the one who initiated the first peck, but…Lucius gave me a real kiss…”</p>
<p>Tiana didn’t even realize her body was twisting as she thought about his long, deep kiss from last night. It had been good to kiss on impulse, but in the end, Lucius had gone overboard with it! Geez! He can’t do that today.</p>
<p>Tiana cupped some warm water in her hand and poured it over her chest, then placed her hand over her heart to feel the beat. The pleasant tension excited her, making her want to meet him even more.</p>
<p><em>Hurry up and bathe, woman!</em> she thought.</p>
<p>She slowly lifted herself, with one arm on the edge of the tub, and stood up. She was about to call the maids to finish, but she paused at the sight of a shining object.</p>
<p>Three pink bottles lay side by side. They looked like shampoo and body wash, but they were different brands from the ones she’d seen a few days ago.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me…”</p>
<p>When she had washed her hair earlier, the scent had seemed familiar for some reason. Had Lucius changed it to what she had said she liked? She hadn’t expected him to actually do it. If so, then today they’d smell the same.</p>
<p>Suddenly her face turned red in embarrassment. After turning around and seeing her blazing face in the mirror, she urgently called in the maids. It was embarrassing to show them her current condition, but she couldn’t wait to get out of the bathroom, so she turned away from the mysterious eyes and hurriedly wrapped herself up.</p>
<p>She went out of the bathroom and put on a silk nightdress with a gown over it. Tiana saw the head maid who had tied her waistband checking a few times to make sure it was able to be loosened, and that’s when she figured out what the maids were very thoroughly preparing her for.</p>
<p>Well, it’s the first night after the wedding, so it’s important for the servants of the house as well. The head maid, who nodded proudly when she saw the well-tied knot that came out beautifully, gave another maid a confirmation glance.</p>
<p>After all the preparations, the head maid and the other maids finally left, closing the bedroom door. Standing alone in the room, Tiana approached the bed.</p>
<p>It was big enough for two to roll around in for hours and not even fall off. She was running her hand over the soft-looking blanket when suddenly the door latch opening could be heard.</p>
