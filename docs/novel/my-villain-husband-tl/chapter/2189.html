            <p><b>Chapter 26 – Resolution (I)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you acting like this?” Edwin queried, rather astounded. Even the butlers and servants encircling the mansion looked to him uncomfortably. And as the attention was solely focused towards the Duke, he sat consciously, taken aback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. It’s nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss, I see you’re enjoying the black tea.” Marquis Calvino declared, cutting in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pardon?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You look like you’re used to drinking it with honey alongside.” Marquis, who had been staring at her blankly all the while, commented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did the previous Tiana shun drinking tea? Did she ever act too comfortably? Tiana always preferred drinking black tea, and since they often served much of it at their own manor, she drank without much thought. It dawned on her that she should’ve been more cautious about the action now.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Isn’t it pretty common for people to have a change of taste after an accident? It is too late to act like I dislike it now. What’s done is done.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the presentation, she had already decided to put her foot down and grow thick-skinned. Therefore, it wasn’t necessary to act like the previous Tiana. After all, getting back memory wasn’t the objective. It was simply good to know about how the former Tiana used to act; all for her own reference, of course. With the clever excuse of misplaced recollections at hand, she could now change things her way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, Edwin, the people in the mansion, and even Lucius, seemed to like the new Tiana more. However, it was better to stay safe than sorry in front of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marquis Calvino,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as he was slightly suspicious of the drastic change. It’d be more convenient to not to cross the imaginary, yet intimidating line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Tiana contemplated on how to carry on the conversation despite the persistent, lingering awkwardness growing within the already tensed environment, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marquis waved his hand and spoke passively. “It’s been a while since I saw Miss Celeste drink black tea. I wasn’t criticizing you in any way. Please spend no heed and continue. I’d like to hear your take on the situation— especially paying mind to put the rumor at final rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As M</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arquis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> summarized the situation, the stocky, rigid air encompassing the drawing room for too long, gently dissipated. It felt as though Tiana owed him a favor, but she nevertheless pursued on, yet to make her point. “On behalf of our household, my father wished to postpone the wedding due to my own health conditions. However, I heard that you desire to proceed with the event as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re right. To stop this rumor from spreading any further, it’s best to hold the wedding in the soonest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But even that will not resolve the main problem. With time, the rumor may die down though that doesn’t mean it completely wouldn’t be around. This only serves detriment to both our households.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then we simply need to improve our impressions on people— the public. We can start with setting the planned wedding. On top of that, the Grand Duke and I will remain in the city.” Tiana declared enthusiastically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The city?” Marquis Calvino glowered at the unexpected answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana continued to explain the case with perseverance. Marquis didn’t seem content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the Grand Duke and I remained in the city, I’d be able to easily visit my household, which would put my father’s worries to rest. By then, regular as clockwork, I could spend the year here and show the people my ordinary routine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, the family would’ve chosen to go down the territory and socialize in order to gain a foothold. Due to the current circumstances however, all they could manage was reverse the order. The Duke’s colony was distant from the city; rumors from herein would not have bound to reach theirs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the pair could remain near and stop the gossip from unfurling here on out, then going all the way down for prevention was irrelevant. By extinguishing the more urgent flames, the chances of spread would drastically reduce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Very well, what kind of activities do you have in mind?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The house can hold balls and social activities, anything to keep in touch. If we showcase the lack of feud between his highness and myself, and that this wedding is in fact a clear case of success,” Tiana paused to glance at Lucius. “Then the number of suspecting eyes should decrease.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Furthermore, it would allow us a stronger influence in the city. Possibly put the rumors to final rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Hmm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius glanced at a contemplating Marquis, and interjected. “She has a point. There is nothing as effective as this to put the rumors to rest. It would be best showing the community a great sight of us in harmony.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana was surprised by Lucius’ sudden interception, gaping at him shockingly. He retorted with a soft smile. She never expected a helping hand, much less, from him. It was encouraging to notice Lucius’ quick pick-up at Tiana’s intention; a marvelous show of support. His words had clearly worked, as the crease between Marquis’ forehead flattened in ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana couldn’t resist to add on: “If we are to wed successfully, I’m certain you will  gain the most credit for a good reputation, especially with us living in the city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Staying in the city’s estate and being actively involved in social activities to suppress the rumor…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She swiftly interspersed. “Yes. So please allow us to stay at the Grand Duke’s mansion for one year. I’m sure the final decision will depend on his highness, but I do value your opinion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If things really went as Tiana suggested, the rumors would be entirely suppressed. Moreover, it did serve to support the Marquis’ intention, thus, it should be satisfactory for him all the same. Marquis fell into deep reasoning before finally nodding along; the slight scowl on his appearance dissolving completely.</span></p>
