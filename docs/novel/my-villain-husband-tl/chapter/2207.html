            <p><b>Chapter 8 – Grand Duke Lucius Eyal Roderick</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duke Celeste is tense because of the sudden visit. The servants, who are working, as usual, bow when they see the man walking along with the butler, Alfred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is such an honor to meet you, Grand Duke Roderick.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He moves his feet lightly as he glances at the servants with dead eyes. His soft glossy dark hair moves with every step he takes. A handsome face sits proudly against pale white skin. His presence alone is of charismatic appeal, affecting those around him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A maid unable to take her eyes off him murmurs involuntarily. “He is that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only grand duke of the Hartman Empire, Lucius Eyal Roderick, and the owner of the golden eyes. Anyone in the empire would recognize the regal combination of black hair and golden eyes. His face is thinner and weaker than most men. Despite this, his presence is intimidating, and has a unique expressionless face that makes it quite difficult to approach him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His gold eyes are like sunlight. He has an epaulet nestled on a sturdy shoulder past his thin neck. There is a gorgeous golden twin sword brooch on his chest that makes the black epaulets colorless. A sword resembling the brooch of the little twin sword hangs from his waist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid’s gaze inadvertently turns to Lucius’s left hand, holding the handle of the sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Blood, bloodstains…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are bloodstains on his fingers. The maid swallows her breath with a shudder. If she looks closely, she can see countless wounds and calluses in his hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is in charge of the small countries of the east and west, single-handedly taking charge of land wars that were happening in the south. He has the authority and power to threaten the emperor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A senior maid next to her gave a warning to the maid who was staring at the back of him who had passed by.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop being rude. Bow!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S…sorry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young maid hurriedly bows her head at the order of the senior maid. She hadn’t worked there long, so she was still slow on some things. The senior maid feels cold sweat running down her back and looks sideways at the young maids around her. They all knew that Grand Duke Roderick was an unusual guest, so they were nervous and stiff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is Grand Duke Roderick an important guest to Duke Celeste? He was the only Grand Duke of the empire and the fiancée of the Duke’s only treasure, Lady Tiana. The fact that her fiancée had simply visited was not a problem. The problem was his being the Grand Duke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been three weeks since the accident. He must have been pulled here by the numerous rumors that had begun to fly about. The accident had happened just two months after the marriage between Lucius and Tiana was decided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is quite unfortunate that the young lady has lost her memories and caused a rift to occur with the marriage between the two. If this kept going, the marriage could be canceled. It was an important marriage between the two families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This way, Your Grace.” Alfred guides Lucius to the parlor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius enters, followed by Alfred. When the door closed, the servants who had been holding their breaths, relaxed and heaved a sigh of relief. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welcome, Your Grace. It has been a long time.” Edwin bows his head when he speaks to Lucius. Lucius raises his eyebrows at the manner of greeting and bows his head as well. “Duke Celeste. I apologize for visiting without contacting you first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘No, Your Grace. It is I who should have contacted you first. Please have a seat,’ Edwin guides Lucius to his seat. They sit face-to-face on the couch, while Alfred waits in a far corner of the room. After a maid has served tea, heavy silence fills the large space. The scent of the tea spreads amidst the quietness, but neither of them takes the tea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius looks at the steam from the cup as if studying it. “I heard about the accident. Your letter arrived a little late.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I couldn’t get in touch more quickly because I was flustered with the sudden accident. Please accept my apology, Your Grace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are the rumors true? Has she really lost her memories because of the accident?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwin flinches at the directness of Lucius. He tells himself there is no point hiding the truth from him. He had come with knowing. Drawing in a deep breath, Edwin says with a sad face, “It is true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. To think something like that would happen to the young lady… Is she okay?” His low voice is filled with concern making Edwin and Alfred ease up a little. “How is she? I heard it was a horse accident. It must have been serious for her to lose her memories.” His face void of emotion did not fit with his voice that rang with worry for Tiana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, it’s not. Fortunately, the trauma was not too much. She lost her memories, but thankfully her body is in good condition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m really… I’m glad.” With his bent head, all that is seen are his long eyelashes and the glint of his gleaming golden eyes. Only his trembling hands are visible.</span></p>
