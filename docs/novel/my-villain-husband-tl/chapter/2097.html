            <p>Tiana’s head was beginning to hurt, so she asked the maid for another cup of tea. She felt better as she inhaled the scent of the fresh, warm cup of tea and slowly took the first sip.</p>
<p>“I think for now we have to keep an eye on them. If the rumor spreads some more Angelica will soon find out, too. Then wouldn’t she be expressing her stance? About whether the engagement is real or not.”</p>
<p>“She would. I am really curious, but we should wait it out.”</p>
<p>Tiana nodded with a sad and unimpressed look on her face. She also wanted to know the truth, but even contacting Angelica was an uncertain move. Because they weren’t close enough friends to be talking about such a topic like that.</p>
<p>The truth will be revealed once she figures it out. Tiana started a new conversation with Evett, who was quietly looking down at his teacup, and Garnett, who looked like she was full of anticipation.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…it really happened that way?”</p>
<p>Tiana exhaled as she watched the sunset sky from the terrace. Contrary to her expectation that the truth would be revealed soon, the rumor about Rael and Angelica was growing.</p>
<p>At every tea party she attended over the past week, the hot topic among the wives and daughters had been their engagement. Meanwhile, it had spread not only to the neutralists but also to the imperialists and aristocrats.</p>
<p><em>‘Did you hear about Emperor Rael and Angelica del Verne?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘The rumor that they are in a relationship?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Not only that but they are getting married soon!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Oh my! Really?’</em></p>
<p>The unstoppable rumor was spreading in the social circles like wildfire in a dry forest.</p>
<p><em>‘From what I heard from the Grand Duchess, they aren’t in a relationship.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘But you said that the Emperor gave Angelica a necklace as a gift.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘She said they aren’t in a relationship, but she doesn’t know much about the engagement.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Then isn’t it true since they exchanged gifts? It isn’t just anyone, it’s Emperor Rael. Up until now, he hasn’t had his eye on a single lady…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘But the Grand Duchess heard it herself that they are not in a relationship.’</em></p>
<p>Tiana tried to block the parts that she could, but it was too much for her because she had not been able to confirm the facts accurately. If only she could meet Angelica in person and check…</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos, the reason the rumors were spreading out of control was that neither side had expressed a related position.</p>
<p>Rael remained quiet, and Angelica hasn’t come out for a whole week nor could anyone get a hold of her. She didn’t even respond to the letters sent to the Verne Family Mansion, so now Tiana was even more eager to go see her in person.</p>
<p>Not even the ladies at the neutralist tea party she had attended today knew Angelica’s whereabouts.</p>
<p><em>‘Even though Emperor Rael is silent, why hasn’t Angelica come out?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘No way she is preparing for the engagement party…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘She hasn’t even made an announcement. I wonder if she is moving too fast…’</em></p>
<p>All right. It was too fast. Tiana had thought so when she first heard about the engagement a week ago. The spread was too fast because Rael had nothing to say on his side and Angelica was in hiding.</p>
<p>It’s not enough for Tiana to step up and stop the rumor. At this point, one of them had to come out and stop it themselves. To do that, she needed to meet Rael or Angelica.</p>
<p>Should it be Angelica? It didn’t seem like Rael would be willing to meet Tiana. She had also heard that Angelica wasn’t meeting anyone.</p>
<p>If she had someone like Lucius with her she could do it, but he had gone on a business trip to Sinadelli a week ago and still wasn’t back. There was a problem with the restoration site and he had written a letter saying that it would take more time. She will only bring it up with him when he comes back.</p>
<p>Before long, the sun was down and darkness spread across the sky. While leaning on a rail on the terrace to look up at the endless stars, suddenly a familiar form appeared at the front door.</p>
<p>“Huh…? That…”</p>
<p>It’s a carriage! The black carriage with a double sword crest imprinted on the side was clearly the grand duchy’s carriage. Lucius was back!</p>
<p>Standing up after watching the carriage pass through the main gate, Tiana hurriedly left the terrace. She ran through the hall and down the stairs to open the door, and the carriage, still further away than expected, was seen approaching.</p>
<p>Warren and some servants watched her strangely as she was stamping her feet impatiently. Ignoring their stares, Tiana waited desperately for the carriage to hurry up and get here.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was seen waiting from inside the carriage, the horseman picked up speed, and before long the carriage was right in front of her.</p>
<p>“Lucius!”</p>
<p>“…Tiana?”</p>
<p>The door opened, and she quickly ran to him and hugged him as soon as he appeared. He stared at her–surprised by her sudden appearance–but Tiana said in an urgent voice,</p>
<p>“There is something I have to tell you! It is gravely important. It is urgent!”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>As she grabbed the panicking Lucius’s hands and tried to lead him inside, he looked at her with a puzzled face.</p>
