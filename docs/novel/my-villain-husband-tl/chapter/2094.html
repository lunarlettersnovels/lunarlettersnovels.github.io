            <p>“Huh…? I know it came from the neutralists.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Hmmm…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? Viscountess Garnett said that the rumor about their engagement started from the neutralists.”</p>
<p>Could it be that what she had said was wrong? Staring at Alexandra with a bizarre look on her face, Tiana, who hesitated for a second, said to her,</p>
<p>From the information I got, someone from the empiricist side spread the rumor first.”</p>
<p>“What? Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Someone who witnessed Emperor Rael giving the necklace to Angelica said that they seemed like a couple.”</p>
<p>“If so, then that person started the rumor?”</p>
<p>“I think so.”</p>
<p>Tiana wondered when she saw Alexandra nodding. Someone from the empiricist side had seen Rael and Angelica and started the rumor, but was it said that it had started with the neutralists? What had the witness done between the time the rumor started spreading and now?</p>
<p>While Tina thought about it, Alexandra continued, frowning a bit.</p>
<p>“More importantly, do you know the one who saw them? You remember the tea party, right? The girls standing behind Whigette.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I remember.”</p>
<p>“It’s one of them. The daughter of Baron Tiban. She was standing on the left.”</p>
<p>“You mean the one with… green hair?”</p>
<p>Tiana faintly remembered seeing her at the tea party that day. Tiffany, the daughter of Baron Tiban. She wasn’t really a distinctive girl. Just like Whigette, her name wasn’t mentioned once in the original story.</p>
<p>‘Weird.’</p>
<p>Even though the original story had started much faster, there were more changes than expected. Not only the meeting between Rael and Angelica but also the non-extras that were mentioned as supporting roles.</p>
<p>‘Is this all because of me?’</p>
<p>But Tiana had been possessed, so no way things could change so much. The current situations weren’t really going to change just by her trying to change the story. Lucius’ reputation was changing little by little, but he hasn’t done much yet.</p>
<p>The occurrence of all of these unexpected situations may have to be considered a little twisted in this world itself.</p>
<p>‘The difference in the original story started with Rael.’</p>
<p>His acknowledgment of Angelica; their quicker-than-normal first meeting; and the rumors that were non-existent in the original story.</p>
<p>Though it was a novel, this world was a reality. Tiana couldn’t conclude that everything was going the same as in the original story. In fact, wouldn’t it be right to say that it had already changed from the original story since she had become possessed?</p>
<p>However, that part was a tad bit embarrassing because she couldn’t predict what would happen in the future if there were already so many differences like this. Even though the story was already bent out of shape, she felt relieved knowing that she was familiar with the original story.</p>
<p>Did she not have a choice but to believe in her own responsiveness? Tiana felt uneasy, but it wasn’t enough to see it as a big deal. Whatever happened, her top priority was making a peaceful and happy flower path for her and Lucius, so she just had to take care of that. For now, she took it slowly, just doing what she could.</p>
<p>“Whatever the source may be, the rumor is already spreading. I want to meet Tiffany.”</p>
<p>“She isn’t coming out these days. At first, she livelily went around here and there spreading the rumor, but from then I haven’t heard a thing about her.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Allie and Whigette are the girls she often went around with and they seem to be socially active, but I want to say nowadays it seems like Whigette has been gossiping a lot about Angelica.”</p>
<p>“Gossiping?”</p>
<p>When Tiana heard her words, her eyebrows naturally frowned. How dare someone gossip about another person? Did she dare to act like that even after being humiliated?</p>
<p>“But what if the rumors are true? Why is she gossiping?”</p>
<p>“No way this is true. Because even though the Verne family is prestigious, their current situation is dire. She’s going around saying that Angelica could never become Rael’s girlfriend; that she is a better woman for him than Angelica could ever be.”</p>
<p>“…just an extra, but how could she? Why is she meddling with other people’s business like this?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing. It’s just she’s like a thoughtless woman.”</p>
<p>Her true feelings had been exposed under deep anger. As Tiana hurriedly changed the subject, Alexandra, who had tilted her head, confused, said,</p>
<p>“I think she only trusts the family name, but in fact, they are not a big deal outside of their business. Rather, the Vernes are treated like royalty. Whigette’s family history is not that deep.”</p>
<p>“They’re getting special treatment because their business is going well?”</p>
<p>“Right. But her family stole their idea from the Vernes, so there is a lot of talk about that. There are rumors of design theft and them using low-quality material to reduce costs.”</p>
<p>“During the tea party, didn’t Whigette tell Angelica the opposite?”</p>
<p>“That’s actually the opposite. The quality of the Vernes’ products is all good. Whigette only said that to purposely create competition.”</p>
<p>“…she’s a problem in more ways than one.”</p>
<p>In the end, this meant that she had bullied Angelica and her family with foolish jealousy. Seeing that her family had stolen the Vernes’ business idea from the beginning, she might have felt inferior watching their business grow.</p>
