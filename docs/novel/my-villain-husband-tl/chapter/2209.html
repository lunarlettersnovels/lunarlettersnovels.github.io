            <p><b>Chapter 6 – Becoming her Favorite Character</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she wakes up, Edwin calls a doctor for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fortunately, there is nothing much to worry about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so? I am glad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, the after effects of the accident are still there. She has been unable to move for a long time, so her physical ability and immunity have weakened a lot, she shouldn’t overdo it for the time being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The doctor leaves after giving a firm warning. From then on, she is given intensive care. On the third day, she spends time lying down. Her condition gradually improves, she starts walking around a little bit by day five.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After dining in the room, she asks Inabelle as she sipped on a cup of hot tea she had brought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Inabelle. What is the date today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today? Today is March 16th, my lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a week after the transformation. The ‘date’ and the fact that she was being called ‘my lady’ indicated that it was just before the start of the novel. In the novel, Tiana was already married.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking with the maid who is always around her, Inabelle, she finds out that she is currently twenty-two years old and that it has been a month since her last birthday. It was the spring of the year Tiana turned twenty-two years old when Tiana and Lucius got married in the supplemental story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wedding of the duo as she remembered it happened in May. This would mean that there are about two months left before the wedding with Lucius.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was reborn before the start of the story.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had figured out the basic details, but she was still a little unsure about what she had to do to move forward. Luckily, Tiana’s memory remained before the rebirth, so there was no problem with the knowledge of living here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is that she couldn’t remember anything other than basic life common sense. She also could not remember anything about the accident nor did she retain the memories of Tiana before her becoming Tiana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She did not know the reason why she became Tiana and she did not know the way to find out what had happened to her original body. Only her soul was transmigrated, not the body, but she didn’t know if her body was okay because of the explosion.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is my being in that explosion and Tiana’s accident related somehow?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She lost consciousness after her laptop exploded, and Tiana lost consciousness after the accident. That was the only common thing between the two. Both had an accident and were unconscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t know if it was common sense that real people and fictional characters could be woven together, but it seemed like a big deal because it happened somehow. She has no choice but to accept that it has happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news was that she had read the story several times before the rebirth and remembered the whole story well enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wondered what she had to do in this situation; becoming a character in a novel. She had to find a way to get back to her original body. She didn’t know how, so that would not be easy.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should try to find a way to live first before trying to find a way back.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was the most valid thing to do. She thought it appropriate to be aware of reality and find a way to live as Tiana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, she didn’t want to go back from living as Tiana because she was so excited about this. For her, the only other thing she did in her life except when she worked was reading web novels, and being reborn as a character in her favorite novel seemed like a dream. It was a dream she didn’t want to wake up from. Could this be a miracle?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is something that won’t happen again.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was pleased with the situation, although people would say she is being carefree – being Tiana out of all people, but she thought it was a good thing. She enjoyed it. Because Tiana was the wife of her favorite character, it would mean she would become the wife of Lucius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What could be luckier? It was so unrealistic that she couldn’t tell if it was real or just a dream. The pain at least felt real. Convinced that it wasn’t a dream, she couldn’t help but smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About two months before the wedding, she didn’t know how much of the preparations were complete, but she thought maybe she would get to see Lucius, before the wedding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be able to see the character she loved in real life, her heart trembled with excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t see him right away because she was still recovering, but since it wouldn’t be long, she didn’t mind waiting.</span></p>
