            <p>As they entered past the garden and arrived in front of the mansion, the Vernes’ butler and servants were standing, waiting for their arrival. When Tiana got out of the carriage with Lucius, the blanched butler bowed to them with a nervous face.</p>
<p>“Welcome. Grand Duke Your Highness, Grand Duchess Your Highness. It is an honor to have you visit us.”</p>
<p>Talking with trembling lips, he carefully continued while reading their expressions,</p>
<p>“It is with all due respect that we have not been able to prepare because we had not been informed that you two were visiting. As Madam Angelica is urgently in the middle of preparing, I would be so thankful if you head inside and wait.”</p>
<p>“All right. It’s fine with us, so please tell her to take her time.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>The servants standing behind the bowing butler coincidentally bowed at the waist as well. They all looked so pale that they were shaking. There really seemed to be a mistake, and Tiana started to feel a bit sorry for them.</p>
<p>The couple was guided by the butler through the mansion and into the living room. There was a friendly air just like the last time, but the mood was slightly jaded by the servants’ constant over-awareness of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess.</p>
<p>As they sipped on tea brought in by a maid, Angelica hurriedly entered the room a little while later.</p>
<p>Perhaps she had just woken up and hadn’t had the time to dry her hair, her damp hair and different-from-usual relaxed attire stood out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>“I apologize for making you wait. Grand Duke Your Highness, Grand Duchess Your Highness. Please excuse my shabby appearance. It seems that there was a bit of a mix-up on our side. Please forgive me.”</p>
<p>Angelica was so bewildered, bowing deeply and apologizing repeatedly. Saying how she hadn’t meant for it to be this way. It still wasn’t exactly clear who had made the mistake. Perhaps Lucius was also thinking the same, he shook his head and said to her,</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Angelica. I don’t think it was a mistake on your family’s end. So please, calm yourself. Take a seat and let’s talk.”</p>
<p>“Yes… Right…”</p>
<p>After bowing her head with a stern look on her face, she nervously looked around before taking a seat across from her guests. Seeing how nervous Angelica was, Tiana said, making eye contact with Lucius,</p>
<p>“Sorry for startling you with our sudden visit, Angelica. I think I need to figure out the situation first, so I’ll ask. By chance did you get the letters I sent you? I’ve been sending them since last week.”</p>
<p>“I am deeply sorry, Your Highness, but I never received any letter from you. Just in case, I checked all of the letters we’ve received here but couldn’t find yours.”</p>
<p>“Your butler would have received them first; has he checked.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I am sorry to say this, but there hasn’t been a single letter sent from the Grand Duchy. In fact, there wouldn’t be a reason to have omitted a letter from the Grand Duchy… Oh, this is such an embarrassment.”</p>
<p>Angelica and the butler locked gazes. Seeing them exchanging glares made it certain that this situation was indeed a total embarrassment.</p>
<p>The butler hadn’t seen the letters and Angelica hadn’t been able to find them. Then where on earth had Tiana’s letters gone? At this point, it had to be looked at as the letters had grown wings and flew away.</p>
<p>Lucius said, thinking while looking at their flustered faces.</p>
<p>“I think we should look into this in detail next time. Anyway, there seems to have been a mistake somewhere, so let’s investigate it at the post office later on. Tiana, let’s get to the next subject.”</p>
<p>“All right. Thanks, Lucius.”</p>
<p>It felt like the atmosphere was once again organized thanks to his words. He asked again to Angelica, who expressed her  gratitude and was a little more relaxed,</p>
<p>“Actually, the reason for us coming to you so early is that we have something to check with you. We are sorry for unintentionally coming without contacting you first.”</p>
<p>“No, no. It’s okay, Your Highness. What is it that you need from me?”</p>
<p>“By chance do you know about the recent rumors circulating in social circles? It pertains to you and Emperor Rael; that you two are engaged…”</p>
<p>“Excuse me? Engaged?”</p>
<p>Seeing her initial shock at the news, it was likely she hadn’t heard the rumor. Tiana thought, “Maybe?” at first, but then confirmed that Angelica knew nothing about it.</p>
<p>“Even though it has been a week since the rumor started, you haven’t been seen around, so it’s spreading even more. How come you haven’t been seen at any social gatherings? Don’t tell me you’re really planning to get married… Are you?”</p>
<p>“Goodness, no! Engaged to His Majesty..? Never. I really do not know why such rumors are going around.”</p>
<p>She shook her head with the bewildered look still on her face. Perhaps it was the first time for the butler and servants to hear this since they all displayed shock.</p>
<p>“I think someone saw Emperor Rael giving you a necklace. They saw that and started the rumor that you two were engaged.”</p>
<p>“Oh— Don’t tell… So someone did see us then.”</p>
<p>Has it really happened? Angelica’s eyebrows narrowed deeply as she recalled the scene in her head. Thinking meticulously with her forehead wrinkled, she took a deep breath and said,</p>
<p>“I was nervous that maybe some people saw us, but it seemed okay, so I just stayed there…”</p>
<p>“So did he really give you a necklace?”</p>
<p>“No. The necklace was mine. That day, I ran into Rose who happened to be with Emperor Rael; Rose was moving around when she got her claw caught in my necklace and yanked it off… That’s when Emperor Rael found it and gave it back to me.”</p>
<p>“Oh… Then it wasn’t a gift and he only put the necklace that had fallen off your neck back on?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I asked him to give it to me, but he put it back around my neck instead. I was still holding Rose, so I couldn’t say no and had no choice but to take it like that; I had no idea it would start a rumor like this.”</p>
