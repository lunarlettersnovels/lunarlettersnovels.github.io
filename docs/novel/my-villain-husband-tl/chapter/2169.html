            <p><b>Chapter 46 – Sweet Excuse </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh, alright,” said Tiana, uncertainly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You must!” exclaimed Alexandra, “And come holding hands! I will be watching.” She teased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Okay,” smiled Tiana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandra, who was still holding Tiana’s hands, smiled teasingly. Tiana bemused on receiving such a mission. Holding hands with Lucius… They had hugged so holding hands sounded like a simple thing to do, but it still awoke butterflies in her stomach. Holding his hand was that easy but just as difficult. Thinking about it made her fluttery and nervous. What if her hands were sweaty? What if he thought her hands were ugly and became disappointed? To her, who had never held hands with him, it seemed like the biggest obstacle. Tiana felt the sweat already in her clammy hands and an awkward smile formed on her lips in answer to Alexandra’s excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s all that happened…” Tiana was narrating the meeting with Alexandra to Lucius, who was attentively listening to her every word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see,” he said with a difficult expression on his face. He exhaled slowly. “I apologize on behalf of Alexandra giving you a hard time,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, no,” began Tiana, “She was such a pleasure to meet. But the last thing that she mentioned… I don’t know what to do about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A letter had arrived the day after Alexandra left. She had written just one line: Come holding hands in three days.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a character! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana thought. Thankfully, she had given a date for them to visit her. It was urgent for her to inform Lucius about this, so she had asked Lucius to take a walk with her. It was so refreshing to take a stroll while relaying the events with Alexandra to Lucius. She was embarrassed, but he smiled and held her hand. “She’s a little mischievous but I am thankful she did me a favor,” he said, “I now have an excuse to hold your hand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana blushed. His fingers wrapped around hers; it felt gentle and warm. Seeing him happy made her heart melt. “In three days, right?” said Lucius, “Just in time. My older brother and dear mother want to meet you as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?!” Tiana asked, surprised, “The Emperor and the Empress dowager want to meet me?” She had turned so suddenly towards him that her feet twisted and she stumbled. He nodded as he caught her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure,” he said, “They wanted to meet you before the wedding. It’s too sudden, I know. Is it okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes,” said Tiana, “I am just a bit surprised, that’s all. Am I going to see them both together?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No,” said Lucius, “First we will go see my brother, then we will meet dear mother. After that, we can go to Alexandra’s place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, that will be fine,” she said, flustered, “I am nervous.” Thinking about meeting both the Emperor and the Empress dowager together was nerve-wracking. It seemed achievable to meet them one at a time, but no less intimidating. Tiana had expected to meet the male lead of this story who was Lucius’ elder brother Rael. But meeting the Empress Dowager was different. Tiana didn’t know much about her. She had made a few appearances in the original book, but not very much for Tiana to be able to know her. She was uncertain on how to approach the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Empress dowager was also Tiana’s soon to be mother-in-law. The thought made her shudder. All the mother-in-laws in her world had seemed strict and mean. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ugh, I don’t fancy the world of in-laws, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thought Tiana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a splitting pain in her head stopped her in her tracks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you alright?” Lucius asked, concerned, “You don’t look too good.” He gently touched her forehead to see if she had a fever. Then, he held her by the shoulders with a worried expression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am fine—” said Tiana, but before she could finish her sentence, she cried out in pain again, holding her head. “Danger!” she shouted as a force was released from her body, which left her weak. She leaned against Lucius and tilted her head to look at him, but the agonizing pain left her reeling and she doubled over forwards. Lucius tried to hold her upright, one of his arms around her waist. But he tripped over the bush and slipped. The two of them fell through the fence. As he tried to shield Tiana, they fell below with him on top of her. Lucius, who had just realized the awkward position they were in, scurried off her. “I’m… I am so sorry. I’ll get out of your way,” he said, trying to help her up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a clicking sound as the cold water sprayed all over them. Perhaps his hand had brushed the switch at the bottom of the fence. They were quickly drenched in cold, freezing water.</span></p>
