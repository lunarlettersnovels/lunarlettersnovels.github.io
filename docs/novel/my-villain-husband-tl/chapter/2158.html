            <p><strong>Chapter 57 – Tea and Questions</strong></p>
<p>“Meow,” said Rose. The cat stuck its tongue out and gave Tiana’s cheek a lick.</p>
<p>Tiana’s heart overflowed with joy. <em>Did I just receive a kiss? </em>Tiana wondered, amazed. She looked at the adorable feet on her arm and stroked Rose with affection. Tiana felt that her day couldn’t get any better than this. She could give anything to make this cat happy.</p>
<p>Rael, still amused with the two of them, asked, “Are you well now? I heard you had recovered to some extent.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness,” she replied, “I feel loads better.” She didn’t know if he met her just to ask that. It somehow made her feel odd.</p>
<p>“Stay here in the Capital, for now, don’t go down to the estate,” he said, “And take care of your health. You will be socializing anyway after your marriage.”</p>
<p>“I thought that being socially active would put the rumours to rest, Your Majesty,” said Tiana, confused. Why did he care whether she went down to the estates or not? “People are more inclined to believe what they see themselves, with their own eyes.”</p>
<p>Rael walked forward slowly and patted Rose’s head. The cat recognized its owner’s caress and looked at him for a moment. It then closed its eyes and buried its head in the crook of Tiana’s arms.</p>
<p>Feeling rejected, Rael smirked at Rose’s newfound behaviour and shook his head. “Have you eaten?” he asked Tiana.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty,” she said, “I ate shortly before coming here.”</p>
<p>“Well then, let’s talk over some tea,” he said and walked past her. He headed to the small table on the other side of the garden. Tiana followed cautiously.</p>
<p>“How many sugar cubes do you like in your tea?” he asked, glancing back at her.</p>
<p>“Just one, please,” she said nervously.</p>
<p>“How many times do you drink tea in a day?” asked Rael.</p>
<p>“Probably three times, at the least,” said Tiana. This was beginning to sound like an interrogation.</p>
<p>“What do you like with your tea?” he asked again.</p>
<p>“Mostly Macaroons or chocolate,” she said, “But I also eat cookies sometimes.”</p>
<p>“I see,” he said with a nod. He poured the tea for both of them and sat down. Tiana arrived at the table. She couldn’t help feeling that all his questions seemed to be double edged. Perhaps he was making sure that she was indeed the real Tiana. Thankfully, he seemed satisfied with her answers. Why did it always have to feel like a test with Rael?</p>
<p>“Please have a seat,” he offered.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Tiana and sat down with Rose on her lap. She had been so intent on answering his questions that she hadn’t noticed the delicacies splayed out on the table. It was full of delicious-looking macaroons, chocolates and cookies. She saw a pot of black tea and two steaming teacups. She wondered when the table had been prepared.</p>
<p>Rael picked up his teacup delicately and took a sip. Tiana followed suit. She never failed to be amazed at the taste of the black tea. The refreshing taste spread in her mouth, prompting her to take another sip. The aroma filled her head with calmness. The tea was extraordinary. She wondered how they knew what she liked. Had the original Tiana been a fanatic for good black tea? Warren and Alexandrea knew about it, even Rael. It made her feel strange. It made sense that Rael had perhaps met the original Tiana, but had they been so close as to talk over tea? She had no recollection of it. Her mind was blank.</p>
<p>“I guess you like the tea,” he said. Tiana realized that she had almost finished the tea. She did so love it.</p>
<p>“The tea is amazing!” she conceded, “The aroma is perfectly marvellous.”</p>
<p>“I tried to have them prepare what you liked best,” he said, “Have some snacks as well. I especially requested them to be fetched from that bakery you so loved.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said gratefully. She picked up a macaroon and took a small bite. The sweetness was perfect. In no time, she devoured the rest and picked another up. Rael couldn’t help but smile. This was perhaps the first time she saw him smile at her comfortably.</p>
<p>After tea, they left the garden and walked to the palace. Rael led the way. They passed through corridors where servants stood, ever so vigilant. Tiana followed him to the audience chamber at the end of the long corridor. The guards stationed on either side of the door bowed their heads in respect and pushed the door open. Lucius, who was seated in one of the chairs, looked up as the door opened and shot to his feet.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” he said, and bowed his head respectfully, “Tiana…” His voice seemed to trail off. His face was frozen in anxiety. He approached her in a hurry. She could tell he had spent the entire time worrying. His cold hands slipped into hers. He looked at her expectantly. She smiled and gave a nod, to indicate that everything was well. He smiled back, relieved.</p>
<p>“Meow,” purred Rose, who had followed them. The cat looked at Lucius and brushed against his legs affectionately.</p>
<p>“Rose,” called Rael, scooting down to pick the cat up. The cat jumped into his hands. Rael straightened up and looked at them both.</p>
<p>“Let’s meet again next time, shall we?” he said to both Lucius and Tiana, and walked past them through the door.</p>
