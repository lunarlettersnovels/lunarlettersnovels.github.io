            <p><b>Chapter 24 – </b><b>Marquis Egon De Calvino</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since they had left for the Grand Duke’s Mansion early enough, the pair were fortunate to arrive on time despite taking a circuitous route.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After passing through the giant main gate and a splendid, spacious garden, Edwin and Tiana arrived at the magnificent manor where many people, belonging only from that of high nobility, were gathered; dressed opulently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welcome, Duke Celeste and Princess Celeste.” The Grand Duke greets with grace as soon as they both got off the wagon. Behind him, a row of servants on either side line-up, leading through another threshold where they soon meet the respective family members— Lucius and… Marquis Calvino. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duke Lucius reverberated elegance and handsomeness on sight, but he looked to be more determined than the last time she saw the man. It wouldn’t be a wild guess to say that it was the effect of his current mood, as there was widespread tension between the Grand Duke’s family and Lucius himself, soaking the atmosphere. And there was only one to blame for this traction: Marquis Calvino, standing beside on his left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marquis Calvino looked at Edwin and Tiana with eyes wide open. She could easily tell what kind of person Marquis was, even as if she never conversed with him before. With his sculpted cheekbones, and slim lower-jaw, Tiana could perceive a deep, baritone voice coming out of those thick lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana stared back at the sluggish-looking Lucius, who was leaving behind an intense gaze. His bright, golden eyes were remarkably gleaming today; enough to rival the blazing sun.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of husband will he act to be? He’s beautiful. You, Lucius, look like an absolute angel to my eyes. However, you don’t resemble your maternal grandfather well at all. From the hair color, to your eyes, and down the facial features…I am caught between guessing whether you take in more from the former emperor, or from your mother.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana did a mental comparison, and from the originality, she knew that the former emperor had black hair and red eyes. On the other hand, Lucius’ brother Rael, who was also their current monarch, had black hair. Not to mention that he too possessed red eyes; reflecting that of the grandfather’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could only mean that Lucius’ bright pair of golden eyes were inherited from his mother. Although, Tiana had never seen the woman, so there was no way to verify the claim. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, my husband is unreservedly pretty. That is enough.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welcome, Duke and… Miss Celeste.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find it difficult to breathe in lungfuls as you welcome me with those tender, sparkling eyes, my dear husband. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite herself, Tiana regrets not being able to legally call Lucius her husband yet,  for a marriage has not happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Lucius gazed at Tiana, the wonder in his orbs were obvious on whether or not calling upon her by name was allowed; the circumstances didn’t seem to favor it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He spoke in such a soft and gentle voice, and it was more than enough for Tiana. There was nothing else to be desired anyway, as she was already beaming in delight upon seeing him again. The pair would have more opportunities to call each other by name in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an honor to see you again, your highness. It’s very nice to meet you. This is Tiana Quin Celeste.” Edwin addressed, interrupting her deep thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although this is not our first time, it’s nice to meet you too, Miss Celeste. This is Marquis Egon De Calvino.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marquis, who had caught Edwin at a glance, extended his welcome. His gaze was rather intensive, as if serving to burn holes.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You set my cheeks ablaze, Marquis. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana continued to inspect Marquis, not avoiding the vigor of his watch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, he shook his head and turned around. “Don’t stand here, let us move for now. It seems the procedure will take a generous amount of time.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re the oldest, the lowest-ranking member in here besides myself. Though Lucius stood still, he was the first to step forward all the same. This is not good. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he just weren’t her grandfather-in-law, or Lucius’ maternal grandfather at all, Tiana would’ve gotten him out of definite sight. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though you’re his grandfather, how can you concretely ignore Lucius? After all, he has the higher position.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marquis was more of a contradicting personality than Tiana had thought. She could see the man acting only at his convenience. The attitude made her ponder on how Marquis normally treated Lucius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of times Marquis may have scolded his lone grandson clouded her mind. It was also the way Lucius grew conscious around him that she wondered how much of this influence had passed on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiana clicked her tongue as they proceeded to enter the mansion, later guided into a spacious drawing room by Marquis Calvino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marquis sat on a palatial sofa right next to Lucius, abiding the main seat. He appeared to know what was appropriate for himself. This may be an implication that he was Lucius’ right-hand man. It was difficult for Tiana to at least maintain her composure, as Marquis had begun to put on airs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the main seat sat Lucius, while Edwin took the one opposite of Marquis. The very soon Tiana settled on her father’s right-side, Marquis Calvino interrupted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss Celeste, for someone involved in such a huge accident, you look better than I initially expected. Not to mention, wasn’t it said that you’ve lost your memory? This isn’t normal, per se. But you look well, so I guess my worries are cut down.” He sized Tiana up as he spoke. It was becoming clear that Marquis wasn’t satisfied with the situation.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wanted to start a fight as soon as you met me, you could’ve said that.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was such a man, rebuking someone face-to-face. Tiana’s expression, which she had been working to maintain in serene, hardened at once upon hearing the remark. However, she eventually decided it best to stay calm. It was a risk to let go and lose the game; future negotiations would cease to occur.</span></p>
