            <p><b>Chapter 19 – Beginning</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confusion shrouded her mind. How could it be? Tiana hated Lucius; why was she so happy to meet him? She only caught a glimpse of the blurred memory, the details obscured by ambiguity. But at least then, Tiana was not as hostile to Lucius. It was strange, but it could not be mistaken that she was rather excited to meet him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could she have felt deep, burning hatred for him when she didn’t really have anything against him? Even more, Lucius had been a good husband. Though she could only remember fragments of Tiana’s memory, she felt like Tiana had considered him a good spouse… at least at the beginning.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I need to research more thoroughly, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she thought. Given the good memories of their first meeting, there must have been a reason for Tiana’s relationship with Lucius to go downhill in the middle—an event which would be the catalyst of Tiana’s change in attitude towards her husband. But that was something she would discover as her relationship with Lucius progresses. Until then, the priority was to make the marriage a success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She plasters a proud smile on her face as she places a few petals on his palm. “I’m really glad to have you as my husband. It’s good to be in a marriage with you, but more than anything, it’s an honor to become part of your family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius was bewildered, “Tiana…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Moreover, don’t worry and leave it to me. The situation has changed a bit, but as you said, we’re learning each other again. Well… today is the first time we’re meeting to talk about our families’ ties.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However-”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I first saw you, I was happy as if it was not the first time I had seen you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucius’ silence greets her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t you think it’s a good hope for the future if I was so happy from the beginning?” she questions as she gazes at him with softness around her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, you’re right,” he states hesitantly, “I was very happy as well when I first saw you, Tiana.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our hearts are indeed the same,” she says with a delicate smile, “It looks like we are a good match, Lucius. I’m happy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m happy too, Tiana.” He was reluctant, but his words harmonized with her boldness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was doing well: establishing a deal beneficial for the family with their marriage, and leaving a good impression during their first official meeting. It’s not uncommon for people to develop a crush on someone they met for the first time, right? It’s not like she fell in love at first sight anyway. Her actions were only to guarantee their relationship, building a strong foundation—it was a test. Was he really a good person as she had always believed? She must know, because Tiana wasn’t affected by the lies about Lucius. She knew better than anyone else what kind of person he was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she wasn’t yet certain of the reason why she had decided to become a good person, she had no time to ponder over it. Time was impossible to rewind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss!” A shout resounded behind her and she saw Inabelle running to her, a ghostly timing. The fleeting moment between her and Lucius which she forced to create ends with the shadows of Roana, Alfred, and Edwin drawing near. Yet, she was thankful for that momentary chance. Recalling her father’s terrifying semblance, she thought he wouldn’t let her do it, at first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She laughed pleasantly at Lucius, who was turning white at the sight of the incoming four people. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She left a perplexed Lucius, retreating to the dining room with her father. Alfred, who was keeping an eye on both, ordered the maid to prepare tea. She stares at his father as she sips on the sweet drink and begins to speak, “I’m sorry I went out without asking you first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwin’s expression was solemn; he opens his mouth and replies, “Why did you do something so dangerous?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was a guest who came to see me. It doesn’t matter if I lost my memory, I can still meet guests.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, you should have met with him properly. You could have been badly injured,” he replies slowly in an effort to get her to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did so because you stopped me from seeing him in person. I thought you wouldn’t have allowed us to meet if I asked you. And the railing in the mansion is wide, so it wasn’t that dangerous. I didn’t run, and I went down the ladder properly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tiana,” he pleads in exasperation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She exposed her reasons proudly but flinched and bowed her head at his severe voice. Right, she had done all of that, but they must have been surprised. Even if she had recovered to a certain degree, she still didn’t know if there would be other side effects, yet she went out on the terrace from the window. She suddenly understood she had done something wrong, but it couldn’t be helped now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stands up and bows more deeply to show her remorse, and then says, “I understand I did something dangerous. I’m sorry for making you worry. I started to act before realizing the consequences of my actions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re always the same…” he says softly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pardon?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing. I understand. Sit down Tiana.” He gestures with a helpless sigh. Watching his face unclench, she sits down and takes another sip of her drink. Across her, Edwin picks up his cup and takes a sip as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt apologetic for causing worry and panic among them, but it was too early to relax. She still had a mission to complete. As soon as she placed her teacup on the table, staggering words left her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will marry the Grand Duke, so please don’t retrieve your marriage proposal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?” Edwin bursts out incredulously. He probably thought he heard wrong, certain that she would never utter such words. His gaze lingered on his daughter, complete surprise tainting his features. “Why… How do you know about the marriage offer?” He questions with confusion.</span></p>
