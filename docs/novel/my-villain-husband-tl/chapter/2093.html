<p>Even though the parties to which they belonged were different, they must have been compared because the two families’ social statuses were equal—both houses consisting of their respective Count and Countess. Tiana could understand that the Whigettes, a family with no deep history, wanted to follow in the footsteps of a prestigious family and win in every aspect, but they seemed to have gotten out of line.</p>
<p>“Angelica’s social reputation isn’t bad. Rather, it’s quite good. Because she is part of a prestigious family with a successful business. On the contrary, Whigette’s family business managed to do well by picking out only the good things about the business as it was, but they felt like there was no substance. Their reputation isn’t good, because of them being arrogant and acting without thinking first.”</p>
<p>“By the way how come the Vernes’ current situation isn’t good.”</p>
<p>“Well. Suddenly, rumors spread that their business was in danger, but I don’t know the full details.”</p>
<p>“That’s because there is a bit of a problem in their business. Does Rael know something?”</p>
<p>Lucius, who had quietly been listening to their conversation, stepped in. With two sets of eyes beaming him, he faked coughed as if embarrassed and said,</p>
<p>“I know that he is acquainted with Angelica. Someone seems to have spread a bad rumor about the Vernes’ products.”</p>
<p>“Oh my. Don’t tell me it’s Whigette?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details, but it’s probably her. There have been refunds because it was rumored that the materials used in the products were of poor quality and contained toxins that are harmful to humans.”</p>
<p>“I see. But is that really the truth? If it’s a fabricated rumor, they could fully recover from it if the Vernes fully explain it.”</p>
<p>Lucius’ expression turned grim at her words. After much hesitation, he continued.</p>
<p>“…anyhow it sounds like it’s true. Count Verne personally checked and found out that the materials contained in the products that caused all of the refunds had harmful toxins; they’re in a terrible situation.”</p>
<p>“That…”</p>
<p>“He said that the materials were slightly different from those used up until then. And that even the shapes of the products were different from the existing ones. The person in charge of developing and creating the products has been missing since the refunds started, so I want to say that that person is actually one of the Whigettes.”</p>
<p>“I guess that person is the Whigettes’ spy. How could that…”</p>
<p>“Since Count Verne said that person was one of the few artisans who had been selected for the product’s launch, the Whigettes probably knew and planted them. Since there is only suspicion and no physical evidence, it seems that none of the Whigettes are coming forward easily.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“It was Count Whigette who led the business, right? Anyway, he and his daughter are evil! Some father and daughter!”</p>
<p>said Alexandra, furious after hearing what Lucius had said. Throughout the time of listening to him, her expression had gotten worse and worse, unable to hold in her anger; and Lucius smiled quietly and continued.</p>
<p>“Count Verne said the artisan was negligent and had to learn more in detail and manage it thoroughly.”</p>
<p>“Of course, he has to do that as a business owner, but it’s difficult to look through all of the details. He must have looked closely, but I think it happened because the Whigettes planned it thoroughly”</p>
<p>“I also think the same thing. No matter how much money the Vernes have, they won’t be able to monitor the hired artisans all at once. It must have been possible because the Whigettes were determined to plan their work. Because they have lots of money.”</p>
<p>That sounds like ‘A family with only money’. Lucius suppressed a laugh at the thought of them being a worthless family without their money.</p>
<p>Anyway, if they interfered that much, they might be dangerous.</p>
<p>“After hearing that, now I’m worried. They said that they’re preparing for the launch of a new product… Won’t they disturb them again?”</p>
<p>“Right. Rumors are spreading, and it feels like something is going to happen. We don’t know if the Whigettes are planning something in the background.”</p>
<p>“I can’t meet Count Verne these days either…”</p>
<p>“I’d like to meet Angelica, but since she didn’t respond to my letter…”</p>
<p>When Tiana sighed worriedly, Lucius said to her,</p>
<p>“Then how about paying her a visit?”</p>
<p>“What? Visit the Verne mansion?”</p>
<p>“Sure. If she isn’t responding to any letters, there may be a problem. So I think it’ll be better to go see her.”</p>
<p>Tiana only blinked at him. It wasn’t like she hadn’t thought of that idea, but she was a little surprised because she didn’t think he would tell her first.</p>
<p>Was he also curious about Angelica? He might be curious since he had was acquainted with Count Verne, and because she was involved with Rael.</p>
<p>“All right! Go see her, Tiana.”</p>
<p>“But is it okay to just show up without contacting her first?”</p>
<p>“We have no choice since she hasn’t responded to your letter. She will like it if you visit her.”</p>
<p>“She might not even be there.”</p>
<p>“Just go for now. Since we haven’t heard anything about her leaving, she’s probably still there. Should I go with you two?”</p>
<p>asked an excited-looking Alexandra. That was a good idea. Tiana would feel more comfortable going with her than going alone. Right as she was about to nod yes, Lucius suddenly said,</p>
<p>“I’m going, too.”</p>
