            <p>Lucius made a surprised face at the man’s words. Tiana, also panicking, glanced at Lucius, who said to the grand chamberlain with a frozen face,</p>
<p>“I contacted Emperor Rael yesterday but never received such a message. Don’t tell me something has happened to him.”</p>
<p>“His Majesty’s condition is not well, so he is taking a break from his state affairs and resting for a few days. I was ordered to deliver his apology for not being able to contact you ahead of time, sir.”</p>
<p>“… he really told you to deliver that message to us?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I am just telling you what I received from His Majesty,”</p>
<p>said the grand chamberlain as he bowed at the waist. All of the servants came out to the front of the palace to show that the imperial order he had mentioned was real. The elite knights of the imperial family stood in front of the tightly closed door, forming a border with dignity.</p>
<p><em>What the hell is going on?</em></p>
<p>Was Rael’s condition really not good? It was possible since he had lots of duties, but the timing was not good. Today of all days. And it seemed like there was a problem if it was so bad that he had to rest for a few days.</p>
<p>Tiana had her doubts, but no way she could get rid of the knights surrounding the front door. And no matter Lucius’s status, she didn’t think they’d move out of the way as they were just abiding by the imperial order.</p>
<p>As she stared at Lucius and wondered if they should leave, Lucius, looking at the closed door behind the grand chamberlain and the knights, opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“He didn’t say anything else?”</p>
<p>“He didn’t say much, sir; just that you would get a reply soon because it won’t take long.”</p>
<p>“…all right.”</p>
<p>Nodding after hearing the grand chamberlain’s message, Lucius put an arm around Tiana’s shoulder, and the both of them turned around to leave. He stopped a little far away and gave a moment’s gaze at the Imperial Palace, then he said to her,</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s going to happen today, Tiana.”</p>
<p>“We can’t help that Emperor Rael is sick. But will he get better? If he has to even take a break from his state affairs, it must be health issues…”</p>
<p>“He will be fine. The palace would be chaotic if it was a big problem. And you would have received contact from him yesterday on someone’s behalf.”</p>
<p>“Then…”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what the grounds are for all this… But.”</p>
<p>“Are you suspecting something?”</p>
<p>“Since he said it wouldn’t take long, I think he will contact me if I wait a bit more.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>After hearing that from Lucius, Tiana recalled something the grand chamberlain had said. He had definitely said it. But when will that be? If Rael disappears for a few days, more rumors will spread.</p>
<p>‘Don’t tell me… They’re not preparing for the engagement ceremony, are they?’</p>
<p>No matter how it looked, they couldn’t be doing that. Even if they were preparing it in secret, no way it would stay hidden in a place like that with so many people around. Even if Rael could use magic, there was no reason to do that.</p>
<p>Anyway, today was a futile attempt. What a pity to have to return home this way.</p>
<p>After a short sigh, Lucius smiled softly and said, wrapping his arm around Tiana’s waist,</p>
<p>“Since we’re here, why don’t we go see Alexandra?”</p>
<p>“Alexandra?”</p>
<p>“I think it’d be a waste to go back home like this.”</p>
<p>“Oh my. Is it showing on my face? Sorry.”</p>
<p>She had tried her best not to let it show, but still, it seemed that he had heard her sigh. While looking at him awkwardly, he smiled quietly and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Oh no. It’s not something to be sorry about, Tiana.”</p>
<p>“I just feel frustrated because of the rumors spreading everywhere. There is nothing I can do.”</p>
<p>“It is not because of you that this happened. Emperor Rael will contact me if we wait. Then, we can fix the situation.”</p>
<p>“All right. We’ll see. Thank you, Lucius.”</p>
<p>As long as the people directly involved were in hiding, there was nothing they could do but wait. Tiana still felt a bit frustrated, but she smiled thanks to the man who had reassured her.</p>
<p>They headed to Alexandra’s palace to go see her, as Lucius had suggested. Seeing its wide-open entrance which was much different than the Emperor’s Palace made Tiana feel relieved inside, and the two of them entered following a maid.</p>
<p>Tiana still admired the splendid appearance of the Imperial Princess’s Palace. There seemed to be more buildings than the last time.</p>
<p>Arriving in the living room and sitting with Lucius, Alexandra suddenly opened the door a little later.</p>
<p>“Lucius, Tiana!”</p>
<p>She approached the two and she called their names with a welcoming face. As Tiana stood up and tried to say hello, she shook her head and said,</p>
<p>“We don’t have to do all that formal stuff! What brings you two here?”</p>
<p>We came to visit Emperor Rael when we thought of you and decided to drop by before leaving.”</p>
<p>“Really? Anyway, I’m glad you came together!”</p>
<p>“I hope we aren’t disturbing anything.”</p>
<p>“Never! I was actually just bored, so let’s talk together,”</p>
<p>she said with a more vibrant face than normal, perhaps happy that Tiana and Lucius had visited her. Tiana smiled at how cute she looked.</p>
<p>A maid soon brought out some tea after the three sat down. Judging from the smell, it was the flower tea Tiana had gifted her last time. She could feel her tense body just melt as she sipped the warm tea.</p>
<p>“Speaking of, did you see Rael? I’ve also gone to visit a few times, but these days he isn’t meeting anyone.”</p>
<p>“We did not. His grand chamberlain said that he’s resting for a few days.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Is he not feeling well or something…”</p>
<p>Lucius said after seeing her worried face,</p>
<p>“That’s what he said, but I think it was an excuse anyhow.”</p>
<p>“An excuse? Oh, don’t tell me it is because of the rumors… But if he put off his duties to take a rest, the rumors are sure to increase.”</p>
<p>“It might be because he’s thinking about something. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying that because he hasn’t even said anything to me nor to you Lucius… I really don’t know what he’s thinking.”</p>
<p>Lucius smiled faintly when he saw Alexandra with a rugged expression. After a deep sigh, she took a sip of tea and spoke as something suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, Tiana. About the engagement rumor. Do you know the source of that?”</p>
