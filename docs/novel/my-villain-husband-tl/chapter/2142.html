            <p><strong>Chapter 73 – At Long Last</strong></p>
<p>Tiana looked over at Lucius to find him wearing a gown similar to hers, to her surprise. He closed the door behind him, and she watched him as he entered the room, trying to calm her nerves at his approach. His hair was still dripping tiny water droplets as he moved.</p>
<p>“Tiana?” Approaching closer, Lucius stared at her wondrously. Once again, he had come without properly drying off his hair.</p>
<p>A laugh escaped through Tiana’s lips, saying while pointing at his hair, “Why did you not dry your hair again?”</p>
<p>“I was worried you’d be waiting too long.”</p>
<p>“Unlike last time, I will try to stay here longer from now on.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I wanted to come quickly . . .”</p>
<p>Tiana saw a flicker of worry cross his face as he gingerly walked closer to her and grabbed her hand. It wasn’t until their hands touched that she smiled at seeing him relax into the moment.</p>
<p>“But you still have to dry off. You’re dripping water everywhere, and you could catch a cold.” She led him by the hand to the bed, taking a towel from the nightstand and standing in front of him to dry his hair off.</p>
<p>The silly situation made her laugh, making her wonder if he’d ever dry his hair from now on. <em>He’s probably doing it on purpose</em>, she thought. His suaveness really suited her taste. <em>Where did he learn all this?</em> As she was drying his hair, she soon found out that the scent from his hair was the same as her own. <em>Of course he’d use the same fragrance.</em></p>
<p>The product that Tiana had used was for women. <em>But from where did he get it? Don’t tell me he went out and bought it himself</em>, she thought. Now she was curious as to what kind of face he put on whenever he bought women’s products. He couldn’t have bought enough of them to change every bathroom product in the mansion.</p>
<p>“Tiana,” spoke Lucius.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Lucius?” She was still drying his hair at the moment, but far from staying still, suddenly he took her hands in his and attempted to hold them steady. With a grumpy face, he said as he pulled her hands off his head, “It’s dry now.”</p>
<p>“It’s still damp. I’ll be done in a minute.”</p>
<p>“This is dry enough. So stop it . . . please.”</p>
<p>“Lucius . . .”</p>
<p>After taking the towel from Tiana’s hands, he threw it to the side and hugged her waist. Before she knew it, Lucius’s red watery eyes were looking up at her.</p>
<p>With their faces merely inches away from one another, he said in a distressed voice, “From now on, I’ll dry my hair properly.”</p>
<p>“Why all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“Because you’ll become less interested in me while drying my hair off for me.”</p>
<p>“Wha—”</p>
<p>“Look, the tension in you is all gone. Tonight we have to spend our first night together as newlyweds.”</p>
<p>Seeing him mumble those words with his face reddening made Tiana laugh. He was so cute, the happiness and excitement of spending their first night together so evident in him that it prompted Tiana to kiss him on the lips.</p>
<p>She looked at him blankly after the sudden kiss and said, “Do you know how we’re supposed to spend tonight?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it obvious? I’m a man, and I’ve studied it and received advice about it.”</p>
<p>“Advice? From whom?”</p>
<p>“Alexandra . . .”</p>
<p><em>Again? She must work really hard for her brother.</em> Typically, Alexandra didn’t come across as someone who would give advice, but Tiana was very curious about what she had told her brother.</p>
<p>“Then what has she told you?”</p>
<p>“To be aggressive . . . ,” he said almost shyly. He lowered his eyes as his face turned red. Indeed, that would be Alexandra’s advice.</p>
<p>Tiana, this time succeeding at not laughing, took Lucius’s face in her hands, lifted it, and said, “So how ‘aggressive’ are you going to get?”</p>
<p>Lucius did not give an answer, his head still down.</p>
<p>“Lucius?” she prompted again.</p>
<p>He flinched as Tiana slowly stroked his cheek and grabbed his fingers, making him blush even more. After staying still for a while, he finally spread his fingers and slowly undid Tiana’s gown waistband.</p>
<p>Peering at the now-open gown, he could see her body wearing only a slip, and when Tiana saw him staring blankly at the bare full view of her flesh, she smiled and grabbed him by the shoulder to make him lie down.</p>
<p>Looking him up and down, she also pulled off his gown waistband. She blushed at the sight of his naked body and slowly ran her eyes up and down his impressive physique. She was appreciating every inch—the toned muscles, the wide shoulders, the strong torso, even the small scars left on his chest. Surprised that he was not that thin after all, she carefully took her hand to his upper body.</p>
<p>Lucius wiggled his eyebrows and grabbed her by the wrist as she drew along the small cuts over his shoulder bone.</p>
<p>“Tiana . . .”</p>
<p>“I think I can say, this is aggressive. What’s up with your hands? Are you trying to block me? No, I am going to be aggressive today.”</p>
<p>“Can I touch you too?”</p>
<p>Tiana admired him looking at her with fiery eyes. She hadn’t expected this guy to use such a technique; this was advanced stuff. How did he know that just by asking “Can I touch you?” she’d become even more flustered and excited?  He couldn’t have learned that from a book, so it had to be instinctive; truly he was turning to be a man who matched her taste to the end.</p>
<p>When she stopped touching him and nodded to him with her face bright red, the look in his eyes changed.</p>
<p>“Oh . . .”</p>
<p>Weren’t women supposed to wait on men’s instincts or something like that? Lucius, who had been like a gentle sheep just before, suddenly changed his pace and kissed Tiana with such fervor. The tongues rummaging around each other’s mouths were now hot and hungry, entangling themselves as if in a fierce battle. Their breathing became shallower, their inhales sharper and faster.</p>
<p>Kissing her deeply while moving his hand over her slip, he paused for a moment and looked up at her.  Just before he lowered her shoulder strap, Lucius asked in a low voice, “Is it okay if I . . . do it?”</p>
<p>Tiana gazed wonderfully at him and breathed out a slow breath, nodding at his anxiousness and kissing him. They had become newlyweds today, and they would live out the rest of their lives as a married couple. Accepting this man wholly into her was the first step toward their marriage. How could she not accept a lovely man like this?</p>
<p>“Yes,” she affirmed again. “I love you, Lucius.”</p>
<p>“I love you too, Tiana.”</p>
<p>After exchanging sweet promises, their lips found each other, sealing their passion with a kiss. Clinging to each other’s bodies as a child to a lifesaver, they felt the seconds slow down to eternity, and in time they were lost in a fluttering euphoria.</p>
