            <p><strong>Chapter 49 – Earning Trust (I)</strong></p>
<p>“Have we met before?” asked Tiana. The maid seemed oddly familiar.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said the maid.</p>
<p>Tiana tried to hide her own trembling face, but it was in vain. The maid’s hands were shaking as well. These little tremors were the symptoms of the possessed. The woman was also possessed. The tension in the room was evident as she searched the faces of other maids in the room. The possessed one was a target of their hatred.</p>
<p>Tiana bathed quickly. She rose from the tub and walked to the adjacent small room in the washroom. The maids had laid out a new dress for her. The light blue gown fitted perfectly on her. She turned to them, smiling pleasantly. “Thank you so much for this,” she said, “Please forgive me if I have behaved strangely.” She wanted to keep the servants on her good side. If she became the lady of the household, it would be to her advantage to keep a good relationship with the servants.</p>
<p>In the Grand Duchy, they managed the household in Lucius’ absence. With their help, Tiana would be able to learn to manage the household and gain power. However, she had to work a way to earn their trust given her condition after she had been possessed. She had worked hard to show off that she had changed. She had deliberately chosen the Grand Duke’s mansion as the most frequent place to meet the marquess and visit regularly.</p>
<p>According to recent rumours, the servants were relieved to see Tiana and Lucius together again. But they still felt that something was missing in her. Seeing as the servants’ gossips spread like wildfire, she needed to showcase that she was perfectly alright now. The previous possession might have been traumatic to Lucius, Edwin, the Dukes, and Empress Alexandra. She needed to change that.</p>
<p>The maids looked at her in utter confusion. The maid who was tensed and fidgety eyed her with a blank expression. “It must be hard for you to see me and remember whatever I had been like,” she continued, “But I want you to be able to look at me and see the real me.” She turned to the fidgety one, “It is clear you met me before. Whatever happened then, please forget about it. I am different from before.”</p>
<p>She addressed them all, looking from one to another. “As the future wife of Grand Duke, and mistress of the household, I want to lead this family well. For that to happen, I will need your immense help. I want us to get along well.” She delivered her message with sincerity. Perhaps it might not work right away, but it was good to at least make an attempt. It was important to lay the groundwork, to sow the idea first. It was important to erase the image of the possessed Tiana and introduce them to the new Tiana, giving them a sense of familiarity that the original Tiana was returning. She would then have to work to gain their trust.</p>
<p>“Madame…” rang out a small voice. The other maids looked at the one who had spoken. Tiana could see the maid’s indecision and doubt on her face. She could see her internal crisis on whether she could trust her. Tiana waited. “I am Jane Filler, Madame,” said the maid, “It’s an honour to welcome you. I look forward to serving you.” Jane bowed.</p>
<p>“I look forward to working with you as well, Jane,” Tiana said delightedly.</p>
<p>The others, following Jane, bowed respectfully. Tiana was relieved. She met their eyes with a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Tiana was alone in the living room, leaning comfortably on the sofa. She had been nervous during the conversation with the servants. But now, she was exhausted. Her body became stiff, the warmth from the bath was long gone.</p>
<p>The reaction from the servants had been fruitful. Tiana was glad to see any kind of result, no matter how minimal. She leaned on the sofa, staring at the ceiling and around the room, admiring the deep indigo wallpaper with simple, elegant decorations. Just when her drowsy eyes began to shut, there was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>“Ahem,” someone cleared their throat.</p>
<p>“Come in,” said Tiana, straightening her dress, and sitting upright. Jane had said that she would bring in some tea.</p>
<p>To her surprise, it wasn’t Jane but Warren. He was pushing the tray holding a tea set. He flashed her a smile and carefully set the teacups on the table.</p>
<p>“His Highness may take a little longer,” he said, noticing her confused stare, “My apologies.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. I will wait,” she said.</p>
