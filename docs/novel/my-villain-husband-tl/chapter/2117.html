            <p>Looking at the tea in the teacups, Tiana discovered that it was her favorite. Black tea. She made a positive eye gesture to Alexandra, who most likely served the tea on purpose to Tiana’s liking. Tiana felt a little calmer after taking a sip and feeling the fresh aroma in her mouth.</p>
<p>“This tastes delicious.”</p>
<p>“The color and the scent are excellent.”</p>
<p>“And so is this dessert,” said the other females sitting at the same table. Checking out the other tables, the cordial mood wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>The warm weather was nice, and the petals flying in the breezy wind became the background of the garden, brightening the atmosphere of the tea party. A garden tea party fit for spring. As the tea and dessert were perfect, Tiana could tell that Alexandra had put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Perhaps everyone else felt the same way, compliments to the host didn’t stop pouring in. Seeing her take them all in as if she were used to this kind of situation, Tiana calmly rolled her eyes and scanned the other tables.</p>
<p><em>She said everyone on the guest list has attended, so surely… </em>Angelica would be here somewhere. She wasn’t seen at Tiana’s table. And blond hair, which was seen occasionally at the other tables, seemed harder to find. Obviously, because it was a common hair color.</p>
<p>But Tiana didn’t give up and searched for every single person in every seat. Even though blond hair was common, the combination with her eyes was not, so she could easily spot her. Blond hair and sky blue eyes.</p>
<p><em>Oh, there she is!</em></p>
<p>There were two blonde women at the table diagonally to the left of the center table. One of them was quietly sipping her tea; the one with sky blue eyes. That was definitely her. Angelica, the protagonist of the original story.</p>
<p>The evidence was that she seemed to have some indifferent look and distinctive atmosphere around her. The other blonde-haired woman sitting next to her was chatting with the other females, while Angelica kept drinking tea, seemingly uninterested.</p>
<p>Tiana couldn’t believe she was really witnessing a similar scene that was described in the original story. Now that she has seen Angelica, she has met all of the main characters of the original story.</p>
<p>Since they were in the same place, Tiana wanted to say hello. However, she didn’t know if she’d have time since she also had to meet Viscountess Garnett today. She hoped to at least say a couple of words to Angelica.</p>
<p>While she couldn’t take her eyes off of her, Alexandra, who stood up, raised her voice.</p>
<p>“Everyone, please feel free to look around at the flowers as they have all blossomed. It will be fun to see the many interesting and precious sculptures this time, too.”</p>
<p>Interested by her words, the others rose from their seats and began to wander around. Alexandra winked as she saw people flocking to see pretty flowers and rare sculptures.</p>
<p><em>Perfect timing.</em></p>
<p>It was frustrating to just sit down, so it felt good to move around. Since it was a garden tea party, they didn’t have to sit down the entire time, but rather, walking around freely while talking was suitable for the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Tiana also stood up and walked around with Alexandra to enjoy the spring weather. She hasn’t been able to walk since she was always cooped up in the office lately, and she didn’t even know that spring was in full swing.</p>
<p>She was looking at several flowers on the wall when she saw Angelica not too far away looking at the fountain sculptures, Tiana really wanted to approach her but couldn’t.</p>
<p>But now seemed like the perfect time seeing that Angelica was alone. Right when she looked around and was about to go to her, Alexandra said something.</p>
<p>“Tiana, I’ll introduce you to Viscountess Garnett.”</p>
<p>“Oh… All right.”</p>
<p>Of all times. Tiana had no choice but to leave the regret behind. Just a short distance away, a lady with dark brown hair neatly raised was approaching. She wasn’t particularly beautiful, but her red eyes gave her an ominous vibe.</p>
<p>The viscountess, who approached carefully, came out and greeted Alexandra with a nervous face.</p>
<p>“Thank you for inviting me, Your Royal Highness. And grand duchess, it is an honor to meet you.”</p>
<p>At this distance, Tiana could see the color of her eyes more closely. Her eyes were like red crystals. Just like that of a Garnett. Though probably not intentional, she was lucky to have married Viscount Garnett.</p>
<p>Perhaps she had heard from Alexandra in advance, there seemed to be a good vibe and anticipation in her eyes looking at Tiana. Tiana smiled softly and greeted her with a warm smile.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you, Viscountess Garnett. I’ve heard much about you. Your eyes are really pretty.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. It’s the only part of me I’m confident in. I’m married to my husband thanks to these eyes.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, is that so?” asked Tiana.</p>
<p>“They’re the perfect eyes to be called a ‘Garnet’, and if it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t have become Viscountess Garnett.”</p>
<p>Her playful laugh made Tiana smile softly. What a fun woman. Somehow she became curious about the viscount’s path to marriage.</p>
<p>“Not only the color of your eyes but also the shape of them is attractive.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for the compliment. I don’t know what to say after hearing that from you. I’ll be able to brag to my husband when I return later; about how you like everything he does,” said the viscountess.</p>
<p>“Tell him that I appreciate his insight.”</p>
<p>“Then he’ll probably be ecstatic.”</p>
<p>Tiana was more drawn to her for her humble and witty appearance. She felt better now that the first meeting was going well. The conversation was also going well, but then a sudden crashing sound and a sharp yell came from the other side of the garden.</p>
<p>Clank!</p>
<p>“What did you say just now!?”</p>
