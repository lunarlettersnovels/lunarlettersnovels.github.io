            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 49 – Warmth and Romance (2)</strong></p>
<p>Anna found this to be true. Karenin would look very down during rainy days. She never thought on this before. She had put it down to the fact that rainy days made many people sad because of the gloomy weather. But now that Mr. Maillard explained it, she remembered the scrunched-up eyebrows of Karenin when he gazed out the window on a rainy day. Perhaps he thought the rain would turn into an earthworm? Anna laughed. “He is adorable!”</p>
<p>“I think so as well,” said Mr. Maillard with a smile, “And so are you. I was worried about who he would find to spend his life with. And whether she would understand him. But I don’t have to worry anymore. You are the best that could ever happen to him.”</p>
<p>Anna smiled. “I feel fortunate,” she said gratefully, “Alexei is extraordinary. Sometimes I feel like I found a gem among all the stones. I must work hard to be capable too. I don’t want others thinking that such a treasure like Alexei is wasted in my hands.”</p>
<p>“So, you want to try to be worthy?” asked Mr. Maillard curiously.</p>
<p>“Yes, he is extraordinary,” she said, “So I have to try to be extraordinary as well!” Anna smiled at Mr. Maillard gratefully. “I truly enjoy listening to you talk about Alexei, Mr. Maillard. Do tell me more!” she said, winking.</p>
<p>“No problem!” said Mr. Maillard with a wink in return. There was a sudden cough from the study where Karenin was working.</p>
<p>Anna went to the Maillard’s residence to meet Mrs. Maillard, two days later. Mrs. Maillard was in a dress, the color of dusty rose. She had a kindly face and silver hair. Anna could see that she had been a beauty in her younger days. She took Anna to the Flower Room to have tea, which was akin to a greenhouse but smaller. Regardless, it was very beautiful. Mrs. Maillard had brought along Ceylon Black Tea, a polychrome tea set and baked goods.</p>
<p>“My dear, here taste this,” said Mrs. Maillard, handing her a baked pie.</p>
<p>“This is delicious!” exclaimed Anna, taking a bite.</p>
<p>Mrs. Maillard laughed. She and Anna discussed baking. Mrs. Maillard also talked about young Karenin and his past. Honestly, that was all Anna was concerned with.</p>
<p>“He was a very unique child, always polite but very serious,” she said smiling, “He was so attentive and very well-behaved. I think that’s part of the reason why my husband liked teasing him the most. Cade really cared about Alexei.” Anna nodded.</p>
<p>“I was a worried about him. He was too honest,” said Mrs. Maillard, “The societal circle we live in doesn’t care much for truth and honesty. The child was too uptight. When we found out the line of job he had taken, we were shocked. But he has done very well.”</p>
<p>“Did something happen? Asked Anna. She thought that it was strange for a person to change so drastically.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Mrs. Maillard said, “Alexei’s parents died. He lived with his uncle. His uncle took good care of him, my dear. I think the change has to do with his older brother’s death.”</p>
<p>“I have heard a little about it, but I don’t know much,” said Anna.</p>
<p>“I only ever saw his brother once. He was a handsome, capable man. Unfortunately, he was never very healthy. He died on foreign land, away from home. That might have been a brutal blow to Alexei,” said Mrs. Maillard with sympathy, “I understood something when that happened.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” asked Anna.</p>
<p>Mrs. Maillard hesitated. “If this were before anyone else, I would never speak of it. An hour before, I wouldn’t have spoken so openly with you. This is a very personal thing for him. If it was anyone else who didn’t love him truly, I would never share his vulnerabilities.”</p>
<p>“I swear I love him,” resolved Anna.</p>
<p>“That you do, dear,” said Mrs. Maillard smiling, “My eyes may be blurry with age, but I have never failed to spot a good heart.” She continued, “Very well. I realized that that child wasn’t fortunate. He was born in a wealthy and well-off family, but nobody understood him much. His uncle was generous and kind, but he didn’t know how to raise children. So, the death of his only brother changed him drastically. It made him lonely.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Maillard spoke with emotion. “I am truly happy he has you,” she said, “I can see your eyes light up whenever he is mentioned.” Anna blushed and felt embarrassed. “I do love him so very much,” she admitted.</p>
<p>“You are the first person who talks so boldly about ‘love’,” said Mrs. Maillard, “I wish you both happiness.”</p>
<p>On the way to her home, Anna bought a bouquet. She looked for a vase, trimmed the flowers and put them in the water. She took the vase and placed it in Karenin’s office. She returned to her own room and thought about the day’s events. Her heart felt heavy. She thought about Karenin, a little boy when he had had to cope with the news of his parents’ death, and then his brother’s. He must have been devastated.</p>
<p>Anna remembered the first time she had met Karenin. She remembered his eyes on her, his calm and aloof words. She would love him a little more than she already did, if that was even possible.</p>
<p>Karenin returned home. As she was getting off the carriage, he noticed someone walking towards him. It was Anna. She was dressed in a long, dark green, velvet gown. Her hair tightly wrapped in a bun held by the green velvet fashioned into lace. The wind was freezing, and her cheeks were red from the cold.</p>
<p>Karenin scrunched his eyebrows. She was now running towards him, rushing in for an embrace, but he held back. “Anna, you cannot disregard your health like this,” he said sternly and took off his coat to wrap it around her.</p>
<p>The display of affection outside was frowned upon in the kind of society they lived in. Karenin, who was always so dedicated to proper etiquette, was more concerned if she would catch a cold.</p>
<p>“I love you,” said Anna and embraced him. Karenin was taken aback. The butler and the carriage driver had already left. It was only them in the courtyard. “I love you so much,” she said, embracing him tightly, little puffs of white breath escaping her mouth.</p>
<p>Karenin recovered from his shock and returned the embrace. She loved him, and he loved her. Nothing else mattered. The embrace didn’t last very long, she extricated himself and stepped to his side. “Alright. I know how undignified that was for you,” she said placing her hands on his.</p>
<p>“A bit,” he said, “but it was nice.” Anna was surprised. Then she chuckled. They walked hand in hand across the hall and climb the stairs towards the second floor.</p>
<p>The servants maintained their dignified expressions, trying not to smile. The younger ones had their heads filled with romance. The luxurious cold mansion had never seen warmth and romance before. Now, perhaps, dawn was beginning.</p>
