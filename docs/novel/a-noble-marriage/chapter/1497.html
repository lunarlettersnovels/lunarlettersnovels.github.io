            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 55 – The Hardest Distraction (2)</strong></p>
<p>A while later when he finished reading, Karenin smoothed the pages of the book with a paper knife. Glancing at his wife, the movement of his hand stopped. Under the muted candle light, Anna’s face looked beautiful and soft, and her usual bright eyes were closed, only her thick eyelashes still refused to constrain her beauty, spread out enchantingly like a small fan on top of her round cheeks.</p>
<p>The faint sound of paper rubbing together sounded in the air, and Karenin quickly made a record of the bookmark. After the progress was pulled, the plan had to be revised, or the pace had to be accelerated tomorrow. In any case, the rest of the day had nothing to do with reading.</p>
<p>Karenin picked up his wife and held her firmly. He found it strange that someone could trust another person so much, with their full heart, that even in mid-air they could continue sleeping with no fear of the other person dropping them. He walked out of the study, through the corridor, to their bedroom.</p>
<p>If her invasion in his study was evident, his presence in her space could also be seen. Several sets of clothes in the closet were divided into different categories in the drawers with gem cuffs. Basic common books on the desk that he liked to read, soft cotton slippers, and bedding mixed with the smell of the two. The traces and smells in the bedroom had long been changed.</p>
<p>He had long since realized that the changes occurred bit by bit, and he may have not noticed it day after day, until the day he was surprised to discover it. And at that time, the question of ‘when did it happen’ was no longer a question to be sought.</p>
<p>Karenin put Anna in the middle of the bed and carefully covered her with the quilt. She turned to his pillow in her sleep and groped around till she found it and buried her face into it. This little movement caused his heart to flutter weirdly and he climbed into bed with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Good night,” he said and kissed his wife’s forehead.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Since Anna and Madame Masacci got together, Patsy heard that Countess Lydia had invited both of them at the same time. Not to be outdone, she invited Anna again. To be honest, whether it was Patsy or Countess Lydia’s sorority, Anna didn’t have much interest. But she knew that maintaining this kind of social interaction was very necessary.</p>
<p>Mrs. Masacci had been a little evasive about this kind of tea party since the Countess’. She asked Anna and her husband if they could travel together. After Anna replied in the affirmative, Mrs. Masacci also accepted the invitation, but she still was not enthusiastic, just like her husband.</p>
<p>“These kinds of tea parties are a waste of time.” He grumbled.</p>
<p>“What can I see with my own eyes? Except for cheating, it’s about being cheated!” Mr. Masacci bluntly exposed the inner workings of the society.</p>
<p>Mrs. Masacci was shocked too at the beginning her experience. After all, her birth family was barely middle class, but now she was able to be relatively indifferent. However, her husband was still so straightforward that she felt bad.</p>
<p>“Stop talking like that, Freddy.” Mrs. Masacci advised her husband. After all, it wasn’t good for a couple to be so capricious, even if they were in their own home.</p>
<p>“I’m only telling the truth. You reprimanded me before, saying that I must be honest, and don’t assume a hypocritical attitude when we have money.” Mr. Masacci glanced at his wife.</p>
<p>“Do you have to be so mean?” Madame Masacci was a little surprised.</p>
<p>Mr. Masacci snorted softly with his round eyes wide open, and finally gave in and kissed his wife.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear Helen, all my bad habits are for others but for you I only have ten thousand good ones.”</p>
<p>Her husband’s shamelessness once again made her blush.</p>
<p>“Oh, shut up!” She couldn’t hold back her words nor her smile.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the day of the tea party, both Anna and Mrs. Masacci found themselves comparing the two instances. Unlike the traditional tea feast by Countess Lydia, Patsy’s tea party was luxurious and beautiful like always.</p>
<p>Anna hadn’t greeted her cousin yet, but it seemed that there was a mistress in the house. Patsy commanded her well-dressed, high-end servants that were well-trained to serve the guests. She herself wore a scarlet dress. Originally, a petite person like her couldn’t carry this color, but she was born with an acclimatization ability. Her eyebrows were trimmed thinly, her lips were painted red, and her charming and passionate eyes were shining brightly. When men looked at women like Patsy, they often received a signal of seduction. Some young people were more courageous, and relied on themselves to grow courage and come forward to try.</p>
<p>The second son of one of the nobles had succeeded. He became Patsy’s lover and attended every tea party she had. In the words of a baroness, “They even happily drank several times. What about tea!”</p>
<p>Anna knew that Patsy’s lover was at this second gathering. She and her lover went a little further away to play croquet, which was a popular sport these days.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s not very proper.” A countess chortled, and she exchanged looks with the other ladies.</p>
<p>Anna understood what it meant, but she didn’t see the contempt in the eyes of the ladies. Obviously, they didn’t think this was a reprimandable thing. Anna quietly sipped her tea.</p>
<p>Vronsky sat next to Anna again. It was the first time that he had seen Anna’s husband, and he was surprised to see that he didn’t look too young. Although Vronsky had not seen a big age gap between husband and wife, he felt that a woman like Anna should have found a younger husband.</p>
<p>“That gentleman is your husband?” Vronsky asked.</p>
<p>Anna looked at the boy and said, “I thought I had just introduced him.”</p>
<p>Vronsky nodded, lowered his voice and said bluntly, “I think you can find someone younger.”</p>
<p>Anna was a little surprised and turned to look at her husband before turning back to the other person.</p>
<p>“But I think he is the best.” She smiled widely.</p>
<p>Vronsky was a little surprised. Anna stirred the black tea in her hand and put blueberry jam into it.</p>
<p>“Do you want some cookies?” She asked Vronsky.</p>
<p>Vronsky blushed, thanked her stiffly, and left.</p>
<p>Mr. Masacci, sitting on the other side of the sofa said, “Ms. Karenin, who you like very much, was accosted by a little boy.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk nonsense.” Mrs. Masacci scolded her husband.</p>
<p>“My hearing is very sharp, and you know it.” He hissed, feeling insulted.</p>
<p>“At least take care of your tongue.”</p>
<p>Mr. Masacci scowled but didn’t say anything. What the couple didn’t know was, although Mr. Masacci’s hearing was very keen, some people had not only keen hearing but also sharp eyes. What’s more was those eyes were always looking for time and space to see his wife.</p>
