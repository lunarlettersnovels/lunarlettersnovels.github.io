            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 35 – The Peculiar Secretary</strong></p>
<p>Due to his line of work, he naturally received a lot of precious gifts, which were well-wrapped and sent to his house with various unavoidable purposes. But there had never been any gift, laid in his palm so crudely, without any purpose or occasion.</p>
<p>Anna’s heart warmed at his reaction and she squeezed his hand.</p>
<p>“Although I think money is not the measure of the value of a gift, but if I ever have more money, I promise to give you better things in return for what you do for me.”</p>
<p>“Is the money I gave you not enough for your usual expenses?” Karenin asked, frowning slightly.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant. The money you gave me has been very sufficient, f not, a bit too much. I mean, if I make money myself.” Anna clarified, observing Karenin’s reaction.</p>
<p>“You want to make money?” Karenin asked, but he didn’t accuse her of how unorthodox the idea was, relieving Anna.</p>
<p>“I was thinking maybe I could make money myself in the future.”</p>
<p>“I have never heard of a woman of noble origin making money. If you mean by selling their jewelry and clothing, though it isn’t common, there <em>are</em> a few people in the circle doing this.”</p>
<p>“That’s not making money Alexei. I know that most wives do not talk about money with their husbands unless they have no money to spend. But I’m openly telling you that I like you giving me money out of love, but I also want to find a business to make some money. Sometimes making money is not for the money itself, but for a sense of satisfaction, and to realize your own worth. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“I have never looked at it that way. But I accept your view.” Karenin stated in his calm voice after thinking about it for a while. “I sincerely hope I remain your confidant.”</p>
<p>“Of course you will, always.” Anna instinctively said.</p>
<p>She didn’t think she would ever want to do something her husband didn’t know about.</p>
<p>“Besides, I always need your sage advice and ideas.” She complimented him and watched with delight as his ears turned red.</p>
<p>They stayed in France for five more days after that before they had to go back.</p>
<p>As they bid goodbye to the family, Anna felt her eyes water. She had unexpectedly grown closer to them in such a short time. Andre was especially sad and had to be consoled by Louis. When she told Maria her idea about Andre spending vacations at their house in Petersburg, she was moved by Anna’s kindness and agreed that it was the perfect plan.</p>
<p>They reached the station on time. A tall and strong bearded man approached them. His hazel eyes stood out on his face. He greeted them and took care of their luggage while they were seated in the cabin. He was polite but frivolous and Anna found that she didn’t like his reptilian gaze. To her, he symbolized greed, but she didn’t say anything to Karenin, because he told her that Vorobev was his secretary and surely he was not a fool.</p>
<p>By the time they reached Petersburg, it was almost seven. The carriage Kearney had sent was already waiting at the train station. As soon as the train got out of the station, gusts of cold wind blew, making her face hurt due to the cold air even though she was wearing a mink hat and overcoat. She felt her eyelashes grow stiff, and the breath from her mouth turn white.</p>
<p>“It’s really cold” she shivered.</p>
<p>“Will you be okay?” Karenin asked her, concerned for her health.</p>
<p>He wasn’t going home with Anna. There were some urgent matters in the office that he had to deal with.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Anna blinked, “I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Karenin asked Vorobev to go home with Anna and bring back one of his documents.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, sir.” Vorobev tipped his hat.</p>
<p>Karenin helped Anna in the carriage while Vorobev and the coachman bundled up the luggage in it. Soon they were on their way with the clip-clop ringing loud.</p>
<p>Vorobev tried to chat with Anna, using popular jokes in Petersburg to make her laugh, but Anna was not impressed and did not giggle like the other women. She felt his gaze burn into her and felt very uncomfortable. She just knew that her instincts were not wrong.</p>
<p>Indeed, they weren’t. Vorobev did have some peculiar thoughts about the newly wed Mrs. Karenin. He was fascinated by her appearance, although she was not as plump as other beautiful ladies, her dark curly hair contrasted with her porcelain complexion. He thought of her challenging attitude, and how women like these were always interesting.</p>
<p>He had always been the kind of person who paid great attention to appearance. He always was up to date about the fashion of Petersburg, but he wasn’t stupid. He liked to conquer and was more patient than other ordinary people. He decided to make a long-term hunting plan, because Mrs. Karenin deserved to be at the top with him.</p>
<p>Making up his mind, Vorobev turned his gaze away. Anna observed for a while and wondered if she was just being too sensitive.</p>
