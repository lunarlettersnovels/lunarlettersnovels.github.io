            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 28 – The Grumpy Boy (1)</strong></p>
<p>“I heard that there is a very good restaurant nearby. You can dine on the open-air balcony. The maple forest outside becomes beautiful in autumn.”</p>
<p>“But it is winter now, and the essence of dining should be the food itself, Anna ”</p>
<p>“What does it matter? I like to eat under beautiful scenery.” Anna said with a smile, holding Karenin’s arm.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Karenin nodded slightly and agreed to the sudden rise of the proposal.</p>
<p>Anna looked at Karenin’s side profile, his prominent features boasting an aristocratic appeal which is one reason women adore him. His face looked almost scary when he acted indifferent and unsmiling.</p>
<p>Before getting married, her sister-in-law had faintly revealed to her that people like Karenin were too serious and strict, and getting along with him would make people tremble. People surrounding him feel like they were walking on eggshells—afraid that they would accidentally make a mistake next moment.</p>
<p>And Anna can now softly defend her husband.</p>
<p><em>‘Although he is not funny enough and is a bit too sensible, he has the most delicate and gentle emotions at heart. He could understand the thoughts of others easily. Early before he became a bureaucrat, this trait was deeply hidden in his heart.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘A man who works hard for Russia and for work should not be blamed. As his wife, I should show him more of his strengths, instead of judging him with the perspective and standards of others, and coldly joining the crusade against his shortcomings.’</em></p>
<p>She looked at her husband with soft eyes, and after the latter noticed her gaze, he then softly scolded her, “Anna, don’t look at me with such a look as that of a child, don’t forget that I am the older one of the both of us.”</p>
<p>Anna chuckled, and moved closer to Karenin with her hands firmly holding his. As they held each other closely, Anna told him what she has been keeping in her heart for some time now, “Alex, everyone loves your cleverness and wit, but only I love your clumsiness and jealousy.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A fortnight after the dance, it was time to return to Petersburg. Anna thought they would be traveling directly there, but was surprised when Karenin informed her that they were visiting his sister before going to Petersburg.</p>
<p>“I want to take you to meet my sister before we go to Petersburg.”</p>
<p>Anna’s hands paused mid-air, holding her clothes that she was packing. She looked at Karenin who was standing off the far side of the room with a few papers in his hand. He didn’t seem to notice her reaction as he casually continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Louis and Maria live in Cote d’ Argent. They have written to me countless times since our wedding wanting us to visit.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know where that was but it didn’t matter. She didn’t think that was important at the moment anyway. She kept her clothes next to the trunk and sat down on the bed, for her stomach had dropped to her feet. She was uncharacteristically nervous to meet his family. A neon sign reading “What if they don’t like me?” repeatedly flashed in her mind. She had worked so hard to make a place for herself in Karenin’s heart, a place that she wasn’t sure of even now. What if he became closed off to her again after seeing his family’s reaction to her?</p>
<p>She knew that Karenin had an elder brother and sister, and another elder brother who had died very early. She had heard that Karenin was close to his family and had a good relationship with his siblings.</p>
<p>“Alexei, do you think your sister will like me?” She gulped and asked nervously.</p>
<p>Karenin put down his papers on the side table and walked towards her. Observing her anxiety, he placed a hand on her shoulder and comforted her.</p>
<p>“Maria is very loving, Anna, and you’re my wife so she will accept you no matter what. And I don’t think there is any reason for her to not like you.”</p>
<p>After hearing Karenin’s words, Anna was relieved. She smiled as he abruptly turned around and went back to what he was doing as if that one moment of softness had to be balanced with another moment of indifference.</p>
<p>She went back to packing and started thinking to herself. She liked the word ‘family’ and she liked everything about it. Losing her parents at a young age had her cherish it more. She loved her brother dearly and promised herself to love Karenin’s siblings like her own. The thought of having an additional family cheered her up.</p>
<p>They packed up and set off quickly, bidding goodbye to Mr. Binos.</p>
<p>On the train, Karenin noticed the bouquet in his wife’s hands and saw the brightly colored combination of flowers wrapped in brown paper. He must have stared at it for long because soon he heard Anna’s voice.</p>
<p>“I bought it as a gift for Maria. I hope she likes it.”</p>
<p>He just nodded and took out the paper he had been reading, but couldn’t help but steal a few glances at his wife working carefully on wrapping the bouquet with pleated paper, her tongue peeking out of her pink lips. A corner of his mouth lifted and he raised his paper higher to hide his face behind it.</p>
<p>“Alexei look!”</p>
<p>Anna showed Karenin the arranged bouquet. She had attached a note to its front and had tied a ribbon around it. He noticed that her smile looked brighter than the bouquet itself.</p>
<p>“It’s beautiful.”</p>
<p>Her husband’s compliment and his attention on her made Anna blush and a sweet smile overtook her whole face.</p>
<p>“Will you please tell me about your family Alexei?”</p>
<p>“What do you want to know?” Karenin asked.</p>
<p>“Everything!”</p>
<p>Karenin chuckled at her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“That will take a long time.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got lots of time, haven’t we? Take your time dear husband.” Anna said in a soft voice.</p>
