            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 32 – Intoxicated (1)</strong></p>
<p>Andre’s pale blue eyes, resembling a beautiful white Arctic fox’s, were fixed on Anna in astonished admiration.</p>
<p>“You are not like other grown ups, you know. You’re different.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s because I just grew up.” Anna answered with a kind smile, feeling far more at ease talking to these two children than with their parents, who, ironically, were closer to her age.</p>
<p>She’d always been fond of children; they were, she believed, the purest and the most honest souls in the world. Andre, however, wasn’t impressed by her answer. “We are not stupid, you know.”  He grunted but didn’t continue the topic.</p>
<p>“You should go now.”</p>
<p>Anna, who in reality, wasn’t, in the least, offended by his rudeness; on the contrary, she thought he looked adorable as he pouted in annoyance, decided to tease him a little.</p>
<p>“You are a little conscienceless, you know, Andre.” She said in a mock-scolding tone, “after you have made up with your good friend because of my intervention, you want me to leave?”</p>
<p>“We don’t have much time left together.” Andre, feeling ashamed, bit his lip and looked like he was about to burst into tears.</p>
<p>Deciding she should stop teasing him before he begins to sob, she quickly backtracked and consoled him.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry, dear, I was just kidding.” Trying to appease, she coddled him lovingly, gently patting his back while making soothing sounds, causing the two children to blink at her in astonishment.</p>
<p>Andre recovered his good humour within seconds as he grinned mischievously and said, “I know.”</p>
<p>“I won’t forgive you then, you are a naughty boy.” Anna said with a smile. Andre blinked angelically at her and kissed her on the cheek.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Anna grinned, touched.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Mrs. Karenin.” Charlie too kissed Anna on the other cheek and remarked rather wistfully “You are very cute. You really shouldn’t have gotten married so early, should just have waited for another five years.”</p>
<p>Andre chimed in, gravely saying, “Although my uncle is a bit old-fashioned, don’t pin your thoughts on him. Otherwise, I will duel with you, even if we are best friends, it will not change anything. “</p>
<p>“Look at him, he is just naive.” Charlie blinked sadly at Anna. “He loves your husband, Mrs. Karenin.”</p>
<p>Anna couldn’t help but throw back her head and laugh, delighted. She couldn’t believe how cute they looked when they spoke so sincerely.</p>
<p>Andre rolled his eyes. “That’s my uncle. Although he is old-fashioned, serious, a workaholic and no fun, he is still my uncle.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When Karenin returned in the evening, Anna told him all about it. “You have a loyal admirer in him.” She remarked, grinning.</p>
<p>Karenin’s mouth twitched as he struggled to maintain a straight face and finally broke into a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that Andre’s intention was to compliment me at all.” He didn’t mind the way his nephew had described him; he was well aware of the little boy’s eccentric nature.</p>
<p>Anna changed the topic, “I was thinking, maybe we can help them.”</p>
<p>“Oh. How exactly?”</p>
<p>“Whenever Andre is free, he can come over to our place and Charlie too can stay with us for a while. That is, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“That is feasible. Anna, you arrange it then.” Karenin smiled at her as he tugged his tie over his head and turned to hang it in the wardrobe.</p>
<p>Anna wrinkled her nose and sniffed.</p>
<p>“You drank.” She remarked to his back facing her.</p>
<p>“Just two glasses of wine. Is that okay?”  Karenin inquired, sniffing his shirt at the same time. He couldn’t tell if the smell of alcohol was that strong. Those who drink it, never usually can.</p>
<p>“I can bear it.”</p>
<p>Anna didn’t like alcohol and she certainly didn’t want an alcoholic for a husband.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to give you a massage?” She suggested.</p>
<p>Karenin turned to look at her. Anna wondered if he was doubting her skills, so she thrust forward her hands and gestured as if massaging someone; her hands, white and beautiful.</p>
<p>“My massage skills are very good.” She said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Anna, why do you do this?” Karenin asked slowly.</p>
<p>“In the book, have you forgotten how much Skihua liked to drink?” Anna laughed and desperately tried to change the subject.</p>
<p>Karenin nodded, as if he had not really taken it to heart. Anna was relieved when he turned around.</p>
