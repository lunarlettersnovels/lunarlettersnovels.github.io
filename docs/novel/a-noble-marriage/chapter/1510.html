            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 42 – Amendments and Appeals (1)</strong></p>
<p>The moment Vronsky realized that Anna had seen him, he instinctively looked away as if not looking at her would make him invisible to her too, but then immediately he second guessed himself and turned his head to look at Anna again.</p>
<p>This time it was Anna who looked away</p>
<p>A little later, the 13-year-old approached her and asked rather bluntly, “You seem to be dissatisfied with this.” Vronsky lowered his volume as he asked.</p>
<p>Confused, Anna asked, “What?”</p>
<p>Vronsky indicated the direction of his sister’s departure with the tilt of his head and then he shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly, as if testing Anna, “It’s not a big deal, is it?”</p>
<p>What he indicated was a fact, there were many young people putting on airs and graces to impress the others. And although Vronsky had stepped into this circle only half a year ago, he was privy to the ongoing of such social gatherings.</p>
<p>Once he had turned twelve, his sister had deemed him mature enough to be introduced to society. Vronsky, eager to be recognized, had long ago adapted to its ways; even though some things in the circle had astonished him initially, he now prided himself on being imperturbable by any occurring, no matter how scandalous.</p>
<p>Everyone goes through some trials. It was a sad state of affairs for a beautiful woman with both money and status. If only her husband adored her!</p>
<p>A single woman needs to be modest and reserved in her conduct, but once she gets married, adorations from gentlemen don’t tarnish her reputation if they don’t exceed playful flirtations and being famously known as a heartthrob only make her more attractive in society.</p>
<p>Vronsky’s mother had been like that when young, now past the prime of her life, she had long ago, embraced the laws and restrictions set by this society.</p>
<p>When it dawned on Anna, what Vronsky was trying to tell her, she was taken aback, but she didn’t, for a single moment, discredit his information. Vronsky’s devil-may-care attitude was well known to her; she didn’t wish to question or refute his claims, so she just nodded and smiled politely in response.</p>
<p>Vronsky tilted his head and raised an eyebrow at her, in inquisition, his eyes never leaving hers.</p>
<p>“Would you like some cake?” Anna asked, bereft of a response or a suitable change of topic.</p>
<p>She received an angry look as Vronsky answered, disgruntled, “No, thanks. I am no longer a child. “</p>
<p>His face crumpled as he struggled to control his emotions, but failing miserably, he decided to leave Anna’s side to enjoy the party on his own, rather than stay in her company and be considered a baby.</p>
<p>Anna watched the teenager leave and shrugged, before joining the Duchess of Miyahki’s conversation.</p>
<p>She took another look at the direction of sister Vronsky’s departure, and sat quietly, lost in thought for a while, before she finally blinked and picked up a cookie to eat by herself.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At half past three, an unexpected person graced their tea party.</p>
<p>“You really are a miracle.” Patsy said with a smile, her eyes twinkling charmingly in welcome, as they always did for guests, not betraying the fact, that she privately considered Karenin boring and uptight.</p>
<p>Her feelings of dislike were reciprocated and sugar-coated equally well by Karenin who gallantly kissed the Duchess of Patsy on the back of her hand. He despised this frivolous lady but admired her social skills.</p>
<p><em><strong>There was hardly a need to express your preferences, after all.</strong></em></p>
<p>Karenin straightened, his gaze swept the audience in greeting politely, and was quickly caught on his wife’s, whose eyes widened in surprise, on seeing him.</p>
<p>Karenin who had planned to keep a straight face in greeting, the way he always did, found himself unable to stop the grin spreading across his face when he laid eyes on his wife.</p>
<p>“Your Lembreyer seems to be very successful. I think you will become the best hostess of tea banquet in Petersburg next time.”</p>
<p>He gave a lopsided smile and complimented Patsy, his eyes never leaving his wife’s.</p>
<p>Patsy giggled in delight; she loved nothing more than a compliment, whether the object if it be her dress, beauty or tea party.</p>
<p>And while she couldn’t tolerate a 14-year-old girl who attended a ball for the first time in her life; moved by flattery, she always swore that the person complimenting her was the loveliest in the world.</p>
<p>“Come on, sit with your wife and talk to us.” Patsy said intimately, trying to impress that she was such a good host and took full care of the newly married couple.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” Anna asked in a low voice after Karenin was seated next to her. Although her volume was low, her happiness at the sight of him was evident.</p>
<p>“Everything in the Department was dealt with quite early.” Karenin replied, then turned to the ambassador’s wife to answer the question she addressed to him.</p>
<p>Anna nibbled at her lower lip and moved closer to her husband.</p>
