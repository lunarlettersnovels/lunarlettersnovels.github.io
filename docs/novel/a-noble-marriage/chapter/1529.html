            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 23 – A Ball’s Grandeur (2)</strong></p>
<p>“I am quite confused as to which sentence could make you this happy.” Karenin helped his wife rearrange the coat’s collar. He definitely doesn’t want her to be cold and fall sick again. “You have to take responsibility for your own health, Anna”</p>
<p>“Isn’t there you for that?” Anna replied him cheekily.</p>
<p>Karenin’s hands fell back to his sides. “All of us must take responsibility for our own health. As your husband, I will care for you so long as I am with you. However, I can’t be by your side every single moment.”</p>
<p>His voice rang with concern as he spoke again. “It is foolish to plan to depend on another person your whole life.”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Anna accepted Karenin’s advice.</p>
<p>Compared to Anna’s elaborate dress, Karenin’s attire was much simpler. He chose to wear a dark wool suit, appearing very stable and reliable. He definitely looked like a government official at first glance, with no sense of fashion to be seen. It wasn’t outstanding, but there was nothing to pick on to dislike either.</p>
<p>Anna’s eyes slowly evaluated Karenin’s clothes, and Karenin asked her what she was looking at.</p>
<p>“The colour blue suits you well, Alexei.” Anna told him.</p>
<p>Watching Karenin’s eyebrows furrow slightly, Anna said again, “Perhaps you can consider making a blue suit. That will be very nice.”</p>
<p>Karenin buttoned his sleeves while replying, “That would not be appropriate, Anna. My job doesn’t require me to be in such colours.”</p>
<p>“But it would really suit you well.” Anna voiced out with some disappointment. But she quickly threw the thoughts of it to the back of her mind as she wanted to help neaten the clothes on Karenin.</p>
<p>Karenin used to find it annoying whenever someone tries to help him neaten his clothes. In fact, Karenin dislikes being too physically close with another person. Even though he has a number of servants, he prefers doing many things by himself. However, if this person is his wife, then it wouldn’t be good to refuse.</p>
<p>“I am just doing what a wife should do.” Anna told him with a smile. It wasn’t clear if she said it because she understood her husband’s thoughts, or whether it was an unexpected coincidence.</p>
<p>A lady’s graceful and nimble finger made fast work in buttoning up the shirt. Once in a while, the back of her finger joints would brush across his neck.</p>
<p>The neck is a deadly weak area.</p>
<p>Karenin held back his instinct; when he started walking this path of being a government official, his superior once taught him to never ever reveal his weak areas to others at any time, let along let another person’s fingers brush across it this easily.</p>
<p>“But, that doesn’t include the wife.” Karenin added in his heart, and readjust his beliefs.</p>
<p>Anna was unaware of what Karenin was thinking while she was enjoying the process of neatening her husband’s clothes. She enjoys dressing others up and enjoys seeing beautiful things.</p>
<p>“Alright, it’s done.” She declared triumphantly. Her husband looked absolutely handsome in her eyes.</p>
<p>Karenin’s calmly retrieved his gaze. He wore his coat, and allowed his wife to hold his hand while leaving the suite. They sat on a horse carriage and made their way to the event’s venue.</p>
<p>The dinner and dance was held at Mr De Malere’s home. It was heard that all the planning and preparation for tonight’s event was managed by his beautiful and capable wife.</p>
<p>Many was envious of Mr De Malere for having such a virtuous and beautiful wife. And today, the beautiful wife was all the more stunning.</p>
<p>Mrs De Malere wore an expensive rose-coloured silk gown. Her waist was narrow, and her bottom was perky. The folds in her dress appeared as if they were rose petals falling. Her diamond jewellery were very sparkly, and her full lips looked enchanting and a little foxy.</p>
<p>Mrs De Malere stood next to her husband, and the scene was like a beautiful budding rose next to an ugly rich man. When their marriage happened, people’s tongues were wagging; some were envious and some were jealous. Despite that, they all had to admit that up till today, Mrs De Malere had no dirty past or did anything suspicious.</p>
<p>When their servant informed them that Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin and his wife have arrived, many people started looking in the direction of the entrance, curious to know how the wife of this important official looked like.</p>
<p>Even though it was an evening event, the lights had brightened up the venue considerably.</p>
<p>A tall and imposing official with his wife walked in.</p>
<p>Her figure amongst Russian ladies would not be considered particularly tall, but neither was she short. Her limbs were slim, and made her look tall and willowy. Her black hair was held in an elegant up-do. Framed by her fringe, her gray eyes sparkled like gems, and as if all the light in the venue had converged into them.</p>
<p>Her hand held on tightly to her husband’s arm. The crowd watched as the pair walked over; their walk stopped for a small moment as the official seemed to have asked her a question, which caused the lady’s lips to curve into a gentle smile as she answered him softly.</p>
<p>Watching them, the smile on Mrs De Malere’s face disappeared. Her beautiful arc lips slowly turned into a straight grimace.</p>
