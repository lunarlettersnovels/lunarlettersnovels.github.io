            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 3 – </strong><strong>A Little Indifferent but Sensual (2)</strong></p>
<p>“I shall visit the day after tomorrow.”</p>
<p>What could Anna say after the gentleman said that? So, she only nodded with a shy smile on her face.</p>
<p>They didn’t plan to announce their engagement instantly, because Karenin said that it would have a negative impact on Anna’s reputation. Reputation; the man took it very seriously, Anna noted. It was sort of the only flaw in his personality, but it wasn’t a big deal to her right now.</p>
<p>“I will send someone to deliver the visit letter. It is usually sent a week earlier. But because I am not staying in Moscow for a long time, it shall be done this way. I must tell you, I have to go to France on a business trip two days after our marriage. Do you still think it is the right time to get married?”</p>
<p>“The sooner, the better.” Anna grinned, “If you are going to France, can I go with you?”</p>
<p>“That was indeed the idea, if you’d like to. It’s just that…” Karenin paused, “I thought that it might make you think that it is not ideal to hustle into marriage.”</p>
<p>“No, not at all.”</p>
<p>Anna leaned on her cheek. Her elation knew no bounds. She had no doubt or regret on her mind, as if she did not make any impulsive decision or as if they had known each other for a long time.</p>
<p>“I will go anywhere with you.” She whispered in an intriguing tone.</p>
<p>Karenin coughed deliberately, looking sideways.</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m thinking about our residence after our marriage. We’ll have to move from Moscow to Petersburg permanently. If I leave you alone while I go on business trips, it will be hard to get used to.”</p>
<p>“I like how you think.” Anna bluntly complimented him, “A husband should always think for his partner, and show that <em>he</em> needs <em>her</em>.”</p>
<p>After Anna said this, Karenin stared at her for a long moment. His keen gaze didn’t make her feel afraid or shy though. She just smiled at him.</p>
<p>What she didn’t know then was that despite the fact that Karenin hadn’t fulfilled her first request, he had kept her words in his mind. In his orderly world, he would change some rules just for her unconventional personality, so that they, two people of different generations, get along well.</p>
<p>“For the last time, you should call me Anna instead of Miss Oblonsky.” Anna asked again, showing her stubborn side.</p>
<p>“Like I said, I will only change the way I call you after God has blessed our relationship.” Karenin said calmly, balancing her fiery nature.</p>
<p>He stood up and walked towards Anna, holding her hand for a long second before kissing it on the back.</p>
<p>“Be ready, Miss Oblonsky, ‘till we meet again.”</p>
<p>Anna knew he was a man of his word and he wouldn’t back out now. He had a strong air around him, she figured it was because of his political background. His blue eyes shone brightly between his lashes, like a hidden gem. They made Anna’s heart beat faster in her chest.</p>
<p>“I will.” She smiled and tucked her chin lower as she answered.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>The wagons came one after another after that and Anna was seated with her brother, Stiva, and his wife Dolly. Dolly was the oldest daughter of Duke Shcherbatsky. The Shcherbatskys were a respected family in Moscow. It was the kind of marriage that people desired, to be of similar backgrounds, like a business deal. The couple did not get married because of love, but they got along pretty well.</p>
<p>“I noticed that you are in a good mood, Anna. Did something auspicious happen?” Dolly asked.</p>
<p>Before they got married, Anna had been worried about whether she would get along well with her sister-in-law or not. But then she got to know Dolly and realized that her brother’s wife was a gentle girl.</p>
<p>It has been a talk, how Anna Oblonsky seemed like to be another person after her unfortunate accident. Her own personality, as everyone told her, had changed a bit after her recovery. They said she had become livelier than before, and of course, bolder. A trait that had been a subject of concern to her family.</p>
<p>“Yes, tell me what it is, Anna.” Stiva looked at her with the same gray eyes she had. He was almost thirty years old but didn’t look it. He appeared youthful and kind.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say, yet. You will find out soon.” Anna replied, keeping her answers vague. It was not time to tell them yet.</p>
<p>“We are curious now Anna. Oh! You must tell us.” Dolly smiled.</p>
<p>“If she doesn’t feel like saying, then we should stop asking, honey.” Stiva politely said.</p>
<p>He didn’t mean to reprimand his wife, because Dolly was a sensitive woman. Fortunately, Stiva knew how to distract her. He brought up other topics, which made Dolly quickly put the matter aside. Anna didn’t pay any mind to their chatter for she had every second with Alexei to replay in her mind. Even though the sky was dark now, she still wanted to be a bird so she could soar high above.</p>
<p>In this era, in the fresh air, the future was so clear that people actually chased it with so much expectation, filled with joy and hope.</p>
