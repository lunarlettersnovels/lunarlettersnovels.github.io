            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 7 – A Good Start</strong></p>
<p>Madame Tellier didn’t hesitate for a long time. She looked at him and realized that this straitlaced gentleman, who looked relatively harmless, was also undeniably clever.</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of everything,” Mr. Karenin said, making a generous promise.</p>
<p>The madame couldn’t find any reason to refuse. Thus, the day of the marriage was settled. Ordinarily, Mr. Karenin could have stayed for dinner, but he suggested that he had a prior business engagement that he must see to. Madame Tellier preferred a man with ambition than someone who seeks to please his bride’s family, anyway, so she approved.</p>
<p>Anna had thought that her aunt would not let them meet alone, even for a moment before their wedding day. However, she was surprised when Madame Tellier told her that she had prepared the tearoom for Anna and Mr. Karenin to converse briefly to get to know each other before their wedding. This was unexpectedly kind on her aunt’s part.</p>
<p>The tearoom was indeed prepared for them to converse away from prying eyes. Only two servants were present, and they stood attentively in the background. The dense, sweet aroma of black tea engulfed the room, which was served in small, delicate teacups on intricately decorated saucers. They sat down, facing each other with ample distance between them, which didn’t seem even remotely intimate. ‘<em>Even friends sit closer than this’, </em>she thought. But she knew this was all she was getting.</p>
<p>“In two weeks, we will be married,” said Anna with a smile which reflected the joy she felt.</p>
<p>The room was chilly, and it was situated further into the interior of the house that the sun didn’t breach those lofty windows. But Mr. Karenin didn’t need the sun. He felt the warmth in his heart seeing his fiancé before him. Everything seemed fine.</p>
<p>“I hope you will not think it is too hasty,” he said, inquiring.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not,” said Anna, visibly content.</p>
<p>His fiancé wasn’t the demure and reserved damsel that he had just met a while ago, and it made him feel better. He had intended to marry the bold, dauntless girl he had met a few days ago, and she was everything he hoped and more!</p>
<p>“I’ll be in Petersburg the day after tomorrow and everything will be in order. Please don’t worry about anything. I will be there to welcome you at the railway station when you arrive in Petersburg next week, Miss Oblonsky,” Mr. Karenin said, matter-of-factly. Anna wanted to hear him with his guard down, unencumbered with social norms and scrutiny. She imagined what it would be like to have Mr. Karenin whisper sweet nothings in her ear, only for her.</p>
<p>“You can call me by my first name.” Anna said, sipping the tea in front of her. Mr. Karenin was no longer surprised by her upfront nature. He found it fascinating.</p>
<p>He looked at her with his deep blue eyes, and said, “Of course, Anna.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. So, third time’s the charm, Alexei?” she said, teasing him. She had already impressed upon him that he can refer to her by her first name, twice!</p>
<p>“Forgive me, I might take quite a while to get used to it,” said Mr. Karenin, “I have been raised to follow etiquette very seriously. It is a matter of our dignity. We need to tread carefully.”</p>
<p>In contrast, Anna was always straightforward and spontaneous. She didn’t care much for the dully constructed social norms and conventions that seemed to always prove a hurdle in the face of honest communication. So, unfettered by any queasiness, she said, with a smile, “I love how you refer to us as ‘we’ and ‘our’ so easily, Alexei. It sounds comforting and natural. I am more confident in this marriage, more than I ever was.”</p>
<p>“That is as it should be,” Mr. Karenin said with hesitation.</p>
<p>Anna shook her head and said earnestly, “The social conventions, norms, and promises. They are well and good. But sometimes they get in the way of honesty. Not many people can have an honest conversation easily and naturally.” This made Mr. Karenin think and, he was briefly silent pondering on her words. Anna, looking at him with shining eyes, said, “I think we are off to a great start!”</p>
<p>“A great start?” Mr. Karenin wondered. He recalled the memory of being shocked by the letter from Anna two days ago, suggesting a marriage proposal. He wondered if it was really a good start. Anna obviously noticed his hesitation and looked at him, gauging his thoughts.</p>
<p>“It might seem a bit hasty, I know. But believe me, everything will be fine,” consoled Anna.</p>
