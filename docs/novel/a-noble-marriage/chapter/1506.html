            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 46 – The Perfect Christmas Eve (1)</strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, Karenin’s department had to open earlier, so they could be sent home at noon. This day was for festivities and every family was immersed in the jolly atmosphere. When she got up in the morning, Anna got ready in a beautiful dress, excited for the day. It was the first time Karenin would spend so much time at home ever since they had gotten married.</p>
<p>She went straight to the kitchen to see if breakfast was ready. Sasha told her that it might snow in the evening.</p>
<p>“It would be fun if it snowed.”</p>
<p>Anna had always liked winter. Snowfall was always a pleasure to watch. Russia had still been warm when she left and the first snow of the year hadn’t fallen.</p>
<p>“It’s no fun to have a heavy snow, madam. If it snows, a lot of crops will be damaged.” Sasha muttered, but Anna heard her. She walked away and said no more.</p>
<p>She saw Karenin already seated at the table with the morning paper in hand. She greeted him and sat down next to him.</p>
<p>“I seem to have said something wrong. Maybe I should wait for the spring to have a walk in the field.”</p>
<p>“I remember that Stiva knew a man who had a lot of land in the country, we could go if you want.”</p>
<p>“You’re making promises about next year already?” Anna asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Karenin finally put his paper down to look at her.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. In the spring season, I usually go to the German hot springs to rest for a while. We can come back a few days earlier.”</p>
<p>“A trip!” she exclaimed, “There are still a few months left, but I will start looking forward to it immediately.”</p>
<p>“It can’t be said to be a trip.” Karenin replied seriously.</p>
<p>Anna realized why he was solemn.</p>
<p>“Does Dr. Grachev say that you are in poor health?” Anna asked nervously.</p>
<p>Karenin softened, “Don’t worry, it was just a routine check. I am not a young man in my twenties. Grachev said that hot springs are good for my legs.”</p>
<p>Anna touched his knee, then turned her head, “You must not grow old, Alexei. However, he is right and there is no harm in paying more attention to health.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Anna was persuaded, Karenin stopped looking at her, but looked back at the official newspaper. What he didn’t know was that what just happened reminded Anna of her accident.</p>
<p>“I will prepare dinner with Sasha today. I want to learn how to cook a turkey from her.” She reported her plans for the day to Karenin.</p>
<p>“If you think that is fun.” Karenin said doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Oh, of course, Alexei, cooking is such a pleasure.”</p>
<p>Hearing Anna’s answer, Karenin said nothing more. Although in his rich experience, he had rarely ever met a lady who loved to cook turkey in the kitchen like it was no big deal.</p>
<p>After Karenin left, Anna wore a long casual dress that was more resistant to dirt. She went to the kitchen to help Sasha prep for dinner. Lunch would be simpler, after all, the day’s grand finale was the turkey on the shelf. When Sasha tied the wings and legs of the turkey with a thin rope, Anna snapped.</p>
<p>“Oh, poor turkey.”</p>
<p>She reached out and poked the chubby turkey smeared with honey. Annushka chuckled and the cook rolled up her sleeves to express that they were going to have a tough time.</p>
<p>At noon, Karenin came back and they had a simple lunch together. It was their first lunch together in their home and due to the festive spirits, they both were in a good mood and even Karenin was more talkative than usual.</p>
<p>Before long, Kabidonnech, the concierge, came to tell Anna that it was snowing outside.</p>
<p>“I want to see it.” Anna immediately got up, leaving her lunch.</p>
<p>Generally, leaving the table during a meal was considered inappropriate. However, Anna couldn’t care less about proper etiquette at the moment because of her deep love for snowfall. She went to the French window and saw the snowflakes haphazardly flying outside.</p>
<p>Anna turned on her heel and slowly walked to Karenin, her eyes glistening with a smile.</p>
<p>“It looks like there will be snow soon.”</p>
<p>Karenin didn’t react much.</p>
<p>“There will be a lot of snow.”</p>
<p>Anna repeated it again, emphasizing each word.</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>Anna finally lowered her head and sighed.</p>
<p>“Well, forget it. We’ll wait till there is snow.” After she finished speaking, she sat back in her chair, and continued to enjoy her food.</p>
<p>Karenin still looked at his wife in some confusion for a while, and then he continued to eat as well, his eyebrows furrowed.</p>
<p>Why was she so happy because of the snow?</p>
