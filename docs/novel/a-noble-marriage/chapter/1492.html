            <p><strong>Chapter 60 – Tailoring Lessons (1)</strong></p>
<p>No one had taught Karenin about love. People, in general, aren’t taught about it, it is shown to them through small thoughtful things. Parents usually are the first source of love. It is the first taste the child gets of what love might mean. Friendship is another, which demonstrates the diversity of the so-called abstract notion of love. These experiences teach a person about what love might actually mean, for the most part.</p>
<p>Karenin, on the other hand, had none of these things in his life. His parents’ early death and living with his uncle at a young age had left him unable to understand the love of a parent. His own character was of rigor and discipline, having no space to include or learn about love. So, his understanding and inclination towards love was somewhat limited.</p>
<p>When he had agreed to Anna’s proposal, it was more out of curiosity and perhaps even as a challenge than any silly fancy about love and intimacy. But now, when he embraced his wife, the way she fit in his arms so perfectly, it felt as natural as breathing. It dawned on him then that this was love, natural and quiet.</p>
<p>Ever since Anna had come into his life, he was beginning to discover so many emotions that he hadn’t thought himself capable of feeling. Perhaps some had the ability to see love when it came their way, and others remained blind to it even if it stood before them, in all its glory.</p>
<p>With Anna in his arms, Karenin wanted to freeze time. He listened to her soft words, appalled at how well she understood him, as though they were one and the same person. His hands stroked her soft curls, treasuring the feeling of her hair slipping through his fingers. He liked how her hair smelled. The surrounding seemed brighter, and he felt alive by just having her around.</p>
<p>“You are so kind to me, Alexei,” said Anna, resting her head on his chest, in his embrace. “I, myself, think that I am a strange person, and hence, a strange wife.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes, that is indeed true,” he said, smiling.</p>
<p>She laughed. “Maybe you are the only one who can tolerate me,” she said, thinking about how stunted she had felt, unable and unallowed to express herself in her previous house.</p>
<p>“Tolerate!” he said, amused, “Hardly. I don’t tolerate you. I like you being your own spontaneous self. I love it.” He had never felt this way about anything before. Karenin had accepted her proposal because it had seemed the correct thing to do, at the time. Now, he realized it was what he had wanted, too.</p>
<p>Karenin had become the most important thing in her life. He, in turn, had made it determinedly clear that he would support any endeavor she wished to pursue. Anna had decided to learn to tailor. She needed to learn more about the craft than the little tricks she knew.</p>
<p>At breakfast, Karenin suggested she should invite Mrs. Panayotov or Mrs Goldman for some insight on the craft.</p>
<p>“I think Mr. Goldman is an even better person to rely on,” said Anna.</p>
<p>“Mr. Goldman?” asked Karenin, eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Anna, “His clothes are very popular, especially among ladies.”</p>
<p>Mr. Goldman was a youngish gentleman of below thirty years. The clothes he created were very popular among the aristocrat ladies in the area. He also made various styles of clothes for gentlemen. Karenin was of the opinion that the clothes he made were fancy and fashionable, but might be ill-suited for people who work in the government.</p>
<p>“Hm,” said Karenin, nodding. “I have heard that he is very arrogant and rarely accepts invitations.”</p>
<p>“I heard the same,” agreed Anna, “I don’t know if his refusal to invitations springs from his arrogance, but I was thinking I could pay him a visit.”</p>
<p>“It is worth a try for sure,” said Karenin.</p>
<p>Anna decided to give it a try. She dressed herself and took Annushka to visit Mr. Goldman’s tailoring shop. They went by carriage. It had been a while since Anna had visited this part of the street, but they went straight ahead without stopping to explore.</p>
<p>After the driver, Peter, stopped in front of the shop, Anna and Annushka made their way towards it. The shop looked nonchalant from the outside, giving nothing away about the interior. The interior was made of delicate rosewood, with colorful fabrics hung artistically around. Some ready-to-wear garments had been placed inside glass cases for display purposes.</p>
<p>Anna and Annushka admired the place and approached the reception desk. A man was seated behind the counter. As they neared the desk, the man looked up. “Do you want to buy ready-made or custom-made clothes?” he asked, impatiently. No greeting, nothing. He looked at them as though they were a pest in his shop.</p>
<p>“None,” Anna said calmly, “I am here to see Mr. Goldman.”</p>
