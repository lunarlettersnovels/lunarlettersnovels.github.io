            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 13 – A Sensible Thing to Do (1)</strong></p>
<p>How do you even undress in front of the person you like without being so awkward?</p>
<p>The thought never crossed Anna’s mind until today, and she had no idea where to start. And it seemed like her husband was as equally clueless as her— He, too, didn’t know how to strip his wife’s nightgown off gracefully.</p>
<p>Anna cleared her throat. “I think I should call Anushka, and ask her to do it for me.” She said sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Don’t—“ Karenin coughed out, “I hope you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“I-I don’t.” Anna stammered awkwardly as she placed her fingers onto the straps of her gown. Her hands shook slightly, struggling to untie the laces from its knots. It was harder than she initially thought. She looked over her shoulder and uttered, “I should call Anush—“</p>
<p>“No need.” Karenin stopped her. He held her wrist tenderly, and Anna could feel how rough his fingers were. It was calloused compared to Anna’s soft, delicate skin. He rubbed circles onto her soft flesh. “I don’t want you to call your personal servant.”</p>
<p>Anna felt her heart beating loudly against her chest. She bowed her head low, and muttered softly. “Okay.”</p>
<p>Karenin pulled Anna by the hand and led her to the edge of the bed. “Let me see it.”</p>
<p>Anna felt like her hand was on fire from where it’s wrapped around Karenin’s. She could feel his warmth seeping through her skin, making her a little flustered. “You have to close your eyes first.”</p>
<p>“I will.” Karenin answered. Anna felt relieved at his assurance.</p>
<p>Anna climbed to the bed upon seeing him close his eyes. Anna wasn’t sure why she asked him to, but she felt this was the best. She untied the straps, and covered her chest with the nightgown. She scooted to the edge of the bed, and pulled the quilt over her body until only the soft expanse of her back was exposed. “You can open your eyes now.” Anna said shyly.</p>
<p>Karenin opened his eyes. He remained unspeaking for a brief moment as he stared at Anna’s form. He was pretty attentive by nature; his eyes zeroing in sharply on his wife’s bruised waist, which stood out red and swollen against her white skin.</p>
<p>For some reason, Karenin also bore a keen understanding about medical concerns.</p>
<p>He shifted closer to Anna, and lightly dabbed on her skin with his finger. He felt her wince at the contact. “Does it hurt?” He asked in a soft voice.</p>
<p>“I’m ticklish.” She answered so softly that she sounded like a kitten. Karenin was awed by her apparent vulnerability.</p>
<p>He pulled his hand away from her skin. “Well, it doesn’t seem so bad. I will ask the family doctor to come over tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Anna said, who still had her head bent low.</p>
<p>Karenin knew that he should tear his gaze away, but he couldn’t seem to avert his eyes from her delicate skin. He was entranced at the sight in front of him, and it felt like he could hear his demons prodding him to come closer, beckoning him to reach for her and ravish her when a small voice sounded out,</p>
<p>“I’m scared.”</p>
<p>Karenin, who was about to place a kiss on her shoulder, stopped in his tracks. And for a brief moment, he was in an awkward position where he was slightly hovering the bed. He pulled back and straightened his body, coming to his senses as he soothed her. “Don’t be.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Anna muttered quietly. “I’m afraid that I’m not mentally prepared yet, Alexei.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to apologize for that, Anna.” Karenin said, having regained the composure he always had. He stood up from the bed, and tucked Anna back to the sheets, making sure that her body was covered well.</p>
<p>She wound the quilt up to her head as she asked beneath the covers, “Are you.. angry?” Her voice sounded apprehensive, as if she was wary of how Karenin would react.</p>
<p>“It has nothing to do with being angry, Anna.” Karenin answered. Definitely had nothing to do with being angry at all!</p>
<p>“So… you’ll give me some time, right?” Anna asked, pulling the covers off her face. Her hair was a messy pile above her head, but even in her disheveled state, she was still as beautiful as ever.</p>
<p>“It’s not a big deal, and I should have taken this into consideration. In terms of rationality, you seem to underestimate me.” Karenin said. His tone was calm and collected, making Anna confused as to where he stood. She decided to lay it all out in the open.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why I’m suddenly so scared. I think that it’s pretty normal, but I still want to be honest about it. I did say mutual honesty and trust, didn’t I?”</p>
