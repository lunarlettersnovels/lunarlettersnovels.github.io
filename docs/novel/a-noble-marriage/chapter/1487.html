            <p><strong>Chapter 65 – I Love You Now and Forever (1)</strong></p>
<p>Karenin examined the apron in front of him and before he could refuse, the apron was put on him by his wife who was saying, “Although it is lovely for you to cook dinner for me, we shouldn’t add unnecessary workload on Ian.”</p>
<p>Ian was their laundry maid, and Anna liked the tall and slender woman very much. She also had a lovely two-year-old chubby daughter who had a cute little freckle on the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>After Anna tied a bow with the two belts, Karenin decided not to speak and continue his work instead.</p>
<p>Carrots, potatoes, onions…</p>
<p>Anna watched Karenin cut the food slowly but meticulously, and couldn’t help but ask, “Alexei, how do you know how to cook curry?”</p>
<p>“I saw it in a book while reading.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you especially write this down?” Anna asked, really curious.</p>
<p>She knew that Karenin has always been very careful in reading books. He was more concerned about the content of the books that could make him have a good conversation while talking with stakeholders, instead of reading purely for his own personal feelings.</p>
<p>Karenin cut the last onion and his eyes burned a little, causing a faint tear to escape the corner of his eye. He blinked it away as he thought about Anna’s question.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember that.”</p>
<p>Karenin really didn’t understand it, because it wasn’t so important but he still remembered it. It seemed to be something that was remembered inadvertently on a weekday, and then it was too small to be noticed but it was gradually preserved in the constant elutriation of the years.</p>
<p>Anna was a little uneasy, and even in her rich association, she almost wanted to find a rival in love for herself. Now, after listening to Karenin’s explanation, she accepted it without any doubt.</p>
<p>She stood beside Karenin and watched him cook this curry for her. He looked serious and moved carefully, he was even awkward in some places, but Anna felt extremely happy when the aroma of curry wafted into the air.</p>
<p>On the long table, Karenin put the east and west ends up, and then he pulled up the chair and sat in it. Anna scooped up a taste with a spoon and delivered it to Karenin.</p>
<p>“For your hard work.”</p>
<p>“I’m not used to eating at this time, Anna.” Karenin refused, and Anna sent it into her mouth instead.</p>
<p>The curry was delicious and the aroma of wheat bread had turned into a sweeter taste.</p>
<p>Anna ate the food slowly, and the expression of joy made Karenin feel happy.</p>
<p>“You need to eat on time, Anna. It is best for your health.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I will try my best.”</p>
<p>She ate the food and stuffed her face. After she was done eating, she got up to do the dishes. Karenin noted it as a good habit.</p>
<p>They left the kitchen and when Anna tried to walk up the stairs to the second floor, Karenin grabbed her.</p>
<p>“Let’s go for a walk in the garden, Anna.” At her astonished face, he hurriedly continued, “For your health, of course.”</p>
<p>Anna’s shock wore off and she laughed.</p>
<p>Starlight fell on the garden of this house. Although the whole garden was large in area and well organized, it was too procedural, and the owner was not a gardening lover. Anna was thinking about making the garden up well in the future. She was meditating, not knowing that the man next to her has looked at her for a long time.</p>
<p>Anna was now in a light blue dress, which looked milky white in the moonlight. Because it was nearly ten o’clock, his wife didn’t put all her hair up like she did during the day, but let it hang freely and tied a knot with a blue ribbon.</p>
<p><em>She looks better like this</em>, Karenin thought.</p>
<p>“By the way, what about your reading plan today?” Anna suddenly remembered that it was not Karenin’s style to walk in the garden and waste valuable time.</p>
<p>“There is no reading plan for today.” Karenin said.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me more about your childhood? For example, can you ride a horse?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Can you hunt?” Anna became a little excited.</p>
<p>“I will, but I am not very proficient. Your brother is more proficient in this.” Karenin stated.</p>
<p>Karenin suddenly thought of Nikolai, no matter the sports, Nikolai had always been the first.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Anna noticed that Karenin was in a trance, so she grew concerned.</p>
<p>“The question reminded me of my brother Nikolai, who loved riding and hunting. My equestrian is taught by Nikolai, but unfortunately, I am not as good as him. ”</p>
<p>Anna watched Karenin’s expression, and she was relieved to see that he didn’t look too sad. She shifted their interlinked arms and clutched his hand in hers.</p>
<p>“You love him very much.”</p>
<p>He blinked once and then nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes. Nikolai had a deep influence on me. How can I put it?”</p>
<p>They walked on, and surprisingly this time Anna was the listener.</p>
<p>“I always knew I couldn’t compare with him.”</p>
<p>Karenin started his memory with this sentence. Anna was a little surprised, but she didn’t show it</p>
