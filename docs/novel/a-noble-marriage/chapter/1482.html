            <p><strong>Chapter 70 – It’s Inappropriate (2)</strong></p>
<p>“What!” Anna was really surprised. She asked dryly, “What’s wrong with me?”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all. I’m afraid it’s the umbrella.” Karenin whispered, “It doesn’t look like much, but it actually has some value.”</p>
<p>“But maybe he just saw that I was not a poor boy, it was not…” Anna didn’t know what to say, so she made a vague gesture.</p>
<p>“I can’t say for sure till I have more information. But I think he does know. ” Karenin said and then stood up. “It’s not safe for you.”</p>
<p>Anna was silent for a moment, then asked in a low voice, “So, should I give up?”</p>
<p>After that, she looked up at her husband again. Karenin saw that his wife’s eyes were brimming with tears. From a rational point of view, it was certainly best to give up and stop before making a bigger mistake. However, he knew that the she would be unwilling. So, Karenin didn’t reply. He paced slowly on the floor, thinking.</p>
<p>Finally, he sighed and stared at his wife. “I can’t persuade you to give up, can I?”</p>
<p>“We all know that you can persuade anyone to do anything if you want.” Anna smiled weakly.</p>
<p>“But you don’t want to.” Karenin added, his eyebrows screwed up. Ultimately, his thin lips took a smile and said, “If that is the case, there is no need to change anything.”</p>
<p>Anna looked at her husband in shock. She was still surprised by his mind and heart.</p>
<p>“But you need to pay more attention, Anna. I will look into Mr. Goldman.”</p>
<p>‘I <em>will</em> find out the weakness of that gentleman, so if the worst happens, I can deal with it.’ He thought to himself. After all, there was no need to expose his wife to this.</p>
<p>After making the decision, Karenin already had several solutions in his mind. Nothing was unsolvable, but it was his policy to do things with the least time and cost. Taking into account one’s emotional needs was not something he had needed to consider. But now, he did it.</p>
<p>“Can I hug you?” Anna asked, biting her lips.</p>
<p>Karenin paused at the strange request.</p>
<p>“It is inappropriate.” He replied with a straight face.</p>
<p>However, he blushed in his heart. He could now accept proper intimate contact with his wife in a private place. But “bed” wasn’t a private place, it was a forbidden place. It meant more than just hugging, and Karenin was not sure whether he could really do it well. Anna didn’t have these concerns. In fact, from another point of view, the wanton behavior of Mrs. Karenin was mostly caused by her husband who didn’t like to control his wife.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the request for hugging was rejected, Mrs. Karenin blinked and changed her request to something even more.</p>
<p>“Then, can I kiss you?”</p>
<p>At last, Karenin couldn’t help it, and his ears were stained pink.</p>
<p>“It is inappropriate too.” He repeated but this time found it a bit difficult to refuse.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Anna answered and lowered her eyes as she thought about something. Then she got out of the bed and padded barefoot to where her husband stood. Holding his uniform neckline with both hands, and with a little effort to raise herself on her tiptoes, she kissed him directly on the lips, omitting the step of asking for permission.</p>
<p>As it was a proven fact that actions speak louder than words.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>They didn’t miss dinner because Karenin had woken Anna up at the right time. Anna went to bed early after that. Karenin handled his official documents waiting to be reviewed in the study. He also read an article recommended by Countess Lydia. Karenin knew that Countess Lydia had implied that he would give them some favorable decision. After examining it, he drafted a letter. Although Karenin didn’t really think that the women’s group headed by Countess Lydia could really have any effect, he didn’t dismiss it.</p>
<p>After replying to Countess Lydia, Karenin picked up a book called “Poems of Hell”, cut it out with a paper knife and read it one by one, and finally put a bookmark on the seventh page. Karenin put away the documents and books, folded his hands over his stomach, and thought for a while. Before leaving the study, he came to a decision about the situation regarding Anna.</p>
<p>When he came to the bedroom, there was a glow from a small lamp placed far away, while the hostess of the bedroom had turned her head to the other side to avoid the light. Karenin blew out the candlelight before coming to sit on the edge of the bed. It seemed that the frequency of this action testified to the change in his habits.</p>
<p>He raised his hand and caressed his wife’s cheek. After feeling the soft skin, he slipped down to her thin delicate fingers, rubbing her digits with his thumb, and finally rested it at the small knuckles.</p>
<p>‘Half a day’s handling actions naturally won’t leave any marks.’ He thought.</p>
<p>Karenin withdrew his hand after his examination. He took off his clothes and then lay down in the bedding next to her. He could not see his wife’s face clearly in the dark, but he firmly took hold of her.</p>
<p>“These hands should never become rough.” Karenin whispered, and it took about ten minutes to close his eyes and fall asleep.</p>
<p>Russia always woke up late in winter, but Mr. Goldman had asked to come to the shop so early. So, Anna woke up at five o’clock. She thought her hands and feet were light enough, but she obviously woke Karenin up.</p>
<p>“You go to sleep, Alexei.” Anna said softly, and pressed a kiss to the corner of his mouth.</p>
