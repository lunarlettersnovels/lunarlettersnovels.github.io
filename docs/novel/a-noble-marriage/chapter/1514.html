            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 38 – The Oddity In His Study (1)</strong></p>
<p>Annushka handed Anna an invitation. After reading it, Anna knew who she had to ask for help. Seated at the table for breakfast, she brought up the topic in front of Karenin.</p>
<p>“Alexei, I received an invitation from my cousin Patsy for an afternoon tea party hosted by her the day after tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. Since we’re back now, you should also start a new social life in Petersburg.” Karenin replied, not realizing what his wife was hinting at.</p>
<p>Anna gave up being sly and said directly, “I need your help.”</p>
<p>Karenin looked up, slightly confused.</p>
<p>“You know, I had an accident, and I didn’t go out much after that. My social life was in hiatus, and on top of that I am in Petersburg now instead of Moscow.” Anna paused and continued, “I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to present myself perfectly this tea party well.”</p>
<p>Karenin completely stopped his action of cutting the meat on his plate. Tea parties was not his field of expertise. In fact, it could be said that this was a field he didn’t even want to be an expert in.</p>
<p>“You have to help me please. I hope you can tell me about all the rules and recent relations when you get home today.” Anna emphasized the word ‘relations’ because in their circle, it was necessary to master everyone’s information circle.</p>
<p>She looked at him with those big eyes again and he sighed.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back on time.” Karenin said.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much” Anna beamed at him and ate a mouthful of waffles happily.</p>
<p>At four o’clock in the afternoon, Karenin came back from his office on time. There were no guests waiting to be interviewed in his visiting study. Under normal circumstances, the sofa there was never vacant. But today while leaving in the morning, he had told Kearney that there would be no visitors today.</p>
<p>Despite his surprise, the loyal old housekeeper hadn’t asked any questions, and had faithfully fulfilled his master’s orders.</p>
<p>Too late to change out of his uniform, Karenin went directly to Anna’s bedroom, or <em>their</em> bedroom. Although his own bedroom was still kept in the same condition, he had almost completely ignored his big but hard bed.</p>
<p>“Come to my study, Anna.” Karenin said.</p>
<p>Anna noted he was still wearing his uniform with a medal on it. Maybe he needed to meet some diplomatic envoys in the department today. She knew Karenin has won several excellent medals, but he didn’t wear them every day, and usually only uses them on important occasions. She was happy he had arrived home early for her. Just because he had promised her.</p>
<p>Anna couldn’t stop smiling as she almost trotted towards Karenin with joy, then pulled his hand.</p>
<p>“You will always do what you promise me, won’t you?”</p>
<p>“Until I can, yes.”</p>
<p>Although he didn’t quite understand why his wife asked this question, Karenin answered her truthfully, and then he got rewarded with a kiss on the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>“You look good in your uniform.” She said with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>Karenin looked at her, then gently moved away, as if he was shy. Anna looked at his ears and seeing their color, she looked away to hide her smiled. She didn’t know the person she thought was embarrassed, was now looking at her again.</p>
<p>She looked around his study and was surprised to see that Karenin had two study rooms. One for receiving some guests, and the other for reading. The study for receiving guests had luxurious sofas, which were inclined towards each other for easier conversations. His own study for reading was very simple, even slightly monotonous.</p>
<p>Two rows of large bookshelves occupied almost two walls. There was a desk made of rosewood by the window, which was simply painted. From the small scratches on the edges, it seemed to have been used for some years, and it could be seen that the owner cherished it very much.</p>
<p>A square chair, which didn’t even have a cushion for leaning on, stood behind it. She imagined it would not be easy to doze off when sitting on it. The whole study justified the meaning of its name, just a place to study or read.</p>
<p>Although there was plenty of sunshine, there was nothing soft. Except for a round teacup on Karenin’s table. It was the only thing in this place that had no edges and corners. It was originally ordinary, but now it seemed a little valuable.</p>
<p>“There is only one chair.” Anna pointed it out.</p>
<p>Karenin realized that he wasn’t thinking well. He tried to ring the bell and ask the servant to send a chair, but Anna stopped him.</p>
<p>“My bedroom has a stool.” She said and before Karenin said anything, she ran out to her room to get her fluffy stool.</p>
