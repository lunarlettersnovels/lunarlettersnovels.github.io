            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 4 – A Suitable Marriage</strong></p>
<p>At ten o’clock the next morning, Karenin’s letter of visit was delivered on the Oblonsky manor.</p>
<p>“Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin?”</p>
<p>Anna’s aunt, the Duchess of Tellier was a stern woman. She was slightly curvy and her beautiful face was always cold and harsh. Anna thought her coldness was very different from Karenin. The Duchess of Tellier was like a machine, and her function was to maintain the honor of the family. So, she had arranged for Stiva to marry the eldest daughter of Duke Shcherbatsky. She was still planning to arrange Anna’s marriage, but now, something seemed to have changed. As long as there was still a girl to be married in the family, the answer is obvious if any gentleman with a decent background comes to visit.</p>
<p>“Anna, do you know this Mr. Karenin?”</p>
<p>Duchess Tellier knew Karenin. Even though she was just a widow who lost her husband in her early years, she had always known all the renowned political people.</p>
<p>“We had a conversation at the ball yesterday.” Anna replied nervously.</p>
<p>There was nothing else she could give away. The old lady was not the easiest person to get along with and Anna didn’t want herself to be involved in a series of explanations.</p>
<p>The Duchess asked a servant to bring her monocle, and then read the invitation letter carefully. Half an hour later, she asked her servant to send a reply letter to Karenin’s place. During this period, she didn’t speak to Anna, even if the center of their discussion was mainly about her. She was not in the habit of discussing her decisions with others. In addition, Anna and Stiva’s parents died young. She was in charge of everything. She did not intend to tell Stiva about it, but her own grandson and granddaughter slipped the secret out.</p>
<p>“Aunt Anna is getting married!” The two naughty kids were clamoring, and Anna’s cheeks flushed immediately.</p>
<p>“Stop spouting nonsense, children.” Dolly said. Having squeezed some reaction from the adults, the two children found their taunts effective, so they repeated it even more.</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Stiva scolded the children in a booming loud voice.</p>
<p>This put a stop to the clamour instantly, but the regained silence only lasted for a little while, for the children started crying loudly soon after. They went to their mother one by one to complain and hid behind her skirt.</p>
<p>Stiva ignored the two children, and looked at Anna, “What in the blazes is going on?” He wasn’t angry at her, but still irritated.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, maybe you should ask Auntie.” Anna said softly.</p>
<p>“Of course, I will ask her.” Stiva murmured, and then went into the study, leaving Dolly and Anna to themselves.</p>
<p>Dolly, being a woman, was more careful in approaching Anna. “If I’m not mistaken, Mr. Karenin may have come to propose.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.” Anna said deliberately and reservedly.</p>
<p>Dolly knew she shouldn’t ask, but she couldn’t help it and said, “If it’s true, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“It won’t be too bad. He is a rare gentleman.”</p>
<p>Hearing Anna’s answer, Dolly didn’t say anything else. She didn’t analyze whether Anna’s words were from the heart or just reluctant. After all, judging from the backgrounds of the couple, this was a suitable marriage. It was just the fourteen-year difference between Anna and the gentleman that made her feel a little better about her own marriage.</p>
<p>Stiva came out after a short while, looking a little upset. Maybe he was scolded. He looked at his sister.</p>
<p>Anna stepped forward and smiled, “Don’t frown, Stiva.”</p>
<p>“Anna, would you like to accept this?!” He said incredulously. His concern for his younger sister only growing by the second.</p>
<p>“Stiva!” Dolly whispered, trying to stop her husband from saying something so blunt.</p>
<p>Once a woman was married, no matter whether the man was good or bad, she would always put the man in her protection, ignoring the fact that he may not be good. In this light, Dolly was a bit different. She would reprimand Stiva if necessary.</p>
<p>“Let’s just wait for tomorrow, alright Stiva?” Anna said sincerely.</p>
<p>Stiva had nothing against his sister, so he could only grumble silently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Literally burning the midnight oil at his desk, the man pressed his right hand on the paper. His half-closed eyes looked at the piece of parchment, and at the end, he smiled. He picked up his quill and wrote on the paper again. The scratching sound on his parchment seemed to be done with drunkenness, and in this night, it all became more intoxicating…</p>
