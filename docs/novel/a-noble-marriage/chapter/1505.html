            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 47 – The Perfect Christmas Eve (2)</strong></p>
<p>In the afternoon, Karenin stayed in his study to deal with some government affairs. Maybe ordinary officials could relax on this day, but there were always various things Karenin had to deal with, and Anna had no problem with this. She had her own things to take care of. And in fact, she would be more worried if Karenin suddenly stopped working so diligently.</p>
<p>“Madam, is this the one?”</p>
<p>Anna looked up and smiled. Annushka found out what Anna wanted from her dowry. It was a leather piece, golden brown fox skin, a gift from Stiva.</p>
<p>“Yes, this is it.” Anna nodded, then she painted the paper with alterations, and gestured to Annushka, indicating that she needed to make it like that.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like this.” Annushka was a little surprised.</p>
<p>“In colder places, hunters like to use such knee pads to resist the cold.” Anna explained, lest Annushka continue to ask this question.</p>
<p>“It is beautiful, madam.”</p>
<p>Anna gave the things to Annushka. Although she was a bit talented in designing and alterations, she needed to learn how to sew from scratch. Besides, Annushka had great craftsmanship. Maybe she’ll learn from her later, for gifts made by one’s own hand held more value.</p>
<p>She waited until it was almost seven o’clock after dinner, and the snow had formed a thick layer. She dragged Karenin into the yard from his study.</p>
<p>“Let’s play with snow!” she shook his arm.</p>
<p>“Anna, it’s getting late, and it’s too cold, you may get sick.” He frowned.</p>
<p>Karenin was always so logical and somewhat puzzled by his wife’s behavior. He tried to pull her back inside, but she refused.</p>
<p>“At least, build a snowman with me.” She struggled.</p>
<p>Karenin felt awkward, as if he was forcing a child to leave her beloved toy. Feeling yes on him, he glanced around quickly, and saw Sasha and the other servants in a circle. After seeing him looking at them, they all looked away quickly. The people headed by Sasha looked at his wife with the eyes of “poor mistress”, and looked at him from time to time, and he turned into “really cruel master”.</p>
<p>Karenin’s move was so fast that the servants didn’t have time to look back, but in the end, they all watched with relish, especially Sasha. She said in a spoiled tone: “Oh, sir, don’t be so stuffy, I will make a pot of hot ginger tea for you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my God.” Before Karenin reacted, his wife took the lead.</p>
<p>Anna saw Sasha and them, and her face turned red as she realized they had been watching their exchange. Then she stood up straight and said dryly to Karenin, “Let’s go inside Alexei.”</p>
<p>But to her surprise, Karenin said abruptly, “We can make a snowman if you want.”</p>
<p>Sasha lit the candles on the ground so that more light could shine on them. Therefore, Anna wasn’t sure whether Karenin was saying that in a good way or not.</p>
<p>“Come on, Anna.” Karenin said that he crouched down, began to make snow dumplings, and finally rolled it up.</p>
<p>He made a snowman’s body and made a snowman’s head next to it, piling the snowman’s head on his body. Anna churned out some stones, even a carrot.</p>
<p>“A snowman without a carrot nose is not like a snowman.” Anna shivered with cold, but she still smiled happily.</p>
<p>Karenin looked at the snowman carefully. It was really ordinary, and he didn’t feel much fun until now. He still didn’t quite understand why his wife liked this cold game. However, looking at her frozen red cheeks and happy smile, Karenin felt that maybe the snowman itself is not interesting, but there will always be something interesting about his wife.</p>
<p>After completing the snowman, they returned to the hall and started drinking the ginger tea Sasha had made. Anna poured a cup for Karenin and half a cup for herself. Then they drank wine, and some people sang. When Karenin looked for the source, he was surprised to see it was Kabidonnech, the concierge.</p>
<p>The house was full of excitement. He drank wine and looked at his wife’s flowery smile, when no one was looking. When he put down his glass, he saw his wife looking at him with a sparkling eye. Karenin stretched out his hand slowly under the table, holding the soft little hand belonging to his wife, then saw his wife’s shy smile again.</p>
<p>“This is my Christmas present for you, Alexei.” His wife said this with a sly smile.</p>
<p>Karenin felt that her body was suffocating and slightly drunk, so that even her wife’s face seemed to have bright stars shining.</p>
<p>He nodded slightly and said, “I like this gift.”</p>
<p>“You are drunk, Alexei.” His wife’s sweet voice rang in his ear.</p>
<p>“I’m not drunk.” Karenin said calmly.</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn’t drunk. The world had just disappeared, except for the appearance of his wife. It’s a beautiful Christmas Eve, he thought, and put this memory into his heart, saving it deep within.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next day, Karenin found another gift belonging to him under the Christmas tree, a hand-woven scarf in navy blue with his initials at the end, woven with silver-gray silk thread. There were also a pair of knee pads to protect his knees from the cold. He smiled as he realized that Anna had taken his talk about his health to heart.</p>
<p>The snowman in the yard was discovered during the day. It was blocking the door, but no one could bear to move it away. After all, their own master had discovered this unseemly thing early in the morning, but hadn’t said anything, just acquiesced to its existence.</p>
<p>Today was Christmas, and everyone needed a rest.</p>
<p>Today was Christmas, and it was the explanation of all the unreasonable actions of their master, including wearing a scarf at home. As for all the troubles caused by this scarf, would be faced tomorrow.</p>
