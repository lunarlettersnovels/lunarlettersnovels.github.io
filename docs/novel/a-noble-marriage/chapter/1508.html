            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 44 – Innocent as a Baby (1)<br>
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“I…” she paused. At first, there was a hazy light in her gray eyes but then it turned into clear bright irises; like the undulating sea water, rippling with the host’s mood.</p>
<p>“I voluntarily give up all the right to appeal.”</p>
<p>The corners of her mouth rose in a smile, showing off her deep dimples. Their hands found each other, as she lowered her head and leaned against Karenin’s arm.</p>
<p>“I know this is not very reserved, but you have to allow me to do it because I can’t help myself Alexei, you said something very sweet.” She emphasized the word ‘sweet’ by gently laying a small hand on Karenin’s chest. She blushed but didn’t take it away.</p>
<p>“Actually, I think it is good, Anna.” Karenin whispered and laid a kiss on her soft hair.</p>
<p>They both felt peaceful. In fact, Karenin thought that although their marriage was so different than other’s and completely unpredictable, it was indeed satisfactory.</p>
<p>When they got home, they enjoyed dinner, but Anna didn’t say much. She just looked up at her husband from time to time.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Karenin asked, taken aback by Anna’s unusual quietness.</p>
<p>“You seem to shine now, Alexei. I can’t help but look at you.” She sighed again. “I’m really worried that you will be stolen from me, just like the gold coin of a dragon.”</p>
<p>Although Karenin had heard this kind of strange praise and possessiveness from his little wife before, he still couldn’t get used to it completely. So, he calmly pointed out the inappropriateness with a straight face, only for his wife to giggle at him.</p>
<p>“Forgive me, but there are still many strange metaphors in my mind.” Anna finished eating mushrooms, then raised her eyes to look at Karenin again, as if he was a better dish.</p>
<p>Karenin chose to ignore her eyes this time. He must eat his dinner instead of letting his mood wander enough to a state of losing control.</p>
<p>The next day, Anna decided to do something to thank Karenin. He had helped her sort out this messy social system, so of course she had to do something in return.</p>
<p>“Maybe I could make soufflé for him.” Anna said to herself, for although she couldn’t say she was good at cooking, but she was good at making dessert.</p>
<p>Her former agent had controlled her diet strictly, but people were so strange sometimes; they are restricted in one place, and they can’t help but make up for it in other ways. Women and desserts always seemed to be inseparable.</p>
<p>Anna borrowed the kitchen from Sasha, the cook, who she found was very kind. She lent the kitchen that was completely in order to her mistress. But she also prepared the kitchen for a disaster. She teamed up with the doorman, Kabidonnech, and prepared several buckets of water.</p>
<p>All of this happened without Anna’s knowledge. There were two possible reasons. Firstly, all servants in Karenin’s household were capable of carrying out their activities without disturbing others and in complete silence. Secondly, Anna was too immersed in making soufflé for Karenin and was singularly focused.</p>
<p>The round eggs and tasty oranges had soon turned into a batter. The process of waiting usually made people anxious, but after seeing the delicious product, Anna felt extremely satisfied. She couldn’t wait to share it with someone, so she called Sasha in.</p>
<p>“It smells so good in here. May I ask what you’re doing, madam?” Sasha was surprised to find that the kitchen was still clean and seemed to be brewing something delicious.</p>
<p>“I made soufflé.” Anna bounced on her toes as she told her.</p>
<p>Sasha glanced at the things on the stove and sighed again.</p>
<p>“Accompany me to a cup of tea, Sasha.” Anna smiled at her.</p>
<p>“That wouldn’t be very proper, madam.” Sasha hesitated, but Anna pulled her hand.</p>
<p>“Please don’t refuse, I’ll feel sorry for myself if I have to drink afternoon tea alone.”</p>
<p>Sasha laughed. “If you say so madam, then I don’t think I should refuse the invitation.”</p>
<p>The kitchen was connected to a backyard. There was a small garden; although it didn’t have any flowers planted there, the grass and bushes were well maintained. Sunlight poured throughout the backyard to every corner. Painted white log table and several lounge chairs were placed there. Sasha took out a small pink plaid tablecloth like a magic trick and laid it flat on it.</p>
<p>Anna asked Annushka to bring the table mat she had made in advance with lace. They chose a rose-colored bone China tea set, and the milk was packed in a transparent glass pot. The soufflé had orange and butter aroma, which was sweet, greasy and fresh.</p>
<p>“Look how well this is done!” Sasha praised, her pudgy fingers touched Anna’s printed coasters, and then looked at the delicious soufflé.</p>
