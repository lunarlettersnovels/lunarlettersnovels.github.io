            <p><strong>Chapter 71 – Man in Tailored Suit (1)</strong></p>
<p>She dressed herself quickly, then took a croissant and left. What she didn’t know was that Karenin also got up after she left. He stood in the balcony window, looking at her back through the glass window, dressed as a teenager, running with long legs like an antelope in a posture that a lady would never be found in.</p>
<p>After being unable to see her anymore, Karenin withdrew his gaze. He rang the bell, and when Kearney came in, he informed him that he would be home later tonight.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Kearney had always been loyal and organized, never questioning the owner’s decision, only behaving well. Karenin had always been assured of his old butler.</p>
<p>Anna ran a little, panting to catch her breath. Mr. Goldman’s tailor shop was not very far away from where they lived, but he didn’t often go out on weekdays. Even if he did, she was a noble lady who took her carriage everywhere and there was no way to keep up with her physical strength. Fortunately, she arrived earlier than the time given by him.</p>
<p>The tailor shop wasn’t even open yet. Anna caught her breath as she walked a few steps and found a fairly clean place to sit. She took out the croissant from her pocket and slowly gnawed at it. She was parched and just wanted to have water or milk.</p>
<p>As she was thinking, a glass of water appeared in front of her. Anna looked up in surprise, it was the tall Mr. Prokhov, with a somewhat silly smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Want?”</p>
<p>Anna took the water, thanked him, and gulped it down. Her dry throat became comfortable at once.</p>
<p>“Mr. Prokhov, why are you here so early?” Anna asked.</p>
<p>She knew that the tailor shop did not open at this time. Therefore, as a man in the shop, the gentleman in front of her shouldn’t have started so early.</p>
<p>“Just couldn’t hold back curiosity.” Mr. Prokhov said, his round brown eyes looked sincere and kind. “I don’t think you should waste time here. Really, Mr. Goldman won’t accept apprentices.”</p>
<p>Anna patted off the crumbs from her body, then stood up, and she wiped her mouth on purpose to make herself look like a boy.</p>
<p>“I won’t accept that answer. I need to try.”</p>
<p>“How long are you going to try?” Mr. Prokhov asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Three months, at least.” Anna thought for a while and shrugged.</p>
<p>“If he asks you to arrive at this time every day, will you still try for three months?”</p>
<p>Anna shrugged her shoulders again.</p>
<p>“I think you are more stupid than I am.” Mr. Prokhov said.</p>
<p>The tall man stretched out his big hand and placed it on Anna’s thin shoulders, expressing encouragement, “Although this is really stupid, if you want to do it, do it. It’s better to be stupid than to live in regret.”</p>
<p>Anna didn’t know how to respond, so she could only thank him dryly.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Prokhov looked at her again, then waved and left. Anna looked at his retreating back. He was as strong as a bear she thought to herself. Maybe this Mr. Prokhov was also a person with a story. She was still waiting in front of the shop. After another hour, when the sky was lit with sunshine, a tall and slender man walked over to the shop slowly.</p>
<p>Anna waited for the other party to approach for a while, then greeted, “Good morning, Mr. Goldman.”</p>
<p>Mr. Goldman looked at Anna for a while. There was no surprise and no understanding on his face. He was indifferent; as if he didn’t care whether she was there or not. He opened the door of the shop. Neither did he greet Anna, nor did he send her away. So, Anna thought about it for a second before she followed him inside.</p>
<p>“Is it still carrying the boxes for me today?” Anna asked deliberately and carefully, while also observing the other person, because Karenin said that the gentleman might have recognized her.</p>
<p>But what was puzzling was that Mr. Goldman did not act as if he really recognized her. At the moment, when Mr. Goldman finally looked at her, his green eyes were clearly saying: ‘Is there a problem with your brain?’</p>
<p>Anna resisted the mean look and got to work. After a long time, she got a second task, picking out the rag heads according to their colors and patterns, and placing them in different categories. When Anna was instructed to enter the warehouse, the warehouse that had not been cleaned for a long time, she inhaled a long breath of dust and stale air. She sneezed loudly and then really started to do it.</p>
<p>When Prokhov came to work, he knew what the stubborn young man was doing, he couldn’t help but intercede.</p>
<p>“Are you really not considering accepting him?”</p>
<p>“Just mind your own business.” Mr. Goldman gave him a stern look.</p>
<p>Prokhov sighed and murmured, “He is so pitiable, I can’t do anything right when I see him!”</p>
<p>“Then close your eyes,” Mr. Goldman smiled playfully, “Or it would also be good to be blind, lest you always look down on him.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t joke like that.”</p>
<p>“I wish I was joking, but sometimes thinking about what purpose you have to endure me, I really want to put this into action. After all, between us, you are the thief who wanted to steal treasure from the dragon.” Mr. Goldman said coolly.</p>
<p>These words seemed to hit Prokhov’s heart’s weakness all at once, and he said in a whisper, “You are so mean.” The big man lowered his eyes, a little frustrated. “I didn’t want to steal; at most I just hope you let me stay here.”</p>
<p>“I told you to leave, you don’t listen.” Mr. Goldman said flatly, “Don’t expect to know the impossible. In this era, it’s ridiculous to talk about freedom of rights and ideals, and whatnot.”</p>
<p>“It’s not ridiculous.” Mr. Prokhov retorted weakly, before waiting for Mr. Goldman to express any maliciousness.</p>
