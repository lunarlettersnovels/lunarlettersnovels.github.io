            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 26 – Karenin’s Admirer (1)</strong></p>
<p>At first, Anna was a little nervous when she heard Karenin say this, but soon after, her anxiety subsided.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Karenin looked at his wife questioningly.</p>
<p>She stretched out her hand and wrapped her fingers around the other person’s arm, and then whispered softly, “She likes you.”</p>
<p>“Mrs de Malere.” Anna saw Karenin casted her a surprised look, but he was quick to mask his surprise and soon had sported a neutral expression.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about it, Anna.” Was his rather calm response.</p>
<p>“That’s wrong, Alexei. If a wife doesn’t mind at all that a woman likes her husband, I think it must be because she doesn’t care about him at all.” Anna answered pointedly. She knew deep in her heart that she was partially wrong—it is in the wife’s confidence to her husband’s fidelity that leaves no room for worry in the marriage.</p>
<p>However, she found it pressing how Mrs Malere was hounding her husband in a manner not so discreet.</p>
<p>“Madame Malere is elegant, beautiful and very clever. She has traits that every man would fancy. She is really an ideal woman.” Anna stated this fact, looking at Karenina, wanting him to reply.</p>
<p>“This is a fact, but it has nothing to do with me. There are all kinds of people in this world, and there are even a lot of people who are more perfect than you and me, but that doesn’t matter, we don’t need to change anything, we don’t always love “perfect people” or at least “perfect” by society’s standards.”</p>
<p>Karenin was not perturbed. Although he hadn’t known about Mrs Malere’s admiration for him before, he knew now, he didn’t evade the topic nor revel in it. Her admiration had nothing to do with him. The only thing that matters was the persons he had, the only ones that he should cherish.</p>
<p>“I admire how you are honest with me.” Anna smiled, her fingers squeezed his. This intimate action made Karenin’s muscles tighten for a moment, and then relaxed again. He took deep breaths as his little wife leaned against his shoulder.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s appropriate to do this outside,” Karenin told her as he glanced at the people around them.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Anna sat herself down then on a nearby stool and her mood visibly sombered.</p>
<p>After a while, Karenin’s calm spoke to her in a gentle tone, “But I think holding hands is allowed.” Then, a white and delicate hand moved to clasped his fingers and gently rubbed his big hand. Karenina caught her playful touches and wrapped her hand with his own.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At night, Anna was the first to fall asleep, her pillows were not very soft, but they were very warm. On the other hand, her husband slept late into the night. But before that, they had quite a banter.</p>
<p>“The happiness of two people, Anna, we haven’t discussed this matter yet.” Karenin was sitting on the chair in front of the desk and was reading a book. When she came out of the bathroom, he raised the issue again.</p>
<p>Anna laughed at him in reply. She almost danced her way towards him. She then leaned over slightly, and whispered to his ears, “I like to see you jealous.”</p>
<p><em>Jealous.</em> Anna knew how Karenin was bothered by the words she said at the ball, “Defending the happiness of two people” while her gaze was on Mr de Malere. It was obvious that Karenina got the wrong idea.</p>
<p>As he was finding the words to tell her, Karenin was a bit distracted. His wife exuded the scent of Saponaria, having just recently washed. Her hair was dangling closely against his exposed skin, and her scent filled his nostrils. Karenin willed his mind to focus on the problem. “This is not jealousy.” He cleared his throat. “Husband and wife should be honest with each other.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Anna stood up straight and said while combing her hair, “You can’t ask me to be honest with you in everything, Alexei. Don’t you know? A woman without a secret is unattractive.”</p>
<p>“You are very attractive,” Karenin objected.</p>
<p>Immediately, the movement of Anna’s hand stopped. She replied dryly, “At that time, I was referring to Mr de Malere. Although he is not as smart you, he is a good person. Too good to be neglected by his wife.” <em>‘Who is seeking your attention,’</em>Anna added in her head.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about him, Anna.” Karenin said. “If you want a serious argument, Mr. de Malere can achieve today’s achievements, half of which is based on the reputation built up by his ancestors, and the other half is based on his wife.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but obviously, his wife doesn’t like him, she likes you better.” When she uttered such words, Karenin felt a little uncomfortable, as if it was his fault. “I don’t quite understand what you are trying to say.” He replied, as he recalled once again whether there was anything inappropriate with his conversation with Mrs de Malere earlier.</p>
<p>Karenin regarded marriage very sacred and solemnly. Although he lived in this circle, he has always kept himself clean. In his opinion, marriage is a lifetime matter, only God and death can separate husband and wife.</p>
<p>“In short, Anna, what I am saying is, your happiness has nothing to do with the happiness of Mr. de Malere. If you insist, as a wife, your happiness should be related to me alone.”</p>
<p>Anna looked down at her husband. She then glanced at of his lips that would frown when making a serious statement. Little did she know, Karenin already came to a conclusion in his heart that perhaps, he was really jealous. Anna did not reply to her husband immediately, but instead, kissed him on the forehead.</p>
<p>“You are right, Alexei.” Anna affirmed and praised. She gave him a heartfelt smile then.</p>
<p>Karenin felt a little strange, his words were affirmed by his wife, but he rather was wary of her. He docked and tried to cover his forehead with his hands. <em>‘It shall not happen again!’</em></p>
<p>For him, forehead shouldn’t be the place where the wife kisses as he is an adult. A boy can get this kind of kiss, which means comfort, love, and joy, but if he still tolerates such affection after having grown up, he is akin to a grown man acting like a baby to his mother. It’s shameful.</p>
<p>Karenin stood up and said in a low voice, “I’m going to wash.”</p>
<p>Left hanging, Anna could only look at her husband’s retreating back. She did a short dance upon realization.</p>
