            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 50 – The Best Thing That Happened (1)</strong></p>
<p>Anna and Karenin walked to their bedroom. Karenin shut the door behind him and was wrapped in his wife’s arms. “I went to the Maillard’s residence and had tea with Mrs. Maillard,” Anna said. She wanted to stay like this forever. No secrets, no walls, just warmth and love.</p>
<p>Karenin put his hands on his wife’s waist, pulling her closer. He had never done something like this before. It felt intimate, and it made him feel stupid, in the best way possible. “Hmm. And?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I heard a lot about your past,” she responded, “Some things I heard were very funny, but some were horrible.”</p>
<p>“Hm. For example?” he asked.</p>
<p>Karenin cared little about other people’s opinions about him. He had lived his life thinking it was useless attempting to get to know people, unless it was for his job, or political purposes, to get things done.</p>
<p>“…about your brother,” said Anna carefully.</p>
<p>Karenin let go of her. Anna saw that his expression had changed. “That is in the past, Anna,” he said.</p>
<p>“I know you have always handled your situations well,” she began, “But I still feel for you. I… if I had known you earlier. Maybe even grew up together. Then I could have been there for you. So that you weren’t as lonely….” She trailed off.</p>
<p>Karenin was silent. Anna knew that she was much more emotional than others. She did not know if feeling more emotion was good or bad. But she wanted to know so much about him, and the more she knew about his sad life, the more she wanted to give all her love to him. However, she did not want to push him.</p>
<p>“Alexei, am I bothering you?” asked Anna.</p>
<p>Karenin looked at her. Even though he did not fully understand her emotional struggles, he tried his hardest to reach a balance in his relationship. “I don’t know what made you think that,” he said, “Let me be honest with you. Perhaps it will make you feel better. Sometimes the way you do things out of the blue, it is peculiar. But I don’t think it’s wrong. I have my own rhythm of doing things. I had thought of getting married at twenty-five, but that didn’t go as planned. And now I am married to you at almost thirty-five. You were a surprise to me, more like a shock. But the good kind. I don’t want you to change.” He hugged her tight and placed a kiss on her forehead. “I love you the way you are.”</p>
<p>Anna smiled in the embrace. She snuggled close to him and held him tight. “You are the best thing that has ever happened in my life,” she said, burying her face in his chest.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Karenin’s job mainly involved diplomatic affairs. He worked as a government official now. Military officials had a habit of looking down on government officials. When Karenin joined this division, he could see the uselessness and inefficiency of the people in the office. But he got along very well with them.</p>
<p>The people took Karenin’s friendliness for granted. But Karenin knew the importance of working well with his colleagues. They did not, usually, get much attention, but they were the ones who held the system aloft. Therefore, he could see the importance in maintaining a good relationship with them.</p>
<p>In mid-January, Karenin had an appointment to meet a diplomat from Germany. Mr. Masacci was a portly gentleman with thick eyebrows. He was very jovial and friendly. While Mrs. Masacci, a tall, dark-blonde woman, was elegant and beautiful. Karenin had done his own research before meeting the couple. He knew that they had been married for three years. Mr. Masacci was younger than him, just twenty-seven in age. He had been involved in some sensitive matters as well.</p>
<p>People usually tried to get on their good sides. Especially Mr. Masacci was so open and friendly when he had had a few rounds of drinks. But when asked about certain topics, they both would be unyielding. Since, it was almost afternoon, Karenin invited them out for lunch. They both obliged.</p>
