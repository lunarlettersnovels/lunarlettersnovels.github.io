            <p><strong>Chapter 8 – As If by Fate</strong></p>
<p>She was about to blurt out that it was the love that bubbled within her, the first time she saw him. But she held her tongue. She didn’t want to seem too daring, especially during a delicate time like this. The lifestyle of the upper class, the aristocracy, was strange. It seemed they didn’t mix love and marriage. Those that they loved, they didn’t marry, or most time weren’t allowed to. They had lovers, and they had spouses like two dimensions in the same world which didn’t blend.</p>
<p>Marriage was always a steppingstone, a union sought for benefit. While affection was hushed, never brought into conversation. <em>Sigh</em>. If Anna told him that she wanted to marry him because she loved him, would he turn her away?</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Mr. Karenin nodded approval, pondering how his heart leap when sees her and how ridiculously fast did the woman caught it.</p>
<p>It was as if by fate, he met her.</p>
<p>For Mr. Karenin, this wasn’t just a union for benefit. He was smitten with her and would do anything to make her happy. This wasn’t lost on Anna and she blushed, in spite of herself.</p>
<p>Even though both of them had different thoughts, it didn’t stop either of them feeling what they felt for the other. The more time they spent, the fonder they got for each other. Maybe sometimes, two contrast things come together by a stroke of coincidence and perhaps that’s all it takes to be happy and have the conviction to spend the rest of their lives together.</p>
<p>It seemed time did fly when they were together, forgotten to the world. Mr. Karenin enjoyed being with Anna, but it was already time to leave. He, reluctantly, indicated to her that it was time to say goodbye, at least, for today.</p>
<p>“So fast!” said Anna with a long face. Mr. Karenin allowed himself to kiss her hand in farewell.</p>
<p>Before he left, he produced a letter from inside of his coat and offered it to Anna. “I believe you should have it,” said Mr. Karenin. Anna looked at the letter that she had written to him with a proposal for him two days ago and accepted it. She looked up at him, into his blue eyes. Mr. Karenin wanted to shower her with kisses, but propriety deemed it ill-fitting before their marriage. So, he wished her farewell and left.</p>
<p>Anna returned to her bedroom and put away the letter. She knew aunt Tellier was waiting with the others.</p>
<p>When she went back to the living room, Stiva jumped right to the questions. “So, do you really agree with this marriage?” he asked. Aunt Tellier directed a disapproving look towards her nephew. Stiva didn’t much care about approval from her, anyway. His concern was reserved for his little sister.</p>
<p>Anna considered how to answer his questions. After a moment, she carefully said, “I think it is a rather excellent match. Mr. Karenin seems to be truly a gentleman.” Anna hoped that this answer would put Stiva’s mind at ease.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” he nodded, “That does seem to be true. I have done my own inquiry, through my colleagues, about him. He is the youngest officer in Petersburg. That alone would have taken, at the least, five years to earn such a status.” Stiva hadn’t found anything in Mr. Karenin which was remotely problematic. In fact, he admired him for his hard work and tenacity.</p>
<p>Madame Tellier, though, was always caught up in the games of names and prestige. Anna wasn’t surprised when her aunt said,” Mr. Karenin, indeed, seems to be an excellent gentleman. This union would be hugely beneficial to the Oblonsky family. You must agree to take his surname and the title of Mrs. Karenin, no matter what.” Anna was exhausted with this concern for superficial dignity- of name, class, prestige, pedigree. She found it of no importance, but she wasn’t going to argue with her aunt about this. It would get her nowhere.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course, auntie,” promised Anna with a tired sigh.</p>
<p>Madame Tellier, mistaking her sigh for fatigue due to the day’s events, kindly let Anna return to her room and rest. The following days would prove to be very busy in preparing for the upcoming wedding.</p>
<p>Anna didn’t really care for pompous and extravagant wedding ceremonies. She thought that if two people loved each other, trust each other, then a legally binding paper was enough to declare them husband and wife without having to boast about it to the world.</p>
<p>She returned to her room and opened the letter. She passes over the words she had written to Mr. Karenin. But below her own words, there were a few lines which weren’t hers, written in steady confident strokes.</p>
<p>She read the lines again and again, she would read them forever if she could! Smiling to herself, Anna twirled around the room, her skirts spread around her like a flower in bloom. Her heart filled with so much joy. She thanked god for bringing them together, once again, in this life. She couldn’t wait for them to be married soon.</p>
