            <p><strong>Chapter 63 – The New Doorman (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Maillard,” said Anna gratefully, “I am grateful you trust me so much, and my husband. Your faith makes me believe in good things, too.” It made her happy that this old couple always saw the good in Karenin.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Anna rechecked and revised her sketch. She, then, dressed herself in men’s clothes that Annushka had bought. These included a dark brown coat, some loose trousers that looked a bit dull. There was also a hat to hide her long hair. She looked like a poor young man urgently in need of a job. Annushka helped to paint her eyebrows, so they appeared thicker. She also attached a light, fake beard to her chin, so it gave her an unkempt and untrimmed look. Curiously, she felt comfortable in these clothes than the dresses and corsets she usually wore. These were loose fitting and so comfy. Anna left through the back door and met Annuskha at the front, who then led her to the stables. Peter was tending to the horses.</p>
<p>“Peter,” called Annushka, “This is Pavel, my cousin. He is here in search of a job. He wanted to work as a doorman, but the position is occupied. Madam gave permission for him to stay here and learn from you.”</p>
<p>Peter glanced at the young boy. “Don’t be any trouble, lad,” he said.</p>
<p>“I won’t, sir,” said Anna, trying to sound deep and low.</p>
<p>“Come on then, kid,” said Peter, “I am going to go pick Mr. Karenin from his office. You follow me.”</p>
<p>Annushka opened her mouth to say something, but Anna gestured for her not to. Annushka looked at her worriedly; she felt sorry for Anna. She wondered if she could manage to hold her composure. To her surprise, Anna seemed at ease and had already jumped next to the driver’s seat. Anna wasn’t really the fragile, delicate lady that she thought she was.</p>
<p>“Good, kid,” said Peter, “Now listen carefully. You don’t need to be too nervous about seeing our master, but best not to be distracted, alright? When we meet the officials, they will be dressed in gold. Don’t stare at them.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” said Anna, “Thank you for letting me accompany, sir. I will relay to madam of your kindness towards me.”</p>
<p>Peter chuckled. “The lad’s pretty okay,” said Peter to Annushka, waving goodbye to her.</p>
<p>When they drove inside the gate, Peter parked the carriage in a quiet place and waited, unlike other carriages which were just by the door. Shortly, a person walked out of the gate, draped in a black woollen coat—Karenin. He was very tall. He seemed to be talking to the portly man beside him. They shook hands and bid each other goodbye. The man was accompanied by his secretary to the carriage. The secretary was Mr. Vorobev. Anna snorted inwardly in derision after seeing him.</p>
<p>“Sir,” said Anna and bowed. She opened the carriage door for Karenin to climb in. Karenin paused and looked at the new doorman.</p>
<p>“It’s Annushka’s cousin, sir,” said Peter hurriedly, “He wants to learn to work. Madam has assigned me to teach him the ways.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Mr. Karenin,” said Anna, in her low voice.</p>
<p>Karenin nodded. He frowned and then climbed into the carriage. Vorobev glanced at Anna and remained staring for a while. He then climbed inside the carriage. He was very focused on discussing something important with Mr. Karenin. Anna closed the carriage door and climbed up, taking her seat next to the driver.</p>
<p>“Good job, kid,” praised Peter, “I will make a perfect doorman out of you yet.”</p>
<p>Anna smiled and thanked him. She leaned against the carriage as much as she could without seeming suspicious and tried to listen to their words. Unfortunately, she couldn’t hear anything. When they arrived at the house, Anna climbed down from the driver’s seat and opened the carriage door for the two men.</p>
<p>“Where is Anna?” asked Karenin, when Annushka opened the main door.</p>
<p>“Madam went to Mr. Maillard’s residence,” she said, “She informed she would have her dinner there and arrive only later.”</p>
<p>Karenin nodded. He ushered Vorobev to his study. They didn’t come out until dinner. Karenin looked at his pocket watch and frowned. He and Vorobev had dinner fast before returning to the study for their important discussion. Karenin, before he met Anna, would spend no more than fifteen minutes for dinner. He used to be immersed in work, day and night without a minute’s rest.</p>
<p>At half-past eight, Karenin saw Vorobev to the door. He looked at his pocket watch again. Karenin called for Peter and instructed him to drop Vorobev to his residence. Anna had to open the carriage door for Vorobev, which she detested doing.</p>
<p>The night was dark, and the street was lit by the stars. Vorobev let out a sigh of relief. Talking to Mr. Karenin was always so taxing. He was too rigid and focused. It wasn’t easy to deceive him. Vorobev was thinking of going to the tavern and having a few drinks when he saw the young doorman again holding the door of the carriage for him.</p>
<p>He looked at the doorman, who had his head bowed respectfully. Sometimes, these young doormen didn’t work only for money. He still remembered the scandal associated with Countess Lydia and her nineteen-year-old doorman last year.</p>
<p>“Can you raise your head a little so I can see you?” asked Vorobev.</p>
<p>Anna was nervous and annoyed. She was worried whether he would recognize her and irritated because she had to do as he instructed. She swallowed her annoyance and raised her head a little, making herself look confused. “Is there anything I can do for you, sir?” she asked.</p>
<p>Vorobev looked at the young doorman carefully. He had thought he had seen the boy somewhere before, but now he could see he was mistaken. The young doorman was just a poor boy with a pretty face, his eyes full of ignorance.</p>
<p>Vorobev was reminded of his own self. A poor, hopeful boy who had come all the way from countryside with big dreams. In the end, the city hadn’t given him anything remarkable at all. He looked at the young boy and said in a low, kindly voice, “Remember to trim your beard next time when you go hunting for a decent job in Petersburg.”</p>
<p>He got into the carriage. And Anna closed the door behind him. She was surprised at his kind advice. She had had Annushka attach a light, fake beard because it had seemed a good idea at that time. She had thought the beard would make her disguise more convincing, and it had worked! But it also made her think about her impression of the secretary. Perhaps she was wrong about him, maybe he wasn’t as bad.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Karenin was getting restless in his study. Anna still hadn’t returned. He paced the study for a while. When he couldn’t wait any longer, he draped his coat and called Kearney to prepare for him a carriage to Mr. Maillard’s.</p>
<p>As he walked into the hall, he saw a young man entering while putting his hat on. Karenin stopped in his tracks.</p>
