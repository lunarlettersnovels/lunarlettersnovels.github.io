            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 43 – Amendments and Appeals (2)</strong></p>
<p>Karenin felt his wife beside him and, out of politeness, shifted a bit, giving her room. But before long, his wife came closer to him.</p>
<p>That made Karenin stop talking for a moment, to look at his wife and ask if she needed anything. The latter shook her head, her eyes twinkling and smiled contentedly at him.</p>
<p>Karenin turned his attention back to the conversation, and this time no longer naively thinking his wife felt crowded, shifted towards her.</p>
<p>Although, for the life of him, he couldn’t fathom how it was meaningful at all, but yet, his wife clearly loved their proximity, even in this crowded room.</p>
<p>If they were not amidst so many people, Anna felt certain that she could never have stopped herself from kissing Karenin.</p>
<p>Of course, if your husband changed his more than a decade old, set-in-stone schedule for you, wouldn’t you want to do the same?</p>
<p>If she put her hand on Karenin’s arm at this time, it would be perceived as being too clingy. All Anna could do was restrain that impulse and express her joy by keeping as close to him as was acceptable by society.</p>
<p>“I went to the dressing room, and we were joined by a new partner, weren’t we?”</p>
<p>Vronsky’s sister came back, her hair and skirt immaculately in place, but with her face flushed and her eyes sparkling, she looked like a flower, with a uniquely bright color.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Patsy echoed sweetly, and she introduced Karenin to Vronsky’s sister.</p>
<p>Karenin gracefully engaged her in a conversation, and the Duchess of Miyahki usurped his attention when she mentioned a bill, currently being passed by Karenin.</p>
<p>Duchess Miyahki didn’t mean to talk about such serious things. In fact, she didn’t care at all about laws and bills, but she liked Anna and was willing to talk with her husband about something he was interested in and thus, they exchanged some views.</p>
<p>Karenin, however, knew what they wanted to hear about. He liked politics and bills and discussions about them, but he was also aware that he was in the company of ladies. If he let his own passionate nature overtake him, the conversation would either end badly or be embarrassing because it was boring.</p>
<p>So he cleverly manoeuvred himself out of the situation.</p>
<p>They sat for another half hour, until it wasn’t impolite to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Karenin asked Anna privately if she wanted to go back together. Anna, of course, replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Karenin then bid goodbye to the hostess.</p>
<p>“Won’t you stay for dinner?” Patsyasked, longing to keep them longer.</p>
<p>Karenin was just about to offer his already-fabricated excuse and politely refuse it, but Vronsky’s sister answered on their behalf.</p>
<p>“Oh, Patsy, don’t forget that they are newlyweds, not like us.” Vronsky’s sister answered laughing, in high spirits herself.</p>
<p>Patsy also laughed in agreement. She exchanged a look with Vronsky’s sister that only they understood, before turning to Anna and Karenin.</p>
<p>“I look forward to having dinner with you next time.”</p>
<p>Karenin kissed Patsy’s hand again, which made Anna take his arm quickly and leave together.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The coachman of Karenin’s family was already waiting at the door, and the grey horse swung its tail in welcome, and the Tatars opened the carriage door for them.</p>
<p>When the carriage started to drive home, Anna gazed at Karenin for a while, unnerving him until he turned his head and asked her about it.</p>
<p>“I have an unusual idea to share with you.” She said.</p>
<p><em>Men pose and look carefully.</em></p>
<p>Anna first smoothened the wrinkles on her skirt with her hands, and then after careful consideration, said, “I didn’t realize this would be a problem, but I found out today that maybe I should make my own point of view clear first. Even if most people think it is absurd and inappropriate, I want to tell you. “</p>
<p>Alexei, I don’t want a third person in our marriage.”</p>
<p>Anna saw Karenin blink his eyes slowly, obviously stunned and she sighed softly.</p>
<p>“I know that for most people, this is not to be blamed, but …”</p>
<p>Anna didn’t finish; her words were gently interrupted by Karenin.</p>
<p>“If you mean what you saw today in the Duchess of Perth, Anna, I have to express my opinion again. Even if this society is so, some ethos will not be publicly criticized, and even some people secretly commend it. I have no intention of criticizing them. All I can do is to abide by my own principles and beliefs. Just as I have always believed in the sanctity of marriage, once combined, there should be no power to separate a couple except death.”</p>
<p>Karenin paused, his blue eyes were so intense and focused that they seemed to glow in the darkness. His words were calm and organized, and his eyes were authoritative.</p>
<p>“Maybe you have misunderstood before, and I think that since you are concerned about this problem, I’d better make it clear to you completely. What I mean by death and separation at the moment is not only the death of the body, but also the highest will of people.”</p>
<p>“If you have any questions about our relationship and feelings at the moment, or if you disapprove of it, you can tell me now. If this moment passes, Anna, I will no longer accept any amendments and appeals.”</p>
