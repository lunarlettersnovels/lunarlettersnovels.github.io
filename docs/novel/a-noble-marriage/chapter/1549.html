            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 2 – A Little Indifferent but Sensual (1)</strong></p>
<p>Anna was a little disappointed. At first, she thought that she was unlucky to suddenly cross to this world. She could never forget it—her transmigration which happened after one of her runway shows.</p>
<p>Her previous world was very much different from this place she now wakes up in every day—it was a world of skyscrapers. A life of convenience, an absolute effect of a soaring technology, which carried a double-edged sword to the lives of the people.</p>
<p>However, it seemed as though the electricity here was noneexistent. That also included both the internet and vehicles alike. Most of all, she hated direly how little freedom women have. No woman could go outside so easily and without any escort to accompany her. This also meant that there was no way she could work for herself. People of the “weaker sex”, as they say, were scorned if they so much assume a role that was primarily meant for men.</p>
<p>It can be presumed that she was, without a doubt, hurled into a classic novel.</p>
<p>However, she had long learned to cease her complaining. There is a certain kind of charm in starting life anew—leaving behind a rapid and tumultuous life of which the growing center of her previous life. She felt a certain thrill that could only be likened to that of a mystical dream that had come true. Anna herself couldn’t deny this.</p>
<p>In fact, among all the depravity, she had bumped into him again. What a funny coincidence—one that she was willing to be a part of.</p>
<p><em>‘Is it possible that he had followed me here?’ </em>she thought with glee. But the man didn’t seem to know her when their eyes first met here in this time.</p>
<p>Instantly, her world had regained its brightness. She wouldn’t have ever imagined this to happen for she didn’t believe that the same opportunity arose twice, but it had! And she wanted to seize it.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean, Miss Oblonsky.” His low voice said, making Anna look at his pursed lips. “I just don’t understand; why did you suddenly choose me?”</p>
<p>“If we are going to get married, I think we should start by calling each other’s names. Please call me Anna. This is my first request, Alexei.” She said sincerely.</p>
<p>“Miss Oblonsky,” He pressed raising a thick eyebrow, “intimate names are only suitable for intimate relationships that have been blessed by God.”</p>
<p>Anna perused him silently, judging Mr. Karenin.</p>
<p>The gentleman in front of her was slightly unamused because of her seeming lack of manners. After all, she was the one who proposed the marriage. Anna knew that he was also protecting her reputation, and she even understood what it meant. People like him didn’t need marriage to pave more opportunities for their career, nor did she provide an increase of his wealth through the marriage, despite marriage itself always being a matter of interest, even for the emperor.</p>
<p>“God!” She exclaimed in a low voice, unable to control her smile. “Now you can’t stop me.”</p>
<p>“From what?” Karenin frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“From getting us married,” Anna said confidently. “There is no one else I like more now. My family and your identity match perfectly. We make a great—no, we are a match made in heaven. I think you should be able to tolerate me, and I think you are wonderful. I am very happy to marry you. Under such circumstances, why do you refuse this marriage?” she asked persistently…</p>
<p>Alexei was, in all sense, surprised at this woman’s boldness and transparency. She was different from all the women he met.</p>
<p>She inhaled deeply as she waited for him to speak but as soon as he opened his mouth, she backtracked.</p>
<p>“Wait!” she said nervously, preventing Karenin from speaking.</p>
<p>She asked a nearby servant for pens and paper. The servant quickly brought Anna what she wanted.</p>
<p>“Please wait a minute.” She apologized to Karenin and began to write on the expensive parchment.</p>
<p>After a while, she passed the paper over to him. While the man was reading, Anna put her right hand under her chin. Through her long eyelashes, her gray eyes looked at him intently.</p>
<p>She remembered this position. He was always in that pose for ten of her shows, and he gave her the same flowers every time but never talked to her. Anna admitted that this person aroused her interest.</p>
<p>Now, luckily, she had another chance.</p>
<p>She noticed his slender hands, the strong fingers with which he wrote very beautiful cards to her. Although they were concise, they were beautiful and always had a powerful effect on her. Just like him, a little indifferent but sensual.</p>
<p>When he was done reading, he looked up from the parchment with the same indifferent expression on his face. She smiled and raised her eyebrows in question.</p>
<p>“I accept your proposal.”</p>
<p>So, on that memorable day, one meter away from the dance floor among the orchestral music, a marriage of a fourteen-year age difference kicked off.</p>
