            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 17 – Bitter and Sweet (2)</strong></p>
<p>The dining room was located in the middle of the train. The walkways were not wide enough for two people to walk together side by side, so Karenin walked in front of her. Some parents would hold their children’s hands so they wouldn’t run around.</p>
<p>Anna wasn’t a little child anymore, and Karenin naturally wasn’t the type to willfully hold someone’s hand. But when he rose, he did say:</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>That sensation was like honey, Anna thought, following behind him.</p>
<p>Karenin was tall, and his shoulders were very wide, so when he walked before her, Anna couldn’t see everything in front of her.</p>
<p>In her past, some of her experiences would make her anxious when faced with this type of uncertainty. But it was different now. Now she had someone she trusted walking in front of her, guiding her through it. She found that this uncertainty wasn’t that frightening anymore.</p>
<p>They eventually arrived at the center of the train. Anna herself took a moment to take the scenery in. As of the present time, there were not yet a lot of people in the dining area. They must have arrived right before the rush hour.</p>
<p>Anna knew that Karenin was not one to just randomly suggest they come to eat. Perhaps he had grown used to dining at a certain time of the day.</p>
<p>“What do you want to eat?” Karenin asked.</p>
<p>There weren’t a lot of choices in a place like this, but with Karenin’s conduct, one would overlook this point of fact.</p>
<p>Anna ordered something she liked, and carefully checked what Karenin got, making a mental note of it for herself. Just for future reference.</p>
<p>And so, they ordered and waited. The food arrived at an acceptable time, and they got ready to dig in. As soon as Anna took the first bite of her ordered food, she found her smile falling at the taste.</p>
<p>Unappetizing, she thought of it. She looked towards Karenin and saw her thoughts echoed in his expression. His brows were furrowed. Indeed, she wasn’t mistaken then. However, she’d like to think it wasn’t anyone else’s fault though. They couldn’t blame the ingredients, they also couldn’t blame the cooks and chef.</p>
<p>Anna thought that Karenin would directly throw away this unsatisfactory lunch like some other rich people, but he didn’t.</p>
<p>He smoothed his brow, and continued to calmly cut his food, raising his gaze towards Anna, asking: “Does it not fit your appetite?”</p>
<p>Anna was suddenly moved.</p>
<p>This emotion stemmed from Karenin’s humbleness. As his wife, Anna felt a type of pride. There was a saying: “If the person I loved was a criminal, then perhaps I would be unsure of what to do. But if the person I loved was a person of noble character, I would surely be proud of him.”</p>
<p>“No,” Anna said, smiling as she continued to eat her food.</p>
<p>She was lying, of course. This lunch was not palatable for her, but her emotions would make up for everything. And thus there was no more talk of the food, nor its unsatisfactory taste. Only when they returned to the carriage after eating, did Anna finally admitted the truth to him.</p>
<p>“What do you want to eat now?”</p>
<p>Karenin didn’t ask about anything else, focusing on more realistic questions.</p>
<p>“No need, I’m already full now,” Anna said rather joyfully.</p>
<p>Karenin nodded, then said: “You know don’t have to force yourself to finish it if you don’t like it, Anna.” he pointed out. He was concerned for her as she ate a full plate of unappetizing food.</p>
<p>“But you didn’t waste the food, Alexei.” Anna pointed out as well. She used a gentle tone to mark out this point, “That was very noble of you.”</p>
<p>“The flavor of the food is important, but to me, the practical use of the food itself is enough to satisfy me. To me, continuing to eat the food wouldn’t change anything, but to you, when you continue to finish it on the basis that you don’t like it, then it will become something that will affect your mood.” Karenin’s earnest argument caused Anna to squint her eyes with laughter bubbling up from within her. “Why do you laugh?” Karenin knotted his brow in confusion.</p>
<p>“Nothing.” her eyes twinkled as she spoke. “Regardless, nothing would change my belief that what just occurred was not bad, but good.” she hummed in content.</p>
<p>“If you think this way, then it is well.” Karenin nodded again, then picked up his documents. Internally, Anna sighed once more.</p>
<p>Anna didn’t continue watching Karenin in the afternoon. She brought out a book and began reading. At around three, a worker of the dining car came by and knocked on the door to their carriage.</p>
<p>After the clean table was covered with delectable refreshments, Karenin pushed the cake towards Anna.</p>
<p>It was his own little way to make up for the lunch mishap. She took it gratefully, before realizing he doesn’t even have a cake for himself.</p>
<p>“Do you not want any?” Anna asked, her dimples emerging from her cheeks.</p>
<p>“No.” Karenin spoke concisely. He raised his cup of black coffee, indicating he had all he needed. Anna took a look, then retracted her gaze.</p>
<p>“I need to eat some cake to overcome my shock.” The bitterness of the black coffee and the sweetness of the cake formed a drastic antithesis in her mouth.</p>
<p>“Is it good?” Karenin asked after he took a sip from his cup.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Anna sincerely nodded, “I’m not tricking you this time.” she added offhandedly as he stared at her a little longer.</p>
<p>Karenin nodded in acknowledgment. He must have deemed her statement to be true then. Amidst the fragrance of black coffee and the overbearing sweetness of the cream, Anna decided that it was time for her to be a little more direct.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you want to touch me?” she asked, breaking the silence, and Karenin’s movements froze at her inquiry.</p>
<p>He lowered his coffee back down to its saucer, rising to reach over the top of the table, and over into Anna’s space. When his fingers lightly touched her face, he stopped and asked: “May I?”</p>
<p>“You may.”</p>
<p>Anna’s eyelashes fluttered quickly, but her voice was very certain. She wanted this.</p>
<p>And so, he drew his face closer to her, his fingers lightly grasping her chin, and closed the distance between their lips.</p>
<p>This kiss was a little bitter, but it was also a little sweeter. Anna saved it in her heart, where it was given a special place.</p>
