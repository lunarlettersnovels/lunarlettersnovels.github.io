            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 54 – The Hardest Form of Distraction (1)</strong></p>
<p>After the lunch at their home, Madame Masacci and Anna’s visits became more frequent. With an identity like Mrs. Masacci staying in Russia, it was inevitable that people would want to take the opportunity to be friends with her or at least make her acquaintance. Which was why Anna and Mrs. Masacci were attending a tea party hosted by Countess Lydia together.</p>
<p>Countess Lydia was a dark-skinned, tall and plump woman. Her beautiful black eyes were the most striking part of her appearance. Relying on her birth rank, Countess Lydia had married her husband early, but she was not favored by the other party. It distressed her to no bunds in the first year of their marriage. But then one morning in her garden, she had an epiphany while looking at a dew-covered leaf.</p>
<p>There were more beautiful things in this world besides husbands, beautiful people, that deserved her attention and love far more than her husband did. This thought would have been admirable if it would have given her the strength to love other people along with her husband and not be so bitter, but it was regrettable how it had only caused her to have a detached conscience. Countess Lydia began to love everyone but her husband, even admired her confidant in her circle, the unsmiling official.</p>
<p>Anna didn’t know this. After all, she had never seen her husband and Countess Lydia interacting before this. The first time she saw her, she felt that she was simply cute, but after observing the Countess, she deemed her a bit dull. This dullness did not mean that the Countess lacked intelligence, she used advanced concepts to talk about rights and other things, but her actual behavior was similar to that of Patsy and the other societal ladies. The only difference was that some of the kindness of the lady in front of him was true.</p>
<p>“The matter of our sorority was going well, but some gentlemen just don’t want us to go smoothly. Dear Anna and Helen, you wouldn’t know, they don’t understand our purpose of forming this group at all. It’s not about money or status. We are work hard every day, and we have put forward some constructive opinions. We hope that the government will allocate more money to religion to convey those new thoughts, but they just don’t understand!”</p>
<p>Countess Lydia’s fatigue turned into annoyance, her lips were still a little pale, but her face was so red. That whole afternoon, the Countess was immersed in this anger. Her ladies fully agreed with her ideas, and only Anna and Lady Masacci thought a bit differently. However, both of them were too smart to show it to their host.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In the evening, Karenin sat in his nightgown to do his daily bedtime reading in the study, but today was a little different. His progress was shortened by three tenths because his wife also decided to “read before bedtime” and it became a chat.</p>
<p>“Alexei, what do you think of Countess Lydia?” Anna said.</p>
<p>Karenin withdrew his gaze from another soft chair and some gadgets in the study. It was originally his own study, but now unconsciously it seemed to be of two people. Of course, his wife did not occupy too much space. The changes were relatively minor, but for people with a strong sense of having their own space like Karenin, even if Anna had just put a bean in this study, it would be no less than losing an elephant in Karenin’s private house.</p>
<p>However, Karenin had by now silently accepted this kind of change, which he was a little uncomfortable with at the beginning. He had reimagined his opinions about the space and boundaries that were supposed to exist between a husband and a wife and was more open to change than he had been before his wedding. His stiffness in showing his emotions was slowly giving way to easiness in his gestures and facial expressions.</p>
<p>This kind of emotional perception just behind a small smile wouldn’t be noticed by people like Anna who are more carefree and open with their emotions. But Karenin had learned to deal with it, for in ‘so-called couples’, wasn’t one party always more sensitive and one party responsible for showing carelessness and honesty to the fullest?</p>
<p>“If you mean to ask what most people think of her and her image in the society, it is not too bad. The sisterhood created by her exists for a reason. In fact, sometimes it helps me too. But if you’re asking for my personal opinion, I don’t think it’s important to comment on.”</p>
<p>“I thought it was improper to ask this question. But I realized a bit more about her. No matter her ideas, they’re not really possible after all, but she’s kind enough to think about them, right?” Anna said with a hesitant smile. “I thought nothing of her efforts and even laughed at them. Even though I like to think of myself as a kind person, sometimes I get caught up in the arrogance of human nature quite easily, and I really shouldn’t have.” She confessed.</p>
<p>The honesty his wife had bestowed upon him brought seven points of sincerity and three points of teasing her to Karenin’s mind. He was an expert at analyzing people’s words and judging them instinctively. He wanted to tease her to lighten the atmosphere but he also wanted her to know that what she said was praise-worthy.</p>
<p>“It is admirable that you recognize your mistakes.” Karenin continued, seemingly serious, “If you know your mistakes, you are always a good girl who may be rewarded at Christmas.”</p>
<p>Anna laughed but quickly quietened down after seeing that Karenin was somewhat serious. She did not intend to continue to disturb her husband’s bedtime reading, although it had already been somewhat affected. She folded her hands on the desk, her head slightly resting on her arms, as she looked at her husband softly with her big eyes.</p>
<p>Although Karenin was meticulous and could do his own thing without interruption for as long as he wanted, that did not include being stared at by his wife.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to be distracted anymore, whether it was by words or sight, so he didn’t look up, but said faintly, “Anna, I’m reading.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can see that.”</p>
<p>He raised an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>“If you could look away please.”</p>
<p>Karenin felt that sometimes he really had to make his demands straight and clear for her, although as a government official, he was more accustomed to expressing his thoughts in euphemisms.</p>
<p>“Okay.” She sighed regretfully but had a small smile on her face.</p>
<p>After her intense eyes turned away, Karenin was finally able to fully immerse himself in reading.</p>
