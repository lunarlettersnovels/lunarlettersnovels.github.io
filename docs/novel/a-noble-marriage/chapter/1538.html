            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 14 – A Sensible Thing to Do (2)</strong></p>
<p>Karenin gazed down at his little wife. Hearing her voice out her concerns openly made him realize that it doesn’t matter if he’s rejected or not. “Are you worried about rumors?”</p>
<p>“No. But I’m afraid that they’ll hurt the people I care about.” Anna answered.</p>
<p>“Then you have to be prepared, Anna. We won’t get it right all the time. Until…” Karenin paused before continuing, “Until you are no longer afraid.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be afraid forever.” Anna said resolutely, a light blush dusting her cheeks. She looked up at her husband, and said. “I think we have forgotten one important step, though.”</p>
<p>Karenin raised his eyebrows. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“You do know there’s a sequence before getting married, right?” Anna laughed, embarrassed to be voicing it out loud, “You know… to be in an actual relationship.”</p>
<p>She sat up on her knees, and bunched the quilt and her nightgown to her chest before speaking. “You took my proposal to get married. So you wouldn’t refuse having a serious relationship, right?” The boldness of her words contrasted with how shy she sounded.</p>
<p>It was true that they married in haste. However, in this society, marriages arranged in haste or not had centered on one thing—financial security and reputation. It was more like a job. She didn’t want the marriage to be just outright obligation. Anna wanted them to work as a couple.</p>
<p>Her question lingered in the air, and between them was a persisting silence. The only sound that could be heard was the minute crackling of the flickering candlelight; its strong, intimate scent wafted through the air it’s almost intoxicating. With his little wife knelt on bed with her shoulders half exposed, and a smile adorning her features, Karenin knew nothing else but to agree with what she said. He was entirely captivated at the sight in front of him.</p>
<p>After the long stretch of silence, Karenin answered. “Although I don’t really know much about relationships, I completely agree.”</p>
<p>Anna smiled brightly at that. She was so pleased she almost cheered. However, she restrained herself, blushing once again as she realized the current situation she was in, and pulled the quilt tightly to her chest.</p>
<p>“Do put on your clothes, Anna.” Karenin said in a low voice as he turned around, giving Anna her privacy. She quickly dressed herself with the nightgown and told him that she’s finished, prompting Karenin to face her once again.</p>
<p>His wife was sitting on the edge of the bed with her calves crossed. Her skin seemed to be as white as cow’s milk, more emphasized under the steady glow of the candlelight. She couldn’t keep still as she rubbed her round toes together.</p>
<p>“Don’t do this in front of anyone else.” Karenin said in a rough voice, barely audible.</p>
<p>“What?” Anna asked in a puzzle tone as she looked up at her husband. Karenin strode and squatted in front of her. He brought his hand to her feet, and slid a pair of cotton slippers on, hiding her delicate, white feet from plain view.</p>
<p>No one ever placed shoes for her before, and she never asked that of anyone. She had her back bent slightly, her soft neck turned a little bit to the side, and it felt like her ankle was tingling from Karenin’s caress, warmth spreading throughout her body.</p>
<p>She suddenly laughed and whispered, “Alexei, I have found another reason to marry you.”</p>
<p>A good husband would dutifully place shoes on his wife’s feet, and Anna was completely moved by the sweet gesture.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Karenin asked.</p>
<p>Anna smiled. “I can’t say it now. Let me think. Oh!” Anna exclaimed, her eyes lighting up instantly, “Ah! Now I know what to give you on your birthday!”</p>
<p>She was indeed a peculiar woman. She never failed to surprise him. Karenin couldn’t understand his wife, who seemed to be too caught up in her own head. She was spouting sentences only comprehensible to her, voicing out her thoughts, yet keeping Alexei in the dark.</p>
<p>He watched her, watched how her expressive her face was. He found everything about her was fascinating. She was talking about expectations yet he understood not a phrase.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Karenin could get ahold of himself, he found his feet moving on its own accords and getting closer to the woman in bed. He then crouched to her level and asked,</p>
<p>“Does kissing my own wife meet up with your expectations?”</p>
<p>Anna turned red at the sudden change of atmosphere. “That’s sensible to do, right?”</p>
<p>He closed the gap between them and kissed her square on the lips. His rough lips grazed her soft ones. His scent all over her as they participate in a dance only know to them two.</p>
<p>It was Anna’s second kiss from him, and it was really magical; just like sunshine, grass and rainbows rolled into one.</p>
