            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 25 – Dance Only with Me (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Really? How interesting.” The lady replied with a polite smile, but she had lost interest in Anna. However, Anna finally had the chance to steer the conversation to her liking, and she continued to talk of the production process. But there was no interest from the ladies, and so Anna quieted down and let the others take the lead. She smiled and zoned out of the next boring topic of conversation.</p>
<p>Her throat was a little dry, and she took another sip of black tea. She glanced outside and then around the room, looking for a distraction. She heard a rustle and found Madame de Malere making her way back to the group. “You are back finally,” exclaimed the ladies happily. “Let me have a cup of tea first, ladies,” announced Madame de Malere.</p>
<p>“Don’t you drink tea, Mrs Karenin?” asked Madame de Malere.</p>
<p>“I already finished my cup before you came back,” Anna replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Madame de Malere smiled back at Anna and picked up a silver spoon to store the hot black tea. Then she poured the milk out from the transparent container and stirred her tea again.</p>
<p>“You see, Mrs Karenin, this tea needs to be stirred from time to time, otherwise the effect will be greatly reduced. These whirlpools look very unstable. In fact, without these whirlpools, the delicious taste of tea cannot be completely stabilized.”</p>
<p>Madame de Malere’s red-painted fingers held the teacup gingerly and looked up at Anna.</p>
<p>“Are you all right?”</p>
<p>Anna laughed and picked up her cup of black tea which was cold now. “Everyone has their own preferences. Some people like things in a cup, and naturally they are pursuing the ultimate. Others like me, they don’t like tea very much.”</p>
<p>“What do you like then?” Mrs De Malailer asked almost concerned.</p>
<p>“Just plain water.”</p>
<p>“I have to say that your preferences are entirely different.” Madame de Malere said without a hint of taunt and picked up the transparent container at the same time.</p>
<p>Anna put the cup of cold black tea aside, and then took the glass of water that Madame de Malere poured for her.</p>
<p>“My husband often judges me for this as well.” Anna laughed, and some ladies around her laughed alongside her. They whispered how sweet the young couple was amongst each other.</p>
<p>Madame de Malere continued to drink her tea and the ladies’ conversation continued. Soon, it was time for the dance. The first one was a very cheerful Mazuka dance. The men began to invite the ladies to dance, and Mr De Malere was heard saying, “You have earned the right to dance with my wife first. Your debate just now was wonderful!”</p>
<p>Anna immediately understood who this debate-winning gentleman was. If it wasn’t her husband, to be honest, she would find it very curious indeed. “Mrs Karenin, do I have the honor to invite you to this opening dance?” The fat and kind Mr de Malere asked kindly.</p>
<p>“Of course, Mr de Malere.” Anna stood up and gave him a curtsy. She couldn’t refuse it, and she knew that Karenin wouldn’t even understand it. Mr De Malere was not a funny man, but he danced well and was very secure in his footing. They talked casually about things that were not really interesting, but the gentleman seemed to have a low laugh point. To outsiders, they seemed to talk very speculatively.</p>
<p>The song was coming to its end. Anna smiled at the fat gentleman and said, “The first dance is for the country, and the second dance belongs to the partner.”</p>
<p>Mr de Malere laughed again and nodded in agreement with Anna. “Everyone says I am a fool who just tumbles into happiness, but they don’t know how fun it is to be such a fool.” Mr De Malere winked at Anna.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the next dance, Mr De Malere performed an incredible act with his fat but sure skills on the dance floor. Two women met in midair. Madame de Malere smiled at Anna to keep her composure and Anna smiled back, wishing to appear oblivious.</p>
<p>Karenin drew her into the next dance and she felt the heat coming off where his hands touched her. They began to dance, guided by her husband. She looked up at Karenin and hesitated. Then Anna whispered softly, “Mine. No one else’s”.</p>
<p>“What?” Karenin didn’t hear her clearly.</p>
<p>Anna looked at him with a charming smile at the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>“You are mine. Dance only with me. I am defending the happiness of two people.” She insisted because she truly believed Mr de Malere to be a man with honor and good intentions toward his wife.</p>
<p>“Who else would I be with?” Karenin asked frowning slightly.</p>
<p>Now it was Anna’s turn to pause. Karenin’s blue eyes became deep in intensity. After a while, he said in a calm tone “Let’s talk about this problem later.”</p>
