            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 52 – Anna’s Marital Treaty (1)</strong></p>
<p>“You can invite them over for lunch, Alexei. Mrs. Masacci and I will have a talk about the scarf that I made, and you gentlemen can talk more about your business.” Anna smiled slyly, satisfied at the suggestion she had made.</p>
<p>“Can you do that?” Karenin asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, I would love to.” she replied confidently with a small laugh, happy that she had found a way to help her husband.</p>
<p>Karenin had never seen a woman like his wife, who was so loyal to her husband’s cause. In his circle, ladies usually did not bother to make suggestions to help improve their husbands’ work life.</p>
<p>After a while, while Anna was at her desk planning how to entertain the invited couple, Karenin watched her from behind and a thought crossed his mind, ‘I am very happy too.’ He was happy, not only because of this incident, but because his wife enjoyed helping him and actively participating in his life. They were true partners, not just ‘man and wife’, and it made him immensely happy. He had gotten more than what he originally thought he would get. He walked up silently to his wife, bent over slightly, and listened to her murmuring to herself as she wrote. He smiled, enjoying the moment.</p>
<p>He ordered the footman to deliver the hand-written invitation letter to Mrs. Masacci. He observed Anna’s beautiful hand-writing. She still made some grammatical errors but being her unpaid tutor, he was always there to help her.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for them to receive a reply from Mrs. Masacci. Asking Anna to write the invitation letter, as a kind of idle lunch between the hostess and the female guest, a bit of the political meaning was blurred, making this invitation more personal and considerate, rather than a formulaic rhetoric one.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Although the two families understood the purpose of the meal, Mrs. Masacci really wanted to meet Mrs. Karenin.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that my wife is more interested in another lady than I am, and she is still a Russian lady.” Mr. Masacci began to chatter again in the foyer before the hosts arrived.</p>
<p>“Stop complaining, Freddy.” Mrs. Masacci rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, now you hate me again. You weren’t like that before we got married!” Mr. Masacci grumbled and sniffed. “It defied me at first but now I finally understand why people say marriage is the grave of love.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Masacci smiled softly and decided to tease him even more.</p>
<p>“That’s right, I don’t like your chatter.” She commented but took his hand in hers and squeezed it.</p>
<p>“If I don’t chatter, you forget that your husband is still in front of you.” Mr. Masacci said in better spirits.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When a servant informed Anna that they had arrived, Anna and Karenin went to greet the couple. Mr. Masacci wore a regular suit, while Mrs. Masacci wore an earth-colored dress. Her dark blonde hair was twisted into a nice bun, according to the latest trend. Her sea-blue eyes were filled with wonder when she saw Anna.</p>
<p>Anna had chosen to wear an apricot-red satin skirt with a white lace lining, her Italian calfskin red boots peeking from beneath, and a half-sleeved white lace blouse with a large bow on the chest. Red lace ribbons held her thick, coiled ebony hair away from her face, and no matter how hard she tried they fell at a crooked angle. She decided to leave the ribbons as they were, hoping they looked unique and not untidy.</p>
<p>Anna knew that the other party was looking at her, so she simply let Mrs. Masacci scrutinize her generously, before she stretched out her arms to hug the diplomat’s wife, and kissed her on the cheeks. She had gotten used to this, but fortunately, she didn’t get any ill-feeling from Mrs. Masacci.</p>
<p>As hosts, Anna and Karenin ushered the Masaccis into the spacious living room, where exquisite tea sets and refreshments were placed.</p>
<p>“Mr. Masacci, Madam, please enjoy these Russian desserts. Our chef, Sasha, is very good at making them.” Anna gestured towards the side table.</p>
<p>It was a sweet cookie made with chocolate and jam, with an authentic Russian flavor. Anna gave them a plate. After all, they were facing a lady who was probably picky about what she ate.</p>
<p>Mrs. Masacci took a bite, the rich chocolate and the mellow jam were mixed in a good ratio, forming a not too sweet taste, with a little sourness.</p>
<p>“It’s really delicious!” Mr. Masacci complimented first, and began eating his second cookie.</p>
<p>“Freddy is always enthusiastic about sweets. Please excuse him for his behavior.” Mrs. Masacci was a little embarrassed about her husband’s lack of restraint.</p>
<p>“My dear, they are really great. You can’t blame me.” Mr. Masacci said somewhat innocently, while swallowing a fourth cookie.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to apologize at all, dear Madam, an empty dish is the most supreme compliment for the chef!” Anna said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Karenin is right, my dear.” Mr. Masacci said, picking another cookie in his hand. Then he looked at Karenin and said bluntly, “You don’t like sweets. You’re missing out on the third greatest happiness in life.”</p>
<p>Karenin took a sip of tea and said, “I feel sorry about it too.”</p>
<p>The conversation between the two seemed nothing special, but Anna felt her heart stutter after hearing what Mr. Masacci said. She was surprised. Karenin was the least fond of exposing his preferences in front of others. But Mr. Masacci, who seemed a little innocent, had observed it, and Karenin hadn’t tried to deny it.</p>
