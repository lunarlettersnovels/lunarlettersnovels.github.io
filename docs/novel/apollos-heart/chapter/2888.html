            <p><strong>Chapter 117 – All For You, Miss Han (1)</strong></p>
<p>Jae-won opened the steel door in haste. The sensor light turned on and brightened up the classically-designed living room. There was not a soul in this plush place, but the couch and the appliances appeared to be in good shape.</p>
<p>He then started to unpack in the kitchen. “Water, electricity, and gas are all good to use. There’s a sensor on the outer walls, so if someone touches it or goes as much as near it, the windows will automatically shut down and the alarm will go off. The windows are all bulletproof, and I heard the steel door is potent too, and it won’t let anyone in unless it’s unlocked with the master key.”</p>
<p>“Just like a fortress.” She remarked.</p>
<p>“I heard that the owner is very sensitive about security. I guess that’s why he was so positive that you’ll be safe in here.”</p>
<p>Once he had filled the refrigerator with the things he had brought over, the two went to take a look around the house. He flinched at the sight of a silhouette of an animal in front of the living room. Yuri was surprised at the unexpected sight as well. She didn’t know Sebastian would be here. Jae-won amusedly examined the taxidermized dog.</p>
<p>“Do you know this dog?” Yuri asked.</p>
<p>“Of course I do. He’s a dog that Tae-jun used to be very fond of.” came his reply.</p>
<p>“Why is Sebastian here?”</p>
<p>Jae-won paused for a second before hesitating to say, “Tae-jun han-handed it to me to keep for a while.”</p>
<p>Though she found his reply unconvincing, Yuri proceeded to ask the things she was most curious about, “If he was so fond of him, shouldn’t he have cremated or buried it? Not stuff it like this?” Yuri argued in a slightly hostile tone.</p>
<p>He considered her words for a moment. “I felt the same when I first heard that he’d stuffed the dog. But after examining his leg today, I think I know what he was thinking. Tae-jun wanted to fix Sebastian’s leg.”</p>
<p>“His … his leg?” It was quite an unexpected answer.</p>
<p>“His hind leg was almost crushed while he was hunting. Everyone said he should be put down since he wouldn’t be able to live long, but Tae-jun disagreed to this. The dog went through a couple of surgeries but still wasn’t able to stand properly. He spent the rest of his life in bed, and Tae-jun constantly took care of him. He even dealt with the feces himself.”</p>
<p>“Tae-jun did so himself?” She was visibly stunned. She had never thought that the cold and arrogant scion of the Seo Group had such a side to him.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t believe it either until I saw it with my own eyes. How could a man be this devoted!” He shrugged his shoulders. He could understand her incredulity, given the infamous nonchalant aura that his cousin perpetually emanated, but he was a witness to his veiled, gentle side.</p>
<p><em>Devoted ….</em> It was a strange choice of word for the man she knew- the one who dealt with things in a cut throat manner. However, now that she thought about it, it was actually Tae-jun who’d jumped into the river to save her life, took care of her when she was unconscious, and the one to embrace her when she was having a panic attack in the middle of the road. When she pitted this side of him with his usual indifference, she seemed to have realised there was another side to the man that she had failed to consider.</p>
<p>What once used to push her to despair, she viewed it today with whole new eyes. Gazing into Sebastian’s glass eyes that still felt alive, his straight limbs, a picture on the relentless Tae-jun meticulously tending to the bedridden canine emerged in her mind. She was aware that someone had been affectionately taking care of her while she was unconscious. The touch was very gentle yet intimate.</p>
<p><em>Was he the same with Sebastian? Perhaps it’s his way of expressing love …</em></p>
<p>Jae-won looked at Yuri, then spoke up. “It shouldn’t be news to you, but Tae-jun’s marriage is not simply a marriage. It was a collaborated project with Dae-jin. The penalty is incredibly steep. And it’s not only just money, but stocks of eight different companies depend on this. Still, Tae-jun is willing to risk it all and give up the marriage. All for you, Miss Han.”</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>Jae-won insisted that she lock the door properly before he left. All alone now, Yuri sat on the couch and looked at Sebastian.</p>
<p><em>I’m sorry that I said I don’t want to see you.</em></p>
<p><em>It wasn’t you that I didn’t want to see. I saw my low self-esteem through you …. That’s why ….</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Still, Tae-jun is willing to risk it all and give up the marriage. All for you, Miss Han.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>To live with you, Miss Han.</strong></em></p>
<p>Jae-won had added.</p>
<p>The words that lingered in her ears, simultaneously reminded of what Ta-jun had said to her four years ago.</p>
<p><em><strong>After the contract ends … no … ignoring the contract and living with me anyhow.</strong></em></p>
<p>Yuri let out a deep sigh. She had yet to recover and all this sudden influx of changes had unconsciously exhausted her. She lay her head on the couch, and before she knew it fell asleep.</p>
<p>One didn’t know how much time had passed, but she was awoken by the sound of the opening and closing of the main door.</p>
