        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 47</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before she had taken her finger off the doorbell, the door had already soundlessly opened. A surge of emotions flooded her senses as fragments of memories assaulted her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was then that a curt voice brought her thoughts to an abrupt halt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re late.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing at the door, an unbuttoned shirt clinging on his skin, an alarming glint in his dark orbs was the man from her canvas … her nightmares–Tae Jun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri soon reined in her composure and retorted in an impassive manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You didn’t tell me I had a fixed time to keep.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun moved sideways with a raised brow. He noticed she still had her sharp tongue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come in,” he said unceremoniously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the girl stood rooted to her spot, she had no intention of stepping in and she made sure to make her purpose of visit clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I only came to get back the tablet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun shot her a lazy glance, his eyes still and unfathomable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re free to stand there all night if you want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went back inside without another word. He knew her all too well, her defiance and courage. He also knew how to get her to do his bidding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri had no choice but to follow him. The door closed behind her with an ominous sound. Tae-jun was sitting on the living room sofa with a lit cigarette. She felt his gaze on her through the smoke as she slowly sat on the opposite side. She tried to speak without betraying any emotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please give it back to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun’s smile did not reach his eyes, and Yuri was afraid all the more for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You still don’t know me?” He sniggered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t remember.” She replied impassively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, I’ll have to make you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun rose, his hand found her face. She felt like lightning had struck her in his touch. There was a hand that caressed her face in the past. She gasped out loud and sank back to the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wa-wait!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised by the sound she made, Yuri clasped a hand over her mouth. Her heart was pounding as it would burst. Tremors ran down her body in fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun only laughed at her response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you remember now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I, I don’t know what happened, but I lost parts of my memory. Especially the last four to five years of my life. So I can’t remember you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember telling you not to fool around with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ends of his lips twisted. Tae-jun removed the cigarette from his mouth and slowly stubbed it out on the ashtray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How can you be sure?” Yuri probed him, her eyes searching his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You respond to me. Then, now, you’re still trembling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri tried to hide her hands, but it was too late. He knew exactly how she would react. Her already pale face turned ashen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s because-“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why, is it a selective memory loss?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll explain.” She then cleared her throat before continuing. “I received a hypnosis treatment for my memory, and afterward I saw you in my dreams. I don’t know anything about you except your face. If Ms. Yoon had not introduced us, I would have never known your name.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What caused your memory loss?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri hesitated before replying. “I don’t know. I don’t even remember what happened then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, her explanation didn’t sound plausible to the man before her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It must be convenient for you to say that you don’t remember everything I ask. Don’t you have a better excuse or an explanation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His sneer deepened instead, Yuri felt faint. She did not want to face him, who seemed to be not interested in having a conversation and only interrogated her. She was tormented by her memory loss. She had lost her father, her friend, and herself. The trauma had burdened her so much that she could not create her pieces anymore. If there was an excuse or an explanation, she was the one who wanted to hear it the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you want to hear from me? I told you I don’t remember!” She was agitated, she wished to be left alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You might want to remember when there’s a chance. That is if you don’t want other people to get involved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean?” It was a sheer sign of threat hurled at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The man who is your boss and your teacher is well-esteemed in his profession. His skills and reputation hold up, and people tell me his uncle is a successful entrepreneur in that field too. I can easily make trouble for them if there’s something in it for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri’s pale face now reddened in anger. The situation she found herself in did not make any sense. A man who took what was hers made her come to him and was now threatening her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She glared at Tae-jun. “I can make trouble for you too. Do you want me to call Ms. Yoon? I can say that your fiancé is throwing baseless threats at me after calling me to his hotel room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, surprisingly, her words didn’t have as much effect on him. Tae-jun only smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do it.” He provoked her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?!” Yuri was stunned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do it. I don’t care.” She was taken aback by his response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how she looked at him to catch a glimpse of his thoughts, his face did not betray anything. Actually, he was looking at her with amusement.</span></p>
