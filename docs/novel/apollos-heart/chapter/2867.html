            <p><strong>Chapter 138 – The Wrong Woman (1)</strong></p>
<p>The banquet hall was gradually becoming chaotic. In-bae Lee, the potential presidential candidate, was giving a speech on the podium. The moderator tried to shush the audience, but the murmurs were only becoming more audible.</p>
<p>In-bae Lee could not hide his discontentment as he concluded the speech. <em>What’s wrong with everyone? How dare they… during his speech…</em></p>
<p>As he stepped down the podium in a grumpy mood, his manager walked up to him with a pale face. “Sir, there has been a problem.”</p>
<p>In-bae Lee violently pulled on his tie and barked, “What problem?”</p>
<p>“Ummm…  A scandal just spread. It is named the ‘Lee Gate’,” The manager cautiously said.</p>
<p>“What the hell?! What kind of a fool spread such a rumor?!”</p>
<p>Instead of replying, the manager handed him a tablet. As he swiped and tapped on the screen, In-bae Lee’s face dyed in various shades until it was bloody red in the end. He hollered in fury, “Find out who initially spread the rumor, and bring Sang-gu here. Right now!”</p>
<p><em>Who could possibly be aware of the existence of the ledger when it had yet to be exposed?  He had almost made it to the top… He was not going to allow a stupid scandal to ruin everything!</em></p>
<p>Not anyone could become a mayor, politician, then a senator from a crappy background and a poor laborer father. He was aiming to become the next president of the country. And of course, he had done some great things that typical men could never imagine.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Aren’t you sick of being called a useless, cheap gangster? If you help me, you will be able to hold power at a larger scale.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Everyone who was aware of the relationship between Myung-je Jin and him, insulted Jin. However, that was not exactly the reality. In-bae Lee was the one who first lent out a hand to a trash like Myung-je Jin and made great use of him. Of course, Jin tried to play games with vile intentions as well, but he was too much of an easy opponent for In-bae Lee. He had decided to deal with Jin once he was done using him to his advantage. There was no need to be associated with him beyond that. Then, he would go one step further to be in charge of the throne. Thus, there must not be room for errors. Not even one!</p>
<p>In-bae Lee was clenching his jaws so hard that his teeth almost broke as he exited the banquet hall and headed to the office. He got into the car and made a phone call.</p>
<p>“It is me.”</p>
<ul>
<li>”Yes.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“Status update?”</p>
<ul>
<li>”More serious than expected. She is unconscious and is wearing an oxygen mask. I asked the doctor, and she might have brain damage from inhaling all that toxic gas.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“Good news for us. Get all the information organized and hand it over to me. Include the location of the room, the guards, the nurses, and when Tae-jun Seo leaves the room.”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Yes, Sir. Oh by the way! About the new apartment. I don’t like it, It’s too small. I would also like another credit card. One to use at the department stores as a VIP customer.”</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Too small?</em> He almost scoffed. <em>A luxurious apartment located in the middle of Gangnam was not enough?</em> He suppressed his frustration. Now was not the time. He decided to reluctantly give him what he asked for.</p>
<p>“I understand. I will tell my manager to give you all the options you like.”</p>
<p>In-bae Lee was furious that he had to deal with such a burden. He yelled at Sang-gu Park, who was just entering the office, “You hopeless son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>If Myung-je Jin was the knife in In-bae’s hand, then Sang-gu was his shadow. The shadow that cleaned up after all the nasty crimes Lee had committed. An extremely dedicated one too. In-bae Lee had noticed the man’s inherently satanic nature ever since he worked in the factory. Then, he intentionally approached Sang-gu, and groomed him per his liking.</p>
<p>“You made such a mess because you couldn’t even kill off the right bitch!”</p>
<p>“I apologize. I never expected it to be so—”</p>
<p>“No more excuses. What about the ledger? Are you positive that the ledger hasn’t been exposed to the public?”</p>
<p>“Yes. From what I have researched, the prosecutors and the police are not aware of its existence. The media are silent also.”</p>
<p><em>For now, but eventually, they will find out. And those useless bastards won’t let go!</em> In-bae Lee massaged his temples with pressure and asked, “What happened to Hye-seong Jin, the hopeless punk?”</p>
<p>“The Drug Enforcement Team is dealing with him. They must have made a compromise to not speak about the shooting or the fire to get hold of Hye-seong’s people. He is barely holding onto his life anyway. He was too injured from the shooting. The headline should only mention an internal conflict among the drug dealers, and that would be beneficial for the lighthouse.”</p>
