            <p><strong>Chapter 121 – To Be President (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Weren’t President Jin and In-Bae Lee on the same boat? Why did Hye-Yeon Jin—“</p>
<p>“No, they weren’t on the same side. They were estranged since the Star Road incident. And it seems like In-Bae Lee didn’t want anything to do with it, getting rid of all the data that contained his involvement.”</p>
<p>The list and books owned by President Jin would benefit In-Bae Lee greatly since he was planning to run for the next presidential election. In-Bae Lee must have hoped to deal with President Jin one way or the other since the trust they once shared had already been broken due to the Star Road case, which led to both Yuri’s father and Hye-yeon’s unfortunate deaths.</p>
<p>Yuri shut her eyes tightly, tears streaming down her cheeks. Tae-jun pulled her into a tight embrace as he wiped her tear-stricken face with his fingers.</p>
<p>Her shoulders were shaking slightly. She pulled from his embrace as she looked at him, speaking in a thick voice. “I can’t forgive the man who killed my father and Hye-Yeon. I can’t allow him to become president when he had done all those dirty things and killed a man to cover it up. I’m going to destroy him, whatever it takes!”</p>
<p>“Let me do it for you,” Tae-jun whispered softly.</p>
<p>Yuri shook her head. “I’ll do it myself. And from the Seoin Group’s perspective, In-Bae Lee is the best choice to become the next president. I hope you don’t give up on something just because of me. The same goes for marriage, too.”</p>
<p>Yuri was firm in her stance, genuine concern evident in her voice. The burdens they were facing were weighing her down, and her own problems were already overwhelming, to begin with.</p>
<p>“Do I look like someone who gives up easily?” Tae-jun asked.</p>
<p>Yuri looked down and shook her head. With her head filled up with thoughts, she knew that letting him in would only entail consequences on his part, and he would surely suffer from it. Tae-jun wanting to help was already enough for Yuri.</p>
<p>However, Tae-jun remained resolute in his stance. “And even if I lose something, that would never compare to everything that I’ve lost in the last four years,” he said, trying to make her see the meaning behind his words.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>His eyes fluttered open and scanned the room as he heard a faint sound coming from the outside. He let the sunbeams shine directly on his face, his silhouette casting on the wall. He had a good sleep after a few days of pure chaos, so deep that he didn’t notice Yuri slip out of his arms. He quickly went out of the room and followed the sound.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Tae-jun asked as he entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>A mouth-watering smell wafted through the air, along with the crisp sound of the sizzling, simmering from a cooking pan.</p>
<p>“I got hungry so I’m preparing a quick meal,” Yuri said, turning the burner down before facing Tae-jun. Her gaze zeroed in on the wound around his eyes, the bruise appearing bigger and swollen under the bright fluorescent light. “Does it hurt?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It’s all right. It’s just a little tear, that’s all. Don’t worry about it.” Tae-jun reassured as he gazed at her fondly. He gulped silently as his mind wandered elsewhere, his eyes trailing down Yuri’s form. He was completely sidetracked by the woman in front of him, and it seemed like he needed water to pacify his raging thirst.</p>
<p>Yuri, who had no idea what was going on inside Tae-jun’s mind, smiled in his direction. “I’ll prepare you some food. Sit down.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun obediently followed, sitting down as Yuri prepared the table. It was the first time he saw Yuri doing something in the kitchen, and it was a sight to behold. Someone else had prepared the food and did the chores when they stayed together a while back, so he was quite enthralled to see her preparing everything by herself. She prepared a simple meal, but it was delicious nonetheless.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to cook?”</p>
<p>“I can do the basics because I lived with my father. I think I’ve lived off side dishes.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun spooned out a hefty amount of stew from the pan and placed it on his plate. He quickly munched down on the dish as Yuri fidgeted on her spot. “How does it taste?”</p>
<p>“This is delicious, Yuri,” Tae-jun said, smiling at her.</p>
<p>“The rice was from an instant pack, though. Jae-won prepared this and that.” Yuri answered, pointing at the ingredients.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter.” Tae-jun waved her off as he finished the meal prepared for him.</p>
<p>After the meal, Yuri placed the empty dishes into the sink. She turned the faucet on and grabbed the plate, and a sponge on one hand. She was about to wash the dishes when Tae-jun hugged her from behind, she let out a small squeak.</p>
<p>“I’ll go home tomorrow,” Tae-jun said.</p>
<p>Yuri blinked. “Tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“I told you. This is all over. All I have to do now is to meet up with Si-yeon Yoon and arrange the compensation.”</p>
<p>“Will this be resolved quickly?” she asked, lowering the plate onto the sink.</p>
<p>Tae-jun turned Yuri’s waist. They were now facing each other as he placed his hands on either side of her.</p>
<p>I said I wouldn’t do it even if I died, what would he do? His son is in such a good condition now, look at him. A son would have been better than a grandson.</p>
<p>[E/D: TJ is being sarcastic here, his grandfather actually lost his son(TJ’s dad), and so he is taking a jab at the old man.]</p>
<p>“So that’s why—” Yuri muttered as she traced the wound on Tae-jun’s eye with her fingertips. <em>Why do people care so much about the cuts on their skins?</em></p>
<p>Tae-jun snaked his arms around Yuri’s waist, pulling her close as he hugged her. He placed a tender kiss on her temple. “I wasn’t as strong as I used to be. I thought it would take a little more time, so I’ve really prepared myself.”</p>
<p>“Prepared yourself?” Yuri asked, looking up at him.</p>
<p>“I’m preparing to be the president.”</p>
