            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 24</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun reflexively opened his eyes.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was that all about, this nasty nightmare?!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He automatically reached for the cigarettes on the bedside table. With an unlit cigarette held in his mouth, and with both hands, brushed back his hair drenched in sweat.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did she feel every time she was with him, when he moaned and cried the name of another woman?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun found it difficult to contain himself. He felt suffocated.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning saw Mr. Lee clicking his tongue at the sight of his boss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pale face, eyes bloodshot that even the thick-rimmed Tom Ford eyeglasses were able to conceal, he seemed like a walking billboard for a ghost movie.[1] </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did something happen to him? Haiz, will he be able to survive the day?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Lee felt restless, only to be assuaged by Jin-wook’s appearance. He couldn’t see what Jin-wook had brought with him, but was hoping that it would calm their boss, who was starting to resemble a starving beast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s that girl’s name?” This was Tae-jun’s first question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s Yuri Han. Yu-ri-Han.” Jin-wook carefully articulated each syllable of her name.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri Han.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tae-jun etched the name into his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She was born in Seoul but went to middle and high schools in Jinseong. She entered H Arts University to study painting but dropped out. She grew up with Hye-yeon Jin. They went to the same middle school and high school, and as Miss Han’s father was Mr. Jin’s chauffeur, they lived in the same place[2] . She is highly regarded by those around her and has won an impressive number of awards at school. She seems considerably talented.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-wook then produced a picture of her, and documents including newspaper articles on the awards that she had won.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s you, Yuri Han!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her father wasn’t Myeong-Je Jin, but his driver, Su-won Han.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information about the woman he had spent a year with continued to pour in, albeit under the new name: Yuri Han.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And apparently, she has often filled in for Hye-yeon Jin at Hotel Jinseong. I’ve confirmed this with the former manager at the hotel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Filled in?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His lips, with a cigarette lodged in between, distorted imperceptibly.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see… So, that’s how it all began!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But Hyeon-ah Kim said that she didn’t recognize her from the photo. Why did she lie?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sure. I was suspicious about that too and pressed her a bit more, but she didn’t give an answer. I couldn’t figure her out. And there’s a questionable rumor that she used to be Mr. Jin’s mistress. Shall I dig around?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no need. She’s not important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun picked up the photo of the girl who had been evading him… tormenting him. It seemed to have been taken when she was in university. It was that same smile from his memory, the one that filled him with a burning desire to have her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling every one of his cells simultaneously react, he took a drag deep into his lungs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where is Yuri Han now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My apologies, but I’m yet to figure that out. According to the immigration records, she left for the US four years ago and returned to Korea only recently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why go to the US?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her uncle, that is, the elder brother of her late mother, appears to be married to an American and running a business there. With her father deceased as well, he would have been the only family left for her to depend on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did her father die? Was he ill?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In fact…” Jin-wook rubbed his chin. “…It was a hit-and-run. And interestingly, this accident occurred around the time Yuri Han went missing.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hit-and-run.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tae-jun slowly blinked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the day of her disappearance, Yuri’s face in the CCTV footage seemed frantic. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if this was because her father had just died?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Yuri herself would know the answer. He stubbed the cigarette into the ashtray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll look into the American side of things. What about Hye-seong Jin?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have located him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Took you long enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seoin Group’s resources, coupled with Jin-wook’s personal network, was quite impressive. He could name any politician or executive at a rival company, and have detailed information on their family and bank accounts delivered within hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hye-seong had hid so well that it had taken the ‘cadaver dog’ [3] days to locate him. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was there a reason for him to disappear?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-wook shrugged. “I haven’t had this much difficulty in a long time. He didn’t report his new address to the city government, has no bank account or credit card under his name, not even a cell phone!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can I meet him today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will make it happen. But sir, is it necessary to meet him, when we now know that the girl is Yuri Han?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun set down the picture of Yuri on the table. His gaze deepened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to know why he made her pretend to be Hye-yeon. And he needs to pay a price for deceiving me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood, sir.” Jin-wook lowered his head and walked out of the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun instructed Mr. Lee to block all calls and visitors. He spent the day looking carefully through each piece of information about Yuri Han that Jin-wook had brought.</span></p>
<p><b><i>You’re mistaken!</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sh*t! She must have come that day to disabuse me of my notions!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun could hear her voice from that meeting like it was happening right now. He had not listened to her and connected her with President Jin directly. He recalled her face, turning pale with fright.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myung-je Jin probably threatened her!</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>To you, I’m just a doll named ‘Hye-yeon Jin’.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scenes after scenes replayed in his mind. Her every word, action that had felt absurd then, suddenly made sense. Why she hadn’t wanted to leave any pictures while living together, why she had hesitated whenever he called her name, why she hadn’t told him anything about herself…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He lit his cigarette while gazing at the photograph of the girl and said aloud, “Excellent! You’ve played the role of ‘Hye-yeon Jin’ perfectly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had thought that learning her name would rid him of this suffocating feeling, but there was no end to it… It also didn’t help that Yuri was smiling so beautifully in the picture.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
