            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 52</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early the next morning, Tae-jun was jolted awake by painful cries. He opened his eyes and turned on the bedside lamp only to find Yuri huddled on the bed, shaking in a cold sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun laid a hand on her forehead and immediately retracted it. Her entire body was burning up. Wasting no time, he called Jin-ho, who was quick to respond despite the early hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I need you to come to the hotel right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now? What happened? Are you hurt?” A puzzled voice queried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not me, but someone else. She has a high fever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ending the call, Tae-jun went to the bathroom and fetched a damp, warm towel. He carefully wiped Yuri’s frail body covered with the marks he had left. She looked as if she would crumble to pieces at any moment like a dry flower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun was slowly moving his hand when his gaze stopped between Yuri’s legs. Watching the c*m slowly flowing out of her swollen nether regions, he felt himself going hard. He had intentionally left his marks on her and dressed her in his shirt. He was marking his territory… it brought him satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after, Jin-ho arrived. He gaped at the room filled with traces of what had happened and the Yuri lying unconscious on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It wasn’t forced, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-ho looked as if he was going to call Jin-wook right there as he took out his cell phone. If it was a criminal case, it was for his brother, not him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun simply ignored the implications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the problem?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question galled Jin-ho. He didn’t know if Tae-jun was blind or deranged. He was screaming in his mind: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at her! The parts that are visible are wreathed with palm prints and crimson bruises.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Jin-ho managed to swallow his words and put his cell phone back where it came from. He carefully checked her temperature and blood pressure, injected an antipyretic, and an IV drip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She seems to be weak from fatigue, and I can only give her fever reducers because she has a high fever. We have to wait until she wakes up. She doesn’t have any chronic diseases, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These were in her bag. She seems to be taking them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun showed Jin-ho the pills he took one by one from Yuri’s bag. Jin-ho adjusted his glasses with a frown as he examined each one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, and sedatives. And these are-“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-ho also carefully went over the white pills. “I have seen these for the first time. There’s no name, and what’s more, she’s taking them all?” His shock was evident in his eyes. He turned to look at the unconscious figure, and then again at the medicines in his hand and shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Analyze the components. Don’t take them to Seoin Pharmaceutics but to another lab.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A different lab?” He wasn’t sure what the man, who owned a state-of-the-art lab, intended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Somewhere not under the chairman’s influence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the purpose was clear, the doctor bobbed his head in understanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know a place personally. It will take some time, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun nodded. He was determined to get the bottom of those pills and away from the prying eyes of his grandfather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Jin-ho was packing his medical bag, Tae-jun gently held a cold towel on Yuri’s forehead. Looking at the scene, the doctor was stunned, mouth agape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovering his senses before he was even discovered, he said, “I’ve injected some antipyretics into her, but she needs to be checked upon because her temperature is too high. I’ll send a nurse along.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No need, I’ll do it. Leave the fever reducers and the IV drip.” A cold voice instructed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re going to do this by yourself?” Jin-ho asked in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun had received a well-rounded education since his childhood which even included simple treatments. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to think this frosty devil would nurse someone…?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-ho shrugged and put the fever reducers, and the IV drips out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun headed to the bar in the living room as Jin-ho cleaned up again. He filled a glass with his favorite whiskey and asked Jin-ho if he wanted one. Jin-ho shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have a special case early in the morning,” he said, declining the offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I need to ask you one thing. Can memories of only a certain period disappear? It’s a memory loss that does not affect daily life or one’s personal information, but pertains to a certain period and a certain person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This particular thing had been hounding Tae-jun ever since he’d found out about it. A person with a memory loss was not uncommon. An accident, age… many had suffered from this. However, this whole “selective amnesia” was a novel concept to him… and preposterous at that. If one had to forget, one would forget everything, why just a specific thing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-ho tilted his head at the sudden question. Since his arrival, this man had been tossing him surprises. The room, the girl, and now this question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sighing inwardly, he said, “I’m not a psychiatrist, but to the best of my knowledge, it is plausible. A person can lose memories of some months or years, or perhaps a certain person or a case. There are many examples, and films and TV shows have used this quite often.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun’s brows furrowed. “What’s the cause?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are many. It might be a physical accident or the aftereffects of an operation. There could also be psychological issues, and I can’t say anything for certain because the human brain is delicate and complicated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are those symptoms permanent, or can they be cured?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It depends. Transient global amnesia is different in cause, symptom, and period case by case. Fortunately, memory loss of a certain period can be cured through the passage of time or when an opportunity pops up. Of course, there is a chance the loss is permanent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Opportunity?” Tae-jun’s sharp eyes hooked onto the doctor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Places, people, and actions that are relevant to the lost memory. Why do you ask?” The doctor didn’t want to let go of the rare chance to ask a question of his own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun emptied the glass and went back to the bedroom instead of replying, throwing back a “You did well. Go now.” as he did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an impassive face, Jin-ho watched Tae-jun walking away from him. Something was happening. Perhaps it had already happened, like how a butterfly’s wings fluttered in the air heralding torrential rains.</span></p>
