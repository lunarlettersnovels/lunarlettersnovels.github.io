            <p><strong>Chapter 130 – An Old Friend (1)</strong></p>
<p>The plan was simple. Yuri was going to use the big guy that came at her like a dog in heat. He would call her ‘beautiful’, grope her breasts and legs whenever he injected the drug into her. While she felt like throwing up every time she thought of his gooey eyes or disgusting breath, there was no other recourse.</p>
<p>If she wanted to escape this hell hole, this was her last chance. She had to do it before the drug was injected, for it left to after, her muscles would loosen, and she would lose consciousness. And that meant she would not be able to even think of escaping. It took her longer and longer to wake up after taking the drugs these days, anyone could guess how this would end.</p>
<p>A memory of a woman surfaced in her mind. When Yuri had first started living on President Jin’s premises, she had accidentally entered the main house. There, she saw a woman, ashen and thin like a wraith. She was drooling as she lay unconscious on a bed. There were injection marks all over her arms like holes on old trees. She was none other than Myung-je Jin’s wife, who had in less than a year died of cardiac arrest without ever recognizing her son and daughter. According to Hye-yeon, her last words had been to give her drugs.</p>
<p><em>If I am ruined like that maybe …</em></p>
<p>Yuri fiddled with the sheets for a moment but pushed away from the thoughts by thinking about the things her father had entrusted her. He would not have given them to her had he thought the end would be as such. He had given them so she could escape the clutches of these despicable people.</p>
<p><em>Right, let’s not think extreme thoughts. It’s all right, I can do this.</em></p>
<p>A quivering Yuri willed herself to stand up and trudged to the bathroom to wash herself. While she wanted to wash the clothes she was wearing, it seemed impossible. She prepared herself mentally and waited for the burly guy to arrive.</p>
<p>“Beautiful.”</p>
<p>The big guy was surprised. Unlike usual, she was wide awake.</p>
<p>“You seem awake today.”</p>
<p>“—My body feels strange. It hurts.”</p>
<p>Yuri intentionally writhed on the bed, the big guy gulped at her shapely legs spread out inside her skirts.</p>
<p>“Oh, you haven’t had a hit for two days, right?’ The big guy took out an ampule and a syringe as he spoke while preparing the shot. “Your body must be itching. I’ll make you feel good right now.”</p>
<p>“No, not the medicine.” Yuri snapped.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>She deliberately lowered her voice. “I’m craving something else now.”</p>
<p>Yuri lowered her eyes, the big guy’s mouth opened happily wide.</p>
<p>However, he still carefully confirmed seemingly grasping on to his last thread of reason. “You, the President said there’s someone powerful behind you—”</p>
<p>“Is there anyone else here?”</p>
<p>President Jin and his cronies wouldn’t be gathered here just to mind a woman when they could go places gathering money for Jinseong Constructions. The big guy gave Yuri the answer she wanted.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then no one knows if I don’t tell.” Yuri forced a smile around her rigid mouth.</p>
<p>The big guy smiled grossly as he came to her with a reddened face. “You’ll see heaven while crying.”</p>
<p>In a flash, he was over Yuri, his hands grabbing her breasts. His rough breaths disgusted her. While she endured it, she sneaked a peek at the syringe he had put down. It was the same drug that would numb the muscles instantly on injection. If she did it right, she could overwhelm the big guy who was much stronger and bigger than her. It was a dangerous gambit, and if she failed, she would be a victim of rape and physical assault.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath the moment the big guy lowered his head and reached out for the syringe.</p>
<p>“F*ck! You bitch, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the big guy had sharper instincts than Yuri had thought. He grabbed her wrist and threw the syringe afar.</p>
<p>“And I had gone soft on you!”</p>
<p>He slapped hard her cheek, the shock overwhelmed her to the extent she could not even scream. He then climbed up her body.</p>
<p>“You seem to have been treated well by someone high up, but today’s the day I’ll turn you into a rag doll. Let’s see if he would still find you pretty afterwards.”</p>
<p>The big guy’s hand suddenly reached between her legs, she writhed screaming.</p>
<p>“Don’t! Don’t touch me!”</p>
<p>The big guy slapped her again at her resistance, her nose bled as her head turned sideways. He seemed excited at the sight of blood. He took off his shirt and loosened his belt as he sneered at the limp girl lying prostrate in shock.</p>
<p><em>I might die like this.</em></p>
<p>It was then that she caught sight of something that lay within the clothes the big guy had taken off.  Using the last of her strength, she grabbed and swung it at the man.</p>
<p>“Fu … f*ck— ”</p>
<p>Blood sprayed dying everything around crimson. At first, she thought it was her bleeding nose only to realize it was the burly man’s blood. She had swung the ice pick the big guy always had on him and cut diagonally across his face- from the forehead to the eye.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh! You bitch!”</p>
