            <p><strong>Chapter 85</strong></p>
<p>“Strange.” Hyeon-ah Kim murmured as she puffed out smoke.</p>
<p>Hye-seong frowned at her words. “What?”</p>
<p>“Yuri’s reaction.”</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah reflected upon the girl’s reaction from that afternoon. She had known the girl for some time now, and being in the hospitality business she knew to read people. Yuri and she had spent a lot of time working whenever the former would fill in for Hye-yeon, which would be quite often. So from the way the other had reacted, it wasn’t the same as when she had discovered that her friend was dead. She was surprised for sure and genuinely, she could say that. However, she did not seem shocked enough. On the contrary, her intelligent mind seemed to be probing something.</p>
<p>“It was as if she already knew her father’s death was not an accident.” Hyeon-ah muttered as she mulled.</p>
<p>“She lost her memory. Is that a lie?” The man conjectured.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not a lie.” Hyeon-ah countered. “She was really shocked when she heard about Hye-yeon Jin. She wouldn’t have stayed still for four years if she didn’t actually lose her memory.”</p>
<p>The girls were thick as thieves. they had grown up together and their friendship ran deeper than it seemed. They would always look out for each other, especially Yuri. She could never say no to her best friend and always covered for her when the other was indulging in her escapades. So, it was impossible for Yuri to have not been in the country knowing her friend was dead. She was too loyal for her own good.</p>
<p>“Then how did she find out?” Hey-seong demanded. If she didn’t lose her memories, there was no way she would know her father died as a result of foul play and not a freak accident.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but a daughter can have doubts about her father’s mysterious death for sure. She’s a smart girl so she must have done some research. Look at how she’s staying near Tae-jun Seo.”</p>
<p>Hye-seong grasped his cup when he heard Tae-jun’s name. His shoulder burned, he clenched his jaw discreetly.</p>
<p>But none of this escaped Hyeon-ah’s discerning eyes. “That injury … you didn’t get beaten up or stabbed by a knife. Did you get shot?” She prodded.</p>
<p>“None of your business!” He snapped at her.</p>
<p>“How did you get shot in Korea? Unfazed, she went on asking. “That’s an unlikely thing to happen. Did someone keep a gun at home?”</p>
<p>“There’s someone. He’s completely insane.”</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah was amused. She chuckled. “By the way, what was it likely to see Yuri for the first time in forever? You guys used to go out. She’s even prettier now. I guess life got easier with a guy like Tae-jun Seo beside her.”</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah’s words stung. Hye-seong was always uncomfortable around this woman. It was ever since he saw her, a girl only five years older than him, encounter his father late in the night. However, he ironically acknowledged the fact that she was the only person he could get help at the current situation.</p>
<p>She asked a question as she took out a new cigarette. “So what are you going to do now? Even if Yuri finds ‘it’, it won’t be easy to talk to her with Tae-jun watching her.”</p>
<p>“We need to come up with a method.” He had thought about this hard. He knew the guy was a hunter and he was certainly on the lookout for him. Now he even had Yuri in the den. It was not going to be easy.</p>
<p>“Can I ask you something?”</p>
<p>Hye-seong gestured her to go ahead with his eyes.</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah’s red lips lifted up. “Do you want to avenge for Hye-yeon, or do you want to find ‘it’?”</p>
<p>“Both.”</p>
<p>What Hye-seong Jin was never going to admit was the truest reason. Yes, he wanted to avenge his sister, and <em><strong>that </strong></em>thing held mammoth importance, but he wanted this most to satisfy his wounded ego.</p>
<p>The flower that once he had strongly desired, that was once almost at hand, was abruptly and ruthlessly snatched away from him. He had held it in for far too long, first because of his father and then again because of his father… The man had made sure to torment him even after his death. But now that the opportunity had befallen him, he would seek his retribution– if he couldn’t have the flower, then he would trample on it so no one else could ever have it.</p>
<p>The shoulder stabbed again, Hye-seong growled a curse under his breath at the man who had inflicted the pain. Engorged in his loathing, he squeezed on his shoulder without noticing it bleeding.</p>
<p>He wanted to ruin Yuri Han. That was the probably the greatest revenge he could have on Tae-jun Seo.</p>
