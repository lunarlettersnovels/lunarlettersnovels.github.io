            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 41</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, the VIP lounge seemed to have plunged into an eerie air. The predator was patiently toying his prey, but the innocent bystander knew not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun pretended it was his first-time meeting Yuri, and she decided to go along too. Flashing a faux smile, she handed him her business card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He took his time taking the card from her, his eyes never leaving her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yuri Han,” he said slow and cold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if her entire history[8]  was written down on it, Tae-jun looked intently at the card in his hand. However, except for her name and phone number, it had nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oblivious to the undercurrents, Si-yeon cut in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hotel Seoin too intends to revamp their exhibits, they are interested in Roy Jean’s pieces as well. He came along to check our new pieces by Roy.” She then turned to the man himself. “What do you think? Do you like them Tae-jun?” she asked eagerly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun nodded in response.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another lie!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He claimed to be interested in purchasing art pieces, but not once had he turned to look at the Heart of Apollo since stepping in. The only thing, or person, that Tae-jun had ever laid his eyes on was Yuri Han as if she were the sole reason for his visit. One wondered if he was even aware that there existed many pieces of Roy’s works in this very room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a finely sharpened knife, his hawkeyes penetrated deep into Yuri’s soul. Cold sweat ran down her spine. Everywhere Tae-jun directed his gaze, she felt the burning sensation of a cut… soon her whole body was covered in this sensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss Han, is Yuri Han your real name?” Tae-jun asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me?”Yuri was confused. She could not understand what he was getting to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staring at Yuri, Tae-jun continued. “I think I saw someone once who greatly resembles you. Well, not even that… Who looks identical to you, but I think I remember them having a different name.” He feigned forgetfulness, as Yuri’s eyes narrowed at him.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of answer does he want from me?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning her face away, Yuri’s hands fisted at her skirt. She alone knew the sheer grit she had to muster in order not to falter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s interesting, but it is my first time meeting you.” She stated determinedly. She didn’t waver even as she saw Tae-jun nod in mock understanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, if you say so.” As if he’d heard something funny, Tae-jun raised his brows. His gaze never left her, his dark orbs inscrutable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the brave facade, Yuri was on tenterhooks. She could feel Tae-jun was toying with her. The man, his words and penetrating eyes, were wreaking havoc on her nerves. Just when she felt she could not hold in any longer…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> … with a final glance, Tae-jun turned to face Si-yeon. Right when she thought she was given a lease of respite, the voice set her up for another challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you have some spare time today, we should have lunch together. With Yuri as well.” He casually suggested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That sounds like a plan.” Si-yeon agreed excitedly. “Yuri, are you free?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I appreciate it, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was decisively cut mid-sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to discuss purchase plans over the table.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Roy Jean’s assistant, discussing sales with a possible client on a lunch table was a suggestion Yuri could not easily reject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reluctantly, Yuri answered. “Ok… Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the ghost of a smile appeared on Tae-jun’s face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seems like lunch works for Yuri as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Si-yeon’s secretary, taking the cue, pulled out her cell phone and asked, “I will make a reservation immediately. Director Seo, what would you like?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t care. You can decide.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary Kim reserved a table at the most popular French restaurant in the mall. The chef had a reputation he gained from his exceptional stint at a two-star Michelin restaurant in France and a hotel as well. Usually reservations needed to be at least a day in advance, but such trivialities did not apply if it was Si-yeon who was calling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way to the restaurant, Yuri’s mind delved into her possible relationship with Tae-jun in the past.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was their relationship? How did they know each other?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associating her dreams to what was in front of her, she presumed it to be something very private and close to the heart. Close enough to warrant sexual and physical intimacy with one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that assumption was only until the moment she realized he was an executive director of Seoin Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His identity and social position threw Si-yeon[9]  into the crossfire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she could not recall what happened in her past, in general, it was difficult to draw a connection between an art student with an unimpressive and underprivileged background and a person of the upper echelons of society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when they sat down on the table and opened a menu, Yuri’s mind was preoccupied with a snaggle of confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting next to Tae-jun, who sat across Yuri, Si-yeon stared into Yuri’s face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you okay, Yuri? You don’t look well.” She remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?” Yuri raised her head and blanched, as she caught Tae-jun’s eyes. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was he staring at her the whole time?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am all right, just a bit dizzy, but that’s not new. It happens sometimes. Thank you for asking.” She laughed sheepishly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri turned her mouth up slightly to be polite. Even then, like a ferocious beast preparing to hunt its prey, Tae-jun still did not take his eyes off of her. Enduring his piercing gaze, Yuri reached to the water glass to ease her dry mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if waiting for an opportune moment, Tae-jun finally spoke once more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yuri, how long have you been working as an assistant to Mr. Jean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been three years already.” She replied softly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Three years.” Tae-jun tapped his long fingers on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big, strong hand – the hand that opened and caused Yuri’s body to shake in her memories… She knew that hand too well. It was the very hand that she’s seen in her dreams, leaving burning sensations on her skin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
