            <p><strong>Chapter 151</strong></p>
<p>Although she was covered for medical expenses which were bound to be dear, the real issue was the exhibition due in two weeks. The specifics of the event were already firmed up at this point in time and the preparations were mostly made. However, she was still left with the last finish on a piece of work that was to be the ‘main’ of the exhibition, and there was no way she could finish it in time with her arm in a cast. More so, as the last finish required her to bring out the delicate touches.</p>
<p>With her plastered arm, she went to the agency to hold an emergency meeting with her manager as countermeasures were needed as soon as possible. It was an exhibition which she had been working on for months. She couldn’t let her months of effort all go to waste. So after much consideration, she decided to display ‘Apollo’ in the exhibition.</p>
<p>After the long meeting, she came back to her studio and headed to the display room where she stored all of her undisclosed works. It had been quite some time since she last visited the place as there was no special occasion for her to do so. However, there were also times when she had avoided the place on purpose. But now, as her mind was set on exhibiting the work, it was necessary for her to examine its condition.</p>
<p>Yuri came to a stop at the innermost part of the room as that was where her ‘Apollo’ was displayed. Without moving an inch, she solemnly stared into the face of the relief she had created.</p>
<p>And there he was, right where she stood. It was as though she was revisited by her desperateness from when she was making the piece. Before long, her face was all streaked with tears without her realizing it. And for the first time, she boiled down all that she was feeling inside her to one word, with her eyes closed.</p>
<p><em>Longing…</em></p>
<p>She simply missed him. There was no denying that she was longing dearly for a man who went by the name Tae-Jun Seo.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just go and see him?”</p>
<p>It was Roy’s voice that drifted to her ears. He was standing behind her but there was no way of knowing just how long he had been there. Upon learning of his presence, Yuri quickly wiped off her tears with the back of her hands.</p>
<p>“I think he’s waiting for you to come to see him.”</p>
<p>“No way. I’m sure he’s gotten over me by now.”</p>
<p>Speculative articles regarding his new relationship after his engagement was called off were circulating around the Korean press off late. And she thought that was for the best as she neither wanted to stir or be stirred by him anymore. This feeling of hers, relating to Hye-yeon and her father’s death, was something she had to bear entirely by herself. She buried her face in her hands and said, “I just… wish for the time to pass by more quickly. I’m sure I’ll be able to forget all about it then.”</p>
<p>But Roy shook his head, despairingly.</p>
<p>“There are people who can’t move on from the past no matter how much they try or how much time passes by.” His voice sounded somewhat wistful as he spoke. “The one person who I desperately want to see does not exist anymore. That’s why I can’t help but live in my old memories while reminiscing about the past. There’s nothing left for me without that. It’s been long since my clock stopped ticking for good at one point in the past. But Yuri, you’re different. There’s still something you can do about it. I hope for you to live in the future, unlike me.”</p>
<p>Yuri couldn’t say a word to him as the future she pictured involved no other than a woman, who stood lingering before her bathroom sink, forgetting about the fact she’d already washed her hand a moment ago. She doubted if he would ever take part in such a future of hers.</p>
<p>With such thoughts in her mind, she stood stock-still before ‘Apollo’ for another long while.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>Coming back from her studio, Yuri came to a stop as there was quite a commotion around the apartment with building materials heaped up on the side of the road while the workers bustled around busily.</p>
<p><em>Is there some kind of construction going on around the apartment?</em></p>
<p>Just when she was wondering, the building supervisor, who was having a talk with someone who seemed to be in charge of the construction, took notice of Yuri.</p>
<p>“Miss Han! You have no idea how shocked I was when I heard about your accident…You should’ve told me if there was a blackout. The electrical wiring here could be dangerous as they’ve gotten too worn-out.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I never knew they would be that dangerous.”</p>
<p>The building supervisor seemed to have been caught off guard by her nonchalant response when he’d deliberately fussed about the accident, in a worry that she might put him to blame. In a more composed manner, he kept on his conversation with her.</p>
<p>“Hmm-hmm, so how’s your body?”</p>
<p>“Just a hairline fracture on my right wrist bone.” She pointed at her plastered arm.</p>
<p>“Oh my!”</p>
<p>“But thankfully, the owner of the apartment offered to pay for my medical expenses. Despite there being an accident, I would still like to express my thanks to the owner. Do you know a way to reach him?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, about that. I just heard this morning that the owner of the apartment has changed.”</p>
<p>“What?!” was her bewildered reply.</p>
