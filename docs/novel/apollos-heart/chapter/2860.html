            <p><strong>Chapter 145 – Ledger (2)</strong></p>
<p>All along the way to Jinseong, Yuri stared vacantly out of the window. To ensure her safety, Jin-wook and the guards had tagged along. Tae-jun silently drove and watched her.</p>
<p>After passing the tollgate, she keyed in the address into the GPS. It was an ordinary address. <em>Was it a house?</em> It wasn’t a storage facility or a bank of sorts. There was nowhere to hide things…</p>
<p>“Are you sure it’s here?” he asked as he read out the address.</p>
<p>“I’m positive.”</p>
<p>“Looks like an ordinary house to me. Are you familiar with this place?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s possibly the safest place in the world.”</p>
<p>According to Yuri, what President Jin had in possession was a handwritten list/ledger. Its receipts were  handwritten so that the ones who accepted the bribe had no way out. This must weigh quite a lot. So how could they possibly hide it without attracting any suspicion?</p>
<p>Although skeptical, he obediently headed in the direction the GPS guided him. After passing a few complicated streets, the car stopped in front of an old house with a tin roof.</p>
<p><em>What on earth is this place?</em></p>
<p>Yuri got out of the car and casually pushed the gate open. Tae-jun followed closely. Inside, they met an unexpected man.</p>
<p>“Sir.”</p>
<p>The hearing-impaired man kept to his work. Tae-jun immediately recognized him. It was Mr. Shin, the man who picked up his father’s hat for him. At that time, he had walked around the riverside in the opposite direction, so he did not realize that this place was where all the recyclable trash was collected.</p>
<p>Sensing a presence, Mr. Shin turned back. He was shocked to find Yuri and Tae-jun behind him. She approached him and communicated in sign language. Looking at all the papers and trash rolling here and there, Tae-jun finally understood why she had called this place the ‘safest place on earth.’ They say to hide the tree in the forest, afterall.</p>
<p>After a long conversation with Mr. Shin, Yuri finally brought a small box.</p>
<p>Tae-jun asked in wonder, “How did you get this?”</p>
<p>“I headed straight to the hotel the moment I arrived in Jinseong. I knew in advance what time they would throw out the trash from the office. The office keeps its trash confidential and out of touch, else the people get into trouble. So, before I headed to the police station, I met the man and communicated in sign language. I told him to keep hold of  the trash from Hotel Jinseong if he sees a box that is tied in a knot.”</p>
<p>“And how can we trust that person?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Shin lost his family and an ear when he struggled to pay President Jin back, just like my father. He has a stronger will to avenge President Jin than anyone else. He happily agreed when I informed him that I had something in possession to mess with his enemy.”</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah Kim and Mr. Shin… They must all have sought revenge on President Jin because of similar reasons. Now, was it In-bae Lee’s turn?</p>
<p>Tae-jun opened the ledger. He saw countless names of politicians who accepted bribes, the details of their transactions, names of prostitutes and drugs throughout decades. In-bae Lee and President Jin had extensive connections with reporters, prosecutors, police, politicians, and many more. The moment this detailed ledger would be exposed, the current presidential candidate would lose everything. He would have no way out, since the evidence consisted of photos, voice recordings, handwriting, and even videos as receipts.</p>
<p>But this was not just In-bae Lee’s matter alone. The numerous individuals on this ledger would attempt to do anything to conceal their misdeeds. Anyone could potentially become the next Sang-gu Park. Thus, the one to reveal the lead to the world should never be Yuri Han.</p>
<p>Tae-jun briefly organized his thoughts, then said, “This ledger… Can you leave this ledger to me? Frankly, this is not something one person can possibly deal with. Most of all, I cannot tolerate you being at risk once again.”</p>
<p>“—Is it possible for you?”</p>
<p>“It’s possible for me.”</p>
<p>Although there were things he would need to deal with, Tae-jun didn’t say the ‘although’ part.</p>
<p>Yuri, who silently gazed into his eyes, nodded her head. “But promise me one thing. Promise me that you will avenge the murders of my father and Hye-yeon.”</p>
<p>“I promise.”</p>
<p>He called Jin-wook who was waiting outside. The latter’s expression stiffened when he saw the ledger. It was enough to make even the Seoin Group go under pressure. Nevertheless, Tae-jun was willing to do anything Yuri wanted. Even if it were the edge of a cliff, he would run. He was ready to risk it all for her. Even if he had to jump off a cliff.</p>
<p>After Jin-wook left with the ledger, Tae-jun walked to Mr. Shin. He asked him to name what he wanted, but the latter simply shook his head and refused.</p>
<p>‘The reward I wanted was Jin’s death, and I have already received it.’</p>
<p>The two said their farewell and exited the place. Yuri headed to the sidewalk near River Jinseong, Tae-jun silently followed. As he listened to the rustling of grass, he reminisced the day he first met her. The time that he could never go back to.</p>
<p>Right then, Yuri abruptly stopped walking. “I have something to tell you.”</p>
<p>It was time to begin talking about their last remaining story.</p>
