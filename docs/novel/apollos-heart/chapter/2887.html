            <p><strong>Chapter 118 – All For You, Miss Han (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it the landlord that was supposed to come in two days?</em></p>
<p>“Who’s there?” She called out.</p>
<p>“It’s me.”</p>
<p><em>Tae-jun?</em></p>
<p>The silhouette in the darkness was definitely Tae-jun’s. <em>Wasn’t he locked in the house?</em></p>
<p>Yuri was startled as she elevated her body. “How did you come here? Jae-won told me you couldn’t leave the house—”</p>
<p>“I was just playing along with Grandfather. I’m not a child … I can leave whenever I want.”</p>
<p>He gradually came near. It was the first time seeing his face properly in two weeks. Yuri was stunned at the visible scratch above his right eye.</p>
<p>“What happened to your face?”</p>
<p>“This?” Tae-jun replied ever so nonchalantly. “I got hit by a picture frame thrown at me. He spontaneously throws things when he’s mad. ”</p>
<p>Their eyes locked. What did they have to say? What were they supposed to say? Their gaze meant a lot of words.</p>
<p>Without a preamble, Tae-jun offered his hand. “I missed you.”</p>
<p>If things hadn’t gone wrong, these were words she would have heard from him upon his return from a business trip. They have digressed a long way.</p>
<p>“Also … I’m sorry.” He added, without averting his gaze.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. My words were very offensive too.” She hurriedly replied, she was thinking he meant <em><strong>that</strong></em> night.</p>
<p>“No, I mean … about everything from the beginning.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know what to say. She simply blinked, he went on.</p>
<p>“I was attracted to you since I first saw you. You lingered in my mind. When I saw you with another guy at school, I had a strong urge to possess you. So I sent you a monster, without knowing that it would ruin your father, you, and … everything.”</p>
<p>“How did you know—” Yuri’s lips quivered, her eyes welled up with tears threatening to stream down any moment.</p>
<p>Tae-jun cringed in pain.  “I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. I regret that I said I want to have you beside me after I marry Si-yeon. You’re the one I want to marry and spend the rest of my life with.”</p>
<p>Yuri let out a painful scream as she burst into tears. The emotions she had withheld after recovering her memory had finally exploded. She couldn’t control her tears anymore. She hated him because she couldn’t hate him when she wanted to. She shouldn’t have looked back at him but she did. She should have rejected him but she didn’t.</p>
<p>Tae-jun pulled her into his arms. She tried to escape, but he closed his eyes and had her glued to him. She bawled in his embrace. She let out every single sorrow she had kept within. He contuinously caressed her back and stroked her hair.</p>
<p>When his shirt was soaked with tears and snots, a husky voice sounded.</p>
<p>“—I’m going back to America with Roy. I won’t be coming back ever again. So … you can marry Miss Yoon like you had originally planned.”</p>
<p>“End of discussion for that. I’m not marrying Si-yeon.” His tone showed that he had burnt that bridge for good.</p>
<p>“You should. I just want to leave here.” She insisted. All his troubles were now because of her, so when she left he should be able to settle the storm.</p>
<p>“I’ll do everything for you but this.”  His voice was stern and decisive. “I will never give you up.”</p>
<p>“What’s so special about me … Why are you going through all this just for me?” She was neither rich nor extraordinarily beautiful. In comparison to Si-yeon, who was a fairy, she was a commoner. What was so charming about her that this man was stuck to her?</p>
<p>He held her hand and placed it on his chest. She could feel his heart pounding. His deep eyes gazed into her face. He carefully kissed her eyelid.</p>
<p>“Because I love you.”</p>
<p><em>Love?</em></p>
<p>What was love anyway? Was it heading the wrong direction even though she was totally aware of her mistake?</p>
<p>He drew closer, their lips met. Their tongues longed for each other’s. His tongue glided through her teeth and dove into her mouth. The emotions that surged her now, she who had wondered about his feelings for her, had forgotten to realize her own towards him. She was awash with sensations, her heart ached at the realization.</p>
<p>The kiss lasted a long time. They were holding on to one other, trying to reassure one other … afraid of losing the other.</p>
<p>Once he had withdrawn his lips,  Tae-jun’s eyes ignited with desire. “—May I hug you?”</p>
<p>It was the first time he had asked for permission. She could feel a hint of caution and nervousness underlying his words. He must still feel remorseful …</p>
<p><em>What should I do with you</em>? It was the last time she would be seeing him anyway. She wanted to let him do whatever he wanted. Or maybe, she herself wanted it too. She stared into him and nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
