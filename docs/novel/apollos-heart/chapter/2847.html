            <p><strong>Chapter 158 – Tae-jun Side Story (4)</strong></p>
<p>“Well, everyone thinks it was an arranged marriage. Only your aunt, Jung-hee knows since she has been my friend since childhood. She knows how I had a huge crush on my husband, and how much I loved him after we got married. Everyone asked why didn’t I just ‘simply’ live my life, but I couldn’t do that. Even your maternal grandfather complained about why I didn’t just live ‘simply’ whenever he had difficulty with school management.”</p>
<p>There was silence. Tae-jun was once like that too. His mother’s hand touched his cheek.</p>
<p>“Your father was a ‘good person’ and a ‘good man’. But he was neither a ‘good husband’ nor a ‘good father’. I don’t want my son to live that kind of life. I must be being selfish because I’m your mother, but I want my son to become a good husband and also a good father. Up to what your father couldn’t.”</p>
<p>When he looked up, he saw his mother’s eyes become teary. Everyone lives with their own pain.</p>
<p>Tae-jun returned to the office with a heavy mind and worked until late. There was quite a lot of work to be done as the time he spent taking care of the president was added to the time he left for vacation. What was especially urgent was to resume the development of the new Alzheimer’s drugs that failed clinical trials. Developing a new drug before Yuri develops it. That was also the goal that motivated him as he was now because that perhaps was the only thing he could do for her.</p>
<p>Around midnight, his personal cell phone rang. He looked at the caller id and it was a call from an advisory lawyer of LJ Partners. His forehead slightly wrinkled. He answered the call in a disgruntled voice.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“Sorry to call you so suddenly. It is an urgent matter.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The advisory lawyer who sensed Tae-jun’s disgruntled voice spoke as if he was trying to justify.</p>
<p>LJ Partners was an investment company specializing in M&amp;A created by Tae-jun himself, but externally, Jay was the ‘face’ and ‘boss’ of the company. Tae-jun distanced himself from LJ Partners and Seoin Group because they did not consider whether their way was legal or illegal for profit. Most of the work was done either through Jay or on his own. That was why, even within LJ Partners, nobody was aware of Tae-jun’s presence other than Jay and his advisor. But, a lawyer who knows the importance of the situation more than anyone else called him directly without even going through Jay? It meant that Jay had a serious problem with his life. And again, Tae-jun’s guess was not wrong.</p>
<p>“How about Jay?”</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“Suddenly he said he was going to go hunting for a bear and disappeared. Today’s the second day.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Dammit! </em>Tae-jun tapped the documents with his pen. He remembered a call with Jay a few days ago.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Ah, well said. I don’t know, I will no longer be intervening with her business. You do whatever you want.”</strong></em></p>
<p>It seems like he didn’t say that as a joke. Well, although he fooled around a little, he wasn’t the type of person who spoke nonsense.</p>
<p>“Have you contacted the villa in Canada?”</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“They are uncontactable as well. Should we visit them?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If Jay, a former Special Forces member, had decided to go into hiding, even Tae-jun wouldn’t be able to find him. There’s no other choice but to wait for him to come back.</p>
<p>Tae-jun sighed in response. “That won’t work. No one can find a person who is determined to hide. He’ll probably be back after a few days of having fresh air. What’s the matter that’s more urgent than Jay that made you contact me directly?”</p>
<p>The advisory lawyer’s voice over the phone lowered as if he was emphasizing the seriousness of this matter.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“‘Bio Origin’, which the boss was in charge of, has been secretly contacting us.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bio Origin was an American pharmaceutical company that LJ Partners had been seeking for M&amp;A for several years. It was a small company that had barely graduated from the startup stage, but it was a company that obtained a patent for a new drug for preventing Alzheimer’s two years ago. It was a patent necessary for Seoin Pharma’s new drug development.</p>
<p>Tae-jun raised his voice without noticing himself. “What did they say?”</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“They didn’t get into details. They said they want to speak to the decision-maker directly. It seems that they are trying to directly suggest the terms of the negotiation. It was supposed to be the boss’s job, but considering the situation… We can’t make them wait any longer.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It was something that they’d been working on for a long time. It was also a deal that should be closed as Bio Origin suggested the negotiation first. Tae-jun ended the call after telling the lawyer to make an appointment. He was planning to go to the United States himself and meet the person in charge of Bio Origin.</p>
