            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 27</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at an ashen Yuri, Hyeon-ah Kim’s eyes widened to their limits. This was totally unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What, you didn’t know she was dead?” she asked in apparent disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two were thick as thieves, how could she not know? But looking at her now, it seemed she really didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I couldn’t even imagine… I-I just thought I couldn’t get in touch with her. And I didn’t have the energy to worry about it in the US. Hye-yeon… is really gone?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri’s voice was quivering. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could this be?!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She felt a big stone weighing down her heart. She could not possibly believe that her friend was dead… gone forever.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Can you please fill in for me, just for three days? I’m going to Japan with my boyfriend.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I’ll give you twice, no, three times my hourly pay.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri could still vividly picture the naughty Hye-yeon, asking her to show up to work at the hotel in her place. How she would plead, coax, boss… but never take no for an answer.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard it was suicide. Someone found her body floating down the Jinseong River,” Hyeon-ah said as if sensing her thoughts.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, no way! That was ridiculous! Hye-yeon would never kill herself!!!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…That’s not possible.” Yuri spoke with conviction. She knew her friend best!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few breaths of silence passed. Hyeon-ah peered at Yuri in all seriousness. “Do you know anything? I mean, you were the last person to see her alive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A flash of lightning struck impregnable walls in her subconscious, a crevice of hope emerged. And without a warning, a scene began playing in her mind. It was so vivid as if it were happening in that instance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splash! Cold water sprayed across. Gradually as the water settled, a figure came into view… the serene face, vacant eyes… she was going deeper and deeper into the river. [4]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri’s pupils dilated, she clenched her fist trying hard to endure the torment and glimpse the drowning face.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That… that woman… Hye-yeon!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5] </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop remembering!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something sharp slashed the deep corners of her brain. Violent pain began gnawing at her. Yuri gripped her head with both hands and started shaking it.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was that image?! Was it a lost memory… or, a delusion brought on by shock? If it was a lost memory, then why was I watching Hye-yeon sink into the water? Was I there?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyeon-ah stared into Yuri’s face with concern. Her already pale face was now turning blue. Before she could wrap her mind around it, she saw her struggling to say something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri barely squeezed a sentence out of her throat. “…I’m so-rry. I thi-nk I sho-uld go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was becoming difficult even to stay seated. Everything in front of her was just too ruthless for her to handle. All she wanted was to run away from there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she stood up, her legs shook precariously. She staggered to get a footing with the help of the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you really all right? You look as white as a sheet!” There was panic in Hyeon-ah’s voice, helplessness wreathed her confident visage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, her friend’s anxious voice felt strangely distant. Yuri shook off Hyeon-ah’s hand that was trying to hold her steady. She turned around and stumbled out of the café.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was floating in a dreamlike state as if her brain was on a meltdown. Her mind refused to think. She moved mechanically for a long time before gradually coming to her senses. When she tried to muster a semblance of her whereabouts, she discovered she was in the lobby of Hotel Seoin. It was unclear how she’d managed to take the bus back to Seoul or made it to this place.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why am I here?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri slowly looked around her, blinking, striving to make sense. Sounds from her surroundings, which had thus far been blocked as if the speaker had been turned off, suddenly rushed in at once and bombarded her eardrums. Her sensations, that had previously disappeared, now returned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was not the first time that she had moved around in an unconscious state. It was an often occurrence since losing her memory. She would wander the boundaries between reality and fantasy, as if she were seeking something, sometimes even running away. Each time, she had done something that she could no longer remember, or found herself in an unexpected place.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why this hotel, when she’d canceled the reservation only a few days ago? What is she supposed to find here?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this because the new Hotel Seoin in Jinseong had left a strong impression? And who is the man that was going around looking for her? Jin-wook Jeong from J Consulting–who is he? Is he related to the people who’d threatened her uncle?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She suddenly noticed the CCTV camera hanging at a corner on the ceiling and recalled Hyeon-ah’s words.</span></p>
<p><b><i>It looked like it was from CCTV footage. You had your hair up in a ponytail, wearing a trench coat.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That must have been her first day back in Korea. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could the footage have been from here? S</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he peered up at the camera. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How had the man obtained a copy of the footage?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew, from her days working at Hotel Jinseong, that it was not easy to get one’s hands on the lobby surveillance footage. An upscale place like Hotel Seoin would require a warrant from the police.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That man must be an insider here</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A shiver ran down her back.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Perhaps she was being filmed right now?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri took a step towards the exit. At that instant, the floor sloshed and things began spinning in front of her. Her knees gave away and she dropped to the floor. She felt the impact against the surface and began hearing the murmurs of the crowd around her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you okay, miss?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urgent footsteps stopped next to her and a man’s voice echoed. The world in front of her swayed up and down nauseating her. She wanted to say that it was nothing, that she was all right, but she was finding it difficult to even breathe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yuri? Yuri Han? Are you all right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She managed to regain composure at the sound of a familiar voice. A tall man with light brown hair, slightly drooping eyes, and firm hands… Jae-won helped her up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jae-won?” she asked, doubtfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right, Yuri. We meet again.” He smiled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
