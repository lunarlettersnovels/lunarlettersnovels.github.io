            <p><strong>Chapter 98</strong></p>
<p>“Good morning.”</p>
<p>The next day Tae-jun had just finished a lonesome breakfast when Jin-wook appeared in the dining hall. The man ordered a small coffee, which was a clear indication that he was done with his meal.</p>
<p>“You must have slept here.” Tae-jun rose from his seat.</p>
<p>“Yes. I woke up early to play chess with the CEO.” Jin-wook answered.</p>
<p>After he had brought the Tae-jun over last night, he had stayed back. Among other reasons, he wanted to be sure his friend cum boss was fine.</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear. He refuses to play with me.”</p>
<p>“He complains how he beats you too easily and how it gets too boring.” Jin-wook replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Tae-jun shrugged. “There’s no reason to win.”</p>
<p>That meant, if there was a reason to win, he would have easily won. He was a man driven with purpose even in trifling matters, so where he didn’t see one he wouldn’t waste his time.</p>
<p>Tae-jun requested his coffee to be delivered to the library as he walked out of the door. Other than a brief meeting with a foreign buyer in the afternoon, he was free for the rest of the day. It was time to deal with the very thing he had been procrastinating on for a while- Yuri Han. It was his guilt all along that was hindering him from tending to the problems around her, but he knew he couldn’t delay it any longer.</p>
<p>When Jin-wook stepped out to take a call from family, Tae-jun called Jin-ho.</p>
<p>“Look up all the available hospitals. This needs to be kept a secret to the public.” He was never the one for civilities, always getting straight to the point in a terse tone.</p>
<p>Seoin Hospital, under the Seoin Group, was renowned for its adept surgeries and state-of-the-art facilities. The only downside was that it did not have a separate rehab clinic as such. So, anyone with access to the hospital would be privy to every patient’s history. Tae-jun liked to keep his private matters private, even from his family. This included Yuri and especially her condition.</p>
<p>Jin-ho cautiously asked Tae-jun.</p>
<p>– “Is it true that she did drugs?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>– “Since when?”</p>
<p>“Probably back in America. It’s a place full of temptations, and her job’s particularly exposed to it too.”</p>
<p>Every night in towns such as Soho or Greenwich Village in New York, folks who called themselves “artists” emerged to seek drugs. She must also have started out of curiosity. Tae-jun did not want to think too much about it.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“I heard there’s a helpful clinic in the countryside. The son of S is also a regular there ….”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“No. I want it to be as close as possible.”</p>
<p>She needed treatment without the public’s attention, but he wanted her to stay by his side. She <em><strong>had to be</strong></em> by his side.</p>
<p>“How long does the treatment take?”</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“It’s very difficult to make a conclusion. The controlled substance was strong, but the antidepressive ingredient was also abusive. It was a miracle that the airport let these go. This could last long term.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tae-jun lit his cigarette. So far, his effort to cut on cigarettes had turned to naught. He wished for a child. But the woman in his arms was like an illusion that would disappear any moment. He especially wished to see Yuri bear his children and give birth to babies that resembled her.</p>
<p>“Nothing seems to go right.” Tae-jun swallowed his murmur with the cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>That’s when Jin-wook returned from his phone call. He gave a detailed report as he repeated what he had heard from the ex-hotel manager the other night.</p>
<p>“So what does that man want in exchange?” Tae-jun snickered. If that man harboured thoughts of blackmailing him, then even the heavens wouldn’t be able to save him.</p>
<p>“He wants a new position that works indoors instead of the parking lot.” Jin-wook was only the messenger, whether or not the man would have his wish granted depended on this almighty devil before him.</p>
<p>“Let him do as he wants.” Came the reply.</p>
<p>Jin-wook immediately got the gist of the words and said, “I’ll head to Jinseong this afternoon to get the video footage.”</p>
<p>“Is there anyone else who knows about the incident?”</p>
<p>Since the location was the hotel lobby, chances were more than one person knew of this. This was why Jin-wook had asked the same question to the man, besides, it also served as a good source to double-check should that man be sending them on a wild goose chase.</p>
<p>“Hyeon-ah Kim was in the lobby that day. She would know exactly what happened.”</p>
<p><em>Hyeon-ah Kim.</em> A charismatic face instantly appeared in his mind, the kind that made it obvious that she was not an easy person to handle.</p>
<p>“Did you find out about him?”</p>
<p>The ‘him’ here was the driver involved in the accident who had been released from prison two years ago. Since the cameras had all been cut off, he was the next best bet to get answers.</p>
<p>“Yes. Only a short while after his release, he opened a restaurant that’s pretty big in his hometown. It’s quite confusing. How did a man who was bankrupt prior to the accident obtain the money to open a restaurant?”</p>
<p>“Worth finding out.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun crossed his arms and mulled the info to complete the puzzle. <em>President Jin and In-bae Lee … What sort of thing would involve both of these individuals?</em> Despite the significant hints, the truth had yet to reveal itself.</p>
<p>A call from Manager Choi broke the silence. <em>Must be about Yuri if she’s calling this early in the morning.</em></p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Sir, the main door is not functioning properly. She must have locked it from the inside, but she isn’t responding to the doorbell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
