            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 65</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps there was a lot more to this than what seemed to have transpired.  While it was widely believed President Jin was In-bae Lee’s subordinate, the latter was not really his superior. The two were privy to each other’s dirty secrets and had arrived at a precarious pact. Thus, each was using the other as one’s tool, but the upside was they were both profiting from it. At least until they had friction.</p>
<p>Myung-je Jin was a wily old fox who had more underhanded means than he let on. Yuri was certain that his man must have had something up his sleeve that led to the two biggest bullies falling out. And if she wished to obtain the details of the transaction to the last letter, she knew just the person.</p>
<p>“Are you still in contact with Hye-seong?” Yuri asked.</p>
<p>“Mr. Hye-seong Jin? What about him?” Hyeon-ah quirked her eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I want to know more about Hye-yeon. I might have heard her last words if I was the last one to meet her before she died.”</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah was silent for a moment and slowly shook her head. “I’m sorry, but I don’t know about Mr. Hye-seong Jin. He disappeared after President Jin’s death.”</p>
<p><em>Is she telling the truth?</em></p>
<p>Yuri could not think of a reason as to why Hyeon-ah would keep things from her if she knew something about the man in question. And given the circumstances surrounding that incident, it was only an eventuality for the president’s son, and sole survivor of the Jin family to go into hiding.</p>
<p>She sipped her coffee while shaking her head slightly. She had met her first obstacle too soon. <em>Where would she find Hye-seong Jin if he were off the grid? Is there another way to gather information about President Jin?</em></p>
<p>A pensive Yuri, at the moment, was oblivious to Hyeon-ah’s scrutinizing gaze on her.</p>
<p>After a moment or so, the other woman suddenly asked, “Hey, didn’t you say that you were going back to America?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be staying in Korea for now because I have to wrap up some things here.” She answered vaguely.</p>
<p>“Where are you staying?”</p>
<p>Yuri hesitated for a moment before answering. “I’m staying with a person I know in Seoul.”</p>
<p>“Then give me a card or your phone number, and I’ll ask the people I knew in the hotel to see if anyone knows about Mr. Hye-seong Jin.” She offered.</p>
<p>Yuri instantly brought out her card from the bag, Hyeon-ah leaned forward to receive it, her voice barely a whisper. “Does he have anything to do with the things you have to finish?”</p>
<p>Yuri glanced at the window and thought her breath stopped. There was a classy car, a foreign make, in front of the café, and a debonair Tae-jun was smoking a cigarette leaning against it.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, amidst an eerie silence, the man shoved her into the passenger seat and roughly cranked up the engine. She could see Hyeon-ah look out the store window with worried eyes.</p>
<p>As they sped past, Yuri looked straight ahead and wondered how Tae-jun had found her so quickly.</p>
<p>“What happened?” she asked, breaking the jittery silence</p>
<p>“I told you. I dislike variants.” He roared.</p>
<p>Yuri’s eyelids fluttered, and Tae-jun reached out to fasten her seatbelt.</p>
<p>“I want to know why you had to lie, saying you would go shopping instead of going to the hospital.”</p>
<p>Even under his piercing gaze, Yuri was quite resolute about not going to the hospital. “I know my body. The problem I have is with my memories.”</p>
<p>She had been undergoing treatment, knew everything she had to, what more could a doctor tell her?</p>
<p>“So, you came here to find them? What’s the reason for this sudden decision?” Tae-jun demanded.</p>
<p>“It’s not a sudden one. I’ve tried before but nothing worked. However, since I remembered you somewhat easily, I thought it might be the same for others.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun drummed his fingers on the wheel. Yuri turned her gaze to the window under the uncomfortable silence. They were passing by the beautiful and deep Jinseong River, she felt a chill all over as she remembered Hye-yeon’s death.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Are you sure that President Jin’s daughter is not there, too?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Judging by their conversation, Hye-yeon had not been the target. So why did she die, and what was the reason In-bae Lee wanted to kill me? </em></p>
<p>The question overwhelmed her. One question only ushered in several more, and Yuri felt more helpless than when she could not remember a thing. Closing her eyes, she endured the incoming headache. She did not know how much time passed until Tae-jun stopped at an exclusive Japanese restaurant.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, we’ll be having dinner here.”</p>
<p>So, it was already dinnertime. An employee guided them to a reserved room when Yuri got out of the car. It was a large one, and the scenery of the pond in the garden, and the simple pavilion was beautiful. The folding screen and the interiors of the room hinted at money.</p>
<p>The food placed on delicate and expensive dishes was exquisite. Yuri strived to eat digestible food as much as she could. She had to eat to have enough strength to go through what lay before her. Also, she did not want to offend Tae-jun by not eating.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he only placed certain dishes on her plate and did not speak.</p>
<p>Yuri was surprised as the food he served her were those she thought delicious.</p>
<p>The waiter brought fruits, sweet red bean jelly, and warm tea for dessert. Tae-jun made a phone call once the server had left the room.</p>
<p>“Bring it here.”</p>
<p>The paper panel door opened after a little while, and a man with short hair, sharp eyes, and a well-trained body walked in with an envelope in hand. When he got closer, Yuri recognized him as Jin-wook Jeong.</p>
<p>Jin-wook handed Tae-jun the envelope and slightly bowed to Yuri before going out. The man then handed the documents over to Yuri.</p>
<p>“Read it.”</p>
