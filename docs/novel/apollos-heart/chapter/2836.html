            <p><strong>Chapter 169 – After Story (6)</strong></p>
<p>As if swearing to God, Tae-jun gave strength to the arm that was holding Yuri. She turned her body and she pressed her forehead to his chest. He kissed her eyelids and caressed them carefully. She grabbed his neck and kissed his lips. Then, she gently sucked his lower lip. As her opened his lips to the hot breath, her tongue wrapped around his. A moan erupted from his mouth as her hand went inside his underwear.</p>
<p>“Yuri….”</p>
<p>“I’m scared. Hug me, so I will have no time to think.”</p>
<p>He pulled her dress up, took it off, and dropped it under the bed. He also took off the clothes he was wearing. Their bodies became hot and lips intertwined. He buried his face in her mounds. She hugged his head and touched his ear the whole time he licked her peaks. He spread her legs as he licked her entire body, then put his face between her legs. As her body quivered, her pointed buds also trembled. The core that was already moist, began to ooze nectar whenever her stimulated her cl*toris with his tongue. She also kissed his body all over the place.</p>
<p>He entered her when he thought their bodies were getting too hot. Her body reacted sensitively after a long caress. He licked her lips and moved his waist. Her thin legs wrapped around his waist. Slowly moving, he began to speed up little by little. They started moaning.</p>
<p>When they reached their peak, he hugged her tightly. Their beating hearts touched one another. He kissed her eyes. After they came a couple of times, she fell into a deep sleep in his embrace.</p>
<p>Tae-jun gazed at her slumbering and closed his eyes after a while.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>He had a dream. In the dream, he was standing in the reeds of the River Jinseong.</p>
<p><em>Why am I here?</em></p>
<p>He was puzzled as he walked along the river. Then a familiar scene appeared in front of his eyes. The place where he used to walk with Yuri, the place where his father, CEO Jeong-hun Seo, often went fishing. He stopped. There was a man with a fishing line under the beautiful tree.</p>
<p>“Father?”</p>
<p>He went closer to him. Jeong-hun, who was sitting with the fishing line, looked much younger than how he looked in his portrait. It was the image of his father that Tae-jun remembered before he left the house.</p>
<p>Wearing the only hunting hat in a shape of a check frock, he looked at Tae-jun and smiled. “How are you doing?</p>
<p>Tae-jun didn’t know what to say, and simply stared at his father’s face. He made a gesture, telling him(TJ) to come closer. He walked up to where the other was. Suddenly, the fishing line began to tremble. Looking at its move, it seemed like a big fish was caught.</p>
<p>“It’s a big fish.”</p>
<p>Jeong-hun pulled the fishing rod. The fish wasn’t coming up easily. Seeing the fishing line that was about to get cut, Tae-jun helped Jeong-hun and pulled the rod.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh my God, could this be some kind of whale?’</em></p>
<p>Tae-jun became speechless at the movement of the fish under the churning water. It was so strong that his whole body was shaking. He pulled the fishing rod as hard as he could. Eventually, as the fishing line came up, a huge carp with brilliant colors appeared.</p>
<p>“We caught a very beautiful one.”</p>
<p>When Jeong-hun was about to pull the fishing hook out of the carp’s mouth, a strange thing happened. The fluttering carp turned into a shiny stone. He picked up the stone and handed it to Tae-jun.</p>
<p>“I will give this to you.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun took the stone in confusion. It was heavy. Jeong-hun lightly tapped his son’s hand that was holding the stone.</p>
<p>“I gave this to your wife already, but she doesn’t seem to understand the meaning of this.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun recalled what Yuri told him before he went on his business trip.</p>
<p><em><strong>“In my dream, I received something special from a special person. I think your business trip will turn out well.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em>‘Was this the dream she talked about? If so, the cause of Yuri’s abnormal nap or fatigue may be…’</em></p>
<p>Jeong-hun smiled at the expression of his son who realized something important.</p>
<p>“For me, every moment I spent with you was a miracle and happiness. So I also want you to experience happiness and miracle with your son just like me, Tae-jun.”</p>
<p>When he lifted his head at the warm voice, Jeong-hun was no longer there. Unbidden and inexplicably, tears cascaded down his eyes..</p>
<p>Tae-jun opened his eyes slowly. He felt as if he could still sense the heavy rock in his hands. He softly shook the girl who was asleep.</p>
<p>“Yuri, honey. Wake up”</p>
<p>“…What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Yuri blinked her sleepy eyes but was surprised when she saw her husband’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Tae-jun, did you cry?” Her hand touched his red eyes.</p>
<p>Tae-jun spoke as he grabbed her hand, “I think our child came to us.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean…..”</p>
<p>“I met my father in my dream.”</p>
<p>Yuri’s eyes widened. She hurriedly turned over the calendar on her bedside. Her eyes welled up as she became convinced of something.</p>
<p>It was the moment of miracle.</p>
