            <p><strong>Chapter 164 – After Story (1)</strong></p>
<p>The gloomy sky didn’t look so good. As expected, heavy rain hit the car as soon as it left the tunnel. On the way home from a week-long overseas business trip, Tae-jun frowned as he looked at his watch.</p>
<p>“Is there a rain forecast?”</p>
<p>Jin-wook at the front seat spoke as he searched about the weather forecast on his phone. “It is said that until today, the weather would be affected by the rainy season. There will be localized heavy rainfall. But from tomorrow, the weather will be sunny, so it seems that the event will proceed without any setbacks.”</p>
<p>“Good to hear.”</p>
<p>Tomorrow would be the opening ceremony of the museum under the name of Chairman Jeong-ho Seo was scheduled. Chairman Seo passed away four years ago due to illness. It had been a comfortable passing as if falling asleep. It had been a month since Tae-jun’s wedding was held privately.</p>
<p>The museum was the will of Chairman Seo during his lifetime. Surprisingly, the beneficiary was Soo-kyung Lee, his daughter-in-law and the chairman of the board, whom he did not want to see for the rest of his life. Perhaps he was trying to sort out the feelings of love, hate, and remorse that had accumulated over the years.</p>
<p>The car, driving through the rain, soon entered the mansion surrounded by a high wall. Passing through a heavy iron gate and a guard station, it stopped in front of the front door.</p>
<p>“Welcome back.” Director Choi welcomed him with other employees.</p>
<p>“How did it turn out? You said that Madam had a good dream.”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, she told him that there would be a good result since she had a good dream. Tae-jun nodded as he got off the car.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t bad.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun spoke to Jin-wook while holding the umbrella that director Choi gave him. “You don’t need to get off. Go straight to your home and take some rest.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I will see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Jin-wook lowered his head at Tae-jun’s favor. He was also exhausted mentally and physically from a long business trip. The driver opened the trunk and took out the suitcase and luggage. Director Choi widened her eyes at the load that seemed to have doubled.</p>
<p>“What are these? Are all of these for Madam?”</p>
<p>“There were so many things that will look good on her.”</p>
<p>“You did this last time and were told not to buy anything more.” Director Choi helpfully reminded.</p>
<p>“I know. Put them somewhere nicely but in a way that won’t seem like there are many.</p>
<p>He already had two rooms full of gifts, so there was no point in a proper organization.</p>
<p>Director Choi sighed and asked, “We didn’t prepare any food since we heard that you had a meal on the airplane. Is it okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m okay. How about Yuri?”</p>
<p>There was only one thing Tae-jun wanted to ask the busily moving Director Choi. He wanted to know where his beloved wife was now. She even made a phone call saying that she would be returning home today, but it was strange that he couldn’t see her coming out to greet him as always.</p>
<p>“She’s sleeping.”</p>
<p>“Sleeping? Right now?”</p>
<p>The clock was pointing at 8:00 PM. It was too early to go to sleep.</p>
<p>Director Choi opened her mouth to say, “She said she was tired.”</p>
<p>“Did she have an outdoor schedule?”</p>
<p>“No, she didn’t go out. Do you want me to wake her up?”</p>
<p>“Let her sleep. But did she have dinner before going to sleep?”</p>
<p>“Yes, she had a light meal. Is there anything else you need?”</p>
<p>“I will call you if I need.”</p>
<p>Director Choi nodded.</p>
<p>He went up to the second floor and immediately opened the bedroom door. As he opened the door, he could smell a familiar scent. On the bed was the woman he had longed to see and missed so much.</p>
<p>Tae-jun slowly sat down on the side of the bed and looked down at her. As she slept, her face was as calm as the sound of her rhythmic breathing. ‘<em>Is it possible that she did her painting until late at night?’</em> Even after the marriage, Yuri was engaged in art activities in her spare time.</p>
<p>“This is unfair.”</p>
<p>He complained to himself. No matter how many times he thought about it, he thought it was unfair. He wanted to see this woman so much that it made him difficult to sleep.</p>
<p><em>‘I called and talked to you every day, but still missed you. But did you not?’</em></p>
<p>He caressed her cheek and hair. It’d been quite some time since they married, but he still had a strong desire for her. Even on his return flight, all he thought of was hugging and touching her the whole time. Even to think of it himself, he felt like a beast. A beast that got horny just by looking at Yuri Han. In his mind, he wanted to wake up the sleeping woman and have her until he was satisfied.</p>
<p>As he smiled bitterly at his unbearable thirst, the woman tossed and turned. Yuri, who wasn’t fully awake from her sleep grabbed his hand and placed it on her face.</p>
<p>“…Is it you?”</p>
<p>It was a sleepy voice.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I missed you.”</p>
<p>His heart pounded at the words she said unconsciously. He terribly liked the defenseless words and actions that she only showed him. Her words did not continue further. He gently kissed her lips, letting out an even breath. He got up from her bed after fixing her pillow so she could sleep comfortably. If he kept looking at her more, it seemed that it would be difficult for him to control unlike what he said to Director Choi.</p>
