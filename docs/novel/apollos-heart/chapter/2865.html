            <p><strong>Chapter 140 – You Will Pay Back (1)</strong></p>
<p>Late at night, a woman was relaxing at a glamorous spa. It was a high-end members-only salon that provided 24-hour service. It was popular among the wealthy, politicians, and celebrities. It was not a place one could enter with just money. Strong personal connections were necessary, and thus it was known for its high threshold.</p>
<p>The woman was content as she got out of the spa and wrapped a towel. A gowned attendant served her a beverage. It was perfect. This was the life she had wanted.</p>
<p>“Ms. Kim, follow me to the massage room please.”</p>
<p>A staff in a livery courteously led her. A client was already inside- a woman showing her pale back with her face down.</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah Kim frowned a little. She wanted to be alone, which was why she had made an appointment at such a time of the day.</p>
<p><em>Who is that woman?</em> <em>A pale- skinned client at such a late time…</em> <em>Could be an actress.</em></p>
<p>Drawing a conjecture, she laid down on the bed. It was at that moment…</p>
<p>“You seem to be doing well, ma’am.”</p>
<p>A familiar voice pierced her ear. She turned her head to the side of the bed in disbelief. Her pupils dilated.</p>
<p>“Yu-yuri Han!”</p>
<p><em>No way!</em> <em>It’s incredible!</em> <em>How on earth is Yuri here?</em> <em>She was definitely lying unconscious this morning! The doctor clearly said she is in a coma!</em></p>
<p>Yuri replied as if she read all of Hyeon-ah’s thoughts. “I was never in a coma. It was a lie all along. Oh, it would have been true if he were a minute late. There is a man who saved me from the fire.”</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah looked so shocked as if she was struck by lightning. “Why did you tell such a lie?”</p>
<p>“I was curious. How did In-bae Lee figure out that my father had the ledger? How did Sang-gu Park find me and Hye-yeon? How does Hye-seong Jin remember everything about me? Then I realized that all three of them have a connection to one person.” Yuri put on a gown and stood in front of Hyeon-ah . “You.”</p>
<p><em><strong>“Was it the day before the accident? Maybe two days before. President</strong></em> <em><strong>Jin and the driver had a pretty big argument. Right in the hotel lobby. President Jin ordered his stupid servants to take him away.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“I don’t know the details. All I did was eavesdrop on Hye-yeon while she was on the phone with you. Then a few days later Hye-yeon was found in the river.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“You honestly don’t remember anything after that?”</strong></em></p>
<p>Yuri spoke as she directly faced Hyeon-ah, who was clearly startled. “I thought about it when I heard that you yourself asked Tae-jun about my well-being. To whom in the world is this story heading? So I asked them to bring you to the hospital room. If you were to see me lying unconscious, how would you react? I wanted to know. I’m a bit surprised. I thought it was Sang-gu, not you, who directly contacted In-bae Lee.”</p>
<p>She handed something to Hyeon-ah . It was a photo. A photo of her with In-bae Lee, having an affair. Hyeon-ah shook her body in bewilderment.</p>
<p>“How did you—”</p>
<p>“You know Tae-jun Seo. That man will do whatever he wishes to. There’s more than this. How could you? My father, Hye-yeon… both were close friends of yours.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Did I do something so wrong? All I did was tell them about the ledger because they were looking for it. How would I have known they would die like that?”</p>
<p>“Stop lying. You knew In-bae Lee would be infuriated only by the fact that the ledger is exposed to the world. You worked for President Jin long enough to know this. You just did not care what would happen to these people! So cold-blooded!”</p>
<p>A whining moan flowed out of her throat. Then, there was a minute of silence. “That’s right. Why should I care?” Hyeon-ah retorted. She could not be more apathetic. Her face became emotionless. The woman who was shocked and bewildered no longer existed. She smirked. “So what if they die or get tortured? Who cares!”</p>
<p>A blank face with no emotion. This was the real Hyeon-ah Kim. Yuri finally realized why she felt so uncomfortable around Hyeon-ah. The woman had no facial expression. Her facial muscles were moving, but her emotions were never there. Hyeon-ah put on a gown as she took out a cigarette from her pocket. An employee hastily came forward at the sight of smoke, then left when she noticed Yuri.</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah slowly broke the silence.</p>
<p>“My parents abandoned me the same way as they were running away from debt. I still remember. When I came back from school, the house was a mess, and President Jin and his guys were waiting for me. I’m pretty sure you can expect what those guys did to me. I was only a child in school uniform. A child who was excited about the school camping trip.”</p>
