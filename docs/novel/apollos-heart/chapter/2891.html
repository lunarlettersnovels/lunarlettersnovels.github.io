            <p><strong>Chapter 114 – A Mess</strong></p>
<p>Jae-won wondered what his mother was up to. Whenever she insisted on a ‘date’, it would most likely mean that she had something important to tell him.</p>
<p>“Should we have dinner together? What about Father?” Jae-won asked.</p>
<p>His mother shrugged. “He has a meeting to attend. Choose whatever you like.”</p>
<p>Still startled by his mother’s unexpected presence, Jae-won just nodded in agreement and led them out of the airport.</p>
<p>Jae-won brought his mother to one of his favorite Korean restaurants in the city. He told the server to set a table for two and were escorted inside. Sitting down, Jae-won teased his mom. “You’re buying this meal, right?”</p>
<p>“I have to buy dinner for my grown-up son?” She sneered.</p>
<p>“Come on!” Jae-won said as he raised his palms for emphasis. “You’re the daughter of the owner, while I still live on my monthly salaries.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee regarded her son with a pitiful look.</p>
<p>After telling the server their orders, the food came shortly after. Jae-won’s mouth watered at the various Korean dishes that were placed in front of them. He picked his spoon up in anticipation.</p>
<p>When he studied abroad, the variety of food was almost countless, and he could go months without eating Korean food. Now, he couldn’t even last a few days without it, always craving for it wherever he was. He must be getting old.</p>
<p>Jae-won took huge bites of the tasty dishes, groaning in appreciation as the different flavors mingled on his tongue.</p>
<p>“Slow down, will you? You chew as if you haven’t eaten in days.” His mother remarked, pushing the glass of water towards her son.</p>
<p>Jae-won swallowed the food in his mouth before answering. “I ate well, but I was too preoccupied with the deal that I was basically shoving food down my throat without tasting it.”</p>
<p>“Did the deal go well?” his mother asked as she picked at her food.</p>
<p>Jae-won nodded as he reached for the water. “Yes, it went well. Seeing it with my own eyes was quite an experience.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee folded her arms on the table. “The art you just bought will surely double in price within a decade’s time. The amateur artist has so much potential.” She spoke as she wiped her mouth with a napkin. “Oh, by the way, did you see your brother?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t have the chance since he was in Europe. Isn’t Father expanding his business? He’s been complaining a lot lately.”</p>
<p>They kept each other updated with everything that’s going on with their familial matters. They talked endlessly, throwing each other questions every time something piqued their interest.</p>
<p>When they finished eating their meals and the tea was served, Mrs. Lee opened her mouth and asked unexpectedly, “Why aren’t you dating anyone?”</p>
<p>Jae-won raised an eyebrow in confusion. “Why the sudden question?”</p>
<p>“Well, other guys your age are getting in trouble for dating too much, and yet here you are, no girlfriend in sight. I was wondering why.”</p>
<p>“I was too busy so I had to break up with my previous girlfriend. I did have feelings for someone, but it didn’t work out.” Jae-won shrugged.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee huffed at his response. “Why? I can’t believe someone would say no to you. You’re so flawlessly handsome and kind. You’re my son after all.”</p>
<p>“There are just some things we have no control over, I guess,” Jae-won said nonchalantly. He had by now decided to overcome his feelings for Yuri and move on.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee stared straight at her son “Do you see Si-yeon these days?”</p>
<p>“Si-yeon?” Jae-won repeated. “I met her before my business trip. What about her?”</p>
<p>“Don’t contact her for the meantime,” Mrs. Lee said sternly.</p>
<p><em>So this was what she wanted to say!</em> He placed his teacup down and asked. “Why? What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Tae-jun said that he doesn’t want to get married anytime soon,” Mrs. Lee said, massaging her temples. She’s clearly stressed by the recent happenings. “He has someone else.”</p>
<p>Jae-won just sipped from his teacup in response, completely unfazed by his mother’s words.</p>
<p>When she noticed her son’s insouciance, she drew closer. “You knew about this?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes.”</p>
<p>“Then how come you didn’t tell me?” She demanded, her voice slightly loud. Exasperated by her son’s lack of communication, she continued. “We could have discussed this and prevented it in advance.”</p>
<p>Jae-won snorted. “Prevented it? Really? By preventing it you mean let grandfather do something again, just like what he did to Ji-ye Kim?” he said sharply.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee was taken aback by her son’s straightforwardness. She composed herself, taking in a deep breath. “How did you-”</p>
<p>Jae-won cut her off. “After uncle passed away, I cleared out his pensions because Tae-jun didn’t want to do it. Uncle’s driver told me everything.”</p>
<p>“Does Tae-jun know about this?” Mrs. Lee asked, fisting her knuckles in distress.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, but I didn’t tell him anything. Nothing good will come out of it, anyway. I also told the driver to keep his mouth shut.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee released the breath she’d been holding. She shook her head slightly, trying to make Jae-won understand. “It’s nothing like that. If we discussed it, we could’ve prevented Si-yeon from visiting your grandfather.”</p>
<p>Jae-won blinked, surprised that Si-yeon took the matter right into her own hands. “Si-yeon? Not Mrs. Go?”</p>
<p>“Everything would have been much simpler if it was Mrs. Go. There would surely be room for compromise, but not with Si-yeon. She told Tae-jun to end it with his woman but of course, he didn’t listen. You know how he is. He’s always been so stubborn, and your grandfather is already so furious. Things are just a mess.” Mrs. Lee whined dramatically.</p>
<p>“I mean, that’s a different story. I’m not seven. I don’t have to obey your command to not meet my friends because of a family issue.”</p>
<p>“You know how your grandfather is. If he can’t persuade Tae-jun, he would for sure use Si-yeon to his advantage.” Mrs. Lee warned.</p>
<p>“You mean there’s a chance that he’ll manipulate me to degrade Si-yeon?”</p>
<p>Jung-hee didn’t bother denying Jae-won’s presumption. She knew how the chairman treated his two grandsons, and she knew that this was bound to happen. But it still felt unpleasant, hearing it being said out loud.</p>
<p>“Does this make sense to you?” Jae-won asked as he looked at his mother. He suddenly remembered the question he’d been meaning to ask. “What about Tae-jun’s woman? Si-yeon and I are already treated this way, that woman though-”</p>
<p>“He would surely take action, especially when Tae-jun’s being so uncooperative.”</p>
