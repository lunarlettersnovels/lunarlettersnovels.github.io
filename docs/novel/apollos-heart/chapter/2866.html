            <p><strong>Chapter 139 – The Wrong Woman (2)</strong></p>
<p>In-bae Lee’s face distorted into a frown. <em>Tae-jun, that young punk was pretty meticulous. Or was it his grandfather who was in charge of everything?</em> He never wanted to be associated with the Seoin Group in such a negative way. He blamed it all on Myung-je Jin, that son of a bitch. It was Jin’s fault that he was blackmailed with the ledger, the ledger was stolen, and that he was now enemies with Tae-jun Seo.</p>
<p>“What should we do? Since the guys of Seoin aren’t proactively moving, the ledger must still be in the bitch’s possession,” Sang-gu said without confidence.</p>
<p>“Should’ve destroyed it back in America.”</p>
<p>In-bae Lee clenched his teeth in fury. The girl had been quiet for four years, so he mistakenly believed that the ledger was in Hye-seong Jin’s possession. He should have taken more precautions. <em>No, it was not late yet. Not if he acts now.</em></p>
<p>His evil black eyes twinkled. “It’s not too late to exterminate the little bitch. Then, the ledger will never be exposed. Luckily she’s still unconscious, so get rid of her for good this time.”</p>
<p>“Did you find out the girl’s status on your own? She is currently protected by the Seoin Group, so it’s a challenge to approach her…”</p>
<p>“Nevermind that. Just remember. This is the last shot we got. If we don’t get her this time, we’re finished for good.”</p>
<p>Sang-gu got a headache. He knew very well from experience that his boss was short-tempered. His consequence would not only end at getting fired.</p>
<p>Sang-gu stepped out of In-bae Lee’s office and returned home. He pulled out a bird’s eye view map of the interior of Seoin Hospital and pondered for a while. According to In-bae Lee’s source, the girl was located in the VIP room on the east side of the building. It was a special room where only authorized people with an ID card, such as registered nurses and doctors, could enter. Moreover, two security guards were stationed to watch over each room. It was definitely challenging to break in.</p>
<p><em>Then how would they get in?</em></p>
<p>He concluded that there was one way: to climb up through the windows. There would be one female nurse in the room, and she went home after ten at night, so there was his chance.</p>
<p>He meticulously prepared and headed to the hospital on time.</p>
<p><em>What a difficult bitch, this girl is!</em></p>
<p>Frankly, four years ago, he did not expect this job to become so complex and cumbersome. Push a disabled guy in front of a car and drown a daughter that ran away… He thought that was it. And he had done it countless times! But then, they made a major mistake with a girl.</p>
<p><em>What a dumb move!</em></p>
<p><em>Never expected the two to switch outfits!</em></p>
<p>In addition, he believed the lie that Myung-je Jin’s daughter’s red sports car was not there. He was positive that there was only one girl in the storage room…</p>
<p>&lt;—-<em><strong>Flashback begins</strong></em> —&gt;</p>
<p><em><strong>“Who… who are you people!”</strong></em></p>
<p>When he broke into the door and turned on the flashlight, the woman squinted and covered her eyes. He noticed a notably red bloodstain on her clothes. He remembered the story that the woman who had fled ruined one of Myung-je Jin’s reliable guards.</p>
<p>Sang-gu covered the woman’s mouth and inserted the syringe without hesitation. Then, he had plunged the restless body into the river. He did so to naturally make it appear as if the woman died as a result of suicidal actions.</p>
<p>&lt;—-<em><strong>Flashback ends</strong></em> —&gt;</p>
<p>It was not until the woman’s body was found that he realized he had killed the wrong woman… that he had killed Myung-je Jin’s daughter. The girl he should have gotten rid of was on a plane to America.</p>
<p>And now, she was in Tae-jun Seo’s arms…</p>
<p><em>That lucky little bitch!</em></p>
<p><em>Whatever it is, that luck ends today!</em></p>
<p>Sang-gu smirked and accelerated the car. Two of his subordinates were waiting in front of the hospital. Fortunately, the hospital room he wanted to use was vacant. Even if it was occupied, he would have used it, but it’s better not to cause any drama.</p>
<p>Once he arrived at the hospital, he ordered his subordinates to vigilantly guard the hospital, then wrapped a rope around his waist. Then he stood on the window sill. The floors below the fifth storey had security alarms attached to the walls, but Sang-gu was standing on the ninth floor.</p>
<p>He boasted his rock-climbing skills and successfully grabbed onto the window on the tenth floor. He opened it, entered the hospital room, and instantly examined the area. The spacious room even had a reception room inside. Besides the machines buzzing, there was no sound of people. Beneath the curtains lay a woman wearing an oxygen mask.</p>
<p>Sang-gu fished out an ampule and syringe from his pocket. The ampule would cause a seizure and instant suffocation if injected into the fluids. He cautiously approached the bed and opened the curtains.</p>
