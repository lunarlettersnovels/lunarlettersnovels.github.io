            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 13 – Lost Memories</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When their eyes met, the man nimbly smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri, shying away from the stranger’s kind gesture, shook her head and said, “Ah, no. It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C’mon, it’s really okay. I also like shrimps, so it won’t be a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was about to refuse again when the clerk, seeing the long line behind them, hinted to her to accept the offer. She had no choice but to oblige.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re too kind, sir. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My pleasure. You see that quote up there?” He pointed to a dangling piece of paper plastered on the wall, “‘It is better to share delicious food with others’, I’m only doing my bit. Besides, the food here is excellent if you were to ask me.” He smiled a sweet smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, he winked at Yuri and before she could come to terms with his antics, continued to converse with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you remember where we met before?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Am sorry?” She looked up at him and narrowed her eyes, trying to see if that face would ring any bells. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fellow!!!</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is he hitting on me?!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing her confused and clueless, the fellow was disappointed. His eyes lost their cheer. In a dejected tone, he said, “We met a few days ago, on your way out of the director’s office.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, now I remember!!! He was the one holding an item that looked like a painting covered in paper!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting on a small smile, she nodded. “I remember you now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it is destiny so, why don’t we get to know each other? Let’s begin with names, shall we? I’m Jae-won Lee and you are?” He confidently prodded, his face resplendent as he expected an immediate answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m Yuri Han.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ms. Han, will you be seeing Si-yeon… ah no, the Director today? I’m asking because I’ll be visiting her office later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. I don’t have a reason to.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, really. Too bad!” As he spoke, Jae-won scratched his head in embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, the attendant at the counter handed Yuri a box of dim sums and a couple of take-out orders to Jae-won. When she got her tray, she turned towards the generous man, who winked at her again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Enjoy your meal!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri nodded and mumbled a small thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems he was taking food for a lot of people as he held several packages in both hands, even so, he was able to wave one hand to Yuri.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Left alone to her peace, at last, Yuri found herself a quiet corner to sit in and followed Jae-won’s retreating figure with her gaze. He was heading out of the store in wide strides seemingly in a hurry. Her mind went back to the moment of his slip of the tongue. Although he’d been quick to mask it, she had still noticed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wonder what’s his position that he so casually mentions the director by her name? With his looks and confidence, he doesn’t look like an ordinary employee.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t long before the aroma of the dim sums wafted to her nose and her stomach grumbled in protest–she was quite famished. Hence, she decided to mull over the man she just encountered while savoring her favorite dish.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director Yoon is already engaged. Is he her fiance then?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that note, the image of the glinting diamond ring sitting on Si-yeon’s fourth finger came to her mind. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That must’ve cost a fortune!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While her mind drifted, her chopsticks unconsciously began cutting the fat dim sums into half.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Yuri lived in Jinseong, on his way back from work, her father would sometimes bring dim sums from Seohwadang. However, it had been a very long time since he had brought back anything for her. One day, before she knew it, he was gone leaving her by herself, all alone. He was not coming back ever, she knew that. After all, her father was no more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was even more distressing was the fact that she had no memories of his death. According to her uncle, who’d arranged the funeral, it was a car accident. He was intoxicated when he drove his car one unfortunate night. It was such a tragedy–which she had no recollection of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her memory was vague as if covered in a dark veil. No matter how she tried to see through it, all there was, was darkness. Hopefully, coming back to her hometown would help her regain her lost memories?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She heaved a sigh and brushing aside her wandering thoughts, decided to focus on her meal. However, when she looked at her plate, she was dumbfounded–the neatly arranged dim sums were all cut into half.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I the one who did this?</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>It’s too hot, let me cut these for you.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if on cue, a manly voice suddenly sliced through her head. Her hands shook, the chopsticks dropped to the table.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was it just now?!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voice was familiar yet she couldn’t figure who its owner was. In her past, long buried with all her lost memories, there was also someone else who knew how she loved the dim sums from Seohwadang. That person would bring her these treats and divide them into half for her, so they could quickly cool enough to eat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The snippet of memory that had flashed in her mind unbidden, for some reason, made her queasy. She felt her stomach churning and the bile surging to her throat. Covering her mouth tightly, with wobbly but rushed steps, she headed towards the comfort room.</span></p>
<p><b><i>⸙⸙⸙</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jae-won reached the director’s office, he thought it would be just Secretary Kim who would greet him as usual. To his surprise, another man, whom he very much knew, was also in the room. When their eyes met, Mr. Lee stood up and bowed his head to him. Jae-won returned the gesture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, Mr. Lee, you are also here! Is my cousin, Mr. Seo, here too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, with his fiancée, Ms. Yoon.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why aren’t I surprised!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since his engagement with the heiress of the West In Group of Companies, Tae-jun was pushing his business in top gear. However, Si-yeon proved to be his match–she was not just an ordinary, foxy woman who would risk everything. A true tactician, she didn’t give it all without earning a massive profit on her end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two were indeed a match for each other, people said. Their upcoming union would be a win-win situation for both of them–and their families, of course. Their engagement steeled the partnership between two powerful companies. In terms of business, this was destined to rule the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in terms of genuine affection between the couple, it was quite another story. No one could say for certain if it ever existed between them. Not that it was necessary. After all, love is not a prerequisite for flourishing a wealthy empire…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fact made Jae-won wonder if compared to them, he could be considered abnormal. Why not? In this kind of world, he couldn’t afford to do the things they did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a broad smile, he offered one steaming box to Mr. Lee. “Are you hungry? I brought dim sums with me. Try some! I bought a lot.” By now, Ms. Kim appeared in the doorway. “Ah, Ms. Kim, these dim sums are from Seohwadang! It’s still a good business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, Si-yeon, her quest for profitable business partners, had brought her to Jinseong to try the dim sums from Seohwadang. A tiresome transaction which led to fruitful results–Seohwadang dim sums are now offered in Daejin Department Store. Ms. Kim, who was aware of her boss’ efforts, smiled and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It still enjoys the top spot on our sales rankings in the food court. I heard that Seohwadang dim sums were introduced by Mr. Jae-won Lee?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won was indeed the one who’d introduced the delicious dim sums to Si-yeon, but he was not the first one to have seen potential in the small, dull shop in Jinseong–it was none other than Tae-jun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years ago, Tae-Jun would travel to Jinseong, 2 hours from Seoul, just to buy the dim sums of Seohwadang. By and by, he had invited Jae-won to try the said delicacy. One thing led to the other and the rest, as they say, was now history.</span></p>
