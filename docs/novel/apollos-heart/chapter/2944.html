            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 60</strong></p>
<p>The house emanated a peculiar vibe. Neither was there the warmth typically associated with <em>home</em> nor a sense of unfamiliarity.</p>
<p>For some time now, Yuri had been looking around the house dejectedly but when her eyes caught sight of a strange object she stopped. It was a large dog, white fur spotted with yellow-brown, pretty large ears, and a beautiful straight back. It sat on the fireplace mantel in the living room.</p>
<p><em>Ah, why is such a large dog in this house?</em></p>
<p>Yuri took a closer look and immediately stepped back. It was not a living dog but a taxidermied animal!</p>
<p>Yuri gasped in surprise because it was the first time she had seen such a delicate specimen, not to mention that it was an everyday dog rather than a bird, deer, or a tiger.</p>
<p>Suddenly she felt an arm around her shoulders and Tae-jun, pointing at the stuffed dog said, “Are you surprised? That’s Sebastian. He was a smart and well-trained English Pointer. He was thirteen when he died.”</p>
<p>Yuri’s face stiffened.</p>
<p>“Was he yours?” She barely whispered.</p>
<p>“I raised him for over thirteen years from when he was born until he died of old age.” His voice was sans emotions still.</p>
<p>“Then why did you taxidermize him?”</p>
<p>The rational thing to do when a treasured pet died was to bury or cremate the body. This was the first time she had seen it so. Needless to say, she found it a little creepy and the man scary.</p>
<p>“I want what is mine to remain as it is whenever I want.” Tae-jun answered nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Yuri had to wonder what went in this man’s head. She could not understand his actions, such as stuffing his pet dog, maintaining the house as it was, and bringing her here. For the callousness he evinced, his actions were eerily opposite.</p>
<p>Yuri swallowed a sigh and asked, “Are my things as they were?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Upon the reply, Yuri wanted to see the basement she used as her workspace. While it was only a temporary measure for a year, Yuri had drawn and created a lot of things. Since she had lived alone in the house without going out anywhere once, the only thing she could do was to create art.</p>
<p>“I want to see the basement.”</p>
<p>Yuri felt that she could get a hint about her lost memories. However, Tae-jun held her arm with a hand as she turned to the basement.</p>
<p>“Later.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun’s eyes darkened, and Yuri knew what it meant.</p>
<p>Without a word, he took off his jacket and threw it on the bed as he entered the bedroom on the second floor. He unbuttoned his shirt and sat on the bed before undoing his fastener.</p>
<p>Yuri stood in the doorway as he motioned her to come.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Yuri knew what he wanted, but she wondered who liked sucking another person’s c*ck. Of course, Tae-jun enjoyed licking her down below, but she did not. She stepped closer, forcing her legs to walk.</p>
<p>Making her kneel between his legs, he gently stroked the back of her neck.</p>
<p>“Suck.” He commanded.</p>
<p>Yuri could never get used to the size and its throbbing veins. She closed her eyes and pressed her lips on his hard length. Once she felt his hand on her nape tighten, she hesitantly opened her mouth. She used her tongue to lick its head and maneuvered her mouth as his erect*on began to get even bigger.</p>
<p>He forced her to face upwards as she started to do it.</p>
<p>She shook her head with a disapproving sound, but he did not let her go. He did not want to miss a moment of her flushed face. She slapped his hand away when he stroked her cheek, and her insolent actions made him chuckle. She was never the obedient type. Nor was he.</p>
<p>Tae-jun jerked his hips in retaliation, and Yuri furrowed her brows as his erect*on scraped her throat.</p>
<p>“You’re still awkward.” He murmured languidly and caressed her hair.</p>
<p>He seemed to be enjoying Yuri’s unskilled moves because it confirmed that she had not experienced other men. The hand that had been stroking her hair slid to the earlobe and then went on to undo her blouse. Putting a hand between the slit, he glided on her smooth back before squeezing her mound.</p>
<p>Yuri made a sound and looked up at the errant man as he toyed with her hardened assets. He was driving her crazy as he continued to bother her while she was being forced to do something she had little experience in. However, uncaringly, the man continued to play with her small, taut n*pples.</p>
<p>“I’ll go on if you don’t do well.” He warned.</p>
<p>Yuri placed a hand on his thigh and wrapped the other around the base because she found it difficult to keep her hold as his erect*on began to reach the cl*max. She s*cked him deep enough, her lips almost touching the small hair.</p>
<p>The sensations of her dainty tongue groping and wrapping him were exquisite. While it was not enough for him to eject, the sight of her face between his legs and her fervently moving lips drove him in a frenzy. He wanted to grab the back of her head, thrust deep into her throat and let go.</p>
<p>Tae-jun imagined Yuri’s expression when he filled her mouth. His own mouth watered when he thought of his c*m dangling from her long eyelashes… however, now he chose to console her endeavors rather than satisfying his desires. The night was still young, after all.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop there.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun slowly removed his length. He helped Yuri stand after rubbing it off with his finger. He then positioned her such that she was lying downward against the bed and rolled up her skirt. He slid a finger between the red flesh that revealed itself.</p>
<p>Yuri’s body shook, and her juices matted the fiddling fingers. He was satisfied that she had wet herself but was still too dry. The man lowered his lips to between her legs, the woman could not repress a shout.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah…”</p>
<p>Her spine tingled, her arms swept the bed as she tried to escape the sudden sensations. However, her legs spread on their own accord, and Tae-jun’s head delved deeper.</p>
