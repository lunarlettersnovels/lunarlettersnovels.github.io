            <p><strong>Chapter 101</strong></p>
<p>Jin-wook used to be a police officer. His skills were extraordinary earning him the sobriquet ‘cadaver dog’. Who knew that such an exemplary man would have a dismal and abrupt end? It so happened, that while on duty he was stabbed in the neck with a screwdriver. The perpetrator was a twenty year old girl who had surely caught him unawares. Luckily, it was not a life or death situation, nor was it without some permanent damage. The once dauntless man, after recovery, was being haunted by the screwdriver in the middle of the night, during meals, and wakng hours. He turned violent because of this trauma. As a result he was ill-disposed to function, in the end had to give up on his dream of being a police officer.</p>
<p>Although he resigned from police he was scouted by CEO Jeong-ho Seo, whom he had met in the past. His new position helped recover his stability, but he still dared not keep a screwdriver at home. Even so, the offender made it into his life and home, she was currently his wife. Can fate get any stranger?</p>
<p>He found out that he suffered from PTSD only after he recovered his stability. After some research on PTSD symptoms, he also realized that his symptoms were not very significant compared to others. This was probably thanks to the affection his wife showed during his whole journey.</p>
<p>Jin-wook spoke as he pointed at the patient room. “The situation got much more serious, so the chairman might hear about this. Just make sure to deny any knowledge about it.”</p>
<p>“What about you?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have to stick to it.”</p>
<p>“Jin-wook, you don’t have that woman, Jiye Kim, still in your head, do you?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. She’s not in my head, but I do think about her sometimes. If I hadn’t obeyed the chairman’s command to bring that girl to him, the girl would never have been harmed, and the president would not have left the house either. ”</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tae-jun would not have developed such a great attachment to his possessions either.</p>
<p>Jin-wook was introduced to Chairman Jeong-ho Seo back when he was police. After his parents’ death his situation turned dire, he was struggling to care for himself and his little brother with the little pay he was receiving. Thus, when the chairman had asked him, who was a skilled, genius man in his trade, to secretly bring a girl to him, he had readily accepted the job. He hadn’t thought much about it then, simply dismissing it as the run-of the mill ‘rich boy falling in love with poor girl’ trope. In this view, the man wanted to toss her some money had end her relationship with his son.</p>
<p>Of course, this assumption was made before Jin-wook realized what kind of a monster the chairman was.</p>
<p>“Even if you didn’t find her, someone else would have.” His little brother placated him.</p>
<p>“I know bro.”</p>
<p>“He won’t mess with you as long as I’m beside you. Be sure to guard the VIP room, and tell me if anything happens.” Jin-wook made Jin-jo promise him.</p>
<p>Jin-ho nodded in reply.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>The woman lay white as a ghost with her eyes firmly shut. Tae-jun had his mind preoccupied with her even during the important meeting with a foreign executor. He shook hands, spoke, read papers, but in his mind there was only Yuri.</p>
<p>The current scenario was beyond his imagination. He admitted he was rampant, how could he’ve ignored she had suicidal tendencies. her file was filled with the times she attempted it in the past. He had been well-aware of her mental instability, yet he had turned a blind eye and was at his willful worst. He should’ve put more thought into her, approached this whole thing patiently. This was clearly his fault.</p>
<p>Alas, regret had no pill. He cautiously stroked her cheek, hisevery touch filled with remorse. His heart ached at the sight, he felt like bashing himself. As he gazed at her still form, he noticed that she had gained a hint of warmth, she seemed better than from when he had brought her here. A slight relief surged within along with fierce fury.</p>
<p><em>How dare she try to escape from me … How dare she …</em></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the relief within still prevailed, she was safe now.</p>
<p>He was filled with a myriad of feelings, he didn’t know which ones to express and which ones to suppress, if at all. He felt like an immature idiot, someone who knew nothing but making a ruckus out of everything. But then again, how would he have known any better? His life was an epitome of chaos, feelings and emotions were just hearsay. When his parents could abandon him, could there be anything left in the twelve year old boy?</p>
<p>“Yuri, you think I’m going to let you just disappear from my life?” His deep voice whispered into her ears. The fingers on the cheeks glided to the eyelids, then slid down the nosebridge and to the lips. Funny how his mood lifted at the thought of how those soft lips used to nibble on his memeber.</p>
<p>He had greatly regretted it. He should have run to her when he noticed the library lights turned on. He should not have left her alone for a week. He should not have been so aggressive to her.</p>
<p><em>It’s all my fault. I’m sorry.</em></p>
<p>He’d barely regretted or apologized in his life, but he was doing so to this woman countless times. He was torn within, he had died a million deaths already. He should’ve treasured her but all he did was torment her. His heart ached, he wished to undo it all.</p>
<p>As he heard the approaching footsteps, he slowly withdrew his hand away from Yuri’s lips.</p>
<p>“I’ve sworn everyone to secrecy, but your grandfather should hear about this anytime soon.” Jin-wook reported.</p>
<p>“I had no intention to hide it in the first place.” Tae-jun had regained his nonchalance.</p>
<p>“And according to Jin-ho, her memory loss might be the cause of the PTSD.”</p>
<p><em>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. According to Jay, the doctor who diagnosed Yuri was a PTSD specialist.</em> Tae-jun tried to chase away his fatigue and stared at Yuri. He remembered how young and healthy she was 5 years ago.</p>
<p><em>What had happened to you while I was away …</em></p>
