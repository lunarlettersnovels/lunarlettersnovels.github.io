            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 16</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sir?” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have I done something wrong again?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Give it to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised by his fierce look, Mr. Lee handed over the small ornament to Tae-jun without even asking why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What kind of woman was she?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?” This assistant was on a confusion spree thanks to his boss’ volley of questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What did the woman look like?” Tae-jun was getting impatient now. Left to him, he’d shake the answers out of this dimwit called assistant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Lee stuttered and described the woman as her image came to his mind. “She was tall and fair… I think she had big eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What floor?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First-floor lobby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Tae-jun’s turn to bolt now. Getting out of the car, he made it straight into the building. Mr. Lee, stunned, chased after him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arriving in the lobby on the first floor, Tae-jun scoured the surroundings, his sharp eyes darting in all directions. His heart was beating fast, blood gushing through his veins wildly. Like a hound in search of a hidden prey in a deep thicket, he felt his senses heightened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a long time, his senses as a hunter had come alive. Amidst the crowd, Tae-jun snatched a woman’s arm out of the blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman held up by him looked at him in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. This isn’t her.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">God damn it!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He muttered under his breath. The energy he felt right around here was gone. He felt as if his life was sucked out of his mouth, helplessness, dejection, and grief suffused his dark eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman slipped out of his grasp… a second time.</span></p>
<p><b><i>⸙</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun, who’d changed his schedule to visit the company and thereon his parents’ home, did a u-turn and went straight to hisplace. All along, he held the ornament between his fingers and examined it closely. It was not branded nor a ready-made product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he reached, he went directly to his study and opened the drawer. Taking a picture out of the paper bag in the drawer, he put it on his desk. It was a picture of CCTV footage of the Hotel Seoin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hye-yeon! It </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun contrasted the ornament in his hand with the ornament on the woman’s bag in the picture. There was no way he could miss this unique design. It matched! Then he poured out the contents of the paper bag onto the desk and picked out all the other pictures that featured the bag, and compared them again, just to be sure. Match again! He glared at the photo to the point he got goosebumps all over his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in frustration, he banged his fist on the desk. The pictures laying atop sprang in the air and scattered all over the floor… mirroring the master’s mood at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun, who’d smoked two cigarettes in a row now, called Jin-wook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How are things in Jinseong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Sir, I think there was a mistake, just like you said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-wook’s voice sounded urgent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mistake?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun ran his tongue over his dry lips to moisten them. In the back of his mind, he was swiftly surmising. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dead Hye-yeon Jin and a living woman.</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All personal information–false. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, his conjecture was leading him to a terrible conclusion, the one he hoped against hope would be untrue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-I found someone who used to work at the Hotel Jinseong. Her name is Hyun-ah Kim and she worked at the front desk for a long time. She knows the Jins very well. During her time there, she often saw the family visiting the hotel. But… Hyun-ah says the woman in the picture is not Hye-yeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun closed his eyes feeling dizzy. It was a different person. The woman who he believed was Hye-yeon for years was a completely different person!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the moment he saw the girl walking in the hotel lobby, to the time when he received Jin-wook’s report, a tiny assumption had crept in his mind, the kind he had hoped would be proven wrong and sooner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, it had been quite the opposite.</span></p>
<p><b><i>⸙</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon returning from the department store, Yuri made an international call to Dr. Davis, ignoring the time difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the half-asleep doctor received the call, he knew the reason without needing to be told. However, he was reluctant to give more medicine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to his worried voice, Yuri realized she was still a pretty troubled patient, still under observation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Your problem is memory loss. If fundamental trauma treatment is not preceded, taking medicine will not solve the problem. You’re not going to eat it all at once like last time, are you?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she had to say she didn’t mean to, but she couldn’t get herself it easily. The last time it happened, she didn’t do it because she wanted to. Heck, she didn’t even remember doing that before. It was like a barometric difference between inside and outside like the passing time of reality and herself stuck in some parts of the past and when the gap reaches its peak, it explodes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis’ soothing voice wafted from the other end, seemingly aware of the turmoil she was going through at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-As I’ve said before, this medicine is quite dangerous. I gave it to you because you’re in so much pain, but you shouldn’t keep relying on meds. You know it is not good for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some more advice and soothing, the worried Davis hung the call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not like she was oblivious to his concern, she too was helpless. As his worried voice rang in her ears, Yuri fidgeted with the part where the bag ornament had fallen off. It was only when she was in the taxi that she realized one of the ornaments had disappeared. It seemed to have fallen off when it was caught by a man’s cuff in the elevator. She felt bad for losing it because it was handmade from agate stone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The headache, which started from walking around the department store, was still tormenting her. When she put one hand on her head, she was able to feel the heat. It was a recurring symptom. Davis said she shouldn’t rely on medicines, but Yuri crawled to take the medicine and lay in bed after downing one. Her eyelids quickly became heavy.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Yuri.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere between dream and reality, on the hazy threshold, someone called out to her.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Yuri, Yuri Han.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voice was friendly. It was only then that Yuri knew who was calling her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little chubby cheeks, eyes that squinted when she smiled, deep dimples… such were the features of the person who first came across her mind when she heard the voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri was dragged into some time in the past. A time which remained a hazy memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of answering the voice, she opened her eyes and called out her name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hye-yeon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Hye-yeon Jin.</span></p>
