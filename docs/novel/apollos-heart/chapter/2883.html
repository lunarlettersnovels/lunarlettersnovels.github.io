            <p><strong>Chapter 122 – To Be President (2)</strong></p>
<p>It was a heavy word, and equally heavy responsibilities came with it. The position had always been Tae-jun’s, so he was not really coveting it nor did he show keenness, since the position would undoubtedly be his when the time comes. However, it seemed that the time could be shortened a little to keep this woman by his side. He was going to call the people he had gathered while he was still a business manager, and the framed picture of his face would be the last courtesy to his grandfather.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do as you please.</strong></em></p>
<p>He’s not sure what storm was about to take place. The consent of his grandfather was relatively easier than what he had prepared for. And even if he wasn’t given the consent, the situation of both Si-yeon and Daejin Group was still his responsibility.</p>
<p>“Just wait until I fix everything,” Tae-jun said after a lingering silence.</p>
<p>Yuri didn’t say anything after that. She wasn’t crying, she wasn’t pushing him away, and that was enough for Tae-jun. He wound his arms around her even tighter as he engulfed her in his embrace.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>Lawyers from both sides were present in the meeting. Si-yeon frowned as soon as she stepped inside at the sight of Tae-jun’s handsome face sullied with a scratch on his eye. It was like a dent on a sculpture-like face. <em>What a waste!</em></p>
<p>“What’s wrong with your face?” Si-yeon asked as he neared her.</p>
<p>“It was hit by the frame the president threw.” Tae-jun shrugged and nonchalantly answered.</p>
<p>“You would’ve avoided it if you’re fast enough,” Si-yeon said, folding her arms.</p>
<p>“You are right.” Tae-jun agreed. And she was right indeed. If he didn’t take care of everything, the woman next to him would eventually get hurt, taking the fall for his actions.</p>
<p>Concerned that she was, she couldn’t help but still feel upset that he was covering up for someone, and right in front of her face, too.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you’d be with someone like that,” Si-yeon commented.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you’d come here yourself, either. I thought Mrs. Yoon would come on your behalf.” Tae-jun responded.</p>
<p>“My mom doesn’t know about it, yet. If she finds out, she’s going to find Yuri Han and grab her by the hair. I hate it, and I don’t want any more noise about this issue. My mom started it, but I’m going to finish it since it’s still my engagement,” Si-yeon said with finality to her voice.</p>
<p>“Okay. Let’s get right into it then. I’ve already signed it in advance,” Tae-jun said, glancing at his lawyer.</p>
<p>He took out the documents he had prepared and handed it to Si-yeon’s lawyer.</p>
<p>“You managed to say yes this time,” Si-yeon said, eyeing Tae-jun.</p>
<p>“Well, the result is the same either way.”</p>
<p>Si-yeon straightened her back as she asked the question she’d been meaning to ask. “Let me ask you one thing. When did the relationship between you two start?”</p>
<p>“We met five years ago, but we broke up for a while four years ago.” Tae-jun answered.</p>
<p>“How so?” Si-yeon asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Si-yeon Yoon, you and I are pretty much the same.”</p>
<p>Si-yeon raised her eyebrows. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see you as an enemy. So do me a favor and don’t change the subject by asking me such questions. I hate wasting my time, and I’ll answer only because I owe you debt.”</p>
<p><em>‘What a temper this guy has. I wonder how Yuri Han would be able to handle such a temperamental man.’ </em>Si-yeon thought.</p>
<p>“Well, what are you planning to do next?”</p>
<p>“That’s a question that you don’t need to ask since you’re already sitting here.” Tae-jun remarked.</p>
<p>“I’ll do everything, should you want to fix what we have,” Si-yeon said, trying to make Tae-jun understand the situation they were in.</p>
<p>“Why? Did we have a bad relationship?” Tae-jun asked, waiting for her answer.</p>
<p>“We need each other. We can be so much more if we are in this together. I’m not asking for anything big, am I? I never asked you to love me. All I’m asking for is a civil, amicable partnership.” Si-yeon stated, her voice unwavering.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a relationship that stemmed from love; it was a relationship that benefitted each other’s interests. Si-yeon never loved anyone with her heart, so she could not understand the predicament Tae-jun was in.</p>
<p>Tae-jun sighed. “I’m done with thinking about what I would or would not gain from this. There’s so much for me to lose than we’ll ever gain together.”</p>
<p><em>What the hell is love that seems to be so powerful that it has made this man, who is firm and cool-headed more than anyone else, lose control?</em> Si-yeon couldn’t understand his frustrations and envied the woman who was showered with such unwavering love.</p>
<p>Her lawyer brought the documents that had been read and reviewed thoroughly. Si-yeon skimmed over the files handed to her, speaking flatly as she leafed through the papers. “I had a bad dream last night. I dreamt that I was trying to make money like this,” she said it as if she couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I wanted to apologize for putting you in such a position,” Tae-jun said while Si-yeon was signing the papers.</p>
<p>Si-yeon smoothened the papers with her hands. “If that’s the case, I will apologize in advance. My mom won’t let this go. She will be quite a handful.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun nodded. “I’ll take care of it.”</p>
<p>“All right then.” Si-yeon forced a small smile and stood up from her seat.</p>
<p>Of all the mountains he had to climb, Si-yeon Yoon was by far the easiest hurdle he had to jump over. <em>Is Mrs. Yoon the next mountain he has to face?</em> <em>The press would surely be next. The announcement of the breakup should be timed with the purchasing of the shares.</em></p>
<p>Tae-jun’s phone rang from his pocket. He took it out and saw it was Jae-won. “What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Brother, I am here with Roy Jean at the villa,” Jae-won said on the other line.</p>
<p><em>Roy Jean?</em> Come to think of it, Jae-won said that he would meet him today to explain the situation. Tae-jun abruptly stood up from his seat, suddenly feeling anxious.</p>
<p>“And?” Tae-jun prodded.</p>
<p>“There’s no sign of Yuri.”</p>
<p>“What?” Tae-jun asked agitatedly.</p>
<p>“Yuri is gone.”</p>
<p><em>Goddammit!</em> Tae-jun gritted his teeth as he closed his eyes, breathing in deeply with his nose.</p>
