            <p><strong>Chapter 81</strong></p>
<p>He was not the only person wrecked by s*xual desire. The look in her eyes reflected his feelings. She had plunged into this bottomless abyss, willingly.</p>
<p>Locking his hands onto her waist, he shoved himself inside of her. A squeaky racket obnoxiously hit his ears. He made her lean on the mirror and propped her chin up.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>You better remember … How you look when I come inside you.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The woman in the mirror turned crimson. Her eyes were teared up, her cherry red lips quivered. She had on a dreamy expression, her beauty triggering him full on. He felt nauseous, every nerve of him seemed to react to her.</p>
<p>Yuri was on the verge of tears, but she did not stop squeezing and relaxing on his shaft. She was ravening for every single drop of his seed. She did not want to admit it, but her body desired him.</p>
<p>“Hmm …”</p>
<p>Yuri sighed as she took off her clothes and stepped into the shower. There were so many afterimages running through her head. Her fingers were acting on their own like when she was focused on her work.</p>
<p>When her slump impeded her from drawing, the people around her sincerely recommended s*xual int*rcourse. She even had a coworker who got her inspirations from indulging in debauchery.</p>
<p>But Yuri had shaken her head every time. It was impossible for her to build up such a desire. She enjoyed lewd s*x in her dreams. She could never imagine sleeping with someone in real life.</p>
<p>But ever since she started having s*x with Tae-jun, the fantasies that she had tried to resist were starting to colonize her mind. What she saw through the mirror last night, the scorching heat and tension, the energetic man, the bleary-eyed woman, were all wildly boosting up her artistic creativity.</p>
<p>As she was lathering up the body wash all over her body, she noticed sem*n flow out from in between her legs. It was as if Tae-jun, who would always affectionately clean her with a towel after a session, had left a mark to indicate his possession of her. But no matter how much he tried, there was no chance that he would impregnate her.</p>
<p>Yuri carefully scratched out the residue in between her legs.. Her body felt too weak to function properly anymore. She silently looked down as yesterday’s residue was washed away.</p>
<h3><em>⸙⸙⸙ </em></h3>
<p>In the living room downstairs was Manager Choi awaiting her. Once she saw her, she greeted her. “I was just about to wake you up for breakfast.”</p>
<p>The dining table was filled with platters of delicious dishes prepared for Yuri. Chicken soup, cooked abalone, crab, steamed sea bream, eel and galbi, an assortment of vegetables, pancakes, and three types of kimchi. The quantity was more than enough for a party.</p>
<p>The menu intimidated Yuri. These were all foods known to build stamina. She didn’t have to think hard as to whose brains this idea had popped from. She inwardly sighed and resigned to her fate. The man was hopeless in this regard.</p>
<p>After she had finished her meal, Manager Choi handed her a small shopping bag.</p>
<p>“What is this?” she asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>“It’s the phone you used. The director had asked me to get it repaired, but I thought it would be better to replace it. Once it’s been in the water, it won’t function properly like before.” She smiled politely.</p>
<p>“Oh, thanks.”</p>
<p>She’d completely forgotten about the demise of her phone, but she was more surprised that the man had already dealt with it without her saying so.</p>
<p>When she turned on the phone, she was greeted by a series of missed calls and messages. It was Roy Jean who had left the most calls as usual. He must have been worried sick about her. She made a mental note to call him back and read through the list of missed calls. She noticed Hyeon-ah Kim’s number.</p>
<p><em>Could it be … that she found Hye-seong’s number?</em> Yuri hastily called her back.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“Hello?” Hyeon-ah Kim’s drowsy voice sounded from the other end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Manager Kim, it’s me, Yuri. I saw that you had called me …”</p>
<p>She was no longer a manager, but Yuri couldn’t come up with an appropriate way to address her. After all, it was a habit she had picked up when substituting Hye-yeon. The woman on the other end too didn’t seem to care. She simply continued with the conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“Did something happen? You didn’t reply for a while.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“I’m sorry. I dropped my phone in water so I had to get it repaired. Do you, by any chance, happen to know where Hye-seong is?”</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“Sorry. I don’t.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>She was disappointed by the firm response. <em>Then why did she call?</em> She silently waited for the other side to speak.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“To be honest, there’s something I was debating on whether to tell you or not, but I think it’s right to tell you. It’s about Mr. Han’s accident.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“About my father’s accident?”</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“It’s not something to talk through the phone. I would like to see you. Can you come to the café?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“I will. It would take about an hour or two.” She quickly agreed.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“That’s fine. I’ll wait.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yuri hung up the phone and rushed to get dressed. Information about her father’s accident … her heart was pounding.</p>
<p>However, before she could even take a step out, Manager Choi blocked her way.</p>
<p>“Where are you going, Ms. Han?” Her words were polite but assertive. Apparently, this girl’s previous “shopping” had not bode her too well it seems.</p>
<p>“I have someone to meet. May I go out?” Yuri caught her drift and decided to take the peaceful way out of this. After all, throwing a tantrum to have their way was something only children would do.</p>
<p>“Of course you may, but you will go with a driver and guards. And I will report this to the director. Will that do?”</p>
<p>Her boss would bring the roof down on all those breathing if this woman went missing. And Manager Choi was someone who never committed the same mistake twice, nor had to be told something twice.</p>
<p>Yuri nodded. Tae-jun wanted to help her recover her memories, so there was no reason for him to hinder her from meeting Hyeon-ah Kim. Besides, it was just a car and escorts, she would live with it.</p>
