            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 7 – His and Only His</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">T/N: This chapter contains mature scenes. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she saw him wear the condom, Hye-yeon flinched. She realized that the real thing was about to start. She didn’t know what to expect, and her heart was in her mouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was brusquely brought out of her inattention when she felt him grab her waist and pull her lady garden closer to his member.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensing a completely different feeling of his thing than ever, she looked up at him with astonishment.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a warning, Tae-jun slowly slid his length into her. Her eyes opened wide, she gasped, feeling as if the air was stuck in her throat. She tried to get away from him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, please, it hurts!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First time always does. You’ll feel good soon when you get used to it.” His voice was brimming with lust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun went all the way into her in one push, pressing her down so she wouldn’t escape. Hye-yeon whimpered and tightened her grip on the sheets. Her body shivered, finding it still difficult to accommodate him, even though he’d stimulated her before penetrating her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her quivering, too hot and tight va**na that had accepted a man’s meat for the very first time, sent him in delirium. This was a sensation that no woman had ever given him. The initial distaste of indulging a vestal was replaced with an insatiable desire and never like before pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Left to him, he wanted to pin her down and penetrate her as much as he could. And yet, he didn’t. He had Hye-yeon for himself, there was no rush. Today was not the last chance to gratify his desire. There would be many more coming, he could train her slowly. She was totally his for a year. What he was doing to her was a ritualistic act of imprinting himself on her. He would relish every bit of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He lowered his head to kiss her forehead and cheek. He had never put so much effort into caress before. Feeling her breath slowly stabilizing, he moved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, mmh.” Hye-yeon groaned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could no longer wait. When he saw the tears in her eyes, he started to groan. He was aroused like never before. She was a woman whose tears were seductive and he was a man enthralled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He licked her tears and pushed his meat to its hilt. He slid in and out of her beautiful pink, wet, lady parts repeatedly. As he stamped her body with his lips and tongue, he could feel her body shudder aimlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t you dare close your eyes.” He commanded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes, dimmed by the building pleasure, fluttered open and fixed upon his dark gaze. His dark pools seemed to pull her. As he looked into those pure orbs, Tae-jun felt an intense explosion within. It felt like the emotions that were caged since eons, were released. He let go, succumbed to his lust and in a few intense thrusts which caused her head to bang against the headboard multiple times, he reached his climax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweat trickled down her back, Hye-yeon struggled to catch her breath. When she finally did, she couldn’t help but utter. “Will our relationship be like this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her soft voice was as dismal as the darkness that shrouded the room. Burying his lips on the woman’s bare shoulders, Tae-jun spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will have you whenever I want to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I am a doll named ‘Hye-yeon’ to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t remember what he’d said when he heard her voice, but by the sound of it, it seemed like she’d given up everything.</span></p>
<p><b>❆❆❆</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun rubbed his face up and down vigorously. He reckoned he fell asleep leaning on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did he dream of the first time he had s*x with Hye-yeon for the first time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? He sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These past few days, he had slept but for less than two hours a day. It was also a hassle that the land deal overlapped with the annual event. To him, showing up for such dos was merely a duty, throw in a few interviews and personnel appointments in the mix and he went about the job mechanically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, he had to fight against the myriad of emotions that hit him like a plague at this time of the year—this was the month Hye-yeon died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-yeon Jin… whenever he thought of her, the dark and deep Jinseong river would appear before his eyes; the cold winds that gently touched his body and cut his heart, the sound of the softly flowing water that wreaked havoc in his senses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was still fresh like it’d happened just yesterday. And why not? For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was the woman who had given him hope only to fiercely beat him back to the bottomless abyss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time and again he’d asked himself how much longer it would take him to forget the woman who still lived in his dreams and memories. Time and again, the answer had been more dreams and memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[E/D: Really? Wonder who wanted it only for a year!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun’s eyes were fixated on the large TV screen. The video was paused on a face. It looked very…</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alive. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film still before his eyes was certainly not a dream. It was definitely her on the original CCTV in the lobby of Hotel Seoin. The very woman who had learnt, felt and gasped for pleasure underneath him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed like time had stood still too. Her white skin, straight nose, and deep black eyes looked just like they did then. Those slender fingers holding the phone, plump lips, were as inviting as they were then. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn’t believe that she was standing there in flesh and blood, in the pink of health, pretending to be someone who’d nothing to do with him. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did she really think she’s nothing to do with him now?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun wouldn’t allow that. Never would he let any man, boyfriend or husband, linger around her. No one but him was allowed to touch and feel her. She was his and only his. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d vowed to find her. If she were alive, he would find her; even if it meant turning the whole world upside down. If not? He would bring back her lifeless body, but find her, he would. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pulled out a cigarette and flipped it into his mouth. The moment he lit it, his eyes inadvertently gazed into those on the screen. He was reminded of how she hated cigarette smoke. She’d made him, a heavy smoker, give up smoking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wondered if she still hated it. Biting his lips, he puffed out on the woman on the screen.</span></p>
