            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 19 – Disillusioned Love (1)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restrained by a firm grip, Yuri reluctantly submitted. There was no way to free herself and set the record state right now. But that didn’t stop her from thinking of ways to get out of the situation. Turning her head sideways, she strained to look at what the man was up to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man looked down at her for a brief moment before tightening his grip on her further. Then, freeing his other hand he fished something out of his bag. It was a black thing with a small antenna. She was terrified at the sight of this queer object and almost screamed for help, but soon gave up the idea upon realizing this was a soundproof room. This fellow looked quite natural with what he was doing as if he’d overpowered and subdued people many times over. The dexterity with which he’d bound her hands with a mere tie, sent a shiver down her spine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few in the city of Jinseong were unaware that President Jin, a competent builder, and hotelier, was a forerunner in the crime circles. And having seen this middle-aged man’s brutality from up close, Yuri was clear about the workings of the likes of him. Seeing how this fellow had made a short work of her, she vaguely assumed he must belong to the same fraternity as the president. And if so, there was nothing good about getting on his nerves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, she noticed the man was not around her. Slowly, she pulled herself up and sat on the edge of the bed. Her eyes soon found him who was busy placing a radio-like object all over the room. It seemed like a scene from the TV show had come alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a while now, the man had been coming and going around the room like she didn’t exist. He was in his own world, doing god knows what. Even after hooking her gaze on him for this long, she couldn’t figure him. But then, suddenly, he just turned towards her and met her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri was startled at first, but upon seeing those dark, menacing eyes a sense of panic started to surge within. However, before it could manifest, a quote abruptly floated from the deep recesses of her mind: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘When encountering a tiger, you can survive if you hold yourself tight’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">… In fact, the man, dressed in all black, looked like a black leopard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly, the leopard approached her, she started to collect herself, determined to face him head-on.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t seem like there’s a camera or a bug, or is it yet to be installed?” he asked abruptly.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you talking about?” She’d imagined various scenarios in this short span of time, but this wasn’t one of them!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Yuri was preoccupied with puzzling over his words, he ran an electronic device </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">down her body as if scanning her.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Only then did she realize that it was a bug detector and shook her head.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, no, no, this is not what you think. The guest who stayed in this room a few days ago claimed to have left something behind, so I just dropped by to check.” She hurriedly explained.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What thing?” He was clearly not buying it.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This… necklace.” She pointed to the necklace that was now lying on the bed thanks to their prior scuffle.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked in the direction she was pointing at and then at her with a gaze full of suspicion.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hye-yeon Jin?”         </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying so, he abruptly reached out and yanked her name tag on the uniform. She didn’t even have the moment to think that the man who put out his hand to her chest was rude.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you Myung-je Jin’s daughter, the president of this hotel?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking on her feet, she tried to discern who he was. Seeing how he was testing rather than stating, she surmised he was not close to the Jins. And it seemed like he’d only heard of Myung-je Jin’s daughter, Hye-yeon, and never</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once seen her in the flesh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri knew every single person around Hye-yeon, including the few scumbags she’d dated. But the guy before her had never been included in any of those lists. That was another proof that he hadn’t seen or met her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was at a loss over what to do now. She was treading on thin ice and her next words would seal her fate. If she were, to be honest, and say she wasn’t Hye-yeon, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would he believe her? Or if she pretended to be her, would this dangerous man let her go?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throwing caution to the wind, she decided to bite the bullet. After all, she’d to urgently get out of here first even if it meant getting caught later.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I am!” she said, in a clear voice.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“… Let’s get things straightened out, shall we?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that note, he drew closer and started loosening the tie around her wrists. She groaned as she gently rubbed her red wrists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first encounter–straight out of a fairytale; the prince and the pauper had traded places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri had become Hye-yeon.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cold water slowly trickled down on Tae-jun’s perfectly sculpted body. His mind had wandered off.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you are President Jin’s daughter.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He’d smirked at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was slender, tall, and fair… when he’d untied them, her wrists were a deep red. Big, dark eyes graced her delicate face… showing resilience all along. She had a pleasant fragrance about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, he had qualms about her after all the whole scenario was uncanny. She wasn’t a spy but the daughter… like in a movie… Heck! What are the odds of such a happening in real life? She had sworn not to reveal anything, going as far as to make him promise the same… perhaps a ruse to convince him? She was more daring and intelligent than he thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they’d struck a deal, he was sure, as soon as he set her free, she would run and tell all. But somehow, now that he thought about it, he felt the woman would probably not say a word, especially to her father. He didn’t know why he felt so, but by and by his confidence deepened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before his arrival, he’d run a thorough check on all the personnel in Jinseong Construction and Hotel Jinseong. He only knew the name of the president’s daughter who had nothing to do with the business. Little had he expected that Myung-je Jin, who was like a snake, had such a beautiful daughter. As her dazed, frozen face when he’d bound her, came to his mind, his nether region stood erect.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the..!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perplexed, he looked down at his hard member. He felt he was demented, he didn’t like tying up girls but wanted to jerk off on a woman he’d never seen before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙⸙⸙</span></i></p>
