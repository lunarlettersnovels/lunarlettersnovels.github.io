            <p><strong>Chapter 175 – Side Story (6)</strong></p>
<p>Yuri’s face turned red when she realized what he meant.</p>
<p>Tae-jun chuckled and kissed her nape. “Don’t we need to check?”</p>
<p><em>Oh no!</em></p>
<p>He put her on the table without hesitation. As he was about to kiss her right away, she spoke hastily, “Wait, you’re not going to do that here, right?”</p>
<p>“I made everyone leave after they cleared our table.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Let’s do it here once and head to the hotel. I can’t hold back any longer.”</p>
<p>He lowered his head and kissed her as if he was not going to give her any more time to think. Then, his tongue slid into her mouth and sucked hers. Her heart still pounded fast even though they’d done this many times. Heat began to build up in her lower abdomen just by his hands touching her bosom. He kissed her even deeper and put his hand inside her dress.</p>
<p>“Did you choose this dress for this?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” he whispered with his lips still planted on hers.</p>
<p>When he spread her legs and put his finger deep inside her, her body trembled. It was getting wet between in there.</p>
<p>“You’re already wet?”</p>
<p>“It’s because… you’re too good,” she mumbled shyly.</p>
<p>He quickly unbuckled his belt and pulled down the zipper. Then, he pulled her hip as he wrapped her legs around his waist. She raised her arms and hugged his neck. Her panties had already been pulled down to her ankles.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>A moan slipped out of her mouth as he entered. A thick, hard shaft filled her inside. He kissed her as he moved his waist. He then pulled down her dress and kissed her white skin that was exposed. She twisted her body at the sweet and dizzying sensation. Stimulated by her reaction, he began to move even roughly.</p>
<p>As they reached the peak, she sought his lips. As he opened his lips, his hot tongue intertwined hers. The moment her body fell onto him, he came.</p>
<p>“Ha…!”</p>
<p>He breathed roughly and hugged her tightly. Feeling his warm body, she enjoyed the afterglow until the end.</p>
<p>He asked playfully as he put his hand inside her dress and stroked her back, “How does it feel to check mine?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t know.”</p>
<p>He smiled. “Should we do it until you learn it?”</p>
<p>“Tae-jun!” Yuri’s face turned red.</p>
<p>She had a feeling this was going to have a long night.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>A BB bullet narrowly deflected the can. His second and third try brought no different result.</p>
<p><em>What’s wrong?</em></p>
<p>A handsome boy with strong features was crying. Then he heard a familiar voice from the back.</p>
<p>“You have to spread your legs and straighten your arms. Keep your shoulders fixed and look straight ahead.”</p>
<p>As the voice told him to, he spread his feet, stretched out his arms, and fixed his shoulders. Looking straight ahead, he pulled the trigger. With a popping sound, the bullet hit the can. The can wobbled as if it was about to fall but eventually stopped moving and remained standing. Although he wasn’t able to knock it down, he was excited that he could finally hit the target after countless attempts.</p>
<p>“Dad!”</p>
<p>Tae-jun smiled and hugged his son. Jihoo jumped into his arms like a koala and rubbed his nose against his cheek.</p>
<p>“When did you come? Mom told me that you’re coming tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun had been the United States on a business trip after receiving a report that the new drug had passed the first clinical test. Although there was a lot of work to be done, he had shortened his schedule to move up his return to Korea.</p>
<p>“I came early because I missed you and mom. Where’s your mom?” Tae-jun said.</p>
<p>“She’s painting in the art studio.”</p>
<p>“Can I borrow that?”</p>
<p>He took the model gun in Jihoo’s hand and aimed at the can. When the bullet perfectly hit the center of gravity, the can fell.</p>
<p>The boy applauded. “My dad’s the best!”</p>
<p>“Just like that. It’s not just about hitting. If you want to knock it down, you have to aim for a lower center of gravity.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun patted him on the head. Jihoo had grown so tall that his father could no longer hold him with one hand. He noticed that the boy had grown slightly taller when he was away on a business trip although he was away for only a few days. He turned seven this year and was taller compared to other kids his age thanks to the genes of his tall parents. President Seo was a little sad seeing him grow up so fast day by day.</p>
<p>As he put Jihoo down from his arms with mixed emotions, he realized he was holding the model gun in his hand. Considering that it was quite heavy and elaborately crafted, it must be an expensive model.</p>
<p>“Jihoo, did you get permission from your mom to use this?”</p>
<p>Jihoo didn’t answer right away and mumbled.</p>
<p>“Where did you get this?”</p>
<p>Yuri didn’t like Jihoo playing with weapon toys such as guns and swords. She never bought them, and even if someone gave him as a gift, she would keep them out of his reach.</p>
<p><em>But where did he get this from?</em> Tae-jun mumbled in a serious tone, as he lowered his body to face his son.</p>
<p>“Please be honest. I don’t like people who lie.”</p>
<p>“…Yoon-seo and Yoon-jae gave it to me.”</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“When I visited their house yesterday.”</p>
<p>Yoon-seo and Yoon-jae were the twin sons of Jae-won, two years older than Jihoo. Jae-won and Tae-jun lived in the same neighborhood, so they’d come over to each other’s houses often. Jihoo, who had no siblings, got along with the twins. Tae-iun was planning to teach shooting to the twins sooner or later.</p>
<p>He spoke as he gave the model gun to his son, “Give it back to them before your mom sees it.”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>A kid who would normally say yes right away was only fiddling with the model gun without saying anything.</p>
<p>“Jihoo Seo.” Tae-jun called his son in a low voice.</p>
