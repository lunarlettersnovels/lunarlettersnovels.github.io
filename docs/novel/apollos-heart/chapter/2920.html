            <p><strong>Chapter 84</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps it was her grogginess or something else, Tae-jun didn’t pursue the matter. He let her be.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Have you had dinner yet?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No.” She replied, still struggling to open her eyes.</p>
<p>“We’ll eat first.”</p>
<p>By the time dinner was served, Yuri was wide awake. She was contemplating when and how to broach the taboo topic plaguing her at the moment.</p>
<p>Yuri waited until Tae-jun put down his spoon before she started talking. “May I ask you a favor?”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Tae-jun looked surprised. She had never asked him for a favor. In fact, she had hardly ever asked him for anything. “What is it? Is there something you want to buy?”</p>
<p>Yuri was startled at how he was immediately about to call Manager Choi to give her a credit card.</p>
<p>“It’s not that … I want to visit America.” She spoke hurriedly.</p>
<p>“America? The States?” Tae-jun’s face immediately hardened. This wasn’t something he had expected.</p>
<p>However, Yuri calmly proceeded to say the things she’d memorized. “I told you that I was thinking about going back to school. Well, I want to discuss things with my uncle. He’s always worried about me. I need to talk to the agency manager about the period remaining in my contract too.”</p>
<p>“You can’t do that in Korea?” He was obviously annoyed. He was not about to let her out of his sight.</p>
<p>Fearing things will go south before even she had a chance at it, she persuaded him as desperately as she could. “I need to get a refill from my pharmacy too. I’ll be back as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun fixed his eyes on the girl for a while. The cry of plea in her voice and eyes were hard to miss. After a moment, he reluctantly nodded. He must have been persuaded by her mentioning her refill.</p>
<p>“How long would it take you?”</p>
<p>“About ten days.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s too long. I’ll give you a week,” he said flatly.</p>
<p>“I’ll waste two days already at the airport and on the plane. How would I possibly come back in a week-”</p>
<p>“No? Then forget about it.”</p>
<p>There was no room for negotiation, she had to concede. “Fine, a week.”</p>
<p>“Under one condition.”</p>
<p>“Which is?” She looked at him with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I want you to get an examination at Seoin Hospital after you come back from America.”</p>
<p>“I already got a check-up in America. My body’s fine.” She argued.</p>
<p>“I get to decide that. So what are you going to do about it?” His gimlet eyes pierced her, making his intention loud and clear. He didn’t care about her opinion, in fact, he wasn’t asking for one. It was all of it or nothing.</p>
<p>Yuri knew better than anyone how obstinate he could be. If he took things up as a challenge, it would be even worse. She simply sighed, resignedly. “Fine, I’ll get an examination. Are you happy?”</p>
<p>“Manager Choi’s going with you.” He declared.</p>
<p>“Manager Choi?!” She was taken aback now.</p>
<p>“She’s a great help while abroad, speaks three languages, so you would have nothing to worry about. Or do you want Assistant Jung to go instead?”</p>
<p>Apparently, she was not going to go alone, so it was better for Manager Choi to follow her than Assistant Jung. She was comfortable with this woman. Yuri agreed and just when she thought this was the end of the conditions, the man spoke again.</p>
<p>“You will call me from there. Morning and night, twice a day.”</p>
<p><em>How many conditions were there? And a phone call twice a day? It’s not like she was a prisoner that just got released. He has Manager Choi to watch her every move! </em>Her mind was screaming at the man’s unreasonable demands. She was a little irritated now.</p>
<p>“Manager Choi will report everything to you anyways. Why do I need to call you?” Her tone was full of displeasure. But his next words were totally unexpected.</p>
<p>“You think you and Choi are the same?”</p>
<p>“…” She was silent for a brief moment. “Okay. I’ll call you.”</p>
<p>This was characteristic of Tae-jun Seo. The guy would always come up with things that were impossible to rebut, the other party would have no choice but to toe the line. In fact, even if they did have a rejoinder, they would not dare to speak up knowing just how dangerous this person was. This way, he would always have his way no matter what.</p>
<p>To be honest, she was tired of it. But there was nothing that she could do about it. she just shook her head and rose from her seat, about to leave but Tae-jun grabbed her arm. There couldn’t be something else he wanted to add. She worriedly looked at him.</p>
<p>Tae-jun grinned. “We need to have a week worth of s*x right now.” He scooped her in his arms and walked towards their bedroom.</p>
<p>It was just as she expected.</p>
