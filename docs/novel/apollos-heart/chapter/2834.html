            <p><strong>Chapter 171 – Side Story (2)</strong></p>
<p>Jin-wook asked while Yuri was checking Tae-jun’s name on the screen, “Do you know the rules of the game? Do you want me to explain?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I searched up on the internet and learned about it briefly. I heard that it’s a game where you hit a target called a clay pigeon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. It’s a game where one needs to shoot pigeons that are released according to a signal from the trap house installed over there. A trap with one target, a double trap with two targets, and a skeet when they come from both sides. Six players stand on five stations and move the stations by pushing one another to hit pigeons, and 25 pigeons are released in one round. Five rounds are held in the preliminary round, and the top six players make it to the final. Normally, one can fire up to two shots in the preliminary rounds, but only one shot in the final.”</p>
<p>“It’s a game that I’ve never heard of.”</p>
<p>“Yes. In Korea, clay shooting is not as well known as indoor shooting. In fact, many people enjoy clay shooting as a hobby, but there aren’t many professional, elite athletes. Due to the special training environment, gun, and ammunition, the training costs a lot. Even with support from the associations and federations, it’s difficult to develop players. After graduating from secondary school, the president hired a personal coach in England and trained.”</p>
<p>He handed her an ear protector.  “Plug this into your ears before entering the stadium. The sound will be much louder than you think.”</p>
<p>“Okay, thank you.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, the referees entered the stadium followed by the players. Tae-jun, wearing a black training suit and red goggles, stood out among the players. At his appearance, the spectators became loud. Throughout the introduction of the finalists one by one, Yuri couldn’t take her eyes off of her husband. Come to think of it, she forgot that a man named Tae-jun Seo was born to be a wild wolf because ever since their marriage, he behaved like a very obedient big dog.</p>
<p>After checking the presence of Yuri and Jin-wook in the audience, Tae-jun entered the designated station with the other players. Yuri put on the protector that Jin-wook gave her. When the player standing on Station 1 gave a short signal, a pigeon came out, signaling the start of the game. Tae-jun hit his first target safely on the 4th station. Yuri moved her seat and fixed her gaze on her man, who was loading bullets. Every time he hit a pigeon, her heart raced.</p>
<p><em>How should I express this? Should I say that I fell in love with my husband again?</em></p>
<p>The game was tight in the beginning, but after ten rounds, the gap started to widen little by little. Player No.2, who took the lead, was a player from the Seoin Industrial team. Tae-Jun and Player No. 1 chased him by a small difference.</p>
<p>Twenty-second shot. In the current situation where Player No. 2 and No. 1 missed the target, if Tae-jun managed to hit the target, then he’d be the player with the highest score with Player No. 2. The moment his bullet hit the pigeon, Yuri spontaneously got up and clapped.</p>
<p><em>‘Bidan, your father is amazing.’</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt a small kick in her stomach as if in response. It was a soft and warm touch, like air bubbles rising.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>When Yuri wrapped her belly in surprise, Jin-wook, who was next to her, stood up right away. He thought it was an emergency.</p>
<p>Yuri quickly grabbed his sleeve and shook her head. “It’s quickening.”</p>
<p>It was a word that he could clearly understand even if he couldn’t hear the sound because of the protector.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>After the game, Tae-jun passed Jin-wook his equipment. He decided to spend the night at T city’s hotel suite with Yuri. He thought that the five-hour round trip would be too tough for her.</p>
<p>“It was so close. If you hit all three, you could’ve won.”</p>
<p>Yuri spoke to him while lying in bed. Tae-jun, who has been massaging her calf, which had been swelling frequently lately, grinned.</p>
<p>“All I had to do was be present during the game.”</p>
<p>“But it’s been a long time since you last participated. It would’ve been nice if you won.”</p>
<p>“I already won enough in the past. What’s more important to me is you and Bidan. If something happened to one of you, I would’ve just left the game.”</p>
<p>Jin-wook immediately sent a signal that there was no problem, but his concentration was already distorted so he couldn’t hit the target. Tae-jun missed all the last three shots, but he didn’t seem to regret it. Rather, he looked happy that Bidan moved. Unfortunately, he has not yet felt the quickening of his son. His hand, which had been stroking his wife’s belly for a long time, moved down.</p>
<p>Yuri glimpsed at the hand that was moving with a clear purpose.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you tired? You must be tired from the game….”</p>
<p>“But it’s hard to control.”</p>
<p>“We did it last week.”</p>
<p>Although, not as often as before pregnancy, after entering the stable stage, they made love at least once a week. Still, it seemed like it wasn’t enough for him.</p>
<p>Tae-jun whispered while putting his lips to her ear, “I love you like crazy.”</p>
<p>“Do you still love me the same?”</p>
<p>“I will forever.”</p>
<p><em>‘Who would not fall for a guy who talks like that?’</em> Yuri nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Then do it gently. Don’t surprise Bidan. Okay?”</p>
<p>“I know. I think he’s asleep anyway.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun put his hand on her belly as he kissed but then suddenly stopped moving. He felt a small, light movement with his hand. Just like Yuri had at the stadium, he couldn’t conceal his surprise.</p>
<p>Seeing his face, she said teasingly, “What should we do? Bidan says he’s not sleeping.”</p>
<p>“He’s already an unfilial son.”</p>
<p>Yuri couldn’t help but burst into laughter at his disappointed tone. It was a happy night.</p>
