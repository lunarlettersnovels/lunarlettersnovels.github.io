            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 57</strong></p>
<p>Tae-jun pressed his lips onto her ear and placed another finger inside her. His fingers filled her to the extent her stomach felt tight, she squeezed her toes to endure the sensations. However, when Tae-jun’s fingers touched her cl!toris with force as if to claw her walls, her body jumped, and an explosive sound made by water rang loudly in the bathroom.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah!”</p>
<p>Yuri’s eyes filled, and her vision blurred. Something flowed from her as Tae-jun took his fingers out.</p>
<p>“I seemed to have made a mistake. This is not mine.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun put his finger in Yuri’s shaking mouth that was gasping for breath. The thick liquid that mixed with her t0ngue was definitely not ‘his’. He rolled his fingers in her mouth until she finished sucking them.</p>
<p>He then roughly kissed her–his tongue wrestled with hers until she felt she was about to faint. She couldn’t take it any longer and tapped his chest. Tae-jun reluctantly let go of her lips and made Yuri hold his p*nis in her hand.</p>
<p>“Spread out and place it in.”</p>
<p>This was the first time Tae-jun made such a request. Yuri tried to remove her hand with a shake of her head, but he did not allow her to let go.</p>
<p>“If you do it well, I’ll end after once.”</p>
<p>Yuri had no other choice as Tae-jun had been too much for her when she was healthy. Then, of course, having s3x with him in her current state would be near impossible, and Tae-jun had to know her present condition to make such a demand.</p>
<p>Yuri carefully slid on her body and adjusted her position. However, she began to hesitate when faced with putting his pen!s in because it was so big and vicious.</p>
<p><em>Would this go inside her?</em></p>
<p>She could not believe that this man had been inside her before, and even last night seemed to be a dream.</p>
<p>Tae-jun pressed with the head of his p*nis, and Yuri felt his liquid ooze. She closed her eyes tightly and lowered her hips.</p>
<p>With a groan, Yuri felt her body spread out. It was already difficult for her to move only halfway in, and when she tried to pull out, Tae-jun became impatient and roughly pushed inside her.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Yuri let out a shout as she jerked her hips –Tae-jun was fully inside her. She sat on his thighs, her brows furrowed as she felt the flaming shaft penetrate her. It was a size she could not manage no matter how many times he had been inside her, and with her added weight, the pressure was immense.</p>
<p>Being inside her seemed to be not enough for Tae-jun, and he pulled her into his arms. Yuri could feel his rapid heartbeat as her chest pressed his.</p>
<p>‘This is strange.’</p>
<p>Yuri stared up at Tae-jun and wondered if this was the heartbeat of the man who was tormenting her without a change in his expression. It might be an illusion, but Tae-jun’s face seemed to be more flushed than usual. Tae-jun opened his mouth as he pushed back Yuri’s wet hair.</p>
<p>“Move.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to end this quickly?” He grabbed her bottom with a languid expression and slowly moved his hips to find her weakest spots.</p>
<p>Yuri awkwardly moved her hips, recollecting the past pleasures a little by little. She had welcomed him in this position, and when he hit a particular spot, she felt a low and steady sensation.</p>
<p>She began to move up and down when she felt they were connected, and the water overflowed whenever she moved. While her simple actions were not enough for Tae-jun, her swinging up and down in front of him was an exquisite sight.</p>
<p>Tae-jun observed her… wet and writhing, and bit her br*ast. When he sucked at her n*pple, the contractions her inner walls made ar0used him.</p>
<p>Tae-jun teased her mercilessly.</p>
<p>“Like this, we would do this all day.”</p>
<p>Yuri frowned and moved more quickly. She went up until she was almost separated from him before she crouched back. While she was trying her best, her strength ran out quicker than the speed with pleasure mounted her. She buried her face in his shoulder and sighed after moving like that a few times.</p>
<p>Tae-jun began to move when he saw Yuri was near her limit. He grabbed her hips and bounced his own, her entire body shook from his thrusts. She instinctively bent her back and jerked her head.</p>
<p>Sweet moans escaped from her mouth, and the sounds reverberated much more loudly in the bathroom. The sound of splashing water rang everywhere, and the light from the window was heady. Yuri’s head span when she realized that she was being ravished in this bright room, making those noises.</p>
<p>She hung onto his shoulders, her nails clawing into his flesh. While she was trying to stop his violent movements, she only ar0used him further. He roughly forced her to sit on his lap, she felt she would melt whenever his erect!on pierced and stirred in her. Whenever he moved, hot water would splatter from where they were connected. She could feel his sharp breath next to her ears.</p>
<p>With a shout, Yuri felt her vision go white and shivers down her spine. Tae-jun stopped moving and groaned in a low voice. She could feel hot c*m beating inside her. Her inner walls instinctively contracted not to let a drop go, but some of the c*m that she could not hold fell into the water despite her body’s efforts.</p>
