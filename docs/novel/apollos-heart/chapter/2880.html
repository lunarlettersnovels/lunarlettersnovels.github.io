            <p><strong>Chapter 125 – She Is Gone (3)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Yuri had a place to go with me. She could never have moved alone!</strong></em></p>
<p>Jae-won had reassured Roy Jean, who seemed like he was going to run to the police station at any moment. Once he had placated the tensed man, he had returned home.</p>
<p>Right now, he was sitting on the sofa, staring fixedly at this cell phone. Upon the news that his grandfather had collapsed, his mother had left in a trice to her maternal home. Despite this, there had no special call from Tae-jun.</p>
<p><em>Was Yuri Han found?</em> Given the ongoing situation, it seemed that his grandfather was not a part of the picture. <em>Then who and for what? One thing is certain, the individual must have been familiar with the location of the villa and the alarm system inside.</em></p>
<p>Tae-jun would need to check the CCTV for more details but a rough hypothesis could be built on the fact that there was an injured cat mewling outside. The intruder had disturbed the alarm system by placing an injured and immobile cat near a window sill or a sensor. When the alarm went off, a surprised Yuri would have looked out, and the cat would have entered her vision. The little creature, crying from injuries, would have been enough to arouse sympathy and compassion. And the moment she opened the door would have been the moment the ambush began.</p>
<p>While awaiting Tae-jun’s call with anxiety, the cell phone rang. Jae-won hurriedly pressed the answer button and raised his voice.</p>
<p>“How did it go? Did you find her?”</p>
<p>– “Hey, Director Lee?”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the person on the phone wasn’t Tae-jun. Jae-won urgently checked the caller’s id. <em>Si-yeon Yoon. What the hell!</em> <em>Why is a male voice coming out of her number?</em></p>
<p>Jae-won replied with a curt voice. “Who is this?”</p>
<p>– “This is the bartender at Y bar. Director Yoon is drunk right now. I was trying to contact her secretary, but she is adamant in asking for you—”</p>
<p>Jae-won frowned and sighed. <em>What kind of life are you living? When you are drunk and can’t take care of yourself, you are looking for me?</em></p>
<p>“Okay. Will be there soon.”</p>
<p>– “Thank you, Director.”</p>
<p>Jae-won put on his jacket after finishing the call. Although Yuri was on his mind, now Si-yeon was the priority. When he was leaving through the front door with his car key, he ran into his mother who was on her way back. He asked her a question as she came in with a tired face.</p>
<p>“Are you back? How is Grandfather?”</p>
<p>“He’s conscious but hardly speaks. I asked Secretary Kang and he said <em><strong>he</strong></em> knew everything about the past. You didn’t say anything, did you?”</p>
<p>The aforementioned <em><strong>he</strong></em> was Tae-jun of course.</p>
<p>Jae-won hurriedly made his name clear. “I didn’t. Aunt must have told him.”</p>
<p>“What? Your aunt? Tae-jun met his mother?” Mrs. Lee was shocked.</p>
<p>Jaewon did not know what was going on in his cousin’s mind. While he had tried to warn Tae-jun about their grandfather regarding Yuri, the man had already known everything that had happened in the past … about his parents, the woman … just about everything that had disrupted his peaceful life. That was also why he had entrusted Yuri to Jaewon.</p>
<p>“He threatened his grandfather that he wouldn’t let the same thing happen again. He even brought a gun.” Mrs. Lee had yet to recover from the shocking events of the day.</p>
<p><em>Oh my God!</em> Jaewon unknowingly opened his mouth. Even if he had not seen what had happened, he knew something drastic must have happened. And it was as such. But, he didn’t expect any better from his obstinate cousin.</p>
<p>“If Tae-jun said it, it wouldn’t be just a threat,” Jae-won remarked.</p>
<p>“I suppose so. It’s in his character. By the way, where are you going at this time?” Jung-hee Seo* was touching her forehead when she asked her son who was all dressed to go out at a late hour.</p>
<p>[Jung-hee Seo is Jae-won’s mother’s maiden name. She’s Tae-jun’s father’s sister.]</p>
<p>“I’m going to see someone.” He vaguely answered.</p>
<p>“Who? On a day like today … is it Si-yeon?”</p>
<p>Jung-hee Seo, who was quick-witted, knew exactly who her son was going to meet. Jae-won was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>“I told you not to meet her. There’s nothing to benefit from you seeing her right now.”</p>
<p>“I never said that I would keep seeing her. In the first place, I wasn’t even meeting with Si-yeon to benefit myself.”</p>
<p>“Jae-won!”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I also owe Si-yeon. Even though I knew about Tae-jun’s woman, I kept my mouth shut because I was thinking about family interests rather than friendship. I will take care of my actions.”</p>
