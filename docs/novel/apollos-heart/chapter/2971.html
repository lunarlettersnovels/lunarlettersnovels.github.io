        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 33</b></p>
<p><b>Bang!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullet pierced through the moving target.</span></p>
<p><b>Bang! Bang!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A barrage of bullets continuously hit the bull’s eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man deftly reloaded his shotgun after he hit the last target. He’d lost track of time, soon his shirt under the bulletproof vest was soaked in sweat.</span></p>
<p><b><i>You, what if you find Yuri Han?</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His ears were covered with ear protectors, blocking all sounds, even that of his own heartbeat. And yet, Hye-seong’s words resonated, drumming his senses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was determined to find Yuri ever since he’d seen her in the hotel lobby, not once had he considered what he would do after. Well, at the moment he was oblivious to this subterfuge. But now, things were different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As regards the question, first, he’s going to ask why she lied to him, why she left, and…</span></p>
<p><b><i>No one has deceived you like she did. Don’t you think so?</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right, Yuri will pay the price.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he’s changing his heated-up gun barrel, Jin-wook took the opportunity to pass him a bottle of water. It didn’t escape his sharp eyes, that the other was drenched in sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You haven’t lost your touch. You are still as good as active athletes.” He admired this man’s skills whole-heartedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shooting, as a sport form, has a range of sub-disciplines; trapshooting being one of them. Here, one is required to shoot saucer-shaped clay targets flung into the air from a spring device called trap. Needless to say, this demands dynamic visual acuity and exceptional focus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun was nineteen when he won gold for trapshooting in the Asian Games. As such, the majority of his youth had been spent as a part of the Junior National Team, but the Asian Games was the swansong of his career as an athlete. His grandfather did not want Tae-jun catching the public eye anymore, nor did Tae-jun. However, to retain his firearms license, he maintained his athlete qualification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun took off his protection glasses while he downed the water. Both men stood in silence for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about Hye-seong Jin?” Tae-jun gazed into the distance as he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I put him in Dr. Yang’s clinic, nice and neat.” Jin-wook replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a day had passed. For Tae-jun, time seemed to be dragging, there was nothing he could except endure. But it was proving to be hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laying his gun on the table, Tae-jun drew out a cigarette. As he lit it, his phone rang. It was Jay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “Hello!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you find her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “Wow! Do you know how many Koreans live in New York City?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Call me when you find her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Wait, wait! You need to let me finish. I did… I found her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Go on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay held back for a second before resuming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “Let me ask you something first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “Thz girl that you’re looking for, is she the one from 5 years ago? The one who related to the Jinseong hotel?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voice on the phone had suddenly abandoned its playfulness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “You are insane!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay’s firm voice brought a frown to Tae-jun’s face. He ran his fingers through his hair, starting to get impatient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Answer my questions now. Did you find out anything about Yuri Han?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– As of now, she lives in the East Village. She’s not married and lives with her uncle. Oh, by the way, her uncle is quite big in the Korean Community here. He runs two big restaurants. Her aunt is from here and is a well-known Human Rights Lawyer. They seem like a power couple.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What does Yuri do for a living?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – “She is an artist affiliated with an agency. Heard she works for a famous artist as well. But that’s not important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Jay lowered his voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “Um… There’s a rumor about her, and it’s not nice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “People say that she has mental problems. She’s attempted suicide a few times already.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri tried to take her own life!</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She even has psychological problems?!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun’s heart thumped frantically, his eyes betrayed his anxiety albeit for a moment, while his mind raced to make sense of this information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed to be living a nice life in the Big Apple. She had a family, her uncle seemed like a nice man for he took her in. She’s talented with a stable job and a bright future. The way he saw it, there should be no reason to attempt suicide. [1] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you know why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Nobody knows why except for the doctors. Her psychiatrist is an authority in the PTSD field.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun took a deep drag of his cigarette, trying to calm his nerves. His next words fell flatly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to see her records.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay was first baffled then stunned. He just couldn’t believe his ears! </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did that guy actually ask what I think he asked?!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He replied in a monotonous tone, like perfunctorily reading out the rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “Unfortunately, only doctors have access to patient’s medical charts. Medical law in the US is ironbound. Plus, the clinic she goes to is noted for their patients’ privacy protection. “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun sneered and spoke with sarcasm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And since when did you become a law-abiding citizen? I know you can do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “Oops, I didn’t know I had your trust! I should live up to it, right? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to know why she’s getting counseling and stuff?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay was back to his peppy self. It’s not that he wouldn’t have scooped the information otherwise, but hearing this callous demon’s ‘not even a once in a blue moon compliment’ had its own charms!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want more information and details about the people around her. I also want something critical and solid that can put them in trouble, if needed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– “Hey, ain’t that my specialty!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giggling, Jay hung up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the telephonic conversation, Jin-wook had kept silent, listening attentively. By the time it came to an end, his wooden face had turned grim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you really planning to go that far?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d been associated with Tae-jun long enough to glean his thoughts without being explicitly mentioned. What’s more, he knew, first hand, of his obsession over the woman in question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If needed, yes.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, if needed.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun was ready to give his everything if he could get Yuri back. She, who he’d presumed dead for four long years, who had been the focal point of his every waking and non-waking hours, his heart and senses, was miraculously back… like he’d been given a second chance… Once he won her back, he’d never let her go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, Tae-jun understood the implicit meaning in Jin-wook’s words. He didn’t want him to follow Myung-je Jin’s suit. He knew how it would end and it’s better to steer clear while they could still.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for Tae-jun, it didn’t matter what path he took. There was nothing right or wrong, good or evil. Yuri was the only thing that mattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glowering at the target, as if it were the obstacle between him and her, he reloaded his gun. Time was ticking… it was so close.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll know what I’ll do when you are mine again.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Bang!</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
