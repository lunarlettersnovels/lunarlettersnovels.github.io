            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 61</strong></p>
<p>Yuri continued to m0an as he used his tongue inside her. She put a hand to her mouth as she gaped at the strange sounds she had just made. Tae-jun’s tongue flicked in and out and licked the outer rims before wrapping her cl*toris. She felt faint at the heat that surrounded her sensitive areas, juices continued to flow out of her body.</p>
<p>Tae-jun moved his neck making deliberate sucking noises, her small opening flared whenever he did so. He removed his lips with some satisfaction once he’d finished the preparations.</p>
<p>With a warning, he grabbed her hips and pushed in his pen*s at once. A burning stake seemed to fill her stomach. She screamed as his pubic hair was pressed on to her bottom. It was always difficult for her at the beginning, no matter how wet she was.</p>
<p>Tae-jun put one arm around her and the other on her flat stomach to raise her lower body. They were positioned like animals in heat. Yuri shuddered as she felt even more deeply penetrated. However, she could not move an inch from the pressure that came behind her. She buried her face in the bedsheets and swallowed her moans. However, the man knew exactly what to do to please her.</p>
<p>Yuri jerked her hips instinctively whenever he pressed a certain spot, he also felt his limits as he saw her respond to his movements. His nerves were on the edge as her hold on him tightened with each thrust, with that Tae-jun began to roll his hips.</p>
<p>As his chest covered her back, her slim body was fully shielded by his. Her muscles contracted when he bit on the neckline partly revealed through the veil formed by her hair. He pushed his hips forward as the sounds of rough breathing, sheets sliding, and flesh meeting flesh rang in his ears.</p>
<p>Yuri cried and reached her cl*max, and Tae-jun also came deep inside her. He growled a low groan as he leaned back. Her hold tightened over him again as he moved, he buried his face on her quivering neck… taking deep breaths in and out.</p>
<p>“Stop doing that since you can’t endure anymore.”</p>
<p>Yuri only blinked vaguely as if she had not enough strength to answer. He took off the rest of her clothes, her eyelid lowered as she allowed him to do what he wished.</p>
<p>She did not move a muscle even after Tae-jun had finished his shower. He went out of the balcony in front of the bedroom and lit a cigarette. The cold night air was pleasing to his still flushed body.</p>
<p>Tae-jun watched Yuri sleep as he leaned on the balcony railing. She was still too weak to satisfy his desires fully. Nonetheless, he felt deep satisfaction as he saw her wreathed in the marks he had left on her fair skin. When he thought of his seed inside her, he was even more exhilarated. The fact she was with him in his space made him happy.</p>
<p><em>Yuri was </em><em><strong>his</strong></em><em> woman, the one who would be forever his and bear his child…</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Scream!</strong></em></p>
<p>His musings were shattered by a piercing shriek in the quiet night. Taken aback he dropped the cigarette he held. When he looked towards the source, he saw Yuri push herself up with her hands clutching her head.</p>
<p>“Yuri!”</p>
<p>She was sleeping only a short while ago. But now, her pale face tinged with blue didn’t seem normal. Yuri flew into the bathroom faster than Tae-jun could hold her and threw up violently right after she found the toilet.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? What happened?”</p>
<p>Tae-jun rubbed her back as she retched everything she had eaten. She was so thin that he could feel each disk of her spine. He watched as she shuddered, sweated profusely, and gasped for breath. He grabbed a bathrobe and placing it on her back continued sliding his hand up and down.</p>
<p>It was a while before Yuri was able to speak.</p>
<p>“My head hurts so much,” she said with great effort, “Please… bring the pills in the car.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun remembered the pillbox he’s tossed in the backseat because they seemed too toxic.</p>
<p>“Wait! Can you do that?”</p>
<p>Yuri nodded as she sat limply on the ground when the final grain of strength had betrayed her. She threw her head to the back and closed her eyes, her deeply furrowed brows bore testimony to the writhing pain she was in.</p>
<p>Tae-jun rushed to the basement parking lot in his bathrobe. The pillbox was right where he’d thrown it in the backseat. Yuri’s condition seemed far more severe than he had imagined. In hindsight, he regretted not heeding to Jin-ho’s advice of a thorough medical examination on the day they met. He felt anger at having ravaged a woman who repeatedly fainted in his arms.</p>
<p>When he dashed back with pills and water, an exhausted Yuri had slumped to the bathroom floor. If he didn’t know better, one would think she’s dead at the sight of her ashen face. Tae-jun shook her awake and handed her the pillbox.</p>
<p>“Take them, and we’ll go to the hospital.”</p>
<p>Yuri shook her head weakly and swallowed the pills.</p>
<p>“This happens sometimes.” She mumbled.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Yuri simply closed her eyes as an answer.</p>
<p>“I said, what is it!”</p>
<p>Yuri frowned as Tae-jun held her shoulders and rattled her. She wanted some quiet, she didn’t want to speak… this man, would he let her be in peace!</p>
<p>“It’s not a disease. This happens whenever a memory turns up.” She muttered between her laborious breaths.</p>
<p>“What did you remember?” He demanded.</p>
<p>Yuri closed her lips tightly.</p>
<p>“Let me rest.” She was losing it. Her eyes were white, lips trembling…</p>
<p>Tae-jun gave up trying to talk to her and just held her in his arms. He then carefully laid her on the bed and covered her with a quilt. It was only then, that her expression eased albeit slightly. He stretched out next to her and rested her head on his arm.</p>
<p>The woman fell asleep again from the sedatives in her pills, and her pale face looked even more like a corpse.</p>
<p>“If you won’t speak, I’ll have to find out by myself.” Tae-jun murmured with his lips on her forehead.</p>
<p>Yuri burrowed into his arms as if she were cold, breathing heavily.</p>
