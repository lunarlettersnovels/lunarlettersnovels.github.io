            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 58</strong></p>
<p>The air reeked of the scent of c@rnal pleasures, the walls still resonated with the cries of intense passion. Two still bodies lay entwined basking in the afterglow.</p>
<p>Eyes closed, Tae-jun enjoyed the lingering sensations. He had lost count of the women he had, their faces a blank, names long forgotten. And the pleasures they brought… none could compare to the woman in his arms right now. The more he indulged in her since their reunion, the truth behind his four years of celibacy became jarringly clear: no Yuri, no pleasure.</p>
<p>Breathing still ragged, he pressed his lips on the top of her head, then her brow. He held her tightly as if doing so would merge them into one, leaving no gaps whatsoever. His heart was still beating frantically but with a sense of calm that had abandoned him for four years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yuri limply leaned in his embrace; shallow breathing, closed eyes that were masking her haziness, pallid face, and body wet like cotton, queasy insides… there was little doubt that the s**ual escapade in the narrow bathtub had sent her into overdrive.</p>
<p>Her present condition didn’t escape the culprit’s notice, his brows furrowed. Taking a deep breath, he reluctantly extricated himself from her core. At the sight of the swiftly oozing c*m, his subdued fire, once again, started to rage… he wanted to thrust himself into her yet another time, ravage her without an end. And yet, giving in to the beast within would only wither the fragile flower.</p>
<p>Tae-jun stood up while carefully holding her in his arms. He gently helped her stand in the shower booth. So slack, she could not move a finger. She just let him do as he wished, taking the support of his taut body.</p>
<p>His large hands meticulously cleansed her body down, her eyes closed when the hands gently massaged her head. She let go of herself.</p>
<p>A memory that she knew not before suddenly resurfaced. She remembered it was the first time she did not feel a shooting pain.</p>
<p><em>It was like this then.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>On the last day they had spent together four years ago, Tae-jun had brought an exhausted Yuri and washed her himself.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Think about it.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>His low voice had rung in her ears. It was a sweet and gentle voice of a man who was caressing her. His tone then had made her believe that he really wanted her.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“I’ll expect an answer on the day I return.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em>What was the question, and what would have been her answer?</em></p>
<p>Yuri’s eyes met Tae-jun’s as she opened them, his gaze was not that of a man who was tormenting her. He kissed her palm as if she was the most valuable treasure in this world.</p>
<p><em>Was this her memory or reality?</em></p>
<p>She could feel his hot breath, and their lips met this time. It was a kiss that seemed to console her swollen lips from the night they spent together and was the gentlest one she had ever received from him.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>Although Tae-jun kept his promise that he would release only once, he still made her give a bl*wjob. His erect*on writhed like it was alive and splattered liquid over her hand and chest.</p>
<p>Yuri was lying on the bed when Tae-jun came in with a shopping bag in hand.</p>
<p>“Wake up and change. We have somewhere to go to,” he said.</p>
<p>“What about my clothes?” she asked as she started to get up with the help of her hand.</p>
<p>“They’re ruined.” Came the flat reply.</p>
<p>At that, she finally remembered her torn blouse. She didn’t jog that memory of her ripped clothing strewn the room over and quickly reached out for the bag.</p>
<p>She opened it with a sigh only to find an expensive designer suit complete with shoes and undergarments. She had to wonder when he had prepared all this since even the size was perfect.</p>
<p>Once she was dressed and ready, she asked where they were going.</p>
<p>“A house.”</p>
<p>“House? What house?” Yuri asked since she could not understand the meaning of the word.</p>
<p>Then suddenly something struck her. “You can’t mean your own house…” she said tentatively.</p>
<p>Tae-jun smirked. “The house we lived in together. Have you forgotten that? I asked the hotel you’re staying at to check out and send the luggage there, so don’t worry about that.”</p>
<p>Yuri frowned at his nonchalant reply. The implication of ‘our house’ surprised her more than the fact that he had gotten the hotel she was staying to check out and send her luggage.</p>
<p>They had stayed together in a townhouse on the outskirts of the city. It was a large two-storey building with a basement. Tae-jun had allowed Yuri to use the basement as her workspace where she spent most of her time, that is in his absence. Her daily routine involved watching films on cable, studying English, drawing, and making models except when Tae-jun was home.</p>
<p>“That house… is still yours?” she asked softly.</p>
<p>“Yes. I didn’t sell it for no special reason. It’s not the only house I own after all, and there’s a caretaker,” he said tersely before adding, “I didn’t know that I’ll be returning there with you, though.”</p>
<p>Yuri blinked at him and said no more. Suddenly, she felt a headache coming. She took out a medicine box from her bag. Since the pill also comprised sedatives, she felt her body would escape her control if she were to take it now. But her head was splitting and she knew it would only worsen without the aid of the medicine.</p>
<p>“What is that pill?” Tae-jun asked as he watched her take the pill.</p>
<p>“It’s for headaches since I have migraines.” She answered.</p>
<p>This headache was a part of her transient global amnesia, among other things of course. She had started with mild ones before landing on this high-quality drug with drowsiness as the side effect.</p>
<p>“You’re taking too much for only a headache.” He noticed she took more than just one pill.</p>
<p>“I also took some vitamins with it.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun did not speak further. Soon the effects of the medicine kicked in and Yuri started to drowse after only a few minutes in the car. In no time, she was fast asleep.</p>
<p>Tae-jun muttered in a low voice as he continued to drive. “Vitamins with sleep inducer and anesthetic components. How interesting.”</p>
