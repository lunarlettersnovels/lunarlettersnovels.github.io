            <p><strong>Chapter 120 – I Want You | 19 (2)</strong></p>
<p>Her cheeks were red when she said it, still so timidly shy in front of Tae-jun. She wrapped her arms around his neck and placed a tender kiss there. Tae-jun rubbed his length against her folds before pushing into her in one fluid movement.</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>Tae-jun was deep inside her core. She felt so full of him. He looked at her fluttering eyes, and kissed her right on the lips. “Feeling good?”</p>
<p>She nodded shakily, and wound her legs around his torso. “More.”</p>
<p>She would give herself to him without a second thought. The simplicity of her request ignited the beast inside of him as he went on a neck breaking pace, thrusting in and out of her like a piston. His hips moved against her continuously, groans emitting from his throat.</p>
<p>Yuri shivered at the onslaught of pleasure brimming all over her body. She could feel him so deep inside her as she moaned unashamedly loud.</p>
<p>“Oh, Oh!”</p>
<p>She felt the pool of heat simmering in her belly, and she’s about to reach her peak any second now. Tae-jun abruptly stopped his thrusts, making Yuri breathe in hitched breaths. “Ha— ha.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun exhaled as he adjusted his position, and pushed into her once again so strongly they reached their climax.</p>
<p>Yuri closed her eyes, completely swept away by the overwhelming ecstasy. Tae-jun situated his elbows on either side of her head, and stroked her hair gently. This was the first time he waited for Yuri, and it was worth it. He felt himself growing hard again, but he did not ask for more but a kiss on the lips. He held back because he respected her boundaries, pulling her into his chest instead.</p>
<p>They basked in their sweet embrace, Tae-jun stroking her back absentmindedly as Yuri spoke. “It would’ve been much nicer if we met some other way.”  She rubbed her cheek on his chest. It was something she wanted to say for a long time.</p>
<p>She had pictured it in her mind so many times, only if they could go back to the day they first met.</p>
<p>She continued, “You’d go to an exhibition where my artwork was displayed, and you’d ask for the artist while looking at my art. You’ll fall in love with me the moment you see me, then you’ll ask me out on a date.” Yuri chuckled, shaking her head slightly.  After a few seconds, her smiles died down as she let out a small sigh, and muttered silently. “Then none of this would have happened.”</p>
<p>Yuri buried her face into his chest, and spoke against his skin. “The day I ran away, I received a package, and I thought it was a gift from you. But once I saw what was inside, I instantly knew something was wrong.”</p>
<p>“It was a list of crimes committed by Jin and In-bae Lee.” Tae-jun said.</p>
<p>Yuri raised her head, her eyes wide as she stared at him. “How did you know?”</p>
<p>“I snooped around. A former employee of Hotel Jin-seong had the camera footage. The one with your father.”</p>
<p>“Can you show it to me?” Yuri asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you should watch it. It won’t do you any good.” Tae-jun said in a sure voice, tucking Yuri’s hair behind her ear.</p>
<p>Yuri gathered her thoughts. “Once I saw it, I knew in an instant that something had happened to my father. I knew what the documents meant, and they were sent to me on purpose. I tried to call my father when the Jin-seong police department called me. They said that there was an accident, and that I should confirm his identity. Before I went to the police station, I asked my uncle to come to Korea and hide the documents, just in case I needed to blackmail Jin. And when I was in front of the station.. I was kidnapped.”</p>
<p>At the word kidnap, Tae-jun’s eyebrows furrowed, his fists clenched the sheets tightly. Yuri went on, “When I woke up I was inside an old building. It seemed to me like Jin used to make drugs, but I don’t really remember if that was the case. At first, Jin tried to convince me to his side, but when I didn’t agree to it, he drugged me. I don’t have much memories of that day, so I only realized that I was addicted to drugs when I went back to America.”</p>
<p>Yuri said, her words tumbling one after the other as she let her words out. She started sweating upon remembering the traumatic event that changed her life. Her mind drifted back to the past, when the injection she’s not familiar with was shot into her veins, and the pain that followed soon after. It was a disturbing tale, and Tae-jun bit his lips red, trying to reign in his anger that was bubbling on the surface. He stroked Yuri’s face with his thumbs.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember anything much after that. I think I was hoping for a chance to ask help from Hye-yeon. She was the only person in Jin-seong who would be able to help me. This is what I’m sure of: Someone murdered Hye-yeon, and drowned her in the lake. And the person who planned my father and Hye-yeon’s death was none other than In-bae Lee.”</p>
