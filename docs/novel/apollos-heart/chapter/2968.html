            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 36</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Myung-je and Hye-seong abruptly arrived at the Hotel, Yuri greeted them at the reception in mild surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Jin,” she said, politely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where is Hye-yeon? Why are you here instead of her?” He demanded gruffly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, that is because, um… Hye-yeon is away for a moment…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t know what else to say, this was too sudden. Mr. Jin was supposed to be on a business trip, not in the lobby, and least of all looking for his truant daughter!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a moment? Then why are you in her uniform?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His piercing eyes seemed to look right through her, she was intimidated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Hye-seong noticed her uniform and name tag – ‘Hye-yeon Jin’. Right then, Tae-jun’s words surfaced in his mind.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Yes. At H University Art Hall’s opening ceremony. She is such a talented lady.</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">H University’s opening ceremony….</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One by one, the pieces started to fall in place. Yuri went to H university – Hye-seong recalled the day when he picked her up after school. She said she had an event to attend, and that day was possibly the day that Tae-jun referred to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-yeon and Yuri were so alike in height and silhouette. People often took them as sisters if not cousins. The girls hung out together too and were exceptionally close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the same thought flashed through Myung-je’s mind as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yuri,” he said, his stern gaze never once leaving her quivering face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, yes sir.” She managed to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have… you… by any chance… attended H University Art Hall’s opening ceremony?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I did. Even though I could not make it to the exhibition.” She replied honestly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something glinted in the father’s eyes, and the son clenched his fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I met someone who mistook you for Hye-yeon today. What happened?” Seeing how unsuspecting she was, he prodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri sighed, she knew which situation the president was referring to. She had no other choice but to be forthright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was a guest who’d left her belongings in the room, so I entered the room with a master key. However, the new guest checked in while I was in the room. He thought I was Hye-yeon, because of my name tag and I thought it was unnecessary to explain that I am not her. I am very sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a dead person, Myung-je’s face turned ghastly pale.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was this simple?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then, you met him at the opening ceremony?” Disbelief wreathed his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t expect to see him there. I didn’t correct him because I didn’t think I’d ever see him again. Did something happen because of this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a troubled face, Yuri looked at two men in front of her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did something happen? Yes, it did and it couldn’t be worse.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having learned all that there was, without a word Myung-je and Hye-seong headed back home in silence. They sat on the bar. This turn of events, mistaken identity… their situation… one by one it played before their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The silent Myung-je quickly downed a glass of whiskey to calm his nerves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father, we should give up on this plan. He’s mistaken Yuri for Hye-yeon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong tried to comfort his father, but Myung-je murmured riddling things after downing two more drinks. A few moments later, he pulled out his cellphone and made a call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get me everything about my driver’s daughter. Han.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong could not repress his shock. How could he not know what his sly father was up to?! He was trying to stage a fraud!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father! What are you doing? Are you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the problem? Hye-yeon, Yuri…..it doesn’t matter now!” He bellowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d been given an opportunity to survive, to fight back, and even rise… how could he let it go in vain? Whether it was his daughter or someone else’s, if she served his purpose, he would not shy away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, not Yuri. Yuri is….” He was trembling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myung-je knew his son all too well. He was too softhearted for his own good. He detested such useless emotions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You moron! Do you still have a feeling for her? Didn’t I tell you I can’t accept her.”</span></p>
<p><b>&lt;— Flashback Ends —&gt;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A whiskey glass flew, and something flashed before Hye-seong’s eyes – darkness shrouded his sight. Hye-yeon’s voice brushed the rim of his ear.</span></p>
<p><b><i>“Ewww, I smell alcohol! It’s been a year already! You should really stop. By the way, where are the car keys? I need to go see Yuri now and dad took my keys away. Hey, brother! Where’s your key?”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annoyed by Hye-yeon’s constant chattering, he pointed at the drawer. Little did he know it would be the last time he’d see his sister alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days later, when the police contacted him, what was waiting was a cold corpse of his sister.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she was going to see Yuri… to see Yuri….Yuri….</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri’s name incessantly echoed in Hye-seong’s mind, stirring his pain. After tossing and turning, he arduously lifted his eyelids. As deep as the pain in his shoulders pierced, as clear as his mind focused on some memories.</span></p>
<p><b><i>I am sorry…</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The memory of Yuri became vivid and apparent to Hye-seong again. To him, she was enchanting, even when she turned her back on him.  With vacant eyes, he murmured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You shouldn’t have come back, so I could forget you.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rain continued until dawn. Tae-jun was looking out the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such rainy night, he’d cast a furtive glance on the back of a woman. Quiet and pensive, she seemed to be immersed in looking out of the window. She was oblivious to her surroundings, it appeared only the pitter-patter of the rain and she existed in her world.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was she thinking about?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was what he’d asked himself then. That’s what he asked even now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, that scene would revisit Tae-jun. And each time, he wondered what could’ve been going through her mind in that moment. On a night like this, his own question was unbearable to him. He’d thought he could read Yuri like a book, but in fact, he’d come to realize he knew nothing about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day by day, he had more sleepless nights. He’d experienced insomnia before, but not as bad as now – he reckoned he might need to take sleeping pills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When another cigarette was lit, the buzzing of his phone broke the dismal silence. There was only one person who would call him this late at night.  As if he already knew who the caller was, Tae-jun pressed the button without even glancing at the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–          “Hello”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any progress?” Tae-jun never bothered with pleasantries and got straight to the brasstacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–          “Well, I think I am going to be on a date with a nurse who happens to work at the clinic Yuri undergoes her therapy. Which means, we’re getting close to her medical records. I’ve done more research about what Yuri does for a living. She is an assistant to some well-known plastic artist named ‘Roy Jean’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Assistant?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–          “Yes, kind of, like a helper. But you know, some people say assistant, and others say something else. Sponsors and patrons are common in this field. From what I’ve heard, their relationship is ambiguous. People don’t think Yuri is just an assistant to him. This Roy Jean guy has a reputation of his own. Seems like he turned into a womanizer ever since his wife’s passing, and that’s why he came to Korea before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clenching his fists, Tae-jun bit the bullet.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How dare you to find someone else?! By the way, the name sounds familiar– Roy Jean. I must’ve heard of him somewhere. But where?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Tae-jun was lost in thoughts, Jay brought up something unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–          “So here comes the highlight. Do you know where Roy Jean traveled for work with Yuri? I will give you a hint.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop clowning around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he detected fury in Tae-jun’s voice, Jay checked himself and hastened his reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–          “All right, all right. You have such a hot temper! The answer is… DaeJin Department Store in Korea… Where Mr. Tae-Jun Seo’s fiancée works as a director! What a coincidence, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won’s voice echoed in his mind.</span></p>
<p><b><i>For Hotel Seoin’s lobby, what do you think about a piece from Roy Jean?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>He’s Korean-American, and the hotshot plastic artist in the States nowadays. Daejin also purchased one of his works recently. I’ve met with his assistant before, so I can definitely help get in contact with him.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the hotel, and at the department store – moments he did not care flashed before his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subconsciously, his teeth grit and fists clenched.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darn it, Yuri Han was right in front of him!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
