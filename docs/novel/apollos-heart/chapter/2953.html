            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 51</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun indulged himself to his heart’s content… if there was such a thing as content that is. Following his instincts, he plunged deep into her core and stroked the inside walls. His taut abdomen crushed and rubbed her cl*toris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri shed incessant tears as waves of pain and pleasure deluged her. However, the man still dominated her without any mercy. He thrust relentlessly, using his tongue and fingers to make her respond to him whenever she would span.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He came when her vision blurred like when she was in the nightmare. Tae-jun poured himself into her as he kissed her neck and collarbone with a low groan. Wholly spent her hand on his shoulder dropped with a thump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun lightly tapped her cheek but got no response. Finally, his senses seemed to return, he was able to think.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had not had s*x like this even during his twenties. Such verve and the uncontrollable, obsessive passion that made him forget himself and focus only on the coital pleasures, was foreign to him. But he knew, this woman was the only one who had such an effect on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun pulled away from Yuri and ran his hand through her rumpled hair. Her swollen red lips stood out on her pale face. A mix of liquids from what they had just done spilled in his tracks. There was a still unsatisfied desire within the s*xual afterglow he was feeling at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You drive me crazy.” He whispered in her ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding her head, he gently put a pillow underneath. After covering her naked body with a quilt, Tae-jun put on a bathrobe and grabbed a cigarette. He went to the terrace and lit it, trying to suppress his hankerings with long swallows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was on the verge of mounting and feasting on her like a beast… it didn’t matter whether she could take it or not… it was like the pent up emotions from these past four years, had found a release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After determinedly reining in the brute of desire, he took another puff before called Jay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you checked Yuri Han’s treatment records?” Was the opening sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“The doctor in the clinic is careful with managing the documents, so it will take some time to get the records in full. Her illness is so tricky that there’s a mountain of consultation records.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the name of the illness?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Transient global amnesia. It’s a memory disorder from psychological trauma rather than the workings of the brain. This woman seems to have lost her entire memory of a specific period.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memory loss of a particular period?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun’s brows furrowed. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was it true she did not remember him?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her temperature, pulse, and breathing he felt in his hands were too real for Yuri to be feigning. No matter how good an actress she was, it would be impossible to control those things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he listened and thought, he did not know how much he should believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He ended the call and went back to the living room. Picking up Yuri’s bag lying at the entrance, he sat on the sofa and rummaged through the contents. Writing supplies, notebook, catalog, a cosmetics pouch, her passport, and a wallet… most of her belongings were simple black without any embellishments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ends of Tae-jun’s lips lifted. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still the same taste.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing they had in common was their preference for clothes and ornaments with clean cuts. And by the sight of it, it seemed to have remained despite the memory loss. Somehow, this trivial discovery brought a tinge of warmth within him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lighting another cigarette, he took out her wallet and passport. He compared the picture in the passport with her name. The pictures used in her license and passport were a younger version of Yuri, but they were undoubtedly her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting these aside, he reached out to the booklet. It was a catalog showcasing the profiles of artists in an exclusive contract with the agency Yuri belonged to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When his eyes landed on the picture on the opening page, they were suffused with malice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, this is her teacher and boss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the picture, it was obvious Roy Jean was a handsome man. He was forty-four but looked younger as some artists did. Ash hair, sharp eyes, and a lean and muscular body showed through the image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun went livid whenever he remembered Yuri going straight to Roy, calling and hugging him the moment she woke up. According to a report from America, this Roy was the most intimate relationship Yuri had there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was roughly turning over the pages until he found Yuri’s profile at the end. Since she had just made her debut, there was nothing noticeable except for her photo and pictures of her work. Tae-jun’s gaze fixed on the list of her works for a moment. There was a name that stuck out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apollo.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was this the work that was the motif for the ‘Heart of Apollo’?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no way to know as this particular work, unlike the rest, was without an image. Since a price tag was not listed, this work was not for sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun kept digging through the bag until he found something out of the ordinary. It was a pill bottle. Actually, it was a transparent plastic box that was the size of a small book containing neatly packaged pills in ziplock pouches. There were at least six different kinds in large amounts. They could’ve been vitamins, but the colors of the pills were too bright to be so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun did not specialize in medicine but knew what medicine Seoin Pharmaceutics, a subsidiary, developed. Taking his knowledge into account, these vibrant pills were typically psychotropic drugs. He wondered at the sheer amount of pills Yuri carried with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening the pillbox, he examined each pill with a stiff face. Opiates, stabilizers, antidepressants, and painkillers. He knew most of them but could not recognize the white pills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the product name was not listed, he deduced they must be a prototype.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she needs to take this much medicine at the same time, what happened to Yuri?</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>She is said to have mental problems. They say she tried to take her own life multiple times, and it’s become a habit.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I don’t know what happened, but I lost parts of my memory. Especially the last four to five years of my life. So I don’t remember you.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay’s report and Yuri’s condition… Furthermore, the fact she left him… disappeared, lost her memory, and now was taking all these drugs. Tae-jun’s thoughts sank deep in his eyes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙⸙⸙</span></i></p>
