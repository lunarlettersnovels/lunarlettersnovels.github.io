            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 48</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll call her. You can take the phone and tell her what you just said. I’m also curious about how she will respond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True to his words, Tae-jun took his cell phone out from the jacket he had taken off next to him. He pressed the speed dial to call Si-yeon, and turned to speaker mode and placed it on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Yes, Tae-jun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri flinched, hearing Si-yeon’s voice. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was Tae-jun thinking?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He resumed speaking with his eyes fixed on Yuri.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The person I’m in a meeting now wants to speak to Director Yoon. Do you have a minute?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–          “It’s all right. Is it a business matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ll know after hearing it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun pointed at the phone on the table with a smile on his lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–          “Hello, this is Director Yoon from Daejin Department Store. Who is this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri hesitated as she remembered the wife of a professor she had met before. When Yuri asked for help, the wife had told her that it was her fault of having given him leeway. She could not open her mouth as the image of the woman shielding her husband latched in her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Si-yeon was repeating herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–          “Hello? This is Si-yeon Yoon. Tae-jun, is there something wrong? No one’s answering.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun answered with a concealed sneer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems that there was too much alcohol involved. This, after asking me to call you that badly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–          “It can’t be helped. Please introduce me later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun slowly pressed the end button.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to wisely choose people to bluff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri had lost the game. He knew that she would not be able to act on the threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, she stood up and rapidly walked to the entrance. However, Tae-jun’s tight grip caught her first before she made it to the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never gave you escape as a choice.” He sniggered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let go of me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In no time, Yuri was pushed to the wall with some force. Tae-jun’s shadow engulfed her silhouette. She raised her head and met his eyes filled with desire … enough to swallow her whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you doing this? No matter what we were, aren’t we over?” She was incensed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who says it’s over?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun lifted her chin with one hand. Yuri instinctively tried to pull back, but she was already against the wall. He held her waist tightly with the other arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You say you don’t remember.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t, but I know that much. Because we broke up, you didn’t look for me in America … and even got en-engaged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was difficult for Yuri to open her lips. She trembled wherever his breath brushed against her. Her head was spinning from his scent mixed with cigarette smoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew you to be ‘Hye-yeon Jin’.” He brushed her hair away and whispered with his lips against her ear.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did he mean by that?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She had no time to think as he roughly held her head back and kissed her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun strengthened his grip on her chin to pry her lips open. His tongue ravaged hers in a breathtaking kiss. His sensu@l scent tinted with cigarette smoke overwhelmed her. She tried to push him away, but it only made him move in closer and deeper until she felt numb. No matter how she tried to get away from him, the kiss became rougher, and the wet sounds they made were becoming messier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His tongue was forcibly taking her breath away. He slipped her trench coat off of her with a hand while she was trying to get her breath back. He then violently tugged at her blouse. The buttons popped out to reveal a simple beige bra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri screamed and tried to hide what was displayed in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun spoke in a level voice even after that passionate kiss. “It’s not my type. Is it his?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He recklessly pushed up her bra and squeezed her brea*ts. Yuri shuddered everywhere when his hands pressed her hardening n!pples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun easily grabbed both of her wrists with one hand and held them up her head. She felt his tongue wrapping around her n!pples and sucking. He then rolled one in his mouth while fondling the other with his other hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He left red marks on her white skin as he hungrily sucked and grabbed. She let out a shaking breath. She trembled everywhere Tae-jun’s hands, lips, and tongue roamed. Her skin began to show a faint blush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun was enjoying her sweet skin to his heart’s content when he noticed the marks left by his hand on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It must have hurt. You always bruised so easily.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He kissed the bruise on her shoulder. She was writhing as she felt him hardening against her lower abdomen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let go! I don’t want this!” She tried to push him away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you already forget? I said you couldn’t refuse when I want you. Stop moving. I never did it like this, and I don’t want to hurt you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He spoke in a threatening tone as he lifted her up. His body, remaining immobile no matter what Yuri did. It did not matter whether she shouted, cried, or resisted, he would have her. </span></p>
