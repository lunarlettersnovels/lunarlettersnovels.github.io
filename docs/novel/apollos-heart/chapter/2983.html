            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 21 – The Witness</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The golden rays of the morning sun glistened the tranquil river as the tall reeds danced with the gentle breeze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stood there, dressed in a simple pair of jeans and sneakers, an unassuming smile gracing her lips, even as the rays teased her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took him a moment to recognize her without her uniform. He reckoned she must be on her way to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We meet again!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, hello!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took a step back when she saw it was Tae-jun. She was clearly not expecting him here, of all the places. He seemed cordial, unlike the previous day, so she decided to lay her curiosity to rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you doing here? Have you taken the wrong way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. I have something to check.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Check…? What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He openly evaded her question and instead asked one of his own. “Is this place very deep?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun pointed to the spot where he had just tried to step on. At first glance, it was hard to tell whether it was land or water. Only those familiar with this terrain could easily identify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, there are a lot of people who can’t tell if it’s land or water because it’s covered with reeds. Actually, it is a very deep spot, so you can’t get out of it if you get stuck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To emphasize the seriousness, she pointed to the sign ‘Accident Prone Area’.[1] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you know this place well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I live near here.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, was President Jin’s home near here? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He turned his gaze towards the river near where he stood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, can I ask you one thing? Do you happen to know about the accident that happened here two years ago?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two years ago…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She scrunched her brows as if trying hard to recollect, then suddenly her eyes brightened as she’d thought of something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you talking about the president who lived in the villa over there?” she asked. “He’s not actually a president, but he’s the one who lived in that villa over there. Why do you ask?” She turned cautious as she looked at him probingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lighting up his cigarette, he looked at her squarely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s my father.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes betrayed the shock her heart felt. This fellow, ever since they bumped into each other, had been giving her blows one after another. She took a moment to compose herself and preferred to be candid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People here have always called him the ‘Villa President’. I’ve often seen him fishing here. He was your father? Come to think of it, you do look alike.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really? Did he fish here always?” He started prodding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, he was here two or three times a week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soft wind gently carried the cigarette smoke, taking it to places. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two or three times a week.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If he did, he would’ve been familiar with this terrain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?” She appeared confused by his words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps it was the cigarette smoke, but the woman frowned and narrowed her lively eyes. Taking the cue, Tae-jun threw his cigarette into the lake. He looked on as it created small ripples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He wouldn’t have lost his footing by mistake.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a suicide!</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Father jumped into the river on his own.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d gotten his confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with that, Tae-jun turned around and walked away, leaving a befuddled woman behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back at the hotel, all alone, he poured himself a glass of alcohol. His vacant[2]  mien refused to reflect his inner thoughts.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did he expect? That his father didn’t kill himself?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He smiled self-deprecatingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not that he had never considered such a scenario. Deep in the recesses of his mind, whenever he had thought of his father’s sudden death, a part of him had declared it as suicide. But now that he had proof, it felt strange accepting it. It shouldn’t be so, he had long distanced himself from the man who was known as his father. And yet…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything about his father, right now, made him feel numb… Something hit and passed through his empty chest. An aching pain surged and he clenched his heart. He took deep breaths, desperately trying to calm something violently fluctuating within him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Night came but only after two bottles of strong liquor had disappeared. It was a dark night shrouded by a sullen silence. It was fated to be a sleepless night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning, bright and early, he was checking out. He noticed a shadow behind him. When he turned around, he met Hye-yeon Jin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can you spare me half an hour, if you don’t mind?” There was a kind of twinkle in her eyes, that made it hard to refuse.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does she want to do?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He was simply staring at her wondering what the woman was up to. His eyes showed vigilance. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s only 30 minutes… whatever can one do in thirty minutes?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s going on?” He was still hesitant to consent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a place I’d like you to go for a minute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they left the hotel, he noticed she was walking towards yesterday’s reed field. He was baffled.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did they come here again?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had barely calmed down from last night, when the sound that each step created on the reed, caused a turmoil in his heart again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where are we going?” He couldn’t take it anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ll see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He burned his cigarette to settle his nerves as he looked at the back of the woman leading him. Neither spoke, as they walked further and further away from the hotel until they reached a point where she stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place was a vacant lot clean of reeds. Looking at piles of junk and garbage around, it could be a recycling dump.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the hell are we doing in this dump?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She must have been insane and he was a fool to follow her bewitched. But looking at the woman, she looked sober.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly, Taejun’s darting gaze found an old man sitting between two piles of garbage. The hat he wore… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he couldn’t be mistaken</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—the checkered hunting cap with ear flaps—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was his father’s!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwhelmed, Tae-jun unconsciously approached the man. “You… that hat…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man stared at Tae-jun, puzzled. He didn’t seem to understand a word of what the other said. It was only when the woman used sign language to communicate that he understood the man was hearing-impaired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two spoke for a long time. By and by his frustration was reaching its peak. When he had had enough, he interjected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who is this guy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We call him Mr. Shin, and he lives here collecting waste paper, junk, cleaning up the reed beds in front of you and often picks up scraps or recyclables from the hotel. The day of the accident happened, he was on his way there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then this guy…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, this man is the witness.” She finished his thoughts for him.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He saw the accident that day? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun’s jaw stiffened.</span></p>
