            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 45</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking a few deep breaths, Yuri opened her lips again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ I… I don’t remember you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun smirked coldly.  “Are you telling me that you don’t remember a thing? If that’s your only excuse, come on, that’s not fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am serious! The only thing that I know about you is that you are Director Yoon’s fiancé and that’s it. I was just introduced to you.” She appeared incredulous, her eyes wide in shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t give me that crap. I am not in the mood to play games.” He sniggered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am not trying to play anything! I do not have any memory …”</span></p>
<p><b><i>BANG!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun slammed the bedhead with his fist. Because of the deafening noise, Yuri covered her ears and closed her eyes. He reached out his hand and twisted her hair with his fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hate wasting my time. We have a lot to talk about from now on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voice falling down her ears sounded excited. Contrary to his heated voice, his eyes sunk to the abyss. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it how being eaten by a beast feels like?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She could only breathe and glare at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What created the fracture in suffocating silence in the ward was Tae-jun’s phone inside his jacket. He checked the name on the screen, and in an annoyed voice, answered the call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Didn’t I tell you not to call me today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An anxious voice hurriedly murmured that the chairman had summoned Tae-jun through the phone. While the man answered the phone, Yuri pulled out the IV needle on her arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hate it, I hate these needles. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was disgusted with the same repetitive situation where the fluid entered her body through the needle whenever she woke up in the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will come in soon. Buy some time, I am nearby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the phone call, Tae-jun spoke to Yuri in a commanding tone. “Come see me when I call you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not going to happen.” She replied flatly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is going to happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tae-jun left the ward, Yuri quickly got off the bed, put on her jacket, and tidied herself. Her shoulders were still hurting, and her hands trembled. She struggled to pack her bag as she rubbed her shoulders in a bid to soothe herself. At that moment, the door opened, and the doctor entered the ward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri quickly noticed his name tag on his chest. Seoin Hospital, Internist Jin-ho, Jeong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-ho approached Yuri. “Did you get hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I think I just bumped into something and it hurts a little bit.” She lied through her teeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you have any medical conditions or medications that you take?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri intentionally shook her head. She did not want to speak a word. Since she was at Seoin Hospital, everything she said to the doctor would reach Tae-jun, from which medicine she took, to how her condition was. She did not want him to have any information about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ok. So I am going to check your blood pressure and run a brief blood test …”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, Yuri waved her hands. “No, no need for the tests. I have been tired for the past few days. I didn’t sleep well as usual. I think I am okay now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But …”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Actually, I have some urgent things to take care of. I need to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Yuri refused flatly, Jin-ho only shrugged his shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right then, please take a good rest when you go home. I would still like to recommend you get tested. You have a bad complexion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will see. How can I pay?” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, don’t worry about it. It’s already taken care of. You can just leave.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be Tae-jun.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yuri concluded while opening her bag again to put her wallet back into the purse. It was not that she realized something that she did not notice before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, is this everything?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, that’s everything we have. The person who brought you passed it to us”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her tablet was gone! It was not in her purse anymore. Only then did she realize what Tae-jun meant when he said, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘it is going to happen’.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bastard!” Yuri clenched her teeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she came back to her hotel room, Yuri searched Tae-jun Seo, executive director of Seoin Group. An Asian Games gold medalist at trap shooting, and the successor of Seoin Group which included eight subsidiaries. The man who had everything by birth, and also destined to have more in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staring at the picture of Tae-jun on her screen, Yuri dwelled on her current situation. Her dreams, and his attitude. From what she could assemble through his reactions, she could vaguely assume what their prior relationship could have been in the past. But judging from his untoward reaction to her, their relationship could be something more serious than a fling. She frowned.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time I lost my memories, I was dating Hye-seong, wasn’t I?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she came back to Jinseong City after being almost hustled out of her school and art industry, Hye-seong was the first one to offer her a friendly helping hand. As Yuri was mentally exhausted, he who she had known ever since she was a child, was a great comfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, she was aware of his father’s concerns about their relationship, hence did not expect a future with Hye-seong. Yuri simply pocketed her feelings – she also had her own plans in her mind. She already knew that they were to split their ways when the time came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even then, she could not believe that she must have moved on so fast with another man; with a man who had a peerlessly prominent background compared to the Jins.</span></p>
