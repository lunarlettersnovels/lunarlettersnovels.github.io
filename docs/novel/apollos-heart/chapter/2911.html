            <p><b>Chapter 94</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won froze, it was a good few seconds before he regained his senses. He first hung Tae-jun’s clothes, took out two water bottles from the refrigerator and placed them near his cousin’s head. It was an act of kindness in case he woke in the middle of the night due to thirst. After that, without an extra glance at the unconscious man, he turned off the lights and strode out of the suite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you heading home? Should I contact the driver?” The manager on his night shift noticed Jae-won and greeted him courteously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I forgot something at the office. I’ll take care of the driver. ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won returned to his office with a stiffened expression and turned on the computer. He booted the program and typed in the security code. Then, he recklessly opened up a file. He found what he was looking for. He let out a small cry at the name that popped up on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my goodness!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He roughly rubbed his face with his dry hands. Suddenly everything started to make sense: every inconceivable thing Tae-jun had done </span><b><i>finally</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made sense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The file that Jae-won was looking at was a list of guests who had canceled their hotel reservation. It had to be here … The name that Tae-jun called for when he was drunk … </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that name had to be here … </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yuri Han.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name that he called out so sorrowfully and intimately … wreathed in such pain. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late at night, Jin-wook poured soju for a man at an old bar nearby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How’s work? Is it doable”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man receiving the drink was an ex-manager of Hotel Jinseong, and current valet parking employee of Hotel Seoin. He was the man who recognized Yuri Han from the picture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s getting difficult to work since I’m becoming old … But what other choice do I have? My first-born just started college a year behind. The youngest just started freshman year in high school.” He replied with a depressed voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I’m sorry to hear, but I also understand how you’re feeling. My youngest is also in high school,” Jin-wook said calmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And thus, the two men nonchalantly chatted about life and other important things as they drank. Jin-wook decided  to get to the point when the bottle was almost empty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Driver Su-won Han … What was he like as a person?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You mean Mr. Han? To be exact, Mr. Han was called a ‘driver,’ but actually, he wasn’t someone who should be working under others. He graduated from a prestigious college, you see, and he even owned a business in Seoul.” There was a degree of respect in his voice, and he truly meant every word of praise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-wook was a little surprised. Throughout his research so far, this was something he hadn’t come across. He had assumed the man would be an ordinary blue collar at the most, surely not a learned one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then why did he work as a driver for President Jin?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A graduate from an ordinary college could easily find a white collar job to say nothing of people like Su-won Han who had passed out of prestigious college. So, this man had chosen to toil for a scum like Myung-je Jin when he could be sitting in a posh office in a business suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The two were neighbourhood friends since childhood. I heard Han borrowed quite some money from Jin when he was expanding his business and his wife got ill. Later, he even took out loans under Jin’s name. Jin was a President, but he wasn’t a brainy one. All he knew was how to order gangsters to break a few things here and there. So when the business expanded, he wanted a person he could trust and rely on, but someone he could look down upon at the same time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And that was Mr. Han.” Jin-wook concluded in the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can put it that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man ordered another bottle of alcohol and opened the lid. Jin-wook who was busy jotting down in a small notebook popped a question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How well do you know of Mr. Han’s accident?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just as much as the newspaper articles. It did seem quite odd, though. Mr. Han never drank typically because he didn’t know when President Jin would call for him. But a man like him ran towards a car intoxicated-”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you see Mr. Han on the day of the accident by any chance?” Jin-wook probed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The day of the accident? To be frank, Mr. Han had gone missing a few days before the incident. There was someone else driving President Jin around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was news, nowhere had he come across this. And needless to say, the seeds of doubts were sprouting. Jin-wook dug in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What has happened?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, he had quite a big argument with President Jin.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because of what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man was more than willingly chirping the whole story non-stop when suddenly, he shut his mouth like a clam. A puzzled Jin-wook stared at the man. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man awkwardly tried to change the topic. “Working outdoors is so cumbersome now that I’m an old man. I would like to switch to a position that works inside of the hotel before the weather gets any colder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man’s intentions were obvious. He was expecting a reward for helping. Well, there are no free lunches, and who better than the cadaver dog Jin-wook to know it best? He simply nodded in assent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That would depend on what you are able to give me. Do you have anything special you would like to share with me?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man’s eyes glistened as he happily noticed an opportunity. He said slyly, “I have the security camera footage of President Jin and Mr. Han arguing in the hotel lobby. To be honest, Jin had told me to delete it, but I kept a backup just in case. Now that Jinseong Construction is out of business and Jin dead, I thought it had become irrelevant, but like they say nobody knows what the future holds.” He smiled in satisfaction apparently basking in self-praise on being insightful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll make sure to report it to the executives. I don’t have the right to make decisions about the reward by myself.” Jin-wook stated matter-of-factly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hope to hear from you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an afterthought, Jin-wook asked, “By any chance, is there anyone else who knows about the argument between President Jin and Mr. Han?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hyeon-ah Kim.” The man muttered a name and looked up. “Right, she should know about it. That day, I was late to work because my shift started in the afternoon. I got a hang of what was going on only after I watched the security camera footage. The person in charge of the lobby was Hyeon-ah Kim that day.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyeon-ah Kim.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jin-wook cringed as the face of a woman with a kind smile and hidden intentions appeared in his mind. She was a woman he could not predict even after years of working with all sorts of people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man emptied the last glass and got up from his seat. Something felt very strange. He didn’t expect things to become so serious when he initially started his search for Yuri Han. Looking at how things were panning, even a veteran investigator like him couldn’t help wonder- </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was at the end of all this? </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙ </span></i></p>
