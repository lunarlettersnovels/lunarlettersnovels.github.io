            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 54</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not over?!” she asked, flabbergasted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he puffed out, Tae-jun knocked off the ashes, eyes never once leaving the woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s not split hairs.” He sniggered. “We still had two months left, but you disappeared when I went on a business trip. Isn’t this a clear breach of our contract? I require an explanation.” His lopsided grin evinced how much he was enjoying cornering her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, you have nothing to say because you lost your memory.” He jabbed. “However, our contract needs to be fulfilled.” His frosty words were a reflection of his mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of sullen silence, Yuri Han looked at him squarely and said, “You know I’m not Hye-yeon Jin. What are you asking me to do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As you said, it doesn’t matter whether your name is Hye-yeon Jin or Yuri Han. It’s you who is in bed with me, aren’t I right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had used her own words to trap her. He was making it amply clear there was no way she could escape his clutches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the woman in question was incredulity personified. It was such twisted logic. “You are crazy!” She spat out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun chuckled softly, not minding her harsh words one bit. His smile was cold as ice, he lifted her chin and forced her to look into his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, you know. I regret that I hadn’t told you sooner. If you knew I was crazy, you wouldn’t have pulled off this doubling stunt on me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri flinched at Tae-jun’s darkening eyes, those orbs seemed to have the power to engulf anyone they desired. She tried to wrest herself free, but his grip was tight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like this, the prey and the predator were in a stalemate until the doorbell rang. Tae-jun looked at the clock and let go of Yuri’s chin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Tae-jun left the bedroom, she straightened herself. Just then she felt something flow between her legs when she tried to get out of bed. She was dumbstruck when she looked inside her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her thighs and p*bic hair had dried cum on them, she could still feel some inside her. The stinging in her lower stomach and the numbness in her nether regions, painstakingly helped her recollect that she had had s*x with Tae-jun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri was wiping herself down with a cloth when she heard a familiar voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t be so cold-hearted. I found the hotel kitchen bustling when I went there to get something for my hangover. I was thinking of you, and I thought we could have breakfast together, but you seem not to have slept at all. Did you work all night?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why do you want to know that?” a cold voice said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The room lacks your signature cigarette residues. Do you have a guest?” The inquisitiveness was evident in the tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri hid below the blankets as soon as she recognized Jae-won’s voice. Thankfully, the bedroom door closed immediately, and his voice faded away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little while later, Tae-jun came into the bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wake up. Let’s eat,” he said to the figure huddled under the quilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is Mr. Jae-won gone?” she asked, peeking her head out ever so slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you know Jae-won?” Tae-jun demanded instead of an answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I met him by chance at Daejin Department Store. We had dinner over the discussion of purchasing works for the exhibition.” She replied honestly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun’s voice dripped with sarcasm as he helped a tittering Yuri up. “Should I have shown Jae-won that the woman naked in my bed is Yuri Han?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He doesn’t have anything to do with our relationship. Where are my clothes?” she said, irritatedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll tell you after we eat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri frowned at Tae-jun’s callous treatment of her things—from the tablet PC to her clothes. However, she had no other option but to do as he wished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table was filled with food for more than two, from Korean and western dishes to porridge and juice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun dished small portions of each dish on Yuri’s plate. However, her mouth dried upon seeing the exquisite spread, she felt no appetite. Instead, she found this whole situation of Tae-jun feeding her quite unsettling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was unable to make out this man’s persona or intentions. His words were curt and cold, but his actions of meticulously serving her food were quite the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Yuri managed to take small bites of melon and some soup only because she thought she needed to eat something to find the strength to get out of here. That was her goal no.1 at the moment—freeing herself from the devil’s clutches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun looked at her gingerly nibbling and smirked. “Eat other dishes too. You’re too thin. You must have lost at least ten pounds since we last met.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does he know such things?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yuri pulled at the front of her shirt and ignored his comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t have any appetite. Just give me back my clothes and the tablet PC.” She wanted to get out right now, she had been on tenterhooks right from the moment she woke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should finish our conversation first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What conversation? That absurd contract? Do you think I’ll accept that?” She snorted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shouldn’t you be thankful that I’m not going to ask you to compensate for the four years? I’ll even raise the ante, anything you want.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri could only scoff at his offer and glared at Tae-jun. “I have nothing to say. Go somewhere for another woman.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t need a woman. I need Yuri Han.”</span></p>
