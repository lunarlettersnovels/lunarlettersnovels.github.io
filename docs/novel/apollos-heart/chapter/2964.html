            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 40</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is alone?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Si-yeon stared at Tae-jun’s reflection on the doors of the elevator. He was flippantly reclined against the wall, his deep orbs void of emotions, his chiseled face stone cold. Even though they were conversing, she felt as though he was not here. He behaved as if they belonged in different worlds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The doors opened, Tae-jun was the first one to walk out. Si-yeon found she could not take her eyes off his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking this opportunity of this momentary privacy, Kim leaned in and whispered into Si-yeon’s ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Director Seo’s secretary also does not have any idea. He said Mr. Seo did not even show up to the office today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?!” she asked in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary Kim winced at her volume and brought a finger to her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shhh… He might hear us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Tae-jun stopped and turned back towards them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me make a call before we go in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without waiting for a response, he went outside to the terrace garden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tilting her head, Si-yeon then entered the lounge first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly remodeled interior of the VIP lounge was exquisite and held a somewhat enigmatic aura. The high ceilings and the blue lighting overhead were reminiscent of the deep ocean and its abyss. Located at the heart of this mystic space, was Heart of Apollo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they saw them enter, the employees bowed towards Si-yeon and her secretary. A few steps away was Yuri, recording the installation of the piece with her tablet. When she sensed Si-yeon approaching, she lifted her head and greeted her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh! Hi Ms. Yoon.” She greeted jovially.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Si-yeon’s eyes glinted in satisfaction at the design before her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is beyond my expectation! The lounge and the Heart of Apollo complement each other spectacularly!” She didn’t hold back on her compliments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I agree with you.” Yuri put a soft smile on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal was fair for both parties involved, and she was proud to present the work, in which a great amount of effort had been invested in by her. She had always felt a sense of accomplishment when her work was to her satisfaction, the client’s praises were merely the cherry on the topping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking closely at the Heart of Apollo, Si-yeon seemed to realize something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t realize it when I saw it for the first time in New York… But this piece somehow reminds me of you. Are you the inspiration?” she asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I am not.” Yuri laughed sheepishly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really? Hasn’t anyone told you that the piece resembles you?” Si-yeon asked. She couldn’t believe no one had pointed out the obvious yet!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri gazed at the Heart of Apollo. She had recorded and taken pictures of it numerous times, but she had never quite considered who the inspiration behind it was. But saying that she was the inspiration seemed too far fetched for her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nah, it must be someone else– Roy’s late wife, perhaps. After all, he still wears the wedding ring.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am not the muse. It’s someone else.” She replied confidently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, yes?” Si-yeon didn’t seem to believe her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Perhaps the resemblance stems from Roy’s environment. Artists are always influenced by their surroundings. I do spend a lot of time with Roy as an assistant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Yuri said was not over the top. Many famous works were a fruit of the most unexpected source of inspiration. And since she herself was an artist, her explanation sounded logical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aha, that makes sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Si-yeon didn’t continue the topic and shifted her attention to admiring the work. Yuri, on the other hand, was lost in her thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truth be told, her words were an extension of her subconscious behaviour. Every time she had picked the brush, she had ended up drawing the man. The man who frequented her dreams. When this could happen to her, why couldn’t it happen to Roy who was known to have loved his wife dearly?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she thought, she was back to the matter that she’s preoccupied with. Although she had decided she’d regain her memories, she didn’t even know where to begin. But now she did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first piece of the puzzle was obviously the man in her dreams. He seemed like a key player in the game of her lost memories. However, she had no clue about his identity or whatsoever. The only thing she knew about him was his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the shadow of a tall man blanketed in front of Yuri. She unconsciously raised her head towards the source. When her eyes met the face of the stranger, her jaw slightly dropped as her eyes widened to their limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ho… How…?” Yuri stammered, but her voice reached no ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed surreal… as if this person had walked right out of her canvas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she saw the man from her dreams in flesh and blood, instinctively, Yuri took a step back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boundary between reality and dream collapsed, her mind started spiraling– she was shoved into a bottomless chasm unable to distinguish true from false. Due to the dizziness, her vision spun like the doll in the music box. Her hands were robbed of strength, she dropped the tablet in her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right before it could hit the ground and clatter to the floor, the man in front of her caught it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You should be careful, Yuri Han.” His cool voice told her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This low voice… All of a sudden, the air surrounding her felt suffocating –</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">… Am I in another dream? Is he coming after me? He is going to grab me by the arms, push me against the wall,</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and force raw and violent intercourse – I have seen this gaze, the gaze of a brute. He will devour me like a beast!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Si-yeon’s voice rescued Yuri before she plummeted into a deeper panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me introduce my fiancé, Yuri.  Director Tae-jun Seo from Seoin Group.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun Seo.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri repeated his name in her mind. She did not know this name, nor the man. Her gaze moved from top to bottom as she surveyed the man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prominent jaw, audacious lips, aristocratic nose… As though someone had thrown her off a perpendicular cliff, something vertiginous flashed before her eyes when her eyes met his.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was determined to identify the man from her dreams but did not expect him to appear in such an abrupt way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tae-jun, this is Yuri, Roy Jean’s assistant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun introduced himself even before Si-yeon finished her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you do, Miss Han. Glad to meet you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of his voice tugged painfully at Yuri’s heartstrings.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lies, he already knew who she was. He already knew her name.</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>You should be careful, Yuri Han.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d already called her by her name…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
