            <p><strong>Chapter 89</strong></p>
<p>Yuri organized the photos and the papers and hid them inside a drawer, making sure they were out of sight.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about that.” She murmured to herself as she slammed it shut.</p>
<p>That’s right, this was not on her, definitely, she was not to be blamed. She didn’t seek the man, it was the other way around. She wanted to make a clean break, but it was he who lured her into it … taking her tablet, tossing her a contract. It was Tae-jun who was always threatening and locking her up, not the other way around. She was only going to stay around him until she recovered her memories. It would only last a month or two. She would leave way before his wedding, she would be far far away from the man. This was all temporary.</p>
<p>She irritatedly brushed her fingers through her hair and held onto her pencil again. Her croquis was 90 percent complete. It illustrated a man hugging a woman. She could not help but think of Si-yeon as she worked on the facial features. The man who embraced her so passionately would now do the same to Si-yeon. The same member that shoved its way inside of her would now be greedy for Si-yeon’s body.</p>
<p>Yuri could not handle it anymore. Huffing and gasping, she threw the pencil in her hand and mercilessly shredded the paper into pieces. Her work, after months and months of inspiration, now nothing but trash, lay scattered around her. Running her fingers through her tresses, she tugged at them as if doing so would pull her out of the emotional whirlpool she was in right now.</p>
<p>At that moment, her phone on the table rang wildly. She took a deep sigh and reached to check on the caller. It was her uncle. It was early in the morning in New York, the time when he usually woke up to work out at the gym.</p>
<p>The day before, Yuri had left him a voicemail regarding her visit and her father’s belongings. So, he must be calling about it. Yuri adjusted her voice to hide her emotions as she answered the call.</p>
<p>“Hello, Uncle.”</p>
<ul>
<li>“I just saw your message. You’re leaving Korea tomorrow?”</li>
</ul>
<p>“I am. I’ll call you once I get there.”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Is Roy coming with you?”</li>
</ul>
<p>“No, Roy’s currently in Japan, and I’m only visiting temporarily. You have father’s belongings, right?”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Everything that the police found is in the storage. Everything else was thrown away when I went to Korea to get rid of the house. Why are you looking for them all of a sudden?”</li>
</ul>
<p>“I’ll tell you in person. This isn’t something to talk about through the phone.”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Did you remember something?”</li>
</ul>
<p>She noticed that his voice elevated with excitement.</p>
<p>“Yes, but not entirely.”</p>
<p>A groan sounded from the other end.</p>
<p><em>He would be really shocked when he hears more about Father’s death.</em> Yuri thought to herself as she cautiously mentioned the name in case he was aware of it.</p>
<p>“By the way Uncle, do you happen to recognize the name “Sang-gu Park” in connection to Father’s accident?”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Of course I do. How can I not? He witnessed your father’s accident. He’s the guy who said your father ran into the car.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“Witnessed?”</p>
<p>Yuri was shocked beyond words.</p>
<p><em><strong>That b*tch is fierce and tiresome. Like father, like daughter.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It’s him! The one who tried to kill me and murdered Hye-yeon!</em></p>
<p>She could feel her pulse racing as she tried to remember something about him. A headache started to surface, Yuri groaned.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Yuri! What is it? Are you okay?”</li>
</ul>
<p>“Huh? Yeah … I’m fine. I’m just … just a little shocked.”</p>
<ul>
<li>“How do you know that name?”</li>
</ul>
<p>“He’s relevant to my incident .”</p>
<ul>
<li>“What?!”</li>
</ul>
<p>“Uncle, you do know what he looks like, right? I can’t talk for long; my head is aching badly. I’ll tell you all about it once I get there.”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Of course, I’ll wait for you.”</li>
</ul>
<p>After hanging up, Yuri restlessly lay her body on the sofa. Her head was throbbing, she was in excruciating pain …  she felt as if someone was piercing her head with a nail. She glared at the shredded remains of the paper. She was so mad that her head was aching. Her eyes welled up with tears, she was fighting hard to endure.</p>
<p><em>Why is it hurting so much …</em></p>
<p>Unable to hold it any longer, Yuri impatiently took out a pill with her trembling hands, walked to the kitchen to fetch a cold glass of water to swallow it with. Then she sat at the table massaging her temples.</p>
<p><em>It’s okay. Everything will be fine. </em>She was reassuring herself when …</p>
<p><em><strong>SLAM!</strong></em></p>
<p>… The main door closed with a racket. Yuri immediately stood up to check who it was only to see Tae-jun barging towards her.</p>
<p>“You said you’re going to be late …”</p>
<p>A frosty, maniacal Tae-jun bored his hawkeyes into her. The man stood there in silence, dropping the temperature in the room to the subzero level. But when his gaze landed on the pill vial sitting neatly on the table, he grabbed it, fiercely thrashing it on the floor. The clear plastic vial shattered upon impact, the capsules scattered in all directions.</p>
<p>“What do you think you’re doing!”</p>
