            <p><strong>Chapter 142 – Scarred (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>It’s not her!</em></p>
<p>Sang-gu’s eyes trembled when he confirmed the face of the woman lying in the bed behind the curtain. He checked the face multiple times in order not to make the same mistake again.</p>
<p><em>This is not the same woman! Dammit, it’s a trap!</em></p>
<p>He felt a cold metal touch his skin just as he realized the error.</p>
<p>“Put your hands up.”</p>
<p>From its sensation, it was not a knife. <em>Is it a knife?</em> Sang-gu sluggishly turned his body with his hands up. The glistening eyes of the man with a gun were very visible even in the dark room.</p>
<p>“Tae-Tae-jun Seo!”</p>
<p>The man aiming the gun with a silencer was Tae-jun. <em>Was it because of the reflection of the light from outside that his eyes glistened with fragments of light, and resembled those of a beast?</em> It wasn’t usual for a man to have such eyes. Sang-gu could feel his forehead become sweaty.</p>
<p>“You recognize me.”</p>
<p>Sang-gu quickly calculated the distance between the door and himself. If he could dodge the first bullet, then he had a chance of escaping. Then, without a doubt, he sprung his body and dashed towards Tae-jun. Right when Tae-jun’s body shook, he threw a blanket towards him.</p>
<p>Tae-jun would not be able to shoot when his body was shaking and his sight hindered. However, Sang-gu, as he was running as fast as he could to the door, realized otherwise. Tae-jun’s bullet precisely pierced his calf.</p>
<p>“Uggghhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Even though it was an airgun, because it was shot from a short distance, its power was enough to destroy a leg muscle in an instant. Tae-jun apathetically examined Sang-gu’s injured leg, then summoned the woman on the bed. She rang the doorbell, and several men ran towards the open door. They mercilessly captured Sang-gu, who was vulnerably lying on the ground.</p>
<p>“I’ve also captivated the two rats downstairs.”</p>
<p>An elderly man soon followed the feisty young-bloods. The moment he saw him, Sang-gu recognized they both had similar occupations.</p>
<p>Tae-jun said to the man, “Take care of it.”</p>
<p>The woman got off from her bed and approached Sang-gu to wrap his leg with a bandage. She seemed to be an expert at it.</p>
<p><em>What was happening?</em> <em>How could he act so insanely if he allegedly calls himself a son of a major corporation?</em></p>
<p>The perplexed man’s mouth was soon stuffed with pebbles and had his head covered with a cloth</p>
<p>The men dragged Sang-gu away and wiped off the bloodstains without leaving a mark.</p>
<p>Tae-jun handed a gun to Jin-wook and warned him. “Watch carefully. Stay vigilant.”</p>
<p>The fact that he climbed up from the ninth floor to the tenth floor with only a rope and that he didn’t get intimidated by an open fire proved how reckless he was. Quite surprisingly, such a man did not have any criminal record, not even a single traffic ticket. In-bae Lee probably helped him clear his name. It gave him a heartache to think that such a satanic man endangered Yuri’s life.</p>
<p>Jin-wook asked Tae-jun when he noticed the frown on his face, “Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“I think it got hurt when it got bumped into.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun placed his hand on the waist that was cut by Hye-seong’s bullet.</p>
<p>“I told you to leave it to me. I’ll call Jin-ho.”</p>
<p>Jin-wook clicked his tongue as he took out his phone. Although Tae-jun did not acknowledge it, his injury was quite serious. Not only did he get hurt by the bullet but was also burned in the arms, shoulders, back, and legs. Moreover, the inside of his ears was damaged from firing a shotgun constantly without any protection. But the man was preoccupied with worrying about Yuri Han. He was insane.</p>
<p>Jin-ho, who was summoned, awkwardly glanced at Jin-wook, and examined the injured area. A cut made by a bullet was nothing compared to a typical injury. The skin around the cut was dangling off the body. All they could do was to wish for the skin to naturally heal itself shut.</p>
<p>Jin-ho sighed and told Tae-jun as he wrapped up the first aid, “It’s dangerous to leave it to worsen. Don’t you remember Dr. Yang’s advice? And I’ll be stopping by your place. You need to apply ointment and change bandages.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.” Tae-jun asked as he buttoned his shirt, “What about Yuri?”</p>
<p>“She must still be with Hyeon-ah  Kim.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun’s face turned stern. Ever since Yuri retrieved her memory, she appeared as if she was trying to overcome something. This wasn’t something he had control over. All he could do was obey her.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you took good care of it?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I told the employees to act immediately if Hyeon-ah Kim seems to threaten Ms. Han in any way. Are you actually thinking about using Hyeon-ah  to capture In-bae Lee?”</p>
<p>Tae-jun recollected his research of Hyeon-ah. He got the impression that the woman’s thoughts were unreadable. Her eyes also appeared dead. He replied as he wore a jacket, “The list needs to be exposed by someone and that someone should not be Yuri.”</p>
<p>“I understand your concern. I will take caution.”</p>
