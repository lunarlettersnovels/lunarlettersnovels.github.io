            <p><strong>Chapter 129 – Held Captive (2)</strong></p>
<p>The man who had dragged her in handed President Jin a small stainless steel vial who then took out white powder and a syringe.</p>
<p>“It’s something new we made by mixing things up; the Chinese and Russians are crazy over … it absolutely ruins a person. They say they can’t stab or shoot someone since labor expenses are rising. Fucking fools, use only what’s comfortable for them. No, no. I do not need to go all the way to China or Russia, as a prosecutor who had been annoying me went away with this.”</p>
<p>President Jin diluted the powder in a saline solution and injected it in a syringe.</p>
<p>“He drooled and crawled on the floor like a dog, even grabbed and shook his penis when I said I would give him some more. A man who learned as much as any other, without any embarrassment. Even a lowlife like me cannot do that. Don’t worry, since you’re only a beginner, I will raise the level bit by bit. If I don’t, you’ll go into shock and the effects won’t show. I heard that your brain would melt if you continue being injected with this, but I haven’t seen that yet with my own eyes. I also heard that you wouldn’t be able to remember how to breathe without this drug and will only want this until you die when you become addicted. Haven’t you heard that there are some Chinese who don’t have brains in their skull when they’re dissected?”</p>
<p>With an evil smile, President Jin slowly approached Yuri while holding the syringe, the big guy lifted one of her arms and raised her sleeve.</p>
<p>“No! No!”</p>
<p>Yuri shrieked and struggled, but it was futile. She fainted the moment the syringe stabbed into her arm, shuddered like she was going through a seizure. Her body went limp as the liquid emptied out into her veins, her head spun while her senses disappeared. Her body fragmented into pieces and was put together again. Her sight convulsed, she could not move a finger. She could not feel herself going numb by being tied up or the pain from where President Jin had hit her.</p>
<p><em>So, this was how a twisted dimension felt …</em></p>
<p>The sound of President Jin ordering the big man passed through her ears meaninglessly.</p>
<p>“Drag her away and lock her up. If she’s drugged for a few days, she’ll bring the documents on her own.” As an afterthought he added. “The drug’s expensive, so just take care of her here. Things will all die down by then—”</p>
<p>“If it dies down? Who will be the happiest?” President Jin let out a delirious laugh. “I have to force that bitch to bring the ledger, she has to save Jinseong Constructions.”</p>
<p>“What if she’s already handed it over to a media outlet or some place else?” One of the men queried.</p>
<p>“If it were so, he would have done something. But from the way things stand, it’s still hidden somewhere.” He knew that In-bae Lee would have unleashed havoc if it landed in the hands of a third party. Since it was still quiet, it meant otherwise.</p>
<p>“Then, if you’re going to keep her alive, can I have a taste? I’ve never seen a prettier face—” The retainer’s lecherous eyes shone.</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about it if you don’t want a bullet in your head. She’s expensive, and Tae-jun Seo is someone even I can’t handle. Do you understand what I’m saying?”</p>
<p>The big guy licked his lips as President Jin spoke with a shudder. He carried Yuri like luggage and threw her on a bed in a room. It even had a bathroom. While nothing shackled her, she could not move an inch. She could not lower her skirt as it had risen up, and the big guy stroked her thin calf with a sigh.</p>
<p>“She seems delicious also on the inside.” He ogled her like a predator would its prey. Even so, perhaps because he was scared of President Jin or his threat, he did not do anything else.</p>
<p>Yuri looked up vacantly at the ceiling, her mind was ruminating something else. She still could not move, her eyes were foggy. The only thing she could remember was the name President Jin had said: <em>Tae-jun Seo.</em></p>
<p><em>Tae-jun Seo, Tae-jun Seo, Tae-jun Seo. Please save me, please …</em></p>
<p>She didn’t know how much time had passed. After about a week, she woke up in pain.For the first time, her head felt clear and the shock from the overdose a couple of days ago, helped her focus. Also, the fluid President Jin gave her, just in case she died, helped her support her body. She thought of only one thing when she came back to her senses.</p>
<p><em>I have to escape before I’m addicted further.</em></p>
<p>Looking around, she saw dried bread and a bottle of water. She tumbled down the bed, and inching on all fours brought herself to the only good there was. Slowly, with sheer grit, she managed to put feed and hydrate herself. She did not want to die and end like this. She would survive to avenge herself.</p>
<p>She lay still on the floor for a few minutes, she had just eaten … god knows after how long, she had to let it settle. Soon after, her eyes darted about looking for an exit. However, she was trapped on the fourth floor, the windows had bars making it impossible to pry. It was the same for the bathroom. The only way out was through the door.</p>
<p>Right then, the door opened. The burly man came in with her dose of drug and food.</p>
<p><em>What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Yuri was deep in thought when she thought of a plan.</p>
<p><em>⸙⸙⸙</em></p>
