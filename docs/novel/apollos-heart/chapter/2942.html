            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 62</strong></p>
<p>Yuri stirred when a knock sounded on the door, she barely managed to open her eyes. When she did, she noticed there was no sight of the man in the empty room. Instead, a middle-aged woman wearing a nice suit came in and greeted her as she rose.</p>
<p>“I hope you had a good night’s sleep.” She smiled politely.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Yuri asked in a hoarse voice as she tried to sit up.</p>
<p>“I am Department Head Yun-hee Choi, and I’m in charge of taking care of you while you’re staying here. Please call me Department Head Choi.” The woman still wore a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t need to be taken care of.” Yuri flatly refused, she was no kid needing a sitter.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but that question is out of my jurisdiction. Please discuss it with the director.”</p>
<p>Yun-hee Choi looked uncomfortable, and if Yuri insisted further, she would be the one in trouble. For now, she suppressed a sigh and instead, stated a question.</p>
<p>“Where is Mr. Tae-jun Seo?”</p>
<p>“He had an early morning. I was told not to wake you up, but I thought you needed to eat.” She smiled again.</p>
<p>Yuri looked at the clock and saw it was noon. Yun-hee Choi drew the curtains and went on.</p>
<p>“I prepared porridge and soup, and if you have other preferences, I will bring them to you. Is there anything you want to eat?”</p>
<p>Yuri was a little baffled at the moment. By the woman’s words, there seemed to be another person who had prepared the meals … she was even told to not wake her up.</p>
<p><em>Why all this attention?</em></p>
<p>The man was a conundrum, he was brutal yet attentive. He would ravage her in bed, but tend to her in his callous ways. For that matter this woman, Yun-hee Choi… She was definitely not your ordinary housekeeper. She seemed a seasoned hand, someone who had earned her boss’ explicit trust. And here she was, minding an adult in the guise of a butler.</p>
<p>Yuri tried to rise from bed but felt faint. She tried to fist her palm, but felt them numb. It’s only now that she remembered she’d thrown up everything she had eaten; her body lacked strength and food right now.</p>
<p>Yun-hee Choi brought the meal in with quick sense. She noticed the girl struggling, but said nothing simply going about the motions of serving the food.</p>
<p>Yuri sensed her appetite crawl in when she saw the tray of abalone porridge, mushroom cream soup, fruit, and other side dishes. Without a preamble, she slowly started to chew down the food. Right now, her mind was focused on regaining her strength.</p>
<p>When Yuri had eaten as much as she could, Yun-hee Choi spoke again.</p>
<p>“I’ll come back to you after you’ve washed and dressed. There is a doctor’s examination scheduled.</p>
<p>Yuri’s appetite fled top speed at those words. She lowered her spoon, looked at the woman and said in a soft, but assertive tone, “I’m not going to a hospital because there’s no reason to do so.”</p>
<p>“However, the director…”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell him myself. I have another errand to run.” Her stance was loud and clear, she wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>“All right.” Yun-hee Choi could only step back.</p>
<p>Yuri took off her gown in the bathroom after the housekeeper went out with the tray. The red marks and fingerprints on her body reminded her of Tae-jun and the times they spent in bed. She remembered his tongue that ravaged her, the strength that held her, and his body that drove her to sensual pleasures. She breathed in deep and tightly shut her eyes seemingly ridding herself of the thoughts.</p>
<p>She waited until the bathtub filled, stepped in and sat with her knees drawn up making herself as small as possible. As the warm water seeped into the nooks and crannies of her body, her sore muscles started to slowly relax. However, her mind was another matter.</p>
<p>Right now, the memories she’d retraced the night before, inundated her, wreaking havoc in her consciousness. The voices tormented her, a part of her wanted to shut them out, but another part bravely confronted it … it was a conversation.</p>
<p><em><strong>–</strong></em> <em><strong>What idiot lost her? The b*tch’s intoxicated with drugs!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>–</strong></em> <em><strong>There’s an idiot with bloodshot eyes who wanted a chance at the pretty girl. She was smart, whispering that she would let him do as he wished and then escaped. Well, things turned out well since we are going to profit from that idiot. The more important thing is whether President Jin’s daughter is not around.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>–         Don’t worry, I’ve confirmed that the red sportscar is not nearby. Hurry!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>–        That b*tch is fierce and tiresome. Like father, like daughter.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Then, Yuri heard doors break down and felt a heady shock like someone had hit her on the head. </strong></em></p>
<p>A stream of tears trickled down Yuri’s eyes, and she finally realized what the conversation was about … her father’s death. She had vaguely believed he had been in an accident, but it was not true for her father and Hye-yeon Jin. And she was now certain she had stumbled upon an important puzzle piece.</p>
