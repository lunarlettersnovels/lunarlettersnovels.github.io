            <p><strong>Chapter 150</strong></p>
<p>The memory of him became clearer as time passed and choked her in the neck. She thought it was nothing. She thought she was going to forget. However, the time in which she tried not to fill with hatred was instead filled with longing. No matter how hard she denied it, she liked him a lot. No, maybe, she loved him. She loved the man who ruined her life and acted so ruthlessly all the time. It was because she noticed the affection and empathy in him. Only after she could overcome the pain was she able to look back on her frank emotions.</p>
<p>Of course, the epiphany wouldn’t change the present. She simply wanted this phase to be over. She wanted the hatred, the longing, and every other emotion that lingered to vanish.</p>
<p>She shook her head and cleared her mind. Then, she moved her hands over the blank paper. It was that moment when the lights turned off and her room became completely dark.</p>
<p>“Ah, not again!”</p>
<p>The power outage was a frequent occurrence in this house. The landlord was not able to fix anything due to financial issues.</p>
<p>Yuri first opened the window and checked on the other rooms. The room downstairs seemed to be bright with the electricity working normally. Then, there must be a problem in her room. She considered calling the maintenance but decided against it. The maintenance man was always complaining about his sore knees, and she did not want to make them worse.</p>
<p>It was late at night. Should she just go to sleep and ask for help in the morning? But then she remembered the groceries inside the fridge.</p>
<p><em>‘I can’t handle this anymore.’</em></p>
<p>If the problem was only in this room, it was most likely that the leakage breaker was down. She decided to take a look at it at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p>She put on a cardigan over her pajamas and headed to the hallway and opening the cover took a look inside. Just as she expected, it was only her leakage breaker that was down. Was there any potential risk factor around it? She went back to her room to bring her phone and turned on the flashlight to speculate. After deciding there was nothing dangerous, she attempted to pull up the leak breaker. However, it was located too high for her to reach it. She noticed a ladder in the corner and brought it.</p>
<p>She went up the ladder and pulled up the leakage breaker. That moment, a blue spark ignited and made a racket.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh!”</p>
<p>The ladder collapsed because her body shook the moment she felt a stinging sensation in her fingertips. Yuri fell and hit her head on the ground. Her sight was blurred, either from the electric shock or the concussion.</p>
<p>In her cloudy vision, she noticed someone standing in front of her.</p>
<p><em>Who is this?</em></p>
<p>The arms that held her felt so familiar. The hands that rescued her from emergencies… <em>It couldn’t be…</em></p>
<p>She wanted to confirm who the owner of the hands was but succumbed to unconsciousness.</p>
<p><em>⸙⸙⸙</em></p>
<p>The next morning, the very first person Yuri saw when she came around in the hospital was Roy, who was supposed to be in Philadelphia on a long-term business trip.</p>
<p>“How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>She recognized the face that was looking down at her. It belonged to Roy, a face which she’d found familiar just until three years ago. But now, she only blankly looked up at his face, dumbfounded by his appearance before her.</p>
<p>“Roy? When did you come back?”</p>
<p>“Last night. I stopped by your apartment on my way to the studio from the airport.”</p>
<p><em>Well, then it must have been Roy who took me to the hospital. Who in the world am I expecting anyway? While</em> scoffing at her own preposterousness, she expressed her gratitude to the man.</p>
<p>“Thank you for helping me.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“I guess I got shocked when I was trying to turn on the circuit breaker. It made me jump, so I fell off the ladder. “</p>
<p>Roy heaved a deep sigh as she explained. “I was worried as you seemed to have hit your head when you fell. But luckily your tests came out fine. Do you feel any other discomfort?”</p>
<p>Now that he mentioned it, she felt an ache in her right arm. She must’ve hurt it when she fell to the ground. Tests later showed that she had a hairline fracture on her right wrist bone and for that, she would need to receive two weeks of treatment and another two weeks for rehabilitation. She couldn’t believe how soon she was back to the hospital after being all pleased for finally being done with Dr. Davis’s sessions only recently.</p>
<p>But as a consolation, someone who claimed to represent the owner of the apartment had come to visit her, who was grieving over her misfortune. Turns out, he came to tell her that she wouldn’t have to worry about her medical expenses as they would all be borne by the owner.</p>
<p>Truly, Yuri was grateful for the unbidden offer, but on the one hand, she couldn’t help but feel bewildered for the occasion. She wondered what had gotten into the owner all of sudden as he had never even bothered to repair the decrepit facilities of the apartment for his financial reasons.</p>
