            <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 32</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong swallowed hard as fury swirled in Tae-jun’s otherwise expressionless face. He felt like he’d touched this dragon’s inverse scale*: Yuri Han. He shrank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">T/N: An inverse scale grows under a dragon’s chin. It is called so precisely because it is upside down. It happens to be a dragon’s most sensitive part, when touched, a dragon’s outraged to the point of killing. So, here YH is TJ’s inverse scale, right now, he is enraged to the point of destruction.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the chaos, a distant memory resurfaced. In that, his entire body was trembling with rage, just like Tae-jun was now.</span></p>
<p><b><i>“What are you talking about?!”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“I said yes, Mr. Jin’s offer.”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“Yuri Han, are you crazy? Do you know what that means?”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To him, Yuri had always been a radiating, pure being. Beautiful and full of life, just like a fresh summer breeze. That’s how he’d felt from the moment he’d first met Yuri, a middle school student, and lived in the same house. The voice that had shattered the belief that one day she would be his bride was cruel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><b><i>I need some money.”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“Money? You, are you kidding me? You’re gonna do that for money? You’re not that kind of woman!”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“That kind of a woman?! I’m sorry if you thought so. I was just pretending. But, I have problems, which this deal can resolve once and for all.”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“Get a hold of yourself! What do you think he’s gonna do if you agree? He just wants a doll that he can throw away at will! If it is the money you need, I’ll give you that money.”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“It was not him who made the offer but your father, Mr. Jin.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri’s tone was hopelessly calm, there were no emotions in once lively eyes. It looked like she had forsaken everyone… even hope…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A desperate Hye-seong roughly shook her soft shoulders, as if doing so would wake her up. Right then, the breeze swept her hair, revealing a slender neckline. His hands stilled as his gaze fell on the crimson marks that were glaring back at him… the evidence of coition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> His hands trembled…</span></p>
<p><b><i>“You, can’t…”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“Yes, I slept with him.”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“Yuri Han!”</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“It’s nothing special; just a man, a woman.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong’s quivering hand slapped Yuri on the cheek. The sound reverberated, piercing his heart a zillion times.</span></p>
<p><b><i>“Listen to yourself!” </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri shut her eyes tightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he opened his mouth again, his voice quivering. </span><b><i>“I didn’t mean anything bad! I was just…”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri shook off Hye-seong’s hand holding her shoulders. He felt his whole world crumble, despair wreathed his ashen face.</span></p>
<p><b><i>“Do you mean it?”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri’s bitter, heart-wrenching laugh filled the air, drowning Hye-seong’s cries of outrage.</span></p>
<p><b><i>“Sorry.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was her last word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong was awakened from his stupor by the sound of a ‘click’. The next moment, a tremendous shock hit his left shoulder. When he looked down, he saw a scarlet spot steadily growing bigger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not until a few seconds after that Hye-seong realized Jin-wook had shot him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahhhhhh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong rolled on the floor screaming. Hot blood spurted and the fireball seemed to poke his shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun lit a fresh cigarette, looking down at the man squirming and rolling on the floor with impassive eyes. The cigarette smoke rose from his long fingers, adding to the haze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong gritted his teeth and glared at Tae-jun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t believe you asked him to shoot me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I made it clear not to test my patience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun smiled. Then he flicked the cigarette ash over Hye-seong’s wound.</span></p>
<p><b>SCREAM!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the shrieks died, Tae-jun squatted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The damage won’t be serious, no need to worry. It’s snuggly wedged in the bone, and will not damage the internal muscles and tendons. Fortunately, your doctor can handle gunshot wounds, quite a rare talent here in our country. It will be hard to move for months, you’ll feel a little painful for a few decades.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yo-you crazy asshole!” He cursed with clenched teeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun smirked, stubbed the cigarette right before Hye-seong’s eyes, and stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Clean up. Have the staff pay attention to the floor, don’t let the landlord go berserk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He concluded that he had nothing more to gain here so he must leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-wook lowered his gun and his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong shouted behind Tae-jun, who was moving away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You, what if you find Yuri Han?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun stopped walking. His words were like a thunderbolt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to admit she’s the best… given this whole ruse she pulled off. Are you going to bring her in too… and shoot her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a question that was not worthy of an answer. Tae-jun walked without looking back. But as he exited the villa, his face hardened.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was it really money?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had all been obvious, staring him in the face. But he refused to see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, he’d asked President Myung-je Jin to bring the woman as bait for money. Nevertheless, he was rather upset to think that all those times with her was all a pretense, was for ‘money’.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dammit! I should have left two more bullet holes in his shoulder.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun forcefully banged the car door shut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jin-wook, don’t give him painkillers, keep an eye on it for a while.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
