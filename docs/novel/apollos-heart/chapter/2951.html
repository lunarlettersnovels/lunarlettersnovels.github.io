            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 53</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the day and all through the night, Yuri suffered from fever. She was confused about whether she was conscious or not as she walked down the corridor of memories. The long path ended in front of a massive door. The passage crashed down with booming noises as she tried to open it. As she fell into the abyss, someone grabbed her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri woke up with a gasp. She opened her eyes to find a sleeping face in front of her. As she blinked, a ray of light shone through the crack between the curtains on his face. Perhaps she was still dreaming. The person who had held her hand when she fell was Tae-jun.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a dream.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She propped herself up in astonishment. She finally remembered! She did not remember everything yet, but she recognized Tae-jun.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could this be so simple?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How she had pulled, pushed, and did everything she could to open the doors of her memories, and they still stood resolutely shut. But now, they opened on their own accord, revealing the contents and so quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri carefully pulled back, so Tae-jun would not wake up. However, her endeavors were futile as a large hand grabbed her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You seem to be back with us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not waiting for a response, he pressed his hand on her forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your fever is gone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She tried to speak, but her voice was hoarse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun handed her a bottle of water from the side table when he saw her opening and closing her mouth. She managed to get her words out just after cold water moistened her parched throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What happened?” she asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You had a high fever and were sick all night,” he said flatly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri adjusted her breath and met his eyes. “Why did you look for me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun’s eyes narrowed and searchingly stared at Yuri.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did your memories come back? Or was everything just a show from the beginning?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never lied about losing my memory. It is also true that some memories of you have returned to me,” she said defiantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun’s gaze pierced through Yuri as he picked a cigarette. He wanted to hold back, but the woman in front of him always made it impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He asked a question as he lit the cigarette.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why did you disappear four years ago?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My memories have not returned to that extent. I remember what happened up to the night before your business trip.”</span></p>
<p><b>–Flashback begins–</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had started from the desk in the study and ended on the bed in the early morning.</span></p>
<p><b><i>“We won’t be doing this for some time.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Tae-jun wanted sex, he could just find a woman there. She had pushed him away due to fatigue, but he always came back for her.</span></p>
<p><b>–Flashback ends–</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri, unfortunately, remembered even how he had felt against her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun laughed bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t you remember anything unfavorable that had happened to you? How could I believe that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri just looked at him and shrugged. She had no evidence to support her claim of recovering her memories just like she didn’t when she said she lost them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t care whether you believe me or not, but I’m not lying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At her indifference, Tae-jun decided not to push it further and got to the main point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, say you don’t remember why you disappeared. Why were you a stand-in for Hye-yeon Jin? You told me I had made a mistake but kept your mouth closed after talking with President Jin. What did he say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri was visibly agitated. While she had been confident as if she had nothing to hide and looked straight in his, now she had no choice but to turn away from him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want to talk about it,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, you’re exercising your right to remain silent?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri fisted her hands tightly as Tae-jun’s sneer deepened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why do you want to know about that? You should go to President Jin for the answers. He’s the one who started it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was incensed by the mere mention of the man who had kicked off this whole thing. Her desperation and helplessness… that man knew it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would have done exactly that if he were alive. He would have died at my hands, but still.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He died? When?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri was shocked!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“About a month after you disappeared. He got involved in a fight between hoodlums.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not-“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri felt nauseous, and her fingers shook as she heard about Myung-je Jin. The president she remembered was a parasite who would not die no matter how she tried to kill him. Now she knew that both Hye-yeon Jin and he died. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was this only a coincidence?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did you know about me?” she asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I saw you at Hotel Seoin. You, a dead woman, are very much alive and walking to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri finally pieced together the puzzle.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun became curious about Hye-yeon Jin’s death because he saw me. This means he was neither involved in her death nor my disappearance.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Yuri organized her thoughts, Tae-jun seemed to be mocking himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I got to know of something even more shocking. I found the woman I lived and slept with for a year was a completely different person. Do you know how I felt when I didn’t even know the woman I held in my arms?” he asked her with a piercing gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t matter what my name is. I was ‘Hye-yeon Jin’ during our contract.” She nonchalantly replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t matter because it was a contract?” His tone was chilling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri took a breath before meeting his gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, you know our contract has not ended yet?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙ ⸙ ⸙</span></i></p>
