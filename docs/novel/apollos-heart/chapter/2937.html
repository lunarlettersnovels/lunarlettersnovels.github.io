            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 67</strong></p>
<p>Drenched in the stench of alcohol, swaying and staggering, this unkempt man looked nothing like the renowned painter Seok-ha Yoo. However, he was the man himself, perhaps in his truest form.</p>
<p>Fifty-five-year-old Seok-ha Yoo, a famous Western-style painter had won many accolades in the world of paintings and held a prestigious status in Korea and abroad. He was Yuri’s advisory professor, the very one to openly demand s3xual gratifications in return for establishing her career in the realm of arts.</p>
<p>However, when the girl had refused his ‘kind’ offer, he had spared no effort to torment her. In the end, he had succeeded in ruining her budding career for good, thus depriving the world of talent and her hope of living</p>
<p>“Why, isn’t this Yuri Han? My proud and talented student.” His lecherous eyes leered at her from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Unwilling to acknowledge his presence, let alone greet him, Yuri only glared daggers at the man.</p>
<p>“You still look at me so boldly. Aren’t you going to greet me when I’m your teacher?”</p>
<p>The man Tae-jun had left her with immediately blocked Seok-ha when he reached for her.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Seok-ha frowned.</p>
<p>The man, without a change in his expression, asked Yuri, “Madam, do you know this man?”</p>
<p>Yuri only nodded, discomfort evident on her face. Seok-ha sneered as he looked back and forth between the man and Yuri.</p>
<p>“Madam? Ah, Yuri Han, you’ve climbed the ladder. If you’re being called madam and going to this kind of place, you must have secured a man after giving up painting. Didn’t I tell you that you had more talent in pleasing a man than art?”</p>
<p>“And you, more talent in crushing those weaker than you by using underhanded means rather than art.”</p>
<p>“You still-!”</p>
<p>The man stopped Seok-ha again when the older man’s hand rose. He became livid and cursed Yuri.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who your man is, but you’ll never get far in this field. You cheeky bitch, I’ll make sure of that.”</p>
<p>Yuri’s hands balled into fists, she wanted nothing to do with this drunkard anymore. She simply told the man to leave, turned around, and entered the vehicle.</p>
<p>Once in the car, sitting in pin-drop silence, Yuri slowly covered her face. As the events of the day seeped in, her hands trembled.</p>
<p><em>⸙ </em></p>
<p>“I don’t like how you managed this affair.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun took out a cigarette, Jin-wook proceeded to light it. Professor Yang nervously bowed as his boss’ hawk-eyes looked around the room.</p>
<p>“I deeply apologize. Our employees must have been careless during their change in shifts, I will see to it that such a thing will never happen again.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun took a deep drag. <em>Hye-seong Jin disappeared.</em></p>
<p>Today was certainly not going well for the Director of Seoin Group. Department Head Choi had reported that Yuri Han seemed to have cried a lot. <em>Why did she cry?</em> He hated to see her cry alone. Also, she had lied at the department store and went to Jinseong City. If anything, his question of what Yuri was doing there had answered itself more easily than he expected.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Did you meet Hye-seong? Where is he?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Yuri Han was looking for Hye-seong Jin, and this simple fact angered Tae-jun. <em>Had she looked for him even once during the last four years? </em>The end of Tae-jun’s lips twisted coldly.</p>
<p>“Was Incheon his last whereabouts?” He demanded coldly.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have sent someone there.” Jin-wook was already on the matter.</p>
<p>“Why would he do something so impractical when he can’t even move well?”</p>
<p>Jin-wook shook his head. “I don’t know.”</p>
<p><em>What was Hye-seong Jin thinking? </em></p>
<p>Tae-jun contemplated the route his prisoner must have taken during the car ride back. Even after a while, he had no definite answers. He did not have enough information regarding President Jin’s son.</p>
<p>That man had been off the grid for so long now, that people almost thought he was dead. But he would have to wait, he would get that man later. First, he had to know what Yuri wanted to ask Hye-seong Jin.</p>
<p>The house was silent, and Tae-jun looked at the clock to confirm Department Head Choi and the housekeeper had gone home. He did not see Yuri in the living room or the kitchen. Given the happenings of the day, it was quite possible she had gone to bed already.</p>
<p>Tae-jun frowned when he opened the bedroom door because there was no sign of her. He quickly checked the bathroom, but she was not there either.</p>
<p><em>Dammit, did she disappear again?!</em> Tae-jun took out his cell phone and phoned the security team that had brought her home.</p>
<p>“Where is Yuri Han?”</p>
<p>The head of the security team was taken aback.</p>
<p>–  “She should be at home.”</p>
<p>“I can’t see her. Did she go out?” He bellowed.</p>
<p>–  “No, we have been waiting in front of the house. She has to be inside.”</p>
