            <p><strong>Chapter 160 – Tae-jun Side Story (6)</strong></p>
<p>Looking at Yuri, who was moving vividly, he realized once again how much he loves and misses her. He was sweating as he was suppressing the urge to approach her and hold her in his arms.</p>
<p>It was then that Yuri, who filled the cart and was heading to the counter, suddenly turned her head. Her gaze was directly towards Tae-jun. The moment when her eyes filled with him felt as if it would last forever. It was a time of weightlessness as if everything in the world disappeared, leaving only the two of them. He quickly took a step back, grateful for his innate reflexes.</p>
<p>Yuri came straight to where he was, but it was when Tae-jun had already left. He quietly stared at the girl who was looking around. He neither wanted to sway her mind nor be swayed himself. He had my heart set on giving her up.</p>
<p>After paying, Yuri left the supermarket and headed to the apartment. Tae-jun followed, leaving quite a distance between her. He was standing opposite the apartment in front of him, gazing at the last room on the fifth floor. At first, he planned to go back only after seeing the lights come on. But he stayed there a little longer and longer until the lights eventually went out in the room. It was then that he realized he had been there for quite some time. He didn’t even know how time had passed. It was like a dream. A dream with Yuri Han. And now it was time to return to reality without Yuri Han.</p>
<p>He let out a small sigh, and just as he turned around, the window opened. It was Yuri’s room. Soon after, she leaned her head out the window and looked at the house below.</p>
<p><em>Did something happen?</em></p>
<p>Yuri immediately closed the window.</p>
<p><em>It won’t be a big deal. Since the building is old, there must have been a power outage.</em></p>
<p>He thought so and tried to leave, but his body didn’t move. An inexplicable feeling strangled him like a snare. It was a hunch he never missed. He stepped inside the apartment. Perhaps because it was a late hour, the manager wasn’t there.</p>
<p>It was when he went up to the fourth floor by the stairs…</p>
<p><em><strong>Kyaa!</strong></em></p>
<p>He heard a sharp scream. As he jumped up the stairs at once, what came into Tae-jun’s view was a ladder and an unconscious Yuri.</p>
<p><em>What happened? Did she hit her head?</em></p>
<p>“Yuri Han!”</p>
<p>Yuri’s eyelids trembled at the sound of her name being called out, but she seemed to have lost consciousness. Tae-jun lifted her up her, frantically went down the stairs, and caught a taxi.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>Roy, who came to the hospital after receiving a call at the airport, couldn’t hide the surprise on his face. In front of him were Yuri and Tae-jun lying on a hospital bed. He looked at Tae-jun and Yuri, who had lost consciousness.</p>
<p>“How come you are… Wait but what happened to Yuri?”</p>
<p>“She hit her head as she fell down from a ladder. It’s a mild concussion, but the exact after-effects can be known when her consciousness comes back.”</p>
<p>“What happened to you? Are you two together again?”</p>
<p>“No, that won’t happen. I had to come to America. I wanted to see where Yuri lives while here.”</p>
<p>“How did you know where Yuri lives? And how do you know my number?”</p>
<p>“I can easily find it if I want it.”</p>
<p>Roy opened his mouth with a face as if he realized something fishy.</p>
<p>“You put someone on watch, right?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Don’t act like you don’t know. There was one employee at the agency who had a crush on Yuri, and one day he came back with his heart in his mouth. He said that there was a man who threatened him. From then on, I thought it was strange, but seeing you today makes things clearer.”</p>
<p>“…That’s not what I did.”</p>
<p>“Whatever it is, isn’t it true that you hired a person to watch Yuri? And that person is skillfully threatening the men around her.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t refute his words. Roy seemed to have accepted Tae-jun’s silence as tacit acceptance.</p>
<p>He asked, his face confuzzled, “So what are you going to do? Are you going to leave Yuri like that?”</p>
<p>“That is her decision, I’ll do my best to protect her… because that’s the only thing I can do. So I don’t want her to know about what happened today. Let’s say you helped her out.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun took out his business card from his wallet.</p>
<p>“This is my number. If there’s any issue when she wakes up, please contact me. If there’s none, I will return to Korea.”</p>
<p>Roy stared at Tae-jun’s face without saying a word. Tae-jun could see his eyes asking if that’s all he wanted to say. He (TJ) tried hard to ignore that gaze.</p>
