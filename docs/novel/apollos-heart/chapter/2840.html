            <p><strong>Chapter 165 – After Story (2)</strong></p>
<p>Tae-jun went straight to his dressing room, took off his clothes, and took a shower. A hot shower alleviated the fatigue of a long flight. After taking a long shower, he left the bathroom. His wife was still in a deep sleep but he couldn’t. This was because he had not yet adapted to the time difference and was in a state of dissatisfaction. He could tell that he would be tossing and turning all night if he lay beside Yuri right now.</p>
<p>Closing the bedroom door slightly as he left, he went to the library. He desperately needed alcohol. He took out a whiskey and a glass from the home bar on the other side of the library. Then he poured the golden liquid that filled the glass into his mouth. The high alcohol content of this water of life was not bad. He seemed to have no problem falling asleep with a couple of drinks.</p>
<p>When he went for a second glass, there was a knock and the door opened. It was Director Choi.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“I saw the lights were on in the library. Do you want me to prepare some snacks for your drink?”</p>
<p>“No need. I will sleep after finishing this glass.”</p>
<p>Director Choi didn’t move but was rather hesitating unlike usual.</p>
<p>“Is there something you want to say?”</p>
<p>“Ah….. So, it’s about Madam.”</p>
<p>“Yuri? Why?”</p>
<p>“I think it won’t be a bad idea for her to take a test….”</p>
<p>Tae-jun’s face stiffened at the word ‘test’. He knew better than anyone what the ‘test’ that came out of Director Choi’s mouth meant. Not many people in the house knew about Yuri’s physical condition, who’s at risk for Alzheimer’s. Jin-wook and Jin-ho, the deputy director who became the director of Seoin Hospital, and Director Choi, were the only ones who knew about it. In particular, Tae-jun trusted Director Choi, who had been watching him since he was a shooter when it came to managing Yuri’s health. She could detect, like a ghost, what the person she cared for was uncomfortable and what was different. Since the word ‘test’ came out of Choi’s mouth, it was absolutely not something that could be taken lightly.</p>
<p>“Since when? There wasn’t any sign when she had a test half a year ago.”</p>
<p>Yuri was undergoing a brain examination along with a health checkup every year. Fortunately, she had not shown any signs so far.</p>
<p>“I think it’s been about a month and a half. At that time, I thought it was because she was tired from preparing for the exhibition, but she has been like that until recently. In particular, it seems that she is feeling very tired and depressed.”</p>
<p>“So she’s been sleeping like that all the time, not just today?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She didn’t exercise or paint recently. There also wasn’t any special outdoor schedule. It’s not even that she doesn’t sleep at night, but she often sleeps continuously during the day.”</p>
<p>Ominous evidence emerged. Tae-jun crossed his arms and fell into deep thought. Among the substances that have been identified as the cause of Alzheimer’s, there is a protein called ‘tau’. This protein component induces sleep by damaging the part of the human brain responsible for daytime arousal. If a patient in the high-risk group for Alzheimer’s suddenly has frequent naps, the onset of the disease is questionable. He spoke, trying to calm his trembling voice in anxiety.</p>
<p>“Anything else? How about her memory?”</p>
<p>“It seems that there are no problems with her memory yet. She has no problem with her sense of time and numbers. Still, a sudden increase in sleep is not a good sign. Taking the test is necessary.”</p>
<p>Director Choi emphasized the last words. Yes, the test was needed. While recognizing the fact, Tae-jun made a face as if the world was collapsing. Seoin Pharmaceutical and Seoin Hospital had made unrivaled progress in the field of dementia and Alzheimer’s research over the past few years. In particular, after Tae-jun became chairman, it had grown in a short period into the cash cow industry of the Seoin Group. Those who were skeptical that he would soon go bankrupt when he aggressively led the business by pouring in investments, now praised the young president’s determination. But even in that situation, Alzheimer’s was still close to unknown territory. Even with dozens of patents and dozens of new drugs owned by Seoin Group, there was no 100% prevention or cure. So, the fact that Yuri might have developed the disease was only terrifying.</p>
<p>Tae-jun listened to the rain all night, reviewing research data and clinical follow-up data. To get even a glimmer of hope that might be somewhere. By the time he returned to his bedroom, the rain had stopped and it was dawn. He stood there for a while beside Yuri who was asleep, then went up to the bed and lay down. Even in her sleep, she moved in between his arms like a habit.</p>
<p><em>‘There must be a way.  No matter what, I will find a way. To not lose you.’</em></p>
<p>He kissed her on the top of her head and held her.</p>
<p><em>⸙⸙⸙</em></p>
