            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 14 – Traces of Her</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Kim also received a box from Jae-won, who kept chattering nonstop. It would be a wonder if anyone could squeeze in a word let alone a whole sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It really has an amazing taste. The combination of chicken and chives is fantastic.” He beamed as if he was the one to have personally made them. “Will the meeting inside take long?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. It will end very soon. Mr. Seo will leave at lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pointed words of Ms. Kim made Mr. Lee clear his throat. The couple was willing to meet for a business meeting, but couldn’t spare time for a short lunch together.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How odd!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Ms. Kim had said, a staff member went out of the conference room, just minutes from lunch.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won simply nodded at him, and boldly, peeped at the now open door. Inside, two people sat facing each other, engrossed in the document in hand. It was anything but a romantic sight.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, who can say they are newly engaged?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Si-yeon’s eyes were glued to the papers she held. When she looked up turning a page, she caught sight of Jae-won walking in. She instantly brightened and greeted him cheerfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What brings you here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tae-jun sitting opposite also noticed his cousin’s arrival. He took off the glasses perched upon his aristocratic nose and rubbed the area between his eyes. Without his spectacles concealing his features, his gaze now looked sharper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bare face, Jae-won could finally see his sour mood. Soon, his cousin’s pointed gaze landed on his own full hands. Mr.Chatterbox decided to break the silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I brought dim sums from Seohwadang. If you haven’t had lunch yet, let’s have one each.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you come here just to bring dim sums?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He shook his head. “It’s Director Seo’s birthday in a few days. I went out to buy a gift and stopped by Seohwadang on my way back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Si-yeon perked up in her seat as she heard of this. “Oh, that brings to mind–I will have to buy a gift too. I got an expensive painting as an engagement gift, so I’ll have to reciprocate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her hands dug into the bag, which still had several boxes of dim sums, and handed one over to her fiancé. “Take this, Tae-jun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a cold-hearted man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">— was the first thought that came to Jae-won’s mind as soon as he saw the scene unveiling right before him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To save Si-yeon from embarrassment, he quickly interjected. “If you don’t have any appointments for lunch, just take one so that my efforts won’t be in vain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, Tae-jun had no choice but to take the lunchbox. And as his habit, upon opening it, he divided the dim sums into half with his chopsticks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you doing that? Cutting the dim sums in half when you can just swallow it whole?” Upon seeing the bizarre habit, Jae-won couldn’t help but ask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s hot.” Tae-jun instinctively responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was characterized by hot body temperature. Meaning, while the average temperature was between 36.5–37.5 °C, his was slightly on the higher side. As a result, he hated hot food and even drank iced coffee in the middle of winters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he did so, the tantalizing smell of chicken and chives permeated the air. But instead of devouring the delicacy before him, a frown marred Tae-jun’s flawless features. Dropping his chopsticks, he pushed the box away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won inquired with an odd face. “Don’t you like it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not my type.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But, why did you take me there befo–” Jae-won murmured to himself and stopped just in time when he realized the presence of a third person in the room, even if it was his best friend and the other’s fiancée.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew Tae-jun liked a girl, who used to love these dim sums before. Her name was Hye-yeon Jin. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How far had his search for her come?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, but it was the second time today that this chatterbox’s slipup did not go unnoticed. The quick-witted Si-yeon had immediately caught on to the strange reaction, so she stared at her bestie with wide, curious eyes tacitly demanding an explanation. In his defense, the latter quickly changed the subject and shook off his friend’s inquisitive gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, about the upcoming exhibition in the lobby of Hotel Seoin, why not recommend the works of Roy Jean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roy Jean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He is a Korean-American artist popular for his sculptures in America. It would be good to feature his works here in Daejin Department Store. I’ve met his assistant too. It will be easy to bring them into an agreement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s up to you.” Tae-jun held his documents with a stoic face and stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you leaving?” Si-yeon asked with surprise.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are done. I will send you the draft of the plan after modifying it as per your request.” And with that, Tae-jun went out as cold as winter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won clicked his tongue. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder Ms. Kim is displeased.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, Si-yeon, the person involved, showed interest in other things instead of her uncaring fiance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why ‘Roy Jean’?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The exhibition is in the lobby of Hotel Seoin. Didn’t the exclusive artists of Seoin Gallery usually do it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a decision made during an internal meeting of the planning team. There is a rumor that the tax investigation will be reinforced, so if possible, I am planning to recruit artists from overseas. And quality-wise, I like his artwork. To add to that, he is one of your favorite artists.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the catch? I thought you were not interested in him. Is it because of Ms. Yuri Han?” Her eyes flashed with mischievousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know how to separate business from pleasure,” Jae-won replied defensively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t have the desire to tell Si-yeon that he’d met Yuri a while ago in Seohwadang. She would only tease him further and he was not going to give her the pleasure. All this time, he remained curious.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did she eat the dim sums I gave her?</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>⸙⸙⸙</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are.. are you leaving already?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Lee, who was in the office pantry, popping one dim sum in his mouth, stood up when he saw Tae-jun coming out from the Si-yeon’s office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But… Jae-won came just now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Should that be relevant to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Lee’s eyes reflexively found Ms. Kim. He tried to discern her reaction. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won was his cousin, and Si-yeon was his fiancée. Would a little time spent with them hurt?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the engagement was far from being romantic–it was only for the sole purpose of convenience. But, is it okay for him to let her fiancée have a closer relationship with another man, not to mention, his cousin?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun handed over the document to him. Mr. Lee nodded to Ms. Kim and followed his boss in haste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two walked into the elevator, Tae-jun pressed the button for the basement. Soon </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deep into thoughts about Jin-wook’s latest report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was still no trace of her. When he was trying to find Hye-yeon Jin, he had not much idea about her. Her father was Jin Myung-je, the CEO, and her brother was Hye-seong Jin. She majored in sculpture from H Art university. Those were the only things he knew about her.</span></p>
