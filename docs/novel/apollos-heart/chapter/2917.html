            <p><strong>Chapter 87</strong></p>
<p>Tae-jun’s gorgeous face frowned. “Do I need to repeat myself?”</p>
<p>“I apologize. Is it a gift? May I see the profile…?”</p>
<p>Usually, Tae-jun would hand Song a profile of the woman when he was looking for a gift. Then, Song would choose something befitting and gift wrap it. She would diligently save all of the profiles she was handed on her tablet so as to avoid recommending the same outfits in the future.</p>
<p>The young director would usually prepare gifts for his aunts and female cousins, or important women in his business. This time, his fiancée Si-yeon was added to that list.</p>
<p>Tae-jun stopped Song, who was going through the previous profiles.</p>
<p>“It’s fine; I’ll choose myself.”</p>
<p>The boutique manager’s fingers involuntarily slid off the tablet screen. <em>Choose by himself?</em>  What she heard was simply unbelievable. <em>A person who would not even choose his own outfits wants to choose a gift for someone else?</em></p>
<p>Song tried her best to keep her polite smile on and not reveal the shock in her heart. “Of course. This way please.”</p>
<p>But it seemed like today was the day when Manager Song’s emotions would be put to test and how. Before she could recompose herself from the initial shock, the man carelessly tossed her into a maze. The clothes he was choosing right now, to be precise the feminine pencil skirt or the long flared dress, weren’t meant for a petite woman with a glamorous body figure like Si-yeon’s. Rather they did justice to the slender and tall ones with a fashion-model like figure.</p>
<p><em>When was it?</em> She remembered the clothes Tae-jun bought one day. Early in the morning he had randomly summoned her to his office and handed her a shopping bag with heels and clothes, and asked her to come back in an hour with an outfit, innerwear, and heels of the same size.  That was the first time Tae-jun ordered her to do so in three years.</p>
<p>The clothes back then were also for a woman of the same body type …</p>
<p>Tae-jun meticulously scoured over ten outfits, four pairs of heels, three bags, and even lingerie. In the end, he said to wrap them up in a gift box and he would send people over to collect it.</p>
<p>He spent so much money during his thirty minutes shopping, but there was not a trace of vexation or displeasure. Pure delight laced his handsome visage, with excitement lingering on. However, that excitement disappeared as soon as he saw a decked up Si-yeon walking out.</p>
<p>Manager Song escorted the pair of VIPs and wrapped the outfits Tae-jun had chosen.</p>
<p>Just then, one of the employees hurried over to the boss with a query. “Manager, the Louboutins Mr. Seo chose a few minutes ago are out of size 36. We only have size 38 left. Should I contact the S Department Store for the same design?”</p>
<p>Si-yeon wore a size 36. The good employee who helped Si-yeon get dressed seemed to have remembered this and diligently brought the matter over to the boss. It would be embarrassing for the company to make any kind of mistake, to say nothing of an important thing such a size.</p>
<p>However, Song shook her head. “No, size 38 is correct.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? But-”</p>
<p>“Haven’t I told you not to be overly interested in a customer’s privacy? If a word about this gets out, we’re all doomed.”</p>
<p>The employee was discouraged at the unjust reprimand. <em>That woman</em> <em>was a size 38.</em> <em>Who was that woman? Was she a celebrity? A model?</em> Song forgot about how she just berated her employee for being nosy and shook her legs from curiosity.</p>
<p>The art center where the ceremony was held was illuminated with fancy lights. Tae-jun and Si-yeon got out of the car, and their assistants led them inside.</p>
<p>The hall was already crowded with people. When the two entered the room, they had the attention of every eyeball there was. The couple’s wealth and beauty were more than enough to enrapture those in attendance. They were a match made in heaven.</p>
<p>Su-Kwang Lee greeted them with the widest smile. “You are very welcome here. How’s your grandfather, Director Seo?”</p>
<p>“He’s doing very well. Thanks for asking.” Tae-jun replied coldly.</p>
<p>“When’s the wedding?” The cheery ex-politician asked, not at all minding the bland replies</p>
<p>“It’s going to be next year.” Another dull reply.</p>
<p>“The chairman must be very pleased. He’s always wanted great-grandchildren.” Su-Kwang Lee laughed excitedly.</p>
<p>Tae-jun and Si-yeon shared a few pleasantries with him and walked around the hall to say hello to the others. Everyone they greeted mentioned their wedding. Tae-jun knew they did not take their upcoming nuptials seriously and rather treated it as fat meat of gossip. Not that he cared about his own marriage, but the idea of being the butt of their sadistic pleasure, didn’t sit well with him.</p>
<p>When they’d finally walked around the entire hall greeting and meeting, something caught his attention. With great flair and fan following in came the presidential hopeful, In-Bae Lee. With a bright grin, he vigorously shook hands with Su-Kwang Lee. From time to time, laughter erupted from the small circle formed around the two men.</p>
<p>Tae-jun’s cold, gimlet eyes trailed the man’s every movement. How he spoke, his mannerism and every bit of detail was registered in his mind.</p>
<p>“I heard he is to be appointed as an official candidate. He seems to have a very strong support base.” Si-yeon whispered to Tae-jun.</p>
<p>“I see.” His tone was non-committal, concealing well his thoughts.</p>
<p>“I heard Kook Noh is a strong candidate for the opposing party.” She added.</p>
<p>“He’s not influential enough to be a rival.” He replied.</p>
<p>“I agree with you, but we never know. There is still time until the election.”</p>
<p>They had known each other since childhood, but there was only one thing the two had in common- objective outlook. In that, they were identical: weighing their pros and cons, meticulously choosing their friends and foes, and never giving in to their impulse. Though young, they had never let their emotions come in the way of making a decision. Well, whether the duo even possessed emotions, was entirely another matter. As such,</p>
<p>when they tied the knot, there was little wonder they would make the perfect pair of business partners. But that was it.</p>
<p>Right then, Su-Kwang Lee beckoned the would-be’s over. He introduced In-bae Lee to them with great gusto.</p>
<p>In-bae offered a handshake with a kind smile. “It’s an honor to meet the hottest couple of the year. I’ve met Ms. Yoon before, but it’s my first time seeing you, Mr. Seo. You really do resemble Chairman Seo in his early years. ”</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to meet you. I’ve heard a lot about you from Myeong-je Jin. I heard you two were close friends.” Tae-jun looked at the man in the eye and delivered his greetings.</p>
