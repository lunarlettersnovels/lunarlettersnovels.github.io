            <p><strong>Chapter 79</strong></p>
<p>When she turned to look at him, Tae-jun reached out to the black box to turn the power off. Yuri stared at him curiously.</p>
<p>“What are you-?”</p>
<p>Before she could finish her sentence, her seat was pulled back. Tae-jun attached himself onto her body and roughly pressed his lips onto hers and unzipped her dress.</p>
<p>“Wa …Wait!” Yuri grabbed his hands bringing him to a halt.</p>
<p>“Does it have to be… HERE?”</p>
<p>They were a staircase away from home. At home, there was a large soft bed. Yuri couldn’t understand why this man was throwing his body onto her in the car at a parking lot.</p>
<p>Tae-jun was not pleased when she stopped him. He raised his eyebrows and pulled down her hands. His hard member was bulging in his pants. Yuri was so surprised that she tried to get away from him, but he stopped her.</p>
<p>“I was like this the whole time I was driving … All because I want to pen3trate you.” His voice dropped, his head even more.</p>
<p>He impatiently took off her br@ and devoured her brea*ts. Yuri could feel his tongue teasing her flesh. His hand was already playing around with her private area underneath her underwe@r. As her cl!t was rubbed, she cried out in rapture.</p>
<p>“I want to shove mine into you and come inside you-” He mumbled, while a long finger made it into her entrance. She arched her head back as the sharp sensation assaulted her senses. His moist tongue l!cked her neckline and yet another finger made its way in. “- until it squirts out of you.”</p>
<p>“Oh … Hmm~.” Muffled moans slipped her lips, she turned her head to the side.</p>
<p>“You’re getting wet easily now.”</p>
<p>Satisfied and excited by her response, his fingers wandered inside her. He started to kiss her lips. Her cave greedily swallowed his fingers, tightening around them firmly soaking them in her juices. His trail of kisses made their way downwards to her neck and rosy buds. By now, her whole body was bathed in a hue of wine under the ministrations of the man intoxicated by pleasure.</p>
<p>Now that her den was moist enough, he retrieved his fingers, stripped his pants, and freed his throbbing shaft. Then, immediately grabbing her ankles, he placed them on top of the seat.</p>
<p>“What are you doing!”</p>
<p>Yuri was startled to find herself sitting in a position that resembled a perfect “M”. Her hidden features were so visible.</p>
<p>“Licking it, of course.” His lu*stful eyes never once left her honeypot.</p>
<p>“No, just … let’s just do it … I haven’t even washed-”</p>
<p>Other than being inundated, she hadn’t taken a proper shower. She felt disgusted at the thought. However, Tae-jun did not stop and spread her folds with his finger. It was completely w*t from excitement. It looked quite delicious to his eyes.</p>
<p>Tae-jun tickled her den, Yuri helplessly squirmed. He then opened up her legs further.</p>
<p>“You know that your scent turns me on so h@rd?” Tae-jun growled.</p>
<p>Her heavy breathing made him crazy. Her soft mo@ns were music to his ears.</p>
<p>Yuri could not help but twist her waist. Her legs were wide apart, and her tongue was trembling. She tried to stop the man attacking her cherry with his tongue, but her ankles were firmly held. It was going to leave a mark, a symbol that represented her everlasting attachment to Tae-jun.</p>
<p>Whenever his tongue moved into her, she squeezed her toes from the tickling sensation. Her sensual voice rang through the car.</p>
<p>“Hmm… my… goodness-” She could not stop the notes of plea*ure leaving her full lips. Suddenly, her body froze and unrestrained rained over the leather seat.</p>
<p>“I should change the seat covers.” A pleased Tae-jun murmured.</p>
<p>Yuri was busy panting when he pulled down his pants. His already erect rod glided smoothly into her hold. She arduously held back her scream.</p>
<p>Tae-jun sank as deep as he could, zealously swaying his hips. It was his first time indulging at a place other than a bedroom. He was mightily ar0used, and the woman’s sensuous appearance, still bathed in the afterglow, excited him even further.</p>
<p>Her core desperately played with his manhood. He let out a groan as he fell into a pattern of going back and forth. Her body joined his rhythm, moving up and down. When his thrust hit her hard, she felt herself on the brink of losing sanity. The car shook as the pair arduously plunged into the ocean of coit@l ple@sure.</p>
<p>When she peaked, he too basked in his ecstasy, pouring his seed into her, until the last moment. When she felt the hot liquid disperse inside of her, she firmly held onto his sturdy back, trembling.</p>
<p>But he didn’t pull out. As he peppered her with kisses and fondled her domes, the one-eyed monster stood upright declaring his stance.</p>
<p><em>Again? Here? </em></p>
<p>Before she could come to terms, they’d switched position. She snuggly sat atop him, as he worked her hips. As the slapping of flesh transitioned into a carnal bliss in the enclosed car, the air filled with a damp, squishy noise.</p>
<p>The second round lasted longer than the first. Unlike before, they were even more passionate as they let loose themselves, surrendering to the other. This was different from all the other times in which one dominated the other one. This time their actions and feelings were mutual.</p>
<p>Yuri swayed in a seductive dance, unbridled she rode him … discovering and rediscovering the sensu@lity. Tae-jun immersed himself in the whirlpool of seduction and thrill embracing an euphoria he had never experienced.</p>
<p>After their long, amorous interplay, she lay nestled in his warmth. She heaved, face radiating her inner ecstasy as she pressed her forehead onto the taut shoulder. Reveling in this bliss, his sturdy arms enveloped her, gently stroking her back as he lowered his lips to her neck.</p>
<p>Time stood still as a serene silence shrouded the entwined bodies, allowing them to etch this moment in their hearts … forever.</p>
