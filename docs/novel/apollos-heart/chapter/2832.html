            <p><strong>Chapter 173 – Side Story (4)</strong></p>
<p>The child who could stand alone and walk little by little was now quite heavy.<em> This kid doesn’t think about his mom who needs to hold him with a waist as small as my fist. Does a child also have some kind of presentiment?</em></p>
<p>Normally, he would eat and fall asleep right away, but he was holding his mother’s collar tightly with his eyes half-closed. Seeing her husband coming in, Yuri smiled in relief.</p>
<p>“Go get changed first. I think Jihoo will fall asleep soon.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun changed after taking a quick shower. When he went back to the room, Jihoo was already sleeping. When he took him from Yuri and was about to hold him in his arms, the baby woke up.</p>
<p>Tae-jun soothed his son, who was about to cry again. “Don’t cry Jihoo. Your dad is here.”</p>
<p>“Mama?”</p>
<p>“Papa, not mama.”</p>
<p>Jihoo seemed relieved seeing his dad and went back to sleep. While Tae-jun was rocking Jihoo, Yuri finished getting ready to go to the hospital. She lightly kissed Jihoo’s forehead who was in deep sleep.</p>
<p>“See you later, my son. Tae-jun, please take care of Jihoo.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. But what about me?” He pointed at his lips.</p>
<p>Yuri also gave him a light kiss.</p>
<p>He whispered with his lips touching hers, “I hope the test results are good.”</p>
<p>He saw her off and carefully laid Jihoo on the crib. He looked like an angel sleeping peacefully. Of course, when this angel would open his eyes, he would start crying again. Tae-jun gazed at Jihoo’s face. A soft forehead and thick double eyelids resembled his mother. He was a beautiful child.</p>
<p>Tae-jun felt strange watching his son. This little baby had his and Yuri’s blood. When he stroked his fluffy hair, a small hand grabbed his finger. For some reason, his touch made Tae-jun almost burst into tears. Suddenly, he remembered the dream he had when Yuri was pregnant with Jihoo.</p>
<p><em><strong>“To me, every moment I spent with you was a miracle and happiness. So I also want you to experience happiness and miracles with your son just like me, Tae-jun.”</strong></em></p>
<p>As his father said, Yuri and Jihoo were a miracle and happiness in his life. For the first time, he was with people who loved him as much as he loved them. He wished this moment would last forever.</p>
<p>“But let’s grow up a little faster Jihoo Seo. For your mom.”</p>
<p>Jihoo pursed his lips in his sleep as if answering his father. Tae-jun smiled and laid his body next to the baby’s bed on the mattress where Yuri slept. Sadly, the peaceful time didn’t last long. Jihoo, whose diaper was wet, woke up crying. After changing the diaper and soothing his son who was looking for his mother, it was already time to feed the baby. He gave him the baby food that the babysitter brought.</p>
<p>“Jihoo Seo. Say papa. Pa. Pa.”</p>
<p>“Mama.”</p>
<p>“Papa.”</p>
<p>“Mama.”</p>
<p>It seemed like it was still difficult for Jihoo to say papa.</p>
<p>“Jihoo Seo, when are you going to call me papa?”</p>
<p>Jihoo didn’t know what his dad wanted. After finishing the baby food, he seemed anxious and began looking around as if he was looking for his mother. Noticing, the babysitter quickly brought a box of blocks that the baby liked.</p>
<p>“Look at this, Jihoo.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, Jihoo showed interest in the colorful blocks she brought. When he left Jihoo with the sitter to take a rest for a while, his phone rang. It was Yuri.</p>
<p>“Is the test done?”</p>
<ul>
<li>“I only took the cerebral function test because I was late. The doctor said I’m fine”</li>
</ul>
<p>“Thank god.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun sighed in relief. Yuri asked…</p>
<ul>
<li>“How about Jihoo? What is he doing now?”</li>
</ul>
<p>“He’s playing with blocks. By the way, Jihoo can take about five to six steps now.”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Right, he’s walking well these days. But isn’t he looking for me? I miss my Jihoo.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“You only miss Jihoo?”</p>
<p>Yuri laughed at his disappointed tone.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Of course, I miss you too. I still have a few tests to take. I will be a bit late so please take good care of Jihoo.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“Okay, see you later. Love you.”</p>
<ul>
<li>“I love you too.”</li>
</ul>
<p>As he hung up, he discovered that Jihoo, who was playing with blocks, was staring at him. Suddenly his heart started beating faster. <em>‘Did he notice that I just received a call from his mom? What if he starts crying all of a sudden looking for Yuri? Besides blocks, what other toys does he like?’ </em>Tae-jun was fully focused on his son, thinking about what would happen next.</p>
<p>“Pa, pa!”</p>
<p>The word came out of the child’s mouth who was smiling brightly like a flower bud in full bloom. Tae-jun, lost for words, stared at the angelic face for a moment. It was the joy that the miracle that came to him gave.</p>
