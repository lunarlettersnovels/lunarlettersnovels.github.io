            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 6<b> – Addictive</b></strong></p>
<p>It was an unexpected request. He thought, once again, she was bold. Tae-Jun smirked and broke the cigarette that he was holding between his lips without lighting up then threw it along with the others into the ashtray.</p>
<p>“That’s a difficult condition. But, okay, I will try.”</p>
<p>Tae-Jun stretched out his hand. Surprised by the hand that suddenly approached her face, Hye-Yeon curled up but gave up as soon as she realized her position. She closed her eyes while his hand stroked her face. His delicate fingers trailed down from her forehead to her nose, then down her lips.</p>
<p>Gently, his fingers drew circles along her lips. His mellow voice drifted to her ear.</p>
<p>“Here’s the deposit. Take a shower and get ready.”</p>
<p>While Hye-Yeon entered the bathroom, Tae-Jun undid his tie and the cuffs. He went on to unbutton his shirt, loosen the collar and poured himself another glass of wine. She was taking longer than he’d expected. But he was determined to be patient.</p>
<p>By the time Hye-Yeon got out of the bathroom, he’d half-emptied his third glass of wine. By how she was clutching her robe which would be taken off anyway, he could tell that she was nervous.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because he was starting to feel tipsy. He felt rushed by the fresh scent effusing from her. All he could think of was hurrying to taste her.</p>
<p>In his haste, he hurriedly tried to take her dress off. His rough gesture sent a shiver down her spine. She looked at him, scared.</p>
<p>“I am a v!rgin.”</p>
<p>Her unexpected confession stopped his hands trying to pull down the dress. He thought she had a boyfriend. He grinned.</p>
<p>“It’s my first time sleeping with a v!rgin.”</p>
<p>He lifted her chin up and made her meet his eyes. Her eyes were still full of anxiety. Tae-Jun held out a glass of wine.</p>
<p>“Do you want some wine? It can help you relax,” he said.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel like getting drunk now.”</p>
<p>Honestly, he was afraid she’d bite her tongue right away, but she stood buff. Tae-Jun pulled her chin to put his lips to hers. Her lips were sweet. Her soft tongue and saliva were as sweet as her lips. Having tasted her for so long that his t0ngue was tingling, Tae-Jun moved his lips to her ears with a satisfied look.</p>
<p>“Let me treat you well.”</p>
<p>His nimble hand moved along her body and dropped her dress on the floor. In turn, he also stripped off her underw3ar. Her naked body was breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>He had imagined her bare body several times. He knew it would be his type, but he liked it much more in reality. He liked her white skin, long arms and legs and not big but perfect sized bre@sts as well.</p>
<p>Her body trembled greatly as he grabbed her bosom and put her pink nipple in his mouth. She was pretty sensitive.</p>
<p>With Tae-jun’s skillful caresses, Hye-Yeon bit her lips, her eyes tightly shut. He wanted to see her other facial expressions, and just couldn’t take his eyes off of her… The expressions she gave upon discovering new sensations fascinated him.</p>
<p>In addition, her body was so addictively tasty that it was not a waste to go slow with her. Her whole body was soft, sweet and moist. The more he tasted it, the more he was thirsty to indulge it.</p>
<p>It was not long until Hye-yeon felt the foot of a bed behind her, and Tae-jun gentle laid her down atop it. As the large man joined her, the soft mattress sunk under his weight. She was underneath him.</p>
<p>His lips, which wandered around her body to quench his thirst, headed to her lady garden. Hye-Yeon, who was holding back the sound so much that her hand holding the bed sheet turned white, shouted embarrassedly.</p>
<p>“What are you doing..!”</p>
<p>The frightened woman struggled, but he held her spread legs firmly. He opened up her already wet lab!a and excited the cl*toris with his tongue. She shivered. He placed his head to her lady parts and kept exploring her cave. She, who had been suppressing her m0ans, jerked out her words with a sobbing sound.</p>
<p>“No, please. Just do it without this part.”</p>
<p>His member was pretty huge and long. As for a woman who has had a lot of experience could take it, but Hye-Yeon would barely be able endure.</p>
<p>“Stay still. You will thank me later.”</p>
<p>He continued licking her cl*toris with the tip of his tongue and put his finger inside of her. Her vu*va, which was too tight to have no more than one finger a moment ago, had become much softer. Opening up a narrow, stiff spot, he added another finger. As his fingers continued to penetrate her, his mouth didn’t stop sucking her hardened bud.</p>
<p>Finally, Hye-Yeon twisted herself and moaned. “Ah, aaaaahh!”</p>
<p>Hye-Yeon quivered slightly. The groan that escaped her mouth for the first time turned him on extremely. Only after seeing that her whole body was soaked with his saliva, did Tae-Jun raise his head with great satisfaction. Hye-Yeon’s eyes were blurry and in tears.</p>
<p>He touched the entrance between her legs with his finger. Her wet folds were still quivering as if it was ready to suck his fingers inside.</p>
<p>“This will do.”</p>
<p>He took off his pants and brought out the c0ndom he had prepared.</p>
