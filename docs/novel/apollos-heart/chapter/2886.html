            <p><strong>Chapter 119 – I Want You | 19 (1)</strong></p>
<p>He let out a sigh of relief as he pulled her into his chest, and pressed his face against her shoulder. He attacked her neck with relentless kisses, his lips glided along the expanse of her throat, chin and the apples of her cheeks. It was as if he’s committing her to memory, taking in every inch of her his lips could reach. He tightened his grip around her waist, securing her to him as he placed a lingering kiss onto her collarbones. Yuri stifled a giggle, slightly ticklish.</p>
<p>Tae-jun’s hand made its way under her shirt as he fondled her breast, his face still tucked against her neck. Yuri could feel how hot his breaths were getting.</p>
<p>He pulled his face away and captured Yuri’s lips with his own. Their mouths fused together in a searing kiss as Tae-jun’s hand smoothened her back, fidgeting on the clasps of her bra as he unbuckled it, and took it off with one swift motion. He then sucked on her neck, and Yuri was so dazed with his ministrations that she didn’t notice that she was slowly stripped of her garments until she was entirely naked in front of him.</p>
<p>Tae-jun then pulled his shirt above his head, took off his pants and tossed his clothes to the side. He pushed Yuri on her back gently as he hovered above her, with eyes glowing with lust. Their limbs snaked around each other, no inch of space between them as they resumed their kisses.</p>
<p>Tae-jun broke the kiss as they fought to catch their breaths. He then drove straight to her chest and sucked on her breasts, making Yuri gasp in surprise. She felt Tae-jun’s tongue sliding on her nipples, smearing wetness across her chest as she let out a soft moan. She placed her hands onto his hair, threading it with her fingers as Tae-jun licked and sucked like a man dying of thirst. Her breaths became heavier, panting softly at the immense bliss Tae-jun provided. She squirmed below him, and rubbed her legs against his. Tae-jun’s hand squeezed her hips, and slid his hand slowly towards her center.</p>
<p>“Oh!” Yuri puffed as she felt his hand land directly on her mound, shivering at the unexpected touch. She was already wet, ready for release. Tae-jun nudged her legs wider with his knees, and settled himself between her legs. He wasn’t in a hurry, taking his time as he caressed her calves and knees— the spot where Yuri felt most sensitive about.</p>
<p>She flinched for a second, her wound-up body releasing its tension. Tae-jun grinned when he felt Yuri opening her legs even wider, and gave her a soft kiss into her cheek as his digits fingered her clit.</p>
<p>“Ahh.”</p>
<p>He skimmed her wetness with probing fingers as Yuri trembled shakily beneath him. Her clit felt like it was on fire, already burning to the touch. Tae-jun scooted downwards until he’s face to face with her privates, his tongue pushing past her wetness and prodded incessantly around her cavern.</p>
<p>Yuri wasn’t able to stifle her moans, her whimper growing louder by the second. Her body was melting under his. Tae-jun grabbed her legs and placed it on his shoulders, situating it in an angle that he wanted, still licking, sucking at her wet skin. A blush bloomed across Yuri’s cheeks, seeing her body open and willing with Tae-jun’s head in between. It was so intimate, so sexual that it made her even more aroused than she already was. She was shaking like a leaf at this point, and her body reached its high, her orgasm took over in waves. It had been a while since that happened.</p>
<p>Tae-jun continued to kiss her while she panted, already on the verge of tears at Tae-jun’s blatant display of affection. The guilt that she used to feel after sex began to disappear.</p>
<p>“You’re wet.” Tae-jun muttered as he stared at her entrance. Even her entrance was just as beautiful, he thought. He pushed one slender finger into her, the tightness she provided exciting him completely. She writhed at the intrusion, making Tae-jun chuckle as he pushed another one, scissoring two fingers inside her.</p>
<p>Yuri clasped on his shoulders, squeezing it as she uttered. “Tae-jun.. Tae-jun..”</p>
<p>She moaned his name repeatedly, hoping that he would understand what she needed. She was wanton and ready for something bigger, thicker than his fingers.</p>
<p>Tae-jun smirked at how Yuri was behaving. He knew what she needed, but he wanted to hear it with his own ears. “Tell me what you want. I want to hear you say it.”</p>
<p>Yuri looked at him in disbelief. She couldn’t believe she needed to voice it out. However, Tae-jun remained resolute in his request. He wanted to have her full consent. After a few seconds, Yuri pushed her shyness away and obliged. “I want you inside me.”</p>
