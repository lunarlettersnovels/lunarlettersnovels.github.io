            <p><strong>Chapter 163 – Tae-jun Side Story (9)</strong></p>
<p>He didn’t know what was on his mind when he ran out of his office. He was already at the airport when he realized what he was doing. Tae-jun checked the earliest flight to New York and called Jin-wook. He sounded surprised when he heard about where the Seo scion was, but he quickly regained his composure.</p>
<ul>
<li>“You made up your mind?”</li>
</ul>
<p>“I want to start over.”</p>
<p><em><strong>“You will come to my exhibition. And in front of my painting, you will ask who the artist is. And you, who fell in love with me at first sight, will ask me out for a date.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I really meant it when I told you that it would’ve been if we met in a different way.”</strong></em></p>
<p>As Yuri said…</p>
<ul>
<li>“Okay. I will contact Director Lee. I will take care of your ongoing work.”</li>
</ul>
<p>He added when Tae-jun was about to end the call.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Good luck. “</li>
</ul>
<p>On the last day of the exhibition, there was heavy rain. For that reason, the exhibition hall was rather quiet. One by one, Tae-jun looked at Yuri’s works. The ‘present time’ that she was drawing. In a space full of ‘present’, he stopped in front of where only ‘past’ was displayed. He slowly scanned Apollo with his eyes- the reason he had no choice but to board the plane as soon as he saw the picture.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Is the time I spent with you meaningless?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“That…was a contract.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em>‘No, there was. I was there in your time. Clearly in your memory.’</em></p>
<p>Tae-jun without noticing himself, let out a sigh. After standing there for a long time, he heard someone approaching. He thought he could tell who it was without looking… The person he loved, Yuri.</p>
<p>“Tae-jun Seo?” Yuri’s voice trembled slightly. He was clearly reflected in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me. How are you doing?”</p>
<p>“How, did you come here…..”</p>
<p>“To see your exhibition.”</p>
<p>Then, he said something that he had been thinking of all this time.</p>
<p>“I came here to start ‘again’ with Yuri Han.”</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>He hugged her as if to make up for the time they had been apart. The heat that started with a few kisses got out of control. Their bodies remembered each other. Tae-jun, who was constantly kissing and caressing Yuri’s body, hugged her and laid her on the bed. Then he put his hand behind her back and pulled down the zipper of her dress. He frankly admired her, who looked different from before, whose bones used to stand out as if about to break.</p>
<p>“You look beautiful.”</p>
<p>He reached out his hand and grabbed her mounds. She let out a moan when he put her pointed bud into his mouth.</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>The buds in turn reacted sensitively. His hand came down between her thighs. He stared between her legs for a moment as if he was going to swallow, then put his finger into the place that was already wet. Her body trembled at the unfamiliar sensation.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>He looked down at her in worry. She shook her head with a red face.</p>
<p>“It’s… it’s been so long since I last did this….”</p>
<p>“Me too. So I might not be able to do it gently.”</p>
<p>He kissed her forehead as he smiled. It was the moment he could finally have the woman he loved and missed so much. Unlike how he said he might not be gentle, he moved cautiously as if he was avoiding creating any blemishes on her body. She bit her lip to hold back her moans when he touched her wet skin and rubbed her cl*toris. His slow-moving fingers entered her. As the sound coming from the wet place grew louder, she covered her face in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Tae-jun whispered into her ear as if to soothe her, “I want to see your face.”</p>
<p>This was the moment he had always longed for. As if his request had been accepted, Yuri lowered her hand that covered her face. Her excitement and earnestness, revealed without filters, shook his whole body, his blood started boiling. He became so excited that he almost lost his mind. He wanted to own her to the fullest of his greed.</p>
<p>He took off his clothes in a hurry. He wanted to make her feel a little more, but that was the limit. When he roughly unbuckled and pulled down his pants, the manhood, which was already on the verge of an explosion, appeared. Pr*cum dripped from the tip. He spread her legs, sat between them and rubbed his gl@ns onto her wet place with his juice.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>She nodded. They intuitively knew that it was the moment they had both been waiting for.</p>
<p>She spoke as she caressed his face, “I want you.”</p>
<p>Her words were like a spell. A spell that restored the heart and time that had been stopped for a long time. He slipped inside her at once.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Her waist and neck arched, she trembled all over as the big man pushed into the narrow entrance. She began tightening around him, more than he’d imagined. It was hard to breathe. Tae-jun felt as if he was having her who was doing it for the first time. Yuri was also breathing roughly as if it was too much for her.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I’m okay.”</p>
<p>He hugged her tightly and kissed her on her cheek and nape. She didn’t take her eyes off of him the whole time. Feeling her slowly relaxing, he pulled himself back for a moment and then went back all the way in. Then he slowly went in and out, rhythmically. Each time that happened, his body became hot. She wrapped her legs around his waist and supported her swaying body. Every time his lips touched, a red flower bloomed on her white skin. He wrapped his hands behind her back and held her in his arms. As she hugged his neck, their eyes met.</p>
<p>“Ngh!”</p>
<p>She twisted her waist and bottom slightly as she was moaning. Noticing, he drew his body closer and moved harder. Her sensitive n*pples were rubbed against his hard chest and stimulated. In the end, her body convulsed as she came. He too could not hold it any longer and let out his seed inside her. A suffocating pleasure and exultation overwhelmed them. He took a deep breath, hugged her tightly, and caressed her.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>It was an act that left a long-lasting impression and satisfaction yet still thirsty and desperate. Yuri, who shared love with him one after another, fell into a deep sleep in his arms. Her stable breath reached his chest. However, the man couldn’t fall asleep. He couldn’t believe that she was in his arms. He felt as if this happiness would disappear if he were to close his eyes.</p>
<p>“Yuri.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun laid on his side and looked at the slumbering visage, and reached out to caress it. It was hard to control his feelings seeing her loveliness, even though he thought that he didn’t want to wake her from her deep sleep. He touched her face, this time fiddling with her ear. When his hand eventually came down to her mounds, her body moved and she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>“Did you wake up?” he whispered as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>Her lips parted slightly. “….Get to sleep, Tae-jun.”</p>
<p>“I can’t sleep. I’m afraid that this is a dream.”</p>
<p>“Did you see me in your dream?”</p>
<p>He kissed her nape while caressing her hair. “Countless times.”</p>
<p>Yuri smiled as she blinked her sleepy eyes. “This is not a dream, so go to sleep now.”</p>
<p>She turned her back, ignoring the man who was starting to get hot again.</p>
<p>“Can I check just once more?”</p>
<p>“What…. ngh!”</p>
<p>He grabbed her peaks with one hand and moved the other in between her legs. When he put his finger into her, she trembled.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s a dream or not.”</p>
<p>Her inside was hot and soft, perhaps because she had been holding <em>him</em> until a while ago. He quickly played his hand. A moan flowed from her mouth as she couldn’t hold it in. He smiled in satisfaction. He crazily loved the woman responding to the stimuli he gave her. He turned her onto her stomach and entered from behind.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time, I don’t think I will feel enough no matter how many times we do it.”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ha…!”</p>
<p>He licked the cl*toris along the vag*nal hole where he had entered. Each time he did that, there was a sound from her wet place. He kissed her white shoulder and back as he moved his waist.</p>
<p><em>‘Can it be this good? I don’t know how to express my feelings right now.’</em></p>
<p>He held her hand that was tightly clenching the bedsheet and pushed her back. They were already about to come. He whispered while putting his lips closer to her sweaty forehead.</p>
<p>“I love you. Let’s not break up again. I’ll make it up to you.”</p>
<p>At the sincerity conveyed by those words, Yuri, who barely swallowed her tears, answered, “I love you too.”</p>
<p>The other half of his heart was finally put together. Tae-jun closed his eyes as he embraced his heart.</p>
