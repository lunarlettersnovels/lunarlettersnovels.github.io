            <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 28</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I work here. I came to check since a guest was having a problem, and it turned out to be you. Are you feeling ill?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I’m just a bit light-headed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you have a medical condition? We have a nearby physician on retainer. She can be here in five minutes. Wait here.” Jae-won fished out a cell phone from his jacket. Yuri shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, please. I’m really fine. I don’t need a doctor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing her frantic face, he put the phone back into his pocket. He led her to a sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please wait here just for a moment,” he said in a stern voice and disappeared. Yuri tried to move while he was gone, but her muscles were devoid of energy.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why am I feeling so weak?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s then that she realized all she’d eaten all day was the coffee from Hyeon-ah’s café.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, drink this.” Jae-won suddenly rematerialized and handed her an open bottle of water. Feeling grateful and thirsty, Yuri brought the bottle to her lips. She felt a small relief as the cold water traveled down her throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the half-empty bottle, Jae-won asked again, “Are you sure you don’t need me to call the doctor?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. Thank you so much for your help.” She was still feeling weak, but thankfully the dizziness and nausea had disappeared. She would feel better once she had a chance to return to her room, take her medication, and rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri gave him a slight nod. “Thanks again for this. I’ll be going now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Jae-won stood up in front of her. “Where are you headed? Let me drive you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I’m totally fine. I don’t want to be a bother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won would not back down. “It would be a bother for you to just walk out in your state. I’d be so worried about you for the rest of the evening, that I wouldn’t be able to get anything done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The valet had already brought Jae-won’s car to the entrance of the lobby. Jae-won opened the passenger door for Yuri. “Get in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri reluctantly climbed in. Seated at the wheel, Jae-won asked, “Where to?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She named the hotel she was staying at. He entered it into the navigation system and started the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soothing piano music streamed out of the speakers. As though mindful of Yuri’s frail state, he refrained from talking too much. She sat with her eyes closed, feeling the silence that wasn’t entirely uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had arrived at the cross-section near her hotel when she opened her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Actually, I’ve been meaning to reach out to you.” Jae-won started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, I guess you haven’t heard from the agency yet. Director Yoon told me that you are Roy Jean’s assistant. My team is planning on acquiring one of his pieces for the hotel lobby, so I thought I’d ask you a few questions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time that day, she pictured the emails and messages that must have been piling up on her phone. Normally, she’d check them as soon as they came in, but she could hardly think about that today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would you be interested in having dinner with me?” Jae-won took a chance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of hesitation, she accepted. She was starting to feel hungry anyway. A surprised Jae-won flashed a pleasant smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, there’s a great place not so far from here, let me take you there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won took her to a traditional Korean-style house with a gracious, vintage exterior. He led her inside while she marveled at finding such a house in the middle of the bustling modern city. A woman clad in a semi-traditional garb greeted them at the entrance with a charming smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Director Lee, it’s been a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t have a reservation, but would it be possible to get a table?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman then guided them to the annex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treading on the beautiful stepping stones on the garden path, Yuri pondered over the title that the woman had addressed Jae-won with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This man works at Hotel Seoin. Given his proximity to Shi-yeon[6]  she reckoned that the two would be on similar levels. However, she was surprised to learn that he was so high-ranking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re dining with a beautiful lady this evening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll try to come more often.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d be so grateful, sir. I haven’t seen Director Yoon since she got engaged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She seems rather busy these days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri took in the view of the garden outside the window while Jae-won chatted with the owner. A pond was situated in the middle of the garden, next to a small pavilion. They were nestled among expensive viewing stones and old pine trees. This was not an ordinary restaurant for ordinary people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is there anything you can’t eat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri turned her gaze to Jae-won and shook her head. “No, I can eat anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I’ll order the chef’s tasting menu.” Jae-won motioned to the owner. “We’ll do the usual. It would be great if you could serve everything at once. I skipped lunch and am about to starve to death.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Certainly, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the owner left the room, Yuri sat face-to-face with Jae-won and began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you know Director Yoon?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, she’s a friend. We go way back. And soon she’s going to be family, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Family?” She’s surprised, she’s hardly expected such a connection between the two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, she’s engaged to my cousin. If all goes well, they’ll be married around this time next year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see.” Yuri nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won changed the subject. “What did you study in school?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I studied painting at university. And now Roy’s teaching me sculpting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. So you’re working on your own pieces as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not these days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like, you’re in a slump?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pretty much.” A bitter-sweet smile flickered on her face.</span></p>
