            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 56</strong></p>
<p>The hot water comforted Yuri’s tired body and relaxed her nervous muscles as she soaked in the bathtub. An entire wall of the tub was made of glass, she could see the blue sky and the buildings below spread out in front of her. She rested her head on the window and thought back to what had happened just now.</p>
<p><em><strong>“You just need to wait at my house on my bed like before. The condition is the same that you cannot refuse me when I want you.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Is this revenge for my deceiving you?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Revenge?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tae-jun laughed sarcastically.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“If I really wanted revenge for that, you wouldn’t be standing here now. However, I think another condition should be added that you should not deceive me.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“What are you going to do with me?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“I’m looking into it now.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Yuri sighed and wondered if she made the right choice. Tae-jun’s threats were not the only reason she had accepted this absurd offer. She wanted to find her lost memories as they were a gaping hole inside her. She’d often thought that the rift in her memories was like sinkholes, a curse within their suddenness that broke down her daily life.</p>
<p>So, to find her memories she needed the cause for them – Tae-jun. Dr. Davis had emphasized this ‘cause’ throughout the treatments, and the rigid seal on her memories seemed to be now crumbling readily with her encounters with Tae-jun Seo.</p>
<p>Another point she was considering was the unidentified men who threatened her uncle. Yuri did not believe them to be irrelevant to Hye-yeon’s death, and that meant they could make a repeat appearance. The best choice she could make to ensure her safety from them was being by Tae-jun Seo’s side.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Don’t deceive me.”</strong></em></p>
<p>She was not deceiving him but using him just like he was her body. Bizarre… selfish… crude… ruthless… be it as it may, they were here now, willingly or unwillingly. Now on, her sole focus was on retrieving what was hers- her memories.</p>
<p>Yuri closed her eyes and slowly leaned back when the bathroom door suddenly opened. She sat straight and turned her gaze to the door in surprise. Her eyes held Tae-jun taking off her shirt.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Tae-jun took off his pants and underwe@r before she had a chance to be astonished. His p*nis was fully e*ect, and Yuri’s gaze avoided the reason why her body was so sore now.</p>
<p>“Haven’t we done this often? You’re being shy.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun was telling the truth, as Yuri had taken showers with him, and they had done it often in the bathroom. Yuri had been astonished and embarrassed every time, and after four years, she was even more nervous than she had been at that time. Also, whenever Tae-jun ravaged her in the bathroom, the act tired her out at least by double.</p>
<p>He stepped into the bathtub, and despite escaping to the corner, Yuri felt his taut chest on her back.  He gently stroked her shoulders.</p>
<p>“You’re too thin.”</p>
<p>Yuri was indignant at Tae-jun’s dissatisfied voice. <em>Who was it that had ravished her disagreeably thin body?</em></p>
<p>She could feel his hard-0n at her hips that seemed to be waiting to delve between her legs. She pushed away his hands on her chest and responded in a chilly voice.</p>
<p>“Find a woman to your taste then.”</p>
<p>“That was a flat joke.” He immediately retorted.</p>
<p>“It’s not a joke… ah!”</p>
<p>Tae-jun’s hand slid between her legs. Her nether regions were still a bit swollen from last night, and when he touched her, she felt at once a sore yet strange sensation. She breathed in and drew her legs together.</p>
<p>“Stop. I don’t want to do it here,” she said tersely.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to wash you down since I filled you up last night.” Tae-jun calmly covered her most intimate place with his hand and whispered to Yuri as he licked her earlobe and added. “I thought I told you you had to spread your legs whenever I want you to.”</p>
<p>It was an accurate and menacing statement, and he forced her with a low laugh.</p>
<p>“Spread your legs.”</p>
<p>Yuri chewed on her lips and relaxed her thighs as Tae-jun gently stroked her wet p*bic hair. He found her cl*toris and started rubbing it. It immediately responded and stiffened at his ministrations.</p>
<p>She flinched and leaned back from the stimulus. Tae-jun supported her body from behind and pushed his middle finger in the wet crack, his other hand squeezed her br*ast. While her size wasn’t satisfying, her hard n*pples were. The crack that held his fingers pulsed as he slightly twisted her n*pple.</p>
<p>With a moan, Yuri tried to endure the sensations inside her, with him supporting the entire weight of her body. The sound of splashing water and her moans filled the bathroom, and it was impossible to stop the sounds escaping her mouth no matter how hard she pressed her lips. Tae-jun continued to move his fingers deftly and stroked her n*pples harder… endless pleasures filled her.</p>
<p>“You’re eating me up, and maybe I can put one more in.” His raspy voice spoke by her ear.</p>
<p>His pair of fingers moved like living entities in her, and Yuri held his thrusting hand inside the water.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you had enough…?”</p>
<p>“Your inside is still slippery, so there seems to be some left.”</p>
