            <p><strong>Chapter 131 – An Old Friend (2)</strong></p>
<p>The big guy was shocked at the unexpected attack, he started flailing his arms because he could not see. Yuri could not lose the moment and allow him the time to orient himself, hurriedly she looked for the syringe he had tossed afar. She quickly jabbed it inside him, not knowing whether it was muscle or vein she was shooting the drug into. The only thing she could do was to plunge the needle down as hard as she could and press the syringe.</p>
<p>While the big guy tried to push her away and take out the syringe, his movements had started to slow down due to the drug. Yuri broke away from the big guy only after the drug had emptied into him, and his bloodied eyes rolled to the top. His heavily muscular body crumbled on the bed and went limp. The drug seemed to be working.</p>
<p>Yuri’s entire body shook, she sat down where she stood. Her clothes were ruined by her nosebleed and the big guy’s blood, she hurt everywhere. However, she could not lose time and needed to escape. This was her only chance. She grabbed the big guy’s cell phone, pulled herself to stand up and run.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p><em>Where am I?</em></p>
<p>Yuri’s eyelids were heavy, she frowned after managing to open her eyes after a few tries. Her world shook, she was limp. It was a familiar feeling … She was astonished as she looked around to see that it was the very place she had been four years back.</p>
<p><em>It can’t be true—</em></p>
<p>She raised herself up from the bed but fell down the moment her feet hit the floor. She was familiar with this sensation, she moaned as she looked down on the floor.</p>
<p><em>That drug is in me again … Who did this? President Jin is already dead.</em></p>
<p>Someone entered as the door opened, and Yuri raised her eyes with some difficulty to see who it was.</p>
<p>“Long time no see?”</p>
<p><em>This voice… sounds like Hye-seong’s …</em></p>
<p>And it really was Hye-seong Jin who stood in front of her. Yuri looked up at him with disbelieving eyes.</p>
<p>“Hye-seong?”</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time, Yuri.”</p>
<p>Hye-seong was smiling, but his expression scared Yuri. She used her hands to support herself as she stood up but fell down again because of her wobbly legs.</p>
<p>“Is it you that brought me here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I made a request.”</p>
<p>“You made … a request?”</p>
<p>It was a blatant kidnapping! Thinking back to the astounding power of the man who had ambushed her from behind, she shuddered.</p>
<p>Hye-seong spoke as if he was making an excuse when seeing Yuri’s face. “Tae-jun Seo dragged me into the vacation house where you had been a while ago. He threatened me like he already knew what had happened to you and ordered me to tell everything I knew about you. He shot me then, saying that it was for deceiving him. He said he would find you soon and treat you as such. You must have suffered a lot.”</p>
<p><em>Is he telling the truth?</em> Yuri stared at Hye-seong with wary eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, are you angry? I made the request because I wanted to separate myself from him as much as possible, but the method must have been rough. Don’t worry, that bastard can’t find this place. I’ll protect you.” He said.</p>
<p>Hye-seong approached her and knelt to meet her eye level. Her face turned rigid at the sight of his gloomy and eerie face, it was unlike how she remembered him four years back. He placed a hand on her cheek with the same affability she had once liked.</p>
<p><em>They didn’t end well, so why was he doing this? </em>She had wanted to ask him a question ever since she regained her memory.</p>
<p>“You’re going to protect me?” she said looking him in the eye, “Then why did you treat my father like that?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Hye-seong’s eyes narrowed. “What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Don’t act like you know nothing! You were the one who showed the contract I made with President Jin to my father.”</p>
<p>Yuri slapped away Hye-seong’s hand on her cheek, it was difficult to contain her anger. She abhorred his touch for he was the reason things had turned so. Even if meeting Tae-jun had been a seed, the man before her now was the one who had started the fire. Had he not brought the contract to her father, her father would not have threatened President Jin and none of this would have happened. Perhaps, her father would’ve even been alive …</p>
<p>Hye-seong stared at Yuri’s angry face and spoke in a sunk voice.</p>
<p>“Yuri Han, you remember things now?”</p>
<p><em>How does he know about that? Did he meet with Hyeon-ah</em> <em>Kim?</em> Yuri’s brows furrowed in anxiety, while Hye-seong nodded in a sincerely joyful face.</p>
<p>“That’s good. I was thinking about how to solve this problem, and you having your memories back will speed things up.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Why … did you give my father the contract I made with President Jin? Why did you let my father know everything?”</p>
<p>Hye-seong smiled, and it was strikingly similar to President Jin’s lowdown one.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have given Tae-jun Seo your heart. You started all this, Yuri Han.”</p>
