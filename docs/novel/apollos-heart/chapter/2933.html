            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 71</strong></p>
<p>“The price is quite high.”</p>
<p>“The gallery’s quite successful these days. The owner’s receiving good rent too, so he seems to have no interest in selling it. Also, there’s potential for a rise in the next few years. Why are you suddenly so interested in the building?” Jin-wook said.</p>
<p>“I was thinking about giving it to Yuri Han.”</p>
<p>Jin-wook looked briefly surprised before his brow furrowed. “Has Ms. Han agreed to this?”</p>
<p>“The one thing I know for sure is that she has high bars for her career. Once she gets her own gallery and starts regaining the opportunities she lost because of Seok-ha Yoo, she might change her mind about this.” Tae-jun seemed quite positive about her changing her mind.</p>
<p>But his retainer didn’t seem to share the boss’ views. “I doubt it, Sir. If she could be swayed by something like this, I don’t think she would have resisted Seok-ha Yoo.”</p>
<p><em>Touché!</em> Jin-wook’s words had hit home the bitter truth and Tae-jun was forced out of excuses.  The latter knew that such things had little effect on Yuri. Even so, he wanted to be assured that he’d be able to make her stay beside him.</p>
<p>How could he not understand the other’s intention? Jin-wook gave out a small sigh. “If all you want is for Yuri to stay beside you, you’re already doing a great job. Otherwise, just try to have dirt on her uncle in America or Roy Jean. Just like President Jin did.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun frowned at the hint of poignance in Jin-wook’s voice, unlike his normal, impassive tone.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the man ignored his boss’ displeasure, and stubbornly continued on with his opinion. “If not, you need to earn her trust. You need to make Yuri Han herself long for you Sir.”</p>
<p>There was no rebuttal to that. Tae-jun stood up with a stiff face.</p>
<p>As they got out of the sauna, the duo bumped into a group of employees moving frames covered in fabric.</p>
<p>Tae-jun asked Jae-won, “What is that?”</p>
<p>“We’re changing up the paintings in the banquet hall.”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you see the news? Artist Seok-ha Yoo is in deep trouble. We bought these a couple of years ago for a really high price and it’s making me regret it big time. I don’t know, maybe we got lucky since we chose to display Roy Jean’s work instead of Seok-ha Yoo’s art at the very last minute.” Jae-won put his hand on his forehead as if it ached.</p>
<p>“How are things at Hotel Seoin?”</p>
<p>“Mother was never fond of Seok-ha Yoo’s artwork so I doubt she ever owned any. The problem is Si-yeon Yoon. She even collaborated with Yoo for the merchandise last year.”</p>
<p>Jae-won’s reply reminded Tae-jun of Si-yeon for the first time in a while. That woman was a flawless fiancée. She was the goose that would lay golden eggs for Hotel Seoin. Growing up in a similar environment and being friends ever since childhood, the two felt comfortable around each other. He especially liked the fact that she did not expect any ‘affection’ or ‘care’ from him. All he needed was to put on a show of a ‘perfect marriage’ for everyone to see, and this woman seemed to be a sufficient fiancée for this act. Nothing needed to be changed because of Yuri Han’s existence. There were various ways to keep her alongside.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>You’re the same as them!</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly, he was reminded of her harrowed voice and tears … his heart ached. <em>Is this how Father felt? Was he burdened with frustration that had lingered inside him forever?</em></p>
<p><em>⸙ </em></p>
<p>When Tae-jun got home, for a long time he remained standing at the entrance staring up at the second floor. He could see the light in Yuri’s room glistening. He felt abnormally relaxed.  He walked upstairs and gently opened the door and saw her asleep. Based on the laptop placed on the bedside table, she must have been looking up something. The screen was locked.</p>
<p><em>What was she looking for?</em></p>
<p>According to Manager Choi, she was always stuck in her room or the subway with her eyes locked to her laptop screen. Now Jin-wook’s words came to his mind.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>If not, you need to earn her trust. You need to make Yuri Han herself long for you Sir.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How do I earn her affection?</em></p>
<p>He had already gotten off to a bad start with Yuri. He had forced her to stay with him, but he was still very clueless about the woman. If he could, he wanted to dissect every part of her to fully understand her.</p>
<p>Slowly, he approached the sleeping beauty. He stroked her face ever so gently as if he were touching fragile glassware. How wrong he was to ever think simply having her beside him was enough … He let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p><em>⸙⸙⸙</em></p>
