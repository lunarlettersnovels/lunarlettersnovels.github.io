            <p><strong>Chapter 167 – After Story (4)</strong></p>
<p>After finishing the meal, she meticulously scanned the profiles of those attending today’s opening ceremony. She also checked the questionnaire in advance because she was also scheduled for an interview to be published in Seoin Group’s newsletter and outside magazine. Then, she went to a salon just in time for her appointment. It took quite a bit of time and energy to finish her hair, make-up and nails. When she was done, a stylist, Director Song, was waiting at her house.</p>
<p>With Tae-jun, whose face looked much better than in the morning, she finished preparations and headed to the Seoin Museum of Art. All the way to the museum, the man seemed to be lost in thoughts, holding Yuri’s hand, who was sitting next to him.</p>
<p><em>‘Did things not turn out well on his business trip?’</em></p>
<p>She didn’t believe in dreams 100%, but it was definitely a very good dream for Tae-jun. She thought to herself that she should talk with him later.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>The Seoin Museum of Art showed a luxurious yet sturdy exterior to suit the taste of its first director, Soo-kyung. The opening ceremony, attended by many, went smoothly. Countless flashes were fired and greetings exchanged. On the other side of the exhibition hall, a memorial hall for Chairman Seo was also opened. Soo-kyung gave a short tribute and an opening speech on the podium, followed by a ribbon-cutting ceremony and dinner.</p>
<p>After the dinner, Yuri moved to the director’s office and had an interview with Soo-kyung that would be published in two women’s magazines. The relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was good. Soo-kyung liked her for that one reason- she was the woman her son loved. She didn’t only recognize the talent in Yuri, but she was also the one who encouraged her to continue painting even after her marriage. The two met once a month without Tae-jun and spent time together.</p>
<p>After the interview with Soo-kyung, Yuri looked for Tae-jun in the hall. Then, someone greeted her from behind her.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>It was Jae-won who was holding the hand of his lovely daughter Yoon-a. Most of the family members were present, so it was very natural for her to see him there.</p>
<p>Yuri greeted Jae-won and waved her hand at Yoon-a. “Hello, Jae-won. Hello, Yoon-a.”</p>
<p>Yoon-a bowed to Yuri. The little girl, who would turn six this year, resembled both her mom and dad. She would grow up as a beautiful woman</p>
<p>Yuri asked Jae-won, “How about Si-yeon? Didn’t she come together?</p>
<p>“She came but she’s having morning sickness… So her mother took her with her.”</p>
<p>Si-yeon was pregnant with Yoon-a’s siblings. They were twins. She must be going through a tough time since her baby bump was quite visible.</p>
<p>Yoon-a, who was holding Jae-won’s hand, pulled his sleeve collar. “Dad, washroom.”</p>
<p>“Okay, my princess. Where was the washroom?”</p>
<p>Jae-won seemed like he didn’t know what to do. Yuri understood the situation and stepped forward. She thought it would be better for her to go into the women’s bathroom than Jae-won himself.</p>
<p>“I will go with Yoon-a.”</p>
<p>“Will you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Yuri took Yoon-a’s hand.</p>
<p>Jae-won smiled at Yuri, saying thank you. She took Yoon-a to the bathroom, and after completing her mission, she found Tae-jun again. Every time she did, she encountered a lot of people. As if she herself was a work of art in the exhibition, the gazes that seemed to hold a critique followed her for a long time. She thought she was used to it, but she wasn’t. She was able to hear clearly all the meaningless talk.</p>
<p>“Jae-won’s child seems to have grown a lot. Besides, I heard that they have two male twins?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s good news for both families. Who would have known that Jae-won would be so successful? I heard that he received a lot of shares from the Daejin Group.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t there any news from Tae-jun? It’s been quite some time since they got married, but still no news?”</p>
<p>“I know, right. I thought they bared a child just like Jae-won when they announced their marriage all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>“I thought they were in a good relationship. Perhaps, they have some issues.”</p>
<p>“Too bad, Chairman Seo would’ve shed tears knowing this. He was a person who was obsessed with the succession of the Seo family, but it looks like that lineage would be cut off.”</p>
<p>Yuri stopped walking, and let out a small sigh.</p>
<p>“You were here.”</p>
<p>It was Tae-jun’s voice, that blew away the complicated thoughts in her head at once.</p>
<p>“How was the interview?”</p>
<p>Yuri answered, holding his hand, “It was okay.”</p>
<p>“Should we go now?”</p>
<p>In the car on the way home, Yuri put her head on Tae-jun’s shoulder and closed her eyes. Her mood had been strangely out of control lately. The words that she would normally pass over became thorns and pierced her chest. Especially about them not having a child. A child between herself and Tae-jun. She recalled the feeling of holding Yoon-a’s hand.</p>
<p><em><strong>“It’s not that pregnancy is impossible, but the chance is very low that it would be a miracle if she actually becomes pregnant”</strong></em></p>
<p>It was what the doctor said during the health check-up. He said it would be a miracle, but she gave up and lived her life thinking that she would never be able to have a child from the beginning. But she began to have more regrets as time went by.</p>
<p>“Are you tired?” Tae-jun’s soft voice landed on her head.</p>
<p>“A little,” she murmured.</p>
<p>A big hand caressed her shoulder. A long day was drawing to a close.</p>
