            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 49</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun roughly laid Yuri down on the bed and took off her skirt. As the long cloth snaked down her thighs, her slim legs and underwe@r came into view. Her blouse was already wide open and could no longer hide her bre*sts. The red marks left on her white skin drove him crazy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He hurriedly stripped his clothes off, displaying his sculpted physique and er*ction as he came to her bare as the day he was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the bare-bodied man neared, Yuri drew back; not out of fear but astonishment. She had sketched the body of the man in her memories. Yuri had even made molds of the beautiful body she could see whenever she closed her eyes. She just had never imagined that it would now come to her in flesh. What’s more, belonging to Tae-jun Seo–the man who wreaked havoc into her life just recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun grabbed her ankle and roughly pulled her to him. He removed the clothing that remained on her and spread her legs out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri shuddered like a fish forced out of the water as his thumb touched the most sensitive spots deep inside her. The man chuckled and relentlessly pushed his fingers into her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri was still dry and hence, in pain. She grabbed his wrist and pushed his chest away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It hurts!” She glared at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’d become wet with only a kiss before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disregarding her words, he simply plunged his fingers deeper. Her face creased in pain as she felt his digits moving inside her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It hurts! Please, stop.”  She pleaded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so tight. Your old teacher hasn’t had you much.” He sniggered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I said that’s not true!” She glared daggers at him. “I’m not in that kind of relationship with Roy …”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His fingers came in deeper after stroking her cl*toris. He licked her earlobe as if to soothe her, circled his fingers in as she became less tight than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri shut her eyes tightly as his fingers seemed to be everywhere inside her. He pressed a particular spot while observing her response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you still like it here?” he asked in a raspy voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah!” She felt electrified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun had once known her body better than Yuri did. Even after four years, he found the places that aroused her quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She grabbed his shoulders as tremors overtook her. She felt herself getting damp under his relentless ministrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stirred her until wet sounds filled the room. She turned her head away in embarrassment, but the man forced her to watch him with a hand on her chin. He slowly licked his fingers as he met her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember your taste.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri blushed as she watched him lick her juices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t do this!” she said softly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I did not plan to do this, but now you rush me.” Saying so, he held one of her legs over his shoulder. “It’s been too long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He rubbed his erect*on just before he entered and lightly bit her lower lip. Yuri gripped his shoulders tighter as she felt a massive heat against her body. She felt as if she was split in two when Tae-jun thrust inside her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was hit with excruciating pain. Even though she had become wet under his caresses, it had been too long since she had accepted a man inside. He was too big and hot as he forced his way inside her walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She tilted her head back, her lips trembled. Above her, Tae-jun groaned as he reached her deepest regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It should be like this.” He whispered hoarsely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lodged deep inside her, he stared into her eyes without moving. Teardrops hung on her long and lush eyelashes. He held her in his arms while she struggled to get her breath back. He traced along her forehead, brows, the bridge of her nose, closed eyelids, lips with his eyes, and his gaze traveled down her delicate neckline, collarbone, arm, hands, fingers, and nails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His gaze stopped at Yuri’s hands that were fisting the bedsheets. They had the same short nails as a child’s but were homely compared to the rest of her body. They were continuously drawing and making something, so her hands were wreathed with calluses. Everything about her was beautiful, but Tae-jun remembered her hands best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I finally found you, Yuri Han.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking her hand, he planted a kiss on her warm palm. He then grabbed her thighs and pushed her body closer. She felt like she was being impaled, ravaged by a monster even. She clenched her teeth as he forcibly opened her to him</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large hands soon found her pair of mounds kneading them to his contentment while he softly bit the soft skin of her neck. Yuri felt ar0usal taking over pain as he rubbed her reddened n*pples and moved his hips in a fast rhythm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a sensation long left in the past. As he moved in and out with long and deep thrusts, the top of his head hit the headboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His movements were violent and rough, but her body remembered him. The bond with Tae-jun Seo was something deeper than a simple physical encounter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange sensation filled her as the passionate s3x she had in her dream became a reality. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was this what I had left behind in my memories? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her world felt more real than it ever had in the last four years. Her consciousness spiraled down in a whirlwind of sensations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun also seemed to feel her mind drifting away and kissed her as if he wanted to swallow her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Look at who you are with now.” He whispered to her ears. This was followed by a short cry emanating from her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt a sharp taste in her mouth as he pried it open. Their tongues in a familiar dance, she felt alive. His hips ground against her, while his lips pressed down on hers. This was not the imaginary world where Yuri had wandered in torment. It was not a dream, but a reality where only Tae-jun existed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her strength left her as the man expertly moved and twisted his hips. A vein stood out in his forehead as he felt Yuri go hot and wet underneath him. Everything was beyond sensations now.</span></p>
