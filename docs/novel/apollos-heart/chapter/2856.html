            <p><strong>Chapter 149</strong></p>
<p>The Alzheimer’s Care Center, where Yuri volunteered, was a place where patients with mild to moderate conditions received rehabilitation. The volunteer was responsible for monitoring the conditions of the patients and making sure there were no abrupt emergencies. Although there were no patients with mobility problems or difficulty in going to the bathroom, the role required considerable consideration.</p>
<p>Today was not very different. The patient who told Yuri she was going to the bathroom did not come back. Unlike most of the patients, she was a woman of a relatively young age, not looking any older than fifty. She was washing her hands again and again in front of the sink. This was because she kept forgetting that she had washed her hands. Forgetting that she washed her hands, ate her meal, getting words mixed up, losing the sense of time and location, and being easily triggered were all typical symptoms of a moderate Alzheimer’s condition.</p>
<p>There was no way to recover other than to adherently take medication and continue rehabilitation to slow down the progress. Little by little, Yuri was learning about the disease that might grow in her one day. She wanted to prepare herself so she would not panic or get confused in the future.</p>
<p>After her service, she stopped by the grocery store on her way back home. Her fridge was totally empty because she had been staying in her studio to work on her project for the past few days. Ever since she had become considerate of her health, she was sincere with the food she ate.</p>
<p>After she meticulously chose her items, she headed to the cashier. Then, she instantly froze.</p>
<p><em>Tae-jun?</em></p>
<p>She was certain she saw him. <em>No way.</em></p>
<p>She trembled as she walked towards where she had seen him. However, of course, there was no one there. She was being delusional. She shook her head. There was no way the man was here. Ever since they broke up, they hadn’t spoken to each other.</p>
<p>During the In-bae Lee proceeding, she could notice the eyes looking over her. They were guards hired by Tae-jun. She had approved of the security because she didn’t want to experience what she did in Jinseong ever again. Tae-jun was a man who kept his words. After they concluded that she was safe, they had all and did not interfere with her life again.</p>
<p>They were people from different worlds in the first place. He was a man on the television and in magazines. In fact, she had learned that he became the vice-president of Seoin and began to focus more on pharmaceuticals and manufacturing because of family politics all through the news.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the one who successfully formed a relationship with Daejin, unlike Tae-jun, was Jae-won Lee. The story of his marriage to Si-yeon was a topic on the front cover of magazines for a month. People found their journey interesting. After all, the couple had been friends for over two decades, went to the same college, the girl had almost married the man’s cousin, Tae-jun, and their mothers were archrivals…</p>
<p>What’s more, Si-yeon had been pregnant before the wedding. Everything about them was enough to keep the gossipmongers on their toes. Of course, they were irrelevant to Yuri.</p>
<p>As she entered the apartment lobby with grocery bags in hand, an elderly security guard greeted her. The five-story apartment building she lived in was located away from downtown and was built thirty years ago. It did not have an elevator and often had power outage issues. Instead, to compensate for its flaws, the rent was very cheap and was located near her studio. Of course, cheap rent in New York still cost a lot, and she would not have been able to live there without the support of her agency.</p>
<p>Yuri had always gone up the stairs to the fifth floor. Initially, she would hyperventilate, but now she was not tired at all. Her unit was the one all the way down the hallway. It had a small kitchen, a bathroom, and a small bedroom. It was almost vacant since she spent most of her time in her studio.</p>
<p>After a shower, she wrapped a towel around her head and prepared dinner. She sliced the vegetables she bought at the grocery store and put the pasta noodles into the pot. Then, her phone rang. It was a call from the manager of the agency who was helping her prepare the exhibition.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have something to tell you about the exhibition. Do you have a minute?</li>
</ul>
<p>“Yes. Is there a problem?”</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, about that…</li>
</ul>
<p>The articulate woman stuttered for a minute, then started talking again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you really have no means to exhibit ‘Apollo’?</li>
</ul>
<p>“I thought we talked over this. ‘Apollo’ is very personal to me. I don’t want it at the exhibition.”</p>
<ul>
<li>I know, Yuri. I know how resolute you are, but still, I think ‘Apollo’ is the most suitable piece that should be the main artwork of the exhibition.</li>
</ul>
<p>“You mean the piece I am working on is not enough to be the ‘main’?”</p>
<ul>
<li>No, that’s not what I mean. It has weight and is expressive, yet very detailed. Once it’s complete, it might be the most expensive piece you have ever made. Nevertheless, Apollo would grasp everyone’s attention. It’s the only relief as well. Yuri, I want to make this exhibition flawless.</li>
</ul>
<p>She knew what it meant. The manager was famous for her taste. She had also encouraged her during her burnout phase. She cared about the exhibition as much as she did. She sighed and replied quietly.</p>
<p>“…I’ll consider it.”</p>
<p>When she hung up, the pasta was cooked just right. She ate dinner and cleaned up. She then took out her drawing book like always. After drawing a few meaningless lines, she grabbed the pencil and pondered.</p>
<p><em>Apollo…</em></p>
<p><em>A relief that depicts a man who repeatedly comes to mind while she lost her memory.</em> <em>How was she feeling when she made it?</em> <em>The man whom she could not let go of even after losing her memories. A love that was uncontrollable enough to destroy everything in the other person. Then, was her love actually love?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>“The time we spent together doesn’t mean anything to you?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“That…… was for the contract.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Was that really all?</em></p>
