            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 29</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The restaurant had quite a relaxed atmosphere, Yuri found it quite calming. Jae-won was a decent company too and by and by, her mind was steered away from the happenings from earlier in the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper door slid open and the servers in semi-traditional garb, similar to the proprietor’s, brought in the dishes. The large table was soon filled with beautiful dishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would you like something to drink, sir?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m all right. Yuri, how about you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m okay as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please enjoy your meal.” The server left the room and closed the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won, the gentleman, was quite an attentive host.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please go ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying so, he took a piece of savory pancake and placed it on the plate in front of Yuri. Whether it was due to her hunger, or the chef’s skills, everything was absolutely delicious. Yuri was honestly impressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They do a great job here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right? The owner’s family has been running the place for three generations. I’m here pretty often. Please enjoy to your heart’s content.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won smoothly led the conversation, occasionally recommending dishes for Yuri to try. He asked about the piece that his team was looking to buy, and she answered to the best of her knowledge. His experience in the hospitality industry had extensively trained him in table and conversation etiquette.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How’s New York these days?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won had spent most of his childhood in the US and was very familiar with New York City. He would still visit a few times a year, to see his brother who lived there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that note, the conversation naturally focused on the city. Amazingly, his brother’s apartment was very close to Roy Jean’s studio. Jae-won seemed surprised when Yuri mentioned this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve always been curious about that building since it has such a unique exterior. I’d no idea it was his studio. On the off chance, does it also serve as a gallery? I’d love to visit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. It has some of Roy’s work, as well as some pieces by his assistants. Please do drop by next time you’re in town.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is your work also displayed there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just a few.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m looking forward to seeing them!” He seemed quite enthusiastic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, Jae-won dropped her off at her hotel. She thanked him before getting out of the car. She was refreshed now and thought she owed it to this man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for dinner. I’m greatly indebted to you for your help today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please don’t worry about that. I really enjoyed having dinner with you. And here’s my card. Would it be possible for you to give me a call before you leave the country?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you wanted to talk about the contract, the agency would be handl[7] …”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t really think she needed to involve herself as this was something the agency always handled. But before she could complete, the man interjected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, it’s not about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri withdrew the hand that was about to take his card. She didn’t know what he wanted with her, she was somewhat uncomfortable now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing her hesitation, he added. “Don’t feel pressured. I just want us to be friends. Please, I’m starting to feel a little embarrassed here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri reluctantly took the card from his hand. She felt obligated to the man for today, however, she made herself clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I may not have a chance to call you before I go.” She didn’t want him to get the wrong signals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s okay.” He smiled gently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She gave him a polite nod and went into the hotel without turning back.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a long day this has been!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri dropped to the floor as soon as she entered her room. She’d held it in for quite a long time.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun buried himself deep in the seat of his car. It felt like his senses were focused on one thing, as vivid as the perception of a hunter who’d finally re-encountered a prey that had long eluded him. He could barely contain the excitement that brewed in his body ever since he’d been informed of Hye-seong Jin’s capture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, instead of pulling the trigger of his shotgun, the hunter clasped his hands together and closed his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jinseong Construction… It had been one of the top fifty construction firms in the country, riding on the coattails of Hotel Jinseong and the influence wielded by the mayor of Jinseong, In-bae Lee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since long Tae-jun had lusted after Hotel Jinseong. This was when the Seoin Group was devoting itself to its hospitality business, in an attempt to purge itself of the foul reputation from its beginnings as a weapons manufacturer. He needed to grab this hotel: a key tourist attraction, a landmark in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Myeong-je Jin, a man who had gotten his start in a local gang, was not the type of person you could talk things out with. The negotiations had gone down the drain. The only remaining option was to exercise force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, Tae-jun and Jay concocted a plan to bring Jinseong Construction to its knees, their target being the Star Road Shopping Mall project that this company was collaborating with Yuseong Corporation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo quickly went about their designs like clockwork. Jay managed to win over the shop owners at the open-air market, on whose land the shopping mall was supposed to be built. Under his seemingly guileless orchestration, the shop owners refused to sell the land while a sly Tae-jun put pressure on the finance industry and successfully limited the cash flow into Jinseong’s project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to handle the debts snowballing due to the delay in construction, a desperate Jinseong Construction ended up setting fire to the market where some shop owners were still holding out in protest. Ten or so people were killed or injured. The Jinseong gang and the construction company were tried in the court of public opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jinseong Construction’s downfall followed according to Tae-jun’s plan. Mr. Jin had invested everything in Star Road Shopping Mall, including In-bae Lee’s election funds, and thus was desperate enough to sell the hotel to make up for the losses. And when he finally came to it, without hesitation, he even tossed in a woman pretending to be his daughter as part of the deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun slowly opened his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, he thought a year would be enough. Enough time for him to satisfy whatever it was that he was feeling–possessiveness or perhaps simple lust–get tired of her and make a clean break sans regrets. He had had actresses, models, and even women from upper-class families at his side, and a year had always been enough. In some cases, it was too long even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, he couldn’t understand why he lusted after Yuri more intensely the more he had her. He was ill-equipped to understand the workings of his own heart which was continuing to react with such force even after four years. But one thing was clear, he hadn’t made a clean break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After two hours or so, the car arrived at Jay’s vacation house. The house was isolated from the quiet village nearby offering a perfect setting for clandestine or indecorous business. Jin-wook and his men were waiting for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The men recognized Tae-jun and bowed their heads. Jin-wook, who was standing at the entrance, approached him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was in Incheon, trading US dollars against Russian sailors, the Chinese, and Korean-Chinese. His bodyguard put up a fight, but we managed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is he inside?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two of my guys are watching him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jin-wook led him into the house.</span></p>
