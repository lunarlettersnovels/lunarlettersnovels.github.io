            <p><b>Chapter 83</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri realized she was right. The lawmakers of this city could give the lawbreakers a run for the money. Even if Hyeon-ah had gone to them even with substantial proof, they would have just shrugged it off. And the man in question was a well-known personality, the list of policemen on his payroll would be never-ending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, she was drained of all energy. Yuri held up the cup with her trembling hands and took a sip of the coffee. She had to organize her thoughts. Now was not the time to crumble and fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then why are you telling me this now?” she asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You left for the States, and I didn’t have the authority to request a new investigation. But when I heard you came back to Korea, I thought it was appropriate to tell you.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was this the truth?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She didn’t know. If President Jin was the criminal, there’s nothing linked to Sang-gu Park and In-bae Lee. Actually, Sang-gu Park shared a link with In-bae Lee and Mr. Jin, so … fine. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what about herself? What about Hye-yeon Jin?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you know what my father was trying to take from Mr. Jin?” She prodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, I’m not sure. Was something missing from his belongings?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know. My uncle took care of it instead of me.” Yuri sighed. She remembered nothing, not even her father’s funeral. Those ten or so days were such a big mystery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why don’t you take a look into it? It might become essential evidence to reopen an investigation.” Hyeon-ah suggested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there was evidence, a reinvestigation did not seem so impossible. But for that, where should she look for the evidence, and was there even any?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri got out of Hyeon-ah Kim’s café pale and frozen. The driver who was opening the door looked concerned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Madam, Are you okay? You look very sick.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m just a little tired. I would like to go home and rest.” She politely replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri got in the car and leaned on the seat with her eyes closed. There were so many questions … What was her father trying to take? Why did her father, who was ever so loyal to Mr. Jin, suddenly have his hands on his possession, and what was this thing that even triggered a murder?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was going in circles. All this thinking and surmising was taking a toll on her, her head started to ache. She could not breathe or move. She needed to take her medicine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri took out her medicine box from her bag. She took a pill and hoped that it would help her and counted the remaining pills. She discovered she might not have enough for her month-long business trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had to go back to the States for a refill of her medication, and there were so many steps to follow on the way back at the airport because the medication contained an ingredient that was illegal in Korea. Luckily Davis and Roy were a great help, but she still had to waste an entire day at the airport. It was awful just thinking about it. She doubted that Tae-jun would allow her to go to the States alone anyways.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had to double-check on her father’s belongings, so she did need to visit the States, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but how?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, she was not as pale when she arrived home. She was drowsy from her medication, and just dropped on her bed. She took a nap until Tae-jun came home and woke her up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun asked Yuri, who was struggling to open her swollen eyes. “I heard that you met Hyeon-ah Kim in Jinseong. Did she say anything helpful?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri was about to tell him about her father, but she hesitated. She remembered what Hyeon-ah Kim said to her. </span></p>
<p><b><i>He got engaged recently, didn’t he? Is it okay for you to meet such a guy?</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, maybe there’s no need to mention Father …</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Their relationship wasn’t going to last anyways. They were bound by a contract and he had a fiancée. Sooner than later they were to part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More so because she was of the opinion that her relationship with Tae-jun should only last until she recovers her memories. She didn’t want him to go through her struggles. There was no point in bothering him with her problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t owe her anything. Also, she couldn’t be a part of his life either. They came from different worlds that were never supposed to intersect. It was a trick of fate that their paths had crossed, but it was only for a short time. So it was safe to say that neither was obligated to the other in any way. Then, why entangle when the time to break free was near?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri said in a deep voice, “No, there was nothing helpful.”</span></p>
