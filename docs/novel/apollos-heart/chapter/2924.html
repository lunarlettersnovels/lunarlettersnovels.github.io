            <p><strong>Chapter 80</strong></p>
<p>Ever since she returned from Jinseong, Yuri could not leave her bed for three days straight. To be more exact, she could not leave Tae-jun’s arms. He ate most of the meals in bed and even carried her to the bathroom. Was it because he worked out intensely on a regular basis? His energy and virility were simply incredible. He coveted her as if it was the sole purpose of his vacation.</p>
<p>It was ironic. He had tasked Manager Choi to help recover her health with nutritious meals, but now that she was healthy again, the very man was exhausting her even more. She had to endure him twice and even thrice in one night. To his credit, this avaricious man was actually controlling his pace. What’s more, he even kept her hydrated and let her get enough sleep.</p>
<p>But he tried to stick to her skin every little second. Her body was filled with his seed. Even beasts that lived for s*x, by s*x, and because of s*x would not act as wildly as he was. It was appalling how a person’s desire could be so intense.</p>
<p>But who was she to blame? Wasn’t she the one mo@ning in pleasure under his skin?</p>
<p>Yuri couldn’t even get herself together while the man was getting ready for work. Tae-jun finished dressing up, walked towards her, and patted her bare back.</p>
<p>“I should tell Manager Choi to get some expensive supplements for you.”</p>
<p><em>Supplements to make me more exhausted? </em>Yuri deliberately let out an audible sigh.</p>
<p>“You’re insane. Instead of getting me supplements, you should think about refraining yourself. ”</p>
<p>“Did you not look at the mirror yesterday? You were so beautiful nobody could have refrained from you.”</p>
<p>The word ‘mirror’ made her blush. Last night, he was enjoying a session in various positions in front of a mirror that covered an entire wall in the dressing room.</p>
<p>“… You pervert.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like I enjoyed it by myself? And I’m actually trying my best to stay on the same pace as you. You’re way too weak.”</p>
<p><em>There’s no way he can be holding back! </em>She screamed in her mind but said nothing.</p>
<p>Tae-jun looked genuinely disappointed. He pouted while rubbing her buds. Yuri’s body reacted immediately. She pushed him back and pulled up her blanket.</p>
<p>“You’re not thinking about staying home today, are you?” She glared at him.</p>
<p>Ta-jun chuckled as he got up from the bed.</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>It was an hour after Tae-jun left, that Yuri finally got out of bed. She wanted to get some sleep while she was free of his touch but instead decided to do some more research on Sang-gu Park.</p>
<p>She stopped her indifferent steps to the restroom when she was in front of the mirror in the dressing room. The dresser that was completely sabotaged last night was squeaky clean and neatly organized. However, the finger marks left on the mirror reflected the memories of last night.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Oh …!</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The man’s pants and the woman’s mo@ns filled up the entire dressing room.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em>No. Look directly in the mirror.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tae-jun’s voice sounded very relaxed. He reached out to elevate her face. Yuri had no choice but to gaze into the mirror. She was so flustered that even her neck was dyed scarlet. The dresser was brightly lit to make everything clearly apparent.</p>
<p>The large mirror that was as big as the entire wall portrayed a woman and a man, completely bare without even a hint of fabric around. Yuri’s eyes met with the woman in the mirror. Her pale skin was covered with red marks. Her pair of wet and round buds shook as they followed her every movement.</p>
<p>The n!pples that the man so eagerly played with his tongue were ripe as juicy berries. Underneath them was a long hard stick that was stabbing the woman’s cherry.</p>
<p>Tae-jun very slowly turned his waist and endlessly tickled her cl!t. Yuri desperately tried to withhold the peaking only in vain. Her body spazzed out and arched backward.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ah … ah!</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The translucent nectar slid down her thighs and dropped on the floor. Her legs lost strength and she dropped to the floor. She held his arms and pleaded.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sto … Stop it. I’m too exhausted to keep standing up.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing her own n@ked body through the mirror was enough to stimulate her excitement more than usual. Her body would not stop wetting.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>You keep finishing by yourself … that’s why.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>And it’s all his fault!</strong></em> Yuri glared at his eyes touching his private area through the mirror. The man in the mirror was truly enjoying the situation. His rod was upright even after relieving several times.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I have just started this round.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tae-jun pushed his hot member inside while pulling her towards him, maintaining the position. Yuri naturally ended up sitting on top of him and noticed his predatory glare. The position allowed the man to pen*trate even more deeply, and their actions were more exposed to the mirror.</p>
<p>Her core was wide open, welcoming his member from the tip to the base. She was so shocked at the view that she tried to close her legs but the man meanly held her thighs firmly and kept them wide apart.</p>
<p>She bit her lips and shook her head, she was ashamed. Her pale legs wide apart, her black forest, pink, flustered flesh, with large meat deeply wedged into her were all enough to make her feel embarrassed. However, what made her feel so weird was that she was enjoying every second of this situation. Tae-jun’s panting became hastier as if he was feeling the same.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Look closely at how ecstatically you’re devouring me.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He held her hips and shook her up and down repetitively. She could see his wet rod constantly tickling her senses. She was embarrassed and hid her face behind her hands. How the man would not take his eyes off her. Unable to endure it any longer, she pleaded.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Please … I’m too shy for this.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>How come? Your beauty makes me go insane.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tae-jun sounded genuinely puzzled. His hand felt her lips, neck, and traced downwards. He grasped on her bosom, then slid down her ribs and to her flat stomach. He was gentle like he were touching an exquisite and delicate piece of art. His finger stopped on her thighs.</p>
<p>She shook mildly.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Put your hands down and look in the mirror.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>His words were like a spell. Yuri obeyed him as if she were bewitched and looked at Tae-jun’s eyes through the mirror. He licked her neck, keeping eye contact all along.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><em><strong>It was only you … I only have you … the only one who makes me lose control.</strong></em></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
