            <p><strong>Chapter 116 – The Start Of Everything (2)</strong></p>
<p>That’s how his Yuri’s father’s in Jin-seong began, but it wasn’t all that bad. The diligent man he was, he soon got used to his work. Yuri was also a hardworking student, wise beyond her age. There was one thing she did worry about- pursuing an education in art was quite expensive. Not only the materials but also the competitions and the lessons were not something her father alone could handle.</p>
<p>The same went for college. Loans and scholarships were not enough to cover the tuition and miscellaneous fees of the prestigious private school. Thus, Yuri worked part-time as an art tutor during the semester and at the hotel during the break. Even so, she was short of money.</p>
<p>Indeed, the father provided for the daughter. And Yuri was aware that the money he made was not through honest ways. Nonetheless, she remained silent.</p>
<p>Thankfully, she built a great carrier and was acknowledged by Korea’s most renowned professor. She successfully grasped the chance to study abroad, so sooner or later she’d be able to pay back the money she had received from her father.</p>
<p>However, the world was not full of mercy. Everything had spiraled in an instant, and she was demanded to pay off the family debt that she had ignored for long. History had repeated itself, and President Jin had tossed her a choice as well- sell her kidneys or give up her body.  And just like her father, she had chosen the latter.</p>
<p>She contemplated and even blamed Tae-jun when she was drunk, but she didn’t mean it. Myung-je Jin was the one who was evil; she and her father were also culpable for gambling with fishy money.</p>
<p>It seemed like fate was ridiculing her. The relationship, the attraction, the emotions …. She couldn’t act like nothing had happened and rely on him any longer. She had to take the final responsibility. That was the decision she had come to during these two days in the hospital.</p>
<p>“How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>Late at night, Yuri was startled at the unexpected visitor. <em>How is this man ….</em> The man in front of her was Jae-won.</p>
<p>“Jae-won Lee? How did you come―”</p>
<p>“I was asked by Tae-jun.”</p>
<p>“Asked … by Tae-jun?”</p>
<p>“He rarely asks for favours but it’s quite a complicated situation. Tae-jun is being watched, so he can’t leave the house. His people are all being watched as well. That’s why I came instead. We need to leave right now. You can walk well?”</p>
<p>Jae-won was sincere unlike his usual self, so Yuri nodded. He handed her a shopping bag that had some clothes and a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>“I’ll wait outside while you get changed.”</p>
<p><em>What was going on?</em></p>
<p>When Yuri emerged wearing the new clothes, Jae-won was having a conversation with the guard.</p>
<p>“― Three days would be enough. Just make it appear like she’s still in the hospital. Jin-ho will act along too.”</p>
<p>The guard looked sincere as he nodded.</p>
<p>Jae-won brought Yuri to the underground parking lot. They took an elevator that did not stop at the lobby, so there was nobody who noticed the two. As soon as they got into the car, he started to drive.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Yuri cautiously asked.</p>
<p>“Somewhere safe.”</p>
<p>“Why the need?”</p>
<p>Jae-won hesitated. “Our director, I mean, Tae-jun and my grandfather, is an extremely dangerous man.”</p>
<p>“How is this relevant?”</p>
<p>“You know how in Korean dramas, the wealthy moms just toss an envelope with cash or spray water? Unfortunately, our grandfather is not as gentle.”</p>
<p>“I mean … what does that have anything to do with me―”</p>
<p>“Tae-jun refused to marry Si-yeon. The whole family is in shock.”</p>
<p>Yuri was stifled, she couldn’t breathe. <em>What did he mean he refused to get married?</em>  However, Jae-won did not say more. When they stopped at a red signal, he reached behind to offer her a blanket.</p>
<p>“Try to take a nap. We still have a long way to go.” Like always, he was thoughtful and courteous.</p>
<p>“Roy will come in the morning.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Roy’s in Korea? I’ll explain everything to him. I just came back from America after signing a contract for his work, so I would like to meet him in person.”</p>
<p><em>How could this person be so casual?</em> Yuri tried to shun her confusion as she questioned him.</p>
<p>“― When did you learn about me?”</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been long. Until then I thought you were Hye-yeon Jin. I was surprised, but you must have had your own reasons. I’ll listen to the full story later.” Jae-won flashed a bright smile, his way of telling her not to worry.</p>
<p>The car accelerated on the highway and a couple of hours later, they arrived at a countryside pension.</p>
<p>Jae-won told Yuri to get out first before he parked the car. He opened the trunk and took out the water bottles and groceries. There was also a shopping bag with clothes. Yuri helped him carry the things.</p>
<p>“You need to stay here for a day or two. It’s not owned by Tae-jun so Grandfather wouldn’t know about it. The owner of this house will protect you. Tae-jun is considered to be one of Grandfather’s people, so he can’t get involved in this.”</p>
<p>“Won’t everything end if I just go back to America? I don’t want to drag out my relationship with Tae-jun. I have no thoughts of getting married to him either.”</p>
<p>“That … is not that easy. Grandfather is a dangerous and stubborn man who never gives up. In that sense, Tae-jun resembles him a lot.”</p>
