            <p><strong>Chapter 174 – Side Story (5)</strong></p>
<p>It was around the time Jihoo fell asleep when she received Tae-jun’s invitation. Yuri diligently sketched her slumbering son. It’d been three years since she’d been filling up her sketchbook with drawings of her son who’s growing up day by day.</p>
<p>He was a healthy child just like his father, energetic and clever when it came to both playing and talking. It was a great joy for her to see him growing up.</p>
<p>Having finished her sketch, she kissed the little one’s forehead and left the room. She then opened the invitation that Director Choi brought. It was their wedding anniversary invitation.</p>
<p>After their marriage, Tae-jun sent invitations like this every year to celebrate their anniversary except when she was in the postpartum period. He also sent her clothes that matched each time.</p>
<p>The location of the invitation was different every year. Once, it was a restaurant in a luxury hotel, a spa, a small theater, cinemas, and an amusement park. She even wondered if he was getting help from an event company.</p>
<p><em>Where would he invite me this time?</em></p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>Just like any other year, Yuri was invited to an unexpected place.</p>
<p><em>Are we going to an exhibition?</em></p>
<p>Unlike the first and second exhibition rooms, which were open to the public, the third exhibition room was for a few VIPs. It was a place to find buyers by displaying famous paintings and sculptures owned mainly by private collectors. It was also possible to hold a meeting while having a meal or refreshments.</p>
<p>Yuri was curious and also excited about the unexpected place. She put on bright color makeup and wore the clothes that Tae-jun sent her. It was a black dress with a deep slit.</p>
<p>Jihoo, who was playing blocks with Director Choi, saw Yuri and ran up on her.</p>
<p>“Wow, you look like a princess, Mom.”</p>
<p>“Do I look pretty today, Jihoo?”</p>
<p>“You’re the prettiest in the world!”</p>
<p>Seeing her son saying the same thing as his father, Yuri smiled softly. Then, she gently kissed his cheek.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother Director Choi, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>After responding to her confidently, he immediately ran to the blocks.</p>
<p>Tae-jun insisted that the wedding anniversary should be spent only with the two of them. He’d told the little one that there will be a wedding anniversary for Jihoo in the future, so there was no need for him to join in his parents’ time. She still didn’t know how her young son understood his father’s words, or perhaps, he just didn’t understand at all but he seemed to be cooperating quite well with him(TJ) since he neither begged her to bring him along nor told her not to go.</p>
<p>Yuri said to Director Choi, “Please take care of Jihoo. And don’t let him stay up late.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Have a good time with the president.”</p>
<p>The driver picked her up and headed to the art gallery. The front door of the gallery was closed since it was already past the closing time of the exhibition. Having already received the instructions, the driver called someone and the door opened. At the entrance, a woman who appeared to be a staff was waiting for Yuri. Seeing her get off the car, she bowed.</p>
<p>“Welcome. The president is waiting for you.” The staff escorted her to the third exhibition room.</p>
<p>As soon as Yuri stepped into the exhibition room, her eyes widened. What came into her eyes were her paintings. Most of them were made before Jihoo was born, but the exhibition could not be held because she had to concentrate on child-rearing.</p>
<p>Then…</p>
<p>“Ah!” She covered her mouth with her hand. The work on display in the center of the exhibition hall, which could be called the main, was ‘Apollo’.</p>
<p>‘Apollo’, which should be in a villa in Gangwon-do, was in front of Yuri. At the same time, the man sitting at the table in front of it caught her eyes. The man with the same eyes, nose, and mouth as ‘Apollo’. It was the man she loved more than anyone, her husband, Tae-jun Seo.</p>
<p>He stood up from the chair when he saw her coming in.</p>
<p>“Are you the artist of this work?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, she remembered what she told him a long time ago.</p>
<p><em><strong>“You’ll come to my exhibition and in front of my painting, you’ll ask who the artist is. Then, you’ll fall in love with me at first sight and ask me out on a date.</strong></em>”</p>
<p>Yuri responded as she smiled. “Yes?”</p>
<p>“You’re much more beautiful than I thought. Can I ask you out on a date?”</p>
<p>“Sorry but I have a husband and a son. And my husband is a jealous lover.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun pulled the chair as he smiled.  “If anyone tries to flirt with you at the exhibition, tell him what you just said.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think anyone will do that since they all know how scary you are.”</p>
<p>“Good to hear.”</p>
<p>“Is this my exhibition?” she asked as she looked around the hall.</p>
<p>“Yes. You’ve been taking a long break from work since Jihoo was born. I thought you’re going to miss this.” He gently caressed her shoulder.</p>
<p>Yuri was greatly touched by her husband who planned all this. This was something that she never expected. She couldn’t make time to look after herself because she was busy looking after her son, and she was thankful that her man knew that.</p>
<p>“How do you know me so well?”</p>
<p>“How can I not when my eyes are always on you? Should we have dinner first before taking a walk around the exhibition hall?”</p>
<p>“Dinner? Here?”</p>
<p>“I invited a famous chef.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, the server brought food from the inside. Courses of the meal came out one after another. They had wine with a great combination of seafood and meat.</p>
<p>Seeing that Yuri had emptied the dessert plate, Tae-jun stood up from his seat with a satisfied face.</p>
<p>“Can you please guide me through your work?” He slowly led her to the paintings displayed.</p>
<p>It was an exhibition just for two of them. She explained each of the paintings at length while he listened intently. He opened his mouth when they returned to ‘Apollo’ after taking a look at all her paintings in the room.</p>
<p>“Many people would’ve come and liked your paintings if we could hold the exhibition.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. But I’m okay, I have Jihoo.”</p>
<p>“But Jihoo will be start kindergarten next year. Seems like a good time to start painting again.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about it too. Thanks for being so caring”</p>
<p>“It’s my job to ensure your well-being. I love Yuri Han as my wife and Jihoo’s mother, but I also love you as an artist. Besides, I love your work too.”</p>
<p><em>How can he be so perfect like this?</em></p>
<p>Tae-jun didn’t take his eyes off of her as he stroked her hair. She felt her body getting hot, perhaps because of the wine she had at dinner.</p>
<p>She asked as if trying to calm herself down, “What did you like the most out of ‘em all?”</p>
<p>“I love all your works, but if I have to choose one, it’s Apollo. But sometimes I get jealous of it.” He pointed to the relief that resembled him. “I can see how much effort and love you put into that work. And I’m not in the time you spent with ‘that guy’. That’s what I’m jealous of.” He held her hand and kissed her palm.</p>
<p>Yuri spoke as she laughed, “Don’t be jealous. Apollo is a relief that I made thinking about you.”</p>
<p>Because it was the only light that remained in her empty memory.</p>
<p>He was looking at Apollo solemnly and frowned slightly. “I think there is a little bit of distortion.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>The artist herself knew best that her work couldn’t be perfect because it was a work made solely based on her memory.</p>
<p><em>‘But distortion? Where?’</em></p>
<p>Unlike Yuri whose face turned serious, there was a mischievous glint in Tae-jun’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a bit small?”</p>
<p>“Small? What’s small?”</p>
<p>Just then, he hugged and pulled her waist to him. His lower body, which was completely attached to hers, was hot as if on fire.</p>
<p>He whispered in her ear, “This one.”</p>
