            <p><strong>Chapter 166 – After Story (3)</strong></p>
<p>Somebody hugged her. A warmth surrounded her body. She could tell who the person was without looking. Her husband. Yuri opened her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>“Wh-when did you come?”</p>
<p>“Last night.”</p>
<p><em>‘Last night? Yesterday??’</em> Yuri tried to recollect. They should’ve had dinner together, but due to the flight delay, their plan got messed up. While waiting after an early dinner alone, she fell into unbearable drowsiness. Lately, she was sleepy, day and night. After telling Director Choi to wake her up, she closed her eyes. She fell asleep thinking that she would wake up after an hour, but it was already morning when she opened her eyes again. The sky, which had been gloomy all of yesterday, was clear.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I only planned to sleep for a short time. Why didn’t you wake me up?”</p>
<p>“Because you were in a deep sleep.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun pulled her to him as he answered calmly. Yuri felt sorry, so she fell into his arms.</p>
<p>He asked as he leaned on her head, “How are you feeling? I heard from Director Choi that you’ve been tired.”</p>
<p>“I think I’m going to grow. I feel sleepy and tired all day.”</p>
<p>She thought he would laugh at her but he didn’t. Yuri lifted her face that had been buried in his chest. His face looked a little solemn. She stroked his cheek.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you sleep well? Why is your face so rough?”</p>
<p>“…Because of the time difference.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to take a short nap? You still have time before the afternoon event. Take some rest while I’m away at the shop.”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, he grabbed her bottom and pulled her back into his arms. Because of the posture, she could feel that the man was excited. It’s always like this in the morning, but it’s even hotter today. He kissed her on the nape of her neck and slipped his hand under her clothes. His hand moved from her mounds and gripped her buds. Her body reacted quickly to his deft movements. She grabbed his wrist as she caught her breath.</p>
<p>“No. I said I need to go to the shop.”</p>
<p>“Don’t go to the shop. You said you’re tired. Just take a rest today. I know you don’t like being at that kind of place.”</p>
<p><em>‘It’s true that I find being at that kind of place uncomfortable, but why is acting like this today?’</em></p>
<p>He had always overly cared about her feelings and conditions, but today’s event was related to the late Chairman Seo.</p>
<p>The time Yuri spent with Chairman Seo during his lifetime was not long. A short greeting before her wedding, at her wedding venue, and on her honeymoon. That was it. He wasn’t against their marriage, but he didn’t like her either. Nevertheless, she occasionally remembered his deathbed. Without a word, Chairman Seo gave a gestured to his granddaughter-in-law to come closer, then clasped her hand tightly once. It must have meant that he was asking her to take care of  his grandson.</p>
<p>Tae-jun seemed determined and calm throughout Chairman Seo’s funeral, but he had a tough time overcoming the sorrow for a long time. To him, the chairman was a person with heavy meaning, and it was the same for other family members. Especially today, Chairman Soo-kyung Lee, as well as their family, celebrities, and ministers in the political and business sectors, were also in attendance. It was impossible for the wife of Seoin Group’s Chairman Seo Tae-jun to miss such an important event.</p>
<p>“It will probably be even more uncomfortable if I don’t go. There will be news about our divorce tomorrow morning,” she said, half-joking, half-serious.</p>
<p>She was prepared to some extent knowing that there would be a lot of things she had to deal with because she married a great man. He was the handsome, young, head of a group, and she was Cinderella, who he chose after breaking up with his fiancée from a similar background. This was the kind of story that the public admiresd. Reporters followed every move, gossip, and names came and went through the mouths of people they didn’t know. The reality was harsher than she had anticipated.</p>
<p>“Do you think I will let that news be posted?”</p>
<p>“But still, no.” Yuri took his hand off of her. Then, she whispered in his ears as if she was trying to comfort her husband. “I will let you do whatever you want at night.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun replied with a smile instead. She pulled the blackout curtains so he could fall asleep and adjusted the room temperature. After checking that he was asleep, she cautiously went out of the bedroom. As she went down to the first floor, Director Choi greeted her.</p>
<p>“Did you have a good sleep? The meal is ready.”</p>
<p>She could smell something delicious from the kitchen. She asked as she took a seat, “Did Tae-jun arrive late yesterday?”</p>
<p>“No, he wasn’t that late. He came about an hour after Madam fell asleep.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you wake me up?”</p>
<p>“The chairman told me not to. He seemed like he was looking through papers until late at night.”</p>
<p>“He just fell asleep. I think he’s struggling with the time difference. Please prepare a meal for him so he can have it when he wakes up.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
