            <p><strong>Chapter 82</strong></p>
<p><em>What secret is Hyeon-ah Kim holding onto?</em></p>
<p>The journey to Jinseong was filled with anxiety and thoughts. She didn’t completely trust the former manager, but she worked for the Jins for a decade or so. So, she was someone who would know something about them better than her. She had to face this no matter what it held in store for her.</p>
<p>A sudden phone call almost jolted the jittery Yuri. She thought it must be Tae-jun checking on her, but instead, it was Roy Jean. Yuri happily answered the call.</p>
<p>– “Yuri? Is that you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me, Yuri.”</p>
<p>–  “Where were you these past few days? Is everything okay?”  His voice was a mix of worry and concern.</p>
<p>“Yes, I accidentally dropped my phone in water. I just got it repaired.”</p>
<p>– “I thought something happened to you.”</p>
<p>“I apologize for not calling you. I’ve been preoccupied these days.”</p>
<p>– “You’re taking your medications properly?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She felt bad for lying but she didn’t want to worry him. Roy finally seemed relieved.</p>
<p>– “How are your memories? Are you making progress?”</p>
<p>“I’ve retrieved a few. I’m actually on my way to speak to someone who has an essential key to the secret.”</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>“Secret? What secret?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yuri hesitated for a moment, then answered.</p>
<p>“Murder.”</p>
<p>That was all she could say at the moment.</p>
<p><em>⸙ </em></p>
<p>“Welcome.”</p>
<p>Yuri walked into the café, and Hyeon-ah Kim greeted her. Her face was calm as usual, unlike someone who was about to reveal a secret.</p>
<p>“You’ve come a long way. Aren’t you tired? Do you want something to drink? Coffee? Juice?” She offered as if they were meeting casually.</p>
<p>“No thanks, I’m fine. What was it that you were trying to tell me about my father?” Seeing the other party’s carefree attitude, Yuri broached the subject.</p>
<p>“Why so hasty? Take some time to breathe. By the way, who drove you here? There are some suspicious-looking people outside over there.”</p>
<p>“I told you before. I know a person. They’re all hired by that person.” She wasn’t comfortable with how the woman was being nosy. If it weren’t for the information, she would have walked out.</p>
<p>“Oh right, Tae-jun Seo.”</p>
<p>Yuri’s eyes widened when Hyeon-ah mentioned his name. She had not mentioned this name ever but still, she knew.</p>
<p>“How do you know him?” she asked, a little guarded now.</p>
<p>“I saw him the other day, didn’t I? He’s quite famous. I’d seen him at Hotel Jinseong several times too. He got engaged recently, didn’t he? Is it okay for you to meet such a guy?”</p>
<p>“I just asked him for a favor while I’m in Korea. All aside, can you tell me about my father?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I keep losing track. Now’s not the time to talk about Tae-jun.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Hyeon-ah led her to a table. As Yuri was about to sit down, she heard a sound from the storage.</p>
<p>“Is someone in there?”</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah Kim was bringing coffee. She looked at the storage and shook her head. “There’s a cat in there once in a while.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.” Yuri’s eyes lingered a little in the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>“You seem to have gained some weight than before. You were always gorgeous, but you look way better. Don’t you have guys queuing up for you?” Hyeon-ah Kim insincerely let out a joke as she took a seat.</p>
<p>Hyeon-ah seemed so nonchalant, that Yuri felt suspicious, even so, she had to play along.</p>
<p>“Now tell me about my father’s accident.”</p>
<p>“To be honest … your father’s accident, might not have been an accident.” Her tone was grave as she spoke.</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>The truth was revealed at an unexpected moment. Hyeon-ah examined Yuri’s reaction as if she was looking out the window watching a passing scene, and then calmly bit on a cigarette. She puffed out a thick cloud of smoke and started her story.</p>
<p>“Was it a day before the accident … Maybe two days before? President Jin and Driver Han had an argument in the hotel lobby. Mr. Jin told his men to take him away. ”</p>
<p>“Father fought with President Jin? Why?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe this. <em>Father argued with President Jin …</em> The father she remembered obeyed every single command and agreed on everything the president said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details, but from what I heard, Mr. Han had his hands on Mr. Jin’s possession. I remember Mr. Jin furiously running around to have it back. Then, the accident happened. It’s strange. Your father would never drink because of his job normally, but he got hit by a car when fully drunk.”</p>
<p>“How could this be …”</p>
<p>Yuri clenched her fist.</p>
<p>“Did you tell the police about this?”</p>
<p>“The police?” Hyeon-ah Kim sniggered. “Honey, don’t you know what kind of frauds the cops at Jinseong are? They’re not going to flinch an inch even when they hear the story.”</p>
