            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 39</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the lull, the person on the other side spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did you come up with that idea?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roy was under the impression he knew Yuri well enough by now. Considering the time he had spent with her, her decision appeared genuinely out of character to him. If there was one thing she feared, it was confronting her memories. Even the times she’d recalled by chance were torturous, let alone seeking it upfront. He had borne witness to it all- the dread, agony, and helplessness. So, this was truly shocking to him. Though the outcome was abrupt, he knew something must have affected it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Yuri knew her words had thrown Roy into a conundrum. She knew what he was thinking. However, she couldn’t just bring herself to confide in him. For reasons unknown to herself, she hesitated to confess her recent findings –most of all, about the death of her friend, Hye-yeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She shook her head as if doing so would clear things. Everything was still vague–her father’s death, the ten days she went missing, and the man who was relentlessly in search of her. These were the missing pieces of the puzzle she’d been avoiding to solve. Hidden deep in the recesses of her mind, it had provoked and tormented her time and again, refusing to let her be, driving her to the point of death and back. Now, it had chosen to resurface in full view, albeit in traces as if challenging her for a duel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roy… Images I can’t make sense of keep popping in my head[7] . I think they’re related to my lost memories, but it’s difficult to explain.” She pursed her lips before she went on. “But one thing is clear for sure, I think I’ve forgotten something I shouldn’t have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as she said that Yuri was unsure if she had really lost something that she mustn’t forget, or if she was trying to recollect something she mustn’t remember. However, these images were incessantly haunting her. She was at a stage where she couldn’t ignore them let alone get rid of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it?” asked a perplexed voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know what it is, but flashbacks come every once in a while. I’m sure it will make sense over time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t clear who her words were trying to reassure, her or her listener. She wasn’t sure if they would make sense like she’d said, because right now, although she was determined to face them, she wasn’t sure if she had the required courage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silence hung in the air once again. With a heavy heart, Roy eventually spoke…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you have a place to stay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am looking for a place available to rent for a short while only. I will let you know once I find out more about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be inconvenient for her to stay in a hotel, so she had decided on this recourse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Will you be ok doing everything all alone?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry. I am taking my meds regularly, and paying attention to myself. It won’t take that long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her last sentence was more of a hunch than an actual fact. For some reason, she could feel that it was close. She didn’t know the whys and hows, but she knew the series of inexplicable events would bring her to the answers and sooner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the call with Roy, she put her phone back into the purse and checked her makeup one more time. Eventually, her eyes gravitated to the ivory business card on the vanity table.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Hotel Seoin, Director Jae-won Lee.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>If it is ok with you, can you give me a call before you go back to the States?</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was a well-mannered man, equipped with a kind face. He seemed like a guy who would have no dearth of admirers: good-looking, rich and capable, a man of every woman’s dream. But Yuri did not feel any chemistry with him. She appreciated his favor but did not want to get personally involved with him. It was better to make a clean cut while she still could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She picked up the card, tore it up bit by bit before depositing the remains into the nearby trash can.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a busy morning at Daejin Department Store, and especially so for Director Yoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Si-yeon had received word that the installation was completed. All that remained now was for her to make a personal trip for inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was about to step out of her office and head to the lounge to take a look when she stilled at the sight of the oncoming person. Not just her, even Secretary Kim beside her stood wide-eyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dapper Tae-jun was standing at the door. It wasn’t like he had never visited here, but this time it was particularly different. He’d arrived unannounced– forget a phone call, not even his secretary was accompanying him! Of course, the two women would be dazed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s going on? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she thought, Secretary Kim quickly shot up from her seat, bowed to Tae-jun before indirectly querying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good morning, Director Seo. How can I help you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to talk to her.” His reply was succinct.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, that would be his reason. But the question was, what did he want to talk about?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Si-yeon stared at the man, trying to read his intention. Even after keenly observing, she could not find a single clue. His face was impassive, voice monotonous. If it was work-related, he would have been accompanied by his secretary. Considering their relationship, even if they were set to be married, they were more business associates than lovers.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what does he want?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed like Si-yeon would be clueless as long as the man did not take the initiative to divulge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, please come in.” Si-Yeon opened her office door, allowing him in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could you wait for a moment? We just installed a new exhibit in the VIP lounge, I need to confirm if everything is ok for the last time. It won’t take long…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tae-jun seemed to have no inclination to enter the office, as he remained rooted to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aren’t you coming in?” Si-yeon wondered what this man was up to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will come with you. I would like to see it as well.” He replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was shocked by his reply. Since when did this ‘dour being’ develop an interest in the goings-on at her office?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to see the Heart of Apollo.” Seeing her blank face, he emphasized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The director and her secretary stared at him, mouth agape in disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun did not even give them room to answer, he strode ahead and simply pushed the button and summoned the elevator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As discreetly as she could, Si-yeon ordered her secretary to figure out what was up with this man. Secretary Kim, who’d planned on the same, quickly texted his secretary and asked why his boss was at their office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waiting for the elevator, Si-yeon reinitiated the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t know you were interested in the Heart of Apollo. Do you know Roy Jean?” As she spoke she looked at him, in case he gave away something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, but not for long.” He replied flatly, immersing the other further into the guessing game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, you’ve only heard about him recently?” Si-yeon asked as the elevator reached them, and the doors slid open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entering first, Tae-jun leaned against the furthest wall in the back. The two ladies followed shortly after. Kim pushed the button for the VIP lounge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jae-won mentioned he’s been planning to purchase Roy Jean’s pieces for Hotel Seoin’s lobby.” He eventually explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, that’s why you came.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’d finally understood the reason behind his abrupt arrival, albeit finding it a little strange. But this man was never known to behave conventionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is Roy Jean here?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, he’s not here,” she said in a relaxed manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why? It is such an important and expensive project. He should be here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He had prior commitments in Japan. I was in a hurry, so the installation was managed by his assistant.” She explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ok, then she must be alone.” Tae-jun mumbled in a low voice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
