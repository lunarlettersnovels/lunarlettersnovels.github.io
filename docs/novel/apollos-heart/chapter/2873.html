            <p><strong>Chapter 132 – That Should Be Me (1)</strong></p>
<p>Hye-seong recalled the time he visited the house Tae-jun Seo and Yuri Han shared. He didn’t know what made him go there; <em>did he miss Yuri then?</em> <em>Or was he just curious?</em> Probably both since he had always wanted Yuri. She reminded him of a flower because of its pureness, always clean and beautiful unlike him who was more of a mudslide.</p>
<p>The end of their good relationship was bitter, but he couldn’t stop himself from longing for her. Perhaps knowing that he wouldn’t be able to have her ignited the thirst even more.</p>
<p>And of course, Hye-seong justified all his actions thus far- making one excuse after another. It was what he does best after all! <em>What’s so important about physical relationships anyway? As long as I don’t break my heart… </em>Unfazed by her professor’s persistent bullying, Yuri was thrown into the mess that is Tae-jun Seo. <em>And unexpectedly, she still bloomed so beautifully,</em> Hye-seong thought.</p>
<p>As he thought of this, Hye-seong promised himself that he would start over with Yuri Han. He would do absolutely everything.</p>
<p>When he got to the front of the house, however, his dreams and hopes were shattered in an instant. It was already late at night but the two were still in the garden, clearly having a hearty conversation, Her laughs and giggles made their way to his ears. <em>Why is she laughing? Isn’t Yuri supposed to struggle for having to live every single day with her traumas?</em></p>
<p>Hye-seong’s face contorted into madness, clenching his fists so tightly it drew blood. He drove his car to a much higher ground where he could see the garden in plain sight, settling on a vacant space where a house would be erected soon. He took a set of binoculars from the glove compartment, adjusted the scope, and peeped into the garden. He saw all of the lights lit up. It was bright and he could see everything well.</p>
<p>“Fucking hell!” Hye-seong cursed.</p>
<p>The glass table was shaking underneath Yuri’s weight. Tae-jun Seo settled between her legs, her slender arms wrapped around his back, clutching the fabric. Her skirt was rolled up to her waist. It didn’t take long for Hye-seong to know what it was they were doing.</p>
<p>Hye-seong, seemingly out of his mind, directed the scope to Yuri’s face. Her face was flustered, eyes closed in bliss as she gnawed on her lip. She looked so beautiful that he could only stare at her in wonder. The sight of Yuri on the verge of passion made him shiver with lust.</p>
<p><em>That should be me!</em></p>
<p>Yuri should be writhing and moaning underneath him, looking at him ecstatically, not Tae-jun Seo! Hye-seong couldn’t stand it anymore as he undid the buttons of his pants, hastily grabbing his own length. He moved his hand up and down, eyes still intently on Yuri, who wrapped her arms around Tae-jun’s head.</p>
<p>The glass table stopped moving just as Hye-seong reached his climax. He hissed at the mess on his hand. Irritated, he grabbed the wet tissue and cleaned up. in the garden, Tae-jun and Yuri shared a kiss. They arranged their disheveled appearance, smiling at each other with loving eyes. The great Tae-jun Seo helping a woman clean herself and take care of her was a sight. It looked like they were indeed lovers. Like she was <em>his </em>lover.</p>
<p>Hye-seong still didn’t lower the binoculars, still paying close attention to Yuri’s face. He looked on, noting that she didn’t look like she was forced in any way. It couldn’t be denied that she adored the man.</p>
<p>Despite her fragile and seemingly compliant appearance, she was actually stubborn to a fault. When she disliked something, she would make sure you’d know it as well. She was always straight to the point, strong, and confident of herself. He knew that part of her that was why he gave all his efforts just so he could please her. He didn’t even fail to be considerate of her, knowing that she had suffered a trauma caused by the professor’s sexual harassment. But despite all his efforts, Yuri simply didn’t give him the time of day, even as simple as a light peck on the cheek was not bestowed.</p>
<p>“I’ve been so considerate to you and even came back to you!” Hye-seong gritted his teeth as Tae-jun and Yuri made their way inside the house.</p>
<p>“Yuri… you…!”</p>
<p>His eyes, rimmed with seething, as hatred simmered in his chest. And from that moment, a sudden thought popped into his mind.</p>
<p><em>She needs to die, or he would need to break her so no one else could have her.</em></p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>Yuri was astonished. Unable to control her exasperation anymore, she let out a pitiful scream. The thoughts about the killings of her father and Hye-yeon, losing her memories at that… was all too heavy to bear. No matter how rocky a start she and Tae-jun had, everything was just too much. Her body shook uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Hye-seong laughed at her crestfallen form.  “Your father’s behavior was rather unexpected. I thought I’d catch the whore like one would a rat. I tried to steal the ledger and take them back to my master. Do you have any idea how much I suffered when my father died because of that? Where the hell did you hide the damn ledger and the list?” Hye-seong barked at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>“Do you even know what you’ve done?! You killed them. Both my father and Hye-yeon! You murderer!” Yuri screamed.</p>
