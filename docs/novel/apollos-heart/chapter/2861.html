            <p><strong>Chapter 144 – Ledger (1)</strong></p>
<p>Tae-jun could not hide his embarrassment at the innocent question that asked if it hurt him. It did hurt him. The moment her slender fingers stroked his back, his manh0od engorged and was squished by the bed.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing like that.”</p>
<p>“Or…,”</p>
<p>Yuri looked at him getting up and stopped breathing for a moment. The object between his legs was visibly upright to the point that it looked gross.</p>
<p>“I can’t stand it when you touch me like that. If you don’t want to do more, then we better stop here.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun held onto his own with a hardened expression. He was acting odd today. Normally, he would greedily desire Yuri without hesitation. Probably it was because of the warning that his wounds might not heal properly. No, if they were solely concerned about the wounds, there were plenty of other ways to satisfy his sexual desire.</p>
<p>Yuri, who was about to turn around, froze at the sudden epiphany that struck her like lightning. The reason he was holding it in, the reason he was showing full respect to her, the reason his body was covered with burns and wounds and scars… The reason was Yuri.</p>
<p>She approached Tae-jun.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>He looked at the girl kneeling between his legs, with a puzzled face. She carefully reached out to his erect rod.</p>
<p>“I’ll… do it for you.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need.”</p>
<p>The shaft that was already standing tall, was about to burst just from her rubbing. Even though it was already time for it to subside, he refused her contact.</p>
<p>“Why? Aren’t you struggling?”</p>
<p>“You don’t prefer this. Don’t force yourself.” He was aware that she did not prefer using her mouth and hands during s*xual int*rcourse.</p>
<p>She looked up at him and said, “I want to give you something. You got hurt because of me.”</p>
<p>Speechless, he stared at her for a while.</p>
<p>At the unexpected reaction, he cautiously asked, “Am I too clumsy at it?”</p>
<p>He chuckled. “No way. Do you know how much I have been craving for your touch?” He touched her lips as if he were painting with his fingers. Then he whispered, “At moments like this, I always thought about you… with my hands.”</p>
<p>She gilded her body between his legs and slowly brought her lips to his rod. Her tongue licked the pre-cum that was ejaculating from it…</p>
<p>“Ha—”</p>
<p>It was an instinctive sound. Tae-jun let out a low mo*n and put his hand into her hair. Confused whether to stop her or push her deeper, he ended up simply stroking the back of her head.</p>
<p>Yuri swallowed the whole thing after licking the surface for a while. It was especially warm and large today.  She had not even put it halfway but was already out of breath.</p>
<p>“Only as much as you can. There’s no need to try too hard.”</p>
<p>Motivated by his soothing voice, she opened her mouth wider. A hand that did not know where to go ended up on his thighs. She sucked hard that which was stuffed in her mouth. She tightened her lips with strength. Every time she pressed his gl@ns with the roof of her mouth, he sighed audibly. She felt peculiar. She had never gained pleasure from this action before. However, she was pleased for the first time to see the man mo@n in pleasure because of her. As she watched him gro@n and twitch his thigh muscles,she wished he could feel a little more.</p>
<p>She raised her gaze as if examining his condition. She could feel her heart beat rapidly. Tae-jun looked shockingly erotic, provocative, and destructive as he exhaled and brushed up his hair. His eyes hers, held her hand, and placed it on his test*cles. She massaged them gently. He could not help but clench her hair firmly.</p>
<p>“May I come inside?”</p>
<p>He could not be more patient than this. If she rejected, he would obediently peel himself off her body. However, she nodded.</p>
<p>Relieved, he penetrated deeper. Although he was worried that she might be too exhausted, he simultaneously moved his waist. His jaw dropped. He could not suppress a mo@n from slipping out of his throat. At the same time, warm liquid seeped into her mouth.</p>
<p>After a moment of relaxation, he pulled his body away from hers. She touched her mouth. It was not her first oral s*x, but it was her first time having s*men in her mouth.</p>
<p><em>Did she have to swallow it or spit it out?</em> She looked up at Tae-jun in confusion.</p>
<p>He stroked her neck and asked gently, “Can you swallow it?”</p>
<p>She nodded and lightly moved her neck, he smirked and placed his lips on hers. He opened up her lips and sucked all of his fluid from her mouth. He then licked her mouth for a while, then said. “This is the first time tasting my own.”</p>
<p>She was still short of breath, he lifted and hugged her. He placed her body on top of his. She tried to budge in case she puts pressure on his injuries, but he pressed her back to hold her still. Then he kept stroking her hair and back.</p>
<p>This was not to sexually arouse her. <em>Then what was it for?</em></p>
<p>Even Tae-jun did not know. Nor did he know that they had something left to talk about.</p>
<p>Yuri lifted her head up after a minute. She met his eyes and said in a low voice, “Let’s go find the ledger tomorrow. I would appreciate it if you join me.”</p>
