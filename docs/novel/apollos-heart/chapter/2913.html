            <p><strong>Chapter 91</strong></p>
<p>Thanatos, in Greek mythology, was the personification of death. Merciless and indiscriminate, he was hated by mortals and gods alike.</p>
<p>The doctor before Davis looked at Yuri pathetically as he counseled about this God of Death. Unfortunately, his counseling was no help whatsoever. At least she had never felt a desire for Thanatos: self-destruction or death.</p>
<p>It’s a popular prognosis that those with suicidal tendencies also suffer from attention deficit syndrome or ADS. In severe cases, in a bid to garner attention, the patient resorts to self-infliction of pain. Slicing of the wrist, swallowing a handful of sleeping pills, etc, are a few of the common methods towards the same.</p>
<p>However, Yuri had no such desire. Attention and death were never on her mind. If anything, she just wanted a chance to really relax. She wanted her head to stop aching, for those dreams that kept tormenting her to disappear, to get some deep, undisturbed sleep.</p>
<p>The doctor had been wrong from the start- the one she truly desired was Thanatos’ twin brother Hypnos, God of Sleep.</p>
<p>And yet, she could swear that now was the only time she had ever wanted self-destruction and death. Right now, at this moment, the moment she met Tae-jun Seo’s eyes.</p>
<p>She felt a strong desire to become the vial that was thrashed by his hand, the pill that was mashed by his foot, or the glass that shattered into pieces. It was due to these morbid emotions that were surging within her that she had said the words that she should have kept to herself.</p>
<p>“Does it annoy you that your Barbie doll is a drug addict? Does it disgust you that you made out with such filth?” She sniggered, looking at the man the world touted as Mr. Perfect in the eye. Would he be considered as tainted now? Because of her …</p>
<p>Tae-jun’s face turned whiter than a sheet and stiffer than a mannequin. He fiercely gripped her chin.</p>
<p>“What did you just say?”</p>
<p>Although those were the words, his eyes were saying otherwise. One more word and he’d kill her.</p>
<p>Yuri’s chin was so firmly grasped that she was unable to open her mouth. She gazed at him, incessantly gasping.</p>
<p>“I’ve never thought of you that way and I never had the means to mistreat you. Nonetheless, if that’s what you want, I guess why not.”</p>
<p>His voice was agonizing, eyes seething with anger. He was thoroughly provoked, losing all sense of reason.</p>
<p>Tae-jun pulled Yuri to the living room and shoved her onto the couch. The force was so great that she felt pain even though she had landed on a soft surface.</p>
<p>He straddled on top of her and pressed on the slender body trying so hard to escape. He pushed his hand up her dress, yanked her underwe@r stripping her down naked to open her legs wide. Her lady parts twitched at the sudden coldness as the man savagely unbuckled his belt and pulled down his pants.</p>
<p>Yuri became pale as a ghost.</p>
<p>“Wh-what do you think you’re doing?!”</p>
<p>Obviously she was not wet at all. She was actually awkward and stiff from her agony and nervousness. However, Tae-jun’s reaction was absolutely unsympathetic and hostile. He looked as if he was possessed by a fiendish madness that would heed to nothing and no one.</p>
<p>“Shut up! Didn’t you want to be treated this way?” He forced her knees wide and penetr@ted at once.</p>
<p>“Ow!” Yuri whimpered in pain and abruptly twisted her body.</p>
<p>His eager fondling was not enough to ease the pain of penetr@tion. Nevertheless, she was at a loss of words when he attacked her without even a notice. The pain was breathtaking. Veins popped up as she clenched on the couch.</p>
<p>“Open up completely.” He ordered.</p>
<p>Then, seizing her thighs that were wreathed with marks made by his lips, he mercilessly shoved his manhood all the way through. He strenuously twisted his shaft inside of the narrow dry tunnel.</p>
<p>Yuri flinched and bit her lips. The painful workout ultimately made her wet and slippery. When it became smoother for him to move, he grasped her hips and thrust forcefully.</p>
<p><em>Was this also s*x?</em> All she could feel was hot flesh pushing and pulling inside her. Ironically, her head, blood, and heart felt numb … frozen.</p>
<p>This wasn’t like any of the times she had had so far. In that, she would be seething from head to toe, there would not be an inch of her body inside and outside, that wasn’t being driven to a frenzy. So much so, that at times she was worried she would lose herself from such great heat.</p>
<p>No matter how exhausting or demanding those times had been, they were never this horrible. Not even the time when she was pulled into Tae-jun’s arms after she had lost her memories felt this appalling. This act of pleasure had turned into abuse, a nightmare … gone was the intimacy and euphoria that it usually brought along.  She let the beast in him unleash its wrath, control her every move while she lay there limp, benumbed like a broken, lifeless doll.</p>
