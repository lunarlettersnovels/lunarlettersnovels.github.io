            <p><strong>Chapter 152</strong></p>
<p>“I should’ve seen it coming when workers had started to bustle in and out the apartment for total inspection and repair. Perhaps it’s the new owner who has offered to cover your medical fees. But I’m yet to see the owner myself as well. It was only his representative that I saw. But according to the person in charge of the repair, the owner will soon drop by for an inspection. I think you can thank him when he comes.”</p>
<p>The owners changed, no wonder the issue of her medical expenses was resolved without a big dispute. Although she was delighted with the new electric wirings, she hoped that it wouldn’t lead to an increase in the rent. As she went up to her house, Yuri made a mental note about informing the agency, who she had entrusted with the contract of her apartment, about the new owner.</p>
<p>Two weeks literally flew by after that and Yuri had her every soul and mind focused on the last preparations for her exhibition. Although she still wasn’t fit to work with pencils or brushes, she managed to get some light work done like adding final touches or corrections.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the invitation cards and pamphlets for her exhibition had all come out fine. And luckily enough, she was able to take the cast off her arm the very day before the opening of her exhibition.</p>
<p>So she made it to the press conference in the black dress which was specially prepared for her by the agency.</p>
<p>“What is it that you’re depicting from your work?” was one of the question which greeted her.</p>
<p>“It’s my present, what I drew about.”</p>
<p>Present… The time that is magically beautiful yet lasts for only a split moment throughout our lives. Though the memories will soon fade with time, what we feel in the present shall never die.</p>
<p>Well-wishes and questions regarding her future plans came and went during the press conference after that.</p>
<p>The exhibition was to be held for a total of seven days. The first day was conducted in the form of a cocktail party with only invited personnel from the agency, reporters, and critics. The reviews she got from the critics were never so good. Most of them thought highly of the potential she’d shown in her work. The exhibition was then opened to the public from the second day onwards. It was quite a success considering that this was her first solo exhibition.</p>
<p>“This is indeed a success for a first solo exhibition. We’re getting quite a lot of queries regarding your works as well.”</p>
<p>The manager made no effort to hide her joy as her months of hard work had successfully come to fruition. It was true enough as she already had quite a few of her works sold during the exhibition. More so, all of them were sold at prices much higher than her last works. Money was good indeed but what pleased her the most was the fact that she was getting all the more recognition as an artist.</p>
<p>Eventually, the closing day of the exhibition finally arrived and there was a downpour just as the weather report had predicted. The exhibition hall seemed almost empty as a result. But then there was Yuri, who was taking her time browsing around the room as if to burn every detail of her first solo exhibition into her head. The exhibition meant a lot to her as it was something she’d been dreaming about for so long.</p>
<p>But it was when she was engraving such indescribable feelings deep into her heart that she caught a glimpse of someone’s back that looked awfully familiar to her somehow. It belonged to a fairly tall man, who had been standing before ‘Apollo’ for quite a long while.</p>
<p><em>No, it can’t be.</em></p>
<p>She was convinced that it was just another delusion resulting from her longing for him as this wasn’t her first time being deceived by her own imagination.</p>
<p><em>There’s no way he’ll be here</em>.</p>
<p>But no matter how much her heart screamed out that it wouldn’t be him, it wasn’t enough to stop her from walking up to the man.</p>
<p>Upon noticing her approaching, the familiar figure turned his back from ‘Apollo’. Instantly, Yuri gasped in shock when she realised that he wasn’t an illusion after all. Thinking back, it wouldn’t have been possible for her to be mistaken in the first place as his face was the first thing she could think of whenever she closed her eyes. The man had the exact same eyes, nose, and lips as the relief.</p>
<p>It was him, Tae-Jun Seo, who was staring at her right now, but only more charming than she ever remembered.</p>
<p>“Tae-Jun?” asked Yuri, still in her bewilderment.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s me.”</p>
<p>She felt a sudden wave of emotions creeping across her chest. She was completely at a loss for words as never in her wildest dreams had she imagined finding him standing before her right here. Watching her standing agape, Tae-jun stepped up and broke the silence between them.</p>
<p>“How have you been?”</p>
<p>She felt an ache in her pounding heart as his words made her gasp for breath. She had no idea if she were to answer or give her greetings to him as her mind was all jumbled up. After regaining her composure by telling herself that she was only flustered due to his sudden appearance, she finally managed to get a few words out of her mouth.</p>
<p>“How come, you’re….”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m here for the exhibition.”</p>
<p>Yuri found his answer not in the least bit helpful to her jumbled mind as what she really wanted to know was the reason he came to her exhibition… But in contrast to her, who was still looking puzzled, Tae-jun stared intently into her eyes without a falter. Then he spoke again, slowly but surely.</p>
<p>“I’ve come to start over with Yuri Han, <em>again</em>.”</p>
<p><em>⸙⸙⸙</em></p>
