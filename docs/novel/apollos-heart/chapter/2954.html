            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 50</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed Tae-jun had forgotten his long standing tenet– s*x was a game of pleasure between a man and a woman. But right now, the only thing left was an instinct screaming within that he had to have her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of flesh against flesh rang loudly. As pain turned to pleasure inch by inch, Yuri felt m0ans escaping from her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was heady as she felt him inside, and the sensations were waking something that was lying dormant in her. A light blinked beyond the black curtains of her memory.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is this?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something was trying to rip and come out of the curtains. Yuri reached out and tried to grab it without thought. However, her hands touched Tae-jun’s face instead of her fragmented memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A suppressed m0an slipped out of Tae-jun’s mouth. Yuri was startled to find a strange sensation of something burning rolling within her. The man held her tightly as she tried to escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stay still.” He growled a warning and hugged her hips even closer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was in a frenzy, seemingly trying to leave as much of himself in her as he also clim@xed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun did not take himself out even after he was done. Yuri tried to push him away, but he remained hard inside her. He rolled her over to the side and pulled her into his arms, burying himself in her neck and reaching out to grab her twin peaks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri flinched and shrank as he toyed with her hard n!pples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You haven’t enjoyed yourself yet.” His raspy voice sounded by her ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His hands wandered below her flat stomach and between her legs. She was wet with his come and her juices, and was still wide open with his member inside. He caressed where they met and thrust deeper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are going for it now.” He declared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop!” She made a feeble attempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was deep inside her. Her walls engulfed and tightened their hold on him as if she had been waiting for this very moment. She was shocked, her body betrayed her and welcomed Tae-jun in. Her body was now thoroughly awake from this brief experience. He filled her, and she felt her body fit him in. Her skin was so sensitive that she could feel his shape and pulsating veins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah-“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mo@ns were different from before. Her bre*sts were crushed in his grip. As he rolled her n*pples with his palms, her husky mo@ns became louder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, umm-“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound was pure music to his ears. Tae-jun’s hand lowered to stroke her intimate spots. He was still ravaging her, where they remained connected. The lewd noises and the springs of the mattress rang in her ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He worked her sweet spots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re incredible. Still so tight.” He whispered between pants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt herself being pulled along with him with each movement. She was already soaked, and her body pulled as if to suck him in. He knew that he should not overwhelm her with his strength, but he could not control himself. Every time he plunged into her, her body rattled as if she was about to break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah-“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri gasped in shock and passion with every movement Tae-jun made. He stared at her face overwhelmed with ple@sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why did you disappear?” He demanded out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He spoke in a voice that froze Yuri’s flushed body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between wakefulness and slumber treads a fine line of clarity. When one is exhausted physically, exhilarated mentally, this line of clarity is at its hazy best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri was in and out of stupor. One moment she was in pain, and another ecst@sy. She had lost all semblance of time and place. Her senses had long forsaken her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why, his question, out of nowhere, seemed surreal at first. When she came to it, with a lot of effort, Yuri managed to open her mouth only after sensing that the movements had stilled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?” She couldn’t even hear herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had been doing this until the morning of my business trip. And you simply vanished when I was away… for four years!” Anger, accusation, reproach, and even a hint of feeling betrayed, was evident in the tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his frenzy, Tae-jun plunged into Yuri with a heady sound. The more he ravaged her, the more insatiable he was. Tonight, he cared about nothing but feeding his feral carnal appetite like there would be no tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her breath choked as he flicked her already swollen cl*toris. Her world turned black as a fierce pleasure pierced through everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah-“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri’s thighs trembled, her back arched. She tightened her hold on him as juices flowed out. Out of her control, her body seemed to have woken up from a long period of venereal void.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun also creased his face and held his breath. He had come and was trying to enjoy her as much as possible… he found it impossible to control himself nor did he desire to. He had plunged into a bottomless abyss after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let go a little. The night’s still long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before his raspy words reached her, he had begun to stroke her cl*toris. However, Yuri was limp from the sensations that repeatedly overwhelmed her. Tae-jun clicked his tongue as he observed her heave with her face buried in the sheets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was not dense to not know how a woman felt when he was inside her. He was well-aware he had overwhelmed her, her body was too weak to go further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri was of a slender build, smooth muscles in her arms and legs; a decent vitality, and nimble. But now, she looked almost emancipated, demure, and too frail for him… like a light breeze would crumble her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun’s erect!on was still high as he extracted himself from her core.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those long-forgotten carnal desires had rushed back in hysteria. Like a parched earth devouring water… a famished beast prey, Tae-jun who had never recovered from Yuri’s sudden disappearance from his life, upon their unexpected reunion, had succumbed to delirium and abandoned all reason. There was only one thing governing him: he would not let go of her again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, she was spent. No, he was not sated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He gulped some wine and fed it to Yuri with his mouth. Eyes still closed, she frowned, at the taste of the drink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want alcohol,” she said meekly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to drink.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun licked the wine that trickled from her mouth to her neck. Yuri’s color finally returned after he gave a few more swallows. As he spread her thighs, their juices flowed out of where he had released.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a wolf roused by the scent of blood, his blood boiled at the sight of the oozing fluid… he wanted her even more badly. As he slid himself in, because of the wine, her hold on him was tighter than before. He pushed away her hands that were trying to hide her face. Her inebriated, flushed face was breathtakingly beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never knew I could see you and be inside you like this again.” He sounded like he had found his long lost treasure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He kissed her, his t0ngue ravaged everywhere inside her mouth. He was feasting on her, up and below.</span></p>
