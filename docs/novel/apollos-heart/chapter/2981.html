            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 23</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the warm rays of the sun that snuck past the lofty branches, she sat there on the bench immersed in a world of her own. A pair of abandoned high heels lay by the naked feet in the company of an empty beer can that had served its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unknown force dragged Tae-jun towards the girl, his pace subconsciously quickened. Yet, the source of it all, continued to be oblivious, moving her deft fingers over the sketchbook even as the man stood inches behind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hye-yeon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She turned towards the low voice resonating above her head. Her eyes widened in surprise upon the sight of her most unexpected visitor. She quickly recovered and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, what a surprise running into you here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes were clear and bright. When she gazed into his eyes directly, Tae-jun felt an inexplicable commotion in the forsaken corner of his heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t know you were a student here.” Her mesmerizing eyes agitated his heart further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m on leave at the moment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Was your work part of today’s exhibit, by any chance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the large number of high-profile invitees, it was most definitely an important event for the art students. In fact, it could compare to their graduation ceremony. This was where they would take their first step into the real world, build networks, and whatnot. Moreover, the guests were their potential clients and sponsors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He turned his attention to the sketchbook. Her skills were impressive, even at a fleeting glance. She could give her peers a run for their money, and yet, here she was!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before he knew it, a can of beer was in his hands. It seems this girl was not just skilled with her hands; she’d nimbly eluded his question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of habit, he lit a cigarette and looked towards her only to find her glaring at him. Apparently, the smoke was bothering her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the staring contest didn’t last long; her firm gaze and Tae-jun had reluctantly taken the cigarette out of his mouth and flicked it into the bin nearby. Satisfied, she tossed the can to accompany the ciggy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a long story.” She thought this should stop his probing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The kind of story that made you drink alone in the middle of the day?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite a curious cat this one is!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you always this curious about other people’s private lives? And why are you so informal with me? We’re not at the hotel anymore.” She was visibly miffed at his intrusion.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at this!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tae-jun scoffed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That makes us even, don’t you think? Aren’t you the one who started! You can go ahead and be rude to me all you like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stared at him as though dumbfounded. He fixed his gaze squarely upon her eyes, unwilling to back off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right then, he suddenly felt a wave of a nausea-like sensation. Something shook violently within, which permeated into his beating heart. It was an intense attraction that he had never experienced before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as she parted her lips, her cell phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID and closed the sketchbook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She got off the bench, staggered as she put her heels on. Tae-jun held her arm to steady her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad move! A shiver ran down his spine the moment he grasped her slender limb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, thank you.” She said politely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A burning sensation spread, from the fingertips that touched her to the rest of his body. He felt unbearably thirsty.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is this?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tae-jun stood rooted, staring down at his hand for a while before turning towards the direction in which she had left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He saw her walking away with a man. He felt an indescribable ache in his heart as he watched her smile at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, Tae-jun simply did not care whether this feeling was love or lust. He was going insane over his desire for her. He gave a damn to everything. All he wanted was to make her his, and </span><b>only his</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Present Day-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He dreamed that he made love to the woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she was Hye-yeon, but she was not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He took his time with her, savoring the moments she clung to him as she looked at him with eyes bathed in ecstasy. Wrapped in his arms, she always received him with a softness that soothed and excited his senses at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning, they had been well suited for each other. Even if it was a deal, it was suffused with passion. She was pure, untainted… waiting just for him to mold her as he wished. He had done just that, enjoying every bit, every moment. And the more he tamed her, she continued to fit him even better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adored her madly, so much so that he could not imagine being with any other woman. In a way, she too had tamed him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ha…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sweet moan escaped her lush lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun withdrew the finger deposited deep inside her cave. The red flesh twitched, nectar trickled down his finger. Slowly, he licked his fragrant and sweet finger. It was as if she was a fruit given to him for his consumption only. Something that was only his, something that only he could have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun spread her legs and entered her. As he went all the way in, without even an inch of room, she twisted herself slightly. He squeezed her waist and thrust into her repeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he moved faster, her whimperings filled the air. To him, her entire body was a musical instrument, producing sound at his touch. His excitement gradually soared, he swiftly turned her over and grasped her br*asts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mmm, please…” Her soft plea fueled his hunger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just a little more.” He coaxed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was going crazy. Each time he had her, he felt an overwhelming desire to devour her whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He lowered his hand from her br*ast and rubbed her cl*tor*s. As the passion intensified, she pleaded urgently… in the midst of the sounds of slapping flesh, she reached the apex. He sank his teeth into her smooth shoulder and let out a loud grunt. He climaxed almost at the same time as she did, feeling completely at one with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panting, he lovingly kissed the top of her head, delighted that she kept to his pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he was about to call her name, he suddenly froze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t know her name. He knew every inch of her body… but not her name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
