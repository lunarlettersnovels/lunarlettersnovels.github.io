            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 46</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afresh, Yuri wondered what happened to her on the day she lost her memories. Burying her head between her knees, Yuri scorned herself. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did she lose so many memories?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The death of her father, the death of Hye-yeon, and the man who could have possibly been her lover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there was one thing that she could be certain about, it was that the relationship did not end on good terms. Either he or she had left the other, and what was written on the ending page of their relationship was not happily ever after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri would not be surprised if he left her as that was more realistic than the other way around, but seemingly, the circumstances pointed to the opposite. Either way, she could not understand why Tae-jun was still antagonized by her as it had been four years already and he, by all means, was engaged to another woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–          </span><b><i>“We have a lot to talk about from now on.”</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something to talk about from now on? Then why did he not talk about it in the past four years? Is it because of his engagement?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surging questions occupied her mind. Soon, she could vaguely assume Tae-jun’s intentions. Engagement between two of the most powerful families required precautions. If Yuri was one of his women in the past, her presence might be quite disturbing to his current fiancée. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that the case?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whatever the answer is, another encounter with Tae-jun did not seem like a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a profound sigh, Yuri stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was already dark outside. To send the agency and Roy the final installation report by the end of the day, she needed to retrieve her tablet from him. Most of her installation notes were copied in her laptop, but the pictures that she had taken earlier at Daejin Department Store were not updated yet and she needed them for the report. Most importantly, in order to find her memories back, she needed to meet Tae-jun, the man in her dreams and flashbacks.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I visit his office?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When she keyed in Seoin Group on the search engine, her phone next to the laptop rang. It was an unfamiliar number. However, Yuri could easily guess who the caller was. After taking a few deep breaths, she pushed the answer button.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“You answered late.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring his response, Yuri started talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I need my tablet back. It is important to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“You need to come and get it yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deridingly, Tae-jun answered in a low tone. Yuri tried her best not to react emotionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where should I come? To your office?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">–         </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hotel Seoin, Suite 3001.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait, hey!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruthlessly, Tae-jun cut off the line. Yuri did not even have a moment to be antagonized by his rude attitude. He did not need to provide anything but a hotel room number, because at that moment, Yuri found the room number somewhat </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">familiar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know this room number …</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pounding started inside her head. Stumbling, she massaged her forehead.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">⸙</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here I am, again.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting off the taxi, Yuri glared at the overwhelmingly lavish appearance of Hotel Seoin. This was her third visit. She had visited this hotel for the first time because Daejin Department Store had reserved a room in the hotel as her accommodation during her stay for installation work. The second time, she was unconsciously driven to come, after her visit to Jinseong City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time she had visited the hotel, she could understand what brought her here. Now, she knew why. Because the man, Tae-jun Seo, was here.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I remember this place somehow?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something was still engraved deep in Yuri’s mind – even after removing the death of her father, the ten days, and the death of Hye-yeon from her memories completely. After she’d collected better pieces of information about Tae-jun, she was able to make sense of the man who had the security camera footage from Hotel Seoin. Presumably, the man named ‘Jin-wook Jeong’ worked for Tae-jun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the question was … </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did he delve into Hye-yeon Jin’s death? Is her death related to Tae-jun?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss Han?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A familiar voice dragged Yuri out of her deep thoughts. The voice was from the cousin of the man she needed to confront. The man who possibly could have been her lover in the past. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What perfect timing!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, Jae-won. Are you off now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes! By the way, what brought you here today? Is it a coincidence? Or did you come to see me?” The man was cheerful yet cheeky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh no, I came to visit one of my acquaintances.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Well, unfortunately, I also have a plan that I cannot skip. I was worried that you came to visit me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won seemed disappointed, but he hid his disappointment well. As Yuri had realized it from the beginning, this man always made her feel at home. Anyone could see that he was well-educated, from a respected family with care and love.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are Tae-jun and Jae-won so different from each other even as cousins?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When Yuri reminded herself of the man who she needed to confront, her face clouded over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jae-won quickly changed the topic. “Is the installation finished?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, it was done today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, are you leaving Korea soon?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking a few seconds, Yuri answered.  “I think I am going to stay for a bit. I need to take care of some stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, that is great news to me!” Jae-won smiled. “You can take your time. I can wait for your call.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing forceful, but an insisting voice of Jae-won landed on Yuri’s ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After entering the elevator, she closed her eyes. Whenever she breathed, something suppressed her chest and left her feeling nauseated. Even when she walked through the lavish aisles, she felt queasy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of Suite 3001, she dropped her head and looked down at her shoes. Somehow, she felt like she had done this before. Here, in this place, at some point in time that she does not remember.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With shaking fingers, she rang the bell. Without the slightest noise, the heavy door opened.</span></p>
