            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 35</b></p>
<p><b>&lt;— Flashback Begins —&gt;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quiet room turned quieter, the anxious father and son were flabbergasted.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s he talking about?!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myung-je and Hye-seong exchanged a befuddled look, unable to understand what Tae-jun meant. They’d thought of a million things that this man could demand, but when he did open his mouth he threw them into utter confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did he just say that he would like to date Hye-yeon? Myung-je mumbled to himself, still trying to grasp for the last straws of sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As hard as the words were to digest, his curiosity got the better of him. He swallowed hard, took a deep breath, and carefully spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hye-yeon? Have you ever met Hye-yeon before?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They lived in a different world, moved in completely different circles, he wondered how their paths had crossed. He was more inclined to believe that the Hye-yeon in question was a namesake and someone else altogether.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. At H University Art Hall’s opening ceremony. She is such a talented lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the second jolt of the day. His eyes widened to their limits at the appreciation his no-good daughter was garnering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“… She is?” His tone didn’t veil his skepticism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a tilt of his head, Myung-je questioned Tae-jun again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean by dating her? You mean you would like to get married to her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tae-jun chuckled, his eyes looked at him in ridicule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can be so greedy, Mr. Jin. Let’s not skip steps. How audacious of you to want me to become your son-in-law? Do you really think you can handle it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embarrassed, Myung-je stared at the young man in front of him. This man was cold-hearted, he was destined to rule the near future. He was a rising star, while the Jins a falling star. And he didn’t spare them any courtesy in pinpointing the fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong could not hide his embarrassment as well. He’s flushed, at the same time angry at being humiliated as such. But what could he do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching the father and son’s discomfiture, Tae-jun was satisfied. He continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Jin, I know what you are well-known for. I’ve heard stories about you. They say you get everything for your business partners, no matter what they want. Money, drugs, girls…The problem is, I don’t need money. I obviously am more affluent than you. Drugs are not my thing, but I could be interested in girls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time Myung-je was quick to grasp where the other was pointing at. He simply looked at the man, knowing there was more to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking his time, Tae-jun slowly and calmly delivered his offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If your daughter were to come in the package, Seoin Group might be interested in Hotel Jinseong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before the father had reacted, the youth stood up in anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come in the package? Are you mad? Money isn’t everything, you jerk.” He didn’t care how powerful the other was, he couldn’t take it anymore.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of crazy freak is he?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong kicked his chair to vent his aggression for he could not strangle the man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sit!” A terse tone put a halt to his frenzy spree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father, we don’t need to listen to this a*s*ole.” He raised his voice, red with rage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was done with this man, it’s a question of his sister after all. She was not a commodity for trade!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One brusque glance and Myung-je had restrained his agitated son. Unlike his son, he knew not to wear his heart on his sleeve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just by the look in his eyes, Hye-seong could instantly discern his conniving father’s intention. Astonishingly, his father was weighing up the price of </span><b>his</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> daughter! What kind of a man was he?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was no secret that Hye-yeon was the thorn on his side, his despair. In his eyes, aside from her beauty, she had no redeeming qualities. She was a wastrel, squandering his hard-earned money bringing nothing but trouble in return. As if it wasn’t enough, in order to live up to his “expectations”, she also fooled around with any and all kinds of guys she could lay hands on. He’d gone all out to discipline her, to the point of threatening to cut her loose… and yet, she was far from it. So, now that his daughter was of some “use”, would he pass on the opportunity… And that too in such dire circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it was unacceptable to Hye-seong. No matter what, no father would sell his own daughter. Why even the vicious tiger wouldn’t devour its young ones!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father!” His voice was a mixture of wrath, indignation, and helplessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, the old man turned him a blatant blind eye and an air-tight deaf ear. He ground his teeth, glowered at his son and barked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I. Said. Sit. And. Shut. Up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that Myung-je ignored his son and his antics and turned to Tae-jun. He leveled his gaze, neither haughty nor humble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How much will you pay?” he asked, his tone as if he was trading an object.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong sank in despair, he knew there was no turning back now. His beast of a father was set to wolf down his offsprings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hint of a smile appeared on Tae-jun’s lips. All along, he had been quietly watching the goings-on between the duo. He wasn’t surprised by the outcome, had he not known how ‘ethical’ President Jin was, he wouldn’t be sitting here in the first place. His son was still living in Utopia it seems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll decide on it once I talk to Ms. Jin. Her decision is critical in this kind of agreement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t want to give this foxy old man the satisfaction of calling the shots. He wanted to keep the reins in his hands, lest he were played by the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me talk to her. I’ll take care of it,” Myung-je said hurriedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have four days, so we can complete the disposal procedure before receivership begins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is not happening!” Hye-seong gave Tae-jun a fierce scowl. He wasn’t going to let his father and this equally vicious man have their way!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You never know, Mr. Jin. Seems like your father has already made up his mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if he’d seen something funny, Tae-jun laughed sarcastically still looking at the fellow, and then turned on his heels and walked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong could not swallow his anger, but Myung-je hurriedly heaved himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go to the hotel. Hye-yeon is at the hotel, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen to me, son. This is our chance. She messes around with everyone anyway, and he is not some random dude. It’s actually better for her own sake to deal with him. Not only that, do you think In-bae Lee will let us be if we don’t pay him back by disposing of the hotel?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He tried to breathe some sense into his son, they were in no position to pick or choose now, that is if they wished to continue living.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s not the only one who’s got the length of our foot. We also have something on him. As long as we have the ledger, he can’t do anything to us.” His son countered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not about that. I have invested in him for so long. For twenty years, ever since he was a councilman, I have done all the dirty work like a dog! The next election will make him a governor, then he’s going to be the president. I am not going to stop now. Don’t you know what it took to get me here? Do you want us to lose everything?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong agonized. Myung-je’s voice reminded him of the young days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in college, a young Hye-seong, sick of Myung-je’s ambitions and avarice, left his home. But soon, reality slapped him hard and harsh. He realized, without his father’s name and wealth, he was nothing. He struggled to find part-time jobs, and when he did find after a long ordeal, what he could make every month was far less than what he used to spend on drinks on a night out. Life on budget brought Hye-seong, with his tail between his legs, back to Jinseong City in just one year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hye-seong lowered his head. Although he didn’t want his sister to be the sacrificial lamb, he knew the worth of power and money. Compared to living a life of destitution, his sister suffering a year in the hands of the monster was… acceptable.</span></p>
