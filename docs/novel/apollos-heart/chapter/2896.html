            <p><strong>Chapter 109</strong></p>
<p>Tae-jun stared at the screen, the scene rendering him speechless. Jin-wook watched with his mouth agape. Watching the screen intently, they concluded that Mr. Han knew— that the President sold his precious daughter.</p>
<p>What really transpired that day was not visible to the eye. Mr. Han knew exactly what happened to President Jin, when he came across with ‘something’ in the midst of finding his daughter. And Lee-in Bae himself participated in the murder.</p>
<p>Considering Lee-in Bae’s tight relationship with the President, one would wonder why he suddenly turned on his ally, and it may be because of something that the both of them are involved in, which is probably…</p>
<p>Tae-jun shook his head from his thoughts as he stood up from his seat. “I have to meet Hyeon-ah Kim.”</p>
<p><em>⸙</em></p>
<p>Looking up at the gray sky, Roy reckoned that the clouds look heavy in their wake, with raindrops falling soon after. Roy’s brows furrowed in annoyance, clearly displeased with the gloomy weather. On climates like this, his productivity lowers to a minimum, and his muscles seem to be aching everywhere because of his age.</p>
<p>The rainy weather also reminds him of a certain memory he hated. He turned his gaze away from the window to look at Yuri’s sleeping face instead, hoping to distract himself.</p>
<p>Looking at Yuri’s face, the memory still lingered as if it was right in front of him; even the sound and smell that came with it felt tangible. He grabbed the pen and paper that the nurse left at the bedside table and sat down. It was one of his effective habits, which helped him steer his mind away from unwanted thoughts. He started scribbling down onto the paper, the memory slowly disappearing as he was anchored back to reality.</p>
<p>He also enjoyed painting. Anything that required a paper canvas interested him greatly.</p>
<p>The door burst open. Roy looked up from the sudden intrusion, the scent of rain wafting inside. Roy frowned as the memory he tried so desperately to push out came surging back inside his head. Tae-jun and a man stood at the door.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have an umbrella?” Roy asked, eyeing the two men that were soaked in rainwater. Did he go out in the rain on purpose?</p>
<p>Ignoring Roy’s question, Tae-jun nodded his head towards Yuri. “She’s still sleeping?”</p>
<p>“It looks like she’s exhausted.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun’s expression darkened. “We need to talk.”</p>
<p>The words didn’t need to be said, since both men already had the same thought.</p>
<p>The hospital room where Yuri was confined was located on a floor that required special access. The floor itself only had one room, which catered mostly to private individuals like corporate presidents, politicians and superstars. The room also boasted a wide reception hall, dining and lounging areas where families, secretaries and bodyguards stayed.</p>
<p>“Do you smoke?” Tae-jun asked, seating down and taking a cigarette out of his front pocket.</p>
<p>Roy shook his head. “There are a lot of materials that are susceptible to burning inside the studio, so smoking is strictly prohibited, especially to the members.”</p>
<p>“Alright. I will smoke one, please give me a moment.” Tae-jun took off his jacket and placed it behind the sofa. When he put on a shirt, Roy noticed how muscular Tae-jun’s body was. It reminded him of a model’s body, in which artists pay for, in order to get sketches based on the models’ posed form.</p>
<p>Roy opened the door to the balcony, and stared at Tae-jun’s retreating form. He was reminded once again with the memory as the scent of rain filled his nostrils.</p>
<p><em>[I’m so tired of waiting.]</em></p>
<p>A whisper ghosted in his ear. Roy felt his hands trembling. He was in the same situation years ago. Did this man fight with Yuri? Or did he criticize her? Drive her away even?</p>
<p>It felt like Roy’s throat was being strangled as the memory seeped into his head. He tugged the collar of his shirt, trying to loosen it so as to breathe properly. His neck feels like it’s being constrained. He gripped the back of his neck with his left hand, his ring gleaming against his nape as he stretched his neck taut.</p>
<p>Tae-jun wasn’t able to meet Hyeon-ah Kim. There was no sign of her around the vicinity she was living in. Even the old manager who knew her personally from a nearby store had no idea where she went. Looking for her proved to be difficult, since she was a woman who had no family and close friends.</p>
<p>What did Yuri and Hyeon-ah Kim talk about? What clues was she referring to? According to Jin-wook, she must have been in that very scene that day, that’s why she’s able to tell her that story. How much does Yuri know? How much does she remember?</p>
<p>Still, the parts related to Hye-yeon Jin were still unresolved.</p>
<p>The cigarette Tae-jun was holding to become soaked, after Tae-jun left it exposed under the rain, his thoughts drifting someplace else. Deeming the stick worthless, Tae-jun threw it to the side and took a new one from his pocket.</p>
<p>Roy sat on the sofa. He was scratching, grasping at his throat as if he’s having allergy attacks. It looked like he’s trying to rip his throat off, his nails biting at the soft skin, forming reddish marks on his neck. He repeated his actions over and over again. Tae-jun approached him, sitting right by his side.</p>
