            <p><strong>Chapter 86</strong></p>
<p>“This is the list of people attending Senator Su-Kwang Lee’s publication ceremony today with General Manager Si-yeon Yoon.” Manager Lee got in the car with Tae-jun and handed him the list.</p>
<p>Tae-jun indifferently read through the list. Senator Lee was an old politician who was friends with his grandfather. He was now retired, but he used to be a man of significant authority to both parties, so the attendees to the ceremony were influential people.</p>
<p>Also, he recognized some of the names of popular candidates for the upcoming presidential election. One name that he particularly focused on was In-Bae Lee.</p>
<p>“In-Bae Lee is attending.”</p>
<p>“He’s an acquaintance of Su-Kwang Lee, and it is an appropriate ceremony for him to show up at.”</p>
<p>It was then that Manager Lee received a text message from Assistant Kim. He was notified that Si-yeon had already arrived at the boutique.</p>
<p>“General Manager Yoon has arrived first.”</p>
<p>The two had the same meetings to attend after their engagement ceremony. Tae-jun and Si-yeon’s stylist prepared matching outfits at Song’s boutique.</p>
<p>With his eyes fixed on the list in hand, Tae-jun said, “When we arrive, you can go home, Manager Lee.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Sir.”</p>
<p><em>Weird. Something was different. Everything seemed normal and today was a typical day. So why did something feel so off? </em>Manager Lee carefully turned to look at his boss.</p>
<p>He’d never seen Tae-jun in such a great mood after his vacation. It seemed logical though. After all, taking a break from work was a burden to the scion of the Seo Empire. While other heirs spent vacationing in exotic locations, this former athlete would be seen carrying his shotgun up the mountains. Once there, he would not come down for days or lock the shooting range. He would stay there all by himself.</p>
<p>Whenever he had something bothering him or an important decision to make, he acted that way, isolating himself from everyone and everything.</p>
<p><em>So why did he all of a sudden become a whole other person? </em>His face was not only flushing but also glowing. Even the female employees who were used to his handsomeness were blushing.</p>
<p>He was so positive today. What’s more, there was even a rumor … An employee who arrived early to finish up his task witnessed the stone-cold boss ‘smile’.</p>
<p>It was clear that he was in the best mood he could ever be in. But no one knew the source of this delightfully shocking change.</p>
<p>“You got something to say?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no sir.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun must have felt his stare. Manager Lee quickly turned to face forward lest the pleasantness turns to wrath. Contrary to how Tae-jun was being perceived, the man was deep in thoughts.</p>
<p>Director Seo was at the helm of Seo Group at the young age of twenty-eight. Unlike the men his age, he had never shown an extra ounce of emotion than was necessary. A man of few words, no matter the circumstances, failure, or success, remained perpetually aloof. Nothing, person or object, had ever lifted the corners of this facially paralyzed man’s lips.</p>
<p>But … today …</p>
<p>Tae-jun had never been in a better mood than he was today. And Manger Lee was certain that this miracle was courtesy the person on the other end of the line. His boss had spent the entirety of the lunch break glued to the phone. The man never took a dedicated lunch break as such. He would have lunch in his office wrapping pending work the whole time. Thus, when the boss stayed, naturally, the employees in the secretarial department would stay back too ordering takeout.</p>
<p>However, Tae-jun, who was in a superb mood today, happily lent his card to the employees. Needless to say, the people of this department were on cloud nine. They took their time enjoying the rare meal, all except Manager Lee who finished his meal quickly and returned to the office.</p>
<p>It was there that he heard Tae-jun talking over the phone with someone. The door that was usually shut tight, was ajar. Thanks to this, Manager Lee discovered that his cold boss could also speak in the most affectionate way.</p>
<p><em>Was it a woman? It won’t be his fiancée of course … Argh, what was he thinking?!</em></p>
<p><em>⸙ </em></p>
<p>When the car entered the parking lot, Manager Song of the Song Boutique was already waiting to greet him. She welcomed Tae-jun inside.</p>
<p>“Manager Yoon is already in the fitting room.”</p>
<p>“How many outfits did she choose?” he asked.</p>
<p>“She has chosen six.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun looked at his watch to calculate the time. “Might take about half an hour. I’ll get changed later.”</p>
<p>He didn’t like shopping. He hired a professional shopper to get all of his outfits for official meetings. Song, whom he had worked with for the past three years, was talented enough to please him every time. Today’s suit was also a match to his taste.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll notify you when it’s time.”</p>
<p>Tae-jun normally looked through papers or made business calls while Si-yeon got dressed. So, Song ordered an assistant to lead him to a private room.</p>
<p>“Actually, I want to look around.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Manager Song was genuinely surprised.</p>
