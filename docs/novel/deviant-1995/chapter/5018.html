            <p><strong>Chapter 47.2</strong></p>
<p>Miran’s eyes, following his movements, grew wide.</p>
<p>“…Why is it still… standing?”</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>Miran’s face, which had opened to answer reflexively, turned tomato red.</p>
<p>“I’m always in this state when I’m with you.”</p>
<p>Andre smiled mischievously with lazy, half-lidded eyes.</p>
<p>“Does that answer your question?”</p>
<p>Miran bit her lip and nodded.</p>
<p>He tore open another c()nd!0m wrapper scattered on the bed and quickly rolled it on.</p>
<p>“Why are you doing that again…?”</p>
<p>Miran pressed her legs together with a serious look. When Andre grabbed her ankle and pulled her, she squealed and struggled.</p>
<p>“What, what are you doing!”</p>
<p>“I’ll make you feel like a pervert again.”</p>
<p>Andre smiled wickedly, stretching his lips. Miran shook her head in alarm.</p>
<p>“What do you… I don’t want to be a pervert! Besides, is this even normal? Who has s$e~x twice in one night, and consecutively at that!”</p>
<p>When Miran whined with a tearful expression, Andre deeply furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>“Is there? I don’t think so…”</p>
<p>She trailed off while watching his reaction.</p>
<p>“Miran.”</p>
<p>She flinched. Was he angry?</p>
<p>“I never said we’d stop at twice.”</p>
<p>Miran’s mouth fell open. Andre kissed the inside of her knee as he lifted her leg, then flashed her a dazzling smile.</p>
<p>“This is just the beginning.”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>For three days Miran couldn’t leave the Dragon Valley Hotel’s corner suite.</p>
<p>The boundary between day and night disappeared.</p>
<p>They had s$e~x until she begged and cried for him to stop, saying she couldn’t feel anymore. When hungry, they ordered room service and eat. Once she regained some strength, they had s$e~x again until she was too exhausted to lift a finger, then pass out.</p>
<p>After such naps, she would wake to find Andre reading what looked like English documents while letting her rest on one of his shoulders.</p>
<p>Does this man not sleep at all.</p>
<p>Miran blinked her heavy eyes and asked.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you tired?”</p>
<p>Her voice was terribly hoarse from screaming in pleasure for three days straight. Andre shrugged indifferently without taking his eyes off the documents.</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>What an annoying answer.</p>
<p>When this usually quiet and stoic person acted like this, it seemed as if he had no interest in Miran at all. However, the moment he noticed she had woken up, Andre bent his arm and pulled her shoulder closer. After pressing her firmly against his side, he stroked her arm up and down with his large palm.</p>
<p>Affectionate yet indifferent.</p>
<p>It was paradoxical body language that left one confused. Among all the men she’d met, Andre was both the most stoic and the most tender.</p>
<p>Miran fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>Though she hadn’t meant to, over the past few days she had confessed her love quite a few times. When Andre would leaned in and planted tender kisses on her face as if he couldn’t help himself, her heart would boil over. In those moments, she would end up blurting out “I love you” before she could stop herself.</p>
<p>Whenever she confessed, Andre would only smile faintly and kiss her while holding her crushingly tight, never responding in kind. But Miran knew that his cold, indifferent green eyes grew warm and soft only when looking at her. This usually unsmiling man had been laughing frequently these past few days. Sometimes when he teased her, he would even laugh out loud.</p>
<p>This morning, despite her embarrassed protests, he insisted on carrying her to the bathroom, worried she might slip with her weakened legs. Then he stubbornly followed her into the narrow shower stall and washed every inch of her. Though it ended up exciting them both.</p>
<p>Pressing her flat against the shower stall wall, Andre thrust his hips with bestial force. Miran shuddered at the memory. The shower stall whined under the force of his thrusts. Though terrified the glass might break, Miran helplessly succumbed to the pleasure he gave her.</p>
<p>Just as when they entered, Andre carried her limp body out in his arms, dressed her in his shirt, and carefully dried her hair. While watching her doze off under the hot air of the hairdryer, her hair fluttering, he would gaze at her intently before giving her gentle kisses.</p>
<p>Her last memory was smiling at Andre with bleary eyes before consciousness faded to black as she fell asleep.</p>
<p>Sometimes actions spoke louder than words. If Andre didn’t love her, he couldn’t possibly be this tender.</p>
