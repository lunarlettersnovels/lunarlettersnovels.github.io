            <p><strong>Chapter 86.1</strong></p>
<p>Hand and hand, they stepped out of the elevator, practically jogging down the long hallway. At the end of the corridor, Andre opened the door, letting Miran in first then followed her inside.</p>
<p>As he closed the front door and turned around, Miran threw herself at him.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Caught off guard, Andre stumbled back, catching her in his arms. His broad back hit the door with a dull thud, and the keys in his hand fell to the marble floor with a clatter.</p>
<p>As he looked down in surprise, Miran, eyes clouded with desire, cupped his face and pressed her lips to his.</p>
<p>Andre blinked, caught off guard. Miran, standing on tiptoes, wobbled while kissing him. Snapping back to his senses, he angled his leg, lowered his stance and slipped his thigh between her legs.</p>
<p>His lips twitched as she eagerly kissed him. Her small tongue clumsily mimicked the way he usually teased and explored her mouth. Resisting the primal urge to devour her clumsy kisses, he savored her kisses.</p>
<p>He slowly stroked her back as if to encourage her that she was doing well. Then, a mischievous hand slipped under his shirt. Her slender fingers carefully traced his side, grazed his abs, and grew bolder with each stroke. She tried to grip the thick muscle of his pecs, but failed before she scraped her nails lightly across the firm muscle.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Andre started to panic. How far would he let this cute behavior go? As he pondered, her hand slid lower and a moment later, his belt unbuckled with a sharp click.</p>
<p>“Kang Miran.”</p>
<p>He warned, pulling his lips away. His voice came out more strained than expected.</p>
<p>Miran pretended she didn’t hear him. She unbuttoned his pants and tugged the zipper halfway down. Shocked by her boldness than usual, he grabbed her wrist.</p>
<p>Miran let out a discontented sound and waved her arm as if to shake him off.</p>
<p>“Let go!”</p>
<p>Worried about bruising her, he finally released her wrist. Then Miran promptly yanked his zipper all the way down.</p>
<p>This was the first time Miran had been this forward. His already hard #r3ct!0n throbbed, threatening to burst through his br!3.fs.</p>
<p>At this point, Andre was shaken.</p>
<p>‘Just do it here?’</p>
<p>He looked around and frowned. The entryway was all hard surfaces and sharp edges. Even what started as gentle s*x with him often turned intense by the time he came to his senses. So, if they did it here, Miran would definitely get bruises all over her body. Besides, a soft bed was just steps away.</p>
<p>Andre took a deep breath and placed his hands on Miran’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“Kang Miran, I’ll give you what you want, but let’s go to the bedroom.”</p>
<p>Miran stubbornly shook her head.</p>
<p>“I can’t wait.”</p>
<p>“Listen to me.”</p>
<p>Her chest heaved like she’d just run a sprint. Then, as if at a loss for what to do, she clutched the front of his shirt and pleaded.</p>
<p>“Andre, I feel a little weird right now. I want to touch you so bad. I want to… put you in my mouth, s<em>ck you… do p3r!v3r.t</em>d things. I think I’m going crazy.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Andre’s response came a beat late.</p>
<p>How could that innocent face say such things?</p>
<p>“Whew…”</p>
<p>He swept his hair back and sighed with strained patience. His heart pounded violently and feral desire surged within him.</p>
<p>Perhaps taking his silence as permission, Miran tugged his br!3.fs down. His thick, veined #r3ct!0n sprang free and rose upward.</p>
<p>Miran licked her lips with her pink tongue and knelt on the floor. The sound of her knees hitting the marble floor was quite loud. They’d definitely bruise by morning.</p>
<p>Andre realized what she was going to do and rubbed his face. She was mercilessly abusing his overstretched patience.</p>
<p>“… Get up, Kang Miran.”</p>
<p>Andre grabbed Miran’s forearm and pulled her up. Then she pulled her arm away with all her might.</p>
<p>“No! Don’t stop me!”</p>
<p>He lifted her chin, which she had stubbornly kept her mouth shut, and coaxed her.</p>
<p>“Miran-ah, you’ll get hurt—”</p>
<p>“I want to see you lose your mind because of me.”</p>
<p>Miran interrupted. She grabbed his p3.n*s, brought her face close and rubbed it against her cheek. Her large brown eyes were hazy like someone with a fever.</p>
<p>“Hah.”</p>
<p>Andre let out a hollow laugh, staring at her deceptively innocent yet erotic face. Tilting his head back, he glared at the ceiling.</p>
<p>‘More than this?’</p>
<p>Even without doing this, he was already going crazy. To the point where he felt like he couldn’t break free from his addiction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Miran gripped his #r3ct!0n and gently stroked it, looking up at him as if asking for permission. Its size grew steadily around her slender fingers.</p>
