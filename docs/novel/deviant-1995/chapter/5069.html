            <p><strong>Chapter 22.1</strong></p>
<p>Miran let out a gasp through her rounded lips, moistening her dry lips as if to focus on the sensation in her hand.</p>
<p>André smiled faintly. Just a moment ago, she had been trying to pull her wrist away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she seemed to remember the c0ndo!m she was holding and looked at it intently. Narrowing her eyes and tilting her head slightly, she appeared to be estimating the size as she gently curled her fingers around his p3n!s.</p>
<p>Even with the light pressure, his p3n!s visibly throbbed.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>A low, rumbling sound escaped from André’s throat.</p>
<p>“Oh my!”</p>
<p>Startled by the throbbing p3n!s beneath her palm, Miran quickly pulled her hand away. She clenched and unclenched her fist a few times, then glanced at André before turning slightly to the side.</p>
<p>She awkwardly inserted her index and middle fingers of both hands into the c0ndo!m’s opening and stretched it out to test its elasticity. Just as it seemed to stretch a bit, the c0ndo!m snapped with a ping and shot off like a rocket.</p>
<p>With Miran’s scream echoing in the background, the c0ndo!m slapped against the ceiling and stuck there.</p>
<p>André, who had been watching this farce with a cynical gaze, couldn’t hold back and burst into loud laughter. Meanwhile, the c0ndo!m, which had been stuck to the ceiling for a moment, drooped and fell right onto Miran’s head.</p>
<p>She shrieked and shook her head frantically. The c0ndo!m flew off and landed with a slap on the smooth linoleum floor in the corner. The laughter that had been dying down grew louder.</p>
<p>This was the second time tonight that he had laughed so heartily.</p>
<p>André pulled Miran, who was glaring at him resentfully, into his arms. As he rested his chin on the top of her head and his shoulders shook with laughter, Miran struggled and pushed against his chest. But André didn’t let her go. Honestly, he felt like he wanted to devour this amusing woman whole.</p>
<p>André’s laughter, which had continued for a while, gradually subsided as he felt her cautious hands exploring his chest. The palms that had been pushing him away moments ago were now creeping over his chest. She pressed lightly on his pectoral muscles with her fingers, gently stroked them, and gasped when something caught on her palm. Soon, she crossed her knees and rubbed her thighs together.</p>
<p>This woman was astonishingly incapable of hiding her thoughts and emotions. There was no need to search for hidden motives behind her innocent expression; her clumsy actions revealed everything.</p>
<p>He only had to read her like an open picture book, and that was quite convenient.</p>
<p>André allowed Miran to continue exploring his torso, swallowing nervously. The movements of her slender fingers made his molars tingle, and his pants felt like they were about to burst, but he could still endure it for now.</p>
<p>The problem was the c0ndo!m. He never had s3x without one. It was quite surprising that he hadn’t thought of it first. It seemed that he had been momentarily blinded by the pleasure in front of him, having not been with a woman for so long.</p>
<p>Normally, he would draw the line and walk away at this point. He couldn’t find a valid reason for still hesitating and playing with Miran’s hair.</p>
<p>He had never met a woman who attracted him enough to take such a risk. It was also unlike him to lose control of his desires and do something he would regret.</p>
<p>André looked down at the woman in his arms. Miran, her cheeks flushed red, was biting her lower lip and exploring his abs with innocent curiosity.</p>
<p>‘…D@mn.’</p>
<p>There were no exceptions. But he still didn’t want to stop. André let out a heavy sigh, his hand grasping a handful of her silky hair that flowed through his fingers.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>At that, Miran flinched as if she had forgotten his presence and looked up. When their eyes met, her brown eyes, clouded with awkward desire, darted away from his gaze. Her face turned crimson all the way to her ears, and she lowered her head deeply.</p>
<p>André released her hair from his grip and lifted her chin, murmuring softly.</p>
<p>[What am I gonna do with you.]</p>
<p>André, deeply contemplating what to do with Miran, let his gaze settle on her lips, which were plump and swollen from a kiss. They were beautiful lips that curved up brightly when she smiled—lips that made him want to fill them with something.</p>
