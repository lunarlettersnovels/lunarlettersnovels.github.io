            <h3>Chapter 29.1</h3>
<p>André peeled the wrapper off the lollipop sitting on the table and suddenly brought the round candy to her lips. Startled, her gaze dropped to his fingers. Gripping the stick, he tapped her lower lip with the red, hard candy.</p>
<p>“Open your mouth.”</p>
<p>Miran slowly parted her lips. André pressed the candy gently against her pink tongue. His half-lidded eyes carried a faint trace of a smile. The tangy sweetness of cherry spread across her tongue, and she swallowed as she took the lollipop into her mouth.</p>
<p>André, letting go of the stick, abruptly lifted the hem of her shirt.</p>
<p>“Mhmmp! W-wait a second!”</p>
<p>With the lollipop rolling to one side of her cheek, Miran shouted in a muffled voice, grabbing his wrist.</p>
<p>The hem had already risen to her collarbone, exposing her upper chest, which swelled above her pink bra. Under the unforgiving fluorescent light, the pale skin revealed faint blue veins scattered beneath the surface.</p>
<p>“Be careful of people who give you candy.”</p>
<p>André teased, his tone dry, as he finished pulling her shirt off. Miran, with the lollipop still sticking out of her mouth, hastily swept her messy hair back, her face flushing with embarrassment.</p>
<p>“…I’m not a child.”</p>
<p>“If you follow someone who gives you candy, or worse, let them into your house…”</p>
<p>With a mischievous smirk tugging at one corner of his mouth, he slid his hand up her skirt.</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>His large hand slid up her thigh, hooking a finger around her panties. Miran gulped audibly. As she tried to remove the lollipop from her mouth, André sternly warned her.</p>
<p>“Keep it in.”</p>
<p>He pulled her panties halfway down before she could do anything.</p>
<p>“I-I can’t…”</p>
<p>Miran weakly shook her head, holding onto his wrist, as the fabric caught on one hip and slipped down her opposite thigh. André responded by trailing soft kisses from her shoulder, gradually making his way up to her neck.</p>
<p>He softly brushed his lips between the sensitive spot on her neck and shoulder, gently teasing the skin until the fine hairs stood on end. As Miran hunched her shoulders and rounded her back in response, André took the opportunity to slip his other hand under her skirt, quickly yanking down the panties still caught at her hips.</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>Her faint resistance escaped in a soft sound as André moved his lips to her ear, his pointed tongue flicking against its outer edge. Overwhelmed by the sensation, Miran squirmed, pushing against his chest in a half-hearted struggle.</p>
<p>In the midst of this, André pulled her panties down past her thighs and over her knees. The delicate fabric slid down her slender calves before falling to the floor with a soft thud. Feeling awkward and embarrassed to be wearing only a skirt, Miran tugged the hem down with both hands.</p>
<p>André’s lips found her puffed cheek, pressing insistently against it as if trying to taste the lollipop there. His low, teasing laughter filled her ears, and he licked her cheek, making her momentarily forget herself. While she was distracted, the clasp of her bra came undone behind her back.</p>
<p>Miran could hardly think straight. The man who always seemed so serious, the one who had never acted frivolous before, was now playing with her cheek and laughing, sending an electric jolt through her heart. Meanwhile, behind her back, he was craftily unhooking her bra.</p>
<p>As the shoulder straps slipped down and her bra loosened, she let go of the skirt’s hem to hastily press the bra against her chest. Under the glaring fluorescent lights as bright as a hospital operating table, she was left with only a short miniskirt, her underwear stripped away.</p>
<p>Unable to meet André’s eyes, Miran dropped her head in embarrassment. She knew it was something she would have to do on set, but exposing herself like this, with someone watching, still felt embarassing.</p>
<p>André lifted her chin. Staring into her hesitant, wavering eyes, he gave a low, commanding order in a rough voice.</p>
<p>“Let go.”</p>
<p>Miran glanced up at him through trembling eyelashes. His face, usually cool and composed like a statue, now held an oddly primal edge.</p>
<p>Screwing her eyes shut, she released her grip on the bra and clutched the edge of the table instead. The pale pink bra brushed her knees as it slid down to the floor.</p>
<p>[Good girl.]</p>
<p>Like he was soothing a child, André gently stroked her chin with his thumb. Then, taking hold of both her knees, he spread them apart.</p>
