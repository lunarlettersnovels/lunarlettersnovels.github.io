            <p><strong>Chapter 51.2</strong></p>
<p>Andre, waist-deep in water, hesitated before turning around. The lamp light illuminated his profile. Dark shadows fell across one side of his bloodless, pale face. His blazing eyes, seeming to breathe fire, fixed on her. His expression showed both relief and fury simultaneously.</p>
<p>He waded upstream with splashing sounds. His fierce expression made him look like a demon. She could almost imagine steam rising from the parts of his body that were above water.</p>
<p>“Kang Miran. What do you think you’re—”</p>
<p>Andre, who had somehow gotten close, growled like a beast as he reached for her.</p>
<p>“Aak!”</p>
<p>Terrified, Miran screamed and desperately splashed water at him. It was a foolish act driven by defensive instinct. It didn’t take long to realize that.</p>
<p>“Huh!”</p>
<p>Except for the trickling of water, the surroundings were eerily quiet. Miran awkwardly straightened her upper body with a creak. Andre stood like a wooden totem pole, arms still outstretched, completely soaked from her sudden water attack. She flinched, her shoulders shaking.</p>
<p>Water trickled down his face, following his hair that was plastered to his forehead. His white polo shirt was thoroughly soaked, clinging to his muscular chest and revealing every contour.</p>
<p>The man, frozen like a statue, only blinked before raising the arm he had extended toward her to wipe his wet face. Water droplets caught in his eyelashes rolled down and merged with his lips. He wore a dumbfounded expression she had never seen before.</p>
<p>Though she knew she shouldn’t in this situation, the corners of Miran’s mouth quivered.</p>
<p>“Pfft!”</p>
<p>A snort-like laugh escaped.</p>
<p>“Hmmph!”</p>
<p>Miran covered her mouth in panic.</p>
<p>“Hah…..”</p>
<p>Andre tilted his chin up and let out a low sigh toward the sky.</p>
<p>Miran’s instincts sent her a fierce warning that she was in even greater danger than before. She rolled her eyes around, scanning her surroundings for an escape route.</p>
<p>Andre’s terrifying gaze flashed, and he took a step toward her. Miran screamed and turned to run. And then she slipped.</p>
<p>In that terrifying moment when the ice-cold water rushed into her mouth and nose as she plunged headfirst into the stream that had been lapping at her thighs, her body shot up from the water like a dolphin. Her legs emerged from the water and floated in the air. While her long hair clung to her face, blocking her vision, fingers dug into her sides as if they would break her ribs.</p>
<p>Miran coughed and sputtered, expelling the water that had entered her nose and airway. Then her body slowly descended, sinking back into the water.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, Miran brushed away the hair clinging to her face. After blinking several times, Andre’s chest came into view.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Andre asked as she coughed and rubbed her eyes. Miran’s eyes flew open, and she pushed his defenseless chest with all her might. With a splash, water sprayed in all directions. Perhaps due to his height, his head remained above water.</p>
<p>He shook his head like a wet dog. Apparently not expecting to be caught off guard twice, he gaped at her with blinking eyes.</p>
<p>Miran burst into laughter mixed with coughs. He closed his mouth and slowly raised his eyes. As Miran flinched and stepped backward, Andre rose up in one swift motion with a rushing sound like a waterfall and caught her. Once again, her feet left the ground. Miran twisted and struggled.</p>
<p>“Aah, let go!”</p>
<p>“Stay still.”</p>
<p>Despite being soaked in cold water, wherever their bodies touched felt hot from the heat radiating from Andre’s body. He carried her while walking slowly. Miran, afraid of falling, could only hang onto his neck without struggling.</p>
<p>“Put me down!”</p>
<p>“Right now?”</p>
<p>Andre showed his white teeth in a mischievous grin and loosened his arms as if to drop her in the water. Her bottom started sinking. Miran frantically clung to his neck.</p>
<p>“No, no! Not here, over there!”</p>
<p>She pointed toward the stream bank. But he ignored her and walked in the opposite direction of where she was pointing.</p>
<p>Miran desperately clung to Andre and pleaded.</p>
<p>“Andre, don’t drop me! Please!”</p>
<p>Just before reaching the deeper water, he stopped. Then he swung his arms like a swing, as if about to throw her into the dark water. Panic-stricken, Miran screamed shrilly while clinging desperately to his clothes.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry! Spare me! I won’t do it again!”</p>
