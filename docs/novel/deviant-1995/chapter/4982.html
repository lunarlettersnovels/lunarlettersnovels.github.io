            <p><strong>Chapter 65.2</strong></p>
<p>As Miran tucked the card into her backpack, which she’d take on the plane, Juran, with a worried expression, double-checked.</p>
<p>“Are you absolutely sure someone from the study abroad agency will be there to meet you at the New York airport?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I told you! How many times do I have to say it? Worrying too much is just bad luck.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear… Do you really think I wouldn’t worry about you flying off all alone to a faraway place? I haven’t been able to sleep lately because of you.”</p>
<p>“Unni, don’t worry. I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Miran casually replied as she packed, making Juran let out a deep sigh and roll her eyes at her.</p>
<p>“You need to behave yourself and just focus on studying English while you’re there! Just because you’re in America doesn’t mean you can act like those American girls, okay? Do you understand what I’m saying? The world is small, and I’ll hear all about who you’re hanging out with!”</p>
<p>As Juran tried to intimidate her, Miran playfully teased her back.</p>
<p>“Oh, of course! I’m always going to be as demure and proper as you, Unni, who was born at the tail end of the Joseon Dynasty. Ho ho ho! Oh my, I don’t know! Oh dear, why are you acting like this? You shouldn’t do that! Ouch! Why are you hitting me?”</p>
<p>Juran shot a glare at Miran, who was still giggling even after getting a solid smack on the back. But even she couldn’t help but let out a small laugh. Seeing the reaction she wanted, Miran clung to Juran’s arm and whined dramatically.</p>
<p>“Unni, my dearest Unni! I’m off to conquer English and come back victorious, trumpets blaring and all. So don’t you dare cheat on me while I’m gone—just sit tight and behave yourself, okay? Six months will fly by before you know it!”</p>
<p>She was laying it on thick on purpose. Juran’s eyes were starting to turn red, and Miran knew it.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Sunday, May 26, 1996</p>
<p>They say the day you’re waiting for always comes faster than you think. And sure enough, Miran’s departure day had arrived.</p>
<p>Jieun had driven all the way to Yongin before the sun was even up just to see her off.</p>
<p>“Whoa, Jieun! Your car is amazing!”</p>
<p>Juran gasped at the sleek new ride, and Jieun scratched her head, looking a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Hehe, thanks.”</p>
<p>“Wait, isn’t this that new sports car from the commercials? What was it called…?”</p>
<p>“Tiburon.”</p>
<p>After stuffing Miran’s giant three-tier suitcase into the trunk and cramming the rest of her bags into the backseat, Miran wedged herself into the tiny space that was left.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s go.”</p>
<p>At Juran’s cue, the bright red Tiburon let out a deep, throaty rumble before roaring off toward Gimpo Airport.</p>
<p>At Terminal 2, where all the national carriers flew out of, Miran pushed her luggage cart, trailing behind Jieun like a baby duck. Thanks to Jieun, they found the New York check-in counter in no time.</p>
<p>While Miran checked in her bags, Juran and Jieun stood behind her, chatting.</p>
<p>“Wow. I had no idea so many people were flying overseas.”</p>
<p>Jieun nodded. “Right? It’s kinda crazy.”</p>
<p>“When college students are on break, you can’t even tell if this place is an airport or a university festival. Ever since overseas travel got deregulated, I heard planes take off from Gimpo every minute during peak summer season.”</p>
<p>“That means they must be hiring a ton of flight attendants, right? Good news for our Miran.”</p>
<p>After struggling to check in her two suitcases, both packed right up to the weight limit, Miran grabbed her ticket and passport before turning back to the others. The three of them headed toward the departure gate.</p>
<p>“Jieun, if there’s anything Miran should know before getting on the plane, make sure to tell her now. It’s her first time flying, and she’s stuck on there for sixteen hours! I told her to put on these motion sickness patches just in case, but she won’t listen to me.”</p>
<p>Juran, clearly worried, shoved a pack of anti-nausea patches into Miran’s backpack while directing her frustration at Jieun.</p>
<p>“Unni, seriously? When have I ever gotten motion sick? I can handle those gross, smoke-filled express buses just fine, and I ride roller coasters without even screaming! This is so embarrassing.”</p>
<p>Miran grumbled, clearly mortified, while Jieun struggled to hold back her laughter.</p>
<p>“Just listen to your unni. If the plane hits turbulence, even people who never get sick sometimes do.”</p>
<p>“…Turbulence?”</p>
<p>Miran’s eyes widened in alarm. Juran, who had already gone pale, immediately dug into Miran’s backpack again, pulled out a patch, and slapped it right behind her ear. This time, Miran didn’t resist.</p>
<p>Just then, Jieun pulled something out of her bag and held it out to Miran.</p>
<p>“Here. Take this.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“An electronic dictionary. It’s light, so you can carry it around and use it whenever you need it.”</p>
<p>“Unni… seriously, thank you.”</p>
<p>Miran took the device and flipped it open. It was one of the things she’d wanted to buy before leaving but had given up on because it was too expensive.</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh! I didn’t even think of this. Jieun, thank you so much. Miran, you’re seriously lucky to have a friend like her.”</p>
<p>Juran beamed at Jieun, grateful beyond words.</p>
<p>Juran, overcome with emotion, patted Jieun’s back, and Jieun gave her a shy smile in return.</p>
<p>As they reached the entrance to the departure gate, Miran stretched her lips into an exaggerated pout at the two of them.</p>
<p>“I’m going in now.”</p>
