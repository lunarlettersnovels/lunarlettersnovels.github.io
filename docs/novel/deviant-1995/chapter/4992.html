            <p><strong>Chapter 60.2</strong></p>
<p>“Our Miran C has top marks in looks, personality, and physical fitness. Isn’t there something we can utilize those things for?”</p>
<p>“So I’ve been staying up at night thinking about it…”</p>
<p>“Thinking about it?”</p>
<p>Jieun asked with curious eyes. Miran smiled a little shyly and scratched her temple.</p>
<p>“What about… a flight attendant?”</p>
<p>She had received a flyer for a flight attendant academy a few days ago while walking down the street. Since then, airline advertisements kept catching her eye.</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>Jieun’s mouth dropped open in surprise. Then Miran laughed awkwardly.</p>
<p>“It’d be really difficult, right? They say there’s a lot of competition. I need to go to cram school and be good at English too.”</p>
<p>“No way! It suits you so well!”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I’m for it, totally for it! Our Miran C has a great personality, is tall, pretty, and has good stamina. If there’s one thing that bothers me—”</p>
<p>“English?”</p>
<p>As expected, Jieun frowned and nodded. She was one of the people who knew Miran’s English skills well. Miran sighed deeply.</p>
<p>“The TOEIC cut-off is 550 points, so if I study hard, I think I can somehow get by, but the problem is conversation.”</p>
<p>Miran’s shoulders drooped. Then Jieun also drooped her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Well, you need to speak English to be a flight attendant.”</p>
<p>“It must be nice for you, being good at English. When someone speaks to me in English, I can’t even understand the words I know. Will it even improve if I go to a cram school?”</p>
<p>“Academy? I don’t know. The best way to improve your English conversation skills in a short period of time is…”</p>
<p>Miran swallowed hard, waiting for Jieun’s answer with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s to go live in an English-speaking country. Only English comes out on TV, and even at school, the kids only speak English. When you’re dropped into that kind of environment, your English improves for survival. When I went to America, I only memorized one sentence: ‘Hello, my name is Jieun Ma. Nice to meet you.’ But after about three months, my ears opened up, and after six months, my mouth opened up.”</p>
<p>“Hoo… Is that possible in just six months?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Going on a language study abroad for six months is much better than going to a conversation academy for several years. Flight attendants have high salaries and receive allowances, so I think you’ll get your money’s worth from the language study abroad costs in less than a year.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“You know Jung Sunyoung, who was two classes above us? She became a flight attendant. I met her at a salon in Cheongdam-dong the other day, and she flies internationally to New York and Paris and shops at duty-free stores. She’s having a great time.”</p>
<p>“New York…? If I become a flight attendant, can I go to New York often?”</p>
<p>“I guess so? If you have any questions, call Sunyoung and ask her. By the way, if our Miran C becomes a flight attendant, will she go to New York to see Ahn’s husband and get some benefits?”</p>
<p>“I guess so? If you have any questions, call Sunyoung and ask her. By the way, if Miran C becomes a flight attendant, does that mean she’ll go to New York, meet Mr. An, and hit two birds with one stone?”</p>
<p>Jieun gave a lewd smile and fluttered her drowsy eyelids.</p>
<p>“Oh, stop it!”</p>
<p>Miran threw a piece of dried squid at Jieun and took a long gulp of her beer.</p>
<p>New York.</p>
<p>A word that made her heart flutter.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>“Why are you hesitating like this? It’s scary. Did you cause some kind of accident?”</p>
<p>Juran glared at Miran.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about! Why would I cause an accident! It’s not that…”</p>
<p>“If it’s not that, then what is it? Kang Miran, do you want to see your sister choke? Are you going to tell me quickly or not?”</p>
<p>Miran, who had been watching Juran’s reaction, bit her lip and blurted out.</p>
<p>“Can’t I… go on a language study abroad?”</p>
<p>Juran blinked her eyes as Miran said something completely unexpected.</p>
<p>“Not for long, just for six months.”</p>
<p>Juran pursed her lips and stared at Miran. A moment of silence passed. Miran lowered her head and opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, never mind—”</p>
<p>“Go.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Miran lifted her head abruptly. Then Juran said to Miran with a calm face.</p>
<p>“I said go. And here I was wondering what it was. You’re going to study English, why would I stop you? I’m about to push you on the back and send you off.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what I’m saying! When are you going? You said you were preparing to be a flight attendant, is that why?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. After hearing Jieun, she said that your ears open up in three months and your mouth opens up in six months. That would be a huge success for me.”</p>
<p>Juran nodded.</p>
<p>“So, when are you going?”</p>
