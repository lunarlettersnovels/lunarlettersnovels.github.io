            <h3>Chapter 40.2</h3>
<p>But this was Seoul. Therefore, the way to take responsibility for this situation ultimately boiled down to one thing.</p>
<p>Monetary compensation.</p>
<p>Having reached this conclusion, he felt somewhat relieved. However, monetary compensation had to be handled delicately, especially in a personal relationship like this. If Miran were to perceive the compensation as a quid pro quo for s€xu@l favors, it was clear that someone like her would be deeply hurt.</p>
<p>André was a bit surprised by the conclusion his stream of consciousness had reached. To think he was worrying this much about a woman he wouldn’t see again after a week.</p>
<p>‘I just don’t want to cause more harm to a woman who has already suffered because of me.’</p>
<p>So, he decided to take more time to think about how to compensate for the lost opportunity.</p>
<p>At this point, he had to admit it. His feelings for Miran, damn it, weren’t as light as he had wanted them to be. It was hard to predict what might have happened if he had met her a year, or even six months earlier.</p>
<p>‘But that doesn’t change anything.’</p>
<p>André lifted his head to gaze at the clear sky. It was early autumn in New York as well. The fall in New York, with its slightly bluer skies and drier air, was similar yet different from South Korea’s.</p>
<p>In exactly six days, he was scheduled to board a flight back to New York. The likelihood of him returning to South Korea in the near future was slim. Although there were plans for the Lafayette Hotel’s expansion into Asia, it was a medium to long-term project that would take at least ten years.</p>
<p>Although the chairman of the Lafayette-Lowell Group was his father, it was his mother who had effectively run the company. After her passing, many things went awry due to his father idling away in France. To set things right, André would undoubtedly be extremely busy for the next few years. New York was where he was needed to be.</p>
<p>‘We probably won’t meet again.’</p>
<p>In a week, there would be 6,800 miles between Upper East Side and Poidong separating him and Miran.</p>
<p>Seoul and New York. In reality, it was a distance that could easily be traversed if one set their mind to it. However, once he returned, there would be too much work to do. He didn’t have the time or mental space to leisurely fly back and forth for a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>Ironically, the more he thought about it, the less he wanted to let her go. If Miran agreed, he wanted to spend the remaining time with her. He knew it was a selfish desire.</p>
<p>Miran liked him. Her soft brown eyes that followed him, sparkled like fireflies that lit up the darkness. So, he couldn’t help but be aware of her feelings.</p>
<p>Unrequited feelings were inherently bothersome and burdensome. However, the pure affection Miran poured out like a child was so straightforward and unrefined that it somehow touched his heart. It was endearing in its own way.</p>
<p>Summer fling.</p>
<p>A relationship that burns hot during a summer vacation and ends when both parties return to their respective places. It was a common, nothing special.</p>
<p>So, if Miran wanted it, he thought he would act affectionately like a lover for the remaining time.</p>
<p>When time passed and he looked back on 1995, he would probably remember it as the first and last escapade of his life with a rather lovely woman.</p>
<p>He gave a wry smile. It was a romantic conclusion more fitting for his father, who had lived his entire life as a carefree, womanizing nobleman.</p>
<p>André humbly acknowledged that he had a particular weakness for Miran.</p>
<p>Reason, self-control, and patience all seemed to fail remarkably in front of her. Perhaps it was fortunate that they only had a week together. If they spent more time together, who knew what other impulsive actions he might take.</p>
<p>The bell of the suite rang. When he opened the door, a hotel staff member pushed in a cart and set several plates covered with silver domes on the dining table.</p>
<p>As soon as the staff left, he heard the bathroom door open. André approached the bedroom and leaned against the doorframe. Miran peeked her head out of the bathroom, looking around the room as if searching for something, and when she spotted him, she gave an awkward smile.</p>
<p>“Nice bathroom. Thank you for letting me use it.”</p>
<p>Miran, with wet hair and a bare face, carefully walked out of the bathroom wearing a white robe.</p>
<p>She was a woman who didn’t need heavy makeup.</p>
<p>Her eyebrows were perfectly shaped as if drawn, her fair skin was smooth like pudding, her cheeks were as luscious as peaches, and her lips were redder when nothing was applied. Yet, she behaved awkwardly, like a girl unaware of her own beauty.</p>
<p>Feeling his blatant gaze, Miran fidgeted and nervously clutched the waistband of her robe. André chuckled softly and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Come here.”</p>
