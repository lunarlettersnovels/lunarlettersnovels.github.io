            <p><strong>Chapter 48.2</strong></p>
<p>‘Who would act like this with someone they don’t like? He doesn’t say it, but I know he loves me.’</p>
<p>[Shut up, Hamilton.]</p>
<p>Andre wedged the chunky receiver between his shoulder and ear, frowning irritably as he responded curtly. He clicked his tongue, then trapped her in his embrace and began undoing the shirt buttons she had just fastened. After undoing half the buttons, he parted the shirt front. Her round shoulder and one br3!as!t were exposed.</p>
<p>Before she could pull the shirt closed in surprise, Andre grabbed her br3!as!t first. He gently stroked the sensitive, swollen peak that had been thoroughly kissed and sucked. Miran jumped with a shudder.</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>She covered her mouth to prevent a m0a!n from escaping. Though she struggled to break free from him, Andre held her waist firmly and wouldn’t let go.</p>
<p>[Gotta go. Too busy to talk to you. Yes. Tomorrow at 9AM, sharp. You’re dismissed now.]</p>
<p>With a bang, Andre put down the receiver without hesitation, removed her hand from her mouth, and lifted her chin. After scanning her face with eyes revealing obvious desire, he lowered his lips at an angle.</p>
<p>“Let’s go on a trip.”</p>
<p>Andre mumbled casually against her lips before pushing his tongue between them. Caught off guard by the sudden kiss, Miran shook her head and pushed against his shoulders. He reluctantly pulled his lips away.</p>
<p>“Why.”</p>
<p>As Andre tilted his head to the other side and moved in again, Miran barely managed to stop him by covering his lips with her hand.</p>
<p>“A trip so suddenly… Where to, and for how long?”</p>
<p>When she carefully removed her hand from his mouth, Andre shrugged and answered.</p>
<p>“I don’t really know where. I’m supposed to get the map tomorrow. We’ll leave tomorrow morning and return the next day.”</p>
<p>That meant Tuesday to Wednesday. An overnight trip.</p>
<p>As soon as she learned Andre would leave on Thursday morning’s flight, Miran had called the hotel coffee shop and canceled her part-time job, citing personal reasons. Perhaps because she had worked diligently without incident until now, they fortunately let it slide without much trouble.</p>
<p>Though sudden, there was no problem going on the trip. With Andre, she didn’t really care where they went. Miran wrapped her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>“Yes. Let’s go on a trip!”</p>
<p>Miran smiled brightly and pounced on his lips.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>When they first left the suite and walked to the hotel parking lot together with Andre, the outside air felt fresh after being indoors for days. Among the similar-sized passenger cars, there was one van parked that was about the size of a small shuttle bus.</p>
<p>As Andre and Miran approached, the driver’s side door of the van swung open and someone stepped out to face them. It was a man in U.S. military uniform.</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>Miran pointed at the familiar man.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the guy who was sitting across from you at Cactus in Itaewon?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Wait here for a moment.”</p>
<p>Andre spoke quietly in warning before striding forward. His sturdy frame completely blocked the blonde man from view.</p>
<p>But suddenly, the man poked his head over Andre’s shoulder and waved friendlily at Miran. She hesitated before awkwardly smiling and waving back. Andre roughly turned the man’s head back in place.</p>
<p>Watching from a few steps away, the blonde man seemed to be teasing Andre while giggling like a mischievous kid. Even though she couldn’t see his face, she could vividly imagine Andre’s cynical, sarcastic expression.</p>
<p>Though the atmosphere between them was completely opposite, their casual banter suggested they were quite close. However, Andre showed no intention of introducing the man to her.</p>
<p>‘No need to feel hurt. Even if he introduced us, we obviously couldn’t talk beyond greetings anyway, so this is probably for the best.’</p>
