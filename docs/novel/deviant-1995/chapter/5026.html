            <h3>Chapter 43.2</h3>
<p>André tossed his shirt to the floor and impatiently yanked open the tight nightstand drawer. He pulled out a small box, turned it upside down, and spilled its contents onto the bed. Square silver foil packets scattered across the sheets.</p>
<p>Realizing what it was, Miran’s face flushed. Until now, they had only given each other pleasure with their hands and lips. Was she finally going to have real sex with André?</p>
<p>Her heart pounded like thunder and sent waves of heat through her body.</p>
<p>Knowing how large he was, Miran felt scared, but she didn’t want to hold back any longer. She had been waiting for this moment for so long. With the little time they had left together, her urgent desire overcame her fear.</p>
<p>“André, hurry… hold me.”</p>
<p>Miran reached out her arms towards him. André, who had been unbuckling his pants and lowering the zipper, paused and muttered a curse under his breath as he climbed onto the bed. Straddling her with his knees, he gave a wry smile.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t wait, could you?”</p>
<p>It was unclear whether he was speaking to her or to himself.</p>
<p>André placed his hand beside her head, leaned down, and kissed her face all over. He used his other hand to untie the ribbon at her waist. As he spread open the front of her robe and ran the back of his hand up her side, he froze.</p>
<p>André lifted his lips from her temple and tilted his head slightly. His gaze traveled from her neck to her toes and back up, meeting her eyes. The golden light encircling his pupils seemed to push out the green hue in his eyes, shining like sunlight.</p>
<p>“You’ve been like this… all this time?”</p>
<p>Miran turned her head, avoiding his gaze. Beneath the wide-open robe, she was naked. After showering, she didn’t want to put on the damp underwear that her co-star Oh Kyung-soo had touched. The spare underwear she had brought was in her bag outside the bathroom, but she hadn’t had time to put it on before André caught her.</p>
<p>“Hoo…”</p>
<p>André sat up and covered his eyes with his hand, his Adam’s apple bobbing noticeably. Miran’s gaze traveled down from his prominent neck muscles, past his firm chest, and lower, to the outline of his p3n!s, bulging against his pants and extending to the left pocket.</p>
<p>Miran swallowed hard.</p>
<p>‘They say it hurts a lot the first time. What if it tears me when something that big goes in? Can it even fit inside me? It doesn’t seem like even half of it would fit.’</p>
<p>She glanced at the outline of his p3n!s and then touched her flat lower abdomen. Spreading her fingers wide, she roughly measured his length with her eyes and placed her hand on her stomach. Her fingertips reached her navel.</p>
<p>‘If it goes all the way in… it would reach up to here. My insides are filled with all sorts of organs, how can something like that fit in?’</p>
<p>Miran blinked rapidly and wetted her dry lips. Now, she was truly scared.</p>
<p>“Um… André?”</p>
<p>She looked up inadvertently and flinched, her shoulders trembling.</p>
<p>‘His gaze is scarier than usual!’</p>
<p>André’s expression as he stared at her was fierce. It reminded her of the look he had just before he kicked Director Jung Byungjin and knocked him out.</p>
<p>“W-why are you looking at me like that? It’s scary…”</p>
<p>Miran, on the verge of tears, tried to roll away as if to escape, but André grabbed her arm firmly.</p>
<p>“Where do you think you’re going?”</p>
<p>At the sound of his growl, like a wild animal, Miran shrank back and pleaded.</p>
<p>“Um, on second thought, I don’t think I can take all of that. A person has limits, you know. If you put something that big inside, it could cause serious problems. There are a lot of things inside me like my duodenum, appendix, kidneys, and so on.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“To fit something like that inside, we’d have to temporarily move those things somewhere else, and that’s not possible, right? No matter how I think about it, this doesn’t seem right. Can’t we just do what we’ve been doing?”</p>
<p>André, who had been glaring at Miran as she desperately tried to persuade him, let out a short sigh, feeling incredulous. With one hand on his hip, he clenched his jaw and looked up at the ceiling, then his shoulders shook.</p>
<p>Biting his lower lip, André rubbed his forehead with his hand. His lips stretched into a wide smile, revealing his even teeth, and then he burst into laughter.</p>
