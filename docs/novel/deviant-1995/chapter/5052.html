            <h3>Chapter 30.2</h3>
<p>Miran was so confused that she wanted to cry. But at the same time, a dull, aching heat throbbed between her legs, intensifying the turmoil. Her nose tingled, and tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Hngh… What are you even trying to—ah!”</p>
<p>Something soft and wet slid up the length of her inner thigh. Miran gasped in shock, her hands flying away from her face as her head snapped up. André’s face was buried between her legs. Her eyes widened in disbelief, about to pop out of her head.</p>
<p>“Are you… are you crazy? Why would you—what are you even—ahh!”</p>
<p>André pressed his tongue firmly against her moist core, teasing her as he moved it skillfully, making Miran’s hips buck violently in response. A shiver ran down her spine, and goosebumps prickled all over her body.</p>
<p>When he finally pulled away, he looked up at her with eyes full of intensity. A thin, sticky strand of saliva mixed with her fluids hung from the tip of his tongue.</p>
<p>Miran shook her head, covering herself with her hands. Her vision blurred with tears, which soon streamed down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“This is… this is weird. Please, stop… please…”</p>
<p>Her understanding of sex came from fragmented conversations at drinking parties. She’d heard about men who used their mouths on women in such intimate places, and that some women even enjoyed it.</p>
<p>She vaguely remembered someone mentioning it was a common scene in p0rn videos. But no one there had ever admitted to experiencing it firsthand.</p>
<p>The idea of someone putting their mouth there—it seemed like something only perverts would do. And now, it was happening to her.</p>
<p>A wave of emotions crashed over her all at once: guilt, like she was breaking a taboo; a strange, sinful curiosity; and a deep fear of exposing such a vulnerable part of herself. Miran shuddered, unsure of what to do, feeling utterly defenseless.</p>
<p>“We don’t have any c0ndoms today. So, I’m not going to put it in,” André said in a low, husky voice. His tone was gentle, almost soothing, as if trying to calm her. Miran froze. She hadn’t even considered that part.</p>
<p>He effortlessly pulled her hands away from where she was covering herself, intertwining his fingers with hers. As he did, he murmured softly, “If you really don’t want this, just tell me now.”</p>
<p>Their eyes met. André’s gaze was fierce and burning, but there was also a tenderness there, steady despite the intensity. Yet, when he pressed her intertwined hands against his lips, the touch was impossibly soft, as if he might melt her with it.</p>
<p>Which of these was the real him? Miran didn’t know what to think, feeling overwhelmed by the contradiction.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She was too embarrassed, too afraid to go through with it, but at the same time, the idea that he might stop now stirred something unsettling deep inside her. She couldn’t bring herself to speak, instead biting her lower lip, avoiding his gaze.</p>
<p>Watching her, André’s lips curled into a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Then hold on. It’s my first time doing this too, so don’t interfere.”</p>
<p>When Miran remained silent, still avoiding his gaze, he tugged lightly on their intertwined hands.</p>
<p>“Answer me.”</p>
<p>Glancing at him from the corner of her eye, Miran gave a barely perceptible nod. He didn’t release their clasped hands. It was as if she was clinging to him for dear life, unwilling to let go.</p>
<p>André lowered his gaze between her legs. Her intimate area, flushed a deep pink, glistened with her wetness, as delicate and vulnerable as the petals of a flower drenched in dew. Her skin looked so fragile, like a snowflake that might melt at the slightest touch. And yet, that fragility only made him want to touch, taste, and torment her more.</p>
<p>He gently stroked the entrance with his fingers. It was so soft and smooth that it sent a shiver through him.</p>
<p>“Mmngh!”</p>
<p>Miran bit down on her lower lip, her thighs trembling as her entrance tightened. The tension caused a surge of fluid to spill out from the small opening.</p>
<p>Unable to hold back any longer, André buried his lips against her core. He had never felt such a strong urge to do something like this before. His tongue swirled around the swollen nub, then he closed his lips over it and sucked. He could feel her entire body quiver in response, her high-pitched whimper echoing in his ears as her core spasmed beneath his lips.</p>
<p>André’s erection strained painfully against his pants, so hard it felt like it might tear through the fabric. He pressed his tongue firmly against her cl!t, while his middle finger slowly pushed its way into her entrance.</p>
<p>“Ah, it hurts!”</p>
