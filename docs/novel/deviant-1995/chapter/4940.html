            <p><strong>Chapter 86.2</strong></p>
<p>Andre’s breathing grew ragged. He swallowed hard and rubbed her soft lips with his thumb.</p>
<p>“Just use your lips.”</p>
<p>It was a very strained voice.</p>
<p>He held himself over her hand, but she pushed his hand away.</p>
<p>“I want to do it.”</p>
<p>Like she’d done in the attic, she rubbed her lips against the t!p, kissing it softly several times. If her goal was to drive him crazy, she’d already succeeded.</p>
<p>Her tongue flicked at the bead of fl.u!d at the t!p. Then she took a small breath, opened her mouth wide and slowly swallowed the gl@n!s. At the same time, her hands grabbed the sh@f.t and stroked it up and down.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>A stifled groan escaped his teeth.</p>
<p>Miran glanced up and watched Andre’s reaction. Her attempt in the attic had been interrupted by Juran, but she still remembered Andre’s words to only use her tongue and lips.</p>
<p>Thinking of it as a big lollipop, she teased the underside of the gl@n.s with her tongue. Then she took the t!p with her lips and s*c.k3d hard until her cheeks became hollow.</p>
<p>Andre clenched his jaw and tilted his head back. His neck muscles tensed, his chest rising and falling rapidly.</p>
<p>The red, engorged base of his p3.n*s throbbed beneath Miran’s palm. Veins stood out on his taut abs, his muscles across his body swelled, until he let out a ragged breath.</p>
<p>Andre’s rationality was on the verge of crumbling. Despite her clumsy technique, the urge to come surged too easily. He fought the temptation to shove it all the way into her throat. He could no longer trust his self-control.</p>
<p>Gathering the last of his patience, he placed his hand on her head and pushed her back slightly.</p>
<p>“Miran-ah, stop now—”</p>
<p>His voice scraped, hoarse.</p>
<p>Then, Miran glanced up at him, squeezed her eyes shut, and took him deeper.</p>
<p>“Heuk.”</p>
<p>Andre’s brows furrowed and his hips jerked. As the t!p of the sh@f.t slid down, she tightened her throat. At that moment, Andre pushed her away and pulled his lower body back.</p>
<p>“Ghh!”</p>
<p>Hot, white fl.u!d shot out and splattering on Miran’s face. She squeezed her eyes shut, and a thin stream of s3.m*n mixed with tears from the corners of her eyes ran down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Panting and breathing fiercely, Andre took off the knit sweater he was wearing. As she tried to open her eyes, he rasped.</p>
<p>“Keep them closed!”</p>
<p>Miran flinched and shut her eyes tightly. He wiped her face with the soft knit, then pulled her up to her feet. As she stumbled, he pressed her back against the door. Then suddenly, he slipped his hand under her skirt and yanked her p@n.t!3s down.</p>
<p>“You started this. So you’d better hold out till the end today.”</p>
<p>Andre kissed her and unbuttoned her dress. His kisses trailed from her ear to her neck as buttons came undone one by one.</p>
<p>He pushed up her br@, took her n!p.pL3 in his mouth, s*c.k!ng hard while undoing the last button. He knelt before her, spreading her thighs wide.</p>
<p>“Hold the handle.”</p>
<p>As soon as she grabbed the door handle, Andre lifted one of her legs over his shoulder. Her wet core was fully exposed in broad daylight. Too ar0*s3d to feel shame, she trembled without even thinking of covering it.</p>
<p>Andre didn’t give her any time to come to her senses. Burying his lips in her, he lapped at the sl!ck.n3ss pooling in her swollen f0l.ds. He spread his tongue wide and scooped her ju!c*s up.</p>
<p>“Ahngh!”</p>
<p>Gulp. He swallowed audibly. Only then did Miran feel ashamed, her abdomen tightened as she trembled with exhilarating pl3@.s#r3.</p>
<p>Her knees shook and buckled. Andre supported her soft but.t*cks with both hands and rolled his tongue over the small b#d in her f0l.ds. She let out a sobbing m0.@n and shuddered.</p>
<p>He slid two fingers inside her, stirring, and s*c.k3d her cl#t hard. Soon, her thighs quaked as she cl!m@x3d.</p>
<p>“Hnngh!”</p>
<p>Every time her !n.n3r w@l.ls spasmed, she bounced her hips, and rubbed her cl#t0r!s against his lips. The heated flesh clung to his fingers and squeezed them tightly.</p>
<p>Ar0*s3d to the core by her desperate movements, Andre bared his teeth in a feral grin.</p>
