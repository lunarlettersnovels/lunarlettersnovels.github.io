            <p><strong>Chapter 79.1</strong></p>
<p>Miran sniffled and wrapped her trembling arms around his neck.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t hurt.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you crying?”</p>
<p>When Andre pulled his hips back slightly, she let out a whimper and clung to him.</p>
<p>“Not yet, don’t pull out yet. Just stay like this for a bit.”</p>
<p>Miran looked up at him with red, teary eyes and gave a pitiful smile. Andre brushed the hair stuck to her round forehead with his fingers and gently wiped the tears pooling at the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>Miran sniffled and tightened her arms around his neck. He let himself be pulled down without resistance and softly kissed her temple, where her pulse throbbed.</p>
<p>Only then did Miran confess in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t crying because it hurt. I was crying because I was happy. The realization that I’m with you, Andre, hit me, and it felt… so overwhelming it scared me. Like my head was going to explode—”</p>
<p>Miran flinched and stiffened.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It feels like it’s getting bigger again…”</p>
<p>Miran looked up at Andre with disbelief, then groaned as she pushed against him.</p>
<p>“Move over a bit. I’m okay now. You can… pull it out.”</p>
<p>Andre lowered his eyes and fell into deep thought. He felt a bit embarrassed. Miran was pouring her heart out about their tender reunion, and here he was, getting h@r.d again just minutes after finishing. He felt a slight sense of self-reproach.</p>
<p>But still.</p>
<p>Since it’s already like this, is there really a need to pull out?</p>
<p>As Miran tried to wiggle her hips to slip away, Andre followed her movements and raised one corner of his mouth mischievously.</p>
<p>“It’s too late. It’s not coming out now.”</p>
<p>“Not coming out? That’s ridiculous—”</p>
<p>He started so slowly thr#$t his hips. Miran, startled, squirmed to break free.</p>
<p>“Ugh, w-wait, Andre. Andre!”</p>
<p>She desperately cried out his name.</p>
<p>“…Mmm.”</p>
<p>Andre nuzzled her nape with his lips and responded halfheartedly.</p>
<p>“Can’t we just rest for a bit? I’m still jet-lagged, and—”</p>
<p>“Aah, jet lag. Gotta fix that.”</p>
<p>At the sound of Miran’s trembling, fragile voice, Andre calmly lifted his upper body.</p>
<p>He let out a relieved sigh for a moment then neatly gathered her legs and turned them to the side. Even as he did, the interlocked center inside her throbbed vigorously and grew larger.</p>
<p>“…W-what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Andre lay down fully, positioning her on her side and pressing himself close to her back. He even lifted her head gently to rest it on his arm and kissed the top of her head.</p>
<p>“Now rest.”</p>
<p>“How is this resting—eugh!”</p>
<p>Andre slipped his leg between Miran’s thighs. As her legs parted, he pressed his hips so close that her soft b<em>tt0c!k.s flattened against his. His p#n!s pressed all the way into her !nn3r w@ll-s, and her flat stomach slightly b</em>lg3`d.</p>
<p>It was a scary sight no matter how many times she saw it.</p>
<p>“Hngh, what if it breaks through…”</p>
<p>Miran pressed her palm against her lower belly and tugged at the bedsheet to get away. Andre wrapped his arm around her struggling waist to hold her still, and whispered tenderly.</p>
<p>“Miran-ah. Let’s do it one more time.”</p>
<p>She froze, then glared at him with distrustful eyes and pressed for an answer.</p>
<p>“…Really? Just once?”</p>
<p>She needed confirmation. He said they should do it one more time, but she didn’t think he ever said they’d do it <em>only</em> once.</p>
<p>Andre sealed his lips tight.</p>
<p>“Promise me. Just once—mmph!”</p>
<p>He silenced her with a kiss. He was unwilling to make a promise he might not keep, even if it was just empty words.</p>
<p>As if determined to make up for the past eight months in one night, Andre kept digging into her tirelessly. Exhausted, Miran finally passed out around two in the morning.</p>
<p>Andre greedily pulled the sleeping Miran into his arms and, for the first time in months, fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Lafayette-Lowell Group Headquarters.</p>
<p>Just as the elevator doors were closing, they opened again, and a tall, sturdy man stepped inside. Employees who recognized him hurriedly greeted him, and he acknowledged them with a silent nod.</p>
<p>Andre de Lafayette, the vice chairman known for being more precise than a machine, arrived at work at 9:05 a.m. today. It was a first. Everyone knew Andre started work at exactly 8:00 a.m., an hour earlier than anyone else. Employees exchanged curious glances, holding their breath.</p>
<p>Some wondered if the tank-like man had finally broken down from overwork, but his complexion looked better than usual. Still, the air around him felt subtly different.</p>
