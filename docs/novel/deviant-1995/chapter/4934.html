            <p><strong>Chapter 89.2</strong></p>
<p>That night, Miran leaned against the headboard and elegantly opened <em>Norwegian Wood</em>. She planned to read until André came home.</p>
<p><em>Reading a book before bed? Juran unni would be shocked.</em></p>
<p>Miran giggled and began reading the first chapter. The next morning, at 7:30 a.m., she woke to the sound of her alarm. Her face felt stiff, and she felt puffy from oversleeping.</p>
<p><em>Norwegian Wood</em> sat neatly on the nightstand. The pillow beside her was slightly dented that indicated André must’ve come home late and left early.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember falling asleep…”</p>
<p>She reached out and opened the book. She remembered reading up to the second page of the first chapter.</p>
<p>Not only did she fail to wait for André, but she fell asleep after just two pages. It was pathetic.</p>
<p>Miran sighed and got out of bed.</p>
<p>“I’ll wait on the living room sofa tonight.”</p>
<p>That evening, after finishing her work, Miran sat on the sofa, blasting the TV with the sitcom <em>Friends</em>. She smiled proudly when she caught familiar phrases but that didn’t last long. She kept dozing off, startling awake several times, and forcing her heavy eyes open each time.</p>
<p>In the morning, she woke up in bed. André must’ve carried her from the sofa. At times like this, she resented herself for falling into such a deep sleep that she wouldn’t even notice if he carried her.</p>
<p>A rustling sound made her turn, finding another note:</p>
<p><em>Don’t wait up, just sleep in bed.</em></p>
<p>Miran huffed. ‘Let’s see who wins!’</p>
<p>But staying up late was impossible with her heavy sleep schedule. Going to bed early and waking early might actually increase her chances of seeing André.</p>
<p>She set an alarm for 5 a.m. and went to bed early.</p>
<p><em>Beep-beep-beep, beep-beep-beep.</em></p>
<p>Jolted awake by the alarm, she fumbled blindly for the space beside her with her eyes barely open. A faint warmth lingered, but André was gone. She turned off the alarm and flopped back down, rubbing her eyes with a pout.</p>
<p>“Ugh… I missed him again. What time does he come home and leave?”</p>
<p>“Why’re you up so early?”</p>
<p>Startled by the sudden voice, Miran shot upright.</p>
<p>“André!”</p>
<p>Already dressed neatly in a suit, he walked out of the dressing room. She reached out instinctively.</p>
<p>He chuckled, then approached the bed and leaned down. As she wrapped her arms around his shoulders, he hugged her tightly, almost suffocatingly.</p>
<p>“I missed you so, so much.”</p>
<p>Miran whispered in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>André buried his face in the crook of her neck and let out a low sigh.</p>
<p>“Don’t tempt me. I have to go now.”</p>
<p>Despite his cold words, he held her greedily as if he would never let her go.</p>
<p>“Let me see your face. I haven’t seen you in days and it feels like I’m forgetting what you look like.”</p>
<p>When Miran smiled and gently stroked his shoulder, André slowly lifted his head. Their eyes met.</p>
<p>She caressed his face.</p>
<p>“I think you’ve lost weight in just a few days. It’s upsetting. Are you eating properly?”</p>
<p>She cupped his face and kissed him softly. Then André grabbed her chin and pressed her cheeks. He playfully rubbed his lips against her puckered ones, then nuzzled her neck, tickling her gently.</p>
<p>Miran squealed and squirmed, then fell onto the bed. André gazed down at her with a faint smile and gently stroked her cheek with his thumb.</p>
<p>“I’ll be home early Friday night.”</p>
<p>She grabbed his hand and rubbed her cheek against his palm. She needed to tell him about Hyunjung’s birthday party in advance.</p>
<p>“Actually, I got invited to a friend’s birthday party Friday night. Sorry for telling you now. I haven’t been able to see you in a while… Do you remember the girl who was with me in front of the hotel in Washington, D.C.?”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember.”</p>
<p>André replied indifferently. He vividly recalled the two guys staring at her at the dorm, but the person beside her was just a blurry silhouette.</p>
<p>“Hyunjung is a friend I met through the same study abroad agency. We’re eating in Koreatown, then going to a bar and a club. What time can you get home? I’ll come back at the same time.”</p>
<p>It was Friday evening, and there was no guarantee of a time when work would be finished. It was more like cutting it off than finishing.</p>
<p>André straightened up with a light sigh. He adjusted his clothes and checked his wristwatch. It was time to go.</p>
<p>“Call me when you’re moving from dinner to the next place. I’ll pick you up after I’m done.”</p>
<p>André lightly kissed Miran on her lips, then left, leaving behind a chilling silhouette.</p>
<p>In the end, she couldn’t bring herself to say a word about the Flushing Video.</p>
