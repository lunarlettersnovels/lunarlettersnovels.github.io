            <p><strong>Chapter 82.1</strong></p>
<p>Miran, who had been perking up her ears, rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“I got the ‘I feel like…’ but what did you say after that? Say it again, slowly.”</p>
<p>When Miran asked with a sheepish smile. André replied with a straight face,</p>
<p>“I said I want to eat.”</p>
<p>“What? Oh! You’re ordering something you want to eat from me?”</p>
<p>“…Something like that.”</p>
<p>“Do it again, again! I need to practice this a lot.”</p>
<p>Miran tucked her hair behind her ear and cleared her throat, smiling brightly at André. The bright lights of the study poured down from the ceiling, making her lush brown hair framing her face glow and revealing the curves of her body underneath the crisp white shirt.</p>
<p>[What would you like to have, sir?]</p>
<p>[You.]</p>
<p>Miran’s smile froze, and silence fell over the study.</p>
<p>Just then, the computer’s main unit whirred and scratched, followed by the clacking sound of a floppy disk being read. Miran’s gaze flicked to the computer, and suddenly, her body tipped backward.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>She was startled and squeezed her eyes shut. But André’s hand cradled the back of her head and hit the desk first. When she opened her eyes, he lifted her shirt above her chest.</p>
<p>“Hey? What are you doing—André!”</p>
<p>He slowly smiled and pulled her p@n.t!3s down in one go. He spread her legs wide and folded them up. He pressed her thighs down and buried his face between her legs. It happened so fast she had no time to resist.</p>
<p>“Ngh, why all of a sudden—”</p>
<p>There were no warning signs, so it was impossible to know WHEN it had started.</p>
<p>Miran grabbed André’s hair and tried to push him away, but didn’t budge an inch, he only dug deeper with his sharp tongue.</p>
<p>She felt like prey surrendered to a fierce beast, her spine tingling and goosebumps rising.</p>
<p>“Hngh, where exactly… Ah-heuk!”</p>
<p>Soon, André stripped off her shirt and br@, leaving her n4.k*d on the desk amid the computer and stacks of documents. He bit, sucked, and licked every inch of her like he had been starved for days.</p>
<p>Then, with desire burning in his eyes, he stood, wiped his glistening lips with the back of his hand, and roughly unbuckled his belt.</p>
<p>Every time André’s lower body slammed into her, the sturdy desk creaked and shifted. The pile of documents fell halfway to the floor as his waist dug in without mercy.</p>
<p>As pleasure blurred her vision, the computer’s green screen flickered in her sight. It reminded her of André’s eyes. At that moment, Miran cried out and c.l!m@x3d.</p>
<p>Close to midnight, she was carried to the master bedroom, limp in his arms.</p>
<p>After that, Miran never asked André to be her conversation practice partner again.</p>
<p>Friday, 7:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Sean Rafkin, the manager of the newly established Technology Department, wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand as he flipped to the next slide. When he raised his arms, his armpits were soaked with sweat.</p>
<p>After giving a presentation for two hours under André de Lafayette’s piercing gaze, his throat was parched and his legs were numb.</p>
<p>The technology department reported directly to the vice president. It was a new department, and most executives didn’t understand its purpose, so the vice president temporarily oversaw it. The pay was good, but the frequent one-on-one meetings and overtime were killing Sean.</p>
<p>[Online businesses launched in ’95 are making waves. Amazon for books, Auction Web (the precursor to eBay) for auctions, Yahoo’s website directory, and search engines like AltaVista and Lycos are leading the way.]</p>
<p>Sean continued speaking. He glanced nervously at André who sat behind his desk with an impassive face, and was staring intently at the slides.</p>
<p>[This year, more companies are expected to jump into online business. Dell Computer recently launched a website for buying computers online. And Microsoft’s launch of Expedia, an online travel agency, is set to shake up the travel industry.]</p>
<p>[Expedia?]</p>
<p>André raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>[Yes. It’s a website where customers can directly book hotels, flights, rental cars, and travel packages without going through a travel agency.]</p>
<p>André drummed his fingers on the desk, deep in thought. Customers would be able to directly access the inventory list that had previously only been shared with travel agencies.</p>
<p>The potential impact of this new venture on the travel industry sent a chill down his spine. They needed to fast-track the integrated website for Lafayette Hotels’ online booking system.</p>
<p>The Lafayette-Lowell Group had wasted all of 1995 due to its owner’s absence, missing a critical window to leap into the future. To make up for lost time, they had to act now.</p>
<p>[By next Wednesday, submit a detailed report on Expedia. If needed, coordinate with the business planning team.]</p>
<p>[Yes, sir.]</p>
