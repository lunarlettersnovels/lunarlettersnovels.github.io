            <p><strong>Chapter 50.2</strong></p>
<p>It felt as if they were the only two people in the world. Even the train sounds crossing the mountainside across the valley were soothing.</p>
<p>“Ahh…”</p>
<p>Full stomach, beautiful scenery. It was a peaceful scene that naturally drew out a contented sigh. The world looked even more beautiful thanks to the man sitting beside her, gazing at the same view.</p>
<p>Miran finished the last fragrant sip of coffee in her cup and spoke.</p>
<p>“Andre?”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>“Dinner was wonderful. Thank you for bringing me here. The valley, the mountains, the sunset—they are all so beautiful.”</p>
<p>Andre stared at Miran with an unreadable gaze. Then he turned his eyes back toward the sunset hanging on the mountainside.</p>
<p>“You’re beautiful too.”</p>
<p>It was said in passing. Miran quickly turned to look at Andre’s profile. As always, his face was like a rigid marble sculpture, impossible to read his thoughts.</p>
<p>Just then, his prominent Adam’s apple bobbed noticeably. The warm light of the sunset tinged his face slightly red.</p>
<p>Thump-thump, Miran’s heartbeat echoed louder than the sound of the valley stream. With a flushed face, she followed his gaze to the sunset. The red sun slowly sank behind the mountains. The scene where the sun’s golden warmth mixed with the cool green of the mountains resembled Andre’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I want to come back here again someday.”</p>
<p>Andre glanced at her sideways and responded nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“Can you find it though?”</p>
<p>“…It would be difficult, but I’d love to bring my family here.”</p>
<p>“Family?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I want to bring my sisters, brothers-in-law, and all my nephews and nieces to show them this place.”</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Andre shrugged.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you the map.”</p>
<p>“Really? Thank you.”</p>
<p>Miran forced a smile. In truth, she wanted to come back with Andre more than with her family. But she couldn’t say that. The train sounds busily passing by filled the silence between them. As soon as the loud noise subsided, Miran asked a question she’d always been curious about.</p>
<p>“Do you have any siblings?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He answered readily.</p>
<p>“So you’re an only child. My parents passed away, but I have three older sisters. The eldest is Kang Juran, second is Kang Yeongran, third is Kang Geumran, and then me, Kang Miran. I’m the youngest, with quite an age gap from my sisters.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>He nodded. Miran felt that if she didn’t ask now, he wouldn’t answer, so she blurted out questions as they came to mind.</p>
<p>“Now that you’re discharged, what will you do when you return to New York?”</p>
<p>“…Family business.”</p>
<p>“I see. When my mom was alive, our family ran a small supermarket. I was too young to remember well, but they say my sisters took turns helping at the store when mom was sick. Will you be helping with your parents’ work?”</p>
<p>“Something like that.”</p>
<p>When he closed his mouth with a bitter smile, silence fell again. Biting her lip, Miran suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“Can I write you letters?”</p>
<p>Miran’s clasped knuckles turned white as she waited for Andre’s answer with a tense face. After staring at the flowing stream for a long while without answering, Andre shrugged one shoulder.</p>
<p>“If you want.”</p>
<p>Miran’s face brightened, having expected rejection.</p>
<p>“Then will you write down your address?”</p>
<p>“Later.”</p>
<p>There was no choice since they had neither paper nor pencil right now. Miran sought his reassurance again with anxious eyes.</p>
<p>“Then, don’t forget to write it down for me. Promise!”</p>
<p>Andre nodded briefly. Encouraged by his permission, she tried pushing a bit further.</p>
<p>“Then… the day after tomorrow, can I go to the airport with you? I want to see you off.”</p>
<p>This time, he shook his head firmly.</p>
<p>“Thanks, but no.”</p>
<p>Miran pouted, feeling hurt.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>We might never see each other again, isn’t that too harsh a rejection? I just want to see you for a few more hours, even if it’s just that.</p>
<p>“It’s a morning flight. I have to leave at dawn.”</p>
<p>“I can wake up at dawn too.”</p>
<p>“No, you won’t be able to.”</p>
<p>When Andre stated it so definitively, Miran got upset.</p>
<p>“I can wake up early too, you know!”</p>
<p>He gazed at her steadily before showing a faint smile.</p>
<p>“No. You won’t be able to wake up. Because you’ll be going to bed very late tomorrow.”</p>
