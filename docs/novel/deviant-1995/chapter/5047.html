            <h3>Chapter 33.1</h3>
<p>André’s green eyes flashed menacingly. Miran flinched and slightly loosened her grip on his p€nis, which she grasped over his briefs.</p>
<p>‘Maybe I squeezed too hard.’</p>
<p>Trying to soothe him, Miran gently stroked his erect p€nis up and down.</p>
<p>“Just get up for a moment.”</p>
<p>When André didn’t move and continued to hover over her, Miran urged him again.</p>
<p>“Just get up for a moment!”</p>
<p>“I can’t get up unless you let go.”</p>
<p>He muttered through gritted teeth, frowning.</p>
<p>“Oh! Right…”</p>
<p>Miran giggled softly and released her hand from his gr0!n. André then slowly stood up.</p>
<p>Kneeling on the bed, his menacing expression, overwhelming physique, and the outline of his p€nis straining against the limits of his briefs made Miran feel a bit intimidated. Avoiding his gaze, she slowly climbed off the bed.</p>
<p>André followed her with his eyes. Miran gently took his wrist and pulled him towards the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>“Sit here.”</p>
<p>His expression remained stern, but Miran didn’t miss the faint curiosity in his eyes. Sure enough, he allowed himself to be led by her hand and sat on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>Miran smiled inwardly. Although he was usually stoic and expressionless, there were rare moments when his true feelings were revealed through his eyes.</p>
<p>Sitting on the floor, she moved on her knees between his legs. André hesitated and narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do?”</p>
<p>His husky voice was rough, like sandpaper. Miran placed her hand on his thigh with the cautious touch of someone handling a wild animal. The thick thigh muscles, as solid as those of a soccer player, tensed like stone under her palm.</p>
<p>André looked down at her with a blank expression, remaining motionless. The only sign of his agitation was his increasingly rough breathing.</p>
<p>Miran took a deep breath and grasped the waistband of his briefs, pulling it down. His p€n!s sprang out, quivering, and almost stood upright in front of her. A clear liquid formed on its h€ad and dripped down.</p>
<p>It was a breathtaking sight, but as she continued to look, it became less intimidating.</p>
<p>Miran swallowed hard and licked her lips. André then grasped her chin and stroked her lips with his thumb, gently caressing the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>“Don’t do that. It might tear.”</p>
<p>“No, I can really open my mouth wide.”</p>
<p>Miran confidently spoke as she grasped the thick shaft with both hands. Despite her words, her hands were trembling.</p>
<p>André let out a short sigh and asked curtly.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to do it?”</p>
<p>“…Sort of?”</p>
<p>There was a brief silence.</p>
<p>“Who taught you?”</p>
<p>André asked in a casual tone, his expression blank and his eyes lowered to hide his gaze. His voice was oddly cold.</p>
<p>“From… a Sidney Sheldon novel.”</p>
<p>As soon as she said it out loud, Miran felt like she had made a foolish comment, and her words trailed off. André, however, relaxed his expression and chuckled, gently stroking her cheek with his finger.</p>
<p>“Then let’s try it.”</p>
<p>Miran nodded seriously and moved closer to him. Following what André had taught her, she grasped his p€n!s and slowly moved her hand up and down, gradually lowering her head.</p>
<p>Miran opened her mouth slightly, then closed it, glanced at André, and repeated the action. Lacking the courage, she gave a small, childlike kiss to the t.!p and looked up at him.</p>
<p>André let out a short breath, his jaw twitching.</p>
<p>Watching his reaction, Miran parted her lips a bit more and kissed the t.!p a few more times, making a soft smacking sound. She then pressed her lips against the gl@ns and slowly rubbed it. After a moment, she stuck out her tongue and lightly licked the und€rs!d€ of the gl@ns.</p>
<p>André involuntarily thrust his hips upward. The b@se of his p€n!s twitched, and the part above Miran’s hand swelled even more.</p>
<p>Letting out a sigh towards the ceiling, he lifted Miran’s chin.</p>
<p>“Open your mouth and stick out your tongue.”</p>
<p>She obediently followed his instructions. He then slowly rubbed two fingers against her pink tongue.</p>
<p>“Close your mouth.”</p>
<p>When Miran closed her mouth around his fingers, he began to move them in and out of her mouth repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Like this. Use only your tongue and lips. Don’t touch it with your teeth. Got it?”</p>
<p>To be honest, Miran wasn’t quite sure what she was supposed to do, but she nodded anyway. And, as a test, she lightly sucked on his finger.</p>
<p>Andre gritted his teeth as a soft, wet sound echoed when he pulled his finger out.</p>
