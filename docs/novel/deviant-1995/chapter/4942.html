            <p><strong>Chapter 85.2</strong></p>
<p>Miran clapped her hands in exaggerated delight.</p>
<p>“Oasis, Wonder… Aahh! Right, that’s it!”</p>
<p>She’d never heard the name or title before, but what mattered was that Andre seemed to be in a better mood.</p>
<p>Miran bit her lip and cautiously glanced at Andre before lightly placing her hand over his, which was gripping the gearshift. He flinched but didn’t pull away.</p>
<p>“The other day at school, we learned how to say ‘I love you’ in different languages. Hmm… What was the reason that came up again…?”</p>
<p>She gently caressed the back of his hand, which was clenched around the blunt gear as if he might crush it.</p>
<p>“Oh, I remember! A guy asked the teacher what he should say when he asks a girl he likes out on a date. The whole class got excited, throwing out ideas, and one person said to just confess his love outright.”</p>
<p>Miran giggled.</p>
<p>“We all laughed, but then the teacher said she had a great idea and had us take turns saying ‘I love you’ in our own languages. She said you never know what country the person you fall in love with might be from in New York. So instead of English, we studied ‘I love you’ in different languages that day.”</p>
<p>She studied Andre’s expression.</p>
<p>He drove with a blank face, but she instinctively felt that his mood had completely eased.</p>
<p>As soon as she lifted her hand away, Andre grabbed her wrist, placed her hand on the gearshift, and covered it with his own large hand. His fingers slid between hers. Miran sheepishly smiled and turned to Andre.</p>
<p>“English is ‘I love you,’ French is ‘Je t’aime,’ German is ‘Ich liebe dich,’ Chinese is ‘Wo ai ni,’ Japanese is ‘Aishiteru,’ Spanish is ‘Te quiero,’ Czech is ‘Miluji tě,’ Greek is ‘S’agapo.’ Oh! The teacher taught us Latin too, but what was it…”</p>
<p>Miran rolled her eyes, trying to recall the word, when Andre said in a low voice.</p>
<p>[Ego te amo.]</p>
<p>Her heart felt like it rolled out the car window.</p>
<p>“Uh… what did you say? Just one more time—”</p>
<p>[Ego te amo.]</p>
<p>Andre spoke slowly. His deep voice sent a thrill through her eardrums.</p>
<p>“Ego te amo… I don’t think I’ll ever forget it again.”</p>
<p>Miran’s voice was trembling.</p>
<p>He lifted her hand, kissing the back and then her fingers.</p>
<p>Miran swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“How much longer to New York?”</p>
<p>“… two and a half hours.”</p>
<p>Andre spoke against her fingers and she felt his slightly wet lips brushing her skin. She shivered and pressed her thighs together as goosebumps rose on her arms.</p>
<p>“Speed up… just a little.”</p>
<p>Andre gave her a puzzled look.</p>
<p>His softly tousled hair falling over his forehead, slightly parted lips, and <em>Ego te amo</em>.</p>
<p>Today, Andre was unbearably sexy. Was this what desire felt like for a woman? She wanted to hold him, kiss him, touch him.</p>
<p>This time, she pulled his hand to her lips and kissed his knuckles.</p>
<p>Andre let out a surprised breath. His green eyes flashed with a deeper intensity.</p>
<p>“Let’s go home quickly. I want to kiss you.”</p>
<p>Miran whispered.</p>
<p>The silver Diablo roared down the highway.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>In the parking garage, as soon as they stepped into the empty elevator, Andre pressed the button for the 33rd floor. The moment the doors closed, they pulled each other close, lips crashing together. Thankfully, this apartment building didn’t have an elevator operator like Ramon.</p>
<p>Andre cupped Miran’s face with both hands and pressed her against the wall. His broad frame completely covered her. His knee parted her legs and slipped between her thighs.</p>
<p>Miran, who had her hand on Andre’s chest, gripped his thin knit sweater. Their ragged breaths filled the elevator.</p>
<p>As he leaned down, hungrily exploring her mouth, the doors opened at the lobby. Miran was startled and tried to push him away, but he held her face tightly, refusing to let go of her lips.</p>
<p>In the end, no one else got on the elevator, and the doors slid shut.</p>
