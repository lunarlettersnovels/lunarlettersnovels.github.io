            <p><strong>Chapter 9.2</strong></p>
<p>“…Really? If I buy one, will you use it?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Just buy one and see. I’ll even send you that new-generation pager code, ‘Love you forever,’ every morning.”</p>
<p>“012486. And the new generation trend is already over. It’s Gen X now.”</p>
<p>Juran chuckled and opened the kimchi container, transferring the kimchi into a plastic container. The smell of well-fermented radish kimchi wafted through the air.</p>
<p>“New generation or Gen X, they’re all weird. If you buy me a pager, I’ll send you ‘012486’ as your wake-up call every morning.”</p>
<p>Miran nodded resolutely. The most expensive and stylish necklace-type pager recently released was 160,000 won (122 USD). The pay from her role in ‘A Gangster’s Love’ would be more than enough to buy it.</p>
<p>“…Alright. I’ll buy you the prettiest one, the kind you wear around your neck.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, is my little sister finally determined to take the civil service exam?”</p>
<p>Juran looked up excitedly. She had been persistently suggesting that Miran, even though she graduated from the Theater and Film Department, should consider taking the 7th-grade civil service exam instead of trying to become an actress.</p>
<p>“Public servants don’t earn much. I need to make a lot of money so you can quit your job quickly.”</p>
<p>“Look at you. When did I ever say I wanted to quit? People might misunderstand. Just focus on getting a job, please.”</p>
<p>Juran closed the kimchi container lid and glared at Miran.</p>
<p>“Why do you keep telling me to take the civil service exam when you paid my tuition for four years of Theater and Film? I might as well get a job at a regular company. Even students who were constantly on academic probation are getting hired by big companies.”</p>
<p>“Do you know how great it is to be a public servant? It’s a stable job with no risk of being fired, regular working hours, and you even get a pension after you retire. It’s a great job for women. I’m not even asking you to take the high-level exam, just the regular one. They say graduates from four-year universities easily pass it. Public servants also tend to marry well.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you get married first!”</p>
<p>“Oh, this again!”</p>
<p>As Miran teased, Juran flicked her forehead.</p>
<p>“Ouch! Don’t you know someone as dense as me has no chance in the exams? Are you going to wait a hundred years to see if I pass the 7th-grade exam? Don’t you remember that I’m not even good enough for college, so why did you send me to college when I can’t even study? Unni, you should have gone to college instead since you were always the top student.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you ungrateful brat. Do you think I didn’t want to go? I couldn’t, so I sent you instead.”</p>
<p>Juran had dreamed of becoming a teacher but couldn’t attend college due to family circumstances. She often said how envious she was of women who had gone to college, and she vowed to send her youngest sibling to a four-year university so they wouldn’t experience the same heartache.</p>
<p>“…I feel bad because it seems like I’m sucking the life out of you.”</p>
<p>Miran pouted and picked up a piece of radish kimchi from the plastic container, crunching on it.</p>
<p>“Do you know that? Looks like you’re finally maturing. But if you eat only kimchi at this hour, it’ll upset your stomach. Are you hungry? Should I get you some food?”</p>
<p>Miran hugged Juran tightly from behind as she rubbed her swollen wrists and muttered about getting some rice.</p>
<p>“Unni, I swear, I will succeed for your sake! Just wait a little longer, Kang Juran! I’ll make sure you live in luxury soon!”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. Thank you. But can you let go? You’re heavy. My back is going to break.”</p>
<p>Juran laughed silently and patted the back of Miran’s hand, which was clinging to her.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>When Miran confided in Jieun about what had happened at the filming site, Jieun became furious, as if it had happened to her. However, when Miran confessed that she was thinking of following Hyuna’s advice, Jieun, after a moment of contemplation, became her usual dependable ally.</p>
<p>“Hmm… if that’s the plan, you should go to Itaewon.”</p>
<p>“Itaewon? I’ve never been there before… Isn’t it a bit dangerous? There are a lot of foreigners―”</p>
<p>“Itaewon is probably the most open and free place in Korea right now.”</p>
