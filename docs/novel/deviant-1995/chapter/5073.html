            <p><strong>Chapter 20.1</strong></p>
<p>Miran, who had buried her face in André’s chest, couldn’t come to her senses. Her initial concerns about whether André, who was too much of a gentleman, could pull off the role had been rendered meaningless, as he had exceeded her expectations and shocked her with his performance.</p>
<p>As a result, Miran felt a real sense of fear, as if she were being toyed with and violated by a ruthless gangster like Park Doosik. It was ironic that this was the first time she had fully immersed herself in her role and become one with it since the start of the shoot.</p>
<p>It was difficult for her to be naked in front of André, but what was even more challenging was the strange feeling she got whenever he touched her.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like she was experiencing ar0usa!, nor was she feeling any sense of pleasure, but something was stirring inside her, making her panti3s wet. She tried to tense her lower abdomen and clench her thighs, but it was no use.</p>
<p>Summoning her limited knowledge of s3x, she recalled a conversation she had with her friends at a party, where they had giggled and shared stories about how women’s bodies responded to ar0usa!.</p>
<p>She had been skeptical about the claim that women’s bodies would become w3t and sl1ppery when excited, but now she was experiencing it firsthand.</p>
<p>The fact that she had become so ar0us3d that her panti3s were soaked, all because of André, was both unfamiliar and terrifying. Moreover, the sensation she felt when his hand touched her panti3s and rubbed against them was so intense that it was almost frightening.</p>
<p>The feeling of her lower abdomen vibrating like a drum was too sharp to be called pleasure. Her body was responding in ways she couldn’t control, and tears began to flow uncontrollably.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, when André laid her down on the table, not being able to see his face made her feel as if she were truly being violated by a stranger. This caused her to cry uncontrollably like a child, without any sense of shame.</p>
<p>The thought of having to film this scene in front of the director and the crew was terrifying and made her feel even more sorrowful.</p>
<p>However, as soon as the script practice ended, André was incredibly gentle, hugging and comforting her. Even Miran, who was usually quite insensitive to such things, could sense that André was also ar0used. The part of his body pressing against her stomach was unmistakably telling.</p>
<p>On the film set, when shooting a bed scene, both male and female actors would wear a “prosthetic” to prevent their g3n!tals from touching and to avoid exposure. And when it came to filming, there were so many people watching that it was rare for actors to get ar0us3d during a bed scene.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t unheard of, and such stories had become legendary in the drama and film department.</p>
<p>Moreover, André was someone who had never acted before. It was only natural that he would get ar0used, just like Miran had when she was touched by him.</p>
<p>Curiosity and caution pulled Miran in opposite directions. She wanted to experience that sensation again, but she was also afraid of its intensity and didn’t want to feel it again. Miran was aware of the hard, throbbing pillar pressing against her lower abdomen, and she trembled with anticipation.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The air in the small room grew hot. Sweat trickled down André’s spine inside his shirt. Despite his pride in his exceptional willpower and self-control, his rock-hard er3ct!on seemed ready to burst through his trousers, mocking him.</p>
<p>André’s own breathing sounded loud and rough to his ears. Tilting his chin up, he fixed his gaze on the ceiling. His eyes traced the tacky diamond-patterned floral wallpaper, eventually focusing on a small bubble where the wallpaper had lifted. Concentrating on that bubble, he slowly recited in his mind the information he would have to provide if he were captured and interrogated by the enemy.</p>
<p>“I am Captain André de Lafayette of the 8th Army Headquarters Battalion of the United States. My social security number is 212-95-0000. I was born on December 24, 196X, in the borough of Manhattan, New York City. I adhere to the United States Army’s code of conduct and will provide no information beyond what is required by international law for prisoners of war.”</p>
<p>The first statement ended, and the second one began immediately after. It was a painful effort to maintain his composure and not react to the woman crying in his arms.</p>
<p>However, Miran, who had been sniffling, started to tremble and rub her body against his. Her tightly pressed body was stimulating him in a strange way. The second statement was interrupted once, and then resumed with difficulty.</p>
