            <h3>Chapter 45.2</h3>
<p>His fingertips gingerly traced the top of her inner wall. Each time his fingers moved, the liquid flowing from her entrance pooled on his palm and trickled down to his wrist and elbow.</p>
<p>“Aah, wh-what are you doing? Ngh!”</p>
<p>Like a pearl embedded in a shell, he rolled the protruding peak under his thumb. He lowered his lips to her quivering chest, taking the sensitive tip into his mouth. With delicate yet persistent motions, his tongue teased her, alternating between soothing licks and soft bites.</p>
<p>Miran, stimulated in three places at once, shook uncontrollably as if electrocuted, overwhelmed by the dizzying sensations. Andre, sensing her reaction, sucked her peak hard, as if to swallow it whole. His fingers, still exploring, curled slightly as his thumb pressed against the sensitive spot. He moved his wrist rhythmically.</p>
<p>“Ahh, haaah!”</p>
<p>Miran, unable to control her trembling, bit her lip and covered her mouth with her hand. An animalistic sound rose from her throat and leaked between her fingers.</p>
<p>The heated, soft inner walls twitched erratically, clenching as if to push the invading foreign object away. The juices pooled inside spilled out like steady stream, soaking her thighs. Each movement of Andre’s fingers produced wet, squelching noises that filled the air.</p>
<p>As he pressed upward with his fingertips, meeting the sensitive spot near her pubic bone, Miran flailed, overcome by the unfamiliar yet electrifying sensation. Her vision blurred as her hands sought his shoulders, scratching sharply.</p>
<p>“I-I’m about to! Haaah!”</p>
<p>Her smooth waist arched sharply like a fish leaping out of water as she reached her peak. The movement of her spasming inner walls and her irregular pulse echoed through his fingers.</p>
<p>Andre pulled his lips from her breast with a ragged breath. Slowly, he withdrew his fingers from her still-clenching core. A trail of fluid stretched between his fingers and the sheets, leaving a translucent thread behind.</p>
<p>Patience and composure had long since evaporated. With urgent hands, Andre unzipped his pants, stripping off both his pants and briefs in one motion.</p>
<p>With a heavy thud, his pillar sprang free, the base twitching once or twice before defying gravity to press nearly straight up to his navel. Picking up one of the scattered condoms from the bed, he ripped open the packaging and quickly rolled it on.</p>
<p>It was something he’d bought on impulse two days ago while stopping by the hotel convenience store for water. Though he’d shoved the box into the bedside table drawer the moment he returned, pretending to forget about it, the truth was that it had never strayed far from his mind.</p>
<p>When Miran had stepped into the room, her innocent eyes lighting up in wonder at the size of the bed, the first thing he’d thought of was the condoms tucked away in the drawer. Whatever half-hearted guilt he might have felt was extinguished completely in the face of the brazen and consuming desire that flared within him.</p>
<p>Before Miran, still lost in the throes of cl!m@ax, could fully recover, Andre moved swiftly, spreading her legs wide and positioning himself between them.</p>
<p>Using the slickness of the fluid coating his hands as lubrication, he stroked himself a couple of times before sliding his hands beneath her knees and pressing her body into a folded position. Her hips, already raised from the pillow beneath her, lifted even higher.</p>
<p>“Ah, wh-what are you doing—?”</p>
<p>Andre leaned forward, pressing her down firmly as her legs draped over his shoulders. Miran, flustered by the compromising position, covered her eyes with her hands in a futile attempt to hide her embarrassment.</p>
<p>Of all the features on Miran’s expressive face, her large, candid eyes were the most telling. They gave away her emotions like a neon sign. Andre particularly liked her eyes; their warm, caramel-like hue gleamed with a clarity that perfectly matched his exact tastes. He could look into them all day and never get bored.</p>
<p>But now, she was hiding them.</p>
<p>Andre’s voice turned firm as he issued a command.</p>
<p>“Kang Miran. Hands down.”</p>
<p>Hearing him call her name, Miran shivered as though struck by a cold chill. Her cheeks flushed a deep red, the color creeping all the way to her ears. She hesitated before slowly lowering her arms, muttering something under her breath and turning her head to the side.</p>
<p>Andre caught her chin, gently guiding her face back to meet his gaze.</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear you.”</p>
<p>Miran lowered her gaze slightly and parted her lips as if she was about to speak. Andre waited patiently for her. Then, she swallowed dryly and opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“I tremble every time Andre… calls my name. I like it.”</p>
