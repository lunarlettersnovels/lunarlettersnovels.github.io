            <p><strong>Chapter 74.1</strong></p>
<p>Mary Sue was talkative. So, it wouldn’t take long for everyone in the household to find out who André was with and what he was doing here.</p>
<p>As an adult, no one could blame him for whatever he did in the room. However, since it was unprecedented, it was clear that it would be talked about for a long time.</p>
<p>Looking up at him with a sweet smile, he had only meant to give her a quick kiss before taking her home. He never expected the spark between them to flare so fast that he’d forget where he was—or what he was waiting for.</p>
<p>Miran, her cheeks flushed, fanned herself and popped a chocolate petit four from the two-tier dessert tray into her mouth, mumbling something under her breath. Her lips were just as red.</p>
<p>Just a moment ago, Miran cried, saying she missed him.</p>
<p>Seeing the unwavering emotions reflected in her transparent gaze, André felt as if the organs in his body, which had been misaligned and tangled, were finally finding their place. A strange sense of relief washed over him, followed by a warm surge of satisfaction that made his chest throb.</p>
<p>Then, the desires he had suppressed for so long burst forth like a wild horse.</p>
<p>He wanted to hold Miran again. It felt as if the blood beneath his skin was boiling and his hands twitched.</p>
<p>Was there really a need to hold back?</p>
<p>She was the woman who loved him.</p>
<p>In the end, André grabbed her wrist and swiftly pulled her onto his lap.</p>
<p>“Whoa!”</p>
<p>Startled, Miran pushed against his chest and struggled.</p>
<p>“No, what if someone else comes in!”</p>
<p>Ignoring her, André wrapped his arm around her. He lazily stretched his lips and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>“Your lips are a mess too.”</p>
<p>Startled, Miran covered her mouth with her palm.</p>
<p>André removed her hand and licked her lips. She blinked in surprise and opened her mouth. He then extended his tongue, thoroughly licking the soft mucous membrane inside her lips. It tasted sweet like chocolate.</p>
<p>“Ugh, what is—mmph, wait a second! I’m not a dog—kyah!”</p>
<p>André suddenly buried his face in the nape of her neck and rubbed his nose against her high bridge. It was the spot where she was most ticklish. Miran kicked her legs and pushed against his shoulders, laughing so hard she could barely breathe. He laughed softly, his shoulders trembling.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>He lifted his head and let out a satisfied sigh. It felt like he could finally breathe again.</p>
<p>It was like walking in a parched desert without seeing a drop of water, only to discover an oasis.</p>
<p>At that moment, André realized what he needed to do with Miran.</p>
<p>His small, beautiful oasis should be in New York, not Korea, and it should be very close to him.</p>
<p>Reaching that conclusion lightened his heart. It was rare for things in the world to go as one wished. Especially when it was a woman who had cried because she missed him. There was no way she would dislike being with him.</p>
<p>As André gazed into her eyes, the warmth in his gaze seemed to melt anyone who looked at him. When he leaned in closer, she gently closed her eyes. He too closed his eyes and softly kissed her.</p>
<p>A soft, wet sound echoed once, twice, three times.</p>
<p>The sensation of their soft lips touching and parting was sweet enough to send shivers down his spine.</p>
<p>With a small m0a,n, Miran wrapped her arms around his neck. He then began to place gentle kisses, starting from her forehead, moving down to her eyelids, the bridge of her nose, and the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>As the teasing kisses made her restless, Miran finally lifted her chin, exhaling impatiently as she sought his lips. André chuckled, his adam’s apple vibrating.</p>
<p>What began as a light kiss quickly deepened. It felt like no time had passed when a knock interrupted them once again.</p>
<p>[Mr. Lafayette. The car is ready, but…]</p>
<p>It was Higgins.</p>
<p>André lifted his head and replied in a rough voice.</p>
<p>[Five minutes.]</p>
<p>Miran, all disheveled and panting in André’s embrace, leaned her head against his shoulder, feeling weak and limp.</p>
<p>[Then, I will convey that to Enzo.]</p>
<p>André gently stroked the back of her head as he caught his breath. She looked up at him with anxious eyes and whispered.</p>
<p>“We… can meet again, right?”</p>
<p>André’s hand froze.</p>
<p>It seemed she had been worried about that while he was deciding to sit her down. They would be seeing each other every day from now on.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>At André’s confident reply, Miran let out a sigh of relief and smiled brightly up at him.</p>
<p>“Then, next time we meet, I’ll bring ten thousand dollars. I’ll make sure to keep it safe.”</p>
