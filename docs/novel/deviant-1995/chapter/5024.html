            <h3>Chapter 44.2</h3>
<p>“It might hurt a little. Are you okay with that?”</p>
<p>He gently stroked her cheek with his knuckles, as if he would stop at any moment if she said she wasn’t okay.</p>
<p>Though still a bit scared, Miran didn’t want him to stop. She looked up at him with anxious eyes.</p>
<p>“…How much will it hurt?”</p>
<p>André hesitated.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know either. If it hurts too much to bear, hit me. You can even bite me.”</p>
<p>Miran rolled her eyes gently and slowly wrapped her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>“I’m not some kind of animal.”</p>
<p>Reading her silent consent, he gave a small smile and lowered his lips to her ear.</p>
<p>“Now, focus on me.”</p>
<p>The low, husky voice, almost a whisper, resonated in her eardrum. The eerie feeling sent shivers down her spine, and the wet tongue tracing her earlobe and blowing warm breath into her ears made her breath catch.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>The lips that had traveled down her nape pressed a hot, burning kiss on her shoulder, as if branding her. André devoted himself to exploring every nook and cranny of Miran’s body, touching, licking, and sucking each cell that made up her being with an intensity that left no detail unattended.</p>
<p>Her entire body burned with unfulfilled desire. His lips teasingly circled around her n!ppl3s, leaving them untouched, which frustrated her. When his lips barely brushed past her n!ppl3, a groan escaped Miran’s throat.</p>
<p>“Hmm, why… why are you avoiding that spot…”</p>
<p>Miran raised her hand as if to press André’s head down but couldn’t bring herself to do it and pulled back. As she clawed at his shoulder in frustration, André, with a long, drawn-out smile, lifted his eyes slightly to meet her gaze.</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>Miran bit her lower lip and glared at André with eyes full of reproach. Even without being touched, her n!ppl€s stood €r€ct, sending tingling sensations down to her lower abdomen. André, with a mischievous glint in his eyes, asked nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“What do you want? Tell me.”</p>
<p>Miran’s face flushed a deep red as she huffed in frustration. She was on the verge of madness, while André seemed annoyingly composed, even playful. He shrugged his shoulders as if doing her a favor, barely suppressing a smile.</p>
<p>“If you can’t say it, you can show me with your actions.”</p>
<p>As soon as André finished speaking, Miran cupped his face in her hands. A hint of surprise flickered in his eyes, and his lips parted slightly. She pressed her thumb firmly against the center of his lips.</p>
<p>Such soft lips on such a rugged face. Miran marveled at the feel of his supple lips as she slowly traced his lower lip. His lips parted slightly, revealing the mucous membrane, then returned to their place under her touch.</p>
<p>Miran wetted her dry lips. At the same time, his Adam’s apple moved up and down in a long motion. André, who had been looking at her with eyes like a predator eyeing its prey, averted his gaze and hid his expression.</p>
<p>Miran tapped his lips with her fingers.</p>
<p>“Put your lips… here.”</p>
<p>Then she guided André’s face to her ch€st. As his breath touched her skin, her ch€st flushed with warmth, and a rosy blush spread across her face. His lips parted, and he suddenly bit down on the n!ppl€ hanging like a ripe fruit in the middle of her pale ch€st.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>As if he had never looked away, he sucked on the peak of her breast so hard that his cheeks hollowed, then rolled the €r€ct n!ppl€ with his tongue. A shiver of pleasure shot down to her lower abdomen. Although his lips were finally where she wanted them, the sudden rush of pleasure was almost unbearable. As she tensed her thighs and her lower abdomen twitched, a faint, 0rg@sm-like ple@sur3 subtly spread.</p>
<p>“Hnghh…”</p>
<p>Wherever his hands and lips touched, it felt like her skin was sizzling. As Miran twisted her waist, her gaping vulv@ released a gush of flu!d.</p>
<p>André moved his lips to her other breast and lowered his hand between her legs. As if checking something, he explored and then spread the parted sl!t wide with his fingers. He then unhesitatingly rubbed her sl!ck core.</p>
<p>The small nub that usually stayed hidden swelled with excitement, protruding noticeably. As André’s hand blatantly teased that sensitive spot, Miran shuddered and clung to his shoulder. In response, André covered her entire vulva with his palm and firmly pressed down on her cl!tor!s.</p>
<p>“Ah! That’s too…!”</p>
