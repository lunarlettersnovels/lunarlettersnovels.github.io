            <p><strong>Chapter 21.1</strong></p>
<p>A shiver ran down Miran’s spine.</p>
<p>“Ah, stop it, it tickles!”</p>
<p>André traced the edge of her ear with his tongue, then probed her ear canal.</p>
<p>Miran squeezed her eyes shut. Her lips parted involuntarily. The wet, squelching sound seemed to penetrate her soul, threatening to melt her. The unfamiliar and intense sensation, far beyond anything she had felt from a whisper, made her shudder.</p>
<p>She shook her head and covered her ear. It felt dangerous to experience such a sensation.</p>
<p>André lifted his head and, with a furrowed brow, commanded in a husky voice.</p>
<p>“Hands down.”</p>
<p>His tone, as if soothing a misbehaving child, carried an authoritative weight that was hard to resist. Feeling as though she would be scolded if she didn’t comply, Miran slowly removed her hands from her ear and shifted uncomfortably on André’s thigh.</p>
<p>The hard bul.g3 kept pressing against her bu!tocks, making her increasingly aware of what it was and feeling that she shouldn’t be sitting on it.</p>
<p>As Miran squirmed, trying to move away, André suddenly buried his forehead into her shoulder. He let out a growling sound, reminiscent of a wild beast threatening its prey.</p>
<p>Miran felt a mix of fear and excitement simultaneously.</p>
<p>‘Is it because of me?’</p>
<p>Her fine hair stood on end.</p>
<p>André slowly lifted his head, the gold in his eyes overpowering the deep green, flashing like pure gold. Miran’s heart fluttered excessively fast, like that of a frightened bird. Eventually, she lowered her gaze. It felt as if she would fall under a spell if she continued to look into André’s eyes.</p>
<p>Then André caressed her neck, gently rubbing the heated skin where her pulse throbbed with his lips.</p>
<p>‘Ah, this feels strange too. It tickles.’</p>
<p>Miran let out a rough breath and shrugged her shoulders. Wherever his lips touched, she felt a shiver run down her spine, and her body trembled with an unfamiliar sensation that rose up her back.</p>
<p>She had never imagined that a person’s lips and tongue could be so stimulating. She had also never known that areas like her palate, ears, and neck, which she had never paid attention to before, could be so sensitive.</p>
<p>André licked the hollow of her collarbone with his tongue. Although he was licking her collarbone, her thigh trembled. The unbearable sensations piled up, and then flowed towards one spot. Her pulse raced wildly between her legs.</p>
<p>André quickly undid the buttons of his shirt.</p>
<p>“Why are you taking off your clothes?”</p>
<p>“It’s hot.”</p>
<p>He shrugged off his shirt and flung it away. The shirt landed with a flop onto the checkered yellow linoleum. Miran’s mouth fell open involuntarily. André was large even with clothes on, but without them, the volume of his hidden muscles was overwhelming.</p>
<p>He had the kind of body that could easily fit the role of a special forces operative in a Hollywood action movie. His broad, square shoulders and thick, robust torso were impressive. Below his solid chest muscles, his abs were perfectly symmetrical, like rows of crops.</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>An exclamation of awe escaped her lips. While there were a few actors in the film industry known for their great physiques, this man was on a different level.</p>
<p>Seeing Miran unable to take her eyes off his body, André chuckled softly. Then, in an instant, he laid her down on the bed. As André moved over her, her vision darkened, and a long shadow was cast. It was only then that Miran fully grasped the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>‘Is he really going to do it?’</p>
<p>André had called it impromptu acting, but what they were doing now didn’t feel like acting at all. Park Doosik would never have taken the time and care to melt Chorong’s entire body with sweet and gentle caresses.</p>
<p>In truth, she was somewhat looking forward to it. She wanted to feel that sensation again, the one she experienced when André’s hand pressed between her legs, but this time more clearly. Earlier, everything had been so chaotic that she wasn’t even sure if it had really happened.</p>
<p>That electrifying tremor that made her lower abdomen tingle, climbed up her spine, and made the crown of her head prickle. Could she feel that again?</p>
<p>Looking up at André, Miran parted her lips and asked in a halting, broken voice.</p>
<p>“Is… is this… part of the script practice too?”</p>
<p>André paused at the sudden question. He gazed down at her with an unreadable expression. Just as she was about to give up on getting an answer, André finally spoke.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
