        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 52.2</strong></p>
<p>The moisture that had covered his skin like a thin film evaporated in the blazing heat, sending a rush of heat down his back. His skin broke out in goosebumps as Miran raised her nails and swept them down his shoulders to his waist.</p>
<p>Andre shuddered and gritted his teeth. He grabbed her mounds roughly and deeply sucked on the erect p34k as if to devour it. Miran trembled for a different reason than before.</p>
<p>“Nngh!”</p>
<p>As her body temperature shot up, hot, thick breaths escaped her mouth. M0@ans mixed with her shaking breaths, and between her legs, her w3tn3ss spilled and dripped onto the rock.</p>
<p>They dove into each other, wrapped in desperate heat as if this would be their last time.</p>
<p>Andre bared his teeth and nibbled her neck. His fingers, which had been stroking her w3t sp0t, suddenly entered her without warning.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>Her inner walls had softened considerably after days of nonstop thrusting. But she was still too tight to receive him. With a squelch, he pushed his fingers through the reluctant parting of her lining, rubbing against her swollen clit, and Miran tightened her thighs and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Haa, just, put it in!”</p>
<p>“No. You’ll get hurt.”</p>
<p>Breathing heavily against her ear, Andre withdrew his fingers and barely suppressed his instinct to thrust his p3n!s in to the base. Miran always struggled initially whenever she received him. So before entering, he had always taken time and effort to loosen her inner w4lls until they became slippery.</p>
<p>But as if mocking his efforts, she tightened around his fingers until they tingled, her body trembling slightly. His patience was stretching dangerously thin.</p>
<p>“Andre, please. Not your fingers…”</p>
<p>Miran reached out and clumsily grasped his thobbing erect p3n!s, rubbing it up and down. A tingling sensation shot through his skull. His barely maintained rationality crumbled helplessly against her rough and bold seduction. He had reached his limit.</p>
<p>Withdrawing his fingers from her inner w4lls, he gripped the base of his p3n!s and penetrated her in one thrust.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Miran couldn’t even make a sound. Like someone being choked, her mouth gaped as she pressed her head against Andre’s supporting hand. Her flailing hands grabbed his shoulders, digging in her nails.</p>
<p>Her thighs convulsed from both the pain of her tight w4lls stretching to their limit and the pleasure spreading from where his t!p ruthlessly scraped upward.</p>
<p>Andre breathed heavily through his teeth. Her w4lls clung to his p3n!s, contracting like waves. He wanted to force his entire body into that tight, hot space.</p>
<p>He reached down to touch where they were joined. The thin, smooth m3mbr4ne was stretched taut around his throbbing p3n!s. Instead of withdrawing his hips, he rubbed her cl!t with his thumb while pushing deeper. His t!p advanced steadily like like an organ until it brushed past the entrance of her c3rv!x and locked tightly in the narrow space above.</p>
<p>Only after pushing everything in from t!p to base did he stop. Her slim lower abdomen bulged up to near her navel, raised in the shape of his p3n!s.</p>
<p>Stunned by the overly vivid sensation of her flesh, he suddenly realized he had entered without protection. Sweat drops rolled down his sharp nose bridge.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Andre, this, this feels strange! Too deep… Take, take it out!”</p>
<p>Miran cried with frightened eyes as she pushed him away.</p>
<p>He needed to pull out quickly, but her hot, tight fl3sh gripped his p3n!s and wouldn’t let go. Every fold of her inner w4lls contracted like vibrations, clinging as if to suck his p3n!s. His balls drew up tight as an intensely powerful urge to cl!m4x shot up his spine.</p>
<p>“Ugh, you need to relax—”</p>
<p>Andre’s thighs and abs tensed like stone as he struck the rock with his fist.</p>
<p>While he held back his c0m3, Miran gasped with her mouth open like someone hyperventilating until her eyes gradually lost focus. Then she scratched his shoulders sharply as her waist arched.</p>
<p>“Ahh, haahh!”</p>
<p>It was the first time she had taken in his full length and girth. But even though he hadn’t moved at all, just staying still inside her, Miran’s throbbing lining, clenched and loosened around him, her limbs jerked as she came to a sudden cl!m@1x.</p>
<p>“Ahk, what did you—”</p>
