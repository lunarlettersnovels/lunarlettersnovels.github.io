            <h3>Chapter 33.2</h3>
<p>Miran grasped his p€n!s firmly with both hands and licked her lips with her tongue, lowering her head. Her soft, rounded lips enveloped the gl@ns, gently taking it in halfway.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was a loud knock on the front door.</p>
<p>“Makdung-ah, it’s your sister. Open the door.”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Startled, Miran’s lips slipped, and her front teeth grazed the gl@ns. Unintentionally, she tightened her grip on the p€n!s as if she might crush it.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>A groan of searing pain escaped from André’s throat. His jaw clenched, and the muscles in his neck bulged as he tilted his head back.</p>
<p>“Huh!”</p>
<p>Juran pounded on the front door as Miran quickly released his p€n!s and scrambled to her feet, panicking and not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>“Since when did you start locking the door? Miran, open up! Kang Miran!”</p>
<p>Fortunately, André locked the front door when he came into the rooftop room.</p>
<p>With a face pale as a sheet, Miran alternated her frantic gaze between the burly André, his still half-erect p€n!s, and the front door, pulling at her hair in distress.</p>
<p>“What should I do? Oh my God! What should I do!”</p>
<p>Biting her lip and looking around desperately, she shouted loudly when Juran knocked on the door again.</p>
<p>“Uh, unni! I’m in the bathroom! Just wait a bit!”</p>
<p>There was a brief silence.</p>
<p>“Are you pooping? Then I’ll sit on the bench and wait, so take your time and open the door when you’re done.”</p>
<p>“Uh? Uh, okay.”</p>
<p>Miran could hear Juran muttering to herself as she walked towards the bench.</p>
<p>“I should have made a copy of the front door key. Well, it’s only a few days left anyway. Forget it.”</p>
<p>Miran picked up André’s jacket from the chair and the clothes scattered on the floor, then pointed at his gr0!n and whispered urgently.</p>
<p>“It’s my unni! Quickly, kill that thing already!”</p>
<p>With wide eyes, Miran swept all the clothes under the blanket. Then she climbed onto the bed and quietly opened the window.</p>
<p>“Go out through here for a moment!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>André, who pulled his briefs back up, frowned as he looked between the half-open window and Miran.</p>
<p>‘Did I hear that right?’</p>
<p>André thought Miran was lying to buy him time to get dressed. Of all times, her family had to show up unannounced in this situation.</p>
<p>Though it was disappointing, he had no intention of sitting here and having a polite conversation with Miran’s sister. It was time to say goodbye and head back to the hotel.</p>
<p>‘Is she seriously asking me to hang out the window like some adulterer caught by a jealous husband? Is she out of her mind?’</p>
<p>As André let out a disbelieving chuckle, Miran frantically gestured for him to hurry.</p>
<p>“Quickly! If my sister sees me with a man, especially a foreign man, undressed, she’ll break my legs and shave my head! There’s space behind the window, so just wait there until she leaves!”</p>
<p>She pulled André’s arm with surprising strength. At that moment, Juran’s concerned voice came through.</p>
<p>“Makdung-ah, are you constipated again? You had such a hard time with that in your senior year. The smell after you used the bathroom, oh, the smell was just unbearable…”</p>
<p>“Unniii! Be quiet, please!”</p>
<p>With her face flushed red, Miran yelled at the top of her lungs while pulling André onto the bed. She pleaded with a face that looked like she was about to burst into tears.</p>
<p>“Please! Just do this to save me.”</p>
<p>André let out a long sigh as he looked down at Miran, then glanced out the window. As she had said, there was a narrow space behind the window, surrounded by a wall up to his thigh. In the corner, there was a jar stand, and a loosely hanging clothesline attached to a metal pole.</p>
<p>Practically pushed by Miran, André finally hopped out the window in just his briefs. She then grabbed a shirt from under the blanket and thrust it into his chest. As soon as he took the shirt, Miran put a finger to her lips and whispered “shh,” before slamming the window shut.</p>
