            <p><strong>Chapter 73.2</strong></p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>Standing on her tiptoes, Miran felt Andre’s thick arms wrapped around her waist pressing down as if to crush her spine. The kiss, which left no room to breathe, made her head spin. The familiar yet unfamiliar pleasure that scraped the roof of her mouth made her eardrums tingle. The heat that poured out like a bursting water balloon, swollen to its limit, drenched her entire body.</p>
<p>With her arms wrapped around Andre’s neck, Miran began to return the passionate kiss. Just as her lips softened slightly, he pushed her back.</p>
<p>Before long, something touched behind Miran’s knees. As they collapsed onto the sofa, their bodies intertwined without any gaps.</p>
<p>Only then did Andre pull away from her lips, hooking his fingers on his tie and tugging it roughly. In his green eyes, the golden rim surrounding his pupils burned like the sun.</p>
<p>As Andre opened his jacket and pulled one arm out, Miran reached out her hand toward him.</p>
<p>“I missed you, Andre.”</p>
<p>Miran confessed with a voice that cracked with emotion, smiling dazzlingly at him. Tears, glistening transparently above her bright and warm brown eyes, flowed down her temples.</p>
<p>With a grim expression, Andre swallowed his curses and, in the midst of taking off his jacket, pulled her into an embrace. He urgently pressed his lips against hers. The jacket, which had only been draped over one shoulder, slipped down to the floor.</p>
<p>The sensation of wrapping her arms around his sturdy shoulders, the heavy weight pressing down on her body, the soft hair winding around her fingers, and the green eyes that only warmed and softened when they looked at her. She had missed all of this so much.</p>
<p>As Andre’s lips moved to her ear, they traced the outline of her earlobe with his tongue while his hot fingers lifted the hem of her T-shirt.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Knock, knock.</p>
<p>At the sound of a cautious knock on the living room door, the two froze as if doused in cold water.</p>
<p>[Mr. Lafayette. May I come in?]</p>
<p>Andre slowly lifted his head. His eyes flickered. The last time he looked this flustered was when she had pushed him into the valley.</p>
<p>[Wha—um. What is it?]</p>
<p>Sitting up, Andre cleared his throat, his voice tight, and opened his mouth again. Miran also staggered to her feet, pulling down her T-shirt that had ridden up to reveal part of her belly and tidying her disheveled hair.</p>
<p>[Mr. Higgins said it would take about 15 minutes for Enzo to be ready, and he asked for tea and snacks to be served.]</p>
<p>Andre pressed his fingers to his temples. This was something he had instructed Higgins to do himself.</p>
<p>Suddenly standing up, Andre walked over to the single sofa across from him, slipping his arms into the long sleeves that hung behind him. He sat down on the sofa, crossed his legs, adjusted his jacket to cover his protruding pants, and tightened his tie again. After a short, deep breath to regain his composure, he commanded in his usual tone.</p>
<p>[Come in.]</p>
<p>Miran lowered her head, letting her hair fall long to cover her flushed face.</p>
<p>As the door opened, a middle-aged woman with a generous figure, wearing a light blue dress and a white apron, entered holding a silver tray. As the maid approached the coffee table, she glanced at Andre, her eyes widening in surprise. However, she quickly wiped the expression from her face, set the tray down on the table, and poured the tea with her head bowed.</p>
<p>Miran, glancing at Andre across from her, gasped in surprise. His lips were stained a deep red. When she waved her hand slightly toward Andre, he raised an eyebrow as if to ask what was wrong. Miran pointed to her lips with her finger. Then, she pretended to wipe her lips with her thumb.</p>
<p>Startled, Andre rolled his lips and slowly wiped them with his thumb.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the time for this. Miran couldn’t take her eyes off his lips. They were truly perfectly shaped lips. He could kiss well with those lips… and do other things well too.</p>
<p>Lost in thought as she gazed at him, Miran felt her face flush and squirmed, tightening her thighs.</p>
<p>Andre, checking the lipstick mark on his finger, let out a small chuckle.</p>
<p>At the sound, the maid, who was placing a teacup in front of him, flinched, causing some clear amber tea to spill slightly onto the saucer.</p>
<p>[Oh my, I’m so sorry!]</p>
<p>[It’s alright, Mary Sue. You can go now.]</p>
<p>Mary Sue, who had lightly bowed her head, quickly turned around and exited the living room.</p>
