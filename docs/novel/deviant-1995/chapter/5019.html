            <p><strong>Chapter 47.1</strong></p>
<p>It was such a long and intense climax that he worried his seed would leak out of the c()nd!0m.</p>
<p>He collapsed onto Miran, who swayed like a rag doll with his movements, and squeezed out every last drop while holding her. Their panting breaths mingled chaotically, and their heartbeats, pounding like horse hooves at a racetrack, vibrated against each other’s chest.</p>
<p>They lay entangled for a while, their breathing gradually subsiding. Andre supported Miran’s still trembling head while lightly gripping her pelvis as he withdrew his hips. The air felt cold against his member, which had been heated for so long inside her hot flesh.</p>
<p>“Haaah… hic.”</p>
<p>Miran exhaled with a cry.</p>
<p>Andre kissed her sweaty forehead, her wet eyes, and her swollen lips in succession. Then he paused. His unconscious actions suddenly felt strange to him. Even though the s#.x was over, he didn’t want to let go of Miran. It was truly bizarre.</p>
<p>Lost in thought, Andre narrowed his eyes while looking down at Miran, when she made a pained sound.</p>
<p>“Nngh….. I really thought I was going to die!</p>
<p>Her trembling hand struck Andre’s shoulder reproachfully before sliding down weakly. She glared at him with her sore eyes and pouted, then carefully gauged his reaction. Then she stretched both arms toward him. It was both amusing and childishly cute how she would hit him then beg to be held.</p>
<p>‘Cute. Not a thought I should have about a grown woman.’</p>
<p>Feeling confused, Andre held Miran as he flipped their positions.</p>
<p>“Eek!”</p>
<p>After placing Miran on top of him and holding her tight to prevent squirming, he blinked while staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>‘What’s wrong with me.’</p>
<p>He had expected that after their deed, his strange possessiveness toward Miran and the cognitive dissonance created by s3.xu~@l desires beyond normal bounds would fade. Usually, s3.xu@!l desire would naturally cool down once satisfied.</p>
<p>Yet after having s$e~x with Miran, he was acting even more unhinged than before. Andre shook his head vigorously as if trying to come to his senses.</p>
<p>“Hnng…..”</p>
<p>Miran, collapsed on his chest, made another dying sound.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>His tight voice was rough, like grains of sand.</p>
<p>Miran lifted her head slightly, supporting herself on his chest, and spoke as if she’d been waiting to.</p>
<p>“How can I be okay when it felt like a goblin’s club* came in and stirred everything up inside?”</p>
<p>*도깨비 방망이; lit. The Goblins’ Club – Korean folktale that tells the story of a good woodcutter who comes into possession of goblin’s club and becomes rich, and an evil woodcutter who acts greedily and ends up getting punished.</p>
<p>Andre, who had been listening quietly, raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>A goblin’s club? Surely it wasn’t that extreme?</p>
<p>“It hurt, it was scary, it was embarrassing. And though it really hurt so much at first, when Andre started moving… even though it still hurt, feeling that was even stranger. How should I say it, it’s like I became some kind of pervert.”</p>
<p>Andre chuckled at her honest and innocent reflection, stroking her head before grasping a handful of hair, enjoying the sensation as it flowed through his fingers. Everything felt good to touch. Her body perfectly satisfied his particular tastes.</p>
<p>All those rumors at the garrison about him being impotent or a closeted ga@y because he never went near women now seemed ridiculous, as the monster called s3.xu@!l desire went wild the moment it was unsealed.</p>
<p>Right now in Andre’s mind, er0!t1c and explicit fantasies were taking concrete form about how to seduce Miran again and in what ways he wanted to hold her.</p>
<p>“Ughh… By the way, I really did it now, didn’t I? I still can’t believe it. If Juran unni finds out, she’ll break my legs.”</p>
<p>Miran rambled incoherently, resting her cheek on Andre’s shoulder while swinging her legs. Her soft breath tickled his neck. Seeing her return to her usual chatty self, she seemed to be feeling better now.</p>
<p>“Um… How was it for you, Andre?”</p>
<p>While drawing meaningless scribbles on his chest with her fingertips, Miran hesitantly asked. When he continued stroking her hair without answering, she lifted her head slightly and asked again in an uncertain voice.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you answering? Was it… not good?”</p>
<p>Andre rolled over again, carefully placing Miran on the bed before sitting up. He removed the c()nd!0m, tied it, and tossed it into the wastebasket beside the bedside table.</p>
