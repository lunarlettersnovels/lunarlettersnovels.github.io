            <p><strong>Chapter 23.1</strong></p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Miran’s eyes flew open at the sensation of something touching her p4nt!es. André, his eyes half-lidded with heat, stared at her intently.</p>
<p>As she lifted her head slightly, she saw André’s long fingers moving slowly between her legs. He traced the prominent slit visible through her soaked p4nt!es with his fingertips. Though faint, the wet fabric made a slight squeaking sound.</p>
<p>“W-wait a moment…”</p>
<p>Twisting her hips to escape his grasp, Miran grabbed André’s forearm and shook her head. In response, he covered her entire vu!lva with his large hand and pressed down firmly.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Aah…”</p>
<p>Her head fell back onto the bed, and her back arched.</p>
<p>No one, not even she herself, had ever touched her in such an intimate way. A dull ache spread between her legs, and her thighs tensed up.</p>
<p>As he pressed down firmly with his palm, a strange sensation spread, making her legs tremble. Miran writhed, trapping André’s hand between her thighs. In response, he moved his wrist a bit faster, rubbing the front of her p4nt!es with his palm.</p>
<p>The tingling sensations she had felt during script practice now came in rapid succession. Each time, Miran shuddered and flailed like a fish out of water. Her eyes welled up, and her pupils dilated. Panting like a sprinter, she clung desperately to André’s forearm.</p>
<p>“Ah, it feels strange, ah, something’s—”</p>
<p>As André’s arm muscles moved rhythmically under her nails, a sharp pleasure, magnified tenfold, surged through her.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Miran momentarily lost her breath and scratched at André’s forearm. The intense sensation that swept between her legs quickly spread from the crown of her head to the tips of her toes. She couldn’t tell if it felt good or terrible.</p>
<p>As Miran instinctively tightened her lower abdomen with all her might, her stiffened thighs convulsed repeatedly. Her back arched, her chest heaved, and her entire body trembled. Experiencing her first climax, Miran writhed somewhere between pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>As the waves of ecstasy subsided, she felt a strange mix of liberation and exhaustion. Drained of energy, she collapsed onto the bed, her breath coming out in sob-like gasps.</p>
<p>André withdrew his hand from between her legs. His fingers and palm were slick and glistening with moisture.</p>
<p>“Hah.”</p>
<p>He looked down at his palm, exhaled roughly, and clenched and unclenched his fist.</p>
<p>Miran, her breath still heavy and erratic, looked up at André with a dazed expression. Her gaze wavered uneasily.</p>
<p>André’s eyes seemed different—cold and green, almost merciless, yet burning with a golden intensity. They reminded her of a predator she had once seen on TV, a black beast in the jungle, and it sent a chill down her spine.</p>
<p>André slowly rose and pulled down the front of his briefs. Miran froze, her body stiffening. Before she could react, something large and heavy sprang forth with force. Her face turned pale at the sight.</p>
<p>André looked down at her with eyes like a predator stalking its prey, running his hand, slick with her fl.u!ds, along the shaft of his p3n!s. His jaw, tense with restraint, twitched.</p>
<p>Miran, in a panic, bent her knees and pushed against the bed with her feet, flailing her hands.</p>
<p>“No, we can’t! It’s too big!”</p>
<p>When André didn’t respond, she cried out urgently.</p>
<p>“C0!ndom! We can’t do it without a c0@ndom!”</p>
<p>“We’re not doing that.”</p>
<p>André interrupted her with a growling voice as he pulled her by the ankle. She slid down the bed, struggling.</p>
<p>“If we’re not doing it, then why did you take that out? If you put something that monstrous in me, I might die…”</p>
<p>Miran’s lips trembled, and large tears fell from her eyes. Her expression, genuinely terrified as if she had seen something horrific, left André unsure whether to laugh or be angry. He scoffed and replied nonchalantly,</p>
<p>“I’m not going to put it in.”</p>
<p>Miran rubbed her eyes and sniffled, looking up at him with a doubtful gaze.</p>
<p>“Really? Then, can you put that back?”</p>
<p>“Close your legs.”</p>
<p>“But you said you wouldn’t put it in!”</p>
<p>“I’m not. Just close your legs.”</p>
<p>When André spoke in a cold, firm voice, emphasizing each word, Miran felt her resolve weaken and her body go limp.</p>
