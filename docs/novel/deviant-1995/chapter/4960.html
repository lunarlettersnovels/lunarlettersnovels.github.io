            <p><strong>Chapter 76.2</strong></p>
<p>André was savoring every moment to the point that he felt his spine tingle. His p#n.!s, engorged with blood and straining against his pants, was throbbing painfully, but the thought that he could hold her whenever he desired made even the torment of patience a pleasure he relished.</p>
<p>Miran’s pure white na.k3d body reflected in the mirror contrasted sharply to his dark navy suit. His thirst surged.</p>
<p>He was tempted to unzip his pants, take out his p#n.!s, bend Miran over the sink, and thrust into her like a beast. But if he did, she might return to that d!9mned dormitory again.</p>
<p>As he grasped the lapels of his jacket to start removing his suit, Miran’s eyes sparkled, and she grabbed his sleeve.</p>
<p>“Me! I want to take off André’s clothes.”</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, then released the collar and lowered his arms. It was a silent consent.</p>
<p>Miran took a deep breath, trying to forget that she was the only one n@.k#d. The thought of undressing André sent her heart trembling, buzzing like a pager.</p>
<p>As André watched her with half-lowered eyes, Miran summoned her courage and approached him. He seemed to think that lowering his gaze would hide the intensity in his eyes, but from below, she could clearly see that he was ready to devour her whole.</p>
<p>That made it all the more thrilling.</p>
<p>She boldly flung open his jacket, but it caught on his thick shoulder muscles and wouldn’t come off easily. He let out a silent chuckle and shrugged his shoulders to help her remove it.</p>
<p>Miran gazed at André from head to toe, her eyes appreciating him like a work of art.</p>
<p>His crisp white shirt with French cuffs fit him perfectly as if it was tailored to his body, and the dark silk tie looked luxurious.</p>
<p>André slipped his hands into his trouser pockets and straightened his broad shoulders. His natural elegance, unwavering confidence, and a calm composure. He looked like someone who had never bowed his head to anyone.</p>
<p>“André de… Lafayette.”</p>
<p>As she called his name, he lifted the corner of his lips with an amused look and gazed down at Miran. She reached out and wrapped her fingers around his tie, then hesitantly tugged on it while cautiously gauging his reaction.</p>
<p>In response, world-class André de Lafayette, with eyes burning with desire, lowered his shoulders and slowly leaned down without resistance.</p>
<p>Her heart raced.</p>
<p>It felt like she was holding the leash of a wild beast, and a shiver ran down her spine.</p>
<p>“Ah, this is so thrilling.”</p>
<p>She murmured, pressing a deep kiss against André’s lips before releasing his tie.</p>
<p>André slowly straightened his upper body, watching her with a languid smile that contrasted with the sharpness in his eyes.</p>
<p>Miran’s breath quickened. She slipped her fingers into the knot of his tie and tugged. The long tie slithered down his broad shoulders and chest like a snake made of silk.</p>
<p>She reached for the collar of his shirt. He tilted his head back slightly to give her access. As her fingers brushed against his bare skin inside the shirt, his prominent Adam’s apple bobbed up and down. Her heart pounded like a bouncy ball, crashing through her entire body.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, she managed to undo every button, then pulled the hem out of his trousers. Gripping the front of the shirt, she took a deep breath and slowly took it off.</p>
<p>His chiseled torso was revealed before her eyes. Whether he had slimmed down since his time in South Korea or trained harder, the definition of his muscles was strikingly sharper.</p>
<p>Miran carefully reached out her hand and swept her palm across his chest. Beneath the smooth skin, it felt as solid as if a boulder were embedded within. His abs were just as firm.</p>
<p>“Huu.”</p>
<p>André let out a short breath, tilting his head back toward the ceiling. His jaw was tense and his facial muscles were twitching. The front of his trousers strained to their limit, and his pockets bulged as if he were clenching his fists in them.</p>
<p>Miran pressed her thighs together, drawing her knees close. The area between her legs were hot and throbbing, and soon a moist liquid seeped out. She was worried that her arousal might trickle down her thighs.</p>
<p>She slowly circled André, taking him in as if admiring a masterpiece. Then she stopped behind him. Below his broad, squared shoulders, a straight spine ran down, flanked by large and small muscles that harmoniously interlocked, tapering into a firm waist.</p>
<p>As she carefully caressed his shoulder, the muscles rippled like waves.</p>
<p>Unable to hold back, Miran threw her arms around André and hugged him tightly. She pressed a kiss near his shoulder blade and placed her hand on his chest. His forceful heartbeat pulsed against her palm.</p>
<p>She leaned her ear against his back, sliding her hand downward. Her fingers grazed his abs, descending until they reached his belt buckle. At that moment, his heartbeat rose sharply.</p>
<p>The fine hairs on Miran’s nape stood on end.</p>
<p>She knew he was holding himself back, and she was aware that she was playing a dangerous game.</p>
<p>‘I’ll probably be devoured soon.’</p>
