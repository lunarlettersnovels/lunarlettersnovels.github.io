            <h3>Chapter 32.2</h3>
<p>As soon as the soap was rinsed off their hands, André took Miran’s hand and led her out of the bathroom. In front of the bed, he began unbuttoning her shirt with his still-damp fingers.</p>
<p>Both of them were wearing similar white shirts, almost as if they had planned it. In truth, that morning, Miran had chosen a shirt that reminded her of André’s.</p>
<p>‘It’s like a couple look.’</p>
<p>Miran smiled bashfully, feeling delighted inside, as André removed her shirt and let it fall to the floor. He then unbuttoned her jeans and swiftly pulled them down.</p>
<p>After draping his jacket over a dining chair, he removed his wristwatch and belt, placing them on the bedside drawer. Having spent four consecutive nights together, he now seemed quite familiar with her rooftop room.</p>
<p>Without taking his eyes off Miran, André removed his shirt and pants, standing in just his briefs, which were already bulging.</p>
<p>Miran swallowed hard and sat on the edge of the bed with eyes full of anticipation. André then pounced on her with his broad shoulders, pushing her down. She wrapped her arms around his neck and caressed his shoulders.</p>
<p>Miran liked the feeling of André’s heavy weight enveloping her entire body, pressing down on her. It gave her an inexplicable sense of security. She also liked the luxurious scent of soap emanating from him. Every time he moved, the muscles of his back, firm and smooth, twitched under her palms.</p>
<p>When Miran rubbed her lips against his broad shoulder, André’s breathing grew rougher. He grabbed the back of her head and tilted it at an angle.</p>
<p>The kiss was unbearably sweet. Her heart was pounding so loudly that she felt embarrassed, thinking André could hear it too.</p>
<p>The fact that André didn’t go all the way, citing the lack of a c0nd.om, no longer felt like a consideration for her. It seemed as if he was waiting for her to become so desperate that she would beg him to do it.</p>
<p>She almost blurted out that it was fine and he should just go ahead, but Jieun’s warning about pregnancy being like Russian roulette came to mind.</p>
<p>However, after doing everything except actual penetration for four days straight, she was genuinely curious about what it would feel like to have him inside her. She still worried about his size being too large and possibly causing pain. But the peak pleasure was addictive enough to overcome such primal fears.</p>
<p>‘Should I just buy the c0nd.oms myself?’</p>
<p>The problem was that she didn’t know where to buy c0nd.oms that would fit André.</p>
<p>‘Maybe they have them at a pharmacy.’</p>
<p>While André used both his mouth and hands to bring her to climax, he would end up €jacµlat!ng by guiding her hand to mimic mastµrbat!0n.</p>
<p>Miran also knew what ‘oral s€x’ was.</p>
<p>She remembered reading a scene in a Sidney Sheldon novel, which had been passed around among high school girls until the pages were worn out, where a woman took a man’s p€nis into her mouth and sµcked it.</p>
<p>What had once seemed like a nauseatingly perverse act now felt entirely different. Although she had never done it before and wasn’t confident in her ability, today she wanted to do something for him, not just receive.</p>
<p>Because it was André, she felt she could.</p>
<p>“André?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>André responded absentmindedly, nibbling on her earlobe and lightly sucking on the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>“Ugh. Wait, move aside for a moment.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He firmly dismissed Miran’s request, burying his face in her chest. At times like this, he could be quite headstrong.</p>
<p>“Ha, there’s something I want to try, ah, that’s why.”</p>
<p>“Later.”</p>
<p>He muttered as he pushed up her bra and grabbed a handful of her br€@st. When he didn’t seem to listen, an irritated Miran slid her hand down from his shoulder and applied gentle pressure.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Just as he was about to take the er€ct pe@k of her br€@st into his mouth, André froze. He remained still for a moment, then suddenly lifted his head.</p>
<p>One eyebrow slowly arched like a seagull. He glared at her intently, baring his teeth fiercely.</p>
<p>“…What do you think you’re doing?”</p>
