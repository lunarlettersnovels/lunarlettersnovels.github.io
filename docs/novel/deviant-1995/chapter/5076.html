            <p><strong>Chapter 18.2</strong></p>
<p>‘Now that I’ve done it, it’s no big deal!’</p>
<p>Having done it once, she felt a newfound surge of courage. It was now time to begin the serious practice.</p>
<p>Miran glanced at André out of the corner of her eye. Aside from being a bit rough when speaking Korean, he was an elegant, polite, and well-mannered man.</p>
<p>‘Can such a man really portray Park Doosik properly?’</p>
<p>At that moment, André grabbed the soju glass from the table and downed it in one gulp. Then, without giving Miran a chance to react, he reached out to her.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>André roughly pulled Miran by the nape of her neck and pressed his lips against her surprised, parted lips. The lukewarm soju, both bitter and sweet, flowed into her unguarded mouth. Half of it dribbled down her chin.</p>
<p>André slowly pulled his lips away. Her throat, instinctively opening and closing, allowed a significant amount of soju to pass down her windpipe.</p>
<p>Miran, blinking her wide eyes, covered her mouth and started coughing. She coughed so hard that her face turned red, and tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>“…Are you okay?”</p>
<p>André asked. Although it was a scene from the script, he hadn’t expected her to actually choke.</p>
<p>Miran wiped away her tears with her fingertips and nodded. She then composed her cracked voice and barely managed to deliver her line, gesturing for him to continue.</p>
<p>André glanced at the script once more before lifting his gaze to Miran. The newly learned words were vulgar, but their meaning resonated deeply.</p>
<p>“Chorong. F*ck. You make me h0rny. You, too, strip.”</p>
<p>Miran’s shoulders flinched, and she froze. Surprised by his realistic acting, she realized that André was taking the practice quite seriously.</p>
<p>She seemed to make a decision and bit her lip. Then, she firmly grasped the zipper handle on her side between her thumb and index finger. With a ripping sound, the zipper was pulled down to her hips in one swift motion, causing the bodice of her dress to loosen.</p>
<p>This time, it was André who froze. He hadn’t expected Miran to actually undress. Her face flushed red again, she bowed her head and slowly slid the shoulder straps down.</p>
<p>André clenched his teeth. She was so embarrassed. According to what he had learned, it would be polite to avert his gaze at this point. But that was something beyond human capability.</p>
<p>First, her straight and elegant shoulders were revealed. Then, her voluptuous br3asts, rising above her br@, came into view. The dress, sliding tantalizingly slowly down her body, fell past her hips and dropped to the floor in an instant.</p>
<p>André’s heart thudded loudly and seemed to drop along with the dress. The skipped heartbeat was now pounding dangerously fast.</p>
<p>Her body had graceful curves that seemed to ripple smoothly. A slender waist, hips, and long, lean legs. André let out a short exhale involuntarily.</p>
<p>But it seemed it wasn’t over yet. Miran, still staring at the floor, reached her hands behind her back.</p>
<p>‘No way.’</p>
<p>André shook his head in disbelief at what he was witnessing.</p>
<p>She fluttered her elbows a couple of times to unhook her br@, then quickly brought her hands forward to hold the half-slipped br@ in place. Her chest heaved dramatically.</p>
<p>Miran took a deep breath with her eyes tightly shut, then let go of the br@, only to grab it again, half removing it before covering her ch3st once more.</p>
<p>André, who had been watching her without saying a word, swallowed dryly and blinked his eyes. His eyes stung, indicating he hadn’t blinked once while watching her. He was astonished at how ar0used he had become, like a teenage boy seeing a woman’s n4ked body for the first time, just by watching Miran undress.</p>
<p>Her hands, pressing down on the br@, trembled violently. With her eyes closed, she lifted her head and squinted one eye open. As soon as she confirmed he was watching, a deep blush spread across her entire body like red paint dropped into a glass of water.</p>
<p>André slowly raised his hand. Miran turned her head away, avoiding his hand. With a gentle touch, he removed her hands from her ch3st. The br@ fell to the floor with a soft thud.</p>
