            <h3>Chapter 44.1</h3>
<p>Seeing André laugh out loud without any hesitation was a rare and precious sight.</p>
<p>His usually stern lips curved lazily, and his eyes, like a deep sea sprinkled with gold dust, rippled gently. His broad shoulders shook with laughter, and his distinct abs undulated like waves.</p>
<p>His appearance was as refreshing and splendid as a blue sports drink, almost too captivating to blink.</p>
<p>Miran, who had been trying to escape to the side of the bed, slowly turned over to watch André. Her lips parted into a wide smile, revealing her gums.</p>
<p>Just as his laughter began to fade, it abruptly stopped. André, who had quickly wiped the expression from his face, looked down at her with a cold gaze. Before Miran could gather her thoughts, he leaned over her, trapping her with his hands on either side of her head. His tone was fierce.</p>
<p>“Nope. It’s already too late.”</p>
<p>André, unable to completely erase the laughter from his eyes, grabbed Miran’s chin and pressed her cheeks with his fingers. As her lips puckered from the pressure on her cheeks, he gave a mischievous smile.</p>
<p>Confused by his actions, she looked up at him in bewilderment. Suddenly, André tilted his head and captured her lips in a devouring kiss. He went further, biting down on her lips as if to consume them.</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>Miran struggled, tapping his shoulder. André silently laughed and pressed her down with his lower body. His knee slipped between her legs, which had weakly parted.</p>
<p>As her legs suddenly spr3@d, Miran, feeling uneasy, tightened her thighs. André then bit down on her lower lip.</p>
<p>‘This isn’t even a kiss! What is he doing!’</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>Miran shook her head, trying to escape his grip on her face, and grabbed his forearm. Taking advantage of the moment, André spread her legs wider. Only after positioning himself between them did he release her.</p>
<p>“Why, why are you biting me! You’re not a dog…”</p>
<p>She glared at him, touching her lips. It didn’t hurt, but she was a bit scared that he might actually bite her. André mischievously lifted his lips into a grin and made a growling sound from his throat, like a large dog.</p>
<p>Miran flinched in surprise as André stuck out his tongue and licked her lips with it. Sometimes, André bit and sucked so persistently that she wondered if he was seriously trying to devour her. Sometimes he left red marks in embarrassing places.</p>
<p>‘Today seems a bit more intense.’</p>
<p>Miran pushed his face away and turned her head to the side. Then, André rubbed his high nose against her nape and recklessly licked and rubbed her sensitive skin.</p>
<p>“Ah! Stop, stop! It tickles!”</p>
<p>Miran threw back her head and squirmed with laughter. André took it a step further, slipping his hand under her arm to mercilessly tickle her. Even as she punched and pushed at his shoulder, he only chuckled, not stopping until Miran was gasping and pleading with tears in the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>“I surrender! Ah, please, have mercy!”</p>
<p>Only then did he slowly lift his head. He looked down at her with a gaze that was deeply infused with amusement. After laughing so hard that her stomach hurt, the tension in her body, which had been frozen in fear, finally relaxed.</p>
<p>‘Did he do that to relieve the tension?’</p>
<p>Before they knew it, their faces were filled with smiles. André’s lower body fit snugly between Miran’s widely spread legs. It was just a gentle lick on the nape of her neck and a playful tickle, but her lower body was throbbing, and a warm, sticky liquid was building up, causing goosebumps to break out all over her skin.</p>
<p>André rubbed his lower body meaningfully. Miran’s lower abdomen quivered as she starkly felt his €r€ct p3n!s.</p>
<p>André, who had been gazing at her, tilted his head slightly. Miran, holding her breath and waiting as his eyes drew closer, softly closed her eyes. André gently pressed her lips with his, engaging in a tender and affectionate kiss, the kind shared between lovers. It was like the kiss Miran had given him on their first night.</p>
<p>Her insides, heated and flushed, seemed to melt away completely, leaving her unable to even twitch a finger. André tenderly brushed away the disheveled hair on her forehead.</p>
