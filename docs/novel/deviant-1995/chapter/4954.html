            <p><strong>Chapter 79.2</strong></p>
<p>Despite wearing an impeccable, expensive suit, his long military background made him seem less like a corporate worker and more like a commander heading into battle. His usual ruthless aura, sharp enough to cut down anyone in his way, seemed slightly softened today.</p>
<p>The elevator doors opened on the 15th floor, where the large conference room was.</p>
<p>[Have a good day.]</p>
<p>With a composed voice, André de Lafayette exchanged a brief greeting and disappeared, leaving behind a refreshing afterglow. Hearing his greeting for the first time, the employees remaining in the elevator were left speechless, their mouths agape.</p>
<p>That day, a rumor spread from the secretary’s office that Andre’s work hours would be adjusted to 9:00 a.m. arrivals and 6:00 p.m. departures for the foreseeable future. And indeed, his schedule changed significantly. But the quantity and quality of his work remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The secretary mentioned that he was likely taking stacks of documents home to his new apartment near the company, working through the night, and coming in at 9:00 a.m. Employees nodded knowingly–-of course, that made sense.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Miran eventually moved out of the dorms completely and settled into Andre’s apartment.</p>
<p>At first, she went back to the dorms during the day. She’d eat lunch with kimchi and side dishes she couldn’t bring to Andre’s place because of the smell. After classes, she’d sit at her desk, doing homework while worrying about cockroaches that might come out.</p>
<p>But she knew it was all just pretense.</p>
<p>In America, many couples lived together without marriage if they got along well. But she was Korean.</p>
<p>Even with the 21st century approaching, some still judged unmarried couples living together, and even Miran, who considered herself part of the open-minded Gen X, wasn’t entirely free from that mindset.</p>
<p>Though unlikely, she was scared that Juran might find out, or that her Korean friends might gossip behind her back. But she couldn’t give up spending her time with Andre.</p>
<p>‘Even if bad rumors start to sprea… it’s just the price of being so happy right now. So let’s not get too hurt.’</p>
<p>That was what Miran told herself.</p>
<p>After dinner, Miran stood in front of Andre’s study and knocked lightly.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>She cautiously opened the door, hiding an envelope with ten thousand dollars behind her back. She approached his desk, and abruptly held it out.</p>
<p>Recognizing what it was, Andre didn’t welcome it. Instead, he let out a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>“Kang Miran. I told you, you don’t need to pay it back.”</p>
<p>Startled by his cold tone, Miran stammered.</p>
<p>“It’s not even my money, so how could I possibly keep such a large amount—”</p>
<p>“Have you ever thought that this was money I left for you?”</p>
<p>She looked at him, confused.</p>
<p>“…Why would you leave money for me?”</p>
<p>“Your acting career, I ruined it.”</p>
<p>Miran’s jaw dropped. She’d never imagined Andre thought that way.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about, Andre? When did you—”</p>
<p>He raised his hand to stop her.</p>
<p>“That money is compensation for the opportunities you lost because of me. So you should keep it.”</p>
<p>Miran tilted her head, clutching the envelope, then her eyes widened.</p>
<p>“So… ‘for the opportunities you lost’ meant that? It wasn’t just a scribble?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>She lowered her head, chewing her lip as if deep in thought, then looked up with an unusual firm expression.</p>
<p>“You’re wrong.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Andre, you didn’t ruin my acting career. You saved me from going down the wrong path. Thanks to you, I quit acting, which I had no talent for, and found what I really want to do.”</p>
<p>Miran placed the envelope on the desk and slid it toward him.</p>
<p>“So I don’t need this money.”</p>
<p>“Miran-ah—”</p>
<p>Andre frowned and called her name, but she changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to ask what I want to do? It’s why I came all the way to New York to study English.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>You didn’t come to see me?</em></p>
<p>He’d thought her language study was just an excuse. He knew she had no talent for acting, so her giving it up made sense.</p>
<p>But to hear that she came to New York because she had something she wanted to do, not for him?</p>
<p>It was quite a shock, but he tried not to show it and stared at her.</p>
<p>Miran lowered her eyes slightly, then smiled shyly.</p>
<p>“I actually… want to be a flight attendant.”</p>
<p>This time, even Andre couldn’t hide his surprise.</p>
<p>Why on earth would she want such a tough job?</p>
<p>What’s more, if she went on a long-haul flight overseas, she’d have to stay there for multiple days.</p>
