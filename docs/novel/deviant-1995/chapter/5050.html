            <p><strong>Chapter 31.2</strong></p>
<p>André exhaled sharply towards the ceiling and wrapped his hand around Miran’s. Applying pressure, he moved her hand up and down while looking down at her.</p>
<p>Her flushed cheeks, eyes that sparkled as if light could pass right through them, and plump, swollen red lips.</p>
<p>André clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>Miran glanced at him and moistened her dry lips. When her eyes met André’s gaze, she bit her lower lip and gave a shy, slight smile.</p>
<p>She looked every bit the temptress.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>André’s breathing became noticeably rougher. His rhythmic hand movements quickened, thrµsting his hips into Miran’s palm. The muscles throughout his body tensed, and his tightly packed abs rippled like waves. Sweat trickled down his spine, and veins bulged prominently on his forearms. The reddened gl@ns dripped pre-c*m, wetting her hand.</p>
<p>“Urgh!”</p>
<p>André let out a rough, guttural sound from the back of his throat and jerked his head back. A thick, cloudy fluid shot out with force.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The hot liquid flowed down Miran’s cheek, dripping from her jawline. Before she could even react, the white fluid splattered onto her upper body in a chaotic pattern.</p>
<p>Miran stared in a daze at the obscene sight of André, gritting his teeth and panting like a beast in heat, €jacµlat!ng repeatedly over her body. The muscles of his chest and forearms, glistening with sweat, seemed ready to burst. Only after squeezing out the last drop did he release her hand.</p>
<p>Blood circulation returned to Miran’s fingers, which had turned white under André’s grip. She clenched and unclenched her tingling fingers, then absentmindedly licked the fluid that had dripped to the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>“Ugh, what is this!”</p>
<p>Miran grimaced at the salty and bitter taste of the s€m€n, sticking out her tongue, and André chuckled.</p>
<p>“Still hungry? If you want more, I can give you more.”</p>
<p>Miran immediately glared at André with narrowed eyes. He then wiped the s€m€n from the corner of her mouth with his thumb, a smile lingering on his face.</p>
<p>Miran stared blankly at André’s smiling face. When his stern mouth and cold eyes relaxed, he looked like a different person. Refreshing, seductive… and kind. It was a rare sight, making it all the more precious.</p>
<p>“Wait. I’ll get a towel.”</p>
<p>At André’s words, Miran looked down at herself. From her face to her thighs, she was a mess with cloudy s€m€n.</p>
<p>Holding a towel dampened with water, he stood in front of Miran and neatly folded it. She reached out her hand as if asking for it, but he lightly ignored her.</p>
<p>“Close your eyes.”</p>
<p>When Miran obediently closed her eyes, André carefully wiped her face. From her face to her collarbone, chest, stomach, and thighs. He gently and meticulously cleaned his traces off her and then gave a wry smile.</p>
<p>For the second day, he sprayed s€m€n on Miran’s body.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like a beast marking its territory, but what was he doing? When the urge to climax reached its peak, he couldn’t resist the impulse to ejaculate on her body. The satisfaction of that moment was as great as the pleasure of the climax itself. It was clearly a very bad habit.</p>
<p>André put down the towel and lifted her into his arms.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to bed.”</p>
<p>Startled, Miran quickly wrapped her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>The night was still long, and there were endless ways to enjoy it. André carried her to the bed, his lips still tasting sweet.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>André spent four consecutive nights at Miran’s house. Even he found it hard to believe. Every night, they indulged in pleasure until dawn in various and inventive ways.</p>
<p>Once Miran fell asleep, exhausted, André would quietly leave the rooftop room and take a taxi back to the hotel.</p>
<p>The empty early morning streets blurred past the window like a dark smear.</p>
<p>André sank heavily into a mix of hollow regret, vague guilt, and bitter self-reproach. Even his own silhouette, faintly reflected in the taxi window, felt unfamiliar.</p>
