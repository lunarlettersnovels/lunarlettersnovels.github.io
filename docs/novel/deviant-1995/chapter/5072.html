            <p><strong>Chapter 20.2</strong></p>
<p>After the second statement ended, André took a while to swallow his dry saliva, and then began the first line of the third statement. Miran twisted her waist from side to side, as if trying to confirm the identity of the thing pressing against her lower abdomen. André gritted his teeth so hard that his molars creaked.</p>
<p>At that moment, Miran, who had her face buried in his chest, lifted her head. She gasped in surprise and hastily rubbed the tear stains on his shirt, which had formed in the shape of her eyes, nose, and mouth. It was a truly foolish act.</p>
<p>Soon, realizing she was rubbing André’s chest without permission, Miran flinched and glanced up at him, gauging his reaction.</p>
<p>In the end, Captain André de Lafayette couldn’t finish his third statement.</p>
<p>His gaze, which had been fixed on the bubble on the ceiling, was irresistibly drawn to Miran’s face, like metal to a magnet.</p>
<p>Her large brown eyes, now free from the shock of the script practice, transparently revealed innocent curiosity and clumsy desire. André, whose gaze had sunk into a deep oceanic green, stared intently into those eyes.</p>
<p>Her innocent gaze inadvertently drifted down to André’s lips. Then, the tip of her pink tongue peeked out between her plump lips, moistening them.</p>
<p>André’s Adam’s apple bobbed up and down. A raw desire, reminiscent of the smell of gasoline, ignited within him. The youthful blood pumped by his vigorously beating heart roared just beneath the surface of his skin, in the capillaries.</p>
<p>This was madness.</p>
<p>The woman before him was a deviation.</p>
<p>A derailment that would never happen again in his lifetime.</p>
<p>So, just this once…</p>
<p>[Fu!ck.]</p>
<p>The moment he uttered a curse he rarely used, he grabbed Miran by the nape of her neck and brought his lips down to hers.</p>
<p>André’s kiss was anything but gentlemanly.</p>
<p>The man who had gently comforted her while she cried was gone, replaced by lips that crashed into hers with a searing heat, as if to devour her alive. His rough, breathless sounds mercilessly sucked in her delicate, uneven breaths.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>As her startled lips parted, a rogue-like tongue invaded her mouth. She couldn’t tell if the man kissing her was André or the character Park Doosik that André was portraying.</p>
<p>Miran’s head spun. André’s tongue wrapped around hers, pressing and rubbing against it. His pointed tongue traced her orderly teeth and licked every corner of her soft mucous membranes.</p>
<p>Her mouth felt more sensitive than her armpits, tickling intensely. Every time his tongue delved deeply and scraped her rounded palate, Miran shuddered.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>The fine hairs on her body stood on end, and her breath mixed with a delicate nasal sound. When his tongue teasingly flicked the tip of hers, it sent a tingling sensation somewhere behind her ears, like the feeling of smelling citrus, and her mouth filled with saliva.</p>
<p>As if intent on devouring her tongue, which was trying to escape, André coaxed it gently into his mouth. Each time their tongues collided and their wet lips met and parted, it produced an erotic sound reminiscent of a movie kiss scene.</p>
<p>Miran, whose legs had given out, clung to his sleeve. Somewhere between her legs, she felt a tingling sensation. As she squeezed her thighs and rubbed her knees together, her already damp panties clung to her nether regions.</p>
<p>‘Is this what a kiss is supposed to be?’</p>
<p>It was completely different from any kiss she had experienced before.</p>
<p>As André released her lips and withdrew his hands, Miran, panting heavily, felt her entire body go weak, wanting to collapse onto the floor. André scooped her up effortlessly with both arms as she swayed feebly.</p>
<p>“W-what are you doing? Put me down!”</p>
<p>Frightened of falling, Miran clung to André’s neck. Her head almost touched the ceiling. It was the first time since childhood that she had been held like this. She was astonished at how easily he lifted her as if she were a child.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?!”</p>
<p>Without answering, André strode over to the edge of the bed and sat down. The cheap mattress sank deeply, and the springs creaked. Only after seating her diagonally on his thigh did André finally speak.</p>
<p>[Improvisation.]</p>
<p>At the same time, he pressed his lips to hers.</p>
<p>Miran knew the word. But she didn’t have the time to seriously consider his answer.</p>
<p>After ravaging her mouth, André scattered small kisses along her jawline and moved his lips to her ear. As he nibbled on her earlobe, his rough and hot breath tickled her eardrum.</p>
