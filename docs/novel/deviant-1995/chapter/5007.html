            <p><strong>Chapter 53.1</strong></p>
<p>Miran’s waist twisted and trembled violently. Her inner w4lls, contracting from the pleasure of cl!m4x, squeezed his throbbing p3n!s mercilessly tight.</p>
<p>“Ngh!”</p>
<p>Unable to hold back anymore, Andre sank his teeth into her neck. As he pressed his lower body down firmly, Miran convulsed again in ecstasy as she ca@.m3 a second time. He slowly withdrew his hips. His t!p scraped against her inner bone before pulling out to the entrance, then thrust back in rapidly, pressing the same spot. When he pushed up to the end, grazing her c3rv!x, Miran trembled all over and let out a scream.</p>
<p>“Ah! I just…! Th-this is too, strange—”</p>
<p>She shuddered and covered her bulging lower abdomen with her hands, pressing as if to push him out. Then she gasped sharply and her inner w4lls tightened again.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah! I’m coming again…!”</p>
<p>Andre pushed Miran’s hand away and slipped his arm under her waist, pressing firmly against her lower abdomen. He could vividly feel his c0.!ck through the think skin of her stomach. The perverse pleasure of being able to see and feel his part that filled her from the outside drove him to extreme excitement.</p>
<p>“Hnng, I feel like I’m dying, this is really strange, aah!”</p>
<p>The tip of his c0.!ck repeatedly struck that spot that made her hair stand on end at the slightest touch. When the unbearable, torturous pleasure continued, she became frightened and finally burst into tears. The excessive pleasure was close to pain.</p>
<p>“Ahk, Andre, Andre…!”</p>
<p>White light flickered behind her tightly closed eyelids. Miran, gasping while calling his name, soon reached an explosive cli!.m@ax. Her legs, which had been wrapped tightly around his waist, stretched out into the air and convulsed like leaves trembling in the wind. Her toe joints, curled as if they would break, turned pale white.</p>
<p>Andre’s eyes lost all reason as he approached his cli!.m@ax. Even though his fingers were being scraped against the rough rocks behind Miran’s head, he couldn’t feel any pain.</p>
<p>“I love you, Andre! Hng, don’t, don’t forget me!”</p>
<p>Miran clung to him, her shoulders trembling as she cried with emotion. Andre looked up at the sky once, biting his lip, his brow terribly contorted. After swallowing something that had risen to his throat, he buried his face in her neck, hiding his trembling breath. Then he began thrusting his hips at a ferocious pace.</p>
<p>The muscles in his back clenched, the tendons in his neck tightened, the muscles in his thighs bulged hard. He made a sound like a wounded beast as he gripped his c0.!ck and pulled back his hips.</p>
<p>“Ngh.”</p>
<p>His body tensed as he released onto Miran’s stomach. She held tightly to his shoulders until his final shudder subsided.</p>
<p>His co!0c.k throbbed, spurting hot fluid over her belly. She clung desperately to his shoulders until he shuddered and spilled every last drop.</p>
<p>Her limbs grew heavy, tears streaming from her moonlit brown eyes. The distant rumble of a passing night train merged with their heartbeats, drowning out her quiet sobs.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>“Miran.”</p>
<p>A pleasant voice called her name.</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>Half-asleep, Miran reached toward the voice. Her searching fingers found a dry, warm palm. She nestled her cheek against it like a pillow.</p>
<p>A low laugh resonated sweetly in her ears. Gentle fingers brushed away the hair scattered across her face. The heavy drowsiness still weighed on her head. She nuzzled against the palm beneath her cheek, murmuring.</p>
<p>“Just a little longer…”</p>
<p>“It’s time to go.”</p>
<p>Go where?</p>
<p>Her heart plummeted to her toes as her eyes snapped open.</p>
<p>Green eyes with a faint smile looked down at her, along with the camper van’s ceiling.</p>
<p>Ah. Thank goodness. We still have one day.</p>
<p>Miran sighed in relief, reaching up to wrap her arms around his neck and pull him down. The large man offered no resistance as he descended.</p>
<p>“What time is it?”</p>
<p>Miran’s voice came out terribly hoarse. Andre’s lips touched her temple.</p>
<p>“One in the afternoon.”</p>
<p>“…Already?”</p>
<p>They had made passionate love until just before dawn, falling asleep with limbs entwined on the narrow camper van bed. That was the last thing she remembered.</p>
<p>“Yes. We need to leave now.”</p>
