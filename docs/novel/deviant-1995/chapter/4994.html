            <p><strong>Chapter 59.2</strong></p>
<p>André wondered if Miran would have just forgotten about the address and moved on with her life if she hadn’t seen the note and gone to check it out. Even when she had tearfully asked if she could write to him—something that had shaken his resolve a little—would she have eventually let it go?</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn’t a bad thing.</p>
<p>Both he and Miran had to live their lives where they are.</p>
<p>He just…</p>
<p>Hoped she was doing well, healthy, and without any problems. And he felt relieved to know that.</p>
<p>But when he read the poem, which contained a heartfelt confession that she would keep her love for a long time instead of giving up on it, just because it was unattainable—he felt a treacherous emotion that was hard to define.</p>
<p>Amidst the bewilderment, a strange sense of relief gently stroked his shoulders stiff with stress. The thought that Miran was still longing for him, with her eyes full of the same undisguised affection as he remembered, made his lower body feel hot.</p>
<p>It was a possessiveness that even he thought was shameless and petty.</p>
<p>André thought Miran’s letter ended here, but as he was folding it to put it back in the envelope, he discovered there was another page. André realized he was grinning and composed his expression.</p>
<p>‘PS. For your lost opportunity – What the heck does this even mean? Did you just scribble it?</p>
<p>Oh, and I’m keeping your shirt and cubic zirconia cufflinks safe. Unless you need them now, can I give them to you when we meet again? I don’t know when that will be, but I’m working hard to save money to travel to New York.’</p>
<p>André raised the corners of his lips and fiddled with the cufflinks on his sleeves.</p>
<p>‘She thought that was just scribbles.’</p>
<p>That was so like Kang Miran.</p>
<p>[Cubic zirconia cufflinks…]</p>
<p>The platinum cufflinks, with a diamond in the center and André’s initials engraved on either side, were a gift he had received from his mother on his eighteenth birthday. He often wore them.</p>
<p>He had many other cufflinks, but he couldn’t explain why he had given her his favorite ones. It was just one of the many impulsive things he had done with Miran during his last two weeks in Korea.</p>
<p>As André recalled the memory of putting his shirt on Miran, he was startled by the loud ringing of the telephone and snatched up the heavy phone with its protruding antenna.</p>
<p>[Lafayette Residence. André speaking.]</p>
<p>His voice was curt, annoyed by the interruption.</p>
<p>— Hello, André. It’s Lorraine. How have you been?</p>
<p>[…Fine. And you? Ah, about what you said at the last dinner party…]</p>
<p>Lorraine chuckled lightly on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>— You’re still direct and don’t know how to make small talk. That polite yet rude way of speaking. You know everyone lets it slide because you’re a Lafayette, right?</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, a grand dinner party was held in the formal dining hall of the Lafayette Residence, inviting the major shareholders of the board and their families. It was a welcome back party for André’s return to New York. However, everyone realized the true intention behind inviting all the major shareholders except for the Gordon Lowell family.</p>
<p>He had reunited with Lorraine at that time.</p>
<p>Perhaps because Gordon Lowell was also friendly with her parents, she was already well aware of the coup that had taken place within the Lafayette-Lowell Group. Thanks to that, they had a rather meaningful conversation that went beyond just asking after each other’s well-being like awkward old classmates.</p>
<p>[André, shall I tell you how to bring Collins Company over to Lafayette’s side?]</p>
<p>[…What is it?]</p>
<p>[It’s a kind of give-and-take strategy. But it’s too sensitive to talk about here… I’ll contact you soon. Let’s talk in private.]</p>
<p>That was already two weeks ago. In truth, he didn’t have high expectations for Lorraine. Seeing her mother acting particularly awkward at the party and avoiding eye contact with him with a guilty look, it seemed that, as expected, they had decided to side with Gordon Lowell.</p>
<p>Even if André were in their position, knowing that Charles was an incompetent figurehead, he would have sided with Gordon Lowell for the sake of business.</p>
<p>He didn’t know how Lorraine would change their minds, but if it could be of any help, he had to grasp at straws.</p>
