            <p><strong>Chapter 9.1</strong></p>
<p>Miran wrapped her arms around Juran, who was a head shorter and rubbed her cheek against Juran’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Unni, why did you come so late? I’ve been waiting for ages…”</p>
<p>As Miran affectionately clung to her, Juran’s hand, which had been hitting Miran’s back, lost its strength.</p>
<p>“You’re going to be the death of me. You should have a child just like you someday and see how much trouble it is!”</p>
<p>“Wow, you’re saying scary things, miss Kang Juran.”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s hot! Get off me.”</p>
<p>Miran sniffed as she grabbed Juran’s hand, trying to push her away.</p>
<p>“Sniff. I smell charcoal grill on my girl.”</p>
<p>“We had a company dinner.”</p>
<p>“It’s not the company’s anniversary today. And you usually go to a Chinese restaurant for that. This is charcoal-grilled meat smell. That cheapskate wouldn’t have bought meat.”</p>
<p>“… You’re not a bloodhound. Ah, get away from me.”</p>
<p>Juran lightly pushed Miran away and walked to the sink, raising her hand to smell it discreetly.</p>
<p>“Are you still working at the barbecue restaurant? You don’t need to pay tuition anymore, so why are you doing that? You always complain about your back hurting. You said you’d quit!”</p>
<p>“Your Poidong rent ends next month. I’m just doing it until then, and then I’ll really quit.”</p>
<p>During her first semester of college, Miran commuted from Yongin to a school in the middle of Seoul. She often slept over at a classmate’s place, using excuses like the last train had left after freshman orientation or welcome orientation.</p>
<p>Juran, who always nagged that women shouldn’t sleep over at other people’s places and should always come home no matter how late, eventually got Miran a small studio in Poidong. It was close to Juran’s office and in an alley far from the busy streets, so the rent wasn’t high.</p>
<p>Juran often dropped by unexpectedly on her way home from work, like a spot check, looking for any signs of a boyfriend. Because of this, Miran never brought a boyfriend to the studio and only hung out near the school. The lease for the studio was ending next month, and Miran would have to move back home.</p>
<p>“You’re lying. After the rent ends, you’ll say, just until I get a job. Then after that, just until I get married!”</p>
<p>Juran laughed softly, her face still puffy from fatigue. Her gentle eyes crinkled with wrinkles.</p>
<p>“You know me well, Kang Miran. So, what should you do?”</p>
<p>Miran thought of “A Gangster’s Innocence,” Director Jung Byungjin, and Yang Hyuna.</p>
<p>‘Would that really make me famous? Can I make sure my poor big sister doesn’t have to suffer anymore?’</p>
<p>At her graduation, Miran boasted that she would make a spectacular debut in Chungmuro within six months. That time had already passed, so now she really needed to take drastic measures.</p>
<p>Juran always clipped Miran’s magazine appearances and collected all the flyers with her ads in between newspapers. She made sure to watch any movie she appeared in as an extra, even if it was just a blurry image of her as a passerby walking down the street without saying a word.</p>
<p>But this time, Miran had to keep it a secret from Juran.</p>
<p>‘She’ll find out anyway once the movie comes out…’</p>
<p>But if she succeeded, she could buy her sister an apartment in Seoul, get her a car, and make her quit all her tough jobs. Even if it meant doing a revealing role, she could do it. She had to.</p>
<p>“Sis, just wait a little longer. I’ll make sure you never have to lift a finger again!”</p>
<p>When Miran declared this with a serious expression, Juran smiled gently and patted her cheek.</p>
<p>“My, how reassuring. Our youngest, did you eat?”</p>
<p>“What time do you think it is?”</p>
<p>“If I knew you were coming, I would’ve taken a day off from the barbecue restaurant. You should’ve called ahead. By the way, aren’t you out of kimchi?”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Miran’s answer, Juran opened the fridge.</p>
<p>“You’re staying over, right? I’ll pack some radish kimchi and scallion kimchi for you to take back. I should have bought something for breakfast tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Miran followed Juran to the table and pulled out a chair to sit down.</p>
<p>“That’s why I told you to get a pager! I called you so many times, but you didn’t answer.”</p>
<p>Juran responded indifferently as she took out a stainless-steel kimchi container and placed it on the table, then pulled out an empty plastic container from the cupboard.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you buy me one when you get a job?”</p>
<p>Miran paused.</p>
<p>Her sister always said she didn’t need a pager. But that’s only because she didn’t know how convenient it was.</p>
