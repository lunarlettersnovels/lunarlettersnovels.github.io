            <p><strong>Chapter 81.2</strong></p>
<p>Worrying about things that hadn’t even happened wasn’t like her. Like Mr. Keating’s advice in Dead Poets Society—Carpe Diem—she decided to live in the moment. She didn’t want to miss out on present happiness by fretting over an uncertain future.</p>
<p>Miran glanced at the wall clock. It was already 6:30. It was the time André usually arrived home.</p>
<p>As soon as she stepped into the living room, she heard keys jingling outside the door. Tiptoeing quietly, she yanked the door open just as he inserted the key.</p>
<p>“Surprise!”</p>
<p>André, who was standing in front of the door with a heavy briefcase and a frown on his face, raised his head in surprise. Miran stood on her toes and gave him a quick kiss.</p>
<p>“Welcome home! You worked hard today.”</p>
<p>“When did you get here?”</p>
<p>“I rushed all the way from the subway to get home before you!”</p>
<p>André let out a small chuckle at her silly remark, and finally softened his expression. His eyes swept over her in his shirt, pulled her by the waist, and kissed her lips once more.</p>
<p>He lifted his head and gazed down at her, steady and intent. The golden ring around his pupils blazed like fire encircling the sun. Her heart melted in the heat that felt close enough to touch.</p>
<p>‘What can I do when I love him so much?’</p>
<p>The difference in their social status was too great—she didn’t know how to stop herself from loving him. So, even if her heart ended up torn to shreds and shattered someday, she wanted to love him with everything she had, without regret, while she could.</p>
<p>Miran threw herself into his arms. André dropped his briefcase and hugged her back, burying his face in her neck and taking a deep breath. After holding her for a while and stroking her back, he asked as he loosened his embrace.</p>
<p>“Dinner?”</p>
<p>Miran burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re really not from Busan?”</p>
<p>André let out an amused snort and picked up the briefcase he tossed aside. Then he opened the closet by the door to change into his indoor slippers.</p>
<p>Miran couldn’t stand the idea of someone walking around the house in shoes worn outside. Half-joking, half-serious, she warned André that if he insisted on keeping his shoes on, she might just move back to the dorm. Without a word of protest, he went out and got a pair of indoor slippers.</p>
<p>There was no way she couldn’t love a man who changed a lifelong habit just because of something she said.</p>
<p>André set up a small desk for Miran to one corner of his study. While he worked on company matters he brought home from the office, she sat there doing her homework.</p>
<p>In class today, they learned how to order food. Since there were many phrases and words that could be useful for her work as a flight attendant, she studied especially hard.</p>
<p>After finishing her homework with the help of an electronic dictionary, she practiced speaking under her breath, then yawned and checked the time.</p>
<p>It was already 10 o’clock. André had been working for two hours without moving. She’d probably have to go to bed first tonight.</p>
<p>‘But… isn’t he overdoing it? He should rest, even for a bit.’</p>
<p>Miran approached cautiously, stealing glances at André as she sat in the chair in front of his desk. He glanced up at her briefly before returning to his papers.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Just take a five-minute break.”</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>He responded but didn’t seem inclined to stop.</p>
<p>Miran cleared her throat, then, rolling her pronunciation, quoted a sentence she’d learned today and asked him a question.</p>
<p>[Can I have a hamburger, cola, and French fries?]</p>
<p>“Don’t eat that. It’s junk.”</p>
<p>André replied in Korean without looking up.</p>
<p>Miran clicked her tongue and scolded him.</p>
<p>“Ai, come on. You’re supposed to ask, ‘To go or to stay’!”</p>
<p>Only then did he finally look up. He raised an eyebrow and snorted.</p>
<p>“So now you want me to play a fast-food cashier? Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“It’s just conversation practice. What’s the big deal? Come on, quick!”</p>
<p>As Miran pestered him, André let out a small sigh and, eyes still on his paperwork, gave her a half-hearted reply.</p>
<p>[…To go or to stay.]</p>
<p>Miran grinned slyly. André always looked like he wouldn’t give in—but in the end, he did everything she asked.</p>
<p>[To go, please! Ah, and a loooooooot of ketchup, please. Thank you so much!]</p>
<p>Miran answered with excitement, then let out a pleased little giggle and grinned with pride.</p>
<p>André paused mid-signature. After a few seconds later, he pressed a hand to his forehead and burst into laughter. He lifted his head, bit his lower lip and stared at her. Then, he tossed his pen aside and pushed the papers away.</p>
<p>[Come here.]</p>
<p>It looked like he was finally giving in to be her conversation partner. Miran sprang to her feet and came closer. André caught her by the waist and lifted her onto the desk.</p>
<p>He pulled his chair closer and said.</p>
<p>[I feel like eating you up now.]</p>
