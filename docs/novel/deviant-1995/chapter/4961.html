            <p><strong>Chapter 76.1</strong></p>
<p>Miran approached him shyly. Perhaps she was having the same thoughts, as her cheeks were already flushed.</p>
<p>André silently chuckled.</p>
<p>He couldn’t let down the expectations reflected in her innocent and honest face.</p>
<p>He pulled Miran closer and had her sit facing him on his thigh. She looked down bashfully, tucking her hair behind her ear. Biting her lip, she glanced at his lips as if she was waiting for him to kiss her first.</p>
<p>With a playful smirk, André casually said, “Try kissing me.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>Miran lifted her head and asked back in surprise.</p>
<p>“What? You don’t know how to kiss?”</p>
<p>“…I do!”</p>
<p>With a feigned haughty expression, Miran lightly cupped André’s face with both hands. Her face moved slowly toward him, teasingly close. Then, she tilted her head slightly and gently pressed her lips against his forehead.</p>
<p>After a moment of hesitation, as if searching her memories, she lingered on his eyebrows and eyelids before suddenly changing direction and brushing her nose against his lips. Then she moved to his cheeks and finally to the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>Ha. It was as if he had fallen for his own trick.</p>
<p>He realized she was mimicking the kiss he had teased her with in the living room of the Lafayette Residence. The problem was that even such a ticklish, childlike kiss made his body temperature soar.</p>
<p>His lower body twitched at such a kiss. Strangely, his pride felt bruised. He was dumbfounded, but he had already learned through experience that his reactions to Miran were beyond what he could control with reason.</p>
<p>In the end, André greedily grasped Miran’s waist. As he slowly rubbed her hips over his already half-erect center, she pulled her lips away in surprise.</p>
<p>Seizing the opportunity, André swiftly wrapped his hand around her nape and pressed their lips together again.</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>He sucked on her lips, then probed her mouth with his tongue. He entwined her retreating tongue, pulling and sucking it, swallowing every m0a,n she let out. Only then did he feel a slight sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>When Miran, seemingly breathless, tapped his shoulder, he briefly pulled his lips away. She gasped for air.</p>
<p>“Shower first, then we’ll do it. I’ve been out all day, you know.”</p>
<p>André muttered nonchalantly, “It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not fine! Would it be okay if I touched you with dirty hands?”</p>
<p>He paused, then let out a soft chuckle. She was throwing back the exact words he’d once said to her. Without further argument, he lifted her in his arms and stood up from the sofa.</p>
<p>“Kkyaah!”</p>
<p>Startled, she screamed and wrapped her arms around his neck, her legs clinging to his waist.</p>
<p>“You scared me!”</p>
<p>“You said you wanted to wash up.”</p>
<p>As he carried her down the hallway, she murmured in awe, “Wow, the ceiling is so high.”</p>
<p>Their eyes met, and without saying a word, they both recalled the rooftop room at the same time. When Miran laughed, André couldn’t help but smile slightly.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The apartment had two guest rooms. At first, he planned to give one of them to Miran. But when they actually arrived home, he wondered if it was really necessary.</p>
<p>The master bedroom was spacious enough for both of them, so sharing it wouldn’t be a problem. Therefore, he placed Miran’s belongings in the walk-in closet of the master bedroom.</p>
<p>It was a bit strange that he didn’t feel any discomfort at having someone else suddenly enter his private space, but he brushed it off, attributing it to the time they had spent together in South Korea.</p>
<p>André carried her into the master bathroom. He set Miran down on the marble countertop between the two sinks and, before she could gather her thoughts, he quickly pulled off her T-shirt. Then he gathered her long hair, which fell to her waist, to one side, exposing her back.</p>
<p>In the mirror above the sink, her smooth back and slender waist were reflected. He reached out over her shoulder.</p>
<p>The large hand, with sinewy veins stretching like tree branches, delicately grasped the lace strap, unfastening the bra hook in a manner that felt almost quite obsc3ne. As the bra was pulled down, perfectly shaped br3@s.ts were exposed.</p>
<p>André swallowed hard, his throat dry. Only then did he realize that his memories had failed to capture even half of her allure.</p>
<p>Miran, meeting his gaze, quickly lowered her head. A flush spread like dominos across her exceptionally pale skin, which seemed untouched by sunlight. The pink p3@.ks st!ff`n.3d under his watchful eyes.</p>
<p>André let out a heated breath. A bead of sweat trickled down his spine.</p>
<p>Setting Miran down on the floor, he stripped off her jeans and p@n.t!es at once.</p>
<p>Her dazzling na.k3d body was laid bare.</p>
