            <p><strong>Chapter 53.2</strong></p>
<p>Andre gently helped her sit up and handed her coffee while she was still gathering her wits. Then he placed her clothes on the bed.</p>
<p>The clothes they’d tossed onto the gravel last night, completely soaked, were now sun-dried. She noticed the camper van was tidied up too. Andre must have been busy while she slept.</p>
<p>After a quick wash in the cramped bathroom and getting dressed, she came out to find Andre starting the engine. He reached out to help her into the passenger seat, even fastening her seatbelt.</p>
<p>For a man so reserved, Andre was quite a gentleman.</p>
<p>Before Andre could straighten up from leaning towards her, Miran planted a quick kiss on his cheek with a soft ‘chu’ sound. Andre paused, turning to face her. When Miran gave a shy, bright smile, he smiled back and tilted his head, leaning in.</p>
<p>She lifted her chin slightly to meet him. Lips pressed together gently before parting with lingering warmth. The kiss was so soft it almost brought tears to her eyes.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>On the way back to Seoul, they stopped at a highway rest stop for a late lunch. Taking their time driving, they arrived at Dragon Valley Hotel at seven in the evening.</p>
<p>In the suite, Andre ordered room service for dinner. Though Miran wasn’t very hungry and couldn’t eat much, she chatted about various things throughout the meal. Andre seemed to lack appetite as well, barely touching his food, occasionally caressing her cheek or offering gentle smiles.</p>
<p>After dinner, Andre silently packed his belongings. Having sent most of his things to New York after retiring and leaving his military quarters, he only had one carrier and a duffle bag left.</p>
<p>They shared a bath, and when they lay down on the large bed, Andre entered her slowly and sweetly. Miran fought to stay awake, pinching her cheeks and jolting herself awake whenever she dozed off, even as Andre exhausted her beyond tears. But finally, near dawn, she fell into a deep sleep after one last c.li!m@x.</p>
<p>Andre carefully got out of bed, trying not to wake her. He cleaned her gently with a warm towel. Then he took a shirt from his carrier and dressed her in it. Only after buttoning it up completely, neatly rolling up both sleeves, and even fastening the cuff links did he step out to the living room.</p>
<p>He picked up the phone beside the sofa and placed his final room service order.</p>
<p>[Ten AM. Korean breakfast. No, just for one person.]</p>
<p>Andre took his time showering, shaving meticulously, and dressing formally down to his jacket. Emerging from the bathroom, he was drawn to the bed, gazing down at Miran. Even with direct light from the open bathroom, she didn’t stir.</p>
<p>A beautiful face where innocence met sensuality, a voluptuous body. Like the wicked nymphs of myth who lured men into their forests with breaths sweet as poison, turning them to fools, never releasing their sacrificial lambs until driving them to madness.</p>
<p>‘…I wonder what face she’d make if I woke her.’</p>
<p>With a bitter smile, he turned and opened the bedside drawer. He tore off a hotel notepad page, wrote something, and placed a thick envelope on top of it.</p>
<p>As Andre was about to turn off the bathroom light and leave, his steps slowed, then stopped at the doorway. He returned to the nightstand and picked up the pen. After frowning in thought for a while, he flipped over the note and wrote something before setting it back down.</p>
<p>In the living room, Andre placed his duffle bag on top of his carrier and scanned the room one last time for anything left behind. His gaze lingered on the open bedroom door.</p>
<p>[What I’m leaving behind…]</p>
<p>His legs moved before his mind could decide. Back in the bedroom, Andre stood beside the bed. His throat felt strangely tight as he swallowed. After burning her image into his memory one last time, he slowly bent down.</p>
<p>His eyes closed as he kissed her sleeping lips. He remained frozen in that position before finally pulling away and opening his eyes. Straightening up, squaring his shoulders, he turned from the bed with military precision.</p>
<p>Thud. His heart shook.</p>
<p>With each step, thud, thud-thud.</p>
<p>His heart felt displaced, rattling in his chest. Pressing his fist against his aching chest, he pulled his carrier out of the suite.</p>
<p>[Farewell.]</p>
<p>His voice, barely above a whisper, caught in his throat.</p>
<p>The door to the corner suite clicked shut with a heavy thud.</p>
