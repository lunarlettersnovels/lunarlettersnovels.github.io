            <p><strong>Chapter 57.2</strong></p>
<p>Andre, sitting with a contemplative expression, carefully chose his words.</p>
<p>[A dinner party at Lafayette Residence on the Friday two weeks from now would be appropriate.]</p>
<p>Charles asked in surprise:</p>
<p>[A dinner party? I thought you didn’t like such things.]</p>
<p>[I don’t. But it’s unavoidable. We’ll invite the board’s major shareholders to identify and persuade those who are friendly or neutral to our side. The pretext will be…]</p>
<p>Andre tapped his fingers lightly on the desk. Charles immediately snapped his fingers in response.</p>
<p>[How about your welcome party? You’ve returned to New York after completing military service, so we should have a welcome party.]</p>
<p>[…Very well. Can you handle the preparations?]</p>
<p>[Ah, this is something I can definitely help with. Leave it to me.]</p>
<p>Charles’s face lit up now that he had found a way to contribute.</p>
<p>[Currently, the third-largest shareholders are the Lowell family, and the fourth-largest are Collins Company. If Collins becomes our ally, it won’t be easy for the other side. I recall the Baroness Cabot was close friends with my mother.]</p>
<p>Charles nodded.</p>
<p>[That’s right. The relationship between Lowell and Collins is similar to Lafayette and Hamilton. They’ve had a long history since the Boston days. Though I suspect Collins might already be on Gordon Lowell’s side… Wait. Weren’t you and Lady Lorraine friends? I remember seeing you two together often as children.]</p>
<p>Andre was surprised that Charles even remembered such a detail. Had he been watching him all along?</p>
<p>Lady Lorraine Collins Cabot, born to British Baron Henry Cabot and Collins Company heiress Madeline Collins, had grown up in an environment similar to Andre’s.</p>
<p>Due to their mothers’ friendship, they had frequently socialized during childhood and were also private school classmates. As members of the closed, elite upper class dominating New York, they naturally crossed paths often.</p>
<p>However, during the past 10 years away from New York, he had rarely seen her. After high school, Lorraine went to a finishing school in Switzerland, while Andre went to West Point Military Academy, effectively cutting off their contact. When Andre was commissioned and came to New York on leave, they would occasionally cross paths and exchange brief greetings.</p>
<p>But in this situation where every percentage point of shares mattered, he could certainly leverage their old friendship.</p>
<p>[That’s right. Please invite Lady Lorraine as well.]</p>
<p>[Yes, understood.]</p>
<p>[Then, I’ll take my leave now.]</p>
<p>Andre stood up without hesitation. Charles hesitated and then asked:</p>
<p>[…What about dinner?]</p>
<p>[I’m tired. I’ll have it in my room.]</p>
<p>Charles smiled awkwardly and nodded.</p>
<p>[Understood. Go ahead.]</p>
<p>As Andre was about to turn and leave, Charles called out to him.</p>
<p>[Andre!]</p>
<p>Halfway out of the study, Andre slightly furrowed his brow and turned his head. Charles carefully smiled.</p>
<p>[Thank you for coming. It’s good to see you, reassuring. And… I’m sorry things have come to this.]</p>
<p>Andre swallowed something rising in his throat, gave a polite bow to Charles, and closed the study door.</p>
<p>He wanted to hate his father. But the fact that he couldn’t made it more painful.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On a Saturday morning without work, Miran woke up late and shivered at the cold air seeping through the old villa’s window cracks. It was already November, and mornings and evenings were quite chilly.</p>
<p>Her attic room’s lease had ended in September, so Miran had returned to Juran’s villa in Yongin. It felt both comfortable and frustrating to be home again.</p>
<p>Thanks to Juran’s strict supervision, she could no longer roam around late with Jieun like before. More importantly, she no longer felt the desire to go out and play. Jieun’s frustration was palpable.</p>
<p>Miran ate breakfast and lunch using the side dishes Juran had prepared before leaving for work, then returned to her room and sat at her desk. The Dragon Valley Hotel memo note stuck to the wall fluttered slightly in the draft.</p>
<p>‘For your lost opportunity.’</p>
<p>Propping her chin on her hand and staring at the memo, Miran, unable to bear her frustration, began pounding her desk with her fist.</p>
<p>“What the hell does this even mean?”</p>
