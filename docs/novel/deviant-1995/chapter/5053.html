            <h3>Chapter 30.1</h3>
<p>Miran bit her lower lip shyly and glanced up at him. Without a word, André pulled her close by the nape of her neck and pressed his lips against hers, as if to prove something. His tongue darted out, licking her lips. Surprised, Miran released her lip, only for him to immediately suck on her swollen lips, gently biting down.</p>
<p>His tongue, soaked with her sweetness, slipped between her lips. He traced her teeth and pressed his tongue against hers, leaving her breathless as he deepened the kiss. Overwhelmed by the sweetness and intensity, Miran gasped, her mind spinning.</p>
<p>André finally pulled away. Miran, dazed and panting, slowly licked the saliva that had mixed with the lingering sweetness off her lips with her now bright red tongue. Then, in a cracked voice, she whispered as she clung to his neck.</p>
<p>“Your kiss… it’s so sweet. I love it…”</p>
<p>He sucked in a sharp breath. His lips traveled down her smooth jawline, nibbling gently on the edge of her ear. As he squeezed her chest, pinching her peak between his thick fingers, Miran let out a muffled m0an that spilled into his mouth.</p>
<p>The onslaught of sensations was too much for her to handle. André’s lips, which had lightly sucked on the delicate skin below her ear, moved down to her neck, biting and nibbling as he descended. Then, with a long swipe of his tongue, he traced the dip of her collarbone.</p>
<p>Miran’s back arched instinctively. André supported her with one hand, burying his face in her chest. His breath was hot against her sensitive skin, and then he bit down on one mound.</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>The sensation, like she was being devoured alive, shocked her. She tried to push his head away, twisting her body in panic. In her mind, she could see his strong jaw crushing a piece of candy with a loud crunch.</p>
<p>André pried her hands away from his head, frowning. In what felt like a punishment, he bit down harder on her nipple. Miran’s body jerked, and she clung to his shoulders with a sharp cry.</p>
<p>“Haah…! Don’t, don’t bite me…”</p>
<p>The sharp, pleasure-tinged pain shot down her spine, tightening her lower abdomen. Her head barely touched the edge of the table when André laid her flat on top of it, removing his hand from her back.</p>
<p>Her skirt bunched up, revealing her spread legs, while his lower body pressed firmly between her thighs. The heat, the wetness seeping from her, running down her thighs and soaking her skirt—it was all too shameful.</p>
<p><em>Do people always show this much vulnerability when they have sex?</em></p>
<p>Miran’s legs trembled awkwardly below the table, splayed wide next to André’s.</p>
<p>André bent over her, almost engulfing her, and filled his hand with her mound. His fingers squeezed tightly, and with the tip of his tongue, he flicked at her nipple, all while locking eyes with her.</p>
<p>Miran, flushed a deep red, stifled the m0ans threatening to spill from her lips. The man who was usually composed, disciplined, and the picture of restraint, with impeccable manners—during sex, he became an elegant… beast. His green eyes, now heavy-lidded, smoldered like a deep, churning ocean. Then, without warning, his lips moved down to press a kiss to her belly button.</p>
<p>“Wh-what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Startled, Miran tried to sit up, but André pressed her back down, his hand spread flat against her chest, pinning her firmly.</p>
<p>“Stay down.”</p>
<p>He slipped his hand under her knees and lifted her legs effortlessly. As Miran struggled in vain, he planted a soft kiss on a bruise on her knee. The movement caused her skirt to ride up and bunch around her waist, which made her panic as she hastily tried to pull it down.</p>
<p>André’s head continued its slow descent. Kneeling on the floor, he kissed the inside of her thigh, nipping at the skin lightly as though tasting her, occasionally leaving a trail of bites and licking over the marks.</p>
<p>Miran groaned softly, gripping her skirt tightly in her hands. But André pressed down on her thigh, folding her leg in half, leaving her completely exposed.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Her hips lifted off the table, and she could feel the sensitive area between her legs parting slightly. She tried desperately to cover herself with her skirt, but as she tensed her thighs, a translucent fluid leaked out, spilling down her petals.</p>
<p>Seeing that, Miran’s pale face flushed a deep red in an instant. Defeated, she let go of her skirt and covered her face instead. Her cheeks felt like they were burning under her palms.</p>
<p>A low whistle, almost like a sigh of admiration, reached her ears. Even without looking, she could feel exactly where André’s gaze was fixed. Overwhelmed with shame and a dizzying rush of arousal, Miran felt her mind going blank.</p>
