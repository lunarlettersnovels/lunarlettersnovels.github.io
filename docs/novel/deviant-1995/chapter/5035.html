            <h3>Chapter 39.1</h3>
<p>The taxi slowly drove along the road with English road signs scattered here and there, and dropped the two people off in front of a large terracotta-colored building. The well-maintained garden featured elegant pine trees and a pavilion.</p>
<p>André, who paid the fare in dollars, got out of the taxi through the opposite door while Miran was gathering her bags, and warned her,</p>
<p>“Stay seated.”</p>
<p>He walked around to the other side, opened the car door, and extended his hand. He was obviously bothered that her legs had given out on him on the road earlier. But she was less shaky now, and being next to André had a calming effect on her.</p>
<p>“I’m okay now…”</p>
<p>But André didn’t withdraw his outstretched hand. Miran bit her lip and took his hand. His large hand enveloped her still-cold fingers.</p>
<p>As Miran got out of the taxi with André’s support, he placed his hand on her back and started walking. Miran looked around as she quietly asked,</p>
<p>“Where are we?”</p>
<p>“Dragon Valley Hotel.”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>André exchanged a natural nod with the staff at the information desk and silently gestured towards the elevator.</p>
<p>As soon as Miran entered the hotel lobby, she became so nervous that her limbs felt stiff.</p>
<p>‘It’s my first time coming to a hotel, and I’m even here with a man.’</p>
<p>She was worried that everyone would look at her the same way the taxi driver had. Although she wore a cardigan over her dress, she was still conscious of her short skirt and heavy makeup. To avoid drawing attention, she even tried to muffle the clicking sound of her high heels, walking a bit away from André.</p>
<p>Meeting André outside the rooftop room, Miran felt intimidated by his impeccable and sophisticated attire, as well as his elegant and refined demeanor. It was hard to believe that this was the same man who, just 20 minutes ago, had dislocated Director Jung Byungjin’s arm and kicked him in the chest with a fierce and savage look in his eyes.</p>
<p>As they walked towards the elevator, men in military uniforms passed by, giving her blatant stares. Miran’s head dropped to the floor as if she were a criminal. She felt both unjustly accused and sorry, worried that André might be misunderstood as a kind of man who associates with such women.</p>
<p>André, who had been walking a few steps away, muttered something in English and quickly closed the distance, wrapping his arm around Miran’s waist. Miran flinched. It was the first time he had shown such bold physical affection outside the rooftop room.</p>
<p>‘Well, it’s the first time we’re meeting outside.’</p>
<p>As the elevator doors opened, a young officer stepped out and exchanged greetings with André. Then he stopped and turned around. The man’s curious gaze blatantly fixed on Miran, prompting André to release his arm from her waist and shield her behind him while firmly pressing the elevator close button.</p>
<p>The room André was staying in was a deluxe suite on a high floor, complete with a living room in the corner. He took out a card that looked like a credit card from his wallet and inserted it into the handle. A green light came on, and the door opened with a mechanical sound.</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>Miran, who had never seen a key card before, exclaimed in awe. André, holding the heavy door wide open, gestured for her to enter first. With curious eyes shining, Miran scurried into the room and exclaimed once more.</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>Through the large window, the Yo<br>
ngsan area and the spiky Namsan Tower came into full view.</p>
<p>“Sit.”</p>
<p>André pointed to the sofa. Miran, who had been looking around, obediently sat down on the sofa. He then took a bottle of water from a small refrigerator that looked like it had been cut in half. It was only then that Miran realized she hadn’t had a sip of water since morning.</p>
<p>André poured the water into a glass and handed it to her. Thirsty, Miran emptied the glass in one go.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I guess I was really thirsty since I hadn’t had any water all day.”</p>
<p>Miran smiled sheepishly at André and placed the glass on the table. He frowned and asked,</p>
<p>“…Have you eaten?”</p>
<p>“I had breakfast at home before I left.”</p>
