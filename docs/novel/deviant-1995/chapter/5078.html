            <p><strong>Chapter 17.2</strong></p>
<p>A brief silence followed.</p>
<p>[Ahh. So, he gets h0rny just looking at her. Got it.]</p>
<p>André lazily lowered his eyes and muttered in English.</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Continue.”</p>
<p>Miran looked at him suspiciously before turning her gaze back to the script.</p>
<p>“The next scene is where Chorong takes off her clothes. After she undresses, Park Doosik uses his hand here, like this…”</p>
<p>Miran awkwardly held onto André’s shirt cuff and lifted his hand. His hand, with prominent blue veins bulging, was large enough to grip a basketball with one hand.</p>
<p>She brought André’s hand close to her chest, almost touching, then quickly returned it to its original position. She flapped her hands and fanned her face. Her ears felt hot. When she lowered her head, she could see the blush spreading to her cleavage. She was too embarrassed to lift her head.</p>
<p>‘I am an actress. I am Chorong.’</p>
<p>Miran mentally repeated these words as if hypnotizing herself, forcing her voice out.</p>
<p>“The next scene is where Park Doosik lifts Chorong and, um, places his face on her chest…”</p>
<p>She fidgeted as she stood up from her chair and positioned herself in front of André. With trembling hands, she gently cupped his face. She could feel the sculpted contours of his face in her palm.</p>
<p>André’s gaze slowly rose. As soon as their eyes met, Miran averted her eyes sideways. Taking a deep breath and holding it, she pulled his face towards her chest. His sharp nose stopped just short of touching her clea.v@ge.</p>
<p>She heard André sharply inhale. Miran bit her lip, worried that he might hear her heart pounding like a drum in a battlefield. After counting to three, she slowly pushed his face away and dropped her hands.</p>
<p>In the small rooftop room, even the refrigerator motor seemed to hold its breath. The sound of someone swallowing echoed, and André placed a hand on his forehead. He spoke roughly, his voice slightly cracked.</p>
<p>“Okay, next.”</p>
<p>“Park Doosik puts his hand between Chorong’s, um, legs—”</p>
<p>Before she could finish her sentence, André brought his hand close to Miran’s thigh, palm facing forward, then immediately withdrew it. Miran sighed in relief. She was grateful that he was a rare gentleman.</p>
<p>“The next scene is where Chorong clings to Park Doosik’s shoulder. May I touch your shoulder for a moment?”</p>
<p>André nodded in response. Miran lightly placed her hands on his shoulders. She could feel the muscles surrounding his sturdy collarbone under her palms, which quickly tensed up. She wrapped her arms around his neck and pretended to collapse slightly, then quickly pulled away.</p>
<p>Miran placed the script on the table and explained the next scene.</p>
<p>“And then… Park Doosik from behind Chorong—”</p>
<p>As she spoke, André grabbed Miran’s waist and swiftly turned her around. Startled, Miran tried to look back, but André placed his palm on her back and gently pressed. Though it didn’t seem like he used much force, her upper body bent over the table without resistance.</p>
<p>“Uh…?”</p>
<p>When André pressed her back all the way down, Miran ended up lying face down on the table with her stomach against it.</p>
<p>“Is this it?”</p>
<p>“What? Oh, yes. It is, but just a moment—”</p>
<p>As the flustered Miran struggled to get up, André pushed his chair back with a scrape and stood up. He grabbed her waist with both hands and stood close behind her. Although his lower body didn’t make direct contact, his grip on her waist was firmer than before.</p>
<p>“I get it up to here. Next.”</p>
<p>A low, blunt voice behind her urged roughly.</p>
<p>“Ow, it hurts!”</p>
<p>“It hurts?”</p>
<p>André immediately released his hands from Miran’s waist. She glanced back at him. There was a flicker of confusion in his eyes. So, he can have that kind of expression too.</p>
<p>Miran shook her head at André.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t hurt. That’s Chorong’s line. ‘Ah. It hurts, boss, please spare me.’”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Now, you need to grab my hair from behind and pull me up.”</p>
<p>Miran turned her head forward and neatly gathered her hair back to make it easier to grab. She waited in that position for a while, but there was no movement from behind. Just as she was about to look back, André gently grabbed her shoulder instead of her hair and pulled her up softly.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say we did it.”</p>
