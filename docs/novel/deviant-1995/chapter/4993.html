            <p><strong>Chapter 60.1</strong></p>
<p>Even so, he hated unnecessary small talk. André cut through the extraneous details and got straight to the point.</p>
<p>[So. What’s the way to get Collins Company on my side—]</p>
<p>— André.</p>
<p>Lorraine interrupted him.</p>
<p>— I can’t say it over the phone. Let’s meet and talk.</p>
<p>He frowned and let out a short sigh. Since Lorraine Cabot held the knife, he had no choice but to comply, even if he didn’t want to. He said curtly.</p>
<p>[Date and time.]</p>
<p>— How about November 3rd at 7? Let’s have dinner. Meet me at Tribeca Grill downtown.</p>
<p>[Downtown? Why not just our hotel restaurant—]</p>
<p>— Do you want to advertise that Collins is stabbing Lowell in the back and conspiring with Lafayette? Your hotel restaurant is out of the question. Meet me downtown.</p>
<p>It was a valid point.</p>
<p>[Alright, at Tribeca Grill. November 3rd.]</p>
<p>— Okay. See you then, André.</p>
<p>After hanging up the phone, André folded Miran’s letter, put it in his desk drawer, and slammed it shut.</p>
<p>His head was throbbing. There was so much to do. He felt like he was sinking into a swamp up to his waist, crushed by the weight of the things he carried on his shoulders. But these were things that had been placed on his shoulders since birth anyway. There was nothing new about it now.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders.</p>
<p>He could do it.</p>
<p>He had to.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>After traveling all the way from Yongin to Gangnam to meet up with Jieun, Miran caught up with her over a hearty serving of snacks and beer.</p>
<p>“Are you really not going to audition this time? Don’t do that, let’s go see it together, huh? He’s a director on a different level than bastards like Jung Byungjin. He’s rumored to have studied abroad and have good manners—”</p>
<p>Miran gently cut off Jieun’s words. She had realized something thanks to André.</p>
<p>“Unni, I told you I’m quitting acting. The entertainment industry doesn’t seem to suit me. And more than anything, I don’t have the talent for it.”</p>
<p>Jieun, with a look of regret, stubbed out her cigarette in the ashtray and gulped down her draft beer in one go, as if she felt suffocated. As soon as she put the empty glass on the table, Miran picked up the pitcher and filled the glass to the brim.</p>
<p>White beer foam rose roundly above the glass. Jieun slurped up the foam and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand before slamming the table.</p>
<p>“Hey! Are there only one or two people in this industry who can’t act? Even great actors, world stars, were terrible at acting when they were rookies! Everyone learns as they go. I don’t have talent either, you know that.”</p>
<p>“But you have a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Miran chewed on the dried squid calmly, replying with a carefree expression.</p>
<p>Jieun’s face, which had paused, contorted subtly into a bewildered expression. Then Miran chuckled, clinked her glass against Jieun’s, and drank her beer.</p>
<p>“Ma Jieun, why are you so scared! Relax your face, you orange. Who cares if you have a lot of money? I like that my best friend is rich. Thanks to you, I get to eat a lot of delicious food and go to a lot of fun places. I’ve probably spent half of your allowance over the years, right? But you’ve never once flaunted it to me. You know that’s even cooler, right? Maybe it’s because you’re rich in heart too.”</p>
<p>Only then did Jieun expression thaw and she glared at Miran.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you suddenly praising me too much? It’s scary. Just don’t suddenly throw me down.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? I’m sincerely grateful to you! Well, sometimes I’m envious, and sometimes I feel sorry. So I also think that someday I want to become someone who can help you. But maybe it’s because I’m the youngest, I like being spoiled.”</p>
<p>Miran grinned and slipped a piece of fried dried squid into Jieun’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Eat a lot, my pushover.”</p>
<p>Then Jieun chuckled and chewed the fried dried squid heartily.</p>
<p>“Should we order sausage and vegetables?”</p>
<p>“Sausage and vegetables are good. Excuse me!”</p>
<p>Miran waved the menu at the employee. Then Jieun lit a cigarette again and asked.</p>
<p>“So, have you thought about what you’re going to do in the future besides acting?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ve been racking my brain about that lately.”</p>
<p>“Why, because of studying? Did you finally decide to take the Level 7 civil service exam?”</p>
<p>Miran waved her hand dismissively.</p>
<p>“How many smart people are there in the world? Even if I studied constitutions or administrative law, which I’ve never even looked at in my life, how would I pass? It would be difficult even if I tried again and again. Even though I’m not exactly a bad student, I’m pretty good at understanding my place.”</p>
<p>“Constitution and administrative law? Wow, really doesn’t suit you.”</p>
<p>Miran glared at Jieun, who was giggling, and she quickly changed the subject.</p>
