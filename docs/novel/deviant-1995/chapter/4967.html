            <p><strong>Chapter 73.1</strong></p>
<p>‘Andre is going to take me home.’</p>
<p>Miran didn’t want to show just how happy she was, so she bit her bottom lip hard. As a result, her upper lip curled up, exposing her gums.</p>
<p>But, it’s only polite to refuse at least once, right?</p>
<p>She covered her smiling mouth and looked up at him. She didn’t realize that her eyes were already squinting like a shrimp’s back.</p>
<p>“No, I mean, isn’t it a hassle for you to go out of your way just because of me?”</p>
<p>“…Sit down.”</p>
<p>His voice was definitely commanding, but this time there was a much kinder undertone. A faint smile seemed to spread across his eyes as he looked down at her, and then he lightly tugged at the hand that was covering her mouth.</p>
<p>Miran bit her lip again and sat back down. Her face burned, and the hand that Andre had grabbed felt like it was tingling, as if it had been shocked.</p>
<p>Seunghyuk, watching them with an expression of mild exasperation, waved goodbye to Miran.</p>
<p>“Well then, see you next time.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Oppa. See you.”</p>
<p>Miran’s face turned even redder as she smiled awkwardly, waving her hand just slightly.</p>
<p>The two men only nodded at each other, exchanging a brief acknowledgment, but there were no parting words or empty pleasantries.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Andre led Miran out of the dining hall, and after briefly exchanging words with the butler they had encountered in the gallery, he walked toward the opposite corridor.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?”</p>
<p>“My room.”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>At the mention of Higgins still having dinner, Andre had instructed that he would wait in his room and asked for tea and some light refreshments to be brought to him.</p>
<p>“I have to wait until your ride is ready.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Miran nodded and followed him, counting the number of doors along the corridor, but she was so overwhelmed that she gave up. The Dragon Valley Hotel’s hallway had this many doors too.</p>
<p>The carpeted corridor absorbed the sound of their footsteps, and the silence enveloped them. Living in such a large house, she thought, it must be possible for even family members to go without seeing each other.</p>
<p>She had heard he was an only child, but wouldn’t that be lonely?</p>
<p>Miran glanced up at him.</p>
<p>“Are your parents here too?”</p>
<p>Andre, taking a few more steps without saying anything, shook his head.</p>
<p>“My mother passed away, and my father is in Paris right now.”</p>
<p>His tone was dry, as if he were giving the news of a distant relative’s well-being, without much emotion. Silence followed.</p>
<p>‘Maybe he’s not very close to his parents?’</p>
<p>Miran clapped her hands and changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Ah, right! Andre, are you a noble? Seunghyuk Oppa said that if ‘de’ is attached to your last name—”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Andre cut her off before she could finish, answering briefly. Miran’s mouth dropped open.</p>
<p>“Then, do you, like, have a title or something?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Whoa. Really? What is it?”</p>
<p>“Count. If I inherit the title, I’ll become a Marquis.”</p>
<p>Miran looked up at him, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Is there something else you’re curious about?”</p>
<p>“Did your ancestors really save the country?”</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I told you they did.”</p>
<p>He answered briefly, as always, without any further explanation.</p>
<p>‘Still, at least he answered.’</p>
<p>In Korea, people often avoid giving a direct answer and change the subject altogether. But then Miran thought that even if Andre had answered, she might not have believed him.</p>
<p>‘With nobility and all that, I probably would have thought he was a scammer. It’s hard to imagine or believe in things like that unless you see them with your own eyes.’</p>
<p>Miran tilted her head and looked up at him again.</p>
<p>“What now?”</p>
<p>“…I’ve only seen nobility in books or movies. This is the first time I’m meeting one in real life.”</p>
<p>Andre chuckled softly.</p>
<p>“So? What’s your impression?”</p>
<p>Miran, who had been gnawing on her lower lip, lifted her eyes slightly and shyly smiled.</p>
<p>“You’re handsome.”</p>
<p>Andre scoffed lightly and opened the door at the end of the corridor, ushering her inside.</p>
<p>The living room had a masculine and elegant feel to it. There was a door on each side of the room, to the right and left, and in the center, around a large fireplace, there were heavy leather sofas and a coffee table.</p>
<p>“Wow! Is that fireplace real? Ahhh—”</p>
<p>As soon as the door to the living room closed behind them, Andre suddenly spun Miran around. He wrapped his arm around her neck and tilted his head as he leaned in.</p>
<p>Startled, Miran didn’t even have time to close her eyes. Her eyelashes fluttered as she felt his lips about to touch hers. Before she could react, his tongue slipped into her parted lips, and he kissed her hungrily.</p>
