            <h3>Chapter 35.1</h3>
<p>Miran wrapped her arms around his neck, showering small kisses along his jawline. When André lifted her chin, she lowered her gaze and smiled shyly. As he gazed at her intently, she briefly met his eyes before burying her flushed face against his shoulder, as if to hide her embarrassment.</p>
<p>The mischievous nymph of the forest was tempting him again, this time with the face of a seductress.</p>
<p>‘Was I always so weak to a pretty face?’</p>
<p>It wasn’t as if he’d never been tempted by beauty before.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t quite grasp why he was so easily swayed by Miran alone.</p>
<p>“…I’ll think about it. No promises,” he muttered before lifting her face once more, pressing his lips against her soft, parted ones.</p>
<p>It was well past midnight when André finally left the rooftop room. Miran had fallen asleep in his arms. A piece of paper with her pager number and the filming location address rested in his jacket pocket.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Miran arrived at the filming site early in the morning. She was in a small karaoke room, designated as the waiting area for actors, where she had her makeup done. Afterward, she changed into the outfit provided by the wardrobe supervisor and awkwardly taped pads and nude-colored tape between her legs for a “cover-up.”</p>
<p>It was a humiliating moment.</p>
<p>It finally hit her—this was really happening. Her fingertips grew cold as a tremor, starting deep within her, spread through her limbs.</p>
<p>Hyuna, sensing Miran might change her mind and flee, watched her anxiously. Though it wasn’t her usual demeanor, Hyuna stayed by Miran’s side, gently comforting her.</p>
<p>“The space is cramped, and the scene is a bit sensitive, so they said we’re filming with a minimum crew. So don’t worry too much. Let’s nail this performance in one take so we won’t have to redo it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, unni.”</p>
<p>“We’ve come this far. We have to make it big, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>Miran answered half-heartedly, still clutching her pager. Last night, she had begged André to page her when he arrived at the filming site, though she wasn’t sure if he would come. She had already asked Assistant Director Seongho for permission, explaining that her manager might show up.</p>
<p>Seongho had sneered when he heard her request.</p>
<p>“These days, everyone thinks they’re a big-shot actor, bringing managers to set and whatnot. Sure, do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>The image of André from last night, saying “farewell” as he left, kept replaying in Miran’s mind. It felt as if he was leaving for good, and the thought made her heart sink. Desperately, she’d thrown her pride aside, begging him not to go.</p>
<p>It was too good to be true.</p>
<p>From his expression, she could never tell what was going through his mind. The only time he revealed even a glimpse of himself was when they shared pleasure in bed.</p>
<p>When André gazed at her with half-lidded eyes, overcome with pleasure, as if he could devour her whole, it sent shivers down her spine. Though he was usually so stoic and unemotional, when he held her with a lover’s passionate gaze, her resolve melted away like soft-serve ice cream under the scorching summer sun.</p>
<p>It bothered her a bit that they had come to know each other’s bodies before their hearts. Still, the fact that André came to visit her every night at the rooftop room seemed to suggest he had feelings for her, too.</p>
<p>Yet, he was always so reserved with his words.</p>
<p>What rank did he hold in the military? How long had he been in Korea? Where did his family live? And how could Miran reach him if she wanted to?</p>
<p>There were so many things she wanted to know, but all she knew about him was his name: André. If he didn’t come to see her, there was no way for her to meet him.</p>
<p><em>What if I never see him again?</em></p>
<p>Just then, the assistant director’s voice boomed as he pounded on the waiting room door.</p>
<p>“Rehearsal’s starting!”</p>
<p>Miran, who had been anxiously staring at her pager, let out a small sigh and stood up. At that moment, she felt a vibration in her palm. Quickly, she checked the pager. A number she didn’t recognize was displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>“Hyuna unni! I’m really sorry, but could I borrow your cell phone just once? It’s urgent.”</p>
<p>Stopping Hyuna, who was about to leave, Miran made her request. Though Hyuna’s expression was reluctant, she dug through her handbag and handed over her phone. Miran bowed in gratitude, took the phone, and checked the voice message.</p>
<p>— “Arriving at four. Can’t stay long.”</p>
<p>That was it. No greeting, no name. But it was enough.</p>
