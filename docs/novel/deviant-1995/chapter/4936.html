            <p><strong>Chapter 88.2</strong></p>
<p>Seunghyuk, usually so calm and laid-back, now spoke with the excitement of a boy. His passion for filmmaking shone in his eyes. Miran found it both admirable and a little enviable.</p>
<p>Seunghyuk paused for a moment, then he spoke with a calm tone but cautious expression.</p>
<p>“Just to let you know in advance, Michelle has one nude scene. It’s in the main character’s imagination, a solo shot: half-body from the front, full nudity from the back. The cinematographer’s a woman, and we’ll use a soft-focus filter for a dreamy effect. And during the filming, only she and I will be on set.”</p>
<p>He rattled the details methodically.</p>
<p>Miran listened silently. Seunghyuk tapped his temple, and as if he came up with something, he offered one last condition.</p>
<p>“It’s a low-budget indie, so the pay won’t be much, but it’ll meet Screen Actors Guild standards. You don’t have to decide right away. Read the script and think it over. Hyunjung mentioned that you’re coming to her birthday party too, so you can let me know then.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk finished his coffee and playfully smiled.</p>
<p>“Ah… Don’t feel too pressured, Kang Michelle.”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>When she arrived at the apartment, Miran sat on the living room sofa, and pulled out the script Seunghyuk gave her. She had no intention of returning to acting and was set on becoming a flight attendant. But…</p>
<p>Maybe it was okay to put a period on her past dream. To say, “It was fun, goodbye,” with a smile?</p>
<p>Miran suddenly felt a lump in her throat. She bit her lip and lowered her head. It wasn’t that she had lingering attachment. But somewhere deep inside, the defeat of giving up her dream had left a wound she hadn’t even realized was there.</p>
<p>It was all in the past and she wanted to forget them, but sometimes Director Jung Byungjin’s cruel words would echo in her mind:</p>
<p>“Why the hell did I pick someone like you when your acting isn’t even worth sh*t?”</p>
<p>“Is your brain that slow? Did I tell you to act? All you have to do is just st#r!p and cry. And you can’t even do that?”</p>
<p>“I’ll make sure you never set foot in Chungmuro again! If I see you one more time, I’ll strip you n@.ked and—”</p>
<p>Miran squeezed her eyes shut and shook her head.</p>
<p>Even now, the memory made her shiver and give her goosebumps. If André hadn’t pulled her off that set, she might’ve lived broken her entire life.</p>
<p>“A teenage boy’s first love, muse, heroine. Now, I can’t imagine anyone else playing that role but you.”</p>
<p>Miran sighed. She’d dreamed of becoming an actress that would inspire directors. But she never expected the chance to come after she quit acting.</p>
<p>Seunghyuk might’ve said it to persuade her since he urgently needed an actress for the role of Michelle, but whether true or not, it soothed the wounds from Jung Byungjin albeit a little.</p>
<p>The nude scene felt different, too. Seunghyuk was known for unique and sensuous directing even in their university circle days. Plus, since it was a short for a film festival, not a commercial release for the general audience, she actually felt more at ease.</p>
<p>She thought that it wouldn’t be a bad idea to take this opportunity to wash away the filth Jung Byungjin had dumped on her dream.</p>
<p>She knew André would disapprove if she told him she was acting in Seunghyuk’s film. But the fact that he left behind $10,000, muttering about “lost opportunities,” suggested he felt at least some responsibility for her quitting. So, it was worth trying to persuade him.</p>
<p>Miran checked her watch and it was 6 p.m. It was probably 7 in Korea, it was the time for Juran to get up and get ready for work.</p>
<p>Miran sat by the living room phone and pulled a calling card from her wallet. She dialled the access number then her home number, and the line began to ring.</p>
<p>Once a week, Miran would call Juran and she cherished that tender moment. Soon, that familiar, beloved voice would answer with, “Miran-ah, is that you?”</p>
<p>But even after several rings, no one picked up. Miran frowned and tilted her head.</p>
<p>‘Did she already leave for work? That can’t be…’</p>
