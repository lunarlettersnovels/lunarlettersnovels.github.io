            <p><strong>Chapter 78.2</strong></p>
<p>He could feel Miran’s heartbeat against his bare chest as she lay collapsed on him. His own heart also raced wildly. Now, he was really at his limit.</p>
<p>Andre wrapped his arms around her head and waist, shifting their positions again.</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>Miran, suddenly pinned beneath him, let out a soft whimper as she felt his weight.</p>
<p>Andre pulled out gently until only the t!`p remained, then thr#$t back in forcefully, grazing her c3r-v!x and filling the space just before it. Her soft b*tt0c!k.s pressed flat against his firm thighs.</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as if they might pop out by the sudden pressure. Unable to make a sound, her slender body writhed beneath him.</p>
<p>His p#n!`s, buried completely in her hot, soft fl3-s.h, throbbed violently.</p>
<p>“Kuh.”</p>
<p>Andre’s brow furrowed. He couldn’t name the emotion he was feeling right now. He hugged her tightly, as if to crush her. Fragmented words floated through his pl.€asur3-hazed mind.</p>
<p>Mine. Always. Forever.</p>
<p>Miran pursed her lips and she wrapped her arms around his shoulders.</p>
<p>“…Andre! Please, slow down…”</p>
<p>She whispered and pleaded in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>Andre pulled back until just the t!`p rested at her entr@nc!3. The air hit his p#n!s glistening with sl<em>`ck felt cool before he pl</em>ng3d back into her w@rm fl3s.h.</p>
<p>He rolled his hips, grinding against her !nn3r f0!ds. He kept pushing until the t!`p pressed firmly against the entr@nc!3 to her w*m.b, filling her completely until her lower abdomen bu.lg3d slightly in the shape of his p#n!`s.</p>
<p>Miran thrashed, clawing at his shoulders without a sound. Andre’s shoulders shuddered and he lifted his chin.</p>
<p>“…Fuck.”</p>
<p>He looked down at her writhing beneath him.</p>
<p>Was it a sedative? No, an aphr0d!si@c.</p>
<p>A fleeting fear crossed his mind that Miran might be more dangerous to him than he thought.</p>
<p>Andre scraped against her !nn3r f0ld`s, pulling his hips at a fast pace. Then he took a deep breath for a moment and then slowly thr#$t in again. After repeating this several times, sweat dripped from his sharp nose. The muscles of his entire body tensed up, burning with the intensity.</p>
<p>An unprecedented wave of pl.€asur3 was about to explode. His vision turned bright red.</p>
<p>Miran trembled like an aspen tree, shivering uncontrollably, and scratching at his sweat-soaked shoulders.</p>
<p>“Ha- hic, Andre! Hurry, please, now…”</p>
<p>Her fingers curled and uncurled, her pupils were unfocused at a loss for what to do as she finally hit his shoulder with her fist and sobbed.</p>
<p>She was all over the place.</p>
<p>But Miran, flushed and writhing in pl.€asur3, was so beautiful that he wanted to indulge her every whim.</p>
<p>Grinning like a madman with his teeth bared, Andre cupped the top of her head and thr#$t fully into her again. He kissed her gasping lips, and when he thr#$t once more, her hips jolted upward.</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>He swallowed her m*@ns. It was a moment when all reason vanished.</p>
<p>Andre began to thr#$ting rapidly, p0un.d!ng into her like a beast in heat. He pinned her down, holding her obsessively.</p>
<p>Each thr#$t made her b<em>tt0c!k.s and his thighs were covered in wh!t3, st!cky fl</em>.!d that made a sq*3l-ch!ng sound. Their sweat mingled, their breaths tangled as their lips touched, and their body heat melted into one.</p>
<p>When Andre pulled back, gasping for air, Miran clung to him desperately, whispering between pants.</p>
<p>“I love you, Andre. Ah- hic!”</p>
<p>She arched her back, pressing her head into the bed. Her !nn3r w@lls clamped down with terrifying force.</p>
<p>At that moment, Andre de Lafayette shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>“Hngh!”</p>
<p>An intense and painful pl.€asur3 surged through his skull as a long, intense release followed. Each time her w@ll.s squeezed, he stiffened, sh0ot!.ng his s3m#n deep inside her.</p>
<p>Only after emptying himself completely did he stop thr#$ting and collapse on top of her.</p>
<p>“Hic…”</p>
<p>Miran, trembling in his arms, burst into tears again.</p>
<p>Andre snapped back to reality. He realized he’d lost control, ravag!n.g her like a mad dog in heat without considering the difference in their physiques. He slightly propped himself up and checked on her, asking.</p>
<p>“Are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?”</p>
<p>His own voice, thick with worry, sounded foreign to him.</p>
