            <p><strong>Chapter 23.2</strong></p>
<p>It was strange how she felt compelled to obey him, almost as if she were under some kind of hypnosis.</p>
<p>‘Is he using some kind of hypnosis?’</p>
<p>Sniffling and pouting, Miran reluctantly brought her legs together. André then grabbed her ankles and lifted her legs over one of his shoulders, raising her hips off the bed.</p>
<p>“W-what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Without answering, André grabbed Miran’s hips and pulled her towards his lower body. When one of her legs slipped off his shoulder, he clicked his tongue and lifted it back up.</p>
<p>“Tighten your thighs.”</p>
<p>Miran looked up at him with anxious eyes and tightened her thighs. André then grasped his p3n!s with one hand and rubbed the tip along the length of her p4nt!es.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>As the lingering pleasure spread warmly, she twitched in surprise.</p>
<p>“Stay still.”</p>
<p>André spread his hand wide and grabbed both of Miran’s knees, securing them on his shoulder. Then, with a <a href="https://th.ru/">th.ru</a>5t of his hips, he moved forward.</p>
<p>His glistening p3n!s suddenly emerged between her slender thighs. As he slowly pulled back, the p3n!s, which had disappeared between her thighs, reappeared with a wet sound.</p>
<p>Miran couldn’t take her eyes off the sight. The thick shaft, with its engorged, blunt head and prominent veins, pushed through the gap between her closed thighs. A bead of translucent fl.u!d formed at the tip and dripped onto her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>Each time his p3n!s moved in and out, it brushed against the front of her p4nt!es. The repeated sensation made her instinctively tense her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>It felt strange. André was moving as if they were having s3x. With each <a href="https://th.ru/">th.ru</a>5t of his hips, Miran’s body rocked in response. Her gaze, which had been wandering around the ceiling, lowered and settled on the wall mirror hanging over André’s shoulder.</p>
<p>On the stainless steel shelf attached to the square mirror were a large can of hairspray and a roll brush. Miran’s eyes, which had been fixed on the spray can, slid down to glance at the p3n!s moving between her thighs. She licked her dry lips.</p>
<p>Is it really that big?</p>
<p>“Your hand.”</p>
<p>Startled by André’s voice, Miran looked up. Caught openly observing his member, she blushed. Biting her lip, she averted her gaze and extended her hand. André took her hand and guided it to wrap around the shaft of his p3n!s.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Miran bit her lower lip and held her breath, her eyes wide open. It was her first time seeing a man’s intimate part up close and touching it directly. The p3n!s, slick with her fl.u!ds, felt much softer and hotter than she had imagined. André placed his hand over hers, applying gentle pressure.</p>
<p>“Focus.”</p>
<p>As Miran swallowed nervously and wiggled her fingers, the steel-like core hidden beneath the soft skin throbbed and grew larger. Startled, she opened her mouth. Instinctively, she tried to pull her hand away, but his large hand held it firmly in place.</p>
<p>When he pulled his hips back, her hand felt empty, only to be filled again with a firm <a href="https://th.ru/">th.ru</a>5t, making a wet sound. Slick fl.u!ds seeped between her slender fingers. André, his brow slightly furrowed, began <a href="https://th.ru/">th.ru</a>5ting harder and faster than before.</p>
<p>“Ahhk!”</p>
<p>Miran arched her back and twisted her hips, her buttocks lifting off the bed. As André’s p3n!s brushed against her p4nt!es, that tingling, chilling sensation hit her again. She didn’t think she could handle that feeling twice in one night. Desperately, she tried to push him away as she raised herself.</p>
<p>“Ah, stop! I can’t—”</p>
<p>“Stay still.”</p>
<p>André’s grip on her knees tightened. Each time his thighs collided with her buttocks, a sharp, slapping sound echoed. His thigh muscles bulged, straining against his pants.</p>
<p>André’s face, with his intense gaze and lower lip bitten hard, no longer looked restrained. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. His shoulder, touching Miran’s leg, felt hot and slick. Then, André pulled his hips back in a long motion and th.ru5t forward with a loud smack.</p>
