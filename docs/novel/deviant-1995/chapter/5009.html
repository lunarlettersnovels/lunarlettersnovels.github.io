            <p><strong>Chapter 52.1</strong></p>
<p>Miran began kissing his face indiscriminately. Making smacking sounds, she moved from his chin to his cheeks, then rubbed her lips against his ear, panting. Andre’s shoulders shook with silent laughter before he slightly turned his head to look down at her.</p>
<p>Seizing the opportunity, Miran cupped his face with both hands and pressed her lips against his.</p>
<p>Their cold, wet lips collided clumsily and melded softly together. She imitated Andre’s kissing style, extending her tongue to lick between his closed lips. As soon as his lips parted slightly, she slipped her tongue inside. After entering boldly, her shy tongue tip hesitantly flicked against his.</p>
<p>At that teasing touch, Andre let out a beast-like growl. When Miran gathered her courage and awkwardly explored his palate, he dipped his head deeply and sucked on her soft tongue as if he would devour it. His breathing quickly became rough as he drank in her m0@ns.</p>
<p>His thick tongue finally invaded her mouth, unable to hold back any longer, thoroughly exploring her sweet membrane. Her limbs went completely limp.</p>
<p>Breaking the kiss, Andre adjusted his hold on her and began walking. Miran rested her face between his shoulder and neck, wrapping her legs around his waist. Then she moved her lips to clumsily suck on his neck.</p>
<p>When she acted bolder than usual, Andre’s lower body responded instantly like gasoline meeting a match. His hardened length prodded between her spread legs.</p>
<p>Andre couldn’t make it out of the stream. Unable to wait the few steps to the camping car, he laid Miran down at an angle on a large rock. It seemed absurd that they were about to mate like animals on a rock. But if he didn’t take her now, it felt like his heated brain would leak out into the cold ravine.</p>
<p>The chilling fear when he thought Miran had fallen in, the relief when she reappeared, and the draining sensation as if all blood had left his body – all these mixed chaotically with his primal urges.</p>
<p>His corneas burned as overheated desire pushed him to his limit. He had to have her—right here, right now.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The milky moon hung low, a perfect circle against a jet-black sky sprinkled with glitter. Looking directly at the moon, its surface patterns clearly visible, was a dazzling sight. Miran blinked her moiste eyes.</p>
<p>Right beneath the sky stood Andre. Breathing heavily, he tore off the shirt clinging to him, gathered it into a ball and threw it away. The wet clothes landed on the gravel with a splat.</p>
<p>With chattering teeth, he grabbed the hem of Miran’s T-shirt and pulled it up over her head along with her bra. Soon her clothes were also sprawled on the gravel. After removing the wet clothes, she actually felt less cold. Miran covered her breasts with her forearms and nervously looked around.</p>
<p>Andre untied the drawstring of her pants, then slipped his fingers inside her waistband and pulled down both pants and underwear halfway. She grabbed his forearm and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Andre, what if someone sees us…”</p>
<p>“We’re the only ones here.”</p>
<p>Miran hesitated. It was the first time Andre had used ‘we’ to refer to them both. That ordinary word made her heart tingle. Releasing his forearm, Miran wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him closer.</p>
<p>Sensing her silent permission, Andre stripped off her pants and undergarments, tossing them away without looking back. His large hands cradled the back of her head as he ran his hands over her immaculate naked body, which reflected the moonlight, and he dug his lips into hers like a starving man.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, he unzipped his pants and pulled out his erect p3n!s. After stroking the sh4ft a few times, his rock-hard p3n!s throbbed and grew even larger. Breaking the kiss, Andre let out a sigh and pressed his body against Miran without leaving any gap.</p>
<p>Miran, her eyelids trembling, familiarly accepted Andre’s heavy weight, the feel of his bare skin pressing against hers, the heat of his body. Before he could pull away, she opened her legs wide, wrapping her long legs around his waist and bucking her hips against his throbbing center. Then he let out a low, throaty groan.</p>
