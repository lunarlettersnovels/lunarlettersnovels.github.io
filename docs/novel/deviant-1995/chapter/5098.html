            <p><strong>Chapter 7.2</strong></p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re not exactly quick on the uptake. You’re surprisingly naive too.”</p>
<p>Hyuna continued, “Taking off your clothes is hard only at first. Once you start filming, it’s not that different. It’s like se!x—hard the first time, but not a big deal after that. You had a boyfriend, so you know what I mean, right?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Y-yes…”</p>
<p>Miran mumbled, flustered. Hyuna narrowed her eyes and scrutinized her.</p>
<p>“You, no way… Don’t tell me… you’re still a virgin?”</p>
<p>Seeing Miran unable to answer, Hyuna scoffed in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Well, this is a surprise. Are you saving yourself for marriage or something? You look all se!xy and liberated, but you’re still stuck in the Joseon Dynasty.”</p>
<p>“That’s not it—”</p>
<p>“Miran, se!x? It’s not a big deal once you do it. Men can sleep around as much as they want without any consequences, so why can’t we? Women can have se!x for fun too. Having se!x doesn’t make you dirty, it doesn’t make you a slu!t, and it doesn’t mean you can’t get married. It’s almost the 21st century; being obsessed with v!rg!nity is abnormal for both men and women. You should never date a perverted guy who holds such standards!”</p>
<p>Although Hyuna’s words were a bit extreme, Miran knew she was right.</p>
<p>Her older sister had always warned her to be careful, as if the world would end if she slept with someone before marriage. But nowadays, se!x was a matter of choice. Miran had almost had se!x with her boyfriend once, but she just couldn’t go through with it in the end.</p>
<p>“That’s not it. I just haven’t found someone I liked enough to do it.”</p>
<p>“You’re giving it too much significance. It’s the result of constantly being brainwashed into thinking that ‘first experience and virginity’ matters. If you’ve never done it and feel uncomfortable about undressing in front of the camera, think of it as a rehearsal and just do it with a guy you like! Se!x isn’t such a big deal.”</p>
<p>Miran shook her head with a bitter expression after a moment of silence.</p>
<p>“Unni, no matter how much I think about it, this movie—”</p>
<p>“Miran, please. There’s only a week left until the shoot, so don’t say you can’t do it right now. Just think about it for a few more days. They say it’s a necessary scene for the film. They promised to shoot it artistically. The director, Jung Byungjin, is one of the hottest directors in Chungmuro right now. Doing this won’t be a shame but a career boost. With this on your resume, you can aim for supporting roles in the next auditions, not just minor ones.”</p>
<p>Hyuna pleaded desperately.</p>
<p>“Did you hear what Jung Byungjin said earlier? He told me to make sure to bring you, but if you back out, his sh!tty temper might cost me my role, too. He might just decide to hire an er0tic film actress instead, which is cheaper and convenient. Why should I suffer because of this? I gave you a chance out of goodwill, and now I might lose my chance because of you!”</p>
<p>Hyuna, who had been raising her voice, eventually burst into tears. She turned her head and wiped her tears with her fingers, her face contorting miserably. Miran felt guilty, even though she hadn’t done anything wrong.</p>
<p>Remembering the way the director treated Hyuna and the rumors she had heard from Seunghyuk about her bad reputation, she could vaguely guess what Hyuna had to endure to get this role. It made sense why she was so desperate.</p>
<p>“I’ll think about it.”</p>
<p>When Miran reluctantly answered, Hyuna closed her eyes and let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Miran. Please let me know by Monday. The shoot is in a week. You know the location, right?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Miran’s answer sank heavily, as if a weight was pulling her down.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>As the pitcher was being changed, a commercial break started. Watching the professional baseball broadcast, Miran glanced at the old wall clock and mumbled worriedly.</p>
<p>“It’s well past quitting time. Why isn’t she here yet… I told her to get a pager, but she was so stubborn. There needs to be a way to contact her!”</p>
<p>Her older sister Juran worked as an accountant at a small company. The pay was low, but they didn’t usually have many late nights.</p>
<p>“Maybe she has a company dinner?”</p>
