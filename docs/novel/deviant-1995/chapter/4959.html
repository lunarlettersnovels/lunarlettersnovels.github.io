            <p><strong>Chapter 77.1</strong></p>
<p>But for now, André was still enduring her playful teasing, hands thrust into his pockets, every muscle in his body tensed. He couldn’t let such a rare opportunity slip away.</p>
<p>Miran stood in front of him again. At last, he pulled his hands from his pockets, wrapped them around her waist, and pulled her close.</p>
<p>“I’m not done yet.”</p>
<p>When Miran pushed against him, André let out a discontented grunt but stepped back.</p>
<p>The moment her hand touched his belt buckle, his sharply defined abs rippled at once. The buckle came undone with a metallic clank.</p>
<p>Miran took a deep breath and unbuttoned his pants. Then, with careful movements, she pulled the zipper down. Her hands were sweaty, and the bulge in the fabric made it tricky since she fumbled the zipper twice before succeeding.</p>
<p>Before she could lose her nerve, Miran squeezed her eyes shut and yanked down the briefs through the open flap. Something suddenly fell onto the back of her hand. Startled, she opened her eyes and looked down.</p>
<p>A p3.n#s much larger than she remembered, swayed heavily and slowly rose toward his navel. A bead of liquid at the tip glistened, trickling down and fell on the back of her hand.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Miran reached for his p3.n#s, but André grabbed her wrist.</p>
<p>“That’s enough.”</p>
<p>André stripped off his pants and briefs himself, and stood proudly na.k3d in front of her. His body was like a divine creation, as if God had poured every ounce of favor into crafting it. Miran, openly admiring him while swallowing hard, looked up to find André unfastening his watch with a sly grin.</p>
<p>“Do you need more time?”</p>
<p>Miran’s face turned bright red. He flashed a rare, toothy smile, grabbed her wrist, and led her into the shower stall. He turned on the shower, squeezed a cool, woody-scented shower gel into his palm and pulled her close.</p>
<p>“I-I’ll do it myself.”</p>
<p>“Stay still.”</p>
<p>With a stern command, he gently caressed her shoulders with slick palms, then slid down her slender arms. He stroked her back slowly. As his hands gradually moved lower, firmly grasping her b#t.t0ck!s, the feeling of her lower body opening spread through her, and her knees buckled.</p>
<p>“Ngghh…”</p>
<p>Miran staggered, buried her face in his chest, and let out hot breaths. He turned her around and pulled her waist against him. Startled, she pressed her hands against the shower wall. Her palm prints lingered briefly on the steam-fogged surface before fading into the haze.</p>
<p>A man as solid as a stone wall pressed himself seamlessly against her back, rubbing against her as if she were a human bar of soap. The hard length resting above her hips prodded her waist insistently.</p>
<p>André grabbed the shower gel and squeezed a generous amount onto her upper chest.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s cold!”</p>
<p>The gel felt icy against her heated skin, but before she could process it, his hot palms grabbed both her mounds, kneading them as he pleased. Her thighs began to tremble. She clung to André, digging her nails into her forearms without realizing it.</p>
<p>His thick, long fingers climbed her full br3.asts, repeatedly slipping at the peaks, teasing her. Then, trapping a nipple between his index and middle fingers, he rubbed it roughly, sending sharp, pain-like pleasure coursing through her that made her writhe.</p>
<p>“Shh, it’s okay.”</p>
<p>André grabbed her chin as she panted, turned her face, and captured her lips. His hand slid past her flat stomach, delving between her thighs.</p>
<p>“Hnngh!”</p>
<p>Her m0a,n was swallowed by his mouth.</p>
<p>Between her legs, a different kind of slickness, different to the shower gel, coated his fingers. André released her lips and muttered something, nibbling her lower lip as if he was going to bite it. She stiffened in surprise, but his fingers mercilessly parted her legs and pressed firmly against her c.l#t.</p>
<p>The sudden stimulation made Miran rise onto her toes, clenching her thighs. He hugged her waist tightly and held her in place.</p>
<p>A single finger pushed past her tightly closed, delicate folds and stirred her hot inner walls. At the same time, his thumb circled her c.l*t. The stimulation she felt after a long time made her waist tremble.</p>
