            <p><strong>Chapter 91.1</strong></p>
<p>At the club standing at the church entrance, there was a bouncer who looked like a greenhorn barely past twenty. A guy with fluorescent green hair, platform shoes, and clown-like makeup stood tall like the gatekeeper of heaven, scanning the line of people from head to toe as if weighing their sins.</p>
<p>Half went in, half were turned away. The decisions were consistent: suited men with ties mostly grumbled and left, while scantily clad women cheered and entered the church.</p>
<p>André glanced down at his sharply tailored suit and tie.</p>
<p>‘It’d be quicker to just tell her to come out.’</p>
<p>But no matter how many times he called, the line never connected. It seemed the club was too loud for Miran to hear her phone ringing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the green-haired guy ruthlessly turned away three or four men dressed like André.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>It was a disaster.</p>
<p>He was a Lafayette, and even at Manhattan’s most exclusive social clubs and events, he was treated like a VIP. Far from waiting in line to enter, he was ushered in through a private door.</p>
<p>The fact that he was fretting over not being able to get into this damn church—or club, whatever it was—was downright absurd.</p>
<p>‘I guess I should at least give it a try.’</p>
<p>André pulled three or four hundred-dollar bills from his wallet, slipping them between his fingers, and walked toward the entrance when someone called out to him from behind.</p>
<p>[André?]</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been for the voice, he might not have recognized her.</p>
<p>Lorraine, whose bright blonde hair was usually neatly tied back, now let it flow long. She was wearing a silk slip dress and her makeup was much heavier than usual. Behind her, three or four similarly dressed women whispered curiously, watching them with curious eyes.</p>
<p>Wide-eyed, Lorraine shook her head in disbelief.</p>
<p>[I never thought I’d see André de Lafayette in a place like this. I thought I was hallucinating. I hadn’t even taken any dr*gs.]</p>
<p>André stared back with furrowed brows.</p>
<p>She looked so different from her usual self, who was the embodiment of elegant, classic old-money. Catching his gaze, she gave a sheepish little shrug.</p>
<p>[It’s a close gallerist’s birthday. But why are you here? Don’t tell me you came to dance alone?]</p>
<p>[Mind your own business.]</p>
<p>Undeterred, Lorraine smirked teasingly.</p>
<p>[Was the lack of rumors because you meet women here?]</p>
<p>She looked up at him with her brows furrowed as if she just heard a scandal. When André coldly stared down at her, she raised both hands in mock surrender.</p>
<p>[Just kidding. But that money in your hand… are you going to bribe the bouncer?]</p>
<p>Lorraine slightly lifted his arm then checked the bills between his fingers. Then she threw her head back and cackled like a witch.</p>
<p>The Lorraine Carbot André knew never laughed like that or touched others so carelessly. Only then did he realize she was drunk.</p>
<p>[Lorraine Carbot, take your drunken nonsense elsewhere.]</p>
<p>André shook off her hand and turned.</p>
<p>[You’ll never get in on your own.]</p>
<p>He froze.</p>
<p>[He doesn’t take money. People like us would sell our souls for it, but money can’t buy that kind of artistic type, maybe dr*gs. André de Lafayette, you won’t get into this club without my help.]</p>
<p>She stated with conviction.</p>
<p>André slowly turned around, she pointed at his outfit with a mocking look on her face.</p>
<p>[First, do something about that suit. Loosen the tie, lose the jacket. Undo three buttons.]</p>
<p>André grit his teeth as he suppressed something, and mechanically loosened his tie and removed his jacket. Then he unfastened two buttons.</p>
<p>For André, born and raised at the very top of the pyramid, admitting he had limits was no easy thing. The idea of having to ask Lorraine Cabot for help was utterly humiliating.</p>
<p>But Miran was inside, and he wanted her out as soon as possible. So he could endure a moment of humiliation.</p>
<p>Lorraine’s pale blue eyes gleamed with triumph.</p>
<p>[Much better. Follow me.]</p>
<p>As she and her friends approached the velvet rope, the green-haired man recognized them and unhooked it. While Lorraine greeted him with a cheek kiss, André followed the women inside. The green-haired man gave André a once-over, then turned to Lorraine and asked.</p>
<p>[Lori sweetie, is this guy with you?]</p>
<p>[Yeah, a childhood friend.]</p>
<p>[Ooh… really? He’s cute.]</p>
