            <p><strong>Chapter 87.1</strong></p>
<p>As soon as Miran reached the peak of her climax, André withdrew his fingers and pulled his lips away. Clear fluid dripped onto the marble floor, pooling in a small circle. André grabbed her waist and turned her to face the door.</p>
<p>“Put your hand on the door.”</p>
<p>Staggering slightly, Miran obediently stretched out her arms to steady herself against the door. André slowly stood and pressed himself close behind her.</p>
<p>“Step on my feet.”</p>
<p>She stood on his feet.</p>
<p>As André gripped her hips and spread her cheeks, the blunt tip of his erection stretched her slick entrance to its limit as he thrust deep inside.</p>
<p>“Ahh!!”</p>
<p>“Ugh..!.”</p>
<p>M.0a’ns simultaneously broke out from both of their lips. Miran’s upper body collapsed forward.</p>
<p>“Kang Miran, hold on.”</p>
<p>André pressed his lips against her temple and whispered as he wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her up.</p>
<p>“Hnng..!”</p>
<p>While she let out a sobbing m0a’n, Miran bit her lower lip and nodded.</p>
<p>He cupped her mound with one hand and scratched her peak with his thumb, while his other hand rested on her lower abdomen and his fingers were teasing her slippery folds.</p>
<p>At the same time, his member parted her inner walls and drove deeper into her. André angled his thrusts, pressing firmly against the sensitive spot still tingling from her 0rg#s!m.</p>
<p>“Ahngh!”</p>
<p>Her hips spasmed and squeezed him uncontrollably. The soft, tight inner flesh enveloped him, squeezing so intensely that his vision blurred.</p>
<p>Unable to resist the urge of pleasure, Miran’s nails scratched the door. Her climax was barely over when André began moving his hips.</p>
<p>“Hnghh, André! I can’t take it anymore! Ahh!”</p>
<p>Each upward thrust, as if piercing her lower abdomen, slapped their bodies together with a wet smack.</p>
<p>Pressed close behind her, André rubbed his lips against her neck and was exhaling hot breaths. He pressed his large hand against her abdomen, while the other tugged her mounds.</p>
<p>Her trembling elbows buckled as she braced herself against the door. Just before her head hit the wood, André cushioned her forehead with his hand. Yet his thrusts didn’t stop. Instead, he wrapped both arms tightly around her and held her from behind. Half-dazed, Miran threw her head back and gasped against his shoulder.</p>
<p>“S-Stop, I’m gonna die.. Mhnng!”</p>
<p>At that moment, the sound of a door opening and closing echoed from the hallway, followed by voices. Her inner walls clenched tightly.</p>
<p>“Ahnghh!”</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>He covered Miran’s mouth to stifle her cry.</p>
<p>“Shh.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the voices coming from the hallway stopped.</p>
<p>André rammed his lower body into hers, quickening his pace. Miran’s lower abdomen clenched tightly with tension and shame. She trembled all over like a quaking tree, unable to move an inch as if impaled on a pillar. Fearing her sounds might be heard in the hallway, she stifled even the smallest m.0a’n, clenching her teeth and holding her breath.</p>
<p>The voices resumed and faded into the distance.</p>
<p>Miran gasped, throwing her head back with a whimper. As soon as André removed his hand, he covered her lips with his.</p>
<p>“Mmhm..!”</p>
<p>Their beastly cries of climax spilled into each other’s mouths as overwhelming pleasure froze them in place. Shuddering as one, they leaned against the door, panting. André took a moment to catch his breath and savored the lingering spasms of her inner walls before slowly pulling out.</p>
<p>“Nngh…”</p>
<p>Miran shuddered. White fluid gushed from her core and trickled down her thigh. André, crouched behind her, swallowed hard as he watched. He then wiped her with his discarded sweater.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to bed now.”</p>
<p>As he lifted her up with both arms, Miran wrapped her arms around his neck and listlessly rested her head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“…That Latin earlier, please say it one more time.”</p>
<p>André, who had been walking in silence, suddenly spoke in a low voice that echoed through the hallway</p>
<p>[…Ego te amo.]</p>
<p>“Ego te amo, André.”</p>
<p>Miran looked up at him, whispering in a voice as clear as the wind.</p>
<p>[Scio, idem.]</p>
<p>While gazing into her eyes, he muttered an unfamiliar phrase and pressed his lips against her. It was a tender kiss that brought tears to her eyes.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>On Monday afternoon. Miran, having just finished her language school, yawned and stretched.</p>
<p>“Haah…”</p>
<p>Every muscle in her body screamed in protest.</p>
<p>The cost of seducing André was steep. Embraced by him as they entered the bedroom, she couldn’t slip out of bed until late at night when she whimpered that she was hungry.</p>
<p>Seeing Miran’s legs weak and unable to stand properly, André left the bedroom with a sheepish look and returned with food he’d prepared himself, quietly feeding her.</p>
<p>When she complained about their sticky bodies, he filled the bathtub with bubbles and climbed in with her. Miran sank into the warm water, settling onto André as if he were a chair and drifted off to sleep almost instantly</p>
