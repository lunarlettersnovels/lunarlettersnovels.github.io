<p>Andre paused, taken aback by the unexpected words. He then let out a soft chuckle and slowly guided himself, gently rubbing against her. His deep green eyes locked onto Miran, and with a lazy curl of his lips, he murmured her name.</p>
<p>“Kang Miran.”</p>
<p>Miran, her gaze unfocused and distant, let out a soft sound and wrapped her arms around his neck. Her forearms were covered in goosebumps. She demanded in a low, shaky voice.</p>
<p>“Miran.”</p>
<p>“…Miran.”</p>
<p>Andre gently cupped her head in his hands, his voice hushed and raspy as he whispered near her ear. At the same time, the shaft of his length stretched and dug in, threatening to tear the narrow opening.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>Miran’s face contorted in pain.</p>
<p>He had barely gotten the tip halfway in and her body already clamped on him, resisting his movement. He gritted his teeth, his jaw tightening. The pressure wrapped around him was overwhelming, but he couldn’t stop now.</p>
<p>Andre lowered his head and placed gentle kisses on her face, moving slowly with superhuman patience, pausing and then pushing forward again. Sweat began to form on his forehead as he continued.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>He exhaled roughly, and a bead of sweat fell from his chin, trailing down to her chest.</p>
<p>“Andre… I-I’m in so much pain.”</p>
<p>Miran’s face flushed, and her eyes welled with tears.</p>
<p>He was only a third of the way in, and her inner walls tightened and spasmed until he couldn’t push any further. He couldn’t believe that her curling insides could squeeze him harder than the strength of his grip. Suddenly, the base of his c0`ck twitched and he came.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Andre buried his face in her shoulder, tensing his abs and thighs to control himself. His hot breath washed over the back of her neck, and Miran, gasping, began to shiver, as though she were cold. Tears streamed down her temples, and with trembling hands, she touched her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>“It… it feels so strange. My… my belly feels full, oh!”</p>
<p>“Can’t bear it? Should I stop?”</p>
<p>Andre, mustering all the patience and consideration he could gather in his lifetime, asked in hoarse voice.</p>
<p>Miran, her eyes tightly shut, bit her lower lip until it turned white and shook her head vigorously. Her nails, clinging desperately, dug into his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Miran, Miran…”</p>
<p>He called her name soothingly. Then, he cupped her cheeks with both hands and kissed her. It was a much gentler kiss than usual. He lightly licked her lips with his tongue, and as soon as they parted, he entered, wrapping his tongue around hers and drawing her in with his lips, sucking softly.</p>
<p>As they continued the gentle kiss without moving their lower bodies for a while, the tension gradually drained from Miran’s body. It was a sweet and painful torture that pushed Andre’s self-control to its limits.</p>
<p>When she unconsciously tightened and released repeatedly, his stimulated length twitched. It was amazing that a woman new to s#`x could drive a man crazy like this.</p>
<p>“Kuh!”</p>
<p>As Andre let out a groan that scraped his vocal cords, Miran, with tear-streaked, red-rimmed eyes, clung to his neck and pulled him closer.</p>
<p>“…Put it all in at once.”</p>
<p>It was what he wanted too. But strangely, he hesitated.</p>
<p>“It will hurt.”</p>
<p>“Ha… It’s okay because it’s you, Andre. Because I like you.”</p>
<p>Miran gazed at him with eyes glistening with tears, filled with overflowing emotions. She raised her trembling hand to trace his thick eyebrows, straight nose, and sensual lips.</p>
<p>Andre’s heart skipped a beat. His eyes wavered precariously. He felt a dizzying sense of crisis. He felt a strangled, choking sensation in his throat.</p>
<p>“Is s@3x really such an intimate act?”</p>
<p>Andre, frozen as he looked down at her, suddenly swallowed dryly, feeling a burning thirst. His brow furrowed, he pressed their foreheads together and repeated Miran’s name over and over again.</p>
<p>“Kang Miran. Miran…”</p>
<p>It was an instinctive realization that this strange thirst was connected to her.</p>
<p>Andre crashed down on her lips, roughly. He wildly explored her mouth with his tongue, sucking in her saliva, then his hand slid down between her legs to rub her sensitively swollen cl!t0r’is. He greedily swallowed even her pleading m9ans.</p>
