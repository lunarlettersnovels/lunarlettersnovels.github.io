            <h3>Chapter 29.2</h3>
<p>In that split second, Miran’s eyes flew open, and she clenched her thighs, twisting her waist to resist. The hem of her skirt rode dangerously high.</p>
<p>“My skirt—!”</p>
<p>Miran’s hands, gripping the table’s edge, flew down to tug at her skirt and bring her legs back together. But his strength was too much for her to fight.</p>
<p>“Stay still.”</p>
<p>André’s tone, accustomed to giving orders and receiving obedience, pressed down on Miran’s thighs as if physically weighing them down. Instinctively, she flinched, but then forced herself to part her legs, her cheeks flushing bright red.</p>
<p>André pulled up a chair and settled between her now-spread thighs, positioning his torso between them. His hand gripped the back of her neck, pulling her forward until their noses were nearly touching.</p>
<p>“Keep your legs wide.”</p>
<p>His deep voice sent a shiver down her spine. Miran gave a weak nod, lowering her eyes. André brushed her cheek with his hand before gently tugging the lollipop stick protruding from her mouth.</p>
<p>Her lips parted slightly, and her chin tilted upward. André’s tongue slid along the inner seam of her lips. Then, his tongue sought out the candy inside her mouth, pressing it gently against the roof of her mouth and slowly pulling it in.</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>Miran trembled, swallowing repeatedly, overwhelmed by the sensation against the roof of her mouth, and a soft m0an escaped into André’s mouth. The half-melted lollipop was finally rolled onto André’s tongue and sucked into his lips.</p>
<p>When he pulled away, sticky saliva mixed with the red dye of the candy clung around her lips. Miran, dazed and unfocused, ran her tongue over her now empty mouth, feeling strangely bereft.</p>
<p>André leaned back lazily in his chair, the lollipop now between his lips. His intense green eyes scanned her naked body with a detached gaze, as if he were admiring a piece of art.</p>
<p>Even to his discerning eye, her body was flawless. Not even the harsh, glaring fluorescent light could reveal a single imperfection. Her skin was smooth and white, flushed in places like a ripe peach.</p>
<p>Miran’s chest rose and fell with her quickened breaths, her chest trembling like a perfectly frosted cupcake. Her pink peaks stood delicately, like cherry blossoms perched on top, and next to them was a faint red mark—his kiss from the night before.</p>
<p>André swallowed the cloying sweetness of the cherry lollipop, his Adam’s apple bobbing. A faint, pale bruise had formed on Miran’s knee, evidence of how tightly he had gripped her the previous night.</p>
<p>He’d never had a particular sexual preference. Leaving marks on a woman’s body had always struck him as a strange fetish. Yet, with Miran, the urge to torment her, to see her reactions, was overpowering.</p>
<p>The sadistic impulse to grab her soft, delicate skin, to squeeze until it nearly burst, and to sink his teeth into her, surged within him.</p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>André exhaled a long breath, finally admitting one thing to himself—he liked Miran. For someone so typically cynical, it was rare to find anything he liked.</p>
<p>Miran, on the other hand, couldn’t hide her affection for him, like a naive young girl. What did she know about him after just one meeting? Her blind admiration and adoring gaze were a little tiresome, but… in a way, it was rather endearing.</p>
<p>But that was all.</p>
<p>The power in this relationship was his. If he didn’t seek her out, she wouldn’t be able to see him, just like today. It was the first time he’d engaged in such a casual relationship, but from his perspective, it was convenient and safe.</p>
<p>As long as he avoided making promises he couldn’t keep or taking on responsibilities he couldn’t handle, there was no shame in two consenting adults enjoying a mutual relationship. There was no need for him to overthink it.</p>
<p>He bit down on the lollipop stick with a sharp crunch, shattering the candy. The excessive sweetness made him frown slightly.</p>
<p>Miran held her breath as she watched the movement of André’s jaw and lips. It was an oddly brutal, animalistic sight.</p>
<p>“…Do you like candy?” she asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>André let out a short laugh. He had only chewed it to get rid of it, thinking she might keep sucking on it for a while if left unchecked.</p>
<p>“I hate it.”</p>
<p>“…Then why did you take it?”</p>
<p>“It was getting in the way of kissing.”</p>
