            <p><strong>Chapter 78.1</strong></p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>Andre let out a rough breath and moistened his dry lips.</p>
<p>About a third of the way in, maybe.</p>
<p>The point where their bodies joined was clearly visible. A thick, veiny sh@ft, flushed with blood inched forward bit by bit and stretched the delicate, reddened m3mbr@n`3s to their limit. Each time the !nn`3r w@lls sp@s.m3`d around the t#p, they cl@m!p3d down as if to snap his p#n`s. When the 3n.tr@n!c3 relaxed slightly, clear fl*u!d le@k3d out and tr!ck.l3d down his p#n!s.</p>
<p>A shiver ran down Andre’s spine as he watched the sight. His grip tightened on her waist. As the urge to release surged, the base of his fully 3r.ect p#n!s twitched.</p>
<p>“Ohh!”</p>
<p>Miran suddenly threw her head back and m*@ned. It seemed the t!`p had grazed a sensitive spot and sent her into a slight cl!m.@`x.</p>
<p>When she twisted her hips slightly, her collarbone tilted under her long, elegant neck. Her perfectly shaped br#@s`ts swayed seductively with each ragged breath. Her thighs trembled as she tried to sink fully onto his p#n!`s, but Andre held her waist firmly.</p>
<p>The !nn3r w@lls gripping the t!p was still too short to push all the way in. Based on his experiences with her in Korea, Miran needed two or three or`g@s.ms before her body would stretch enough to handle his full length.</p>
<p>She braced herself on his chest, head drooping as she panted. Her wavy brown hair spilled over and tickled his torso. Her glossy brown eyes were clouded with pl.€asur3, and her pale cheeks flushed red. Her sweet, rosy lips parted, releasing soft, sugary breaths.</p>
<p>It was a terrifyingly captivating sight. Enough to drive a man crazy.</p>
<p>Andre raised his knees slightly to adjust the angle, ensuring he didn’t go too deep. Then, gripping her hips, he moved her back and forth as if rubbing.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“Miran, move your hips.”</p>
<p>Miran, her eyes hazy, struggled to lift her head and began to move her hips slightly as he told her.</p>
<p>“Good girl.”</p>
<p>He murmured while grabbing her bre@s`t. When he lightly tugged at her n!pp!l3, she gasped and her !nn3r w@ll-s clenched tightly around him.</p>
<p>“D-don’t do that!”</p>
<p>“This?”</p>
<p>He raised the corner of his mouth mischievously and pulled at her other n!pp!l3. Miran covered her mouth and collapsed halfway onto his chest. Her elbows buckled and her shoulders shook.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Andre let out a short groan. Her !nn3r w@ll-s twitched, feeling like they were chewing his p#n!`s. He tapped her hips that stopped moving.</p>
<p>“Keep moving.”</p>
<p>Miran, eyes unfocused, bit her lower lip and sat up. She began to move her hips, rubbing herself against his p3lv1s as if instinctively learning how to chase pl.€asur3.</p>
<p>Andre reached down to their joined bodies, slipping his fingers into the parted flesh. He found the small, pr0t!r*d1ng bu.d. Just resting his finger there, her movements made the bu.d press against it.</p>
<p>“Aah, Andre… hngh!”</p>
<p>Miran’s nails dug into his chest. Her face, caught between pain and pl.€asur3, tilted back again.</p>
<p>Andre subtly pushed his hips up so that she wouldn’t notice. He just pushed up in line with Miran’s pace without making any violent movements, but the tightness of her !n-n3r w@ll squeezing him became more and more erratic. Moments later, her hips trembled and she shook her head.</p>
<p>“Aah, what do I do? It’s too much… there, haa! Good… Andre, aah!”</p>
<p>Her fragmented words reflected her consciousness consumed by pl.€asur3. Then, as her !nn3r w@ll-s sp@s.m`3d violently, she collapsed onto his chest with a distorted expression.</p>
<p>Each time she twisted her hips, clamping down on him, an intense jolt of pl.€asur3 shot up his spine. Andre, who was pushed to the edge of release, gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>Miran surrendered to the crashing waves of her cl!m.@x, her hot, sl*`ck w@ll.s squeezed him repeatedly. The intense pl.€asur3 made her vision spin.</p>
<p>“Hah.”</p>
<p>A hot breath burst from his lips.</p>
