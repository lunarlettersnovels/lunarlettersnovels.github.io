            <p><strong>Chapter 49.1</strong></p>
<p>Shaking off her disappointment, Miran watched the two men. The waiting time wasn’t boring at all as she observed the two tall, handsome men. Even though they were just talking, it looked like a scene from a movie.</p>
<p>‘No matter how I look at it, my type is the brown-haired vampire count.’</p>
<p>Miran giggled internally.</p>
<p>The blonde was quite handsome too. But even if she had to choose again, she would pick Andre a hundred times out of a hundred. Just then, the blonde flashed a bright smile and winked at Miran.</p>
<p>Why is he doing that to me?</p>
<p>As she returned an awkward smile, Andre sharply turned around to look back.</p>
<p>Miran flinched and dropped her smile at his displeased expression and harsh glare. Andre turned back around and snatched the car keys from the blonde’s hand. Then he practically shoved him out of the parking lot.</p>
<p>Before leaving, the blonde gave Andre a mischievous salute and blew a hand kiss to Miran with a playful smile. While she was flustered, not knowing how to react, Andre suddenly appeared and blocked her view. The slightly different angle of his eyebrows from usual looked ominous.</p>
<p>“He’s a playboy.”</p>
<p>Andre grumbled irritably. Then he paused and blinked. He seemed surprised by his own words. He let out a deep sigh, bit his lower lip hard, and covered his eyes with his hand against his forehead.</p>
<p>Watching him, Miran bit her lip to keep from laughing.</p>
<p>‘Could this be jealousy?’</p>
<p>Andre turned sharply, creating a gust of wind, and instead of gently placing his hand on her back as usual, he roughly grabbed her wrist and pulled. Miran, following him with quick steps, silently shook with laughter. He just squeezed her wrist more firmly without looking back at her.</p>
<p>Andre opened the passenger door and helped her into the car.</p>
<p>‘Is this the car borrowed from that blonde guy?’</p>
<p>Miran’s mouth fell open as she looked back while fastening her seatbelt.</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s a camper van!”</p>
<p>She’d only seen them in movies; this was her first time seeing one in person. The camper van was equipped with a bed, small table, and even a kitchenette. As she kept looking back, squirming in her seat, Andre got in and started the engine.</p>
<p>The surprises didn’t end there. Andre drove the camper van to a supermarket called ‘Commissary,’ which was as big as a department store’s basement food court. It had everything from food and beverages to general merchandise so you could shop for everything in one place, and there were many things she’d never seen before.</p>
<p>Trailing close beside Andre as he pushed the cart, loading it with camping necessities and food, it felt just like being newlyweds.</p>
<p>Knowing it was an impossible dream made her sad enough to tear up, but she didn’t want to show a gloomy face on this first and last trip with Andre.</p>
<p>Before leaving the base, Andre carefully examined an English highway atlas. He traced the winding line marked with blue highlighter with his finger, then laid the atlas on the dashboard and started the engine.</p>
<p>“So, where are we going?”</p>
<p>“Inje, Naerincheon.”</p>
<p>He slowly pulled out of the Commissary parking lot.</p>
<p>“…Where is that?”</p>
<p>“Gangwon-do.”</p>
<p>As if there was nothing more to say, Andre focused on the road ahead while driving toward the gate.</p>
<p>Really, he was a man of too few words. Maybe he’d talk more in English.</p>
<p>Miran pouted and grumbled internally. She’d never heard of Naerincheon in Inje, Gangwon-do before. It was fascinating that a foreigner knew about a place even Koreans weren’t familiar with.</p>
<p>‘What does it matter where it is? If he wants to go there, what choice do I have? Let’s go.’</p>
<p>Miran stretched her arms forward and shouted.</p>
<p>“Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Andre turned the wheel with a smirk as they left through the gate.</p>
<p>Around the time they got on the highway, Miran started nodding off. Though it felt like she hadn’t slept long, she suddenly woke up after bumping her head against the window.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>“There was a ‘thunk’ sound, like a rock hitting the window.”</p>
