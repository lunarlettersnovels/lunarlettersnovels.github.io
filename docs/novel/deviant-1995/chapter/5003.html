            <p><strong>Chapter 55.1</strong></p>
<p>They had unprotected s<em>x twice. Once was by the stream, and the other time was last night right before Miran fell asleep. Of course, he pulled out both times just before c</em>mm!.ng, but accidents could still happen.</p>
<p>“If something happens… I’ll take responsibility.”</p>
<p>André nodded, his mouth tightly closed. The answer was surprisingly clear and easy.</p>
<p>If by any chance something did happen, André planned to bring Miran to New York and fulfill his duties and responsibilities. It was ironic that this prospect didn’t feel terribly daunting to him.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The sedan carrying André crossed the Triborough Bridge, which spans Randall’s Island, and entered Manhattan. As they drove south along the FDR Drive, the East River came into view outside the car window. Against the backdrop of a clear, blue afternoon sky without a single cloud, a white yacht sailed upstream, leaving a trail of foam in its wake.</p>
<p>Enzo, with over 40 years of driving experience, knew Manhattan like the back of his hand. He expertly navigated the roads, choosing a route that avoided traffic, and crossed the narrow streets of Yorkville as if guided by intuition.</p>
<p>Even when André was about to leave for the military academy, Yorkville was still filled with old tenements. However, by now, newly constructed buildings had sprung up here and there. Among them, André noticed a luxury condo apartment recently completed by Gerald’s company, the Hamilton Group. As he gazed at the building, André became lost in thought. The new apartments stood out, rising above the old buildings like solitary peaks. It was a bold investment.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Group was a company that led the trend in real estate development, and when they paved the way, other companies would follow in droves.</p>
<p>Lafayette-Lowell, which owned numerous buildings of various sizes throughout Manhattan, had been lobbying alongside Hamilton for years to build a subway station on 2nd Avenue in Yorkville. It seemed that Hamilton’s bold move was a sign of significant progress. If that was the case, it was likely time for Lafayette-Lowell to cautiously step forward as well.</p>
<p>‘Check the progress of the subway station construction.’</p>
<p>André’s mental checklist continued to grow.</p>
<p>His mother, Grace Plum de Lafayette, held the official title of Vice Chairman. However, she effectively acted as the Chairman, taking her father’s place, as he had little interest in company affairs. Once a month, she would send André important documents by mail, summarizing key issues.</p>
<p>As the third largest shareholder, André’s official title was Chairman of the Board of Directors, representing the majority shareholders. After inheriting the majority of shares following Grace’s passing, he became the de facto largest shareholder of the Lafayette-Lowell Group.</p>
<p>Although he had followed the Lafayette family tradition by serving in the military, he had never forgotten where he belonged.</p>
<p>From his teenage years until he graduated from the military academy, he spent his vacations concealing his identity and working at the bottom of hotels and department stores to learn the ropes. His major at the military academy was also business administration, and even during his military service, he made time to earn an MBA degree, never slacking off in his preparations. When he became an adult, Grace would discuss company matters, big and small, with André instead of her husband.</p>
<p>However, a year ago, Grace started receiving medical treatment, and Gordon Lowell, the CEO of a distribution affiliate, took over as acting vice chairman. Since then, it was clear he was blocking André’s involvement in company affairs. The shoddy paperwork, which were reluctantly sent to him only when requested, stopped coming altogether six months ago.</p>
<p>The absence of Grace, who wielded absolute power, meant that the company had lost its central axis.</p>
<p>‘[The past six months must have been a perfect opportunity for those looking got an opening.’</p>
<p>André had held onto a faint hope that his father might be able to maintain the status quo until he returned, but he knew it was all vain.</p>
<p>So, whether he liked it or not, it was time to end his wanderings and get back to work. If things had gone awry, he needed to set them straight.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The sedan turned south on Fifth Avenue. Mid-September in New York was still more like summer than autumn. However, the trees surrounding Central Park were like harbingers of the approaching season, scattering red and yellow leaves on the ground.</p>
<p>The comfort of familiarity, and the sinking feeling that here he was again.</p>
<p>The Manhattan landscape evoked mixed emotions in him.</p>
<p>Enzo slowed down in front of a classic limestone building located diagonally from the Metropolitan Museum. As the sedan came to a stop, Charlie O’Brien, a middle-aged doorman dressed in a navy blue uniform, approached and opened the rear door wide.</p>
<p>[Welcome home, Mr. Lafayette!]</p>
